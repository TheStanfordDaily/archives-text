# Jong Ties Liberation, Self-Knowledge

Beware of Ihe man who praises
liberated women: he is planning to
quit his job
—Erica Jong

By GEORGE DOBBINS

Reading poems and an excerpt
from her national best seller. Fear of
Flying, to an overflow crowd in
Cubberley Auditorium last night,
authoress Erica Jong said men and
particularly women must "liberate"
themselves through self-knowledge.
"Everything I've written is about
self-exploration," she later told the
Daily.
The 33-year old writer spoke to
800 people inside Cubberley and
another 300 listening to a public
address system in adjacent rooms. Her
address was part of the International
Women's Year Activities at Stanford.
She said she read her work rather
than giving a speech because, "If I can
simplify my thoughts to one thing,
why should I write all these books?"

Before appearing on stage, Jong
herself faced a minor identity crisis.
She claimed that she almost wasn't let
into the auditorium because "no one
recognized me." Jong, clad in a blue
denim suit. commented, "I'm very
short and I write tall."
Jong then began her reading of 16
poems which touched upon a variety
of subjects.
Visions Of Love
A majority of the poems concerned
her visions of love. In a less serious
work. "The Dirty Laundry Poem,"
Jong dealt with the notion that "lovers
always accumulate dirty laundry. You
know you're in love when you're too
busy to wash \ our jeans."
On the serious side, she urged
people to "never be stingy with
love .. . unfortunately, most prople
think that if they hoard their love,
they're keeping themselves safe. It's
just the opposite. The more you give,
the more you get."

Jong read a tribute to Walt
Whitman from her forthcoming book,
Loveroots. She called Whitman a man
"not limited to his own narrowness"
and claimed that "all great writers
have this ability." She said that she
found Whitman at a time when sh(
was "very confused" and under
psychoanalysis and that his thoughts
gave her "a greater affirmation of joy"
in her life.
Not Complimentary
Several of Jong's poems were not
complimentary towards men. In "Here
Comes," she spoofed the institution of
marriage in America as well as Brides
magazine, commenting that the groom
"could be a robot, anybody to justify
the orgy of consumption going on."
Jong called the groom an "enormous
prick full of money."
Jong claimed that the "natural
world" had great significance for her.
She spoke of the "heart of fruits and
vegetables" (her first published book

of poetry is so titled). "If 1 could
penetrate these objects, 1 could find
out about myself," she said. Jong read
poems about eggplant (the "sexiest
fruit"), onions and eggs ("all the
people in my life are inside little
eggs").
Jong admitted that her success in
exploring the "natural world" and
other subjects came as a surprise. "1
honestly believed I'd never be
published," she commented.
She went on to state that there is
"never a review of a woman writer in
which her sex is not mentioned. We
are called feminist writers but we are
disparaged nonetheless." She said that
men usually compliment women
writers by saying, "You write like a
man,' as if there aren't millions of
mediocre male writers."
Reading from Fear of Flying, Jong
said her major character could not
decide whether to love men or live
alone. Asked which lifestyle she
personally prefers, Jong said both.
"People do contradictory things. It
would be incredibly boring if we
choose one style of life and stick with
it forever."

than giving a speech because, "If I can
simplify my thoughts to one thing,
why should I write all these books?"

Before appearing on stage, Jong
herself faced a minor identity crisis.
She claimed that she almost wasn't let
into the auditorium because "no one
recognized me." Jong, clad in a blue
denim suit. commented, "I'm very
short and I write tall."
Jong then began her reading of 16
poems which touched upon a variety
of subjects.
Visions Of Love
A majority of the poems concerned
her visions of love. In a less serious
work. "The Dirty Laundry Poem,"
Jong dealt with the notion that "lovers
always accumulate dirty laundry. You
know you're in love when you're too
busy to wash \ our jeans."
On the serious side, she urged
people to "never be stingy with
love .. . unfortunately, most prople
think that if they hoard their love,
they're keeping themselves safe. It's
just the opposite. The more you give,
the more you get."

Jong read a tribute to Walt
Whitman from her forthcoming book,
Loveroots. She called Whitman a man
"not limited to his own narrowness"
and claimed that "all great writers
have this ability." She said that she
found Whitman at a time when sh(
was "very confused" and under
psychoanalysis and that his thoughts
gave her "a greater affirmation of joy"
in her life.
Not Complimentary
Several of Jong's poems were not
complimentary towards men. In "Here
Comes," she spoofed the institution of
marriage in America as well as Brides
magazine, commenting that the groom
"could be a robot, anybody to justify
the orgy of consumption going on."
Jong called the groom an "enormous
prick full of money."
Jong claimed that the "natural
world" had great significance for her.
She spoke of the "heart of fruits and
vegetables" (her first published book

of poetry is so titled). "If 1 could
penetrate these objects, 1 could find
out about myself," she said. Jong read
poems about eggplant (the "sexiest
fruit"), onions and eggs ("all the
people in my life are inside little
eggs").
Jong admitted that her success in
exploring the "natural world" and
other subjects came as a surprise. "1
honestly believed I'd never be
published," she commented.
She went on to state that there is
"never a review of a woman writer in
which her sex is not mentioned. We
are called feminist writers but we are
disparaged nonetheless." She said that
men usually compliment women
writers by saying, "You write like a
man,' as if there aren't millions of
mediocre male writers."
Reading from Fear of Flying, Jong
said her major character could not
decide whether to love men or live
alone. Asked which lifestyle she
personally prefers, Jong said both.
"People do contradictory things. It
would be incredibly boring if we
choose one style of life and stick with
it forever."

HELLO JONG LOVERS—Erica Jong, novelist and poet, appeared for a reading
of her material last night to an overflow Stanford audience.
Beware of Ihe man who praises
liberated women: he is planning to
quit his job
—Erica Jong

By GEORGE DOBBINS

Reading poems and an excerpt
from her national best seller. Fear of
Flying, to an overflow crowd in
Cubberley Auditorium last night,
authoress Erica Jong said men and
particularly women must "liberate"
themselves through self-knowledge.
"Everything I've written is about
self-exploration," she later told the
Daily.
The 33-year old writer spoke to
800 people inside Cubberley and
another 300 listening to a public
address system in adjacent rooms. Her
address was part of the International
Women's Year Activities at Stanford.
She said she read her work rather
than giving a speech because, "If I can
simplify my thoughts to one thing,
why should I write all these books?"
