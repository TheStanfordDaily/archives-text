## Xoregos Company: Ambitious Dance 
### JANICE ROSS 
SAN FRANCISCO - The city
of San Francisco has never been
especially renown for its support
of any of the arts, least of all
dance. One exception, however, is
the Xoregos Performing
Company, headed by the lively
Shelia Xoregos.
Under her aegis, the Xoregos
Performing Company has recently
managed to amass an impressive
and unusual sum of grant monies,
including a substantial grant from
the prestigious National
Endowment for the Arts.
The Xoregos Group hasn't
wasti d any time in putting this
new-found money to use. Their
spring season, which began last
weekend at the company's Attic
Theatre in San Francisco, boasted
several new works choreographed
by Xoregos with elaborate
costumes for each, as well as an
original commissioned electronic
score for the longest of the new
works, L 'His to ire Du Soldat.
Compared with the evening's
other works, L'Histoire revealed
to best advantage the special
talents of the Xoregos troupe. On
the surface L'Histoire is just
another version of the good versus
evil parable. But the skillful
intertwining of music, movement
and dialogue elevates it from the
merely banal.

Rather than being a strictly
dance or dramatic piece it is a
thoughtful blend of both. The
focal point is Glenn-Charles
Musagetes, as the devil, who gives
a masterful portrayal combining
dramatic presence and
well-integrated movements.
Musagetes performs with the rare
ease of one adept in both the
theatrical and kinetic realm.

Unfortunately all of Xoregos'
performers aren't gifted with the
same talents. While most of them
do function well in a dramatic
context, they are somewhat less
successful in the straight dancing
parts.
There is a certain underlying
nervousness and self-consciousness
that undermines some of the
dancing and makes the

movements appear unnecessarily
tense and tentative.
Wise Arrangement
In this respect Xoregos has
wisely arranged her dances so that
the casts of each alternate, giving
everyone the opportunity to
perform several different roles.
Hopefully as the season progresses
this rotating performance
schedule will help the dancers to
perform with more confidence.
As a choreographer Xoregos
borrows freely from some of the
20th century's greatest artists; she
cites as her sources individuals like
Miro, lonesco, Kollwitz, Kafka
and Stravinsky. This practice,
however, can prove to be a
liability as well as an asset, after
all it's difficult to improve on
great art.
The danger here is that rather
than standing as an artistic
statement in its own right, a dance

like More Than Miro or Turning
(the Kafka influenced piece),
becomes merely an addendum to
an already complete statement.
Xoregos is more successful in
dances like L'Histoire and Maide
To Marry, a zany lonescoan farce,
where her own artistic message
isn't muddied or overshadowed by
another's.
The one dance at Friday
evening's concert that wasn't
choreographed by Xoregos was
Score, a light and droll piece by
Katherine Litz. Unlike Xoregos'
works Score wasn't profound or
provocative: it was simply a
whimsical study of various
movement and attitude nuances
of ordinary people.
It provided a nice counterpoint
to the evening's other dances
because it lacked precisely the
passion and power of Xoregos'
works.

of San Francisco has never been
especially renown for its support
of any of the arts, least of all
dance. One exception, however, is
the Xoregos Performing
Company, headed by the lively
Shelia Xoregos.
Under her aegis, the Xoregos
Performing Company has recently
managed to amass an impressive
and unusual sum of grant monies,
including a substantial grant from
the prestigious National
Endowment for the Arts.
The Xoregos Group hasn't
wasti d any time in putting this
new-found money to use. Their
spring season, which began last
weekend at the company's Attic
Theatre in San Francisco, boasted
several new works choreographed
by Xoregos with elaborate
costumes for each, as well as an
original commissioned electronic
score for the longest of the new
works, L 'His to ire Du Soldat.
Compared with the evening's
other works, L'Histoire revealed
to best advantage the special
talents of the Xoregos troupe. On
the surface L'Histoire is just
another version of the good versus
evil parable. But the skillful
intertwining of music, movement
and dialogue elevates it from the
merely banal.

Rather than being a strictly
dance or dramatic piece it is a
thoughtful blend of both. The
focal point is Glenn-Charles
Musagetes, as the devil, who gives
a masterful portrayal combining
dramatic presence and
well-integrated movements.
Musagetes performs with the rare
ease of one adept in both the
theatrical and kinetic realm.

Unfortunately all of Xoregos'
performers aren't gifted with the
same talents. While most of them
do function well in a dramatic
context, they are somewhat less
successful in the straight dancing
parts.
There is a certain underlying
nervousness and self-consciousness
that undermines some of the
dancing and makes the

movements appear unnecessarily
tense and tentative.
Wise Arrangement
In this respect Xoregos has
wisely arranged her dances so that
the casts of each alternate, giving
everyone the opportunity to
perform several different roles.
Hopefully as the season progresses
this rotating performance
schedule will help the dancers to
perform with more confidence.
As a choreographer Xoregos
borrows freely from some of the
20th century's greatest artists; she
cites as her sources individuals like
Miro, lonesco, Kollwitz, Kafka
and Stravinsky. This practice,
however, can prove to be a
liability as well as an asset, after
all it's difficult to improve on
great art.
The danger here is that rather
than standing as an artistic
statement in its own right, a dance

like More Than Miro or Turning
(the Kafka influenced piece),
becomes merely an addendum to
an already complete statement.
Xoregos is more successful in
dances like L'Histoire and Maide
To Marry, a zany lonescoan farce,
where her own artistic message
isn't muddied or overshadowed by
another's.
The one dance at Friday
evening's concert that wasn't
choreographed by Xoregos was
Score, a light and droll piece by
Katherine Litz. Unlike Xoregos'
works Score wasn't profound or
provocative: it was simply a
whimsical study of various
movement and attitude nuances
of ordinary people.
It provided a nice counterpoint
to the evening's other dances
because it lacked precisely the
passion and power of Xoregos'
works.
