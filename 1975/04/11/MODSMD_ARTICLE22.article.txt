# Savoyards Offer Sparkling 'Ruddigore'
## 
### AARON WEINER 
By AARON WEINER

Heavens to Murgatroyd! The
Stanford Savoyards have done it
again. They treated a full
Dinkelspiel Auditorium crowd to
an evening of technically flawless
Gilbert and Sullivan charm with
their production of Ruddigore, or

The Witches Curse.
The cast and orchestra,
conducted by the gifted Dan
Robinson, handled one of Gilbert
and Sullivans most musically
demanding works with confidence
rare for an amateur group.
The operetta is a humorous
blend of sinister, glum lyrics and
clever, light, sing-songy rhyme,
which makes it a hilarious story to
witness.
In Ruddigore\ case, we have
Mad Margaret, depicted
masterfully by Connie McKee,
who loves Sir Despard despite his
evil ways, and marries him when
he is free from the curse. McKee,
a natural for the role, turns
emotions on and off — giggling

one moment and fervently
weeping the next — with a
smoothness that makes the
character very human indeed.
Then there is Old Adam
Goodheart, Robin's faithful
servant, played deftly by John
Breakwell. He faithfully creates
the lovable old character with his
hunched posture and exaggerated
British drawl. And his fine basso
voice adds tremendous tone to
every piece he sings in.
The bright quality of these two
characters still cannot obscure the
brilliance of the four leads. Tim
Martin as Robin once again has
filled a G&S romantic lead with
youthfulness and a clear voice
(now if only he wouldn't
nervously clench his fists on
stage). Agile Sandy Smith, with
his resonant tenor voice, injects a
lightness and humor into Richard
Dauntless (if only he'd stop
brushing his hair out of his eyes
like a teenager).

Peter Vilkin's skill at being a
villain (Sir Despard) is enough to
make an audience hiss, and hiss
they did. His vocals and acting arc
superior as he carefully unveils a
soft heart beneath his rough
exterior.
But the best performance of
the evening was delivered by
Elizabeth Barbour, in the comic
role of Rose Maybud. Perpetually
toting her etiquette book she has
the ability (and the composure) to
constantly express joy, passion, or
dismay from her entire body
while singing from probably the
finest soprano vocal chords the
Stanford Savoyards have ever
known. And what comic timing —
bravo!
Indeed, the show was first rate
all around. The sets were simple
yet effective. The costumes were
colorful and elegant (have you
ever seen a gentleman in shocking
pink tails?).
And even the programs were
beautiful.

demanding works with confidence
rare for an amateur group.
The operetta is a humorous
blend of sinister, glum lyrics and
clever, light, sing-songy rhyme,
which makes it a hilarious story to

In Ruddigore\ case, we have
Mad Margaret, depicted
masterfully by Connie McKee,
who loves Sir Despard despite his
evil ways, and marries him when
he is free from the curse. McKee,
a natural for the role, turns
emotions on and off — giggling

one moment and fervently
weeping the next — with a
smoothness that makes the
character very human indeed.
Then there is Old Adam
Goodheart, Robin's faithful
servant, played deftly by John
Breakwell. He faithfully creates
the lovable old character with his
hunched posture and exaggerated
British drawl. And his fine basso
voice adds tremendous tone to
every piece he sings in.
The bright quality of these two
characters still cannot obscure the
brilliance of the four leads. Tim
Martin as Robin once again has
filled a G&S romantic lead with
youthfulness and a clear voice
(now if only he wouldn't
nervously clench his fists on
stage). Agile Sandy Smith, with
his resonant tenor voice, injects a
lightness and humor into Richard
Dauntless (if only he'd stop
brushing his hair out of his eyes
like a teenager).

Peter Vilkin's skill at being a
villain (Sir Despard) is enough to
make an audience hiss, and hiss

superior as he carefully unveils a

finest soprano vocal chords the

Heavens to Murgatroyd! The
Stanford Savoyards have done it
again. They treated a full
Dinkelspiel Auditorium crowd to
an evening of technically flawless
Gilbert and Sullivan charm with
their production of Ruddigore, or

The Witches Curse.
The cast and orchestra,
conducted by the gifted Dan
Robinson, handled one of Gilbert
and Sullivans most musically
demanding works with confidence
rare for an amateur group.
The operetta is a humorous
blend of sinister, glum lyrics and
clever, light, sing-songy rhyme,
which makes it a hilarious story to
witness.
