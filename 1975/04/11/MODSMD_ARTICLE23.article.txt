# Dizzy Dazzles In Mem Aud
## 
### DAN FORTE 
In 1945 an independent record
label called Guild recorded the
first-ever "bebop" session
featuring the style's two chief
innovators, Charlie "Yardbird"
Parker and John "Dizzy"
Gillespie.
Bebop was founded by a
school of young musicians
dissatisfied with the indifferent
charts of the dance bands they
played in. It was immediately
disclaimed by many members of
the older swing school of jazz,
such as Tommy Dorsey who said,
"Bebop has set music back 20
years."
But, clearly, bebop was where
it was happening, where the old
barriers were being torn down
nightly by the most capable
blowers in the business. Songs
with especially tricky chord
progressions were played at
blistering tempos, thus serving the
dual purpose of keeping sub-par
jazzmen off the bandstand, and
forcing audiences off the
dance floors and into their seats.
While Parker was the music's
true originator and genius, Dizzy
was its ambassador, as well as its
trademark. The man with the
upswept trumpet, who made
berets, goatees and hornrims the
standard of beatnik fashion, who
formulated such hip philosophies
as, "We are all branches of one
tree, leaves of one branch, and
fruit thereof," is without a doubt
the most colorful figure in jazz
today.
He is also one of the best
trumpeters of all time. He is said

to have shortened his mouthpiece
in order to get to the note
quicker. As Miles Davis once said
of the bop scene of the late '40s,
"Whenever we wanted to learn
something new, we'd go and listen
to Dizzy."
Dizzy is the type of artist who
refuses to stand still for very long.
While a good portion of his
repertoire is still hard bop, he is
now one of jazz' main exponents
of Latin sounds. His show at
Memorial Auditorium last Friday
included plenty of both, as well as
a generous helping of Dizzy's
usual jive patter.
Dizzy's opening set included
one of his most famous
compositions "A Night in
Tunisia," and one of his most
recent, "Olinga," inspired by the
East African religious leader of
the same name. Possibly the most
stunning selection of the evening,
"Olinga" appears on his
Grammy-nominated LP, Portrait
of Jenny.
Beautiful Mute
Also, noteworthy was Dizzy's
beautiful, muted rendition of
"Manha de Carnival," from Black
Orpheus. But, it wasn't until the
second set that Dizzy and his trio
really seemed to loosen up and
swing.
The crowd was treated to two
of Diz's fine vocal numbers, first a
soulish arrangement of Gershwin's
"Summertime," then a
blockbuster slow blues, with lyrics
such as:
"Well, I'm 57 years old, but
I'm goin' on 22.
But, make no mistake about it,

I still got some shit for you."
Dizzy expressed his love for
the blues idiom, saying "If you
keep one foot in the blues and
one in the future, you can't miss.
As long as music is played on the
face of the earth, blues'll be layin'
in there."
Triple Support
Throughout both the sets, Diz
was supported by a fine trio
composed of guitarist A 1 Gafa,
drummer Mickey Roker and
bassist Earl Maye. One of the
highlights of the show was the
soft "Barcelona," written by
Gafa, whose presence made the
lack of a piano in the band (as is
the case with most trumpet-led
groups) seldom noticeable.
The "fifth" member of the
quartet was Dizzy the
percussionist, playing congas on
most numbers. Having learned
Latin percussion from Chano
Pozo, Dizzy has recently recorded
an LP which features no trumpet
at all, just his percussion work.
After closing with "I'll Never
Go Back To Georgia," Dizzy
returned for an encore and several
curtain calls. He nearly always
gives an audience 100
percent of himself both as
musician and personality.
Now more than ever: "Dizzy
Gillespie For President!"

in the '40s and he hasn't slowed down since.
