Genesis
The Lamb Lies Down On
Broadway
Atlantic

Genesis' flawlessly recorded
rock opera. The Lamb Lies Down
on Broadway features excellent
music on sides one and two.
"Fly on a Windshield" and
"Back in N.Y.C." fully document
the pace of city life: Tony Bank's
relentlessly pulsing
synthesizer/keyboards' whines
blend with a pounding bass line.
These two instruments
continue to work well together
throughout the album, capturing
the essence of a primary theme:
the desperation of the opera's
hero, Rael.
Peter Gabriel's vocals can
capture any of these moods, but
he's best when bellowing about
Rael as the confused, angry city
prowler. His style is
convincing on sides three a: .
four, when thematic concreteness
and musical execution shift to
somber instrumental ramblings.
Since iMmb is a rock opera,
one feels compelled to discuss the
theme along with the music. The
album contains a long-winded
explanation of Rael's adventures.
Rael is apparently suffering from
a severe psychosis, probably

schizophrenia, or has introduced
his body to some vicious
chemical, while wandering
through subways.
