# Roy Buchanan
## Legend Performs 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
BERKELEY â€” Roy Buchanan
has recorded four unsuccessful
albums since 1972, and spends the
major part of his musical career
playing in small clubs and doing
sessions fo<- other artists.
Yet the Berkeley Community
Theater was sold out Friday night
when Buchanan appeared as a
one-act show. His performance on
the electric guitar inspires
admiration in musicians like Eric
Clapton and Rolling Stone calls
him "the Guitar Legend."
To watch Buchanan in action is
to realize immediately that he's
memorized every square
millimeter of his old 1953 Fender
Telecaster, and knows exactly
which sound his unique touch
will produce. He holds the
instrument higher than most
guitarists: the body is suspended
unusually close to his chest.
His left hand sweeps up and
down the neck like wildfire,
emitting lines bursting with
intricacy. Buchanan's stance is
statuesque, and his eyes
constantly focus on his hands.
Occasionally a sheepish smile in
response to the audience's raves
breaks out from behind his heavy
beard.
His pick massaged the strings
with delicacy Friday as he quietly
crept into "Hey Joe" for a few
introductory bars. Suddenly his
attitude changed as he alternately
punched forcefully quick and
sustained notes into the basic line,

then eased off with more tranquil
interludes.
The spread of sounds which
Buchanan nonchalantly coaxes
from his instrument are simply
astounding. He doesn't fool
around with noisy special effects:
he is a master of timing, inflection
and spontaneity.
Drummer Byrd Foster and
bassist John Harrison dominated
the vocals and provided adequate
back-up. Buchanan did sing a few
songs, but his range in this respect
is limited and he knows it.
However, it is amusing to watch
him sing, for his eyes tilt sharply
upwards, as if he's asking for
divine inspiration.
The evening's program did not
rely upon Buchanan's
compositions, but on greats like
Neil Young and Jimi Hendrix,
some classic tunes like "Johnny B.
Goode," and other rhythm and
blues material such as "Treat Her
Right" and "Change My Mind."
