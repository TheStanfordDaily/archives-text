## Football Time...Already!? 
### Ron Beck 
Believe it or not, it's football time again.
Spring football practice starts tomorrow morning at
9:30, and if you listen to head coach Jack Christiansen
talk about prospects for the upcoming season, you'd think
everything is in perfect shape.
And it's a little reassuring to know that Christiansen is
taking such a calm view of what might be a gloomy
situation. Although the team lost Bof 11 starters on
defense and three on offeree, Christiansen claims that.

"We're not looking for anything specific in the spring,
we'll just be working on the fundamentals, the basics."
Christiansen feels that by the end of spring practice a
lot ot question marks should be removed, including one
that's hovered over Chris' head for the past year — the
quarterback crew. "We hope to have a starting quarterback
chosen by the time spring practice is over," dreams
Christiansen.
"It will be almost like starting from scratch. We're
going to reevaluate every quarterback. Every time they
| Guy Benjamin, Jerry Waldvogel or Mike Cordova) do
anything, they'll be evaluated. Every time they run, pass,
move ... every thing will be looked at."
Heard It Before?
If that sounds like a recording of what Chris said last
spring, that's because it is. Chris adds, though, that this
year, "it's a healthier situation. We've got three proven
quarterbacks all with good heads, good size, strength,
arms and speed. We won't have to worry about our
quarterbacks this year."
The rest of the offense is pretty much set. Chris says
that Ron Inge and Dave Tenn have the inside track on the
two running back positions.
The receiving corps should be one of the squad's finer
attributes. Tony Hill, Bill Singler and Ted Pappas are an
experienced group of pass-catchers.
Chris singles out Tom Tipton, Alex Karakozoff, A 1
Tenßruggencate, Todd Anderson and Gordon King on the
offensive line. "Overall," analyzes Chris, "we feel we'll
have a good, solid offense this year."
Graduation: Painful!
Defensively, the team will be hurt badly by graduation.
Chris feels, though, that "We have qualified people who
can step in and do the job for us this year." According to
Chris, Duncan McColl, at right end, and Geb Church, at
outside linebacker, are the only players with secure
starting assignments, but Chris' depth carts (on the left)

shows who the leading contenders are for each spot.
And if everything goes as Chris thinks it will, his
confidence might just translate this spring into winning
football.

On a different note, Bay Area tennis fans will get a
chance to see the best amateur tennis in the nation when
Stanford takes on UCLA and USC next weekend.
UCLA plays here Friday, with four singles and two
doubles matches being played starting at 1 p.m. on the
varsity courts. First and second singles, and first doubles
are scheduled for Maples Pavilion at 6:30 p.m. The Maples
matches will show off the nation's four highest-ranked
amateurs: Billy Martin (No. 22—U.S. Men's Rankings);
John Whitlinger (No. 27); Brian Teacher (No. 28); and Jim
Delaney (No. 36).
Previous Meetings
In their first meeting of the year, Whitlinger was losing
to Martin in Monday's incomplete UCLA-Stanford match.
Brian Teacher will probably play Nick Saviano in the other
singles feature, a chance for Saviano to avenge his loss to
Teacher last week. Whitlinger-Delaney, the defending
NCAA doubles champs, meet Martin-Teacher for the first
time.
Saturday's match with USC will be played in the same
format. Butch Walts, the Southern California
Intercollegiate singles champ, plays Whitlinger in one of
the Maples duals. Whitlinger lost to Walts last weekend in a
close three-set match in Los Angeles. Bruce Manson will
face Nick Saviano in the second singles match, and in the
featured doubles match, the Southern California
Intercollegiate doubles champs, Walts-Manson, will play
Whitlinger-Delaney.
If past attendance is any indication, both matches
should be sold out day and night, so that advance ticket
purchase is highly recommended. Tickets are still on sale
for both matches at the Athletic Department.

ANOTHER SEASON?—Yep, even though it seems like the season just
ended, football is upon us once again. Coach Christiansen looks pretty
optimistic about this spring's practice . . . and why not? The team
only lost 11 of 22 starters from last season's second-place team.
