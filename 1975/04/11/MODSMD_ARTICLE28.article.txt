# Wingo Anchors Card Squad

Scott Wingo wasn't even
finished with his anchor leg for
the Stanford mile relay squad last
week at UCLA's Ducky Drake
Stadium, when some of the 2000
track fans began heading for the
exits.
"Don't leave until he finishes,"
pleaded Bruin anchorman Benny
Brown, who was catching his
breath as Wingo neared the finish
line. Some of the fans stood their
ground. Then came the ominous
announcement, "The final score
of today's meet is UCLA 101,
Stanford 33." The fans burst into
laughter.
Needless to say, last week
wasn't exactly the best one for
the Cards or Wingo, who anchored
the losing 440 and mile relay
squads. But Wingo, Stanford's
"most versatile long sprinter"
according to coach Payton
Jordan, isn't sulking. He's looking
forward to the Card's next major
test on April 19, USC.
"USC's the team to beat.
They've really got it together.
They may even be tougher than
UCLA," Wingo said. Why is he

looking forward to running
against the Trojans, whose mile
relay squad (3:07.4) figures to run
away from the Card crew
(3.13.0)?
Jordan had an answer. "Scott's
very confident. He does what he
does and does it well," says
Jordan. "He was gobbled up by
Brown, but he wasn't down. He
takes what he has to take."
Wingo has taken a lot lately in
his role as the anchorman for the
mile and 440 relay squads. The
anchorman is usally the fastest
speed demon the coach can find,
but not Wingo. His best anchor leg
isn't even the fastest on the
quartet. "His flat speed won't get
him across the street," says
Jordan. "Experience is the reason
he runs anchor. We try to insulate
our freshman. He has to carry the
load because of his experience.
The versatile sophomore hasn't
always been in that role though.
At Visalia's Mt. Whitney high
school â€” where he captained the
track squad for three years - he
was undefeated in the quarter
mile in his league for two straight

years. But when he arrived on the
Farm last year he found a
different story. "A lot of guys are
finding out that the Pac-8 isn't
like high school," says Jordan.
Wingo found his speciality, the
quarter mile, by accident. "I
always wanted to be a sprinter,"
says Wingo. "When I was a
freshman [in high school] I was
running in the 220 when the
coach asked me to run in the 440.
1 thought it was an eternity, but I
took the outside lane and ran a
52.8. I was on the mile relay team
from then on."
Wingo's high school coach,
former Stanford javelin star Hank
Roldan, probably influenced his
decision to come here more than
anyone else. "They're a lot like
each other," says Jordan.
"They're about the same size
|5-10] and they both have a lot
of the same personality traits.
Scott's quiet, but he's a leader.
The guys look up to him."
Unlike a lot of the people he
runs against, Wingo entered
Stanford through the front door.
He was the valedictorian of his
high school class and was very
interested in math.
"When I got here I wanted to
major in math-sciences. But I
decided to start the human bio
core. I'm interested in primate
behavior." Wingo works part-time
at the Primate Research Center,
following the progress of two
chimps.
He is also an active member of
the Theta Delts, serving as the
fraternity's rush chairman. "It's a
great house," says Wingo.
"Just like Stanford."
