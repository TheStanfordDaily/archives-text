# Lopez Campaign Stresses 'Good Times'
## 
### TERRY ANZUR Third of five parts 
Senior Mike Lopez and sophomore
ransfer Gary Cohen say the bottom
line of their campaign for ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) is "music
and good times."
The third man on the ticket is
Preston Dufauchard, a black freshman.
Lopez is a Chicano and Cohen is
Jewish.
"We looked around for a woman
who is into what we are into and
willing to put a lot of time into the
campaign. But we didn't find any until
after the deadline for submitting
petitions," Cohen told the Daily. *
Despite a lack of female
representation, Lopez says the slate
has received a formal endorsement
from Judith Garvey, a student body
vice-president at the University of San
Francisco. Lopez seriously believes
that endorsements from noted
musicians and rock groups, including
Journey, Santana, and Sons of
Champlin and Bob Weir of the
Grateful Dead, will arrive shortly.
Lopez, the campus representative
for Playboy Enterprises International,
says he is "in communication" with
Playboy about the possibility of
financial support for a theme house
dedicated "to the pursuit of
happiness."
Under the theme house proposal,
residents of different sexes would
share rooms. "But it wouldn't be a
Romper Room house or a sexual
gymnasium." Lopez says.
Cohen says Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton, the University's
housing czar, and his assistant, Karen
Murray, are aware of the theme house
plan. "We have to have a feasibility
study before the theme house can be
seriously considered by the
administration." Cohen says.
But an informal poll of about 100
students overwhelmingly support the
idea. Lopez adds.
"The house would de-emphasize
academics, but we don't want to fill it

with hard-core party goers," says
Cohen. "We wouldn't want people to
d'sr-'gard schoolwork. We want to
c/fn, something in addition to
schoolwork."
More Special Events
The Lopez slate hopes to
supplement academics with more
ASSU special events. "Music is a big
part of good times," Cohen says. "We
are investigating the possibility of
having a fulltime special events person
with one or two assistants."
Lope/ and Cohen believe that
profits from special events should be
returned to the students in the form of
free campus parties and concerts.
"Lake Lag in the fall is like Woodstock
without grass," Cohen points out. "It's
the perfect place for a campus wine
party."

Money should not be the ASSU's
main motive, says Lopez. "Under our
system there would be no need for a
fulltime financial manager. It's a
position that can be too easily
misused."
Varied Views
Lopez and his running mates say
they are running a "personally-orient
ed" campaign. They stress these
positions:
—on accessibility: Lopez hopes to
increase two-way communication
between the COP and students by
installing a hotline with the phone
number 497-ASSU. He also plans
regular COP columns in the Daily and
a talk show on KZSU twice a month.
—on SWOPSI-SCIRE: "Saving
SCIRE is one of the most important
things the ASSU can do." says Cohen.

"We support the efforts of leaders like
Alice Supton because they're in the
best position to know what is going
on."
—on the Administration: "If you
play the administration's game by
their |sic| rules, you can expect to
lose," says Lopez. "I don't want to
hold their jobs over their heads, but
they should be reminded that their
livelihood comes from students."
Students Who Care
Cohen says the main goal of the
Lopez slate is to create the kind of
student who will care what is going on.
"A student arrives here, sees the books
and the bookworms, and gets involved
in hard-core academics because it's the
only alternative," he says. "You can't
just go up to a bookworm and say,
'Hey, let's riot.' "

ASSU special events. "Music is a big
part of good times," Cohen says. "We
are investigating the possibility of
having a fulltime special events person
with one or two assistants."
Lope/ and Cohen believe that
profits from special events should be
returned to the students in the form of
free campus parties and concerts.
"Lake Lag in the fall is like Woodstock
without grass," Cohen points out. "It's
the perfect place for a campus wine
party."

Money should not be the ASSU's
main motive, says Lopez. "Under our
system there would be no need for a
fulltime financial manager. It's a
position that can be too easily
misused."
Varied Views
Lopez and his running mates say
they are running a "personally-orient
ed" campaign. They stress these
positions:
—on accessibility: Lopez hopes to
increase two-way communication
between the COP and students by
installing a hotline with the phone
number 497-ASSU. He also plans
regular COP columns in the Daily and
a talk show on KZSU twice a month.
—on SWOPSI-SCIRE: "Saving
SCIRE is one of the most important
things the ASSU can do." says Cohen.

"We support the efforts of leaders like
Alice Supton because they're in the
best position to know what is going
on."
—on the Administration: "If you
play the administration's game by
their |sic| rules, you can expect to
lose," says Lopez. "I don't want to
hold their jobs over their heads, but
they should be reminded that their
livelihood comes from students."
Students Who Care
Cohen says the main goal of the
Lopez slate is to create the kind of
student who will care what is going on.
"A student arrives here, sees the books
and the bookworms, and gets involved
in hard-core academics because it's the
only alternative," he says. "You can't
just go up to a bookworm and say,
'Hey, let's riot.' "

FOR THK GOOD TIMES—The slate of Gary Cohen, Preston Dufauchard and Mike Lopez plans a few new additions to
campus life, including free parties, an ASSU hotline, and a theme house dedicated to "the pursuit of happiness."
Senior Mike Lopez and sophomore
ransfer Gary Cohen say the bottom
line of their campaign for ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) is "music
and good times."
The third man on the ticket is
Preston Dufauchard, a black freshman.
Lopez is a Chicano and Cohen is
Jewish.
"We looked around for a woman
who is into what we are into and
willing to put a lot of time into the
campaign. But we didn't find any until
after the deadline for submitting
petitions," Cohen told the Daily. *
Despite a lack of female
representation, Lopez says the slate
has received a formal endorsement
from Judith Garvey, a student body
vice-president at the University of San
Francisco. Lopez seriously believes
that endorsements from noted
musicians and rock groups, including
Journey, Santana, and Sons of
Champlin and Bob Weir of the
Grateful Dead, will arrive shortly.
Lopez, the campus representative
for Playboy Enterprises International,
says he is "in communication" with
Playboy about the possibility of
financial support for a theme house
dedicated "to the pursuit of
happiness."
Under the theme house proposal,
residents of different sexes would
share rooms. "But it wouldn't be a
Romper Room house or a sexual
gymnasium." Lopez says.
Cohen says Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton, the University's
housing czar, and his assistant, Karen
Murray, are aware of the theme house
plan. "We have to have a feasibility
study before the theme house can be
seriously considered by the
administration." Cohen says.
But an informal poll of about 100
students overwhelmingly support the
idea. Lopez adds.
"The house would de-emphasize
academics, but we don't want to fill it

with hard-core party goers," says
Cohen. "We wouldn't want people to
d'sr-'gard schoolwork. We want to
c/fn, something in addition to
schoolwork."
More Special Events
The Lopez slate hopes to
supplement academics with more
ASSU special events. "Music is a big
part of good times," Cohen says. "We
are investigating the possibility of
having a fulltime special events person
with one or two assistants."

profits from special events should be
