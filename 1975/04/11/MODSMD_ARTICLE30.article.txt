## Netters Win Twice 
### RON PELLEGRINI 
By RON PELLEGRINI

SAN JOSE-Stanford's
defending NCAA Champion
tennis team extended its current
dual match win streak to 23 in a
row Wednesday by defeating a
tough San Jose State squad 8-1.
The lone loss at San Jose came
in the number one singles match
as John Whitlinger dropped a 6-3,
6-3 decision to SJS's Hank Pfister,
who is at this moment the best
player in college tennis.
The match was played at night
and indoors on what is usually the
floor of the men's gym, and the
slick surface made it nearly
impossible for "Whit" to return
Pfister's big serve. Breaking
Whitlinger's serve once in each set,
Pfister held his own service
throughout the match, in what
proved to spell the difference in
the end. Pfister has just come off
wins over the top amateur in the
country, UCLA's Billy Martin,
and USC's top player, Butch
Walts.
At the number two position,
Stanford's Nick Saviano defeated
Joe Meyers, 5-7, 7-6, 6-2, in the
comeback match of the night.
Down one set and 5-2 in the
second, Saviano came back to
take the second set in a
tiebreaker, and from then on, the
match was all his.
In what must be viewed as a
pleasant turn of events, the top
doubles team of Whitlinger
Delaney played an excellent
match, whipping the team of
Pfister-Meyers in straight sets, 6-4,
6-4. They played their best match
of the year, giving Coach Gould

added confidence in the strength
of his doubles teams.
Thursday afternoon, Foothill
Junior College came to Stanford,
and after having beaten four other
Pac-8 schools, dropped this one.
Mark Mitchell of Stanford
played in the number one position
and defeated the Owls' John
Hubbell, a solid player, 6-2, 5-7,
6-0. At number two, Craig
Johnson swept past Doug
Swallow, while Chip Fischer beat
Rory Frederico, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4. The
bottom three singles matches all
went to the Cards, with Jake
Warde, Tim Noonan and Alex
Cortes ail winning easily.
The tennis team meets Trinity
University today at 2:30 p.m. on
the varsity courts. Trinity is
considered one of the top five
teams nationally, and on
Wednesday downed Cal by a 6-3
score. Trinity has suffered only
one loss thie year, a 5-4 setback to
use.
If Stanford beats Trinity, the
dual match win streak will be
extended to 25 straight wins.

SAN JOSE-Stanford's
defending NCAA Champion
tennis team extended its current
dual match win streak to 23 in a
row Wednesday by defeating a
tough San Jose State squad 8-1.
The lone loss at San Jose came
in the number one singles match
as John Whitlinger dropped a 6-3,
6-3 decision to SJS's Hank Pfister,
who is at this moment the best
player in college tennis.
The match was played at night
and indoors on what is usually the
floor of the men's gym, and the
slick surface made it nearly
impossible for "Whit" to return
Pfister's big serve. Breaking
Whitlinger's serve once in each set,
Pfister held his own service
throughout the match, in what
proved to spell the difference in
the end. Pfister has just come off
wins over the top amateur in the
country, UCLA's Billy Martin,
and USC's top player, Butch
Walts.
At the number two position,
Stanford's Nick Saviano defeated
Joe Meyers, 5-7, 7-6, 6-2, in the
comeback match of the night.
Down one set and 5-2 in the
second, Saviano came back to
take the second set in a
tiebreaker, and from then on, the
match was all his.
In what must be viewed as a
pleasant turn of events, the top
doubles team of Whitlinger
Delaney played an excellent
match, whipping the team of
Pfister-Meyers in straight sets, 6-4,
6-4. They played their best match
of the year, giving Coach Gould

added confidence in the strength
of his doubles teams.
Thursday afternoon, Foothill
Junior College came to Stanford,
and after having beaten four other
Pac-8 schools, dropped this one.
Mark Mitchell of Stanford
played in the number one position
and defeated the Owls' John
Hubbell, a solid player, 6-2, 5-7,
6-0. At number two, Craig
Johnson swept past Doug
Swallow, while Chip Fischer beat
Rory Frederico, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4. The
