# Batters Win With Ninth-Inning Rally
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Two innings into Wednesday's
varaty baseball game Stanford Coach
Ray Young, hands on hips, stared
out at the diamond.
"Come on, men," he said. "I
saw this game yesterday."
The Cards had allowed two
runs on two bungles — a throwing
error by rightfielder Bruce
Robinson, and a wild pitch by
lefty John Yandle. For three
innings it really was reminiscent
of the previous day's somewhat
sloppy victory over Hayward
State.
But, with the help of some
shutout pitching by sophomore
.Jim Scharffenberger and some
clutch hitting in the last inning,
the Cards defeated San Francisco
State 3-2, pushing their record to
22-14 and giving them some
momentum for an impending
series with defending NCAA
champion USC.
Yandle was a surprise starter
for Stanford — Scharffenberger
had been slated to go the full nine
but Young decided to give
Yandle, who will pitch the
nightcap of Saturday's Trojan
doubleheader, a little work.
He got it in the first inning
when the Gators' leadoff batter,
Grant Becker, singled to center.
Becker went to second on a balk,
and reached third on a single by
Larry Cristiani, the number-two
man in the order.
Yandle went three innings,
and struck out four, before
Scharffenberger came in.

Scharffenberger, now 2-2 for
the season, pitched all six
remaining innings, holding the
Gators scoreless.
Ah, but the excitement came
in Stanford's half of the ninth.
Shortstop Steve Davis, in his
one at-bat of the game, led off the
inning with a towering 390-foot
home run to tie the game at 3-3.
It was only the Cardinals' fourth
hit.
Then Bob Hampton walked,
stole second, and went to third on
a wild pitch. The Gators, looking
for the easy force or double play,
walked second baseman Joe
Lamoure and Perez, who had been
moved to left, to load the bases.
Catcher Dave Baker took three
straight balls, and then a wild
pitch allowed Hampton to score
the winning run.
And now the Cards go south
for what could be the most crucial
series of the Pac-8 season. Last
year Stanford took five of six
games from the Trojans.
This year, at 20-7, the Trojans
have five pitchers with ERAs
below 2.00. And a guy batting
.396.
But Stanford leads the Pac-8
with a 2-1 record. And that, for
now, makes it the team to beat.
