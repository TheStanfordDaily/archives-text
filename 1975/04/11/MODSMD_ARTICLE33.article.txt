## Pinstripes Are In Again 
### Dan Pyne 
It's suicide to write about the New York Yankees.
There are just too many Yankees fanatics.
But I'm going to do it anyway.
Because I'm stubborn. And because I'm from Denver
and no one wants to hear about the Bears. And because I
want to save my World Series winner for next week. And
because I think the Yanks are going to win the American
League.
Let me set the lineup:
At first base is hard-hitting Chris Chambliss, acquired
from the Cleveland Indians last year. Backing him up are
Ron Blomberg, the designated hitter who hit .300 last year,
and Roy White, a switch-hitting left fielder moved to first.
At the keystone is Sandy Alomar, a "spray hitter"
acquired from California last year.
At shortstop is Jim Mason, acquired from the Texas
Rangers last year.
Denver Bears??
At third is Graig Nettles, an ex-Denver Bear wearing
number nine (which was also worn by a kid named Maris).
Behind the plate is Thurman Munson, a stocky catcher
who is a toss-up with Carlton Fisk for the title of Best
Catcher In The AL.
In left field is White or Lou Piniella, an ex-Kansas City
Royal who hit .302 last year.
In centerfield is Elliott Maddox, who hit .311 to lead
all Yankee hitters last year.
On the mound are Pat Dobson, a 19-game winner last

year, George "Doc" Medich, a 19-game winner last year.
Rudy May, ace reliever Sparky Lyle, Larry C.ura, and Mike
Wallace.
Not a bad battery.
But there's more. This year the Yankees pulled two
people out of the Bay Area. They could aid a
pennant-winning drive, or they could help to make a lot of
people upset.
Bonds-Murcer?
In rightfield, from the San Francisco Giants, is Bobby
Bonds, swapped one-for-one for Bobby Murcer. Bonds,
like Murcer, will carry- the weight of a tradition on his
shoulders. The tradition of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and
Mickey Mantle. Murcer didn't get along with the
management, he said he couldn't hit in Shea Stadium, and
had a pretty rotten season last year. But, a favorite of
Yankee fans, he leaves big shoes to fill.
And on the mound, from the World Champion Oakland
As, Jim "Catfish" Hunter, the last American League
pitcher to hurl a perfect game. Hunter has been good in
the past, and he should be good again.
Yankee pitching should be strong, with Hunter,
Dobson, Medich and May in starting rotation. In the
bullpen it would be nice if Sparky Lyle returned to his
1973 form, but Gura and Wallace were 11-1 in the stretch
last year which indicates a bit of depth.
At the plate there's room for improvement. Nettles set
a record for home runs last April with 11, then slumped

for half the season. Munson had a bad year hitting, as did
White. But management picked up people like Alex
Johnson and Bob Oliver and Ed Herrman with the hope of
adding some extra slugging, and chances are pretty good
that Nettles and Munson will do better.
As for the choke, for which the Yankees have become
famous, well, they say maturity helps. After all, the
Dodgers choked in the stretch a couple times.
Shea Stadium?
In addition, the Yankees will be playing at Shea
Stadium while Yankee Stadium is rebuilt, which will be
good news for pitchers. Shea is dusty, and right next to an
airport. Not a hitters' park.. An asset and a detriment.
And, of course. Bill Virdon, the man who took the
Yankees from fourth place and made them a contender
last year, will be back.
Virdon, an ex-Pittsburgh Pirate, was the player who, in
the 1960 World Series between Pittsburgh and New York,
with the championship tied 3-3 in games hit the ground
ball to short that hit Tony Kubek in the neck and more or
less set the stage for Bill Mazerowski's ninth-inning homer
that lifted the Pirates past the Yankees for the
Championship of the world.
But he's the manager now.
Look for the Yankees to win the American League. But
don't plan on them winning the Series.
