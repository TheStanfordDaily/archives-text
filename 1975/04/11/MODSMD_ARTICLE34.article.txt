Coed Court Stars
The women netters downed
San Francisco St. on Wednesday,
7-0. No one lost a set in the
whitewash and the team as a
whole only gave up a total of 17
games to the Gaters.
The Cards were particularly
stingy in doubles absolutely
destroying the San Francisco
pairs.
The women take on Fresno St.
today on the Lagunita Courts at
10 a.m. Admission is free.

Singles: Andrea Barnes d. Tanya

Golf
Pat Cornett, Stanford's leading
women's golpher and the winner
of both the San Francisco City
and Sun Devil Intercollegiate
Invitational golf tournaments, will
vie for another title on Monday

and Tuesday.
Cornett, and junior Pam
Palmieri, head south to play in the
13th annual California Women's
Collegiate Championship
Invitational at the California
Country Club in Whittier.
Palmieri and Cornett combined
to win the team title at Scottsdale
last weekend.
Coach Carol Diaz says "there
will be a lot more girls entered in
this Invitational, however, the fact
that they will be playing in
California rather than Arizona will
make it easier for them.
Among the schools entered are
Cal State-Los Angeles, San Diego
State, San Jose State, UCLA, New
Mexico, Santa Clara, University of
British Columbia, Oregon and
Texas-El Paso.

Crew
The Stanford Crew journeys
tomorrow to exotic Eugene for a
crucial race against Oregon,
Oregon State and Santa Clara.
Oregon State, a strong fourth
place finisher at last year's
Western Sprints, looms as the
team to beat. Oregon, a team
which Stanford narrowly defeated
last season, also promises to pose
a stiff challenge to the Card crew.
Following last week's painful
photo-finish loss to USC, Coach
Dick Dreisengackker spent a busy
week shuffling his varsity and JV
lineups trying to find a faster
combination. How successful he
was will be reflected tomorrow in
a must win race if the Stanford
oarsmen are to entertain any hope
of mounting a strong bid for a top
spot on the coast.

Even if victorious the crew will
face its toughest challenge on the
trek home. Last year the infamous
"Siskiyou Seven" didn't quite
make it and spent Easter weekend
in the county jail for pilfering
roadsigns and other Stanfordish
antics. Hopefully this weekend
will be more successful — all the
way around.

IM Roundup
The IM Canoe Race, the first
big intramural event of the spring,
will get under way Sunday at
noon as part of the Aquafollies,

organizers said this week. The race
will be as last year, with
two-person teams racing their
canoes around the semi-triangular
course. To compete, each living
group must pay the Aquafollies
entry fee-donation.
Entries tentatively will be
expanded to two boats per living
group, but only one (to be
designated before the race) may
count for intramural points.
Anyone still wishing to enter
teams in any sports should
contact the 1M office today.
