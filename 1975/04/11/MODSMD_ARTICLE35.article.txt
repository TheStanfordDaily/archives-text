ford: Send SI Billion Aid To Vietnam
WASHINGTON — President Ford asked Congress last
night for nearly $1 billion in emergency military and
economic aid for South Vietnam and for clear authority to
use U.S. military forces to evacuate Americans, if necessary.
In a nationally televised "State of the World" address
to a joint congressional session, Ford asked for no
additional aid to Cambodia beyond the $222 million he
already has requested.
However, he called for Congress to provide "without
delay $722 million in additional military hardware" for
Saigon and requested an initial $250 million in economic
and humanitarian assistance.
Ford's aid request ran immediately into opposition from
congressional leaders.
Saigon: 400 Enemy Dead in 2 Days
SAIGON — The Saigon command claimed today that nx>re
than 400 Communist-led troops were killed in the first two
days of battle for Xuan Loc, 40 miles east of here
Scattered action was reported early today around the
provincial capital, whose defense is considered a key test of
South Vietnam's fighting capacity.
In Cambodia, insurgents drove to within two miles of

Phnom Penh airport, their deepest penetration ever, field
reports said.
No resumption was reported of the heavy rocket and
artillery assaults employed Wednesday and yesterday in the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong assault on Xuan Loc.
300 Orphans To Leave S.E. Asia Toda\
SAIGON — More than 300 Indochina orphans are
scheduled to leave Saigon and Phnom Penh today for
homes in the United States, thanks in part to an American
woman who vowed: "I am not going to let the Communists
have these children."
The woman, Betty Tisdale of Columbus, Ga., told
newsmen in Saigon yesterday that Deputy Premier Phan
Quang Dan gave permission for two planeloads of
Vietnamese children to be airlifted to the U.S. West Coast.
Government Rests ( onnallv Case
WASHINGTON — The government rested its case
yesterday in the John Connally bribery trial.
Prosecutors called a total of 36 witnesses before resting
their case in the seventh day of the trial. Only one of the
witnesses testified that Connally took the two $5000
payoffs he is accused of accepting.
All the other witnesses gave testimony or authenticated
documents to present what the prosecutors hope will be a
mass of circumstantial evidence supporting the story of
their star witness, Jake Jacobsen.
Senate Passes Energy Legislation
WASHINGTON — A bill giving federal and state officials
broad powers to force Americans to save energy without
paying the higher prices advocated by President Ford was
passed by the Senate yesterday.
The measure, still subject to House consideration, would
virtually kill Ford's own conservation program by allowing
either house of Congress to block his plans for removing
federal controls from oil prices.
Ford has indicated he will attempt to remove the
controls next month in an effort to force energy
conservation. Opponents say such action would raise fuel
costs $19 billion a year.
Athlete Shinniek Won't Diseuss Hearst
SAN FRANCISCO — Former Olympic athlete Phillip
Shinniek refused yesterday to answer questions from a
special grand jury probing the Patricia Hearst case, while in
Pennsylvania a government attorney indicated that sports
figure Jack Scott would be subpoenaed there.
Basketball star Bill Walton, a friend of Scott's, expressed
support for Shinniek.

passed by the Senate yesterday.
The measure, still subject to House consideration, would
virtually kill Ford's own conservation program by allowing
either house of Congress to block his plans for removing
federal controls from oil prices.
Ford has indicated he will attempt to remove the
controls next month in an effort to force energy
conservation. Opponents say such action would raise fuel
costs $19 billion a year.

and humanitarian assistance.
