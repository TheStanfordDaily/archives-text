# Olivieri: Vote 'No' On PIRG
##

By DAN FIDUCCIA

ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri said yesterday that he was
opposed to the student fee assessments
for the Northern California Public
Research Group (PIRG) and the
Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO).
Olivieri said "right on" to
yesterday's Daily editorials opposing
PIRG and ARLO.
These two assessments are part of
10 assessments which, if all passed,
would cost each student $17 next year
and would bring in $195,000 in
revenues.
Olivieri also commented that a $2
assessment for the Stanford Band
would provide it with more revenue
than it will actually need. He said the
Band's expenditures would be covered
by $1.50 of its assessment. Thus,
Olivieri said, the student body would
be giving the Band $5750 in extra
funds.
Olivieri would not comment on the
rest of the assessments.
Olivieri said on KZSU yesterday
morning that "the students should
look at what each particular group's
(assessment's) impact will be to them.
If there's no payoff to the students,
then they should vote against it."

Olivieri said that students
should consider the benefits and
membership of an organization along
with judging "if the visibility and
input serves the overall Stanford
community."
Olivieri also wants the student body
to be especially careful in evaluating
multi-dollar fee assessments. Olivieri
said that "when voting on a $2 or $3
assessment, some students feel that an
organization's service is important but
they don't want to pay the full $2 or
$3. When confronted with the choice

of either losing the service or spending
the money, students usually vote in
favor of the assessment.
"However, the rejection of a fee
assessment opens up the possibility of
resubmitting the assessment for a
lower amount. The organization could
submit the lower amount to the ASSU
Senate in October. If students don't
want to pay for the full fee
assessment, they should make it clear
to that organization that its request is
excessive," Olivieri said.
