NorCal PIRG has lobbied for such
measures as liberal marijuana laws and
mandatory posted prices for gasoline.
It is also working for the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative and its staffers
have testified before the Federal Trade
Commission.
The group recently distributed a
pamphlet describing the results of
surveys of consumer prices in the
midpeninsula. However the Daily
found that its gasoline survey had
missed three of the cheapest stations
in the area: Beacon, Hudson, and
Fill-Em-Fast. Lowery could not
explain this omission.
Speakers Bureau
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is
seeking a $1 fee assessment to
continue its acitivities next year.
The Bureau sponsored or
co-sponsored more than 13 speakers
this year, including Dick Gregory,
Sargent Shriver, Frances "Sissy"
Farenthold, Erica Jong, Rusty Rhodes,
and Gene Roddenbery. During the
first week of May, it will hold a
symposium on crime and prisons, and
on May 21, Julian Bond will speak.
For next year the Bureau has
received commitments from Harvard
economist John Kenneth Galbraith
and Frances Fitzgerald, author of Fire
in the Lake. It-is also contacting Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), columnist
William Buckley, United Auto Workers
Union leader Leonard Woodcock,
Chief Justice Warren Burger, film
maker Francis Ford Coppola and
author Kurt Vonnegut for possible
appearances.
Responding to complaints that the

Bureau has not sponsored any
conservative speakers this year,
Director Andy Leuchter said, "The
reason we have had problems with
balance was bad luck." He said such
conservatives as Buckley, Sen. Barry
Goldwater (R-Ariz.) and National
Review publisher William Rusher had
been contacted, but that all of them
claimed scheduling problems or had
requested higher fees than the Board
was willing to pay.
