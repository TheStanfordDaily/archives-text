# Union Election Turnout Heavy Despite Boycott
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Voting yesterday in the Stanford
Hospital employees' union election
was heavy even though the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union had
urged its members to boycott the
polls.
Both John Schwartz, counsel for
Medical Affairs at the Hospital, and
Jim Berk. USE president, agreed that a
large number of people voted on the
first day of the election, which
continues through Saturday.
"Not very many people seem
willing to boycott the election,
although some of them may be casting
blank ballots," Berk told the Daily. "A
number of union members have told
me that they worked too long and too
hard in preparing for this election to
be willing to boycott it now."
Berk urged workers to boycott the
election after filing a grievance charge
with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB). Berk claimed that
Hospital officials had pressured
employees into voting against the
union and had started a heavy-handed
propaganda campaign to smear the
union.
Schwartz said yesterday that Berk's
charges are "absurd" and expressed
confidence that the NLRB will absolve
the Hospital of having committed any
unfair practices.

Berk noted that USE will continue
to encourage the boycott despite the
high voter turnout.
Berk emphasized that USE opposes
conducting the election at this time
only because of what he called the
Hospital's unfair tactics. He insisted
that USE didn't call the boycott out
of fear that workers would vote to
oppose representation by USE.
If elections had been conducted
without the call for a boycott, workers
would probably have opted for union
representation by a small majority.
Berk contended.
1600 To Vote
Approximately 1000 Hospital and
Clinic employees in six categories are
expected to vote in the election.
The largest group consists of 1000
service, technical and patient care
employees who will vote for
representation by Engineers and
Scientists of California, USE or no
union at all.
About 200 allied health
professionals will choose between
representation by the Stanford United
Medical Technologists, USE or no
union.
Vote By Mail
Some 360 eligible interns and
residents are voting by mail to
determine whether they should remain
without representation or be

represented by the Stanford
Housestaff Association in negotiations
lor salaries, fringe benefits and
working conditions.
Originally. 80 maintenance
employees were scheduled to vote to
decide whether to remain with the
Stanford Medical Center Engineering
Department Association or to affiliate
with USE.
But the Association this week
received permission from the NLRB to
withdraw its petition for election.

Approximately 1000 Hospital and
Clinic employees in six categories are
expected to vote in the election.
The largest group consists of 1000
service, technical and patient care
employees who will vote for
representation by Engineers and
Scientists of California, USE or no
union at all.
About 200 allied health
professionals will choose between
representation by the Stanford United
Medical Technologists, USE or no
union.
Vote By Mail
Some 360 eligible interns and
residents are voting by mail to
determine whether they should remain
without representation or be

represented by the Stanford
Housestaff Association in negotiations
lor salaries, fringe benefits and
working conditions.
Originally. 80 maintenance
employees were scheduled to vote to
decide whether to remain with the
Stanford Medical Center Engineering
Department Association or to affiliate
with USE.
But the Association this week
received permission from the NLRB to
withdraw its petition for election.
Voting yesterday in the Stanford
Hospital employees' union election
was heavy even though the United
Stanford Employees (USE) union had
urged its members to boycott the
polls.
Both John Schwartz, counsel for
Medical Affairs at the Hospital, and
Jim Berk. USE president, agreed that a
large number of people voted on the
first day of the election, which
continues through Saturday.
"Not very many people seem
willing to boycott the election,
although some of them may be casting
blank ballots," Berk told the Daily. "A
number of union members have told
me that they worked too long and too
hard in preparing for this election to
be willing to boycott it now."
Berk urged workers to boycott the
election after filing a grievance charge
with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB). Berk claimed that
Hospital officials had pressured
employees into voting against the
union and had started a heavy-handed
propaganda campaign to smear the
union.
Schwartz said yesterday that Berk's
charges are "absurd" and expressed
confidence that the NLRB will absolve
the Hospital of having committed any
unfair practices.

Berk noted that USE will continue
to encourage the boycott despite the
high voter turnout.
Berk emphasized that USE opposes
conducting the election at this time
only because of what he called the
Hospital's unfair tactics. He insisted
that USE didn't call the boycott out
of fear that workers would vote to
oppose representation by USE.
If elections had been conducted
without the call for a boycott, workers
would probably have opted for union
representation by a small majority.
Berk contended.
