# Program Fee Reallocated By Senate
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The ASSU Senate, in a long
marathon session lasting until 5:15
yesterday morning, pared the
requested allocation lor the ASSU
program fee assessment from almost
$85,000 to $11,500.
Among the largest cuts made were
those in allocations for the Black
Student Union, from $10,316 to some
$1593; MEChA, from $5733 to
$1000; (Stanford) Debate, from
$4381 to $100; and the International
Association, from $1000 to $80.
In addition, the Senate voted to
recommend no money for the nine
publications requesting funds. These
groups originally had asked for
allocations totaling $12,130.
The Senate acted upon the
recommendations of ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri in deciding the
final funding.
One of the most controversial
assessment decisions was that denying
the ASSU Course Review any funds.
The Course Review originally had
requested $2000.
Gray Opposed
ASSU Sen. Chris Gray, one of the
leaders of a Senate contingent which
helped defeat the allocation, said that
the group's reasoning was twofold.
"The Course Review has a good
deal of potential." explained Cray,
"but as it is run now, it is a miserable
failure."
He noted that only about 17
percent of the student body received
copies last year, and most of those
were purchased by the administration.
Would Force Cut
Gray also said that in order to
honor the Course Review's request, it
would have been necessary to reduce
the program fee's other allocation by
9.8 percent.
"It would be madness to give these
same people, who failed so miserably,
funds," he continued, 'in the Senate,
it was almost unanimous that we
shouldn't give them money."
Gray stated that the ASSU is very
interested in reforming the present
Course Review, but that it is unwilling
to allocate funds for the current
"mediocre to poor" publication.
Service Not Publication
ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott, one
of a small minority which voted for
the Course Review allocation, said he
supported the measure on the grounds
"that it should be funded by the
program funds as it is a service and not
a publication."
McDermott expressed displeasure

indicated that he would support the
Senate's action.

requested allocation lor the ASSU
program fee assessment from almost
$85,000 to $11,500.
Among the largest cuts made were
those in allocations for the Black
Student Union, from $10,316 to some
$1593; MEChA, from $5733 to
$1000; (Stanford) Debate, from
$4381 to $100; and the International
Association, from $1000 to $80.
In addition, the Senate voted to
recommend no money for the nine
publications requesting funds. These
groups originally had asked for
allocations totaling $12,130.
The Senate acted upon the
recommendations of ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri in deciding the
final funding.
One of the most controversial
assessment decisions was that denying
the ASSU Course Review any funds.
The Course Review originally had
requested $2000.
Gray Opposed
ASSU Sen. Chris Gray, one of the
leaders of a Senate contingent which
helped defeat the allocation, said that
the group's reasoning was twofold.
"The Course Review has a good
deal of potential." explained Cray,
"but as it is run now, it is a miserable
failure."
He noted that only about 17
percent of the student body received
copies last year, and most of those
were purchased by the administration.
Would Force Cut
Gray also said that in order to
honor the Course Review's request, it
would have been necessary to reduce
the program fee's other allocation by
9.8 percent.
"It would be madness to give these
same people, who failed so miserably,
funds," he continued, 'in the Senate,
it was almost unanimous that we
shouldn't give them money."
Gray stated that the ASSU is very
interested in reforming the present
Course Review, but that it is unwilling
to allocate funds for the current
"mediocre to poor" publication.
Service Not Publication
ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott, one
of a small minority which voted for
the Course Review allocation, said he
supported the measure on the grounds
"that it should be funded by the
program funds as it is a service and not
a publication."
McDermott expressed displeasure
with the results of the meeting, but
indicated that he would support the
Senate's action.
