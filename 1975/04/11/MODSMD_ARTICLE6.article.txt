In i. manner similar to its
on-the-field performances, the
Stanford Band has been marching in
two directions during its current
student fee assessment campaign. The
Band had its fee assessment qualified
for next week's ballot twice. And to
further complicate matters, the
measure was accepted both as a $1 and
a $2 assessment.
Band Manager William Wick said
the Band had decided earlier this year
to petition for the placement of a $2
assessment on next week s ballot. And
according to Elections Commissioner
Tom Fitzgerald, they collected
sufficient signatures.
But meanwhile, a Band board
member had spoken to ASSU Sen.
Kevin McDermott, who agreed that it
would be easier to have the Senate
place the measure on the ballot.
The Senate did so, but a
misunderstanding led to passage of the
measure as a $1 assessment.
Fitzgerald, respecting the Band's
wishes and the fact that the assessment
qualified by petition first, has
officially determined that next week's
vote will be on a $2, not a $1,
assessment.
Eastern Trips
The $2 fee assessment would be
used to perform a trip to the Penn
State and Michigan football games this
fall, part of the costs of a repeat trip
to Oregon and possibly additional trips
the following year.
In previous years the Band has
requested only $1. Next year, for the
first time, the Band will be attending
two Eastern games rather than the
usual one.
Wick said the fee would "let people
in the East see what Stanford is like.

Many think that Stanford is Harvard
or Yale in the West. The Band shows
the loose style of the University .. .
and the team really enjoys it." ,'
Wirk said that after previous trips,
the Band and University President
Richard Lyman had received many
complimentary' letters from alumni.
He admitted, however, that some
alumni had intensely disliked the
freewheeling Band.
NorCal PIRG
Also seeking an assessment is the
Northern California Public Interest
Research Group (NorCal PIRG),
founded last spring. As it did
successfully then, PIRG seeks a $1
assessment to fund its activities.
The University of Santa Clara and
Stanford, the two member schools of
NorCal PIRG, each contribute about
$10,000 to the group.
The Stanford chapter is operated
by a board elected by the Stanford
student volunteers who work for
NorCal PIRG.
Nader Not Responsible
Ann Lowery, co-president of the
board, says that though "Ralph Nader
gave inspiration to the group, he
doesn't want to be responsible for it."
She insisted that the students do
control the organization,
NorCal PIRG employs two fulltime
staff members who receive 75 percent
of the organization's budget.
Lowery said that students do not
fill these posts because the staff
members are registered lobbyists who
need an open schedule to travel to
Washington and Sacramento.
'Needs Fulltimers'
She claimed that in order for
NorCal PIRG to be fully effective, it
needs the "full time assistance and
dedication of a professional staff."

for next week's ballot twice. And to
further complicate matters, the
measure was accepted both as a $1 and
a $2 assessment.
Band Manager William Wick said
the Band had decided earlier this year
to petition for the placement of a $2
assessment on next week s ballot. And
according to Elections Commissioner
Tom Fitzgerald, they collected
sufficient signatures.
But meanwhile, a Band board
member had spoken to ASSU Sen.
Kevin McDermott, who agreed that it
would be easier to have the Senate
place the measure on the ballot.
The Senate did so, but a
misunderstanding led to passage of the
measure as a $1 assessment.
Fitzgerald, respecting the Band's
wishes and the fact that the assessment
qualified by petition first, has
officially determined that next week's
vote will be on a $2, not a $1,
assessment.
Eastern Trips
The $2 fee assessment would be
used to perform a trip to the Penn
State and Michigan football games this
fall, part of the costs of a repeat trip
to Oregon and possibly additional trips
the following year.
In previous years the Band has
requested only $1. Next year, for the
first time, the Band will be attending
two Eastern games rather than the
usual one.
Wick said the fee would "let people
in the East see what Stanford is like.

Many think that Stanford is Harvard
or Yale in the West. The Band shows
the loose style of the University .. .
and the team really enjoys it." ,'
Wirk said that after previous trips,
the Band and University President
Richard Lyman had received many
complimentary' letters from alumni.
He admitted, however, that some
alumni had intensely disliked the
freewheeling Band.
NorCal PIRG
Also seeking an assessment is the
Northern California Public Interest
Research Group (NorCal PIRG),
founded last spring. As it did
successfully then, PIRG seeks a $1
assessment to fund its activities.
The University of Santa Clara and
Stanford, the two member schools of
NorCal PIRG, each contribute about
$10,000 to the group.
The Stanford chapter is operated
by a board elected by the Stanford
student volunteers who work for
NorCal PIRG.
Nader Not Responsible
Ann Lowery, co-president of the
board, says that though "Ralph Nader
gave inspiration to the group, he
doesn't want to be responsible for it."
She insisted that the students do
control the organization,
NorCal PIRG employs two fulltime
staff members who receive 75 percent
of the organization's budget.
Lowery said that students do not
fill these posts because the staff
members are registered lobbyists who
need an open schedule to travel to
Washington and Sacramento.
'Needs Fulltimers'
She claimed that in order for
NorCal PIRG to be fully effective, it
needs the "full time assistance and
dedication of a professional staff."
