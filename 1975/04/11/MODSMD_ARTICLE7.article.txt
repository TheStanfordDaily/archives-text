Financial Manager-No
We recommend a NO vote on the proposed ASSU
Constitutional Amendment which would allow the ASSU to
hire a full-time financial manager.
We oppose the plan on the grounds that hiring a full-time
financial manager would not be worth the additional cost of
at least $11,000 annually, an amount which cannot be easily
raised at a time when the University is slashing the ASSU
budget.
A full-time manager would also be more likely than a
student to propose that the ASSU enter even more costly
business ventures. We deplore the current trend toward "big
bucks" in the ASSU.
Pub Board-Yes
We recommend a YES vote on the $2 fee assessment
requested by the ASSU Publications Board.
The Pub Board uses its money to finance smaller
publications on the campus. In the past year, nine
publications, including the Chaparral, Live Oak and the
Stanford Review, have received funds from the Pub Board.
The financial realities of publishing today, with printing
costs skyrocketing and the amount of money businesses can
spend on advertising dropping, indicate that the Stanford
market simply cannot afford a number of
advertising-supported publications.
With the Daily gobbling up most of the advertising
dollars, it is obvious that forcing smaller publications to
subsist on advertising alone would kill many of them. We
think this would be a substantial loss to the community.
Parking Lawsuit-No
We recommend a NO vote on the $1 fee assessment
requested by the ASSU Senate and Escondido Village
Council to finance their parking fee lawsuit against the
University.
We have stated several times that students are merely
throwing their money away by financing a suit which has
little chance to win against well-armed University lawyers,
and probably would not even have a chance of winning for
several years.
In addition, the parking suit may now be moot, since the
University is now in the process of formulating an entirely
new parking fee structure. While this structure might well
only intensify the disadvantages of the existing one, we
think students should wait to find out exactly what plan
they are suing before financing this undertaking.
The ASSU Senate will consider rescinding the fee
assessment and withdrawing the lawsuit Monday night. We
hope the Senate does so, but if it does not, we urge students
to reject this assessment.
Speakers Bureau-Yes
We recommend a YES vote on the $2 fee assessment
requested by the ASSU Speakers Bureau.
The Speakers Bureau has been active this year in bringing
such persons as R. Sargent Shriver, Dr. Michael De√üakey,
Gene Roddenberry and Dick Gregory to campus, and
providing a guest-in-residence program so that students can
interact closely with prominent persons.
The Bureau's program for next year has not yet been
finalized, but the list of projected invitees is closely
correlated with the results of surveys asking which speakers
students would like to hear.
While we endorse the assessment, we do hope that the
Bureau invites more conservative speakers than it has done
in the past. The Bureau has a responsibility to bring to
campus persons representing a broad spectrum of views.
Legal Counseling-Yes
We recommend a YES vote on the $2 fee assessment ($1
of which will be collected during summer quarter) requested
by the ASSU Legal Counseling Office (LCO).
Since its inception in October, 1973, the LCO has
received over 1400 students seeking legal advice on a wide
variety of cases. Without the LCO, these students would
have been forced to pay for an attorney merely to get legal
advice.
The LCO serves only students, and is entirely funded
through fee assessments. In reviewing LCO's budget, we find
the proposed $2 figure justified, and LCO worthy of
continued support.
Fee Vofe Change-No
We recommend a NO vote on the proposed ASSU
Constitutional Amendment which would allow fee
assessments to be passed if 10 percent of the student body
votes in their favor and the number of yes votes exceeds the
number of no votes.
Last autumn, we pointed out the inequity of the current
system, which requires that at least 20 percent of the
student body vote in either direction at fee assessment
elections in order for an assessment to pass. Under this
current system, a proposal passes if 11 percent of the
student body votes yes and 10 percent votes no, but fails if
19 percent votes yes and no one votes no.
At that time, we suggested that fee assessments pass only
if at least 15 percent of the student body votes in their
favor. While the ASSU is now proposing that this method be
adopted, it set the figure at only 10 percent.
We think that this figure is too low to adequately guard
students against the dangers of fee assessments ratified by
only a few persons. We urge rejection of the proposed
amendment, and drafting of a new amendment which would
incorporate a 15 percent figure.
