# Viets Flee Violence, Not Communism
## 
### Susan Luttner 
In the turmoil of Southeast Asia, the most
tragic victims have been the people living in
contested areas. Refugees, are now seen
nightly on American television, finally
leaving their homes and crops for the
uncertainties and hardships of refugee camps.
The media have casually reported the U.S.
military's interpretation of the mass
relocations: the peasants are "voting with
their feet" and "fleeing from Communism."
As the refugee question re-emerged with
the latest Communist advances, this
explanation at first seemed plausible.
In the 30 years of war in Vietnam, the
people have been the objects of intensive
anti-Communist propaganda campaigns. Jane
Barton, who worked for the American
Friends Service Committee in Vietnam, said
here last quarter that peasants with no clear
political bias often fear Communists because
of horror stories spread by
the U.S. and South Vietnamese governments.
The people could also be afraid of the
"bloodbaths" predicted by President Ford
and military advisers in Southeast Asia. In
almost any military takeover, those who
assume power will imprison or execute those
who were part of the previous power
structure.
But then, a short article in the New York
Times on March 26 began to break down the
myth that fleeing refugees are leaving because
they prefer Thieu's government to the
Communists.
A reporter who asked hundred of refugees
why they were leaving wrote, "Not one said

it was because he or she feared or hated
Communism .... 'Because every one else is
going,' was a typical reply."

He quoted one peasant woman who had
lost her family in a bombing raid by U.S.
pilots in 1968. She said that it would be
"better to go to the Saigon side because the
Communists have no airplanes."
In a special report on Vietnam this week,
CBS explained the evacuations as a mass
reaction to the departure of the military. As
early as February, when Thieu began
withdrawing troops from the central
highlands, peasants began to leave because
they felt the areas must be unsafe.
Ed Block, a former official of the Agency
for International Development in Vietnam,
offered an even more convincing
explanation: fear of being caught in reprisals
by South Vietnamese troops after the
Communists take over.
In an article written last fall, Block
described the strategies employed in 1972 at
Quang Tri when the Provisional
Revolutionary Government and North

Vietnamese gained military control. South
Vietnam withdrew its troops and ordered all
civilians to evacuate. They then assumed that
anyone who stayed was a "Viet Cong
sympathizer" and bombed the city, killing
more than 25,000 civilians.
Those who escaped, according to Block,
were not running from the Communists but
from the Saigon military. The Red Cross
director at Quang Tri reported that many
people from his province "firmly believe that
the Americans are attempting to commit
genocide in Vietnam," Block wrote.
The history of the war in Vietnam is
replete with similar instances at Hue, Ban Me
Thout, Pleiku Kontum and other areas which
have been controlled alternately by Saigon
and Hanoi. Once an area is under the control
of North Vietnam, it becomes a target for
bombings whether it is a military base or not.
A significant proportion of the refugees
probably are leaving because they prefer a
capitalist economy to Communist control,
especially the first evacuees: families of
officials and South Vietnamese military
personnel.
But the mass exodus now going on as
North Vietnamese forces advance cannot be
attributed solely to a dislike of Communism.
Peasants also fear that their villages will
become either open battle zones or targets
for South Vietnamese bombs.

sympathizer" and bombed the city, killing
more than 25,000 civilians.
Those who escaped, according to Block,
were not running from the Communists but
from the Saigon military. The Red Cross
director at Quang Tri reported that many
people from his province "firmly believe that
the Americans are attempting to commit
genocide in Vietnam," Block wrote.
The history of the war in Vietnam is
replete with similar instances at Hue, Ban Me
Thout, Pleiku Kontum and other areas which
have been controlled alternately by Saigon
and Hanoi. Once an area is under the control
of North Vietnam, it becomes a target for
bombings whether it is a military base or not.
A significant proportion of the refugees
probably are leaving because they prefer a
capitalist economy to Communist control,
especially the first evacuees: families of
officials and South Vietnamese military
personnel.
But the mass exodus now going on as
North Vietnamese forces advance cannot be
attributed solely to a dislike of Communism.
Peasants also fear that their villages will
become either open battle zones or targets
for South Vietnamese bombs.

In the turmoil of Southeast Asia, the most
tragic victims have been the people living in
contested areas. Refugees, are now seen
nightly on American television, finally
leaving their homes and crops for the
uncertainties and hardships of refugee camps.
The media have casually reported the U.S.
military's interpretation of the mass
relocations: the peasants are "voting with
their feet" and "fleeing from Communism."
As the refugee question re-emerged with
the latest Communist advances, this
explanation at first seemed plausible.
In the 30 years of war in Vietnam, the
people have been the objects of intensive
anti-Communist propaganda campaigns. Jane
Barton, who worked for the American
Friends Service Committee in Vietnam, said
here last quarter that peasants with no clear
political bias often fear Communists because
of horror stories spread by
the U.S. and South Vietnamese governments.
The people could also be afraid of the
"bloodbaths" predicted by President Ford
and military advisers in Southeast Asia. In
almost any military takeover, those who
assume power will imprison or execute those
who were part of the previous power
structure.
But then, a short article in the New York
Times on March 26 began to break down the
myth that fleeing refugees are leaving because
they prefer Thieu's government to the
Communists.
A reporter who asked hundred of refugees
why they were leaving wrote, "Not one said

it was because he or she feared or hated
Communism .... 'Because every one else is
going,' was a typical reply."

He quoted one peasant woman who had
lost her family in a bombing raid by U.S.
pilots in 1968. She said that it would be
"better to go to the Saigon side because the
Communists have no airplanes."
In a special report on Vietnam this week,
CBS explained the evacuations as a mass
reaction to the departure of the military. As
early as February, when Thieu began
withdrawing troops from the central
highlands, peasants began to leave because
they felt the areas must be unsafe.
Ed Block, a former official of the Agency
for International Development in Vietnam,
offered an even more convincing
explanation: fear of being caught in reprisals
by South Vietnamese troops after the
Communists take over.
In an article written last fall, Block
described the strategies employed in 1972 at
Quang Tri when the Provisional
Revolutionary Government and North

Vietnamese gained military control. South
Vietnam withdrew its troops and ordered all
civilians to evacuate. They then assumed that
anyone who stayed was a "Viet Cong
sympathizer" and bombed the city, killing
more than 25,000 civilians.
