# Productivity Must Rise, Says Miller

### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Universities must increase
productivity and re-examine their roles
or face serious consequences, Provost
William Miller warned the spring
meeting of the Academic Council
Friday.
While society as a whole
experiences increases in productivity,
with salaries and wages growing faster
than inflation, universities have not
experienced significant increases in
productivity over many decades, he
noted.
"Students may learn more and
receive a higher quality education that
previously, but the number of students
taught per faculty member per year
has changed very little," Miller said.
A university's freedom is more
restricted as it is forced to seek
subsidies, he warned.
"What I have in mind here as an
example is the consequence of direct
state aid to private higher
education.... In general I am sure
that we can expect state policy in
higher education to lean further in the
direction of detailed cost accounting
and cost-effective competition. Such
controls and/or competition may be
incompatible with our present role of
mixing graduate and undergraduate
education at a research university."
More Attuned
Increased productivity should result
not from a heavier faculty workload,
but from "better use of the work we
do," Miller said. Perhaps the
University could reach additional
audiences by using television or video
cassettes or make more efficient use of
facilities.
In order to continue receiving
support from tuition, taxes and gifts,
graduate and professional schools
"need to become more attuned to
needs of society, [while]
undergraduate education needs to
develop rationale and direction of its
own," Miller said.
A stronger, more structured liberal
arts program should be developed.
Miller said. He feels that
pre-professional training is being
over-emphasized.
"We must prepare our students for
life in a very complex world — a world
of conflict, scarcity and uncertainty."
It is the duty of a university to
make a case for liberal education, he
said.
"Students and their parents or
patrons may be willing to pay high
tuition for pre-professional training
but less willing to do so for a general
liberal education unless it is clearly
perceived to have value."
Balancing his gloomy predictions of
"very rough sailing" ahead for higher
education, Miller included a short pep
talk.
"How we at Stanford fare in the
years ahead will depend upon how
thoughtfully we analyze our problems
and how courageously and sensibly we
respond to them. In the fight for
survival we are out in front of most
institutions, and we have the capacity
to stay there if we use our wits and
our will."

patrons may be willing to pay high
tuition for pre-professional training
but less willing to do so for a general
liberal education unless it is clearly
perceived to have value."
Balancing his gloomy predictions of
"very rough sailing" ahead for higher
education, Miller included a short pep
talk.
"How we at Stanford fare in the
years ahead will depend upon how
thoughtfully we analyze our problems
and how courageously and sensibly we
respond to them. In the fight for
survival we are out in front of most
institutions, and we have the capacity
to stay there if we use our wits and
our will."
Universities must increase
productivity and re-examine their roles
or face serious consequences, Provost
William Miller warned the spring
meeting of the Academic Council
Friday.
While society as a whole
experiences increases in productivity,
with salaries and wages growing faster
than inflation, universities have not
experienced significant increases in
productivity over many decades, he
noted.
"Students may learn more and
receive a higher quality education that
previously, but the number of students
taught per faculty member per year
has changed very little," Miller said.
A university's freedom is more
restricted as it is forced to seek
subsidies, he warned.
"What I have in mind here as an
example is the consequence of direct
state aid to private higher
education.... In general I am sure
that we can expect state policy in
higher education to lean further in the
direction of detailed cost accounting
and cost-effective competition. Such
controls and/or competition may be
incompatible with our present role of
mixing graduate and undergraduate
education at a research university."
More Attuned
Increased productivity should result
not from a heavier faculty workload,
but from "better use of the work we
do," Miller said. Perhaps the
University could reach additional
audiences by using television or video
cassettes or make more efficient use of
facilities.
In order to continue receiving
support from tuition, taxes and gifts,
graduate and professional schools
"need to become more attuned to
needs of society, [while]
undergraduate education needs to
develop rationale and direction of its
own," Miller said.
A stronger, more structured liberal
arts program should be developed.
Miller said. He feels that
pre-professional training is being
over-emphasized.
"We must prepare our students for
life in a very complex world — a world
of conflict, scarcity and uncertainty."
It is the duty of a university to
make a case for liberal education, he
said.
"Students and their parents or
patrons may be willing to pay high
tuition for pre-professional training
but less willing to do so for a general
liberal education unless it is clearly
perceived to have value."
Balancing his gloomy predictions of
"very rough sailing" ahead for higher
