# Bondâ€”YES Again
## 
### 
Last I hursday, we urged that students vote YES on a $1
fee assessment requested by the Stanford Band. Since then,
however, the ASSU Elections Commissioner has determined
that the Band did in fact legally request a $2 assessment.
Despite some dismay that the amount of the fee was
determined at such a late date, we still urge a YES vote on
the Band's assessment, for the reasons stated in our earlier
editorial. We do hope, however, that the Band will make a
sincere effort to conserve money from its fee assessment this
year, so that it only has to ask for $1 next year.
