In his lengthy column (Daily, April 1), Joshua
Simons, director of Education and
Communications for E & J Gallo says in part,
"Negotiations were paralyzed by the UFW's
implacable stand on union discipline and hiring hall
practices .. .
The hiring hall is essential to the whole
philosophy of the United Farmworkers (UFW)
Union — self-determination for the workers. The
Teamsters work under a labor contractor method.
Through this, one man goes out and rounds up a
crew of workers.
He can choose the youngest, heartiest workers
and leave those who are older and have seniority
unemployed. He can threaten anyone with loss of
work and the worker will have no recourse through
any arbitration procedure. Poor people, desperate
for work, can easily be pitted against each other by
the labor contractor.
The hiring hall is a radical change because it
changes the power relationships in the field. Here is
how it works: When coming into town during
harvest season a worker goes to the hiring hall for
work. If he has past seniority, it is on record.
As employers need workers, they put in requests
to the hiring hall, not to labor contractors. Workers
are dispatched according to seniority, not according
to the whim of the labor contractor. If a worker is
fired for non-performance, the employer must
inform the union hall.
If the firing is arbitrary, then the union can take
up the case with the employer and if necessary go
through an arbitration procedure. The labor
contractor may or may not fight for the worker.
It's easier for him not to hassle with the employer
and it's easy for him to find someone else in need

of work.
The growers have been fighting the use of the
hiring hall since contracts were signed in 1970.
From their point of view it is a limitation on their
freedom to manage their business. It forces them to
respond to the rights of the workers. From the
workers' point of view, it is an absolutely essential
protection from arbitrary firing and from dismissal
from the fields when they reach middle age.
Seeing how the hiring hall gives more dignity
and power to the workers in the long run, it is easy
to see why Gallo made quiet requests to the
Teamsters to come in and organize workers, as was
outlined in the first part of my column (Daily.
April 11).
The UFW takes an "implacable stand" on the
hiring hall because it offers the most
self-determination to the workers and because it
eliminates the ability of the grower or the labor
contractor to exploit workers and cause
competition among people desperate for work.
The following additional items are found in
UFW contracts (e.g., currently with Almaden).
Toilets in the fields; cool, portable drinking water
in individual cups; ban on pesticides — DDT,
Dieldrin, Endrin; workers get at least one day off
per week.
None of these is found in a Teamster contract.
In addition, UFW contracts provide real job
security. A Teamster contract has a 30-day
probationary period during which a worker can be
fired for any cause without access to grievance
procedure.
These items testify to the UFW's commitment
to worker dignity, safety and security.

In his lengthy column (Daily, April 1), Joshua
Simons, director of Education and
Communications for E & J Gallo says in part,
"Negotiations were paralyzed by the UFW's
implacable stand on union discipline and hiring hall
practices .. .
The hiring hall is essential to the whole
philosophy of the United Farmworkers (UFW)
Union — self-determination for the workers. The
Teamsters work under a labor contractor method.
Through this, one man goes out and rounds up a
crew of workers.
He can choose the youngest, heartiest workers
and leave those who are older and have seniority
unemployed. He can threaten anyone with loss of
work and the worker will have no recourse through
any arbitration procedure. Poor people, desperate
for work, can easily be pitted against each other by
the labor contractor.
The hiring hall is a radical change because it
changes the power relationships in the field. Here is
how it works: When coming into town during
harvest season a worker goes to the hiring hall for
work. If he has past seniority, it is on record.
As employers need workers, they put in requests
to the hiring hall, not to labor contractors. Workers
are dispatched according to seniority, not according
to the whim of the labor contractor. If a worker is
fired for non-performance, the employer must
inform the union hall.
If the firing is arbitrary, then the union can take
up the case with the employer and if necessary go
through an arbitration procedure. The labor
contractor may or may not fight for the worker.
It's easier for him not to hassle with the employer
and it's easy for him to find someone else in need

of work.
The growers have been fighting the use of the
hiring hall since contracts were signed in 1970.
From their point of view it is a limitation on their
freedom to manage their business. It forces them to
respond to the rights of the workers. From the
workers' point of view, it is an absolutely essential
protection from arbitrary firing and from dismissal
from the fields when they reach middle age.
Seeing how the hiring hall gives more dignity
and power to the workers in the long run, it is easy
to see why Gallo made quiet requests to the
Teamsters to come in and organize workers, as was
outlined in the first part of my column (Daily.
April 11).
The UFW takes an "implacable stand" on the
hiring hall because it offers the most
self-determination to the workers and because it
eliminates the ability of the grower or the labor
contractor to exploit workers and cause
competition among people desperate for work.
The following additional items are found in
UFW contracts (e.g., currently with Almaden).
Toilets in the fields; cool, portable drinking water
in individual cups; ban on pesticides — DDT,
Dieldrin, Endrin; workers get at least one day off
per week.
None of these is found in a Teamster contract.
In addition, UFW contracts provide real job
security. A Teamster contract has a 30-day
probationary period during which a worker can be
fired for any cause without access to grievance
procedure.
These items testify to the UFW's commitment
to worker dignity, safety and security.
