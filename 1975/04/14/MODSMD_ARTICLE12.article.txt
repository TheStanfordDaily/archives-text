# McCloskey Abandons Old Principles
## 
### William Ross 
Early in the 19705, when Richard Nixon
had formulated the mildly liberal reforms he
hyperbolically dubbed "the New American
Revolution," H.R. Haldeman was asked by a
reporter how the program would play in
Peoria (i.e., would it bother conservatives?).
In his characteristically cynical manner,
Haldeman replied that in politics, if one
acquires a reputation for getting up early, he
can sleep every day until noon.
Haldeman's observation, while prosaic,
was accurate if the recent experience of Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park) is any
indication. McCloskey, who won renown
during 1967-73 for his courageous opposition
to American military participation in
Indochina, has recently become an apologist
for President Ford's Indochina policy.
But admiration for McCloskey's earlier
stand on the Indochina question is so
ingrained in most Stanford students that
criticism of McCloskey's position is largely
muted.
True, a few hundred students turned out
last month to argue with McCloskey when he
appeared on campus to advocate the
extension of American military aid to
Cambodia through June 1.
But there are few signs that a majority of
the more than 1000 Stanford students who
changed their registration to Republican last
year to help McCloskey through a tough
primary are indignant about his attitude
toward aid to Indochina.
Aid Support Probable
Although as I write this, McCloskey has
not yet responded to Ford's request for $972
million in aid to Indochina, he will probably
soon announce his support for Ford's
program.
McCloskey, it seems, was helped through
his tough primary (which he won by one
percent) not only by Stanford's new
Republicans, but also by Ford's tacit
endorsement of him during an appearance in
San Jose last April 20.
For this and other reasons, McCloskey
apparently considers himself obligated to
support Ford's Indochina policy.
Other reasons include his reputed hope of
receiving a cabinet post and his need to win
GOP support in case he decides to run for the
Senate in 1976.

Unfortunately, this political expediency is
forcing McCloskey to tarnish his generally
favorable record on military policy.
Record Not Perfect
This record is not unsullied. McCloskey,
for example, called for military action against
North Korea over the 1968 Pueblo seizure. In
light of the outcome of that crisis,
McCloskey's hawkishness certainly seems
rash.

And last spring, in the crudest campaign
brochure I've ever seen, McCloskey boasted
that as a serviceman in Korea, he had
personally killed several Communists and was
decorated for his actions.
But on the whole, McCloskey has
generally been willing over the years to speak
out against American involvement in
Indochina at great risk to his political career.
This is why his current position is so
unfortunate.
Even though McCloskey admitted last
month that the fall of Cambodia was
imminent, he favored Ford's request for aid.
But as countless Americans have pointed
out, why should the United States give
Cambodia the means to continue a hopeless
struggle? Wouldn't it be better under the
circumstances to allow Cambodia to fall so
that the killing could finally end?
As for Vietnam, McCloskey has
apparently acquiesced to Ford's resuscitation
of the antiquated "domino theory" as a
pretext for pumping more money into the
Thieu regime.
In doing so, McCloskey is supporting the
same reasoning that he rightly disparaged
from his first race for Congress in 1967.
McCloskey has also supported Ford's

evacuation of orphans, a nauseating public
relations gimmick. McCloskey has shown
little concern for the thousands of
Vietnamese employees of Americans.
These people should be placed on the
flights now carrying the orphans. They would
be slaughtered by the Communists if Saigon
fell, while the Communists would take good
care of the children. If McCloskey is truly
concerned about America's loyalty to its
allies, he should be more concerned about
our loyalty to people who have faithfully
served Americans rather than to a few
children.
But worst of all, McCloskey has criticized
charges by congressional Democrats that
Ford, by his request for aid, is attempting to
place the blame for the "loss" of Vietnam on
Congress.
McCloskey is thus helping to prepare the
way for a bitter period of recriminations
similar to those of the early Cold War era
when both parties accused the other of
"losing" China and other so-called allies.
Aid Is Useless
Certainly the hasty retreats by South
Vietnamese forces and Thieu's disastrous
military decisions have convinced even the
most obtuse people that a few million dollars
in U.S. aid couldn't have prevented the
debacle. Likewise, it should be clear that
any more U.S. aid will not decide the
outcome of the conflict.
Some people might defend McCloskey by
claiming that as Republican, it is only
natural that he would defend a president of
his own party. But in the past, McCloskey
has never been afraid to speak out against the
policies of his party leaders.
Hopefully, students will remember
McCloskey's latest position on Vietnam when
he comes to campus next year to beg them to
change their registration to Republican to
help buttress him against conservatives in the
primary.
But it is likely that McCloskey's
reputation as a man of peace is too firmly
established to be challenged and that
students will continue to give him their
overwhelming support.
