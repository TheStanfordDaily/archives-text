# Support Realistic Slate
## Randy Bergerac 
### 
At a time when the concept of
"student representation" has
become a fashionable theme, I am
encouraged to see that at least one
presidential slate has stepped back
to consider the full scope of the
problem — and consider it
rationally.
The right to demonstrate
against grievances is critical to the
functioning of a free society, but
it takes on additional meaning
within the context of a
University. No matter how noble
the cause, confrontation politics
here may be merely a symptom of
poor leadership too late, up to the
point where a rally becomes the
only recourse left.
After reviewing the campaign
platforms released thus far, 1 am
satisfied that only one slate has
made the commitment to seeking
a broad-based, realistic set of
mechanisms to alleviate this
problem. Here I refer to the
McDermott, Rodden, Leuchter
and Simonian ticket.
I will limit my remarks and
support to the McDermott
proposal that the COP sponsor
public, open meetings moderated
by students on important topics,
as they develop. A week ago for
the first time, the students on the
Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs called such a meeting.
With nominal discussion of the
problems to open the meeting, the
rest of the evening provided the
student members with a wealth of
information that would have
otherwise not been available
without direct contact with the
students.
1 am confident that similar
forums could be arranged and
student consensus reached before
any important decision is resolved
inside the insulated environment
of the present committee process.
A careful reading of the
available platforms reaffirms my
contention that only the
McDermott slate has given careful
consideration to a wide variety of
ways to create added student
channels for expressing their
views. Advocacy and
representation of the student
sector depend heavily upon
quality research and early
scheduling of position statements.
The committee structure will
continue to frustrate the Stanford
community unless these
requirements are responded to.
The only slate that I find sharing
these beliefs with conviction is
McDermott's. 1 hope that you will
join me next week in supporting
the platform that recognizes and
will expand the critical role of
students on committees.
