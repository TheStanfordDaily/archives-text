# Letters—ASSU Council Of Presidents Election

Editor:
Stanford Asian Students
Coordinating Committee (SASCC)
heartily endorses Lee Rosenbaum,
Josie Jaramillo, Dave Galligan,
and Charlotte Germane for next
year's ASSU Council of
Presidents.
This slate's sensitivity and
emphasis on campus issues (rather

than student services) make them
unique from the other contenders.
We find their stance on
minority issues to be thoughtful
and sensitive. We feel that this
slate most accurately represents
our concerns and viewpoints as
minority students at Stanford.
Student leaders must place
their energy into improving the
quality of undergraduate
education. Members of this slate
have a past history of actively
working to do just that.
We strongly urge students to
cast their votes for Rosenbaum,
Jaramillo, Galli|an, and Germane
for ASSU Council of Presidents.

Randy Smith criticized Kevin
McDermott for his behavior at the
March 31 ASSU Senate meeting in
an April 9 letter to the Daily.
Since then, there has been
considerable confusion among
those present as to whether
McDermott or Tim Conway, the
senator sitting next to him,
actually moved to adjourn the
meeting in the middle of the
discussion of my request.
I was very distracted by a
conversation going on between
McDermott and Conway directly
in front of me. And, at the time,
at least one other senator and I
believed that McDermott had
motioned for adjournment.
I have since been convinced
that Conway in fact made the
motion. The blame for my bad
experience should not fall totally
on McDermott but also on
Conway and the Senate as a whole
for creating an atmosphere in
which it was very difficult to
present my request — a little on
me too for not being strong
enough to talk over the
disruptions.

Editor:
I am appalled by the
mud-slinging tactics used by Chris
Gray (Daily, April 10) in his
attacks on the McDermott
Council of Presidents slate. He has
resorted to both character
assassination and distortion in his
efforts to make the Rosenbaum
slate appear acceptable.
Calling Kevin McDermott "the
most reactionary ASSU senator
and labeling Andy Leuchter,
founder and director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, an "ASSU
bureaucrat" does not mitigate
their past accomplishments within
the ASSU.
Referring to Bonny Rodden
and Mark Simonian simply as
"former Daily staffers" belittles
the expertise in University affairs
that these two have developed as
housing and SWOPSI/SCIRE
reporters, respectively.
I agree with Gray on only one
point: that actions speak louder
than words. The intensive research
with which the McDermott slate
has backed up each and every one
of their proposals speaks far
louder than the shopping list of
"things we'll look into once
elected" which the Rosenbaum
slate has proposed. Gray's
assertion that the McDermott
slate knows nothing of "the nuts
and bolts of the ASSU" is one
that he simply does not and
cannot justify.
In reality. Gray's statement
that "leadership is more than just
talk" is a severe criticism of the
Rosenbaum slate, not of the
McDermott slate.

As a student who has been
actively involved in the fight to
save our extradepartmental
programs (SWOPSI. SCIRE,
Urban Studies), I would like to
comment on the Council of
Presidents' election and its likelv

impart on the programs in the
future.
Those of us helping organize
the Save SWOPSI Committee
always held open meetings which
anyone could have attended. We
have a very good response, both
for organizers and for participants
in our activities. Yet at no time
has any member of the Kevin
McDermott slate shown any
interest at all in our activities. It
seems rather hypocritical, then,
for that particular slate to vow as
part of its campaign promises to
actively work for the maintenance
of independent extradepartmental
programs.
On the other hand, members of
the Rosenbaum slate have been
actively involved in the past in the
Save SWOPSI struggle and have

demonstrated through their
actions their real concern for the
plight of undergraduate
education.
Now, as part of their platform,
they are making concrete
proposals for working on these
areas. Since this issue will be most
important next year when a
decision about the future of
SWOPSI is made, I believe it is
crucial that all people concerned
about undergraduate education
strongly support a slate which will
truly represent their interests.
That slate is the Rosenbaum slate.
Beware of campaign rhetoric.
The Rosenbaum slate's actions
speak much louder than
McDermott's words.
