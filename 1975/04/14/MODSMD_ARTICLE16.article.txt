# AQUAFOLLIES
## 
### 
Jousting proved to be
one of the afternoon's
more popular
competitions as
fraternity men
competed on the
lake for the honor
of their house.

For six hours yesterday, Lake Lagunita was the hub of
activity around Stanford. It was the spring festival â€” even if
Sol was unable to break through a mid-afternoon haze and
winds made for most unspring-like weather.
The frats sponsored it. Aquafollies is a great open-air rush
function. A very effective one, too.
The waterskiers were a big attraction this year. They are
every year. And those rats on the Stanford Fire Frigate
finally got what they deserved after dousing spectators on the
beaches for too long. Credit the frat whose members swam
out and captured it in pitched battle.
Larry Horton, a man disdained by frat rats and dorm
dogs alike, drew a big cheer, too, but only because someone
was able to dunk him at the dunking booth.
Maybe best of all, all proceeds from the day will go
toward purchase of an Optacon, a reading device for blind
students.
