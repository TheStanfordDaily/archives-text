WILL THEY STILL BE AROUND NEXT YEAR? -Pictured above is
Stanford player lJonny Stewart, moving downfield in a game last
quarter. Stewart is overseas this quarter, but the Stanford lacrosse
team is still around. It lost Saturday to San Francisco, 13-4, to drop
its record to 3-5, however the situation should be reversed when the
Cards meet Monterey here next Saturday. The club recently lost the
support of the Athietic Department when club sports funding was
eliminated from the budget, and the Stanford lacrosse future is not
bright. The present season will continue until May 14, with a game
every week.
