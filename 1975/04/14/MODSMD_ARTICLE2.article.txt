# 82 Units Reserved
## Emeriti Apartments On Schedule 
### RON ELVING 
Construction of the $3.9 million
Pearce-Mitchell emeriti housing
complex for faculty and senior staff is
proceeding on schedule and should be
completed in the early fall, according
to Faculty-Staff Housing Manager
Robert Summers.
Occupancy of the condominium
project is slated for October. Summers
said last week that "things art 1 going
very well" and he is "optimistic"
about completing the project on time.

"We have received reservations for
the purchase of the majority of the 82
units already," Summers reported,
"and we're getting more every day."
The University's primary goal in the
housing project is to free on-campus
family dwellings by providing
well-located alternative housing for
emeritus faculty and senior staff.
Legal finalization of sales and
receipt of the initial deposits must
await final approval of the project by

the state Housing Commission, but the
University has filed all necessary
documents and reports. Summers said
he expects the green light from
Sacramento to come any day now.
The condominiums, priced from
$28,500 to $60,000, may only be
purchased by Stanford faculty or
senior staff. Although no units will be
available for lease from the University,
Summers said that some may be
rented out by purchasers who wish to
delay their own occupancy.
Cassius Kirk, University staff
counsel for the housing project, said
that a potential lessee must either
qualify as a buyer or gain the approval
of the complex's owners' association.
Summers explained that the
"owners' association" currently
consists of the University and the
construction company
(Wheatley-Jacobsen of Palo Alto), but
will be taken over by the owners
themselves as soon as 51 percent of
the units are financed and sold.
Until the owners assume control,
however, Kirk said it would not be
possible to set up a procedure for
screening rental applicants or establish
criteria for approval. Kirk said it
seemed "entirely possible" that
students might be allowed to lease.
A faculty-staff housing project was
first proposed in late 1973 after a
survey established a market for
on-campus apartments. At the time,
the plans called for 100 rental
apartments and a three-story
construction design.
Opposition to the plan developed
among Row residents who felt that the
complex was architecturally
inappropriate for the area and that the
student ambience of the Row would
be lost. Other students objected to the
expenditure involved in light of the
need for on-campus student housing.
In February, 1974 a student
referendum disapproved of the plan by
an 18-1 margin, prompting President
Richard Lyman to refer the project to
both Summers and Ed Shaw, executive
assistant to the provost, for revision.
Summers and Shaw produced a new
proposal, substituting the
condominium concept and scaling
down the project to its present
dimensions. The latter plan was
approved by the University Land and
Building Committee, Lyman, and the
University Board of Trustees.
