Crew
The Stanford Crew emerged
from the wilds of Oregon this
weekend after a fairly successful
encounter with Oregon and
Oregon State. In the featured race,
the varsity met an undefeated
Oregon State team which was
basically intact from last season
when it finished fourth best on
the coast. The Cards needed a
strong showing to make up for
last week's upset loss to USC and
they got it as they battled OSU to
the finish before losing by less
than a second.
The race proved a contrast to
the USC race in which Stanford
held a slight edge until the final
few strokes; this week Stanford
trailed for the entire race but put
on a tremendous sprint in the end
which fell short by only a few
feet. Oregon was a distant third,
fading after being unable to keep
up with the leaders' torid pace.
Varsity members found the race
encouraging despite being
disappointed at losing their
second close race in as many
weeks.
In the most impressive event of
the day, the undefeated junior
varsity buried Oregon State by
almost 12 seconds with a
withering final 1000 meters which
saw them build up a nearly three
boat length margin.
The Stanford frosh met their
stiffest test of the year against a
bigger and more experienced OSU
freshman boat. Stanford dueled
Oregon State almost evenly, and
even built a slight lead before
being overtaken near the finish

and losing by less than two
seconds.

Women's Tennis
The Stanford women's tennis
team keeps rolling along.
Last week the Cards blew both
San Francisco State and Fresno
State off Lagunita Courts and
today they meet UC-Davis in the
same arena.
Last Tuesday Stanford
annihilated the SFS Gators 7-0,
losing only 17 of 72 games, and
not losing a set. Andrea Barnes,
Tracy McNair, Joy Hahn, and
Nancy Rudd were victorious in
the singles.
And on Friday Stanford scored
another shut-out, blanking Fresno
State 6-0. Lela Feround, Barnes,
and McNair were the singles
winners.
