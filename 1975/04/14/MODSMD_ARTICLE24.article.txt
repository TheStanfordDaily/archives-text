# Card Batsmen Sack Troy In Tinseltown; Take Important Series And Pac-8 Lead
## 
### DAN PYNE 
The Stanford baseball team,
displaying clutch pitching in the
face of some of the best college
batters in the country and clutch
hitting against some of the besl
college pitchers in the country,
swept a doubleheader from USC
Saturday in one of the moro
crucial series of the Pacific Eight
season.
And although the Cards lost
yesterday, their 2-1 series victory
over the five-time defending
national champion Trojans gave
them confidence, momentum and
an early-season share of the
conference lead.
Saturday the Cards beat USC
1-0, 12-3 in a day/night twin bill,
but yesterday USC mustered a

barrage of hits to stop Stanford
7-5.
"We battled them all the way,"
Stanford Coach Ray Young
explained. "They're a strong
team, but we were hitting the ball
well, our pitchers did a good job,
and we executed as well as we
have any time all y«ar. That
basically sums it up."
Kept Pressure On
Young said that the team, even
in yesterday's loss, did not let up
and did not take the pressure off
the Trojans. "Everytime we did
something right we'd get
confidence and do something else
right and it just kept building up
— that put a lot of pressure on
them [USC]."
In the opener of Saturday's

doubleheader Stanford ace A 1
Arthur got the Cards started,
throwing a five-hit shutout for a
1-0 victory.
Stanford scored its run in the
top of the first. Catcher Bruce
Robinson was hit by a pitch with
two outs and no one on base, and
firstbaseman Tom C.uardino
followed with a double down the
right field line to scon 1 Robinson
from first.
The rest of the game was a
pitching duel.
Trojan hurler Pete Redfem
struck out 10 Card batters to hold
Stanford to its lone run, but
Arthur, with but one strike out,
managed to throttle USC. No
Trojan runners reached third base;
only three reached second. "Al

pitched very gritty baseball,"
Young said, "and the rest of the
team played a fine defensive
game."
In the nightcap, lefty John
Yandle went all the way on the
mound for Stanford, faltering
only in the second inning when he
gave up a two-run homer.
The Cards collected 15 hits;
Dave Baker and Bob Hampton
each had four base hits. Hampton
hit his fourth homer of the season
in the fourth inning.
Grand Slam
There were even bright spots in
yesterday's loss. Down 7-0 with
one out in the ninth inning, the
Cards rallied for five runs.
Robinson singled, Guardino
walked. Handy Wong singled to
load the bases, Steve Davis singled
to bring in Robinson, and then
Hampton hit his fifth homer of
the season to clear the bases.
Mike Williamson started for
Stanford, and did a "creditable
job," Young said. Ken Grolle was
the anticipated starter, but did
not feel ready after his pre-game
warm-ups. Williamson pitched six
complete innings, allowing two
runs. Kent Caldwell relieved him
and got belted in the seventh; Ed
Matta came on in the same inning
and held USC scoreless for the
remainder of the game.
Young singled out Baker for
praise after the series, saying he
"played very well in right field."
Young also said that, at
present, his biggest worry is
finding a third pitcher for the
starting rotation. He indicated
that Jim Scharffenberger may fill
the spot if he shows well against
St. Mary's at Sunken Diamond on
Tuesday.

As for thf Pac-8 season, the
Cardinal coach explains, "right
now it doesn't matter who in
particular you beai — you've just
got to try to beat everyone you
play. If we sweep USC and lose to
Cal. we're right back where we
started. Every game is important."
These, perhaps, a little more
than others.
