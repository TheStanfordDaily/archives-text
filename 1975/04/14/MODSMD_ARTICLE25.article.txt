# Netters Ace Trinity, Cal
## 
### JOHN ROOS RON BECK 
It's 26 dual match victories in a
row for Stanford's tennis team
after two weekend wins, and it
appears that the stage has been set
for a showdown between UCLA
and Stanford next weekend in
Maples.
The Card netters easily beat
Trinity University and California
over the weekend by identical 8-1
scores. On a great afternoon for
players and spectators last Friday,
an estimated 1000 Varsity Courts
fans watched the Cards demolish
what was supposed to be the fifth
best team in the nation, Trinity.
At first singles, John Whitlinger
whipped former National
Interscnolastic Singles Champion
Bill Matyastik, 6-1, 6-4. The sole
loss for the Cards came at second
singles, where Nick Saviano
dropped a three setter to Trinity's
David King, 6-3, 1-6, 7-6. Saviano
had trouble with his footing
throughout the match, and was
visibly hurting by the third set.
Saviano was kept out of
Saturday's match against Cal due
to a pulled groin muscle.
All the other singles and
doubles matches went as
expected, with Pat DuPre, Jim
Delaney, Gene Mayer and Bill
Maze sweeping their individual
duals.
The 8-1 victory over Cal was
no surprise to anybody. Trinity
had whitewashed the Golden
Bears, 9-0, earlier last week. The

only surprise of the match was
Card John Whitlinger's sudden
withdrawal and default of his
match against Doug King.
Whitlinger has been having
problems with his shoulder all
season long, and, after splitting
the first two sets 6-1, 4-6. he
defaulted due to shoulder pains.
Coach Dick Gould said that
both Whitlinger and Saviano
would be ready for the weekend
matches. Whitlinger and Saviano
will be the Stanford half of the
indoor singles matches both
against UCLA and against USC.
Student tickets are still
available for the indoor and
outdoor matches. Indoor tickets
can be obtained at the Athletic
Department for $1; outdoor
tickets go on sale Friday for 50c.

AND THEN THERE WERE FOUR - Last fall there were three
Stanford quarterback candidates; now there's another. Watching as
Guy Benjamin and Mike Cordova run through offensive drills on the
first day of spring practice are Jerry Waldvogel (15) and newcomer
freshman Steve Dils (12). And watching them is runningback Ron
Inge. Perhaps he is wondering who will be running things next fall, or,
perhaps, he is wondering what he is doing in a football uniform on
this fine, spring, Saturday morning. -Daily photo by Mark Funk
