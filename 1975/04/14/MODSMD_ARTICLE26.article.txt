# Athletic Input Council Begins
## 
### MARK FUNK 
The Student-Athletic
Council will hold an
organizational meeting tonight
to discuss ideas for increased
student input in Athletic
Department decisions,
according to Drew Palin, one
of the group's organizers.
Pal in said that more student
input was critical in light of
recent developments within
the Athletic Department. "We
know that there have been
changes in the department —
particularly as it relates to
women's athletics — and there
will be some problems," he
said.
"We want to insure that
problems with scheduling,
facilities and finances are
viewed from a student
perspective," Palin added.
Pal in said that the new
organization should not be
confused with the athletes
council made up entirely of
Stanford varsity athletes. It
will draw from the entire
student body.
Palin stressed that the
organization is designed to
include students with various
athletic backgrounds.
"Maybe if there
had been something like this
we could have avoided the
controversy over gymnastics
and wrestling — we could have
shown the athletic department
that there was support for the
sports before things got out of
hand."
The first meeting will be
held in Room 350, Encina
Gym, at 7:30 p.m.
