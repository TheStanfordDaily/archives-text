Phnom Penh Attack Feared Imminent
PHNOM PENH — Heavy fighting broke out early this
morning as Khmer Rouge rebels drove to within a mile of
the highway Irom Phnom Penh to the airport that is this
city's only link with the outside world.
It was feared an attack on the capital itself was
imminent.
Cambodian Premier Long Boret said yesterday that U.S.
Ambassador John Gunther Dean suggested to him that he
invite Prince Norodom Sihanouk, nominal leader of the
rebels, back to Cambodia in a bid to end the war.
But Boret told a news conference he [Boret] refused the
suggestion, which he said was made Friday, and that his
side would "ignore" the rebels and not negotiate until there
was a cease-fire. "We will never surrender," he said.
Meanwhile, South Vietnamese forces drove back heavy
assaults yesterday against strongholds northeast and
southwest of Saigon.
With Saigon itself at stake, military sources said
President Nguyen Van Thieu sent hundreds of armored
vehicles into the battle for Xuan Loc, the provincial
capital 40 miles east of the capital which has practically
been leveled by five days of fighting.
Thirty miles southwest of Saigon, South Vietnamese
forces appeared to have turned back a major North
Vietnamese attempt to isolate Saigon from its food supplies
in the Mekong Delta.
Ford Approves Viet Evacuation Plan
NEW YORK — Newsweek magazine said yesterday that

Vise" to evacuate up to 200,000 South Vietnamese whose

However, the magazine said some Pentagon officials
believe the plan to evacuate select politicians, military
officers and civil servants might require up to six divisions
to carry out and might ultimately lead to renewed fighting
by U.S. troops in Vietnam.
