The worst thing about cancer "is
not pain or suffering, but rather that it
makes us aware of death. Most people
think they're immortal," says terminal
cancer patient Orville Kelly.
Suggesting that people "should
look at death not morbidly, but as a
natural occurrence," Kelly discussed
the problems of terminal cancer in a
talk Friday at the Medical Center.
A former Illinois newspaper editor
who now lives in Burlington, lowa,
Kelly is the founder of Make Today
Count, an organization of people with
incurable diseases, their families and
physicians. Make Today Count has
chapters across the United States, and
is devoted to alleviating the
psychological and emotional problems
of the patient and his relatives.
Kelly said he found out he had
cancer in 1973, diagnosed as a
lymphocytic lymphoma. ' When I was
told of the cancer," said Kelly, "my
first thought was 'I'm going to die.' "
Following an operation in June of
that year, Kelly said one doctor told
him he had three years left to live, at
the most.
Like many cancer patients, Kelly
added, his initial reaction to this
prognosis was anger. "I was very angry
at first, but someone was there to
listen, and I got it all out of my
system. [This) was very important."
Kelly berated his clergymen and his
physicians for a lack of candor and
honesty. "The ministers I met were
capable of preparing for heaven, but
would not answer questions about

today."
He said doctors and nurses refused
to talk to him. "They wouldn't even
tell me what my temperature was,"
said Kelly. "There was a complete lack
of communication."
Kelly suggested that all those
connected with the cancer patient
must display openness, honesty and
care and should answer any questions
the patient might have.
"Not all cancer patients want to
know the truth, but if the patient
wants to know he should be told. All
too often, relatives of the patient

don't want him to know he has cancer
and will refuse to let anyone tell him.
This is a real tragedy."
Kelly, who is married and has four
children, said the discovery of an
incurable disease also poses emotional
and psychological problems for the
patient's family. "The fact that I have
an incurable cancer is harder on them
[ his family) than it is on me."
Although he said he sometimes
experiences symptoms of his disease or
the side effects of chemotherapy,
Kelly insisted, "I'm functioning
normally. I don't consider myself as a
dying cancer patient. People who go
off every day to jobs they despise an
worse off than 1 am, because they're
wasting their lives.
"Many cancer patients are more
aware of and get more out of life than
other people because they can't take it
for granted anymore."

the most.
Like many cancer patients, Kelly
added, his initial reaction to this
prognosis was anger. "I was very angry
at first, but someone was there to
listen, and I got it all out of my
system. [This) was very important."
Kelly berated his clergymen and his
physicians for a lack of candor and
honesty. "The ministers I met were
capable of preparing for heaven, but
would not answer questions about

today."
He said doctors and nurses refused
to talk to him. "They wouldn't even
tell me what my temperature was,"
said Kelly. "There was a complete lack
of communication."
Kelly suggested that all those
connected with the cancer patient
must display openness, honesty and
care and should answer any questions
the patient might have.
"Not all cancer patients want to
know the truth, but if the patient
wants to know he should be told. All
too often, relatives of the patient

don't want him to know he has cancer
and will refuse to let anyone tell him.
This is a real tragedy."
Kelly, who is married and has four
children, said the discovery of an
incurable disease also poses emotional
and psychological problems for the
patient's family. "The fact that I have
an incurable cancer is harder on them
[ his family) than it is on me."
Although he said he sometimes
experiences symptoms of his disease or
the side effects of chemotherapy,
Kelly insisted, "I'm functioning
normally. I don't consider myself as a
dying cancer patient. People who go
off every day to jobs they despise an
worse off than 1 am, because they're
wasting their lives.
"Many cancer patients are more
aware of and get more out of life than
other people because they can't take it
for granted anymore."
The worst thing about cancer "is
not pain or suffering, but rather that it
makes us aware of death. Most people
think they're immortal," says terminal
cancer patient Orville Kelly.
Suggesting that people "should
look at death not morbidly, but as a
natural occurrence," Kelly discussed
the problems of terminal cancer in a
talk Friday at the Medical Center.
A former Illinois newspaper editor
who now lives in Burlington, lowa,
Kelly is the founder of Make Today
Count, an organization of people with
incurable diseases, their families and
physicians. Make Today Count has
chapters across the United States, and
is devoted to alleviating the
psychological and emotional problems
of the patient and his relatives.
Kelly said he found out he had
cancer in 1973, diagnosed as a
lymphocytic lymphoma. ' When I was
told of the cancer," said Kelly, "my
first thought was 'I'm going to die.' "
Following an operation in June of
that year, Kelly said one doctor told
him he had three years left to live, at
the most.
