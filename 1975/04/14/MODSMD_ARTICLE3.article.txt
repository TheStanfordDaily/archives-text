# Prof Flies To NSF Hearings Today
## 
### PAM WOODS 
Stanford psychologist Richard
Atkinson, nominated last month by
President Ford to be the deputy
director of the National Science
Foundation (NSF), flies to
Washington, D.C. today to attend his
confirmation hearings in the Senate.
Atkinson, the assistant dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
and former chairman of the
Psychology Department, succeeds
Raymond Bisplinghoff, a former Space
Agency official, who resigned to
become President of the University of
Missouri.
Atkinson will be the first social
scientist to hold one of the top two
positions in the National Science
Foundation, an agency dominated by
physical scientists.
Gardner Lindsay, a University of
Texas psychologist, called Atkinson's
appointment "a vote of confidence on
the part of the Director of NSF" and
the National Science Board in the
social and behavioral sciences," in a
recent issue of Science and
Government Report.
Atkinson said he believed he was an
attractive choice for the NSF because
he represents "the hard side of social
sciences." He specializes in research in
memory and learning and the
application of computers to
instruction.

The National Science Foundation
initiates and supports scientific
research and awards grants, contracts
and cooperative agreements to
universities, non-profit and other
research organizations to carry out
research.
As NSF's deputy director, Atkinson
said he sees his main responsibility as
"making our case for funding to
Congress." He said he will also see that
the internal functioning of the
Foundation goes smoothly.
"I'm very concerned with the
health of the Foundation and the state
of science, and I hope I can have some
impact," he said.
Atkinson is expected to be
confirmed without difficulty. If so, he
will begin his new job on June 1.
He will not be leaving Stanford
permanently, however. He has only
taken a two-year leave of absence,
after which he will return here and
resume his teaching and research. "It's
too good a situation to give up," he
said.
Atkinson has been at Stanford since
1961. He is well-known for his
research and also for the ten books he
has authored, including Introduction
to Psychology A member of the
National Academy of Science, he is
also the president of the Western
Psychological Association and has held
many offices with the American
Psychological Association.
