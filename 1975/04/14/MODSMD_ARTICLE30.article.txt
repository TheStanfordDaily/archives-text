# Daily Fee Assessment: Questions And Answers
## 
### 
The Board of Directors of the Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation has
decided to seek a fee assessment of $1 per student for each of autumn, winter
and summer quarters. We Would like to explain this decision to you.
Despite a steady increase in revenue from advertising, the Daily has not
been able to make ends meet because of substantial increases in operating
costs.
The Daily's projected deficit for 1975-76 is nearly $31,000. If the
assessment is passed, we expect to collect approximately $10,000 from the
students each of fall and winter quarters, and approximately $4000 summer
quarter 1976 — a total of $24,000.
We have promised that we will not collect any of this student money
unless the University pays us $10,000 for copies of the Daily read by the
faculty and staff. Both the student and University fees represent an average
cost of 1.7 cents per issue. (The cost is even less for students who will not be
here summer quarter 1976.) We will not collect one fee without the other.
This means that students will not pay for copies of the Daily read by faculty
and staff.
The combined amount that we are seeking from students and the
University totals $34,000 — enough to cover our $31,000 projected deficit
plus a 10 percent contingency reserve.
Many of the 50 largest daily college and university newspapers receive well
over $50,000 a year in student fees. We are asking for substantially less than
that, and are convinced that we need every bit of it in order to continue
publishing for another year.
The decision to seek these fees was not made hastily or lightly. Our Board
of Directors's a responsible group of people comprised of law student Diane
Fields, Daily Advertising Manager Lee Hanley, Attorney William Kartozian,
Daily Business Manager Michael Kuhl, San Francisco Chronicle Editorial Page
Editor Templeton Peck, Communication Prof. William Rivers, Daily Editor
Kevin Smith and former Daily Editor Jim Wascher. The Board determined,
after careful consideration, that the requested fees are the only way to keep
the Daily in operation for another year.
We have been asked many of the following questions during our recent
petition drive to put the assessment on the ballot. If we have not answered
your question, please feel free to contact Kevin Smith, Jim Wascher, Rich
Jaroslovsky or Dave Robinson at 497-4632.
Who Pays For The Daily Now?
During the current school year, the Daily is receiving $17,500 from the
University administration to pay for faculty and staff copies. Otherwise,
we're subsisting almost solely off of advertising revenues; students haven't
paid for the paper since fall quarter of 1973.
Since the paper will lose around $15,000 this year, despite the
administration subsidy, we will have to use money from our cash reserves to
cover the deficit. Those reserves are currently only $20,000, and covering this
year's losses will leave us with enough to cover only a fraction of next year's
estimated $31,000 deficit.
What Happened To The Statements Of Three Years Ago That The
Daily Would Be Entirely Self-Sufficient By Next Year?
Basically, the Daily and University officials planning independence simply
couldn't foresee the current economic climate.
Printing costs — our largest single expenditure — have climbed enormously
in recent years. Due to rising costs of labor and material, not to mention
spiraling inflation, the cost of printing the paper has shot up 20 percent in
one year, with more to come in 1975-76. Installation of the Centrex phone
system has caused a substantial increase in our monthly phone bills. In
addition, office supplies, equipment, utilities and maintenance costs have all
risen dramatically. We've already raised our advertising rates, and have in fact
increased our total ad lineage — but we just can't keep pace with skyrocketing
costs.
If This Fee Assessment Passes, Will The Daily Still Be
Independent?
Yes. In early 1973, the Daily officially severed its ties with the ASSU and
incorporated as a non-profit California corporation. We want to see that
status maintained. Receiving this money won't make us less independent, any
more than the New York Times surrenders its independence because its
readers pay to receive it.
The Daily is still committed to maintaining close contact with the
community it serves. Our Board of Directors wants to put out a product of

service and value to our entire readership. In short, we'll be under no one's
thumb, but will remain dedicated to our community.
What Has The Daily Done To Reduce Its Expenses?
Plainly speaking, we have tried to cut costs wherever we can.
We've limited the number of long distance phone calls our reporters make
for stories. We hold working luncheons for our editorial staff twice a month
now, instead of every week as in the past. Previously low editorial salaries
have been cut back even further. Dilapidated typewriters go unrepaired and
unreplaced. Two or three editors now share almost every desk. And even
essential supplies such as pencils are severely rationed.
Unfortunately, though, most of our expenses are fixed and simply cannot
be reduced. For example, there is no way the Daily can cut its bills for
printing and typesetting. And printing and typesetting account for fully 60
percent of our annual budget. The budget is now about as lean as we can
make it without harming the paper.

What Has The Daily Done To Generate Extra Income?
Since 1973, the Daily has published special football editions at all
Stanford home games. For the past two years we have published the official
program for home basketball games. The Daily has also instituted special
"theme" issues covering such topics as photography, travel, skiing, stereo,
books and San Francisco. All of these projects were designed as
money-making ventures, and all have been profitable. The football issues, in
fact, netted nearly $1000 this fall, preventing the Daily's autumn-quarter
losses from assuming astronomical proportions.
We have also instituted several advertising innovations. Special shopping
district pages — including some in color — provide an especially attractive
format for groups of advertisers, and cash discounts are available to
advertisers who place the same ad on Friday and any other day of the week.
Why Doesn't The Daily Sell Individual Subscriptions?
The only way the Daily could sell individual subscriptions and still remain
afloat financially would be to charge its readers outrageously high rates —
perhaps as much as 20 cents a copy — as opposed to the 1.7 cents we're

Vote YES Wednesday And Thursday -- We Need Your Support To Survive

seeking. Even then, breaking even would be extremely difficult.
Currently, the Daily is a bargain for advertisers. The paper is distributed
throughout the campus, insuring a readership of nearly 23,000. If we sold
individual subscriptions, however, circulation would drop drastically, forcing
the Daily to charge a proportionately lower rate for advertising. (The Harvard
Crimson, which sells its paper for 15 cents a copy, now has a circulation of
barely 1000.) Distribution costs would also rise, and Daily readers would be
overcharged and inconvenienced.
If students approve the fee assessment, the Daily will be able to maintain
or improve its present advertising and distribution schedules.
(We do, of course, already sell mail subscriptions to off-campus readers.)
Why Doesn't The Daily Print Four-Page Papers Or Publish Fewer
Than Five Days A Week?
We have ruled out four-page papers for both editorial and business reasons.
It is absolutely impossible to squeeze a worthwhile amount of information
into a four-page Daily. Departments such as sports, features and
entertainment would be limited to one or two stories per paper, or would get
no space at all. Public service items such as the free Once Around The Quad
announcement section might fall by the wayside.
Our advertising salesmen tell us that four-page papers are not a saleable
commodity — businessmen simply won't place ads in a newspaper that looks
like a throw-away shopper.
Similarly, publishing fewer than five days a week would reduce the quality
as well as the quantity of service we provide to the Stanford community. A
major source of the paper's credibility with advertisers is its status as a daily
paper; an irregular publishing schedule would make the Daily far less
attractive to potential advertisers.
Why Does The Daily Pay Editors, Reporters And Photographers?
The Daily spends approximately $18,000 a year on editorial salaries. The
highest salaries autumn quarter were earned by the editor and managing
editor, each of whom received $300. Both individuals worked in excess of 55
hours a week during the quarter, in addition to considerable work during
vacations. Figuring 50 hours of vacation work, the $300 quarterly salaries
translate to only 50 cents an hour. Because of budget cutbacks, the current
editor and managing editor are making even less, while other salaries range
from $20 to $200 per quarter.
We think the salaries are justified. Students receive no academic credit for
working on the paper, and a number of Daily staffers simply could not spend
as much time as they do without at least minimal monetary compensation.
Without the salaries, many hard-working staffers have said they would be
forced to seek part-time employment elsewhere, which would drastically cut
down the number of hours they could work on the paper.
Other college papers, including the University of Texas Daily and the
Michigan State Daily, spend over $50,000 annually on editorial salaries, while
the Minnesota Daily spends $200,000 a year to pay its staffers.
Will The Daily Seek Another Fee Assessment Next Year? What
Are The Daily's Future Financial Plans?
If we have learned anything from the last few years, it is the futility of
looking very far into the future with any degree of confidence. But, if
economic conditions do not improve considerably, we will almost certainly
be required to seek another fee assessment next year. Hopefully, we won't
have to ask for as much money as we are requesting this year, but we can't be
at all sure.
That's not to say we've halted our efforts to find alternative sources of
revenue. We are currently negotiating with the University for the rights to
publish a freshman orientation issue each summer containing University
announcements, articles of interest to incoming students and a hefty number
of advertisements from businesses anxious to have their first crack at a new
audience.
An organization known as "Friends of the Daily" is also beginning work
on raising an endowment fund for the paper. We have already made plans to
hold a fundraising dinner for former editors, managing editors and business
managers next autumn. We will take on as many other editorial projects as we
can in order to generate extra income. The only limiting factor will be the
work capacity of our staff.
What Will Happen To The Daily If The Fee Assessment Fails?
We'll fold.

Many of the 50 largest daily college and university newspapers receive well
over $50,000 a year in student fees. We are asking for substantially less than
that, and are convinced that we need every bit of it in order to continue
publishing for another year.
The decision to seek these fees was not made hastily or lightly. Our Board
of Directors's a responsible group of people comprised of law student Diane
Fields, Daily Advertising Manager Lee Hanley, Attorney William Kartozian,
Daily Business Manager Michael Kuhl, San Francisco Chronicle Editorial Page
Editor Templeton Peck, Communication Prof. William Rivers, Daily Editor
Kevin Smith and former Daily Editor Jim Wascher. The Board determined,
after careful consideration, that the requested fees are the only way to keep
the Daily in operation for another year.
We have been asked many of the following questions during our recent
petition drive to put the assessment on the ballot. If we have not answered
your question, please feel free to contact Kevin Smith, Jim Wascher, Rich
Jaroslovsky or Dave Robinson at 497-4632.
Who Pays For The Daily Now?
During the current school year, the Daily is receiving $17,500 from the
University administration to pay for faculty and staff copies. Otherwise,
we're subsisting almost solely off of advertising revenues; students haven't
paid for the paper since fall quarter of 1973.
Since the paper will lose around $15,000 this year, despite the
administration subsidy, we will have to use money from our cash reserves to
cover the deficit. Those reserves are currently only $20,000, and covering this
year's losses will leave us with enough to cover only a fraction of next year's
estimated $31,000 deficit.
What Happened To The Statements Of Three Years Ago That The
Daily Would Be Entirely Self-Sufficient By Next Year?
Basically, the Daily and University officials planning independence simply
couldn't foresee the current economic climate.
Printing costs — our largest single expenditure — have climbed enormously
in recent years. Due to rising costs of labor and material, not to mention
spiraling inflation, the cost of printing the paper has shot up 20 percent in
one year, with more to come in 1975-76. Installation of the Centrex phone
system has caused a substantial increase in our monthly phone bills. In
addition, office supplies, equipment, utilities and maintenance costs have all
risen dramatically. We've already raised our advertising rates, and have in fact
increased our total ad lineage — but we just can't keep pace with skyrocketing
costs.
If This Fee Assessment Passes, Will The Daily Still Be
Independent?
Yes. In early 1973, the Daily officially severed its ties with the ASSU and
incorporated as a non-profit California corporation. We want to see that
status maintained. Receiving this money won't make us less independent, any
more than the New York Times surrenders its independence because its
readers pay to receive it.
The Daily is still committed to maintaining close contact with the
community it serves. Our Board of Directors wants to put out a product of

service and value to our entire readership. In short, we'll be under no one's
thumb, but will remain dedicated to our community.
What Has The Daily Done To Reduce Its Expenses?
Plainly speaking, we have tried to cut costs wherever we can.
We've limited the number of long distance phone calls our reporters make
for stories. We hold working luncheons for our editorial staff twice a month
now, instead of every week as in the past. Previously low editorial salaries
have been cut back even further. Dilapidated typewriters go unrepaired and
unreplaced. Two or three editors now share almost every desk. And even
essential supplies such as pencils are severely rationed.
Unfortunately, though, most of our expenses are fixed and simply cannot
be reduced. For example, there is no way the Daily can cut its bills for
printing and typesetting. And printing and typesetting account for fully 60
percent of our annual budget. The budget is now about as lean as we can
make it without harming the paper.

What Has The Daily Done To Generate Extra Income?
Since 1973, the Daily has published special football editions at all
Stanford home games. For the past two years we have published the official
program for home basketball games. The Daily has also instituted special
"theme" issues covering such topics as photography, travel, skiing, stereo,
books and San Francisco. All of these projects were designed as
money-making ventures, and all have been profitable. The football issues, in
fact, netted nearly $1000 this fall, preventing the Daily's autumn-quarter
losses from assuming astronomical proportions.
We have also instituted several advertising innovations. Special shopping
district pages — including some in color — provide an especially attractive
format for groups of advertisers, and cash discounts are available to
advertisers who place the same ad on Friday and any other day of the week.
Why Doesn't The Daily Sell Individual Subscriptions?
The only way the Daily could sell individual subscriptions and still remain
afloat financially would be to charge its readers outrageously high rates —
perhaps as much as 20 cents a copy — as opposed to the 1.7 cents we're

Vote YES Wednesday And Thursday -- We Need Your Support To Survive

seeking. Even then, breaking even would be extremely difficult.
Currently, the Daily is a bargain for advertisers. The paper is distributed
throughout the campus, insuring a readership of nearly 23,000. If we sold
individual subscriptions, however, circulation would drop drastically, forcing
the Daily to charge a proportionately lower rate for advertising. (The Harvard
Crimson, which sells its paper for 15 cents a copy, now has a circulation of
barely 1000.) Distribution costs would also rise, and Daily readers would be
overcharged and inconvenienced.
If students approve the fee assessment, the Daily will be able to maintain
or improve its present advertising and distribution schedules.
(We do, of course, already sell mail subscriptions to off-campus readers.)
Why Doesn't The Daily Print Four-Page Papers Or Publish Fewer
Than Five Days A Week?
We have ruled out four-page papers for both editorial and business reasons.
It is absolutely impossible to squeeze a worthwhile amount of information
into a four-page Daily. Departments such as sports, features and
entertainment would be limited to one or two stories per paper, or would get
no space at all. Public service items such as the free Once Around The Quad
announcement section might fall by the wayside.
Our advertising salesmen tell us that four-page papers are not a saleable
commodity — businessmen simply won't place ads in a newspaper that looks
like a throw-away shopper.
Similarly, publishing fewer than five days a week would reduce the quality
as well as the quantity of service we provide to the Stanford community. A
major source of the paper's credibility with advertisers is its status as a daily
paper; an irregular publishing schedule would make the Daily far less
attractive to potential advertisers.
Why Does The Daily Pay Editors, Reporters And Photographers?
The Daily spends approximately $18,000 a year on editorial salaries. The
highest salaries autumn quarter were earned by the editor and managing
editor, each of whom received $300. Both individuals worked in excess of 55
hours a week during the quarter, in addition to considerable work during
vacations. Figuring 50 hours of vacation work, the $300 quarterly salaries
translate to only 50 cents an hour. Because of budget cutbacks, the current
editor and managing editor are making even less, while other salaries range
from $20 to $200 per quarter.
We think the salaries are justified. Students receive no academic credit for
working on the paper, and a number of Daily staffers simply could not spend
as much time as they do without at least minimal monetary compensation.
Without the salaries, many hard-working staffers have said they would be
forced to seek part-time employment elsewhere, which would drastically cut
down the number of hours they could work on the paper.
Other college papers, including the University of Texas Daily and the
Michigan State Daily, spend over $50,000 annually on editorial salaries, while
the Minnesota Daily spends $200,000 a year to pay its staffers.
Will The Daily Seek Another Fee Assessment Next Year? What
Are The Daily's Future Financial Plans?
If we have learned anything from the last few years, it is the futility of
looking very far into the future with any degree of confidence. But, if
economic conditions do not improve considerably, we will almost certainly
be required to seek another fee assessment next year. Hopefully, we won't
have to ask for as much money as we are requesting this year, but we can't be
at all sure.
That's not to say we've halted our efforts to find alternative sources of
revenue. We are currently negotiating with the University for the rights to
publish a freshman orientation issue each summer containing University
announcements, articles of interest to incoming students and a hefty number
of advertisements from businesses anxious to have their first crack at a new
audience.
An organization known as "Friends of the Daily" is also beginning work
on raising an endowment fund for the paper. We have already made plans to
hold a fundraising dinner for former editors, managing editors and business
managers next autumn. We will take on as many other editorial projects as we
can in order to generate extra income. The only limiting factor will be the
work capacity of our staff.
What Will Happen To The Daily If The Fee Assessment Fails?
We'll fold.
The Board of Directors of the Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation has
decided to seek a fee assessment of $1 per student for each of autumn, winter
and summer quarters. We Would like to explain this decision to you.
Despite a steady increase in revenue from advertising, the Daily has not
been able to make ends meet because of substantial increases in operating
costs.
The Daily's projected deficit for 1975-76 is nearly $31,000. If the
assessment is passed, we expect to collect approximately $10,000 from the
students each of fall and winter quarters, and approximately $4000 summer
quarter 1976 — a total of $24,000.
We have promised that we will not collect any of this student money
unless the University pays us $10,000 for copies of the Daily read by the
faculty and staff. Both the student and University fees represent an average
cost of 1.7 cents per issue. (The cost is even less for students who will not be
here summer quarter 1976.) We will not collect one fee without the other.
This means that students will not pay for copies of the Daily read by faculty
and staff.
The combined amount that we are seeking from students and the
University totals $34,000 — enough to cover our $31,000 projected deficit
plus a 10 percent contingency reserve.

paid for the paper since fall quarter of 1973.
Since the paper will lose around $15,000 this year, despite the
administration subsidy, we will have to use money from our cash reserves to
cover the deficit. Those reserves are currently only $20,000, and covering this
year's losses will leave us with enough to cover only a fraction of next year's
estimated $31,000 deficit.
What Happened To The Statements Of Three Years Ago That The
Daily Would Be Entirely Self-Sufficient By Next Year?
Basically, the Daily and University officials planning independence simply
couldn't foresee the current economic climate.
Printing costs — our largest single expenditure — have climbed enormously
in recent years. Due to rising costs of labor and material, not to mention
spiraling inflation, the cost of printing the paper has shot up 20 percent in
one year, with more to come in 1975-76. Installation of the Centrex phone
system has caused a substantial increase in our monthly phone bills. In
addition, office supplies, equipment, utilities and maintenance costs have all
risen dramatically. We've already raised our advertising rates, and have in fact
increased our total ad lineage — but we just can't keep pace with skyrocketing
costs.
If This Fee Assessment Passes, Will The Daily Still Be
Independent?
Yes. In early 1973, the Daily officially severed its ties with the ASSU and
incorporated as a non-profit California corporation. We want to see that
status maintained. Receiving this money won't make us less independent, any
more than the New York Times surrenders its independence because its
readers pay to receive it.
The Daily is still committed to maintaining close contact with the
community it serves. Our Board of Directors wants to put out a product of

service and value to our entire readership. In short, we'll be under no one's
thumb, but will remain dedicated to our community.
What Has The Daily Done To Reduce Its Expenses?
Plainly speaking, we have tried to cut costs wherever we can.
We've limited the number of long distance phone calls our reporters make
for stories. We hold working luncheons for our editorial staff twice a month
now, instead of every week as in the past. Previously low editorial salaries
have been cut back even further. Dilapidated typewriters go unrepaired and
unreplaced. Two or three editors now share almost every desk. And even
essential supplies such as pencils are severely rationed.
Unfortunately, though, most of our expenses are fixed and simply cannot
be reduced. For example, there is no way the Daily can cut its bills for
printing and typesetting. And printing and typesetting account for fully 60
percent of our annual budget. The budget is now about as lean as we can
make it without harming the paper.

What Has The Daily Done To Generate Extra Income?
Since 1973, the Daily has published special football editions at all
Stanford home games. For the past two years we have published the official
program for home basketball games. The Daily has also instituted special
"theme" issues covering such topics as photography, travel, skiing, stereo,
books and San Francisco. All of these projects were designed as
money-making ventures, and all have been profitable. The football issues, in
fact, netted nearly $1000 this fall, preventing the Daily's autumn-quarter
losses from assuming astronomical proportions.
We have also instituted several advertising innovations. Special shopping
district pages — including some in color — provide an especially attractive
format for groups of advertisers, and cash discounts are available to
advertisers who place the same ad on Friday and any other day of the week.
Why Doesn't The Daily Sell Individual Subscriptions?
The only way the Daily could sell individual subscriptions and still remain
afloat financially would be to charge its readers outrageously high rates —
perhaps as much as 20 cents a copy — as opposed to the 1.7 cents we're

Vote YES Wednesday And Thursday -- We Need Your Support To Survive

seeking. Even then, breaking even would be extremely difficult.
Currently, the Daily is a bargain for advertisers. The paper is distributed
throughout the campus, insuring a readership of nearly 23,000. If we sold
individual subscriptions, however, circulation would drop drastically, forcing
the Daily to charge a proportionately lower rate for advertising. (The Harvard
Crimson, which sells its paper for 15 cents a copy, now has a circulation of
barely 1000.) Distribution costs would also rise, and Daily readers would be
overcharged and inconvenienced.
If students approve the fee assessment, the Daily will be able to maintain
or improve its present advertising and distribution schedules.
(We do, of course, already sell mail subscriptions to off-campus readers.)
Why Doesn't The Daily Print Four-Page Papers Or Publish Fewer
Than Five Days A Week?
We have ruled out four-page papers for both editorial and business reasons.
It is absolutely impossible to squeeze a worthwhile amount of information
into a four-page Daily. Departments such as sports, features and
entertainment would be limited to one or two stories per paper, or would get
no space at all. Public service items such as the free Once Around The Quad
announcement section might fall by the wayside.
Our advertising salesmen tell us that four-page papers are not a saleable
commodity — businessmen simply won't place ads in a newspaper that looks
like a throw-away shopper.
Similarly, publishing fewer than five days a week would reduce the quality
as well as the quantity of service we provide to the Stanford community. A
major source of the paper's credibility with advertisers is its status as a daily
paper; an irregular publishing schedule would make the Daily far less
attractive to potential advertisers.
Why Does The Daily Pay Editors, Reporters And Photographers?
The Daily spends approximately $18,000 a year on editorial salaries. The
highest salaries autumn quarter were earned by the editor and managing
editor, each of whom received $300. Both individuals worked in excess of 55
hours a week during the quarter, in addition to considerable work during
vacations. Figuring 50 hours of vacation work, the $300 quarterly salaries
translate to only 50 cents an hour. Because of budget cutbacks, the current
editor and managing editor are making even less, while other salaries range
from $20 to $200 per quarter.
We think the salaries are justified. Students receive no academic credit for
working on the paper, and a number of Daily staffers simply could not spend
as much time as they do without at least minimal monetary compensation.
Without the salaries, many hard-working staffers have said they would be
forced to seek part-time employment elsewhere, which would drastically cut
down the number of hours they could work on the paper.
Other college papers, including the University of Texas Daily and the
Michigan State Daily, spend over $50,000 annually on editorial salaries, while
the Minnesota Daily spends $200,000 a year to pay its staffers.
Will The Daily Seek Another Fee Assessment Next Year? What
Are The Daily's Future Financial Plans?
If we have learned anything from the last few years, it is the futility of
looking very far into the future with any degree of confidence. But, if
economic conditions do not improve considerably, we will almost certainly
be required to seek another fee assessment next year. Hopefully, we won't
have to ask for as much money as we are requesting this year, but we can't be
at all sure.
That's not to say we've halted our efforts to find alternative sources of
revenue. We are currently negotiating with the University for the rights to
publish a freshman orientation issue each summer containing University
announcements, articles of interest to incoming students and a hefty number
of advertisements from businesses anxious to have their first crack at a new
audience.
An organization known as "Friends of the Daily" is also beginning work
on raising an endowment fund for the paper. We have already made plans to
hold a fundraising dinner for former editors, managing editors and business
managers next autumn. We will take on as many other editorial projects as we
can in order to generate extra income. The only limiting factor will be the
work capacity of our staff.
What Will Happen To The Daily If The Fee Assessment Fails?
We'll fold.
The Board of Directors of the Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation has
decided to seek a fee assessment of $1 per student for each of autumn, winter
and summer quarters. We Would like to explain this decision to you.
Despite a steady increase in revenue from advertising, the Daily has not
been able to make ends meet because of substantial increases in operating
costs.
The Daily's projected deficit for 1975-76 is nearly $31,000. If the
assessment is passed, we expect to collect approximately $10,000 from the
students each of fall and winter quarters, and approximately $4000 summer
quarter 1976 — a total of $24,000.
We have promised that we will not collect any of this student money
unless the University pays us $10,000 for copies of the Daily read by the
faculty and staff. Both the student and University fees represent an average
cost of 1.7 cents per issue. (The cost is even less for students who will not be
here summer quarter 1976.) We will not collect one fee without the other.
This means that students will not pay for copies of the Daily read by faculty
and staff.
The combined amount that we are seeking from students and the
University totals $34,000 — enough to cover our $31,000 projected deficit
plus a 10 percent contingency reserve.
Many of the 50 largest daily college and university newspapers receive well
over $50,000 a year in student fees. We are asking for substantially less than
that, and are convinced that we need every bit of it in order to continue
publishing for another year.
The decision to seek these fees was not made hastily or lightly. Our Board
of Directors's a responsible group of people comprised of law student Diane
Fields, Daily Advertising Manager Lee Hanley, Attorney William Kartozian,
Daily Business Manager Michael Kuhl, San Francisco Chronicle Editorial Page
Editor Templeton Peck, Communication Prof. William Rivers, Daily Editor
Kevin Smith and former Daily Editor Jim Wascher. The Board determined,
after careful consideration, that the requested fees are the only way to keep
the Daily in operation for another year.
We have been asked many of the following questions during our recent
petition drive to put the assessment on the ballot. If we have not answered
your question, please feel free to contact Kevin Smith, Jim Wascher, Rich
Jaroslovsky or Dave Robinson at 497-4632.
Who Pays For The Daily Now?
During the current school year, the Daily is receiving $17,500 from the
University administration to pay for faculty and staff copies. Otherwise,
we're subsisting almost solely off of advertising revenues; students haven't
paid for the paper since fall quarter of 1973.
Since the paper will lose around $15,000 this year, despite the
administration subsidy, we will have to use money from our cash reserves to

Yes. In early 1973, the Daily officially severed its ties with the ASSU and
incorporated as a non-profit California corporation. We want to see that
status maintained. Receiving this money won't make us less independent, any
more than the New York Times surrenders its independence because its
readers pay to receive it.
The Daily is still committed to maintaining close contact with the
community it serves. Our Board of Directors wants to put out a product of

service and value to our entire readership. In short, we'll be under no one's
thumb, but will remain dedicated to our community.
What Has The Daily Done To Reduce Its Expenses?
Plainly speaking, we have tried to cut costs wherever we can.
We've limited the number of long distance phone calls our reporters make
for stories. We hold working luncheons for our editorial staff twice a month
now, instead of every week as in the past. Previously low editorial salaries
have been cut back even further. Dilapidated typewriters go unrepaired and
unreplaced. Two or three editors now share almost every desk. And even
essential supplies such as pencils are severely rationed.
Unfortunately, though, most of our expenses are fixed and simply cannot
be reduced. For example, there is no way the Daily can cut its bills for
printing and typesetting. And printing and typesetting account for fully 60
percent of our annual budget. The budget is now about as lean as we can
make it without harming the paper.

What Has The Daily Done To Generate Extra Income?
Since 1973, the Daily has published special football editions at all
Stanford home games. For the past two years we have published the official
program for home basketball games. The Daily has also instituted special
"theme" issues covering such topics as photography, travel, skiing, stereo,
books and San Francisco. All of these projects were designed as
money-making ventures, and all have been profitable. The football issues, in
fact, netted nearly $1000 this fall, preventing the Daily's autumn-quarter
losses from assuming astronomical proportions.
We have also instituted several advertising innovations. Special shopping
district pages — including some in color — provide an especially attractive
format for groups of advertisers, and cash discounts are available to
advertisers who place the same ad on Friday and any other day of the week.
Why Doesn't The Daily Sell Individual Subscriptions?
The only way the Daily could sell individual subscriptions and still remain
afloat financially would be to charge its readers outrageously high rates —
perhaps as much as 20 cents a copy — as opposed to the 1.7 cents we're

Vote YES Wednesday And Thursday -- We Need Your Support To Survive

seeking. Even then, breaking even would be extremely difficult.
Currently, the Daily is a bargain for advertisers. The paper is distributed
throughout the campus, insuring a readership of nearly 23,000. If we sold
individual subscriptions, however, circulation would drop drastically, forcing
the Daily to charge a proportionately lower rate for advertising. (The Harvard
Crimson, which sells its paper for 15 cents a copy, now has a circulation of
barely 1000.) Distribution costs would also rise, and Daily readers would be
overcharged and inconvenienced.
If students approve the fee assessment, the Daily will be able to maintain
or improve its present advertising and distribution schedules.
(We do, of course, already sell mail subscriptions to off-campus readers.)
Why Doesn't The Daily Print Four-Page Papers Or Publish Fewer
Than Five Days A Week?
We have ruled out four-page papers for both editorial and business reasons.
It is absolutely impossible to squeeze a worthwhile amount of information
into a four-page Daily. Departments such as sports, features and
entertainment would be limited to one or two stories per paper, or would get
no space at all. Public service items such as the free Once Around The Quad
announcement section might fall by the wayside.
Our advertising salesmen tell us that four-page papers are not a saleable
commodity — businessmen simply won't place ads in a newspaper that looks
like a throw-away shopper.
Similarly, publishing fewer than five days a week would reduce the quality
as well as the quantity of service we provide to the Stanford community. A
major source of the paper's credibility with advertisers is its status as a daily
paper; an irregular publishing schedule would make the Daily far less
attractive to potential advertisers.
Why Does The Daily Pay Editors, Reporters And Photographers?
The Daily spends approximately $18,000 a year on editorial salaries. The
highest salaries autumn quarter were earned by the editor and managing
editor, each of whom received $300. Both individuals worked in excess of 55
hours a week during the quarter, in addition to considerable work during
vacations. Figuring 50 hours of vacation work, the $300 quarterly salaries
translate to only 50 cents an hour. Because of budget cutbacks, the current
editor and managing editor are making even less, while other salaries range
from $20 to $200 per quarter.
We think the salaries are justified. Students receive no academic credit for
working on the paper, and a number of Daily staffers simply could not spend
as much time as they do without at least minimal monetary compensation.
Without the salaries, many hard-working staffers have said they would be
forced to seek part-time employment elsewhere, which would drastically cut
down the number of hours they could work on the paper.
Other college papers, including the University of Texas Daily and the
Michigan State Daily, spend over $50,000 annually on editorial salaries, while
the Minnesota Daily spends $200,000 a year to pay its staffers.
Will The Daily Seek Another Fee Assessment Next Year? What
Are The Daily's Future Financial Plans?
If we have learned anything from the last few years, it is the futility of
looking very far into the future with any degree of confidence. But, if
economic conditions do not improve considerably, we will almost certainly
be required to seek another fee assessment next year. Hopefully, we won't
have to ask for as much money as we are requesting this year, but we can't be
at all sure.
That's not to say we've halted our efforts to find alternative sources of
revenue. We are currently negotiating with the University for the rights to
publish a freshman orientation issue each summer containing University
announcements, articles of interest to incoming students and a hefty number
of advertisements from businesses anxious to have their first crack at a new
audience.
An organization known as "Friends of the Daily" is also beginning work
on raising an endowment fund for the paper. We have already made plans to
hold a fundraising dinner for former editors, managing editors and business
managers next autumn. We will take on as many other editorial projects as we
can in order to generate extra income. The only limiting factor will be the
work capacity of our staff.
What Will Happen To The Daily If The Fee Assessment Fails?
We'll fold.
The Board of Directors of the Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation has
decided to seek a fee assessment of $1 per student for each of autumn, winter
and summer quarters. We Would like to explain this decision to you.
Despite a steady increase in revenue from advertising, the Daily has not
been able to make ends meet because of substantial increases in operating
costs.
The Daily's projected deficit for 1975-76 is nearly $31,000. If the
assessment is passed, we expect to collect approximately $10,000 from the
students each of fall and winter quarters, and approximately $4000 summer
quarter 1976 — a total of $24,000.
We have promised that we will not collect any of this student money
unless the University pays us $10,000 for copies of the Daily read by the
faculty and staff. Both the student and University fees represent an average
cost of 1.7 cents per issue. (The cost is even less for students who will not be
here summer quarter 1976.) We will not collect one fee without the other.
This means that students will not pay for copies of the Daily read by faculty
and staff.
The combined amount that we are seeking from students and the
University totals $34,000 — enough to cover our $31,000 projected deficit
plus a 10 percent contingency reserve.
Many of the 50 largest daily college and university newspapers receive well
over $50,000 a year in student fees. We are asking for substantially less than
that, and are convinced that we need every bit of it in order to continue
publishing for another year.
The decision to seek these fees was not made hastily or lightly. Our Board
of Directors's a responsible group of people comprised of law student Diane
Fields, Daily Advertising Manager Lee Hanley, Attorney William Kartozian,
Daily Business Manager Michael Kuhl, San Francisco Chronicle Editorial Page
Editor Templeton Peck, Communication Prof. William Rivers, Daily Editor
Kevin Smith and former Daily Editor Jim Wascher. The Board determined,
after careful consideration, that the requested fees are the only way to keep
the Daily in operation for another year.
We have been asked many of the following questions during our recent
petition drive to put the assessment on the ballot. If we have not answered
your question, please feel free to contact Kevin Smith, Jim Wascher, Rich
Jaroslovsky or Dave Robinson at 497-4632.
Who Pays For The Daily Now?
During the current school year, the Daily is receiving $17,500 from the
University administration to pay for faculty and staff copies. Otherwise,
we're subsisting almost solely off of advertising revenues; students haven't
paid for the paper since fall quarter of 1973.
Since the paper will lose around $15,000 this year, despite the
administration subsidy, we will have to use money from our cash reserves to
cover the deficit. Those reserves are currently only $20,000, and covering this
year's losses will leave us with enough to cover only a fraction of next year's
estimated $31,000 deficit.
What Happened To The Statements Of Three Years Ago That The
Daily Would Be Entirely Self-Sufficient By Next Year?
Basically, the Daily and University officials planning independence simply
couldn't foresee the current economic climate.
Printing costs — our largest single expenditure — have climbed enormously
in recent years. Due to rising costs of labor and material, not to mention
spiraling inflation, the cost of printing the paper has shot up 20 percent in
one year, with more to come in 1975-76. Installation of the Centrex phone
system has caused a substantial increase in our monthly phone bills. In
addition, office supplies, equipment, utilities and maintenance costs have all
risen dramatically. We've already raised our advertising rates, and have in fact
increased our total ad lineage — but we just can't keep pace with skyrocketing
costs.
If This Fee Assessment Passes, Will The Daily Still Be
Independent?
Yes. In early 1973, the Daily officially severed its ties with the ASSU and

make it without harming the paper.

What Has The Daily Done To Generate Extra Income?
Since 1973, the Daily has published special football editions at all
Stanford home games. For the past two years we have published the official
program for home basketball games. The Daily has also instituted special
"theme" issues covering such topics as photography, travel, skiing, stereo,
books and San Francisco. All of these projects were designed as
money-making ventures, and all have been profitable. The football issues, in
fact, netted nearly $1000 this fall, preventing the Daily's autumn-quarter
losses from assuming astronomical proportions.
We have also instituted several advertising innovations. Special shopping
district pages — including some in color — provide an especially attractive
format for groups of advertisers, and cash discounts are available to
advertisers who place the same ad on Friday and any other day of the week.
Why Doesn't The Daily Sell Individual Subscriptions?
The only way the Daily could sell individual subscriptions and still remain
afloat financially would be to charge its readers outrageously high rates —
perhaps as much as 20 cents a copy — as opposed to the 1.7 cents we're

Vote YES Wednesday And Thursday -- We Need Your Support To Survive

seeking. Even then, breaking even would be extremely difficult.
Currently, the Daily is a bargain for advertisers. The paper is distributed
throughout the campus, insuring a readership of nearly 23,000. If we sold
individual subscriptions, however, circulation would drop drastically, forcing
the Daily to charge a proportionately lower rate for advertising. (The Harvard
Crimson, which sells its paper for 15 cents a copy, now has a circulation of
barely 1000.) Distribution costs would also rise, and Daily readers would be
overcharged and inconvenienced.
If students approve the fee assessment, the Daily will be able to maintain
or improve its present advertising and distribution schedules.
(We do, of course, already sell mail subscriptions to off-campus readers.)
Why Doesn't The Daily Print Four-Page Papers Or Publish Fewer
Than Five Days A Week?
We have ruled out four-page papers for both editorial and business reasons.
It is absolutely impossible to squeeze a worthwhile amount of information
into a four-page Daily. Departments such as sports, features and
entertainment would be limited to one or two stories per paper, or would get
no space at all. Public service items such as the free Once Around The Quad
announcement section might fall by the wayside.
Our advertising salesmen tell us that four-page papers are not a saleable
commodity — businessmen simply won't place ads in a newspaper that looks
like a throw-away shopper.
Similarly, publishing fewer than five days a week would reduce the quality
as well as the quantity of service we provide to the Stanford community. A
major source of the paper's credibility with advertisers is its status as a daily
paper; an irregular publishing schedule would make the Daily far less
attractive to potential advertisers.
Why Does The Daily Pay Editors, Reporters And Photographers?
The Daily spends approximately $18,000 a year on editorial salaries. The
highest salaries autumn quarter were earned by the editor and managing
editor, each of whom received $300. Both individuals worked in excess of 55
hours a week during the quarter, in addition to considerable work during
vacations. Figuring 50 hours of vacation work, the $300 quarterly salaries
translate to only 50 cents an hour. Because of budget cutbacks, the current
editor and managing editor are making even less, while other salaries range
from $20 to $200 per quarter.
We think the salaries are justified. Students receive no academic credit for
working on the paper, and a number of Daily staffers simply could not spend
as much time as they do without at least minimal monetary compensation.
Without the salaries, many hard-working staffers have said they would be
forced to seek part-time employment elsewhere, which would drastically cut
down the number of hours they could work on the paper.
Other college papers, including the University of Texas Daily and the
Michigan State Daily, spend over $50,000 annually on editorial salaries, while
the Minnesota Daily spends $200,000 a year to pay its staffers.
Will The Daily Seek Another Fee Assessment Next Year? What
Are The Daily's Future Financial Plans?
If we have learned anything from the last few years, it is the futility of
looking very far into the future with any degree of confidence. But, if
economic conditions do not improve considerably, we will almost certainly
be required to seek another fee assessment next year. Hopefully, we won't
have to ask for as much money as we are requesting this year, but we can't be
at all sure.
That's not to say we've halted our efforts to find alternative sources of
revenue. We are currently negotiating with the University for the rights to
publish a freshman orientation issue each summer containing University
announcements, articles of interest to incoming students and a hefty number
of advertisements from businesses anxious to have their first crack at a new
audience.
An organization known as "Friends of the Daily" is also beginning work
on raising an endowment fund for the paper. We have already made plans to
hold a fundraising dinner for former editors, managing editors and business
managers next autumn. We will take on as many other editorial projects as we
can in order to generate extra income. The only limiting factor will be the
work capacity of our staff.
What Will Happen To The Daily If The Fee Assessment Fails?
We'll fold.
The Board of Directors of the Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation has
decided to seek a fee assessment of $1 per student for each of autumn, winter
and summer quarters. We Would like to explain this decision to you.
Despite a steady increase in revenue from advertising, the Daily has not
been able to make ends meet because of substantial increases in operating
costs.
The Daily's projected deficit for 1975-76 is nearly $31,000. If the
assessment is passed, we expect to collect approximately $10,000 from the
students each of fall and winter quarters, and approximately $4000 summer
quarter 1976 — a total of $24,000.
We have promised that we will not collect any of this student money
unless the University pays us $10,000 for copies of the Daily read by the
faculty and staff. Both the student and University fees represent an average
cost of 1.7 cents per issue. (The cost is even less for students who will not be
here summer quarter 1976.) We will not collect one fee without the other.
This means that students will not pay for copies of the Daily read by faculty
and staff.
The combined amount that we are seeking from students and the
University totals $34,000 — enough to cover our $31,000 projected deficit
plus a 10 percent contingency reserve.
Many of the 50 largest daily college and university newspapers receive well
over $50,000 a year in student fees. We are asking for substantially less than
that, and are convinced that we need every bit of it in order to continue
publishing for another year.
The decision to seek these fees was not made hastily or lightly. Our Board
of Directors's a responsible group of people comprised of law student Diane
Fields, Daily Advertising Manager Lee Hanley, Attorney William Kartozian,
Daily Business Manager Michael Kuhl, San Francisco Chronicle Editorial Page
Editor Templeton Peck, Communication Prof. William Rivers, Daily Editor
Kevin Smith and former Daily Editor Jim Wascher. The Board determined,
after careful consideration, that the requested fees are the only way to keep
the Daily in operation for another year.
We have been asked many of the following questions during our recent
petition drive to put the assessment on the ballot. If we have not answered
your question, please feel free to contact Kevin Smith, Jim Wascher, Rich
Jaroslovsky or Dave Robinson at 497-4632.
Who Pays For The Daily Now?
During the current school year, the Daily is receiving $17,500 from the
University administration to pay for faculty and staff copies. Otherwise,
we're subsisting almost solely off of advertising revenues; students haven't
paid for the paper since fall quarter of 1973.
Since the paper will lose around $15,000 this year, despite the
administration subsidy, we will have to use money from our cash reserves to
cover the deficit. Those reserves are currently only $20,000, and covering this
year's losses will leave us with enough to cover only a fraction of next year's
estimated $31,000 deficit.
What Happened To The Statements Of Three Years Ago That The
Daily Would Be Entirely Self-Sufficient By Next Year?
Basically, the Daily and University officials planning independence simply
couldn't foresee the current economic climate.
Printing costs — our largest single expenditure — have climbed enormously
in recent years. Due to rising costs of labor and material, not to mention
spiraling inflation, the cost of printing the paper has shot up 20 percent in
one year, with more to come in 1975-76. Installation of the Centrex phone
system has caused a substantial increase in our monthly phone bills. In
addition, office supplies, equipment, utilities and maintenance costs have all
risen dramatically. We've already raised our advertising rates, and have in fact
increased our total ad lineage — but we just can't keep pace with skyrocketing
costs.
If This Fee Assessment Passes, Will The Daily Still Be
Independent?
Yes. In early 1973, the Daily officially severed its ties with the ASSU and
incorporated as a non-profit California corporation. We want to see that
status maintained. Receiving this money won't make us less independent, any
more than the New York Times surrenders its independence because its
readers pay to receive it.
The Daily is still committed to maintaining close contact with the
community it serves. Our Board of Directors wants to put out a product of

service and value to our entire readership. In short, we'll be under no one's
thumb, but will remain dedicated to our community.
What Has The Daily Done To Reduce Its Expenses?
Plainly speaking, we have tried to cut costs wherever we can.
We've limited the number of long distance phone calls our reporters make
for stories. We hold working luncheons for our editorial staff twice a month
now, instead of every week as in the past. Previously low editorial salaries
have been cut back even further. Dilapidated typewriters go unrepaired and
unreplaced. Two or three editors now share almost every desk. And even
essential supplies such as pencils are severely rationed.
Unfortunately, though, most of our expenses are fixed and simply cannot
be reduced. For example, there is no way the Daily can cut its bills for
printing and typesetting. And printing and typesetting account for fully 60
percent of our annual budget. The budget is now about as lean as we can
make it without harming the paper.
