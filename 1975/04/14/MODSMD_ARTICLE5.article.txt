# 'Course Review' Editors Quit, Claim Lack Of Support Funds
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
The three members of the ASS (J
Course Review editorial staff officially
announced their resignations
yesterday, citing as reasons a lack both
of support from their policy board and
of funding.
However, the staff consisting of
Paul Sobotka, Valerie Tonat and Clifford
Schireson had not yet officially
informed Course Review Policy Board
Chairwoman Ann Carter nor Senate
Board members Debbi Silton, Bill
Hoke or Bob Nelson.
The Board, Schireson claimed, has
been counterproductive in its efforts
to help the staff with the Review's
publication. His major complaint,
shared by Sobotka and Tonat, is that
the Board members "don't understand
the function of the Review and have a
lot of dreams that are unresearched,
and fiscally unreasonable."
Discouraged By Senate
He cited the Policy Board's recent
wish to extend the Review's coverage
to all graduate and undergraduate
classes. This, he said, would run up a
bill of tens of thousands of dollars.
"We can't even find writers to cover
the courses now, since we can't pay
them," Tonat said.
According to Silton, however, the

Senate's vote did not signify a lack of
confidence in the staff or the Review.
"The Course Review is a mediocre
publication," said Silton. "We didn't
want to give it more money to make it
again a mediocre publication."
Instead, Silton said, the policy
board wished to reform the format of
the Course Review. She said they had
considered such changes as not letting
the professors see the raw data until
the final results had been compiled.
This with other changes, Silton said,
would make the Review a "real service
for students." She agreed with Nelson
that the editors had been "very hard
to work with because they seemed
unwilling to listen, and resistant to any
change of the Course Review's current
format."
Silton said that the Senate had
encouraged the editors to come back
to them with a plan of reform. "Then
we told them that we would plan an
ad hoc committee to study the Course
Review and give them $4000.
According to the editors, however,
they do not have time to formulate a
reform plan, and the Review cannot be
published this year without some
funding. They claim the $500 debt
that they inherited from last year's
staff and the new funding cut has

hampered them in finding more
writers and has made it impossible to
collect more advertising.
The staff plans to go before the
Senate again tonight to ask for funds
according to Schireson. If the Senate
pays the staff the salaries that it says
the Policy Board has promised them,
then they will turn over their materials
to the Senate. If the Senate decides to
fund them, the staff will finish the
Review, Tonat said.
