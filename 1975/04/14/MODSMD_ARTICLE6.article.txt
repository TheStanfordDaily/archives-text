# Hospital Employees Vote Against USE
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Stanford HospitaJ employees,
voting in five categories,
overwhelmingly rejected union
representation in elections conducted
Thursday through Saturday.
Nearly 1000 of the 1200 employees
who cast ballots opposed any union
representation.
Although United Stanford
Employees (USE) union leaders urged
workers to boycott the election
because of what they called unfair
hospital administration propaganda
techniques, nearly 85 percent of all
workers cast ballots.
The USE has filed unfair labor
practices charges against the hospital
with the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB). Union leaders say they
hope that the election can eventually
be rescheduled.
Not Surprised
Roland Finston, USE information
director, told the Daily last night that
union officials are not surprised by the
lack of response to the boycott.
He explained that the boycott was
called too late to allow union leaders
to present reasons for it.
Finston added that many workers
were so thoroughly indoctrinated by
the administration that they opposed
the union and acted against their best
interests.
"The materials circulated by the
hospital were designed to produce fear
and uncertainty," Finston claimed.
"In that setting, it was difficult to

weigh the benefits and risks of union
membership."
'Climate Of Fear'
According to Finston, workers were
told that unionization would cause
them to lose their jobs or take cuts in
pay. Some workers were told that the
union would be allowed to fire them
or that they would be forced to march
in picket lines, he said.
"In a climate of fear, it is
impossible to bring home to people
their common interests," Finston said.
Hospital officials have continually
denied USE's charges. John Schwartz,
counsel for medical affairs, last week
called the charges "absurd" and
expressed confidence that the NLRB
would declare them invalid and uphold
the results of last weekend's election.
Although Jim Berk, USE president,
last week predicted that part of the
heavy voter turnout on the first day of
the election might be attributable to
the casting of blank ballots, only 10 of
the 20 void ballots were blank.
Large Margins
Voters in almost every category
rejected union representation by large
margins.
The largest group — service,
technical, patient care and plant
clerical workers — voted 700-94 to
reject representation in collective
bargaining by USE.
Only three of the health care
professionals voted to support USE
while 55 opted for representation by
Stanford United Medical Technologists
and 119 voted to remain
unrepresented.
The only close contest occurred
among interns and residents, where
150 voted to remain unrepresented
and 144 voted for representation by
Stanford Housestaff Association.
Six pharmacists voted for no union

while only one voted for USE.
Of the licensed vocational nurses,
21 voted for no union, 16 voted for
the California Licensed Vocational
Nurses Association and none
supported USE.
Finston attributed part of the
hostility toward unionization toward
the opposition of the Black Advisory
Committee (BAC).
