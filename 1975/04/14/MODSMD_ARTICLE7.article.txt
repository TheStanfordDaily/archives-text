## COP Slate Stresses Involvement 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Fourth of Five Parts
Lee Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo,
Dave Galligan and Charlotte Germane
emphasize student involvement,
improved ASSU/student
communication and experience in
their campaign for the Council of
Presidents (COP).
According to their published
philosophy, the job of the COP "is to
act as a facilitator for students who
want to initiate student services, help
students cut administrative red tape
and defend student rights."
Germane has emphasized student
involvement in proposals such as peer
advising, establishing a women's
building, a SWOPSI course to examine
University financing and tuition
assessments, and ASSU-SCIRE task
forces "to provide in-depth research
into undergraduate education,
graduate education, student life at
Stanford and Stanford land use
policy."
There is currently "no student
opinion on these issues," Germane
noted. Rosenbaum added that,
"peop!e have expressed a willingness
to participate," if there is an
indication that the ASSU cares about
them.
Peer Advising
Germane explained that "every
entering undergraduate student should
have one faculty or administrative
adviser and one student adviser." She
said that peer advisers should also be
available to students on a
departmental level as is currently done
in human biology and engineering.
The women's building would house
various women's organizations "which
are currently scattered around the
campus," their platform states.

Jaramillo explained that peer advising,
the women's building, a Buying Guide
and the Course teview fit into her
slate's expanded definition of student
services.
The Stanford Community Buying
Guide would publish consumer
information on bikes, records, stereos,
groceries, cars, etc. and would be
"much more comprehensive than
PIRG's," Rosenbaum pointed out.
Both the Buying Guide and Course
Review would be free to the students,
according to the Rosenbaum slate's
proposal, though the former might be
sold to non-students, Germane said.
The Course Review would be
published quarterly at advanced
registration, instead of annually.
More Open-Minded
Jaramillo emphasized that her
slate's plan for communication
between the ASSU and the students
"is more open-ended than the survey"
method proposed by the Kevin
McDermott slate. She explained that
the "two-way student/ASSU
communication committee" would be
composed of one delegate from each
residence and off-campus
representatives. The committee would
serve as a "direct channel to the COP,
ASSU Senate and other committees"
and would allow "more student
originality" than surveys, she noted.
Concerning ASSU finances,
Jaramillo explained that her slate
proposes to "continue money-making
plans of the ASSU to fund services
that directly benefit most students,
"such as the Course Review."
Rosenbaum explained that while
the ASSU will receive $90,000 from
the University next year, this figure is
to be halved in 1976-77. University
support will be completely phased out

within a few years, he noted.
Rosenbaum attacked the
McDermott slate's proposal of making
each project break even, saying it
doesn't cover certain expenses such as
the operation of the ASSU office.
Experience
Galligan pointed out that this year's
profits were "extraordinary" and that
ASSU Special Events "won't be
making as much profit" next year.
The Rosenbaum slate is also
stressing its experience. "We've been
accomplishing things outside of the
COP" Germane noted.
"We've had to defend student rights
as opposed to what the administration
thinks is right for students," Jaramillo
added.
Rosenbaum pointed out that
members of slate have "been involved
with entities that they will come in
contact with as members of the COP."
For example, Rosenbaum, as ASSU
Senate chairman, has been a student
representative to the Faculty Senate.
Galligan has served on the ASSU
Nominations Committee and Germane
is an ASSU Senator.
They particularly emphasize the
experience they have gained defending
what they call "student rights." States
their platform: "We did not just
support the retention of SWOPSI &
SCIRE — we fought to save them. We
did not just oppose the financial aids
proposal — we rallied against it. We did
not just complain about
discriminatory parking fees — we
worked to sue the University."
Galligan noted that his slate was
especially interested in seeing graduate
students and foreign students
"represented in and participating in
the ASSU."

thinks is right for students," Jaramillo
added.
Rosenbaum pointed out that
members of slate have "been involved
with entities that they will come in
contact with as members of the COP."
For example, Rosenbaum, as ASSU
Senate chairman, has been a student
representative to the Faculty Senate.
Galligan has served on the ASSU
Nominations Committee and Germane
is an ASSU Senator.
They particularly emphasize the
experience they have gained defending
what they call "student rights." States
their platform: "We did not just
support the retention of SWOPSI &
SCIRE — we fought to save them. We
did not just oppose the financial aids
proposal — we rallied against it. We did
not just complain about
discriminatory parking fees — we
worked to sue the University."
Galligan noted that his slate was
especially interested in seeing graduate
students and foreign students
"represented in and participating in
the ASSU."

ROSENBAUM SLATE — Lee Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo, Dave Galligan and Charlotte Germane, shown at the
Aquafollies, emphasize experience and student involvement.
Fourth of Five Parts
Lee Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo,
Dave Galligan and Charlotte Germane
emphasize student involvement,
improved ASSU/student
communication and experience in
their campaign for the Council of
Presidents (COP).
According to their published
philosophy, the job of the COP "is to
act as a facilitator for students who
want to initiate student services, help
students cut administrative red tape
and defend student rights."
Germane has emphasized student
involvement in proposals such as peer
advising, establishing a women's
building, a SWOPSI course to examine
University financing and tuition
assessments, and ASSU-SCIRE task
forces "to provide in-depth research
into undergraduate education,
graduate education, student life at
Stanford and Stanford land use
policy."
There is currently "no student
opinion on these issues," Germane
noted. Rosenbaum added that,
"peop!e have expressed a willingness
to participate," if there is an
indication that the ASSU cares about
them.
Peer Advising
Germane explained that "every
entering undergraduate student should
have one faculty or administrative
adviser and one student adviser." She
said that peer advisers should also be
available to students on a
departmental level as is currently done
in human biology and engineering.
The women's building would house
various women's organizations "which
are currently scattered around the
campus," their platform states.

Jaramillo explained that peer advising,
the women's building, a Buying Guide
and the Course teview fit into her
slate's expanded definition of student
services.
The Stanford Community Buying
Guide would publish consumer
information on bikes, records, stereos,
groceries, cars, etc. and would be
"much more comprehensive than
PIRG's," Rosenbaum pointed out.
Both the Buying Guide and Course
Review would be free to the students,
according to the Rosenbaum slate's
proposal, though the former might be
sold to non-students, Germane said.
The Course Review would be
published quarterly at advanced
registration, instead of annually.
More Open-Minded
Jaramillo emphasized that her
slate's plan for communication
between the ASSU and the students
"is more open-ended than the survey"
method proposed by the Kevin
McDermott slate. She explained that
the "two-way student/ASSU
communication committee" would be
composed of one delegate from each
residence and off-campus
representatives. The committee would
serve as a "direct channel to the COP,
ASSU Senate and other committees"
and would allow "more student
originality" than surveys, she noted.
Concerning ASSU finances,
Jaramillo explained that her slate
proposes to "continue money-making
plans of the ASSU to fund services
that directly benefit most students,
"such as the Course Review."
Rosenbaum explained that while
the ASSU will receive $90,000 from
the University next year, this figure is
to be halved in 1976-77. University
support will be completely phased out

within a few years, he noted.
Rosenbaum attacked the
McDermott slate's proposal of making
each project break even, saying it
doesn't cover certain expenses such as
the operation of the ASSU office.
Experience
Galligan pointed out that this year's
profits were "extraordinary" and that
ASSU Special Events "won't be
making as much profit" next year.
The Rosenbaum slate is also
stressing its experience. "We've been
accomplishing things outside of the
COP" Germane noted.
"We've had to defend student rights

and would allow "more student
originality" than surveys, she noted.
Concerning ASSU finances,
Jaramillo explained that her slate
proposes to "continue money-making
plans of the ASSU to fund services
that directly benefit most students,
"such as the Course Review."
Rosenbaum explained that while
the ASSU will receive $90,000 from
the University next year, this figure is
to be halved in 1976-77. University
support will be completely phased out

within a few years, he noted.
Rosenbaum attacked the
McDermott slate's proposal of making
each project break even, saying it
doesn't cover certain expenses such as
the operation of the ASSU office.
Experience
Galligan pointed out that this year's
profits were "extraordinary" and that
ASSU Special Events "won't be
making as much profit" next year.
The Rosenbaum slate is also
stressing its experience. "We've been
accomplishing things outside of the
COP" Germane noted.
"We've had to defend student rights
as opposed to what the administration
thinks is right for students," Jaramillo
added.
Rosenbaum pointed out that
members of slate have "been involved
with entities that they will come in
contact with as members of the COP."
For example, Rosenbaum, as ASSU
Senate chairman, has been a student
representative to the Faculty Senate.
Galligan has served on the ASSU
Nominations Committee and Germane
is an ASSU Senator.
They particularly emphasize the
experience they have gained defending
what they call "student rights." States
their platform: "We did not just
support the retention of SWOPSI &
SCIRE — we fought to save them. We
did not just oppose the financial aids
proposal — we rallied against it. We did
not just complain about
discriminatory parking fees — we
worked to sue the University."
Galligan noted that his slate was
especially interested in seeing graduate
students and foreign students
"represented in and participating in
the ASSU."
