## Opinions editorials CJP Proposalâ€”NO 
### 
On April 23-24, students will once again have the
opportunity to vote on a proposal of the Committee of 15
(C-15) to reform the Campus judicial Panel (CjP). We
strongly urge a NO vote.
Almost annually, the C-15 comes Back with a proposal
for a new judicial system, telling students that, while the
new system is not perfect, it represents an improvement over
the current CJP, which was created by a fiat of President
Lyman in 1971.
We have invariably opposed each of these C-15 proposals
because they call for a faculty majority in some cases and
provide for a different system for selection of student and
faculty members. The new proposal still contains both of
these flaws.
Until these objectionable features are removed from the
student judicial system, we urge students selected for the
CJP to refuse to serve on the CJP as a sign that they are tired
of playing around with an unfair system.
The new plan retains a faculty majority in some cases.
Under the plan, students (through a student co-chairman on
the panel) will have a majority on CJP cases involving the
Honor Code. But the faculty will retain a majority in all
other cases.
Those other cases include ones in which the University
prosecutes students who protest University policies by
means which the University does not approve. Under the
new plan, faculty members voting as a bloc, could discipline
students without the consent of any student.
Secondly, under the new plan, student and faculty
members would still be chosen by different criteria. The
Faculty Senate's Committee on Committees could continue
to choose whomever it pleases, while the ASSU Senate could
only choosc students from a list of randomly generated
names. We reiterate our position that students are as
responsible as faculty members, and should be subjected to
the same kind of selection process.
The time may come when there will be some cases which
result in bloc votes. The time may come again when the
University tries to impede demonstrators through the CJP.
When that time comes, let's not allow the University to say
"disciplinary action was imposed through a system which
the students approved."
We realize that rejection of the proposal might mean that
the current CJP will exist forever. But the current system is
little worse than the proposal students will vote on.
We urge a NO vote to protest the two objectionable
features of the CJP. Until they are remedied, students
should never legitimize the present CJP or any of its
look-alikes.

Honor Code. But the faculty will retain a majority in all
other cases.
Those other cases include ones in which the University
prosecutes students who protest University policies by
means which the University does not approve. Under the
new plan, faculty members voting as a bloc, could discipline
students without the consent of any student.
Secondly, under the new plan, student and faculty
members would still be chosen by different criteria. The
Faculty Senate's Committee on Committees could continue
to choose whomever it pleases, while the ASSU Senate could
only choosc students from a list of randomly generated
names. We reiterate our position that students are as
responsible as faculty members, and should be subjected to
the same kind of selection process.
The time may come when there will be some cases which
result in bloc votes. The time may come again when the
University tries to impede demonstrators through the CJP.
When that time comes, let's not allow the University to say
"disciplinary action was imposed through a system which
the students approved."
We realize that rejection of the proposal might mean that
the current CJP will exist forever. But the current system is
little worse than the proposal students will vote on.
We urge a NO vote to protest the two objectionable
features of the CJP. Until they are remedied, students
should never legitimize the present CJP or any of its
look-alikes.
