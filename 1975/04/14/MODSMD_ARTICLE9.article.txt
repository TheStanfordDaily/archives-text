# Program Feeâ€”YES
## 
### 
We urge a YES vote on the $1 fee assessment requested
by the ASSU Senate for the ASSU Program Fee.
The Program Fee gives money to many campus
organizations which need a supplement to funds gained by
dues money. A large number of students benefit from the
organizations supported by the program fee, which include
academic, minority, political and religious groups.
We think that the opportunity for the expression of
pluralistic viewpoints is increased by the Program Fee. For
this reason, we believe that students should pay a small
amount of money to support a variety of groups, even
though students may not be directly benefited by them.
