# Alcohol: 'Still The Cheapest Buzz In Town'
## Drinking Spills Over From Frats To Faculty Club 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
"I've got the same drinking pattern as 30 of the other
guys in the house. We drink about four nights a week. It's
an escape from the dismal reality of a bad sex life here,"
John (not his real name) says.
John is not the only student who drinks regularly. The
reasons may differ with the individual, but the fact remains
that a phenomenal amount of alcohol is consumed by the
campus community.
John is on a California State Scholarship sleeping,
partying and "taking classes for the units," waiting to
graduate and "get out of here."His plans? "Nothing, maybe
law school in a couple of years . . .."
While he's waiting for graduation, he laments the lack of
"responsiveness" among women here, the source of his
misery and, consequently, his hea\y drinking.
"If I'm drinking at a mixed party and am trying to make
an impression on some girl, I don't drink as much as I
usually do," he says. "Most of the time though, I drink
with a group of guys and one or two girls, and it gets to be
a drag so I get drunk.
Gets Rowdy
"I get rowdy, violent and belligerent when I'm drunk."
John's drinking has earned him two drunk driving arrests;
numerous fights; stitches in his hand, the result of putting
his fist through a window; and, at the University's
insistence, a trip to a psychiatrist, which he agreed to "just
to pacify them | University officials]."
"Sometimes my violence bothers me, but I like what
drinking does for me . .. most of the time it's fun. Out of
four years I've only had about 10 bad experiences.
"I didn't drink much in high school. I started as a
freshman here. I lived in |Stern Hall's] Burbank, a

four-year dorm entrenched in the drinking tradition ... it
was a little frat. At first I didn't like the taste, no one does,
but the eifects were worth suffering for.
Same Pattern
"I've kept the same pattern, drinking heavily on
weekends, for three years. This year I've added Wednesday
nights — we go to a local bar."
John says he didn't consider himself an alcoholic or fear
becoming one, emphasizing that he could stop at any time.
"Last summer I only drank once. It all depends on who I'm
with."
John's drinking pattern may be the rule rather than the
exception here. Alcohol is still the "cheapest buzz in
town," according to one local psychiatrist, and judging
from the statistics it seems that "the buzz" is a sensation
here.
Faculty Club Tops
At the head of the class is the Faculty Club, entertaining
celebrities and visiting groups to the tune of $500 a month.
Running a close second is the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
which buys from 40 to 50 kegs of beer and spends around
$800 on booze each quarter.
The list continues with the Zeta Psi fraternity (30 kegs
and from $1200 to $2000 for booze each quarter), the
Delta Upsilon fraterntiy (25 kegs and $1500 for booze this
year), Branner Hall ($ll9O this year), Twain House
($1200) and Crothers ($1200).
To what extent do these statistics represent a orinking
problem here?
According to Assoc. Dean of Students Larry Horton,
alcohol "is a staple part of the U.S. adult culture and
college is an extension of that culture .... Drinking cuts
across classes at Stanford and it is my impression that it's

been on the rise for the last three years.
"The Administration has been concerned for some time
because serious drug abuse can result in serious injuries —
alcohol is a dangerous drug."
Abuse Rising
Six local doctors and psychiatrists agreed with Horton
that alcohol abuse is rising. According to Dr. Harvey
Pirofsky of the Palo Alto Alcohol Treatment Center,
"probably 75 percent of Stanford students drink and from
nine to 11 percent of the student body are potential
alcoholics."
Pirofsky emphasized that any amount of alcohol has
degenerative effects on the nervous system, memory and
performance. "The hangover is the body's attempt to
restitute it's balance; it's a stress on your system," he says.
The effect of drinking on social relationships may be
harmful as well. Pirofsky believes that relationships
between young drinkers are "superficial and distorted. In
attempting to define and relate to the other person, the
drinker distorts his self-image and that of the other
person."
Don't Know Results
Psychiatry Prof. Rudolf Moos emphasizes that "from the
strict research point of view we do not know the long-term
results of weekend binge drinking. There is a difference in
the personality of the heavy drinker and the abstainer.
Heavy drinkers are not likely to be strongly religious, and
they tend to engage in more exciting activities like
speeding."
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Services Director
David Dorosin states that "out of 100 students drinking
over a period of 20 years, 90 percent would probably show
no discernible effects psychologically, socially or physically
but from five to 10 percent would probably show the

stigmata of alcoholism through the consumption of greater
quantities of alcohol."
Dorosin outlines four questions students ought to ask
themselves if they fear a tendency towards alcoholism:
"How am I using it? (compulsively?); Do I come from a
family having problems with alcohol abuse'? Is it becoming
too important to me? (do I look forward to it too much?);
and am I using it frequently?
Amazing Tolerance
Cowell Director James McClenahan comments that some
students have an amazing tolerance, "They can drink
one-half pint of whiskey and still function whereas most of
us would be on the floor. The weekend binge drinkers run
an immediate risk of accidents. [But] there is no
information that drinking every Friday night for four years
causes residual damage," he said.
McClenahan also says that "there is no doubt that some
begin or learn to be alcoholics in college. A few beers daily
after studying may be signs of a developing pattern."
The doctors concurred that patterns of weekend binge
drinking will not inevitably continue after college. The
situation changes and binge drinking often is no longer a
part of one's environment.
Despite the apparent mass indulgence here, a large
number of students are not a part of the drinking tradition.
Synergy resident Chuck Pike comments, "I am saddened
by social drinking here — cocktail hours not drunkeness. I
am disappointed to see .. . students [putting themselves in
a social set). I would assume that would come later and
preferably not at all. Students are putting themselves into
middle class America when they should be experimenting
and questioning as much as possible the values and social
setup, not imitating the world existing outside."

guys in the house. We drink about four nights a week. It's
an escape from the dismal reality of a bad sex life here,"

one-half pint of whiskey and still function whereas most of
us would be on the floor. The weekend binge drinkers run
an immediate risk of accidents. [But] there is no
information that drinking every Friday night for four years
causes residual damage," he said.
McClenahan also says that "there is no doubt that some
begin or learn to be alcoholics in college. A few beers daily
after studying may be signs of a developing pattern."
The doctors concurred that patterns of weekend binge
drinking will not inevitably continue after college. The
situation changes and binge drinking often is no longer a
part of one's environment.
Despite the apparent mass indulgence here, a large
number of students are not a part of the drinking tradition.
Synergy resident Chuck Pike comments, "I am saddened
by social drinking here — cocktail hours not drunkeness. I
am disappointed to see .. . students [putting themselves in
a social set). I would assume that would come later and
preferably not at all. Students are putting themselves into
middle class America when they should be experimenting
and questioning as much as possible the values and social
setup, not imitating the world existing outside."
"I've got the same drinking pattern as 30 of the other
guys in the house. We drink about four nights a week. It's
an escape from the dismal reality of a bad sex life here,"
John (not his real name) says.
John is not the only student who drinks regularly. The
reasons may differ with the individual, but the fact remains
that a phenomenal amount of alcohol is consumed by the
campus community.
John is on a California State Scholarship sleeping,
partying and "taking classes for the units," waiting to
graduate and "get out of here."His plans? "Nothing, maybe
law school in a couple of years . . .."
While he's waiting for graduation, he laments the lack of
"responsiveness" among women here, the source of his
misery and, consequently, his hea\y drinking.
"If I'm drinking at a mixed party and am trying to make
an impression on some girl, I don't drink as much as I
usually do," he says. "Most of the time though, I drink
with a group of guys and one or two girls, and it gets to be
a drag so I get drunk.
Gets Rowdy
"I get rowdy, violent and belligerent when I'm drunk."
John's drinking has earned him two drunk driving arrests;
numerous fights; stitches in his hand, the result of putting
his fist through a window; and, at the University's
insistence, a trip to a psychiatrist, which he agreed to "just
to pacify them | University officials]."
"Sometimes my violence bothers me, but I like what
drinking does for me . .. most of the time it's fun. Out of
four years I've only had about 10 bad experiences.
"I didn't drink much in high school. I started as a
freshman here. I lived in |Stern Hall's] Burbank, a

four-year dorm entrenched in the drinking tradition ... it
was a little frat. At first I didn't like the taste, no one does,
but the eifects were worth suffering for.
Same Pattern
"I've kept the same pattern, drinking heavily on
weekends, for three years. This year I've added Wednesday
nights — we go to a local bar."
John says he didn't consider himself an alcoholic or fear
becoming one, emphasizing that he could stop at any time.
"Last summer I only drank once. It all depends on who I'm
with."
John's drinking pattern may be the rule rather than the
exception here. Alcohol is still the "cheapest buzz in
town," according to one local psychiatrist, and judging
from the statistics it seems that "the buzz" is a sensation
here.
Faculty Club Tops
At the head of the class is the Faculty Club, entertaining
celebrities and visiting groups to the tune of $500 a month.
Running a close second is the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
which buys from 40 to 50 kegs of beer and spends around
$800 on booze each quarter.
The list continues with the Zeta Psi fraternity (30 kegs
and from $1200 to $2000 for booze each quarter), the
Delta Upsilon fraterntiy (25 kegs and $1500 for booze this
year), Branner Hall ($ll9O this year), Twain House
($1200) and Crothers ($1200).
To what extent do these statistics represent a orinking
problem here?
According to Assoc. Dean of Students Larry Horton,
alcohol "is a staple part of the U.S. adult culture and
college is an extension of that culture .... Drinking cuts
across classes at Stanford and it is my impression that it's

been on the rise for the last three years.
"The Administration has been concerned for some time
because serious drug abuse can result in serious injuries —
alcohol is a dangerous drug."
Abuse Rising
Six local doctors and psychiatrists agreed with Horton
that alcohol abuse is rising. According to Dr. Harvey
Pirofsky of the Palo Alto Alcohol Treatment Center,
"probably 75 percent of Stanford students drink and from
nine to 11 percent of the student body are potential
alcoholics."
Pirofsky emphasized that any amount of alcohol has
degenerative effects on the nervous system, memory and
performance. "The hangover is the body's attempt to
restitute it's balance; it's a stress on your system," he says.
The effect of drinking on social relationships may be
harmful as well. Pirofsky believes that relationships
between young drinkers are "superficial and distorted. In
attempting to define and relate to the other person, the
drinker distorts his self-image and that of the other
person."
Don't Know Results
Psychiatry Prof. Rudolf Moos emphasizes that "from the
strict research point of view we do not know the long-term
results of weekend binge drinking. There is a difference in
the personality of the heavy drinker and the abstainer.
Heavy drinkers are not likely to be strongly religious, and
they tend to engage in more exciting activities like
speeding."
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Services Director
David Dorosin states that "out of 100 students drinking
over a period of 20 years, 90 percent would probably show
no discernible effects psychologically, socially or physically
but from five to 10 percent would probably show the

stigmata of alcoholism through the consumption of greater
quantities of alcohol."
Dorosin outlines four questions students ought to ask
themselves if they fear a tendency towards alcoholism:
"How am I using it? (compulsively?); Do I come from a
family having problems with alcohol abuse'? Is it becoming
too important to me? (do I look forward to it too much?);
and am I using it frequently?

strict research point of view we do not know the long-term
results of weekend binge drinking. There is a difference in
the personality of the heavy drinker and the abstainer.
Heavy drinkers are not likely to be strongly religious, and
they tend to engage in more exciting activities like
speeding."
Cowell's Counseling and Psychological Services Director
David Dorosin states that "out of 100 students drinking
over a period of 20 years, 90 percent would probably show
no discernible effects psychologically, socially or physically
but from five to 10 percent would probably show the

stigmata of alcoholism through the consumption of greater
quantities of alcohol."
Dorosin outlines four questions students ought to ask
themselves if they fear a tendency towards alcoholism:
"How am I using it? (compulsively?); Do I come from a
family having problems with alcohol abuse'? Is it becoming
too important to me? (do I look forward to it too much?);
and am I using it frequently?
Amazing Tolerance
Cowell Director James McClenahan comments that some
students have an amazing tolerance, "They can drink
one-half pint of whiskey and still function whereas most of
us would be on the floor. The weekend binge drinkers run
an immediate risk of accidents. [But] there is no
information that drinking every Friday night for four years
causes residual damage," he said.
McClenahan also says that "there is no doubt that some
begin or learn to be alcoholics in college. A few beers daily
after studying may be signs of a developing pattern."
The doctors concurred that patterns of weekend binge
drinking will not inevitably continue after college. The
situation changes and binge drinking often is no longer a
part of one's environment.
Despite the apparent mass indulgence here, a large
number of students are not a part of the drinking tradition.
Synergy resident Chuck Pike comments, "I am saddened
by social drinking here — cocktail hours not drunkeness. I
am disappointed to see .. . students [putting themselves in
a social set). I would assume that would come later and
preferably not at all. Students are putting themselves into
middle class America when they should be experimenting
and questioning as much as possible the values and social
setup, not imitating the world existing outside."
"I've got the same drinking pattern as 30 of the other
guys in the house. We drink about four nights a week. It's
an escape from the dismal reality of a bad sex life here,"
John (not his real name) says.
John is not the only student who drinks regularly. The
reasons may differ with the individual, but the fact remains
that a phenomenal amount of alcohol is consumed by the
campus community.
John is on a California State Scholarship sleeping,
partying and "taking classes for the units," waiting to
graduate and "get out of here."His plans? "Nothing, maybe
law school in a couple of years . . .."
While he's waiting for graduation, he laments the lack of
"responsiveness" among women here, the source of his
misery and, consequently, his hea\y drinking.
"If I'm drinking at a mixed party and am trying to make
an impression on some girl, I don't drink as much as I
usually do," he says. "Most of the time though, I drink
with a group of guys and one or two girls, and it gets to be
a drag so I get drunk.
Gets Rowdy
"I get rowdy, violent and belligerent when I'm drunk."
John's drinking has earned him two drunk driving arrests;
numerous fights; stitches in his hand, the result of putting
his fist through a window; and, at the University's
insistence, a trip to a psychiatrist, which he agreed to "just
to pacify them | University officials]."
"Sometimes my violence bothers me, but I like what
drinking does for me . .. most of the time it's fun. Out of
four years I've only had about 10 bad experiences.
"I didn't drink much in high school. I started as a
freshman here. I lived in |Stern Hall's] Burbank, a

four-year dorm entrenched in the drinking tradition ... it
was a little frat. At first I didn't like the taste, no one does,
but the eifects were worth suffering for.
Same Pattern
"I've kept the same pattern, drinking heavily on
weekends, for three years. This year I've added Wednesday
nights — we go to a local bar."
John says he didn't consider himself an alcoholic or fear
becoming one, emphasizing that he could stop at any time.
"Last summer I only drank once. It all depends on who I'm
with."
John's drinking pattern may be the rule rather than the
exception here. Alcohol is still the "cheapest buzz in
town," according to one local psychiatrist, and judging
from the statistics it seems that "the buzz" is a sensation
here.
Faculty Club Tops
At the head of the class is the Faculty Club, entertaining
celebrities and visiting groups to the tune of $500 a month.
Running a close second is the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
which buys from 40 to 50 kegs of beer and spends around
$800 on booze each quarter.
The list continues with the Zeta Psi fraternity (30 kegs
and from $1200 to $2000 for booze each quarter), the
Delta Upsilon fraterntiy (25 kegs and $1500 for booze this
year), Branner Hall ($ll9O this year), Twain House
($1200) and Crothers ($1200).
To what extent do these statistics represent a orinking
problem here?
According to Assoc. Dean of Students Larry Horton,
alcohol "is a staple part of the U.S. adult culture and
college is an extension of that culture .... Drinking cuts
across classes at Stanford and it is my impression that it's

been on the rise for the last three years.
"The Administration has been concerned for some time
because serious drug abuse can result in serious injuries —
alcohol is a dangerous drug."
Abuse Rising
Six local doctors and psychiatrists agreed with Horton
that alcohol abuse is rising. According to Dr. Harvey
Pirofsky of the Palo Alto Alcohol Treatment Center,
"probably 75 percent of Stanford students drink and from
nine to 11 percent of the student body are potential
alcoholics."
Pirofsky emphasized that any amount of alcohol has
degenerative effects on the nervous system, memory and
performance. "The hangover is the body's attempt to
restitute it's balance; it's a stress on your system," he says.
The effect of drinking on social relationships may be
harmful as well. Pirofsky believes that relationships
between young drinkers are "superficial and distorted. In
attempting to define and relate to the other person, the
drinker distorts his self-image and that of the other
person."
