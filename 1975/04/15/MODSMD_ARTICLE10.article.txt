# Chess Shouldn't Be So Political
## 
### 
Bobby Fischer's decision to forfeit his
world championship title rather than defend
it against Soviet challenger Anatoly Karpov
does more than cast a pall over American
chess. It serves to highlight the increasing
politicization of chess all over the world.
People have speculated on Fischer's
motives in declining to accept match
conditions under which he would receive
$1.5 million simply for losing to Karpov.
Some have suggested that Fischer's fear of
losing (he has long been out of practice)
outweighs any thought of the material gain.
This has been the Soviet stand. Others have
insisted that he cares little for money, and is
genuinely concerned over the match
conditions. The United States Chess
Federation holds this view.
But to many a woman in the street,
Fischer's decision merely reinforces what she
has known all along: "Fischer is crazy."
All of these analyses undoubtedly have
some merit; but none of them goes far
enough. Everyone agrees that Fischer's
resignation will hurt — perhaps destroy — tlx 1
International Chess Federation (FIDE), the
official governing body of chess throughout
the world.
And this, some argue, could be precisely
what Fischer intends.
FIDE's Origin
FIDE originated in tne wake of World War
11, after the death of World Champion
Alexander Alekhine. In the century before
the organization's advent, the World
Championship had been the exclusive
property of the titieholder — he played
matches whenever he wanted, withwhom

ever he wanted and under whatever
conditions he wanted.
But FIDE changed that. The group
organized a regular cycle, under which a new
match for the World Championship would be
held every three years.
The system worked fine for over a decade.
Then Bobby came along. Fischer qualified
for this Candidates tournament when only 14
— a unique achievement for one so young.
His first time through, he finished fifth

among eight contestants. The second time, in
1962, he entered with higher hopes — and
finished fourth. After that tournament,
Bobby made his famous charge, "The
Russians have fixed world chess."
Some of Fischer's complaints have been
petty — but there is no question that FIDE
has increasingly adopted policies and taken
stands which seem contradictory to its
motto, gens una sumus.
For example, the Federation recently
voted to expel both Rhodesia and South
Africa for "discrimination in chess." While
this may be in some sense commendable
(certainly I will lose no sleep over it), it
caused an immediate rift in the organization,
with many member nations contending that

FIDE should remain nonpolitical.
A more problematic example occurred at
the most recent chess Olympiad.
One nation refused to play against
another, in a protest of the latter's policies.
FIDE regulations clearly dictated that the
first team should forfeit the match. But
FIDE found another solution.
Used Ratings
There is a system for ranking chessplayers
— players gain or lose points according to
victories, draws and losses against players of
various strengths. Accompanying this system
is an elaborate formula for predicting chances
of success — for example, a player rated 100
points higher than another should defeat him
about 62.5 percent of the time.
FIDE ingeniously decided to use this
rating system to "predict" how one team
would have fared against the other — and
scored the match accordingly! The obvious
flaw is that all teams could refuse to play,
and simply finish in order of rating. More to
the point, the Soviet team, always the highest
rated, could decline to meet any opponents
at all (each time citing political reasons), and
win every match!
FIDE simply does not belong in politics —
and vice versa. But it may not matter
anymore — FIDE's internal politics have
finally led it to the point which the World
Boxing Association reached during all those
years when it tried to pawn off second class
champions, when everyone knew who the
real one was.
