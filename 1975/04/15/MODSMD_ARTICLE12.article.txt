# Ironies In Irish Case
## Robert McAfee Brown 
### 
Ironies in the Jerry Irish case
continue to multiply.
First, during the time that the
final decision was being made that
Irish did not deserve tenure at
Stanford, the Admissions
Committee sent letters to
prospective freshmen urging them
to come to the campus and sit in
on a few classes. Among the
classes proposed as an illustration
of the high quality of Stanford
teaching was Irish's course on
Christian Ethics.
What should the 125 enrolled
students in Christian Ethics tell
their high school counterparts?
"Appreciate this class today,
because you will never have
another chance to sit under Irish.
The University does not consider
hirrf worthy of future
employment?"
If I were among -the
prospective students, I think I
would leave the classroom feeling,
"If that is the kind of professor
Stanford doesn't want, I'll go
somewhere else."
Speaker For Seniors
The second irony is that on the
very day that Irish learned that
the University did not consider his
professorial capacities good

enough to warrant tenure, he also
got a letter from the president of
the senior class informing him
that he was one of three
professors who had meant most to
graduating seniors during their
four Stanford years, and inviting
him to speak to them during
commencement weekend.
The third irony is that on the
day that Irish's severance was
announced in the Daily, a photo
caption pictured him as having
struck a "pot o' gold," this
presumable referring to his
appointment to Wichita State
University.
While the Daily's overall
coverage of the Irish case has been
admirable, this caption is an
exception, for it implies that we
can all heave a sigh of relief; Irish
may have gotten bad treatmen;
from Stanford, but Wichita has
taken us off the hook and he's not
going to starve after all. I hope we
don't escape that easily.
First, I hope that students will
ask for a more significant voice in
determining who are the
important faculty to keep here for
the long haul.
Second, I hope that when there
is a significant difference on the

worth of a given candidate for
tenure between the estimate of a
department, and the estimate of
the Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee,
more use can be made of third
party estimates, etc. Finally, I
hope that when an appeal is
launched by an individual denied
tenure, grievance procedures can
be established that guarantee a
significant input by more than
those who made the initial
decision.
University Harmed, Too
I must conclude on a personal
note. It is no secret that the
possibility of Irish not getting
tenure has pained me for a long
time. Now that the decision is
definitive I must record that the
pain is deep. I feel it not only for
Irish, but for the University as
well.
I have believed deeply in both
Stanford and in Irish. But with his
departure, something of
incalculable importance for this
University's future disappears
from our midst. For me it means
that a dream about Stanford has
died.
