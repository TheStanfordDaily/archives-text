Jong Misunderstood
Editor:
George Dobbins, the male
reporter covering the poetry and
prose reading by Erica Jong(Daily,
April 11), missed a strong point in
Jong's work. Citing "Here Comes"
as uncomplimentary to men is
ignoring the disapproval expressed
towards women for relating to
men in such a negative way.
Viewing a man as either a robot or
a prick filled with money is
destructive to both men and
women, in terms of real meaning
in human relationships.
The paranoia of Dobbins
should not cloud his reaction to
the important message of Jong:
that relating and loving people
goes beyond labels and
stereotypes, and hopefully
transcends fear and alienation.
Dobbins should look instead to
the affirmative joy of Jong's
"Cornucopia," which speaks
positively of the abundance of
love to share between men and
women, when both persons are
liberated human beings.

Humility Needed
Editor:
In a letter to the editor ("An
Ominous Pattern") that appeared
in the San Francisco Chronicle on,
appropriately enough, April
Fools'Day, Robert Cohn, Lee
Weinstein, Alphonse Juilland, and
Robert Horn of the Stanford
faculty attempted to disguise their
out-dated view of world order as a
paternal concern for the
"children."
They cite "an ominous
pattern" in American foreign
policy that begins with the failure
of Congress to produce half a
billion dollars to continue the
wars in Southeast Asia. "The
Communists," they say, "will
certainly not content themselves
with their victories on the
mainland of China."
I would like to know where
these gentlemen have been during
the noon hour over the last six
years. One thing that must be
clear to anyone that has been
within shouting distance of
Stanford is that we "children"
want anything but more fighting
in Southeast Asia, and in most
cases, we have been calling for an
end to the aggressive "Pax
America" that has terrorized half
the globe since World War 11.
