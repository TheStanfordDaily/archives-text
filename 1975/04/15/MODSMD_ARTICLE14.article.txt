# Why McDermott?

For too long, candidates for
ASSU Council of Presidents have
promised the moon, the stars and
control of the University. After
the election, students have gotten
little. This year things can be
different.
Each proposal in our platform
has been carefully researched.
This research has delineated what
we can reasonably accomplish
once in office. And we have set
forth in our booklet exactly how
we can accomplish our goals.
We had to pass over many very
appealing proposals (such as
placing a student on the Board of
Trustees), because neither we nor
any other COP slate could
realistically guarantee to
place them in office. We
have limited our platform to the
feasible—that which we can and
will accomplish in office. This
platform is a basis for immediate
action, but it does not limit us
from accomplishing more.
Both our proposal to establish
a student advisory panel on
tuition and our proposal to place
a student on the Trustees' Budget
Ad Hoc Committee are
implementable within a year. We
have already begun conferring
with administrators like Ray
Bacchetti, vice provost for budget
and planning, as well as with
individual trustees.
And we have the experience to
back up our proposals. Kevin
McDermott has served as
chairman of the ASSU Select
Committee on Tuition and as
student member of the Trustees'
Committee on Finance and
Development. Mark Simonian
worked with budget
administrators and understands
the complexities of the budget
from his year of reporting on
University finances for the Daily.
Commuter transit is another
prime area of student concern
that we have begun working on.
With the University forcing
students to live off campus and
simultaneously eliminating
parking from the campus core.

students are caught in the middle
of a transportation dilemma.
The University has a
responsibility to provide
additional modes of
transportation for students. We
have researched a commuter
transit line and we have already
taken a survey of a number of
off-campus students. We will use
those survey results to develop a
feasible means for students to get
to and from campus without
depending on cars.
Recently, and especially in the
past year, the ASSU has shown
signs of becoming a corporate
giant. And that giant has been
feeding itself on student dollars at
every opportunity: charging high
prices for Special Events concerts,
lecture notes, and other ASSU
services. It's time for the rip-off to
stop.
We will make all ASSU projects
break-even ventures. It can be
done; just look at the Sunday
Flicks.
Of course, we also realize the
necessity for sufficient ASSU
reserves. But estimates have
placed total reserves at over a
quarter of a million dollars —
enough for the ASSU to survive
two disastrous years.
The ASSU is now at a crucial
stage in its existence. We can't let
control of ASSU programs and
monies be further isolated from
the students. We must make the
ASSU responsive to student needs
and an effective representative of
student opinion in University
affairs.
We feel the ASSU needs a
realistic, rather than idealistic,
approach to solving numerous
student problems. Much thought
and effort has gone into our
proposals. But without student
support, without votes, those
proposals will fall flat.
(Kevin McDermott, Bonny
Hodden, Andrew Leuchter and
Mark Simonian are candidates for
ASSU Council of Residents.)
