## Food Day Fast To Help The Hungry 
### CECILE HEROLD 
America's Gross National
Garbage count is some 360
million tons yearly. Each
American contributes about 135
bottles, 250 cans and 340
container caps to the heap.
These and other statistics on
the subject of U.S. trash are
reported in the book, Garbage:
The History and Future of
Garbage in America, by Katie
Kelly.
Startling facts on American
consumerism combined with
awareness that hundreds of
millions of people face starvation
each day has led to the creation of
a new observance, Food Day,
which will take place Thursday,
April 17.
Food Day is a project of the
Center for Science in the Public
Interest, an organization started in
1971 by three scientists who
formerly worked with Ralph
Nader. It investigates, publicizes
and seeks to solve various
consumer and environmental
problems.
Helping The Hungry
Tomorrow evening, close to
1500 Stanford students, or about
50 percent of those students with
University meal plans, will turn in
their meal cards in preparation for
a fasting observance of Food Day.
As a result of their abstinence,
nearly $2500 in rebate money will
be accumulated and sent to the
Church World Organization,
an international
charitable group providing means
for the hungry to eventually
provide for themselves.
The activities for Food Day
will include a noon rally, a 4 p.m.
address given by Frances Moore
Lappe, author of Diet for a Small
Planet, a faster's dinner hour
program in Bishop Auditorium,
and an evening panel discussion
on the world food problem.
Food Habits
A Food Day Fair will take
place the entire afternoon in
White Plaza. "Twenty-five to 30
booths will be set up relating food
to health, consumerism, and
religion," organizer Rob Quick
said.

"They will provide practical
information from how to give aid
to food charities to ways to begin
to change your life and food
habits."
The campus fast itself was not
advocated by the National
Coordinating Committee, Quick
said. "This observance is
particular to the Stanford campus,
although Duke University is
sponsoring something similar."
Since participating in a
national day of fasting prompted
last November by an international
food agency, Ox fam-America,
Duke students have continued

their activities by holding
one-meal-a-week fasts and holding
food-related seminars.
No Carrot Juice
Quick noted that individual
houses and fraternities could
decide how they wished to
observe Food Day and which food
organization they would support.
"Kappa Sig is laying out one sum
of money to contribute to
charities and anyone who can't or
doesn't want to fast will receive a
rebate from the house.
"The Dekes are giving up
dinner. Columbae House residents
will be fasting all day, but are still

investigating which fund to
support," he said.
He also gave some advice to
Food Day fasters, noting that,
"the worst time will probably be
around noon. Once you get over
that, hunger gradually disappears,
until you might not even feel like
eating."
Since Food Day emphasis is on
non-consumerism, Quick said the
afternoon fair in White Plaza will
feature "no carrot or orange juice
stands."
Dr. James McClenahan,
director of Cowell Health Center,
said the important thing about
fasting is to "keep hydrated.
Drink fluids like tea or broth and
there should be no problem with a
one-day fast."
Some events for observance of
the day elsewhere in the United
States include a hunger task force in
Milwaukee which will use Food
Day to begin a food stamp
outreach program. Also in that
city, a citizens' health committee
will attempt to pressure local
hospitals and nursing homes to
improve their food services by
planning more nutritious meals.
One food co-op in Hanover,
New Hampshire reported they
were asking area consumers to
elect food products to the Junk
Foods Hall of Fame. The
Pittsburgh Alliance for Consumer
Protection has encouraged local
school food service directors to
run contests for children to
compile a "healthy snack
cookbook."
On Friday, April 18, San Jose
City College and West Valley
College will hold a two-day urban
gardening symposium.
Quick said the hope of Food
Day is that it will stimulate a
national concern. "The model for
Food Day is Earth Day, which
began an entire environmental
movement," he said.
"Anyone could look dubiously
at a one-day activity to study the
world food problem. But people
will learn that the problem,
though massive, is not insoluble.
Food-Day's most promising value
lies in what it stirs beyond April
17."

last November by an international
food agency, Ox fam-America,
Duke students have continued

their activities by holding
one-meal-a-week fasts and holding
food-related seminars.
No Carrot Juice
Quick noted that individual
houses and fraternities could
decide how they wished to
observe Food Day and which food
organization they would support.
"Kappa Sig is laying out one sum
of money to contribute to
charities and anyone who can't or
doesn't want to fast will receive a
rebate from the house.
"The Dekes are giving up
dinner. Columbae House residents
will be fasting all day, but are still

investigating which fund to
support," he said.
He also gave some advice to
Food Day fasters, noting that,
"the worst time will probably be
around noon. Once you get over
that, hunger gradually disappears,
until you might not even feel like
eating."
Since Food Day emphasis is on
non-consumerism, Quick said the
afternoon fair in White Plaza will
feature "no carrot or orange juice
stands."
Dr. James McClenahan,
director of Cowell Health Center,
said the important thing about
fasting is to "keep hydrated.
Drink fluids like tea or broth and
there should be no problem with a
one-day fast."
Some events for observance of
the day elsewhere in the United
States include a hunger task force in
Milwaukee which will use Food
Day to begin a food stamp
outreach program. Also in that
city, a citizens' health committee
will attempt to pressure local
hospitals and nursing homes to
improve their food services by
planning more nutritious meals.
One food co-op in Hanover,
New Hampshire reported they
were asking area consumers to
elect food products to the Junk
Foods Hall of Fame. The
Pittsburgh Alliance for Consumer
Protection has encouraged local
school food service directors to
run contests for children to
compile a "healthy snack
cookbook."
On Friday, April 18, San Jose
City College and West Valley
College will hold a two-day urban
gardening symposium.
Quick said the hope of Food
Day is that it will stimulate a
national concern. "The model for
Food Day is Earth Day, which
began an entire environmental
movement," he said.
"Anyone could look dubiously
at a one-day activity to study the
world food problem. But people
will learn that the problem,
though massive, is not insoluble.
Food-Day's most promising value
lies in what it stirs beyond April
17."

FOOD FUN — On Thursday the Wilbur Food Service probably won't
have so many trays to take care of. Much of the campus will be
observing Food Day by skipping meals.
America's Gross National
Garbage count is some 360
million tons yearly. Each
American contributes about 135
bottles, 250 cans and 340
container caps to the heap.
These and other statistics on
the subject of U.S. trash are
reported in the book, Garbage:
The History and Future of
Garbage in America, by Katie
Kelly.
Startling facts on American
consumerism combined with
awareness that hundreds of
millions of people face starvation
each day has led to the creation of
a new observance, Food Day,
which will take place Thursday,
April 17.
Food Day is a project of the
Center for Science in the Public
Interest, an organization started in
1971 by three scientists who
formerly worked with Ralph
Nader. It investigates, publicizes
and seeks to solve various
consumer and environmental
problems.
Helping The Hungry
Tomorrow evening, close to
1500 Stanford students, or about
50 percent of those students with
University meal plans, will turn in
their meal cards in preparation for
a fasting observance of Food Day.
As a result of their abstinence,
nearly $2500 in rebate money will
be accumulated and sent to the
Church World Organization,
an international
charitable group providing means
for the hungry to eventually
provide for themselves.
The activities for Food Day
will include a noon rally, a 4 p.m.
address given by Frances Moore
Lappe, author of Diet for a Small
Planet, a faster's dinner hour
program in Bishop Auditorium,
and an evening panel discussion
on the world food problem.
Food Habits
A Food Day Fair will take
place the entire afternoon in
White Plaza. "Twenty-five to 30
booths will be set up relating food
to health, consumerism, and
religion," organizer Rob Quick
said.

"They will provide practical
information from how to give aid
to food charities to ways to begin
to change your life and food
habits."
The campus fast itself was not
advocated by the National
Coordinating Committee, Quick
said. "This observance is
particular to the Stanford campus,
although Duke University is
sponsoring something similar."

at a one-day activity to study the
world food problem. But people
will learn that the problem,
though massive, is not insoluble.
Food-Day's most promising value
lies in what it stirs beyond April
17."

FOOD FUN — On Thursday the Wilbur Food Service probably won't
have so many trays to take care of. Much of the campus will be
observing Food Day by skipping meals.
America's Gross National
Garbage count is some 360
million tons yearly. Each
American contributes about 135
bottles, 250 cans and 340
container caps to the heap.
These and other statistics on
the subject of U.S. trash are
reported in the book, Garbage:
The History and Future of
Garbage in America, by Katie
Kelly.
Startling facts on American
consumerism combined with
awareness that hundreds of
millions of people face starvation
each day has led to the creation of
a new observance, Food Day,
which will take place Thursday,
April 17.
Food Day is a project of the
Center for Science in the Public
Interest, an organization started in
1971 by three scientists who
formerly worked with Ralph
Nader. It investigates, publicizes
and seeks to solve various
consumer and environmental
problems.
Helping The Hungry
Tomorrow evening, close to
1500 Stanford students, or about
50 percent of those students with
University meal plans, will turn in
their meal cards in preparation for
a fasting observance of Food Day.
As a result of their abstinence,
nearly $2500 in rebate money will
be accumulated and sent to the
Church World Organization,
an international
charitable group providing means
for the hungry to eventually
provide for themselves.
The activities for Food Day
will include a noon rally, a 4 p.m.
address given by Frances Moore
Lappe, author of Diet for a Small
Planet, a faster's dinner hour
program in Bishop Auditorium,
and an evening panel discussion
on the world food problem.
Food Habits
A Food Day Fair will take
place the entire afternoon in
White Plaza. "Twenty-five to 30
booths will be set up relating food
to health, consumerism, and
religion," organizer Rob Quick
said.

"They will provide practical
information from how to give aid
to food charities to ways to begin
to change your life and food
habits."
The campus fast itself was not
advocated by the National
Coordinating Committee, Quick
said. "This observance is
particular to the Stanford campus,
although Duke University is
sponsoring something similar."
Since participating in a
national day of fasting prompted
last November by an international
food agency, Ox fam-America,
Duke students have continued

their activities by holding
one-meal-a-week fasts and holding
food-related seminars.
No Carrot Juice
Quick noted that individual
houses and fraternities could
decide how they wished to
observe Food Day and which food
organization they would support.
"Kappa Sig is laying out one sum
of money to contribute to
charities and anyone who can't or
doesn't want to fast will receive a
rebate from the house.
"The Dekes are giving up
dinner. Columbae House residents
will be fasting all day, but are still

investigating which fund to
support," he said.
He also gave some advice to
Food Day fasters, noting that,
"the worst time will probably be
around noon. Once you get over
that, hunger gradually disappears,
until you might not even feel like
eating."
Since Food Day emphasis is on
non-consumerism, Quick said the
afternoon fair in White Plaza will
feature "no carrot or orange juice
stands."
Dr. James McClenahan,
director of Cowell Health Center,
said the important thing about
fasting is to "keep hydrated.
Drink fluids like tea or broth and
there should be no problem with a
one-day fast."
Some events for observance of
the day elsewhere in the United
States include a hunger task force in
Milwaukee which will use Food
Day to begin a food stamp
outreach program. Also in that
city, a citizens' health committee
will attempt to pressure local
hospitals and nursing homes to
improve their food services by
planning more nutritious meals.
One food co-op in Hanover,
New Hampshire reported they
were asking area consumers to
elect food products to the Junk
Foods Hall of Fame. The
Pittsburgh Alliance for Consumer
Protection has encouraged local
school food service directors to
run contests for children to
compile a "healthy snack
cookbook."
On Friday, April 18, San Jose
City College and West Valley
College will hold a two-day urban
gardening symposium.
Quick said the hope of Food
Day is that it will stimulate a
national concern. "The model for
Food Day is Earth Day, which
began an entire environmental
movement," he said.
"Anyone could look dubiously
at a one-day activity to study the
world food problem. But people
will learn that the problem,
though massive, is not insoluble.
Food-Day's most promising value
lies in what it stirs beyond April
17."
