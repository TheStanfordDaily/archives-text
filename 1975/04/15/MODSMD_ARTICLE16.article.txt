Is it true that there is a city at the
bottom of Searsville Lake? How
big was this "Searsville"and what
is its history?— W M.E.
The story of little Searsville,
which disappeared in 1891, is
touching, and certainly obscure.
In all the records of the California
Historical Society there is only
one brief mention of the town.
The following information is from
material in the Stanford archives
—a 1954 column in the Chron
and a short article in the journal
of the San Mateo County
Historical Association, written in
1946.
The land that is now Searsville
Lake was part of the Coppinger
grant. It was originally sold to
Colonel Jack Hays, the first
sheriff of San Francisco County,
from whom John Sears purchased
it in 1854. Sears and a small band
of lumbermen founded the town
and established a thriving lumber
industry to serve the surrounding
gold rush towns.
Sears constructed his first
buildings around what is now the
intersection of Sand Hillßoadand
Portola Road where there was
already a hotel for lumbermen.
The hotel, according to the
Chronicle, was operated by
August Eikerencotter who built it
after the birth of his daughter
Mrs. Klumpp. Sears built his home
inside what is now the entrance to
the Searsville Lake park and the
town grew around it. He also built
another hotel which eventually
btirned down.
It is hard to construct a mental
picture of what the town actually
looked like. The two oak trees
now at the entrance to the park
were the center of the village
square, and the long row of
eucalyptus trees which borders
the road leading to the lake was
the main street of the town.
Besides the prominent
Eikerencotters, the inhabitants
included a blacksmith named
William Lloyd and two village
storekeepers — William and Lem
Page.
The town remained nameless
for several years, when a reporter
from the Alta California passed

through it on a tour of lumber
camps. He felt that John Scars
was the founding spirit of the
little town, and gave it its name.
Sears, unimpressed by the honor,
moved away in a few years and
later founded and named La
Honda.
Many towns died when the
lumber industry folded but
Searsville was not among them.
Farmers followed the lumbermen
and some wealthy men established
country homes in the town
Searsville grew into a
"prosperous" village with streets
named First, Second, and Third
and crosswise A, B, and C. A
school, whose principal was John
Hall, was founded.
Searsville's murderer was the
Spring Valley Water Company,
which bought up all the land
around Searsville in 1887. The
company wanted to build a dam
at Searsville and run a pipeline
down to form the southernmost
lake in the Spring Valley. It began
construction immediately and, by
October, 1891, was just about
finished.
A reporter wrote the following
account of the last days of
Searsville, as the town was being
torn down in preparation for the
dam's opening:
Three or four old-timers
gathered near the hotel and
mournfully gazed on the work of
demolition, and as each familiar
landmark gradually faded away
they became reminiscent, and the
yarns they told of the life and
bustle of that lively little burg of
years ago would fill a big book —
how the mill-boys used to come
into town and spend Sunday
afternoons at horse-racing,
fighting, and other amusements;
of the farmers' games of poker
and the high stakes that were
wagered on the races. There was
more life in Searsville than there

now is in all of the county. That
was when the old men were boys;
uhen dollars were as plentiful as
dimes are today and everyone had
more than he knew what to do
with.
Some of the town's residents
lefused to believe that the end
had come. One reporter told of
seeing a small house being dragged
by horses on a sled up a
eucalyptus-lined drive as water
covered the road behind it.
The idea of joining Searsville
Lake to the Spring Valley Lakes
was changed and finally
abandoned when Leland Stanford
founded the University and
bought the property as a
recreation area for students. But
the town was gone forever.
And that is the history of
Searsville. Unfortunately, we
could find no population statistics
for the town, although it was
called a "little" village. And no
one seems to know whether any
buildings were actually covered
over by the water and might still
be there. In fact, most of the
employees at the Searsville Lake
park don't even know the story of
the obscure little town. In the
words of blacksmith William
Lloyd, "Vale, Searsville! It is gone
with all its pleasant memories and
associations, living only in
memory."

Where in the Bay Area (preferably
on the Peninsula) can I get a color
photograph put on a t-shirt?
—J.E.H.
Apparently the only place in
the entire Bay Area is a shop
called The Color Machine at 70
Broadway in San Francisco. The
shirt will cost you $10.60,
including tax, and will be finished
in from a couple of hours to two
days. The store isn't listed in the
phone book; its number is
788-7774.
