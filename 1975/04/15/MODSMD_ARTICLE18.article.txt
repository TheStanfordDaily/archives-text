# Law Prof Examines Profession's Roles
## 
### RON ELVING 
Simon H. Rifkind, Phleger
Professor of Law, told a
Thursday night Annenberg
Auditorium audience that
attorneys must serve their clients,
profession and community in
roles ranging from that of "legal
inventor" to "legal midwife."
Addressing a crowd of more
than 150, the Russian-born
Rifkind said these varied roles
must function in the context of
the Anglo-American adversarial
system of justice, a system he
characterized as "a fire of
antagonism in which a finer truth
is smelted."
Within the "environment" of
this system, Rifkind said the task
of the attorney is "to obtain the
best available | solution | for his
client within the law and by
means compatible with the canons
of professional ethics."
Calling those forms of legal
endeavor not specifically covered
by the professional code the "soft
underbelly of the legal
profession," Rifkind argued that
attorneys are "no more
unprincipled than practitioners of
other professions."
Though he admitted the
adversarial system suffers from
"flaws of logic," the 74-year-old
former federal judge maintained
that the origin and test of the
system lie in experience rather
than in logical theory.
"Experience has shown us," he
said, "that the adversarial system
is good for liberty, good for
peaceful progress, and good
enough to have won and kept the
support of the people."
Turning to the system's
shortcomings, Rifkind paid special
attention to the oft-repeated
question: "How could you have
defended so-and-so?" Rifkind has
recently gained a modicum of

notoriety for representing former
Vice President Spiro Agnew.
"As you know, there are
fashions attached to
'untouchability' " Rifkind said.
"One season the untouchable is a
black share-cropper in Mississippi,
the next it may be a large
corporation in Detroit," he added.
In considering whether or not
to defend one kind of
"untouchable" or another,
Rifkind contended, an attorney
must bear in mind his
"responsibility to make the
adversary system work." Without
this duty, Rifkind suggested
attorneys might "defend only
those whom they loved."
Rifkind also discussed the
trend toward "cause-oriented as
opposed to client-oriented"
representation. He saw in this the
probability of lawyers themselves
deciding what constituted the
"public interest."
Describing the extremes of this
practice as "unctious," Rifkind
pointed out that "no Sinaic light
illuminates the public interest."
Rifkind noted that trials often
begin with a "litany" about the
ascertainment of truth. "With
some trepidation," he said, "I
tender the suggestion that
ascertaining truth is not the target
of courtroom proceedings."
"Courtroom truth is a unique
species of the genus 'truth,' "
Rifkind stated. As an alternative
view, he offered "the solution of a
controversy through the
application of the rules" as the
real objective of litigation.
Rifkind, senior partner in
the New York firm of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and
former judge of the Southern New
York District Court, is on campus
for one semester teaching a law
school seminar on "The Anatomy
of a Civil Trial."
