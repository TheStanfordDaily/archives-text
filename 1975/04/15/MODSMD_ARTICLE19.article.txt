## Movies: Beware The Violent 'Four' 
### 
There is a travesty being
perpetrated on the movie-going
public called The Four
Musketeers , the long-awaited
sequel to 1974's acclaimed and
popular Three Musketeers. Made
simultaneously, they've been
released as two two-hour movies
rather than one long one.
This is a brilliant idea in
theory, because if the first one is a
success, there is an instant
audience for the second (the
pitfall lies in making the first one
a success). Essentially, this is the
same movie as the first, and it's
almost as if you're returning from
an extended intermission.
There are the same familiar
actors as familiar characters,
which always increases one's
enjoyment of a movie. But I don't
understand how results of the two
films can be so different.
For those of you who just
walked in to the plot, Cardinal
Richelieu (Charlton Heston, in
another of his seemingly endless
disaster movies), thirsting for
power, conspires with the King of
France (Jean-Pierre Cassel) to
discredit the Queen (Geraldine

Chaplin), who is in love with Lord
Buckingham (Simon Ward), but
who also is ever faithfully guarded
from scandal by her musketeers
(Oliver Reed, Frank K'nlay, and
Richard Chamberlain).
These were, 1 suppose, a
combination of the Secret Service
and the White House Plumbers.
Richelieu sends evil Christopher
Lee and even more evil Faye
Dunaway to do away with the
Musketeers, and with Constance
(Raquel Welch) being kidnapped
and some religious war thrown in
for good measure (French history
was never my specialty), you
have the strand the Musketeers'

antics are hung on.
The Four Musketeers has
drawbacks galore, some of which
plagued the first movie as well,
but less noticeably. If you are
unsure of the historical aspect of
the times director Richard Lester
is recreating, expect to be
confused beyond hope. If you're
lucky, you may have a vague idea
of what's happening.
But the worst thing of all by
far — it would have been
justification for not releasing the
second half at all — is that it isn't
funny.
Admittedly, The Four has its
slapstick scenes, puns and sight
gags as the first one did, but in a
movie advertised as a comedy,
there is no excuse for the violent
beheadings, knifings, burnings,
murders and strangulations that
occur here.
The violence has the effect of a
nauseating mixture of The Three
(except that the swordfights are
bloodier here), Earthquake, with
concrete walls collapsing, and The
Towering Inferno, with burning
buildings and bodies. It is a brutal
shock to realize the direction in

which the movie goes.
Vie Four ceases to be humorous and
becomes a hard movie to watch
without squirming, for it is not
what you would expect with The
Three Musketeers in mind.
This is a disturbing jumble that
gets uglier and uglier with each
passing murder. All in all, it is a
very dissatisfying experience. If
this is a comedy, I'm Morris The
Cat.

Perennially the worst special of
the television season, this year's
Academy Awards ceremony
showed scant signs of
improvement. There was a general

lackluster feeling generated by
those participating, and the
ceremony plodded rather than
pranced.
However, this is a direct
improvement on previous years
when the show was just plain
boring. The film clips of previous
ceremonies — "Oscar's home
movies" — were almost as exciting
as this show, which doesn't say
much for it. They were interesting
up to a point, but their abundance
diminished their value and they
almost became a crutch for the
show to lean upon.
One of the improvements
though was the combination of
the nominated songs into a
medley, a stroke of genius.
Nothing has stopped other shows
dead in their tracks more than the
lousy renditions of the lousy
songs.
But the show returned to
tradition with the initial set of
gigantic Oscar statues and a
monstrous head of Oscar,
unbelievably tasteless and gaudy,
reminiscent of the commandment,
"Thoushalt not make unto thyself
graven image."
Everyone was expecting Ingrid
Bergman to cart off her third
Oscar for her cameo role in
Murder On The Orient Express,
for sentimental reasons.
Sentimentality had failed for
Astaire, but it didn't for Bergman,
for reasons beyond my
understanding. Her part was small
and dull. On the other hand,
Lauren Bacall's appearance in the
same movie was longer and better.
And if you're going to get
sentimental, Bacall has never
been nominated, while
Bergman has been nominated six
times.
The nominees for best actress
had been easy to choose — there
were really only five good
performances during the year. It's
safe to say that had Liv Ullman
and Scenes From A Marriage been
eligible, Diahann Carroll wouldn't
have been nominated for
Claudine, but we don't discuss
embarassing things like that.
Ellen Burstyn, twice before a
nominee (The Last Picture Show,
The Exorcist), admitted her
childhood ambition to win the
Oscar. Around 1971, she believed
herself more mature — it didn't
matter. But she confessed to Los
Angeles movie critic David
Sheehan, "Now I want an
Oscar!"
And she's delivered no
performance more deserving of it
than "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore. Valerie Perrine (rhymes
with McQueen) admittedly gave a
whopping portrayal of Honey
Bruce in Lenny, Gena Rowlands'
Mabel Longhetti in A Woman
Under The Influence was a
masterpiece, and Faye Dunaway's
performance in Chinatown was
thought to be one of the favorites,
but, because of the
unpredictability of the evening
and Burstyn's fame in a
group mostly made up of
newcomers, she was a likely
choice.
Ironically, her last role before

Alice was Harry Coombs'
daughter in Harry and Ton to. Her
father was played by Art Carney,
whose name brought gasps when
Glenda Jackson announced it as
winner. Unlike the best actress
competition, there wen 1 many
actors who deserved to be
nominated, Gene Hackman,
Richard Drey fuss, and James
Caan, to name a few. Instead, we
had Albert Finney unexplainably
for Murder On The Orient Express
(his second nomination, the first
coming 12 years ago for Tom
Jones), his Hercule Poirot the long
shot. I found the interpretation
unintelligible and unemotfonal.
Dustin Hoffman, following in
George C. Scott's footsteps,
proclaimed similar anti-Academy
feelings, but said of the award,
"You can't not accept it — they
give it to you," adding that his
producer would accept for him
should he win. Hoffman's Lenny
Bruce was a tour de force, and
had Carney not won, I would have
been equally pleased to see
Hoffman win, especially after his
losses for The Graduate and
Midnight Cowboy.
The year's two big movies,
Chinatown and The Godfather
Part II each garnered 11
nominations. Chinatown was
predicted to be the big winner,
mostly because of its quality and
the original Godfather's win in
1973. The sole exception in a
Chinatown sweep was Francis
Ford Coppola's winning the Best
Director award, having lost for the
original to Bob Fosse for Cabaret
(Fosse was also a nominee, for
Lenny), leaving Roman Polanski
out in the cold (which was fine
with me, because I considered the
second Godfather a picture highly
superior to its father and
Chinatown to be a depressing,
overlong exercise in boredom).
This supposed sweep netted
Chinatown a lone Oscar for
Robert Towne's screenplay. The
sequel, an epilogue and prologue
to the first, swept through with
twice the power and netted six
deserved awards, three of them
for' Coppola (screenwriting,
directing, and producing), who

had been nominated for five
separate awards for the evening.
His Conversation was nominated
for the top award, too; one
reviewer, in panning Part 11, said
he could tolerate garbage like it as
long as it permitted Coppola to
film movies like The
Conversation. On the whole, the
picture category had a glittering
array — Lenny, The Towering
Inferno, The Conversation, The
Godfather Part 11, and Chinatown
were all high on quality and
content. They were heavier and
more engrossing this year, whereas
last year mostly light, fluffy films
were nominated — The Sting, A
Touch of Class, American Graffiti
— and none of those carried the
power of this year's batch. It was
pointed out that all the
nominated movies dealt with
some form of corruption in
society, which means perhaps we
are recognizing our faults and
getting them into the open where
they can be dealt with. Things are
looking up.

there is no excuse for the violent
beheadings, knifings, burnings,
murders and strangulations that
occur here.
The violence has the effect of a
nauseating mixture of The Three
(except that the swordfights are
bloodier here), Earthquake, with
concrete walls collapsing, and The
Towering Inferno, with burning
buildings and bodies. It is a brutal
shock to realize the direction in

which the movie goes.
Vie Four ceases to be humorous and
becomes a hard movie to watch
without squirming, for it is not
what you would expect with The
Three Musketeers in mind.
This is a disturbing jumble that
gets uglier and uglier with each
passing murder. All in all, it is a
very dissatisfying experience. If
this is a comedy, I'm Morris The
Cat.

Perennially the worst special of
the television season, this year's
Academy Awards ceremony
showed scant signs of
improvement. There was a general

lackluster feeling generated by
those participating, and the
ceremony plodded rather than
pranced.
However, this is a direct
improvement on previous years
when the show was just plain
boring. The film clips of previous
ceremonies — "Oscar's home
movies" — were almost as exciting
as this show, which doesn't say
much for it. They were interesting
up to a point, but their abundance
diminished their value and they
almost became a crutch for the
show to lean upon.
One of the improvements
though was the combination of
the nominated songs into a
medley, a stroke of genius.
Nothing has stopped other shows
dead in their tracks more than the
lousy renditions of the lousy
songs.
But the show returned to
tradition with the initial set of
gigantic Oscar statues and a
monstrous head of Oscar,
unbelievably tasteless and gaudy,
reminiscent of the commandment,
"Thoushalt not make unto thyself
graven image."
Everyone was expecting Ingrid
Bergman to cart off her third
Oscar for her cameo role in
Murder On The Orient Express,
for sentimental reasons.
Sentimentality had failed for
Astaire, but it didn't for Bergman,
for reasons beyond my
understanding. Her part was small
and dull. On the other hand,
Lauren Bacall's appearance in the
same movie was longer and better.
And if you're going to get
sentimental, Bacall has never
been nominated, while
Bergman has been nominated six
times.
The nominees for best actress
had been easy to choose — there
were really only five good
performances during the year. It's
safe to say that had Liv Ullman
and Scenes From A Marriage been
eligible, Diahann Carroll wouldn't
have been nominated for
Claudine, but we don't discuss
embarassing things like that.
Ellen Burstyn, twice before a
nominee (The Last Picture Show,
The Exorcist), admitted her
childhood ambition to win the
Oscar. Around 1971, she believed
herself more mature — it didn't
matter. But she confessed to Los
Angeles movie critic David
Sheehan, "Now I want an
Oscar!"
And she's delivered no
performance more deserving of it
than "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore. Valerie Perrine (rhymes
with McQueen) admittedly gave a
whopping portrayal of Honey
Bruce in Lenny, Gena Rowlands'
Mabel Longhetti in A Woman
Under The Influence was a
masterpiece, and Faye Dunaway's
performance in Chinatown was
thought to be one of the favorites,
but, because of the
unpredictability of the evening
and Burstyn's fame in a
group mostly made up of
newcomers, she was a likely
choice.
Ironically, her last role before

Alice was Harry Coombs'
daughter in Harry and Ton to. Her
father was played by Art Carney,
whose name brought gasps when
Glenda Jackson announced it as
winner. Unlike the best actress
competition, there wen 1 many
actors who deserved to be
nominated, Gene Hackman,
Richard Drey fuss, and James
Caan, to name a few. Instead, we
had Albert Finney unexplainably
for Murder On The Orient Express
(his second nomination, the first
coming 12 years ago for Tom
Jones), his Hercule Poirot the long
shot. I found the interpretation
unintelligible and unemotfonal.
Dustin Hoffman, following in
George C. Scott's footsteps,
proclaimed similar anti-Academy
feelings, but said of the award,
"You can't not accept it — they
give it to you," adding that his
producer would accept for him
should he win. Hoffman's Lenny
Bruce was a tour de force, and
had Carney not won, I would have
been equally pleased to see
Hoffman win, especially after his
losses for The Graduate and
Midnight Cowboy.
The year's two big movies,
Chinatown and The Godfather
Part II each garnered 11
nominations. Chinatown was
predicted to be the big winner,
mostly because of its quality and
the original Godfather's win in
1973. The sole exception in a
Chinatown sweep was Francis
Ford Coppola's winning the Best
Director award, having lost for the
original to Bob Fosse for Cabaret
(Fosse was also a nominee, for
Lenny), leaving Roman Polanski
out in the cold (which was fine
with me, because I considered the
second Godfather a picture highly
superior to its father and
Chinatown to be a depressing,
overlong exercise in boredom).
This supposed sweep netted
Chinatown a lone Oscar for
Robert Towne's screenplay. The
sequel, an epilogue and prologue
to the first, swept through with
twice the power and netted six
deserved awards, three of them
for' Coppola (screenwriting,
directing, and producing), who

had been nominated for five
separate awards for the evening.
His Conversation was nominated
for the top award, too; one
reviewer, in panning Part 11, said
he could tolerate garbage like it as
long as it permitted Coppola to
film movies like The
Conversation. On the whole, the
picture category had a glittering
array — Lenny, The Towering
Inferno, The Conversation, The
Godfather Part 11, and Chinatown
were all high on quality and
content. They were heavier and
more engrossing this year, whereas
last year mostly light, fluffy films
were nominated — The Sting, A
Touch of Class, American Graffiti
— and none of those carried the
power of this year's batch. It was
pointed out that all the
nominated movies dealt with
some form of corruption in
society, which means perhaps we
are recognizing our faults and
getting them into the open where
they can be dealt with. Things are
looking up.

THE WIZARD OF HORN—Barry Tuckwell, dubbed the "wizard of the French horn," will perform a solo
recital in the Civic Center Veterans' Auditorium Saturday night. He will play works by Beethoven,
Schumann and Hindemith. For information call 921-0611.


MASTER OF THE ELEVENTH HOUSE-Larry Coryell, his Hagstrom
"Swede" guitar and his band, featuring drummer Alphonse Mouzon,
will perform twice for Bay Area fans this weekend. With Chick Corea,
theyll be in San Jose Friday and Berkeley Saturday nights.
There is a travesty being
perpetrated on the movie-going
public called The Four
Musketeers , the long-awaited
sequel to 1974's acclaimed and
popular Three Musketeers. Made
simultaneously, they've been
released as two two-hour movies
rather than one long one.
This is a brilliant idea in
theory, because if the first one is a
success, there is an instant
audience for the second (the
pitfall lies in making the first one
a success). Essentially, this is the
same movie as the first, and it's
almost as if you're returning from
an extended intermission.
There are the same familiar
actors as familiar characters,
which always increases one's
enjoyment of a movie. But I don't
understand how results of the two
films can be so different.
For those of you who just
walked in to the plot, Cardinal
Richelieu (Charlton Heston, in
another of his seemingly endless
disaster movies), thirsting for
power, conspires with the King of
France (Jean-Pierre Cassel) to
discredit the Queen (Geraldine

Chaplin), who is in love with Lord
Buckingham (Simon Ward), but
who also is ever faithfully guarded
from scandal by her musketeers
(Oliver Reed, Frank K'nlay, and
Richard Chamberlain).
These were, 1 suppose, a
combination of the Secret Service
and the White House Plumbers.
Richelieu sends evil Christopher
Lee and even more evil Faye
Dunaway to do away with the
Musketeers, and with Constance
(Raquel Welch) being kidnapped
and some religious war thrown in
for good measure (French history
was never my specialty), you
have the strand the Musketeers'

antics are hung on.
The Four Musketeers has
drawbacks galore, some of which
plagued the first movie as well,
but less noticeably. If you are
unsure of the historical aspect of
the times director Richard Lester
is recreating, expect to be
confused beyond hope. If you're
lucky, you may have a vague idea
of what's happening.
But the worst thing of all by
far — it would have been
justification for not releasing the
second half at all — is that it isn't
funny.
Admittedly, The Four has its
slapstick scenes, puns and sight
gags as the first one did, but in a
movie advertised as a comedy,
there is no excuse for the violent
beheadings, knifings, burnings,
murders and strangulations that
occur here.
The violence has the effect of a

And if you're going to get
sentimental, Bacall has never
been nominated, while
Bergman has been nominated six
times.
The nominees for best actress
had been easy to choose — there
were really only five good
performances during the year. It's
safe to say that had Liv Ullman
and Scenes From A Marriage been
eligible, Diahann Carroll wouldn't
have been nominated for
Claudine, but we don't discuss
embarassing things like that.
Ellen Burstyn, twice before a
nominee (The Last Picture Show,
The Exorcist), admitted her
childhood ambition to win the
Oscar. Around 1971, she believed
herself more mature — it didn't
matter. But she confessed to Los
Angeles movie critic David
Sheehan, "Now I want an
Oscar!"
And she's delivered no
performance more deserving of it
than "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore. Valerie Perrine (rhymes
with McQueen) admittedly gave a
whopping portrayal of Honey
Bruce in Lenny, Gena Rowlands'
Mabel Longhetti in A Woman
Under The Influence was a
masterpiece, and Faye Dunaway's
performance in Chinatown was
thought to be one of the favorites,
but, because of the
unpredictability of the evening
and Burstyn's fame in a
group mostly made up of
newcomers, she was a likely
choice.
Ironically, her last role before

Alice was Harry Coombs'
daughter in Harry and Ton to. Her
father was played by Art Carney,
whose name brought gasps when
Glenda Jackson announced it as
winner. Unlike the best actress
competition, there wen 1 many
actors who deserved to be
nominated, Gene Hackman,
Richard Drey fuss, and James
Caan, to name a few. Instead, we
had Albert Finney unexplainably
for Murder On The Orient Express
(his second nomination, the first
coming 12 years ago for Tom
Jones), his Hercule Poirot the long
shot. I found the interpretation
unintelligible and unemotfonal.
Dustin Hoffman, following in
George C. Scott's footsteps,
proclaimed similar anti-Academy
feelings, but said of the award,
"You can't not accept it — they
give it to you," adding that his
producer would accept for him
should he win. Hoffman's Lenny
Bruce was a tour de force, and
had Carney not won, I would have
been equally pleased to see
Hoffman win, especially after his
losses for The Graduate and
Midnight Cowboy.
The year's two big movies,
Chinatown and The Godfather
Part II each garnered 11
nominations. Chinatown was
predicted to be the big winner,
mostly because of its quality and
the original Godfather's win in
1973. The sole exception in a
Chinatown sweep was Francis
Ford Coppola's winning the Best
Director award, having lost for the
original to Bob Fosse for Cabaret
(Fosse was also a nominee, for
Lenny), leaving Roman Polanski
out in the cold (which was fine
with me, because I considered the
second Godfather a picture highly
superior to its father and
Chinatown to be a depressing,
overlong exercise in boredom).
This supposed sweep netted
Chinatown a lone Oscar for
Robert Towne's screenplay. The
sequel, an epilogue and prologue
to the first, swept through with
twice the power and netted six
deserved awards, three of them
for' Coppola (screenwriting,
directing, and producing), who

had been nominated for five
separate awards for the evening.
His Conversation was nominated
for the top award, too; one
reviewer, in panning Part 11, said
he could tolerate garbage like it as
long as it permitted Coppola to
film movies like The
Conversation. On the whole, the
picture category had a glittering
array — Lenny, The Towering
Inferno, The Conversation, The
Godfather Part 11, and Chinatown
were all high on quality and
content. They were heavier and
more engrossing this year, whereas
last year mostly light, fluffy films
were nominated — The Sting, A
Touch of Class, American Graffiti
— and none of those carried the
power of this year's batch. It was
pointed out that all the
nominated movies dealt with
some form of corruption in
society, which means perhaps we
are recognizing our faults and
getting them into the open where
they can be dealt with. Things are
looking up.

THE WIZARD OF HORN—Barry Tuckwell, dubbed the "wizard of the French horn," will perform a solo
recital in the Civic Center Veterans' Auditorium Saturday night. He will play works by Beethoven,
Schumann and Hindemith. For information call 921-0611.


MASTER OF THE ELEVENTH HOUSE-Larry Coryell, his Hagstrom
"Swede" guitar and his band, featuring drummer Alphonse Mouzon,
will perform twice for Bay Area fans this weekend. With Chick Corea,
theyll be in San Jose Friday and Berkeley Saturday nights.
There is a travesty being
perpetrated on the movie-going
public called The Four
Musketeers , the long-awaited
sequel to 1974's acclaimed and
popular Three Musketeers. Made
simultaneously, they've been
released as two two-hour movies
rather than one long one.
This is a brilliant idea in
theory, because if the first one is a
success, there is an instant
audience for the second (the
pitfall lies in making the first one
a success). Essentially, this is the
same movie as the first, and it's
almost as if you're returning from
an extended intermission.
There are the same familiar
actors as familiar characters,
which always increases one's
enjoyment of a movie. But I don't
understand how results of the two
films can be so different.
For those of you who just
walked in to the plot, Cardinal
Richelieu (Charlton Heston, in
another of his seemingly endless
disaster movies), thirsting for
power, conspires with the King of
France (Jean-Pierre Cassel) to
discredit the Queen (Geraldine

Chaplin), who is in love with Lord
Buckingham (Simon Ward), but
who also is ever faithfully guarded
from scandal by her musketeers
(Oliver Reed, Frank K'nlay, and
Richard Chamberlain).
These were, 1 suppose, a
combination of the Secret Service
and the White House Plumbers.
Richelieu sends evil Christopher
Lee and even more evil Faye
Dunaway to do away with the
Musketeers, and with Constance
(Raquel Welch) being kidnapped
and some religious war thrown in
for good measure (French history
was never my specialty), you
have the strand the Musketeers'

antics are hung on.
The Four Musketeers has
drawbacks galore, some of which
plagued the first movie as well,
but less noticeably. If you are
unsure of the historical aspect of
the times director Richard Lester
is recreating, expect to be
confused beyond hope. If you're
lucky, you may have a vague idea
of what's happening.
But the worst thing of all by
far — it would have been
justification for not releasing the
second half at all — is that it isn't
funny.
Admittedly, The Four has its
slapstick scenes, puns and sight
gags as the first one did, but in a
movie advertised as a comedy,
there is no excuse for the violent
beheadings, knifings, burnings,
murders and strangulations that
occur here.
The violence has the effect of a
nauseating mixture of The Three
(except that the swordfights are
bloodier here), Earthquake, with
concrete walls collapsing, and The
Towering Inferno, with burning
buildings and bodies. It is a brutal
shock to realize the direction in

which the movie goes.
Vie Four ceases to be humorous and
becomes a hard movie to watch
without squirming, for it is not
what you would expect with The
Three Musketeers in mind.
This is a disturbing jumble that
gets uglier and uglier with each
passing murder. All in all, it is a
very dissatisfying experience. If
this is a comedy, I'm Morris The
Cat.

Perennially the worst special of
the television season, this year's
Academy Awards ceremony
showed scant signs of
improvement. There was a general

lackluster feeling generated by
those participating, and the
ceremony plodded rather than
pranced.
However, this is a direct
improvement on previous years
when the show was just plain
boring. The film clips of previous
ceremonies — "Oscar's home
movies" — were almost as exciting
as this show, which doesn't say
much for it. They were interesting
up to a point, but their abundance
diminished their value and they
almost became a crutch for the
show to lean upon.
One of the improvements
though was the combination of
the nominated songs into a
medley, a stroke of genius.
Nothing has stopped other shows
dead in their tracks more than the
lousy renditions of the lousy
songs.
But the show returned to
tradition with the initial set of
gigantic Oscar statues and a
monstrous head of Oscar,
unbelievably tasteless and gaudy,
reminiscent of the commandment,
"Thoushalt not make unto thyself
graven image."
Everyone was expecting Ingrid
Bergman to cart off her third
Oscar for her cameo role in
Murder On The Orient Express,
for sentimental reasons.
Sentimentality had failed for
Astaire, but it didn't for Bergman,
for reasons beyond my
understanding. Her part was small
and dull. On the other hand,
Lauren Bacall's appearance in the
same movie was longer and better.
And if you're going to get
sentimental, Bacall has never
been nominated, while
Bergman has been nominated six
times.

had Carney not won, I would have
been equally pleased to see
Hoffman win, especially after his
losses for The Graduate and
Midnight Cowboy.
The year's two big movies,
Chinatown and The Godfather
Part II each garnered 11
nominations. Chinatown was
predicted to be the big winner,
mostly because of its quality and
the original Godfather's win in
1973. The sole exception in a
Chinatown sweep was Francis
Ford Coppola's winning the Best
Director award, having lost for the
original to Bob Fosse for Cabaret
(Fosse was also a nominee, for
Lenny), leaving Roman Polanski
out in the cold (which was fine
with me, because I considered the
second Godfather a picture highly
superior to its father and
Chinatown to be a depressing,
overlong exercise in boredom).
This supposed sweep netted
Chinatown a lone Oscar for
Robert Towne's screenplay. The
sequel, an epilogue and prologue
to the first, swept through with
twice the power and netted six
deserved awards, three of them
for' Coppola (screenwriting,
directing, and producing), who

had been nominated for five
separate awards for the evening.
His Conversation was nominated
for the top award, too; one
reviewer, in panning Part 11, said
he could tolerate garbage like it as
long as it permitted Coppola to
film movies like The
Conversation. On the whole, the
picture category had a glittering
array — Lenny, The Towering
Inferno, The Conversation, The
Godfather Part 11, and Chinatown
were all high on quality and
content. They were heavier and
more engrossing this year, whereas
last year mostly light, fluffy films
were nominated — The Sting, A
Touch of Class, American Graffiti
— and none of those carried the
power of this year's batch. It was
pointed out that all the
nominated movies dealt with
some form of corruption in
society, which means perhaps we
are recognizing our faults and
getting them into the open where
they can be dealt with. Things are
looking up.

There is a travesty being
perpetrated on the movie-going
public called The Four
Musketeers , the long-awaited
sequel to 1974's acclaimed and
popular Three Musketeers. Made
simultaneously, they've been
released as two two-hour movies
rather than one long one.
This is a brilliant idea in
theory, because if the first one is a
success, there is an instant
audience for the second (the
pitfall lies in making the first one
a success). Essentially, this is the
same movie as the first, and it's
almost as if you're returning from
an extended intermission.
There are the same familiar
actors as familiar characters,
which always increases one's
enjoyment of a movie. But I don't
understand how results of the two
films can be so different.
For those of you who just
walked in to the plot, Cardinal
Richelieu (Charlton Heston, in
another of his seemingly endless
disaster movies), thirsting for
power, conspires with the King of
France (Jean-Pierre Cassel) to
discredit the Queen (Geraldine

Chaplin), who is in love with Lord
Buckingham (Simon Ward), but
who also is ever faithfully guarded
from scandal by her musketeers
(Oliver Reed, Frank K'nlay, and
Richard Chamberlain).
These were, 1 suppose, a
combination of the Secret Service
and the White House Plumbers.
Richelieu sends evil Christopher
Lee and even more evil Faye
Dunaway to do away with the
Musketeers, and with Constance
(Raquel Welch) being kidnapped
and some religious war thrown in
for good measure (French history
was never my specialty), you
have the strand the Musketeers'

antics are hung on.
The Four Musketeers has
drawbacks galore, some of which
plagued the first movie as well,
but less noticeably. If you are
unsure of the historical aspect of
the times director Richard Lester
is recreating, expect to be
confused beyond hope. If you're
lucky, you may have a vague idea
of what's happening.
But the worst thing of all by
far — it would have been
justification for not releasing the
second half at all — is that it isn't
funny.
Admittedly, The Four has its
slapstick scenes, puns and sight
gags as the first one did, but in a
movie advertised as a comedy,
there is no excuse for the violent
beheadings, knifings, burnings,
murders and strangulations that
occur here.
The violence has the effect of a
nauseating mixture of The Three
(except that the swordfights are
bloodier here), Earthquake, with
concrete walls collapsing, and The
Towering Inferno, with burning
buildings and bodies. It is a brutal
shock to realize the direction in

which the movie goes.
Vie Four ceases to be humorous and
becomes a hard movie to watch
without squirming, for it is not
what you would expect with The
Three Musketeers in mind.
This is a disturbing jumble that
gets uglier and uglier with each
passing murder. All in all, it is a
very dissatisfying experience. If
this is a comedy, I'm Morris The
Cat.

Perennially the worst special of
the television season, this year's
Academy Awards ceremony
showed scant signs of
improvement. There was a general

lackluster feeling generated by
those participating, and the
ceremony plodded rather than
pranced.
However, this is a direct
improvement on previous years
when the show was just plain
boring. The film clips of previous
ceremonies — "Oscar's home
movies" — were almost as exciting
as this show, which doesn't say
much for it. They were interesting
up to a point, but their abundance
diminished their value and they
almost became a crutch for the
show to lean upon.
One of the improvements
though was the combination of
the nominated songs into a
medley, a stroke of genius.
Nothing has stopped other shows
dead in their tracks more than the
lousy renditions of the lousy
songs.
But the show returned to
tradition with the initial set of
gigantic Oscar statues and a
monstrous head of Oscar,
unbelievably tasteless and gaudy,
reminiscent of the commandment,
"Thoushalt not make unto thyself
graven image."
Everyone was expecting Ingrid
Bergman to cart off her third
Oscar for her cameo role in
Murder On The Orient Express,
for sentimental reasons.
Sentimentality had failed for
Astaire, but it didn't for Bergman,
for reasons beyond my
understanding. Her part was small
and dull. On the other hand,
Lauren Bacall's appearance in the
same movie was longer and better.
And if you're going to get
sentimental, Bacall has never
been nominated, while
Bergman has been nominated six
times.
The nominees for best actress
had been easy to choose — there
were really only five good
performances during the year. It's
safe to say that had Liv Ullman
and Scenes From A Marriage been
eligible, Diahann Carroll wouldn't
have been nominated for
Claudine, but we don't discuss
embarassing things like that.
Ellen Burstyn, twice before a
nominee (The Last Picture Show,
The Exorcist), admitted her
childhood ambition to win the
Oscar. Around 1971, she believed
herself more mature — it didn't
matter. But she confessed to Los
Angeles movie critic David
Sheehan, "Now I want an
Oscar!"
And she's delivered no
performance more deserving of it
than "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore. Valerie Perrine (rhymes
with McQueen) admittedly gave a
whopping portrayal of Honey
Bruce in Lenny, Gena Rowlands'
Mabel Longhetti in A Woman
Under The Influence was a
masterpiece, and Faye Dunaway's
performance in Chinatown was
thought to be one of the favorites,
but, because of the
unpredictability of the evening
and Burstyn's fame in a
group mostly made up of
newcomers, she was a likely
choice.
Ironically, her last role before

Alice was Harry Coombs'
daughter in Harry and Ton to. Her
father was played by Art Carney,
whose name brought gasps when
Glenda Jackson announced it as
winner. Unlike the best actress
competition, there wen 1 many
actors who deserved to be
nominated, Gene Hackman,
Richard Drey fuss, and James
Caan, to name a few. Instead, we
had Albert Finney unexplainably
for Murder On The Orient Express
(his second nomination, the first
coming 12 years ago for Tom
Jones), his Hercule Poirot the long
shot. I found the interpretation
unintelligible and unemotfonal.
Dustin Hoffman, following in
George C. Scott's footsteps,
proclaimed similar anti-Academy
feelings, but said of the award,
"You can't not accept it — they
give it to you," adding that his
producer would accept for him
should he win. Hoffman's Lenny
Bruce was a tour de force, and
had Carney not won, I would have
been equally pleased to see
Hoffman win, especially after his
losses for The Graduate and
Midnight Cowboy.

There is a travesty being
perpetrated on the movie-going
public called The Four
Musketeers , the long-awaited
sequel to 1974's acclaimed and
popular Three Musketeers. Made
simultaneously, they've been
released as two two-hour movies
rather than one long one.
This is a brilliant idea in
theory, because if the first one is a
success, there is an instant
audience for the second (the
pitfall lies in making the first one
a success). Essentially, this is the
same movie as the first, and it's
almost as if you're returning from
an extended intermission.
There are the same familiar
actors as familiar characters,
which always increases one's
enjoyment of a movie. But I don't
understand how results of the two
films can be so different.
For those of you who just
walked in to the plot, Cardinal
Richelieu (Charlton Heston, in
another of his seemingly endless
disaster movies), thirsting for
power, conspires with the King of
France (Jean-Pierre Cassel) to
discredit the Queen (Geraldine

Chaplin), who is in love with Lord
Buckingham (Simon Ward), but
who also is ever faithfully guarded
from scandal by her musketeers
(Oliver Reed, Frank K'nlay, and
Richard Chamberlain).
These were, 1 suppose, a
combination of the Secret Service
and the White House Plumbers.
Richelieu sends evil Christopher
Lee and even more evil Faye
Dunaway to do away with the
Musketeers, and with Constance
(Raquel Welch) being kidnapped
and some religious war thrown in
for good measure (French history
was never my specialty), you
have the strand the Musketeers'

antics are hung on.
The Four Musketeers has
drawbacks galore, some of which
plagued the first movie as well,
but less noticeably. If you are
unsure of the historical aspect of
the times director Richard Lester
is recreating, expect to be
confused beyond hope. If you're
lucky, you may have a vague idea
of what's happening.
But the worst thing of all by
far — it would have been
justification for not releasing the
second half at all — is that it isn't
funny.
Admittedly, The Four has its
slapstick scenes, puns and sight
gags as the first one did, but in a
movie advertised as a comedy,
there is no excuse for the violent
beheadings, knifings, burnings,
murders and strangulations that
occur here.
The violence has the effect of a
nauseating mixture of The Three
(except that the swordfights are
bloodier here), Earthquake, with
concrete walls collapsing, and The
Towering Inferno, with burning
buildings and bodies. It is a brutal
shock to realize the direction in

which the movie goes.
Vie Four ceases to be humorous and
becomes a hard movie to watch
without squirming, for it is not
what you would expect with The
Three Musketeers in mind.
This is a disturbing jumble that
gets uglier and uglier with each
passing murder. All in all, it is a
very dissatisfying experience. If
this is a comedy, I'm Morris The
Cat.

Perennially the worst special of
the television season, this year's
Academy Awards ceremony
showed scant signs of
improvement. There was a general

lackluster feeling generated by
those participating, and the
ceremony plodded rather than
pranced.
However, this is a direct
improvement on previous years
when the show was just plain
boring. The film clips of previous
ceremonies — "Oscar's home
movies" — were almost as exciting
as this show, which doesn't say
much for it. They were interesting
up to a point, but their abundance
diminished their value and they
almost became a crutch for the
show to lean upon.
One of the improvements
though was the combination of
the nominated songs into a
medley, a stroke of genius.
Nothing has stopped other shows
dead in their tracks more than the
lousy renditions of the lousy
songs.
But the show returned to
tradition with the initial set of
gigantic Oscar statues and a
monstrous head of Oscar,
unbelievably tasteless and gaudy,
reminiscent of the commandment,
"Thoushalt not make unto thyself
graven image."
Everyone was expecting Ingrid
Bergman to cart off her third
Oscar for her cameo role in
Murder On The Orient Express,
for sentimental reasons.
Sentimentality had failed for
Astaire, but it didn't for Bergman,
for reasons beyond my
understanding. Her part was small
and dull. On the other hand,
Lauren Bacall's appearance in the
same movie was longer and better.
And if you're going to get
sentimental, Bacall has never
been nominated, while
Bergman has been nominated six
times.
The nominees for best actress
had been easy to choose — there
were really only five good
performances during the year. It's
safe to say that had Liv Ullman
and Scenes From A Marriage been
eligible, Diahann Carroll wouldn't
have been nominated for
Claudine, but we don't discuss
embarassing things like that.
Ellen Burstyn, twice before a
nominee (The Last Picture Show,
The Exorcist), admitted her
childhood ambition to win the
Oscar. Around 1971, she believed
herself more mature — it didn't
matter. But she confessed to Los
Angeles movie critic David
Sheehan, "Now I want an
Oscar!"
And she's delivered no
performance more deserving of it
than "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore. Valerie Perrine (rhymes
with McQueen) admittedly gave a
whopping portrayal of Honey
Bruce in Lenny, Gena Rowlands'
Mabel Longhetti in A Woman
Under The Influence was a
masterpiece, and Faye Dunaway's
performance in Chinatown was
thought to be one of the favorites,
but, because of the
unpredictability of the evening
and Burstyn's fame in a
group mostly made up of
newcomers, she was a likely
choice.
Ironically, her last role before

Alice was Harry Coombs'
daughter in Harry and Ton to. Her
father was played by Art Carney,
whose name brought gasps when
Glenda Jackson announced it as
winner. Unlike the best actress
competition, there wen 1 many
actors who deserved to be
nominated, Gene Hackman,
Richard Drey fuss, and James
Caan, to name a few. Instead, we
had Albert Finney unexplainably
for Murder On The Orient Express
(his second nomination, the first
coming 12 years ago for Tom
Jones), his Hercule Poirot the long
shot. I found the interpretation
unintelligible and unemotfonal.
Dustin Hoffman, following in
George C. Scott's footsteps,
proclaimed similar anti-Academy
feelings, but said of the award,
"You can't not accept it — they
give it to you," adding that his
producer would accept for him
should he win. Hoffman's Lenny
Bruce was a tour de force, and
had Carney not won, I would have
been equally pleased to see
Hoffman win, especially after his
losses for The Graduate and
Midnight Cowboy.
The year's two big movies,
Chinatown and The Godfather
Part II each garnered 11
nominations. Chinatown was
predicted to be the big winner,
mostly because of its quality and
the original Godfather's win in
1973. The sole exception in a
Chinatown sweep was Francis
Ford Coppola's winning the Best
Director award, having lost for the
original to Bob Fosse for Cabaret
(Fosse was also a nominee, for
Lenny), leaving Roman Polanski
out in the cold (which was fine
with me, because I considered the
second Godfather a picture highly
superior to its father and
Chinatown to be a depressing,
overlong exercise in boredom).
This supposed sweep netted
Chinatown a lone Oscar for
Robert Towne's screenplay. The
sequel, an epilogue and prologue
to the first, swept through with
twice the power and netted six
deserved awards, three of them
for' Coppola (screenwriting,
directing, and producing), who

had been nominated for five
separate awards for the evening.
His Conversation was nominated
for the top award, too; one
reviewer, in panning Part 11, said
he could tolerate garbage like it as
long as it permitted Coppola to
film movies like The
Conversation. On the whole, the
picture category had a glittering
array — Lenny, The Towering
Inferno, The Conversation, The
Godfather Part 11, and Chinatown
were all high on quality and
content. They were heavier and
more engrossing this year, whereas
last year mostly light, fluffy films
were nominated — The Sting, A
Touch of Class, American Graffiti
— and none of those carried the
power of this year's batch. It was
pointed out that all the
nominated movies dealt with
some form of corruption in
society, which means perhaps we
are recognizing our faults and
getting them into the open where
they can be dealt with. Things are
looking up.
