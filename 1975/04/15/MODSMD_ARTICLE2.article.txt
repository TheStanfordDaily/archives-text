# ASSU Senators Vote To Drop Parking Suit
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Senate voted
unanimously last night to withdraw
support from a boycott of motor
vehicle registration fee payments and
to take the necessary steps to dismiss
its parking suit against the University.
The resolution also removed from
the spring ballot a special fee
assessment proposal for continued
funding of the parking suit.
The Senate also created a special
commission to look into the future of
the Course Review. Sen. Debbi Silton
was named chairwoman.
In addition, the Senate passed 8-3 a
motion that the editors and staff of
the Course Review be paid for work
they have done to date. The amount
would be determined by the special
commission and subject to Senate
approval. The salary payment was to
be contingent upon the return of all
Course Review materials to the Senate.
The motion also accepted the editors'
resignations.
Parking Agreement
The resolution on the parking issue,
submitted by Sen. Pieter Winsemius
was based on an agreement between
the University and the Senate that
parking enforcement and parking lot
maintenance costs will not be charged
to student housing accounts for the
period starting January 1, 1975.
The already-collected fees for
parking would be returned to the
student housing accounts, resulting
eventually in either a reduction or no
increase in housing fees.
According to the resolution,
present regulations will be changed to
allow on-campus students with
registered vehicles to park in lots
designated for off-campus students.

During a l'/i-hour discussion on the
Course Review, ASSU Vice President
Ann Carter reported that the Course
Review could publish this year with
the aid of a loan from the Dean of
Student Affairs' office. Loan
repayments would come from sales of
the Course Review. The loan would be
contingent upon ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri's evaluation of
the Course Review's ability to pay
back the loan.

the meeting, the former Course
Review editors contested Carter s

statement. They said they had done as
much work as they could without the
Senate's financial support.
Former editor Clifford Schireson
rejected the idea of taking a University
loan, saying it would "violate the
student nature and independence" of
the Course Review.
The editors expressed doubts about
their ability to pay back a loan
because they have received only about
$100 in firm advertising commitments
to-date
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
commented that the charge was like a
"Catch 22" — that the former editors
were being penalized for not
completing their job while the Senate
was refusing to give them the funds
necessary to finish their work.

commented that the charge was like a
"Catch 22" — that the former editors
were being penalized for not
completing their job while the Senate
was refusing to give them the funds
necessary to finish their work.
The ASSU Senate voted
unanimously last night to withdraw
support from a boycott of motor
vehicle registration fee payments and
to take the necessary steps to dismiss
its parking suit against the University.
The resolution also removed from
the spring ballot a special fee
assessment proposal for continued
funding of the parking suit.
The Senate also created a special
commission to look into the future of
the Course Review. Sen. Debbi Silton
was named chairwoman.
In addition, the Senate passed 8-3 a
motion that the editors and staff of
the Course Review be paid for work
they have done to date. The amount
would be determined by the special
commission and subject to Senate
approval. The salary payment was to
be contingent upon the return of all
Course Review materials to the Senate.
The motion also accepted the editors'
resignations.
Parking Agreement
The resolution on the parking issue,
submitted by Sen. Pieter Winsemius
was based on an agreement between
the University and the Senate that
parking enforcement and parking lot
maintenance costs will not be charged
to student housing accounts for the
period starting January 1, 1975.
The already-collected fees for
parking would be returned to the
student housing accounts, resulting
eventually in either a reduction or no
increase in housing fees.
According to the resolution,
present regulations will be changed to
allow on-campus students with
registered vehicles to park in lots
designated for off-campus students.

During a l'/i-hour discussion on the
Course Review, ASSU Vice President
Ann Carter reported that the Course
Review could publish this year with
the aid of a loan from the Dean of
Student Affairs' office. Loan
repayments would come from sales of
the Course Review. The loan would be
contingent upon ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri's evaluation of
the Course Review's ability to pay
back the loan.

the meeting, the former Course
Review editors contested Carter s

much work as they could without the
Senate's financial support.
Former editor Clifford Schireson
rejected the idea of taking a University
loan, saying it would "violate the
student nature and independence" of
the Course Review.
The editors expressed doubts about
their ability to pay back a loan
because they have received only about
$100 in firm advertising commitments
to-date
