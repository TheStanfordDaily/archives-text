# Vonk-Led Symphony Superb
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
SAN FRANCISCO—Two
weeks ago, under the baton of
guest conductor Hans Vonk, the
San Francisco Symphony gave a
perfect, f ine!y polished
performance. Wednesday night,
Vonk and the Orchestra surpassed
themselves and added an exciting
exhilaration that earned them
three rounds of applause and a
standing ovation.
Tst haikowskv' r Symphony No
4 in F Minor, Opus 36, is full of
romanticism and character that
the Orchestra played to the h'lt.
Grand majestic horns and
trumpets — fate knocking at the
door — opened the first
movement with an excitement
that characterized the entire
performance.
Vonk took the second
movement faster than it is often
played, but his interpretation
worked. The oboe solos

portraying a sweet melancholy,
were smooth and flawless in spite
of the tempo, and Vonk
occasionally slowed the
movement for emphasis of
expression.
The Scherzo is full of fun; the
strings have a pizzicato figure all
the way through, and the
woodwinds, brass, and strings play
with each other in different choirs
of sound. Vonk took this
movement very fast, but all the
difficult pizzicato and
sixteenth-note figures were light,
in tune, and together — perfect.
The final movement features
the same horn and trumpet figure
that opens the first movement, and
this clean and crisp interpretation
ended the piece in a bone-chilling
dramaticism that brought the
audience to its feet. This was one
of the best performances of the
season.
Pianist Radu Lupu was soloist

in Mozart's l*iano Concert No. 23
in A Major, K. -ISS.
The opening Allegro was
marred only slightly by
rhythmical problems in the strings
and woodwinds; these faults are
easily excusable, however, given
the subtle dynamic nuances that
expressively ended the movement.
Lupu's deliberate hands and
serious concentration brought out
the unusual melancholy for which
the Andante is famous. And
skillful phrasing and contrasting
dynamics in the I'resto brought
out the juxtapositions of major
and minor keys that exemplified
the quick changeability of mood
present in so many Mozart works.
The Orchestra was extremely
sensitive to Lupu; the softest
passages could be heard on the
piano even when accompanied by
the full orchestra.
The young Rumanian-born
1 upu has already joined the ranks
of the world's promising pianists;
with maturity he should become
one of the greats.
The Orchestra also played a
short contemporary piece entitled
the Variazioni Senza Thema
Polish Tadeusz Baird. It places the
xylophone in the unusual position
of portraying the main
"thematic" material.
Unlike many pieces of its
genre, the piece has a discernible,
"arch" form that gives coherence
to the otherwise dissonant
invasion of sound.
Judgement is difficult because
the piece is unfamiliar, but the
Orchestra seemed to play it very
well.
