Reinforcements Defend Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH — Government reinforcements engaged
insurgents in hand-to-hand fighting yesterday in a desperate
but apparently futile effort to save the vital highway linking
Phnom Penh to its airport.
There also were reports of rebel advance elements
penetrating the outskirts of the capital.
Field reports said insurgents had driven government
defenders out of a marketplace astride Route 3, cutting off
Phnom Penh from Pochentong airport, four miles to the
west and the encircled city's only lifeline to the outside.
Rebels punched into the western and northwestern edges
of the capital, burning refugee camps and sending
thousands of terrified civilians fleeing into Phnom Penh on
foot, ox carts and motorbikes.
The government airlifted reinforcements into the airfield
to join some 1000 defenders trying to hold a line along the
embankments of a railroad running beside Route 3, and
closequarter combat was reported. There also were reports
of a substantial force of Communist-led Khmer Rouge in
Samrong village, a mile north of the airport.
Explosions Rip Through Saigon
SAIGON — Three huge explosions ripped through a
bomb ammunition dump at Bien Hoa air base. 15 miles
northeast of Saigon, last night and early today, authorities
said. The blasts shook buildings in Saigon.
Two rounds of shellfire hit Bien Hoa earlier yesterday,
but no damage or casualties were reported at that time.
In addition to Bien Hoa, Communist-led forces shelled
government strongholds on three other sides of Saigon, but
the defenders held their positions.

Congress Defers Decision On Viet Aid
WASHINGTON — Members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee held what one termed a candid
discussion with President Ford yesterday on Indochina and
what the American role there can and should be.
At the Capitol, Senate Democrats deferred action on
resolutions proposing a continuing ban on use of U.S.
troops to evacuate South Vietnamese citizens.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) had
said earlier that the Senate Armed Services and Foreign
Relations Committees are actively considering the issues
raised by Ford's request for additional military- and
humanitarian aid to South Vietnam and for use of troops, if
necessary, to evacuate Americans and other nations.
Mansfield told the Democratic caucus that he "regards
that war in the sense of U.S. military involvement as over
for this nation."
Tax Deadline Falls Today
WASHINGTON — The day of reckoning falls today for
the 20 million or so Americans who haven't filed their
income tax forms yet, but tax rebates offer a ray of hope
this year for people who still owe money.
The deadline is midnight. The Internal Revenue Service
says any return carrying an April 15 postmark will be
considered on time.
Today's Weather
Showers likely through tomorrow with chance of
thundershowers. Snow showers likely on coastal mountains
down to near 2000 f eet. Continued cool. Lows tonight in
mid 30s to mid -10s. Highs today and tomorrow in upper
40s to mid 50s. Small craft advisory for westerly winds 15

Reinforcements Defend Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH — Government reinforcements engaged
insurgents in hand-to-hand fighting yesterday in a desperate
but apparently futile effort to save the vital highway linking
Phnom Penh to its airport.
There also were reports of rebel advance elements
penetrating the outskirts of the capital.
Field reports said insurgents had driven government
defenders out of a marketplace astride Route 3, cutting off
Phnom Penh from Pochentong airport, four miles to the
west and the encircled city's only lifeline to the outside.
Rebels punched into the western and northwestern edges
of the capital, burning refugee camps and sending
thousands of terrified civilians fleeing into Phnom Penh on
foot, ox carts and motorbikes.
The government airlifted reinforcements into the airfield
to join some 1000 defenders trying to hold a line along the
embankments of a railroad running beside Route 3, and
closequarter combat was reported. There also were reports
of a substantial force of Communist-led Khmer Rouge in
Samrong village, a mile north of the airport.
Explosions Rip Through Saigon
SAIGON — Three huge explosions ripped through a
bomb ammunition dump at Bien Hoa air base. 15 miles
northeast of Saigon, last night and early today, authorities
said. The blasts shook buildings in Saigon.
Two rounds of shellfire hit Bien Hoa earlier yesterday,
but no damage or casualties were reported at that time.
In addition to Bien Hoa, Communist-led forces shelled
government strongholds on three other sides of Saigon, but
the defenders held their positions.

Congress Defers Decision On Viet Aid
WASHINGTON — Members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee held what one termed a candid
discussion with President Ford yesterday on Indochina and
what the American role there can and should be.
At the Capitol, Senate Democrats deferred action on
resolutions proposing a continuing ban on use of U.S.
troops to evacuate South Vietnamese citizens.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) had
said earlier that the Senate Armed Services and Foreign
Relations Committees are actively considering the issues
raised by Ford's request for additional military- and
humanitarian aid to South Vietnam and for use of troops, if
necessary, to evacuate Americans and other nations.
Mansfield told the Democratic caucus that he "regards
that war in the sense of U.S. military involvement as over
for this nation."
Tax Deadline Falls Today
WASHINGTON — The day of reckoning falls today for
the 20 million or so Americans who haven't filed their
income tax forms yet, but tax rebates offer a ray of hope
this year for people who still owe money.
The deadline is midnight. The Internal Revenue Service
says any return carrying an April 15 postmark will be
considered on time.
Today's Weather
Showers likely through tomorrow with chance of
thundershowers. Snow showers likely on coastal mountains
down to near 2000 f eet. Continued cool. Lows tonight in
mid 30s to mid -10s. Highs today and tomorrow in upper
40s to mid 50s. Small craft advisory for westerly winds 15
