# Career Symposium To Begin
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
A two-wee-k "Reshaping the Professions" symposium
will begin tonight at 7:30 in Skilling Auditorium with a
panel discussion entitled "Professions and
Professionalism: A Contemporary Critique."
The panel will include Sandra Bern, assistant
professor of psychology, Sociology Prof. Francesca
Cancian, Anthropology/Sociology Prof. St. Clair Drake
and Andrew Parnes, director of SWOPSI. Parnes, Alan
Strain of Project Synergy' and others from SWOPSI,
SCIRE and Synergy are responsible for the symposium.
Its purpose is to give students an opportunity to
question the role of the professional in today's society
and to explore alternatives to overcrowded professions.
The symposium will feature 12 discussion panels,
each composed of Stanford faculty and administrators,
and local professionals and community members
involved in the fields of law and health care. "They are
people who have taken different routes and
alternatives," states Parnes.
The idea of the symposium stems from rising student

interest in career goals, according to Merlyn Paine,
SWOPSI and SCIRE assistant. "Several years ago, people
weren't involved much in the professions," she
explained. "They were much more involved in
alternatives. Now most of the students are involved in
preprofessional concerns."
These alternatives are becoming increasingly
important, SCIRE Director Alice Supton points out.
Universities are overloading professional job markets, so
some people now training for the traditional professions
are not going to be able to get jobs, she says.
The panels will touch on this problem, attempting to
give some insight into the present economic situation.
Supton adds, "There exists a real need for more people
in the fields of law and medicine, but no jobs for them."
Other specific sessions throughout the next two
weeks will deal with such topics as the changing of the
law school curriculum, the socialization of lawyers,
alternatives to the practice of law, women's health care,
work roles in a free clinic and "What Medicine Could
Be."
