# Lack Of Staff, Finances Kills Weekly 'Live Oak'
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Live Oak, a weekly student tabloid
that some saw as the only "real"
competition on campus to the Daily,
has ceased to publish, according to
Editor Fred Bierman.
Bierman, a freshman, cited two
reasons for his decision to stop
publishing: the paper's failing finances
and lack of sufficient staff.
The paper has been losing close to
$250 per issue in recent months, he
said, adding that the paper's reserve,

which reached a peak of
approximately $2500 in February, has
diminished to about $600.
Bierman said he "saw no way of
breaking the trend," because the ad
market has "fallen off."
Live Oak currently owes
approximately $1700, including $500
on a University loan and $600 in
printing bills, said Business Manager
Clement Chen.
Can Pay Off
"If we stop [publishing] now, we
can pay everyone off," said Bierman,
adding that the newspaper might not
be able to do so if it continued to
publish.
Chen, a sophomore majoring in
economics, disagreed with Bierman,
saying the newspaper could still pay all
its debts after one more issue, but "it
wouldn't do much good."
Both Bierman and Chen agree that
Live Oak lacks the staff to continue.
"We basically have eight people
who do jobs three times the size of a
reasonable job," said Bierman. Because
of this, he said, the staff has "burned
out."
"Everyone's been busting their balls
off," said Chen, adding that he alone
has been spending more than 20 hours
a week on the publication which he
says has become a "four- or five-man
operation."
Bierman said both he and News
Editor Bill Grueskin had been
averaging 35 hours per week.
The long hours, Bierman said, were
partially caused by the resignations of
three former editors. Onetime
Managing Editor Charlie Hall and

former Business Manager Diane
Simpkins resigned at the beginning of
this quarter to attend
Stanford-In-England, while former
Graphics Editor Bob Maguire resigned
to attend Stanford-In-France.
Hall formerly wrote an article every
week and did all copyreading and
proofreading. Bierman said. "We've
essentially had to fill three sets of
shoes after he left."
Both Bierman and Grueskin, a
sophomore in classics, agreed that
there is little chance of Live Oak
resurfacing in the future. "Plans are
indefinite but it's unlikely," Bierman
said.
Owes Weinstein
Among its other debts, Live Oak
owes its founder and former
Editor-Business Manager Bill Weinstein,
$410. according to Chen.
Live Oak's finances have been
rather shaky since its beginning in the
fall. The Publications Board gave the
paper $500 when it began to help pay
for capital improvements. The money
was given with the stipulation that all
capital investments such as typewriters
and light tables revert back to the
Board if Live Oak ceased to exist.
Students turned down a $1 fee
assessment for Live Oak last fall, and
that was a factor in the decision not to
go for such an assessment this spring,
said Bierman.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape said he was "surprised and
saddened."
When contacted last night at his
Seattle, Wash, home for his reaction,
Weinstein hungup on a Daily reporter.

its debts after one more issue, but "it
wouldn't do much good."
Both Bierman and Chen agree that
Live Oak lacks the staff to continue.
"We basically have eight people
who do jobs three times the size of a
reasonable job," said Bierman. Because
of this, he said, the staff has "burned
out."
"Everyone's been busting their balls
off," said Chen, adding that he alone
has been spending more than 20 hours
a week on the publication which he
says has become a "four- or five-man
operation."
Bierman said both he and News
Editor Bill Grueskin had been
averaging 35 hours per week.
The long hours, Bierman said, were
partially caused by the resignations of
three former editors. Onetime
Managing Editor Charlie Hall and

former Business Manager Diane
Simpkins resigned at the beginning of
this quarter to attend
Stanford-In-England, while former
Graphics Editor Bob Maguire resigned
to attend Stanford-In-France.
Hall formerly wrote an article every
week and did all copyreading and
proofreading. Bierman said. "We've
essentially had to fill three sets of
shoes after he left."
Both Bierman and Grueskin, a
sophomore in classics, agreed that
there is little chance of Live Oak
resurfacing in the future. "Plans are
indefinite but it's unlikely," Bierman
said.
Owes Weinstein
Among its other debts, Live Oak
owes its founder and former
Editor-Business Manager Bill Weinstein,
$410. according to Chen.
Live Oak's finances have been
rather shaky since its beginning in the
fall. The Publications Board gave the
paper $500 when it began to help pay
for capital improvements. The money
was given with the stipulation that all
capital investments such as typewriters
and light tables revert back to the
Board if Live Oak ceased to exist.
Students turned down a $1 fee
assessment for Live Oak last fall, and
that was a factor in the decision not to
go for such an assessment this spring,
said Bierman.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape said he was "surprised and
saddened."
When contacted last night at his
Seattle, Wash, home for his reaction,
Weinstein hungup on a Daily reporter.
Live Oak, a weekly student tabloid
that some saw as the only "real"
competition on campus to the Daily,
has ceased to publish, according to
Editor Fred Bierman.
Bierman, a freshman, cited two
reasons for his decision to stop
publishing: the paper's failing finances
and lack of sufficient staff.
The paper has been losing close to
$250 per issue in recent months, he
said, adding that the paper's reserve,

which reached a peak of
approximately $2500 in February, has
diminished to about $600.
Bierman said he "saw no way of
breaking the trend," because the ad
market has "fallen off."
Live Oak currently owes
approximately $1700, including $500
on a University loan and $600 in
printing bills, said Business Manager
Clement Chen.
Can Pay Off
"If we stop [publishing] now, we
can pay everyone off," said Bierman,
adding that the newspaper might not
be able to do so if it continued to
publish.
Chen, a sophomore majoring in
economics, disagreed with Bierman,
saying the newspaper could still pay all
its debts after one more issue, but "it
wouldn't do much good."
