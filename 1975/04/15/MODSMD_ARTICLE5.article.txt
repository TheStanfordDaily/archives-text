# McDermott Slate Proposes 'Incremental Change'
## 
### TERRY ANZUR Last of Five Parts 
Kevin McDermott, Bonny Rodden,
Andy Leuchter and Mark Simonian,
candidates for the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP), are waging a
campaign stressing limited ends
and limited means.
"Everybody's been looking for the
big changes for so long that they
overlook the incremental changes that
can be made to improve student life,"
Simonian says.
Among the "incremental changes"
proposed by the slate are regular
surveys of student opinion,
publication of University committee
agendas well in advance of meetings,
an off-campus shuttle bus service, a
Residential Visitors/Speakers Program
(RSVP), an independent
SWOPSI-SCIRE, a night eatery and
various publications, including a guide
to off-campus living.
McDermott and his running rentes
offer a cost-benefit analysis of each
proposal in their 25-page campaign
position paper. And they buttress their
platform with strong oppos«t«or to
what they call the "big bucks"
orientation of the current ASSU
administration.
Simonian admits, however, that

"[Financial Manager] Frank Olivieri
has done an excellent job of making
money for the ASSU. That money will
make interest to be used as an
endowment reserve for a non-profit
ASSU."
According to the slate members,
accumulated profits would serve as a
safety cushion for a break-even ASSU.
Under their system, all ASSU activities
would be expected to break-even. No
money-losing activities would be
subsidized with ASSU funds, unless
students specify support for the
programs through fee assessments.
"All ASSU proposals are risk
ventures," says McDermott. "Either
you charge the consumer a risk
premium or you can use an
endowment reserve to cover the risk."
Under McDermott's break-even
plan, "there would be no need for a
fulltime financial manager next year,"
he says.
Financial Balance
Simonian wants to replace
profit-making with "a balance that's
not too precarious once you set it up."
Should the balance tip too heavily on
the money-losing side, "we will go
back to a "big bucks" philosophy for
as long as necessary, 1 ' he adds.
McDermott objects to the current

practice of using profits from ASSU
Special Events to fund other projects.
"The students should know what their
dollars are subsidizing," he says.
The slate plans to lower Special
Events ticket prices for students. The
idea has drawn criticism from those
who believe that lower prices would
increase the quantity of demand for
tickets and cause security problems.
"It's obvious that we'll have to
increase security," Rodden says.
But she adds that concert security
problems are usually caused by
non-students. The slate's new ticket
policy would open early ticket sales to
students only and downplay Special
Events publicity off campus.
Opinion Research
The McDermott ticket plans to
heighten administration awareness of
student opinion through regular
surveys. Rodden denies that opinion
research would involve an inordinate
amount of expensive paper-shuffling.
Interviews would be conducted by
telephone or face-to-face, she says.
According to the, McDermott
platform, each survey would involve
17 man-hours of interviewing, and five
hours of correlating results. The cost
for 10 surveys is estimated at $550.

ASSU HOPEFULS — Kevin McDermott and running mates Bonny Rodden, Andy Leuchter and Mark Simonian stress
incremental changes and plan a break-even ASSU,
Thus the project apparently would not
meet the slate's "break-even" criterion
for ASSU activities.
Leuchter says the surveys will be
cheaper than referenda. A referendum
costs about $400, is limited in scope,
and usually reflects the views of only a
small percentage of students, he points
out.
McDermott believes that the
availability of survey results will boost
the effectiveness of student
representatives on University
committees.
The slate also advocates placing
students representatives on the Board
of Trustees' ad hoc committee on the
budget and on the Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee.
"Placing a student on the A&P
Committee is a long-range goal."
Simonian admits. "There's about as
much chance of doing it next year as
there is of preventing a rise in
Stanford's tuition."
But the slate also hopes to form a
student advisory panel on tuition.
McDermott was business manager
of the Quad last year. He is now an
ASSU senator, a member of several
committees, and president of Delta
Tau Delta fraternity. Leuchter has
directed several ASSU activities
including the Speakers Bureau and the
Guest-In-Residence program. Rodden
and Simonian have held editorial
positions on the Daily.
Rodden says she resents alleged
attempts to focus the campaign on

personalities, rather than issues. "It's
unfortunate that people have v resorted
to character assassination." she says,
responding to charges that previous
affiliations with the Daily were
parlayed into the newspaper's editorial
endorsements. She says she is
confident that "the voters will see
through those attacks."
The McDermott slate is different
from its opponents "because we're
giving the students the facts, not
rhetoric," says Rodden.
Simonian adds, "We're waging a
limited campaign, and we can deliver
everything we promise — including
burgers and pizza."
The burgers and pizza would come
from a proposed late-night eatery on
campus. "Why should students wait
two years for a pub when we could
have a night eatery now?" McDemott
asks.

Promotions (A&P) Committee.
"Placing a student on the A&P
Committee is a long-range goal."
Simonian admits. "There's about as
much chance of doing it next year as
there is of preventing a rise in
Stanford's tuition."
But the slate also hopes to form a
student advisory panel on tuition.
McDermott was business manager
of the Quad last year. He is now an
ASSU senator, a member of several
committees, and president of Delta
Tau Delta fraternity. Leuchter has
directed several ASSU activities
including the Speakers Bureau and the
Guest-In-Residence program. Rodden
and Simonian have held editorial
positions on the Daily.
Rodden says she resents alleged
attempts to focus the campaign on

personalities, rather than issues. "It's
unfortunate that people have v resorted
to character assassination." she says,
responding to charges that previous
affiliations with the Daily were
parlayed into the newspaper's editorial
endorsements. She says she is
confident that "the voters will see
through those attacks."
The McDermott slate is different
from its opponents "because we're
giving the students the facts, not
rhetoric," says Rodden.
Simonian adds, "We're waging a
limited campaign, and we can deliver
everything we promise — including
burgers and pizza."
The burgers and pizza would come
from a proposed late-night eatery on
campus. "Why should students wait
two years for a pub when we could
have a night eatery now?" McDemott
asks.
Kevin McDermott, Bonny Rodden,
Andy Leuchter and Mark Simonian,
candidates for the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP), are waging a
campaign stressing limited ends
and limited means.
"Everybody's been looking for the
big changes for so long that they
overlook the incremental changes that
can be made to improve student life,"
Simonian says.
Among the "incremental changes"
proposed by the slate are regular
surveys of student opinion,
publication of University committee
agendas well in advance of meetings,
an off-campus shuttle bus service, a
Residential Visitors/Speakers Program
(RSVP), an independent
SWOPSI-SCIRE, a night eatery and
various publications, including a guide
to off-campus living.
McDermott and his running rentes
offer a cost-benefit analysis of each
proposal in their 25-page campaign
position paper. And they buttress their
platform with strong oppos«t«or to
what they call the "big bucks"
orientation of the current ASSU
administration.
Simonian admits, however, that

"[Financial Manager] Frank Olivieri
has done an excellent job of making
money for the ASSU. That money will
make interest to be used as an
endowment reserve for a non-profit
ASSU."
According to the slate members,
accumulated profits would serve as a
safety cushion for a break-even ASSU.
Under their system, all ASSU activities
would be expected to break-even. No
money-losing activities would be
subsidized with ASSU funds, unless
students specify support for the
programs through fee assessments.
"All ASSU proposals are risk
ventures," says McDermott. "Either
you charge the consumer a risk
premium or you can use an
endowment reserve to cover the risk."
Under McDermott's break-even
plan, "there would be no need for a
fulltime financial manager next year,"
he says.
Financial Balance
Simonian wants to replace
profit-making with "a balance that's
not too precarious once you set it up."
Should the balance tip too heavily on
the money-losing side, "we will go
back to a "big bucks" philosophy for
as long as necessary, 1 ' he adds.
McDermott objects to the current

practice of using profits from ASSU
Special Events to fund other projects.
"The students should know what their
dollars are subsidizing," he says.
The slate plans to lower Special
Events ticket prices for students. The
idea has drawn criticism from those
who believe that lower prices would
increase the quantity of demand for
tickets and cause security problems.
"It's obvious that we'll have to
increase security," Rodden says.
But she adds that concert security
problems are usually caused by
non-students. The slate's new ticket
policy would open early ticket sales to
students only and downplay Special
Events publicity off campus.
Opinion Research
The McDermott ticket plans to
heighten administration awareness of
student opinion through regular
surveys. Rodden denies that opinion
research would involve an inordinate
amount of expensive paper-shuffling.
Interviews would be conducted by
telephone or face-to-face, she says.
According to the, McDermott
platform, each survey would involve
17 man-hours of interviewing, and five
hours of correlating results. The cost
for 10 surveys is estimated at $550.

"It's obvious that we'll have to
increase security," Rodden says.
But she adds that concert security
problems are usually caused by
non-students. The slate's new ticket
policy would open early ticket sales to
students only and downplay Special
Events publicity off campus.
Opinion Research
The McDermott ticket plans to
heighten administration awareness of
student opinion through regular
surveys. Rodden denies that opinion
research would involve an inordinate
amount of expensive paper-shuffling.
Interviews would be conducted by
telephone or face-to-face, she says.
According to the, McDermott
platform, each survey would involve
17 man-hours of interviewing, and five
hours of correlating results. The cost
for 10 surveys is estimated at $550.

ASSU HOPEFULS — Kevin McDermott and running mates Bonny Rodden, Andy Leuchter and Mark Simonian stress
incremental changes and plan a break-even ASSU,
Thus the project apparently would not
meet the slate's "break-even" criterion
for ASSU activities.
Leuchter says the surveys will be
cheaper than referenda. A referendum
costs about $400, is limited in scope,
and usually reflects the views of only a
small percentage of students, he points
out.
McDermott believes that the
availability of survey results will boost
the effectiveness of student
representatives on University
committees.
The slate also advocates placing
students representatives on the Board
of Trustees' ad hoc committee on the
budget and on the Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee.
"Placing a student on the A&P
Committee is a long-range goal."
Simonian admits. "There's about as
much chance of doing it next year as
there is of preventing a rise in
Stanford's tuition."
But the slate also hopes to form a
student advisory panel on tuition.
McDermott was business manager
of the Quad last year. He is now an
ASSU senator, a member of several
committees, and president of Delta
Tau Delta fraternity. Leuchter has
directed several ASSU activities
including the Speakers Bureau and the
Guest-In-Residence program. Rodden
and Simonian have held editorial
positions on the Daily.
Rodden says she resents alleged
attempts to focus the campaign on

personalities, rather than issues. "It's
unfortunate that people have v resorted
to character assassination." she says,
responding to charges that previous
affiliations with the Daily were
parlayed into the newspaper's editorial
endorsements. She says she is
confident that "the voters will see
through those attacks."
The McDermott slate is different
from its opponents "because we're
giving the students the facts, not
rhetoric," says Rodden.
Simonian adds, "We're waging a
limited campaign, and we can deliver
everything we promise — including
burgers and pizza."
The burgers and pizza would come
from a proposed late-night eatery on
campus. "Why should students wait
two years for a pub when we could
have a night eatery now?" McDemott
asks.
Kevin McDermott, Bonny Rodden,
Andy Leuchter and Mark Simonian,
candidates for the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP), are waging a
campaign stressing limited ends
and limited means.
"Everybody's been looking for the
big changes for so long that they
overlook the incremental changes that
can be made to improve student life,"
Simonian says.
Among the "incremental changes"
proposed by the slate are regular
surveys of student opinion,
publication of University committee
agendas well in advance of meetings,
an off-campus shuttle bus service, a
Residential Visitors/Speakers Program
(RSVP), an independent
SWOPSI-SCIRE, a night eatery and
various publications, including a guide
to off-campus living.
McDermott and his running rentes
offer a cost-benefit analysis of each
proposal in their 25-page campaign
position paper. And they buttress their
platform with strong oppos«t«or to
what they call the "big bucks"
orientation of the current ASSU
administration.
Simonian admits, however, that

"[Financial Manager] Frank Olivieri
has done an excellent job of making
money for the ASSU. That money will
make interest to be used as an
endowment reserve for a non-profit
ASSU."
According to the slate members,
accumulated profits would serve as a
safety cushion for a break-even ASSU.
Under their system, all ASSU activities
would be expected to break-even. No
money-losing activities would be
subsidized with ASSU funds, unless
students specify support for the
programs through fee assessments.
"All ASSU proposals are risk
ventures," says McDermott. "Either
you charge the consumer a risk
premium or you can use an
endowment reserve to cover the risk."
Under McDermott's break-even
plan, "there would be no need for a
fulltime financial manager next year,"
he says.
Financial Balance
Simonian wants to replace
profit-making with "a balance that's
not too precarious once you set it up."
Should the balance tip too heavily on
the money-losing side, "we will go
back to a "big bucks" philosophy for
as long as necessary, 1 ' he adds.
McDermott objects to the current

practice of using profits from ASSU
Special Events to fund other projects.
"The students should know what their
dollars are subsidizing," he says.
The slate plans to lower Special
Events ticket prices for students. The
idea has drawn criticism from those
who believe that lower prices would
increase the quantity of demand for
tickets and cause security problems.
"It's obvious that we'll have to
increase security," Rodden says.
