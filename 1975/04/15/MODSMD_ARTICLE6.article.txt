## Arrogance III 
### 
The decision of Joe Ruetz, head of the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation, to eliminate
all financial support to club sports programs strikes us as a
most arrogant, as well as unwise, move.
Ruetz made his surprise announcement last Wednesday
without ever having mentioned to interested parties that he
was contemplating such a move. When asked whether he
consulted anyone, Ruetz replied "the decision was mine and
mine alone. You cannot run a department with everyone
involved in the decision-making process."
Perhaps Ruetz' arrogant attitude is precisely the reason
that he made such a poor decision. The 16 club sports
programs which Ruetz eliminated from funding do not
simply benefit a few students; last year, for example, over
770 persons participated in club sports during each quarter.
Is it too much to ask that our Athletic Department,
particularly when spending money from the general
operating budget (much of which comes out of tuition),
provide students with programs such as club sports which
they utilize most?
The total saving by cutting club sports will be only about
$7500. While the $15,000 club sports budget will be
eliminated, Ruetz has arbitrarily chosen to fund three sports
crew, sailing and men's and women's volleyballâ€”at a level
of $7500 per year.
We call upon Ruetz to reconsider his decision. Surely, in
a department as large as his is, programs not benefiting so
many students could be cut.
