# YES On Wording

We urge a YES vote on the proposed ASSU
Constitutional Amendment altering "sexist" wording in the
Constitution.
This Amendment changes references from"he" to
"he/she" and from "him" to "him/her." This is a purely
cosmetic change, and is not one about which we feel
strongly.
Since, however, some people do feel strongly that
"sexist" wording be altered, and since because of other
amendments, the Constitution will probably have to be
retyped anyway, we urge passage of the amendment.
