The best way to tell what a
slate will really do in the future is
;to look at what they've done in
the past. We have worked in the
ASSU Senate, Save SWOPSI
Committee, Faculty Senate,
for Equity, ASSU
Nominations Committee,
Women's Center, Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, Campus
Judicial Panel and the
International Association.
Look at each slate's
philosophy. We believe it is the
job of the Council of Presidents to
maintain student services, help
students cut administrative red
tape and defend student rights.
Profit-making ventures are
necessary because the University
plans to cut the present $90,000
ASSU subsidy by half in 1976 and
withdraw it completely within
five years. We will not be an
isolated Council of Presidents.
Our programs need students to
make them work.
Look at each slate's programs.
Here are some of ours:
Student-ASSU Communication
Committee: To bring about
two-way communication between
students and the ASSU, we will
set up regular meetings of student
representatives (from residences
and off-campus), the Council of
Presidents, the Senate
chairperson, and the committee
staff assistant.
This way students will be
informed about developments in
the ASSU and the Administration,
and the Council of Presidents will
be made aware of student needs
that are not being met.
Course Review: The Course
Review should be completely
reformed. It should be free,
published quarterly and the forms

Rosenbaum, et al.

distributed by students. The
Council of Presidents can bring
about these changes.
A co-president chairs the
Course Review policy board.
Money could come from COP
funds, the ASSU Senate and the
Dean of Student Affairs Office,
which currently buys hundreds of
Course Reviews. It comes down to
having the expertise and energy to
re-think the Course Review and
get it funded. We have both.
Peer Advising: Each entering
student should have a peer adviser
as well as a faculty/administrator
adviser. Peer advisers should be
available on the departmental
level as well. Student interest in
Cowell's peer advising program,
the Bridge and departmental
student associations shows that
student volunteers are available. A
screening committee will select
the peer advisers, who will go
through a short Bridge program in
communication skills.
Graduate Students: The ASSU
can do more constructive things
for graduate students. We will
work for the implementation of
the Fellows Plan in those
departments where graduate
students want it. We will also
work to create low-cost child care
alternatives, eliminate audit fees
for student spouses and extend
Cowell health services to include
spouses and children.
Students should take a look at
our newsprint platform. They
should look at past experience —
look at philosophies — look at the
programs. Then they should vote
for those who will serve them
best.

Dave Galligan and Charlotte
Germane are candidates for the
ASSU Council of Presidents.)

distributed by students. The
Council of Presidents can bring
about these changes.
A co-president chairs the
Course Review policy board.
Money could come from COP
funds, the ASSU Senate and the
Dean of Student Affairs Office,
which currently buys hundreds of
Course Reviews. It comes down to
having the expertise and energy to
re-think the Course Review and
get it funded. We have both.
Peer Advising: Each entering
student should have a peer adviser
as well as a faculty/administrator
adviser. Peer advisers should be
available on the departmental
level as well. Student interest in
Cowell's peer advising program,
the Bridge and departmental
student associations shows that
student volunteers are available. A
screening committee will select
the peer advisers, who will go
through a short Bridge program in
communication skills.
Graduate Students: The ASSU
can do more constructive things
for graduate students. We will
work for the implementation of
the Fellows Plan in those
departments where graduate
students want it. We will also
work to create low-cost child care
alternatives, eliminate audit fees
for student spouses and extend
Cowell health services to include
spouses and children.
Students should take a look at
our newsprint platform. They
should look at past experience —
look at philosophies — look at the
programs. Then they should vote
for those who will serve them
best.
(Lee Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo,
Dave Galligan and Charlotte
Germane are candidates for the
ASSU Council of Presidents.)
The best way to tell what a
slate will really do in the future is
;to look at what they've done in
the past. We have worked in the
ASSU Senate, Save SWOPSI
Committee, Faculty Senate,
for Equity, ASSU
Nominations Committee,
Women's Center, Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, Campus
Judicial Panel and the
International Association.
Look at each slate's
philosophy. We believe it is the
job of the Council of Presidents to
maintain student services, help
students cut administrative red
tape and defend student rights.
Profit-making ventures are
necessary because the University
plans to cut the present $90,000
ASSU subsidy by half in 1976 and
withdraw it completely within
five years. We will not be an
isolated Council of Presidents.
Our programs need students to
make them work.
Look at each slate's programs.
Here are some of ours:
Student-ASSU Communication
Committee: To bring about
two-way communication between
students and the ASSU, we will
set up regular meetings of student
representatives (from residences
and off-campus), the Council of
Presidents, the Senate
chairperson, and the committee
staff assistant.
This way students will be
informed about developments in
the ASSU and the Administration,
and the Council of Presidents will
be made aware of student needs
that are not being met.
Course Review: The Course
Review should be completely
reformed. It should be free,
published quarterly and the forms

distributed by students. The
Council of Presidents can bring
about these changes.
