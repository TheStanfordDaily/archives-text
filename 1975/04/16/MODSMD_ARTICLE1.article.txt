# 'Daily' Stance On CJP Not Fair, Lyman Says
## 
### VLAK KERSHNER 
Beginning his appearance on
KZSU's Campus Conference with a
six-minute prepared statement,
President Richard Lyman last night
strongly attacked a Daily editorial
opposing the proposed new campus
judicial system, calling a passage in the
editorial "grossly misleading and
insulting."
Lyman's ire was raised by a
statement in the editorial, which
appeared Monday, saying that "the
time may come again when the
University tries to impede
demonstrators through the CJP
| Campus Judicial Panel |."
The Daily made the statement
while arguing against the proposal of
the Committee of 15 (C-15) which
calls for a new CJP with a faculty

majority in some cases. Students will
vote on whether to ratify the proposal
next Wednesday and Thursday.
Lyman said that the University had
never used the CJP to impede peaceful
demonstrations. He challenged the
Daily to cite specific examples of
when the University had done so.
Lyman also said that the Daily's
proposal that students boycott the
CJP by refusing to serve on the panel
could only be detrimental to students.
He said the only reason he set up the
current CJP in 1971 was that student
leaders had blocked the existing
judicial system by refusing to appoint
members to the panel.
Didn't Endorse
Lyman addressed his remarks at the
editorial specifically, ?nd did not
endorse or oppose the C-15 plan.
Asked to comment on why students
should support this plan when it
contained two elements — a faculty
majority in some cases and a different
method of selecting student and
faculty members — which have
previously been unacceptable to the
student body, Lyman said only,
"you'll have to ask the members of the
C-15."
He said the student, faculty and
administration members of the C-15
all had to compromise to formulate a
workable proposal. "The Daily's
all-or-nothing approach in effect
guarantees that nothing will win,"
Lyman said, urging students to give
the proposal "fairer and more
thoughtful treatment than it got in
Monday's Daily."
Asked about the alleged lack of
input in Athletic Director Joe Ruetz'
decision to cut off funding for club
sports, Lyman again attacked the
Daily. Referring to the newspaper's
editorial yesterday accusing Ruetz of
failing to get student input before
making his decision, Lyman said, "It's
a good example of the Daily's
insistence that every decision they
don't like is an arrogant one ... made
without input."
Educated Himself
Lyman said that Ruetz had
"educated himself as best he can," on
the club sports activities. He said, "It
is my understanding from Joe that
he . . . had discussions with the Club
Sports Council" before making his
decision.
But Ruetz, asked about Lyman's
statement, said "Dick misread me on
that." Ruetz did agree with Lyman
that he had carefully surveyed the
plusses and minuses of the club sports
before making the decision to cut off
$7500 in funding.
Ruetz noted that most of the
curtailed club sports will be able to
survive without University funding,
saying that "the sports hurt the most
will be lacrosse, skiing and ice
hockey." He noted that of these, only
lacrosse is played on the campus.
