## The 						Oscars: More Politics Than Pzazz Personalities Plus 
### STEVE HEFTER Steve Hefter 
H OLLYWOOD — After
presenting Towering Inferno's Joe
Biroc and Fred Koenekamp the
award for best cinematography,
Raquel Welch swept her way to
the press area in a skimpy,
clinging orchid evening gown and
talked with the Daily.
"I don't think as many stars
take the awards as seriously as
they used to," whimpered Raquel.
"It's still a lovely affair but
perhaps a little l<;ss significant."

With those words, the sex
symbol of the '70s ' capsuli/.ed
the feeling among many of the
celebrities and guests at the 17th
annual presentation of the
Academy Awards.
It wasn't as if the awards were
any different than in past years.
They weren't. They were just as
boring as ever. Yet the crowds still
turned out.
3000 On Hand
Braving a steady rain and
vicious winds, over
3000 onlookers huddled
under umbrellas and desperately
sought to catch a glimpse of the
movie stars in the flesh.
From all over the United
States, and from as far off as
Colombia and Poland, the masses
pressed inio the wooden bleachers
and waited in the rain for the
chauffeur-driven limousines to
arrive with the stars.
More than 130 police officers,
sheriff deputies and private
security guards patrolled the
Dorothy Chandler Pavillion to
prevent the overly enthusiastic
fans from rushing onto the path
appropriately provided for the
celebrated.
From Colombia
Mrs. Amparo Piedraita said she
flew in from Medallin, Colombia,
two weeks ago, to be sure that she
would be able to see the show.
"I just want to see all the big
stars in real life," she said, and
with that screamed, "Ryan, Ryan,
I love you!" as Ryan O'Neal
passed by.
There were the same screams,
the same longings to touch, the
same hungry faces as in years past.
Faces that pressed against the glass
windows of the pavillion looking
in from the rain as the beautiful
stars paraded around inside with
fashionable evening gowns and

tuxedoes and cocktails with
champagne.
Ugly And Grotesque
But what the crowd failed to
see were the many celebrities
missing from the event.
Biggies like Dustin Hoffman
and Al Pacino decided to stay
away this year. Hoffman,
following in the footsteps of
CJeorgf C. Scott and Marlon
Brando, said he would not accept
the Oscar if he won and called the
awards "ugly and grotesque,"
comparing them to a beauty
pageant.
Over a drink before the
presentations began. Jack
Lemmon reacted to Hoffman's
statement saying, "I'd have to
agree with him that theawardsare
somewhat like a beauty pageant,
but there still are those who will
come every year and it means a
lot to the industry."
Bergman And Bacall
This year's best supporting
actress winner and holder of three
Academy Awards, Ingrid
Bergman, said. "It is a great honor
to be selected by fellow film
artists," and noted that she would
prefer to see all five nominees
given awards rather than just one.
Lauren Bacall echoed
Bergman's sentiments saying, "Art
is not supposed to be
a competitive medium and I don't
think we should see actors
competing with each other for a
gold statue each year.
"I certainly would accept it,
but I'd rather see five winners
instead of just one."
Remembering Bogart
Bacall also noted that times
had changed since she and her
husband Humphrey Bogart had
attended the awards together.

"The crowds and the cameras arc
still here, but Hollywood has
changed.
"Those of us who've been
around a while don't relate as well
with the new celebrities, and the
unity which once filled the Santa
Monica Auditorium on awards
night is gone ... I suppose today's
bad economic times and the
tremendous drive for money has
something to do with it."
Politics
And as the value of the Oscars
has recently declined in the eyes
of many stars, new elements have

intruded.
Last year it was a streaker
doing his thing while Elizabeth
Taylor stood by. And this year it
was the politics of one Bert
Schneider which clouded the
purpose of the awards even
further.
While accepting the best
feature documentary award for
Hearts and Minds, an indictment
of America's part in the Vietnam
war, Schneider read a telegram
purportedly from the Viet Cong
representative at the Paris peace
talks.
The telegram thanked
Americans for "all they have done
on behalf of peace ..."
Valenti Responds
Later, Motion Picture
Association of America president
Jack Valenti responded, "I think
we ought to leave politics out of
the Academy Awards because this
| the awards | marks excellence in
art and art knows no politics.
"It leaps beyond political
boundaries and political
controversy. I think when you
introduce politics you introduce
the possibility of contaminating
the arena of art and I would not
be for that, just as I'm opposed to
the government being involved in
film in any kind."
Fnter Coppola
For Valenti, and others, the
Academy Awards had made a turn

tor the worse. Even best
screenwriter and best director
Francis Ford Coppola of
Godfather 11 entered the political
spectrum.
"I support Schneider's
statement and I accept it,"he
said. With that statement it
appeared that the Shirley Temple
days of thanking mom and pop
and the third grade teacher were
over ,
Coppola continued, Let the
people throughout the cities and

states of this country who think
that the orphans who were being
left in Vietnam are going to be
brutalized by inhuman invaders,
know that the North Vietnamese
people are considered the heroes
of their country, and Ho Chi Minh
is the George Washington of
North Vietnam. . . I'm not even a
politically active person but I've
done enough reading, enough
studying to know what the truth
is."
Best actor Art Carney stood
alone. "I'm 56 years old and I'm a

kid and I still got stars in my
eyes," be said. "I'm a rube and
I'm corny, but this isn't corn to
me, this is my work.
"I'm not the best actor of the
year. I was fortunate enough to be
in what I consider an artful and a
beautiful picture surrounded with
wonderful talent."
Deglitterization
At the gala ball following the
awards at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, Art Carney was not the
only one standing alone. The
deglitterization, if you will, of the
Academy Awards was making its
mark. Manv of the stars failed to

make an appearance and most of
those who did left early with just
a few friendly good-byes.
The only excitement was on
the faces of the onlookers as they
lined up behind the ropes as the
stars made their exits. Their faces
were the antithesis of celebrated
actress Katherine Ross, who
danced nonchalantly on the dance
floor with her new husband,
shedding not a smile nor a polite
hello to any of the stars like
Jennifer O'Neill, Bob Hope and
John Wayne dancing near her.
As Coppola, Mario Puzo and
others sat at their table with six
gold statues, the award-winning
director said, "I think I can make
films 100 times better than the
films I've made so far.
Saying It All
"I'm really looking forward to
having the opportunity to try
some more ambitious work —
riskier work. I just think that
what we can do with film — how
we can affect people — not in a
chauvinistic or political way is
extraordinary in that we haven't
seen the 10 th of it. I hope that I
can make films of that
importance."
Perhaps Francis Ford
Coppola's individual
determination symbolizes where
motion pictures and the Academy
Awards are headed. But I still

prefer what O.J. Simpson told me
at the dinner table in the ball
room.
"What do I think of the
awards?," he said. "Man, don't
bother with that stuff. Just drink
the wine, eat the meat, dance with
your young lady and enjoy
yourself. Forget about all this
political stuff. Go see a movie."

boundaries and political
controversy. I think when you
introduce politics you introduce
the possibility of contaminating
the arena of art and I would not
be for that, just as I'm opposed to
the government being involved in
film in any kind."
Fnter Coppola
For Valenti, and others, the
Academy Awards had made a turn

tor the worse. Even best
screenwriter and best director
Francis Ford Coppola of
Godfather 11 entered the political
spectrum.
"I support Schneider's
statement and I accept it,"he
said. With that statement it
appeared that the Shirley Temple
days of thanking mom and pop
and the third grade teacher were
over ,
Coppola continued, Let the
people throughout the cities and

states of this country who think
that the orphans who were being
left in Vietnam are going to be
brutalized by inhuman invaders,
know that the North Vietnamese
people are considered the heroes
of their country, and Ho Chi Minh
is the George Washington of
North Vietnam. . . I'm not even a
politically active person but I've
done enough reading, enough
studying to know what the truth
is."
Best actor Art Carney stood
alone. "I'm 56 years old and I'm a

kid and I still got stars in my
eyes," be said. "I'm a rube and
I'm corny, but this isn't corn to
me, this is my work.
"I'm not the best actor of the
year. I was fortunate enough to be
in what I consider an artful and a
beautiful picture surrounded with
wonderful talent."
Deglitterization
At the gala ball following the
awards at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, Art Carney was not the
only one standing alone. The
deglitterization, if you will, of the
Academy Awards was making its
mark. Manv of the stars failed to

make an appearance and most of
those who did left early with just
a few friendly good-byes.
The only excitement was on
the faces of the onlookers as they
lined up behind the ropes as the
stars made their exits. Their faces
were the antithesis of celebrated
actress Katherine Ross, who
danced nonchalantly on the dance
floor with her new husband,
shedding not a smile nor a polite
hello to any of the stars like
Jennifer O'Neill, Bob Hope and
John Wayne dancing near her.
As Coppola, Mario Puzo and
others sat at their table with six
gold statues, the award-winning
director said, "I think I can make
films 100 times better than the
films I've made so far.
Saying It All
"I'm really looking forward to
having the opportunity to try
some more ambitious work —
riskier work. I just think that
what we can do with film — how
we can affect people — not in a
chauvinistic or political way is
extraordinary in that we haven't
seen the 10 th of it. I hope that I
can make films of that
importance."
Perhaps Francis Ford
Coppola's individual
determination symbolizes where
motion pictures and the Academy
Awards are headed. But I still

prefer what O.J. Simpson told me
at the dinner table in the ball
room.
"What do I think of the
awards?," he said. "Man, don't
bother with that stuff. Just drink
the wine, eat the meat, dance with
your young lady and enjoy
yourself. Forget about all this
political stuff. Go see a movie."

H OLLYWOOD — After
presenting Towering Inferno's Joe
Biroc and Fred Koenekamp the
award for best cinematography,
Raquel Welch swept her way to
the press area in a skimpy,
clinging orchid evening gown and
talked with the Daily.
"I don't think as many stars
take the awards as seriously as
they used to," whimpered Raquel.
"It's still a lovely affair but
perhaps a little l<;ss significant."

With those words, the sex
symbol of the '70s ' capsuli/.ed
the feeling among many of the
celebrities and guests at the 17th
annual presentation of the
Academy Awards.
It wasn't as if the awards were
any different than in past years.
They weren't. They were just as
boring as ever. Yet the crowds still
turned out.
3000 On Hand
Braving a steady rain and
vicious winds, over
3000 onlookers huddled
under umbrellas and desperately
sought to catch a glimpse of the
movie stars in the flesh.
From all over the United
States, and from as far off as
Colombia and Poland, the masses
pressed inio the wooden bleachers
and waited in the rain for the
chauffeur-driven limousines to
arrive with the stars.
More than 130 police officers,
sheriff deputies and private
security guards patrolled the
Dorothy Chandler Pavillion to
prevent the overly enthusiastic
fans from rushing onto the path
appropriately provided for the
celebrated.
From Colombia
Mrs. Amparo Piedraita said she
flew in from Medallin, Colombia,
two weeks ago, to be sure that she
would be able to see the show.
"I just want to see all the big
stars in real life," she said, and
with that screamed, "Ryan, Ryan,
I love you!" as Ryan O'Neal
passed by.
There were the same screams,
the same longings to touch, the
same hungry faces as in years past.
Faces that pressed against the glass
windows of the pavillion looking
in from the rain as the beautiful
stars paraded around inside with
fashionable evening gowns and

tuxedoes and cocktails with
champagne.
Ugly And Grotesque
But what the crowd failed to
see were the many celebrities
missing from the event.
Biggies like Dustin Hoffman
and Al Pacino decided to stay
away this year. Hoffman,
following in the footsteps of
CJeorgf C. Scott and Marlon
Brando, said he would not accept
the Oscar if he won and called the
awards "ugly and grotesque,"
comparing them to a beauty
pageant.
Over a drink before the
presentations began. Jack
Lemmon reacted to Hoffman's
statement saying, "I'd have to
agree with him that theawardsare
somewhat like a beauty pageant,
but there still are those who will
come every year and it means a
lot to the industry."
Bergman And Bacall
This year's best supporting
actress winner and holder of three
Academy Awards, Ingrid
Bergman, said. "It is a great honor
to be selected by fellow film
artists," and noted that she would
prefer to see all five nominees
given awards rather than just one.
Lauren Bacall echoed
Bergman's sentiments saying, "Art
is not supposed to be
a competitive medium and I don't
think we should see actors
competing with each other for a
gold statue each year.
"I certainly would accept it,
but I'd rather see five winners
instead of just one."
Remembering Bogart
Bacall also noted that times
had changed since she and her
husband Humphrey Bogart had
attended the awards together.

"The crowds and the cameras arc
still here, but Hollywood has
changed.
"Those of us who've been
around a while don't relate as well
with the new celebrities, and the
unity which once filled the Santa
Monica Auditorium on awards
night is gone ... I suppose today's
bad economic times and the
tremendous drive for money has
something to do with it."
Politics
And as the value of the Oscars
has recently declined in the eyes
of many stars, new elements have

intruded.
Last year it was a streaker
doing his thing while Elizabeth
Taylor stood by. And this year it
was the politics of one Bert
Schneider which clouded the
purpose of the awards even
further.
While accepting the best
feature documentary award for
Hearts and Minds, an indictment
of America's part in the Vietnam
war, Schneider read a telegram
purportedly from the Viet Cong
representative at the Paris peace
talks.
The telegram thanked
Americans for "all they have done
on behalf of peace ..."
Valenti Responds
Later, Motion Picture
Association of America president
Jack Valenti responded, "I think
we ought to leave politics out of
the Academy Awards because this
| the awards | marks excellence in
art and art knows no politics.
"It leaps beyond political
boundaries and political
controversy. I think when you
introduce politics you introduce
the possibility of contaminating

3000 onlookers huddled
under umbrellas and desperately
sought to catch a glimpse of the
movie stars in the flesh.
From all over the United
States, and from as far off as
Colombia and Poland, the masses
pressed inio the wooden bleachers
and waited in the rain for the
chauffeur-driven limousines to
arrive with the stars.
More than 130 police officers,
sheriff deputies and private
security guards patrolled the
Dorothy Chandler Pavillion to
prevent the overly enthusiastic
fans from rushing onto the path
appropriately provided for the
celebrated.
From Colombia
Mrs. Amparo Piedraita said she
flew in from Medallin, Colombia,
two weeks ago, to be sure that she
would be able to see the show.
"I just want to see all the big
stars in real life," she said, and
with that screamed, "Ryan, Ryan,
I love you!" as Ryan O'Neal
passed by.
There were the same screams,
the same longings to touch, the
same hungry faces as in years past.
Faces that pressed against the glass
windows of the pavillion looking
in from the rain as the beautiful
stars paraded around inside with
fashionable evening gowns and

tuxedoes and cocktails with
champagne.
Ugly And Grotesque
But what the crowd failed to
see were the many celebrities
missing from the event.
Biggies like Dustin Hoffman
and Al Pacino decided to stay
away this year. Hoffman,
following in the footsteps of
CJeorgf C. Scott and Marlon
Brando, said he would not accept
the Oscar if he won and called the
awards "ugly and grotesque,"
comparing them to a beauty
pageant.
Over a drink before the
presentations began. Jack
Lemmon reacted to Hoffman's
statement saying, "I'd have to
agree with him that theawardsare
somewhat like a beauty pageant,
but there still are those who will
come every year and it means a
lot to the industry."
Bergman And Bacall
This year's best supporting
actress winner and holder of three
Academy Awards, Ingrid
Bergman, said. "It is a great honor
to be selected by fellow film
artists," and noted that she would
prefer to see all five nominees
given awards rather than just one.
Lauren Bacall echoed
Bergman's sentiments saying, "Art
is not supposed to be
a competitive medium and I don't
think we should see actors
competing with each other for a
gold statue each year.
"I certainly would accept it,
but I'd rather see five winners
instead of just one."
Remembering Bogart
Bacall also noted that times
had changed since she and her
husband Humphrey Bogart had
attended the awards together.

"The crowds and the cameras arc
still here, but Hollywood has
changed.
"Those of us who've been
around a while don't relate as well
with the new celebrities, and the
unity which once filled the Santa
Monica Auditorium on awards
night is gone ... I suppose today's
bad economic times and the
tremendous drive for money has
something to do with it."
Politics
And as the value of the Oscars
has recently declined in the eyes
of many stars, new elements have

intruded.
Last year it was a streaker
doing his thing while Elizabeth
Taylor stood by. And this year it
was the politics of one Bert
Schneider which clouded the
purpose of the awards even
further.
While accepting the best
feature documentary award for
Hearts and Minds, an indictment
of America's part in the Vietnam
war, Schneider read a telegram
purportedly from the Viet Cong
representative at the Paris peace
talks.
The telegram thanked
Americans for "all they have done
on behalf of peace ..."
Valenti Responds
Later, Motion Picture
Association of America president
Jack Valenti responded, "I think
we ought to leave politics out of
the Academy Awards because this
| the awards | marks excellence in
art and art knows no politics.
"It leaps beyond political
boundaries and political
controversy. I think when you
introduce politics you introduce
the possibility of contaminating
the arena of art and I would not
be for that, just as I'm opposed to
the government being involved in
film in any kind."
Fnter Coppola
For Valenti, and others, the
Academy Awards had made a turn

tor the worse. Even best
screenwriter and best director
Francis Ford Coppola of
Godfather 11 entered the political
spectrum.
"I support Schneider's
statement and I accept it,"he
said. With that statement it
appeared that the Shirley Temple
days of thanking mom and pop
and the third grade teacher were
over ,
Coppola continued, Let the
people throughout the cities and

states of this country who think
that the orphans who were being
left in Vietnam are going to be
brutalized by inhuman invaders,
know that the North Vietnamese
people are considered the heroes
of their country, and Ho Chi Minh
is the George Washington of
North Vietnam. . . I'm not even a
politically active person but I've
done enough reading, enough
studying to know what the truth
is."
Best actor Art Carney stood
alone. "I'm 56 years old and I'm a

kid and I still got stars in my
eyes," be said. "I'm a rube and
I'm corny, but this isn't corn to
me, this is my work.
"I'm not the best actor of the
year. I was fortunate enough to be
in what I consider an artful and a
beautiful picture surrounded with
wonderful talent."
Deglitterization
At the gala ball following the
awards at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, Art Carney was not the
only one standing alone. The
deglitterization, if you will, of the
Academy Awards was making its
mark. Manv of the stars failed to

make an appearance and most of
those who did left early with just
a few friendly good-byes.
The only excitement was on
the faces of the onlookers as they
lined up behind the ropes as the
stars made their exits. Their faces
were the antithesis of celebrated
actress Katherine Ross, who
danced nonchalantly on the dance
floor with her new husband,
shedding not a smile nor a polite
hello to any of the stars like
Jennifer O'Neill, Bob Hope and
John Wayne dancing near her.
As Coppola, Mario Puzo and
others sat at their table with six
gold statues, the award-winning
director said, "I think I can make
films 100 times better than the
films I've made so far.
Saying It All
"I'm really looking forward to
having the opportunity to try
some more ambitious work —
riskier work. I just think that
what we can do with film — how
we can affect people — not in a
chauvinistic or political way is
extraordinary in that we haven't
seen the 10 th of it. I hope that I
can make films of that
importance."
Perhaps Francis Ford
Coppola's individual
determination symbolizes where
motion pictures and the Academy
Awards are headed. But I still

prefer what O.J. Simpson told me
at the dinner table in the ball
room.
"What do I think of the
awards?," he said. "Man, don't
bother with that stuff. Just drink
the wine, eat the meat, dance with
your young lady and enjoy
yourself. Forget about all this
political stuff. Go see a movie."

talked with the Daily.
"I don't think as many stars

North Vietnam. . . I'm not even a
politically active person but I've
done enough reading, enough
studying to know what the truth
is."
Best actor Art Carney stood
alone. "I'm 56 years old and I'm a

kid and I still got stars in my
eyes," be said. "I'm a rube and
I'm corny, but this isn't corn to
me, this is my work.
"I'm not the best actor of the
year. I was fortunate enough to be
in what I consider an artful and a
beautiful picture surrounded with
wonderful talent."
Deglitterization
At the gala ball following the
awards at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, Art Carney was not the
only one standing alone. The
deglitterization, if you will, of the
Academy Awards was making its
mark. Manv of the stars failed to

make an appearance and most of
those who did left early with just
a few friendly good-byes.
The only excitement was on
the faces of the onlookers as they
lined up behind the ropes as the
stars made their exits. Their faces
were the antithesis of celebrated
actress Katherine Ross, who
danced nonchalantly on the dance
floor with her new husband,
shedding not a smile nor a polite
hello to any of the stars like
Jennifer O'Neill, Bob Hope and
John Wayne dancing near her.
As Coppola, Mario Puzo and
others sat at their table with six
gold statues, the award-winning
director said, "I think I can make
films 100 times better than the
films I've made so far.
Saying It All
"I'm really looking forward to
having the opportunity to try
some more ambitious work —
riskier work. I just think that
what we can do with film — how
we can affect people — not in a
chauvinistic or political way is
extraordinary in that we haven't
seen the 10 th of it. I hope that I
can make films of that
importance."
Perhaps Francis Ford
Coppola's individual
determination symbolizes where
motion pictures and the Academy
Awards are headed. But I still

prefer what O.J. Simpson told me
at the dinner table in the ball
room.
"What do I think of the
awards?," he said. "Man, don't
bother with that stuff. Just drink
the wine, eat the meat, dance with
your young lady and enjoy
yourself. Forget about all this
political stuff. Go see a movie."

H OLLYWOOD — After
presenting Towering Inferno's Joe
Biroc and Fred Koenekamp the
award for best cinematography,
Raquel Welch swept her way to
the press area in a skimpy,
clinging orchid evening gown and
talked with the Daily.
"I don't think as many stars
take the awards as seriously as
they used to," whimpered Raquel.
"It's still a lovely affair but
perhaps a little l<;ss significant."

With those words, the sex
symbol of the '70s ' capsuli/.ed
the feeling among many of the
celebrities and guests at the 17th
annual presentation of the
Academy Awards.
It wasn't as if the awards were
any different than in past years.
They weren't. They were just as
boring as ever. Yet the crowds still
turned out.
3000 On Hand
Braving a steady rain and
vicious winds, over
3000 onlookers huddled
under umbrellas and desperately
sought to catch a glimpse of the
movie stars in the flesh.
From all over the United
States, and from as far off as
Colombia and Poland, the masses
pressed inio the wooden bleachers
and waited in the rain for the
chauffeur-driven limousines to
arrive with the stars.
More than 130 police officers,
sheriff deputies and private
security guards patrolled the
Dorothy Chandler Pavillion to
prevent the overly enthusiastic
fans from rushing onto the path
appropriately provided for the
celebrated.
From Colombia
Mrs. Amparo Piedraita said she
flew in from Medallin, Colombia,
two weeks ago, to be sure that she
would be able to see the show.
"I just want to see all the big
stars in real life," she said, and
with that screamed, "Ryan, Ryan,
I love you!" as Ryan O'Neal
passed by.
There were the same screams,
the same longings to touch, the
same hungry faces as in years past.
Faces that pressed against the glass
windows of the pavillion looking
in from the rain as the beautiful
stars paraded around inside with
fashionable evening gowns and

tuxedoes and cocktails with
champagne.
Ugly And Grotesque
But what the crowd failed to
see were the many celebrities
missing from the event.
Biggies like Dustin Hoffman
and Al Pacino decided to stay
away this year. Hoffman,
following in the footsteps of
CJeorgf C. Scott and Marlon
Brando, said he would not accept
the Oscar if he won and called the
awards "ugly and grotesque,"
comparing them to a beauty
pageant.
Over a drink before the
presentations began. Jack
Lemmon reacted to Hoffman's
statement saying, "I'd have to
agree with him that theawardsare
somewhat like a beauty pageant,
but there still are those who will
come every year and it means a
lot to the industry."
Bergman And Bacall
This year's best supporting
actress winner and holder of three
Academy Awards, Ingrid
Bergman, said. "It is a great honor
to be selected by fellow film
artists," and noted that she would
prefer to see all five nominees
given awards rather than just one.
Lauren Bacall echoed
Bergman's sentiments saying, "Art
is not supposed to be
a competitive medium and I don't
think we should see actors
competing with each other for a
gold statue each year.
"I certainly would accept it,
but I'd rather see five winners
instead of just one."
Remembering Bogart
Bacall also noted that times
had changed since she and her
husband Humphrey Bogart had
attended the awards together.

"The crowds and the cameras arc
still here, but Hollywood has
changed.
"Those of us who've been
around a while don't relate as well
with the new celebrities, and the
unity which once filled the Santa
Monica Auditorium on awards
night is gone ... I suppose today's
bad economic times and the
tremendous drive for money has
something to do with it."
Politics
And as the value of the Oscars
has recently declined in the eyes
of many stars, new elements have

intruded.
Last year it was a streaker
doing his thing while Elizabeth
Taylor stood by. And this year it
was the politics of one Bert
Schneider which clouded the
purpose of the awards even
further.
While accepting the best
feature documentary award for
Hearts and Minds, an indictment
of America's part in the Vietnam
war, Schneider read a telegram
purportedly from the Viet Cong
representative at the Paris peace
talks.
The telegram thanked
Americans for "all they have done
on behalf of peace ..."
Valenti Responds
Later, Motion Picture
Association of America president
Jack Valenti responded, "I think
we ought to leave politics out of
the Academy Awards because this
| the awards | marks excellence in
art and art knows no politics.
"It leaps beyond political
boundaries and political
controversy. I think when you
introduce politics you introduce
the possibility of contaminating
the arena of art and I would not
be for that, just as I'm opposed to
the government being involved in
film in any kind."
Fnter Coppola
For Valenti, and others, the
Academy Awards had made a turn

tor the worse. Even best
screenwriter and best director
Francis Ford Coppola of
Godfather 11 entered the political
spectrum.
"I support Schneider's
statement and I accept it,"he
said. With that statement it
appeared that the Shirley Temple
days of thanking mom and pop
and the third grade teacher were
over ,
Coppola continued, Let the
people throughout the cities and

states of this country who think
that the orphans who were being
left in Vietnam are going to be
brutalized by inhuman invaders,
know that the North Vietnamese
people are considered the heroes
of their country, and Ho Chi Minh
is the George Washington of
North Vietnam. . . I'm not even a
politically active person but I've
done enough reading, enough
studying to know what the truth
is."
Best actor Art Carney stood
alone. "I'm 56 years old and I'm a
