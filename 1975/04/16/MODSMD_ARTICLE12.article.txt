## Cardinal Confusion A 						Big Mistake, Folks 
### Dan Pyne 
Leland Stanford Junior University, reputedly a
leader in areas of academic innovation, is shafting
the world's most popular sport.
That's right, soccer has been demoted to a
varsity club sport.
It makes sense, doesn't it? In the midst of a
nationwide soccerboom, and in a region where
soccer is rapidly becoming an extremely popular
sport, the Stanford Athletic Department is cutting
its program.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz says it's because of
the economy. The Federal Reserve simply allowed
too much excess cash into the system, you see, and
government control has created artificially high
prices in which case the marginal cost of each and
so forth, blah blah blah.
Unfortunately, his argument does not hold
water. The soccer budget is about as substantial as a
breakfast of cardboard, and cutting it hardly makes
a dent in the Athletic Department expenditures.
Mv guess is that the world's number one was
dropped in fear - the fear of increased costs next
year. Under Title IX a varsity soccer program
would have to be expanded to include women. And
since a stubborn women's program managed to
survive this year on its own, there is a clear
indication that a women's team would be
necessar\.
Ruetz also said, however, that soccer was denied
varsity status by two criteria: it does not have
conference championships, and it does not have a
full-time coach.
Catch 22. Soccer doesn't have a full-time coach

because no one wants to hire one. Fred Priddle, the
present coach, receives a very minimal salary, and is
employed by the University somewhat obscurely as
either a groundskeeper or a physical education
teacher. In either case he probably puts in as many
hours as a full-time coach, and he's been around for
a very, very long time.
The soccer team does have a conference
championship — specifically, the NCAAs, more
obscurely the Far West regional title — but what
Ruetz probably wants is a Pac-8 conference, and
that was voted down by the Pac-8 Athletic-
Directors.
But most bizarre in this display of athletic
narrowmindedness is the fact that the team was
never really informed of the move. It was mr.de,
and that was that. The change is primarily one of
status — the budgetary concerns are secondary at
this point. Moving soccer down put it out of the
way.
Unfortunately, it may be there to stay.
Recruiting measures will obviously be affected,
which will mean less of America's growing soccer
talent will come to the Farm, thus Stanford will
have gradually weaker teams in the face of other
schools' improvement, and that will virtually
eliminate any chance of a return to varsity status
for the sport.
But educated Stanford tells the world, "Who
was Pele, anyway???"
I hope some people in the Athletic Department
come to their senses before they make Stanford
look more foolish than it is becoming.

year. Under Title IX a varsity soccer program
would have to be expanded to include women. And
since a stubborn women's program managed to
survive this year on its own, there is a clear
indication that a women's team would be
necessar\.
Ruetz also said, however, that soccer was denied
varsity status by two criteria: it does not have
conference championships, and it does not have a
full-time coach.
Catch 22. Soccer doesn't have a full-time coach

because no one wants to hire one. Fred Priddle, the
present coach, receives a very minimal salary, and is
employed by the University somewhat obscurely as
either a groundskeeper or a physical education
teacher. In either case he probably puts in as many
hours as a full-time coach, and he's been around for
a very, very long time.
The soccer team does have a conference
championship — specifically, the NCAAs, more
obscurely the Far West regional title — but what
Ruetz probably wants is a Pac-8 conference, and
that was voted down by the Pac-8 Athletic-
Directors.
But most bizarre in this display of athletic
narrowmindedness is the fact that the team was
never really informed of the move. It was mr.de,
and that was that. The change is primarily one of
status — the budgetary concerns are secondary at
this point. Moving soccer down put it out of the
way.
Unfortunately, it may be there to stay.
Recruiting measures will obviously be affected,
which will mean less of America's growing soccer
talent will come to the Farm, thus Stanford will
have gradually weaker teams in the face of other
schools' improvement, and that will virtually
eliminate any chance of a return to varsity status
for the sport.
But educated Stanford tells the world, "Who
was Pele, anyway???"
I hope some people in the Athletic Department
come to their senses before they make Stanford
look more foolish than it is becoming.

Leland Stanford Junior University, reputedly a
leader in areas of academic innovation, is shafting
the world's most popular sport.
That's right, soccer has been demoted to a
varsity club sport.
It makes sense, doesn't it? In the midst of a
nationwide soccerboom, and in a region where
soccer is rapidly becoming an extremely popular
sport, the Stanford Athletic Department is cutting
its program.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz says it's because of
the economy. The Federal Reserve simply allowed
too much excess cash into the system, you see, and
government control has created artificially high
prices in which case the marginal cost of each and
so forth, blah blah blah.
Unfortunately, his argument does not hold
water. The soccer budget is about as substantial as a
breakfast of cardboard, and cutting it hardly makes
a dent in the Athletic Department expenditures.
Mv guess is that the world's number one was
dropped in fear - the fear of increased costs next
year. Under Title IX a varsity soccer program
would have to be expanded to include women. And
since a stubborn women's program managed to
survive this year on its own, there is a clear
indication that a women's team would be
