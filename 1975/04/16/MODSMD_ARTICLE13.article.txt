# Batsmen Shellack St. Mary's

### TOM GALLIGAN 
It just wasn't Tony Siani's day
yesterday.
Siani plays, or (more
appropriate to his effort yesterday
at Sunken Diamond) at least tries
to play third base for St. Mary's
baseball team, which lost to
the Cardinal varsity, 7-1.
Tony was errorless until the
fifth Stanford batter came to the
plate in the bottom of the first.
Two runs had scored, and men
were on base. Stanford left fielder
Randy Wong attempted a sacrifice
bunt, but hit an easy pop fly
which Siani commenced to drop

. . . and then he tripped over it.
Well, Tony pounded his mitt
and tried again. Two errorless
innings passed, in which he made
three shaky plays. But in the
fourth Tony dropped a slow roller
in front of himself, and proceeded
to boot it around the infield.
Admittedly, Tony did score St.
Mary's only run.and the way he
did it would make Bill Veeck
proud. In the second inning Siani
was on third, taking a big lead, so
Stanford catcher Dave Baker tried
to throw him out. Tony sort of
turned round and crouched, a;id
the ball hit him in the shoulder, h

bounced into the outfield and
Siani hobbled home.
ThaL was all the Gaels could
muster.
Despite some control problems
sophomore Jim Scharffenberger
kept St. Mary's guessing, and
pitched his way out of many jams
and into his third vareity victory.
Southpaw Jerry Argust.
coming off an injury that has kept
him off the mound for half the
season, pitched the final two
innings and set the Gaels down in
order, striking out three with a
hard fastball and a good curve.
Offensively, the Cardinals
pounded out 10 hits. leading the
attack was first baseman Tom
Guardino, with three hits
including a 100-foot-plus home
run over the left field wall and
onto Harry Maloney field. It was
his seventh of the year.
Sieve Davis homered in the
>amt' inning as Guardino, the
st-vL.ith, his was a line shot over
the left field fence. Dave Baker.
Bruce Robinson, Gary Pitch ford,
and Pepe Hinojosa each had two
hits apiece.
