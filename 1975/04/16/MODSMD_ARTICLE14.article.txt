# Collegiate Invitational Golf Here Tomorrow
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
The U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, college golf's answer
to the 5 p.m. rush hour, begins
tomorrow morning on the
Stanford course
A field of 192 players
representing 32 teams will crowd
onto the. course between dawn
and dusk tomorrow and Friday,
with the field trimmed to the low
16 teams and ties for Saturday's
final 18 holes of the 51 hole
event.
Unfortunately, though, it takes
more than quantity to build a
quality golf tournament. The
eighth annual U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, like most of the
seven previous tourneys, will
almost certainly boil down to a
dual match between just two of
the .'5l teams: Stanford and San
Jos<- State.
The Cards and Spirtans have
finished 1-2 in the tournament
five straight years, and San .lose
State coach .lerr\ Vrooni has
begun to accept the bridesmaid's
role. "We're just coming lip for
our annual second place finish."
Vroom said Monday.
Stanford coach Mud Finger,
however, considers San Jose State
the favorite. "They've been
playing outstanding golf." Finger
said. "They'll be awfully tough to
beat."
So far this season the Cards
and Spartans have met six times in
tournaments and dual matches,
with San .lose State topping
Stanford four times.
The Spartans are led b\ seniors
Jim Knoll, Mark L\e and Scott
Hoyt, who finished 1-2-.'} last
week in the UOP Invitational at
Lodi.
The Cardinals, playing at fullj

strength for the first time in two
weeks, will counter with a startin•
lineup of defending champion
Dave Baskins, 1973 champion
Conrad Nilmeier, Alv Trompas,
Mike Peck, (Jeorge Pettinger and
Jav Johnston.
Lye, who won the Western
Intercollegiates last month, and
Baskins, the recently crowned San
Francisco City champion, are
considered co-favorites in the
individual competition.
Baskins seems to be fully
recovered from a post-City slump.
He shot 73-74 in the final two
rounds at Lodi, and fired a
one-under-par 70 against
California on Saturday. "I'm
starting to play my normal game
again," Baskins said. "After I won
the City, I wanted to win another
tournament so bad that 1 was
really pressing."
Admission is free to all three
rounds of the tournament.

Jav Johnston.
Lye, who won the Western
Intercollegiates last month, and
Baskins, the recently crowned San
Francisco City champion, are
considered co-favorites in the
individual competition.
Baskins seems to be fully
recovered from a post-City slump.
He shot 73-74 in the final two
rounds at Lodi, and fired a
one-under-par 70 against
California on Saturday. "I'm
starting to play my normal game
again," Baskins said. "After I won
the City, I wanted to win another
tournament so bad that 1 was
really pressing."

rounds of the tournament.
The U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, college golf's answer
to the 5 p.m. rush hour, begins
tomorrow morning on the
Stanford course
A field of 192 players
representing 32 teams will crowd
onto the. course between dawn
and dusk tomorrow and Friday,
with the field trimmed to the low
16 teams and ties for Saturday's
final 18 holes of the 51 hole
event.
Unfortunately, though, it takes
more than quantity to build a
quality golf tournament. The
eighth annual U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, like most of the
seven previous tourneys, will
almost certainly boil down to a
dual match between just two of
the .'5l teams: Stanford and San
Jos<- State.
The Cards and Spirtans have
finished 1-2 in the tournament
five straight years, and San .lose
State coach .lerr\ Vrooni has
begun to accept the bridesmaid's
role. "We're just coming lip for
our annual second place finish."
Vroom said Monday.
Stanford coach Mud Finger,
however, considers San Jose State
the favorite. "They've been
playing outstanding golf." Finger
said. "They'll be awfully tough to
beat."
So far this season the Cards
and Spartans have met six times in
tournaments and dual matches,
with San .lose State topping
Stanford four times.
The Spartans are led b\ seniors
