### PRIMO SANTINI 
On March 12, soccer officially
became a member of the newly
created category of varsity club
sports, but Fred Priddle, socc»*r
coach, has yet to be officially
notified of this decision and its
consequences for Stanford's
soccer program.
"1 haven't learned yet, for
certain,*' said Priddle in response
io a question concerning when he
was first told of soccer's new and
lower status. "1 haven't been told
officially. I have submitted my
budget for next year and nothing
has been done on that."
But Joe Ruetz, head of the
Department of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation, says
soccer's new status is permanent,
citing the current economic
crunch and the fact that, "Soccer
didn't fit the definition I drew up
for varsity sports" as reasons for
his "reclassification" of soccer.
Two of Ruetz's criteria for
defining a varsity sport are the
existence of a conference
championship and a full-time
coach. Priddle receives a minimal
salary as a "contract coach" and
the soccer team does not compete
in the Pac-8 conference but in
the Northern California
Intercollegiate Soccer Conference.
The funds are not available to
hire a full time coach, says Ruetz,
and the formation of the Pacific
Right soccer league was voted
down in December of 197 1 by the
league's athletic directors.
Ruetz views his decis on as an
acknowledgement of the present
stage of development of soccer at
Stanford as opposed to a
demotion of the sport to varsity
club status.
"By doing this, the possibility
of developing the sport and
re-assigning it varsity status

remains," said Ruetz.
Robby Robb, a member of the
soccer team and three year
letterman, sees the move as
indicative of the athletic
department's lack of commitment
to the soccer program.
He questions the amount of
commitment the department has
to a varsity program when last
year that program did not have a
full-time coach and existed on a
budget of approximately $7000.
"This decision is an insult to
the people who are playing. It is
like saying they are not athletes."

said Hobb.
Both Kobb and Priddle feel
soccer's new classification will
halt effective recruiting and stunt
the growth of the sport at
Stanford. Neither individual feels
the decrease in monetary support
is as crucial as the change in
status.
"The only thing that bothers
me is the varsity club status and
the trouble I'll have in Retting the
boys to come here. They tell me
'If it's going to be a club sport, I
want to go where it is a varsity
sport'," said Priddle.

remains," said Ruetz.
Robby Robb, a member of the
soccer team and three year
letterman, sees the move as
indicative of the athletic
department's lack of commitment
to the soccer program.
He questions the amount of
commitment the department has
to a varsity program when last
year that program did not have a
full-time coach and existed on a
budget of approximately $7000.
"This decision is an insult to
the people who are playing. It is
like saying they are not athletes."

said Hobb.
Both Kobb and Priddle feel
soccer's new classification will
halt effective recruiting and stunt
the growth of the sport at
Stanford. Neither individual feels
the decrease in monetary support
is as crucial as the change in
status.
"The only thing that bothers
me is the varsity club status and
the trouble I'll have in Retting the
boys to come here. They tell me
'If it's going to be a club sport, I
want to go where it is a varsity
sport'," said Priddle.
On March 12, soccer officially
became a member of the newly
created category of varsity club
sports, but Fred Priddle, socc»*r
coach, has yet to be officially
notified of this decision and its
consequences for Stanford's
soccer program.
"1 haven't learned yet, for
certain,*' said Priddle in response
io a question concerning when he
was first told of soccer's new and
lower status. "1 haven't been told
officially. I have submitted my
budget for next year and nothing
has been done on that."
But Joe Ruetz, head of the
Department of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation, says
soccer's new status is permanent,
citing the current economic
crunch and the fact that, "Soccer
didn't fit the definition I drew up
for varsity sports" as reasons for
his "reclassification" of soccer.
Two of Ruetz's criteria for
defining a varsity sport are the
existence of a conference
championship and a full-time
coach. Priddle receives a minimal
salary as a "contract coach" and
the soccer team does not compete
in the Pac-8 conference but in
the Northern California
Intercollegiate Soccer Conference.
The funds are not available to
hire a full time coach, says Ruetz,
and the formation of the Pacific
Right soccer league was voted
down in December of 197 1 by the
league's athletic directors.
Ruetz views his decis on as an
acknowledgement of the present
stage of development of soccer at
Stanford as opposed to a
demotion of the sport to varsity
club status.
"By doing this, the possibility
of developing the sport and
re-assigning it varsity status

remains," said Ruetz.
