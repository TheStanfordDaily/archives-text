Saigon Forces Attack At Xuan Loc
SAIGON — Government forces ran into strong
resistance yesterday in attacks on North Vietnamese
positions outside Xuan Loc, the provincial capital
40 miles east of Saigon where fighting has raged for
a week.
Latest reports indicated the battle was a
standoff. Xuan Loc is the first significant place
government troops have shown willingness to fight
since giving up the northern three-fourths of the
country without a fight.
Tension heightened in edgy Saigon after an
attack on Bien Hoa air base 15 miles north that set
off explosions at an ammunition dump early
yesterday.
Meanwhile, the Cambodian government
reportedly clung to Phnom Penh yesterday, but
broadcasts of the Communist-led Khmer Rouge
claimed rebel forces were "penetrating deep" into
the capital city and had occupied the airport.
Cambodian troops in Phnom Penh told newsmen
the insurgents were at the northern outskirts of the
city.
Rebel radio monitored in Thailand said the
Khmer Rouge had taken half of a village less than
two miles west of the center of Phnom Penh.
Connally Defense Rests Its Case
WASHINGTON — The defense rested its case
today in the John Connally bribery trial after the
former treasury secretary repeatedly denied taking
two $5000 payoffs.
Judge George Hart said he would go immediately

into chambers with lawyers for the defense and
prosecution to discuss instructions to be given to
the jury before it retires to begin consideration of a
verdict.
Prosecutor Frank Tuerkheimer said he would call
no rebuttal witnesses, clearing the way to give the
case to the jury.
During cross-examination by Tuerkheimer,
Connally admitted he had made some mistakes in
testimony about the alleged payoffs when he
appeared before a federal grand jury and Senate
Watergate Committee investigators in 1973 and
1974.
$780 Million In Viet Arms Lost
WASHINGTON — A key Pentagon official says
that about $780 million in U.S.-supplied arms,
ammunition and other vital military equipment was
lost or destroyed in the recent retreat of South
Vietnamese troops.
Erich von Marbod, who surveyed the situation
for President Ford, told an interviewer that the total
could go higher when losses in support-type
equipment are finally calculated.
But von Marbod, in charge of monitoring
military aid to South Vietnam and Cambodia,
disputed a $5-billion to $10-billion estimate made
by Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho), last week.
In Washington, Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger acknowledged yesterday that the U.S.
embassy in Saigon has been instructed to reduce the
number of Americans in South Vietnam to an
essential minimum.
Privately, U.S. officials said the figure would be

cut to 1000 or even less. Kissinger told the Senate
Appropriations Committee there are well below
5000 currently in the beleaguered country and no
"supernumeraries" would remain.
Defense Secretary James Schlesinger told the
House Armed Services Committee, meanwhile, that
200,000 South Vietnamese would be killed in a
bloodbath if the country fell. Schlesinger said this
represented "a hard-core list" and that an additional
million might be slain.
Panther Loses Oakland Race
OAKLAND — Incumbent Raymond Eng
squeaked by Black Panther leader Elaine Brown
with a majority of votes in unofficial returns for
Oakland's city council race Tuesday, while in
Berkeley Mayor Warren Widener headed for
re-election.
With all but two precincts reporting, Eng had
51.4 percent of the vote and Brown had 41 percent.
In Oakland's race for five seats on the nine-member
council, more than 50 percent of the vote is needed
to avoid a runoff.
In Berkeley, Widener held a 137-vote lead over
Ying Lee Kelley with 188 of 192 precincts counted.
Only a plurality is needed to be elected there.
