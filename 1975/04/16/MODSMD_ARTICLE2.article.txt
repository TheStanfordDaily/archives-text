# McCloskey Opposes Ford's Aid Request
## 
### 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) announced yesterday
he would vote against President Ford's
request for additional military aid for
South Vietnam. He added that he
would, however, support humanitarian
aid to that nation, contingent on the
resignation of South Vietnam's
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
McCloskey had come under fire
recently for apparently softening his
traditional stand against the war in
Indochina.
In his "State of the World" address
last week. Ford called on Congress to
provide $722 million in military and
$250 million in humanitarian aid for
South Vietnam. McCloskey said he
was ' deeply disappointed" in the
speech.
"In effect," he charged, "the
President is asking Congress to replace
over $1 billion in military equipment
which the South Vietnamese lost in
last month's precipitous withdrawal."
McCloskey said he would support a
"reasonable sum" of humanitarian aid
even should the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong forces defeat Thieu's
regime.
McCloskey also co-sponsored a
resolution calling on the President to
"take immediate steps to evacuate all
American nationals from Vietnam
within seven days, utilizing solely
civilian personnel and transport for
these evacuations."
He added that he would oppose any
use of American troops in such an
evacuation, unless the Administration
could demonstrate that there was no
other feasible method.
