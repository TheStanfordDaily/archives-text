# Students Face Lengthy Ballot And Computer Voting System
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN BILL MacDOUGALL 
Students go to the polls today
and tomorrow facing a lengthy
ballot and a new voting system.
Highlighting the election is the
five-way race for the ASSU Council
of Presidents (COP). Heading the
slates are Charles Jameson, Steven
Weiss. Mike Lopez, Lee Rosenbaum
and Kevin McDermott.
Students will also vote on nine
fee assessments N and three
constitutional amendments.
Members of the class of '76 also
choose between six slates to serve
as senior class officers.
The new voting system uses
machine-readable computer cards as
ballots. Each polling place will have
a few printed sheets, called master
ballots, which will list the slates,
assessments and amendments.
Those wishing to vote for a
certain slate or on an assessment or
amendment would find their choice
on the master ballot and note the
number that corresponds to that
selection. They would then pencil
in the space above that number on
their computer card.
Polling Places
The polling places at the Quad's
history corner, the Graduate School
of Business, the physics tank and
the Medical School will be open
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. both days.
The post office and the engineering
corner polling places will be open

from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
All slates for the COP claim to
be serious contenders.
The pre-med/engineering slate of
Jameson, Paul Collopy, Walt Pyka
and Dave Cooper hopes that
"sincerity, honesty and willingness
to work for the students" will bring
it to victory, according to Jameson.
The Hammer and Coffin Society
slate, associated with the Stanford
Chaparral, has combined serious
and humorous proposals in its
campaign. Members of this slate are
Weiss, Shelly Williams, Tom Devine
and Walt Kloefkorn.
'Good Times'
Promising '"good times" is the
slate composed of Lopez, Gary-
Cohen and Preston Dufauchard.
Their proposals include a Harrad
Experiment-type theme house with
coed rooms and an increased
number of special events.
Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo,
Dave Galligan and Charlotte
Germane stress student
involvement, improved
ASSU/student communication and
experience in their COP campaign.
Their platform includes
proposals for peer advising, a
women's building, a SWOPSI course
to examine University financing
and tuition, and a community
buying guide.
incremental Change'
McDermott, Bonny Rodden.
Andy Leuchter and Mark Simonian

are stressing "incremental changes"
as opposed to major new proposals
in their campaign.
The slate's promises include
regular surveys of student opinion,
publication of University
committee agendas, an off-campus
shuttle bus service, a night eatery, a
guide to off-campus living and a
Residential Visitors/Speakers
Program.
The $16 worth of fee
assessments is distributed as
follows:
— $2 for the Stanford Band for
fall and winter quarters;
— $1 for the Action Research
Liaison Office;
— $1 for the ASSU Speakers
Bureau;
— $1 for the ASSU Program Fee
which is to be distributed among
many campus organizations;
— $3 for KZSU for fall, winter
and spring quarters;
— $2 for the Legal Counseling
Office for fall and summer quarters;
— $1 for Northern California
Public Interest Research Group;
— $3 for the Stanford Daily for
fall, winter and summer quarters;
— $2 for the ASSU Publications
Board for fall and winter quarters.
A $1 assessment to fund a
parking lawsuit against the
University will appear on the ballot
but will not be counted, as the suit
has been dropped by the ASSU
Senate.
The three constitutional
amendments would change all
"sexist" wording in the
Constitution, would allow the
ASSU to hire a fulltime financial
manager and would allow a fee
assessment to be passed if 10
percent of the student body votes
in its favor and the number of yes
votes exceeds the number of no
votes.
Currently, the constitution
requires that at least 20 percent of
the student body vote in an
election for an assessment with
majority approval to pass.
The heads of the six senior class
slates are Lyse Strnad, Gina
Anastasi, Dan Poston, Leo Salazar,
"Weird Walt" Spevak and Frank
Ramirez.
The new voting method is

demonstrated in an advertisement
on page 3 of today's Daily.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald claims the new system
will make ballot stuffing more
difficult because the cards will be
coded before being distributed to
the polls.
He said the results will be
obtained much quicker and will be
more accurate because the system
takes the human element out of the
counting and because the machine
will be able to quickly total the
results several times.
He noted that the system will
save the ASSU money because the
cards are cheaper than printed
ballots and because the ASSU will
not pay for 100 hours of labor to
count ballots. Because the counting
machine is already on campus, the
only initial expense is the computer
programming time.

corner polling places will be open

from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
All slates for the COP claim to
be serious contenders.
The pre-med/engineering slate of
Jameson, Paul Collopy, Walt Pyka
and Dave Cooper hopes that
"sincerity, honesty and willingness
to work for the students" will bring
it to victory, according to Jameson.
The Hammer and Coffin Society
slate, associated with the Stanford
Chaparral, has combined serious
and humorous proposals in its
campaign. Members of this slate are
Weiss, Shelly Williams, Tom Devine
and Walt Kloefkorn.
'Good Times'
Promising '"good times" is the
slate composed of Lopez, Gary-
Cohen and Preston Dufauchard.
Their proposals include a Harrad
Experiment-type theme house with
coed rooms and an increased
number of special events.
Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo,
Dave Galligan and Charlotte
Germane stress student
involvement, improved
ASSU/student communication and
experience in their COP campaign.
Their platform includes
proposals for peer advising, a
women's building, a SWOPSI course
to examine University financing
and tuition, and a community
buying guide.
incremental Change'
McDermott, Bonny Rodden.
Andy Leuchter and Mark Simonian

are stressing "incremental changes"
as opposed to major new proposals
in their campaign.
The slate's promises include
regular surveys of student opinion,
publication of University
committee agendas, an off-campus
shuttle bus service, a night eatery, a
guide to off-campus living and a
Residential Visitors/Speakers
Program.
The $16 worth of fee
assessments is distributed as
follows:
— $2 for the Stanford Band for
fall and winter quarters;
— $1 for the Action Research
Liaison Office;
— $1 for the ASSU Speakers
Bureau;
— $1 for the ASSU Program Fee
which is to be distributed among
many campus organizations;
— $3 for KZSU for fall, winter
and spring quarters;
— $2 for the Legal Counseling
Office for fall and summer quarters;
— $1 for Northern California
Public Interest Research Group;
— $3 for the Stanford Daily for
fall, winter and summer quarters;
— $2 for the ASSU Publications
Board for fall and winter quarters.
A $1 assessment to fund a
parking lawsuit against the
University will appear on the ballot
but will not be counted, as the suit
has been dropped by the ASSU
Senate.
The three constitutional
amendments would change all
"sexist" wording in the
Constitution, would allow the
ASSU to hire a fulltime financial
manager and would allow a fee
assessment to be passed if 10
percent of the student body votes
in its favor and the number of yes
votes exceeds the number of no
votes.
Currently, the constitution
requires that at least 20 percent of
the student body vote in an
election for an assessment with
majority approval to pass.
The heads of the six senior class
slates are Lyse Strnad, Gina
Anastasi, Dan Poston, Leo Salazar,
"Weird Walt" Spevak and Frank
Ramirez.
The new voting method is

demonstrated in an advertisement
on page 3 of today's Daily.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald claims the new system
will make ballot stuffing more
difficult because the cards will be
coded before being distributed to
the polls.
He said the results will be
obtained much quicker and will be
more accurate because the system
takes the human element out of the
counting and because the machine
will be able to quickly total the
results several times.
He noted that the system will
save the ASSU money because the
cards are cheaper than printed
ballots and because the ASSU will
not pay for 100 hours of labor to
count ballots. Because the counting
machine is already on campus, the
only initial expense is the computer
programming time.
Students go to the polls today
and tomorrow facing a lengthy
ballot and a new voting system.
Highlighting the election is the
five-way race for the ASSU Council
of Presidents (COP). Heading the
slates are Charles Jameson, Steven
Weiss. Mike Lopez, Lee Rosenbaum
and Kevin McDermott.
Students will also vote on nine
fee assessments N and three
constitutional amendments.
Members of the class of '76 also
choose between six slates to serve
as senior class officers.
The new voting system uses
machine-readable computer cards as
ballots. Each polling place will have
a few printed sheets, called master
ballots, which will list the slates,
assessments and amendments.
Those wishing to vote for a
certain slate or on an assessment or
amendment would find their choice
on the master ballot and note the
number that corresponds to that
selection. They would then pencil
in the space above that number on
their computer card.
Polling Places
The polling places at the Quad's
history corner, the Graduate School
of Business, the physics tank and
the Medical School will be open

incremental Change'
McDermott, Bonny Rodden.
Andy Leuchter and Mark Simonian

are stressing "incremental changes"
as opposed to major new proposals
in their campaign.
The slate's promises include
regular surveys of student opinion,
publication of University
committee agendas, an off-campus
shuttle bus service, a night eatery, a
guide to off-campus living and a
Residential Visitors/Speakers
Program.
The $16 worth of fee
assessments is distributed as
follows:
— $2 for the Stanford Band for
fall and winter quarters;
— $1 for the Action Research
Liaison Office;
— $1 for the ASSU Speakers
Bureau;
— $1 for the ASSU Program Fee
which is to be distributed among
many campus organizations;
— $3 for KZSU for fall, winter
and spring quarters;
— $2 for the Legal Counseling
Office for fall and summer quarters;
— $1 for Northern California
Public Interest Research Group;
— $3 for the Stanford Daily for
fall, winter and summer quarters;
— $2 for the ASSU Publications
Board for fall and winter quarters.
A $1 assessment to fund a
parking lawsuit against the
University will appear on the ballot
but will not be counted, as the suit
has been dropped by the ASSU
Senate.
The three constitutional
amendments would change all
"sexist" wording in the
Constitution, would allow the
ASSU to hire a fulltime financial
manager and would allow a fee
assessment to be passed if 10
percent of the student body votes
in its favor and the number of yes
votes exceeds the number of no
votes.
Currently, the constitution
requires that at least 20 percent of
the student body vote in an
election for an assessment with
majority approval to pass.
The heads of the six senior class
slates are Lyse Strnad, Gina
Anastasi, Dan Poston, Leo Salazar,
"Weird Walt" Spevak and Frank
Ramirez.
The new voting method is

demonstrated in an advertisement
on page 3 of today's Daily.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald claims the new system
will make ballot stuffing more
difficult because the cards will be
coded before being distributed to
the polls.
He said the results will be
obtained much quicker and will be
more accurate because the system
takes the human element out of the
counting and because the machine
will be able to quickly total the
results several times.
He noted that the system will
save the ASSU money because the
cards are cheaper than printed
ballots and because the ASSU will
not pay for 100 hours of labor to
count ballots. Because the counting
machine is already on campus, the
only initial expense is the computer
programming time.
Students go to the polls today
and tomorrow facing a lengthy
ballot and a new voting system.
Highlighting the election is the
five-way race for the ASSU Council
of Presidents (COP). Heading the
slates are Charles Jameson, Steven
Weiss. Mike Lopez, Lee Rosenbaum
and Kevin McDermott.
Students will also vote on nine
fee assessments N and three
constitutional amendments.
Members of the class of '76 also
choose between six slates to serve
as senior class officers.
The new voting system uses
machine-readable computer cards as
ballots. Each polling place will have
a few printed sheets, called master
ballots, which will list the slates,
assessments and amendments.
Those wishing to vote for a
certain slate or on an assessment or
amendment would find their choice
on the master ballot and note the
number that corresponds to that
selection. They would then pencil
in the space above that number on
their computer card.
Polling Places
The polling places at the Quad's
history corner, the Graduate School
of Business, the physics tank and
the Medical School will be open
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. both days.
The post office and the engineering
corner polling places will be open

from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
All slates for the COP claim to
be serious contenders.
The pre-med/engineering slate of
Jameson, Paul Collopy, Walt Pyka
and Dave Cooper hopes that
"sincerity, honesty and willingness
to work for the students" will bring
it to victory, according to Jameson.
The Hammer and Coffin Society
slate, associated with the Stanford
Chaparral, has combined serious
and humorous proposals in its
campaign. Members of this slate are
Weiss, Shelly Williams, Tom Devine
and Walt Kloefkorn.
'Good Times'
Promising '"good times" is the
slate composed of Lopez, Gary-
Cohen and Preston Dufauchard.
Their proposals include a Harrad
Experiment-type theme house with
coed rooms and an increased
number of special events.
Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo,
Dave Galligan and Charlotte
Germane stress student
involvement, improved
ASSU/student communication and
experience in their COP campaign.
Their platform includes
proposals for peer advising, a
women's building, a SWOPSI course
to examine University financing
and tuition, and a community
buying guide.
