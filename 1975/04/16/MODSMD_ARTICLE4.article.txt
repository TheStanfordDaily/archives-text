## Franklin Accepts Rutgers' Offer 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Former Stanford English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin has received a
| three-year appointment to Rutgirs
| University's Newark campus.
Franklin, fired from Stanford in
1972 for allegedly inciting students to
I violence, will serve as a full but
untenured professor. He is currently a
| visiting professor at Yale and
i- Wesley an.
Contacted yesterday by the Daily.
| Franklin said he is looking forward to
I teaching at the urban, 3500-student
| campus.
i| "The area has tremendous
I problems," Franklin said. "I think that
112 I have an understanding of the
I problems of the working people
: there." , . „
Working Classes
Franklin said that most students at
Rutgers, a government institution, live
in the area and come from working
class homes. Franklin said he will
attempt to relate his courses to their
lives.
"Any good literature course is
relevant to the experience of the
people in the class," Franklin
commented.
There was no objection to
Franklin's appointment by the Rutgers
Board of Trustees, according to Jofie
Steinbock, director of information at

Rutgers. i
Last year, when the University of
Colorado English Department voted
unanimously to hire Franklin, the
Board of Trustees there voted 8-1 to
deny Franklin a job. Franklin is
currently suing the Board over its
decision.
Franklin, a noted Melville scholar,
plans eventually to teach a course on
Melville at Rutgers.
Franklin early this month was given
a fellowship by the Rockefeller
Foundation to write a book, The
Victim As Criminal and Artist, about
prisoners in American literature.
He said he will teach a course at
Rutjers on the same subject as his
planned book. The course will
examine literature written by
prisoners, from early 19th century
slaves to Merle Haggard and Malcolm
X.
Franklin also revealed yesterday
that he will appear next month on the
Stanford campus during a Max 10-12
tour of the West Coast to promote his
latest book, Back -Where You Came
From.
The book, a political
autobiography, will include a chapter
outlining the history of the University.
It will be published two weeks from
now by Harper's Magazine Press.
