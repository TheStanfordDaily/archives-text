Rosters for six task forces studying
Stanford's three-year, $10 million
belt-tightening plan will be finalized
"within a week or two," according to
Leon Seltzer, head of the University
Budget Priorities Advisory
Commission to which the groups will
report.
The names of the task forces'
chairmen were released last week,
along with the charges and goals of
each individual task force.
Chairmen and task force areas are:
— Electrical Engineering Prof. John

Linvill, "The Size and Function of the
University Administration and
Support Services";
— Geology Prof. Benjamin Page,
"Student Support Services and
Activities";
— Assoc. Communication Prof.
Henry Breitrose, "Academic Calendar
and Utilization of the Academic
Plant";
— Geology Prof. Konrad
Krauskopf, "Professorial Rank and
Faculty Development";
— Assoc. Economics Prof. David
Starret, "Examining and Monitoring

the Economics of the Transition from
Fiscal Crisis to Budgetary
Equilibrium";
— Aeronautics and Astronautics
Prof. Dftniel Bershader, "Professional
Schools and the Operating Budget."
Each task force will include one
member of the Faculty Senate, one
member of the Advisory Commission,
some additional faculty nominated by
the Committee on Committees, and
from one to three students nominated
by the ASSU.
Charges for each task force stressed
that "no task force is asked to bear the
burden of final advice to the
President." Instead, said the charges,
the role of the task forces will be
advisory; they will "aid | the
Commission | in identifying the bases
for asking questions and forming
judgments about answers."
Seltzer characterized the forces as
having "an enormously wide scope,"
but added that their emphasis is only
on "six areas out of many that the
Commission recognized as needing
more work."
Emphasizing the time component
involved in changing aspects of the
University, Seltzer pointed out that
some results "could not possibly be
implemented in three years," referring
to the period of the three-year
budgetary study. "Academic changes
take years," he said, "in order to do
right by the students."
"The wisest solution will come," he
said, "when as many of the
constituencies as possible realize and
commonly grasp three principal
components: the facts, the analysis of
the rationale and normative values."
