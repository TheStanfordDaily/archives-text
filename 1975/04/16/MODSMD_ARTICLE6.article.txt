# Council Members: Mackey And Carter Oppose PIRG And KZSU Assessments
## 
### 
Two members of the current ASSU
Council of Presidents have announced
their opposition to two fee
assessments on today's student ballot
and pointedly failed to endorse two
others.
Vice Presidents Ann Carter and Len

Mackey urged voters to reject
assessments for the Northern
California Public Interest Research
Group (NorCal PIRC.) and radio
station KZSU, and abstained from
backing proposals of the Stanford
Band and the Daily.
The duo endorsed assessments
sought by the Action Research Liaison
Office and the ASSU's Legal
Counseling Office (LCO), Speakers'
Bureau and Publications Board.
The vice presidents said any group
whose assessment loses this week
'Should be able to find out why it was
voted down. That group will have
good reason to come back in the fall
without the fat in their [sic | request."
Such a recourse was urged for
NorCal PIRG supporters, "if they do
something relevant, in the next four

months" to merit their proposed $1
fee.
KZSU's "budget is entitled 'quick
and accurate,' [but| we believe that
it's too quick and too fat," Carter said.
"They are getting security at the
student's expense and their figures are
just too round" to justify a $2
assessment.
The COP members objected to the
Band's planned use of part of its $2
assessment to open a $6000 savings
account. "We object to giving them
more money than they need," Carter
said.
Dismissing claims by the Daily's
Board of Directors that the paper will
fold if its $3 assessment is defeated,
the pair urged the newspaper to have
Business School consultants look at its
management and financial efficiency.

THE FOUR MUSKETEERS — Although these students bear little resemblance to Michael York or Raquel Welch, even
those two notables might have been in the crowd for this weekend's Aquafollies. After all, nearly everyone else was —
some for the fun. and some just for the sun. And some for the beer, of course.
