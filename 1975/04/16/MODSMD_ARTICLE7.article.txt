# Population Growth Must Stop
## 
### 
The most dramatic aspect of the
world population problem is the
relationship between world population
growth and available food resources.
In recent years rapid rates of
population growth in developing
countries and continued though
declining population growth in the
more developed nations have led to a
serious concern about the capacity of
the natural environment and its
resources to sustain adequate increases
in food production, land, science, and
technology seem to be pitted against
the sheer increase of people.
Those who predict that population
growth will increase faster than food
supplies foresee a world of famine and
death by starvation. On the other
hand, some foresee new technology
and modern agricultural methods
easily feeding the world population of
the next several generations.
But the immediate future of the
world is neither the misery and
tragedy of widespread famines nor the
abundance of the weddings of Cana.
Between the era of famine and disaster
and the age of abundance and

happiness lies, of course, a whole range
of other finely distinguished
possibilities.
The classic race between population
growth and increased food production
has two sides. First, there is an
increased demand for food stemming
from either a larger population or a
greater per capita demand for food.
Second, increased food production can
be derived by bringing more arable
land under cultivation or by increasing
yields on present agricultural land.
World Population Growth
The rate at which world population
is now growing is unique and without
historical precedent. Present rates of
world population growth have never
existed before in human history and
cannot continue for very long in the
future.
Zero population growth is not
simply a desirable goal; it is the only
possibility in a finite world. Since the
human population has no alternative
to zero growth in the long run. there
can be little argument about what will
inevitably come.
Discussion now centers on the
means of reducing present rates of
population growth and the timing of
decreased growth.
Two Percent Growth
World population is now growing at
slightly over two percent a year. This
implies a doubling of the world's
population in under 35 years.
With a present world population of
about four billion, this arithmetic
suggests about six and one-half billion
people in the world by the year 2000.
Although historically
unprecedented growth rates are only
one aspect of the current population
situation, I submit that one important
solution to the world population
problem entails the dramatic reduction
of the birth rate in the next two or
three generations.
Population growth is produced by

the excess of births over deaths. Rapid
population growth j s the resu | t of
dramatic successes in reducing
mortality while fertility levels
remained moderately high.
There should be widespread ethical
agreement, I think, that lower
mortality is desirable and that, indeed,
there is a basic human right to
adequate food supplies and medical
care.

In this sens*' the so-called
"population explosion" is a rather
imprecise term for the laudable
progress that has been made in
reducing mortality and extending the
length of life.
Fertility Crucial
I'ertility is the crucial, uncertain,
and dynamic laetor in determining
future rates of population growth.
For several years now, the
developed nations of the world have
achieved fertility levels that are
consistent with long-term zero
population growth.
Population growth in the
developing countries of the world is
still rapid, disturbing, and of
important concern for their own
national purposes of feeding their
populations.
The real question is whether
fertility will fall fast enough among
developing countries in the next
decades to ease pressure on the food
supply and provide adequate nutrition
for the millions now hungry and
malnourished.
