# Food Price Increase Unlikely To Recur
## 
### 
(Editor 's note: This was taken from an
article that ran in the fall/winter, 1974
issue of "The Stanford Magazine ")
What has happened in the early
1970s to trigger massive food price
increases and consequent talk of world
famine and consequent talk of world
famine and starvation in a decade?
Is the world at one of the great
discontinuities of human history, so
that the past no longer speaks to the
future? Or did events happen in a
combination unlikely to occur again so
that we are experiencing a temporary
deviation from the path to improved
living standards for man king?
Our personal position is closer to
the latter more optimistic view,
although we expect the food situation
over the next five to 10 years to allow
little cushion for bad weather or bad
policy.
Such a view requires an explanation
of the present food situation in terms
of an unlikely and probably
nonrecurring combination of events.
In retrospect, eight factors
impinged simultaneously in 1972 on
world food supplies to set off the price
explosion. The recent price
discontinuity would not have occurred
in the absence of very many of these
factors The\ fall into three major
categories: trend factors,
deviations from-trend factors', and
politual fa< tors
Trend Factors
1. The relentless growth in the
world's population stands as the basic
mechanism behind all gloomy
predictions of famine ahead. Fach year
sees a population equivalent to
Bangladesh — 80 million people —
added to the demands on the resources
of our planet.
The growth is greatest in those
countries already hungry and where
the prospects for slowing the growth
are bleakest.
However, because of its steady,
relentless nature, it is not the cause of
a sudden and unprecedented jump in
food prices. Population growth by
itself can cause trends, but not
discontinuities.
World Affluence
2. The steady though
not-so-relentless growth in world
affluence in many ways mirrors
population growth. In the richer,
better-fed countries with slow
population growth, increased affluence
has permitted a major transformation
in dietary patterns with enormous
consequences on the demand for grain.
At low incomes consumers eat
more grain directly as their incomes
rise - reaching 100 lbs. per capita at
an income level of $500 to $700 per
year.
Beyond this, direct grain
consumption declines to a relatively
stable 150 lbs. per capita as incomes
rise further and consumers can afford
to indulge what seems to be a nearly
universal taste for meat.

Individuals in wealthy countries
such as the United States are now
consuming nearly a ton of grain per
year, five times the amount necessary
for adequate nutrition if eaten in the
form of cereal.
The driving mechanism for this
incredible statistic is the inefficiency
of animal metabolism. A pound of
choice beef requires seven pounds of
grain, a pound of chicken about half
that.
It turns out then that the wealthy
countries have generated heavy
pressures on food resources via their

income growth — even though their
populations are increasing at a
relatively slow rate.
Deviations-from-Trend Factors
3. Although income growth in the
world has been relatively steady over
the past two decades, there have been
ups and downs.
The first three years of 1970s
showed strong economic growth in
many countries, and 1972 saw an
historic simultaneous peaking of
economic booms in Japan, Western
Europe, and North America.
Real growth rates were about
two-thirds higher than the historic rate
of five percent per year.
This added affluence fueled heavy
demand for meat and hence a
multiplied demand for the grains and
soybeans to produce the meat.
Dollar Devaluation
4. The' United States dollar was
devalued twice between August 1971
and the end of 1972.
Our products became cheaper for
foreigners to buy, and countries with
strong currencies such as West
Germany and Japan, both enormous
markets for American feedgrains.
found themselves largely cushioned
from the rise in the dollar prices of our
agricultural exports.
In the absence of devaluation,
demand pressures would have been less
strong.
Anchovies
5. The Humboldt current off the
coast of Peru suddenly shifted course
in 1972, causing the anchovies to
disappear.
These sardine-like fish are the basis
of the world's largest fish catch,
around 10 million tons per year in the
late 1900s.
The virtual disappearance of
fishmeal and oil from world trade in
1972 and 1973 placed an immense

burden on the supply of soybeans, the
major high-protein competitor of
fishmeal in animal feed rations.
Weather
6. The most important deviation
from trend occurred with the weather
in 1972.
The U.S.S.R. suffered one of the
worst droughts in its history; the
monsoon in South and Southeast Asia
was erratic, causing either too much
rain or too little; Australia and Africa
had droughts, and North America had
a cold, wet planting season.
As a result, world wheat production

decreased from the previous year by
about eight million tons, course grain
production about 16 million tons, and
rice production 11 million tons.
A significant decline in all three
grain categories in the same year was
unprecedented in the past 15 years.
The total drop was about 37
million tons of grain, but since normal
trends (and demands) called for an
increase of some 33 million tons, the
net effect was a reduction below trend
of about 70 million tons of grain.
Here, clearly, was the fuse.
Political Factors
7. A shift in United States
agricultural policy in the late 1960s
from production payments under price
support programs to direct
farm income supplements largely
eliminated surplus grain purchases.
The move toward free market
prices, coupled with crop acreage
diversions, removed the rural political
pressures, underlying the accumulation
of surplus grain stocks.
With these pressures gone, the
administration became almost
obsessed with eliminating the stocks
and with avoiding their
reaccumulation. Understanding this
frame of mind is essential to
understanding what happened in 1972
and 1973.
Food Reserve
8. In 1972 the world held reserve
food stocks of 132 million tons of
grain and there was the equivalent of
46 million tons in idled American
cropland.
Prices certainly had to rise in the
face of substantial production
shortfall. But stocks, although
historically small relative to
consumption needs, were sufficient to
carry the world through this bad year
with some belt-tightening and a careful
and equitable allocation mechanism.
The United States, as the largest
holder of both surplus grain and
cropland, had the opportunity (some
would say the obligation) to see that
the supplies were not preempted by a
single buyer and that the potential
grain in idled cropland be turned into
reality as quickly as possible.
Proper and timely action here could
have been a major stabilizing influence
on the world grain market primed to
explode.
Russian Wheat Deal
Instead, the United States'and the
U.S.S.R.'s actions destabilized the
situation.
The notorious Russian wheat deal is
only half the story, but an important
half.
The Soviets had been large buyers
in world grain markets before, but
only to supplement low supplies for
direct human consumption.
In 1972 the U.S.S.R. bought
massively and secretly in world
markets, a new approach for the
Soviets, to protect its livestock
industry.
Before the world grain exporters,
including the United States who sold
most of it, knew what was happening,
the Russians had bought over 20
million tons of grain.

Walter P. Falcon end C. Peter Timmer

The rest of the world, especially the
poor countries, was profoundly
disturbed to find that the most visible
and accessible part of the world's food
stocks suddenly were not for sale.
The United States treated the deal
initially as a great commercial coup,
simultaneously ridding us of
burdensome surplus stocks and
generating foreign exchange.
Indeed, so preoccupied were
American officials with the burden of
carrying stocks that harvested grain
acreage in 1972 was below any level in
the previous two decades
Even in 1973 nearly 20 million
acres were withheld for fear of getting
the government back in the business of
holding stocks.
And yet, as early as 1971 world
reserve grain stocks had fallen to their
lowest level since the monsoon failures
in India in 1966 and 1967.
Total reserves (counting the
production potential of idled
cropland) were below the 1967 figure,
and reserve as a percent of annual
grain consumption had fallen to half
Ihe average levels of the 1960s
Thus, the second half of the story
was the United States' persistence in
holding stocks down and idling
cropland. Together with the Russian
sale, this struck the match and lit the
fuse. The result was an explosion of
food prices.

Deviations-from-Trend Factors
3. Although income growth in the
world has been relatively steady over
the past two decades, there have been
ups and downs.
The first three years of 1970s
showed strong economic growth in
many countries, and 1972 saw an
historic simultaneous peaking of
economic booms in Japan, Western
Europe, and North America.
Real growth rates were about
two-thirds higher than the historic rate
of five percent per year.
This added affluence fueled heavy
demand for meat and hence a
multiplied demand for the grains and
soybeans to produce the meat.
Dollar Devaluation
4. The' United States dollar was
devalued twice between August 1971
and the end of 1972.
Our products became cheaper for
foreigners to buy, and countries with
strong currencies such as West
Germany and Japan, both enormous
markets for American feedgrains.
found themselves largely cushioned
from the rise in the dollar prices of our
agricultural exports.
In the absence of devaluation,
demand pressures would have been less
strong.
Anchovies
5. The Humboldt current off the
coast of Peru suddenly shifted course
in 1972, causing the anchovies to
disappear.
These sardine-like fish are the basis
of the world's largest fish catch,
around 10 million tons per year in the
late 1900s.
The virtual disappearance of
fishmeal and oil from world trade in
1972 and 1973 placed an immense

burden on the supply of soybeans, the
major high-protein competitor of
fishmeal in animal feed rations.
Weather
6. The most important deviation
from trend occurred with the weather
in 1972.
The U.S.S.R. suffered one of the
worst droughts in its history; the
monsoon in South and Southeast Asia
was erratic, causing either too much
rain or too little; Australia and Africa
had droughts, and North America had
a cold, wet planting season.
As a result, world wheat production

decreased from the previous year by
about eight million tons, course grain
production about 16 million tons, and
rice production 11 million tons.
A significant decline in all three
grain categories in the same year was
unprecedented in the past 15 years.
The total drop was about 37
million tons of grain, but since normal
trends (and demands) called for an
increase of some 33 million tons, the
net effect was a reduction below trend
of about 70 million tons of grain.
Here, clearly, was the fuse.
Political Factors
7. A shift in United States
agricultural policy in the late 1960s
from production payments under price
support programs to direct
farm income supplements largely
eliminated surplus grain purchases.
The move toward free market
prices, coupled with crop acreage
diversions, removed the rural political
pressures, underlying the accumulation
of surplus grain stocks.
With these pressures gone, the
administration became almost
obsessed with eliminating the stocks
and with avoiding their
reaccumulation. Understanding this
frame of mind is essential to
understanding what happened in 1972
and 1973.
Food Reserve
8. In 1972 the world held reserve
food stocks of 132 million tons of
grain and there was the equivalent of
46 million tons in idled American
cropland.
Prices certainly had to rise in the
face of substantial production
shortfall. But stocks, although
historically small relative to
consumption needs, were sufficient to
carry the world through this bad year
with some belt-tightening and a careful
and equitable allocation mechanism.
The United States, as the largest
holder of both surplus grain and
cropland, had the opportunity (some
would say the obligation) to see that
the supplies were not preempted by a
single buyer and that the potential
grain in idled cropland be turned into
reality as quickly as possible.
Proper and timely action here could
have been a major stabilizing influence
on the world grain market primed to
explode.
Russian Wheat Deal
Instead, the United States'and the
U.S.S.R.'s actions destabilized the
situation.
The notorious Russian wheat deal is
only half the story, but an important
half.
The Soviets had been large buyers
in world grain markets before, but
only to supplement low supplies for
direct human consumption.
In 1972 the U.S.S.R. bought
massively and secretly in world
markets, a new approach for the
Soviets, to protect its livestock
industry.
Before the world grain exporters,
including the United States who sold
most of it, knew what was happening,
the Russians had bought over 20
million tons of grain.

Walter P. Falcon end C. Peter Timmer

The rest of the world, especially the
poor countries, was profoundly
disturbed to find that the most visible
and accessible part of the world's food
stocks suddenly were not for sale.
The United States treated the deal
initially as a great commercial coup,
simultaneously ridding us of
burdensome surplus stocks and
generating foreign exchange.
Indeed, so preoccupied were
American officials with the burden of
carrying stocks that harvested grain
acreage in 1972 was below any level in
the previous two decades
Even in 1973 nearly 20 million
acres were withheld for fear of getting
the government back in the business of
holding stocks.
And yet, as early as 1971 world
reserve grain stocks had fallen to their
lowest level since the monsoon failures
in India in 1966 and 1967.
Total reserves (counting the
production potential of idled
cropland) were below the 1967 figure,
and reserve as a percent of annual
grain consumption had fallen to half
Ihe average levels of the 1960s
Thus, the second half of the story
was the United States' persistence in
holding stocks down and idling
cropland. Together with the Russian
sale, this struck the match and lit the
fuse. The result was an explosion of
food prices.

issue of "The Stanford Magazine ")
What has happened in the early
1970s to trigger massive food price
increases and consequent talk of world
famine and consequent talk of world
famine and starvation in a decade?
Is the world at one of the great
discontinuities of human history, so
that the past no longer speaks to the
future? Or did events happen in a
combination unlikely to occur again so
that we are experiencing a temporary
deviation from the path to improved
living standards for man king?
Our personal position is closer to
the latter more optimistic view,
although we expect the food situation
over the next five to 10 years to allow
little cushion for bad weather or bad
policy.
Such a view requires an explanation
of the present food situation in terms
of an unlikely and probably
nonrecurring combination of events.
In retrospect, eight factors
impinged simultaneously in 1972 on
world food supplies to set off the price
explosion. The recent price
discontinuity would not have occurred
in the absence of very many of these
factors The\ fall into three major
categories: trend factors,
deviations from-trend factors', and
politual fa< tors
Trend Factors
1. The relentless growth in the
world's population stands as the basic
mechanism behind all gloomy
predictions of famine ahead. Fach year
sees a population equivalent to
Bangladesh — 80 million people —
added to the demands on the resources
of our planet.
The growth is greatest in those
countries already hungry and where
the prospects for slowing the growth
are bleakest.
However, because of its steady,
relentless nature, it is not the cause of
a sudden and unprecedented jump in
food prices. Population growth by
itself can cause trends, but not
discontinuities.
World Affluence
2. The steady though
not-so-relentless growth in world
affluence in many ways mirrors
population growth. In the richer,
better-fed countries with slow
population growth, increased affluence
has permitted a major transformation
in dietary patterns with enormous
consequences on the demand for grain.
At low incomes consumers eat
more grain directly as their incomes
rise - reaching 100 lbs. per capita at
an income level of $500 to $700 per
year.
Beyond this, direct grain
consumption declines to a relatively
stable 150 lbs. per capita as incomes
rise further and consumers can afford
to indulge what seems to be a nearly
universal taste for meat.

Individuals in wealthy countries
such as the United States are now
consuming nearly a ton of grain per
year, five times the amount necessary
for adequate nutrition if eaten in the
form of cereal.
The driving mechanism for this
incredible statistic is the inefficiency
of animal metabolism. A pound of
choice beef requires seven pounds of
grain, a pound of chicken about half
that.
It turns out then that the wealthy
countries have generated heavy
pressures on food resources via their

income growth — even though their
populations are increasing at a
relatively slow rate.
Deviations-from-Trend Factors

world has been relatively steady over
the past two decades, there have been

had droughts, and North America had
a cold, wet planting season.

rice production 11 million tons.
A significant decline in all three
grain categories in the same year was
unprecedented in the past 15 years.
The total drop was about 37
million tons of grain, but since normal
trends (and demands) called for an
increase of some 33 million tons, the
net effect was a reduction below trend
of about 70 million tons of grain.

understanding what happened in 1972
and 1973.
Food Reserve
8. In 1972 the world held reserve
food stocks of 132 million tons of
grain and there was the equivalent of
46 million tons in idled American
cropland.
Prices certainly had to rise in the
face of substantial production
shortfall. But stocks, although
historically small relative to
consumption needs, were sufficient to
carry the world through this bad year
with some belt-tightening and a careful
and equitable allocation mechanism.
The United States, as the largest
holder of both surplus grain and
cropland, had the opportunity (some
would say the obligation) to see that
the supplies were not preempted by a
single buyer and that the potential
grain in idled cropland be turned into
reality as quickly as possible.
Proper and timely action here could
have been a major stabilizing influence
on the world grain market primed to
explode.
Russian Wheat Deal
Instead, the United States'and the
U.S.S.R.'s actions destabilized the
situation.
The notorious Russian wheat deal is
only half the story, but an important
half.
The Soviets had been large buyers
in world grain markets before, but
only to supplement low supplies for
direct human consumption.
In 1972 the U.S.S.R. bought
massively and secretly in world
markets, a new approach for the
Soviets, to protect its livestock
industry.
Before the world grain exporters,
including the United States who sold
most of it, knew what was happening,
the Russians had bought over 20
million tons of grain.

Walter P. Falcon end C. Peter Timmer

The rest of the world, especially the
poor countries, was profoundly
disturbed to find that the most visible
and accessible part of the world's food
stocks suddenly were not for sale.
The United States treated the deal
initially as a great commercial coup,
simultaneously ridding us of
burdensome surplus stocks and
generating foreign exchange.
Indeed, so preoccupied were
American officials with the burden of
carrying stocks that harvested grain
acreage in 1972 was below any level in
the previous two decades
Even in 1973 nearly 20 million
acres were withheld for fear of getting
the government back in the business of
holding stocks.
And yet, as early as 1971 world
reserve grain stocks had fallen to their
lowest level since the monsoon failures
in India in 1966 and 1967.
Total reserves (counting the
production potential of idled
cropland) were below the 1967 figure,
and reserve as a percent of annual
grain consumption had fallen to half
Ihe average levels of the 1960s
Thus, the second half of the story
was the United States' persistence in
holding stocks down and idling
cropland. Together with the Russian
sale, this struck the match and lit the
fuse. The result was an explosion of
food prices.

article that ran in the fall/winter, 1974
issue of "The Stanford Magazine ")
What has happened in the early
1970s to trigger massive food price
increases and consequent talk of world
famine and consequent talk of world
famine and starvation in a decade?
Is the world at one of the great
discontinuities of human history, so
that the past no longer speaks to the
future? Or did events happen in a
combination unlikely to occur again so
that we are experiencing a temporary
deviation from the path to improved
living standards for man king?
Our personal position is closer to
the latter more optimistic view,
although we expect the food situation
over the next five to 10 years to allow
little cushion for bad weather or bad
policy.
Such a view requires an explanation
of the present food situation in terms
of an unlikely and probably
nonrecurring combination of events.
In retrospect, eight factors
impinged simultaneously in 1972 on
world food supplies to set off the price
explosion. The recent price
discontinuity would not have occurred
in the absence of very many of these
factors The\ fall into three major
categories: trend factors,
deviations from-trend factors', and
politual fa< tors
Trend Factors
1. The relentless growth in the
world's population stands as the basic
mechanism behind all gloomy
predictions of famine ahead. Fach year
sees a population equivalent to
Bangladesh — 80 million people —
added to the demands on the resources
of our planet.
The growth is greatest in those
countries already hungry and where
the prospects for slowing the growth
are bleakest.
However, because of its steady,
relentless nature, it is not the cause of
a sudden and unprecedented jump in
food prices. Population growth by
itself can cause trends, but not
discontinuities.
World Affluence
2. The steady though
not-so-relentless growth in world
affluence in many ways mirrors
population growth. In the richer,
better-fed countries with slow
population growth, increased affluence
has permitted a major transformation
in dietary patterns with enormous
consequences on the demand for grain.
At low incomes consumers eat
more grain directly as their incomes
rise - reaching 100 lbs. per capita at
an income level of $500 to $700 per
year.
Beyond this, direct grain
consumption declines to a relatively
stable 150 lbs. per capita as incomes
rise further and consumers can afford
to indulge what seems to be a nearly
universal taste for meat.

Individuals in wealthy countries
such as the United States are now
consuming nearly a ton of grain per
year, five times the amount necessary
for adequate nutrition if eaten in the
form of cereal.
The driving mechanism for this
incredible statistic is the inefficiency
of animal metabolism. A pound of
choice beef requires seven pounds of
grain, a pound of chicken about half
that.
It turns out then that the wealthy
countries have generated heavy
pressures on food resources via their

income growth — even though their
populations are increasing at a
relatively slow rate.
Deviations-from-Trend Factors
3. Although income growth in the
world has been relatively steady over
the past two decades, there have been
ups and downs.
The first three years of 1970s
showed strong economic growth in
many countries, and 1972 saw an
historic simultaneous peaking of
economic booms in Japan, Western
Europe, and North America.
Real growth rates were about
two-thirds higher than the historic rate
of five percent per year.
This added affluence fueled heavy
demand for meat and hence a
multiplied demand for the grains and
soybeans to produce the meat.
Dollar Devaluation
4. The' United States dollar was
devalued twice between August 1971
and the end of 1972.
Our products became cheaper for
foreigners to buy, and countries with
strong currencies such as West
Germany and Japan, both enormous
markets for American feedgrains.
found themselves largely cushioned
from the rise in the dollar prices of our
agricultural exports.
In the absence of devaluation,
demand pressures would have been less
strong.
Anchovies
5. The Humboldt current off the
coast of Peru suddenly shifted course
in 1972, causing the anchovies to
disappear.
These sardine-like fish are the basis
of the world's largest fish catch,
around 10 million tons per year in the
late 1900s.
The virtual disappearance of
fishmeal and oil from world trade in
1972 and 1973 placed an immense

burden on the supply of soybeans, the
major high-protein competitor of
fishmeal in animal feed rations.
Weather
6. The most important deviation
from trend occurred with the weather
in 1972.
The U.S.S.R. suffered one of the
worst droughts in its history; the
monsoon in South and Southeast Asia
was erratic, causing either too much
rain or too little; Australia and Africa
had droughts, and North America had
a cold, wet planting season.
As a result, world wheat production

decreased from the previous year by
about eight million tons, course grain
production about 16 million tons, and
rice production 11 million tons.
A significant decline in all three
grain categories in the same year was
unprecedented in the past 15 years.
The total drop was about 37
million tons of grain, but since normal
trends (and demands) called for an
increase of some 33 million tons, the
net effect was a reduction below trend
of about 70 million tons of grain.
Here, clearly, was the fuse.
Political Factors
7. A shift in United States
agricultural policy in the late 1960s
from production payments under price
support programs to direct
farm income supplements largely
eliminated surplus grain purchases.
The move toward free market
prices, coupled with crop acreage
diversions, removed the rural political
pressures, underlying the accumulation
of surplus grain stocks.
With these pressures gone, the
administration became almost
obsessed with eliminating the stocks
and with avoiding their
reaccumulation. Understanding this
frame of mind is essential to
understanding what happened in 1972
and 1973.
Food Reserve
8. In 1972 the world held reserve
food stocks of 132 million tons of
grain and there was the equivalent of
46 million tons in idled American
cropland.

What has happened in the early
1970s to trigger massive food price
increases and consequent talk of world
famine and consequent talk of world
famine and starvation in a decade?
Is the world at one of the great
discontinuities of human history, so
that the past no longer speaks to the
future? Or did events happen in a
combination unlikely to occur again so
that we are experiencing a temporary
deviation from the path to improved
living standards for man king?
Our personal position is closer to
the latter more optimistic view,
although we expect the food situation
over the next five to 10 years to allow
little cushion for bad weather or bad
policy.
Such a view requires an explanation
of the present food situation in terms
of an unlikely and probably
nonrecurring combination of events.
In retrospect, eight factors
impinged simultaneously in 1972 on
world food supplies to set off the price
explosion. The recent price
discontinuity would not have occurred
in the absence of very many of these
factors The\ fall into three major
categories: trend factors,
deviations from-trend factors', and
politual fa< tors
Trend Factors
1. The relentless growth in the
world's population stands as the basic
mechanism behind all gloomy
predictions of famine ahead. Fach year
sees a population equivalent to
Bangladesh — 80 million people —
added to the demands on the resources
of our planet.
The growth is greatest in those
countries already hungry and where
the prospects for slowing the growth
are bleakest.
However, because of its steady,
relentless nature, it is not the cause of
a sudden and unprecedented jump in
food prices. Population growth by
itself can cause trends, but not
discontinuities.
World Affluence
2. The steady though
not-so-relentless growth in world
affluence in many ways mirrors
population growth. In the richer,
better-fed countries with slow
population growth, increased affluence
has permitted a major transformation
in dietary patterns with enormous
consequences on the demand for grain.
At low incomes consumers eat
more grain directly as their incomes
rise - reaching 100 lbs. per capita at
an income level of $500 to $700 per
year.
Beyond this, direct grain
consumption declines to a relatively
stable 150 lbs. per capita as incomes
rise further and consumers can afford
to indulge what seems to be a nearly
universal taste for meat.

Individuals in wealthy countries
such as the United States are now
consuming nearly a ton of grain per
year, five times the amount necessary
for adequate nutrition if eaten in the
form of cereal.
The driving mechanism for this
incredible statistic is the inefficiency
of animal metabolism. A pound of
choice beef requires seven pounds of
grain, a pound of chicken about half
that.
It turns out then that the wealthy
countries have generated heavy
pressures on food resources via their

income growth — even though their
populations are increasing at a
relatively slow rate.
Deviations-from-Trend Factors
3. Although income growth in the
world has been relatively steady over
the past two decades, there have been
ups and downs.
The first three years of 1970s
showed strong economic growth in
many countries, and 1972 saw an
historic simultaneous peaking of
economic booms in Japan, Western
Europe, and North America.
Real growth rates were about
two-thirds higher than the historic rate
of five percent per year.
This added affluence fueled heavy
demand for meat and hence a
multiplied demand for the grains and
soybeans to produce the meat.
Dollar Devaluation
4. The' United States dollar was
devalued twice between August 1971
and the end of 1972.
Our products became cheaper for
foreigners to buy, and countries with
strong currencies such as West
Germany and Japan, both enormous
markets for American feedgrains.
found themselves largely cushioned
from the rise in the dollar prices of our
agricultural exports.
In the absence of devaluation,
demand pressures would have been less
strong.
Anchovies
5. The Humboldt current off the
coast of Peru suddenly shifted course
in 1972, causing the anchovies to
disappear.
These sardine-like fish are the basis
of the world's largest fish catch,
around 10 million tons per year in the
late 1900s.
The virtual disappearance of
fishmeal and oil from world trade in
1972 and 1973 placed an immense

burden on the supply of soybeans, the
major high-protein competitor of
fishmeal in animal feed rations.
Weather
6. The most important deviation
from trend occurred with the weather
in 1972.
The U.S.S.R. suffered one of the
worst droughts in its history; the
monsoon in South and Southeast Asia
was erratic, causing either too much
rain or too little; Australia and Africa
had droughts, and North America had
a cold, wet planting season.
As a result, world wheat production

decreased from the previous year by
about eight million tons, course grain
production about 16 million tons, and
rice production 11 million tons.
A significant decline in all three
grain categories in the same year was
unprecedented in the past 15 years.
The total drop was about 37
million tons of grain, but since normal
trends (and demands) called for an
increase of some 33 million tons, the
net effect was a reduction below trend
of about 70 million tons of grain.
Here, clearly, was the fuse.
Political Factors
7. A shift in United States
agricultural policy in the late 1960s
from production payments under price
support programs to direct
farm income supplements largely
eliminated surplus grain purchases.
The move toward free market
prices, coupled with crop acreage
diversions, removed the rural political
pressures, underlying the accumulation
of surplus grain stocks.
With these pressures gone, the
administration became almost
obsessed with eliminating the stocks
and with avoiding their
reaccumulation. Understanding this
frame of mind is essential to
understanding what happened in 1972
and 1973.
Food Reserve
8. In 1972 the world held reserve
food stocks of 132 million tons of
grain and there was the equivalent of
46 million tons in idled American
cropland.
Prices certainly had to rise in the
face of substantial production
shortfall. But stocks, although
historically small relative to
consumption needs, were sufficient to
carry the world through this bad year
with some belt-tightening and a careful
and equitable allocation mechanism.
The United States, as the largest
holder of both surplus grain and
cropland, had the opportunity (some
would say the obligation) to see that
the supplies were not preempted by a
single buyer and that the potential
grain in idled cropland be turned into
reality as quickly as possible.
Proper and timely action here could
have been a major stabilizing influence
on the world grain market primed to
explode.
Russian Wheat Deal
Instead, the United States'and the
U.S.S.R.'s actions destabilized the
situation.
The notorious Russian wheat deal is
only half the story, but an important
half.
The Soviets had been large buyers
in world grain markets before, but
only to supplement low supplies for
direct human consumption.
In 1972 the U.S.S.R. bought
massively and secretly in world
markets, a new approach for the
Soviets, to protect its livestock
industry.
Before the world grain exporters,
including the United States who sold
most of it, knew what was happening,
the Russians had bought over 20
million tons of grain.

Walter P. Falcon end C. Peter Timmer

The rest of the world, especially the
poor countries, was profoundly
disturbed to find that the most visible
and accessible part of the world's food
stocks suddenly were not for sale.
The United States treated the deal
initially as a great commercial coup,
simultaneously ridding us of
burdensome surplus stocks and
generating foreign exchange.
Indeed, so preoccupied were
American officials with the burden of
carrying stocks that harvested grain
acreage in 1972 was below any level in
the previous two decades
Even in 1973 nearly 20 million
acres were withheld for fear of getting
the government back in the business of
holding stocks.
And yet, as early as 1971 world
reserve grain stocks had fallen to their
lowest level since the monsoon failures
in India in 1966 and 1967.
Total reserves (counting the
production potential of idled
cropland) were below the 1967 figure,
and reserve as a percent of annual
grain consumption had fallen to half
Ihe average levels of the 1960s
Thus, the second half of the story
was the United States' persistence in
holding stocks down and idling
cropland. Together with the Russian
sale, this struck the match and lit the
fuse. The result was an explosion of
food prices.

The driving mechanism for this
incredible statistic is the inefficiency
of animal metabolism. A pound of
choice beef requires seven pounds of
grain, a pound of chicken about half
that.
It turns out then that the wealthy
countries have generated heavy
pressures on food resources via their

income growth — even though their
populations are increasing at a
relatively slow rate.
Deviations-from-Trend Factors
3. Although income growth in the
world has been relatively steady over
the past two decades, there have been
ups and downs.
The first three years of 1970s
showed strong economic growth in
many countries, and 1972 saw an
historic simultaneous peaking of
economic booms in Japan, Western
Europe, and North America.
Real growth rates were about
two-thirds higher than the historic rate
of five percent per year.
This added affluence fueled heavy
demand for meat and hence a
multiplied demand for the grains and
soybeans to produce the meat.
Dollar Devaluation
4. The' United States dollar was
devalued twice between August 1971
and the end of 1972.
Our products became cheaper for
foreigners to buy, and countries with
strong currencies such as West
Germany and Japan, both enormous
markets for American feedgrains.
found themselves largely cushioned
from the rise in the dollar prices of our
agricultural exports.
In the absence of devaluation,
demand pressures would have been less
strong.
Anchovies
5. The Humboldt current off the
coast of Peru suddenly shifted course
in 1972, causing the anchovies to
disappear.
These sardine-like fish are the basis
of the world's largest fish catch,
around 10 million tons per year in the
late 1900s.
The virtual disappearance of
fishmeal and oil from world trade in
1972 and 1973 placed an immense

burden on the supply of soybeans, the
major high-protein competitor of
fishmeal in animal feed rations.
Weather
6. The most important deviation
from trend occurred with the weather
in 1972.
The U.S.S.R. suffered one of the
worst droughts in its history; the
monsoon in South and Southeast Asia
was erratic, causing either too much
rain or too little; Australia and Africa
had droughts, and North America had
a cold, wet planting season.
As a result, world wheat production

decreased from the previous year by
about eight million tons, course grain
production about 16 million tons, and
rice production 11 million tons.
A significant decline in all three
grain categories in the same year was
unprecedented in the past 15 years.
The total drop was about 37
million tons of grain, but since normal
trends (and demands) called for an
increase of some 33 million tons, the
net effect was a reduction below trend
of about 70 million tons of grain.
Here, clearly, was the fuse.
Political Factors
7. A shift in United States
agricultural policy in the late 1960s
from production payments under price
support programs to direct
farm income supplements largely
eliminated surplus grain purchases.
The move toward free market
prices, coupled with crop acreage
diversions, removed the rural political
pressures, underlying the accumulation
of surplus grain stocks.
With these pressures gone, the
administration became almost
obsessed with eliminating the stocks
and with avoiding their
reaccumulation. Understanding this
frame of mind is essential to
understanding what happened in 1972
and 1973.
Food Reserve
8. In 1972 the world held reserve
food stocks of 132 million tons of
grain and there was the equivalent of
46 million tons in idled American
cropland.
Prices certainly had to rise in the
face of substantial production
shortfall. But stocks, although
historically small relative to
consumption needs, were sufficient to
carry the world through this bad year
with some belt-tightening and a careful
and equitable allocation mechanism.
The United States, as the largest
holder of both surplus grain and
cropland, had the opportunity (some
would say the obligation) to see that
the supplies were not preempted by a
single buyer and that the potential
grain in idled cropland be turned into
reality as quickly as possible.
Proper and timely action here could
have been a major stabilizing influence
on the world grain market primed to
explode.
Russian Wheat Deal
Instead, the United States'and the
U.S.S.R.'s actions destabilized the
situation.
The notorious Russian wheat deal is
only half the story, but an important
half.
The Soviets had been large buyers
in world grain markets before, but
only to supplement low supplies for
direct human consumption.
In 1972 the U.S.S.R. bought
massively and secretly in world
markets, a new approach for the
Soviets, to protect its livestock
industry.
Before the world grain exporters,
including the United States who sold
most of it, knew what was happening,
the Russians had bought over 20
million tons of grain.

The rest of the world, especially the
poor countries, was profoundly
disturbed to find that the most visible
and accessible part of the world's food
stocks suddenly were not for sale.
The United States treated the deal
initially as a great commercial coup,
simultaneously ridding us of
burdensome surplus stocks and
generating foreign exchange.
Indeed, so preoccupied were
American officials with the burden of
carrying stocks that harvested grain
acreage in 1972 was below any level in
the previous two decades
Even in 1973 nearly 20 million
acres were withheld for fear of getting
the government back in the business of
holding stocks.
And yet, as early as 1971 world
reserve grain stocks had fallen to their
lowest level since the monsoon failures
in India in 1966 and 1967.
Total reserves (counting the
production potential of idled
cropland) were below the 1967 figure,
and reserve as a percent of annual
grain consumption had fallen to half
Ihe average levels of the 1960s
Thus, the second half of the story
was the United States' persistence in
holding stocks down and idling
cropland. Together with the Russian
sale, this struck the match and lit the
fuse. The result was an explosion of
food prices.
