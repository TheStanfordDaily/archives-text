# Humanitarianism And Politics
## 
### 
Appeals to feed the world's hungry millions are normally
made in the name of "humanitarianism" — a word denoting
the direct, positive response by one human being to the
sufferings of another without regard to the other's identity
or ideology.
After seeing pictures of starving people in other
countries, we may decide to reduce our own consumption
of food and send the money saved thereby to individuals
whose very survival may depend upon our generosity.
We like to think that this transaction, because of the
simplicity and purity of our motives, is not political in
character. Similarly, if we wish more public funds spent on
starvation relief, we are likely to argue for the separation of
food aid from politics.
Protein supplements and seeds, we say, should be
provided on the basis of individual human need, not the
national interest as defined by public officials in donor and
recipient countries.
Political Context
Efforts to insulate apparently selfless acts from the
political realm, ruled as it is by individual and collective
selfishness, are understandable and in some ways laudable.
But idealism that is not infused from the outset with
awareness of the political context in which the idealist, must
operate leads all too often, upon discovery of the facts, to
cynicism.
There are at least three ways in which decisions
regarding international food aid are political in nature. If
we can openly acknowledge this fact of life, the likelihood
of future disillusionment and cynicism is greatly reduced,
and the staying power and effectiveness of our idealism are
enhanced.
'Choose Among Actors'
First, in deciding what I should do I must choose among
actors who directly participate in national or international
political life.
If I choose, for instance, to channel my limited funds
and energies through a private U.S.-based organization, I am
in effect making a statement about the relative merits of
this country's private and public sectors in meeting global
need, and I am also favoring an agency accountable to my
own government over others more broadly international in
composition.
Or, to take another example, if I say that I am donating
money even though I do not need to do so, I am implicitly
rejecting the argument that my funds be considered
reparations for past exploitation of the suffering group by
the country, race, or economic system of which I am a part.
I take a political stand when I reject the claim that a
class of people linked to me in sor.K way is responsibl o for
famine elsewhere in the world, just as I take r. political
stand if I accept the validity of this claim.
Delivery System
Second, between me and the intended recipient of food
aid is a vast, complex, expensive international delivery
system, whose component parts use my funds as weapons
in the battle for organizational survival and dominance.
To the °xtent that food is a scarce, highly-valued
resource, access to it and freedom to allocate it are forms of
power, and all the bureaucracies involved — whether public
or private, in the donor or the recipient country — will treat
food as power.
We should presume unless shown otherwise that my
money will in part be used to consolidate the position of
som< individuals within each agency handling my donation,
in part to protect each agency 's ' turf" against rival groups.

David 8. Abernethy

and in part to protect the international interests of each
agency's home country.
Third, food aid may have political consequences not
foreseen by the actors financing and distributing it.
Scandals over the misuse of relief supplies may result in a
change of leadership or regime.
This may have been a factor in the recent coup in Chad,
many of whose top officials allegedly made a hefty profit
from the truck monopoly transporting food from the
Nigerian border to thedrought-stricken Chadian hinterland.
On occasion, donor agencies may be more willing to
provide food than governments in famine-affected areas are
to accept it, for it is humiliating for sovereign states to
admit inability to cope with a domestic tragedy.
The resentment of the weak and poor at having to
depend on the powerful and rich for the bare necessities of
life may generate tensions among states that none of them
fully anticipated.
It is not possible to transcend politics when one acts to
relieve human suffering in other countries. The most
admirable donors, there, are those who know they are
playing with power and play the game well, not those who
refuse to acknowledge the name, and the rules of the game.

Delivery System
Second, between me and the intended recipient of food
aid is a vast, complex, expensive international delivery
system, whose component parts use my funds as weapons
in the battle for organizational survival and dominance.
To the °xtent that food is a scarce, highly-valued
resource, access to it and freedom to allocate it are forms of
power, and all the bureaucracies involved — whether public
or private, in the donor or the recipient country — will treat
food as power.
We should presume unless shown otherwise that my
money will in part be used to consolidate the position of
som< individuals within each agency handling my donation,
in part to protect each agency 's ' turf" against rival groups.

David 8. Abernethy

and in part to protect the international interests of each
agency's home country.
Third, food aid may have political consequences not
foreseen by the actors financing and distributing it.
Scandals over the misuse of relief supplies may result in a
change of leadership or regime.
This may have been a factor in the recent coup in Chad,
many of whose top officials allegedly made a hefty profit
from the truck monopoly transporting food from the
Nigerian border to thedrought-stricken Chadian hinterland.
On occasion, donor agencies may be more willing to
provide food than governments in famine-affected areas are
to accept it, for it is humiliating for sovereign states to
admit inability to cope with a domestic tragedy.
The resentment of the weak and poor at having to
depend on the powerful and rich for the bare necessities of
life may generate tensions among states that none of them
fully anticipated.
It is not possible to transcend politics when one acts to
relieve human suffering in other countries. The most
admirable donors, there, are those who know they are
playing with power and play the game well, not those who
refuse to acknowledge the name, and the rules of the game.

Appeals to feed the world's hungry millions are normally
made in the name of "humanitarianism" — a word denoting
the direct, positive response by one human being to the
sufferings of another without regard to the other's identity
or ideology.
After seeing pictures of starving people in other
countries, we may decide to reduce our own consumption
of food and send the money saved thereby to individuals
whose very survival may depend upon our generosity.
We like to think that this transaction, because of the
simplicity and purity of our motives, is not political in
character. Similarly, if we wish more public funds spent on
starvation relief, we are likely to argue for the separation of
food aid from politics.
Protein supplements and seeds, we say, should be
provided on the basis of individual human need, not the
national interest as defined by public officials in donor and
recipient countries.
Political Context
Efforts to insulate apparently selfless acts from the
political realm, ruled as it is by individual and collective
selfishness, are understandable and in some ways laudable.
But idealism that is not infused from the outset with
awareness of the political context in which the idealist, must
operate leads all too often, upon discovery of the facts, to
cynicism.
There are at least three ways in which decisions
regarding international food aid are political in nature. If
we can openly acknowledge this fact of life, the likelihood
of future disillusionment and cynicism is greatly reduced,
and the staying power and effectiveness of our idealism are
enhanced.
'Choose Among Actors'
First, in deciding what I should do I must choose among
actors who directly participate in national or international
political life.
If I choose, for instance, to channel my limited funds
and energies through a private U.S.-based organization, I am
in effect making a statement about the relative merits of
this country's private and public sectors in meeting global
need, and I am also favoring an agency accountable to my
own government over others more broadly international in
composition.
Or, to take another example, if I say that I am donating
money even though I do not need to do so, I am implicitly
rejecting the argument that my funds be considered
reparations for past exploitation of the suffering group by
the country, race, or economic system of which I am a part.
I take a political stand when I reject the claim that a
class of people linked to me in sor.K way is responsibl o for
famine elsewhere in the world, just as I take r. political
stand if I accept the validity of this claim.
Delivery System
Second, between me and the intended recipient of food
aid is a vast, complex, expensive international delivery
system, whose component parts use my funds as weapons
in the battle for organizational survival and dominance.
To the °xtent that food is a scarce, highly-valued
resource, access to it and freedom to allocate it are forms of
power, and all the bureaucracies involved — whether public

food as power.
We should presume unless shown otherwise that my

som< individuals within each agency handling my donation,
in part to protect each agency 's ' turf" against rival groups.
