WE NEED YOUR HELP
The ASSU Publications Board hasn't sought a student fee assessment in three years.
We're seeking one now.
Why? Costs are rising: pap->r, supplies, lahor, printing. Inflation and recession have
Taken their tolls. It's !iD r der than ever to keep a publication going, let alone start one up.
Stanford currently has a flourishing publication scene. General interest products like
the Chaparral and Live Oak. Scholarly and literary journals like the Stanford Review and
Sequoia. Important alternative voices like the Real News and Chicanismo.
But without help and support from the community, these publications - and many
more like them â€” face an uphill struggle.
You can help. Please vote YES on the Publications Board's refundable fee assessment
next week.
