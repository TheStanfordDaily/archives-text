# Phnom Penh Taken By Khmer Rouge
## 
### 
PHNOM PENH (AP)—Phnom Penh
surrendered to the Khmer Rouge
insurgents today and welcomed the
Communist-led rebels with white flags
and banners on every building in the
city.
People stood on the sidewalks
waving to the incoming,
Communist-led rebels who for three
years battled the military leaders who
overthrew Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
Sad-faced Premier Long Boret
drove from his villa to the government
headquarters to make a broadcast.
Meanwhile, Khieu Samphan, the
deputy premier of Sihanouk's
government in exile, was reported to
have broadcast a warning to all
members of the vanquished
government and all politicians to leave
the country immediately for their own
safety.
Khmer Rouge troops were
reportedly embracing Cambodian
army soldiers they encountered. A
Khmer Rouge broadcast reported
fighting in the city earlier this
morning, but the reports from Phnom
Penh made no mention of any
resistance to the entry of the
Communist-led insurgents.
Flags And Banners
On the Mekong and Tonle Sap
rivers along the east side of the city,
government gunboats steamed up and
down, hoisting white flags and banners

at 8 a.m., according to newsmen.
Fourteen armored personnel
carriers of the 2nd Infantry Division
toured the streets with white flags. A
jeep and a truck loaded with smiling
soldiers followed one of the armored
cars.
"The white flag means cease-fire,"
said an officer in the truck.
The officer said the display of
surrender flags had been ordered by
the Cambodian military command.
Forces Penetrate
The surrender came after the
Khmer Rouge forces had penetrated to

the heart of Phnom Penh and occupied
the city's chief Buddhist temple.
A broadcast said the
Communist-led insurgents first
captured the university on the western
outskirts of the Cambodian capital and
then advanced on the presidential
palace in the southern part of the city.
Another broadcast said rebel forces
had also taken the suburb of Tuol
Kauk on the northwest edge of the
capital and controlled a village just
across the Bassac River from the
southern end of the city.
Tuol Kauk contains a residential

district with homes of many wealthy
Cambodians and a military
headquarters. The insurgent broadcast
said "hundreds of people and soldiers"
have fled from the recently reinforced
headquarters and that "many of them
turned their guns and joined our side."
Earlier, an insurgent broadcast said
Khmer Rouge troops said heavy
fighting was continuing in
Battambang, capital of a rice-rich
province 150 miles northwest of
Phnom Penh.
Cambodia's leaders had offered a
cease-fire and transfer of power to

Sihanouk in Peking, who turned them
down.
The International Committee of the
Red Cross said in Geneva it had sent to
Sihanouk in Peking a telegram
containing the appeal and offer from
Gen. Sak Sutsakhan, who rose to
power in Cambodia after President
Lon Nol fled. Sihanouk was ousted by
Lon Not in 1970.
The Red Cross said the telegram to
Sihanouk contained "a request for an
immediate cease-fire and a proposal
for the transfer of government
powers."
The Red Cross said the message

from Sutsakhan, suggested that the
cease-fire and transfer of authority be
under the supervision of the Red Cross
group operating a security zone at the
Hotel Le Phnom in Phnom Penh.
Sihanouk said the only course left
to Phnom Penh's defenders was to
"lay down their arms, raise the white
flag and surrender."
He said the government's offer was
unacceptable and denounced the
Phnom Penh leaders as "traitors who
deserve hanging and should try and
escape while they can."

Red Cross said in Geneva it had sent to
Sihanouk in Peking a telegram
containing the appeal and offer from
Gen. Sak Sutsakhan, who rose to
power in Cambodia after President
Lon Nol fled. Sihanouk was ousted by
Lon Not in 1970.
The Red Cross said the telegram to
Sihanouk contained "a request for an
immediate cease-fire and a proposal
for the transfer of government
powers."
The Red Cross said the message

from Sutsakhan, suggested that the
cease-fire and transfer of authority be
under the supervision of the Red Cross
group operating a security zone at the
Hotel Le Phnom in Phnom Penh.
Sihanouk said the only course left
to Phnom Penh's defenders was to
"lay down their arms, raise the white
flag and surrender."
He said the government's offer was
unacceptable and denounced the
Phnom Penh leaders as "traitors who
deserve hanging and should try and
escape while they can."
PHNOM PENH (AP)—Phnom Penh
surrendered to the Khmer Rouge
insurgents today and welcomed the
Communist-led rebels with white flags
and banners on every building in the
city.
People stood on the sidewalks
waving to the incoming,
Communist-led rebels who for three
years battled the military leaders who
overthrew Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
Sad-faced Premier Long Boret
drove from his villa to the government
headquarters to make a broadcast.
Meanwhile, Khieu Samphan, the
deputy premier of Sihanouk's
government in exile, was reported to
have broadcast a warning to all
members of the vanquished
government and all politicians to leave
the country immediately for their own
safety.
Khmer Rouge troops were
reportedly embracing Cambodian
army soldiers they encountered. A
Khmer Rouge broadcast reported
fighting in the city earlier this
morning, but the reports from Phnom
Penh made no mention of any
resistance to the entry of the
Communist-led insurgents.
Flags And Banners
On the Mekong and Tonle Sap
rivers along the east side of the city,
government gunboats steamed up and
down, hoisting white flags and banners

at 8 a.m., according to newsmen.
Fourteen armored personnel
carriers of the 2nd Infantry Division
toured the streets with white flags. A
jeep and a truck loaded with smiling
soldiers followed one of the armored
cars.
"The white flag means cease-fire,"
said an officer in the truck.
The officer said the display of
surrender flags had been ordered by
the Cambodian military command.

The surrender came after the
Khmer Rouge forces had penetrated to

the heart of Phnom Penh and occupied
the city's chief Buddhist temple.
A broadcast said the
Communist-led insurgents first
captured the university on the western
outskirts of the Cambodian capital and
then advanced on the presidential
palace in the southern part of the city.
Another broadcast said rebel forces
had also taken the suburb of Tuol
Kauk on the northwest edge of the
capital and controlled a village just
across the Bassac River from the
southern end of the city.
Tuol Kauk contains a residential

district with homes of many wealthy
Cambodians and a military
headquarters. The insurgent broadcast
said "hundreds of people and soldiers"
have fled from the recently reinforced
headquarters and that "many of them
turned their guns and joined our side."
Earlier, an insurgent broadcast said
Khmer Rouge troops said heavy
fighting was continuing in
Battambang, capital of a rice-rich
province 150 miles northwest of
Phnom Penh.
Cambodia's leaders had offered a
cease-fire and transfer of power to

down.
