# 'Baby lift': A Publicity Stunt
## 
### 
In recent weeks, millions of Americans have
been saddened and angered by the mass exodus of
refugees from Vietnamese war zones and by the
plight of war orphans. The news media and the
Ford Administration have kept the issue in the
consciousness of every citizen.
Yet where were their cries of concern during the
last 12 years, when the U.S. dropped the equivalent
of 400 Hiroshima-sized bombs on Vietnam, turning
almost half the entire population into refugees?
Our war caused 130,000 civilian casualties a
month — many of them children. Why is President
Ford, who so staunchly supported these policies,
now moved by the plight of the refugees?
Why has the United States spent more money
airlifting 1700 orphans than it spent in all of 1973
caring for South Vietnam's 880,000 orphans?
Publicity Stunt
One obvious reason is that P'ord gets favorable
publicity when he flies specially to greet the
orphans on their arrival here. Another reason is that
the United States has quietly used the airlift to
evacuate workers from the United States embassy
in Saigon. But Ambassador to South Vietnam
Graham Martin gave the main rationale.
Evacuation of orphans, Martin said, "will help
create a shift in American public opinion in favor
of the Republic of Vietnam. Especially when these
children land in the United States, they will be
subject to television, radio and press agency
coverage and the effect will be tremendous."
Martin is right. The media — reinforced by the
United States government — have systematically
distorted the nature of recent events in Vietnam.
Most accounts suggest, for example, that refugees
are fleeing the "Red onslaught" due to fear of
Communism.
According to New York Times interviews,
however, the refugees are simply afraid of war.

"I think the Communists maybe will be all
right," said one taxi driver. "But it's no good to be
caught in the war zone. That's where vou can be
killed."
A woman explained why she was moving south:
"It's better to go to the Saigon side, because the
Communists have no airplanes." The last time she
stayed near a battle zone American planes bombed
her family. She is wise to flee; President Thieu has
declared all "enemy" territories to be "free-fire
zones."
Thieu's bombers have raided market places in
recently captured towns and recently, his cargo
planes dropped 15,000 anti-personnel bombs near
Nha Trang, a provincial capital.
President Ford wants to send more of these
bombs to South Vietnam. Paradoxically, even as he
would kill more children, he organized with great
fanfare the "babylift" of orphans out of the
country to win public sentiment for further aid to
the Thieu regime. This orphan airlift is perhaps the
final outrage of the war.
How will taking Vietnam's last remaining asset —
its children — help the country? Many of the
children are not even parentless, but were
temporarily placed in orphanages to insure that
they would be fed (some volunteer workers even
accuse the orphanages of organizing a profitable
"baby market" to sell children to families in the
United States). How can we be sure that
Vietnamese children, uprooted from their culture,
will adjust well to America?
As one angry black asked recently, "Do you
think they'll be allowed in the South Boston
schools?"
The American people must not be taken in by
Ford's sudden outburst of humanitarian concern.
They have been fooled too often.
