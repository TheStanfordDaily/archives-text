# Oil Glut Politics Fosters Cartel
## 
### Bill Evers 
The world is experiencing a petroleum
glut, not the shortage constantly whined
about by economically ignorant news
commentators.
The empirical evidence is everywhere. On
April 6, The New York Times reported that
Europe has plentiful stocks of oil (60 to 90
days' worth). Storage depots are full across
the continent.
Similarly, according to the Times, Japan is
"surfeited with oil at the moment." Serious
consideration has been given to putting some
Japanese supertankers at anchor off-shore as
floating storage units because storage
facilities on the land are filled to the brim. A
63-day supply is currently stockpiled.
Extreme Situation
The situation is extreme enough that
Japanese oil executives are trying to get Iraq
to cut back petroleum shipments to Japan.
Oil is a "surplus" commodity. Articles in
the oil industry press report that several
producers (Kuwait, Saskatchewan, Ecuador)
have cut production because of reduced
demand at the current high price.
Both The New York Times and the oil
industry press have reported on the idleness
in the tanker trade because of the glut. A
recent issue of the Oil Daily said:
"With less oil being demanded and with
more tankers around to carry it, the market
has collapsed, pushing charter rates through
the floor and leaving dozens of ships totally
without work."
The article adds that there are now
four-and-one-half million tons of tankers now
awaiting cargo in the Persian Gulf.
Glut Predicted
Recognizing the existence of the glut puts
into perspective the memorandum from the
files of Standard Oil of California discovered

by Senate investigators in the late 19605. The
memorandum projected a problem of "excess
supply" in the early 1970s unless efforts
were made to curtail production.
What has been the policy of the U.S.
government in the face of the oil glut and in
the face of oil companies' worries that such a
glut will upset their situation? The U.S.
government has proposed putting a floor
under oil prices (at a time when oil prices are
falling because they are too high for the
market!).
The government is also trying to cut back
imports by one million barrels a day. Both
policies are economically destructive and

serve special interests.
According to a story in the March 21 Wall
Street Journal, the governments of 18 of the
major industrial nations (led by the U.S.)
have agreed in principle to set a common
minimum price for imported petroleum sold
on their domestic markets.
Bureaucrat Satisfied
Afterwards, Thomas Enders. U.S. assistant
secretary of state, said he was "very
satisfied" with the agreement, which is in line
with Henry Kissinger's 1974 proposals for
setting a floor under oil prices.
But consumers have no reason to be "very

satisfied" with the agreement and the U.S.
government program. Economist Murray N.
Rothbard writes: "The Ford program is a
program to intensify the cartel, to restrict the
supply of oil further and to raise the price: in
short, to protect the oil cartellists from the
powerful forces of market competition, to
prevent any fall in oil prices, and to raise
those prices still further by U.S. government
coercion.
"And, of course, to cut the American oil
companies into a larger share of the world
cartel pie. All at the expense of the
consumers, here and abroad. One important
tipoff on this policy was President Ford's
bald-faced proposal to place a compulsory
minimum floor on the price of oil. How stark
a cartellizing program can we have?"
Wartime Nostalgia
Then there is the Ford conservation
program. Amid rhetoric reminiscent of
wartime, we are told that we must accept
sacrifices. The Ford administration and the
U.S.-inspired International Energy Agency
have called for one million barrel a day
conservation. Une house of Congress has
passed a measure mandating a four percent
cutback in oil imports into the United States.
But as Joseph Kraft pointed out in the
Feb. 3 New York Post, the Ford program
adds to inflation by raising the prices of
petroleum and petroleum products and
intensifies recession and unemployment by
cutting production and demand for oil and
other products. What do we get in return for
our sacrifices? Government-imposed higher
prices in a time of glut.

glut will upset their situation? The U.S.
government has proposed putting a floor
under oil prices (at a time when oil prices are
falling because they are too high for the
market!).
The government is also trying to cut back
imports by one million barrels a day. Both
policies are economically destructive and

serve special interests.
According to a story in the March 21 Wall
Street Journal, the governments of 18 of the
major industrial nations (led by the U.S.)
have agreed in principle to set a common
minimum price for imported petroleum sold
on their domestic markets.
Bureaucrat Satisfied
Afterwards, Thomas Enders. U.S. assistant
secretary of state, said he was "very
satisfied" with the agreement, which is in line
with Henry Kissinger's 1974 proposals for
setting a floor under oil prices.
But consumers have no reason to be "very

satisfied" with the agreement and the U.S.
government program. Economist Murray N.
Rothbard writes: "The Ford program is a
program to intensify the cartel, to restrict the
supply of oil further and to raise the price: in
short, to protect the oil cartellists from the
powerful forces of market competition, to
prevent any fall in oil prices, and to raise
those prices still further by U.S. government
coercion.
"And, of course, to cut the American oil
companies into a larger share of the world
cartel pie. All at the expense of the
consumers, here and abroad. One important
tipoff on this policy was President Ford's
bald-faced proposal to place a compulsory
minimum floor on the price of oil. How stark
a cartellizing program can we have?"
Wartime Nostalgia
Then there is the Ford conservation
program. Amid rhetoric reminiscent of
wartime, we are told that we must accept
sacrifices. The Ford administration and the
U.S.-inspired International Energy Agency
have called for one million barrel a day
conservation. Une house of Congress has
passed a measure mandating a four percent
cutback in oil imports into the United States.
But as Joseph Kraft pointed out in the
Feb. 3 New York Post, the Ford program
adds to inflation by raising the prices of
petroleum and petroleum products and
intensifies recession and unemployment by
cutting production and demand for oil and
other products. What do we get in return for
our sacrifices? Government-imposed higher
prices in a time of glut.

The world is experiencing a petroleum
glut, not the shortage constantly whined
about by economically ignorant news
commentators.
The empirical evidence is everywhere. On
April 6, The New York Times reported that
Europe has plentiful stocks of oil (60 to 90
days' worth). Storage depots are full across
the continent.
Similarly, according to the Times, Japan is
"surfeited with oil at the moment." Serious
consideration has been given to putting some
Japanese supertankers at anchor off-shore as
floating storage units because storage
facilities on the land are filled to the brim. A
63-day supply is currently stockpiled.
Extreme Situation
The situation is extreme enough that
Japanese oil executives are trying to get Iraq
to cut back petroleum shipments to Japan.
Oil is a "surplus" commodity. Articles in
the oil industry press report that several
producers (Kuwait, Saskatchewan, Ecuador)
have cut production because of reduced
demand at the current high price.
Both The New York Times and the oil
industry press have reported on the idleness
in the tanker trade because of the glut. A
recent issue of the Oil Daily said:
"With less oil being demanded and with
more tankers around to carry it, the market
has collapsed, pushing charter rates through
the floor and leaving dozens of ships totally
without work."
The article adds that there are now
four-and-one-half million tons of tankers now
awaiting cargo in the Persian Gulf.
Glut Predicted
Recognizing the existence of the glut puts
into perspective the memorandum from the
files of Standard Oil of California discovered

by Senate investigators in the late 19605. The
memorandum projected a problem of "excess
supply" in the early 1970s unless efforts
were made to curtail production.
