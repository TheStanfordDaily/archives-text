# Support C-15 Plan To Revise CJP
## 
### 
The Committee of Fifteen has
recently proposed amendments to
Article II of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968. Next
Wednesday and Thursday, the
student body will be able to vote
on the future of their judicial
system. We strongly urge the
students to vote YES on the
proposed changes.
Since 1971, the student body
has been subjected to a judicial

system about which it has known
little and which it has never
ratified. The system, known as the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP), was
established by President Lyman
when the ASSU Senate refused to
nominate members to a selection
panel whose job it was to place
students on the CJP.
Since then, the Committee of
Fifteen (C-15), a group composed
of faculty, student and
administration delegates, has met
annually to attempt to amend the
Charter in such a way as to
establish a system agreeable to all
constituencies.
Repeatedly, in the four years
since the establishment of the
CJP, the faculty and students on
the C-15 have, in better times,
discussed and debated, in worse
times, quarreled and bickered,
two important principles of the
judicial system: the composition
of the Judicial Panel and the
selection of its members.
Faculty Chairman
The CJP presently consists of
seven members — three students,
three faculty members, and a law
school-faculty chairman, selected
by the president of the University.
While the chairman only votes in
cases of a tie, nonetheless, in
crucial and divisive situations, the
balance of judgment has swayed
to the faculty in what indeed is a
judicial system for the students.
Students have argued on the
pretext of the right to jury by
one's peers; faculty, who have
very little to gain and much to
lose by any changes in the system,
have argued that, in times of
stress, students cannot be trusted.
The new amendments to the
Charter are, in fact, a compromise
intended to please both groups.
The revision of panel composition
is this: that the panel will consist
of three students, three faculty
members and two chairpersons,
one a faculty member, the other
from the Law School student
body.
The student chairperson will
preside over and vote to break ties
in Honor Code hearings (which
last year amounted to over 90
percent of all disciplinary cases);

the faculty chairperson will
preside over and vote to break ties
in all other cases (which allows
the faculty some control in "times
of stress").
Member Selection
The second area of contention
has been that of the selection of
members. Presently, faculty
members of the Panel are selected
by the Committee on Committees
of the Academic Senate; student
members are chosen at random by
the Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs.
Students have argued that such
asymmetry reflects a general lack
of trust in students, as well as
allowing the faculty to politically
select its members. Faculty, who
again have little to gain from any
changes to the system, contend
that, on the basis of the
experience four years ago,
students cannot always be
counted on to select three
students to serve on the panel.
The new amendments to the
Charter again represent a
compromise. Faculty members
will continue to be selected by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate. Student
members and alternates will now
be appointed by the ASSU Senate
from a randomly-selected pool of
24 registered students who have
indicated a willingness to serve.
In the event that the ASSU
Senate fails to appoint student
members', they shall be selected
randomly for that year from the
registered student body at large.
Probation Reports
A third revision of the new
proposal is a procedure under
which the student, complainant or
appropriate chairperson can
request a probation-type report to
be prepared by the Dean of
Student Affairs. This, we feel, will
enable the panel to understand
more adequately the
circumstances surrounding the
case.
We believe that the proposed
amendments coming from the
C-15 are not the best of all
worlds. But. as students, we must
bear in mind that there are other

constituencies that make up the
University community
constituencies which, at present,
possess a great deal of power they
are not inclined to relinquish.
We feel that the student body
has for too long been judged
under a system which is
illegitimate and intolerable. Now,
the students have an opportunity
to assist in correcting that
situation.

The Committee of Fifteen has
recently proposed amendments to
Article II of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968. Next
Wednesday and Thursday, the
student body will be able to vote
on the future of their judicial
system. We strongly urge the
students to vote YES on the
proposed changes.
Since 1971, the student body
has been subjected to a judicial

system about which it has known
little and which it has never
ratified. The system, known as the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP), was
established by President Lyman
when the ASSU Senate refused to
nominate members to a selection
panel whose job it was to place
students on the CJP.
Since then, the Committee of
Fifteen (C-15), a group composed
of faculty, student and
administration delegates, has met
annually to attempt to amend the
Charter in such a way as to
establish a system agreeable to all
constituencies.
Repeatedly, in the four years
since the establishment of the
CJP, the faculty and students on
the C-15 have, in better times,
discussed and debated, in worse
times, quarreled and bickered,
two important principles of the
judicial system: the composition
of the Judicial Panel and the
selection of its members.
Faculty Chairman
The CJP presently consists of
seven members — three students,
three faculty members, and a law
school-faculty chairman, selected
by the president of the University.
While the chairman only votes in
cases of a tie, nonetheless, in
crucial and divisive situations, the
balance of judgment has swayed
to the faculty in what indeed is a
judicial system for the students.
Students have argued on the
pretext of the right to jury by
one's peers; faculty, who have
very little to gain and much to
lose by any changes in the system,
have argued that, in times of
stress, students cannot be trusted.
The new amendments to the
Charter are, in fact, a compromise
intended to please both groups.
The revision of panel composition
is this: that the panel will consist
of three students, three faculty
members and two chairpersons,
one a faculty member, the other
from the Law School student
body.
The student chairperson will
preside over and vote to break ties
in Honor Code hearings (which
last year amounted to over 90
percent of all disciplinary cases);

the faculty chairperson will
preside over and vote to break ties
in all other cases (which allows
the faculty some control in "times
of stress").
Member Selection
The second area of contention
has been that of the selection of
members. Presently, faculty
members of the Panel are selected
by the Committee on Committees
of the Academic Senate; student
members are chosen at random by
the Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs.
Students have argued that such
asymmetry reflects a general lack
of trust in students, as well as
allowing the faculty to politically
select its members. Faculty, who
again have little to gain from any
changes to the system, contend
that, on the basis of the
experience four years ago,
students cannot always be
counted on to select three
students to serve on the panel.
The new amendments to the
Charter again represent a
compromise. Faculty members
will continue to be selected by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate. Student
members and alternates will now
be appointed by the ASSU Senate
from a randomly-selected pool of
24 registered students who have
indicated a willingness to serve.
In the event that the ASSU
Senate fails to appoint student
members', they shall be selected
randomly for that year from the
registered student body at large.
Probation Reports
A third revision of the new
proposal is a procedure under
which the student, complainant or
appropriate chairperson can
request a probation-type report to
be prepared by the Dean of
Student Affairs. This, we feel, will
enable the panel to understand
more adequately the
circumstances surrounding the
case.
We believe that the proposed
amendments coming from the
C-15 are not the best of all
worlds. But. as students, we must
bear in mind that there are other
