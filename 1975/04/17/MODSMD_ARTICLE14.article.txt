Food Day
Editor:
At a time when millions of
people throughout the world are
near starvation and as many as 10
million may die of hunger in the
next year alone, we — faculty,
students, and staff in Humanities
Special Programs — feel an urgent
and anguished need to begin to
respond to the crisis of world
hunger.
As a beginning of the process
of reconsidering our habits of
consumption, and of urging a
change in our government's policy
of food aid, we plan, as part of
our observation of Food Day
today, to either fast or
significantly cut down on our
consumption of food on that day.
We will donate the money we save
by so doing to one of the major
relief organizations.
We cannot strongly enough
urge our fellow members of the
Stanford community to join us in
observing Food Day, to attend the
various programs, and above all to
join us in a fast. We realize that
the fast is only a limited gesture,
but we hope it will mark the first
step to a far broader process of
study and action.

'Journey' Review
Editor:
I would like to respond briefly
to Mark Backer's letter (Daily,
April 4) concerning my review of
Journey's album.
First, I acknowledge, as I hope
Backer does, that musical taste is
exclusively in the ear of the
beholder. However, I offer two
facts which counter Backer's
opinions.
Backer said that the members
of Journey "are complete
unknowns outside the Bay Area."
Nonetheless, roughly 30 percent
of the album sales to date by
these "unknowns" have been on
the East Coast. That means
nothing until one realizes that
their first live appearance on the
East Coast will occur late this
month.
According to Backer, guitarist
"Neil Schon is still in the Little
League compared to the
combined talents of Clapton and
Duane All man."
Eric Clapton must not have
thought so when, in 1970, he
invited Schon to join Derek and
the Dominoes — Schon was 16,
and might have accepted the offer
had he not already accepted a
place in Santana.

He's No Crumb
Editor:
As a long-suffering fan of
Stanford basketball, I hail the
courageous actions of Fred
Hargadon in sending one of his
letters of acceptance to Dick
Dißiaso in the face of
heavy-handed lobhying in behalf
of Bub Bowling by Mike Simons'
Alliance for Radical Change.
Do not be alarmed by the new
coach's "University of Stanford"
remark, fans. It is actually a good
omen. When the coach of the
other Cardinals, Denny Crum,
accepted his present job, he
remarked that he was delighted to
be at the University of
"Lewis-ville."
But, Dick. Give us fans here at
the "U of S" a break — leave
those green shoes in South Bend.
