## Bug Me 'The Making Of A Stanford Woman' 
### Patty Fels 
An alumnus once told me that a Stanford
female did not become a bona fide
Stanford woman until she was kissed by a
Stanford man under a full moon in the
middle of Memorial Court (or is it the
middle of the Quad?) or something like
that. What are the exact stipulations?
There're only a couple of full moons left
this quarter and I want to be ready to do
the job right. —J.C.
The tradition you describe is officially
known as "the making of a Stanford
Woman" and is described in the Daily
(Sept. 25, 1964) in this way:
"No Stanford undergraduate woman is
considered a true Stanford Woman until
she has been kissed by a Stanford senior, at
twelve midnight, under a full moon, in the
middle of the Quad."
Apparently, this was once an old and
hallowed tradition on nights of the full
moon. Seniors and their girlfriends would
gather at the middle of the Quad in what
was called Senior Circle. Crowds of
freshmen would also turn out for the
event, armed with water balloons. At the
stroke of midnight there would be much
kissing and balloon throwing, and countless
wet but happy coeds would leave the
Circle, secure in the knowledge that they
were women at last.
One October night in 1961 the tradition
got a little out of hand, and the ensuing
uproar occupied the Daily's editorial pages
for over a week. The controversy began
when an irate senior named Bill Griffin
wrote a lengthy, vituperous column
describing what he called "one of the most
appalling acts of pure crudeness and
stupidity that I have encountered since
coming to Stanford." The whole thing
began, according to Griffin, when almost
250 freshmen showed up at the Quad,
armed with not only balloons but with
buckets, hoses and wastebaskets. It was the
day of the first midterm (in then-required
and despised Western Civ) and the
freshmen were out for blood.

Screaming obscenities, they surrounded
the Circle, trying to snatch fledgling
women from their dates, and running down
those who tried to escape with bicycles and
electric carts. A "German couple,"
attracted by the noise, was attacked by this
"pack of animals" who grabbed the girl,
shouting "Rape her! Rape her!" before she
panicked and ran. They finally trapped her
in the bushes, but proceeded to do little
more than throw water on her before she
was rescued by her date and Griffin, the
hero of the story.
Griffin ended his column with a
suggestion for an 11 p.m. curfew for
freshmen and more stringent discipline by
their sponsors.
The response was immediate. The next
day, two freshmen wrote to ask whether
Griffin was affiliated with the Stanford
Morality League. Others suggested that the
ceremony be henceforth held on the 18th
green of the golf course or inside the
church so that it would achieve a "far
deeper significance." Another suggestion
was that the freshmen be allowed to
immediately pledge into fraternities.
According to the writer of the letter, this
would siphon off the "wild" freshmen and
allow the others to join those houses where
"the great majority of campus leaders"
were produced.
On the next day, both the front page
and the opinions page were filled with the
story. " 'Full Moon Incident' Aired at
Legislature" screamed the front page
headline in inch-high type. A story, written
by Editor Jerry Rankin, reported the
student legislature's demand that the
freshmen men involved turn themselves
into the Freshman Men's Judicial Council,
in compliance with the Fundamental
Standard. The legislature also adopted a
motion expressing its confidence in the
judgment and maturity of the freshman
class, and its disappointment in the
behavior of those freshmen involved in
"the ruckus."

On the edit page, the response was
overwhelmingly negative. One student
suggested that the Fundamental Standard
be changed to the "FUN-AMENTAL
Standard" since that was undoubtedly the
disgraceful direction in which the
University was heading. The Inter-Club
Council and Inter-Fraternity Council sent a
joint letter, declaring that the University
had suffered "moral injury" at the hands
of the scurrilous freshmen.
And finally, in what was to become the
second scandal of the week, a freshman
named Pete Steil suggested that an even
stricter 10 p.m. curfew be imposed on
Wilbur freshmen for a month. Steil was
running for LASSU representative from
Wilbur Hall, and the letter was apparently
forged by an over-zealous opponent. Some
Stanford traditions never change.
Another column that day was written
by the head sponsor at Wilbur. He
defended the freshman program but issued
a warning: "To the Stanford freshmen we
say this: Most of you are presently

experiencing more personal freedom than
you have had at any previous time...
personal freedom implicitly requires
personal responsibility."
By the following Monday, things had
begun to calm down. The opinions page
contained an apology written by the
Wilbur house officers for the entire
freshman class. Another letter charged that
the incident had been blown out of
proportion. The writer sympathized with
the freshmen, since "it is common
knowledge that this first midterm is quite a
traumatic experience."
The "full moon incident" finally came
to a resolution several days later when 76
freshmen turned themselves in and were
fined 70 cents apiece to pay for damage to
Quad flower beds. The freshman who had
forged the letter also turned himself in.
And so when you step out on the Quad
on the remaining nights of the full moon
(April 25 and May 25) we urge you to
beware of crazed freshmen bearing
balloons and driving electric carts.

stricter 10 p.m. curfew be imposed on
Wilbur freshmen for a month. Steil was
running for LASSU representative from
Wilbur Hall, and the letter was apparently
forged by an over-zealous opponent. Some
Stanford traditions never change.
Another column that day was written
by the head sponsor at Wilbur. He
defended the freshman program but issued
a warning: "To the Stanford freshmen we
say this: Most of you are presently

experiencing more personal freedom than
you have had at any previous time...
personal freedom implicitly requires
personal responsibility."
By the following Monday, things had
begun to calm down. The opinions page
contained an apology written by the
Wilbur house officers for the entire
freshman class. Another letter charged that
the incident had been blown out of
proportion. The writer sympathized with
the freshmen, since "it is common
knowledge that this first midterm is quite a
traumatic experience."
The "full moon incident" finally came
to a resolution several days later when 76
freshmen turned themselves in and were
fined 70 cents apiece to pay for damage to
Quad flower beds. The freshman who had
forged the letter also turned himself in.
And so when you step out on the Quad
on the remaining nights of the full moon
(April 25 and May 25) we urge you to
beware of crazed freshmen bearing
balloons and driving electric carts.


An alumnus once told me that a Stanford
female did not become a bona fide
Stanford woman until she was kissed by a
Stanford man under a full moon in the
middle of Memorial Court (or is it the
middle of the Quad?) or something like
that. What are the exact stipulations?
There're only a couple of full moons left
this quarter and I want to be ready to do
the job right. —J.C.
The tradition you describe is officially
known as "the making of a Stanford
Woman" and is described in the Daily
(Sept. 25, 1964) in this way:
"No Stanford undergraduate woman is
considered a true Stanford Woman until
she has been kissed by a Stanford senior, at
twelve midnight, under a full moon, in the
middle of the Quad."
Apparently, this was once an old and
hallowed tradition on nights of the full
moon. Seniors and their girlfriends would
gather at the middle of the Quad in what
was called Senior Circle. Crowds of
freshmen would also turn out for the
event, armed with water balloons. At the
stroke of midnight there would be much
kissing and balloon throwing, and countless
wet but happy coeds would leave the
Circle, secure in the knowledge that they
were women at last.
One October night in 1961 the tradition
got a little out of hand, and the ensuing
uproar occupied the Daily's editorial pages
for over a week. The controversy began
when an irate senior named Bill Griffin
wrote a lengthy, vituperous column
describing what he called "one of the most
appalling acts of pure crudeness and
stupidity that I have encountered since
coming to Stanford." The whole thing
began, according to Griffin, when almost
250 freshmen showed up at the Quad,
armed with not only balloons but with
buckets, hoses and wastebaskets. It was the
day of the first midterm (in then-required
and despised Western Civ) and the
freshmen were out for blood.

Screaming obscenities, they surrounded
the Circle, trying to snatch fledgling
women from their dates, and running down
those who tried to escape with bicycles and
electric carts. A "German couple,"
attracted by the noise, was attacked by this
"pack of animals" who grabbed the girl,
shouting "Rape her! Rape her!" before she
panicked and ran. They finally trapped her
in the bushes, but proceeded to do little
more than throw water on her before she
was rescued by her date and Griffin, the
hero of the story.
Griffin ended his column with a
suggestion for an 11 p.m. curfew for
freshmen and more stringent discipline by
their sponsors.
The response was immediate. The next
day, two freshmen wrote to ask whether
Griffin was affiliated with the Stanford
Morality League. Others suggested that the
ceremony be henceforth held on the 18th
green of the golf course or inside the
church so that it would achieve a "far
deeper significance." Another suggestion
was that the freshmen be allowed to
immediately pledge into fraternities.
According to the writer of the letter, this
would siphon off the "wild" freshmen and
allow the others to join those houses where
"the great majority of campus leaders"
were produced.
On the next day, both the front page
and the opinions page were filled with the
story. " 'Full Moon Incident' Aired at
Legislature" screamed the front page
headline in inch-high type. A story, written
by Editor Jerry Rankin, reported the
student legislature's demand that the
freshmen men involved turn themselves
into the Freshman Men's Judicial Council,
in compliance with the Fundamental
Standard. The legislature also adopted a
motion expressing its confidence in the
judgment and maturity of the freshman
class, and its disappointment in the
behavior of those freshmen involved in
"the ruckus."

On the edit page, the response was
overwhelmingly negative. One student
suggested that the Fundamental Standard
be changed to the "FUN-AMENTAL
Standard" since that was undoubtedly the
disgraceful direction in which the
University was heading. The Inter-Club
Council and Inter-Fraternity Council sent a
joint letter, declaring that the University
had suffered "moral injury" at the hands
of the scurrilous freshmen.

was that the freshmen be allowed to
immediately pledge into fraternities.
According to the writer of the letter, this
would siphon off the "wild" freshmen and
allow the others to join those houses where
"the great majority of campus leaders"
were produced.
On the next day, both the front page
and the opinions page were filled with the
story. " 'Full Moon Incident' Aired at
Legislature" screamed the front page
headline in inch-high type. A story, written
by Editor Jerry Rankin, reported the
student legislature's demand that the
freshmen men involved turn themselves
into the Freshman Men's Judicial Council,
in compliance with the Fundamental
Standard. The legislature also adopted a
motion expressing its confidence in the
judgment and maturity of the freshman
class, and its disappointment in the
behavior of those freshmen involved in
"the ruckus."

On the edit page, the response was
overwhelmingly negative. One student
suggested that the Fundamental Standard
be changed to the "FUN-AMENTAL
Standard" since that was undoubtedly the
disgraceful direction in which the
University was heading. The Inter-Club
Council and Inter-Fraternity Council sent a
joint letter, declaring that the University
had suffered "moral injury" at the hands
of the scurrilous freshmen.
And finally, in what was to become the
second scandal of the week, a freshman
named Pete Steil suggested that an even
stricter 10 p.m. curfew be imposed on
Wilbur freshmen for a month. Steil was
running for LASSU representative from
Wilbur Hall, and the letter was apparently
forged by an over-zealous opponent. Some
Stanford traditions never change.
Another column that day was written
by the head sponsor at Wilbur. He
defended the freshman program but issued
a warning: "To the Stanford freshmen we
say this: Most of you are presently

experiencing more personal freedom than
you have had at any previous time...
personal freedom implicitly requires
personal responsibility."
By the following Monday, things had
begun to calm down. The opinions page
contained an apology written by the
Wilbur house officers for the entire
freshman class. Another letter charged that
the incident had been blown out of
proportion. The writer sympathized with
the freshmen, since "it is common
knowledge that this first midterm is quite a
traumatic experience."
The "full moon incident" finally came
to a resolution several days later when 76
freshmen turned themselves in and were
fined 70 cents apiece to pay for damage to
Quad flower beds. The freshman who had
forged the letter also turned himself in.
And so when you step out on the Quad
on the remaining nights of the full moon
(April 25 and May 25) we urge you to
beware of crazed freshmen bearing
balloons and driving electric carts.


An alumnus once told me that a Stanford
female did not become a bona fide
Stanford woman until she was kissed by a
Stanford man under a full moon in the
middle of Memorial Court (or is it the
middle of the Quad?) or something like
that. What are the exact stipulations?
There're only a couple of full moons left
this quarter and I want to be ready to do
the job right. —J.C.
The tradition you describe is officially
known as "the making of a Stanford
Woman" and is described in the Daily
(Sept. 25, 1964) in this way:
"No Stanford undergraduate woman is
considered a true Stanford Woman until
she has been kissed by a Stanford senior, at
twelve midnight, under a full moon, in the
middle of the Quad."
Apparently, this was once an old and
hallowed tradition on nights of the full
moon. Seniors and their girlfriends would
gather at the middle of the Quad in what
was called Senior Circle. Crowds of
freshmen would also turn out for the
event, armed with water balloons. At the
stroke of midnight there would be much
kissing and balloon throwing, and countless
wet but happy coeds would leave the
Circle, secure in the knowledge that they
were women at last.
One October night in 1961 the tradition
got a little out of hand, and the ensuing
uproar occupied the Daily's editorial pages
for over a week. The controversy began
when an irate senior named Bill Griffin
wrote a lengthy, vituperous column
describing what he called "one of the most
appalling acts of pure crudeness and
stupidity that I have encountered since
coming to Stanford." The whole thing
began, according to Griffin, when almost
250 freshmen showed up at the Quad,
armed with not only balloons but with
buckets, hoses and wastebaskets. It was the
day of the first midterm (in then-required
and despised Western Civ) and the
freshmen were out for blood.

Screaming obscenities, they surrounded
the Circle, trying to snatch fledgling
women from their dates, and running down
those who tried to escape with bicycles and
electric carts. A "German couple,"
attracted by the noise, was attacked by this
"pack of animals" who grabbed the girl,
shouting "Rape her! Rape her!" before she
panicked and ran. They finally trapped her
in the bushes, but proceeded to do little
more than throw water on her before she
was rescued by her date and Griffin, the
hero of the story.
Griffin ended his column with a
suggestion for an 11 p.m. curfew for
freshmen and more stringent discipline by
their sponsors.
The response was immediate. The next
day, two freshmen wrote to ask whether
Griffin was affiliated with the Stanford
Morality League. Others suggested that the
ceremony be henceforth held on the 18th
green of the golf course or inside the
church so that it would achieve a "far
deeper significance." Another suggestion
was that the freshmen be allowed to
immediately pledge into fraternities.

would siphon off the "wild" freshmen and
