# Berk Blasts Hospital Election Procedure

United Stanford Employees (USE)
union President Jim Berk said
yesterday he is absolutely certain that
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) will declare last weekend's
Stanford Hospital union
representational elections invalid.
Berk repeated his charge that
Hospital employees convinced voters
to oppose USE and other unions by
publishing false propaganda.
"I know that people were
frightened and intimidated," Berk
said.
But John Schwartz, legal counsel
for the Hospital, again called the
union's charges false. He noted that
while the union accuses the Hospital
of "restraining and coercing"
employees, it charges no
misstatements of facts by the Hospital.

unionization in the election, workers
clearly don't want to be represented
by the union.
"We are most pleased about the
large 85 percent turnout and the large
margin by which unionization was
rejected," Schwartz said.
Berk, however, insisted that the
Hospital had made enough
misstatements of fact to influence the
election's outcome although he
pointed out that many of the alleged
misstatements are not legally
chargeable as lies and thus were not
mentioned in unfair labor practices

represent employees, would have the
