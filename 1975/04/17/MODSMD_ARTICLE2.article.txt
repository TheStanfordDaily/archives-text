# Berk Blasts Hospital Election Procedure
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union President Jim Berk said
yesterday he is absolutely certain that
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) will declare last weekend's
Stanford Hospital union
representational elections invalid.
Berk repeated his charge that
Hospital employees convinced voters
to oppose USE and other unions by
publishing false propaganda.
"I know that people were
frightened and intimidated," Berk
said.
But John Schwartz, legal counsel
for the Hospital, again called the
union's charges false. He noted that
while the union accuses the Hospital
of "restraining and coercing"
employees, it charges no
misstatements of facts by the Hospital.
Schwartz claimed that since 80
percent of eligible voters opposed

unionization in the election, workers
clearly don't want to be represented
by the union.
"We are most pleased about the
large 85 percent turnout and the large
margin by which unionization was
rejected," Schwartz said.
Berk, however, insisted that the
Hospital had made enough
misstatements of fact to influence the
election's outcome although he
pointed out that many of the alleged
misstatements are not legally
chargeable as lies and thus were not
mentioned in unfair labor practices
charges sent to the NLRB.
Berk said that one of the worst
falsehoods circulated by the Hospital
was that the union, if allowed to
represent employees, would have the
power to fire workers.
In a letter sent to Hospital
employees on March 20, Hospital
Director Paul Hofmann stated "the
USE union is right now demanding
that a Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center employee [ Homer James] — be
discharged for non-payment of 34
cents."
Berk insisted that the union never
tried to fire James or any other
employee.
"We don't fire people," Berk said.
"Our job is to keep people from
getting fired."
Berk explained that when James
refused to pay 34 cents of his union
dues for January, the union, in
accordance with legal procedure,
informed the Hospital administration
of his failure to pay dues.
"We've never gone for his [Jones'l
ass," Berk said.
Illegally Dominated
Berk also claimed that the Hospital
illegally used the Black Advisory
Commiteee (BAC) and the Aliaza
Latina to indoctrinate workers against
the union.
According to Berk, the two
organizations told workers that USE is
racist and tried to convince workers
that unionization would be
detrimental to their general well-being.
Berk claimed that the BAC and
Alianza Latina are illegally dominated
by the Hospital administration.
But Schwartz insisted that both
organizations are independent of the
administration's domination and
opposed unionization without any
prompting by Hospital officials.
Patient Care
Berk also charged that the Hospital
administration maligned the union by

claiming that the union had little
concern for patient care.
"We care about the patients more
than does the management," Berk
said. "For us, taking care of patients is
a livelihood and not a business."
Despite the charges filed by USE.
Schwartz predicted yesterday that in
light of the overwhelming rejection of
the unions by tne employees, the
current controversy will not create
divisiveness in the Hospital.
"There will always be a residual
difference of opinion," Schwartz said.
"But employees don't seem to be
polarized on the issue. Most of them
are obviously pleased with the
outcome of the election."

that a Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center employee [ Homer James] — be
discharged for non-payment of 34
cents."
Berk insisted that the union never
tried to fire James or any other
employee.
"We don't fire people," Berk said.
"Our job is to keep people from
getting fired."
Berk explained that when James
refused to pay 34 cents of his union
dues for January, the union, in
accordance with legal procedure,
informed the Hospital administration
of his failure to pay dues.
"We've never gone for his [Jones'l
ass," Berk said.
Illegally Dominated
Berk also claimed that the Hospital
illegally used the Black Advisory
Commiteee (BAC) and the Aliaza
Latina to indoctrinate workers against
the union.
According to Berk, the two
organizations told workers that USE is
racist and tried to convince workers
that unionization would be
detrimental to their general well-being.
Berk claimed that the BAC and
Alianza Latina are illegally dominated
by the Hospital administration.
But Schwartz insisted that both
organizations are independent of the
administration's domination and
opposed unionization without any
prompting by Hospital officials.
Patient Care
Berk also charged that the Hospital
administration maligned the union by

claiming that the union had little
concern for patient care.
"We care about the patients more
than does the management," Berk
said. "For us, taking care of patients is
a livelihood and not a business."
Despite the charges filed by USE.
Schwartz predicted yesterday that in
light of the overwhelming rejection of
the unions by tne employees, the
current controversy will not create
divisiveness in the Hospital.
"There will always be a residual
difference of opinion," Schwartz said.
"But employees don't seem to be
polarized on the issue. Most of them
are obviously pleased with the
outcome of the election."
United Stanford Employees (USE)
union President Jim Berk said
yesterday he is absolutely certain that
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) will declare last weekend's
Stanford Hospital union
representational elections invalid.
Berk repeated his charge that
Hospital employees convinced voters
to oppose USE and other unions by
publishing false propaganda.
"I know that people were
frightened and intimidated," Berk
said.
But John Schwartz, legal counsel
for the Hospital, again called the
union's charges false. He noted that
while the union accuses the Hospital
of "restraining and coercing"
employees, it charges no
misstatements of facts by the Hospital.
Schwartz claimed that since 80
percent of eligible voters opposed

unionization in the election, workers
clearly don't want to be represented
by the union.
"We are most pleased about the
large 85 percent turnout and the large
margin by which unionization was
rejected," Schwartz said.
Berk, however, insisted that the
Hospital had made enough
misstatements of fact to influence the
election's outcome although he
pointed out that many of the alleged
misstatements are not legally
chargeable as lies and thus were not
mentioned in unfair labor practices
charges sent to the NLRB.
Berk said that one of the worst
falsehoods circulated by the Hospital
was that the union, if allowed to
represent employees, would have the
power to fire workers.
In a letter sent to Hospital
employees on March 20, Hospital
Director Paul Hofmann stated "the
USE union is right now demanding
that a Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center employee [ Homer James] — be
discharged for non-payment of 34
cents."

tried to fire James or any other
employee.
