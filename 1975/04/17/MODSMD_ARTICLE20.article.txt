# Plan For Housing Instituted
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The institution of the
Guaranteed Housing Program
(GHP) has injected a new element
into the annual spring housing
draw.
Current freshmen are
guaranteed on-campus housing for
two of their remaining three years
under the GHP. They have been
required, however, to select one
of their undergraduate years for
which they will not be guaranteed
housing on campus — and indeed
will have great difficulty getting
it.
Most present sophomores and
juniors are not covered by the
GHP, and will face the same draw
uncertainty that all
undergraduates have faced in
recent years.
The only upperclassmen
currently assured of placement
somewhere in next year's housing
system are those unassigned at the
end of round two of the 197-1
draw.
This special priority holds
regardless of whether one later
was able to move back into
campus housing. The trauma one
had to go through to obtain a
mid-year space was felt to warrant
guaranteed placement for next
year, stated one Housing Office
official.
Freshmen who choose to take
their non-guaranteed year next
fall still may enter the housing
draw, although they will be placed
on a lower priority rank than
students in their guaranteed years
and upperclass students who are
not reserved space.
When the GHP becomes fully
operative, rooms still open after
all guarantees have been assigned
(first-year transfer students also
are assured of a spot) will be
distributed among those in their
non-guaranteed year. Also, as
foreign campuses are not
considered as part of the draw
system, one can obtain housing
there during his non-guaranteed
year.
Under the Guaranteed Housing
Plan, fraternities will continue
their rushing procedures, using the
same criteria for membership as
they have in the past.
However, each fraternity must
absorb its fair share of the
demand for undergraduate
housing. Consequently,
fraternities only will be able to
guarantee housing for two out of
three years, these years to be
decided by each fraternity.
It is possible to change one's i
guaranteed years by trading with
another person. A list of persons
wishing to switch will be kept by
the Housing Office.
Draw numbers may be picked
up starting April 12.
