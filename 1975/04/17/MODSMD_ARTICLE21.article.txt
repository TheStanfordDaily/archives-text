# A 						Bummer Summer
## Jobs Tough To Find 
### 
From The Associated Press
Finding a summer job will be
tougher than ever this year for
the millions of high school and
college students seeking extra
money from vacation
employment.
Government and private
analysts predict more than five
million persons between the ages
of 14 and 21 will be looking for
work this summer. No one knows
how many jobs will be available.
Estimates of the situation
range from "not particularly
good" to "real grim."
There are opportunities
available, but many of the jobs
have strings attached: would-be
employees need particular skills;
they must be willing to start work
early; they should be ready to
accept low-paying positions
performing manual labor.
The always-tight summer job
market has been further
constricted this year by the
problems of the economy.

High unemployment means
adult workers will be competing
with youngsters for many jobs; so
will retired people who need extra
income. At the same time,
inflation has boosted the cost of
education, meaning more students
will be trying to add to college
funds. And recession has caused
industry to cut back and get along
with fewer employees.
The New York City office of
the State Employment Service
found camp jobs for 150 to 200
youngsters last year. Asked how
many the agency would be able to
place this year, a spokesman said,
"I'd hate to guess."
The spokesman said many
camps have gone out of business
because of the recession, although
he was unable to give specifics.
The Colorado State
Employment Service said the
competition for resort and park
jobs has been increasing for the
past two years and 1975 is even

worse. Recruiters who usually
contact the office in February or
March have not called. Resort
operators don't know whether the
tourists will come this year.
Grim
"It's real grim," a spokesman
said.
Many placement officers are
advising students to settle for less
than they would have a few years
ago.
Figuring out how many
students will not be able to find
jobs this summer is impossible.
Anyone who is over 16, out of
work and looking for a job is
counted among the nation's
unemployed for the purpose of
computing Labor Department
statistics. These figures are
seasonally adjusted so that the
large number of youngsters
entering the., work force each
spring and dropping out again in
the fall won't distort the over-all
picture.
