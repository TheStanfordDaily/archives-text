# Prof Probes Extraterrestrial Life

"How do you know we haven't
already been discovered by some
form of extraterrestrial life?" an
audience member asked Electrical
Engineering Prof. Ronald N.
Bracewell in an overflowing
Tresidder Large Lounge Tuesday.
Bracewell peered at him over
the podium for several moments.
"For all I know,"he answered,
"You may be some form of
extraterrestrial life."
Bracewell, who has worked
with long wave propagation and
radio astronomy, addressed the
crowd on the subject of intelligent
life in outer space.
Though the existence of
extraterrestrial life has been
questioned since the classical era,
Bracewell noted that modern
scientific data has bridled free
speculation.
Because we know about its
temperature and chemistry, for
instance, "there is no longer any
reason to suppose that Venus is
inhabited by the Venusians," he
said, adding that "on the other
hand, people really aren't sure
about Mars."
And with 100 billion stars on
our galaxy, alone, Bracewell said,
many believe that the possibility
of life somewhere else is great.
Bracewell outlined two current
views on the subject. The
orthodox belief, he said, is held

by those people who reason that
with so much yet to be learned
about the Universe, "it would be
conceited to think that we are
unique."
According to what he called
the Columbus theory, he said that
we should expect to find the less
advanced forms of life ourselves
and wait for the more advanced to
come to us. For, as Bracewell said,
when Christopher Columbus
explored, he always found less
technologically advanced cultures.

"Had it been the other way
around," Bracewell claimed, "it
would have been the Indians who
discovered Portugal."
"So if there are more advanced
forms where are they?" he
questioned.
In answer, he said, one must
take into account that more
advanced life forms may have
immense interspacial distance or
the time spans to cover. These
factors may be detaining the visit
of other life to earth, he said.

He also suggested that earth *
peoples should attempt to meet
other forms of life halfway. As an
example, he cited the NASA plan
which he helped to complete !
three years ago. It consists of
giant radio transmitters that beam ;
signals, radio waves that might tell *
these life forms of our existence. -
According to Bracewell the *
unorthodox view holds that â€¢
human life is Nature's efficient *
way of colonizing and controlling
the galaxy.
