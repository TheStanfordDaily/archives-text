## Innovative Dance From Falco Company 
### CHRISTINE SHERRY 
A native New Yorker, Louis
Falco spent 10 years touring with
the Jose Limon Dance Company
and then formed his own
company in 1967; in more recent
years he has worked with groups
ranging from the Boston Ballet to
the Netherlands Dans Theatre,
with his latest achievement being
a season in New York with
Nureyev and Merle Park in The
Moor's Pa vane.
Falco's approach to dance is
one of innovativeness combined
with a clear aim to bring dance to
the people; the result is
performances and programs which
challenge the audience to respond
either positively or negatively and
which in turn may produce
further creative responses from
the artists.
Friday evening's performance
of the Falco Dance Company in
Memorial Auditorium was a
highly creative one, which elicited
an audience response that was
highly enthusiastic.
Huescape (1968) has involved
the work of prominent artist
William Katz, whose sets and
costumes were a beautiful
blending of bright orange, yellow
and red tones which immediately
created an atmosphere of light
and energy.
The action of the piece

reflected geometric patterns
which were almost
kaleidoscope-like in effect, yet the
movement quality itself always
remained loose, natural and
flowing.
Three dancers intertwined in
forms that were clear and
well-defined yet never static or
rigid; what was fascinating was
how Falco combined repetitive
sequences with highly innovative
and distinctive moves so that the
integrated whole never dragged or
became dull.
The Sleepers, a low-keyed but
hysterically funny piece which
was choreographed in 1971 on a
Guggenheim fellowship, was
clearly an audience favorite.
Opening with a lone trumpet
playing "Rock-a-Bye Baby," the
curtain rises on a group of seven
dancers lying in a heap center
stage, deep in slumber and
surrounded by piles of fluff and
down.
Juxtaposed Triangle
As the piece unfolds and the
group awakens, three relationships
are established: two juxtaposed
couples and a bland and idiotic
love triangle which meanders on
and off stage.
Anthony Ferro and Ranko
Yokovama as the first couple —
she halfway resisting involvement,
he teasingly persistent — are

individually brilliant and yet
perfectly well-matched; their
highly demanding movement
sequences are supported by their
very fast-paced and pithy
dialogue, which never lapses into
the cliched but remains
appropriate and typical.
Equally entertaining were the
bickering couple of Juan Antonio
and Georgiana Holmes, whose
biting repartee was nothing short
of genius.
Conversation
Where Falco's talent shone
through in this piece was in the
manner in which he literally
combined dance and conversation;
most choreographers in
attempting to include the spoken
word do so awkwardly or not
enough, so that the dancers speak,
then dance, then speak, or
swallow their words when the
movement becomes more
demanding.
Falco's dancers accomplished
the nearly impossible by
becoming at once actor and
dancer, neither role becoming
dominant and yet each role fully
sustained.
My personal favorite of the
evening was Caviar,
choreographed again on a
Guggenheim in 1970. For this
piece, Falco collaborated initially
with several filmmakers, a rock

group and the Chilean
artist-sculpturess Marisol; the
result is a piece both sarcastic and
warmiy funny.
Caviar is a genuine effort in
search of new ideas and materials
in an attempt to continue to
demand high technical quality in
dance while moving to make it
less decorative and more natural.
Most striking about Caviar are the
props; eight large white sturgeons
are carried on and off stage with
dead-pan sanctity.
While the piece revolves around
them, it is never tied to them, nor
are they overused artifically. The
dance borders on the ridiculous;
the music is a parody, the dancing
occasionally approaches the
frenetic, and the whole scene has
a kind of circus-like atmosphere.
But the dance remains just fun,
a lark; the entire company enjoys
a romp that combines excellent
partnering, a perfect sense of
space and timing, and above all, a
sense of cohesiveness—there are
no "leads" and the entire group
works together in a way that is as
refreshing as it is unusual.
Both as choreographer and
dancer, Falco is rare in his
concern to create new avenues in
dance that will at the same time
be accessible to the common
audience. His work is tied to no
particular technique; lately he has
experimented with laser beams,
infinity boxes (large mirror-like
sculptures) and innovative film
techniques in attempts to broaden
the dimensions of dance. Falco
works hard, and he seems in every
way to be succeeding.

sequences with highly innovative
and distinctive moves so that the
integrated whole never dragged or
became dull.
The Sleepers, a low-keyed but
hysterically funny piece which
was choreographed in 1971 on a
Guggenheim fellowship, was
clearly an audience favorite.
Opening with a lone trumpet
playing "Rock-a-Bye Baby," the
curtain rises on a group of seven
dancers lying in a heap center
stage, deep in slumber and
surrounded by piles of fluff and
down.
Juxtaposed Triangle
As the piece unfolds and the
group awakens, three relationships
are established: two juxtaposed
couples and a bland and idiotic
love triangle which meanders on
and off stage.
Anthony Ferro and Ranko
Yokovama as the first couple —
she halfway resisting involvement,
he teasingly persistent — are

individually brilliant and yet
perfectly well-matched; their
highly demanding movement
sequences are supported by their
very fast-paced and pithy
dialogue, which never lapses into
the cliched but remains
appropriate and typical.
Equally entertaining were the
bickering couple of Juan Antonio
and Georgiana Holmes, whose
biting repartee was nothing short
of genius.
Conversation
Where Falco's talent shone
through in this piece was in the
manner in which he literally
combined dance and conversation;
most choreographers in
attempting to include the spoken
word do so awkwardly or not
enough, so that the dancers speak,
then dance, then speak, or
swallow their words when the
movement becomes more
demanding.
Falco's dancers accomplished
the nearly impossible by
becoming at once actor and
dancer, neither role becoming
dominant and yet each role fully
sustained.
My personal favorite of the
evening was Caviar,
choreographed again on a
Guggenheim in 1970. For this
piece, Falco collaborated initially
with several filmmakers, a rock

group and the Chilean
artist-sculpturess Marisol; the
result is a piece both sarcastic and
warmiy funny.
Caviar is a genuine effort in
search of new ideas and materials
in an attempt to continue to
demand high technical quality in
dance while moving to make it
less decorative and more natural.
Most striking about Caviar are the
props; eight large white sturgeons
are carried on and off stage with
dead-pan sanctity.
While the piece revolves around
them, it is never tied to them, nor
are they overused artifically. The
dance borders on the ridiculous;
the music is a parody, the dancing
occasionally approaches the
frenetic, and the whole scene has
a kind of circus-like atmosphere.
But the dance remains just fun,
a lark; the entire company enjoys
a romp that combines excellent
partnering, a perfect sense of
space and timing, and above all, a
sense of cohesiveness—there are
no "leads" and the entire group
works together in a way that is as
refreshing as it is unusual.
Both as choreographer and
dancer, Falco is rare in his
concern to create new avenues in
dance that will at the same time
be accessible to the common
audience. His work is tied to no
particular technique; lately he has
experimented with laser beams,
infinity boxes (large mirror-like
sculptures) and innovative film
techniques in attempts to broaden
the dimensions of dance. Falco
works hard, and he seems in every
way to be succeeding.

THE LAST THEATER SHOW—Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's "The Threepenny Opera," the latest (and
last) addition to the ACT's current repertory season, is now in performance at the Geary Theatre in San
Francisco. Pictured above are Anthony Teague as Mack the Knife and Elizabeth Huddle as a former lover
of Mack.
A native New Yorker, Louis
Falco spent 10 years touring with
the Jose Limon Dance Company
and then formed his own
company in 1967; in more recent
years he has worked with groups
ranging from the Boston Ballet to
the Netherlands Dans Theatre,
with his latest achievement being
a season in New York with
Nureyev and Merle Park in The
Moor's Pa vane.
Falco's approach to dance is
one of innovativeness combined
with a clear aim to bring dance to
the people; the result is
performances and programs which
challenge the audience to respond
either positively or negatively and
which in turn may produce
further creative responses from
the artists.
Friday evening's performance
of the Falco Dance Company in
Memorial Auditorium was a
highly creative one, which elicited
an audience response that was
highly enthusiastic.
Huescape (1968) has involved
the work of prominent artist
William Katz, whose sets and
costumes were a beautiful
blending of bright orange, yellow
and red tones which immediately
created an atmosphere of light
and energy.
The action of the piece

reflected geometric patterns
which were almost
kaleidoscope-like in effect, yet the
movement quality itself always
remained loose, natural and
flowing.
Three dancers intertwined in
forms that were clear and
well-defined yet never static or
rigid; what was fascinating was
how Falco combined repetitive
sequences with highly innovative
and distinctive moves so that the
integrated whole never dragged or

enough, so that the dancers speak,
then dance, then speak, or
swallow their words when the
movement becomes more
demanding.
Falco's dancers accomplished
the nearly impossible by
becoming at once actor and
dancer, neither role becoming
dominant and yet each role fully
sustained.
My personal favorite of the
evening was Caviar,
choreographed again on a
Guggenheim in 1970. For this
piece, Falco collaborated initially
with several filmmakers, a rock

group and the Chilean
artist-sculpturess Marisol; the
result is a piece both sarcastic and
warmiy funny.
Caviar is a genuine effort in
search of new ideas and materials
in an attempt to continue to
demand high technical quality in
dance while moving to make it
less decorative and more natural.
Most striking about Caviar are the
props; eight large white sturgeons
are carried on and off stage with
dead-pan sanctity.
While the piece revolves around
them, it is never tied to them, nor
are they overused artifically. The
dance borders on the ridiculous;
the music is a parody, the dancing
occasionally approaches the
frenetic, and the whole scene has
a kind of circus-like atmosphere.
But the dance remains just fun,
a lark; the entire company enjoys
a romp that combines excellent
partnering, a perfect sense of
space and timing, and above all, a
sense of cohesiveness—there are
no "leads" and the entire group
works together in a way that is as
refreshing as it is unusual.
Both as choreographer and
dancer, Falco is rare in his
concern to create new avenues in
dance that will at the same time
be accessible to the common
audience. His work is tied to no
particular technique; lately he has
experimented with laser beams,
infinity boxes (large mirror-like
sculptures) and innovative film
techniques in attempts to broaden
the dimensions of dance. Falco
works hard, and he seems in every
way to be succeeding.

THE LAST THEATER SHOW—Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's "The Threepenny Opera," the latest (and
last) addition to the ACT's current repertory season, is now in performance at the Geary Theatre in San
Francisco. Pictured above are Anthony Teague as Mack the Knife and Elizabeth Huddle as a former lover
of Mack.
A native New Yorker, Louis
Falco spent 10 years touring with
the Jose Limon Dance Company
and then formed his own
company in 1967; in more recent
years he has worked with groups
ranging from the Boston Ballet to
the Netherlands Dans Theatre,
with his latest achievement being
a season in New York with
Nureyev and Merle Park in The
Moor's Pa vane.
Falco's approach to dance is
one of innovativeness combined
with a clear aim to bring dance to
the people; the result is
performances and programs which
challenge the audience to respond
either positively or negatively and
which in turn may produce
further creative responses from
the artists.
Friday evening's performance
of the Falco Dance Company in
Memorial Auditorium was a
highly creative one, which elicited
an audience response that was
highly enthusiastic.
Huescape (1968) has involved
the work of prominent artist
William Katz, whose sets and
costumes were a beautiful
blending of bright orange, yellow
and red tones which immediately
created an atmosphere of light
and energy.
The action of the piece

reflected geometric patterns
which were almost
kaleidoscope-like in effect, yet the
movement quality itself always
remained loose, natural and
flowing.
Three dancers intertwined in
forms that were clear and
well-defined yet never static or
rigid; what was fascinating was
how Falco combined repetitive
sequences with highly innovative
and distinctive moves so that the
integrated whole never dragged or
became dull.
The Sleepers, a low-keyed but
hysterically funny piece which
was choreographed in 1971 on a
Guggenheim fellowship, was
clearly an audience favorite.
Opening with a lone trumpet
playing "Rock-a-Bye Baby," the
curtain rises on a group of seven
dancers lying in a heap center
stage, deep in slumber and
surrounded by piles of fluff and
down.
Juxtaposed Triangle
As the piece unfolds and the
group awakens, three relationships
are established: two juxtaposed
couples and a bland and idiotic
love triangle which meanders on
and off stage.
Anthony Ferro and Ranko
Yokovama as the first couple —
she halfway resisting involvement,
he teasingly persistent — are

individually brilliant and yet
perfectly well-matched; their
highly demanding movement
sequences are supported by their
very fast-paced and pithy
dialogue, which never lapses into
the cliched but remains
appropriate and typical.
Equally entertaining were the
bickering couple of Juan Antonio
and Georgiana Holmes, whose
biting repartee was nothing short
of genius.
Conversation
Where Falco's talent shone
through in this piece was in the
manner in which he literally
combined dance and conversation;
most choreographers in
attempting to include the spoken
word do so awkwardly or not
enough, so that the dancers speak,
then dance, then speak, or
swallow their words when the
movement becomes more
demanding.
