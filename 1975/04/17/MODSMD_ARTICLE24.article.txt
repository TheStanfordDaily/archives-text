# White Band Merely Average

### JOAN E. HINMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO—It was
either poor planning, rampant
neglect, or just plain fate that
made Bill Graham's elves slip
on a videotape of a Marin band
called Soundhole after Etta
James' excellent blues set at
Winterland Friday night.
Similar sinister forces
compelled the same elves to shut
off the tape right after Soundhole
had finished a stirring version of
The Isleys' "Work To Do."
But it was the Average White
Band's own stupidity to walk out
on stage and perform their own
version of "Work To Do" and not
sound as good as Soundhole had
three minutes earlier.

Average White Band rose to
fame primarily on the wings of
the single "Pick Up The Pieces"
and publicity surrounding the
death of drummer Robbie
Mcintosh last year. Mcintosh died
after mistakenly snorting heroine
rather than cocaine at a party
thrown by Ken Moss, former
president of defunct Freelandia
Airlines.
AWB's bassist Alan Gorrie was
spared a similar fate by Cher, who
walked Gorrie around for the rest
of the night to keep him from
taking a permanent nap.
Drug publicity aside, a largely
black crowd wanted to see what
AWB could do in concert Friday,
and while they did put out some
purely average boogie music,
AWB's self-description (i.e.
average, white) says it all.
What AWB plays is really San
Francisco funk, and for Scots to
play San Francisco funk is
certainly admirable — unless they
try it in San Francisco, and unless
they really still sound like Scots
playing music that isn't in their
blood.
White bands that play

essentially black music aren't new,
Tower of Power and Cold Blood
being the eminent local
examples. AWB, as its name ,
implies, wants to convince the
public that what it plays is
typical, which it certainly is. But
in truth, if all band personnel were
black the set it played Friday
would have been more easily
identifiable as gutless.
The particular guts-in-absence
were studio ringers such as Randy
and Michael Brecker and other
additional brassmen that gave
AWB's albums their bite. Roger
Ball's and Malcolm Duncan's
saxophones alone couldn't
provide enough punch to get past ,
the rest of the music, and were
inaudible through much of the
hall.
AWB's vocal talent is confusing
and uneven. Split between bassist
Gorrie and lead guitarist Hamish
Stuart, the talent is clear but its
application is questionable. Unlike
Rod Stewart or Joe Cocker,
Britishers who have mastered
American blues inflections, Gorrie
and Stuart never stop sounding
Scottish.

The result in Stuart's case is an
image of a man walking to center
stage during a production of
Brigadoon and bursting into the
chorus of "Papa's Got A Brand
New Bag."
In no way trying to be a
superior lead guitarist, Stuart
handled fairly basic funk riffs
through songs such as "Person to
Person," "You Got It,"and
"T.L.C." trading off occasionally
with rhythm guitarist Onnie
Mclntyre. His guitar work was by
far the least offensive part of
Stuart's performance.
Strangely, "Pick Up The
Pieces" proved to be the climax
and disappointment of the set. It
was, after all, what everyone on
the main floor was waiting for,
but after the initial rush of
recognition the tune droned on
forever. AWB exhorted the crowd
to clap and shout the four-word
lyrics, but the excitement it
tried to incite never arrived.
At least a third of the black
Winterland crowd hit the night air
before AWB started its encore,
a tired version of "I Heard It
Through The Grapevine" that sent
more people packing.

A WHITE, AVERAGE BAND—The Scottish rhythm and blues group
known (accurately enough) as the Average White Band performed last
weekend at Winterland. According to reviewer Joan E. Hinman, the
band's boogie lacked bite.
