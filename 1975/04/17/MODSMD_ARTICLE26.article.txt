# Best Of The Bay
## 
### 
After much thought (and after the
editor put a gun to our head) we decided
to change the name of the column. It
was a tough choice. There were so many
good nominations, like "DOBBINS'
SCRAPBOOK." However, "Best of the
Bay" is our new name. If you can think
of something better (and something
clean), we're open to other suggestions.
In fact, we're starting a contest. For
the next few weeks, we'd like you to
send us nominations for what this
column should be called. We'll even
print the name of the winner in bold
type. (But please submit suggestions
anyway!)
This week, to go along with the new
name, we have several unique and
worthwhile activities — many of them on
campus.
In keeping with tradition, this week's
"best bet" is a sporting event — tennis.
On Friday, Stanford plays UCLA
(ranked second nationally) and on
Saturday, USC (ranked fourth) in
Maples Pavilion. Hurry to get your
tickets. Also, on Sunday the baseball
team plays UC-Berkeley at Sunken
Diamond.
Don't miss the John Steinbeck
memorabilia collection (featuring letters
and all kinds of items) at the Main
Library's Bender Room. One rumor has
it that Steinbeck, who attended
Stanford, was in fact expelled because he
campaigned for women's rights to have
abortions. Certainly a look at these items
may help confirm or deny this story.
If you prefer "live" activities, don't
despair. The Office of Public Events is
sponsoring several cultural events this
week. Tonight, New York's City Center
Acting Company performs in Memorial
Auditorium.
The three year old company grew out
of the Drama division of the Julliard
School and its artistic director and
"guiding spirit" is John Houseman
(Kingsfield, from the Paper Chase). The
group's repertoire includes both classic
and modern drama.
On Friday, the Early Music Quartet
performs in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
group plays "music both sacred and
secular, folk songs, and art songs" from
Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Holland
and Britain, according to a press release.
The release also says that the quartet has
"proved that 13th, 14th and 15th
century music . . . can be a lot of fun."

The Stanford Drama department
sponsors Subject To Fits based on
Dostoyevski's novel, "The Idiot", next
Tuesday through Friday at the Nitery.
Director Michale Bloom believes the
play "evokes a delicate balance between
dream and reality." The play, written by
Robert Montgomery, was nominated for
a Pulitzer Prize in 1971 and the Stanford
production merits your attendance.
If you prefer acting without words,
the ASSU Special Events grants your
request on Tuesday evening by
presenting the San Francisco Mime
Troupe in San Fran Scandals in
Dinkelspiel. According to a press release,
the troupe, in this production, "uses
vaudeville, an old-fashioned style, to
attack urban renewal, a space-age
target." Ihe company, as it has
proven here in the past, puts on a funny,
teresting and thought provoking show.
In the area of movies, don't miss the
ASSU Sunday Flicks' presentation of
The Great Gatsby. It stars Redford and
Farrow (Newman, are you listening?)
and the photography is excellent even if
the acting isn't.
In the Palo Alto Area, Lenny, starring
Dustin Hoffman, is at the Altos, and
Hearts and Minds (dedicated to Sinatra,
Hope and the Motion Picture Academy)
and Godfather II are at the Aquarius.
If you have a car, let us advise you
that Van Morrison ("Wild Night,"
"Tupelo Honey" and "Domino") will be
at the Great American Music Hall this
weekend and Johnny Mathis ("Misty")
will be at the Circle Star Theater. If you
can stand him (that seems to be the
correct term), female impersonator Jim
Bailey appears Saturday and Sunday at
the Masonic Auditorium. And Daniel
Ellsberg will speak tonight at Gunn High
School in Palo Alto.
Finally, if you are really in need of
something to do, watch Voyage to the
End of the Universe on Creature
Features this Saturday. It stars Otto
Lack, which is what the producer said
when he finished: "I'm otto lack"
(luck?)" Apparently, so is this critic.

(Entertainment Editor's Note: In a
possible attempt to dear his image as a
sexist, the "Best of the Bay" chronicler
neglected to mention that author
Norman Mailer will be speaking at
Berkeley tonight.)
