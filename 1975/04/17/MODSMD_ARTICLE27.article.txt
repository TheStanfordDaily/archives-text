Murder Weapon Possibly SLA Gun
SACRAMENTO — Five bullets fired into the body of
Oakland schools chief Marcus Foster apparently came from
the same brand of pistol found on Joseph Remiro, a police
specialist said yesterday.
John Davis, the Oakland Police Department's senior
criminalist, testified he thought the slugs were fired from a
,380-caliber Walther automatic — the same type and brand
of weapon found on Remiro when he was arrested Jan. 10,
1974.
Remiro, 28, and another Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) "soldier," Russell Little, 25, are charged with killing
Foster with cyanide-filled bullets and wounding his deputy,
Robert Blackburn, on Nov. 6, 1973.
Davis said he also thought that a sixth bullet that hit
Foster came from a .38-caliber Rossi - the type of revolver
found with the body of Nancy Ling Perry, an SLA member
who died in a shootout with Los Angeles police last May.
He said he made his conclusions after examining
markings on the bullets and comparing them with bullets
fired from those brands of pistols.
Davis was not asked if he made ballistics comparisons of
the slugs but did admit the slugs could have been fired by a
brand with which he was not familiar.
"After considering the possibilities I came to one that
was most possible and most likely," Davis said, adding he
"did not exclude the possibility that it was from some
other kind of weapon that I did not know about."
Ford: Aid Will Stabilize South Vietnam
WASHINGTON — President Ford said yesterday he was
"absolutely convinced" that South Vietnam could stabilize
its defenses — pointing the way to a negotiated settlement
with Hanoi — if Congress approves his request for $722
million in military aid.
While confirming that he has ordered the evacuation of
all "non-essential" Americans, Ford said the Thieu
government "could stabilize the military situation in South
Vietnam today" if Congress votes the funds within the next
few days.
At the same time, Ford told a news conference that
"this whole tragedy" now facing Saigon "could have been
eliminated" if the United States fulfilled its commitment
under the 1973 Paris cease-fire accords to a "reasonable
sum" of military and economic assistance.
Describing North Vietnam's punishing assault as a
"tragic situation," Ford told a panel of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors: "It just makes me sick every
minute and even' day I hear and read about it and see it."
Final Arguments In Connally Case
WASHINGTON — Lawyers for the government and
defense argued over the believabilitv of key witness Jake
Jacobsen yesterday as they presented final arguments in the
bribery trial of former Secretary of the Treasury John
Connally.
To convict Connally on charges that he accepted two
illegal $5000 payoffs, the jury would have to believe that
he "betrayed his trust and bargained away his honor to
Jacobsen," said defense lawyer Edward Bennett Williams.
Chief prosecutor Frank Tuerkheimer said Jacobsen's
testimony had been corroborated by circumstantial
evidence even though there were no witnesses to the alleged
$10,000 payment in 1971.
"Illegal payments when made to public officials, do not
occur in the presence of third parties, or cameras or where
there are reporters present," said Tuerkheimer.
The case is to go to the jury of five men and seven
women today after final instructions from the judge.

Blaek Panther Leader Loses Eleetion
OAKLAND — An "administrative recount" was under
way in Oakland yesterday after Black Panther Party leader
Elaine Brown flunked her second try for a seat on the
Oakland City Council.
In Berkeley, moderates edged candidates of the political
left Tuesday in the race for control of Berkeley's city
government and narrowly reelected Mayor Warren Widener.
Brown, who ran with heavy local Democratic support,
polled 24,083 votes to District 1 incumbent Raymond
Eng's 30,100. Her backers claimed errors in the tally and
log sheets and asked a recount.
She campaigned as a poor person and a Democrat and
not as a Black Panther member. It was her second failure to
gain the Council. Her campaign was heavily financed, an
aide said, reporting that it ran to about $60,000.
Eleetrie Power Shortage May Oeeur
WASHINGTON — On top of its natural gas shortage and
foreign oil dependency, the United States may face
shortages of electric power within five years, Federal
Energy Administrator Frank Zarb said yesterday.
Unless the nation moves quickly to speed up power
plant construction. Zarb said, shortages of generating
capacity may develop by 1980 or 1981 which "can induce
slackened economic activity because of a lack of power,
particularly in some areas of the country."
Zarb mentioned the danger in a question session at a
meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors
(ASNE), then said in an interview that a situation could
develop "where power would have to be rationed to certain
industrial users to keep the local population living."
Cease-Fire Reaehed In Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Premier Rashid Solh announced a
cease-fire yesterday in the street battles that for four days
pitted Lebanese rightists against Palestinian guerrillas and
terrorized this Arab capital. The unofficial death toll ran to
more than 125.
Scattered shooting and bazooka explosions continued
after the cease-fire announcement and into the night. The
conflict stemmed in part from right-wing contentions that
the guerrillas spark Israeli reprisal raids into Lebanon.
In addition to the lighting between the rightist
Phalangists and Palestinians, other armed factions among
the widely armed Lebanese population joined the fighting.
