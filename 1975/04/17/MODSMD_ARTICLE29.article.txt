# Dismissed St. Ann's Chaplain Stresses Third World Issues
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
Former Stanford Assoc. Chaplain
Miriam Cherry, whose "prophetic
ministry" left the campus last month
when she was fired by St. Ann's
Catholic Church in Palo Alto, returned
briefly yesterday to speak to a small
gathering in Memorial Church.
Cherry, known for her work with
"oppressed peoples" and for her
support of the Black Panther Party,
said that she has been continuing in
her activist role despite her firing. She
said that she has been offered support
by various Bay Area community
organizations, including a
hospital-workers' union local.
Cherry told her listeners that St.
Ann's Church Council fired her mainly
because of her "revolutionary" ideas,
despite remarks made by Council
members to the contrary. Her activism
has been aimed toward the "liberation
of oppressed peoples," including
blacks, chicanos, and her own people,
the Native Americans.
"So my firing is a firing of the
movement, or an attempt to do that,"
she added.
'Prophetic Ministry'
Cherry came to St. Ann's five years
ago, and was given the chaplaincy at
Stanford when the need for a Catholic
ministry here was recognized by the
Palo Alto Catholic community. While
in her full-time position at Stanford,
she worked with minority groups on
campus, and became involved with
labor movements, women's issues, and
the antiwar movement. She called her
work a "prophetic ministry."
She first began to have difficulties
at St. Ann's in 1971 when she sold

Black Panther newspapers in front of
the Church.
"1 feel St. Ann's has been
somewhat paralyzed by the firing,"
she told the gathering of about 20
people.
Saying that there is "unity in
struggle," Cherry said her main
concern was that all oppressed groups
should band together and realize their
common goal. She also said that more
participation in "revolutionary"
activities is necessary, adding that
"there are a lot of people around the
edges who can step right in."
Influenced
She said that there is a great
potential for action in the Stanford
community, although she noted that
the University as an institution can
never be a vehicle to progress.
Cherry explained that she was
influenced early in her career as a nun
by St. Augustine and Teilhard de

Chardin, but that she eventually began
studying Lenin and Mao as well. Shi'
said that the turning point came while
she was at Arizona State University,
where she came into contact with the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) and the farmworkers'
movement. She sought out
revolutionary meaning in the
Scripture, she said, and came to the
conclusion that "Yahweh is on the
side of the oppressed .. . and in
liberating the oppressed he is liberating
the oppressor as well."
"There should be a stress on Third
World issues," Cherry said, when asked
what she felt the most pressing issue is
today. She pinpointed the case of Olga
Calimente, a farmworker's daughter
recently arrested in Argentina, and
suggested that the financial aids issue
which flared up last quarter should not
be allowed to die away.

the Native Americans.
"So my firing is a firing of the
movement, or an attempt to do that,"
she added.
'Prophetic Ministry'
Cherry came to St. Ann's five years
ago, and was given the chaplaincy at
Stanford when the need for a Catholic
ministry here was recognized by the
Palo Alto Catholic community. While
in her full-time position at Stanford,
she worked with minority groups on
campus, and became involved with
labor movements, women's issues, and
the antiwar movement. She called her
work a "prophetic ministry."
She first began to have difficulties
at St. Ann's in 1971 when she sold

Black Panther newspapers in front of
the Church.
"1 feel St. Ann's has been
somewhat paralyzed by the firing,"
she told the gathering of about 20
people.
Saying that there is "unity in
struggle," Cherry said her main
concern was that all oppressed groups
should band together and realize their
common goal. She also said that more
participation in "revolutionary"
activities is necessary, adding that
"there are a lot of people around the
edges who can step right in."
Influenced
She said that there is a great
potential for action in the Stanford
community, although she noted that
the University as an institution can
never be a vehicle to progress.
Cherry explained that she was
influenced early in her career as a nun
by St. Augustine and Teilhard de

Chardin, but that she eventually began
studying Lenin and Mao as well. Shi'
said that the turning point came while
she was at Arizona State University,
where she came into contact with the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) and the farmworkers'
movement. She sought out
revolutionary meaning in the
Scripture, she said, and came to the
conclusion that "Yahweh is on the
side of the oppressed .. . and in
liberating the oppressed he is liberating
the oppressor as well."
"There should be a stress on Third
World issues," Cherry said, when asked
what she felt the most pressing issue is
today. She pinpointed the case of Olga
Calimente, a farmworker's daughter
recently arrested in Argentina, and
suggested that the financial aids issue
which flared up last quarter should not
be allowed to die away.
Former Stanford Assoc. Chaplain
Miriam Cherry, whose "prophetic
ministry" left the campus last month
when she was fired by St. Ann's
Catholic Church in Palo Alto, returned
briefly yesterday to speak to a small
gathering in Memorial Church.
Cherry, known for her work with
"oppressed peoples" and for her
support of the Black Panther Party,
said that she has been continuing in
her activist role despite her firing. She
said that she has been offered support
by various Bay Area community
organizations, including a
hospital-workers' union local.
Cherry told her listeners that St.
Ann's Church Council fired her mainly
because of her "revolutionary" ideas,
despite remarks made by Council
members to the contrary. Her activism
has been aimed toward the "liberation
of oppressed peoples," including
blacks, chicanos, and her own people,
the Native Americans.
"So my firing is a firing of the
movement, or an attempt to do that,"
she added.
