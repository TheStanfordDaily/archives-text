# ASSU Election Draws Average Turnout, Late Campaign Tactics
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Nearly 1500 students voted
yesterday in the first day of balloting
for ASSU Council of Presidents, nine
fee assessments, three constitutional
amendments and officers for the class
of 1976.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald described it as an "average
day, especially considering the rain."
Last year, about 1300 people voted on
the first day, with another 1100 voting

the second day.
Polling places in today's final day
of balloting are the Quad, history
corner, the Graduate School of
Business, the physics tank and the
Medical School from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
and the post office and engineering
corner from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The initial day of voting did not
pass without controversy. Fitzgerald
said he had received some complaints
of campaigning within 100 feet of the
polls, but would not say which slate
was accused because he hadn't
approached it with the charge.
Leaflets
Also, an anonymous group
distributed thousands of leaflets urging
students to vote against the Daily fee
assessment. Many of the leaflets were
inserted into the papers early
yesterday morning.
The leaflets attacked the Daily's
editorial stand in favor of the Kevin
McDermott Council of Presidents
slate, but opposition slate head Lee
Rosenbaum said he personally voted
for the Daily assessment, although his
slate had not taken a position on it.
Daily Editor Kevin Smith called the
leaflet "a really cheap shot which was
timed so that the Daily would not be

able to respond before the election."
Fitzgerald said yesterday that
distribution of the leaflets was in
violation of ASSU by-laws governing
elections procedure.
He said that distribution was not
allowed inside the 100 foot limit of
polling places and at Tresidder Union
— two prime spots of leaflet
distribution.
Amendments Not Explained
Voters complained that the three
constitutional amendments were not
explained well enough.
The master ballots only listed the
proposed changes and not what the
ASSU Constitution and by-laws
currently state. Fitzgerald said copies
of the Constitution and by-laws are
available at the ASSU office.
A Daily sample of 99 voters
yesterday found that the slate headed
by Rosenbaum was leading
McDermott's slate. The Hammer and
Coffin slate headed by Steven Weiss
was running third.
Voters had differing opinions of the
new voting system which uses
computer cards. About half criticized
it as time consuming and confusing,
while the other half viewed it
favorably.
Many thought the inconvenience to
each voter would be made up by the
time and money saved in ballot
counting.
One student said, "I'm not an
electrical engineering major and I can't
relate to Hewlett-Packard." Another
compared voting to taking an SAT
test.

straw poll were Martha Adams, Chris
Thurston, Carol Reese and Margie

counting.
One student said, "I'm not an
electrical engineering major and I can't
relate to Hewlett-Packard." Another
compared voting to taking an SAT
test.
(Reporters contributing to the
straw poll were Martha Adams, Chris
Thurston, Carol Reese and Margie
Stone.)
Nearly 1500 students voted
yesterday in the first day of balloting
for ASSU Council of Presidents, nine
fee assessments, three constitutional
amendments and officers for the class
of 1976.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald described it as an "average
day, especially considering the rain."
Last year, about 1300 people voted on
the first day, with another 1100 voting

the second day.
Polling places in today's final day
of balloting are the Quad, history
corner, the Graduate School of
Business, the physics tank and the
Medical School from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
and the post office and engineering
corner from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The initial day of voting did not
pass without controversy. Fitzgerald
said he had received some complaints
of campaigning within 100 feet of the
polls, but would not say which slate
was accused because he hadn't
approached it with the charge.
Leaflets
Also, an anonymous group
distributed thousands of leaflets urging
students to vote against the Daily fee
assessment. Many of the leaflets were
inserted into the papers early
yesterday morning.
The leaflets attacked the Daily's
editorial stand in favor of the Kevin
McDermott Council of Presidents
slate, but opposition slate head Lee
Rosenbaum said he personally voted
for the Daily assessment, although his
slate had not taken a position on it.
Daily Editor Kevin Smith called the
leaflet "a really cheap shot which was
timed so that the Daily would not be

able to respond before the election."
Fitzgerald said yesterday that
distribution of the leaflets was in
violation of ASSU by-laws governing
elections procedure.
He said that distribution was not
allowed inside the 100 foot limit of
polling places and at Tresidder Union
— two prime spots of leaflet
distribution.
Amendments Not Explained
Voters complained that the three
constitutional amendments were not
explained well enough.
The master ballots only listed the
proposed changes and not what the
ASSU Constitution and by-laws
currently state. Fitzgerald said copies
of the Constitution and by-laws are
available at the ASSU office.
A Daily sample of 99 voters
yesterday found that the slate headed
by Rosenbaum was leading
McDermott's slate. The Hammer and
Coffin slate headed by Steven Weiss
was running third.
Voters had differing opinions of the
new voting system which uses
computer cards. About half criticized
it as time consuming and confusing,
while the other half viewed it
favorably.
Many thought the inconvenience to
each voter would be made up by the
time and money saved in ballot
counting.
