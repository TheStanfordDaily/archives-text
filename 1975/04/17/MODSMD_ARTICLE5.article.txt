# Mackey Maintains Low COP Profile
## 
### ELIZABETH POLLOCK JOHN FREED 
Where is Len Mackey? Not many
people know.
Because ASSU Vice President Len
Mackey has maintained a low profile
all year much of his work has gone
unnoticed.
A secretary's response at the
ASSU office was typical: "Len's not
in. I don't know when Len will ever
be in."
According to Paul Sobotka, who
recently resigned as co-editor of the
ASSU Course Review, Mackey "has
one problem. You never know where
to find him."
ASSU President Mike Herman said
last week that Mackey was often
"the cohesive force" which kept the
Council of Presidents (COP) working
together, but Mackey's latest move
has brought a reprimand from
Herman.
'Unfortunate' Statement
In a letter to the Daily, Herman
labeled as "unfortunate" a recent
statement by Mackey and ASSU Vice
President Ann Carter in which they
endorsed certain measures on today's
ASSU ballot.
"It has been our policy ... (to|
refrain from actively supporting or
opposing candidacies or ballot
measures," Herman wrote. "[Sluch
endorsements represent insults to
[students'] intelligence."
Mackey, contacted last night, was
asked if he had any comment on
Herman's statement.
"No, I don't," he began. "I
think the philosophy [Herman] was
taking there was one with which I
would agree. Maybe that's a
statement against what we did. ... I
don't see how it is."
Graduate Student
Mackey, a third-year law student
and the only graduate student on the
COP, is chairman of the policy board
for the Legal Counseling Office, sits
on the Board of Trustees' Committee

on Financing and Development and
belongs to a committee which advises
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan
Williams on Tresidder. As a vice
president, Mackey also:
— authored a position paper
which advocated a grant of tenure
for Asst. Religious Studies Prof.
Jerry Irish (Mackey presented the
paper to Provost William Miller);
— worked with Carter to establish
an on-campus record co-op;
— wrote a proposal which
advocated that the ASSU take over
management of Tresidder Union.
Unsuccessful Projects
Irish was denied tenure and
subsequently accepted a post at
Wichita State University. The record
co-op was defeated when students
refused to support a fee assessment
on the issue. The Tresidder proposal
fell through because lack of time
precluded elections on the necessary
constitutional amendments and fee
assessments, and a new student ID
procedure designed by Mackey was
too expensive.
Thus, it appears that many of
Mackey's major projects have failed
to come to fruition, but Herman
suggested that "perhaps the
University is not accessible to Len's
ideas." Mackey "really has been
doing a great deal in the office," he
added.
ASSU Sen. Robert Nelson
criticized Mackey for a lack of
interaction with the Senate.
"We haven't heard a whole lot
from Len," he explained, but added
that the Senate had had its greatest
contact with the COP while Mackey
was "out of action" recovering from
a knee injury.
Problem Status
ASSU Sen. Lee Peterson saw
Mackey's graduate status as a
problem.
"I know he's doing things —
mostly with legal counseling,"
Peterson noted, but "I don't feel that

he's really represented the
undergraduates."
Mackey agreed with the charge.
"I think it's true," Mackey
conceded. "I'm a graduate, for one
thing, and I believe the Senate is
elected to represent the
students... . The Council of
Presidents is another branch of
government from the Senate. The
presidents aren't elected to do
business with the Senate."
Less Time
ASSU officers receive a salary of
$60 per month and are permitted to
attend school on a half-time basis.
But, Mackey says. Law School Dean

Thomas Ehrlich insists on law
students' taking a full load.
The net result is that Mackey has
less time than other COP members to
work on ASSU-related matters.
Although no graduate students are
running in this year's COP election,
several slates in past years have had
graduates. Mackey hypothesized that
graduates were not represented on
slates this year because of graduate
students' apathy toward the ASSU.
"It's a very rare thing for a
graduate to vote," Mackey
commented. The ASSU "has about
zero impact on the life of a graduate
student, except to collect fee
assessments."

students... . The Council of
Presidents is another branch of
government from the Senate. The
presidents aren't elected to do
business with the Senate."
Less Time
ASSU officers receive a salary of
$60 per month and are permitted to
attend school on a half-time basis.
But, Mackey says. Law School Dean

Thomas Ehrlich insists on law
students' taking a full load.
The net result is that Mackey has
less time than other COP members to
work on ASSU-related matters.
Although no graduate students are
running in this year's COP election,
several slates in past years have had
graduates. Mackey hypothesized that
graduates were not represented on
slates this year because of graduate
students' apathy toward the ASSU.
"It's a very rare thing for a
graduate to vote," Mackey
commented. The ASSU "has about
zero impact on the life of a graduate
student, except to collect fee
assessments."

MACKEY MARKED — ASSU Vice President Len Mackey has recently been
criticized for inactivity, for failing to represent undergraduates, and for
taking stances on ASSU election measures.
Where is Len Mackey? Not many
people know.
Because ASSU Vice President Len
Mackey has maintained a low profile
all year much of his work has gone
unnoticed.
A secretary's response at the
ASSU office was typical: "Len's not
in. I don't know when Len will ever
be in."
According to Paul Sobotka, who
recently resigned as co-editor of the
ASSU Course Review, Mackey "has
one problem. You never know where
to find him."
ASSU President Mike Herman said
last week that Mackey was often
"the cohesive force" which kept the
Council of Presidents (COP) working
together, but Mackey's latest move
has brought a reprimand from
Herman.
'Unfortunate' Statement
In a letter to the Daily, Herman
labeled as "unfortunate" a recent
statement by Mackey and ASSU Vice
President Ann Carter in which they
endorsed certain measures on today's
ASSU ballot.
"It has been our policy ... (to|
refrain from actively supporting or
opposing candidacies or ballot
measures," Herman wrote. "[Sluch
endorsements represent insults to
[students'] intelligence."
Mackey, contacted last night, was
asked if he had any comment on
Herman's statement.
"No, I don't," he began. "I
think the philosophy [Herman] was
taking there was one with which I
would agree. Maybe that's a
statement against what we did. ... I
don't see how it is."
Graduate Student
Mackey, a third-year law student
and the only graduate student on the
COP, is chairman of the policy board
for the Legal Counseling Office, sits
on the Board of Trustees' Committee

on Financing and Development and
belongs to a committee which advises
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan
Williams on Tresidder. As a vice
president, Mackey also:
— authored a position paper
which advocated a grant of tenure
for Asst. Religious Studies Prof.
Jerry Irish (Mackey presented the
paper to Provost William Miller);
— worked with Carter to establish
an on-campus record co-op;
— wrote a proposal which
advocated that the ASSU take over
management of Tresidder Union.
Unsuccessful Projects
Irish was denied tenure and
subsequently accepted a post at
Wichita State University. The record
co-op was defeated when students
refused to support a fee assessment
on the issue. The Tresidder proposal
fell through because lack of time
precluded elections on the necessary
constitutional amendments and fee
assessments, and a new student ID
procedure designed by Mackey was
too expensive.
Thus, it appears that many of
Mackey's major projects have failed
to come to fruition, but Herman
suggested that "perhaps the
University is not accessible to Len's
ideas." Mackey "really has been
doing a great deal in the office," he
added.
ASSU Sen. Robert Nelson
criticized Mackey for a lack of
interaction with the Senate.
"We haven't heard a whole lot
from Len," he explained, but added
that the Senate had had its greatest
contact with the COP while Mackey
was "out of action" recovering from
a knee injury.
Problem Status
ASSU Sen. Lee Peterson saw
Mackey's graduate status as a
problem.
"I know he's doing things —
mostly with legal counseling,"
Peterson noted, but "I don't feel that

he's really represented the
undergraduates."
Mackey agreed with the charge.
"I think it's true," Mackey
conceded. "I'm a graduate, for one
thing, and I believe the Senate is
elected to represent the
students... . The Council of
Presidents is another branch of
government from the Senate. The
presidents aren't elected to do

assessments, and a new student ID
procedure designed by Mackey was
too expensive.
Thus, it appears that many of
Mackey's major projects have failed
to come to fruition, but Herman
suggested that "perhaps the
University is not accessible to Len's
ideas." Mackey "really has been
doing a great deal in the office," he
added.
ASSU Sen. Robert Nelson
criticized Mackey for a lack of
interaction with the Senate.
"We haven't heard a whole lot
from Len," he explained, but added
that the Senate had had its greatest
contact with the COP while Mackey
was "out of action" recovering from
a knee injury.
Problem Status
ASSU Sen. Lee Peterson saw
Mackey's graduate status as a
problem.
"I know he's doing things —
mostly with legal counseling,"
Peterson noted, but "I don't feel that

he's really represented the
undergraduates."
Mackey agreed with the charge.
"I think it's true," Mackey
conceded. "I'm a graduate, for one
thing, and I believe the Senate is
elected to represent the
students... . The Council of
Presidents is another branch of
government from the Senate. The
presidents aren't elected to do
business with the Senate."
Less Time
ASSU officers receive a salary of
$60 per month and are permitted to
attend school on a half-time basis.
But, Mackey says. Law School Dean

Thomas Ehrlich insists on law
students' taking a full load.
The net result is that Mackey has
less time than other COP members to
work on ASSU-related matters.
Although no graduate students are
running in this year's COP election,
several slates in past years have had
graduates. Mackey hypothesized that
graduates were not represented on
slates this year because of graduate
students' apathy toward the ASSU.
"It's a very rare thing for a
graduate to vote," Mackey
commented. The ASSU "has about
zero impact on the life of a graduate
student, except to collect fee
assessments."

MACKEY MARKED — ASSU Vice President Len Mackey has recently been
criticized for inactivity, for failing to represent undergraduates, and for
taking stances on ASSU election measures.
