# Fast, Noon Rally Mark Food Day Observance

### JON BIGELOW 
Nearly 1500 students with
University meal plans and many others
in fraternities, eating clubs and
independent houses have signed up to
fast today for Food Day, according to
Rob Quick, Stanford Food Day
Committee chairman.
For each student who hands in his
meal card as part of the fasting
activities, the University Food Service
will give one day's rebate money to
the Food Day Committee, which in
turn will donate the money to various
funds and organizations.

Food Day is being celebrated
nationwide as "a national day of
concern about rising prices, declining
quality of food, and famine," said
Quick. He added that there has been a
"tremendous response" — 800 other
universities have formed Food Day
committees.
The idea of a Food Day similar to
the Earth Day of three years ago
originated at the Center for Science in
the Public Interest in Washington, D.C.
The Food Day Committee here is
also encouraging those who eat
off-campus to join in the fast and
donate their normal food expenses for
a day.
Involve Campus
"We want to involve as much of the
campus as possible," Quick said.
The Committee will hold a fair in
White Plaza today, with information
tables and locations to make
donations. A noon rally will feature
speakers such as Religious Studies
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown and
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake.
The money collected through
rebates and donations will go to
famine relief organizations such as the
Community Hunger Appeal (or
CROP), which provides aid to third
world countries, the Palo Alto
"Hunger Program," and a food-stamp
outreach program, through which poor
and hungry people are informed about
food stamps and aided in getting them.
The Stanford Food Day Committee is
an ASSU-funded organization.
A teach-in and panel discussion will
also be held at 4 p.m. in Memorial
Church.
'An Interesting Experience'
Quick said that besides increasing
awareness and generating
contributions, fasting "would be an
interesting experience for those who
have never done it. It would be
educational. . . .Those who do it find

that the hunger goes away about half
way through the day."
Maxine Anderson, manager of the
University Food Service, said her
office had decided to help with the
Food Day activities after several
requests had been made for fasting
rebates by smaller groups.
"It was not our policy to give
rebates under these circumstances,"
she said, "but we told them that if
they were willing to wait until April
17. we would arrange rebates for
everyone who wanted to fast on that
day."
Anderson said that for those
students eating in the dorms who
choose not to fast, a special menu will
be offered, including bean sprouts for
the salads, brown rice, and no beef.
