# Shuttle Bus Trial Runs On Schedule
## 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
An average of 20 people per night
have used the two-week old campus
shuttle bus service now offered by the
University, according to Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape.
A survey of the riders has indicated
that the busiest shift comes around 10
p.m. Despite this, Snape said, 'There's
been no problem with [the bus]
keeping on schedule."
The survey also revealed that most
students use the bus to travel from
labs back to their residences because
they feel it is safer than walking. Most
of the riders are female.
The University initiated the free
shuttle bus service on a trial baas earlier
this month. When the trial period
expires on April 27, the surveys will
help the University decide whether to
continue to fund the service, Snape
said.
Both Snape and Gloria Guth, head
of the Committee of Graduate Women
on Safety at Stanford, claim that
increased publicity is necessary to
continue minibus operation.
"Laminated signs are being posted
at the bus stops, and we've printed up
700 schedules to be put in places like
Main Library and on the kiosks this
week," said Guth.
Different accounts from the Office
of Campus Affairs have provided $800
to fund the shuttle service, but Snape
said, "it looks like there won't be
much money left after three
weeks. ... I don't think the bus can
run through midterms."
Although the Alpha Phi Omega
service organization provides
volunteer drivers on two nights,
minibus operation fees average "about
$20 per night in gas and driver's
salaries," said Guth. The bus survey
indicates that most people would be
willing to pay 15 cents for the ride,
but if operational expenses are to be
met, the present figure of 20 riders per
night would have to at least triple.
"If the Carpenter | parking | report
goes through, then they say they are
committed to use parking fees to keep
traffic off campus," said Guth. She
said she hopes that the minibus might
receive a portion of these fees.
