## Opinions editorial Food Day 
### 
Across the country today, people will show their concern
: for the world's food crisis by supporting Food Day. We
- support Food Day, and hope that it may mark the beginning
♦ of increased concern over the world's food crisis.
This does not mean, however, that we necessarily urge
• everyone to fast all day. We think that fasting is only one of
' many ways that students can show their support for Food
. Day.
We ask only that members of the Stanford community do
: something to educate themselves about the food crisis and
: show their concern in whatever way they deem appropriate.
