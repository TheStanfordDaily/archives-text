# Moynihan Is A...

Amid charges of racism, we
have neglected to mention other
aspects of the beliefs of Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
Lest I be charged with bias, let
me mention one positive proposal
made by Moynihan. He was
among the first national figures to
advocate the negative income tax,
essentially a guaranteed-income
scheme. While this is only a
band-aid proposal, it is certainly
more progressive than benign
neglect.
But more recently, Moynihan
has set forth his views on
America's relationship to the
Third World. Having recently
served as U.S. ambassador to
India, he now holds scholarly
opinions on the subject. His
remarks appeared in the March
issue of Commentary.
He mourns the failure of
American foreign policy, citing in
particular the rough treatment
U.S. policies have had in the
United Nations, the Stockholm
Conference on the Environment,
the U.N. Conference on
Population and the recent World
Food Conference.
In each of these, the West, and
particularly the United States, has
been attacked for consuming far
more than its share of the world's
resources while feigning concern
over the increasing population of

Third World countries only to
prevent their economic
development.
He calls on the United States
to adopt a tougher stance towards
the Third World, while he scolds
Americans for an "extraordinarily
passive" policy that tries but fails
to appease the developing nations.
He attributes the bulk of these
nations' economic problems to
their adoption of socialism, which
he traces to their being creations
largely of the British Empire.
He goes on to say that
multinational corporations are the
most creative institutions of the
20th Century, and calls upon us
to more aggressively promote the
cause of international liberalism.
Moynihan's position deeply
angers me. There is no space to
explain the source of his ideas.
Several hundred years ago they
paraded under the name of "the
white man's burden" and resulted
in colonialism.
Today they are the academic
justification for continued U.S.
economic imperialism. I am a
senior and do not wish to listen to
his position. I do not believe that
we should give legitimacy to this
man's racism and imperialist
attitudes under the cloak of
graduation.
