# Cards: no longer a sure bet
## Bruin netters, with Martin, won't just watch this year 
### RON BECK 
Take away 1973 NCAA Champion Sandy Mayer
and 1974 NCAA runner-up Chico Hagey from
Stanford's tennis team and what have you got?
The top-ranked team in the nation.
It just doesn't make sense. Or does it?
Stanford enters this weekend's matches against
UCLA and USC with a 12-0 record. And that's
because of one of the strongest lineups depthwise in
college tennis history.
Starting with defending NCAA Champ john
Whitlinger and going straight down the order with
Nick Saviano, Pat DuPre, Jim Delaney, Gene Mayer
and Bill Maze, the lineup is awfully intimidating to
every opposing coach in the nation.
Well, Almost Every One
But there's one exception. UCLA Coach Glenn
Bassett isn't scared of the Cardinals, and there's a
good reason for that.
The Bruins have almost everyone back from the
squad that handed Stanford its only dual match loss
in the last two years. But add to that corps the
top-ranked amateur in the nation, Billy Martin, and
move everyone in last year's lineup down one
position and — as if by magic — UCLA becomes a real
challenge to Stanford.
And Friday's match ought to go a long way
towards determining which of the two teams is the
best in the Pac-8 and the nation. When the Cards met
UCLA two weeks ago in Los Angeles, rain curtailed a
match which Stanford was winning 3-1. So this match
becomes an automatic rubber match, with the winner
probably getting the number one seed in the Pac-8

tournament next month.
And the number one seed is important, because
with only three strong teams in a field of eight, the
top team should breeze to the finals while the second
and third seeds will be forced into a semifinal faceoff.
USC is a different story. The Trojans — last year's
NCAA runner-ups — lost the top three players from
last year's squad. And it shows. Stanford topped the
Trojans in Los Angeles by a 6-3 score, and only one
week later UCLA embarassed USC, 8-1.
Individually, USC has some top-notch players. Top
player Butch Walts has had a good year, including a
recent three-set victory over Whitlinger. At number
two singles is Bruce Manson, a freshman not quite
ready for the caliber of competition that Nick
Saviano and UCLA's Brian Teacher provide.
But after the top two, the Trojans are very young
and very inexperienced. In two more years, the
Trojans will be the team to beat. But not this
weekend, and not anytime for the rest of this season.
As far as individual match-ups go, the best match
of the weekend should be Whitlinger's test against
Martin. Martin, along with San Jose State's surprising
Hank Pfister, should be the two top challengers to
Whitlinger's individual NCAA crown.
Other key matches will be the afternoon doubles
matches, Stanford's real question mark. A strong
showing in the second and third doubles positions for
the Cards should decide any close matches in
Stanford's favor.
But Pac-8 seedings aside, today's matches won't
mean more than pride and prestige for the players,
and, consequently, a lot of enjoyment for the fans.
