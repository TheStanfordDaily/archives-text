# It's a tough act to follow
## After last season, Whitlinger has repeating dreams 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
"He has nothing to gain and
everything to lose when he walks
on the court,"says Stanford
tennis coach Dick Gould about his
top player and the defending
NCAA singles and doubles
champion.
Not quite by design, John
Whitlinger has played the part
very well recently, losing more
singles matches in the last three
weeks - four — than in his
previous two years at Stanford.
But nobody seems particularly
worried, least of all Whitlinger.
"Things are going to turn
around," he says."I just have to
put my mind to it that I can come
back. I'm not worried at all. It's
going to be there and it's still a
long season. If you get hot now,
you could fizzle out by the time
the Pac-B's and the NCAA's come
along. Team matches are
important and I'm going to do my
best to win them, but I'm
pointing for the Pac-B's and the
NCAA's.
"It's a lot tougher when you're
on top and everybody's gunning
for you. It's a challenge and it's
going to make me a better player.
I just hope people don't lose
confidence in me, because i don't
like to lose. It'll come along."

Gould concurs. "The losses
don't concern me. When it comes
down to the big stuff, I know he'll
be ready. I have every confidence
in Johnny and how he'll do."
Despite his current slump,
"Whit" would still have to be
considered the favorite to
successfully defend his NCAA
single's title at the NCAA
Championships at Corpus Christi,
Texas in June. He has all the
credentials.
A native of Neenah, Wisconsin,
Whitlinger won the state high
school singles championship four
consecutive seasons. He captured
11 national junior titles and at 17
was rated the third best
18-and-under player in the United
States. As a freshman at Stanford
two years ago, Whitlinger played
only moderately well at number
six on the ladder but still finished
the season with an 18-2 record.
But it was last year as a
sophomore that he really
emerged.
1974: A Real Hit
For most people, the year
1974 ranks right up there with
acid indigestion on their list of
fond memories. Not Whitlinger.
Whit played at number three
singles, went 16-1 for the year,
and wound up winning both the

NCAA single's championship -
defeating teammate Chico Hagey
in the finals — and the doubles
title, with Jim Delaney. He also
won the Nor-Cal Intercollegiate
Singles and the Ojai
Intercollegiate Singles and
Doubles.
Whit jumped in 1974 from the
59th-ranked men's player in the
U.S. to his present rank of 27th,
professionals included, surpassing
teammates Delaney, Pat DuPre
and Nick Saviano. That makes
Whitlinger the second-ranked
amateur in the country behind his
Friday night opponent, Billy
Martin of UCLA — rated the 22nd
best. The doubles team of
Whitlinger-Delaney is the best in
the nation among amateurs and is
ranked 11th overall.
Mental Approach
"I just put my mind to playing
tennis," Whitlinger said,
explaining his rise from a
potential star to a confirmed one.
"I knew I could beat almost
everybody in the United States
except [Sandy] Mayer, and then
when Sandy quit, I thought I had
a good chance to win it all if I
kept improving. I was really on
a hot streak after my one loss
down at UCLA.
"I had a lot of confidence, and
that's a major part of my game.
Right now that's just a little
shaky. It's starting to come back.
Last year my confidence was
about 120 percent, and this year
it's down to about 80, so I have a
little bit to go."
Last summer, Whitlinger
played the United States
professional summer circuit,
naturally declining to accept any
earnings as all good amateurs
must. Had he been able to pocket
his winnings, Whitlinger would
have made over $12,000 for seven
weeks' work - enough to keep
out of the unemployment line for
awhile, anyway.
Whitlinger, a psychology major
and one of six members of the
tennis team living in Zeta Psi,
would like to turn pro after this
season if he feels his game is
ready. If his slump continues,

which seems unlikely, he'll
probably return to Stanford in the
fall; if he plays back to his 1974
form and makes a good showing
in the Pac-B's and NCAA's, look
for him to take the big step.
Fast Success
"The thing is, I don't want to
be just another young American
going out and getting killed all the
time. When I turn pro I want to
be really playing well and go out
and maybe win a couple of
tournaments so I can make a
name pretty early.
"It would be nice to come
back, and it would also be nice to
turn pro. I don't think I'm going
to lose either way."
Whitlinger plays a controlled
game. You won't see him flailing
away at the ball as if he were
holding a machete instead of a
racket. He doesn't have the
overpowering serve of
ex - Stanford-star-turned-pro
Roscoe Tanner or the consistency
off the ground of Mayer,
another Stanford pro, but as
Gould says,"he has a lot of
both."
Sturdy Two-fister
Whit's trademark is his
two-handed backhand, which he
developed as a kid to add a little

muscle to the shot. He can afford
to use a two-handed backhand
because of his quickness; a slower
player can't set up the shot
quickly enough and loses a lot of
reach trying.
Most of Whit's big points come
off his sharply-angled volleys and
passing shots. He has a topspin
forehand in addition to the
two-handed backhand and likes to
set both up with strong returns of
serve to the opponent's feet.
Whitlinger largely attributes his
difficulties this season to
inconsistent groundstrokes.
Whit's serve is solid and
well-placed if not explosive.
Gould says his biggest
improvement this year has been in
the serve, which has "10 percent
more pace and 20 percent more
penetration" than last year.
No Hidden Feelings
Whitlinger's attitude wins him
matches on the court and respect
off it. He displays his emotions
freely — wincing in mental pain
after losing a point and conversing
with the crowd while retrieving a
ball — but doesn't let them
interfere with his game. He plays
intensely but likes to have a good
time on the court and wants

FRAT BROS—Whitlinger and Nick Saviano, right, share a laugh at the
Zete house. They don't have to go too far to find someone to talk
tennis, either. Six of their brothers are on the varsity tennis team.

WHIT AND HIS BIBLE-After his usual workout, Whitlingcr returns to the Zeta Psi house to relax. It's a
break from the pressures of competitive tennis. Often, to keep up on the tennis world, he reads Sports
Illustrated. Whitlinger confided that SI is his Bible.
people to know it.
"Tennis could be a very boring
sport," Whit said, "if you're very
businesslike out there all the time.
You just keep smiling and convey
that you're really enjoying it and
then they [the spectators] will
appreciate you more. That's what
I try to do."
Whitlinger's positive outlook
carries over to whatever he does.
And it shows.
"John is a beautiful model for
Stanford," Gould said. "He's
enthusiastic and serious about
what he does. Wherever he goes he
represents his team, family and
school in the highest possible
manner. John's a class person in
every respect."
