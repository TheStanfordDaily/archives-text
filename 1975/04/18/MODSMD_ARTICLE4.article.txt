# Hopes of being the best' bring forth quality
## Cards' sole senior netter, Jim Delaney, views tennis without all the garbage' 
### MIKE TOLLIN 
It used to be that athletes were
concerned with just playing their
chosen sport; not with squeezing
every last penny from
management, or performing
childlike feats to entertain a
crowd.
But in contemporary times,
where the sports world is one of
glittering palaces and megabucks,
there remain few true sportsmen
who just want to "play the game
and forget all the garbage that
goes with it."
Jim Delaney, Stanford's
three-time Ail-American tennis
player, is one such anachronism.
The senior netsman has one goal
— "to become the best tennis
player in the world" — and he
pursues this challenge with
unbridled vigor.
He doesn't go in for
Connersesque on-court antics and
shuns media attempts to drum up
publicity. To Delaney, tennis is a
game of concentration and
control," and when he steps
between the white lines, his single
purpose is to beat the hell out of
the guy on the other side of the
net.
Uncustomarily Low
When Delaney lines up this
weekend, he'll be playing in the
number four singles slot for
Stanford, as well as sharing the
number-one doubles slate with
John Whitlinger. It's actually
quite a come-down for the
defending NCAA doubles
champion and the nation's
fourth-ranked amateur, but it
doesn't seem to bother the
cool-headed Delaney. "Well sure
I'd like to play higher," he says,
"but I wasn't playing too well in
the winter, and I lost a couple of
challenge matches which dropped
me to fourth."
Since then however, Delaney
has returned to form. He sports
the best record of all the Cards
(11 -0), and "Right now," he says,
I'm playing real well." For the
modest, unassuming Delaney, that
is quite a concession.
The main problem throughout

Delaney's career has been an
inability to find competitive
opponents. Growing up in Japan
where his father was employed by
the U.S. State Department,
Delaney eventually ran out of
players who couid provide a tough
match. Delaney's father started
teaching his son the art of tennis
at the age of ten, and "By the
time I was in high school," says
Delaney, "I was beating
everybody pretty easily — even
the best college players in Japan."
So Delaney had to trek back to
the States every summer in order
to better satisfy his insatiable
appetite for competition. He
proceeded to win four junior titles
here, and started receiving
enticing letters from Stanford
mentor Dick Gould in ninth grade.
"I really liked basketball
more," says Delaney, "but I saw
more possibilities in tennis so I
followed up with it."
Switched Sports
Thus instead of going against
Dave Meyers and Gus Williamson
the Maples hardwoods, Delaney
will team with Whitlinger against
the Mar>tin-Teacher and
Walts-Manson combos this
weekend.
The matches with the
smog-city dwellers have created
quite a bit of excitement around
the Farm, but to Delaney, every
match is played the same - as if a
national championship is at stake.
"I think I'm as good a competitor
as there is in college tennis," the

senior righthander admits.
"I'm aggressive out there and I
attack a lot. I'm stronger and
faster than most players and I try
to take advantage of that."
But the key to Delaney's game
is control. "I used to throw balls
around, but I try to contain my
emotions now," he says."I try to
control myself so that I'm always
well aware of what's going on out
there. I play for the percentage
shots and it's important to always
be thinking. I know it probably
looks like I'm just a very physical
player, but there's much, much
more to it than that."
Same Off-Court
Delaney's equanimity on the
court is matched by his off-court
demeanor. He has been likened to

Johnny Miller in his life style. "I
know few people of as high moral
character and ideals as Jim," says
Coach Gould. "I've never had an
athlete of whom I've been more
proud of in terms of personal
development."
A smile crosses Delaney's face
when he hears such praise and one
detects him slightly blushing.
"Christianity is the most
important thing in my life," he
said, "but I'm not a Mormon. I'm
not a real hell-raiser or a big party
man, but I don't consider myself
straight or conservative either. I
don't smoke, but I do like to have
a beer occasionally. I just think
I'm pretty normal."
Except when it comes to
tennis, that is. Delaney expects

Stanford to repeat as NCAA
champs this year, and he hopes to
improve his own showing in the
singles tournament. "One reason I
didn't go pro at the end of last
year was to have a shot at things I
didn't do too well last season," he
says. "Specifically, the NCAA
singles."
But next year the 6-2,
180-pound Delaney will surely
play in the pro ranks. Last winter
he proved his capabilities when he
reached the semi-finals of the U.S.
National Indoors Championships.
And his only fault (asset?) is
that he's not the tennis showman
who'll draw the crowds by
throwing his racket or shouting
obscenities.
