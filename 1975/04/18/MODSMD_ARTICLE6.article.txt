Call it whatever you want. Call it the ultimate in
decadence, or call it a manifestation of all that is
great in life. But whatever qualities you ascribc to
Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion West in Beverly
Hills, you can't deny that it is one of the most
amazing homes in the world.
Stanford's tennis team got a chance to drop by
the mansion in between matches against USC and
UCLA two weeks ago in Los Angeles, and the
netters loved it.
Everything was set up perfectly for the netters,
from the lunch of steak, lobsters, tournedos, fresh
fruit, ad infinitum, to an afternoon Jacuzzi in the
man-made rock grottoes — complete with
temperature controls, background music selector
and a sampling of Bunny-types.
The visit started with a tour of the grounds.
Included among the waterfalls, rivers and pools are
a series of hidden conveniences (stereo speakers,
heaters), birds of worldwide origin and an
enormous collection of exotic plants and animals.
One of the more popular stops on the tour was
the game room, which contains about 20 games
ranging from the basic pinball-type to every
computerized game along the Pong-Flim-Flam line
imaginable.
Comedian Bill Cosby and actor Peter Brown
joined the netters after lunch for some
not-so-serious tennis. "Coz" took on a big chore
when he attempted to split up the defending NCAA
doubles Champs and replace Jim Delaney as John
Whitlinger's partner, but Cosby was up for it, and
was a lot better than expected.
Later in the afternoon some Bunnies started
filtering over to the courts. It was at this point that
the tennis started to get even less serious. As the
day advanced, Bunnies played tennis, Jacuzzied and
played in the game room with the players and the
guests.
And surely — as would only be fitting — none of
the players wanted to go when it came time to
leave. For a while, at least, Hefner's Xanadu had
taken the netters' minds completely off USC,
UCLA and even Stanford.
