# Batsmen meet Cal in important series

### DAN PYNE 
When the Stanford baseball team meets Cal in a doubleheader
Saturday and a single game at Sunken Diamond Sunday, more than
pride is at stake.
For in the stands at Sunken Diamond, running through the
inning-by-inning banter of the "regulars" who brave the rain and the
drizzles and the mid-week afternoon blahs, there is a whisper of a
championship.
It started in Riverside, where the Cardinals won six of seven games
to get a shot at the championship. They almost got it.
It spread to the Farm, where, the week after their Riverside
journey, Stanford took two of three games from powerful UCLA.
It spread to Los Angeles last weekend, where the Cards took two

of three games from five-time
defending national champion USC.
And it continued this week,
when the Cardinals plastered St.
Mary's 7-1 and came from behind
to beat Santa Clara 4-2. Ths
Stanford baseball team is 26-15
overall.
But Coach Ray Young is calm.
"We're the same team as we were
at the beginning of the season,"
he said after the USC weekend.
"We're just getting more
consistent."
The Bears,* 11-15-1, are not
having the best of seasons. And
last weekend they dropped three
games to UCLA and fell into the
Pac-8 cellar.
But there's something about a
Stanford-Cal game that always
messes up athletic logic. So the
Bears will be tough, as Ray Young
put it, and Stanford cannot afford
a slump at this point.
