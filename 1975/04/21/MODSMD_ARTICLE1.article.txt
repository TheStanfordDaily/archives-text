# Herman Lauds Judicial Plan
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
ASSU President Mike Herman last
night again urged that students
endorse the new student judicial
system proposed recently by the
Committee of 15 (C-15). Herman, a
C-15 member, appeared with
Committee Chairwoman Kathy
Cunningham at the taping of KZSU's
Campus Conference program.
If students reject the proposed
system, Herman predicted that "it will
take at least two years before the C-15
comes up with another proposal," and
warned that the proposal probably
"will not be substantively different
from the one we have now, and may
be a lot worse."
Students will vote on the proposed
Stanford Judicial Council (S.JC)
Wednesday and Thursday during the
ASSU presidential runoff election.
Herman and Cunningham both
emphasized that there is considerable
resistance among faculty members to
any further efforts to draft judicial
system proposals.
The President said that three of the
six faculty members on the C-15
"consistently, throughout [all of| the
C-15 meetings, moved for
adjournment, filibustered, in other
words, tried to keep the C-15 from
coming up with any sort of proposal at
all.
No Change?
"That situation is not going to
change" in coming years, Herman
asserted. "The faculty has absolutely
nothing to gain out of changing the
judicial system from what it is now."
He complained that the faculty "is a
group that is surprisingly obstinate in
| resisting) change."
The major changes proposed in the
C-15 plan are:
—a student-majority judicial panel
to adjudicate alleged violations of the
Honor Code (a faculty-majority panel
would hear all other cases);
—selection of the student members

of the SJC by the ASSU Senate from a
randomly compiled list of 24 students
who express an interest in serving.
Cunningham said she "would
assume that Honor Code eases will
probably be the great bulk of all eases
next year, and probably the year
after."
Student Majority
"We have a good opportunity to
show that a student majority is a good
thing," Cunningham pointed out,
referring to the proposed SJC's
composition in Honor Code cases.
A joint statement issued last night
by Herman, Cunningham and the
other four student members of the
C-15 noted that the Committee's
proposal "sets the tone for further

change to the present system."
The statement also acknowledged
that the C-15 proposals "do not go as
far as some students would like," but
argued that "these changes are the best
we can possibly obtain at this time."
The statement also said the SJC plan is
"far from ideal from a faculty or
administration perspective."
Herman and Cunningham said they
plan to "go and speak to a lot of
students to let them know what the
issues are." They added that they
expect students to endorse the SJC if
they are familiar enough with how it
differs from the present judicial
system.
The Campus Conference program
will be aired tomorrow night.
