# Campus Politics Grind On As Usual
## 
### John Freed 
Ah, politics. Maybe it's the
sunshine — I don't know — but
everybody seems to want to get
into the act.
First, University President
Richard W. Lyman has leapt into
the fray over the latest proposal
from the Committee of 15 (C-15)
by attacking a Daily editorial on
the subject.
Lyman took no stand on the
proposal itself, but insisted that
the editorial — which opposed the
latest C-15 plan — was "grossly
misleading and insulting" because
it said the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) has been used to "impede
demonstrators."
Apparently, Lyman took a
narrow interpretation of that
phrase, as being akin to physical
obstruction of protestors. It is
ridiculous that the CJP could thus
"impede" demonstrators.
But the president is setting up
a straw man. Perhaps the editorial
could have been more carefully
phrased — "coerce" may have
been more accurate than
"impede" — but the purpose of
prosecutions before the CJP has
clearly been to stop the
demonstrators.
Herman's Endorsement
Next on the list is Michael G.
Herman, outgoing ASSU
president. Last week, Herman
blasted ASSU Vice Presidents Len
Mackey and Ann Carter for daring
to endorse ballot measures.
"It has been our policy since
the day of our election that we
would refrain from actively
supporting . . . ballot measures on
which the students vote," Herman
pompously wrote in a letter to the
Daily (April 18).
Yet Herman co-signed an
endorsement of the C-15 proposal
which appeared in the Daily just
one day earlier! What explains the
turnabout?
Herman is a member of the
C-15.
What is the nature of this
proposal, that has pushed Lyman
and Herman into the same camp?
First of all, it is a plan that is
demonstrably worse than the C-15
revision plan submitted last year.
Under last year's plan, there

would have been a student
majority in all cases heard by the
judicial panel. This majority could
— foreseeably — only have been
removed by Lyman.
If students had endorsed that
plan (they overwhelmingly
rejected it), they could hope that
Lyman would not take away the
student majority by whim.

The current plan has no such
advantages. Under the CJP, close
votes have gone against students
because of the CJP's faculty
majority. Even Herman admits
this vital point: "... in crucial
and divisive situations, the balance
of judgment has swayed to the
faculty in what indeed is a judicial
system for the students," he
wrote.
But just what are the "crucial
and divisive" cases? Certainly not
Honor Code case's (which Herman
says amounted to "over 90
percent" of the 15 cases heard
this year).
Indeed, the crucial issues will
re-appear if the Administration
once again decides to use the
judicial system to impede (excuse
me, "coerce") demonstrators.
And in these cases, a faculty
majority is mandated by the C-15
proposal!
The other objectionable facet
of the C-15 plan is the method of
selecting panel representatives.
Faculty members may choose
anyone from among themselves.
Presumably, in troubled times,
"anti-student" (a term I leave
undefined) faculty members
would volunteer their services and
receive the nod.
Random Selection
And there's the rub. The ASSU
Senate would be required to
choose from a randomly selected

pool of 24 students who had
indicated a willingness to serve. In
troubled times, with a faculty
majority mandated, the Senate
would likely refuse to choose
anyone.
Under those circumstances,
student members would be chosen
entirely at random, presumably
by the Office of the Dean of

Student Affairs.
Students should look to the
future — to the long-term effects
that approving the C-15 plan
would have.
The latest proposal deserves to
go down to an even more crushing
defeat than last year's.

Ah, politics. Maybe it's the
sunshine — I don't know — but
everybody seems to want to get
into the act.
First, University President
Richard W. Lyman has leapt into
the fray over the latest proposal
from the Committee of 15 (C-15)
by attacking a Daily editorial on
the subject.
Lyman took no stand on the
proposal itself, but insisted that
the editorial — which opposed the
latest C-15 plan — was "grossly
misleading and insulting" because
it said the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) has been used to "impede
demonstrators."
Apparently, Lyman took a
narrow interpretation of that
phrase, as being akin to physical
obstruction of protestors. It is
ridiculous that the CJP could thus
"impede" demonstrators.
But the president is setting up
a straw man. Perhaps the editorial
could have been more carefully
phrased — "coerce" may have
been more accurate than
"impede" — but the purpose of
prosecutions before the CJP has
clearly been to stop the
demonstrators.
Herman's Endorsement
Next on the list is Michael G.
Herman, outgoing ASSU
president. Last week, Herman
blasted ASSU Vice Presidents Len
Mackey and Ann Carter for daring
to endorse ballot measures.
"It has been our policy since
the day of our election that we
would refrain from actively
supporting . . . ballot measures on
which the students vote," Herman
pompously wrote in a letter to the
Daily (April 18).
Yet Herman co-signed an
endorsement of the C-15 proposal
which appeared in the Daily just
one day earlier! What explains the
turnabout?
Herman is a member of the
C-15.
What is the nature of this
proposal, that has pushed Lyman
and Herman into the same camp?
First of all, it is a plan that is
demonstrably worse than the C-15
revision plan submitted last year.
Under last year's plan, there

would have been a student
majority in all cases heard by the
judicial panel. This majority could
— foreseeably — only have been
removed by Lyman.
If students had endorsed that
plan (they overwhelmingly
rejected it), they could hope that
Lyman would not take away the
student majority by whim.

The current plan has no such
advantages. Under the CJP, close
votes have gone against students
because of the CJP's faculty
majority. Even Herman admits
this vital point: "... in crucial
and divisive situations, the balance
of judgment has swayed to the
faculty in what indeed is a judicial
system for the students," he
wrote.
But just what are the "crucial
and divisive" cases? Certainly not
Honor Code case's (which Herman
says amounted to "over 90
percent" of the 15 cases heard
this year).
Indeed, the crucial issues will
re-appear if the Administration
once again decides to use the
judicial system to impede (excuse
me, "coerce") demonstrators.
And in these cases, a faculty
majority is mandated by the C-15
proposal!
The other objectionable facet
of the C-15 plan is the method of
selecting panel representatives.
Faculty members may choose
anyone from among themselves.
Presumably, in troubled times,
"anti-student" (a term I leave
undefined) faculty members
would volunteer their services and
receive the nod.
Random Selection
And there's the rub. The ASSU
Senate would be required to
choose from a randomly selected

pool of 24 students who had
indicated a willingness to serve. In
troubled times, with a faculty
majority mandated, the Senate
would likely refuse to choose
anyone.
Under those circumstances,
student members would be chosen
entirely at random, presumably
by the Office of the Dean of

Student Affairs.
Students should look to the
future — to the long-term effects
that approving the C-15 plan
would have.
The latest proposal deserves to
go down to an even more crushing
defeat than last year's.

percent" of the 15 cases heard
this year).
Indeed, the crucial issues will
re-appear if the Administration
once again decides to use the
judicial system to impede (excuse
me, "coerce") demonstrators.
And in these cases, a faculty
majority is mandated by the C-15
proposal!
The other objectionable facet
of the C-15 plan is the method of
selecting panel representatives.
Faculty members may choose
anyone from among themselves.
Presumably, in troubled times,
"anti-student" (a term I leave
undefined) faculty members
would volunteer their services and
receive the nod.
Random Selection
And there's the rub. The ASSU
Senate would be required to
choose from a randomly selected

pool of 24 students who had
indicated a willingness to serve. In
troubled times, with a faculty
majority mandated, the Senate
would likely refuse to choose
anyone.
Under those circumstances,
student members would be chosen
entirely at random, presumably
by the Office of the Dean of

Student Affairs.
Students should look to the
future — to the long-term effects
that approving the C-15 plan
would have.
The latest proposal deserves to
go down to an even more crushing
defeat than last year's.
