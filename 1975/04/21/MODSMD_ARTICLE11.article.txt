Who Drinks Most?
Editor:
The pathos of a Daily reader is
well-known. We are subjected to
astigmatic analysis, paroxysms of
platitudinism and mystifying
misquotations.But never has the
Daily been so unabashedly malicious
as it was in its recent article on
alcoholic consumption on
campus.
We refer specifically to the
fallacious statement to the effect
that the Delta Upsilon Fraternity
was preceeded by both the Zeta
Psi and Delta Tau Delta
Fraternities in beer consumption
(Daily, April 15).
We have 110 quarrel with being
ranked second to the Delts in this
area. 'Dem is just plain bigger den
we is. However, there ain't no way
the Zetes could be drinking more
than us. The rankings by the
Daily reporter were apparently
obscured by the fact that fewer
kegs of beer are consumed here.
An objective analysis would have
to include the beer drunk out of
cans, bottles and pitchers.
If such figures were included in
the survey, perhaps even the Daily
could have provided some
edification on this subject. In any
case, we are positive that we
would replace the Zetes for
second place.
The Daily article also gave the
impression that campus drinking
was a phenomenon of amoral
dypsomaniacs throwing all other
values to the wind. We at the DU
house, at least, are more
principled partakers; it was W.C.
Fields who confided, "A man's
got to believe in something; I
believe I'll have another drink!"
In conclusion, we have a
constructive suggestion for the
Daily staff. A little more beer
drinking on its part would obviate
the necessity of terming its
editorial excretions "Yellow
Journalism."
