# Sexism Encourages Rape
## 
### 
The case of Joann Little, a black prisoner in
North Carolina, is coming to trial this month. She is
charged with first degree murder for the killing of a
white jailer who she says tried to rape her.
Clarence Alligood, a white guard at the Beaufort
County Jail in North Carolina, was found dead in a
cell on Aug. 27, killed with an ice pick he usually
kept in his desk drawer. The prisoner assigned to
the cell, Joann Little, was missing. The autopsy on
Alligood provided much evidence that he had
attempted to rape Little.
Little turned herself in to state authorities eight
days later. She was charged with murder despite her
claim that Alligood had attempted to rape her. The
autopsy report and other evidence of attempted
rape were not allowed at her hearing. Conviction
carries a mandatory death sentence.
Little's defense has attracted support from
women's, civil rights and black groups around the
country. These groups have raised the issues of
racism in the courts and prisons and the right of
women to defend themselves against rape.
The treatment received by Little is not an
isolated problem. Throughout the United States,
women face the danger of rape. This pervasive
danger is not caused by a few sick men; it is the
logical outcome of the sexism that permeates our
society.
Sexism exists in a multitude of forms.
Perpetuated by the schools and media, it is a part

of nearly every social relationship. Women are
taught to be passive â€”to not take initiative or
leadership in political, intellectual, economic or
social situations, especially where men are involved.
Sexist ideology teaches men to be dominant
over women and that women are at men's service
sexually, domestically and socially. Sexism is most
brutally expressed through rape.
A further result of this sexist ideology is the
treatment given rape victims by the police and
courts. Women who seek to prosecute rapists have
repeatedly found themselves defendants at their
own trials. Those women who step outside their
assigned passive role and defend themselves against
rape often find the power of the courts turned
against them.
Little's case is not unique. In California, while
Inez Garcia was on trial for killing a man she
claimed helped to rape her, evidence concerning the
rape as a mitigating circumstance was not allowed
to be introduced. She was finally convicted of
second degree murder and given a five-year to life
sentence. Her case is now being appealed.
The Alliance for Radical Change supports Little,
Garcia and all women who defend themselves
against rape and the sexism that pervades American
society.
