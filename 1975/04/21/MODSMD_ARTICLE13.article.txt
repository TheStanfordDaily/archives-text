# Brody: introductory arguments on a revised distribution requirement
## 
### 
Stanford is not a liberal arts college but the faculty has
for many years believed it has a responsibility to insure that
each student's curriculum includes experiences with subject
matter in divisions of the University other than that of the
student's major department.
The present distribution requirement, which resulted
from the joint actions of the stewards of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) and the Academic Senate, is the
formal expression of this belief. It imposes on the student an
obligation to take no fewer than three courses in each of the
two divisions of the University of which the student's major
department is not part.
With minor exceptions, the distribution requirement goes
no further: It does not alert the student to the goals of the
requirement, that is to what he or she should expect to learn
from this crossing of divisional boundaries; it docs not look
to the structure of knowledge, research and pedagogy within
each division to seek the optimal arrangement for a brief
experience; it docs not catalog courses and course sequences
which would best meet the goals of the requirement; it does
not indicate courses which would be inapposite to the
requirement; and it does not alert the faculty to the need for
courses and sequences that arc designed specifically to meet

the liberal educational goals of nonmajors.
Because the present distribution requirement does not
accomplish these ends, we have revised it. This revision is
submitted herewith to the community. These recommenda
tions for a modest restructuring of the requirement arc
tentatively slated for discussion by the Senate May 1.
Before detailing the recommended requirement itself, I
will briefly recapitulate the process which led to it, in this
form, at this time:
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US) r->egan
four years ago to consider whether and how to deal with this
question. In winter quarter of last year (1973-74), Prof.
Nancy Packer submitted to C-US a series of recommenda
tions drawn from her study of the Freshman Year which she
had carried out during her tenure as a University Fellow.
That report suggested to C-US questions about the sub
stance of the requirement and a process by which answers to
those questions could be sought. C-US adopted both the set
of questions and the suggested process as its framework for
the consideration of this issue.
An early step in the process was the convening of ad hoc
sub-committee in each of the distribution divisions of the
University (Humanities, Social Sciences/History, and Natural

Sciences/Mathematics/Tcchnology). The members of" these
sub-committees were the chairpersons (or their designated
alternates) of departments or schools within a division. These
sub-committees reported to C-US late in spring quarter last
year.
I-all and winter quarters this year C-US discussed, de
bated, and investigated further the recommendations of the
ad hoc sub-committees. The result of this process is the
revised distribution requirement.
The changes which this draft recommends appear modest
in comparison with those being called for by the proponents
of a "structured" curriculum. Indeed, they are incremental
rather than radical. But they meet head-on the defects of the
present requirement without going to a structure that is built
on the pretense that Stanford is what it is not-a four-year
liberal arts college and without the creation of a special
faculty wholly dedicated to undergraduate education.
The proposed requirement includes as its purposes:
1) informing student expectations about what the cour
ses or sequences in a given division should accomplish;
2) informing students of a recommended overall
approach to achieving the purposes of the requirement
in a given division;

3) establishing procedures whereby students can qualify
alternative approaches;
4) cataloging courses and course sequences that arc most
appropriate to the requirement and those which arc
inappropriate;
5) establishing procedures by which courses and se
quences are qualified as appropriate or inappropriate
for the requirement;
6) encouraging the development of courses and sequences
specifically designed for nonmajors; and,
7) recommending that procedures for evaluating teaching
include assessments of the degree to which the sub
stantive goals of the distribution requirement arc met
by a given course or sequence which is identified as
being particularly appropriate as a vehicle for satis
fying the requirement.
These introductory comments are mine. The document
which follows is the Committee's product and has its un
animous approval.
