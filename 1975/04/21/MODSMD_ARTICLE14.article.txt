# Report from the Committee on Undergraduate Studies on the Distribution Requirement
## 
### 
We recommend that the following distribution requirement
for the bachelor's degree be adopted to be effective in the
academic year 1976-77:
Rationale for Humanities Distribution Requirement
The purpose of this requirement is to introduce students to a
university-level study of:
a) works of creative imagination and their cultural and
historical context;
b) problems of ethics, philosophy, or belief within a
cultural context.
The Requirement
1) The distribution requirement in the humanities will be
three courses of at least three units as follows:
a) a designated sequence of three courses offered by a
department; or
b) a designated sequence of three correlated courses
offered by several departments^
c) a student-designed sequence of three correlated
courscs, to be justified in advance by a statement written by
the student and approved by the adviser and the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.

Space paid for by News and Publications Service

2) Each course or sequence offered in fulfillment of the
requirement will include a) or b), or both, of the rationale.
3) The following courses, while highly valuable on other
grounds, do not fulfill the rationale:
a) first-year language courses
b) writing courses
c) courses in creative and performing arts.
4) The requirement is preferably met in the freshman year
but should be fulfilled by the end of the sophomore year
unless other unavoidable academic obligations prevent it.
Recommendation
C-US recommends that each department in the social sciences
offer a course which introduces students to its discipline, has
no prerequisite, and is suitable for nonniajors. C-US also
recommends that departments work together to develop
courses correlated by a common theme, problem, or topic.
Rationale for Natural Sciences/Mathematics/Technology
(NS/M/T) Distribution Requirement
The purpose of this requirements is to introduce students to
a university-level study of:
a) natural phenomena and processes;
b) mathematics;
c) the approaches, methods, achievements, and limita
tions of scientific research;
d) the implications of this subject area in human affairs.

The Requirement
1) The distribution requirement in NS/M/T is three courses
of at least three units.
2) At least one of the courses will be from the areas of
natural sciences and technology and will include those
aspects of the rationale that pertain to those areas.
Recommendation
C-IJS recommends that the Schools of I ngineering and Earth
Scicnces and the NS/M/T departments of the School of
Humanities and Sciences offer courses which introduce stu
dents to the disciplines, have no prerequisites, and arc
suitable for nonscientists. Further, C-US recommends that
departments and schools work together to develop correlated
courses suitable for nonscientists.
Review and Certification for the Distribution Requirement
1) Certification of courses which will fulfill the distribution
requirements of the three area will reside in C-US.
2) The Dean of Undergraduate Studies will request each
department or school to designate courses which are suitable
to fulfill the area distribution requirement and to provide
information relevant to their certification.
3) Courses designated suitable for the distribution require
ment will be re-evaluated at regular intervals.
4) C-US will develop additional guidelines where indicated.

Course Evaluation Process
C-US recommends to the Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement's Subcommittee on the Evaluation of
Teaching and to others designing course evaluation proce
dures that questions probing student views on the success of
courses and sequences in meeting the rationale of the distri
bution requirement be incorporated.
Implementation
C-US recommends that in the academic year 1975-76 the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies undertake whatever proce
dural steps are necessary to insure that the requirement take
effect in 1976-77.

There will be a public discussion of these
proposals at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, April 22, in
the Tresidder Memorial Union lounge.

no prerequisite, and is suitable for nonniajors. C-US also
recommends that departments work together to develop
courses correlated by a common theme, problem, or topic.
Rationale for Natural Sciences/Mathematics/Technology
(NS/M/T) Distribution Requirement
The purpose of this requirements is to introduce students to
a university-level study of:
a) natural phenomena and processes;
b) mathematics;
c) the approaches, methods, achievements, and limita
tions of scientific research;
d) the implications of this subject area in human affairs.

The Requirement
1) The distribution requirement in NS/M/T is three courses
of at least three units.
2) At least one of the courses will be from the areas of
natural sciences and technology and will include those
aspects of the rationale that pertain to those areas.
Recommendation
C-IJS recommends that the Schools of I ngineering and Earth
Scicnces and the NS/M/T departments of the School of
Humanities and Sciences offer courses which introduce stu
dents to the disciplines, have no prerequisites, and arc
suitable for nonscientists. Further, C-US recommends that
departments and schools work together to develop correlated
courses suitable for nonscientists.
Review and Certification for the Distribution Requirement
1) Certification of courses which will fulfill the distribution
requirements of the three area will reside in C-US.
2) The Dean of Undergraduate Studies will request each
department or school to designate courses which are suitable
to fulfill the area distribution requirement and to provide
information relevant to their certification.
3) Courses designated suitable for the distribution require
ment will be re-evaluated at regular intervals.
4) C-US will develop additional guidelines where indicated.

Course Evaluation Process
C-US recommends to the Committee on Academic Appraisal

Teaching and to others designing course evaluation proce
dures that questions probing student views on the success of
courses and sequences in meeting the rationale of the distri
bution requirement be incorporated.
Implementation
