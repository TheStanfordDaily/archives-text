## Belly Dancing With Umara: 'Know Your Body' 
### DAN WATKISS 
Are you suffering from the
classic academic rift between
body and soul? Does your body
do what you want it to, or have
you just written it off as a lost
cause and hidden your mirrors in
the closet? Do not despair.
Perhaps ASSU-sponsored courses
in belly dancing could help you
overcome your body alienation.
"Belly dancing is a meditation
during which the dancer gets to
know his or her body and its
potentials," explains Umara, the
course's instructor. "It's all about
isolating parts of your body. If
you want some hip, you think
hip," she said with a telling thrust.
Umara has been teaching
Stanford students about the
niceties of their bodies for the
past two-and-a-half years, and is
now teaching her course in the
Clubhouse Monday and
Wednesday evenings.
Interest, she says, was initially
high, with all her courses
overloaded, but lately the dance
has fallen on hard times. A total
of 12 students, all women, were
present for the first meeting.
These aspirants of the dance came
in all shapes and sizes, ranging
from long and gangly to short and
squat. Umara stressed that there is
no optimum size for a dancer, but
that no one wants to watch a bag
of bones or a sack of potatoes,
even if he or she dances well.
Those present, in spite of their
varied figures, were not to be
discouraged by these remarks.
Very few entertained visions of
professional dancing, and most
had come with an eye to
refurbishing dilapidated bodies
rather than displaying flawless
ones.
Diverse Replies
When asked what attracted
them to belly dancing, the
students replies were as diverse as
their shapes. Beginners were
almost entirely attracted by the
sensuality of the dance. "It makes
ya feel foxy," revealed one
dancer. "The dance enhances a
woman's body, her sexuality,"
said another.
Umara pooh-poolfed the
initiates' references to sexuality,
maintaining that seductive or
suggestive dancing is a debased
form of the art. The sort of
dancing that goes on in men's

clubs for the audience's
stimulation is dismissed as
"hootchy-cootchy" by Umara.
"Belly dancing is not an
'I'm-trying-to-turn-you-on'
routine," she said, illustrating her
point with a wag of her derriere.
"The dance is very sensuous to
begin with, and doesn't need all of
that crap."
It is, rather, the ethnic origins
of the dance and the mastery of
its tribal patterns that are
emphasized in the class. Umara
first explored these origins with
the famous Jamila, la belle
danseuse whose undulating torso
adorns the Stanford Spring Fair.
Umara later voyaged throughout
the Middle East, searching out the
dance's roots in its native soil.

"There, I came across great
expertise — places where dancers
drifted through public bazaars,
doing nothing but Moroccan
shoulder shimmies," Syrian shakes
and Indian head-rolls. To illustrate
the latter, Umara circled her arms
above her head, and craned her
neck about, her head bobbing in
seeming defiance of both anatomy
and gravity.
Since her return to this
country, Umara has become
convinced that the world's best
dancers are now in the United
States. It seems that Yankee
co-optation, and the singularly
American urge to eclectic
composition have succeeded in
unifying the dance's myriad
ethnic forms into a hodge-podge

of otherwise pure, indigenous
styles. "Today, the best dancers
are in California," confided
Umara. "Elsewhere in the states,
the dance is pretty seedy."
The dance first came to this
country sometime in the
mid-1800s, Umara explained.
Ghawazee dancers from Egypt
performed for the Chicago
World's Fair in the 1870s, and
later spread to other areas. Some
dancers crossed the Atlantic to
flee persecution, she said, for in
many areas there were — and still
are — severe taboos forbidding the
sensuous dance. Many dancers
were exiled from their Middle
Eastern homelands, including
Egypt under its ruler Mohammed
Ali.
Born From Childbirth
Umara views all such
restrictions on belly dancing as
ironic. Rather than seeing the
dance as a lascivious exhibition or
a communion with dark forces,
Umara maintains that the dance
finds its source in the act of
childbirth. "Almost all of the
movements are in imitation of
childbearing: the muscular
contortions of the waist and the
rippling of the stomach." Umara
cautions, however, that very little
is, in fact, known about the early
dance and that her own views are
mostly speculative.
The more experienced of
Umara's students share their
instructor's view. "It makes you
love your body, and lets you
understand what the feminine
body can do," said Fay, a second
quarter devotee.
The dramatic nature of the
dance is brought out in the
costuming. Elaborate gowns are
worn for presentation of the
dance, and the dancer's face is
painted with symbolic designs.
Often the designs serve to identify
the dancer.
The costume worn by Umara,
unlike the abbreviated dress of
nightclub belly dancers, consists
of several layers of black and
silver veils and a turbin falling
over her hair. She decorates her
eyes with heavy black markings
which are called "tatoos." Her
students opt for more casual
attire, though, dressing in long
skirts, bathing-sjit tops and even
levis.
While there are no men

currently enrolled, Umara
encourages male participation. "In
the Middle East, there are many
men dancers," she said. "The men
do basically the same dance as the
women, but they concentrate
more on balance and juggling. The
men juggle torches and swords."
Umara admits that she has
incorporated not only juggling but
also a boa constrictor into her act.
Such stunts, she insists, while not
intrinsic to the dance, are
professionally necessary. "Unless
your audience knows something
about the dance, you can t hope
to hold their interest on your
belly for long, regardless of how

well you move. The sudden
presence of a boa either captivates
your audience or sends them
racing for the exit," she
explained.
Circular Rhythms
The rhythmic music which
accompanies the dance is a further
enticement to audience
participation. The "circular
rhythms of the music sound new
and fresh to our ears. It's very
different from the vertical beats
used in modern and jazz dancing."
Frequently a dancer makes her
own music, banging out beats
with her finger cymbals, as does
Umara.

In spite of the difficulties of
mastering the dance, Umara
welcomes all comers. No previous
dance experience is required, says
Umara, who also folk dances.
Umara's invitation to students
might offer the adventurous even
more than a reintegration of body
and soul, especially in these times
of high unemployment. For
students facing a depressed job
market, Umara offers her
assurance of a large and lucrative
demand for competent dancers. In
light of the modest fee she
charges, belly dancing may be a
bargain you can't afford to pass
up.

SMALLER TURNOUTS—At least at Stanford, the art of belly dancing
has hit upon hard times. Umara said that classes at the beginning of
the term had more students than she could handle. Her present
beginning class, some of which is pictured in back, numbers only 12.

UMARA—After traveling to the Middle East to find "the roots" of her art, Umara has returned,convinced
that the best belly dancers are currently in California. According to Umara, different ethnic styles of dance
have been co-opted by Americans for more interesting variations of ancient routines.
