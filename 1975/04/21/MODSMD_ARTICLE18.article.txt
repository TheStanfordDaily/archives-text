# Netters Have Bad Weekend, Lose To UCLA, Edge USC
## 
### RON BECK 
'After losing to UCLA and
barely edging USC this weekend,
the Stanford tennis tepm may be
down, but don't count the squad
out just yet.
Stanford played the part of an
overly-gracious host against both
Southern California teams, and
nearly wound up being burned
twice.
Forget the fact that the Bruins
snapped the Cards' 42-game home
winning streak and their 26-game
overall winning streak. The
Bruins'own John Wooden will tell
you that streaks don't mean a
thing.
Forget the fact that USC came
close to beating a team considered
far superior. Anyone can tell you
that close only counts in
horseshoes, hand grenades, etc.
But what you can't forget is
that Stanford absolutely was
unprepared for the onslaught the
team was to face. The netters
clearly underestimated the power
of both USC and UCLA, and it

hurt.
Friday afternoon's matches
against UCLA showed that.Every
one knew that Stanford needed a
4-2 split in the afternoon to
guarantee a victory. But who
could have predicted that Gene
Mayer, previously undefeated in
Jngles at Stanford, would have to
default because of muscle spasms,
starting the team on the way to a
3-3 split.
Pat DuPre was bombed by
Ferdi Taygan in straight sets, and
Nick Saviano and Mark Mitchell
lost a three-set doubles dual for
the other two afternoon Bruin
points.
Both Jim Delaney and Bill
Maze won their singles matches
easily. Delaney and Maze played
the most consistent tennis of the
weekend, leading many observers
to wonder whether Coach Dick
Gould played the strongest
players in the right positions. But
that's another story in itself.
In the Maples matches,
witnessed by 7300 people, Nick

Saviano was beaten easly by a fairly
emotionless brian Teacher.
Teacher broke service once in
each set for a straight set win.
Martin: Superb
Then came Billy Martin.
Martin, the top-ranked amateur in
the nation, fought pretty evenly
with Whitlinger, but in the end
pulled out a 7-6, 6-4 win. Martin
exhibited an amazingly effective
lob which consistently won points
for him. Whitlinger broke Martin's
serve early for a 5-4 lead and the
serve, but Martin broke right back
and won his own service on the
way to a 7-6 first set win. Martin
held on to every serving game in
the second set to seal his own win
and a team victory.
Martin commented afterward
that he was "happy with my own
playing, but we came up here as a
team to win and we did. So that's
what I'm most happy about."
In the doubles, Delaney and
Whitlinger teamed for a
convincing, though close, 7-6, 7-6
win. Again, Delaney played far
better than a typical fourth-man
on a team.
One More Split
Against USC on Saturday, the
Cards split another set of
afternoon matches. But against
the Trojans, it was Pat DuPre who
defaulted because of injury.
DuPre's tendonitis in the right
wrist attacked him again and may
sideline him for the rest of the
season.
This time, it was the doubles
that almost did the Cards in.
Mitchell and Saviano lost again,
and Maze and Craig Johnson,
replacing the doubly injured pair
of Mayer-Du Pre, dropped a close
three-set match. In singles,
Delaney, Maze and Mitchell all
won.
At night, Saviano needed three
sets to down Bruce Manson, but
the real story was USC's number
one man, Butch Walts. Walts
displayed the best serve in college

tennis, losing only a total of four
points on his serve to Whitlinger
in a 45-minute win.
Futile Attempts
Whitlinger expressed both
amazement and futility with
Walts' serve. "I tried everything
possible on his serve," 'Whit'
explained, "but there was nothing
I could do."
Could called Walts'
performance "the best all-around
play I've ever seen." And the win
made the first doubles match the
tie-breaking match.
Whitlinger and Delaney were
up for this one, playing in style
well-deserving of their NCAA
doubles crown. Walts and Manson
fell to the pair, 6-2, 6-2.
Whitlinger, after a weekend full of
disappointments, called the
doubles win "my most gratifying
win ever."
And the happiest man on the
team, Jim Delaney, couldn't
believe the whole weekend for the
team or for himself. "I'm
frustrated with how we played as
a team, but I know, for myself,
that I'm on the way back."

close to beating a team considered
far superior. Anyone can tell you
that close only counts in
horseshoes, hand grenades, etc.
But what you can't forget is
that Stanford absolutely was
unprepared for the onslaught the
team was to face. The netters
clearly underestimated the power
of both USC and UCLA, and it

hurt.
Friday afternoon's matches
against UCLA showed that.Every
one knew that Stanford needed a
4-2 split in the afternoon to
guarantee a victory. But who
could have predicted that Gene
Mayer, previously undefeated in
Jngles at Stanford, would have to
default because of muscle spasms,
starting the team on the way to a
3-3 split.
Pat DuPre was bombed by
Ferdi Taygan in straight sets, and
Nick Saviano and Mark Mitchell
lost a three-set doubles dual for
the other two afternoon Bruin
points.
Both Jim Delaney and Bill
Maze won their singles matches
easily. Delaney and Maze played
the most consistent tennis of the
weekend, leading many observers
to wonder whether Coach Dick
Gould played the strongest
players in the right positions. But
that's another story in itself.
In the Maples matches,
witnessed by 7300 people, Nick

Saviano was beaten easly by a fairly
emotionless brian Teacher.
Teacher broke service once in
each set for a straight set win.
Martin: Superb
Then came Billy Martin.
Martin, the top-ranked amateur in
the nation, fought pretty evenly
with Whitlinger, but in the end
pulled out a 7-6, 6-4 win. Martin
exhibited an amazingly effective
lob which consistently won points
for him. Whitlinger broke Martin's
serve early for a 5-4 lead and the
serve, but Martin broke right back
and won his own service on the
way to a 7-6 first set win. Martin
held on to every serving game in
the second set to seal his own win
and a team victory.
Martin commented afterward
that he was "happy with my own
playing, but we came up here as a
team to win and we did. So that's
what I'm most happy about."
In the doubles, Delaney and
Whitlinger teamed for a
convincing, though close, 7-6, 7-6
win. Again, Delaney played far
better than a typical fourth-man
on a team.
One More Split
Against USC on Saturday, the
Cards split another set of
afternoon matches. But against
the Trojans, it was Pat DuPre who
defaulted because of injury.
DuPre's tendonitis in the right
wrist attacked him again and may
sideline him for the rest of the
season.
This time, it was the doubles
that almost did the Cards in.
Mitchell and Saviano lost again,
and Maze and Craig Johnson,
replacing the doubly injured pair
of Mayer-Du Pre, dropped a close
three-set match. In singles,
Delaney, Maze and Mitchell all
won.
At night, Saviano needed three
sets to down Bruce Manson, but
the real story was USC's number
one man, Butch Walts. Walts
displayed the best serve in college

tennis, losing only a total of four
points on his serve to Whitlinger
in a 45-minute win.
Futile Attempts
Whitlinger expressed both
amazement and futility with
Walts' serve. "I tried everything
possible on his serve," 'Whit'
explained, "but there was nothing
I could do."
Could called Walts'
performance "the best all-around
play I've ever seen." And the win
made the first doubles match the
tie-breaking match.
Whitlinger and Delaney were
up for this one, playing in style
well-deserving of their NCAA
doubles crown. Walts and Manson
fell to the pair, 6-2, 6-2.
Whitlinger, after a weekend full of
disappointments, called the
doubles win "my most gratifying
win ever."
And the happiest man on the
team, Jim Delaney, couldn't
believe the whole weekend for the
team or for himself. "I'm
frustrated with how we played as
a team, but I know, for myself,
that I'm on the way back."

starting the team on the way to a
3-3 split.
Pat DuPre was bombed by
Ferdi Taygan in straight sets, and
Nick Saviano and Mark Mitchell
lost a three-set doubles dual for
the other two afternoon Bruin
points.
Both Jim Delaney and Bill
Maze won their singles matches
easily. Delaney and Maze played
the most consistent tennis of the
weekend, leading many observers
to wonder whether Coach Dick
Gould played the strongest
players in the right positions. But
that's another story in itself.
In the Maples matches,
witnessed by 7300 people, Nick

Saviano was beaten easly by a fairly
emotionless brian Teacher.
Teacher broke service once in
each set for a straight set win.
Martin: Superb
Then came Billy Martin.
Martin, the top-ranked amateur in
the nation, fought pretty evenly
with Whitlinger, but in the end
pulled out a 7-6, 6-4 win. Martin
exhibited an amazingly effective
lob which consistently won points
for him. Whitlinger broke Martin's
serve early for a 5-4 lead and the
serve, but Martin broke right back
and won his own service on the
way to a 7-6 first set win. Martin
held on to every serving game in
the second set to seal his own win
and a team victory.
Martin commented afterward
that he was "happy with my own
playing, but we came up here as a
team to win and we did. So that's
what I'm most happy about."
In the doubles, Delaney and
Whitlinger teamed for a
convincing, though close, 7-6, 7-6
win. Again, Delaney played far
better than a typical fourth-man
on a team.
One More Split
Against USC on Saturday, the
Cards split another set of
afternoon matches. But against
the Trojans, it was Pat DuPre who
defaulted because of injury.
DuPre's tendonitis in the right
wrist attacked him again and may
sideline him for the rest of the
season.
This time, it was the doubles
that almost did the Cards in.
Mitchell and Saviano lost again,
and Maze and Craig Johnson,
replacing the doubly injured pair
of Mayer-Du Pre, dropped a close
three-set match. In singles,
Delaney, Maze and Mitchell all
won.
At night, Saviano needed three
sets to down Bruce Manson, but
the real story was USC's number
one man, Butch Walts. Walts
displayed the best serve in college

tennis, losing only a total of four
points on his serve to Whitlinger
in a 45-minute win.
Futile Attempts
Whitlinger expressed both
amazement and futility with
Walts' serve. "I tried everything
possible on his serve," 'Whit'
explained, "but there was nothing
I could do."
Could called Walts'
performance "the best all-around
play I've ever seen." And the win
made the first doubles match the
tie-breaking match.
Whitlinger and Delaney were
up for this one, playing in style
well-deserving of their NCAA
doubles crown. Walts and Manson
fell to the pair, 6-2, 6-2.
Whitlinger, after a weekend full of
disappointments, called the
doubles win "my most gratifying
win ever."
And the happiest man on the
team, Jim Delaney, couldn't
believe the whole weekend for the
team or for himself. "I'm
frustrated with how we played as
a team, but I know, for myself,
that I'm on the way back."

WEEKEND WINNERS—UCLA's Billy Martin, left, and (JSC's Butch Walts both played tremendous tennis
in Maples over the weekend. Martin's lobs and Walts' serve were too much for defending NCAA singles
champion John Whitlinger. Although Walts looked like the best of the two, last week Martin blitzed
Walts.
'After losing to UCLA and
barely edging USC this weekend,
the Stanford tennis tepm may be
down, but don't count the squad
out just yet.
Stanford played the part of an
overly-gracious host against both
Southern California teams, and
nearly wound up being burned
twice.
Forget the fact that the Bruins
snapped the Cards' 42-game home
winning streak and their 26-game
overall winning streak. The
Bruins'own John Wooden will tell

close to beating a team considered
far superior. Anyone can tell you
that close only counts in
horseshoes, hand grenades, etc.

that Stanford absolutely was
unprepared for the onslaught the
team was to face. The netters
clearly underestimated the power
of both USC and UCLA, and it

hurt.

one knew that Stanford needed a
4-2 split in the afternoon to
