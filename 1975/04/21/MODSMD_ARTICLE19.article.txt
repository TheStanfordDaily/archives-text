BERKELEYâ€”A lot of crazy things went
on this weekend, as is usually the case
when Stanford faces California in any
sport. Stanford got the bum end of most of
it.
Plagued by untimely errors and erratic
hitting, the Cardinal baseball team dropped
both ends of a doubieheader, 2-1 and 7-1,
to Berkeley's gritty grizzlies here Saturday,
but came back to vindicate the losses on
Sunken Diamond yesterday in a dramatic
'ate-inning rally, edging Cal 8-7.
Unfortunately, Cal managed to bump
the Cards out of first place in the Pac-8
Southern Division standings (deja-vu?).
USC's five-times defending national
champion Trojans are back in the lead.
Saturday's opener was the cleanest
baseball of the series. Well, almost. A 1
Arthur hurled the distance for Stanford,
allowing only four base hits, no walks and
striking out five. Cal's starter, Gene Little,
held the Cards to seven hits.
Cal's left fielder. Tim Hickerson, did all

the damage. He hit a homer in the second
with no one on base for Cal's initial run.
Then,in the bottom of the seventh, he tried
to reach third from first on a single to
shallow center field, and Bob Hampton's
throw bounced off Hickerson's back and
into Cal's ancient bleachers for the winning
unearned run.
Stanford had tied the game up in the
sixth when center fielder Hampton singled
in catcher Bruce Robinson from second.
In the nightcap, nothing went right.
Lefty John Yandle started for the
Red-and-White, and went out in the fourth
inning after allowing five runs on six hits.
Reliever Kent Caldwell gave up Cal's other
tallies when left fielder Tim Kenworthy,
who replaced Hickerson, sailed a two-run
homer over the left field fence.
Yesterday sophomore Jim
Scharffenberger started for the Cards, and
looked pretty good until a home run by
Cal catcher Tito Rael shook him up.
Stanford scored first in the first. Gary
Pitchford singled with one out, and

Robinson blasted his tenth homer of the
season over the right field fence. Cal drew
back within one when Butch Poovey
scored on a bloop single to right, in the
third and tied the game on Rael's shot in
the fourth.
Scharffenberger lasted two batters in
the fifth, giving up a double and a single,
before he was replaced by southpaw Jerry
Argust.
Argust got two Cal batters out, but the
runner on third scored on a
foul-ball-ruled-passed-ball and another run
scored on a bad throw by third baseman
Pitchford, giving Cal a 3-1 lead.
Stanford came back. Davis scored on a
triple by first baseman Tom Guardino in
the sixth, and the Cards took the lead on a
two-run blast by Hampton in the seventh,
adding two more runs on a double by
Guardino and an error by rightfielder
Alton Caesar.
Cal made it 7-5 with a home run by
Kenworthy in the eighth, and tied the
game in the top of the ninth when Rael hit

his second home run of the day, a two-run
towering fly just over the left field fence.
In the bottom of the ninth Hampton
opened the inning with a single, and Davis
and Guardino walked to load the bases.
Second baseman Joe Lamoure sliced a
clutch drive down the right field line and
Hampton came across home for the
winning run. Stanford accumulated 10 hits
and four errors.
Ed Matta, who finished the ninth for
Argust, picked up the win.
The Cardinals are now 5-4 in the Pat 8;
27-17 overall. They have a shot at first
again next week when USC travels to
Sunken Diamond for a three-game series.
