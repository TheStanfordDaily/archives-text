# Parking Fine Challengers Escape Without Paying
## 
### DEE BAER FARNETH 
Three of four Escondido Village
residents who have reported going to
court to test the legality of their
University parking tickets have
escaped without fines but failed to
gain judicial review of the University
parking system.
However, since the University
reinstituted fees for parking stickers
last January, most students receiving
parking tickets for lack of the stickers

have chosen not to challenge their
citations in court.
Those who have gone to court have
"won" because the citing officer did
not appear. Dismissal under this
condition is standard procedure under
California law.
And despite a pending compromise
plan for University parking, tickets are
still being issued and contested in
court.
Under this plan, rent monies would
no longer be used to pay for student
parking, an answer to student
complaints that they are being forced
to pay twice for parking when vehicle
registration fees are required.
Some students believe that the
non appearance of officers at contests
of tickets reflects a University policy
of avoidance of adjudication.
Steven Finkler, a graduate student
in business, was the first to go to court
with his parking citation. He went to
Santa Clara County Municipal Court
last month, surprised to learn his case
was to be the first.
A test case it was not. The judge
dismissed the case when the citing
officer did not appear.
"I wanted to make a point and the
University prevented me. The
University very intelligently prevented
having the whole parking system
overthrown. It was foolish |for the
University) to risk the whole
| parking! system on this one parking
ticket," Finkler said.
"Not true," said Stanford Public
Safety Department Director Marvin
Herrington. E\en though additional
officers were initially brought in when
the old parking plan was reinstituted.
none of them can reasonably be
expected to appear at every court case
for which he is needed, he said.
