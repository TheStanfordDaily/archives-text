# Golfers Dominate Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
For 53 holes this weekend, Stanford monopolized
its own U.S. Collegiate Invitational golf tournament.
The Cards had the longest drives and the lowest
scores. All six Stanford starters were in the top 10
after 36 holes, not to mention a seventh player
representing the JV's.
There was never a doubt about the team
championship. It was just a question of which
Stanford player would finally emerge as the
individual champion.
But on the 54th and final hole, Coach Bud Finger
frowned for the first time all weekend.
Jay Johnston, who had played par golf for 53
holes, stood in the middle of the 18th fairway after a
perfect drive. If the weekend script ran true to form,
Johnston would knock down the fiagstick with his
five-iron and tap in a short birdie putt for a
two-stroke victory' over San Jose State's Mark Lye.
Hockey Star
It would have been a classic finish: Stanford's
sixth man, better known as the leading scorer on the
Cardinal ice hockey team, upstaging his teammates
and a field of 192 to win the championship.
But it never happened.
Johnston stepped up to his ball and backed away
when he heard a camera click. He stepped up again
and pulled the shot 10 yards to the left of the green.
Still, a chip and a putt would win the tournament,
and a chip and two putts would force a playoff
between Johnston and Lye. The chip shot, though,
never reached the green. It splashed into a sand trap
between Johnston and the green. He blasted out and
two-putted for a double-bogey and a disappointing
second-place finish.
Lye, who parred the 18th hole for a final-round
69, backed in as the tournament winner. "I'm lucky
as hell," Lye said. "That's a bad way to win."
Like Harry Truman, Johnston felt too old to cry.

but hurt too much to laugh.
"I just plain didn't hit it hard enough," he said of
the chip shot that failed to clear the trip. "I was
trying to get so cute — trying to get it so close. I
should have just gone for the bogey."
Johnston's double-bogey was his first in 54 holes.
He shared the first-round lead with a two-under-par
69 on Thursday, and led by himself after Friday's 71.
His final-round 75 gave him a 215 total, one stroke
behind Lye.
There were several disappointments before the
deciding double-bogey on 18. On the seventh hole,
Johnston's ball moved two inches when he addressed
his second shot in the rough, and on the 15th his
100-yard approach shot hit between the green and a
trap and bounced backwards into the sand.
"The 15th was a key hole," Johnston said. 'I
thought I hit the shot perfect."
Easy Team Victory
Still, Stanford won the team title by a convincing
18 shots, coming within a stroke of the tournament
record with an 873 total. It was the Cards' sixth
straight victory and seventh in eight years, while San
Jose State finished second for the sixth straight year,
this time at 891.
UC-Irvine finished third at 895, while the
remainder of the 32-team field was far off the pace.
Individually, six Cardinals placed in the top 10.
Defending champion Dave Baskins finished third at
217 (69-75-73), while freshman Mike Peck shot
71-71-77 —219 for a fourth-place finish.
George Pettinger, Aly Trompas and Bruce Cardinal
of the JV's tied for seventh at 222. Pettinger shot
71-74-77, Trompas shot 74-72-76 and Cardinal led his
team to a respectable ninth-place finish with rounds
of 74-73-75.
Conrad Nilmeier, playing his first tournament after
minor throat surgery, was the only Stanford starter
out of the top 10. He shot 74-73-81—228.

BEFORE THE FALL—Stanford golfer Jay Johnston
looked like he was on the way to a sure win in the
U.S. Collegiate Invitational played here over the
weekend, but a funny thing happened on the final
hole. Johnston finished in second behind San Jose
State's Mark Lye.
