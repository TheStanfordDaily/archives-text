# Spikers 'Blown-Out' By Fast Trojans
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
BERKELEY-UCLA gave four
of its top track stars a rest,' but
still won its 34th straight dual
meet â€” an 88-57 victory over
California, and USC had its first
"blow-out" of the season, a
113-30 scorching of Stanford, in
Saturday's Pacific-Eight
double-dual meet at the Bears'
Edwards Stadium.
For the Bruins and Trojans, the
top two dual meet teams in the
nation, the meet was a final tune
up for their May 3rd showdown,
but they followed different
strategies.
The double dual allowed
UCLA Coach Jim Bush to give his
Bruins a rest from their most
demanding schedule in two years.
USC mentor Vern Wolfe wanted
his Trojans to hang it out for the
first time this year, and that's just
what they did, handing Stanford
its second worse loss in the series.
Were the Trojans trying to
humiliate the Cards? Wolfe had an
answer. "We weren't trying to
humiliate anyone. This was our
first meet where it wasn't cold or
raining and we had to have one
big blow-out before UCLA."
So Stanford was literally blown
out of Edwards' Stadium. The
bright spots were few and far
between for the Cards. But one of
these was the performance of the
Stanford distance crew, which
picked up more than half of the
Card's points.

Steve Crowley, Jeff Parietti
and Mark McConnell combined for
a Card sweep of the mile run.
Crowley won his second mile run
in a row with a 4:11.0, while
Parietti and McConnell clocked
lifetime bests.
But there was a plethora of
dark moments for Stanford. The
Cards, already hobbled by injuries
to long jumper James Lofton and
hurdler Dave Bagshaw, added two
more to the injury list.
Pac-8 intermediate hurdles king
Matt Hogsett may be out for the
rest of the season after suffering a
deep muscle pull. Hogsett came
up limp on the eighth hurdle of his
race and had to be helped from
the track. Distance man Stacy
Geiken injured his foot in the
three mile and had to drop out of
the race. The injuries were costly.
Hogsett would have picked up a
second and Geiken would have
completed a Card sweep in the
three mile.
By the end of the meet the
Cards were so thin that they had
to use a pair of distance men in
the mile relay. The result was a
220-yard USC victory in the relay.
Although meet organizers tried
to discourage direct competition
between USC and UCLA, the
Trojans would have won 79-64,
on the basis of comparative times.
The Stanford-California
score?? Don't even ask.
Oh well, there's always cross
country.
