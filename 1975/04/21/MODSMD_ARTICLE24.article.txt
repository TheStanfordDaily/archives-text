Another Viet City Imperiled
SAIGON — North Vietnamese tanks and assault
troops attacked the provincial capital of Ham Tan
City at dawn today in their continuing sweep down
the central coast, the Saigon command reported.
The fall of Ham Tan as the capital of Binh Tuy
Province would mean the loss of 20 of South
Vietnam's 44 provinces to the North
Vietnamese-Viet Cong since mid-March.
Communist led forces kept up shelling attacks on
Bien Hoa air base, 15 miles northeast of Saigon.
Fifteen rounds of artillery hit the base but caused
no casualties or damages, the Saigon command said.
The Communist side now controls about
three-fourths of South Vietnam's land mass and
about one-third of the 20 million population. In
Saigon, hundreds of Americans and their
Vietnamese wives and children were evacuated.
A U.S. official estimated about 700 persons left
Saigon yesterday, including American contractors
and their families, leaving fewer than 3000
Americans here.
Meanwhile the anti-Communist position in
Cambodia continues to deteriorate. To the cheers Of
local residents, several hundred Khmer Rouge
soldiers marched unopposed into the town of Poipet
along Cambodia's border with Thailand yesterday, a
newsman reported from the frontier.
Meanwhile, the news blackout from the
Cambodian capital moved into its fourth day. The
fate of a number of leaders of the former
government as well as Western newsmen and other
foreigners remained uncertain.
The French newspaper Le Monde reported
Saturday that the Khmer Rouge were holding
former Premier Long Boret, Lon Non, the brother
of Lon Nol, and several former generals and cabinet
ministers.

But a Khmer Rouge broadcast monitored
Saturday claimed most of the top former leadership
had been beheaded.
In Washington, evacuation money and
humanitarian aid for South Vietnam is expected to
get Congress' approval this week, but President
Ford's military aid request remains stalled.
Both the House and Senate are to vote on similar
evacuation and humanitarian aid bills tomorrow
afternoon and thus would have the rest of the week
to work out a final Compromise bill.
Castro Death Plot Revealed
NEW YORK — Convicted Watergate burglar
Frank Sturgis says he plotted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in 1959 while working with the CIA but
dropped the plan after failing to get the "green
light" from Washington, the New York Daily News
reported yesterday.
The News said Sturgis worked as a gun-runner for
Castro and, within a period of months, was
recruited by the CIA to participate in assassination
plots in Cuba and elsewhere.
Moroccan King Cancels Visit
RABAT, Morocco — King Hassan of Morocco,
currently chairman of the Arab League, has
canceled an official visit to Washington that was
scheduled to begin tomorrow, according to official
Moroccan sources. They said a major reason was the
collapse of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's
Middle East peace efforts.
An American Embassy spokesman said the trip
was "postponed" at the king's request, amid
Moroccan assurances that this did not reflect any
deterioration in the traditionally friendly relations
between the two countries.
However, in Washington, long-term arrangement
for the United States to receive oil from Saudi

Arabia at a fixed price in return for industrial
expertise is a possibility, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani
said yesterday.
He declined to say at what level the price of the
oil might be set, but indicated that the agreement
wouid cover all the oil needed by this country.
He said negotiations are under way covering the
industrialization of Saudi Arabia, which is the prime
requisite for the agreement.

Saigon, hundreds of Americans and their
Vietnamese wives and children were evacuated.
A U.S. official estimated about 700 persons left
Saigon yesterday, including American contractors
and their families, leaving fewer than 3000
Americans here.
Meanwhile the anti-Communist position in
Cambodia continues to deteriorate. To the cheers Of
local residents, several hundred Khmer Rouge
soldiers marched unopposed into the town of Poipet
along Cambodia's border with Thailand yesterday, a
newsman reported from the frontier.
Meanwhile, the news blackout from the
Cambodian capital moved into its fourth day. The
fate of a number of leaders of the former
government as well as Western newsmen and other
foreigners remained uncertain.
The French newspaper Le Monde reported
Saturday that the Khmer Rouge were holding
former Premier Long Boret, Lon Non, the brother
of Lon Nol, and several former generals and cabinet
ministers.

But a Khmer Rouge broadcast monitored
Saturday claimed most of the top former leadership
had been beheaded.
In Washington, evacuation money and
humanitarian aid for South Vietnam is expected to
get Congress' approval this week, but President
Ford's military aid request remains stalled.
Both the House and Senate are to vote on similar
evacuation and humanitarian aid bills tomorrow
afternoon and thus would have the rest of the week
to work out a final Compromise bill.

dropped the plan after failing to get the "green
light" from Washington, the New York Daily News

Moroccan King Cancels Visit
RABAT, Morocco — King Hassan of Morocco,
currently chairman of the Arab League, has
canceled an official visit to Washington that was
scheduled to begin tomorrow, according to official
Moroccan sources. They said a major reason was the
collapse of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's
Middle East peace efforts.
An American Embassy spokesman said the trip
was "postponed" at the king's request, amid
Moroccan assurances that this did not reflect any
deterioration in the traditionally friendly relations
between the two countries.
However, in Washington, long-term arrangement
for the United States to receive oil from Saudi

Arabia at a fixed price in return for industrial
expertise is a possibility, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani
said yesterday.
He declined to say at what level the price of the
oil might be set, but indicated that the agreement
wouid cover all the oil needed by this country.
He said negotiations are under way covering the
industrialization of Saudi Arabia, which is the prime
requisite for the agreement.

the building of this library will begin immediately,"
it said.

SAIGON — North Vietnamese tanks and assault
troops attacked the provincial capital of Ham Tan
City at dawn today in their continuing sweep down
the central coast, the Saigon command reported.

Vietnamese-Viet Cong since mid-March.
Communist led forces kept up shelling attacks on
Bien Hoa air base, 15 miles northeast of Saigon.
Fifteen rounds of artillery hit the base but caused
no casualties or damages, the Saigon command said.
The Communist side now controls about
three-fourths of South Vietnam's land mass and
about one-third of the 20 million population. In
Saigon, hundreds of Americans and their
