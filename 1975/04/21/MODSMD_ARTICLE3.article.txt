Harvard Government Prof.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, named as
Commencement speaker here, is
likely to replace John A. Scali as
the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, the Associated Press
reported an administration source
as saying last night.
Moynihan recently returned to
his teaching position at Harvard
after serving as U.S. ambassador in
India.
He recently told reporters the
United States should change its role
in world affairs and not continue
"to sit pensively and take a beating
from the majority."
His selection as Commencement
speaker has been challenged by a
majority of Anthropology
Department faculty here and by all
but seven graduating black seniors
who claim that Moynihan is "a
person . . . not acceptable to either
the black community or the more
thoughtful sectors of other ethnic
communities."
