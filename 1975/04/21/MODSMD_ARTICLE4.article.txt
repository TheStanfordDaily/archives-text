# System Works Despite Bugs
## Computer Voting 'Here To Stay' 
### JOHN FREED 
Despite a few problems, the ASSU's
computerized voting system which
debuted last week will be here to stay
if ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald has anything to say about
it.
"I was very pleased with | the
system|," Fitzgerald said yesterday."I
haven't gotten any personal
complaints. I don't think it
discouraged many people [from
voting| — over 3300 people voted."
The new system permitted counting
all the ballots twice in about three
hours. The first run through the
computer took about two-and-a-half
hours, Fitzgerald reported, because the
machine stopped each time it
encountered a ballot with an
abstention.
Election workers took such ballots

from the hopper and checked to see if
a mark was made too lightly. If so,
they filled it in. If not, they filled in a
"non-vote" box on the ballot measure.
Most of the delay was caused by
such abstentions, according to
Fitzgerald.
"The first run took about
two-and-a-half hours. The last run
took only 35 minutes, after the ballots
had been screened," he said.
Fitzgerald estimated that about 10
percent of all ballots had a non-vote
on at least one measure. As a result, a
non-vote box will be included for each
measure during voting this Wednesday
and Thursday.
The workers examined ballots with
non-votes in front of a representative
from each Council of Presidents slate.
Representatives from groups
seeking fee assessments were not
permitted in the computer room
because the room was too small,
according to Fitzgerald.
Mike Domheim, Chaparral editor
and a co-terminal in mathematics and
aeronautics-astronautics, attacked the
computer-tally system as "miserable."
"The machine .. . used is the
Hewlett-Packard 21168 in the
Electronics Research Laboratory,"
Domheim said. "Anyone familiar with
this machine can only laugh at its
use."
Domheim explained that the part
of the computer which actually "read"
the ballots was only "about 75-80
percent reliable."
Fitzgerald responded that the tallies
in the two computer run-throughs
were very close.
"The first count either didn't differ
or differed by one vote" from the
second count, Fitzgerald remarked.
However, the result of a constitutional
amendment on "sexist wording"
currently rests defeated by a margin of
one "no" vote.

Fitzgerald said he has no plans to
recount that measure by hand.
"The overseas ballots will be
coming in," which could swing the
vote, Fitzgerald explained. "I don't
think we'll recount."

coming in," which could swing the
vote, Fitzgerald explained. "I don't
think we'll recount."
Despite a few problems, the ASSU's
computerized voting system which
debuted last week will be here to stay
if ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald has anything to say about
it.
"I was very pleased with | the
system|," Fitzgerald said yesterday."I
haven't gotten any personal
complaints. I don't think it
discouraged many people [from
voting| — over 3300 people voted."
The new system permitted counting
all the ballots twice in about three
hours. The first run through the
computer took about two-and-a-half
hours, Fitzgerald reported, because the
machine stopped each time it
encountered a ballot with an
abstention.
Election workers took such ballots

from the hopper and checked to see if
a mark was made too lightly. If so,
they filled it in. If not, they filled in a
"non-vote" box on the ballot measure.
Most of the delay was caused by
such abstentions, according to
Fitzgerald.
"The first run took about
two-and-a-half hours. The last run
took only 35 minutes, after the ballots
had been screened," he said.
Fitzgerald estimated that about 10
percent of all ballots had a non-vote
on at least one measure. As a result, a
non-vote box will be included for each
measure during voting this Wednesday
and Thursday.
The workers examined ballots with
non-votes in front of a representative
from each Council of Presidents slate.
Representatives from groups
seeking fee assessments were not
permitted in the computer room
because the room was too small,
according to Fitzgerald.
Mike Domheim, Chaparral editor
and a co-terminal in mathematics and
aeronautics-astronautics, attacked the
computer-tally system as "miserable."
"The machine .. . used is the
Hewlett-Packard 21168 in the
Electronics Research Laboratory,"
Domheim said. "Anyone familiar with
this machine can only laugh at its
use."
Domheim explained that the part
of the computer which actually "read"
the ballots was only "about 75-80
percent reliable."
Fitzgerald responded that the tallies
in the two computer run-throughs
were very close.
"The first count either didn't differ
or differed by one vote" from the
second count, Fitzgerald remarked.
However, the result of a constitutional
amendment on "sexist wording"
currently rests defeated by a margin of
one "no" vote.

Fitzgerald said he has no plans to
recount that measure by hand.
"The overseas ballots will be
coming in," which could swing the
vote, Fitzgerald explained. "I don't
think we'll recount."
