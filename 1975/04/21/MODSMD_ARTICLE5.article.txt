# 263 Freshmen Denied On-Campus Housing

### RICHARD FEARON 
Some 263 freshmen who requested
guaranteed housing for next year have
been denied such status in the first
year of the University's Guaranteed
Housing Program.
According to senior Richard Wales,
in charge of computer processing for
the housing draw, approximately 94
percent of the current freshman class
applied for guaranteed sophomore
housing but only 75 could be given
assured spots. As a consequence, 156
men and 107 women were not given
guarantees.
Everyone who requested
guaranteed junior and senior years —
approximately six percent of both
men and. women — was granted his
preference, said Wales.
Wales said that the guaranteed years
were assigned by a random computer
sorting process. It made no difference
whether one turned in his card early or
late.
"It didn't give advantages or
disadvantages to anybody," Wales said
of the system. "Nobody was out to get
anybody."
Allowed To Switch
Under the present policy of the
housing office, students dissatisfied
with their guaranteed years will be
allowed to switch with another
student.
"We're not going to encourage it,"
stated Susan Espinosa, administrative
assistant in the housing office, "but if
two of them can get up to my office
before Friday, they will be allowed to
trade."

This year's draw, which starts
tomorrow, will not be held in the Old
Union as announced earlier. It is now
scneduled to be conducted in the
music-listening room on the second
floor of Trejidder Union.
Cards Out Today
At any time from 9 to 12 p.m. and
1 to 4 p.m. through Friday, students
wishing to participate may take draw
materials — their draw cards and any
priority cards they may wish to submit
— to the music listening room and pick
a draw number. Today, draw cards are
being distributed to all students in
University residences.

Larry Horton, associate dean of
student affairs for housing, said the
large number of students requesting
campus housing for next year did not
come as a surprise to his office.
"I anticipated that probably more
people would want their sophomore
year than we could grant. The reason
we can only grant 75 percent is
because any extra would come out of
the other classes' allotted numbers."
Placement
Currently, the housing office
expects to place 60 to 66 percent of
next year's juniors and seniors on
