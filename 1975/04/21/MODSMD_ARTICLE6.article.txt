# Four Slates To Compete In Senior Officers Runoff
## 
### JOHN FREED 
A four-way runoff this Wednesday
and Thursday wi'l decide the winner in
the senior class officers race, ASSU
Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald decided Friday.
According to Fitzgerald, two slates
may have overspent the campaigning
limit in the ASSU bylaws. These slates,
headed by Dan Poston and Lyse
Strnad, finished first and second in the
balloting last week.
"The bylaws are ambiguous,"
Fitzgerald said. "The wording is
something like ... 'candidates for
president . . . may spend up to $200.
All other candidates may spend up to
$50.' "
The controversy centers around
whether individual candidates on
senior class slates can spend $50 each,
or whether each slate is limited to $50.
The bylaws do not spell out the
answer, Fitzgerald reported.
"There is nothing that concerns
finances in the section [of the bylaws]
on senior class presidents," Fitzgerald
said.
The slate which picks up the most
votes Wednesday and Thursday will be
declared the winner, regardless of
whether it receives more than half of
all votes cast. Fitzgerald said that 13

ASSU senators he contacted Friday
had agreed to the plan.
ASSU Sen. Lee Peterson explained
why she went along.
"I guess that's the only thing you
can do, because he [Fitzgerald]
screwed up," she commented. "It's an
unfortunate mistake.. . . That's the
fairest way to do it."
According to Fitzgerald, two slates
"assumed" the spending limit was
$200, while the other four "operated
under different rules." But Poston said
that Fitzgeraid had given the go-ahead
on the $200 limit.
"I personally asked Fitzgerald what
the limits were, and he responded
$200," Poston asserted. "We are a
little upset over the stigma of
'cheating,' since we were just trying to
comply with the rules."
Fitzgerald set an interim spending
limit of $85 to be retroactive over the
entire campaign.
"The first two slates that won spent
in the range of $60-70. ... I've put a
limit on spending at $85. That's for
the whole two weeks," Fitzgerald
remarked.
The Senate's bylaws committee will
receive suggestions on clarification of
the spending limit, Fitzgerald
promised, but the figures have not yet
been decided upon.
"I haven't figured out an amount
for this, because I haven't looked at
the financial statements" from thi â€ž
year's candidates, Fitzgerald said.
The four-way runoff was decided
on after consultation with the slates
involved, according to Fitzgerald, who
explained that only the top four slates
were considered.
"The last two slates wouldn't have
been in the runoff even if the top tw<
slates had been disqualified,"
Fitzgerald stated. "It didn't seem fair
to me to eliminate the winning two
slates. It also didn't seem fair to
disqualify the other [two]."
