# Author Jabs At Poetry, Politicians
## Mailer Spars With Crowd 
### DAVE SMITH 
BERKELEY—Norman Mailer piles 10 books on the
Zellerbaeh Auditorium podium. ("One of them's not even
by me," he mumbles.) He looks over the audience like a
college professor about to begin his lecture. But Mailer's
style is like that of a boxer.
"The subject of my talk today will be 'From Poetry to
Espionage,' " he says. The crowd roars. "It's a very difficult
subject." Mailer grins sheepishly.
After a few jabs at famous personalities, Mailer reads
Ezra Pound's standards for good poetry, then reads some
good poetry. Next he reads some of his own poetry.
"It may not be a good poem," he says after reciting his
story of a drunk who has just thrown up in the foyer after a
party, "but we'll all agree it's a poem." There are some
objections from the audience.
But then he reads a poem that is even worse. "Now this
is nothing," he says, "but suppose we were told that Robert
Lowell wrote this. Lowell is not a man to kid around. Right
away we have to start looking for things in it, things that
aren't there.
Get Nothing
"We expend all our energy trying to give it meaning, but
we get nothing back," he continues. "It has no resonance.
It's like a black hole absorbing our energies. It becomes an
obsession."
So much for poetry. "Our history in the last 12 years is
like the bad poem," says Mailer. "Why do you think people
spend so much time carefully reading the newspapers?
Because they want some clue, some fact that will show that
it all makes sense."
He cites the assassinations of the 1960s as historical
events that have no apparent meaning and yet have become
the subject of some people's obsessions. "The natural result
of an obsession held for too long is apathy," he continues.
"The jealous man can only be jealous for so long; after that

he hasn't got the energy to care any more, and he's lost the
capacity to feel that way ever again.
Assassinations
"So I hesitate to think how much damage to our psychic
health each assassination has done," he says. "Everyone
wants life to resemble an unwritten novel, a novel that has
resonance. But when too many things don't make sense, we
can't function to our full capacity any more."
But now comes a chance for the crowd to spar with the
heavyweight writing champion. Was Marilyn a crass exercise
iri writing for money? No, says Mailer, and nobody thought
that way until Mike Wallace, "a contemptible cocksucker of
a man," edited Mailer's interview on CBS's 60 Minutes
What does he think of Scoop Jackson? "A frightening
man . . . meeting him is like encountering a pall." Eugene
McCarthy? "The most intelligent politician around, and he
knows it." Nelson Rockefeller? "An evil man. Rockefeller
knew the good at Attica, and he deliberately did what, was
wrong, because he knew if he did right he'd never be
president."
Abortion Murder
Why is Mailer pro-abortion? "I'm against the thought
that a woman might have a baby she doesn't want," he
says."I agree with the Catholics that abortion is murder,
but some things are worse than murder."
He cites the 55-mile per hour speed limit as an example.
"Highways are so horribly dull," he states, "that it's really
damaging for some people to go under 70 on them. We may
save 100 lives, but we blight 10 million ever so slightly."
But wait — isn't Norman Mailer a novelist? What about
his new novel?
He smiles. "That's not something to talk about in
public," he says. "It' 6 like describing you- wife to an
audience of strangers."
Like his favorite fighters, Norman Mailer knows how to
duck the hard ones with style.

style is like that of a boxer.
"The subject of my talk today will be 'From Poetry to
Espionage,' " he says. The crowd roars. "It's a very difficult
subject." Mailer grins sheepishly.
After a few jabs at famous personalities, Mailer reads
Ezra Pound's standards for good poetry, then reads some
good poetry. Next he reads some of his own poetry.
"It may not be a good poem," he says after reciting his
story of a drunk who has just thrown up in the foyer after a
party, "but we'll all agree it's a poem." There are some
objections from the audience.
But then he reads a poem that is even worse. "Now this
is nothing," he says, "but suppose we were told that Robert
Lowell wrote this. Lowell is not a man to kid around. Right
away we have to start looking for things in it, things that
aren't there.
Get Nothing
"We expend all our energy trying to give it meaning, but
we get nothing back," he continues. "It has no resonance.
It's like a black hole absorbing our energies. It becomes an
obsession."
So much for poetry. "Our history in the last 12 years is
like the bad poem," says Mailer. "Why do you think people
spend so much time carefully reading the newspapers?
Because they want some clue, some fact that will show that
it all makes sense."
He cites the assassinations of the 1960s as historical
events that have no apparent meaning and yet have become
the subject of some people's obsessions. "The natural result
of an obsession held for too long is apathy," he continues.
"The jealous man can only be jealous for so long; after that

he hasn't got the energy to care any more, and he's lost the
capacity to feel that way ever again.
Assassinations
"So I hesitate to think how much damage to our psychic
health each assassination has done," he says. "Everyone
wants life to resemble an unwritten novel, a novel that has
resonance. But when too many things don't make sense, we
can't function to our full capacity any more."
But now comes a chance for the crowd to spar with the
heavyweight writing champion. Was Marilyn a crass exercise
iri writing for money? No, says Mailer, and nobody thought
that way until Mike Wallace, "a contemptible cocksucker of
a man," edited Mailer's interview on CBS's 60 Minutes
What does he think of Scoop Jackson? "A frightening
man . . . meeting him is like encountering a pall." Eugene
McCarthy? "The most intelligent politician around, and he
knows it." Nelson Rockefeller? "An evil man. Rockefeller
knew the good at Attica, and he deliberately did what, was
wrong, because he knew if he did right he'd never be
president."
Abortion Murder
Why is Mailer pro-abortion? "I'm against the thought
that a woman might have a baby she doesn't want," he
says."I agree with the Catholics that abortion is murder,
but some things are worse than murder."
He cites the 55-mile per hour speed limit as an example.
"Highways are so horribly dull," he states, "that it's really
damaging for some people to go under 70 on them. We may
save 100 lives, but we blight 10 million ever so slightly."
But wait — isn't Norman Mailer a novelist? What about
his new novel?
He smiles. "That's not something to talk about in
public," he says. "It' 6 like describing you- wife to an
audience of strangers."
Like his favorite fighters, Norman Mailer knows how to
duck the hard ones with style.
