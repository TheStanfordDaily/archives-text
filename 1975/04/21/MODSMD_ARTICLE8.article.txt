Last week, students approved seven of the nine fee
assessments requested by campus organizations. For most
students, this will be the end of their association with the
fee assessment process this time around, despite the fact that
all assessments are refundable.
The reason for this is that the current system makes it
difficult for students who do not want to pay for a certain
service to get their money back. In order to obtain refunds,
students must appear at the ASSU office during specified
hours on a small number of days during a quarter.
To make it more easily possible for students to obtain
refunds, we propose that a registration day check-off system
be instituted. Under the plan we suggest, students would be
able, perhaps by going to a special window, to "check off"
one or more assessments from their permits-to-register and
immediately get their refunds.
Opponents of this plan argue that this would encourage
students to get their money back on all assessments, thus
depriving organizations of necessary funds. We think,
however, that students here are mature enough to selectively
judge whether various services are worth their dollars, and
that even under this plan, at least some groups would be
well-funded.
We realize that there might be some technical problems
with the system we propose, and that it would add to
registration day confusion. We hope that the University and
ASSU could work out some equitable system of funding the
increased paperwork that a check-off system might require.
In general, however, we think a system such as the one
we have proposed would be superior to the present system.
Fee assessments should be paid by students who think the
services provided are worth it, and those who don't agree
shouldn't be forced, through red tape, to pay.
