# OpposeC-15 Plan

I urge students to vote NO on
the Committee of Fifteen (C-15)
proposal to restructure the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP).
When the CJP was created in
1971, the composition of the CJP
was only one of four objections
students raised about the judicial
system. The other objections
concerned the rights of students,
the role of the University
president and the kinds of cases
the CJP adjudicated.
Other Objections
Students demanded that:
— no proceedings be
undertaken which contravene in
any way the guarantees of
individual rights contained in the
constitutions of the United States
and the state of California;
— the role of the University
president be limited to granting
amnesty and commuting
sentences, and
— the judicial system not place
academic penalties on students for
their behavior in non-academic
areas.
The C-15 proposal merely
changes the composition of the
CJP. It does not guarantee
students their constitutional
rights. It leaves intact Article IV
of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter, which gives President
Richard W. Lyman the right to do
anything he wants to do (recall
he used Article IV to create the
current CJP). And it permits the
CJP to suspend and expel students
for political advocacy.
For all these reasons, I oppose
the C-15 proposal.
Judicial System History
The purpose of the CJP is to
insulate the administration from
blame for disciplinary actions and
to punish those who challenge the
administration's authority. This
purpose is hidden when there is
little or no political activity on
campus. The purpose becomes
clear, as it did in 1967-72, when
there is a lot of political activity.
In October 1967, Lyman
compared peaceful sit-ins at
Stanford (protesting the Central
Intelligence Agency) with
peaceful sit-ins at lunch counters
in the South: "Sit-ins here would
only test the University's right to
discipline the sit-inners."
In April 1971, Lyman revealed
what had been University policy
since the Encina Hall sit-in of
1969: sit-ins, he said, are "not an
acceptable form of political action
within the University" and "will
be brought to an end as soon as
possible."
Lyman's method of ending
sit-ins involves the simultaneous
use of the CJP (or SJC, as it was

called) and the police against
peaceful demonstrations that
violate neither the campus
disruptions policy, nor the laws of
the state of California. Rather
than deter violent behavior, this
method tends to provoke violent
behavior.
For example, Lyman brought
in the police to end two peaceful
sit-ins in April 1970. He also
prosecuted those arrested before
the SJC. All charges against the
demonstrators were thrown out of
both criminal court and the SJC,
because the demonstrators had
done nothing wrong.
But ending the first sit-in
resulted in $40,000 worth of
broken windows, when the
demonstrators responded to
police brutality. Ending the
second sit-in resulted in a battle
between over 1000 students and
over 250 police.
The proponents, supporters,
and apologists for the CJP need a
lie-man to convince students to
support an unfair judicial system.
A fair judicial system can exist
only without a Lyman. Vote NO.

I urge students to vote NO on
the Committee of Fifteen (C-15)
proposal to restructure the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP).
When the CJP was created in
1971, the composition of the CJP
was only one of four objections
students raised about the judicial
system. The other objections
concerned the rights of students,
the role of the University
president and the kinds of cases
the CJP adjudicated.
Other Objections
Students demanded that:
— no proceedings be
undertaken which contravene in
any way the guarantees of
individual rights contained in the
constitutions of the United States
and the state of California;
— the role of the University
president be limited to granting
amnesty and commuting
sentences, and
— the judicial system not place
academic penalties on students for
their behavior in non-academic
areas.
The C-15 proposal merely
changes the composition of the
CJP. It does not guarantee
students their constitutional
rights. It leaves intact Article IV
of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter, which gives President
Richard W. Lyman the right to do
anything he wants to do (recall
he used Article IV to create the
current CJP). And it permits the
CJP to suspend and expel students
for political advocacy.
For all these reasons, I oppose
the C-15 proposal.
Judicial System History
The purpose of the CJP is to
insulate the administration from
blame for disciplinary actions and
to punish those who challenge the
administration's authority. This
purpose is hidden when there is
little or no political activity on
campus. The purpose becomes
clear, as it did in 1967-72, when
there is a lot of political activity.
In October 1967, Lyman
compared peaceful sit-ins at
Stanford (protesting the Central
Intelligence Agency) with
peaceful sit-ins at lunch counters
in the South: "Sit-ins here would
only test the University's right to
discipline the sit-inners."
In April 1971, Lyman revealed
what had been University policy
since the Encina Hall sit-in of
1969: sit-ins, he said, are "not an
acceptable form of political action
within the University" and "will
be brought to an end as soon as
possible."
Lyman's method of ending
sit-ins involves the simultaneous
use of the CJP (or SJC, as it was

called) and the police against
peaceful demonstrations that
violate neither the campus
disruptions policy, nor the laws of
the state of California. Rather
than deter violent behavior, this
method tends to provoke violent
behavior.
For example, Lyman brought
in the police to end two peaceful
sit-ins in April 1970. He also
prosecuted those arrested before
the SJC. All charges against the
demonstrators were thrown out of
both criminal court and the SJC,
because the demonstrators had
done nothing wrong.
But ending the first sit-in
resulted in $40,000 worth of
broken windows, when the
demonstrators responded to
police brutality. Ending the
second sit-in resulted in a battle
between over 1000 students and
over 250 police.
The proponents, supporters,
and apologists for the CJP need a
lie-man to convince students to
support an unfair judicial system.
A fair judicial system can exist
only without a Lyman. Vote NO.

of the ASSU Senate in 1971-72.)
