# COP Slates Seek Student Support
## Vote Rosenbaum 
### 
Stanford students know about
as much as (if not more than)
they want to about this campaign.
The issues are well defined and
well publicized. And we've just
about spent our $200. So you
won't see us in the bathroom
again.
What we want to do here is
clear up a few things. The
slate is giving you some
misinformation. Take the Course
Review. In our platform, we
provide a concrete plan for an
expanded, quarterly, free Course
Review. Voting against it in the
ASSU Senate was a refusal to be
coerced by its former editors —
who couldn't even agree on why
they wanted your money.
Take the trustees. Students
should sit on the Ad Hoc Budget
Committee. Both slates agree on
that. But a student should also sit
on the Board itself. Student
opinion isn't always reflected in
committee decisions. We need a
student on the Board to represent
us. Of course the trustees won't
like the idea of a student invading
their ranks. But it can be done. It
happened at the University of
California because of strong
student lobbying.
Students don't have to ask the
trustees or administration what
they're allowed to do. We can set
our own goals and work toward
them. There's a difference
between working with the
administration — being co-opted
by it — and working through it to
meet those goals. We prefer the
latter.
We have a broad base of
support among students. Since
last week's election, we have been
endorsed by the Jameson, Lopez
and Weiss (Hammer and Coffin)
slates. We've also got a long list of
endorsements which includes a
majority of the ASSU Senate.
You must have seen that list if
you passed through White Plaza
last Wednesday or Thursday.
We've got the experience.
We've got the programs. And
we've got the support of a lot of
students. Vote for
Rosenbaum-Jaramillo-Gal
ligan-Germane. For once, Brand X
is better.
(Lee Rosen bail m, Josie Jaramillo,
Dave Galligan and Charlotte
Germane are candidates for the
ASSU Council of Presidents.)

I was favorably impressed by a
number of the ideas that the

various Council of President slates
came up with. But the group that
seems to have put in the most
work, and that seems to really
know what it's talking about, is
Rosenbaum-Jaramillo-Galligan-
Germane.
A perfect example of this is
what they have proposed to do
with the Course Review. Even
though the Course Review is a
great idea it has not been as
effective as it could have been.
Coming out in the spring and
costing a dollar are two of its
biggest problems. And when you
remember that it's the professor
in each class that hands out the
forms you might start to wonder
about just how unbiased the
results are.
What Rosenbaum et al. have
said they will do is make the
Course Review free and give it out
at pre-reg every quarter. I don't
think this will cost too much
(look at all the useless paper the
ASSU puts out and look at things
like the SWOPSI schedule) and
what it does cost will be worth it.
At least then people could use it.
They also want to get students
to distribute and pick up the
forms. Again this will cost some
bucks but I, for one, feel it is
worth it. Maybe some of the
profits from things like the lecture
notes could be used for this.
The last part of their Course
Review proposal is to make the
Course Review forms the official
course evaluation and start trying
to get the question of teaching
ability really introduced into
tenure decisions.
Now this is not going to be
easy but if anyone can do it then
this slate can — after all they
worked on SWOPSI and minority
aid, and they seem to have more
experience than the other group
by a long shot.
Kevin McDermott and those
Daily people didn't have all that
much to say; in fact, they didn't
even mention the Course Review.
All in all it seems pretty clear
to me. There is only one slate that
not only seems to know the nitty
gritty but also has the experience
and the will to really get things
done. I urge everyone to vote for
Rosen baum-Jara mill o-Galligan-
Germane.
