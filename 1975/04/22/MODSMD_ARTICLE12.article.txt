We need your help.
Throughout this campaign we
have been proposing and
discussing solutions to student
problems that we can implement
during our year as ASSU Council
of Presidents.
We have done a great deal of
research into our proposals for
surveys, a night eatery, a
commuter transit line, an open
University committee system and
more. In the past few weeks, we
have come door-to-door and
received much positive feedback
on our ideas as well as your
suggestions for additional changes.
This is the type of
representative government we
want to bring to the ASSU and
this is the type of responsive
government you deserve.
Surveys
Take our surveys proposal.
Personal contact surveys,
including both multiple choice
and open-ended questions, bring
your opinion not only to the
Council of Presidents, but also to
your representatives on University
committees. Your opinion should
be known before important
decisions are made.
Students should have had a
chance to speak up before
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz axed
club sports and before the
University decided to put the
emeriti housing project on the
Row. Student representatives
should also have access to student
opinion so that they can
accurately represent students.
Students should also have
opportunities to talk directly to
their committee representatives
and the Council of Presidents. We
will hold open forums and open
office hours so that concerned
students can express their
opinions and get results.
Inflexible Plan
Our opponents have proposed
an inflexible, cumbersome "house
of representatives" as their only
way of reaching you. This type of
committee was rejected by the
ASSU years ago because
individual house representatives
often did not care enough to
come to meetings.
Minorities also objected to the
"house" plan because they were
severely under-represented. Under
our opponents'plan, virtually the
only minority representation
would come from the four
minority theme houses. If the Lee
Rosenbaum slate had only
researched their proposal fully,
they would have found these

serious flaws.
We have been accused of not
researching our financial "big
bucks" policy carefully enough.
And our opponents have done
everything possible to confuse this
complex issue. Our research shows
the ASSU can and we feel it
should operate on a non-profit
basis.
The Facts
The fact is the ASSU will make
from $135,000 to $150,000 in
profit this year alone. Even if the
University removed its $90,000
support from the ASSU (and the
University won't stop funds for
another couple years), under its
present system the ASSU could
easily cover office expenses with
at least $45,000 to spare.
Not to mention that the ASSU
will have roughly a quarter of a
million dollars in reserves at the
end of this year. Invested at even
five percent (a minimum rate),
that's still a significant amount of
money the ASSU can use either to
help support itself or use as "seed
money."
Now let's turn to a few of the
proposals coming from our
opponents. The Rosenbaum slate
suggests that all the best classes
shouldn't be at 10 and 11. But the
ASSU Council of Presidents has
no control over when professors
choose to teach their classes. How
does Rosen baum plan to get these
classes changed?
Examine their women's
building proposal also. We tried to
get space in the oid Law School for
a number of projects (ranging
from an expanded off-campus
student lounge to retention of a
lounge-snack bar near History
Corner). The University turned us
down and would do the same for
the Women's Building.
There is no available Law School
space because academic
departments will be moving in
right away. We researched the
possibility of using law school
space and decided not to offer
empty promises.
The runoff election is today
and Thursday. You have a chance
to decide what type of ASSU you
want. We offer realistic proposals
to begin with, and a chance to do
a lot more. But we need your
help, your ideas, and your vote.
We're the underdogs, but we're
willing to work not just for you,
but with you. Please vote.
(Kevin McDermott, Andy
lj>uchter, Bonny Rodden and
Mark Simonian are candidates for
the ASSU Council of Presidents.)
