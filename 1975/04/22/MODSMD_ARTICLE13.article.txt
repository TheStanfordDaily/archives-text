# Support Judicial Revision Plan
## 
### 
The Committee of 15 (C-15) has
constructed a proposal for change in the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP). Students will
vote on that proposal tomorrow and
Thursday.
As a student member of the C-15,1 called
for a student majority on the CJP in a Daily
column last fall. I have much to say in regard
to that column and the proposal currently
before the Stanford community.
A question to the faculty: Is it really true
that you would not tolerate a student
majority in a campus judicial system which
tries only students, even if students were
selected primarily by random process while
faculty members would continue to be
chosen by the Committee an Committees
(CoC)?
ASSU Can't Obstruct
The student selection process was
modified in our proposal "to ymake it
impossible for the ASSU to obstruct the
CJP's functioning — by refusing to make
student appointments (as it did in 1971,
causing the old SJC to collapse), or by
making "political" appointments.
Nevertheless, faculty C-15 members informed
us that you would not consider a 4-3 student
majority on the CJP.
Why do you demand faculty majority if
the CoC has considerable trouble rccruiting

just four people from your ranks to serve on
the CJP? Do you realize that three students
this year were found to serve on the CJP by
randomly calling less than one percent of the
student body? Are you afraid that a one
student majority would somehow make the
CJP irresponsible?
Your faculty reps indicated that these
were your sentiments.
Students 'Responsible'
Please reconsider your attitudes on the
campus judicial system. Stanford students are
not known for their irresponsibility, and
almost all are legal adults. Is a student
majority on a student court really so
unacceptable?
The student members of the C-15
wondered how well your views were being
represented on the committee when, during
the final meeting, one of the faculty
members asserted that the University would
be better off if there were no students.
Questions for President Lyman: The only
students presently involved in the campus
judicial system are the three on the panel
itself. The CJP's decisions are nothing more
than recommendations to you.
With the selection system in our proposal,
the SJC would have survived the '71 ASSU
Senate challenge. Why was the CJP which
replaced it such a radical change? Why does

M. Scott Smith

the CJP stand like a fortress ready for
revolutionary attack when our campus is
(and will probably remain) so quiet? You
have many options if serious trouble arises —
why are you steeled for problems which are
not even on the horizon?
'Incremental' Change
Questions for the Stanford Daily: Why
don't you support a proposal which brings us
closer to what students so obviously want?
Why did you support an ASSU slate whose
theme is "incremental change," only to blast
the C-15 proposal for not moving far
enough? Are you waiting for a proposal to
appear which attains all of the students' goals
in one grand sweep? It isn't going to happen
that way, I'll swear by it.
And to the students: Do you care enough
about your judicial system to vote? And will
you recognize that we are getting somewhere
by voting yes? C-15 student members have in
the past asked students to vote against their
proposal.
This year's student representatives want
you to endorse this proposal, but we know
we're not through. We ask for continued
student support next year toward further
increasing student input into their own
judicial system.
