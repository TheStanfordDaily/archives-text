'No' On Politics
Editor:
It might or might not be the
case that many people (and in our
little community, that usually
means students) are by now
disappointed by (if not outright
opposed to) the political process,
including, in our case, the election
of ASSU presidents. Perhaps those
people should be given a right to
express their feelings in a
significant manner.
What I propose is: let there
always be a space on the ballot
saying "if you'd rather not have a
president, check here." And then,
when counting the votes, each
none of these in effect subtracts a
vote from each of the other
candidates.
If at the end of the count no
candidate has a positive score,
then we don't have a president, or
we vote again with other
candidates, or we delegate the
power to the senators, or we get
our refundable fee assessments
back or something (instead of
what some people might consider
to be an alternative nothing).
Or perhaps more acceptable,
let every registered voter that
doesn't vote count as a vote
against having the position filled
up — and you are sure to get a
controversial debate going on.

We want to point out a
discrepancy in Daily policy
between your endorsement of the
amendment to eliminate sexist
wording in the Constitution and
your practice, as exemplified in
Friday's (April 18) Daily.
The woman in the photograph
on the front page was mistakenly
identified in the caption as a
"coed." The term "coed"
originally came into use to
describe those women students
attending a previously all-male
school.
They were labeled "coed" only
in regards to the fact that they
were different, an addition. The
women's status was determined
solely by its relationship to the
male students.
A coeducational school is one
which educates both men and
women. Neither sex by itself can
justify the use of the term
"coed." Therefore, "coed," when
used to identify women students,
is meaningless. In addition, it
advocates sexism by referring to
women students only in terms of
their male counterparts.
We recognize that no malice
was intended in the use of the
word "coed" in this instance and
we write this letter in hopes of
creating a deeper awareness in
both women and men students
that careless use of our language
often perpetuates ideas which we
are working to chango

power to the senators, or we get
our refundable fee assessments
back or something (instead of
what some people might consider
to be an alternative nothing).
Or perhaps more acceptable,
let every registered voter that
doesn't vote count as a vote
against having the position filled
up — and you are sure to get a
controversial debate going on.

Aware Of Sexism?
Editor:
We want to point out a
discrepancy in Daily policy
between your endorsement of the
amendment to eliminate sexist
wording in the Constitution and
your practice, as exemplified in
Friday's (April 18) Daily.
The woman in the photograph
on the front page was mistakenly
identified in the caption as a
"coed." The term "coed"
originally came into use to
describe those women students
attending a previously all-male
school.
They were labeled "coed" only
in regards to the fact that they
were different, an addition. The
women's status was determined
solely by its relationship to the
male students.
A coeducational school is one
which educates both men and
women. Neither sex by itself can
justify the use of the term
"coed." Therefore, "coed," when
used to identify women students,
is meaningless. In addition, it
advocates sexism by referring to
women students only in terms of
their male counterparts.
We recognize that no malice
was intended in the use of the
word "coed" in this instance and
we write this letter in hopes of
creating a deeper awareness in
both women and men students
that careless use of our language
often perpetuates ideas which we
are working to chango

'No' On Politics
Editor:
It might or might not be the
case that many people (and in our
little community, that usually
means students) are by now
disappointed by (if not outright
opposed to) the political process,
including, in our case, the election
of ASSU presidents. Perhaps those
people should be given a right to
express their feelings in a
significant manner.
What I propose is: let there
always be a space on the ballot
saying "if you'd rather not have a
president, check here." And then,
when counting the votes, each
none of these in effect subtracts a
vote from each of the other
candidates.
If at the end of the count no
candidate has a positive score,
then we don't have a president, or
we vote again with other
candidates, or we delegate the
power to the senators, or we get
our refundable fee assessments
back or something (instead of
what some people might consider
to be an alternative nothing).
Or perhaps more acceptable,
let every registered voter that
doesn't vote count as a vote
against having the position filled
up — and you are sure to get a
controversial debate going on.
