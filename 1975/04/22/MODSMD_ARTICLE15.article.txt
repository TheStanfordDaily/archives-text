# At The I-Center
## Tasting The World Here On The Farm 
### CECILE HEROLD 
As a sophomore transfer student from the
University of Illinois, Wayne Sachs arrived at
Stanford University "looking for everything
and anything."
He recalls the day he stumbled upon
Bechtel International Center and learned
about the I-Center's weekly lunchtime
discussions. "I wanted to meet a few people
who weren't undergrads," Sachs explains.
For Sachs, the lunchtime discussions
really fit the bill. At the first meeting of his
discussion group, he was introduced to
graduate students from Africa, Japan and
Canada, plus a Stanford visitor who had
taught at two universities in Poland.
This diversified group, along with seven
others, met eight times weekly last quarter to
discuss the topic, "The Foreign Experience."
Informal Approach
Lee Ziegfield, director of the I-Center,
says the Center has sponsored the luncheon
discussions for over 15 years, even since the
days when the Center was located between
Lathrop House and the post office.
"Our whole approach is very informal,"
Ziegfield says. "Topics are often elicited
from the students, attempting to settle upon
subjects of interest to both foreigners and
Americans."
Starting this week, each I-Center group
will begin its discussion series on a
regularly-chosen day. On Mondays, two
separate groups will discuss "Indonesia
Today" and "Living in France." On
Wednesdays, one group will discuss the "U.S.
Political Scene" while another will cover

varied themes with its "Topic du Jour." On
Thursdays, a continuing group examining
women's concerns will discuss their subject
with a focus on Latin America.
Some Get Heavy
Discussions begin at noon and last
formally for one hour. Ziegfield notes,
however, that many discussion groups will
stay longer.
"During the Turkish-Cypriot conflict,"
Ziegfield recalls, "we had a Turk and a Greek
co-leading and the discussions would
sometimes get very heated. Of course, all
discussion groups have their choice of
carrying on heavy or less-heavy conversations
from week to week."
Beatrice Prentice, leader of this quarter's
"Topic du Jour" takes a thoughtful approach
to her involvement. "I first participated in
the discussions five years ago when my
husband and I arrived from Canada," she
explains.
"In the beginning, when I became a
leader, I brought in outside speakers —
counselors, travelers, or professors. But, in
the last year or so, my emphasis has been
simply on getting people to know one
another.
"I want to establish continuing groups
who look forward to coming and talking
about anything."
Informational
Prentice feels that by bringing in outside
speakers the discussion turns into an
informational meeting. "The life of a student
is already one of finding facts," Prentice says.
"If a student wants facts, he'll find them.

At these luncheon discussions, I hope for
some real human interaction to take place."
Stanford Mothers organizer Shari Selover,
whose son graduated from Stanford, says the
lunchtime discussions have provided her with
an opportunity to keep in touch with the
University and the students.
"Sometimes discussion participants will
arrive early to share recipes and help out with
the preparations," she notes. "Also, a
Japanese student will practice her English
with me while we're working in the kitchen.
"This is a part of the I-Center's
'English-in-Action' program where Americans
help foreigners practice the new language
through informal conversation."
New Ideas
Mid Schubert, another member of the
Stanford Mothers Club, recalls one earlier
quarter's lunch topic, "Small is Beautiful."
"There were participants from a number
of small countries such as Lebanon,
Switzerland and England, each discussing
how their country, though small, could
operate on an efficient scale in agriculture
and industry.
"What's great about the discussions,"
Schubert concludes, "is that students,
without spending any more time than they
generally do at lunch, can really explore new
ideas with new people."
Perhaps one of the most significant results
of the discussions is the effect they can make
on foreign visitors. "Foreign students have
complained that American students are
superficial and difficult to get to know,"
Ziegfield says. "Here's a way to overcome
that."
