### Patty Fels 
/Is a student living off campus
who commutes up almost the full
length of Serra Memorial Rut
(637 times last year) by bike, I am
fully aware that any
administration official who claims
that Serra Street is not in need of
immediate resurfacing is either a
cloistered imbecile or a corrupt
sonofabitch. I am not bothered by
the bike lanes on lower Serra
which are crumbling into the
muddy trenches on either side of
the road. And my blood pressure
barely rises when the steel posts
that are supposed to exclude cars
are missing. But I get bloody well
incensed when I go past Galvez
Street and there isn 7 one
goddamned six-inch wide stretch
of asphalt that isn't completely

disrupted. Totalled. Wrecked.
Destroyed. Wiped out. I protest
my treatment as a second cbss
citizen. Money is rampantly
disgorged by a wastrel University
for such meaningless tasks as the
hand-chipping of the corrugated
walls of the new law school and
the solid marble foyer of the
proposed Seeley J. Mudd
Chemistry building, while my
welfare, safety and very life is
threatened by that same
University's crass and purposeful
imlicious negligence, perpetrated
undenounced because a broken
bicycle or injured student can be
swept under the rug. When was
the last time monied alumni were
given a ride on Serra Memorial
Rut? Doesn't Lyman take any

pride in the physical condition of
the University or are we students
the only ones foolish enough to
care? —A.S.
"It's a project that we know
needs doing," said Jason Mavis
with a sigh, when asked about the
poor condition of Serra.
Unfortunately, it's not one that's
going to get done, at least not this year.
There are still no funds
allocated to reconstructing Serra
Street, a project that will cost
about $60,000, according to
Mavis, the director of sponsored
projects. Part of Serra — from
Galvez Street to Encina Hall —
will be redone before the
construction of the new library
and the University is waiting until
this is completed (hopefully
sometime next year) before
redoing the rest of Serra.
Mavis pointed out that there is
only $38,000 remaining in the
budget for road services this year.
"I hope that we will be able to do
something about Serra next year,"
he said. But he didn't sound very
confident.

Where can I find or rent super-8
movie projectors for showing my
own home movies (non-porno)?
—C.B.D.
Bill Cleveland in University
public services has a super-8
projector, which he rents out to
groups. He also has a standard
eight millimeter projector. While
he isn't tremendously enthusiastic
about renting them out to a lone
student, he suggested that you call
him at 497-2285.
* * *
Why don't they open up the new
road between Santa Teresa and
Campus Drive? It looks finished
to me. —S.K.
It is finished. Manager of
Sponsored Projects Mavis said that
he had been talking to the
planning office about putting in
parking signs and opening up the
road. There is still some
underground utility work to be
done, so the street will probably
be closed periodically.

imlicious negligence, perpetrated
undenounced because a broken
bicycle or injured student can be
swept under the rug. When was
the last time monied alumni were
given a ride on Serra Memorial
Rut? Doesn't Lyman take any

pride in the physical condition of
the University or are we students
the only ones foolish enough to
care? —A.S.
"It's a project that we know
needs doing," said Jason Mavis
with a sigh, when asked about the
poor condition of Serra.
Unfortunately, it's not one that's
going to get done, at least not this year.
There are still no funds
allocated to reconstructing Serra
Street, a project that will cost
about $60,000, according to
Mavis, the director of sponsored
projects. Part of Serra — from
Galvez Street to Encina Hall —
will be redone before the
construction of the new library
and the University is waiting until
this is completed (hopefully
sometime next year) before
redoing the rest of Serra.
Mavis pointed out that there is
only $38,000 remaining in the
budget for road services this year.
"I hope that we will be able to do
something about Serra next year,"
he said. But he didn't sound very
confident.

Where can I find or rent super-8
movie projectors for showing my
own home movies (non-porno)?
—C.B.D.
Bill Cleveland in University
public services has a super-8
projector, which he rents out to
groups. He also has a standard
eight millimeter projector. While
he isn't tremendously enthusiastic
about renting them out to a lone
student, he suggested that you call
him at 497-2285.

Why don't they open up the new
road between Santa Teresa and
Campus Drive? It looks finished
to me. —S.K.
It is finished. Manager of
Sponsored Projects Mavis said that
he had been talking to the
planning office about putting in
parking signs and opening up the
road. There is still some
underground utility work to be
done, so the street will probably
be closed periodically.


/Is a student living off campus
who commutes up almost the full
length of Serra Memorial Rut
(637 times last year) by bike, I am
fully aware that any
administration official who claims
that Serra Street is not in need of
immediate resurfacing is either a
cloistered imbecile or a corrupt
sonofabitch. I am not bothered by
the bike lanes on lower Serra
which are crumbling into the
muddy trenches on either side of
the road. And my blood pressure
barely rises when the steel posts
that are supposed to exclude cars
are missing. But I get bloody well
incensed when I go past Galvez
Street and there isn 7 one
goddamned six-inch wide stretch
of asphalt that isn't completely

disrupted. Totalled. Wrecked.
Destroyed. Wiped out. I protest
my treatment as a second cbss
citizen. Money is rampantly
disgorged by a wastrel University
for such meaningless tasks as the
hand-chipping of the corrugated
walls of the new law school and
the solid marble foyer of the
proposed Seeley J. Mudd
Chemistry building, while my
welfare, safety and very life is
threatened by that same
University's crass and purposeful
imlicious negligence, perpetrated

bicycle or injured student can be
swept under the rug. When was
