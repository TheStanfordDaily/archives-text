Seven years ago today the Stanford Daily headlined stories \
concerning the admission of women toLambdaNu fraternity s
and the San Francisco speech of then Sen. Robert Kennedy.
The Lambda Nu story focused on the entrance of 20 s
upperclasswomen to the fraternity as part of the campus-wide *
draw system. i
"Clad in red polka dotted boxer shorts, combat boots, a gas j
mask, and a World War II German helmet, a Lambda Nu \
fraternity member attempted to dissuade the entrance of j
prospective female residents as his house held the first of two j
open houses for women last night," the story began.
It went on to note that "A brother explained the process to \
one girl as a matter of 'leaving it up to the computer.'
"Most of the girls laughed off the encounter with the <
machine-gun-toting 'member of the old guard' and announced \
that they were 'waiting to be rushed.' " !
After the fraternity members showed the girls around one I
girl commented, "Wow, are we impressed."
The story was written by Michael Kuhl, who is now the
business manager of the Daily. 1;
In San Francisco, Sen. Robert Kennedy defended President s
Johnson's refusal to negotiate with the North Vietnamese in
PhnomPenh. Kennedy was speaking at the University of San

the administration has had to raise conditions after the z
statement was made that we would negotiate anywhere, but j
that the conditions were necessary. z

Kennedy replied, referring to his young family, 'Personally I'd >
like to lower it to about six.' " J
