# Prof Attacks Death Penalty

### LONNIE ROSENWALD 
Claiming that capital punishment is
unconstitutional, Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam argued before the U.S.
Supreme Court yesterday that existing
death penalty statutes give too much
power to juries, prosecutors and others
in determining who shall die.
"Legislators are not fools,"
Amsterdam contended. "They know
what they're doing. They know that
the death penalty will be averted from
all but a disfavored few."
Amsterdam is asserting that the
death penalty constitutes cruel and
unusual punishment and is in violation
of the Eighth Amendment.
Arguing that capital punishment
deters crime and should be upheld
were North Carolina Deputy Atty.
Gen. Jean Benoy and U.S. Solicitor
General Robert Bork. Bork told the
court that the discretion which the
present law provides is not a "defect,
but is "the genius of the system."
Amsterdam is representing
condemned murderer Jesse Thurman

Fowler, a 26-year-old truck driver from
North Carolina. Fowler's is the first
capital punishment case to come
before the Supreme Court since it
ruled the death penalty
unconstitutional in 1972.
Amsterdam saved a client in that
case when the court ruled 5-4 that the
death penalty laws then on the books
were unconstitutional because they
gave judges and juries excessive
discretion in determining the sentence
for capital crimes.
Since the 1972 ruling avoided the
underlying issue of the
constitutionality of the death penalty
itself, this time Amsterdam is asking
the court to look beyond the
individual case and rule the death
penalty unconstitutional in all its
present forms.
The Court's action in the Fowler
case could determine the future of
capital punishment in the U.S.
Although no one has been executed in
this country since 1967, there are
currently 261 persons on death row in
22 states, according to the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund, which is

coordinating Fowler's defense.
North Carolina was one of the first
states to act on the issue, making the
death penalty mandatory for all
capital crimes. So far, 31 states have
interpreted the decision as meaning
that if the death penalty is mandatory
for particular offenses, it will be
constitutional.
However, the decision in the
current case, which is expected some
time in June, could again avoid judging
the constitutionality of the death
penalty by focusing on a narrower
issue. The Court might rule that the
Fowler sentence is invalid because it
was imposed under a North Carolina
state Supreme Court ruling rather than
under the state's new death penalty
statute.
