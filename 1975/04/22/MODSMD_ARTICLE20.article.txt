# Manzanita Park Permanent... For Now

### KAREN CAESAR 
Many trailers in Manzanita
Park will undergo a "major
revamping" to allow the
undergraduate housing project "to
remain a viable residence for
students," its director says, but
the "temporary" units will be
around for some time to come.
When Manzanita opened in
1969 as "emergency housing" for
460 students suffering in a
"housing crisis," its lifespan was
set at three to five years by the
Board of Trustees.
Park Director Wendy Hawkins
said trailers were inspected over
spring break to determine needed
improvements. "In one-third to
one-half of them the carpets and
drapes will be changed" this
summer, she added.
Rich Richardson, maintenance
supervisor of University housing,
Ceil led the amount of money spent
annually on repairs in the 130
trailers that comprise Manzanita
"fairly substantial." There is not
enough money to replace all the
carpeting in every trailer this
summer, "but they will all be
done in three years."
Officials admit there were once
plans to replace Manzanita with
more permanent housing.
Alan Cummings, manager of
student housing, said that "there
was a planning effort going on
during that five year period
|Manzanita's intended lifespan],

but with the Stanford campus in a
state of flux ... planning never
materialized into specific
drawings." Instead, "the
culmination was the Report on
Undergraduate Housing Needs,
1974-1984."
Dur>ng 1965-1966, however,
there had been intentions to build
two new living complexes capable
of housing 250 students each.
These were the ill-fated Robert
Moore Houses (which would have

been built between Clusters I and
II) and the Margaret Jacks Houses
(which would have been located
where the three new Row Houses
are currently being built).
But Cummings went on to say
that "because of changes in
program and freezing up of
federal projects, those two
projects in various stages of
development were shelved."
Then money, or lack of it,
seems to have been the main

obstacle in the way of new
housing. Said Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton, "I
personally do not think Manzanita
is the most desirable housing, but
as of now, there is no gain in
getting rid of it. If there were no
debt on Manzanita and we could
close the park tomorrow, the
immediate impact would be
throwing 450 students out of
their housing, something 1 would
be very reluctant to do."
