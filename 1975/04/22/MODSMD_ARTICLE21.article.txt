# Effects Debated
## Marijuana: Good Or Bad? 
### KATHY JACKSON 
As marijuana reform bills came
up for debate in the U.S. Senate
and California State Assembly last
week, so Stanford had its own
"Great Marijuana Debate" of last
Tuesday night in the Donner
lounge.
Sponsored by the Stanford
California Republican League and
California College Republicans,
the debate pitted physiologist Dr.
Hardin Jones of UC Berkeley
against Gordon Brownell,
representative of the National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws (NORML).
Terming marijuana a "very
dangerous substance," Jones

warned of "lingering effects" of
the drug, noting that 30 percent
of the marijuana taken into the
body will still be present largely in
active form one week later.
Some of the negative effects of
accumulated marijuana, according
to Jones, include paralyzation of
pleasure centers in the brain,
suppression of male hormone
production, and chromosome and
cell damage. "Thinking processes
are greatly altered in the normal
marijuana user," he says,
"although the user doesn't realize
he's been affected."
Research
Challenging much of Jones'
research, however, Brownell

maintained that the balance of
studies presents no evidence lor
brain damage caused by marijuana
use.
Asserting that such use is more
a legal than medical question,
Brownell maintained that "while
the use of marijuana should not
be encouraged, neither should it
be prohibited by criminal law.
"Criminal penalties have just
plain been ineffective in halting
marijuana use," he told the
audience of 30. "Marijuana
skyrocketed from virtually
nothing in the early '60s to one of
the most popular,
recreationally-used drugs in the
U.S. despite felony penalties in
almost all states during that
time."
Blaming the law for the
"tremendous fiscal, social and
human costs" involved in
marijuana prohibition, the
NOItML representative asserted
that those costs are too much to
pay. California, he noted, spends
nearly $100 million annually
enforcing marijuana laws.
Peer Pressure
While both men agreed that
peer pressure is a major cause of
drug use, the two also clashed on
patterns of use.
Jones, who has interviewed
nearly 2000 marijuana users,
maintained that the drug is a
"preconditioning influence" in
the decision to use heroin. "There
is a clear-cut linkage," he said,
"between marijuana and all other
psychoactive drugs which can be
used, including alcohol and
nicotine."
Brownell, on the other hand,
asserted that the marijuana-heroin
link is not a causal one and noted
that "there is a greater statistical
link between alcohol and heroin,
or tobacco and heroin, than
between marijuana and heroin."
