## Symphony Success Trumpeter Stars 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
SAN FRANCISCO - Maurice
Andre, considered by many to be
the greatest trumpeter in the
world, stole the show at the San
Francisco Symphony Wednesday
night.
He performed Haydn's
Concerto in E Flat Major for
Trumpet and Orchestra, which is
perhaps the most familiar piece
ever written for trumpet, and
Tele man n's Concerto in D Major
for Trumpet and Strings.
Andre's performance displayed
a remarkable versatility and
sensitivity to the subtle nuances
of each piece. His trumpet sang
with expressive emotion in the
Haydn, and was equally at home
with the more lighthearted
Telemann.
His trills were clear and
vibrant, the triple-tonguing
flawless, and his tone quality was
so ringing and magnificent that
the audience didn't want to let
him go. Rarely has a trumpet
sounded so good.
The orchestra's
accompaniment to Andre had a
few minor problems. The
accompanists were sometimes out
of tune or behind the soloist,
possibly because of a lack of
rehearsal with him. But it really
didn't matter; Andre was so good
that orchestral mistakes were
easily forgotten.
The San Francisco Symphony
Chorus performed with the
Orchestra in Prokofieffs
Alexander Nevsky, Opus 78, with
mezzo-soprano Edna Garabedian
as soloist.
In 1938, Prokofieff
collaborated with Sergei
Eisenstein, the great Russian
cinematographer, to create the
film Alexander Nevsky. Prokofieff
composed the score for
Eisenstein's film about Russia's
invasion by Teutonic knights in
the 18th century. A year later,
Prokofieff arranged the score for
orchestra, chorus and soloist.
The chorus, under the
direction of Louis R. Magor, was
excellent. The voices blended
perfectly together to produce a
clear precision of tone and to

bring out the full excitement of
the music. The story of Russia
came alive through their voices; j
the invasion, the brave battles, the :
victory.
Garabedian, however, as
the young girl crossing the field of
dead soldiers, was a
disappointment. Her voice is
lovely enough but her tone was
wobbly and weak, hardly j
appropriate for the role.
The Orchestra opened with
Roger Sessions' Suite from the
opera Montezuma, which
dramatically depicts Cortez'
invasion of Mexico.
It's a contemporary work to
which the audience applauded
politely, but the Orchestra played :
it very well.

FROM 'DARLING' TO 'LOCUST' — Film director John Schlesinger has made some fine movies in the last
few years, including Midnight Cowboy and Sunday Bloody Sunday. His newest, Day of the
Locust, will be released soon, and Schlesinger stopped by the City to talk about it recently.

mezzo-soprano Edna Garabedian
as soloist.
In 1938, Prokofieff
collaborated with Sergei
Eisenstein, the great Russian
cinematographer, to create the
film Alexander Nevsky. Prokofieff
composed the score for
Eisenstein's film about Russia's
invasion by Teutonic knights in
the 18th century. A year later,
Prokofieff arranged the score for
orchestra, chorus and soloist.
The chorus, under the
direction of Louis R. Magor, was
excellent. The voices blended
perfectly together to produce a
clear precision of tone and to

bring out the full excitement of
the music. The story of Russia
came alive through their voices; j
the invasion, the brave battles, the :
victory.
Garabedian, however, as
the young girl crossing the field of
dead soldiers, was a
disappointment. Her voice is
lovely enough but her tone was
wobbly and weak, hardly j
appropriate for the role.
The Orchestra opened with
Roger Sessions' Suite from the
opera Montezuma, which
dramatically depicts Cortez'
invasion of Mexico.
It's a contemporary work to
which the audience applauded
politely, but the Orchestra played :
it very well.

FROM 'DARLING' TO 'LOCUST' — Film director John Schlesinger has made some fine movies in the last
few years, including Midnight Cowboy and Sunday Bloody Sunday. His newest, Day of the
Locust, will be released soon, and Schlesinger stopped by the City to talk about it recently.
SAN FRANCISCO - Maurice
Andre, considered by many to be
the greatest trumpeter in the
world, stole the show at the San
Francisco Symphony Wednesday
night.
He performed Haydn's
Concerto in E Flat Major for
Trumpet and Orchestra, which is
perhaps the most familiar piece
ever written for trumpet, and
Tele man n's Concerto in D Major
for Trumpet and Strings.
Andre's performance displayed
a remarkable versatility and
sensitivity to the subtle nuances
of each piece. His trumpet sang
with expressive emotion in the
Haydn, and was equally at home
with the more lighthearted
Telemann.
His trills were clear and
vibrant, the triple-tonguing
flawless, and his tone quality was
so ringing and magnificent that
the audience didn't want to let
him go. Rarely has a trumpet
sounded so good.
The orchestra's
accompaniment to Andre had a
few minor problems. The
accompanists were sometimes out
of tune or behind the soloist,
possibly because of a lack of
rehearsal with him. But it really
didn't matter; Andre was so good
that orchestral mistakes were
easily forgotten.
The San Francisco Symphony
Chorus performed with the
Orchestra in Prokofieffs
Alexander Nevsky, Opus 78, with
mezzo-soprano Edna Garabedian
as soloist.
