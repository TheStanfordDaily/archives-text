# Frost To Go Latin
## 
### 
In an attempt to introduce
students to the increasingly
popular Latin and Latin-jazz
music, the Stanford Chevere
Committee will present a
seven-hour concert, called "La
Gran Regeneracion," next Sunday
in Frost Amphitheatre.
Star of the concert will be Ray
Barretto, one of New York's most
popular Latin performers, and his
12-piece orchestra. Conga player
Barretto has made many
recordings with his own group,
with jazz musicians like Billy
Cobham and Freddie Hubbard
and with New York's Fania
All-Star band.
Cal Tjader, whose mixture of
Latin and jazz music has made
him one of the most popular vibes
players in the country, will appear
with his band.
Also on the bill will be Sapo, a
local Latin-rock band featuring
guitarist Richard Bean.
Half the proceeds from the
concert will go to the Music
Department to fund the Stanford
Studio Band, which would not be
able to stay together under the
projected department budget for
next year.
The Studio Band, who will
perform at the Sunday concert.

will give a "sneak preview" of
their show tomorrow noon in
White Plaza.
The band, which features 17
horns, will perform "funk, jazz
and Latin," according to director
George Nixon.
The remaining funds from the
concert will go to various
community organizations,
including several local Chicano
organizations. Other funds will go
to a drug-rehabilitation center.
