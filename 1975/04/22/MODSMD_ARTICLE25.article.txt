# McLean's Familiar Hits Work Again
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
BERKELEY - "Well, you might not
recognize my face, I used to be a star," sang
Don McLean to a sparse audience in the
Community Theater last week.
Although it has been a long time since
"Vincent" and the AM-radio version of
"American Pie" hit the top of the pop charts,
McLean's fans have not forgotten his face or
his talent.
His music is strong enough to stand by
itself. He sang and accompanied himself on
banjo or guitar, without additional
instrumental backup. And he got occasional
help from a friend, black folksinger Jimmy
Collier.
Collier attempted to provide a break in
McLean's incredibly long set with a
story-song about a "signifyin' monkey."
However, the virtually all-white crowd
needed some instruction: Collier had to
explain that signifyin' is another word for
Don Rickles-type jive. Although Collier's
singing was rich and pleasant, it was apparent
that the crowd was waiting him out. He
asked for audience participation, and got
silence.
All The Hits
McLean knew what the crowd wanted —
all his hits. He sang "American Pie" almost
grudgingly, slowing the pace so that the
audience could sing along. As the crowd
trudged through each verse and chorus,
McLean dabbled with the melody line, like a
well-trained runner jogging circles around a
turtle.
Most of his other material was infinitely
more interesting. People familiar only with
McLean's tender tribute to Van Gogh in
"Vincent" might have been shocked by his
ribald delivery of "Where Were You When
My Heart Went Out?."
The song concerns a bitter fellow who's
trying to replace the woman who walked out
on him: he looks in fancy boudoirs and finds
nothing but "Republicans romancing

Southern states;" then he takes up with a
banker's daughter, hoping to do to her "what
her father does to all of us."
One McLean composition is built on the
inevitable train metaphor and includes lines
like, "I just want to ride in your boxcar."
The analogy is carried to its logical
conclusion at the end of the track. The tune,
by the way, was banned on commercial radio
in Australia.
The rowdy numbers early in the concert
gave McLean a chance to do calisthenics with
his voice and smooth out a few technical
bugs. It wasn't long before both McLean and
the audience were warmed up enough for
more serious music.
Death Wishes
His protest songs tilted at the windmills of
the justice system and the military-industrial
complex. "I hope that you die," McLean spat
at the warmongers who create "the fear of
bringing children into the world."
McLean's lyrics escape triteness because
he finds new twists for traditional folk
themes. One song tells of his free-living
friends — the hoboes who smash their
wine bottles on gravestones and enjoy life to
the fullest.
His smooth, sometimes-flat voice is
perhaps best suited to plaintive love ballads.
While tuning his guitar, McLean explained
that he wrote "And I Love You So" for the
woman he later married. Although the tune
was made famous by Perry Como, McLean's
version is excellent in its own way.
Clean banjo-picking provided the
backbone for "Babylon," sung as a three-part
round with audience participation. As the
voices swelled in harmony, one could only
imagine the effect a full house of voices
would create. Given the calibre of an
entertainer like McLean, it is amazing that
not more than a handful of "American Pie"
fans attended the concert.
By the time he ended his set with
"Vincent," McLean had begun to look tired.

But his voice endured three encores. His final
song, an a capella lullaby, earned him his
fourth standing ovation of the evening.
Lovely Lori
Appearing with McLean was Lori
Lieberman, a singer who has a lot going for
her.
Her stage presence is striking, largely due
to her thick, radiant blond hair. Her posture
is almost regal.
This delicate exterior belies Lieberman's
powerful, but sweet, voice. Perhaps her
biggest assets are her producers — Norman
Gimbel and Charles Fox — who come up
with material that showcases her talent.
Lieberman is at her best in slow, mournful
songs like "I'll Be Home." Those who have
thrilled to Roberta Flack's version of "Killing
Me Softly" would be astounded at
Lieberman's exquisite delivery of the song —
after all, Fox and Gimbel originally wrote it
for her.
Some of her material is laced with
convincing cynicism. When Lieberman sings
of drinking down her coffee, popping up her
toast, and trying to shake a fickle lover's
ghost, she conveys the pain of one who has
been deeply hurt.
Where she fails is in songs like "No Rights
on Saturday Nights," which are apparently
aimed at proving that she is a wayward
woman. Unfortunately, her
Alice-in-Wonderland looks and well-tempered
body movements make it hard to believe that
Lori has gone astray.
On the whole, Lieberman was more at
ease than she was at her recent appearances
at The Boarding House in San Francisco. Her
introductions to the songs flowed more
naturally. In addition, she was backed by a
tight five-man combo; only three musicians
backed her at The Boarding House.
However, when she sang "I've Got A
Name" in tribute to the late Jim Croce,
Lieberman demonstrated an unquestionable
talent that is still developing.
