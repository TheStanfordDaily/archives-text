# Director Schlesinger Readies 'Locust' Film
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
Director John Schlesinger
made four movies between 1965
and 1971. One of them ( Midnight
Cowboy, 1969) won him the
Oscar; two of them brought him
nominations (Darling, 1965;
Sunday Bloody Sunday, 1971),
and after the third (Far From the
Madding Crowd, 1967), Ruth
Gordon informed him, "That'll
teach you to fool around with the
fucking classics."
Wisely not taking Gordon's
advice, Schlesinger has spent the
last four years constructing a film
from Nathanael West's novel, The
Day of the Locust, which came to
be considered a classic after West's
death in 1940.
The book is a timeless picture
of Hollywood — the people inside
of it, outside of it — the Locusts
— and those caught somewhere in
between, trying to be part of the
celebrated never-never-land and
never quite reaching solid ground.
Hollywood has never taken
kindly to movies that show it up
as exactly what it is — heartless,
corrupt, and decadent — so
financing was difficult. Similarly,
West's novel could not be easily
translated into film, although
many have tried over the years.
However, Schlesinger has never
let such trivial things get in his
way. He reminds us that he was
also asked, "Who'd ever want to
see a film about two homosexuals
in New York?"
John Schlesinger was in San
Francisco recently to discuss his
career and the forthcoming Day
of the Locust. He confessed an
affinity for both West and Tod
Hackett the young set designer
from Yale who enters Hollywood
prejudiced by the same California
mystique that has attracted the
others to the oranges the color of
sunshine. $
Hollywood awed both of them
— and perhaps Schlesinger, too,
for a moment or two — and, in
spite of this affinity, Schlesinger is
the only one of the three that has
come out of Hollywood a success.
Hackett couldn't — pardon the
expression — hack it, and West
wrote screenplays for "B" films
before his death in 1940 in an
auto accident. The director did
confess his fascination for
Hollywood and Los Angeles and
"the theatricality of the place."
Everything in Los Angeles is
man-made — it sprouted out of
the desert. Because of that and
the facades called sets the

industry constructs, one never
knows what's real and what isn't.
The example Schlesinger used was
the flora of Southern California —
which is sometimes plastic,
painted, or rolled out of a factory.
At the end of Locust, there is a
crowd scene in front of
Grauman's Chinese theatre, which
is actually a set on three
Paramount sound stages but
absolutely authentic for the year
1938 (shooting on a stage in
complete control spoiled
Schlesinger so much that he may
never film on location again, ho
said).
Nathanael West was equally
fascinated by this uncertainty
about what is real and what isn't,
and the movie communicates
perfectly what West conveyed in
his novel about it.
Schlesinger also gave his
opinions on movies in general,
saying that "they're no longer
escapist" — they've come to have
more power than that. Disaster
movies, for instance, are enjoyable
to watch, but you don't have to
think, and he thinks we're moving
away from that trend.
If we are, Day of the Locust
will be at the vanguard, for it is
not a movie to be watched — it is
to be experienced. It is
soft-spoken on the surface like its
director, but it promises an
experience more fulfilling than 99
percent of today's movies.
