Saigon Airlift Continues
CLARK AIR BASE, The Philippines — About
1000 Americans and Vietnamese arrived yesterday
in the biggest day so far of the airlift from
endangered Saigon.
Twelve U.S. Air Force Cl4l jets carried
ammunition and other supplies to Saigon and
returned with passengers. At least 2700 persons
have arrived here from Saigon since April 5, about
1400 of them Americans. This does not include 891
Vietnamese children flown out on the babylift.
Another plane, belonging to World Airways,
arrived at Travis Air Force Base, Calif., with 209
Americans and some Vietnamese wives.
Many of the arrivals at Clark were American men
and their Vietnamese wives, children and
mothers-in-law.
K.S. Negley, 52, of Torrance, Calif., who arrived
with his Vietnamese wife and three children, said he
slept in a snack-bar one night and on a mattress and
paper sheet in an office block another night. He said
he and other evacuee families ate C-rations supplied
by U.S. Marines.
Waiting for the evacuees at Clark was a small city
of 36 tents, each large enough for about 20 persons.
Spokesmen said the base also had permanent
quarters for 5000 visitors and that the tent city
could be expanded to accommodate 5000.
U.S. officials in Saigon say between 2000 and
2500 Americans remain in the country. President
Ford issued orders on April 16 for all Americans to
leave the country.
Floods Bring Extensive Damage
LANSING, Mich. — The worst flooding in 28
years here kept hundreds of residents from their
homes yesterday and damages surpassed the
$50-million mark in Michigan's capital city.
Meanwhile, damage estimates in a seven-state
area rose over $100 million as a result of the
continuing annual spring overflow along the banks
of the Mississippi River and its tributaries.
Many of the 800 Lansing area residents forced to
evacuate their homes will not be able to return until
today when waters from the Grand and Red Cedar
rivers were expected to subside, authorities said.
The two rivers which meet at Lansing in central
Michigan overflowed their banks during the
weekend after rains of as much as five inches. Gov.
William Milliken asked that 13 counties be declared
federal disaster areas due to the flooding.
Authorities counted 700 homes and as many as
100 businesses damaged by the rampaging waters.
Nearly 500 National Guardsmen were summoned to
help in the evacuation.
Ford Urges End To Viet Debate
WASHINGTON — President Ford called fof an
end to the 15-year Vietnam debate yesterday."I
think we ought to ... look at the future," he said.
Speaking on a CBS news special, Ford promised
not to make congressional reluctance to meet his aid
requests a campaign issue in the 1976 presidential
race.
"I don't intend to go out and make a campaign
and point a finger," Ford said. Besides, he added,
"by 1976 I would hope we could look forward in
the field of foreign policy ... rather than to replay
the past with all the division and divisive feelings
among the good people of this country."

In a related vein, Ford said there was no point in
releasing correspondence of former President
Richard Nixon in order to put the rest allegations of
secret pledges of support to Thieu.
However, Ford said that Nixon had telephoned
the President with congratulations on Ford's April
10 State of the World message. Nixon assured him
in the brief conversation that the private
correspondence and the public record are in
agreement, Ford said.
Mideast Talks Renewed
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — King Khaled of Saudi
Arabia played host to an Arab summit yesterday to
set a new diplomatic course for Egypt and Syria
heading into renewed Geneva peace talks.
Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Anwar Sadat
of Egypt flew into the Saudi capital of Rigadh for
their first such public meeting since early last year.
Khaled greeted both with traditional embraces
following their separate arrivals, Riyadh radio
reported.
Official Palestinian sources said guerrilla chieftain
Yasir Arafat also will attend the coordination talks.
But as usual they cloaked his travel plans in secrecy
as a security measure.
The United Arab Emirates are to call for an
emergency meeting ot the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to discuss matters
related to money surplus arising from oil revenues,
Abu Dhubi's petroleum minister, Man al Otaiba,
announced.
Egypt and Syria, the two main combatants
against Israel, have had clouded relations since Sadat
went along with Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger's step-by-step peace mediation.
High Court Rejects Busing Case
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused to
become involved yesterday in Louisville and
Indianapolis desegregation cases that could lead to
busing of students between the cities and their
suburbs.
In routine orders, the court declined without
comment to review either case.
The action means that a federal court in
Louisville may reach across district lines if necessary
to desegregate Louisville and Jefferson County
schools. The trial court must proceed immediately
to develop a desegregation plan.
By rejecting the school case, the court turned
down the chance to expand upon its 1974 decision
allowing cross-district remedies in some
desegregation cases.
The court said then that desegregation methods,
including busing, may reach across district lines
when unconstitutional segregation in one district
has produced segregation in another district. That
decision came in a Detroit case.
Indiana state officials and the Indianapolis
suburban school districts had argued that the
Detroit decision meant that they should be exempt
from an Indianapolis school desegregation plan.
The U.S. circuit court in Chicago ruled against
the state and ordered further trial court proceeding
to determine whether the suburbs should be
included.
Retail Food Prices Drop Slightly
CHICAGO — The lower food prices that
consumers have been hearing about for months have

started to appear on supermarket shelves, with
decreases on products ranging from cookies to
canned goods.
A sampling yesterday showed that the savings are
spotty: They involve specific items at specific stores
in specific cities. But they do provide an indication
that the steady decline in prices at the farm and
wholesale levels may be reaching the consumer.
Several Chicago-area supermarkets cut prices last
week on up to 30 percent of the items on their
shelves. All denied they were engaging in a price
war, but industry analysts were skeptical of the
claim.
Whatever the reason, the action brought some
savings to consumers and the stores said business
was up. "My store has literally been stormed by
shoppers," said the manager of a Jewel outlet.
In New York City, sugar has come down and on
March 31, the Nabisco Company announced cuts in
the wholesale prices of 51 products, with decrease
ranging up to 10 cents an item.
Other recent decreases came in canned and
frozen foods. Campbell Soup Company announced
cuts of 3 to 13 cents on 20 canned products and
reduced prices of 13 Swanson frozen-food items by
5 to 14 percent.
Government spokesman have been predicting
lower supermarket prices for some time, noting
declines in the amount paid to farmers and the
amount charged by manufacturers.
The latest U.S. Department of Agriculture
marketbasket report showed prices at the retail level
went up four-tenths of a percent in February, the
smallest increase in four months.
Sentenced Newsmen Vow Silence
FRESNO — Three newspapermen sentenced to
jail until they tell how they acquired a sealed grand
jury transcript vow "they will never answer those
questions," their attorney says.
Fresno Bee Managing Editor George Gruner and
reporters Joe Rosato and William Patterson did not
go to jail yesterday as Superior Court Judge Denver
Peckinpah stayed imposition of sentence until May
23.
That will give the newspaper's attorneys time to
file an appeal on grounds that the citations violated
their constitutional rights and the California "shield
law" aimed at protecting reporters from having to
disclose confidential sources.
They were cited in "direct contempt" 62 times
at an earlier hearing for refusing to answer any
questions that might have led to the source of three
articles containing details of a transcript ordered
sealed until trials were completed.
A fourth staffer, City Editor James Bort, was
found in contempt 17 times yesterday, but his
sentencing was delayed until the hearing resumes on
Wednesday.
Today's Weather
Night and morning low cloudiness but mostly
fair with variable clouds afternoons through
tomorrow. Lows in the 40s to low 50s. Highs both
days in the 60s. Winds west to northwest 10 to 20
mph.
