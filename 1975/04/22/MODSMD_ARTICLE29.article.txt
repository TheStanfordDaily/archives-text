CORRECTIONS
In yesterday's paper, the Daily
incorrectly spelled the name of the
instructor in the belly dance club. Her
name is Zumara, not Umara.
Also in yesterday's paper, the Daily
incorrectly quoted a computer
technician as saying that only 75
current freshmen could be assured
housing on campus next year. It
should have read 75 percent of the
current freshman class.
