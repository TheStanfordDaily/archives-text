### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU earned approximately
$78,000 between Sept. 1, 1974 and
March 31, 1975, according to the
quarterly report on association
projects presented to the Senate last
night by ASSU Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri.
The sum includes $18,795 in
interest income from investments
(mainly bonds and bankers

ASSU Travel Service, and about
$40,000 from Special Events (this
includes summer quarter profits).

slates on the ballot this week and to
hold a special one-day run-off election
next week if none of the slates receives
a majority of the vote.
In a 9-2 vote, the Senate limited
campaign budget expenditures to $85
for this week's election and $15 for
the run-off.
The Senate also voted 8-1 to pass a
motion to disqualify all candidates for
election office who are not currently
registered students. If any such
students are running on a slate, the
rest of the slate may still run without
him.

they run for office. Even to allow
someone to run on the understanding
that he would be a student the
following quarter would be a violation
of the Constitution.
The question arose when Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald
reported that the status of senior class
candidate Dan Poston was in question.
According to the registrar's office,
Fitzgerald said. Poston is doing
independent study for credit with a
University department. It was not
clear if he is a registered student this
