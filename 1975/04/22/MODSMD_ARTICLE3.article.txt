# Olivieri Says ASSU Made $78,000
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU earned approximately
$78,000 between Sept. 1, 1974 and
March 31, 1975, according to the
quarterly report on association
projects presented to the Senate last
night by ASSU Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri.
The sum includes $18,795 in
interest income from investments
(mainly bonds and bankers
acceptances), about $31,000 from the
ASSU Travel Service, and about
$40,000 from Special Events (this
includes summer quarter profits).
The Senate also passed 7-3 a
motion to place all six senior class
slates on the ballot this week and to
hold a special one-day run-off election
next week if none of the slates receives
a majority of the vote.
In a 9-2 vote, the Senate limited
campaign budget expenditures to $85
for this week's election and $15 for
the run-off.
The Senate also voted 8-1 to pass a
motion to disqualify all candidates for
election office who are not currently
registered students. If any such
students are running on a slate, the
rest of the slate may still run without
him.
As the Senate interpreted it, the
Constitution specifies that candidates
must be registered students at the time
they run for office. Even to allow
someone to run on the understanding
that he would be a student the
following quarter would be a violation
of the Constitution.
The question arose when Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald
reported that the status of senior class
candidate Dan Poston was in question.
According to the registrar's office,
Fitzgerald said. Poston is doing
independent study for credit with a
University department. It was not
clear if he is a registered student this
quarter.
A motion to accept the slate in
question as it stands had passed 6-4 on
a hand count, but failed 4-5 (four
abstaining) on a roll call vote.
Sen. Lyse Strnad, who also heads
one of the senior class slates was one
of those abstaining. Strnad said that
she was "very disappointed" about the
disqualification of the non-registered
students and "astounded at what a
simple friendly election has turned
into."
According to Olivieri's report, the
Sunday Flicks broke even last quarter,
due to increased costs, fewer ticket
purchases and failure to get "desired"
pictures from distributors. Olivieri

predicted a deficit for spring quarter.
Olivieri also reported that there
may be a price increase next year in
order to match expenses and obtain
more recent and popular pictures. He
pointed out that other film series on
campus charge $1 to $2 admission.
Olivieri also told senators last night
that he is planning to make an
investment that will yield more
income in the long run with a "risk
factor of absolutely zero."
Olivieri will take $100,000 of the
$150,000 currently invested in
banker's acceptance notes at Wells
Fargo at &A percent interest and put it
into a small business administration
note.

the run-off.
The Senate also voted 8-1 to pass a
motion to disqualify all candidates for
election office who are not currently
registered students. If any such
students are running on a slate, the
rest of the slate may still run without
him.
As the Senate interpreted it, the
Constitution specifies that candidates
must be registered students at the time
they run for office. Even to allow
someone to run on the understanding
that he would be a student the
following quarter would be a violation
of the Constitution.
The question arose when Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald
reported that the status of senior class
candidate Dan Poston was in question.
According to the registrar's office,
Fitzgerald said. Poston is doing
independent study for credit with a
University department. It was not
clear if he is a registered student this
quarter.
A motion to accept the slate in
question as it stands had passed 6-4 on
a hand count, but failed 4-5 (four
abstaining) on a roll call vote.
Sen. Lyse Strnad, who also heads
one of the senior class slates was one
of those abstaining. Strnad said that
she was "very disappointed" about the
disqualification of the non-registered
students and "astounded at what a
simple friendly election has turned
into."
According to Olivieri's report, the
Sunday Flicks broke even last quarter,
due to increased costs, fewer ticket
purchases and failure to get "desired"
pictures from distributors. Olivieri

predicted a deficit for spring quarter.
Olivieri also reported that there
may be a price increase next year in
order to match expenses and obtain
more recent and popular pictures. He
pointed out that other film series on
campus charge $1 to $2 admission.
Olivieri also told senators last night
that he is planning to make an
investment that will yield more
income in the long run with a "risk
factor of absolutely zero."
Olivieri will take $100,000 of the
$150,000 currently invested in
banker's acceptance notes at Wells
Fargo at &A percent interest and put it
into a small business administration
note.
The ASSU earned approximately
$78,000 between Sept. 1, 1974 and
March 31, 1975, according to the
quarterly report on association
projects presented to the Senate last
night by ASSU Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri.
The sum includes $18,795 in
interest income from investments
(mainly bonds and bankers
acceptances), about $31,000 from the
ASSU Travel Service, and about
$40,000 from Special Events (this
includes summer quarter profits).
The Senate also passed 7-3 a
motion to place all six senior class
slates on the ballot this week and to
hold a special one-day run-off election
next week if none of the slates receives
a majority of the vote.
In a 9-2 vote, the Senate limited
campaign budget expenditures to $85
for this week's election and $15 for
the run-off.
