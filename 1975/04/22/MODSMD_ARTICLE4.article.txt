# Jersey Legislators Blast Franklin's Rutgers Offer
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Four New Jersey state senators last
week expressed strong opposition to
the appointment of fired Stanford
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin to a
post at Rutgers University's Newark
campus.
"11l be damned if I'm going to
allow this man [Franklin] to be
hired." Anthony Imperiale, a Newark
legislator, told the Senate, according
to the Newark Star-Ledger. "If we
allow this man to teach at one of our
universities, then we're all crazy and
we shouldn't be legislators."
Although the power to hire
professors rests with Rutgers' Board of
Governors, the legislators threatened
to cut funding to Rutgers, New
Jersey's state university, if Franklin
takes his chair in Rutgers' English
Department.

Franklin, fired from Stanford in
1972 for allegedly inciting students to
violence, told the Daily yesterday that
the legislators "are basically making
noises for their backers."
Although Franklin emphasized that
he had not polled the legislators, he
said he doubted if the majority of the
senators agreed with his detractors.
Beyers Assailed
Franklin accused Bob Beyers,
director of Stanford's news service, of
releasing smear propaganda to the
Star-Ledger.
"Stanford as usual is trying to pour
gasoline on the fire," Franklin
declared. "Its tactics may not be
successful, but I must give the
administrators an E for effort."
Beyers explained that while he
spent 50 minutes on the phone with a

ANTHONY AMSTERDAM
Star-Ledger reporter responding to his
request for information about
Frankl.n. he did not release
information different from that which
he would give concerning any former
Stanford professor.
Beyers noted that he sent the papu
a copy of the report of the Advisory
Board Report on Franklin's case, but
said he also sent Franklin's rejoinder
to that report.
Franklin deplored some of the
comments of the New Jersey
legislators.
Threatened Demonstration
In response to Imperiale's pledge
that he would "lead the biggest
demonstration against that school
[Rutgers) the state has ever seen,"
Franklin l suggested that Imperiale
should lead a demonstration to protest
poverty.
Franklin called Imperiale a "ward
boss from Newark" who is known for
his allegedly anti-black attitudes.
Thorns B. Dunn, another New
Jersey legislator, agreed with
Imperiale's opposition to Franklin.
"It would seem to me that this man
[Franklin) should be in jail instead of

being given a teaching position," he
told the Senate.
Alfred M. Beadleston, the Senate
minority leader, told his colleagues
that "here we have a man who is an
avowed communist and who was
discharged from a very prestigious
university because he told a group of
students to riot. And now he is going
to be on the state payroll."
Franklin, however, accused
Beadleston of distorting the facts of
his case, claiming that he did not urge
students to riot.
Action Defended
Rutgers administrators responded
to the charges of the legislators by
defending its decision to hire Franklin.
"No university worthy of the name
can set tests of political orthodoxy as
a requisite for faculty appointment,"
Rutgers' statement declared. "It is a
bit ironic that some who oppose
Franklin because they disagree with
his political stance do not hesitate to
bring their own political power to
influence the university.
"The lecture halls of any great
university must remain open to all
points of view."
