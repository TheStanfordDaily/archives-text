# Thieu Resigns, Denounces U.S.; Ford Seeking Negotiated Peace
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — President Nguyen
Van Thieu resigned yesterday to pave
the way for a political settlement of
the Vietnam war, but the move was
seen as probably too late to keep the
communists from taking the country
by force.
Thieu and others predicted more
bloodshed ahead as North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong forces massed almost at
the gates of Saigon.
Thieu's resignation, in a tearful,
nationally televised address that
included a bitter denunciation of the
United States, removed him as a major
symbolic obstacle to a negotiated
settlement. But some U.S. officials
questioned if the North
Vietnamese-Viet Cong were interested
now.
Meanwhile, President Ford said last
night the United States was exploring
with a number of countries an
opportunity for negotiating a settlement
of the Vietnam war.
In Paris, French Foreign Minister
Jean Sauvagnargues said France is
making "constant efforts" to get
political talks started and they
probably would be held in Saigon
rather than in the French capital. He
indicated a cease-fire would have to
accompany political negotiations and
said "we are doing everything we can

so that this process begins as shortly as
possible."
However, Ford said in a CBS-TV
interview that "at the moment" a
cease-fire that would assure an orderly
evacuation of Americans and South
Vietnamese "does not seem possible."
Thieu quit with a blast at this
long-time supporter, the United States,
as having "led the South Vietnamese
people to death." He criticized
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for
agreeing to the presence of North
Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam
at the Paris peace talks three years ago.
Thieu said that while Congress is
debating lesser figures, the "$722
million requested by President Gerald
Ford is not even enough for South
Vietnam's armed forces to stop the
North Vietnamese communist troops,
to stabilize the military situation in
order to negotiate firmly."
Singles Out Kissinger
"And the communists know this,"
he said. "So all they need to do is to
escalate their attacks to gain military
victory without the need of
negotiation."
Although Thieu did not name any
famous politicians, he did single out
Kissinger, declaring Kissinger was
unable to perceive that the 1973
cease-fire agreement "led the South
Vietnamese people to death."
No Contact
Ford said there has been no
contact yet with the Saigon
government now headed by Tran Van
Juong, who took over earlier in the
day when President Nguyen Van Thieu
resigned.
Events, he said, were simply moving
too fast for that.
Also, Ford said "there was no
pressure from here for President Thieu
to step down." The communists had
said there could not be a political
settlement with Hanoi so long as he
remained in power.
"After all," Ford said, "he was an
elected head of government,
properly chosen. His decision, as far
as we know, was made totally on his
own."
Some U.S. officials have said they
think the resignation of Thieu may
have come too late to help achieve a

negotiated peace. Other U.S. experts
say the communists are in such a
strong position it is doubtful they will
be willing to negotiate.
'Ripe'
"It sounds like a cliche, but Saigon
is just hanging there, ripe for the
picking," a State Department official
in Washington said. "I can't see why
they would wait and let the fruit fall
when they can just reach for it now."
Ford also said yesterday that Hanoi
could make it all but impossible to
evacuate South Vietnamese without "a
sizable U.S. military commitment."
The same obstacle, he said, could be
posed by South Vietnam.
"That is why we want the military
operations stopped," he said. At the
same time, Ford said there would be
no problem evacuating remaining

American civilians.
Ford criticized the Thieu
government for its "hasty withdrawal"
before advancing North Vietnamese,
forces. But, he said, the "initial
kickoff" of the rout was failure of the
U.S. Congress to supply adequate
military help to the Thieu government.
"I don't think he would have
withdrawn if the support had been
there," Ford said of the South
Vietnamese pullback that allowed
Hanoi's forces to close in toward the
capital. "But the support wasn't there.
Unfortunately, the withdrawal was
done hastily and chaotically."
A $330 million military and
economic aid bill for South Vietnam
was approved by a House committee
yesterday after Kissinger testified the
money is needed to negotiate "a
humane solution" to the war.

SAIGON (AP) — President Nguyen
Van Thieu resigned yesterday to pave
the way for a political settlement of
the Vietnam war, but the move was
seen as probably too late to keep the
communists from taking the country
by force.
Thieu and others predicted more
bloodshed ahead as North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong forces massed almost at
the gates of Saigon.
Thieu's resignation, in a tearful,
nationally televised address that
included a bitter denunciation of the
United States, removed him as a major
symbolic obstacle to a negotiated
settlement. But some U.S. officials
questioned if the North
Vietnamese-Viet Cong were interested
now.
Meanwhile, President Ford said last
night the United States was exploring
with a number of countries an
opportunity for negotiating a settlement
of the Vietnam war.
In Paris, French Foreign Minister
Jean Sauvagnargues said France is
making "constant efforts" to get
political talks started and they
probably would be held in Saigon
rather than in the French capital. He
indicated a cease-fire would have to
accompany political negotiations and
said "we are doing everything we can

so that this process begins as shortly as
possible."
However, Ford said in a CBS-TV
interview that "at the moment" a
cease-fire that would assure an orderly
evacuation of Americans and South
Vietnamese "does not seem possible."
Thieu quit with a blast at this
long-time supporter, the United States,
as having "led the South Vietnamese
people to death." He criticized
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for
agreeing to the presence of North
Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam
at the Paris peace talks three years ago.
Thieu said that while Congress is
debating lesser figures, the "$722
million requested by President Gerald
Ford is not even enough for South
Vietnam's armed forces to stop the
North Vietnamese communist troops,
to stabilize the military situation in
order to negotiate firmly."
Singles Out Kissinger
"And the communists know this,"
he said. "So all they need to do is to
escalate their attacks to gain military
victory without the need of
negotiation."
Although Thieu did not name any
famous politicians, he did single out
Kissinger, declaring Kissinger was
unable to perceive that the 1973
cease-fire agreement "led the South
Vietnamese people to death."
No Contact
Ford said there has been no
contact yet with the Saigon
government now headed by Tran Van
Juong, who took over earlier in the
day when President Nguyen Van Thieu
resigned.
Events, he said, were simply moving
too fast for that.
Also, Ford said "there was no
pressure from here for President Thieu
to step down." The communists had
said there could not be a political
settlement with Hanoi so long as he
remained in power.
"After all," Ford said, "he was an
elected head of government,
properly chosen. His decision, as far
as we know, was made totally on his
own."
Some U.S. officials have said they
think the resignation of Thieu may
have come too late to help achieve a

negotiated peace. Other U.S. experts
say the communists are in such a
strong position it is doubtful they will
be willing to negotiate.
'Ripe'
"It sounds like a cliche, but Saigon
is just hanging there, ripe for the
picking," a State Department official
in Washington said. "I can't see why
they would wait and let the fruit fall
when they can just reach for it now."
Ford also said yesterday that Hanoi
could make it all but impossible to
evacuate South Vietnamese without "a
sizable U.S. military commitment."
The same obstacle, he said, could be
posed by South Vietnam.
"That is why we want the military
operations stopped," he said. At the
same time, Ford said there would be
no problem evacuating remaining

American civilians.
Ford criticized the Thieu
government for its "hasty withdrawal"
before advancing North Vietnamese,
forces. But, he said, the "initial
kickoff" of the rout was failure of the
U.S. Congress to supply adequate
military help to the Thieu government.
"I don't think he would have
withdrawn if the support had been
there," Ford said of the South
Vietnamese pullback that allowed
Hanoi's forces to close in toward the
capital. "But the support wasn't there.
Unfortunately, the withdrawal was
done hastily and chaotically."
