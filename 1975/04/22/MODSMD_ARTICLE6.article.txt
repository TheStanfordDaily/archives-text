# Housing Office Snafu Misassigns Students
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
An error in the computing process
that randomly selected the current
freshmen who would remain on
campus next year misassigned an
unknown number of them yesterday,
according to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton.
In several cases, freshmen who had
opted to remain off campus next year
received widely coveted spaces in the
housing system, Horton said.
Horton called the mistake, "a
relatively minor error that certainly
won't cause any massive
complications," but added that he did
not know exactly how many of the 94
students who had chosen off-campus
housing had been affected by the
mistake.
Twenty pairs of freshmen came to
the housing office to switch options
yesterday according to Sue Espinosa,
administrative assistant in the Housing
Office.
Horton said that any students who
wished to remain off campus next year

would "automatically be granted that
option," providing that he or she
comes to the housing office before
they draw in the housing draw.
He added that such students should
come to the office either with another
student who wishes to trade, or alone,
in which case the housing office will
reallocate their spaces to wait-listed
freshmen.
Option Swap
As a result of the error, many
freshmen have already traded their
sophomore-year-on-campus options
with classmates. Others have organized
dorm meetings to decide how to
remedy their situation.
At least two freshmen are trying to
peddle their on-campus options for a
$35 to $50 profit according to one
freshman who has made arrangements
to "buy" another student's housing
priority status. Several students said
that they also had heard rumors of the
dealings.
Horton called this idea of selling
options an "ugly and pernicious
notion that goes against the spirit of
the whole system." He added that he
had no substantive evidence that it has
occured.
Action Threatened
Horton said that if the "black
market" peddling did occur, the
housing office may have students
come in and sign lists and not be able
to choose a trading partner. In that
case, he said, the office would
distribute next year's on-campus
options on a first-come, first-serve
basis.
Espinosa said that she had asked
each student who had come in if they
had known about the illegal dealing.
"They were incredulous at the idea,"
she said.
According to most students,
however, the actual black market
peddling does not seem to be
widespread. "It was kind of an obvious
thing to have cross your mind," said
Martha Freeman, a freshman in
Arroyo, "but not seriously." She said,
though, that it was very easy for her to
trade her option to a friend. 'There
are plenty of takers," she said.
