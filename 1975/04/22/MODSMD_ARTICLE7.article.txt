# 'Belter Communication' Sought
## Stanford Officials Brief Council 
### JON BIGELOW 
Three University officials appeared
before the Palo Alto City Council last
night to describe the present budget
situation at Stanford, in what Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig called an "effort to
communicate better with our
neighbors across El Camino."
The trio, which also included
Provost William Miller and Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger, briefed the
Council on proposed building and
development as well as the growing
budget squeeze.
The presentation dwelled heavily
upon the University's "search for
long-term financial stability," in
Miller's words. "Budgetary equilibrium
will hopefully be achieved," Miller
told the Council, adding that one way
in which such an equilibrium will be
reached will be through keeping the
student body constant in size.
"There will be a relatively small
amount of change" in this area, he

said.
Miller stressed the point, however,
that a "first and foremost assumption
is that we will maintain academic
excellence."
He also said that the University will
continue to expand "support service,"
and that the affirmative action
program will be pursued more
vigorously. "We will assure equity and
fairness to each individual," he said.
Miller produced several slides
showing the makeup of the University
budget, and explained to the Council
that although the budget in "current
dollars" is growing, in real or constant
dollars it has decreased over the last
two years.
Miller told the Council that the
University must take $10 million out

of its budget over the next 10 years.
Augsburger took over the
presentation to describe the
development currently under way on
campus as well as proposed
improvements in the physical plant.
He noted that budget restraints are
a major factor in deciding
development plans, but said that in
addition, "it is of singular importance
that the appearance of the campus be
maintained."
He went on to say that the increase
of 670,000 square feet of building
space represented by current and
proposed construction will increase
the current building space by 12
percent. Presently the University owns
5,600,000 square feet of building
space.

Three University officials appeared
before the Palo Alto City Council last
night to describe the present budget
situation at Stanford, in what Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig called an "effort to
communicate better with our
neighbors across El Camino."
The trio, which also included
Provost William Miller and Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger, briefed the
Council on proposed building and
development as well as the growing
budget squeeze.
The presentation dwelled heavily
upon the University's "search for
long-term financial stability," in
Miller's words. "Budgetary equilibrium
will hopefully be achieved," Miller
told the Council, adding that one way
in which such an equilibrium will be
reached will be through keeping the
student body constant in size.
"There will be a relatively small
amount of change" in this area, he

said.
Miller stressed the point, however,
that a "first and foremost assumption
is that we will maintain academic
excellence."
He also said that the University will
continue to expand "support service,"
and that the affirmative action
program will be pursued more
vigorously. "We will assure equity and
fairness to each individual," he said.
Miller produced several slides
showing the makeup of the University
budget, and explained to the Council
that although the budget in "current
dollars" is growing, in real or constant
dollars it has decreased over the last
two years.
Miller told the Council that the
University must take $10 million out

of its budget over the next 10 years.
Augsburger took over the
presentation to describe the
development currently under way on
campus as well as proposed
improvements in the physical plant.
He noted that budget restraints are
a major factor in deciding
development plans, but said that in
addition, "it is of singular importance
that the appearance of the campus be
maintained."
He went on to say that the increase
of 670,000 square feet of building
space represented by current and
proposed construction will increase
the current building space by 12
percent. Presently the University owns
5,600,000 square feet of building
space.
