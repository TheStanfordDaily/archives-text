## Lyman's Attack 
### 
President Lyman's harsh response to our April 1'
editorial criticizing the new Committee of 15 (C-15)
proposals entirely misses the point of that editorial.
Lyman, opening his KZSU Campus Conference
appearance with a seven-minute statement, attacked phrases
in the editorial without ever coming to grips with the two
arguments we presented.
At that time, we urged students to vote NO on the C-15
proposals for a new Campus Judicial Panel (CjP) because it
provides for a faculty majority in some cases and because it
calls for different methods of selecting student and faculty
representatives.
We do not believe that Lyman answered any of the
arguments we made, and are disappointed that he refused to
deal with our main points. In fact, when questioned about
why students should legitimize these features (to which they
have been strongly opposed in past elections), Lyman said
only "you'll have to ask the C-15 about that."
The C-15 hasn't given us a satisfactory response to the
points we made last week. We doubt that such an answer
exists. Lyman, by picking on certain phrases and ignoring
the substance of our editorial, is only obfuscating the issue.
The one phrase in our editorial which the President
seemed most upset about was "the time may again come
when the University uses the CJP to impede demonstrators."
He challenged us to cite an example of use of the CJP for
that purpose.
We find it astonishing that Lyman can deny the CJP was
used to weed out persons that the University thought were
troublemakers. The record of the period shows that this
kind of prosecution did occur.
In 1971-1972, the first year of the CJP's operation, more
than 10 students were suspended for long periods of time
for participating in demonstrations involving the Placement
Center, the Academic Council and a class taught by
Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley.
Lyman also urged students to give "fairer and more
thoughtful treatment " to the proposal than it received in
the Daily editorial. We do not quite know how Lyman
judged our fairness or thoughtfulness. We do, however,
reiterate our considered opinion that students vote NO on
the C-15 system tomorrow and Thursday.
