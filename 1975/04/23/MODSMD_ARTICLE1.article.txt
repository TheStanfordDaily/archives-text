# New Report Claims GPA Only 3.31

### STEPHEN CARTER 
A study by two undergraduates
claims that the average grade point
average (CPA) of undergraduates here
is 3.31, not 3.43 as suggested by a
study released earlier by the
Registrar's Office.
The new report comes in the wake
of statistics released by the Registrar's
Office indicating that "grade
inflation" eased last quarter. The
Registrar's new statistics indicate that
the proportion of A's fell six
percentage points from winter quarter,
1974.
The discrepancy in GPA figures
stems from a difference in
methodology, according to the new
study's authors, Jeffrey Stoler and
Bonny Rodden. "The rub, in short,
lies in the fact that the registrar is
calculating the average grade given
undergraduates, not the average GPA
of undergraduates," the report
explains.
The average GPA in the
Rodden-Stoler report is calculated by
first determining the GPA's of
individual students, then adding these
and dividing by the number of
students. The registrar's method
added up grade units (the value of the
grade multiplied by the number of
units the course is worth) for an entire
group of students, then divided by the
number of units the entire group
completed.
'Subtle' Difference
Rodden emphasized that she and
Stoler do not claim that the registrar's
figures were incorrect, but that the
Office "let the media get away with
assuming that their figures meant
average GPA."
Asst. Statistics Prof. Thomas Sager,
for whose class the two prepared the
report, called the difference in
methodology "subtle." However, he
