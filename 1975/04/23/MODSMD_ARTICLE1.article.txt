# New Report Claims GPA Only 3.31
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
A study by two undergraduates
claims that the average grade point
average (CPA) of undergraduates here
is 3.31, not 3.43 as suggested by a
study released earlier by the
Registrar's Office.
The new report comes in the wake
of statistics released by the Registrar's
Office indicating that "grade
inflation" eased last quarter. The
Registrar's new statistics indicate that
the proportion of A's fell six
percentage points from winter quarter,
1974.
The discrepancy in GPA figures
stems from a difference in
methodology, according to the new
study's authors, Jeffrey Stoler and
Bonny Rodden. "The rub, in short,
lies in the fact that the registrar is
calculating the average grade given
undergraduates, not the average GPA
of undergraduates," the report
explains.
The average GPA in the
Rodden-Stoler report is calculated by
first determining the GPA's of
individual students, then adding these
and dividing by the number of
students. The registrar's method
added up grade units (the value of the
grade multiplied by the number of
units the course is worth) for an entire
group of students, then divided by the
number of units the entire group
completed.
'Subtle' Difference
Rodden emphasized that she and
Stoler do not claim that the registrar's
figures were incorrect, but that the
Office "let the media get away with
assuming that their figures meant
average GPA."
Asst. Statistics Prof. Thomas Sager,
for whose class the two prepared the
report, called the difference in
methodology "subtle." However, he
stated, "The method of selecting the
sample was valid and the method used
in analysis was valid."
Sager called the study "important,"
adding that the students drew "an
important distinction between average
grade and average grade point
average."
He agreed with the authors that the
registrar had simply computed the
average grade given. "There has been
some confusion that the average grade
is the average grade point average," he
said. "The study makes clear that this
isn't the case."
Rodden's and Stoler's sample
consisted of roughly one percent of
the undergraduate student body,
chosen entirely at random. They "used
transcripts of undergraduates who
completed fall, winter and spring
quarters during the academic year
1973-74," according to the report.
CEEB Standards
The authors then used standards set
by the College Entrance Examination
Board (CEEB), and excluded "all
physical education and art classes
which are graded solely on attendance

and physical performance and ... all
classes taken pass/fail or incomplete."
They also employed the CEEB's
weighing value for grades, including
4.333 for A+, 3.667 for A- and so
forth. They also weighted courses
according to the number of units each
course was worth, which the
registrar's study did not.
The study also indicated that grades
climbed slightly over the course of the
year. The average GPA in autumn was
3.22, in winter was 3.31 and in spring
was 3.32. Moreover, the authors
discovered that about twice as many
minuses as plusses are given.
Meanwhile, the Registrar's Office's
newest report notes that in the School
of Humanities and Sciences, the
proportion of A's given fell from 42
percent in winter of 1974 to 36
percent in winter of 1975. The
corresponding proportions were 39
and 36 in engineering, and 42 and 39
in earth sciences.
Although other grades remained
roughly the same, the proportions of
incompletes and grades of no credit
rose from nine percent in winter of
1974 to 12 percent last quarter.

Asst. Statistics Prof. Thomas Sager,
for whose class the two prepared the
report, called the difference in
methodology "subtle." However, he
stated, "The method of selecting the
sample was valid and the method used
in analysis was valid."
Sager called the study "important,"
adding that the students drew "an
important distinction between average
grade and average grade point
average."
He agreed with the authors that the
registrar had simply computed the
average grade given. "There has been
some confusion that the average grade
is the average grade point average," he
said. "The study makes clear that this
isn't the case."
Rodden's and Stoler's sample
consisted of roughly one percent of
the undergraduate student body,
chosen entirely at random. They "used
transcripts of undergraduates who
completed fall, winter and spring
quarters during the academic year
1973-74," according to the report.
CEEB Standards
The authors then used standards set
by the College Entrance Examination
Board (CEEB), and excluded "all
physical education and art classes
which are graded solely on attendance

and physical performance and ... all
classes taken pass/fail or incomplete."
They also employed the CEEB's
weighing value for grades, including
4.333 for A+, 3.667 for A- and so
forth. They also weighted courses
according to the number of units each
course was worth, which the
registrar's study did not.
The study also indicated that grades
climbed slightly over the course of the
year. The average GPA in autumn was
3.22, in winter was 3.31 and in spring
was 3.32. Moreover, the authors
discovered that about twice as many
minuses as plusses are given.
Meanwhile, the Registrar's Office's
newest report notes that in the School
of Humanities and Sciences, the
proportion of A's given fell from 42
percent in winter of 1974 to 36
percent in winter of 1975. The
corresponding proportions were 39
and 36 in engineering, and 42 and 39
in earth sciences.
Although other grades remained
roughly the same, the proportions of
incompletes and grades of no credit
rose from nine percent in winter of
1974 to 12 percent last quarter.
A study by two undergraduates
claims that the average grade point
average (CPA) of undergraduates here
is 3.31, not 3.43 as suggested by a
study released earlier by the
Registrar's Office.
The new report comes in the wake
of statistics released by the Registrar's
Office indicating that "grade
inflation" eased last quarter. The
Registrar's new statistics indicate that
the proportion of A's fell six
percentage points from winter quarter,
1974.
The discrepancy in GPA figures
stems from a difference in
methodology, according to the new
study's authors, Jeffrey Stoler and
Bonny Rodden. "The rub, in short,
lies in the fact that the registrar is
calculating the average grade given
undergraduates, not the average GPA
of undergraduates," the report
explains.
The average GPA in the
Rodden-Stoler report is calculated by
first determining the GPA's of
individual students, then adding these
and dividing by the number of
students. The registrar's method
added up grade units (the value of the
grade multiplied by the number of
units the course is worth) for an entire
group of students, then divided by the
number of units the entire group
completed.
'Subtle' Difference
Rodden emphasized that she and
Stoler do not claim that the registrar's
figures were incorrect, but that the
Office "let the media get away with
assuming that their figures meant
average GPA."
