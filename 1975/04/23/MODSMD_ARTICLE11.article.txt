# Constitutional Sexism: Coverup
## 
### Terry Anzur 
Cosmetics are usually regarded as the
primary concern of narcissistic women. But
when the issue is cosmetic reform, a lot of
people get into the act.
Proposition 11 on the California ballot
last November was formulated to dry up and
heal sexist blemishes on the state
constitution. Its proponents argued that
eliminating masculine references to
office-holders would emphasize equal
opportunity for both men and women to
participate in politics.
The only audible opposition seemed to
come from a few old-fashioned word-freaks
who balked at words like "chairone" and
asserted that "man," in reference to
humanity in general, is an acceptable,
non-sexist English usage. And then there was
the claim that revision was unnecessary,
because equal participation is a right already
granted.
But arguments against Prop. 11 didn't
pick up much steam alongside a gubernatorial
campaign that included more pro-women
promises than a suffragette meeting. The
measure passed — but not by much. A mere
44,003 votes separated 2,592,901 yes votes
and 2,548,898 no's.
Anti-Sexist Mandate?
The issue quietly cropped up on The Farm
last week in the form of a ballot referendum
on "de-sexing" the ASSU Constitution.
Surely, an electorate of liberal, enlightened
student voters would return a much more
definitive mandate against sexism than state
voters did.
It was possible for dormitory residents to
make a pre-election trip to the bathroom
without seeing a single leaflet for or against
the word change; no leaflets were distributed.
Amidst proposals for a women's building and
plans to enhance the status of female
graduates, virtually nothing was said about
the proposed constitutional revision.

In an era when a viable ASSU Council of
Presidents slate must include at least one
woman, something as simple as a non-sexist
word change seemed a foregone conclusion.
No Squabbling
Nor was there any quibbling over how the
changes should be made. ASSU Sen. Kevin
McDermott said he had drafted a bill
specifying changes such as "the financial
manager" or "he or she" for "he"and
substituting "him or her" for "him."
McDermott said he "cringed at the thought

of 's/he.' " The Senate eventually acted on a
bill authored by Sen. Charlotte Germane,
which calls for word changes at the
parliamentarian's discretion. Germane's bill
slid through the Senate after relatively little
debate.
At the polls, students voted 1838 to 920
in favor of the changes, two votes short of
the necessary two-thirds majority. Whether
the ASSU constitution remains "sexist"
hinges on the votes of students at overseas
campuses.
Either way, the decision is not likely to
represent a landmark victory or defeat in the
struggle for equal rights and status for
women. Of course, women who do hold
office might feel somewhat more
comfortable about the constitutional charter
of their duties. Peg Holm, recently elected
president of the Student Bar Association at

the University of Santa Clara Law School,
told me that reading about the duties of the
president — assumed to be a "he" — strikes a
strange note.
Unfortunately, beyond the grassroots level
of student and special-interest group politics,
too few women have attained a position in
which a sexist constitutional wording would
cause discomfort. The women's movement
has raised consciousness of the right to equal
participation and, in that sense, has helped
many qualified women to win elections. But,
by and large, the women who hold office
today got their start in pre-women's
movement days, in times when a woman who
merely asked to fill out a law school
application was a novelty.
Constitutional revision, like pimple cream,
clears up the problem on the surface. But the
attitudes behind governmental bylaws are not
likely to change overnight. Most college-age
women can remember being encouraged to
play house while their brothers played
astronaut or cops and robbers. Of these
women, the ones who are elected or
appointed to political offices will have to
spend a lot of time proving that their
qualifications, and not affirmative action
alone, put them in a seat of power.
Eliminating sexist constitutional
references is an undeniable step in the right
direction. But the short-range effects of word
changes in the ASSU Constitution are likely
to be as invisible as its supporters were in last
week's election.
"Secretaries?" exclaimed the female voice
on the ASSU telephone. "Why, all the
secretaries here are women." If overseas
campus voters lean against sexism, maybe the
ASSU secretary who types the revised
constitution will feel better about her
"government" job.
