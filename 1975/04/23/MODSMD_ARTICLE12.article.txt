# Why Grant Professors Tenure?

William Hoke

Last quarter, a major topic of
discussion was tenure and the
major focus was the denial of
tenure to Jerry Irish. Generally, it
was argued that teaching
competence should be more

considered in tenure decisions.
What disturbed me most about
the tenure discussions was that
students reverently stepped
around the ultimate sacred cow of
education, the issue of tenure
itself. Certainly one of the major
reasons universities are
unresponsive to their students is
that tenure makes their faculty
responsible to no one. I think it is
coming time to face the issue of
tenure and decide whether tenure,
at least in its present form, should
be preserved.
Lifetime Guarantees
What is tenure? It means the
effective guarantee of
employment for life. It effectively
guarantees employment in the
sense that the bounds upon
performance or behavior are set so
wide that few people need to
worry about overstepping them.
In one sense, all employed people
are employed for life, except that
the bounds on performance are
set much narrower.
Tenure is first of all an
extraordinary privilege. Who
wouldn't want a job for life?
Tenure is not unique to
education; federal judges have
tenure, civil servants and many
labor contracts have an emphasis
on job security that is very close
to tenure. But still I cannot accept
that tenure, particularly for
high-paying or prestigious jobs,
should be a right for anyone.
If tenure is granted, sound
reasons must be given which show
either social goods that result or
evils that are avoided.
Tenure and academic freedom
are always spoken in the same
breath and the meaning of
academic freedom usually given is
the right, in an academic setting,
to say or write what one feels like.
But freedom of speech (and
writing) is already protected by

the U.S. Constitution. The issue
really is whether in addition to
freedom of speech and writing
one should get the privilege of a
forced audience or payment for
the speech or writing. Latitude of
course should be given; any good
(and smart) employer gives his
employees latitude on the job, but
bounds on what is acceptable and
requirements of competence are
as valid in the classroom as on any
other job.
Protection Necessary?
Academic freedom with
respect to research seems to mean
that one can pursue research in
whatever direction (and with
whatever implication) the person
chooses. Should we protect this
divergence? To a certain extent
yes, but I find the position of a
faculty member, protected by
tenure, working for an
unsympathetic or maybe hostile
administration unsatisfactory.
Rather than have such extreme
diversity within a single
institution, it might be better to
have the diversity between
institutions.
Diversity is clearly important
to a university, in fact that is
what we mean by a university,
but it can be adequately protected
without the extreme and
unnecessary protection of tenure.
Please remember that the right to
do research (possibly unpopular)
should never imply the right to be
paid for doing that research.
Fixed-Term Contracts
There are alternatives to tenure
that will protect us from abuses;
we only need to use our
imagination to think of them.
Personally I favor a series of
fixed-term, but renewable
contracts. I think 10 years is more
than enough time to play around
in.
The fact is simply that we

don't have to have tenure in order
to protect certain valued aspects
of education. Right now far, far
too high a price in tenure is paid
for the benefits society receives
from education and the dangers it
avoids.
However, I expect the
development of sensible
alternatives will be difficult, for
the generally intelligent and
rational arguments of college
professors dissolve into nonsense
when tenure is discussed.

on job security that is very close
to tenure. But still I cannot accept
that tenure, particularly for
high-paying or prestigious jobs,
should be a right for anyone.
If tenure is granted, sound
reasons must be given which show
either social goods that result or
evils that are avoided.
Tenure and academic freedom
are always spoken in the same
breath and the meaning of
academic freedom usually given is
the right, in an academic setting,
to say or write what one feels like.
But freedom of speech (and
writing) is already protected by

the U.S. Constitution. The issue
really is whether in addition to
freedom of speech and writing
one should get the privilege of a
forced audience or payment for
the speech or writing. Latitude of
course should be given; any good
(and smart) employer gives his
employees latitude on the job, but
bounds on what is acceptable and
requirements of competence are
as valid in the classroom as on any
other job.
Protection Necessary?
Academic freedom with
respect to research seems to mean
that one can pursue research in
whatever direction (and with
whatever implication) the person
chooses. Should we protect this
divergence? To a certain extent
yes, but I find the position of a
faculty member, protected by
tenure, working for an
unsympathetic or maybe hostile
administration unsatisfactory.
Rather than have such extreme
diversity within a single
institution, it might be better to
have the diversity between
institutions.
Diversity is clearly important
to a university, in fact that is
what we mean by a university,
but it can be adequately protected
without the extreme and
unnecessary protection of tenure.
Please remember that the right to
do research (possibly unpopular)
should never imply the right to be
paid for doing that research.
Fixed-Term Contracts
There are alternatives to tenure
that will protect us from abuses;
we only need to use our
imagination to think of them.
Personally I favor a series of
fixed-term, but renewable
contracts. I think 10 years is more
than enough time to play around
in.
The fact is simply that we

don't have to have tenure in order
to protect certain valued aspects
of education. Right now far, far
too high a price in tenure is paid
for the benefits society receives
from education and the dangers it
avoids.
However, I expect the
development of sensible
alternatives will be difficult, for
the generally intelligent and
rational arguments of college
professors dissolve into nonsense
when tenure is discussed.

Last quarter, a major topic of
discussion was tenure and the
major focus was the denial of
tenure to Jerry Irish. Generally, it
was argued that teaching
competence should be more

considered in tenure decisions.
What disturbed me most about
the tenure discussions was that
students reverently stepped
around the ultimate sacred cow of
education, the issue of tenure
itself. Certainly one of the major
reasons universities are
unresponsive to their students is
that tenure makes their faculty
responsible to no one. I think it is
coming time to face the issue of
tenure and decide whether tenure,
at least in its present form, should
be preserved.
Lifetime Guarantees
What is tenure? It means the
effective guarantee of
employment for life. It effectively
guarantees employment in the
sense that the bounds upon
performance or behavior are set so
wide that few people need to
worry about overstepping them.
In one sense, all employed people
are employed for life, except that
the bounds on performance are
set much narrower.
Tenure is first of all an
extraordinary privilege. Who
wouldn't want a job for life?
Tenure is not unique to
education; federal judges have
tenure, civil servants and many
labor contracts have an emphasis
on job security that is very close
to tenure. But still I cannot accept
that tenure, particularly for
high-paying or prestigious jobs,
should be a right for anyone.
