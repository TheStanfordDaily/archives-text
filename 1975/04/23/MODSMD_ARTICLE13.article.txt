# Fear Of Draw
## 
### 
Randy Schut

It's spring and time once again
for the annual Spring Housing
Draw. Very soon we will see
many very unhappy people who
have discovered that their next
residence is going to be
somewhere in the high-rent
district across the railroad tracks,
a pleasant, three-mile, pothole
dodging bicycle ride through the
rain from campus.
These lucky people might very
well ask the question: "Why isn't
there enough housing to meet the
demand at Stanford?" This is not
a strange question.
Stanford has a long tradition of
not providing enough housing for
students. In 1969, Manzanita Park
("the trailers") was thrown up to
help alleviate the housing crunch
that had existed for several years
prior to that time.
This residence was to be a
temporary fixture on campus,
calculated to pay for itself after
five years (and to be replaced at
that time, I assume). Six years
later, the housing situation is
worse than ever and the trailers
are still standing.
So why isn't there enough
housing'? If one asks Assoc. Dean
Larry Horton, he'll point out that
the University is currently adding
100 more spaces to Florence
Moore and that three Row Houses
are on the drawing boards with
150 spaces due for occupancy in
Sept. 1976.
"Will that provide enough
housing?" one might ask Horton.
"No," he'll admit. But he
recommended in a report last
summer ("Undergraduate Housing
Needs at Stanford 1974-1984")
that a new dorm be built down
the street from Lagunita, the first
units to be completed in 1978,
the last in 1982. And that should
solve most of the current housing
problem.
"So why isn't this dorm being
built?" one might innocently ask.
"And why isn't housing being
planned to replace Manzanita?"
Well, there isn't enough
money; not enough contributions,
Horton claims. There's a
recession. And one can't build
without money. One can't get
money unless it's borrowed. And
Stanford doesn't borrow to build
buildings, except of course to
build academic buildings like the
Chemistry Building and the new
addition to the Main Library. But
not for housing. This might seem
backwards since the debts
incurred by building housing
could be recovered from room
rents over the next several
decades, whereas new academic
buildings have no income. But no
matter.
Why can't money be diverted
from other projects? Why is only
$3 million allocated for housing
of the $300 million contribution
drive?
If one asks President Richard
Lyman he will say it's simply a
matter of priorities. A university
without an adequate library is no
university at all, whereas most
universities in the world exist
without any dormitories, he
claims. And some exist without
any students, one might mumble
with a sigh.
So students should enjoy the
spring. It's going to be a cold,
rainy winter next year at this
great University. And the year
after that, and the year after
that. . ..

incurred by building housing
could be recovered from room
rents over the next several
decades, whereas new academic
buildings have no income. But no
matter.
Why can't money be diverted
from other projects? Why is only
$3 million allocated for housing
of the $300 million contribution
drive?
If one asks President Richard
Lyman he will say it's simply a
matter of priorities. A university
without an adequate library is no
university at all, whereas most
universities in the world exist
without any dormitories, he
claims. And some exist without
any students, one might mumble
with a sigh.
So students should enjoy the
spring. It's going to be a cold,
rainy winter next year at this
great University. And the year
after that, and the year after
that. . ..

It's spring and time once again
for the annual Spring Housing
Draw. Very soon we will see
many very unhappy people who
have discovered that their next
residence is going to be
somewhere in the high-rent
district across the railroad tracks,
a pleasant, three-mile, pothole
dodging bicycle ride through the
rain from campus.
These lucky people might very
well ask the question: "Why isn't
there enough housing to meet the
demand at Stanford?" This is not
a strange question.
Stanford has a long tradition of
not providing enough housing for
students. In 1969, Manzanita Park
("the trailers") was thrown up to
help alleviate the housing crunch
that had existed for several years
prior to that time.
This residence was to be a
temporary fixture on campus,
calculated to pay for itself after
five years (and to be replaced at
that time, I assume). Six years
later, the housing situation is
worse than ever and the trailers
are still standing.
So why isn't there enough
housing'? If one asks Assoc. Dean
Larry Horton, he'll point out that
the University is currently adding
100 more spaces to Florence
Moore and that three Row Houses
are on the drawing boards with
150 spaces due for occupancy in
Sept. 1976.
"Will that provide enough
housing?" one might ask Horton.
"No," he'll admit. But he
recommended in a report last
summer ("Undergraduate Housing
Needs at Stanford 1974-1984")
that a new dorm be built down
the street from Lagunita, the first
units to be completed in 1978,
the last in 1982. And that should
solve most of the current housing
problem.
"So why isn't this dorm being
built?" one might innocently ask.
"And why isn't housing being
planned to replace Manzanita?"
Well, there isn't enough
money; not enough contributions,
Horton claims. There's a
recession. And one can't build
without money. One can't get
money unless it's borrowed. And
Stanford doesn't borrow to build
buildings, except of course to
build academic buildings like the
Chemistry Building and the new
addition to the Main Library. But
not for housing. This might seem
backwards since the debts
incurred by building housing
could be recovered from room
rents over the next several
decades, whereas new academic
buildings have no income. But no
matter.
