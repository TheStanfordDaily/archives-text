## KGO's Russ Coughlan: A Man Behind The Tube Personalities Plus 
### STEVE HEFTER Steve Hefter 
"With a sanctimonious attitude
about him Wallace [CBS's Mike
Wallace] says to me, 'tuh, your
reporter found a dick on the
railroad track' — and then he pays
Haldeman $50,000.
"Which is the more heinous of
crimes, Van [KGO news
announcer Van Amburg] talking
about a guy whose dick was on
the railroad track or paying that
son-of-a-bitch Haldeman
$50,000?"
That's Russ Coughlan talking
and Russ Coughlan is candid and
to the point. He's never gone to
college and he never graduated
from high school.
Yet despite this, Russ
Coughlan is the general manager
of one of the Bay Area's most
influential mediums: San
Francisco's ABC TV affiliate —
KGO TV, channel seven.
Tall And Friendly
Coughlan is a 6-foot 3-inchish,
distinguished white-haired
manager who controls the 252
employees at KGO from an office
equipped with four
wood-panel-encased televisions
tuned into KGO and the local
competition.
His voice is reassuring and
resonant; qualities that allow him
to deliver the station's editorials
in a friendly and casual manner.
But Russ Coughlan is more
than just a tall editorial-delivering
general manager. He's honest and
professional; at least that's what
he strives for.
"There's two things I expect of
people here," Coughlan says.
"Number one is that they be
professional and number two is
that they be honest with me at all
times. And come to think of it,
I'm not so sure the two aren't the
same thing."
Helping People
Coughlan is relaxed. Program
director Jim Tuverson comes in
the office with some good news.
Coughlan is pleased, and with a
wee bit of reluctance, after
Tuverson leaves, he spills the
beans.
"We're going to try to
straighten up the whole county
jail," he says with eyes fixed on
this reporter and hands clasped
together on the desk.
"The object for this station for
this year is going to be 'People
like us, we like people.' But now
we're getting down to the
nitty-gritty of what we can do.
The real function is to do good —
I know it sounds corny... .
"This is going to be a year of
action. We are people who are
going to get things done. We went
down and I spent a day in the
county jail. And it was
terrible . . . you can buy dope in
every cell; it's an insane place.
"When I came back I realized
that we could do something to
straighten it out."
Coughlan tells of how he plans

on bringing in facilities to teach
the inmates, of whom 60 percent
can't read. He notes that "We've
got a gimmick that's going to
make every legislator sit up and
say 'we've got to do something
about it.' "
And with the temptation too
irresistible to suppress, he
compares his efforts to the
competition.
"To sit around and send
Marilyn Baker [KPIX news
reporter] out to find out that the
cops are taking pay-offs in the
Tenderloin area is crap. That's
crap because it's always been
going on and will always go on.

"That's not . discovering
anything — that's always been
there. We've discovered what's
wrong with the county jail and
we're going to solve it."
The friendly general manager
slides his chair away from his desk
and in a casual hands-grasped
behind the head, feet up on the
desk pose, notes that he follows
the simple formula for general
managers suggested by the FCC.
"If you really honest to God,

honest to God in your heart
followed this simple formula of
operating in the interest,
convenience and necessity of the
people, if we all lived our lives this
way, every body'd be better off."
'Cockeyed Optimist'
As Coughlan admits himself,
he's quite the "cockeyed
optimist." Before becoming
general manager in 1972, he
served as general sales manager for
12 years and in talent.
"If you want to be general
manager, in my opinion," stresses
Coughlan, "you have to be a
minstrel. You've had to do all the
funny dances, sung all the funny
songs, worked all the dirty shifts,
done all the tough things before
you get to an understanding of
how you're going to communicate
with people."
And as for people, Coughlan
tries to understand them all.

"We just did a study indicating
that the average person with one
year of college looks at TV 3.2
hours per day compared with 7.5
hours of the average non-college
educated person.
"This is because the guy with
the better education has been
trained to read, trained to look,
trained to appreciate more
sophisticated things. I know this
because I never went to college
and never finished high school."
Questions
With this knowledge,
Coughlan, like all general

managers, has to decide on whom
should the station focus its
attention. Should KGO try to
capture the college-educated
audience by changing the format
of programs or by introducing
new ones?
Or should the station make a
conscious effort to "gear" its
programming and content to the
non-college educated who watches
7.5 hours a day?
Coughlan answers these
questions in terms of news, a
major organ in the life of a local
station.

"I think that news is not for
the informed, but news is for the
uninformed," Coughlan points
out.
"The reason why 65 percent of
the American public look to
television for their news is because
it's simple, it explains to them, it
isn't petty or wordy and you
don't have to turn 10 pages of the
New York Times to find out
what's going on — because the
average guy isn't going to do
that."
Money And Minorities
As for advertising dollars,
Coughlan realizes their
importance but notes that "at no
cost can we [a television station]
let advertisers dictate what goes
on the air."
Coughlan also indicates that
28.5 percent of the station's
employees are minorities, but that
the catching up is finished, and he
now hires on an equal basis.
"There's no doubt that the
television industry had been a
racist institution for a long time
and we had a lot of catching up to
do," he says.
'Crummy Bastard'
Russ Coughlan doesn't hesitate
to reveal his personal
philosophies. "That crummy

bastard ought to be in jail," he
says of Bob Haldeman. But that's
a personal view; a view he easily
divorces when delivering KGO
editorials.
Of editorials he says, "We're
trying to get more dimension.
We've got to be issue oriented,
we've got to discuss things people
will react to. If we don't make
people think, we shouldn't do
them."
People
For Coughlan, the television
business, and it is a business,

comes down to people. "Interest,
convenience and necessity," he
says over and over.
He knows he can't please
everybody and realizes that
students at Stanford may never
even flick a TV switch. But the
fact remains that television is
perhaps the single most influential
medium in this country and even
intellectuals have to confront its
importance.
The confrontation begins with
an understanding of a man like
KGO-TV's Russ Coughlan: a man
behind the tube.



BEHIND THE SCENES— KGO-TV's general manager Russ Coughlan is candid and to the point. He never went to college and never even
finished high school, yet he rose to the top of San Francisco's ABC-TV affiliate. He labels "interest, convenience and necessity," as the
primary concerns for a general manager and he has put his words into action with a plan to help educate the inmates of the county jail. Such
is his power.
