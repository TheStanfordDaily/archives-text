## Martin Luther King At Stanford 
### 
Eleven years ago today the Western States
Civil Rights Conference began in White
Memorial Plaza with an address by Martin
Luther King.
In a one-column story on the front page
of the Thursday, April 23,1964 Daily, King
was described as "one of the strongest
advocates of non-violent resistance in the
fight for civil liberties for the Negro."
In that same issue of the Daily it was
reported that 9644 boxes of animal crackers
had been ordered by the Tresidder store that
year.
"Animal Cracker eaters are devoted to
their snack," the story mentioned before
quoting one of the Tresidder clerks as
saying, " They [the animal cracker eaters]
come in here every day, just as regular
clockwork ... I know what they're going to
get right when they come in," the clerk said.
The story also noted cases of two and
three-box-a-day eaters.
Another story focused on the day
before's speech by former press secretary to
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and then
U.S. senatorial candidate, Pierre Salinger.
Discussing the key issue of civil rights
Salinger was quoted as saying, "The denial
of civil rights — particularly the denial of
civil rights to Negroes — has been a weight

on America's conscience since before we
became a nation.
Supporting both the proposed Civil
Rights Bill and the Rumford Fair Housing
Act, Salinger told a Memorial Auditorium
crowd, "Our goal is and must be equality of
opportunity — the right of access to the
fields that make for human happiness. Let
everyone, of every color and persuasion,
have exactly the same opportunity to find
himself good housing, a good job, good
education. This is not only what we have to
do, but what we should and will do because
it is morally and ethically the right thing to
do."
In the next day's paper, King's speech
was reported and the civil rights leader was
quoted as telling an enthusiastic crowd of
over 1800, "It would be encouraging to us if
Mr. Hoover and the FBI would be as diligent
in apprehending those responsible for
bombing churches and killing little children
as they are in seeking out alleged communist
infiltration in the civil rights movement."
King also quoted then Attorney General
Robert Kennedy saying, "It is natural and
inevitable that communists have made
efforts to infiltrate the civil rights groups
and to exploit the racial situation."
