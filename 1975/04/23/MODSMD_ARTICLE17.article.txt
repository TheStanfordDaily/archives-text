# Monatarist Vs. Marxist
## Profs Probe Economy 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
"I don't think that the current [economic]
situation will turn out to be on the order of the
great depression," predicted Asst. Economics Prof.
John Scadding.
Addressing a large crowd in Tresidder Large
Lounge Thursday night, Scadding presented a
monetarist's or traditional perspective of the
current economic situation. He shared the podium
with Economics Prof. Doug Dowd of San Jose
State who presented a Marxist's view.
Scadding provided the audience with a handout
of graphs illustrating the relationship between the
spending rate and rate of change in prices with the
rate of change in the money supply. He based his
interpretation of the present situation on the graph
patterns.
"By the end of the year there will be a zero
growth in output," Scadding predicted. "The rate
of price increase will be seven percent, dropping to
between five and six percent per annum in 1976."
Scadding emphasized the role of the Federal
Reserve Board, "the Fed," in the present crisis. "In
1971, we had a golden opportunity," said
Scadding. "The imposed price control set the stage
for the Fed to behave in a correct manner but they
let the growth rate of the money supply expand
too rapidly in 1972, bringing inflation in the long
run.
'Responsible'
"The point is that what the Fed did in '72 is
responsible for the price increase now," stressed
Scadding. "In '7s-'74 they let the money supply
grow too slowly, bringing a contraction in
output. . . they've a choice to make now. If they
lose their nerve and step on the brake, the money
supply will decline and we will have a serious
problem."
In his discussion of the crisis, Dowd ignored the
Federal Reserve Board.
He opened with two seemingly gloomy facts:
that U.S. inflation at the consumer price level is 12
percent, three times the 1972 rate, and that in
1974 almost all member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development had double digit inflation.
"To have inflation as pervasive as it is now, side
by side with serious, widespread unemployment, is a
first in the capitalist world," he said.
He then asked, "Why, when we are in a

Keynesian world and profess to understand the
capitalist economy better than at any time in
history, do we have the worst economic situation
ever historically?" His answer? "There is something
wrong with the economy and with the
economists . . .
According to Dowd, "the popular explanation is
oil." He pointed out, however, that current
economic problems "pre-date the oil blockade and
the production crisis.
"Oil exacerbated but did not initiate the
situation," he said.
Dowd blamed the current situation on
monopolies which have "distorted the structure
and function of the economy, making for an
enormous accumulation of debt. . . even the banks
have become debtors as well as major creditors."
Trends
Suggesting trends for the next decade, Dowd
said that there will be a "centralization of
decision-making and an emphasis on economic
nationalism in the capitalist countries." As a result
of this trend, the U.S. will lose its markets and
resources abroad and will probably assert
"hegemony" over the other countries in this
hemisphere, he said.
"The U.S. will pursue a continental policy
whereby the resources of Canada, for instance, will
be claimed as continental resources," said Dowd.
"In the case of South America, such a policy could
lead to international warfare ... I don't believe it
will, but I am not confident it won't.
"Over the next several months, experts will be
saying prosperity is just around the corner. .. but
we don't know where we are until we've left where
we were," Dowd said, concluding that in judging
present and future trends, economists must take
into account "not just economic affairs but the
politics and sociology of the society as well."
During the question and answer period that
followed, Dowd argued that Scadding's analysis was
"quantitative" and "depended on implicit
statements." Dowd emphasized the self-interest of
large corporations, noting that in a buoyant
economy, self-interest and the process of change
cancel each other out but "when the economy isn't
buoyant the two exacerbate one another."
The symposium was the first in a series
sponsored by SWOPSI and the Tresidder Program
Board.

grow too slowly, bringing a contraction in
output. . . they've a choice to make now. If they
lose their nerve and step on the brake, the money
supply will decline and we will have a serious
problem."
In his discussion of the crisis, Dowd ignored the
Federal Reserve Board.
He opened with two seemingly gloomy facts:
that U.S. inflation at the consumer price level is 12
percent, three times the 1972 rate, and that in
1974 almost all member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development had double digit inflation.
"To have inflation as pervasive as it is now, side
by side with serious, widespread unemployment, is a
first in the capitalist world," he said.
He then asked, "Why, when we are in a

Keynesian world and profess to understand the
capitalist economy better than at any time in
history, do we have the worst economic situation
ever historically?" His answer? "There is something
wrong with the economy and with the
economists . . .
According to Dowd, "the popular explanation is
oil." He pointed out, however, that current
economic problems "pre-date the oil blockade and
the production crisis.
"Oil exacerbated but did not initiate the
situation," he said.
Dowd blamed the current situation on
monopolies which have "distorted the structure
and function of the economy, making for an
enormous accumulation of debt. . . even the banks
have become debtors as well as major creditors."
Trends
Suggesting trends for the next decade, Dowd
said that there will be a "centralization of
decision-making and an emphasis on economic
nationalism in the capitalist countries." As a result
of this trend, the U.S. will lose its markets and
resources abroad and will probably assert
"hegemony" over the other countries in this
hemisphere, he said.
"The U.S. will pursue a continental policy
whereby the resources of Canada, for instance, will
be claimed as continental resources," said Dowd.
"In the case of South America, such a policy could
lead to international warfare ... I don't believe it
will, but I am not confident it won't.
"Over the next several months, experts will be
saying prosperity is just around the corner. .. but
we don't know where we are until we've left where
we were," Dowd said, concluding that in judging
present and future trends, economists must take
into account "not just economic affairs but the
politics and sociology of the society as well."
During the question and answer period that
followed, Dowd argued that Scadding's analysis was
"quantitative" and "depended on implicit
statements." Dowd emphasized the self-interest of
large corporations, noting that in a buoyant
economy, self-interest and the process of change
cancel each other out but "when the economy isn't
buoyant the two exacerbate one another."
The symposium was the first in a series
sponsored by SWOPSI and the Tresidder Program
Board.
"I don't think that the current [economic]
situation will turn out to be on the order of the
great depression," predicted Asst. Economics Prof.
John Scadding.
Addressing a large crowd in Tresidder Large
Lounge Thursday night, Scadding presented a
monetarist's or traditional perspective of the
current economic situation. He shared the podium
with Economics Prof. Doug Dowd of San Jose
State who presented a Marxist's view.
Scadding provided the audience with a handout
of graphs illustrating the relationship between the
spending rate and rate of change in prices with the
rate of change in the money supply. He based his
interpretation of the present situation on the graph
patterns.
"By the end of the year there will be a zero
growth in output," Scadding predicted. "The rate
of price increase will be seven percent, dropping to
between five and six percent per annum in 1976."
Scadding emphasized the role of the Federal
Reserve Board, "the Fed," in the present crisis. "In
1971, we had a golden opportunity," said
Scadding. "The imposed price control set the stage
for the Fed to behave in a correct manner but they
let the growth rate of the money supply expand
too rapidly in 1972, bringing inflation in the long
run.
'Responsible'
"The point is that what the Fed did in '72 is
responsible for the price increase now," stressed
Scadding. "In '7s-'74 they let the money supply
grow too slowly, bringing a contraction in
output. . . they've a choice to make now. If they
lose their nerve and step on the brake, the money
supply will decline and we will have a serious
problem."
