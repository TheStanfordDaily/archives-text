## Hit-Happy Cards Whip San Jose 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Sophomore Bruce Davis,
starting his first varsity game, gave
Stanford's injury-depleted
pitching staff a needed lift
yesterday, leading the Cardinals
to a 6-1 victory over the San Jose
State Spartans in San Jose.
Davis, who has pitched at the
junior varsity level most of the
year, went the full nine innings,
and had a one-hitter going into
the sixth when San Jose State
scored its single run. Davis
managed to give up six hits in the
last three innings without being
scored upon.
"He was a last minute starter
and did an excellent job," said
coach Ray Young. "He probably
earned himself a starting spot
against USC this weekend."
The win gave Stanford a 28-17

season record and reduced the
Spartans to 17-15 for the year.
The Cards lost three in a row to
San Jose State earlier in the
season.
Davis' nine-inning,
eight-strikeout performance
couldn't have come at a better
time. Pitchers Ken Grolle, Bernie
Hittner, and Mike Williamson are
all injured and unable to pitch.
Jerry Argust threw against Cal last
weekend but is suffering from a
tender arm, reducing the staff to
two starters — A 1 Arthur and John
Yandle.
Stanford played its usual
scrappy game yesterday,
collecting 12 hits, 10 of them
singles, stealing three bases, and
even squeezing in a run on a bunt.
The Cards pecked away at San
Jose State's Steve Friar for four

innings and got rid of him for
good after a five-run fifth.
With one out in that inning,
Pepe Hinojosa walked and
advanced to third on a single by
second baseman Joe Lamoure.
Lamoure stole second, the
Cards' 104 th stolen base of the
season for a new team record, and
went to third on Dave Baker's
single to right. Hinojosa scored.
Designated hitter Gary
Pitchford then bunted safely to
Spartan first baseman Dave lus, to
move Baker to second and bring
Lamoure across with Stanford's
second run. Bob Hampton's
two-out single and a subsequent
error by Spartan left-fielder Dan
Praeger scored both Baker and
Pitchford, hiking the Cards' lead
to 4-0.
Steve Davis made it 5-0 with a

run-scoring single to right before
Tom Guardino grounded out to
end the inning. Baker's first home
run of the year in the seventh
inning completed Stanford's
scoring.
San Jose State's only run came
in the sixth inning when Gary
Bayer tripled and designated
hitter Jay Peryam singled him
home.
Steve Davis went 3 for 4 and might
have had a perfect day were it not
for a bizarre play in the seventh
inning. With Hampton on first,
Bruce Robinson on third, and
Davis at the plate, Stanford had
Hampton take off for second on a
hit-and-run play. The pitch to
Davis was over his head, and the
Spartan catcher, not expecting
Davis to swing, stepped up to
catch the throw. But Davis swung
to protect the runner,
inadvertently hit the catcher, and
was called out for interference.
Stanford plays San Francisco
State today at 2:30 in the City.
Young expects to use Yandle for
the first few innings and have Ed
Matta go the rest of the way.

WORLD RECORD HOLDER—Alphonse Juilland, chairman of the French & Italian Department, isn't
your average everyday jogger. Juilland holds five world track and field records in the 50 and over age
group. He has run the 100 yard dash in 10.5 seconds, the 100 meter dash in 11.4, the 220 in 23.7, 200
meters in 23.6 and the quarter-mile in 56.3. He made his competitive comeback a couple of years ago at
the West Coast Relays, when a few members of the Stanford track squad took him out of the stands and
entered him in the century. He is seen here in a recent workout at Angell Field.

WORLD RECORD HOLDER—Alphonse Juilland, chairman of the French & Italian Department, isn't
your average everyday jogger. Juilland holds five world track and field records in the 50 and over age
group. He has run the 100 yard dash in 10.5 seconds, the 100 meter dash in 11.4, the 220 in 23.7, 200
meters in 23.6 and the quarter-mile in 56.3. He made his competitive comeback a couple of years ago at
the West Coast Relays, when a few members of the Stanford track squad took him out of the stands and
entered him in the century. He is seen here in a recent workout at Angell Field.
Sophomore Bruce Davis,
starting his first varsity game, gave
Stanford's injury-depleted
pitching staff a needed lift
yesterday, leading the Cardinals
to a 6-1 victory over the San Jose
State Spartans in San Jose.
Davis, who has pitched at the
junior varsity level most of the
year, went the full nine innings,
and had a one-hitter going into
the sixth when San Jose State
scored its single run. Davis
managed to give up six hits in the
last three innings without being
scored upon.
"He was a last minute starter
and did an excellent job," said
coach Ray Young. "He probably
earned himself a starting spot
against USC this weekend."
The win gave Stanford a 28-17

season record and reduced the
Spartans to 17-15 for the year.
The Cards lost three in a row to
San Jose State earlier in the
season.
Davis' nine-inning,
eight-strikeout performance
couldn't have come at a better
time. Pitchers Ken Grolle, Bernie
Hittner, and Mike Williamson are
all injured and unable to pitch.
Jerry Argust threw against Cal last
weekend but is suffering from a
tender arm, reducing the staff to
two starters — A 1 Arthur and John
Yandle.
Stanford played its usual
scrappy game yesterday,
collecting 12 hits, 10 of them
singles, stealing three bases, and
even squeezing in a run on a bunt.
The Cards pecked away at San
Jose State's Steve Friar for four

innings and got rid of him for
good after a five-run fifth.
With one out in that inning,
Pepe Hinojosa walked and
advanced to third on a single by
second baseman Joe Lamoure.
Lamoure stole second, the
Cards' 104 th stolen base of the
season for a new team record, and
went to third on Dave Baker's
single to right. Hinojosa scored.
Designated hitter Gary
Pitchford then bunted safely to
Spartan first baseman Dave lus, to
move Baker to second and bring
Lamoure across with Stanford's
second run. Bob Hampton's
two-out single and a subsequent
error by Spartan left-fielder Dan
Praeger scored both Baker and
Pitchford, hiking the Cards' lead
to 4-0.
Steve Davis made it 5-0 with a

run-scoring single to right before
Tom Guardino grounded out to
end the inning. Baker's first home
run of the year in the seventh
inning completed Stanford's
scoring.
San Jose State's only run came
in the sixth inning when Gary
Bayer tripled and designated
hitter Jay Peryam singled him
home.
Steve Davis went 3 for 4 and might
have had a perfect day were it not
for a bizarre play in the seventh
inning. With Hampton on first,
Bruce Robinson on third, and
Davis at the plate, Stanford had
Hampton take off for second on a
hit-and-run play. The pitch to
Davis was over his head, and the
Spartan catcher, not expecting
Davis to swing, stepped up to
catch the throw. But Davis swung
to protect the runner,
inadvertently hit the catcher, and
was called out for interference.
Stanford plays San Francisco
State today at 2:30 in the City.
Young expects to use Yandle for
the first few innings and have Ed
Matta go the rest of the way.

second run. Bob Hampton's
two-out single and a subsequent
error by Spartan left-fielder Dan
Praeger scored both Baker and
Pitchford, hiking the Cards' lead
to 4-0.
Steve Davis made it 5-0 with a

run-scoring single to right before
Tom Guardino grounded out to
end the inning. Baker's first home
run of the year in the seventh
inning completed Stanford's
scoring.
San Jose State's only run came
in the sixth inning when Gary
Bayer tripled and designated
hitter Jay Peryam singled him
home.
Steve Davis went 3 for 4 and might
have had a perfect day were it not
for a bizarre play in the seventh
inning. With Hampton on first,
Bruce Robinson on third, and
Davis at the plate, Stanford had
Hampton take off for second on a
hit-and-run play. The pitch to
Davis was over his head, and the
Spartan catcher, not expecting
Davis to swing, stepped up to
catch the throw. But Davis swung
to protect the runner,
inadvertently hit the catcher, and
was called out for interference.
Stanford plays San Francisco
State today at 2:30 in the City.
Young expects to use Yandle for
the first few innings and have Ed
Matta go the rest of the way.

WORLD RECORD HOLDER—Alphonse Juilland, chairman of the French & Italian Department, isn't
your average everyday jogger. Juilland holds five world track and field records in the 50 and over age
group. He has run the 100 yard dash in 10.5 seconds, the 100 meter dash in 11.4, the 220 in 23.7, 200
meters in 23.6 and the quarter-mile in 56.3. He made his competitive comeback a couple of years ago at
the West Coast Relays, when a few members of the Stanford track squad took him out of the stands and
entered him in the century. He is seen here in a recent workout at Angell Field.
