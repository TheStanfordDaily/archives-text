# Demoted Laxmen Will Be Back
## Stanford Lacrosse Isn't Dead 
### PETE BHATIA 
Many sports exist in the
background at Stanford, behind
the limelight of football,
basketball and tennis (if you
consider these three worthy of
limelight). And many of those
background sports receive a good
deal of press coverage now and
again, sports ranging from baseball
to a varsity club sport like crew.
But about some you hear
almost nothing. One of these is
lacrosse.
Lacrosse has been an
established team sport on the
Farm for many years. The squad
plays an "academic-year-round"
schedule which generally takes
them around the Bay Area and
down to Los Angeles. Still, this
predominantly Eastern game,
which is probably the oldest
American sport (dating to the
Indians at the time of the first
French explorations), is little
known to the west coast audience.
Last week's decision by the
Athletic Department to cut back
the club sport program, possibly
forcing the folding of many club
teams, may further the anonymity
of lacrosse at Stanford. But it will
not end the program. "We'll be
here next year," Stanford senior
and team co-captain Tom
Earthman said, although the team
"won't have any chance to
expand" as they had hoped.
Currently the team competes
in the Northern California
Lacrosse Association (NCLA)
with Cal, the San Francisco
Lacrosse Club, Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club, U.C. Davis, Monterey
Lacrosse Club and University of
the Ffccific. The team also traveled to
Los Angeles this year for a
tourney that included Cal,
Arizona State, USC and UCLA.

This week it ventures north to
Oregon for battles with the Ducks
and Washington.
However, Earth man says, such
trips appear doubtful in the future
under the new Athletic
Department policy. The trips were
designed, he said, to set up a
Pacific-8 lacrosse league and
hopefully to build lacrosse to a
varsity level over the next five
years. Earthman doesn't
understand why some sports were
awarded varsity club status over
lacrosse, but he attributed it to
the fact lacrosse "didn't feel the
need to play politics."
He points out that lacrosse did
receive $2000 this year from the
Athletic Department to finance a
JV level team. This, plus the $25
dues each team member pays,
makes up the team's income for
this year.
Despite this unpleasant turn of
events for lacrosse, its season
continues and the team's ability is
considerable, even though its
record currently stands at 3-5.
Lacrosse is similar to hockey or
soccer except in the manner in
which the ball is moved. Players
carry the ball in a crosse (or stick)
and may move the ball, made
of hard rubber, in any direction
by any means.
There are 10 men on the 110
by 60-yard field at any time; three
attackmen, three midfielders,
three defense men and a goalie.
Sports Illustrated has called
lacrosse "the most dangerous
game" and that's understandable
when the ball flies around at
speeds approaching 100 miles per
hour.
Stanford has a young team this
year with only two seniors,
Earthman and Peter Fox, among
the 20 players on the first division

(varsity) squad. Earthman is a
defenseman and Fox, a co-captain
and the team leader, is the team's
top midfielder.
The two other co-captains are
sophomores Greg Hoberg and Jon
Sprole. Hoberg, the team's top
attackman, is a strong scoring
threat. Whit Budge, a junior, who
splits duty between attackman
and defense, is another top
Stanford player.
Since it is a club team,
graduate students can play on the
team and one does — goalie Fred
Choate, a Ph.D. candidate in
Slavic Literature. As Earthman
put it "He's been around for a
number of years."
The Cards have two volunteer
coaches. One, Sam Sadtler, played
at the nation's top lacrosse school,
Maryland, as an undergraduate in
the 50s and the other, Jack
Mayer, was a 1969 All-American
at West Point.
The spring schedule points to
post-season play and the annual
North-South (California) All-Star
game. The Southern Group
includes Claremont College,
UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara and
USC. The North has won that
game the last five years.


. . . THE AGONY OF DEFEAT — Stanford tennis ace Nick Saviano lies prone on the court after leaping for a return in Friday's match with
UCLA. The defending national champs went down in agony over the weekend, but they're not going to take things lying down. The Cards play
in the Ojai Intercollegiate beginning Tnursday.

top midfielder.
The two other co-captains are
sophomores Greg Hoberg and Jon
Sprole. Hoberg, the team's top
attackman, is a strong scoring
threat. Whit Budge, a junior, who
splits duty between attackman
and defense, is another top
Stanford player.
Since it is a club team,
graduate students can play on the
team and one does — goalie Fred
Choate, a Ph.D. candidate in
Slavic Literature. As Earthman
put it "He's been around for a
number of years."
The Cards have two volunteer
coaches. One, Sam Sadtler, played
at the nation's top lacrosse school,
Maryland, as an undergraduate in
the 50s and the other, Jack
Mayer, was a 1969 All-American
at West Point.
The spring schedule points to
post-season play and the annual
North-South (California) All-Star
game. The Southern Group
includes Claremont College,
UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara and
USC. The North has won that
game the last five years.


. . . THE AGONY OF DEFEAT — Stanford tennis ace Nick Saviano lies prone on the court after leaping for a return in Friday's match with
UCLA. The defending national champs went down in agony over the weekend, but they're not going to take things lying down. The Cards play
in the Ojai Intercollegiate beginning Tnursday.
Many sports exist in the
background at Stanford, behind
the limelight of football,
basketball and tennis (if you
consider these three worthy of
limelight). And many of those
background sports receive a good
deal of press coverage now and
again, sports ranging from baseball
to a varsity club sport like crew.
But about some you hear
almost nothing. One of these is
lacrosse.
Lacrosse has been an
established team sport on the
Farm for many years. The squad
plays an "academic-year-round"
schedule which generally takes
them around the Bay Area and
down to Los Angeles. Still, this
predominantly Eastern game,
which is probably the oldest
American sport (dating to the
Indians at the time of the first
French explorations), is little
known to the west coast audience.
Last week's decision by the
Athletic Department to cut back
the club sport program, possibly
forcing the folding of many club
teams, may further the anonymity
of lacrosse at Stanford. But it will
not end the program. "We'll be
here next year," Stanford senior
and team co-captain Tom
Earthman said, although the team
"won't have any chance to
expand" as they had hoped.
Currently the team competes
in the Northern California
Lacrosse Association (NCLA)
with Cal, the San Francisco
Lacrosse Club, Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club, U.C. Davis, Monterey
Lacrosse Club and University of
the Ffccific. The team also traveled to
Los Angeles this year for a
tourney that included Cal,
Arizona State, USC and UCLA.

This week it ventures north to
Oregon for battles with the Ducks
and Washington.
However, Earth man says, such
trips appear doubtful in the future
under the new Athletic
Department policy. The trips were
designed, he said, to set up a
Pacific-8 lacrosse league and
hopefully to build lacrosse to a
varsity level over the next five
years. Earthman doesn't
understand why some sports were
awarded varsity club status over
lacrosse, but he attributed it to
the fact lacrosse "didn't feel the
need to play politics."
He points out that lacrosse did
receive $2000 this year from the
Athletic Department to finance a
JV level team. This, plus the $25
dues each team member pays,
makes up the team's income for
this year.
Despite this unpleasant turn of
events for lacrosse, its season
continues and the team's ability is
considerable, even though its
record currently stands at 3-5.
Lacrosse is similar to hockey or
soccer except in the manner in
which the ball is moved. Players
carry the ball in a crosse (or stick)
and may move the ball, made
of hard rubber, in any direction
by any means.
There are 10 men on the 110
by 60-yard field at any time; three
attackmen, three midfielders,
three defense men and a goalie.
Sports Illustrated has called
lacrosse "the most dangerous
game" and that's understandable
when the ball flies around at
speeds approaching 100 miles per
hour.
Stanford has a young team this
year with only two seniors,
Earthman and Peter Fox, among
the 20 players on the first division

(varsity) squad. Earthman is a
defenseman and Fox, a co-captain
and the team leader, is the team's
top midfielder.

the fact lacrosse "didn't feel the
need to play politics."
He points out that lacrosse did
receive $2000 this year from the
Athletic Department to finance a
JV level team. This, plus the $25
dues each team member pays,
makes up the team's income for
this year.
Despite this unpleasant turn of
events for lacrosse, its season
continues and the team's ability is
considerable, even though its
record currently stands at 3-5.
Lacrosse is similar to hockey or
soccer except in the manner in
which the ball is moved. Players
carry the ball in a crosse (or stick)
and may move the ball, made
of hard rubber, in any direction
by any means.
There are 10 men on the 110
by 60-yard field at any time; three
attackmen, three midfielders,
three defense men and a goalie.
Sports Illustrated has called
lacrosse "the most dangerous
game" and that's understandable
when the ball flies around at
speeds approaching 100 miles per
hour.
Stanford has a young team this
year with only two seniors,
Earthman and Peter Fox, among
the 20 players on the first division

(varsity) squad. Earthman is a
defenseman and Fox, a co-captain
and the team leader, is the team's
top midfielder.
The two other co-captains are
sophomores Greg Hoberg and Jon
Sprole. Hoberg, the team's top
attackman, is a strong scoring
threat. Whit Budge, a junior, who
splits duty between attackman
and defense, is another top
Stanford player.
Since it is a club team,
graduate students can play on the
team and one does — goalie Fred
Choate, a Ph.D. candidate in
Slavic Literature. As Earthman
put it "He's been around for a
number of years."
The Cards have two volunteer
coaches. One, Sam Sadtler, played
at the nation's top lacrosse school,
Maryland, as an undergraduate in
the 50s and the other, Jack
Mayer, was a 1969 All-American
at West Point.
The spring schedule points to
post-season play and the annual
North-South (California) All-Star
game. The Southern Group
includes Claremont College,
UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara and
USC. The North has won that
game the last five years.


. . . THE AGONY OF DEFEAT — Stanford tennis ace Nick Saviano lies prone on the court after leaping for a return in Friday's match with
UCLA. The defending national champs went down in agony over the weekend, but they're not going to take things lying down. The Cards play
in the Ojai Intercollegiate beginning Tnursday.
