# Ruetz Defends Club Sports Consolidation
## 
### PRIMO SANTINI 
Joe Ruetz, director of the
Department of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation, defended
his creation of the category of varsity
club sports and the unilateral nature of
his recent budget decisions on KZSU's
Campus Conference last night.
Ruetz's recent decisions to
eliminate department funding of the
club sports program and the
reclassification of soccer, previously a
varsity sport, as a varsity club sport,
have aroused controversy. Both
decisions are a by-product of the
merger of the men's and women's
athletic departments, a move whose
budgetary and structural effects are
still unclear.
The fundamental problem, said
Ruetz, is that football and basketball —
the only income-producing sports —
must now support all of the women's
programs as well as the men's
programs. University support of the
Athletic Department will be decreased
by $120,000 during the next three
years, and Ruetz said he feels the
maintenance of strong football and
basketball programs in conjunction
with prudent budgeting procedures is
the way to keep Stanford's varied
athletic programs from becoming
extinct.
The budget crunch, said Ruetz,

forced him to create the category of
varsity club sports and eliminate
department funding of club sports.
Varsity club sports, he said, "is a
convenient classification term to
indicate that certain sports [soccer,
rugby, crew, sailing and men's and
women's volleyball] are going to be
held at very minimal funding until we
find out how the budget is going to
work after one year of the merger."
Ruetz said he created varsity club
sports, while emphasizing that they are
varsity sports, eligible to compete for
regional and national championships
"so that I could subsume under some
football income, limited though it may
be, a series of sports we might
otherwise have had to drop."
The lack of funding for club sports,
said Ruetz, will not destroy the
shrunken program that remains.
"If there is student interest in a
program, they [the students] are going
to be able to sustain it without
department funding."
Time Considerations
Ruetz cited time considerations and
the desire to get moving as reasons for
his apparent lack of diligence in
seeking the opinions of those who were
directly affected by his budgetary
decisions.
Ruetz said that his proposals had
been submitted to and reviewed by
CAPER (Committee on Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation),
the University's formal means of
injecting community input into the
decision making process of the athletic
department.
"I had a lot of input," said Ruetz,
"but the problem here was not so
much a matter of input. Even further
input from them [the Club Sports
Council] will not help you when you
have to make a budget decision.
"If I had to meet with everybody
every time I made a decision, we
probably would never have merged the
department for 10 years. Sometimes
you have to make the decision under
the pressure of time and everything
else," said Ruetz.
While saying that in the future he
will be more responsive to those the
decisions will affect, Ruetz said he
plans to continue his strict budget
policies.
"One of the reasons it J the Athletic
Department] is one of the viable
departments in the country right now
is because there have been tough
budgeting procedures. We haven't let
any coach or anybody ever get away
with the opinion that somehow this is
a money tree out here that you can
pluck at will," said Ruetz.

Campus Conference last night.
Ruetz's recent decisions to
eliminate department funding of the
club sports program and the
reclassification of soccer, previously a
varsity sport, as a varsity club sport,
have aroused controversy. Both
decisions are a by-product of the
merger of the men's and women's
athletic departments, a move whose
budgetary and structural effects are
still unclear.
The fundamental problem, said
Ruetz, is that football and basketball —
the only income-producing sports —
must now support all of the women's
programs as well as the men's
programs. University support of the
Athletic Department will be decreased
by $120,000 during the next three
years, and Ruetz said he feels the
maintenance of strong football and
basketball programs in conjunction
with prudent budgeting procedures is
the way to keep Stanford's varied
athletic programs from becoming
extinct.
The budget crunch, said Ruetz,

forced him to create the category of
varsity club sports and eliminate
department funding of club sports.
Varsity club sports, he said, "is a
convenient classification term to
indicate that certain sports [soccer,
rugby, crew, sailing and men's and
women's volleyball] are going to be
held at very minimal funding until we
find out how the budget is going to
work after one year of the merger."
Ruetz said he created varsity club
sports, while emphasizing that they are
varsity sports, eligible to compete for
regional and national championships
"so that I could subsume under some
football income, limited though it may
be, a series of sports we might
otherwise have had to drop."
The lack of funding for club sports,
said Ruetz, will not destroy the
shrunken program that remains.
"If there is student interest in a
program, they [the students] are going
to be able to sustain it without
department funding."
Time Considerations
Ruetz cited time considerations and
the desire to get moving as reasons for
his apparent lack of diligence in
seeking the opinions of those who were
directly affected by his budgetary
decisions.
Ruetz said that his proposals had
been submitted to and reviewed by
CAPER (Committee on Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation),
the University's formal means of
injecting community input into the
decision making process of the athletic
department.
"I had a lot of input," said Ruetz,
"but the problem here was not so
much a matter of input. Even further
input from them [the Club Sports
Council] will not help you when you
have to make a budget decision.
"If I had to meet with everybody
every time I made a decision, we
probably would never have merged the
department for 10 years. Sometimes
you have to make the decision under
the pressure of time and everything
else," said Ruetz.
While saying that in the future he
will be more responsive to those the
decisions will affect, Ruetz said he
plans to continue his strict budget
policies.
"One of the reasons it J the Athletic
Department] is one of the viable
departments in the country right now
is because there have been tough
budgeting procedures. We haven't let
any coach or anybody ever get away
with the opinion that somehow this is
a money tree out here that you can
pluck at will," said Ruetz.
