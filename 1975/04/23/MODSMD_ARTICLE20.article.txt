Jimmy Connors is a cretin.
I spent a long (well, at least 30
seconds) time searching for that
sentence. I considered "ass,"
which was used in reference to
pitcher Mike Marshall some time
ago (before I started writing this
column), but any term used to
describe Mike Marshall is too good
for Jimmy Connors and the word
just isn't my style.
Cretin is more appropriate, you
see, because it is followed in the
dictionary by an accurate
description of James Connors:
First there's "one afflicted by
cretinism." Then comes,
. . loosely, a person showing
marked mental deficiency," and
the definition ends, "hence a
plant or animal monstrosity."
Frightening, isn't it? The
accuracy of that final, short
phrase is uncanny.
Naturally I don't have a leg to
stand on in this matter. Or at least

most people won't think so. After
all, little Jimmy is the world's
number one tennis player, and he
has beaten the likes of Rod Laver
and Ken Rosewall and Arthur
Ashe and Stan Smith.
And, to be perfectly accurate, I
must further concede that his
recent behavior has been at least
at the level of a mature
nine-year-old. But that's all. And
don't let him fool you.
Remember the "New Nixon?"
This is the "New Jimmy."
It's difficult, after all, for an
athlete with a track record like his
to change right away. Or ever.
He's the guy who
mimeographed a friend's paper for
a class in college, and didn't
bother to remove his friend's
name. And he's the one who
bounces the ball eight jillion times
before serving. And he's the one
who makes unpleasant remarks on
and off the court, and who didn't
bother to play for the United
States Davis Cup team or Aetna
Cup team and so on and so forth
(I won't bother to belabor what
kind of personality one would
need to get along with Chris
Evert).
Jimmy Connors is an American
nightmare. James Thurber once
wrote a story that told what
would happen if a Lindbergh-like
hero turned out to be a bum.
Thurber was ahead of his time.
Jimmy Connors spits on tennis
traditions and becomes the hero
of every hack who found himself
(or herself) unable to control his

temper on the court. There is no
class in the way he plays, winning
or losing.
He's an extension of Pancho
Gonzales and successful Ilie
Nastase. He's turned professional
tennis into a circus, and has a
normally polite John Newcombe
saying things like, "Tell Chrissy
Evert I'm going to beat her man
and after that I'm going to teach
him to dance, as a favor to her."
Mild Stan Smith has said Connors
is not the kind of person you'd
want to have lunch with.
He's also not someone you
would readily invite to a
tournament. He pulls out at the
last minute with all kinds of

feeble excuses. The recent WCT
tournament in Denver required
that he post bond, fearing he
would drop out at the last minute
(no such luck — he showed up and
won).
James Connors is an excellent
tennis player. His attitude doesn't
reflect it. Maybe he doesn't
believe it's true. Or maybe
Connors is just the result of a bad
case of indigestion. Maybe this
Saturday Newcombe will settle a
few disturbed stomachs. Like
mine.
I leave it to you to decide
whether he's an animal or plant
monstrosity.

(or herself) unable to control his

temper on the court. There is no
class in the way he plays, winning
or losing.
He's an extension of Pancho
Gonzales and successful Ilie
Nastase. He's turned professional
tennis into a circus, and has a
normally polite John Newcombe
saying things like, "Tell Chrissy
Evert I'm going to beat her man
and after that I'm going to teach
him to dance, as a favor to her."
Mild Stan Smith has said Connors
is not the kind of person you'd
want to have lunch with.
He's also not someone you
would readily invite to a
tournament. He pulls out at the
last minute with all kinds of

feeble excuses. The recent WCT
tournament in Denver required
that he post bond, fearing he
would drop out at the last minute
(no such luck — he showed up and
won).
James Connors is an excellent
tennis player. His attitude doesn't
reflect it. Maybe he doesn't
believe it's true. Or maybe
Connors is just the result of a bad
case of indigestion. Maybe this
Saturday Newcombe will settle a
few disturbed stomachs. Like
mine.
I leave it to you to decide
whether he's an animal or plant
monstrosity.

Jimmy Connors is a cretin.
I spent a long (well, at least 30
seconds) time searching for that
sentence. I considered "ass,"
which was used in reference to
pitcher Mike Marshall some time
ago (before I started writing this
column), but any term used to
describe Mike Marshall is too good
for Jimmy Connors and the word
just isn't my style.
Cretin is more appropriate, you
see, because it is followed in the
dictionary by an accurate
description of James Connors:
First there's "one afflicted by
cretinism." Then comes,
. . loosely, a person showing
marked mental deficiency," and
the definition ends, "hence a
plant or animal monstrosity."
Frightening, isn't it? The
accuracy of that final, short
phrase is uncanny.
Naturally I don't have a leg to
stand on in this matter. Or at least

most people won't think so. After
all, little Jimmy is the world's
number one tennis player, and he
has beaten the likes of Rod Laver
and Ken Rosewall and Arthur
Ashe and Stan Smith.
And, to be perfectly accurate, I
must further concede that his
recent behavior has been at least
at the level of a mature
nine-year-old. But that's all. And
don't let him fool you.
Remember the "New Nixon?"
This is the "New Jimmy."
It's difficult, after all, for an
athlete with a track record like his
to change right away. Or ever.
He's the guy who
mimeographed a friend's paper for
a class in college, and didn't
bother to remove his friend's
name. And he's the one who
bounces the ball eight jillion times
before serving. And he's the one
who makes unpleasant remarks on
and off the court, and who didn't
bother to play for the United
States Davis Cup team or Aetna
Cup team and so on and so forth
(I won't bother to belabor what
kind of personality one would
need to get along with Chris
Evert).
Jimmy Connors is an American
nightmare. James Thurber once
wrote a story that told what
would happen if a Lindbergh-like
hero turned out to be a bum.
Thurber was ahead of his time.
Jimmy Connors spits on tennis
traditions and becomes the hero
of every hack who found himself
(or herself) unable to control his

temper on the court. There is no
