# Women's Volleyball Exhibition Tonight
## 
### KATHY WELTON 
Stanford's women's volleyball
team takes on a squad composed
of players from top-rated San Jose
State in an exhibition match
tonight. The Spartan spikers are
the present champions of the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference, the conference the
Cards hope to compete in next
year under their recently
acquired "club-varsity" status.
Stanford's team is considered
one of the best volleyball teams in
Northern California. For the
second consecutive year, the

spikers have qualified for the
USVBA Nationals â€” to be held
May 14-17 in Reno, Nevada. Last
year the team traveled to
Knoxville, Tennessee, financing
the trip with a similar exhibition.
The proceeds from tonight's
performance will be used to send
them to this year's tourney.
The team has been working out
twice weekly since October, under
the volunteer coaching of Bruce
Downing. Downing provides
first-hand experience and
leadership to the squad since he is
a volleyball player on the San
Francisco Olympic Club,
considered to be one of the top
five teams in the country.
Stanford team members
include: Laura Coverson, Nancy
Daum, Ann Dunlavey, Barbara
Finn, Sharon Grigsby, Shawn
Hoover, Marty Johnson, Rita
Lewis, Mele Meyer, Suzanne
Murphy and Mauri Okamoto.
Last Saturday, the team placed
sixth in the Far Western
Championships. This Sunday, the
team hosts another tournament,
beginning at 9 a.m. in Maples
Pavilion. And on May 3, the team
travels to Long Beach State to
play in the National Warm-up
Open Tournament.
Tonight's exhibition will
feature a best-of-five series, and
will begin at 7:30 p.m. in Maples.
Tickets may be purchased for $1
in advance, or $1.50 at the door.
Tickets stubs may be used for a
$1 discount at Straw Hat Pizza.
