# Card Crew Shines
## 
### 
In their most impressive display of the season, the Stanford
oarsmen swept all three races against St. Mary's and Loyola
Sunday at Los Gatos.
The Card frosh opened the meet by coming from behind in
the final 1000 meters to chalk up a convincing 12 second
victory over Loyola — with St. Mary's far behind.
The jayvees followed the frosh performance by also putting
on a strong sprint in the final 1000 meters to pull by a tough
Loyola junior varsity and win by an eight second margin. It was
the third victory in a row for the undefeated jayvees and
marks their best start in recent years.
In the varsity event, the Card crewmen were faced with
what appeared to be a tough Loyola eight which had narrowly
lost to perennial West Coast power UCLA only a week before.
The expected tight race didn't materialize as Stanford took the
lead right off the start and pulled steadily away to a three
boat-length dunking of the Loyola varsity.
The victory marked the first for Stanford's varsity
following two weeks of frustrating split second losses to USC
and Oregon State.
