Vietnamese Cease-Fire Rejected
SAIGON — The South Vietnamese government
today proposed an immediate cease-fire and
negotiations for a political settlement to end the
Vietnam war, but the Viet Cong rejected the
proposal.
It was the first overture to the Communists by
the Saigon government since the resignation of
President Nguyen Van Thieu Monday night and his
replacement by his 71-year-old vice president, Tran
Van Huong.
"The proposal fools no one and will hardly help
the Americans out of their defeat," said a statement
issued by the Viet Cong delegation in Saigon.
The proposal differed in no way from similar
proposals made by Thieu. The Communists rejected
all of those, saying they would only deal with an
entirely new government in Saigon.
The Saigon command announced earlier this
morning that North Vietnamese tanks and assault
troops had overrun Ham Tan, 75 miles east of
Saigon and the capital of Binh Tuy Province.
A command spokesman said the final battle for
Ham Tan began with a heavy North Vietnamese
attack on the city and its nearby airfield at 8 p.m.
yesterday. He added tht fighting raged for three
hours and two attacking tanks were destroyed with
the help of air strikes before the defenders "were
forced to withdraw."
Field reports said some of the government
soldiers made it to the South China Sea, five miles
from the city, and escaped in boats.
There also were field reports, without official
confirmation, that South Vietnamese forces had
completed withdrawing from Xuan Loc, another
provincial capital 40 miles east of Saigon and the
scene of bitter fighting for two weeks.
The fall of both capitals would mean the North
Vietnamese-Viet Cong have gained control of 21 of
South Vietnam's 44 provinces in the onslaught they
unleashed last month.
Saigon headquarters also reported that Bien Hoa
air base, 15 miles north of the capital, was shelled
again today. The base, which is the last major South
Vietnamese air force installation outside Saigon, has
been shelled regularly over the past several weeks.
U.S. Eases Entry Rules
Americans and South Vietnamese continued to
be evacuated yesterday from Saigon. Immigration
procedures were relaxed as officials prepared to
admit the refugees.
In Washington, President Ford told Republican
congressional leaders yesterday an evacuation
speed-up will leave only 1500 Americans in Saigon
by nightfall. At the same time, immigration officials
said they would admit up to 129,000 refugees from
Indochina to the United States.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service said
the refugees would include 50,000 South
Vietnamese who a spokesman said would be under a
high risk to their safety if they remained in Saigon
or in parts of Vietnam still controlled by the
Saigon government.
Under emergency parole procedures invoked by
Atty. Gen. Edward Levi to waive normal
immigration processes and make the urgent
immigration possible, U.S. embassy officials in

Saigon will determine which endangered South
Vietnamese are eligible for evacuation.
Meanwhile, at Clark Air Base in the Philippines,
about 4000 Americans and Vietnamese landed
yesterday in a round-the-clock airlift out of Saigon.
They found a snarl of red tape and long lines
blocking their trip on to the United States.
About 1200 new arrivals were squeezed 20 to a
tent in a hastily erected tent city and had to walk
long distances to water and toilets. Other evacuees
slept on cots in barracks and on mattresses on
gymnasium floors.
Yesterday's passenger total was larger than for
the entire month of April to date, during which
3500 people arrived from Saigon. Most have come
since April 16 when President Ford ordered
nonessential U.S. citizens to leave Vietnam.
Authorities said they expected at least 1000
more people to arrive during the night and said the
tent area could be expanded to house about 5000
people. Many of the arrivals were American men
with Vietnamese wives and children.
In Los Angeles, local officials have begun making
plans for the possible arrival of as many as 130,000
Southeast Asian refugees to the United States.
There was no immediate word, however, as to
when the refugees might begin arriving or precisely
where they would enter the country.
Los Angeles County Supervisor James Hayes
directed county agencies to get started on
contingency planning. Their first action was to call
Florida welfare officials to find out how they
handled refugees from post-Castro Cuba.
However, other local, state and federal officials
in California said they had not been notified of any
impending refugee arrivals.
Grocery Prices Decline Sharply
WASHINGTON — A sharp drop in grocery prices
held the cost of living last month to its smallest
increase in nearly two years, the government
reported yesterday.
Retail prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in
March, half the rate of both January and February
and the least in any month since a two-tenths of 1
percent increase in July 1973, when price controls
were in effect.
All figures were adjusted to account for seasonal
variations. Unadjusted, the increase last month was
four-tenths of 1 percent.
The slowdown in the pace of inflation was
anticipated, since wholesale prices have fallen
steadily over the past four months and this was
expected to be reflected at retail. It also provided
further evidence of the effects of the recession,
which has reduced consumer demand and
discouraged retailers from raising prices.
The March increase was in line with Ford
administration forecasts of an annual inflation rate
of about 6 or 7 percent this year, compared to a
12.2 percent rate in 1974. The latest monthly
increase worked out to an annual rate of increase of
3.5 percent.
Despite the good news on the price front, the
Labor Department said in a separate report that
inflation again eroded the purchasing power of the
average worker's paycheck.
A decline . in working hours combined with
inflation more than offset pay raises last month,

leaving workers with a four-tenths of 1 percent
decline in real spendable earnings. Over the year,
real earnings have dropped 4.8 percent.
SLA Member Questions Witness
SACRAMENTO — Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) member Joseph Remiro calmly cautioned a
prosecution witness against making assumptions
yesterday in the Marcus Foster murder trial.
The defendant cross-examined his first witness
about a proposed security program that may have
triggered the Nov. 6, 1973 assassination of Foster,
Oakland's school superintendent.
Afterward Remiro's attorney, Edward Merrill,
said he felt his client had "handled himself very
well."
Remiro and co-defendant Russell Little won
permission to question prosecution witnesses last
Thursday after they contended that some testimony
had become "politicized."
But they had asked no questions until Remiro
began his cross-examination of John Lenser,
executive director of the Alameda Regional
Criminal Justice Planning Board.
Besides being accused of slaying Foster, Little
and Remiro are charged with wounding Foster's top
aide, Robert Blackburn.
Speaking in a quiet voice, Remiro questioned
Lenser for about 45 minutes about a proposal to use
federal crime-fighting funds to beef up school
security and curb vandalism and truancy.
At one point he cautioned Lenser that he
"should not be making assumptions" in his
testimony. "You should only testify about what
you know for sure," Remiro said.
Lenser testified that the Oakland district had
originally asked for funds only to hire additional
attendance clerks to keep better track of truant
students.
But Lenser said he rejected that proposal and
drew up a suggested program that involved use of
campus safety coordinators and additional security
personnel.
Oil Companies Report Profits Drop
NEW YORK — U.S. oil companies with
worldwide operations reported earnings declines
yesterday ranging from about 11 percent to 66
percent from last year's postembargo peaks.
Exxon Corp., the world's biggest oil producer,
said first-quarter profits fell 11.1 percent.
Texaco Inc., the second-largest U.S. oil firm, said
first-quarter earnings plunged 66 percent below last
year and Gulf Oil Corp., the fourth largest, said its
three-month profits were down 33 percent in a year.
The U.S. Tax Reduction Act of 1975 which
repealed the oil depletion allowance for large oil
companies and changed some of their foreign tax
credits sizably reduced earnings, the companies said.
