# In ASSU Runoff Elections
## Students To Cast Ballots 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Voters go to the polls today and
tomorrow to cast ballots in the
Council of Presidents (COP) runoff
and on the controversial Committee of
15 (C-15) proposal for a Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC).
Polling places will be open both
days from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the
Quad's History Corner, the Graduate
School of Business, the Physics Tank
and the Medical School. The Post
Office and the Engineering Corner
polling places will be open from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m.
The heads of the two COP slates,
ASSU Senate Chairman Lee
Rosenbaum and ASSU Senator Kevin
McDermott, concluded pre-election

campaigning last night by debating
major issues on KZSU (see related
story on this page).
Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo,Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane stress
student involvement, improved
ASSU/student communication and
experience in their COP campaign.
Their platform includes proposals
for peer advising, a women's building,
a SWOPSI course to examine
University financing and tuition and a
community buying guide.
McDermott, Bonny Rodden, Andy
Leuchter and Mark Simonian are
stressing "incremental changes" as
opposed to major new proposals in
their campaign.
This slate's platform promises
regular surveys of student opinion,
publication of University committee
agendas, an off-campus shuttle bus
service, a night eatery, a guide to
off-campus living and a Residential
Speakers/Visitors Program.
The major changes proposed by the
C-15 are:
—a student majority judicial panel
to adjudicate alleged violations of the
Honor Code (a faculty-majority panel
would hear all other cases);
—selection of student members of
the SJC by the ASSU Senate from a
randomly compiled list of 24 students
who express an interest in serving.
ASSU President Mike Herman

supports the proposal, arguing that it
would take at least two years before
the C-15 could come up with another
proposal.
Herman and C-15 Chairwoman
Kathy Cunningham have expressed
doubt that faculty members on the
C-15 would be willing to draft further
judicial system proposals.
Cunningham also noted that Honor
Code cases have provided the bulk of
judicial panel hearings this year and
probably will do so for at least the
next two years.
Opponents of the measure have
pointed out that the current proposal
calls for a faculty majority in some
cases and provides for a different
system for selection of student and
faculty members. Under the proposal,
faculty members are appointed by the
Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees.
Also on tomorrow's ballot will be a
rerun of the senior class race, with
four of the six slates on the ballot, and
a special runoff next week if no slate
receives a majority of the votes.
Although the ASSU Senate voted
Monday night to allow all six slates,
the slates headed by Leo Salazar and
Frank Ramirez have declined to
appear on the ballot.
In the order they will appear on the
ballot, the slate heads are Lyse Strnad,
Gina Anastasi, Dan Poston and "Weird
Walt" Spevak.

CANDIDATES FACE-OFF—ASSU presidential contender Lee Rosenbaum (left) considers a response as his opponent, Kevin
McDermott, presents his slate's proposals in last night's KZSU-sponsored debate. The two candidates disagreed sharply on
a number of issues including the financial role of the ASSU and the proposed Stanford Judicial Council.
