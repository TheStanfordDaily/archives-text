# Housing Officials Correct Mistake
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The Housing Office announced
yesterday that it has developed a plan
to fully correct the misallocation of
this year's freshman class' guaranteed
housing years.
After further study of the error,
discovered only Monday, the Housing
Office isolated the cause and took
steps to correct it. said Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Larry
Horton.
In a letter to the Daily, Horton said
that the 97 people who chose their
junior-senior years as first preference,
sophomore-junior as second choice
and sophomore-senior as third choice
were inadvertantly switched with the
group of 40 students who preferred
sophomore-senior, then junior-senior
and sophomore-junior.
Junior-Senior
Consequently, "the 40 people who
ranked their choice sophomore-senior,
junior-senior and sophomore-junior
were treated as if they had asked for
junior-senior first, and they were all
granted guarantees for their junior and
senior years," wrote Horton.
The 97 were treated as if they had
asked for sophomore-senior years first,
Horton said, adding that most of these
students were given sophomore-senior
guarantees, but some received
guaranteed junior-senior years.
To remedy the error the Housing
Office said that it will grant any
student fitting the above two
categories his original preference if he
comes to the office and requests that
the change be made.
"We regret the error, and we hope
that the matter has been satisfactorily
corrected," apologized Horton.
Housing Petition
Any students who feel particularly
hard-pressed by the outcome of the
guaranteed housing program always
are free to submit a special petition to
the Housing Office, noted Richard
Wales, the senior who is in charge of
data processing for the draw.
However, he warned that "the
priority route is probably not going to
be efficacious."
The cause of the housing foul-up
was his error Wales admitted. "It was a
mistake for which I am responsible.
"The whole thing was done by
hand except for the random sorting
done by the computer," Wales
explained. "The method in which I did
it was the correct method, but I made
an error in implementing it."
Error Eliminated
Wales said that next year this
human error should not occur, because
he will write a program to allow the
entire procedure of assigning

guaranteed years to be done by
computer.
Wales said he forsees no computer
problems like those encountered by
him when he processed housing
guarantee cards by hand.
"I have complete faith in the draw
program because it has been tested five
times successfully," he stated. "It is
thoroughly self-checking. . . The
results have always been correct."
He predicted that the computer
draw program would "run flawlessly."
Horton agreed with Wales
statements.
"The draw program has been
thoroughly tested and debugged, and I
do not anticipate any errors in
processing the draw cards," he stated.
"In any case, we intend to check the
draw results thoroughly before
declaring them official and distributing
response cards."

an error in implementing it."
Error Eliminated
Wales said that next year this
human error should not occur, because
he will write a program to allow the
entire procedure of assigning

guaranteed years to be done by
computer.
Wales said he forsees no computer
problems like those encountered by
him when he processed housing
guarantee cards by hand.
"I have complete faith in the draw
program because it has been tested five
times successfully," he stated. "It is
thoroughly self-checking. . . The
results have always been correct."
He predicted that the computer
draw program would "run flawlessly."
Horton agreed with Wales
statements.
"The draw program has been
thoroughly tested and debugged, and I
do not anticipate any errors in
processing the draw cards," he stated.
"In any case, we intend to check the
draw results thoroughly before
declaring them official and distributing
response cards."
The Housing Office announced
yesterday that it has developed a plan
to fully correct the misallocation of
this year's freshman class' guaranteed
housing years.
After further study of the error,
discovered only Monday, the Housing
Office isolated the cause and took
steps to correct it. said Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Larry
Horton.
In a letter to the Daily, Horton said
that the 97 people who chose their
junior-senior years as first preference,
sophomore-junior as second choice
and sophomore-senior as third choice
were inadvertantly switched with the
group of 40 students who preferred
sophomore-senior, then junior-senior
and sophomore-junior.
Junior-Senior
Consequently, "the 40 people who
ranked their choice sophomore-senior,
junior-senior and sophomore-junior
were treated as if they had asked for
junior-senior first, and they were all
granted guarantees for their junior and
senior years," wrote Horton.
The 97 were treated as if they had
asked for sophomore-senior years first,
Horton said, adding that most of these
students were given sophomore-senior
guarantees, but some received
guaranteed junior-senior years.
To remedy the error the Housing
Office said that it will grant any
student fitting the above two
categories his original preference if he
comes to the office and requests that
the change be made.
"We regret the error, and we hope
that the matter has been satisfactorily
corrected," apologized Horton.
Housing Petition
Any students who feel particularly
hard-pressed by the outcome of the
guaranteed housing program always
are free to submit a special petition to
the Housing Office, noted Richard
Wales, the senior who is in charge of
data processing for the draw.
However, he warned that "the
priority route is probably not going to
be efficacious."
The cause of the housing foul-up
was his error Wales admitted. "It was a
mistake for which I am responsible.
"The whole thing was done by
hand except for the random sorting
done by the computer," Wales
explained. "The method in which I did
it was the correct method, but I made
an error in implementing it."
