# COP Debate Sparks New Accusations
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)
opponents Kevin McDermott and Lee
Rosenbaum squared off in a
face-to-face debate on the eve of
today's election for the first time in
the campaign.
On a KZSU-sponsored program, the
presidential hopefuls traded charges
and accusations on issues including
ASSU financing, student input into
the ASSU and experience they have
had in working for the students in the
past.
McDermott, running with Bonny
Rodden, Andy Leuchter and Mark
Simonian, emphasized his slate's
"direct contact with students" and
research of possible proposals
Rosenbaum, whose vice presidential
candidates are Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane,
countered by citing his slate members'
experience in working for the students
and their openness to student opinion.
Rosenbaum said during the debate
that his slate had received the
endorsement of the three slates that
were eliminated in the primary,
headed by Steven Weiss, Mike Lopez
and Charles Jameson.
However, the Daily learned last
night that confusion surrounds the
Weiss endorsement. The Weiss slate
finished third with 19 percent of the
vote. _
Weiss said last night that he did
indeed say "we'll endorse you" but
that he "didn't think it would be
taken seriously or have any
implication any further than the
telephone conversation."
Weiss admitted he was drunk at the
time.
Rosenbaum said last night that he
took the call, initiated by Jim Hu of
the Chaparral, as serious. "They said
they were endorsing us and they
would take care of publicizing it."
Weiss and Rosen baum have not been
in touch since Friday, when the
conversation took place.
Weiss said his slate has given no
official endorsement. "If it did, it
would appear in a public medium and
not via the mouth of a candidate."
However, he said he considered it a
trivial point now, and that he didn't
care.
Rosenbaum added that he was
"embarassed and sorry it's the case."
Sharpest debate last night centered
around the slates' financing proposals.
Rosenbaum criticized the
"break-even" concept applied to
ASSU Special Events.
He added that events such as
Special Events are luxuries, and should
therefore make money to pay for
fixed costs and non-income generating
projects such as the Course Review.
McDermott countered that "a
break-even operation has to cover

fixed costs." He attacked Rosenbaum
as "wanting to bilk students" by
funding such projects. He suggested
instead that refundable fee assessments
should be used to finance non-income
generating items.
The current Committee of 15
(C-15) proposal for a Stanford Judicial
Council also led to heated discussion,
although both candidates agreed that
the present proposal does not go far
enough.
McDermott said he "would only
advocate acceptance on an interim
basis." Rosenbaum said this was
"typical of McDermott's incremental
changes," and he opposed accepting
it.
