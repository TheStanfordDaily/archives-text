# COP Debate Sparks New Accusations
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)
opponents Kevin McDermott and Lee
Rosenbaum squared off in a
face-to-face debate on the eve of
today's election for the first time in
the campaign.
On a KZSU-sponsored program, the
presidential hopefuls traded charges
and accusations on issues including
ASSU financing, student input into
the ASSU and experience they have
had in working for the students in the
past.
McDermott, running with Bonny
Rodden, Andy Leuchter and Mark
Simonian, emphasized his slate's
"direct contact with students" and
research of possible proposals
Rosenbaum, whose vice presidential
candidates are Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane,
countered by citing his slate members'
experience in working for the students
and their openness to student opinion.
Rosenbaum said during the debate
that his slate had received the
endorsement of the three slates that
were eliminated in the primary,
headed by Steven Weiss, Mike Lopez
and Charles Jameson.
However, the Daily learned last
night that confusion surrounds the
Weiss endorsement. The Weiss slate
finished third with 19 percent of the
vote. _
