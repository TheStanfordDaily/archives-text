# 'Nothing Was Wasted'
## Ellsberg: Anti-War Drive Worked 
### BETSY MORRIS 
"Why did the (Nixon] administration go to
all that trouble of covering up?" Daniel Ellsberg
asked a crowd of approximately 300 in a Gunn
High School auditorium last night.
"I think because they know a secret that they
want to keep from us," he answered himself.
"That is the secret of our own strength. And
their knowledge of it."
Ellsberg, former military adviser who leaked
the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times in
1971, said that at that time he had not been sure
of whether or not they would have any effect on
bringing the Vietnam war to an end.
"But everything worked," he said. "Nothing
was wasted." He cited the demonstrations, draft
resistance, Pentagon Papers and "all the telling of
truth" thai had occurred since the beginning of
U.S. intervention in Indochina as effective
attacks on the weakness of American foreign
policy.
These measures were successful, Ellsberg
added, because they attacked what was both a
central and vulnerable aspect of United States
foreign policy — the lies and secrecy of the
covering-up process. He pointed out that it was
this same process that led to the Watergate
break-in and later to the downfall of the
administration.
Secrecy Process
Ellsberg pointed out that it was this same
secrecy process that led to both the Watergate
break-in and the later downfall of the Nixon
administration itself.
He pointed to the teach-ins and protests of
the war that began early in 1965. Even as early
as this. Ellsberg stated, the American public was
responding against the U.S. bombing a country in
order to prevent its own self-determination.
"Even at that time," Ellsberg stressed, the
Vietnam war had to be a covert war, "because
the Johnson administration knew that they
would not have gotten support for it."
This, Ellsberg said, led to his own leaks of the
Pentagon information which, he says he believed
at the time, to be illegal. But, he said he later
thought, "There was no law that I was

disobeying, though I had been told a hundred
times that there was such a law."
Ellsberg said he felt because the Nixon
administration suspected that he might leak more
secret government information after the release
of the Pentagon Papers, the government
needed to find a way to silence him. "They
couldn't very well do that through the law," he
added, because "though they had a conspiracy
and they had a criminal, they didn't have any

crime." «
It was perhaps for this reason, Ellsberg <
speculated, that the next link in the secrecy *
chain occurred, namely the hiring of E. Howard ■
Hunt and his "plumbers." B
He added that he thought the break-in at the ■
office of his psychoanalyst, Daniel Fielding, was ■
for some information that the government could J
use for blackmail afainst him. •

administration itself.
He pointed to the teach-ins and protests of
the war that began early in 1965. Even as early
as this. Ellsberg stated, the American public was
responding against the U.S. bombing a country in
order to prevent its own self-determination.
"Even at that time," Ellsberg stressed, the
Vietnam war had to be a covert war, "because
the Johnson administration knew that they
would not have gotten support for it."
This, Ellsberg said, led to his own leaks of the
Pentagon information which, he says he believed
at the time, to be illegal. But, he said he later
thought, "There was no law that I was

disobeying, though I had been told a hundred
times that there was such a law."
Ellsberg said he felt because the Nixon
administration suspected that he might leak more
secret government information after the release
of the Pentagon Papers, the government
needed to find a way to silence him. "They
couldn't very well do that through the law," he
added, because "though they had a conspiracy
and they had a criminal, they didn't have any

crime." «

HAND ACROSS THE WATERGATE-Former military adviser Daniel Ellsberg spoke last night at Gunn a
High School to a crowd of about 300 on Watergate and related matters. •
"Why did the (Nixon] administration go to
all that trouble of covering up?" Daniel Ellsberg
asked a crowd of approximately 300 in a Gunn
High School auditorium last night.
"I think because they know a secret that they
want to keep from us," he answered himself.
"That is the secret of our own strength. And
their knowledge of it."
Ellsberg, former military adviser who leaked
the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times in
1971, said that at that time he had not been sure
of whether or not they would have any effect on
bringing the Vietnam war to an end.
"But everything worked," he said. "Nothing
was wasted." He cited the demonstrations, draft
resistance, Pentagon Papers and "all the telling of
truth" thai had occurred since the beginning of
U.S. intervention in Indochina as effective
attacks on the weakness of American foreign
policy.
These measures were successful, Ellsberg
added, because they attacked what was both a
central and vulnerable aspect of United States
foreign policy — the lies and secrecy of the
covering-up process. He pointed out that it was
this same process that led to the Watergate
break-in and later to the downfall of the
administration.
Secrecy Process
