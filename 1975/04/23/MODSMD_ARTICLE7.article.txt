## Election Snafus 
### 
In recent weeks, ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald has on several occasions displayed a lack of
competence in his job, shown his ignorance of the ASSU
constitution and deliberately disregarded normal election
procedure.
The most striking example of this has been Fitzgerald's
handling of the senior class officer election. Fitzgerald
apparently did not understand what the spending limit for
this election was and gave two slates the impression that the
limit was $200 instead of $50.
When challenged about this after those two slates finished
with the highest vote totals, Fitzgerald, on his own initiative,
declared that both the top two slates and the next two slates
in the six-slate election would enter a runoff. On Monday,
the ASSU Senate decided the whole thing had been handled
so ineptly that a new election involving all six slates was
necessary, but the bottom two slates have now withdrawn.
When the Band submitted petitions requesting a $2 fee
assessment and the ASSU Senate had agreed to put a $1
Band assessment on the ballot, Fitzgerald was not sure of
the actual amount the Band was seeking even days after the
discrepancy was first discovered.
And last Thursday night, Fitzgerald made several errors.
First of all, the vote count was not available until 11 p.m.
because it was begun at 7 p.m., rather than at 4 p.m.,
immediately after the polls closed.
Then Fitzgerald barred members of the press (both Daily
and KZSU) from entering the room where votes were being
counted, although he allowed current ASSU Council
members, their friends and representatives of the COP slates
in. This practice is totally alien to the normal election policy
of allowing the press to scrutinize vote-counting operations,
and is doubly offensive in light of the questions aroused by
use of the new computerized system. Before Fitzgerald's
reign, the press has always been permitted to oversee ASSU
vote-counting.
Finally, Fitzgerald did not even know that constitutional
amendments need a two-thirds vote to pass. When asked
after the totals were announced whether a two-thirds
majority was needed, Fitzgerald replied that he'd have to
look that up.
Amidst all these errors, however, Fitzgerald has done one
very good thing. The computer system which he set up for
vote counting is indeed faster, less expensive, more accurate
and less likely to result in fraud than the old system. For
this, at least, we thank him.
