# Zionists Commit Atrocities

Those who write about the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel should be
close to the history of that area.
Supporters of Israel who are trying today, in one
of the biggest propaganda campaigns in history, to
brand the PLO with the label of terrorism, may
forget, or try to forget, some of the facts and
figures.
People who claim that the PLO leaders are all
self-appointed and that they have maintained
themselves in power by using the terror weapon
against their own people are too far from the
Palestinian people and from the PLO history to say
such a statement.
Those who say that the PLO does not represent
the Palestinians without asking even one Palestinian
about his opinion, are saying false things. I lived in
the Middle East until 1974 and understand that all
the Palestinians do believe that the PLO is the sole
representative for their rights.
Who Started Terrorism?
Zionist terrorism in Palestine started in 1936
(about 30 years before the PLO was created) and
has not yet ended I would like to mention here
just a few examples of the Zionist-Israeli terrorism
in Palestine.
In June 1947, the British police in Palestine
arrested three terrorists of the "Irgun" and
sentenced them to death. The terrorist Israeli
organization kidnapped two British sergeants and
threatened to kill them if the death sentence
against the three terrorists were carried out.
The British authorities did carry out the death
sentence and the Irgun hanged the two British
soldiers in a public place. When people and
policemen approached the two bodies, two booby
traps exploded in them.
During the Palestine war (1947-1948), about 17

attacks against Arab villages and mass killing of
villagers were carried out by Zionist groups. The
most atrocious of these was Deir Yassin massacre
carried out by "Irgun" and "Stern" groups on April
9, 1948.
A policeman reported one Arab killed. The next
day, however, the Red Cross discovered the corpses
of 254 men, women and children.
On the eve of the Israeli attack against Egypt in
1956, Israel decided to impose a curfew on Arab
villages on the Israeli side of the border, including
the Arab-Israeli village of Kafr Kassem. At 4:30
p.m. on Oct. 29, Israeli border guards arrived at the
village and announced that there would be a curfew
from 5 p.m. the same night.
Many of the villagers were still working in the
fields outside the village and were not informed of
the curfew. When they returned unaware from
work, they were shot by the border guards.
Between 1956 and 1967, Israel made six attacks
against neighboring Arab territory, killing civilians
and blowing up houses. One of these was the Israeli
attack against Samoe village in Jordan on Nov. 13,
1960. During the attack, a large Israeli force,
including tanks and armored cars, destroyed 125
houses, a school and a clinic.
It is neither just nor logical that researchers start
discussing the subject of terrorism now without
referring to many incidents which were committed
by those who created terrorism long before the
PLO was established or to the atrocities in South
Lebanon.
It is ironic that the advocates of non-violence in
the world today are the same group that introduced
organized terrorist violence into the Palestinian
case.

sentence and the Irgun hanged the two British
soldiers in a public place. When people and
policemen approached the two bodies, two booby
traps exploded in them.
During the Palestine war (1947-1948), about 17

attacks against Arab villages and mass killing of
villagers were carried out by Zionist groups. The
most atrocious of these was Deir Yassin massacre
carried out by "Irgun" and "Stern" groups on April
9, 1948.
A policeman reported one Arab killed. The next
day, however, the Red Cross discovered the corpses
of 254 men, women and children.
On the eve of the Israeli attack against Egypt in
1956, Israel decided to impose a curfew on Arab
villages on the Israeli side of the border, including
the Arab-Israeli village of Kafr Kassem. At 4:30
p.m. on Oct. 29, Israeli border guards arrived at the
village and announced that there would be a curfew
from 5 p.m. the same night.
Many of the villagers were still working in the
fields outside the village and were not informed of
the curfew. When they returned unaware from
work, they were shot by the border guards.
Between 1956 and 1967, Israel made six attacks
against neighboring Arab territory, killing civilians
and blowing up houses. One of these was the Israeli
attack against Samoe village in Jordan on Nov. 13,
1960. During the attack, a large Israeli force,
including tanks and armored cars, destroyed 125
houses, a school and a clinic.
It is neither just nor logical that researchers start
discussing the subject of terrorism now without
referring to many incidents which were committed
by those who created terrorism long before the
PLO was established or to the atrocities in South
Lebanon.
It is ironic that the advocates of non-violence in
the world today are the same group that introduced
organized terrorist violence into the Palestinian
case.

Those who write about the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel should be
close to the history of that area.
Supporters of Israel who are trying today, in one
of the biggest propaganda campaigns in history, to
brand the PLO with the label of terrorism, may
forget, or try to forget, some of the facts and
figures.
People who claim that the PLO leaders are all
self-appointed and that they have maintained
themselves in power by using the terror weapon
against their own people are too far from the
Palestinian people and from the PLO history to say
such a statement.
Those who say that the PLO does not represent
the Palestinians without asking even one Palestinian
about his opinion, are saying false things. I lived in
the Middle East until 1974 and understand that all
the Palestinians do believe that the PLO is the sole
representative for their rights.
Who Started Terrorism?
Zionist terrorism in Palestine started in 1936
(about 30 years before the PLO was created) and
has not yet ended I would like to mention here
just a few examples of the Zionist-Israeli terrorism
in Palestine.
In June 1947, the British police in Palestine
arrested three terrorists of the "Irgun" and
sentenced them to death. The terrorist Israeli
organization kidnapped two British sergeants and
threatened to kill them if the death sentence
against the three terrorists were carried out.
The British authorities did carry out the death
sentence and the Irgun hanged the two British
soldiers in a public place. When people and
policemen approached the two bodies, two booby
traps exploded in them.
During the Palestine war (1947-1948), about 17
