# On buying speakers...

Possibly the single most
important element in any stereo
is the speakers. They are, after
all, what ultimately convert the
electrical impulse from the
source into the sound that you
actually listen to. Unfortunately
they may also be the most
over-looked and under-rated
element as well.
Most of today's stereo
equipment sales are in the form
of package deals. Packages offer
a lot of good brand names,
fair-traded equipment at a
discounted price. But because
most quality manufacturers
abide by fair trade laws, it is
hard for a dealer to discount
these lines without losing his
franchise.
The way that most dealers get
away with discounting
fair-traded items in their
packages is to include one piece
of equipment that is not subject
to fair trade which is inexpensive
enough for the dealer so that the
whole package price will still
bring a fair profit.
Confident Purchases
Electronics are easy to test
for quality and performance,
and any decent manufacturer
publishes these tests, reports and
specifications. With a little
explanation almost anyone can
learn to read and understand
these manufacturers' "specs"
well enough to compare
equipment. In fact, if the
"specs" are accurate, one could
purchase all the electronics he
might need, without ever seeing
anything other than the "specs,"
and be confident about his
purchase.
Speakers on the other hand
can not be rated with
specifications the way
electronics can. Consequently,

speakers become the easiest
element to cut corners on,
without the unsuspecting
customer catching on.
It is easy to railroad many
buyers with terms like "12-inch
woofer" or "five-way cross
over network." A lot of these
technical terms and buzz words
have little or no bearing on the
true function of a speaker.
The most important feature
of any speaker is not how many
elements each cabinet has, or
how much power it can handle,
or even how many of the latest
speaker designs it entails. But
rather, the most important
aspect of a speaker is how it
sounds. Is it accurate? After all
your stereo should not sound
like a good stereo, but instead as
much like the live performance
as possible.
Accurate Speakers
When you go looking for
speakers it is important to find
speakers that are accurate. Then
you can compare the speakers
you may be looking at, or that
are in your price range, with
the ones that are most accurate.
Their are currently a number
of fine quality speakers on the
market which offer flat
response. Dahlquist, Epicure and
Magneplanar are all fine,
accurate speakers, and would be
well worth comparing any
speakers with. Accurate speakers
come in all shapes and sizes and
prices, from $150 on up.
When shopping for speakers,
there are a number of helpful
hints which can be used to either
totally confuse you or help you
make that final decision.
Broad Selection First
First, find a store with a
broad selection of speakers, and
then find yourself a good
