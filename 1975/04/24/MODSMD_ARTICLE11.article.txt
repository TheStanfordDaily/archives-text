### DAN FORTE 
Blues music has always been
caught in a vicious cycle of
sorts. While hardcore blues fans
are among the most dedicated
of record collectors (Who else
but a blues freak would run
down to the record store to
pick up on a "reissue" LP of
cuts he already owns on 455?),
they comprise only a very
small percentage of the total
record buying audience.
As a result, the more
prestigious record companies
shy away from blues music,
relegating it to the few
independent labels which don't
have enough dollars to
adequately advertise and
distribute their products.
Probably the biggest news
for blues fanatics in recent
years is the announcement by
Columbia Records of the
repackaging of two LP's
already on the shelves. Robert
Johnson's King of the Delta
Blues Singers, volumes one and
two, will soon be re-released
with the addition of a few
scraps of tape, including false
starts, mistakes, etc. The selling
point of the repeat
performance, though, will be
the new cover — the first
photograph ever unearthed of
Johnson (who died in 1937).
In the eyes of the blues
afficionado.this is equivalent to
the second coming of Christ.
Son House
14 Songs From the Man Who

Taught Robert Johnson
Blue Goose 2016
Perhaps designed to
coincide with Columbia's
upcoming release, this Blue
Goose record may be the last
of Son House's recorded
output, now that he has
retired. Made up of recordings
from the early 19605, the LP
holds nowhere near the punch
of Columbia's Father of the
Folk Blues. But, these
recordings still have a lot of the
fire of Robert Johnson's most
immediate predecessor.
Unfortunately, the album
seems to slow itself down with
several tunes in the same
tempo. Two notable
exceptions are "Hobo" and
"The D.T. Moan," the record's
only instrumental.
In the latter stages of his
career, House began mixing
sacred material into his
repertoire more and more,
having been a Baptist preacher
before playing blues. The best
selection of this type is "Lord
Have Mercy When I Come to
Die."
As for blues, plenty of
House's masterful
bottlenecking is included,
played on his National Steel
guitar. "Pony Blues" would
have to stand out as the best
overall track.
K.C.Douglas
The Country Boy
Arhoolie 1073
Berkeley's Arhoolie label

has finally gotten around to
recording at length an artist
who's been sitting right in i t s
own backyard — sweeping
streets, as a matter of fact.
K.C. Douglas, 61, and still a
Berkeley street sweeper, is
featured here with his partner
of seven years, harmonica
player Richard Riggins. In fact,
Riggins all but steals the show,
and proves himself worthy of

his own LP. (He now has a few
45s on the Blues Connoiseur
label, as does Douglas.)
Side one finds K.C. and
Riggins alone on acoustic
instruments, and is far superior

to side two which is electrified,
with added drums and guitar;
Jim Marshall and Ron
Thompson, respectively.
The "band" side gets
slightly repetitious, in a sort of
John Lee Hooker bag, while
K.C. and Riggins left alone are
a bit like Sonny Terry and
Brownie McGhee. K.C.'s soft,
mellow voice makes every song
equally fine.

Jimmy Witherspoon
Live Is A Five Letter Word
Capitol ST-11360
Jimmy Witherspoon's first
recording for this major label is
one of his most commercial

ventures to date. But, even
with the expert English session
men, strings and background
vocals, Witherspoon's Far Out
Productions is no doubt
kicking itself for never having
recorded Spoon with his
onetime bandleader Robben
Ford, now a member of the
L.A. Express.
Basically, this album can be
divided in half in terms of
blues and soul-rock, with blues
getting a slightly shorter end.
The blues in evidence is of an
extremely high caliber, but the
rest of the record dilutes and
distracts.
Spoon possesses possibly
the best voice of any
contemporary blues singer,
even though much of the
clarity of, say, 15 years ago has
become rougher. As 8.8. King
said of Spoon, "I don't think
of him as a great blues singer, I
think of him as a great singer
who sings blues."
Spoon belts out powerful
blues on "Nothing's Changed,"
and the title tune, which makes
the new spelling of the word
"love" almost convincing,
(M-O-N-E-Y). The mellower
blues tunes are Johnny Fuller's
"Fool's Paradise" and Spoon's
own "I Was Lost (But Now I'm
Found)" which are the
highlights of the session. In
fact, they are worth the price
of the record, which is
unfortunate in a way, since the
remainder of the LP isn't
worth listening to at all.
