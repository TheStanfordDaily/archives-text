# Scher rocks ASSU in style
## Today Stanford ... tomorrow Scher Productions? 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
and PATRICK McCARTHY
Inside his cramped, dissheveled single on the
Row, Danny Scher's thick-lensed, light-sensitive
eyeglasses are a pale, practically colorless shade of
pink.
Besides a thin layer of dust, the room is covered
with posters of Duke Ellington, books ranging from
Federal Income Taxation to Jazz in the Sixties
(with the music books far outnumbering the
business books), a shopping bag filled with dirty
laundry and photographs — Mimi Farina, Loggins
and Messina, Gordon Lightfoot and Danny Scher
handing out flowers after a Joan Baez concert.
"I have a photographer that took all of these,"
he says making a circle with his finger. "Isn't this
one great, and look at this one." He gets excited.
The pink eyeglasses get misty when Scher pours
some boiling water through a one-cup coffee
dripper and into a mug that has "peace" painted on
it in every language imaginable.
'Little Luxury'
"This coffee is two-thirds Columbian roast to
one-third French roast," Scher says proudly of his
special blend. "The only little luxury in my life is
coffee at two dollars a pound...."
But that's not really true. His other luxury in
life is one far better than two-dollar coffee . . . it's
his livelihood which, he says, is also his hobby.
Combining hard work, marketing skills and
chutzpah, Scher has produced concerts for
Stanford that have transformed the ASSU from a
suffering business operating deeply in debt to a
profitable one well in the black — so much so that
the ASSU has now been dubbed a "big bucks"
operation.

A typical Scher working day is 18 to 20 hours
long. He spends part of the time in classes at the
"Biz" School (where he'll receive an M.B.A. in
June) but most of his hours are spent working in
his ASSU office arranging concerts.
"The logistics that go into a concert are
phenomenal," he says,"and that's the beauty of
it....1 have to be a diplomat, politician and
hard-ass.... I've started the process, I carry through
with the technical set-ups, and by the day before
the concert everything falls in place and your work
is done."
Before that can happen, though, Scher takes
special care in utilizing modern marketing
techniques to develop his audiences.
"An audience has to be nurtured," he says.
"Take Doc and Merle Watson, for example. I wasn't
sure if the audiences at Stanford would accept
them as a lone act. So last May I put them on with
Gordon Lightfoot, and they were a great success.
And last fall when I brought them back to Mem
Aud atone, they sold out" — while only the night
before at Berkeley (where no audience"nurturing"
took place) only 1000 tickets were sold.
'No Soothsayer'
But even Scher admits that marketing
techniques don't always predict success. "I'm no
soothsayer. I have no crystal ball to say how a
group will do ... . This is my job," he says
throwing his arms up in the air. "It's hard to say
whether it's 90 percent skill and 10 percent luck or
10 percent skill and 90 percent luck."
Scher is constantly agonizing over his booking
decisions and continuously seeks reinforcement.
His present concern is over the upcoming Helen
Reddy concert.
"How do you think she's
gonna do? How many tickets do
you think she'll sell? 5000?
10,000?" He asks everyone.
Still, Scher's record of success
is impressive — so impressive that
rock impressario Bill Graham has
given him a job.
"I was his only competition to
live and tell about it,"says Scher.
"He came looking for me. He sent
someone down and they went to
the Daily office and picked up
articles on me. By the time I went
to see [Graham] he had virtually
a dossier on me."
According to Scher, with
Graham he'll be doing much of
the same kind of work he's doing
at Stanford — handling concerts
and developing new markets.
No 'Inferiority'
To take the job, Scher turned
down the "normal" business
school offers with established
corporations. "I don't feel any
inferiority. People don't realize
that rock is as big a business as
anything else. The days of
growing your hair long, buying an
electric guitar and becoming a

great success are over .... It's
now a big business.
"Some people are lawyers,
some are doctors and some put on
concerts. It's a profession like
anything else."
But Scher won't be leaving
Stanford completely. He's
planning a few concerts for the
Office of Public Events (Loggins
and Messina are scheduled for this
summer) and may still produce
concerts for the ASSU on a
free-lance basis.
Most of Scher's energies,
however, will be devoted to
Graham. On one hand, he sees his
new job as a means to an end.
"I'm paying my dues here at
Stanford and I'll be paying my
dues with Graham.... 112 don't like
to say I want to be a Bill Graham,
but that's what I want to be," he
says modestly. "Maybe someday
it'll be Scher Productions — who
knows?"
On the other hand, Scher
muses, "Ever since the second
grade when I began playing
drums, it's been my dream to be
involved in music rather than have
a real job — so in a way, I'm
already there."
