# KZSUD.J.'s defend station's 'free' style
## 
### SANDY WHITE 
"We don't go out of our way
to be obscure. We do go out of
our way to play good music."
That's how Gary Cohen, music
director and disc jockey for
KZSU, defends the station's "free
format."
"Free" means that a D.J. has
almost complete control over his
or her own four to six hour show.
"We allow virtually anything —
but not 'anything' all day long,"
says Cohen, so D.J.'s are
encouraged to sprinkle songs from
certain albums throughout the
show.
But Cohen stresses that the
station is nowhere near as
restrictive as "top 40" stations,
"which is [unfortunately] what
most people want to hear."
Calling it "progressive" or
"underground," Cohen says "we
want [KZSU] to be something
we're proud of."
'A' Albums
The limitations are simple:
each D.J. is asked to play three
cuts from "A" albums, and one
each by an "A" and a "B" artist
per hour.
The "A" list, which i$
compiled by Cohen and
co-director John Jeanes, includes
about 40 new (received within
three months) albums, which are
judged to be of good quality,
popular, good sellers, or made by
popular or good artists. "A" and
"B" artists are selected on similar
criteria, and often overlap the
"A" albums.
Cohen sees use of the "A" list
as insurance that new songs will
be played. "My responsibility is to
turn everyone else on to the new
music." Not only does this keep
the station "progressive," he says,
but record companies are more
likely to send new albums to a
station that will play them.
Although influenced in part by
"hype" from record companies,
Cohen says that "we [the D.J.'s]
like to think we play what we
like." At the same time, they
must also make an effort to please

their audience.
In a telephone survey
conducted earlier this year, KSAN
ranked first, but KZSU came in
third just behind KOME.
A more immediate form of
feedback is the request line.
During "prime time" slots (6
p.m.-2 a.m.) requests may come in
every three or four minutes. What
happens to the request is up to
each D.J.
In Cohen's case, he says, "as
tactfully as I can, I almost ignore
them." But he admits that a
request phoned in by a woman, or
someone who wants to tape a cut
is more likely to be played. In
general, however, he takes his
show seriously. "You feel like
you're creating something," and
inappropriate requests indicate
that the listener is not in tune
with the D.J.'s train of thought.
That thought train is often the
only plan or schedule in the D.J.'s
mind. "I usually come in with
some ideas of what songs will go
good together," says D.J. and
Public Relations Manager Mike
Lopez, "although I don't know
exactly how they'll fit into the
show."
Even though most do not
schedule their shows in advance,
each D.J. must fill out a play I ist
for each show. Jeanes and Cohen
tabulate and send these lists out
monthly to record companies,
other stations, some artists and
clubs.
Many KZSU disc jockeys have
similar tastes in rock music, says
Lopez. The "A" list is well
represented on many shows by
such groups and artists as Blue
Oyster Cult, Journey, Jeff Beck,
Carly Simon, Omega, Peter
Frampton, Led Zeppelin, and
David Bowie. Beyond that, they
can choose from among 7000
albums.

"sophisticated" rock, and Cohen's
Saturday night "new music"
show, during which he plays a
new "album of the week."
Other shows are completely
exempted from the list
requirements, such as jazz and
country-and -western
Lion's Den (soul), MEChA, 6lack
Air (rhythm and blues) and
Sunday's classical program.
Jeanes and Cohen must not
only decide which albums make
up the "A" list, they must keep in
close contact with the major
record companies to make sure
that KZSU receives all the new
albums.
They send out the playlists to
let the companies know which
albums are popular. In return, the
companies mail them new albums.
Although "payola is a myth" as
far as KZSU is concerned, Cohen
estimates that the major
companies spend up to $500 a
year each just sending them

records. KZSU receives 1500 new
albums each year.
KZSU disc jockeys receive no
pay and no units for their work.
Why do they do it? "Most of our
D.J.'s like to boogie," explains
Lopez. But some are after more
than just a good time. As some
think a campus radio station
should, KZSU has proved a
training ground for those
interested in professional
broadcasting.
Some alumni who have made it
big are: Charlie Bennett, '72,
currently the news director at the
NBC affiliate in Boston; Pete
Williams, '74, who works in
Wyoming, again for the NBC
station; Maralee Beck, '72, who is
the noontime anchorperson on
WMAL-TV in Washington, D.C.;
and "Lobster," a D.J. on KOME.
One high school student who
interned at KZSU a few years ago
is now a board engineer at KlOl.

"We don't go out of our way
to be obscure. We do go out of
our way to play good music."
That's how Gary Cohen, music
director and disc jockey for
KZSU, defends the station's "free
format."
"Free" means that a D.J. has
almost complete control over his
or her own four to six hour show.
"We allow virtually anything —
but not 'anything' all day long,"
says Cohen, so D.J.'s are
encouraged to sprinkle songs from
certain albums throughout the
show.
But Cohen stresses that the
station is nowhere near as
restrictive as "top 40" stations,
"which is [unfortunately] what
most people want to hear."
Calling it "progressive" or
"underground," Cohen says "we
want [KZSU] to be something
we're proud of."
'A' Albums
The limitations are simple:
each D.J. is asked to play three
cuts from "A" albums, and one
each by an "A" and a "B" artist
per hour.
The "A" list, which i$
compiled by Cohen and
co-director John Jeanes, includes
about 40 new (received within
three months) albums, which are
judged to be of good quality,
popular, good sellers, or made by
popular or good artists. "A" and
"B" artists are selected on similar
criteria, and often overlap the
"A" albums.
Cohen sees use of the "A" list
as insurance that new songs will
be played. "My responsibility is to
turn everyone else on to the new
music." Not only does this keep
the station "progressive," he says,
but record companies are more
likely to send new albums to a
station that will play them.
Although influenced in part by
"hype" from record companies,
Cohen says that "we [the D.J.'s]
like to think we play what we
like." At the same time, they
must also make an effort to please

their audience.
In a telephone survey
conducted earlier this year, KSAN
ranked first, but KZSU came in
third just behind KOME.
A more immediate form of
feedback is the request line.
During "prime time" slots (6
p.m.-2 a.m.) requests may come in
every three or four minutes. What
happens to the request is up to
each D.J.
In Cohen's case, he says, "as
tactfully as I can, I almost ignore
them." But he admits that a
request phoned in by a woman, or
someone who wants to tape a cut
is more likely to be played. In
general, however, he takes his
show seriously. "You feel like
you're creating something," and
inappropriate requests indicate
that the listener is not in tune
with the D.J.'s train of thought.
That thought train is often the
only plan or schedule in the D.J.'s
mind. "I usually come in with
some ideas of what songs will go
good together," says D.J. and
Public Relations Manager Mike
Lopez, "although I don't know
exactly how they'll fit into the
show."
Even though most do not
schedule their shows in advance,
each D.J. must fill out a play I ist
for each show. Jeanes and Cohen
tabulate and send these lists out
monthly to record companies,
other stations, some artists and
clubs.
Many KZSU disc jockeys have
similar tastes in rock music, says
Lopez. The "A" list is well
represented on many shows by
such groups and artists as Blue
Oyster Cult, Journey, Jeff Beck,
Carly Simon, Omega, Peter
Frampton, Led Zeppelin, and
David Bowie. Beyond that, they
can choose from among 7000
albums.

Other shows are completely

requirements, such as jazz and
country-and -western

Sunday's classical program.
Jeanes and Cohen must not
only decide which albums make
up the "A" list, they must keep in
close contact with the major
record companies to make sure
that KZSU receives all the new
albums.
They send out the playlists to
let the companies know which
albums are popular. In return, the
companies mail them new albums.
Although "payola is a myth" as
far as KZSU is concerned, Cohen
estimates that the major
companies spend up to $500 a
year each just sending them

records. KZSU receives 1500 new
albums each year.
KZSU disc jockeys receive no
pay and no units for their work.
Why do they do it? "Most of our
D.J.'s like to boogie," explains
Lopez. But some are after more
than just a good time. As some
think a campus radio station
should, KZSU has proved a
training ground for those
interested in professional
broadcasting.
Some alumni who have made it
big are: Charlie Bennett, '72,
currently the news director at the
NBC affiliate in Boston; Pete
Williams, '74, who works in
Wyoming, again for the NBC
station; Maralee Beck, '72, who is

to be obscure. We do go out of
our way to play good music."
That's how Gary Cohen, music
director and disc jockey for
KZSU, defends the station's "free
format."
"Free" means that a D.J. has
almost complete control over his
or her own four to six hour show.
"We allow virtually anything —
but not 'anything' all day long,"
says Cohen, so D.J.'s are
encouraged to sprinkle songs from
certain albums throughout the
show.
But Cohen stresses that the
station is nowhere near as
restrictive as "top 40" stations,
"which is [unfortunately] what
most people want to hear."
Calling it "progressive" or
"underground," Cohen says "we
want [KZSU] to be something
we're proud of."
'A' Albums
The limitations are simple:
each D.J. is asked to play three
cuts from "A" albums, and one
each by an "A" and a "B" artist
per hour.
The "A" list, which i$
compiled by Cohen and
co-director John Jeanes, includes
about 40 new (received within
three months) albums, which are
judged to be of good quality,
popular, good sellers, or made by
popular or good artists. "A" and
"B" artists are selected on similar
criteria, and often overlap the
"A" albums.
Cohen sees use of the "A" list
as insurance that new songs will
be played. "My responsibility is to
turn everyone else on to the new
music." Not only does this keep
the station "progressive," he says,
but record companies are more
likely to send new albums to a
station that will play them.
Although influenced in part by
"hype" from record companies,
Cohen says that "we [the D.J.'s]
like to think we play what we
like." At the same time, they
must also make an effort to please

their audience.
In a telephone survey
conducted earlier this year, KSAN
ranked first, but KZSU came in
third just behind KOME.
A more immediate form of
feedback is the request line.
During "prime time" slots (6
p.m.-2 a.m.) requests may come in
every three or four minutes. What
happens to the request is up to
each D.J.
In Cohen's case, he says, "as
tactfully as I can, I almost ignore
them." But he admits that a
request phoned in by a woman, or
someone who wants to tape a cut
is more likely to be played. In
general, however, he takes his
show seriously. "You feel like
you're creating something," and
inappropriate requests indicate
that the listener is not in tune
with the D.J.'s train of thought.
That thought train is often the
only plan or schedule in the D.J.'s
mind. "I usually come in with
some ideas of what songs will go
good together," says D.J. and
Public Relations Manager Mike
Lopez, "although I don't know
exactly how they'll fit into the
show."
Even though most do not
schedule their shows in advance,
each D.J. must fill out a play I ist
for each show. Jeanes and Cohen
tabulate and send these lists out
monthly to record companies,
other stations, some artists and
clubs.
Many KZSU disc jockeys have
similar tastes in rock music, says
Lopez. The "A" list is well
represented on many shows by
such groups and artists as Blue
Oyster Cult, Journey, Jeff Beck,
Carly Simon, Omega, Peter
Frampton, Led Zeppelin, and
David Bowie. Beyond that, they
can choose from among 7000
albums.

Saturday night "new music"
show, during which he plays a
new "album of the week."
Other shows are completely
exempted from the list
requirements, such as jazz and
country-and -western
Lion's Den (soul), MEChA, 6lack
Air (rhythm and blues) and
Sunday's classical program.
Jeanes and Cohen must not
only decide which albums make
up the "A" list, they must keep in
close contact with the major
record companies to make sure
that KZSU receives all the new
albums.
They send out the playlists to
let the companies know which
albums are popular. In return, the
companies mail them new albums.
Although "payola is a myth" as
far as KZSU is concerned, Cohen
estimates that the major
companies spend up to $500 a
year each just sending them

records. KZSU receives 1500 new
albums each year.
KZSU disc jockeys receive no
pay and no units for their work.
Why do they do it? "Most of our
D.J.'s like to boogie," explains
Lopez. But some are after more
than just a good time. As some
think a campus radio station
should, KZSU has proved a
training ground for those
interested in professional
broadcasting.
Some alumni who have made it
big are: Charlie Bennett, '72,
currently the news director at the
NBC affiliate in Boston; Pete
Williams, '74, who works in
Wyoming, again for the NBC
station; Maralee Beck, '72, who is
the noontime anchorperson on
WMAL-TV in Washington, D.C.;
and "Lobster," a D.J. on KOME.
One high school student who
interned at KZSU a few years ago
is now a board engineer at KlOl.
