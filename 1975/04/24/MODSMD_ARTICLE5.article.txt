# Rock biz alive and kicking

### GEORGE POWELL 
Well, it's 1975 and the
mega-buck rock music business
has been around for 10 years, or
so — depending on what dates you
want to use. (It's like the start of
the Middle Ages — was it January
1, 1300 or March 24, 1327?)
Did rock get to where it is
today from the appearance of the
first Beatles album in 1964, or
should you go back to 1962, to
when the Beach Boys began
producing their own records and
experimenting in the recording
studio?
In any case, it's impossible to
catalogue all the influences that
have made rock music the gigantic
industry it is in 1975. Rock has
also merged with other forms of
music, so it covers nearly all the
sound spectrum. You have
jazz-rock, country rock, classical
rock and the funky, danceable
sounds that encompass disco-rock,
soul and reggae. Then you have
nostalgia rock, glitter rock,
electronic instrument rock and
heavy metal rock.
Fuzzy Edges
All are discrete categories, but
all have rather fuzzy edges, and
the areas of overlap are constantly
changing. The one unifying factor
is the potential for big money,
, which is why large conglomerates
now control most of the record
industry.
Admittedly, vinyl to make the
records is more expensive, average
list prices for records have risen in
the past five years from $4.98 to
$6.98 per record, and it's harder
for new groups to break onto the

national scene than it was five or
six years ago. Still, millions of
dollars can be made for promoters
and super stars, and the "spirit"
(desire?) is there among rock fans.
For example, Bob Dylan's
concert tour last year pulled down
more than $3 million, and Dylan
signed a contract with Columbia
Records for a figure only he,
Columbia and the IRS know for
sure. Elton John recently
purchased property in England
worth several hundred thousand
dollars. And the SNACK benefit
concert at Kezar Stadium made
over $200,000 for the financially
plagued San Francisco high
schools' extracurricular activities,
with fewer incidents than would
occur at an average football game.
So the component parts of the
rock culture are alive and well,
although the first flush of
excitement has gone away. "They
can't bust our music," was a
favorite cry eight years ago when
rock and psychedelia were
considered to belong exclusively
to the so-called "counter culture."
Whether rock has "grown up" is
questionable, but it definitely has
become acceptable to the
mainstream culture.
Army Rock
The U.S. Army even wants to
put on a rock concert at Ft.
Campbell, Kentucky, later this
summer in return for 20 percent
of the take. Negotiations are still
in progress, but Army
recognizes the money a
well-promoted rock event can
make.
What, then are the sounds that

are and will be making it big in
1975 which even the Army wants
in on? That's hard to say with any
degree of certainty, so here's a
quick, uncomprehensive once
around the U.S. by regions.
Back east, meaning New York
City and north of the
Mason-Dixon line, decadent,
glittery, showy rock mixed with a
dash of camp from the 1930s and
'40s seems to be on top. The
Manhattan Transfer, who just
finished a San Francisco
engagement, probably synthesized
most of these elements in their
stage show and first record, but
ground was broken by Bette
Midler three years ago when her
"trash with flash" propelled her
to the top of the industry.
The East Coast has always had
an affinity for the heavy metal
style of rock, too, with Blue
Oyster Cult being the prime
eardrum smasher. The Cult's new
album, On Your Feet or On Your
Knees, has that touch of
decadence and masochism that
Easterners seem to love.
Skipping right across the
country, San Francisco has its
flash as well, and it could be
argued that the dress-up concert
trend started right here with Boz
Skaggs at the Paramount Theater
in Oakland last year. Since then
the sassy, brassy Pointer Sisters
have had a formal affair at the San
Francisco Opera House, and
discoteque favorites Labelle have
glittered soulfully at the
Paramount, too. It's safe to say
that their black-tie optional
affairs will definitely continue on
both coasts.
Journey, Graham Central Station
San Francisco will continue to
vie with Los Angeles for
innovative leadership and hot new
groups. San Francisco has had all
the best of it lately with the
Santana offshoot Journey, the Sly
Stone descendant Graham Central
Station and the Berkeley
group-that-made-good Earth
Quake. All have at least one
album already out or
forthcoming.
The South might be the place
that conquers the rock world next
- if i t hasn't already. The
phenomenal popularity of the
Allman Brothers has led to other
southern bands like Marshall
Tucker, Lynard Skynard and Wet
Willie getting increasing notice.
Southern rock isn't quite the
same, though, as the more
country-and-western influenced
rock headquartered at Armadillo
World Headquarters (the
Winterland of Austin, Texas). The
coming thing may be Texas swing
revived from the 19405, as played
by Asleep at the Wheel.
Alice Cooper, Elton John
Making the biggest splash in

1975 will be the heavyweights like
Alice Cooper, Elton John and
other groups that use highly
theatrical presentations. English
groups like Pink Floyd and
Genesis continue to indulge in
avant-garde rock, which depends
heavily on electronics and stage
effects, and in the studio use
16-track recorders, overdubbing
and synthesizers.
The rock scene has really
gotten complicated, much too
much so to cover the scene in a
few paragraphs. In 10 years, rock
has become a worldwide form of
entertainment, not just an
American or English art form.
That's why rock isn't going to
change the world in 1975, because
rock and the world have already
changed in ways that were
unimaginable in the early 19605.
The forms of rock music have
become as diverse as the world
itself with the two unifying
themes being money and
showmanship, in combination
with or totally separated from
musical ability.
In 1975, then, it's
showmanship and money that
hold the rock music industry
together, not any vision of
revolution or love as in the past.
