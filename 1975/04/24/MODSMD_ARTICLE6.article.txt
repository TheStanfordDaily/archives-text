# Stereos: a look at today's market
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
It's Brahms, Beethoven, Stevie
Wonder, Elton John, Olivia Newton-John
and Alice Cooper. It can be heard on
KFOG, KABL, KYA and KFRC. And
indeed, most people call it music.
In an earlier time, that music would
have been experienced live, in person. But
today most music is consumed vicariously
— not through sitting in a theater but by
listening to a radio, or, more and more
frequently, by stereo.
In hard economic times, stereos have
become a booming business. As one local
salesman puts it, "They're cheaper than
repeatedly buying tickets to shows. And
you can bring music into your home
where you can smoke legally."
Stereos now come in all forms, ranging
in price from $100 components to
$10,000 systems. With so much stereo
equipment flooding the market, a look at
current products, new innovations and
consumer demand seems appropriate.
Cheapest Available
The cheapest systems currently
available are the so-called
"mini-compact" systems. The most
popular models, made by Sony and
Panasonic, according to an Alco Home
electronics salesman, feature built-in
turntables, AM-FM stereo radios, either
cassette or eight-track tape decks and
detachable speakers. Sony's cheapest
model, the HPI6I (under $200), does not
contain a tape deck. Sanyo and Zenith

also manufacture units for under $150.
According to several hi-fi salesmen in
the Stanford area, these units are
gradually being left behind by consumers
who are heading for separate and more
expensive components.
Receivers in the $250 to $700 range,
manufactured by Kenwood and Pioneer,
are among the most popular. Salesmen
agree that although tuners, amplifiers and
preamplifiers (components which make
up receivers) can be purchased separately,
85 percent of all consumers choose
receivers. Of those who don't, most seem
concerned with power output. Many
purchase separate amplifiers such as the
Yamaha B1 ($1850) with 150 watts per
channel or Phase Linear's 350 watt per
channel model at $700. (Most receivers
put out between 20 and 100 watts per
channel.)
Quadraphonics
Quadraphonic receivers are not in large
demand, according to the owner of
Weingarten Stereo in Menlo Park. "Two
channel sound gives a better and more
accurate reproduction of the original
performance," he says, "Less than 10
percent of all purchasers buy quad." The
most demanded quad receiver is Pioneer's
($660). The best and most expensive
two-channel receivers are made by
Marantz ($250 to $800) and Mcintosh
(starting at $900). Naturally, they feature
tuning meters and, in some cases,
oscilloscopes.

Speakers seem less definable in terms
of quality. "There's no such thing as a
most popular speaker; it's like a most
popular wine. What's that?" says a Cal
Hifi salesman. "It's a matter of taste."
Speakers range in price from the
inexpensive Marantz's ($6O each) to the
Infinity Servo static speaker at $3000.
One popular model is the Heil airmotion
transformer ($lOB to $450) with less
than four percent distortion as opposed
to 15 to 25 percent in other speakers.
JBL's "Century 100" speakers (at $300
each) also provide a "bright and crisp
sound," according to one salesman. For a
system with greater power, the Bose 501
and 901 speakers ($175 and $613,
respectively) provide a live concert hall
effect. (They require a minimum of 100
watts per channel.)
Turntables
Perhaps the greatest recent innovation
in stereo equipment has occurred in
turntables. It is direct drive as opposed to
belt drive. The direct drive tables (Sony,
Pioneer, Dual and Panasonic) sell for over
$300 but — because they are driven
directly by the motor instead of pulleys
— provide less distortion. However,
according to several salesmen, 90 percent
of consumers buy belt driven tables. The
most popular tables are still changers
(which stack records) manufactured by
Garrard and BSR (under $100) and BIC
and Dual (over $100). Other popular
tables are the belt drive pioneer 120

($120), the Thorens TD 125 ($200) and
the Phillips 212 ($200), which features
touch-sensitive speed controls (similar to
elevator buttons). The most expensive
turntable (for private consumption) is the
Technics (by Panasonic) model SPIO
($469) equipped with a Shure SME (low
tracking error) tone arm ($150).
Cartridges (which contain the stylus
that plays records) are also diverse and
expensive, the most popular made by
Shure and Stanton (a division of
Pickering) and selling for $35 to $100.
One salesman claims that discrete
quadraphonic cartridges (such as Audio
Technics', $65 to $150) are worth
purchasing even for a two channel system
to "gain extended frequency and better
fidelity."
Tape Decks
The last major accessory for a stereo
system should be a tape deck, according
to critics and salesmen. More people
currently buy cassette rather than reel to
reel decks, says one salesman, because
cassettes are "more convenient." The
most expensive cassette deck is
Nakamichi's ($1100), which features
dolby noise reduction and microphone
and line mixing (a new innovation in
cassettes). Cheaper units featuring mixing
are the Harmon Kardon and Akai (under
$400). Most people purchase Teac
(because of the name). Dokorder, Advent
and Tannberg ($2OO 400) are also
competitive.
In reel to reel equipment, Sony
makes the cheapest (under $200)
and some of the most expensive
(over $1000). Dokorder ($400)
and Teac (at least $400) are
popular Quadraphonic decks,
according to one salesman, are
only purchased by 35 to 40
percent of the people who own
quad systems.
Headphones, in case you think
they are minor items, range from

$20 to $189. Currently,
Sennheisers ($4O) are the most
popular. Quad phones, with two
speakers in each earpiece, are
reportedly not doing well because
people only have two ears.
With so much equipment on
the market, several salesmen agree
that consumers can become
contused. One salesman
unknowingly acknowledged that
consumers can also become easily
cheated: "They're ignorant,
man," he said, "They don't know
nothing."

tables are the belt drive pioneer 120

($120), the Thorens TD 125 ($200) and
the Phillips 212 ($200), which features
touch-sensitive speed controls (similar to
elevator buttons). The most expensive
turntable (for private consumption) is the
Technics (by Panasonic) model SPIO
($469) equipped with a Shure SME (low
tracking error) tone arm ($150).
Cartridges (which contain the stylus
that plays records) are also diverse and
expensive, the most popular made by
Shure and Stanton (a division of
Pickering) and selling for $35 to $100.
One salesman claims that discrete
quadraphonic cartridges (such as Audio
Technics', $65 to $150) are worth
purchasing even for a two channel system
to "gain extended frequency and better
fidelity."
Tape Decks
The last major accessory for a stereo
system should be a tape deck, according
to critics and salesmen. More people
currently buy cassette rather than reel to
reel decks, says one salesman, because
cassettes are "more convenient." The
most expensive cassette deck is
Nakamichi's ($1100), which features
dolby noise reduction and microphone
and line mixing (a new innovation in
cassettes). Cheaper units featuring mixing
are the Harmon Kardon and Akai (under
$400). Most people purchase Teac
(because of the name). Dokorder, Advent
and Tannberg ($2OO 400) are also
competitive.
In reel to reel equipment, Sony
makes the cheapest (under $200)
and some of the most expensive
(over $1000). Dokorder ($400)
and Teac (at least $400) are
popular Quadraphonic decks,
according to one salesman, are
only purchased by 35 to 40
percent of the people who own
quad systems.
Headphones, in case you think
they are minor items, range from

$20 to $189. Currently,
Sennheisers ($4O) are the most
popular. Quad phones, with two
speakers in each earpiece, are
reportedly not doing well because
people only have two ears.
With so much equipment on
the market, several salesmen agree
that consumers can become
contused. One salesman
unknowingly acknowledged that
consumers can also become easily
cheated: "They're ignorant,
man," he said, "They don't know
nothing."
It's Brahms, Beethoven, Stevie
Wonder, Elton John, Olivia Newton-John
and Alice Cooper. It can be heard on
KFOG, KABL, KYA and KFRC. And
indeed, most people call it music.
In an earlier time, that music would
have been experienced live, in person. But
today most music is consumed vicariously
— not through sitting in a theater but by
listening to a radio, or, more and more
frequently, by stereo.
In hard economic times, stereos have
become a booming business. As one local
salesman puts it, "They're cheaper than
repeatedly buying tickets to shows. And
you can bring music into your home
where you can smoke legally."
Stereos now come in all forms, ranging
in price from $100 components to
$10,000 systems. With so much stereo
equipment flooding the market, a look at
current products, new innovations and
consumer demand seems appropriate.
Cheapest Available
The cheapest systems currently
available are the so-called
"mini-compact" systems. The most
popular models, made by Sony and
Panasonic, according to an Alco Home
electronics salesman, feature built-in
turntables, AM-FM stereo radios, either
cassette or eight-track tape decks and
detachable speakers. Sony's cheapest
model, the HPI6I (under $200), does not
contain a tape deck. Sanyo and Zenith

also manufacture units for under $150.
According to several hi-fi salesmen in
the Stanford area, these units are
gradually being left behind by consumers
who are heading for separate and more
expensive components.
Receivers in the $250 to $700 range,
manufactured by Kenwood and Pioneer,
are among the most popular. Salesmen
agree that although tuners, amplifiers and
preamplifiers (components which make
up receivers) can be purchased separately,
85 percent of all consumers choose
receivers. Of those who don't, most seem
concerned with power output. Many
purchase separate amplifiers such as the
Yamaha B1 ($1850) with 150 watts per
channel or Phase Linear's 350 watt per
channel model at $700. (Most receivers
put out between 20 and 100 watts per
channel.)
Quadraphonics
Quadraphonic receivers are not in large
demand, according to the owner of
Weingarten Stereo in Menlo Park. "Two
channel sound gives a better and more
accurate reproduction of the original
performance," he says, "Less than 10
percent of all purchasers buy quad." The
most demanded quad receiver is Pioneer's
($660). The best and most expensive
two-channel receivers are made by
Marantz ($250 to $800) and Mcintosh
(starting at $900). Naturally, they feature
tuning meters and, in some cases,
oscilloscopes.

Speakers seem less definable in terms
of quality. "There's no such thing as a
most popular speaker; it's like a most
popular wine. What's that?" says a Cal
Hifi salesman. "It's a matter of taste."
Speakers range in price from the
inexpensive Marantz's ($6O each) to the
Infinity Servo static speaker at $3000.
One popular model is the Heil airmotion
transformer ($lOB to $450) with less
than four percent distortion as opposed
to 15 to 25 percent in other speakers.
JBL's "Century 100" speakers (at $300
each) also provide a "bright and crisp
sound," according to one salesman. For a
system with greater power, the Bose 501
and 901 speakers ($175 and $613,
respectively) provide a live concert hall
effect. (They require a minimum of 100
watts per channel.)
Turntables
Perhaps the greatest recent innovation
in stereo equipment has occurred in
turntables. It is direct drive as opposed to
belt drive. The direct drive tables (Sony,
Pioneer, Dual and Panasonic) sell for over
$300 but — because they are driven
directly by the motor instead of pulleys
— provide less distortion. However,
according to several salesmen, 90 percent
of consumers buy belt driven tables. The
most popular tables are still changers
(which stack records) manufactured by
Garrard and BSR (under $100) and BIC
and Dual (over $100). Other popular
tables are the belt drive pioneer 120

($120), the Thorens TD 125 ($200) and
the Phillips 212 ($200), which features
touch-sensitive speed controls (similar to
elevator buttons). The most expensive

receivers. Of those who don't, most seem
concerned with power output. Many
purchase separate amplifiers such as the
Yamaha B1 ($1850) with 150 watts per
channel or Phase Linear's 350 watt per
channel model at $700. (Most receivers
put out between 20 and 100 watts per
channel.)
Quadraphonics
Quadraphonic receivers are not in large
demand, according to the owner of
Weingarten Stereo in Menlo Park. "Two
channel sound gives a better and more
accurate reproduction of the original
performance," he says, "Less than 10
percent of all purchasers buy quad." The
most demanded quad receiver is Pioneer's
($660). The best and most expensive
two-channel receivers are made by
Marantz ($250 to $800) and Mcintosh
(starting at $900). Naturally, they feature
tuning meters and, in some cases,
oscilloscopes.

Speakers seem less definable in terms
of quality. "There's no such thing as a
most popular speaker; it's like a most
popular wine. What's that?" says a Cal
Hifi salesman. "It's a matter of taste."
Speakers range in price from the
inexpensive Marantz's ($6O each) to the
Infinity Servo static speaker at $3000.
One popular model is the Heil airmotion
transformer ($lOB to $450) with less
than four percent distortion as opposed
to 15 to 25 percent in other speakers.
JBL's "Century 100" speakers (at $300
each) also provide a "bright and crisp
sound," according to one salesman. For a
system with greater power, the Bose 501
and 901 speakers ($175 and $613,
respectively) provide a live concert hall
effect. (They require a minimum of 100
watts per channel.)
Turntables
Perhaps the greatest recent innovation
in stereo equipment has occurred in
turntables. It is direct drive as opposed to
belt drive. The direct drive tables (Sony,
Pioneer, Dual and Panasonic) sell for over
$300 but — because they are driven
directly by the motor instead of pulleys
— provide less distortion. However,
according to several salesmen, 90 percent
of consumers buy belt driven tables. The
most popular tables are still changers
(which stack records) manufactured by
Garrard and BSR (under $100) and BIC
and Dual (over $100). Other popular
tables are the belt drive pioneer 120

($120), the Thorens TD 125 ($200) and
the Phillips 212 ($200), which features
touch-sensitive speed controls (similar to
elevator buttons). The most expensive
turntable (for private consumption) is the
Technics (by Panasonic) model SPIO
($469) equipped with a Shure SME (low
tracking error) tone arm ($150).
Cartridges (which contain the stylus
that plays records) are also diverse and
expensive, the most popular made by
Shure and Stanton (a division of
Pickering) and selling for $35 to $100.
One salesman claims that discrete
quadraphonic cartridges (such as Audio
Technics', $65 to $150) are worth
purchasing even for a two channel system
to "gain extended frequency and better
fidelity."
Tape Decks
The last major accessory for a stereo
system should be a tape deck, according
to critics and salesmen. More people
currently buy cassette rather than reel to
reel decks, says one salesman, because
cassettes are "more convenient." The
most expensive cassette deck is
Nakamichi's ($1100), which features
dolby noise reduction and microphone
and line mixing (a new innovation in
cassettes). Cheaper units featuring mixing
are the Harmon Kardon and Akai (under
$400). Most people purchase Teac
(because of the name). Dokorder, Advent
and Tannberg ($2OO 400) are also
competitive.
In reel to reel equipment, Sony
makes the cheapest (under $200)
and some of the most expensive
(over $1000). Dokorder ($400)
and Teac (at least $400) are
popular Quadraphonic decks,
according to one salesman, are
only purchased by 35 to 40
percent of the people who own
quad systems.
Headphones, in case you think
they are minor items, range from

$20 to $189. Currently,
Sennheisers ($4O) are the most
popular. Quad phones, with two
speakers in each earpiece, are
reportedly not doing well because
people only have two ears.
With so much equipment on
the market, several salesmen agree
that consumers can become
contused. One salesman
unknowingly acknowledged that
consumers can also become easily
cheated: "They're ignorant,
man," he said, "They don't know
nothing."
It's Brahms, Beethoven, Stevie
Wonder, Elton John, Olivia Newton-John
and Alice Cooper. It can be heard on
KFOG, KABL, KYA and KFRC. And
indeed, most people call it music.
In an earlier time, that music would
have been experienced live, in person. But
today most music is consumed vicariously
— not through sitting in a theater but by
listening to a radio, or, more and more
frequently, by stereo.
In hard economic times, stereos have
become a booming business. As one local
salesman puts it, "They're cheaper than
repeatedly buying tickets to shows. And
you can bring music into your home
where you can smoke legally."
Stereos now come in all forms, ranging
in price from $100 components to
$10,000 systems. With so much stereo
equipment flooding the market, a look at
current products, new innovations and
consumer demand seems appropriate.
Cheapest Available
The cheapest systems currently
available are the so-called
"mini-compact" systems. The most
popular models, made by Sony and
Panasonic, according to an Alco Home
electronics salesman, feature built-in
turntables, AM-FM stereo radios, either
cassette or eight-track tape decks and
detachable speakers. Sony's cheapest
model, the HPI6I (under $200), does not
contain a tape deck. Sanyo and Zenith

also manufacture units for under $150.
According to several hi-fi salesmen in
the Stanford area, these units are
gradually being left behind by consumers
who are heading for separate and more
expensive components.
Receivers in the $250 to $700 range,
manufactured by Kenwood and Pioneer,
are among the most popular. Salesmen
agree that although tuners, amplifiers and
preamplifiers (components which make
up receivers) can be purchased separately,
85 percent of all consumers choose
receivers. Of those who don't, most seem
concerned with power output. Many
purchase separate amplifiers such as the
Yamaha B1 ($1850) with 150 watts per
