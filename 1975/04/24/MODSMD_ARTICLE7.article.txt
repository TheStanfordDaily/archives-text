# Jazz-the big beat outbounds bebop
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
"The situation for creative music
in this country is really kind of
inhuman. But there's one cat in
every city. One cat who's finding
something completely new, and
that's what keeps jazz alive."
—Anthony Braxton
"You hear the way that trumpeter
plays? He thinks he can get a
'jazz' feel by putting in a lip slur
or somethin'. Well, that ain't jazz.
That ain 't nothin'."
—Miles Davis
For about 20 years, bebop was
all there was to jazz. First bebop
itself, the glorious revolution
against the sterile businessman's
music of Benny Goodman and the
Dorseys. Bebop dominated the
'40s.
Then, in the early '50s, came
the thing known as cool jazz. It
wasn't really jazz at all, just a sort
of dull, languid feeling. The
logical extension of tne cool was
the dead. So bebop had to come
back.
The second coming of bebop:

hard-bop. It wasn't quite so good
the second time around: after all,
the idea of bebop as conceived by
Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie
and Charlie Christian and a few
others was already 15 years old.
Miles Davis
So no matter how good
Thelonius Monk and Max Roach
and especially a lean, young
trumpeter named Miles Davis and
his quintet got, there had to be a
new thing in jazz.
And Miles' band was the one to
watch. The tenor saxophonist, a
big, silent man from Philadelphia
named John Coltrane, was already
playing so brilliantly that he was
pushing Miles. And in Coltrane's
solo work there was a
premonition of something great to
come.
So Davis got together Coltrane
and alto saxophonist Cannonball
Adderley (the "new Bird," people
were calling him) and a young
three-man rhythm section. And
just before the end of the decade,
they made an album called Kind

of Blue, which was the first great
statement of modern jazz.
There were lots of new things
about Kind of Blue. Miles had
written songs based on modes,
borrowed perhaps from Oriental
music, rather than the "chord
changes" of popular songs and of
bebop anthems like "Cherokee."
Best of all, though, Blue was
centered around the art of the
improviser. The compositions
(simple and very beautiful)
formed only a skeleton: the
improvisations of Miles and
Coltrane, Cannonball and pianist

Bill Evans were the flesh and the
guts. And the immediate message
of the improviser has been the
guts of jazz ever since.
Two Waves
After Kind of Blue, the
development of modern jazz took
place in two waves: the first, in
the early and middle '60s led
by Coltrane, Ornette Coleman and
Cecil Taylor; the second
(embodying many musicians who
have little or nothing to do with
each other), whose most
outstanding leaders have been
Miles Davis (again) and his '60s

and '70s bands and the group of
Chicago natives who were once
the Association for the
Advancement of Creative Music
(AACM). Many of their
contributions can be heard on
records.
John Coltrane
When Coltrane died in 1967,
he left a large legacy of recorded
works, that show his development
as the strongest jazz voice of the
'60s. Constantly advancing and
always absorbing new influences,
Coltrane was never bound by
what other saxophonists had
done. He always strained to make
his instrument a more expressive
voice, not merely of musical
conventions but of his soul.
Fortunately, most of Trane's
recordings are still available. First
Trane developed his facility in the
tenor: this progression can be
heard from his early days with the
Miles Davis quintet through his
own Giant Steps, whose title piece
is one of the fastest and trickiest
mazes ever worked out for the
tenor sax.
Then Trane began a remarkable
series of developments. "My
Favorite Things," played on the
soprano saxophone (with McCoy
Tyner on piano), was based on
just three simple chords: the
brilliant solos were everything.
Africa/Brass, with a big band
led by saxophonist Eric Dolphy,
was Coltrane's excursion back to
the primitive sources of jazz. The
roaring and screaming of the
orchestra brought in a raw power
that no one else had dared to use
in jazz: that feeling was a part of
all of Trane's work after Africa.
Then there were A Love
Supreme, a spiritual composition;
Ascension, uncontrolled
improvisation by a large group of
musicians; and many other
recordings, among them Trane's
last, Interstellar Space. No one has
made a more moving saxophone
album than Space, in many ways
the fulfillment of Trane's quest to
broaden the scope of jazz.
Trane influenced others
profoundly. Among the musicians
