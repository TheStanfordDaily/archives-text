# Money: classical music's sour note
## ...at Stanford 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
The state of classical music
here is artistically vivace\ .. . but
financially, it's motto grave.
Although the music
department has never been
healthier as far as the quality of
work being done, the same cannot
be said for its financial status.
According to Mark Starr, asst.
professor of music and director of
orchestras here, there is a "high
level of activity" here. "The
students are very talented and
could walk into any important
professional position." One recent
Stanford graduate in his early 20s,
says Starr, is already a member of
the San Francisco Symphony.
Astounding Faculty Load
Not only are the students
active, but the faculty are even
more so. "The faculty work 25
hours a day,"says Starr. "They
perform all the time, and the
faculty load is astounding." Not
only do they teach, but some are
involved in performance groups,
research and "some do both," he
explained.
An outgrowth of this faculty
activity resulted in the formation
in 1965 of Stanford's highly
acclaimed trio-in-residence, The
Francesco Trio. Recently they
were awarded the coveted and
prestigious Naumburg Award.
The symphony and chamber
orchestras, says Starr, are also
very active, having given two
concerts each since fall quarter.
Starr is particularly excited
about the concerts coming up this
quarter, which will end the year
illustriously. On May 28-31 the
Stanford Opera Theater and the
chamber orchestra will combine
their talents to produce a double
bill of two comic operas: Rossini's
The Marriage Broker and
Poulenc's The Breasts of Teresias.
The symphony will collaborate
with the Chorus in Verdi's
Requiem this quarter, and, for the
first time, will collaborate in
music by Charles Ives and John
Cage with Alea 11, a campus group

devoted to the presentation of
new and unusual music.
Challenging Works
Because of the talent and
capabilities of the music students,
Starr feels that he is able to
conduct difficult and challenging
works such as these, that are often
reserved for the professionals.
But John Planting,
administrative services manager in
music, explains "Financially we're
in a state of limbo.
"It's the first year of cuts, but
we're not doing too badly," he
says. "Our future hangs on private
funding," he adds.
In efforts to economize, the
University has eliminated one
music theory teaching position,
which "will hurt the non-majors
next year," says Planting.
The University is looking for
$9 million to fund a
desperately-needed music
building.
"We've needed a new building
since the 19405," says Planting.
"We're the only major University

in the country without a music
building."
The music department is
presently housed in the Knoll,
formerly the president's home and
the department has long since
outgrown it.
For a while the Annex
(formerly an elementary school)
housed part of the department
but it was recently torn down.
That supplementary space was
replaced by trailers at the foot of
the Knoll. However the
department is in need of still more
space. But, as Planting points out,
the projected $9 million cost will
be hard to raise.
Phenomonal Increase
Another problem the
department has encountered is the
phenomenal increase of students,
compared with the relative
freeze in the number of faculty.
Faculty loads, already
overburdened, promise to become
heavier. (There are currently 215
music students, 13 full-time
