Classical music has lived for centuries. It has felt the ups and downs
of popularity with the whims of the times, and has often been at the
mercy of society's economics. And now even its validity is being
questioned; many wonder if it is an outdated form of art, to be
replaced by more "youthful" music.
But classical music at the community level won't go out of
business. Nelson Tandoc, music instructor at De Anza College in
Cupertino and conductor of the community and student oriented
Nova Vista Symphony, says that Nova Vista is having "no financial
problems other than those we face regardless of the times." But he
adds that Nova Vista is unique in that its budget is established through
De Anza, a state supported school.
In this sense, Tandoc feels that Nova Vista is at an advantage.
"There are no peripheral organizations, like a board of directors or
women's auxiliary, or other gimmicks needed to make money." The
purpose of Nova Vista is to teach music and to offer an opportunity
for local musicians and students to play together. Tandoc is pleased
that there is "no distracting knee-tapping."
Conservative Audiences
A problem that any community orchestra faces, says Tandoc, is
conservative audiences. Tandoc likes to experiment with new or
little-known works, both for the benefit of the musical education of
the student and the audience. But most audiences, he says, "would
rather come to hear old favorites, rather than the new music."
He adds that it places the conductor in a tough position.
"Contemporary composers want to be heard. In a professional
orchestra, the piayers will play anything when they're paid; with a
community orchestra, you have to convince them to play new stuff."
Tandoc feels that there is a lot of interest in community orchestras
in this area. "Here we have IBM, Lockheed and NASA, which bring
interesting people to the area" who either play or attend concerts. It
also brings a competition for better players, so that the Nova Vista has
been steadily improving.
High School "Ringers"
This has enabled Nova Vista to be self-sufficient as far as musicians
go. At concert time, most community orchestras have to import
"ringers" from local high schools or colleges to fill the gaps. Nova
Vista occasionally has to pay a harpist to come whenever a concert
calls for one, but otherwise the orchestra has all its places filled.
Tandoc feels that community orchestras not only fill an important
educational need for musicians, but also for fledgling conductors. "A
community orchestra is a good place for a conductor to get started,
but it's difficult to find an orchestra. If you want one, make your
own."
Community orchestras fill a real need in the community, not only
educationally but as a source of listening pleasure. Not everyone can
afford a San Francisco Symphony ticket, but most can afford an
evening at the Nova Vista Symphony.
San Francisco Symphony
But according to Stuart Canin, concertmaster of the San Francisco
Symphony, people are affording San Francisco tickets in droves.
"San Francisco Symphony ticket sales have been extraordinary,"
says Canin. He believes that "people have lost faith in TV" other than
the public stations, and have gone back to live entertainment. "We're
all benefiting," he says.
Many people have the idea that an established, professional
orchestra such as the San Francisco Symphony is full of older
musicians, and that it is impossible to start at the top. But Canin says
that, especially for young string players, "the world is their oyster.
String players are as scarce as hen's teeth." He adds that there are
"many vacancies around the country; many ads for strings."
For wind players it's tougher, as there are fewer positions in any
orchestra for winds.
According to Canin, there are many young musicians in the
orchestra, and it's a lucrative business for anyone good enough to
make it. The starting salary is nearly $17,000.
The Symphony has long been interested in presenting the works of
modern composers, as are most professional orchestras. But Canin
says that this is a source of friction because some want to play
American works, others want to play non-American.
"We could take the parochial view and just play American, or
all-mankind. We are constantly looking for new music, for good
scores. But one man's meat is another man's poison."
"Tyrant Conductors"
But, he adds, the players do have some say in what they would like
to play, as "the days of tyrant conductors are over."
Canin believes that most players are happy with conductor Seiji
Ozawa, and obviously audiences are happy too. "We have full houses,
recording contracts and international tours. We also present free
concerts to every neighborhood church and high school, which bring
large audiences."
It is hard to say that the symphony orchestra, as an art form, is
dying. "Here it is flourishing, says Canin. "We'll play 'till they stay
away."
