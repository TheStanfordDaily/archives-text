# Left A Bad Taste
## 
### 
The efforts of the ASSU
Senate and Tom Fitzgerald,
elections commissioner, to purge
Stanford politics of its undesirable
and unethical qualities are
commendable. Nevertheless their
efforts are too little and too late.
Stanford politics has not been
spared the effects of recent trends
in political campaigning — illicit
spending, zealous advertising,
machine tactics and dirty tricks.
The recent senior class elections
offer a case in point.
Two slates, whether they knew
it or not, exceeded the $50 limit
established by the constitution
and sanctioned by precedent.
According to two impeccable
sources, two candidates for the
office of ASSU Council of
Presidents bestowed their
patronage upon and actively
promoted the candidacy of two
senior class slates.
Invalid Vote
The tearing down of posters
and platform statements was
widespread. These actions
prompted Fitzgerald and the
ASSU Senate to completely
invalidate the results of the first
election.
Initially, we entered the race
with a firm conviction that we
presented the proper attitude
towards the office. We were
confident that we could perform
the required duties. We conducted
a campaign which adhered to the
letter and spirit of the
constitution and by-laws of the
ASSU.
We blame no one for the
outcome of this election. Given
the temper and tone of this
campaign, however, we could not
possibly enter the senate's
proposed election. We therefore
notified Fitzgerald that we would
neither include nor allow our

et 01.

names on the ballot for the senior
class election.
We are not ashamed, rather we
are proud, of our effort. We thank
those who campaigned vigorously
in our behalf and those who gave
us their support on election day.
Perhaps we are idealistic, or
maybe even naive, but we remain
dedicated to the belief that
politics must be honest and
unblemished by the very activities
which ruined this campaign. We
do not abandon our aspirations
for senior class office easily or
lightheartedly. We truly desired
the opportunity to serve our class.
But we realize that our view of
senior class politics put us at a
severe disadvantage in this
particular election. Though we did
not and probably would not have
won the game, we played by the
rules of honest politics.

proposed election. We therefore
notified Fitzgerald that we would
neither include nor allow our

names on the ballot for the senior
class election.
We are not ashamed, rather we
are proud, of our effort. We thank
those who campaigned vigorously
in our behalf and those who gave
us their support on election day.
Perhaps we are idealistic, or
maybe even naive, but we remain
dedicated to the belief that
politics must be honest and
unblemished by the very activities
which ruined this campaign. We
do not abandon our aspirations
for senior class office easily or
lightheartedly. We truly desired
the opportunity to serve our class.
But we realize that our view of
senior class politics put us at a
severe disadvantage in this
particular election. Though we did
not and probably would not have
won the game, we played by the
rules of honest politics.
(Leo Salazar, Stephanie Jubina,
Dave Baker and Chris Liu
withdrew from senior class officer
elections this week.)
