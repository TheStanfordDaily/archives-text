# Brazilian Junta Oppresses Masses
## 
### Susan Luttner 
Since the military coup in 1964, Brazil has
become a model of political and economic
repression, institutionalizing ideals that are
incompatible with democracy and freedom.
The military has elected every president
since 1964, and the government screens
candidates for office in virtually every
political party, labor union or student group.
"Act Number Five," passed in 1968, usurped
the power of the elected congress and gave
the military leaders the right to deny any
citizen political rights.
Academic freedom in Brazil met its end in
"Decree 477," which imposed expulsion, loss
of job, or arrest on any student or faculty
member who "produces, prints, possesses or
distributes subversive material of any
nature."
Newspapers are allowed to operate only
with careful censorship, under a law so
ambiguous that almost anything can be
punished as subversive to the country's
stability, world image or moral values.
Newspapers which do not practice
self-censorship find a government censor in
the office or padlocks on the doors.
Enthusiastic Enforcing
And the police and military enforce these
laws with efficiency and enthusiasm.
Amnesty International estimates that the
police have killed 1500 political activists —
often by torture — without even holding
trial. Thousands more have been jailed and
held without knowing if or when they will be
released.
The Brazilian Information Bulletin,
published outside of the country since 1971,
has been reporting tortures and illegal arrests,
news which is almost totally suppressed in
Brazil.
Given the ideals of democracy and
freedom in the United States, one would

expect it to oppose the military rule in
Brazil. But instead, the United States has
contributed $2 billion in economic aid since
the coup.

One of the major United States projects in
Brazil has been the Agency for International
Development (AID) Public Safety Program.
This project translates into modernizing the
police intelligence systems, riot control and
counter-insurgency techniques. Thousands of
Brazilian policemen and soldiers have been
trained in the International Police Academy
in Washington, and, at least until 1973, the
United States had hundreds of military
advisers working with Brazilian police.
No Judgment
At Senate hearings in 1971, AID Public
Safety Adviser Theodore Brown defended
United States police assistance, saying that
the police academy trained the Brazilian
police to use "restraint and humane
methods." When questioned about reports of
torture, he said it was not his place to pass
judgment on the Brazilian government or
police department.
In the same hearing, William Ellis, director
of AID in Brazil, explained that United
States presence in Brazil is important for
security and"the protection and expansion,
if possible, of our economic interests, trade
and investment, in the hemisphere."

These economic interests have dictated
many United States policies in Brazil. Before
the junta, the United States was wary of the
leftist government, and aid programs were
specifically directed to the more conservative
leaders, according to a 1971 Washington Post
report. Private investment slowed down,
because of fears that Brazil would begin to
nationalize industries.
Capital Mecca
But since the military takeover, United
States businessmen have flocked to invest in
Brazil, "the mecca of international capital."
A 1973 Department of Commerce advisory
report encouraged businessmen to investigate
Brazilian opportunities, pointing out the
growing economy and friendly government.
The Department of Commerce listed low
wages and tax benefits as important
advantages (according to the Brazilian
Information Bulletin, labor costs represent
eight to 20 percent of manufacturing costs in
Brazil,2o to 40 percent in the United States).
Other advantages not listed by the
Department of Commerce include strict wage
controls, the outlawing of strikes, careful
government control over labor unions and an
agreement between the United States and
Brazil which insures investments.
Perhaps John Foster Dulles explained the
United Role in Brazil quite succinctly when
he said, "The United States does not have
friends; it has interests."
The United States has certainly not been a
friend of the Brazilian people, although it has
looked out for its economic interests by
aiding the repressive military regime still in
power.
