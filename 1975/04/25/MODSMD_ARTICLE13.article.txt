'Unreasonable' Cut
Editor:
We are writing to protest the
extremely unreasonable cut by
the ASSU Senate in allocation to
the International Association
(IA). This group, although
inactive in the past two years, has
undergone revitalization with
much student input and effort
this year.
The IA has been reorganized
and is on the verge of embarking
on its various planned activities
structured to cater to the entire
Stanford community: foreign and
American, graduate and
undergraduate.
As we are the only group to
cater to foreign student interests
as a whole as well as to show any
interest in internationalism, is not
the ASSU overlooking a rather
deficient area in the Stanford
community? Having always(?)
dealt with parochial issues, is
anything on a global scale beyond
its mental capabilities?
The allocation of $80 has
astounded us. It is beyond us how
we could effectively run an
organization with this sum for an
entire year. Perhaps the ASSU
Senate could advise us on this
question.

More On Charters
Editor:
To those Daily readers who
actually believe that Don
Brunsten's attack on Pan
American Airlines as an enemy of
charter flight travelers (Daily,
April 4) makes some sense, I
would like to offer one significant
correction.
Elimination of affinity group
charters will not deny reduced
fare air travel to members of the
Stanford community or anyone
else. Pan Am, as the world's
largest charter airline, would
certainly not desire that.
Uncontested plans such as
Travel Group Charter and Apex
offer non-discriminatory fares as
low or lower than that obtainable
by affinity groups.
There are numerous other
inaccuracies in Brunsten's
misinformed condemnation of
Pan Am and its campaign to
establish equity in what is now an
inequitable industry.
Brunsten and others are
advised to do further research
before criticizing these efforts.
