# If Wallace 'Contributes To Education,' Then I'm A...

Partially hidden away on page
four of the April 21 San Francisco
Chronicle was a short article
telling how George Wallace will
soon be presented the "President's
Medal" of St. John's College High
School in Washington, D.C. The
medal is to be awarded to Wallace
by the Christian Brothers
operated Catholic prep school for
his "contribution to education."
I would like to think the whole
idea was a little joke, some
religious tongue-in-cheek, but I
don't think anyone at the

ceremony will be laughing. No, it
is so inane as to be actually
serious.
Yes, George Wallace is going to
receive a medal for his
"contribution to education."
And, yes, it is the same George
Wallace who 12 years ago stood in
the doorway of the University of
Alabama declaring something of
the sort that the school would
admit a black student only over
his dead body.
And, yes, it is the same George
Wallace who, when he took the

governor's office of Alabama,
found that the state ranked 48th
in expenditure per child on
education. It now ranks 50th.
And, yes, even more
remarkable, it is the same George
Wallace who, in a recent Gallup
poll, led the field of Democratic
presidential hopefuls.
Absurd
I suppose we could simply take
this chest pinning as another sign
of the absurdity of politics — yet
isn't there something here we
should stop to reflect on? I mean

the medal isn't being awarded by
the Greater Birmingham Lester
Maddox Fan Club but by an
organization of the Catholic
Church — no less than a school
claiming to prepare its students
for college.
One could still figure "so
what?" with a shrug of the
shoulders. After all, didn't the
Pope sign a concordat with Hitler?
And how many of those high
school kids remember Wallace at
the University of Alabama door
anyway?
But wait, shouldn't we
remember these things and remind
those who have forgotten them?
Not so much remembering with a
vengeance but rather with a
concern for keeping things
straight. We seem to have the
harmless event of a medal
presentation by a Catholic high
school — yet is it so innocuous?
Harmful Effect
I personally must answer
emphatically no — it is not so
harmless. In point, it is dangerous,
for it is a step, albeit a small one
(but nonetheless a step), toward
justifying a personality which
should certainly have lost all
validity; a step toward
legitimizing a potential authority
which surely should have lost all
respect by now.
The whole affair is like giving
Richard Nixon a medal for honest
government (which I have no
doubt will probably happen
within the next decade).
Perhaps we may ask just what
is the problem with these folks,
these Christian Brothers. As best I
can tell they seem to have trouble
remembering, or a case of
selective forgetting.
Collective Amnesia
Can one blame them? Watching
Gerald Ford talk about the
domino theory or listening to

Henry Kissinger pronounce South
Vietnam as vital to our national
security, we might begin to think
the whole of Washington was
suffering from a collective
amnesia.
Well, let me add my humble
two cents. It amounts to a request
for good remembering, especially
of bad memories, and an appeal to
help those who seem to be having
trouble doing so. I wonder how
many people reading Pat
Buchanan's newspaper column
remember who he was and what
he used to do.
I wonder how many students
at the University of Texas

Curt Chumbley

listening to Walt Rostow tell them
about economics and history
remember who he was and what
he used to do. I wonder how
many Stanford seniors will
remember the idea of "benign
neglect" as they sit through their
graduation ceremony.
I won't bore you readers with
the media's newly resurrected old
quote of Santayana's, but I can't
resist quoting Faulkner from The
Sound and the Fury: "they
cannot even remember tomorrow
what seemed dreadful today and I
said, You can shirk all things and
he said, Ah can you."

majoring in philosophy.)
