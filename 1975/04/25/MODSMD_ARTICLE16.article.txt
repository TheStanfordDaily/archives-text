# Course Review' Editors Inaccurate
## 
### 
As the editors of the Course Review
pointed oqt in the April 18 Daily, it is indeed
unfortunate that they would drag out an
ASSU project into the political arena.
However, as members of the ASSU Senate
and of the Course Review Policy Board, we
believe there are some inaccuracies and
misconceptions which should be corrected.
Although the Course Review has never
been given money in the past from either the
Senate or from a fee assessment, the editors
requested $1500 from next year's fee
assessment. The Senate rejected the
allocation because an allotment that size
would have reduced the other allocations by
almost 10 percent and because of the
opportunity of obtaining money from other
sources, such as the Publications Board.
We felt that if the Course Review is a
student service which is subsidized by the
students, it should have far greater coverage
and availability; if it is a student project, then
it should concentrate on selling advertising so
it will at least break even. In either case, the
Course Review as it now exists does not do
either.
Fiscal Details
For these reasons, the Senate requested
the Course Review editors to return to the
Senate within a few weeks with a budget

detailing the exact amount of money needed,
how it was going to be spent, and suggestions
for reform. At no time were we told that this
rejection from next year's fee assessment
would have any bearing at all on this year's
Course Review; even now the editors have
not presented a budget or financial statement
to prove this is the case.
Quite the opposite, the Senate was willing
to grant as much as $4000 to an expanded
and improved plan for next year's Course
Review. A vote for the $1500, then, as
Senator Kevin McDermott had voted, was
not to "save" the Course Review but rather
to reject the possibility of this improved
Review in favor of the present one.
If the Course Review could not be
published this year without additional funds,
we on the Policy Board were never made
aware of it. Ann Carter, chairperson of the
Board, has stated that this year's salaries
could be paid from revenue generated by
advertising, and Asst. Dean of Students Dale
Snape has already promised to guarantee a
loan if debts have been incurred.
'Unsupportive'
We have supported the Course Review as
best we could with time and effort, but
obviously the editors took our desire for
improvement as "unsupportive" and resigned

Harris, et al.

as an act of protest.
The Course Review will most certainly not
die because of the Senate action. If we had
been trying to "kill" the Course Review, we
would not now be volunteering our time for
a Senate Commission which is already
investigating how the Course Review can be
improved and better serve the needs of the
students.
We have already decided to defer
publication from spring to Sept. 1 when the
Course Review will be most useful and
relevant. This fall Review, then, will be able
to incorporate many of the changes we feel
to be so important, such as covering
graduate-level courses.
Although we tried to develop many of
these ideas while on the Course Review
Policy Board, we were told that we were
unrealistic, naive and unaware of financial
constraints. Now as part of the Commission,
we can work towards turning those
"unrealistic" ideas into a better Course
Review.
Does that "not serve the best interests of
the students?" Choose for yourself.

believe there are some inaccuracies and
misconceptions which should be corrected.
Although the Course Review has never
been given money in the past from either the
Senate or from a fee assessment, the editors
requested $1500 from next year's fee
assessment. The Senate rejected the
allocation because an allotment that size
would have reduced the other allocations by
almost 10 percent and because of the
opportunity of obtaining money from other
sources, such as the Publications Board.
We felt that if the Course Review is a
student service which is subsidized by the
students, it should have far greater coverage
and availability; if it is a student project, then
it should concentrate on selling advertising so
it will at least break even. In either case, the
Course Review as it now exists does not do
either.
Fiscal Details
For these reasons, the Senate requested
the Course Review editors to return to the
Senate within a few weeks with a budget

detailing the exact amount of money needed,
how it was going to be spent, and suggestions
for reform. At no time were we told that this
rejection from next year's fee assessment
would have any bearing at all on this year's
Course Review; even now the editors have
not presented a budget or financial statement
to prove this is the case.
Quite the opposite, the Senate was willing
to grant as much as $4000 to an expanded
and improved plan for next year's Course
Review. A vote for the $1500, then, as
Senator Kevin McDermott had voted, was
not to "save" the Course Review but rather
to reject the possibility of this improved
Review in favor of the present one.
If the Course Review could not be
published this year without additional funds,
we on the Policy Board were never made
aware of it. Ann Carter, chairperson of the
Board, has stated that this year's salaries
could be paid from revenue generated by
advertising, and Asst. Dean of Students Dale
Snape has already promised to guarantee a
loan if debts have been incurred.
'Unsupportive'
We have supported the Course Review as
best we could with time and effort, but
obviously the editors took our desire for
improvement as "unsupportive" and resigned

Harris, et al.

as an act of protest.
The Course Review will most certainly not
die because of the Senate action. If we had
been trying to "kill" the Course Review, we
would not now be volunteering our time for
a Senate Commission which is already
investigating how the Course Review can be
improved and better serve the needs of the
students.
We have already decided to defer
publication from spring to Sept. 1 when the
Course Review will be most useful and
relevant. This fall Review, then, will be able
to incorporate many of the changes we feel
to be so important, such as covering
graduate-level courses.
Although we tried to develop many of
these ideas while on the Course Review
Policy Board, we were told that we were
unrealistic, naive and unaware of financial
constraints. Now as part of the Commission,
we can work towards turning those
"unrealistic" ideas into a better Course
Review.
Does that "not serve the best interests of
the students?" Choose for yourself.

Debbi Silton are members of the Course
Review Policy Board and of the ASSU
Senate.)
As the editors of the Course Review
pointed oqt in the April 18 Daily, it is indeed
unfortunate that they would drag out an
ASSU project into the political arena.
