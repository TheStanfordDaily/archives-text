# Freshmen Draw Bugs In Guaranteed Housing Goof
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The Guaranteed Housing Program (GHP),
instituted for this year's freshman class, has
provoked much comment — some favorable
and some not so favorable.
The GHP allows this year's freshmen to
choose which two of the next three years they
wish to live on campus, replacing last year's
system of placing students entirely through
the luck of the draw.
But the plan got off to a late start.
Developed by the Committee on Student
Services (COSS) subcommittee on housing,
the GHP was not approved until the March 11
meeting of the Board of Trustees.
The Housing Office had to wait to
implement the plan until it received the
go-ahead from the trustees, said Assoc.
Dean of Students for Housing Larry Horton.
Sorting Scramble
It was because of this late approval that
Richard Wales, the senior who processed the
guaranteed housing cards, was forced to
quickly develop a method of apportioning
guarantees. But he didn't have sufficient time
to write a computer program.
As a consequence, Wales had to process the
cards manually. The result was a clerical error
— an error which has caused many freshmen
considerable anguish.

"Had we had time we would have written a
program," states Wales.
"Next year this should not happen," he
emphasized. "I can say with 99 percent
certainty that the same thing will not occur."
Trio Of Gripes
Criticism of the GHP has been voiced on
three grounds. The first, naturally, concerns
the error made in the apportionment of
housing guarantees. Although it appears that
the Housing Office finally has corrected its
mistake, 137 students have spent a great deal
of time — time they undoubtedly could have
put to better use — trying to acquire
different guarantees for next year.
The second major complaint concerns the
time sequence of the guarantee program.
It is felt by some that the Housing Office
should have completed the GHP much earlier,
so that those who chose to live off campus
could skip on-campus open houses.
The final figures show that 279 students
who expected a sophomore guarantee (from a
total of 1491 participants in the GHP) weren't
able to receive one.
Guarantee Traffic
The third source of discontent is the
developing "black market" in guarantee years.
Some students reportedly are selling their
guarantees for $40 to $100.

Such action raises the ethical question of
whether it is fair to allow one to profit
monetarily from luck.
However, as Horton pointed out,
"Occasionally, human endeavors are going to
involve some mistakes. We expected some
problems, but so far they have been quite
slight.
"Anyway, we never have enough time to
implement things here," he said. "It's a
miracle we haven't had a mistake before."
Success Percentage
He noted that 92 percent of all this year's
guarantee requests were processed correctly.
Most students seem to think that the GHP
does represent an improvement, although
some feel that the system wilj not last very
long. This prediction may be a partial
explanation of why 94 percent of this year's
freshmen applied to I've on campus next year.
The revised computer program for the
draw program remains to be tested. In theory,
this program appears quite sound.
Explained Wales, "I have complete faith in
the draw program because it has been tested
five times successfully. It is thoroughly
self-checking and the results so far have
always been correct."
Further evidence that no error will occur,
stated Wales, is the fact that the new program
actually is comprised of the former program's
core.
