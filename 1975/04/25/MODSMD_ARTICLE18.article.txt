# New Jersey Legislators Vs. Franklin; Mashing The Academic Hot Potato
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Although most educators long ago ceased
to regard H. Bruce Franklin as a pariah, he
still seems to frighten public officials.
F'ranklin, fired from Stanford in 1972 for
allegedly inciting students to violence, was
appointed earlier this month to the English
Department at Rutgers, New Jersey's state
university. But Franklin was later blasted in
the New Jersey State Senate by several
legislators who claimed that Franklin shouid
be excluded from Rutgers solely because he
professes Marxist-Leninist political views.
The New Jersey controversy somewhat
resembles the dispute that occurred in
Colorado last spring when Franklin was givÂ»u
a job at the University of Colorado.
Even though the University of Colorado's
English Department voted unanimously to
hire Franklin, the Colorado Board of Regents
rejected his appointment in an 8-1 vote. The
regents frankly admitted their political biases
against Franklin.
Big Differences
But Franklin's troubles in New Jersey this
year don't seem as serious as were his troubles
in Colorado.
First, the New Jersey legislature has no
direct control over appointments to Rutgers.
The Colorado Board of Regents has the power
to reject any appointment made to the
University of Colorado.

Second, while the New Jersey legislators
have the power to cut off funds to Rutgers if
the university refuses to revoke its
appointment of Franklin, it seems likely that
few legislators would be willing to impose
such a harsh sanction.
However much Franklin's three-year
appointment may irk New Jersey lawmakers,
it is doubtful if they would be willing to
cripple their state university over the issue.
Deep-Seated Convictions
Furthermore, opposition to Franklin seems
more deep than broad.
Alfred Beadleston, the Republican Senate
leader, declared that "Franklin should be in
jail rather than being given a teaching
position." But there is no evidence that many
other legislators are so vehemently opposed to
the appointment.
Anthony Imperiale, a Democratic senator
from Newark may carry through on his threat
to "lead the biggest demonstration against
that school [Rutgers] or the state has ever
seen," but such a protest seems unlikely to
impress the firm resolve of Rutgers
administrators to hire Franklin.
When the legislators began lo hurl threats,
Rutgers officials issued a statement defending
Franklin's appointment and insisting they
would never revoke it.
"No university worthy of the name can set
tests of political orthodoxy as a requisite for

faculty appointment," the administration
declared.
Victories, Defeats
The willingness of administrators and
faculty at the University of Colorado and
Rutgers to welcome Franklin parallels
Franklin's reception at Yale and Wesleyan,
where he is currently teaching as a visiting
professor.
Because Yale and Wesleyan are private
schools, there was no public furor over
Franklin's appointment.
Franklin's ability to receive appointments
to Yale and Wesleyan came after his failure to
obtain a teaching job during the first two and
one-half years after his dismissal from
Stanford.
During that time, Franklin wrote letters to
hundreds of schools throughout the nation
and failed to get a job even though he was
recognized as a leading Melville scholar.
Administrators apparently feared that
Franklin would stir political trouble if
appointed.
But despite Franklin's renewed
respectability among educators, it is
significant that no university has yet offered
him a tenured position. The appointment to
Rutgers is for a three-year term.
Considering Franklin's sudden return from
academic oblivion, tenure may be just around
an eventual corner.
