## Grades: Up, Down, Confused 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
One way to "whip inflation now,"
economists tell us, is certainly not to print
more paper money. But that analogy
apparently does not extend to what has come
to be called "grade inflation." The Committee
on Academic Achievement and Appraisal
(C-AAA) and the Faculty Senate, at least,
seem to believe one solution is to add more
grades.
Next year, Stanford undergraduates, for
the first time in their collegiate careers, will
face the possibility of receiving D's on their
transcripts. Members of the C-AAA and the

Senate hope this will bring grades down —
somewhat.
Of course, when the Study of Education at
Stanford recommended the initial elimination
of D's and F's, those grades comprised only
four percent of all grades given. Hence the
statistical effect can be expected to be
moderate, at best.
Still, the Senate probably felt it had to do
something. After all, the nation's colleges are
(to borrow again from the economists) in the
grip of an ever-deepening period of grade
inflation.
Nationwide Rise
The Chronicle of Higher Education
reported late last year tnat the average letter
grade has increased an average of .404 (on a
scale of 4.0), or half a letter grade, across the
country in the last 14 years. At many rather
prestigious schools — Dartmouth, Amherst
and Vassar, for example — A's and B's now
comprise well over 80 percent of all grades
given.
Stanford entered the frenzy with a
flourish, when Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron
told a shocked Faculty Senate last autumn

that the "average grade index" of
undergraduates here had reached 3.55. The
admittedly rough estimate created a furor
among academicians, who warned that the
University's prestige would suffer.
When national news magazines began
reporting the figure, officialdom had to act.
Even as students prepared to vote in a
referendum on what turned out to be
comparatively minor changes contemplated in
the grading system, the C-AAA recommended
reinstating the D.
A Bold Step?
Now here was positive action! It's sort of
like wage-price controls: no one believes it
will do any good, but it certainly sounds
impressive.
Meanwhile, back on The Farm, a more
detailed report from the Registrar's Office
indicated that the average grade average here
was not 3.55 at all, but "only" 3.41.
Of course, 3.41 was still high enough to
worry people, especially when it had been
3.19 just five years before. Few people
seemed to notice that the disappearance of
D's and F's could account for almost the
entire five-year difference.
So rather than waiting for the Faculty
Senate to act, many instructors decided to
"whip inflation now." Thus, in winter quarter
of 1974, some 42 percent of grades given in
Humanities and Sciences were A's; last quarter
the proportion fell to 36 percent. Drops were
somewhat less pronounced, but nevertheless
evident, in the schools of Engineering and
Earth Sciences, where the figures were 39 and
36, and 42 and 39, respectively.
Going, Going ...
Where did all the grades go? Certainly not
into the Band C categories, which together
fell a single percentage point. Nor into the
"Pass" category, which climbed a single point.
The only marked increase came in the
"Incomplete/No Credit" area — in other
words, more students are flunking or taking
incompletes than before.
What this seems to indicate, oddly enough,
is that the grading system apparently needs
what many economists emphatically claim the
economy does not — a period of laissez-faire.
On their own, professors have found a
rather obvious solution to the inflation: give
lower grades.
A post-script: another "new survey," just
released, indicated the GPA is "only" 3.31.
It's still just as confusing as economics.
