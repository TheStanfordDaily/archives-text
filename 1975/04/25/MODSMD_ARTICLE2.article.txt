# Attorney General Restricts State Money
## Med School Could Lose Grant 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
State officials believe that an
opinion of the California attorney
general's office which denied state
scholarship funding to the Loma Linda
University Medical School might affect
the Stanford Medical School.
The attorney general's opinion
cited a section of the state
Constitution which reads, "No public
money shall ever be appropriated for
the support of any sectarian or
denominational school, or any school
not under the exclusive control of the
officers of the public schools."
Two University officials, however,
say the decision probably will not have
any bearing on the Medical School
here.
The opinion, which the Associated
Press (AP) reported yesterday could
cost Loma Linda $983,000 from a
special state scholarship fund, was
based on the school's "religious
affiliation" with the Seventh Day
Adventist Church, according to Legal
Counsel for Medical Affairs John
Schwartz.
Stanford and the University of
Southern California (USC) both are
part of a three-year-old State
Scholarship program that provides
private institutions up to $12,000 per
year for each medical student above
the school's 1971-72 enrollment level
whom the university contracts to add
to its roles.
Although the AP quoted Dep. Atty.
Gen. Wiley Manuel as saying "it would
not be unreasonable" to conclude that
the opinion could be extended to
Stanford and USC, Medical Center
Information officer Spyros
Andreopoulos said, "I believe this
particular clause of the Constitution
[Article 9, Section 8] had been
applied only to schools with religious
affiliation."
Stanford's Grant
Arthur Marmaduke, director of the
State Scholarship program, said

Stanford has received over $600,000
of the special funding so far and is in
line for another $1.43 million in the
next three years.
Andreopoulos, however, claimed
that "the Medical School received
about $120,000 this year. We received
less than that in the preceding fiscal
year and we expect to receive the same
amount next year."
Schwartz also challenged
Marmaduke's figures, stating, "The
Medical School receives about
$200,000 per year. We expect to
receive under $500,000 in the next
three years."
Schwartz added that "the amount

of the state subsidy is reduced by the
amount of various federal subsidies, so
the net amount received is smaller
than that supposed to be given."
Marmaduke estimated that USC has
received $1.5 million under the
program and should get an additional
$3.3 million by mid-1978, when the
subsidy is scheduled to expire.
Schwartz cautioned that even had
the attorney general's opinion been
expanded to include Stanford, it "is
only an interpretation and it's not
necessarily correct." He said the
University "would have to see what
the consequences of it are and the
basis for the ruling" before considering
a legal challenge to it.
