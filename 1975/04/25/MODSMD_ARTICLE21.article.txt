# Educators Examine Investors' Decisions

### MICHAEL MARK 
"Despite the fact that each
individual makes hundreds of
decisions every day, there is
virtually no place in our
educational system where
decision-making is actively
taught," said Barbara Varenhorst,
a local educator, Monday.
Varenhorst, and Jon Krass, a
stockbroker, agreed that persons
are often inadequately or
inaccurately informed about both
personal and investment decisions.
Speaking to nearly 150 persons
at Tresidder, both Krass and
Varenhorst stressed the
importance of values clarification
as an aid in decision-making.
The meeting was the first in a
series of public workshops on
financial planning, and focused on
the subject "Money and Personal
Values."
Varenhorst, a consulting
psychologist for the Palo Alto
Unified School District, noted the
discrepancy between what people

say and what they do, claiming
this difference may result from
uncertain values.

"People are sometimes
ashamed to admit that they value
money," she added. In her
Undergraduate Special on
decision-making, Varenhorst say?
she encouraged students to arm
themselves with unbiased and
adequate information, to
recognize possible alternatives and
to structure their decisions on the
basis of the desired outcome. In
her courses, she said she attempts
to help students arrive at some
sort of a structured ranking of
their values.
Krass, an assistant vice
president at E.F. Mutton & Co.,
also noted the difficulty of
obtaining unbiased information
which could be useful to
investors.
While offering no
get-rich-quick schemes, he advised
nevertheless that each individual
should clarify his or her own
personal financial goals, both
present and future.
He noted the difference
between providing lor one's
family and "... being the richest
man in the cemetery."
A teacher of Undergraduat'
Special courses at Stanford for the
past six years, Krass tori 1 a five
dollar bill to illustrate the
changing image of the dollar, once
considered by many to be the
center of the economic universe.
