# Murder, Theft, Protest
## Dean Probes Church Reputation 
### JACQUELINE M. HONORE 
Despite a murder, a theft and a
protest, all within his last two
years at Memorial Church, Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the
chapel, still maintains that the
church's reputation has not been
damaged.
"The reputation of a church
like this is something that is
formed over a period of time and
even dreadful things like the
murder, I think, fit into a larger
pattern," Hamerton-Kelly says.
He stresses that one must look
at his two-year stay at the church
in its entirety to "see how the
church appears.
"I hope it appears in relatively
good repute," Hamerton-Kelly
chuckles.
Odds are, however,
catastrophes like last October's
brutal killing in the church of
Arlis Perry, wife of a student here,
will remain a memorable part of
the church's history for a long
time.
In addition, people likely will
remember the shocking theft of a
$12,000 gold cross from the
church just two months ago.
"It's a little embarrassing to
realize that I had that much
money standing around," says
Hamerton-Kelly.
Naive
A naive statement? Perhaps.
But Hamerton-Kelly says there
was no way for the church staff to
have anticipated the murder or
the theft. "All of us had thought
that the most threatening times
had passed. We thought that
everything had become
quieter. .. . There is nothing we
could be blamed for except that
we were not more careful.
"Before those things [the
murder and the theft] happened,

I would have judged the security
to be adequate," he says, but
now, of course, he's changed his
mind.
To improve security, the
church now closes when the last
staff member leaves the church,
Hamerton-Kelly notes. The
church used to be open all night.
In addition, this summer the
church will close regularly at 9
p.m., he says.
Learning Through The Years
And as Hamerton-Kelly has
learned the importance of church
security from the murder and the
theft, so he has learned other
things from other events.
For example, two years ago the
Daily revealed that
Hamerton-Kelly was thinking of
refusing to allow Black Muslim

minister John Muhammad to
speak in the church.
Hamerton-Kelly said that he
wished to discuss the Black
Muslim religion — particularly
what he called its "racist aspect"
— with the promoters of the
Muhammad appearance.
Because of this
Hamerton-Kelly disclosure, Black
Student Union members
demonstrated at the church, and
Muhammad supporters said that
Muhammad no longer wished to
appear.
Later, Hamerton-Kelly said, "I
sincerely regret that my questions
about Black Muslims became
public."
The 36-year-old South
African-born dean added that it
was "very painful to find myself

in this position . . . appearing as
an opponent of blacks ... I'm
deeply attached to Africa and
Africans. I feel at home with
them."
Now, Hamerton-Kelly says that
if Muhammad were to put in a
new bid to speak, "I would make
him part of the program of
Memorial Church. The reason for
that is that I now understand
much better than I did then what
the nature of this church is and
what the nature pf this
community is."
And just as Hamerton-Kelly
has learned from his experiences
here, so he has been saddened.
While he says that there has been
no noticeable decline in church
attendance since the Perry
murder, he admits that "vast
hoards of students have not
flocked to the church."
He says he's not too surprised
at the lack of student churchgoers
"given the nature of the
University as a secular institution
and given the secularism of most
of its members." He thinks of
himself as being engaged in a
"tough reality.
"I guess what we lack in
quantity, I'd like to believe we
make up in quality," he says.
Despite all the "tough" events
he has to deal with at Stanford,
Hamerton-Kelly continues to say,
"We're surely not turning the
world upside down, but at least
what I hope is that people regard
it as a solid honest enterprise."
A Methodist, a trinitarian and
an admirer of the Protestant
theologian, Karl Barth,
Hamerton-Kelly calls his theology
"reasonably orthodox," and adds,
"I don't feel free to change the
religion, to make it up as I go
along."

much better than I did then what
the nature of this church is and
what the nature pf this
community is."
And just as Hamerton-Kelly
has learned from his experiences
here, so he has been saddened.
While he says that there has been
no noticeable decline in church
attendance since the Perry
murder, he admits that "vast
hoards of students have not
flocked to the church."
He says he's not too surprised
at the lack of student churchgoers
"given the nature of the
University as a secular institution
and given the secularism of most
of its members." He thinks of
himself as being engaged in a
"tough reality.
"I guess what we lack in
quantity, I'd like to believe we
make up in quality," he says.
Despite all the "tough" events
he has to deal with at Stanford,
Hamerton-Kelly continues to say,
"We're surely not turning the
world upside down, but at least
what I hope is that people regard
it as a solid honest enterprise."
A Methodist, a trinitarian and
an admirer of the Protestant
theologian, Karl Barth,
Hamerton-Kelly calls his theology
"reasonably orthodox," and adds,
"I don't feel free to change the
religion, to make it up as I go
along."

PREACHER FEATURE — Today's feature is about Chapel Dean
Robert Hamerton-Kelly, a man who has had to deal with many
extraordinary events during his two years at Stanford.
Despite a murder, a theft and a
protest, all within his last two
years at Memorial Church, Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the
chapel, still maintains that the
church's reputation has not been
damaged.
"The reputation of a church
like this is something that is
formed over a period of time and
even dreadful things like the
murder, I think, fit into a larger
pattern," Hamerton-Kelly says.
He stresses that one must look
at his two-year stay at the church
in its entirety to "see how the
church appears.
"I hope it appears in relatively
good repute," Hamerton-Kelly
chuckles.
Odds are, however,
catastrophes like last October's
brutal killing in the church of
Arlis Perry, wife of a student here,
will remain a memorable part of
the church's history for a long
time.
In addition, people likely will
remember the shocking theft of a
$12,000 gold cross from the
church just two months ago.
"It's a little embarrassing to
realize that I had that much
money standing around," says
Hamerton-Kelly.
Naive
A naive statement? Perhaps.
But Hamerton-Kelly says there
was no way for the church staff to
have anticipated the murder or
the theft. "All of us had thought
that the most threatening times
had passed. We thought that
everything had become
quieter. .. . There is nothing we
could be blamed for except that
we were not more careful.
"Before those things [the
murder and the theft] happened,

I would have judged the security
to be adequate," he says, but
now, of course, he's changed his
mind.
To improve security, the
church now closes when the last
staff member leaves the church,
Hamerton-Kelly notes. The
church used to be open all night.
In addition, this summer the
church will close regularly at 9
p.m., he says.
Learning Through The Years
And as Hamerton-Kelly has
learned the importance of church
security from the murder and the
theft, so he has learned other
things from other events.
For example, two years ago the
Daily revealed that
Hamerton-Kelly was thinking of
refusing to allow Black Muslim

minister John Muhammad to
speak in the church.
Hamerton-Kelly said that he
wished to discuss the Black
Muslim religion — particularly
what he called its "racist aspect"
— with the promoters of the
Muhammad appearance.
Because of this
Hamerton-Kelly disclosure, Black
Student Union members
demonstrated at the church, and
Muhammad supporters said that
Muhammad no longer wished to
appear.
Later, Hamerton-Kelly said, "I
sincerely regret that my questions
about Black Muslims became
public."
The 36-year-old South
African-born dean added that it
was "very painful to find myself

in this position . . . appearing as
an opponent of blacks ... I'm
deeply attached to Africa and
Africans. I feel at home with
them."
Now, Hamerton-Kelly says that
if Muhammad were to put in a
new bid to speak, "I would make
him part of the program of
Memorial Church. The reason for
that is that I now understand
much better than I did then what
the nature of this church is and
what the nature pf this
community is."

Hamerton-Kelly notes. The
church used to be open all night.
In addition, this summer the
church will close regularly at 9
p.m., he says.
Learning Through The Years
And as Hamerton-Kelly has
learned the importance of church
security from the murder and the
theft, so he has learned other
things from other events.
For example, two years ago the
Daily revealed that
Hamerton-Kelly was thinking of
refusing to allow Black Muslim

minister John Muhammad to
speak in the church.
Hamerton-Kelly said that he
wished to discuss the Black
Muslim religion — particularly
what he called its "racist aspect"
— with the promoters of the
Muhammad appearance.
Because of this
Hamerton-Kelly disclosure, Black
Student Union members
demonstrated at the church, and
Muhammad supporters said that
Muhammad no longer wished to
appear.
Later, Hamerton-Kelly said, "I
sincerely regret that my questions
about Black Muslims became
public."
The 36-year-old South
African-born dean added that it
was "very painful to find myself

in this position . . . appearing as
an opponent of blacks ... I'm
deeply attached to Africa and
Africans. I feel at home with
them."
Now, Hamerton-Kelly says that
if Muhammad were to put in a
new bid to speak, "I would make
him part of the program of
Memorial Church. The reason for
that is that I now understand
much better than I did then what
the nature of this church is and
what the nature pf this
community is."
And just as Hamerton-Kelly
has learned from his experiences
here, so he has been saddened.
While he says that there has been
no noticeable decline in church
attendance since the Perry
murder, he admits that "vast
hoards of students have not
flocked to the church."
He says he's not too surprised
at the lack of student churchgoers
"given the nature of the
University as a secular institution
and given the secularism of most
of its members." He thinks of
himself as being engaged in a
"tough reality.
"I guess what we lack in
quantity, I'd like to believe we
make up in quality," he says.
Despite all the "tough" events
he has to deal with at Stanford,
Hamerton-Kelly continues to say,
"We're surely not turning the
world upside down, but at least
what I hope is that people regard
it as a solid honest enterprise."
A Methodist, a trinitarian and
an admirer of the Protestant
theologian, Karl Barth,
Hamerton-Kelly calls his theology
"reasonably orthodox," and adds,
"I don't feel free to change the
religion, to make it up as I go
along."
