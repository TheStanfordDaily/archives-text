# Interns Blast Program

### PAM WOODS 
Some interns in the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) are complaining that, in
the words of one intern,
"compared to the rest of the
graduate world at Stanford, we
are getting a second-rate
education."
Grievances range from the poor
quality of required classes
designed especially for the STEP
program to the apathetic and
condescending attitudes of
professors.
STEP is a 12-month, fifth-year
program with roughly 100 interns.
When students graduate, they
receive a California Single Subject
Teaching Credential and a
Master's in Education.
The interns asked that their
names be withheld in order to
prevent friction between students
and teachers in the program.
'A Joke'
One STEP intern called
required classes such as
educational psychology and
educational sociology "a joke"
and added, "If you sent a Daily
photographer to one of the classes
there would probably be no more
than two people there."
However, Fred Moss,
coordinator of the STEP program,
called the complaints "pretty
skimpy" and suggested that they
did not reflect the feelings of the
majority of the STEP students.
"Lots of people think the
classes are very worthwhile ... a
few people are complaining very
loudly, but 1 have talked to a
larger number of people who
aren't complaining," he said. Moss
suggested that an in-depth study
of the opinions of STEP interns
was necessary.
Poorly Organized?
According to interns, the
classes are poorly organized

("sections often didn't meet and
scheduled speakers didn't show
up"), and comparable courses
offered to regular graduate
students in the School of
Education are much better.
Also, claim some interns,
condescending professors present
material that is "insulting to our
intelligence."
"One professor actually
intimated to a friend of mine that
the course had to be addressed to
the lowest common
denominator," said one intern,
adding that the professor seemed
to think that the appropriate level
was freshman or high school.
STEP interns are required to
practice teach in local
secondary schools as part of their
curriculum, and some said they
felt they "should have been given
much more guidance" in the
classroom.
Experience Lacking
According to one intern, some
of the supervisors, who are

graduate students in the School of
Education, "didn't have much
experience themselves" and
seldom came to observe the
interns in their teaching
situations.
Interns said they feel that the
poor quality of STEP is reflected
in a high dropout rate which
"indicates more than a lack of
interest in teaching."
"But, in all fairness to the
program," said a STEP student,
"although there are many, many
faults, it has provided good
training experience and some
individual instructors in
curriculum areas have been greatly
appreciated."
Interns say that complaints
about STEP have existed for
many years. They claim that one
professor openly admitted this
when he told his class: "I know
you're unhappy. STEP students at
this time last year were unhappy.
STEP students seven years ago
were unhappy."

prevent friction between students
and teachers in the program.
'A Joke'
One STEP intern called
required classes such as
educational psychology and
educational sociology "a joke"
and added, "If you sent a Daily
photographer to one of the classes
there would probably be no more
than two people there."
However, Fred Moss,
coordinator of the STEP program,
called the complaints "pretty
skimpy" and suggested that they
did not reflect the feelings of the
majority of the STEP students.
"Lots of people think the
classes are very worthwhile ... a
few people are complaining very
loudly, but 1 have talked to a
larger number of people who
aren't complaining," he said. Moss
suggested that an in-depth study
of the opinions of STEP interns
was necessary.
Poorly Organized?
According to interns, the
classes are poorly organized

("sections often didn't meet and
scheduled speakers didn't show
up"), and comparable courses
offered to regular graduate
students in the School of
Education are much better.
Also, claim some interns,
condescending professors present
material that is "insulting to our
intelligence."
"One professor actually
intimated to a friend of mine that
the course had to be addressed to
the lowest common
denominator," said one intern,
adding that the professor seemed
to think that the appropriate level
was freshman or high school.
STEP interns are required to
practice teach in local
secondary schools as part of their
curriculum, and some said they
felt they "should have been given
much more guidance" in the
classroom.
Experience Lacking
According to one intern, some
of the supervisors, who are

graduate students in the School of
Education, "didn't have much
experience themselves" and
seldom came to observe the
interns in their teaching
situations.
Interns said they feel that the
poor quality of STEP is reflected
in a high dropout rate which
"indicates more than a lack of
interest in teaching."
"But, in all fairness to the
program," said a STEP student,
"although there are many, many
faults, it has provided good
training experience and some
individual instructors in
curriculum areas have been greatly
appreciated."
Interns say that complaints
about STEP have existed for
many years. They claim that one
professor openly admitted this
when he told his class: "I know
you're unhappy. STEP students at
this time last year were unhappy.
STEP students seven years ago
were unhappy."
Some interns in the Secondary
Teacher Education Program
(STEP) are complaining that, in
the words of one intern,
"compared to the rest of the
graduate world at Stanford, we
are getting a second-rate
education."
Grievances range from the poor
quality of required classes
designed especially for the STEP
program to the apathetic and
condescending attitudes of
professors.
STEP is a 12-month, fifth-year
program with roughly 100 interns.
When students graduate, they
receive a California Single Subject
Teaching Credential and a
Master's in Education.
The interns asked that their
names be withheld in order to
prevent friction between students
and teachers in the program.
