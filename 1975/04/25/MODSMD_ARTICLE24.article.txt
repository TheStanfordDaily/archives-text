# Study: Monitor Needed To Stop Test Cheating
## 
### 
DAVIS (AP) — Monitors
should be present in classrooms
during tests at the University of
California at Davis to help prevent
cheating, faculty leaders suggested
Wednesday.
The change in the long
standing campus honor code —
which now bans monitors — is
included in a report from the
campus's Academic Senate to
Chancellor James H. Meyer, who
asked for the study.
"There is some faculty

disenchantment with what is
regarded as the excessive and
unjustifiable leniency in current
practice," said the draft letter
from art professor and senate
chairman Richard D. Cramer
accompanying the report.
Currently the code is
administered by the students.
The report came from a
year-long study ordered by Meyer
after reports of increased cheating
in recent years. It will be
presented to the Senate division at
a May 27 meeting.
