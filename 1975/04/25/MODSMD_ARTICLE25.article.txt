## Morrison Appears At Bay Area Clubs 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
SAN FRANCISCO—"I never know
what it's gonna be," sang Van
Morrison Sunday night at the
Great American Music Hall. The
lyric illustrates this reviewer's
experience of Van Morrison live.
Morrison has been known to
saunter onstage, glance at the
crowd, and walk right off, leaving
the audience outraged. At times
he's been too angry, nervous, or
high to give a good concert. People
complain that it's better to listen
to his records than to attend his
blase live performances.
Last week at Sophie's after
Morrison's show, a frustrated fan
commented: "I've never seen him
smile, never. He acts like he's
doing you a favor when he's
onstage."
Morrison did look downright
sultry at Sophie's. He explained
that he wanted to play some
"dance music," and spent the
night feeding the crowd other
artists' rhythm and blues material.
But Van's strength lies on his
own compositions, not in others:
The audience heard few of these,
and his detached attitude nearly
killed the excitement of a song
like "I've Been Working."
To further dampen the
concert, people were into Sophie's
like cattle, the sound was
excruciatingly loud, the show
started an hour late, and the gap
between Morrison's sets lasted
another hour.
In contrast, "Van the Man"
came onstage smiling and joking
with his back-up band at the
Great American Music Hall. He
proceeded to pump some energy
into his performance, blowing
furiously on his saxophone and
assortment of harmonicas.
Morrison's exceptional vocal

style hinges on the way he
patterns his words along a
melody. He can stretch syllables
out lazily and gracefully, cram
words together or spread them
around.
However, the absence of a
brass section behind Morrison's
vocals detracted from the music,
and his expert sax arrangements
were sorely missed on songs like
"St. Dominic's Preview" and
"Wild Night."
It seems that Morrison only
uses his boogie-type material in
concert, ignoring his masterpiece
Moondance album and the more
pensive, gentle music of
Hard-Nose the Highway and
Astral Weeks.
It is lamentable that a man
with the musical capability of Van
Morrison would neglect his own
compositions, and appear without
essential back-up. Hopefully
Morrison will realize that he can't
coast along on his fame forever.

crowd, and walk right off, leaving
the audience outraged. At times
he's been too angry, nervous, or
high to give a good concert. People
complain that it's better to listen
to his records than to attend his
blase live performances.
Last week at Sophie's after
Morrison's show, a frustrated fan
commented: "I've never seen him
smile, never. He acts like he's
doing you a favor when he's
onstage."
Morrison did look downright
sultry at Sophie's. He explained
that he wanted to play some
"dance music," and spent the
night feeding the crowd other
artists' rhythm and blues material.
But Van's strength lies on his
own compositions, not in others:
The audience heard few of these,
and his detached attitude nearly
killed the excitement of a song
like "I've Been Working."
To further dampen the
concert, people were into Sophie's
like cattle, the sound was
excruciatingly loud, the show
started an hour late, and the gap
between Morrison's sets lasted
another hour.
In contrast, "Van the Man"
came onstage smiling and joking
with his back-up band at the
Great American Music Hall. He
proceeded to pump some energy
into his performance, blowing
furiously on his saxophone and
assortment of harmonicas.
Morrison's exceptional vocal

style hinges on the way he
patterns his words along a
melody. He can stretch syllables
out lazily and gracefully, cram
words together or spread them
around.
However, the absence of a
brass section behind Morrison's
vocals detracted from the music,
and his expert sax arrangements
were sorely missed on songs like
"St. Dominic's Preview" and
"Wild Night."
It seems that Morrison only
uses his boogie-type material in
concert, ignoring his masterpiece
Moondance album and the more
pensive, gentle music of
Hard-Nose the Highway and
Astral Weeks.
It is lamentable that a man
with the musical capability of Van
Morrison would neglect his own
compositions, and appear without
essential back-up. Hopefully
Morrison will realize that he can't
coast along on his fame forever.

OUR MAN VAN—Van Morrison, who can sing and play his saxophone
and harmonica beautifully when he's in the mood, appeared in Palo
Alto and San Francisco last weekend.
SAN FRANCISCO—"I never know
what it's gonna be," sang Van
Morrison Sunday night at the
Great American Music Hall. The
lyric illustrates this reviewer's
experience of Van Morrison live.
Morrison has been known to
saunter onstage, glance at the
crowd, and walk right off, leaving
the audience outraged. At times
he's been too angry, nervous, or
high to give a good concert. People
complain that it's better to listen
to his records than to attend his
blase live performances.
