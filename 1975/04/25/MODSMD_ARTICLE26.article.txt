Mahavishnu Orchestra
Visions of the Emerald Beyond
Columbia PC 33411
In the six years since the then
almost unknown John
McLaughlin played on Miles
Davis' album In A Silent Way,
McLaughlin has become perhaps
the most popular and important
guitarist in the history of jazz.
What McLaughlin did, first
with Miles and later as leader of
the early version of the
Mahavishnu Orchestra, was simply

to become the first jazz musician
to explore the possibilities of an
electric instrument: possibilities
like loud volume, distortion, and a
style heavily influenced by rock.
And the first Mahavishnu
Orchestra was almost impossibly
good. McLaughlin's playing on the
first two albums, The Inner
Mounting Flame and Birds of
Fire, set up a whole movement of
"jazz-rock" guitarists.
The only thing that could stop
the quintet (McLaughlin, Billy
Cobham, Rick Laird, Jerry
Goodman and Jan Hammer) was
personality problems. When they
split up early last year, there were
rumors that McLaughlin had
become unbearably egotistical or
too caught up with following his
guru, Sri Chinmoy.

But Visions of the Emerald
Beyond, the second album of the
new ten-person Orchestra, reveals
that McLaughlin has not faltered a
bit: the new Orchestra may not
play quite as well as the old, but
everything Mahavishnu
McLaughlin does on Visions
strengthens his position as the
most influential electric guitarist
since the death of Jimi Hendrix.
All the evidence necessary to
make that statement is. contained
in the first two songs on Visions.
"Eternity's Breath," a two-part
song, shows how well the big
Orchestra can play together.
The first theme (like many of
McLaughlin's works it is based on
Eastern modes) finds Mahavishnu
using a chorus of voices for the
first time. The effect is that of a

moving hymn.
Some of the album's other
songs represent familiar
McLaughlin themes: "Pastoral,"
an acoustic piece featuring Ponty,
is romantic in the tradition of "A
Lotus on Irish Streams," while
"Faith" presents the
overpowering crescendo of earlier
short works like "Hope."
The new Orchestra is not the
definitive jazz group that the early
quintet was. Ponty is a fine
violinist. Drummer Michael
Walden, though, follows his
predecessor Billy Cobham's style a
bit too closely. Unlike Cobham,
Walden is not capable of much
subtlety: he bangs a lot.
But the dominant force behind
this Orchestra is, of course,
Mahavishnu John McLaughlin,
who occupies a position of
dominance on his instrument that
no jazzman has held since Charlie
Christian died over 30 years
ago.
