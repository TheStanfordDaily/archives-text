# Bizarre 'Fits' Well-Acted
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
Robert Montgomery's "Subject
to Fits," a response to
Dostoevski's The Idiot, is a play
about stuffed gerbils and
Christianity, the modern
nightmare and brains in white
vases.
An outrageous and sometimes
irritating blend of the absurd and
the symbolic, the play defies
rational interpretation. But
director Michael Bloom and his
cast of superb actors from the
Stanford Drama Department
manage to get across powerful
images which begin to make sense
only after one has given up trying
to understand what actually
happened.
The action takes place in St.
Petersburg, but the 19th
century Russian setting is evident
only in the names and costumes
of the characters. The stage is
bare, and the walls are covered
with collages of colliding, angular
shapes, creating the atmosphere of
violence and fragmentation more
characteristic of modern society.
In front of these bizarre
collages move equally bizarre

individuals. The slut Natasha
(played by Carol Bunker) laughs
hysterically at the sadistic antics
of her knife-wielding lover
Paryfon (Leigh Sealy).
The consumptive (Eric
Wenburg) spits phlegm at their
feet, and Paryfon's servant
(Robert Egan) barks at their heels
with a hangman's noose around
his neck.
Throw-Ins
Throw in an alcoholic
ex-general, a society bitch and a
businessman steeped in
mediocrity, and the portrait of a
thoroughly decadent society is
almost complete. Ah, but they
need a Christ figure, someone to
externalize their suffering, a
symbol of what they could have
been.
Who more fitting than an
epileptic, the sensitive young man
subject to fits, the misfit subject
to life? Elliot Stroka brilliantly
portrays the scapegoat, the
compassionate Prince Myshkin,
who struggles to break through
the barriers which this group of
sick individuals have constructed
around themselves.
Of course, he must fail;
Dostoevski would not have it

any other way. But what is found
in the play and not in
Dostoevski's more pessimistic
work is the humorous element,
the delightfully absurd.
Dirty Songs
The characters continually
undercut the impact of some of
the most depressing themes with
dirty songs, sarcastic criticisms,
and "sick" jokes. Tragedy turns
into farce, and you find yourself
laughing in the middle of a suicide
scene.
Absurdity does have its limits,
however, an'd "Subject to Fits"
sometimes carries it a bit too far.
Illusion can heighten reality but
can also obscure it, and many
people will probably leave the
play without the faintest idea of
what it meant.
In the last lines, one of the
characters appropriately sums up
the emotions of more than one
viewer when she says with a
disdainful sniff, "Fantasy,
fantasy. Enough of these illusions.
I'm going home."
But games, no matter how
complex, are always fun.
"Subject to Fits," definitely
worth seeing, is being performed
at the Nitery through Saturday
night.
