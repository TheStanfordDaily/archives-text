# Movies: Bogdanovich Pokes At Cole
## 
### 
All Peter Bogdanovich has to
do is bring out another turkey in
the boring tradition of Daisy
Miller and At Long Last Love and
he'll be all washed up as
Hollywood's Boy Wonder of the
19705. One thing is indisputable,
though — there is no possibility
that his next movie can be more
self-indulgent than At Long Last
Love.
Not only did he write,
produce, and direct it — and I use
those terms loosely — he also cast
his love, Cybil Shepherd,
ex-model and soon to be
ex-actress with any luck, in the
lead.
Bogdanovich's cast (Burt
Reynolds, Madeline Kahn, Duilio
Del Prete, Eileen Brennan, John
Hillerman andCybil) have all, with
the exception of Reynolds,
worked with Bogdanovich before.
They must have thought
Bogdanovich was infallible — and
they all used to have skyrocketing
careers until they made this.
Haphazard Ties
These three couples, are tied
together rather haphazardly so
that what seems like every five
minutes they go into one of
Peter's favorite songs.
Six more fickle, immature,
boring and childish people you
have never met in your life. The
songs they sing are by Cole Porter,

Bogdanovich's self-admitted
favorite, and the movie is merely a
showcase for these songs around
what is assumed to be a plot.
Most of the songs are from
Anything Goes, a witty play of
the 30s that is very popular with
high school drama departments.
To put them here is a disgrace of
the highest order.
Jumble Of Scenes
Since there seems to be more
singing than talking, this is almost
like That's Entertainment — a
jumble of scenes stolen'from old
movies, with the madcap heiress
and the bored heir and the witty
ladies' maid and the stodgy
chauffeur.
I have to admit that as the
latter John Hillerman was superb
as usual and the only one who
was; as the heir, Reynolds walks
through the whole thing as if it
were a game, as if the camera
weren't running — which it
shouldn't have been. Obviously,
he is the only one having a good
time — the audience certainly
isn't.
Apparently Bogdanovich didn't
realize that even a spoof like this
has to be able to stand on its own
as a movie. It can't be a shadow of
an old movie rehashed, as this is.
Even parodies like Young
Frankenstein have solid and
complete stories. This is so
shoddy that by comparison
Report To The Commissioner
looks like The Godfather, Part 11.
Home Movies
Peter Bogdanovich must have
had the time of his life doing this.
I think he should take the film
and put it in his own private vault
to show as a home movie — God
knows no one else could have any
interest in it.
Listing At Long Last Love's
flaws would be like taking
attendance at a Raiders' game

(and listing its good points would
be even more difficult — there are
none.)
From the first moment when
Cybil Shepherd walks into her
suite and starts singing (I use that
term loosely, too), one squirms
with discomfort. Anyone with
any sense will leave then and start
a poker game in the lobby to try
and win back some of the
admission price.
The film is set in the'3os — but
you wouldn't know it from the
futuristic furniture. The sound is
atrocious, not helped by the cast
mumbling its lines and lyrics, and
Italian Duilio Del Prete mangling
English beyond repair.
There is really no excuse for
this motion picture. It moves
from the ridiculous to the asinine
(a scene in which untied bow ties
suddenly become the fashion) to
the tasteless — when Reynolds
sings, "Picture Betty Hutton
without a nickel." Considering
that Betty Hutton did lose her
fortune and is now impoverished,
the line is totally uncalled for.
Daisy Miller, Peter's last
indulgence with Cybil (I thought
she did rather well in that film
until I realized that her Brooke
Carter here was just a duplicate of
her Daisy Miller in another time
zone) could be excused.
Bogdanovich made three
phenomenal successes in a row
(The Last Picture Show, What's
Up, Doc?, Paper Moon) which
earned millions, so he had a right
to do a personal film from a
source not usually considered for
the movies (Henry James).
But now, with this he's taken
advantage of this privilege and
he's going to quickly lose it. Is he
too much in love with Cybil to see
that she has but one role and that
we're tired of seeing it?
I read recently that there is no

career so strong that a bomb or
two won't halt it and no career
slump so deep that a hit won't
revive it. Bogdanovich is going to
need something big, and

something good, and something
fast, if he wants to regain his
reputation as a rising young
director.
