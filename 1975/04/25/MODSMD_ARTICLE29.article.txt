# Symphony: Unusual Tschaikovsky

### MARY INGERSOLL 
SAN F R A N-
ClSCO—Tschaikovsky lovers were
treated to unusual fare at the San
Francisco Symphony Wednesday
night — a performance of his
rarely-heard Piano Concerto No. 2
in G Major, Opus 44.
Argentine-born Sylvia
Kersenbaum soloed with the
Orchestra.
The No. 2 has long ,been
overshadowed by Tchaikovsky's
first piano concerto, which is
much more melodic and
romantically appealing. The No. 2
is a disappointed marathon of
pure technique and lacks the
romanticism and sensuousness
that characterizes the earlier
work.
Kersenbaum was perfectly
suited for the piece in that her
technique is incredible. She
breezed across the keyboard
without missing a note or losing
the fast tempos.
Her performance was marred,
however, by an occasional
heavy-handedness and muddy

touch, and too much pedal. Had
she not leaned so heavily on the
music, particularly in the final
movement, more of Tchaikovsky's
intended playfulness might have
come through.
The work is also unusual in
that it features extensive solos for
violin and cello. Concertmaster
Stuart Canin played beautifully;
lots of vibrato and tone brought
out the moving melodies. Cellist
Robert Sayre started out slightly
out of tune but brought his solos
to a sensitive close.

The orchestra, under the
direction of guest conductor Jean
Mar'inon, played very well except
for intonation problems in the
horns.
Martinon led the orchestra in a
brilliant performance of Brahms'
Symphony No. 4 in E Minor,
Opus 98. All the color and mood
of Brahms was there; the dramatic
intensity of the first allegro, the
more moody and contemplative
audante, and buoyant allegro
giocoso, and the assertive,
passionate finale.
