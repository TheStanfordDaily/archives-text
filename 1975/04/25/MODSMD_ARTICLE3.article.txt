# Black Students Sit-in At Brown U. Building
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Negotiations broke off without
making any progress late last night,
after about 40 black students occupied
the administration building at Brown
University.
The students, protesting budget
cutbacks which they charged would
make the University "richer and
whiter," entered University Hall, the
administration building, at 8 a.m.
Shortly afterwards, about 400 black
and white students began picketing
outside the building in support of the
demonstrators.
The occupation of the building has
not seriously disrupted University
operations, Jeff Freudberg, a reporter
for the Brown Daily Herald, told the
Daily late last night. The
administration, apparently forewarned
of the coming occupation, moved
much of its equipment to another
building from which it is now
operating, he said.

Negotiations were scheduled to
resume this morning. "Everything is
very, very open," Freudberg
commented. He said that both sides
"really want to get it solved."
Peaceful Protest
The takeover was peaceful, and
University officials made no
immediate effort to call in police or
National Guardsmen. "The planning
has been quite extensive, it was almost
like a military operation," Freudberg
said.
Freudberg added that a spokesman
for Brown University President Donald
Hornig had ruled out the use of force,
saying the administration was
genuinely interested in negotiating the
student demands.
The demands included continuation
of the current levels of financial aid
for minority students, a larger budget
for recruiting black students and
amnesty for all students involved in
the takeover.
Boycott Ending
The takeover came in the wake of a
four-day boycott of classes by most of
the school's 5100 undergraduates in
protest of the University's proposed
"austerity budget" for 1975-76.
However, according to Freudberg,
most classes met normally yesterday.
"Life goes on as usual," he noted,
although there is "a little bit of
backlash." He added that a group of
"frat members" had massed outside
the administration building
threatening to evict the demonstrators,
but that "the threat never
materialized."
The Student Coalition, which
backed the earlier student strike, was
meeting to decide what stand to take
on the occupation, Freudberg said. He
admitted, however, that it should be
called the "white student coalition."
He added that the Coalition has
become "decentralized" in the wake
of the strike, thus lessening the
chances for postiive action.
Freudberg said the only service
disrupted by the occupation was the
filing of class enrollment cards, the
equivalent of Stanford's advance
registration.
The original student strike ended
on Saturday, after largely failing in its
efforts to convince the Brown
administration to modify proposed
financial policies. The administration
offered various compromises, most of
which the student body rejected in a
referendum earlier this week.
The Brown Corporation will take
final action on the budget in June.

which the student body rejected in a
referendum earlier this week.
The Brown Corporation will take
final action on the budget in June.
Negotiations broke off without
making any progress late last night,
after about 40 black students occupied
the administration building at Brown
University.
The students, protesting budget
cutbacks which they charged would
make the University "richer and
whiter," entered University Hall, the
administration building, at 8 a.m.
Shortly afterwards, about 400 black
and white students began picketing
outside the building in support of the
demonstrators.
The occupation of the building has
not seriously disrupted University
operations, Jeff Freudberg, a reporter
for the Brown Daily Herald, told the
Daily late last night. The
administration, apparently forewarned
of the coming occupation, moved
much of its equipment to another
building from which it is now
operating, he said.

Negotiations were scheduled to
resume this morning. "Everything is
very, very open," Freudberg
commented. He said that both sides
"really want to get it solved."
Peaceful Protest
The takeover was peaceful, and
University officials made no
immediate effort to call in police or
National Guardsmen. "The planning
has been quite extensive, it was almost
like a military operation," Freudberg
said.
Freudberg added that a spokesman
for Brown University President Donald
Hornig had ruled out the use of force,
saying the administration was
genuinely interested in negotiating the
student demands.
The demands included continuation
of the current levels of financial aid
for minority students, a larger budget
for recruiting black students and
amnesty for all students involved in
the takeover.
Boycott Ending
The takeover came in the wake of a
four-day boycott of classes by most of
the school's 5100 undergraduates in
protest of the University's proposed
"austerity budget" for 1975-76.
However, according to Freudberg,
most classes met normally yesterday.
"Life goes on as usual," he noted,
although there is "a little bit of
backlash." He added that a group of
"frat members" had massed outside
the administration building
threatening to evict the demonstrators,
but that "the threat never
materialized."
The Student Coalition, which
backed the earlier student strike, was
meeting to decide what stand to take
on the occupation, Freudberg said. He
admitted, however, that it should be
called the "white student coalition."
He added that the Coalition has
become "decentralized" in the wake
of the strike, thus lessening the
chances for postiive action.
Freudberg said the only service
disrupted by the occupation was the
filing of class enrollment cards, the
equivalent of Stanford's advance
registration.
The original student strike ended
on Saturday, after largely failing in its
efforts to convince the Brown
administration to modify proposed
financial policies. The administration
offered various compromises, most of
which the student body rejected in a
referendum earlier this week.
