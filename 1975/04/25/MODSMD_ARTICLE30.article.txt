## Card Distanceman Comes Into Own 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Jack Bellah didn't even get to
feel the tape break across his chest
when he won the three-mile run in
last Saturday's double dual track
meet against USC in Berkeley.
Bellah was running in a
three-mile race which combined
all the squads, and although he
finished first in competition
against the Trojans, who didn't
enter anyone in the race, he had
to settle for second place in the
crowded field.
The lack of hoopla didn't faze
him though. His 13:56.4
performance, a personal best,
equalled the sixth best three-mile
mark in Stanford history and
completed a Stanford sweep of
the distance events on a day when
the USC spikers literally swept the
Cards off the track.
His winning effort surprised
some veteran track observers in
Berkeley, who were amazed that
anyone other than teammate
Tony Sandoval could break a
record in the distances.
Stanford track Coach Payton
Jordan was not among the
skeptics, though. "Jack is a big
event performer," said Jordan.
"He seems to compete well when
the pressure is on him." The "big
event" label came early for Bellah.
As a freshman competing in the
1973 Pacific Eight track and field
meet, he surprised everyone by
running away with the six-mile,
only to finish second to teammate
Brian Mittlestaedt, who passed
him in the last 100 yards of the
race. In last year's Pac-8 meet he
came from nowhere to take fifth
in the six-mile.
"I've always sort of gotten
excited over the big meets," says
Bellah. "But this year I've sort of
evened my performances out. I
try to put it together all the
time."
He hasn't received as much
publicity as Sandoval, the seventh
place finisher in last year's NCAA
six-mile, but it hasn't bothered
the quiet Bellah. "If we do well as
a team that's all right with me. It's

fun running with Sandy, but he
sets a fast pace. We get along
really well. We're fraternity
brothers [Theta Delta Chi] and
we're both on the cross country
team."
Bellah hasn't always been a
shadow-runner. A former San Jose
City cross country champion from
Leigh high school, he says he
always wanted to come to the
Farm. It makes sense. Bellah's
grandfather, Sam, was a two-time
Olympic pole vaulter from
Stanford in 1907 and 1912. But
the Cardinal track fortunes have
fallen a long way since his
grandfather was on the Farm.
Stanford has been humiliated
in Pac-8 dual meet competition
for the past two years, the latest
blow coming last Saturday when
the Trojans whipped the Cards
113-30. "Running track gets
awfully frustrating. Last Saturday
was like an onslaught. Winning
was great, but I just wanted to get
the meet over."
Bellah, a three year track and
cross country letterman, says he's
really looking forward to next
year's cross country season.
"We're going to have a great team.
We've got two good prospects
coming in, so we should be really
good."
But before that he's got
tomorrow's Mount San Antonio
Relays to think about. He'll be
running in the 3000 meter
steeplechase, where his best effort
is a 9:10.2. "I'd really like to get
under nine minutes tomorrow,
but I think my best chance is in
the Pac-8 six-mile."
Tomorrow's steeplechase might
just be a big event for the
diminutive Bellah.

Stanford athletes will travel down

invitational meet. James Lofton
will return to competition in the

equalled the sixth best three-mile
mark in Stanford history and
completed a Stanford sweep of
the distance events on a day when
the USC spikers literally swept the
Cards off the track.
His winning effort surprised
some veteran track observers in
Berkeley, who were amazed that
anyone other than teammate
Tony Sandoval could break a
record in the distances.
Stanford track Coach Payton
Jordan was not among the
skeptics, though. "Jack is a big
event performer," said Jordan.
"He seems to compete well when
the pressure is on him." The "big
event" label came early for Bellah.
As a freshman competing in the
1973 Pacific Eight track and field
meet, he surprised everyone by
running away with the six-mile,
only to finish second to teammate
Brian Mittlestaedt, who passed
him in the last 100 yards of the
race. In last year's Pac-8 meet he
came from nowhere to take fifth
in the six-mile.
"I've always sort of gotten
excited over the big meets," says
Bellah. "But this year I've sort of
evened my performances out. I
try to put it together all the
time."
He hasn't received as much
publicity as Sandoval, the seventh
place finisher in last year's NCAA
six-mile, but it hasn't bothered
the quiet Bellah. "If we do well as
a team that's all right with me. It's

fun running with Sandy, but he
sets a fast pace. We get along
really well. We're fraternity
brothers [Theta Delta Chi] and
we're both on the cross country
team."
Bellah hasn't always been a
shadow-runner. A former San Jose
City cross country champion from
Leigh high school, he says he
always wanted to come to the
Farm. It makes sense. Bellah's
grandfather, Sam, was a two-time
Olympic pole vaulter from
Stanford in 1907 and 1912. But
the Cardinal track fortunes have
fallen a long way since his
grandfather was on the Farm.
Stanford has been humiliated
in Pac-8 dual meet competition
for the past two years, the latest
blow coming last Saturday when
the Trojans whipped the Cards
113-30. "Running track gets
awfully frustrating. Last Saturday
was like an onslaught. Winning
was great, but I just wanted to get
the meet over."
Bellah, a three year track and
cross country letterman, says he's
really looking forward to next
year's cross country season.
"We're going to have a great team.
We've got two good prospects
coming in, so we should be really
good."
But before that he's got
tomorrow's Mount San Antonio
Relays to think about. He'll be
running in the 3000 meter
steeplechase, where his best effort
is a 9:10.2. "I'd really like to get
under nine minutes tomorrow,
but I think my best chance is in
the Pac-8 six-mile."
Tomorrow's steeplechase might
just be a big event for the
diminutive Bellah.

BREAKING THE TAPE—Distanceman Jack Bellah got to feel the
tape across his chest when he won the three-mile run against
Occidental earlier this month, but he didn't get to break the tape last
week when he won the three-mile against USC. It didn't bother him,
for his performance was the sixth best three-mile in Stanford history.
Jack Bellah didn't even get to
feel the tape break across his chest
when he won the three-mile run in
last Saturday's double dual track
meet against USC in Berkeley.
Bellah was running in a
three-mile race which combined
all the squads, and although he
finished first in competition
against the Trojans, who didn't
enter anyone in the race, he had
to settle for second place in the
crowded field.
The lack of hoopla didn't faze
him though. His 13:56.4
performance, a personal best,
equalled the sixth best three-mile
mark in Stanford history and
