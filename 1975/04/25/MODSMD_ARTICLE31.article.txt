# IM Roundup
## All Sports 'Rolling Along' 
### PETE BHATIA 
IM's rolled along this week, with league sports
reaching the halfway mark and elimination
tourneys continuing with the remaining numbers
growing increasingly smaller.
In softball, volleyball and water polo it's still too
early to call an overall winner, although Sigma Chi
people would have you believe they will win their
third straight softball crown, and the Theta Delts
will say the same regarding their third straight
volleyball number one. The Betas appear pretty
tough in water polo right now, although there is
still much action remaining.
In tennis, the JV season ended this quarter so all
those wonderful guys have dropped down to play
IM's, and caused all kinds of confusion, making
things difficult for all those nameless fools who
play intramurals for fun (gasp).
Elsewhere, it looks like horseshoes could come
down to a battle between the only two living
groups on campus that give horseshoe scholarships
— El Toro and Otero. These two teams are a horse
and a shoe better than anyone else at this point,
and it should prove a good match. In badminton,

JRA and the Chinese Students Association appear
to have the top teams.
- In the only event of the quarter completed thus
far, Peter Fox and Paul Yeuell of Phi Psi squashed
the rest of the sb-boat field to win the Canoe Race
at the Aquafollies. Fox and Yeuell qualified for the
final heat with a 1:34.0 clocking, three seconds
ahead of second qualifier Sigma Chi. In the finals,
the winners got out first and held off Sigma Chi
easily to win going away at 1:40.7. Cro Mem was
third and SAE fourth.
As usual a few of the contestants had had a bit
too much of the golden liquid before racing and
one team in particular fell out of its boat twice,
never got started and finally just decided to dump
the judge's boat, which had come over to make sure
the two dubious sailors did not drown.
Sigma Chi protested the Phi Psi team, saying
Fox was not a registered student, but the registrar
disagreed and the Fox-Yeuell win was confirmed.
Fox and Yeuell were clearly the class of the field
and if Oscar Robertson had been at Lake Lag, and
Brent Mossburger had asked if Fox and Yeuell were
the best team, all Oscar could have said would have
been, "Woaaaahhhh!!!! Yes they were!"
