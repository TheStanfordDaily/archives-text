# Batters Take On USC In Three-Game Series
## 
### DAN PYNE 
The University of Southern
California baseball team will
appear on Sunken Diamond
tomorrow to defend their Pacific
Eight Southern Division lead from
the Leland Stanford Junior
University Cardinals, a team that
defeated USC twice in three
games in Los Angeles earlier this
quarter and now resides in second
position, behind the Trojans, with
a 5-4 conference record.
It's an even match-up.
Stanford, with its not
impressive but highly effective
battery of hitters and injured but
gritty staff of pitchers, comes into
the contest with a three-game
winning streak, a 29-17 record
and the knowledge that a
two-out-of-three game series
victory will put them in first place
in the southern conference, and a
three-game sweep will provide
them with the lead and some
breathing room.
No Cardinal batter is averaging
over .290, but catcher Bruce
Robinson leads the Pac-8 in home

runs with 10 and first baseman
Tom Guardino is in second place
in doubles with 11 this season. Al
Arthur, the Cards' premier
righthander, has the league's
second lowest ERA, 1.64, and a
season record of 6-3. Ken Grolle,
Mike Williamson, Jerry Argust and
Bernie Hittner all have sore arms.
USC, the five-time defending
national champion that swept
three games from UCLA last
weekend to turn its record around
from 1-2 to 4-2 and raise its

overall total to 27-9, has on its
roster the league-leading pitcher
(Pete Redfearn, 1.37 ERA; 72
strike-outs), and knows that
success this weekend will give
them a commanding league lead.
Stanford took five of six games
from the Trojans last year, and
this year Coach Ray Young is
calm. "I expect us to go out this
weekend and play very fine
baseball; perhaps the best we've
played all season."
Young said he is unsure of the
weekend starters — one will be
Arthur, the other two will come
from the trio -of Argust, Bruce
Davis and John Yandle. He added,
however, that he would like to use
Yandle because USC's
"righthanded line-up is their lesser
strength, and I'd like to take
advantage of that."
Wednesday, Stanford bombed
San Francisco State 13-4 with 18
hits, and Ed Matta picked up the
win. Yandle started the game,
pitched two innings, Matta hurled
the next six, and Arthur pitched
the ninth. Freshman second
baseman Kenny Triggs banged out
two hits, one of them a triple —
for five RBIs. And Stanford
upped its stolen-base season total
to 106.
The doubleheader tomorrow
begins at noon; a single game on
Sunday will start at 1 p.m. Says
Young, "If USC is going to be
beaten, we're the ones who'll have
to do it."

calm. "I expect us to go out this
weekend and play very fine
baseball; perhaps the best we've
played all season."
Young said he is unsure of the
weekend starters — one will be
Arthur, the other two will come
from the trio -of Argust, Bruce
Davis and John Yandle. He added,
however, that he would like to use
Yandle because USC's
"righthanded line-up is their lesser
strength, and I'd like to take
advantage of that."
Wednesday, Stanford bombed
San Francisco State 13-4 with 18
hits, and Ed Matta picked up the
win. Yandle started the game,
pitched two innings, Matta hurled
the next six, and Arthur pitched
the ninth. Freshman second
baseman Kenny Triggs banged out
two hits, one of them a triple —
for five RBIs. And Stanford
upped its stolen-base season total
to 106.
The doubleheader tomorrow
begins at noon; a single game on
Sunday will start at 1 p.m. Says
Young, "If USC is going to be
beaten, we're the ones who'll have
to do it."
The University of Southern
California baseball team will
appear on Sunken Diamond
tomorrow to defend their Pacific
Eight Southern Division lead from
the Leland Stanford Junior
University Cardinals, a team that
defeated USC twice in three
games in Los Angeles earlier this
quarter and now resides in second
position, behind the Trojans, with
a 5-4 conference record.
It's an even match-up.
Stanford, with its not
impressive but highly effective
battery of hitters and injured but
gritty staff of pitchers, comes into
the contest with a three-game
winning streak, a 29-17 record
and the knowledge that a
two-out-of-three game series
victory will put them in first place
in the southern conference, and a
three-game sweep will provide
them with the lead and some
breathing room.
No Cardinal batter is averaging
over .290, but catcher Bruce
Robinson leads the Pac-8 in home

runs with 10 and first baseman
Tom Guardino is in second place
in doubles with 11 this season. Al
Arthur, the Cards' premier
righthander, has the league's
second lowest ERA, 1.64, and a
season record of 6-3. Ken Grolle,
Mike Williamson, Jerry Argust and
Bernie Hittner all have sore arms.
USC, the five-time defending
national champion that swept
three games from UCLA last
weekend to turn its record around
from 1-2 to 4-2 and raise its

overall total to 27-9, has on its
roster the league-leading pitcher
(Pete Redfearn, 1.37 ERA; 72
strike-outs), and knows that
success this weekend will give
them a commanding league lead.
Stanford took five of six games
from the Trojans last year, and
this year Coach Ray Young is
calm. "I expect us to go out this
weekend and play very fine
baseball; perhaps the best we've
played all season."
