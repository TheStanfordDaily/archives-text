# Women's Team Golf
## Cornett, Palmieri: Stars 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
Pat Cornett and Pam Palmieri,
Stanford's top two women
golfers, have both overcome a
two-year slump, and are working
"to swing harder, hit the b II
further and get more aggressive
out there ...Their efforts are
paying off and it looks as though
they will lead Stanford to the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) title and
make a fine showing nationally as
well.
Both Cornett and Palmieri have
an impressive record of work and
wins.
Cornett, a 21-year-old junior,
began playing golf at age 11,
receiving instruction from her
Salinas pro. She entered the state
competition and virtually
dominated junior tournaments for
the next six years.
At age 16 Cornett won nine
Northern California tournaments,
qualified with 31 other players for
the United States Golf
Association (USGA) junior
nationals and reached the semis in
the state finals.
"After the juniors I hit a
college slump," Cornett said. "For
two years .. . nothing."
Last Christmas Cornett turned
to her pro, Cotton Kaiser, for help
with her game. Up to that time
she had been playing "a chipping
and putting game, relying heavily
on accuracy."
Long Game
"In college I didn't have the
time necessary to keep my short
game up," said Comett,
explaining her slump.
Kaiser concentrated on her
long game. "Before, I had been a
very accurate player but very
short off the tee. Cotton had me
hitting the ball harder, being more
aggressive ..."
Cornett cited a loss of
confidence as a second reason for
her slump. "At home you get
support and encouragement," she
said. "Here no one knows you're
good and the burden of proof's on
you ..."
Things began to pick up last
year. In Tucson, at the University
of Arizona Invitational, Cornett
finished fourth. "I could see
things coming around ... I had
finished behind some super
players," she said.
City Crown
Then she won the San
Francisco City Tournament, her
first amateur win, defeating
defending champ Cheryl Pastore.
She went on to win the Arizona
State University Sun Devil
Tournament, her first collegiate
win, and place third in the
California collegiate competition
behind the top two juniors in the
nation.
"There's been a complete
turnaround, it's unreal ..." said
Cornett.
In addition to her new game,
Cornett attributes her comeback
to a book on psychocybernetics,
"the confidence game. When I get
up to a shot, I imagine the best
possible shot... it's a new thing
for me," she said.
When asked if she will turn pro,
Cornett answered, "Never. I don't
like the set-up and there's no Billie

Jean King to fight for something
better. There isn't enough money
and that type of life doesn't
appeal to me."
Cornett does plan to continue
in the amateurs however, and next
year will receive one of the first
women's athletic scholarships ever
given by the University.
Palmieri Past
Palmieri began playing golf
later than Cornett. At age 13 she
was introduced to the game by
her father and since then has had
several pros.
For the last five years, Palmieri
has received instruction from
John Geertsen Sr., Johnny Miller's
pro. "When I started with
Geertsen my handicap was 11.
One year later I had a handicap of
three," Palmieri said.
Palmieri did not begin playing
in the juniors until she was 15. I
got a late start and, consequently,
lacked experience.
"My objective was to learn
from the best," Palmieri said.
"After losing a match I watched
the best play their matches.
"I think the only way to learn
is to play with people who are
better than I am," Palmieri said.
"I'd say 'hi' to the top players in
passing and pretty soon they'd
start talking to me. They began to
invite me to play practice rounds with
them ... and they'd give me
advice on my game."
Tournament Wins
In 1971, Palmieri gained
entrance into the NorCal
Performance Rating Invitational
along with 20 other girls, all
winners and runners-up in state
competition. She won with a total
of 157.
The following spring she won
the San Francisco City
Tournament.
The next spring, at age 17, she
became the youngest player to
win the San Francisco City
Tournament. She had a handicap
of two.
"From age 17 to 201 too had a
flat spell ... no good rounds ... I
was scoring between 80 and 82,"
said Palmieri. "This year
everything has fallen together. I've
added 20 to 30 yards off the tee."
In analyzing her improvement
and Cornett's she said, "We are
now hitting greens in regulation
[a par four hole would be two

shots and two putts] instead of
scrambling (two long shots, one
chip, and a put — a difficult game
to keep up."
Curtis Cup
This summer is going to be
important to Palmieri. She is
planning to play only in national
tournaments and has set as her
goal making the Curtis Cup Team
for the 1976 U.S. — British
competition. The top eight U.S.
amateurs are chosen for the team
on the basis of their summer
performance.
"Everything hinges on my
performance this summer," said
Palmieri. "Right now I'm not
thinking past the Curtis Cup
team."
Palmieri leans towards amateur
golf in the future. "It may not be
worth it to go into pro ball," she
said. "If I stay with the amateurs I
can become a lawyer as well. The
summer competition is as good in
the women's amateurs as in the
pros."
Cornett and Palmieri both
expressed a dislike for the policies
of the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW.)

"They're running a sport they
know nothing about," said
Palmieri. "The rules are
inappropriate and aren't
publicized enough. The USGA
allows an amateur to keep up to
$200 in winnings while the AIAW
says we can keep nothing."
"I can't believe it," said
Cornett who has to give up a $100
gift certificate she won recently to
the Salvation Army in order to
remain eligible for college
competition.
TTie players feel that the
NCAA would be a better
organization to handle women's
sports. "The NCAA is established
while the AIAW has no
connections," said Cornett.
Cornett would like to see the
NCAA incorporate women's
sports as a subdivision, but
Palmieri expressed the fear that
women's sports might receive less
emphasis than men's if that
happened.
Despite the complicated rules
and regulations in women's
amateur golf, Cornett and
Palmieri both contend that "it's
the best sport" for them because
"the score speaks for itself."

Tournament, her first collegiate
win, and place third in the
California collegiate competition
behind the top two juniors in the
nation.
"There's been a complete
turnaround, it's unreal ..." said
Cornett.
In addition to her new game,
Cornett attributes her comeback
to a book on psychocybernetics,
"the confidence game. When I get
up to a shot, I imagine the best
possible shot... it's a new thing
for me," she said.
When asked if she will turn pro,
Cornett answered, "Never. I don't
like the set-up and there's no Billie

Jean King to fight for something
better. There isn't enough money
and that type of life doesn't
appeal to me."
Cornett does plan to continue
in the amateurs however, and next
year will receive one of the first
women's athletic scholarships ever
given by the University.
Palmieri Past
Palmieri began playing golf
later than Cornett. At age 13 she
was introduced to the game by
her father and since then has had
several pros.
For the last five years, Palmieri
has received instruction from
John Geertsen Sr., Johnny Miller's
pro. "When I started with
Geertsen my handicap was 11.
One year later I had a handicap of
three," Palmieri said.
Palmieri did not begin playing
in the juniors until she was 15. I
got a late start and, consequently,
lacked experience.
"My objective was to learn
from the best," Palmieri said.
"After losing a match I watched
the best play their matches.
"I think the only way to learn
is to play with people who are
better than I am," Palmieri said.
"I'd say 'hi' to the top players in
passing and pretty soon they'd
start talking to me. They began to
invite me to play practice rounds with
them ... and they'd give me
advice on my game."
Tournament Wins
In 1971, Palmieri gained
entrance into the NorCal
Performance Rating Invitational
along with 20 other girls, all
winners and runners-up in state
competition. She won with a total
of 157.
The following spring she won
the San Francisco City
Tournament.
The next spring, at age 17, she
became the youngest player to
win the San Francisco City
Tournament. She had a handicap
of two.
"From age 17 to 201 too had a
flat spell ... no good rounds ... I
was scoring between 80 and 82,"
said Palmieri. "This year
everything has fallen together. I've
added 20 to 30 yards off the tee."
In analyzing her improvement
and Cornett's she said, "We are
now hitting greens in regulation
[a par four hole would be two

shots and two putts] instead of
scrambling (two long shots, one
chip, and a put — a difficult game
to keep up."
Curtis Cup
This summer is going to be
important to Palmieri. She is
planning to play only in national
tournaments and has set as her
goal making the Curtis Cup Team
for the 1976 U.S. — British
competition. The top eight U.S.
amateurs are chosen for the team
on the basis of their summer
performance.
"Everything hinges on my
performance this summer," said
Palmieri. "Right now I'm not
thinking past the Curtis Cup
team."
Palmieri leans towards amateur
golf in the future. "It may not be
worth it to go into pro ball," she
said. "If I stay with the amateurs I
can become a lawyer as well. The
summer competition is as good in
the women's amateurs as in the
pros."
Cornett and Palmieri both
expressed a dislike for the policies
of the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW.)

"They're running a sport they
know nothing about," said
Palmieri. "The rules are
inappropriate and aren't
publicized enough. The USGA
allows an amateur to keep up to
$200 in winnings while the AIAW
says we can keep nothing."
"I can't believe it," said
Cornett who has to give up a $100
gift certificate she won recently to
the Salvation Army in order to
remain eligible for college
competition.
TTie players feel that the
NCAA would be a better
organization to handle women's
sports. "The NCAA is established
while the AIAW has no
connections," said Cornett.
Cornett would like to see the
NCAA incorporate women's
sports as a subdivision, but
Palmieri expressed the fear that
women's sports might receive less
emphasis than men's if that
happened.
Despite the complicated rules
and regulations in women's
amateur golf, Cornett and
Palmieri both contend that "it's
the best sport" for them because
"the score speaks for itself."

PAM PALMIERI
Pat Cornett and Pam Palmieri,
Stanford's top two women
golfers, have both overcome a
two-year slump, and are working
"to swing harder, hit the b II
further and get more aggressive
out there ...Their efforts are
paying off and it looks as though
they will lead Stanford to the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) title and
make a fine showing nationally as
well.
Both Cornett and Palmieri have
an impressive record of work and
wins.
Cornett, a 21-year-old junior,
began playing golf at age 11,
receiving instruction from her
Salinas pro. She entered the state
competition and virtually
dominated junior tournaments for
the next six years.
At age 16 Cornett won nine
Northern California tournaments,
qualified with 31 other players for
the United States Golf
Association (USGA) junior
nationals and reached the semis in
the state finals.
"After the juniors I hit a
college slump," Cornett said. "For
two years .. . nothing."
Last Christmas Cornett turned
to her pro, Cotton Kaiser, for help
with her game. Up to that time
she had been playing "a chipping
and putting game, relying heavily
on accuracy."
Long Game
"In college I didn't have the
time necessary to keep my short
game up," said Comett,
explaining her slump.
Kaiser concentrated on her
long game. "Before, I had been a
very accurate player but very
short off the tee. Cotton had me
hitting the ball harder, being more
aggressive ..."
Cornett cited a loss of
confidence as a second reason for
her slump. "At home you get
support and encouragement," she
said. "Here no one knows you're
good and the burden of proof's on
you ..."
Things began to pick up last
year. In Tucson, at the University
of Arizona Invitational, Cornett
finished fourth. "I could see
things coming around ... I had
finished behind some super
players," she said.
City Crown
Then she won the San
Francisco City Tournament, her
first amateur win, defeating
defending champ Cheryl Pastore.
She went on to win the Arizona
State University Sun Devil
Tournament, her first collegiate
win, and place third in the
California collegiate competition
behind the top two juniors in the
nation.

the San Francisco City
Tournament.
The next spring, at age 17, she
became the youngest player to
win the San Francisco City
Tournament. She had a handicap
of two.
"From age 17 to 201 too had a
flat spell ... no good rounds ... I
was scoring between 80 and 82,"
said Palmieri. "This year
everything has fallen together. I've
added 20 to 30 yards off the tee."
In analyzing her improvement
and Cornett's she said, "We are
now hitting greens in regulation
[a par four hole would be two

shots and two putts] instead of
scrambling (two long shots, one
chip, and a put — a difficult game
to keep up."
Curtis Cup
This summer is going to be
important to Palmieri. She is
planning to play only in national
tournaments and has set as her
goal making the Curtis Cup Team
for the 1976 U.S. — British
competition. The top eight U.S.
amateurs are chosen for the team
on the basis of their summer
performance.
"Everything hinges on my
performance this summer," said
Palmieri. "Right now I'm not
thinking past the Curtis Cup
team."
Palmieri leans towards amateur
golf in the future. "It may not be
worth it to go into pro ball," she
said. "If I stay with the amateurs I
can become a lawyer as well. The
summer competition is as good in
the women's amateurs as in the
pros."
Cornett and Palmieri both
expressed a dislike for the policies
of the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW.)

"They're running a sport they
know nothing about," said
Palmieri. "The rules are
inappropriate and aren't
publicized enough. The USGA
allows an amateur to keep up to
$200 in winnings while the AIAW
says we can keep nothing."
"I can't believe it," said
Cornett who has to give up a $100
gift certificate she won recently to
the Salvation Army in order to
remain eligible for college
competition.
TTie players feel that the
NCAA would be a better
organization to handle women's
sports. "The NCAA is established
while the AIAW has no
connections," said Cornett.
Cornett would like to see the
NCAA incorporate women's
sports as a subdivision, but
Palmieri expressed the fear that
women's sports might receive less
emphasis than men's if that
happened.
Despite the complicated rules
and regulations in women's
amateur golf, Cornett and
Palmieri both contend that "it's
the best sport" for them because
"the score speaks for itself."

PAM PALMIERI
Pat Cornett and Pam Palmieri,
Stanford's top two women
golfers, have both overcome a
two-year slump, and are working
"to swing harder, hit the b II
further and get more aggressive
out there ...Their efforts are
paying off and it looks as though
they will lead Stanford to the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) title and
make a fine showing nationally as
well.
Both Cornett and Palmieri have
an impressive record of work and
wins.
Cornett, a 21-year-old junior,
began playing golf at age 11,
receiving instruction from her
Salinas pro. She entered the state
competition and virtually
dominated junior tournaments for
the next six years.
At age 16 Cornett won nine
Northern California tournaments,
qualified with 31 other players for
the United States Golf
Association (USGA) junior
nationals and reached the semis in
the state finals.
"After the juniors I hit a
college slump," Cornett said. "For
two years .. . nothing."
Last Christmas Cornett turned
to her pro, Cotton Kaiser, for help
with her game. Up to that time
she had been playing "a chipping
and putting game, relying heavily
on accuracy."
Long Game
"In college I didn't have the
time necessary to keep my short
game up," said Comett,
explaining her slump.
Kaiser concentrated on her
long game. "Before, I had been a
very accurate player but very
short off the tee. Cotton had me
hitting the ball harder, being more
aggressive ..."
Cornett cited a loss of
confidence as a second reason for
her slump. "At home you get
support and encouragement," she
said. "Here no one knows you're
good and the burden of proof's on
you ..."
Things began to pick up last
year. In Tucson, at the University
of Arizona Invitational, Cornett
finished fourth. "I could see
things coming around ... I had
finished behind some super
players," she said.
City Crown
Then she won the San
Francisco City Tournament, her
first amateur win, defeating
defending champ Cheryl Pastore.
She went on to win the Arizona
State University Sun Devil
Tournament, her first collegiate
win, and place third in the
California collegiate competition
behind the top two juniors in the
nation.
"There's been a complete
turnaround, it's unreal ..." said
Cornett.
In addition to her new game,
Cornett attributes her comeback
to a book on psychocybernetics,
"the confidence game. When I get
up to a shot, I imagine the best
possible shot... it's a new thing
for me," she said.
When asked if she will turn pro,
Cornett answered, "Never. I don't
like the set-up and there's no Billie

Jean King to fight for something
better. There isn't enough money
and that type of life doesn't
appeal to me."
Cornett does plan to continue
in the amateurs however, and next
year will receive one of the first
women's athletic scholarships ever
given by the University.
Palmieri Past
Palmieri began playing golf
later than Cornett. At age 13 she
was introduced to the game by
her father and since then has had
several pros.
For the last five years, Palmieri
has received instruction from
John Geertsen Sr., Johnny Miller's
pro. "When I started with
Geertsen my handicap was 11.
One year later I had a handicap of
three," Palmieri said.
Palmieri did not begin playing
in the juniors until she was 15. I
got a late start and, consequently,
lacked experience.
"My objective was to learn
from the best," Palmieri said.
"After losing a match I watched
the best play their matches.
"I think the only way to learn
is to play with people who are
better than I am," Palmieri said.
"I'd say 'hi' to the top players in
passing and pretty soon they'd
start talking to me. They began to
invite me to play practice rounds with
them ... and they'd give me
advice on my game."
Tournament Wins
In 1971, Palmieri gained
entrance into the NorCal
Performance Rating Invitational
along with 20 other girls, all
winners and runners-up in state
competition. She won with a total
of 157.
The following spring she won
the San Francisco City
Tournament.
The next spring, at age 17, she
became the youngest player to

PAM PALMIERI
Pat Cornett and Pam Palmieri,
Stanford's top two women
golfers, have both overcome a
two-year slump, and are working
"to swing harder, hit the b II
further and get more aggressive
out there ...Their efforts are
paying off and it looks as though
they will lead Stanford to the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) title and
make a fine showing nationally as
well.
Both Cornett and Palmieri have
an impressive record of work and
wins.
Cornett, a 21-year-old junior,
began playing golf at age 11,
receiving instruction from her
Salinas pro. She entered the state
competition and virtually
dominated junior tournaments for
the next six years.
At age 16 Cornett won nine
Northern California tournaments,
qualified with 31 other players for
the United States Golf
Association (USGA) junior
nationals and reached the semis in
the state finals.
"After the juniors I hit a
college slump," Cornett said. "For
two years .. . nothing."
Last Christmas Cornett turned
to her pro, Cotton Kaiser, for help
with her game. Up to that time
she had been playing "a chipping
and putting game, relying heavily
on accuracy."
Long Game
"In college I didn't have the
time necessary to keep my short
game up," said Comett,
explaining her slump.
Kaiser concentrated on her
long game. "Before, I had been a
very accurate player but very
short off the tee. Cotton had me
hitting the ball harder, being more
aggressive ..."
Cornett cited a loss of
confidence as a second reason for
her slump. "At home you get
support and encouragement," she
said. "Here no one knows you're
good and the burden of proof's on
you ..."
Things began to pick up last
year. In Tucson, at the University
of Arizona Invitational, Cornett
finished fourth. "I could see
things coming around ... I had
finished behind some super
players," she said.
City Crown
Then she won the San
Francisco City Tournament, her
first amateur win, defeating
defending champ Cheryl Pastore.
She went on to win the Arizona
State University Sun Devil
Tournament, her first collegiate
win, and place third in the
California collegiate competition
behind the top two juniors in the
nation.
"There's been a complete
turnaround, it's unreal ..." said
Cornett.
In addition to her new game,
Cornett attributes her comeback
to a book on psychocybernetics,
"the confidence game. When I get
up to a shot, I imagine the best
possible shot... it's a new thing
for me," she said.
When asked if she will turn pro,
Cornett answered, "Never. I don't
like the set-up and there's no Billie

Jean King to fight for something
better. There isn't enough money
and that type of life doesn't
appeal to me."
Cornett does plan to continue
in the amateurs however, and next
year will receive one of the first
women's athletic scholarships ever
given by the University.
Palmieri Past
Palmieri began playing golf
later than Cornett. At age 13 she
was introduced to the game by
her father and since then has had
several pros.
For the last five years, Palmieri
has received instruction from
John Geertsen Sr., Johnny Miller's
pro. "When I started with
Geertsen my handicap was 11.
One year later I had a handicap of
three," Palmieri said.
Palmieri did not begin playing
in the juniors until she was 15. I
got a late start and, consequently,
lacked experience.
"My objective was to learn
from the best," Palmieri said.
"After losing a match I watched
the best play their matches.
"I think the only way to learn
is to play with people who are
better than I am," Palmieri said.
"I'd say 'hi' to the top players in
passing and pretty soon they'd
start talking to me. They began to
invite me to play practice rounds with
them ... and they'd give me
advice on my game."
Tournament Wins
In 1971, Palmieri gained
entrance into the NorCal
Performance Rating Invitational
along with 20 other girls, all
winners and runners-up in state
competition. She won with a total
of 157.
The following spring she won
the San Francisco City
Tournament.
The next spring, at age 17, she
became the youngest player to
win the San Francisco City
Tournament. She had a handicap
of two.
"From age 17 to 201 too had a
flat spell ... no good rounds ... I
was scoring between 80 and 82,"
said Palmieri. "This year
everything has fallen together. I've
added 20 to 30 yards off the tee."
In analyzing her improvement
and Cornett's she said, "We are
now hitting greens in regulation
[a par four hole would be two

shots and two putts] instead of
scrambling (two long shots, one
chip, and a put — a difficult game
to keep up."
Curtis Cup
This summer is going to be
important to Palmieri. She is
planning to play only in national
tournaments and has set as her
goal making the Curtis Cup Team
for the 1976 U.S. — British
competition. The top eight U.S.
amateurs are chosen for the team
on the basis of their summer
performance.
"Everything hinges on my
performance this summer," said
Palmieri. "Right now I'm not
thinking past the Curtis Cup
team."
Palmieri leans towards amateur
golf in the future. "It may not be
worth it to go into pro ball," she
said. "If I stay with the amateurs I
can become a lawyer as well. The
summer competition is as good in
the women's amateurs as in the
pros."
Cornett and Palmieri both
expressed a dislike for the policies
of the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW.)

"They're running a sport they
know nothing about," said
Palmieri. "The rules are
inappropriate and aren't
publicized enough. The USGA
allows an amateur to keep up to
$200 in winnings while the AIAW
says we can keep nothing."
"I can't believe it," said
Cornett who has to give up a $100
gift certificate she won recently to
the Salvation Army in order to
remain eligible for college
competition.
TTie players feel that the
NCAA would be a better
organization to handle women's
sports. "The NCAA is established
while the AIAW has no
connections," said Cornett.
Cornett would like to see the
NCAA incorporate women's
sports as a subdivision, but
Palmieri expressed the fear that
women's sports might receive less
emphasis than men's if that
happened.
