# Cardinal Knowledge
## Delaney Moving 
### Ron Beck 
It's down to Ojai this weekend for the tennis
team. Last year, winning the Ojai Intercollegiate
Tournament for the third consecutive time was just
another step on the way to the NCAA crown for
the Cards, but this year Ojai won't hold any
significance for Stanford.
That's not saying that the Cards don't have a
chance to repeat as NCAA champs, it's just that
Stanford isn't (and doesn't deserve to be) the
favorite at Ojai. UCLA holds that honor after last
weekend's dual matches, but Stanford might still
have had a chance to win the tourney if it weren't
for a rash of injuries.
Missing the tourney are Nick Saviano,
recuperating from a groin muscle injury, and Gene
Mayer, who, while recovering from his back injury,
will be attending the wedding of his brother,
Sandy.
John Whitlinger and Pat DuPre are both playing,
despite Whitlinger's sore shoulder and DuPre's
tendonitis. Rounding out the Stanford entries are
Jim Delaney, Bill Maze, Mark Mitchell and Craig
Johnson.
Of the Cards entered in the tourney, Delaney
has the most at stake. With a good showing at Ojai,
Delaney will earn a much-deserved opportunity to
move up on the ladder. After last weekend,
Delaney has received a lot of attention, most of it
specifically directed at his low position on the
ladder.
"I'm at the top of my game right now, and I
think I'm still going up and up," Delaney told the

Falo Alto Times. "I've got the momentum and
confidence going for me."
Delaney moved up to the number one singles
spot on the team after last year's Ojai tournament,
and appears headed upwards now.
Delaney's first real "pressure" match of the year
came last Saturday in the final match of the USC
battle. Delaney and Whitlinger played Butch Walts
and Bruce Manson in Maples in the deciding first
doubles duel. Walts had just bombed his way past a
surprised Whitlinger, and Manson had lost to
Saviano in three sets.
So it was up to the Stanford pair, and Whitlinger
and Delaney came through with an exciting 6-2, 6-2
win to secure the Cardinal victory. "I like those
tough do-or-die matches," explained Delaney. But
Delaney refuses to take full credit for the win.
"Walts wasn't serving like he did to Whit. In
doubles it's crucial that you get your first serve in,
so Walts took a lot off his serve. Whit would've
done a lot better against Butch if he had served like
that in the singles."
Whitlinger puts the pair's doubles playing into
adequate perspective. "Delaney and I are one hell
of a doubles team," he says succinctly.
With challenge matches starting next week in
preparation for the Pac-8 and NCAA tourneys,
Delaney is ready for some good playing. For his last
few months of playing for Stanford, Delaney is
peaking just perfectly. "I'm as confident as I can
be," he says, and it's easy to see that he isn't just
dreaming.

spot on the team after last year's Ojai tournament,
and appears headed upwards now.
Delaney's first real "pressure" match of the year
came last Saturday in the final match of the USC
battle. Delaney and Whitlinger played Butch Walts
and Bruce Manson in Maples in the deciding first
doubles duel. Walts had just bombed his way past a
surprised Whitlinger, and Manson had lost to
Saviano in three sets.
So it was up to the Stanford pair, and Whitlinger
and Delaney came through with an exciting 6-2, 6-2
win to secure the Cardinal victory. "I like those
tough do-or-die matches," explained Delaney. But
Delaney refuses to take full credit for the win.
"Walts wasn't serving like he did to Whit. In
doubles it's crucial that you get your first serve in,
so Walts took a lot off his serve. Whit would've
done a lot better against Butch if he had served like
that in the singles."
Whitlinger puts the pair's doubles playing into
adequate perspective. "Delaney and I are one hell
of a doubles team," he says succinctly.
With challenge matches starting next week in
preparation for the Pac-8 and NCAA tourneys,
Delaney is ready for some good playing. For his last
few months of playing for Stanford, Delaney is
peaking just perfectly. "I'm as confident as I can
be," he says, and it's easy to see that he isn't just
dreaming.

It's down to Ojai this weekend for the tennis
team. Last year, winning the Ojai Intercollegiate
Tournament for the third consecutive time was just
another step on the way to the NCAA crown for
the Cards, but this year Ojai won't hold any
significance for Stanford.
That's not saying that the Cards don't have a
chance to repeat as NCAA champs, it's just that
Stanford isn't (and doesn't deserve to be) the
favorite at Ojai. UCLA holds that honor after last
weekend's dual matches, but Stanford might still
have had a chance to win the tourney if it weren't
for a rash of injuries.
Missing the tourney are Nick Saviano,
recuperating from a groin muscle injury, and Gene
Mayer, who, while recovering from his back injury,
will be attending the wedding of his brother,
Sandy.
John Whitlinger and Pat DuPre are both playing,
despite Whitlinger's sore shoulder and DuPre's
tendonitis. Rounding out the Stanford entries are
Jim Delaney, Bill Maze, Mark Mitchell and Craig
Johnson.
Of the Cards entered in the tourney, Delaney
has the most at stake. With a good showing at Ojai,
Delaney will earn a much-deserved opportunity to
move up on the ladder. After last weekend,
Delaney has received a lot of attention, most of it
specifically directed at his low position on the
ladder.
"I'm at the top of my game right now, and I
think I'm still going up and up," Delaney told the

Falo Alto Times. "I've got the momentum and
confidence going for me."
Delaney moved up to the number one singles
spot on the team after last year's Ojai tournament,
