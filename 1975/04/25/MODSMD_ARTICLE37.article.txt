PRG Probes Saigon Defenses
SAIGON — Communist-led troops launched
sharp attacks against South Vietnamese units near a
district town only 25 miles west of here, the Saigon
command reported yesterday.
The actions yesterday appeared to be part of a
probing and softening-up operation against this
tense capital's outer defenses.
The new military activity came as attempts to
form a government in Saigon that the PRG might
deal with hit a snag. Sources said the man with the
best chance of putting together such a cabinet, Gen.
Duong Van "Big" Minh, turned down an offer to
take over as premier "with full powers" and was
intent on nothing less than the presidency.
The top office in Saigon now is held by Tran Van
Huong, who succeeded the resigned Nguyen Van
Thieu as president at the beginning of the week.
Evacuation Bill Dispute Settled
WASHINGTON — Senate and House conferees
tentatively agreed yesterday on a $3.27 million
humanitarian aid-evacuation bill authorizing
restricted use of U.S. troops if necessary in South
Vietnam.
The conference will meet again today for final
acceptance of language to be drafted overnight.
Members of the conference said a contingency
fund written into a Senate-passed bill was dropped
in favor of giving the President the right to use $177
million of previously authorized funds at his
discretion for evacuation, humanitarian relief or
both.
Conferees said they agreed to channel $150
million in new humanitarian aid authorization
through international relief agencies or voluntary
agencies, not specifically the United Nations.
Senate restrictions on the use of troops to
evacuate foreign nationals, including endangered
South Vietnamese, reportedly were retained.
That would limit the number, duration of service
and geographical deployment of troops for foreign
national evacuation to those required for the
evacuation of Americans.
Admission May Not Reach Jury
SACRAMENTO — The sensational testimony of

convict Clifford "Death Row Jeff" Jefferson may
have no effect on the murder trial of two
Symbionese Liberation Army members, the chief
prosecutor said yesterday.
"Evidence is what you give to a jury," Dist. Atty.
Lowell Jensen of Alameda County told a reporter.
The jury was absent Wednesday when Jefferson,
a convicted murderer serving a life sentence, claimed
to have ordered the Nov. 6, 1973, assassination of
Marcus Foster, Oakland's superintendent of schools.
He said he gave the death order to slain SLA
member William Wolfe a month before Foster was
killed. Trial defendants Russell Little and Joseph
Remiro, both avowed SLA members, are innocent,
Jefferson said.
Unless Jefferson is called back to the stand, the
jury may never hear his story. Both Jensen and
public defender James Jenner, who represents
Little, hedged when asked if they would call
Jefferson as a witness.
Remiro's attorney, Edward Merrill, was more
positive.
"He may not be the most substantial witness in
the world," Merrill told reporters before entering
court."I certainly would not put him on the stand
as my witness."
Damage Suit Filed In Zebra Case
SAN FRANCISCO — Two black couples who
were held at gunpoint while police searched their
apartment for alleged Zebra slaying suspects filed a
$2.6 million damage suit against San Francisco and
police officials yesterday.
The civil rights action asks $600,000 each in
punitive damages and $60,000 each in
compensatory damages for Andre Mazedon, 21, his
wife Mabel, 22; James Eskridge, 22, and his wife
Monica, 22.
Meanwhile, the Zebra murder trial reconvened
yesterday after testimony from chief prosecution
witness Anthony Harris that he quit working for
Black Self Help because "I was tired of people
getting killed."
West German Embassy Bombed
STOCKHOLM — Radical urban guerrillas took
over the West German embassy yesterday, killed one

man and grabbed up to a dozen hostages, then
blasted the top of the besieged structure into rubble
and flame to cover a futile escape attempt.
Police said they captured all seven radicals
known to be in the building before the Explosions
began shortly before midnight yesterday — 4 p.m.
PDT — and one who apparently had attempted
suicide died in a hospital.
Authorities said one hostage was shot and killed
at about 10:40 p.m., shortly after passage of a
guerrilla deadline for the release of comrades
imprisoned in West Germany. The Bonn government
had refused to yield to the demands.
•
Several other hostages were wounded in the
midnight blasts, which sent flames belching from
upper-story windows, but the West German
ambassador and at least one other man and two
women escaped unhurt or with minor burns. A
number of police and firemen were reported
injured.
Six radicals were captured after a brief shootout,
police said, and another was taken after being
pinned down by police fire in the burning four-story
embassy.
Joanne Little Charge Stands
WASHINGTON, D.C. — A judge denied two
defense motions yesterday seeking dismissal of a
murder charge against Joanne Little, a young black
woman accused of the stabbing death of a white
jailer.
Superior Court Judge Henry McKinnon said the
defense had not shown the state acted improperly
before the grand jury, alleged in one motion.
A second sought dismissal on the grounds the
state acted in bad faith by not granting Little a
preliminary hearing. The judge also refused a third
motion asking for such a hearing.
Today's Weather
Variable clouds with showers likely today.
Becoming mostly fair tonight and tomorrow. A
little cooler. Lows in the 40s. Highs both days in the
mid 50s to low 60s.

PRG Probes Saigon Defenses
SAIGON — Communist-led troops launched
sharp attacks against South Vietnamese units near a
district town only 25 miles west of here, the Saigon
command reported yesterday.
The actions yesterday appeared to be part of a
probing and softening-up operation against this
tense capital's outer defenses.
The new military activity came as attempts to
form a government in Saigon that the PRG might
deal with hit a snag. Sources said the man with the
best chance of putting together such a cabinet, Gen.
Duong Van "Big" Minh, turned down an offer to
take over as premier "with full powers" and was
intent on nothing less than the presidency.
The top office in Saigon now is held by Tran Van
Huong, who succeeded the resigned Nguyen Van
Thieu as president at the beginning of the week.
Evacuation Bill Dispute Settled
WASHINGTON — Senate and House conferees
tentatively agreed yesterday on a $3.27 million
humanitarian aid-evacuation bill authorizing
restricted use of U.S. troops if necessary in South
Vietnam.
The conference will meet again today for final
acceptance of language to be drafted overnight.
Members of the conference said a contingency
fund written into a Senate-passed bill was dropped
in favor of giving the President the right to use $177
million of previously authorized funds at his
discretion for evacuation, humanitarian relief or
both.
Conferees said they agreed to channel $150
million in new humanitarian aid authorization
through international relief agencies or voluntary
agencies, not specifically the United Nations.
Senate restrictions on the use of troops to
evacuate foreign nationals, including endangered
South Vietnamese, reportedly were retained.
That would limit the number, duration of service
and geographical deployment of troops for foreign
national evacuation to those required for the
evacuation of Americans.
Admission May Not Reach Jury
SACRAMENTO — The sensational testimony of

convict Clifford "Death Row Jeff" Jefferson may
have no effect on the murder trial of two
Symbionese Liberation Army members, the chief
prosecutor said yesterday.
"Evidence is what you give to a jury," Dist. Atty.
Lowell Jensen of Alameda County told a reporter.
The jury was absent Wednesday when Jefferson,
a convicted murderer serving a life sentence, claimed
to have ordered the Nov. 6, 1973, assassination of
Marcus Foster, Oakland's superintendent of schools.
He said he gave the death order to slain SLA
member William Wolfe a month before Foster was
killed. Trial defendants Russell Little and Joseph
Remiro, both avowed SLA members, are innocent,
Jefferson said.
Unless Jefferson is called back to the stand, the
jury may never hear his story. Both Jensen and
public defender James Jenner, who represents
Little, hedged when asked if they would call
Jefferson as a witness.
Remiro's attorney, Edward Merrill, was more
positive.
"He may not be the most substantial witness in
the world," Merrill told reporters before entering
court."I certainly would not put him on the stand
as my witness."
Damage Suit Filed In Zebra Case
SAN FRANCISCO — Two black couples who
were held at gunpoint while police searched their
apartment for alleged Zebra slaying suspects filed a
$2.6 million damage suit against San Francisco and
police officials yesterday.
The civil rights action asks $600,000 each in
punitive damages and $60,000 each in
compensatory damages for Andre Mazedon, 21, his
wife Mabel, 22; James Eskridge, 22, and his wife
Monica, 22.
Meanwhile, the Zebra murder trial reconvened
yesterday after testimony from chief prosecution
witness Anthony Harris that he quit working for
Black Self Help because "I was tired of people
getting killed."
West German Embassy Bombed
STOCKHOLM — Radical urban guerrillas took
over the West German embassy yesterday, killed one

man and grabbed up to a dozen hostages, then
blasted the top of the besieged structure into rubble
and flame to cover a futile escape attempt.
Police said they captured all seven radicals
known to be in the building before the Explosions
began shortly before midnight yesterday — 4 p.m.
PDT — and one who apparently had attempted
suicide died in a hospital.
Authorities said one hostage was shot and killed
at about 10:40 p.m., shortly after passage of a
guerrilla deadline for the release of comrades
imprisoned in West Germany. The Bonn government
had refused to yield to the demands.
•
Several other hostages were wounded in the
midnight blasts, which sent flames belching from
upper-story windows, but the West German
ambassador and at least one other man and two
women escaped unhurt or with minor burns. A
number of police and firemen were reported
injured.
Six radicals were captured after a brief shootout,
police said, and another was taken after being
pinned down by police fire in the burning four-story
embassy.
Joanne Little Charge Stands
WASHINGTON, D.C. — A judge denied two

injured.
Six radicals were captured after a brief shootout,
police said, and another was taken after being
pinned down by police fire in the burning four-story
embassy.
Joanne Little Charge Stands
WASHINGTON, D.C. — A judge denied two
defense motions yesterday seeking dismissal of a
murder charge against Joanne Little, a young black
woman accused of the stabbing death of a white
jailer.
Superior Court Judge Henry McKinnon said the
defense had not shown the state acted improperly
before the grand jury, alleged in one motion.
A second sought dismissal on the grounds the
state acted in bad faith by not granting Little a
preliminary hearing. The judge also refused a third
motion asking for such a hearing.
Today's Weather
Variable clouds with showers likely today.
Becoming mostly fair tonight and tomorrow. A
little cooler. Lows in the 40s. Highs both days in the
mid 50s to low 60s.
PRG Probes Saigon Defenses
SAIGON — Communist-led troops launched
sharp attacks against South Vietnamese units near a
district town only 25 miles west of here, the Saigon
command reported yesterday.
The actions yesterday appeared to be part of a
probing and softening-up operation against this
tense capital's outer defenses.
The new military activity came as attempts to
form a government in Saigon that the PRG might
deal with hit a snag. Sources said the man with the
best chance of putting together such a cabinet, Gen.
Duong Van "Big" Minh, turned down an offer to
take over as premier "with full powers" and was
intent on nothing less than the presidency.
The top office in Saigon now is held by Tran Van
Huong, who succeeded the resigned Nguyen Van
Thieu as president at the beginning of the week.
Evacuation Bill Dispute Settled
WASHINGTON — Senate and House conferees
tentatively agreed yesterday on a $3.27 million
humanitarian aid-evacuation bill authorizing
restricted use of U.S. troops if necessary in South
Vietnam.
The conference will meet again today for final
acceptance of language to be drafted overnight.
Members of the conference said a contingency
fund written into a Senate-passed bill was dropped
in favor of giving the President the right to use $177
million of previously authorized funds at his
discretion for evacuation, humanitarian relief or
both.
Conferees said they agreed to channel $150
million in new humanitarian aid authorization
through international relief agencies or voluntary
agencies, not specifically the United Nations.
Senate restrictions on the use of troops to
evacuate foreign nationals, including endangered
South Vietnamese, reportedly were retained.
That would limit the number, duration of service
and geographical deployment of troops for foreign
national evacuation to those required for the
evacuation of Americans.
Admission May Not Reach Jury
SACRAMENTO — The sensational testimony of

convict Clifford "Death Row Jeff" Jefferson may
have no effect on the murder trial of two
Symbionese Liberation Army members, the chief
prosecutor said yesterday.
"Evidence is what you give to a jury," Dist. Atty.
Lowell Jensen of Alameda County told a reporter.
The jury was absent Wednesday when Jefferson,
a convicted murderer serving a life sentence, claimed
to have ordered the Nov. 6, 1973, assassination of
Marcus Foster, Oakland's superintendent of schools.
He said he gave the death order to slain SLA
member William Wolfe a month before Foster was
killed. Trial defendants Russell Little and Joseph
Remiro, both avowed SLA members, are innocent,
Jefferson said.
Unless Jefferson is called back to the stand, the
jury may never hear his story. Both Jensen and
public defender James Jenner, who represents
Little, hedged when asked if they would call
Jefferson as a witness.
Remiro's attorney, Edward Merrill, was more
positive.
"He may not be the most substantial witness in
the world," Merrill told reporters before entering
court."I certainly would not put him on the stand
as my witness."
Damage Suit Filed In Zebra Case
SAN FRANCISCO — Two black couples who
were held at gunpoint while police searched their
apartment for alleged Zebra slaying suspects filed a
$2.6 million damage suit against San Francisco and
police officials yesterday.
The civil rights action asks $600,000 each in
punitive damages and $60,000 each in
compensatory damages for Andre Mazedon, 21, his
wife Mabel, 22; James Eskridge, 22, and his wife
Monica, 22.
Meanwhile, the Zebra murder trial reconvened
yesterday after testimony from chief prosecution
witness Anthony Harris that he quit working for
Black Self Help because "I was tired of people
getting killed."
West German Embassy Bombed
STOCKHOLM — Radical urban guerrillas took
over the West German embassy yesterday, killed one

man and grabbed up to a dozen hostages, then
blasted the top of the besieged structure into rubble
and flame to cover a futile escape attempt.
Police said they captured all seven radicals
known to be in the building before the Explosions
began shortly before midnight yesterday — 4 p.m.
PDT — and one who apparently had attempted
suicide died in a hospital.
Authorities said one hostage was shot and killed
at about 10:40 p.m., shortly after passage of a
guerrilla deadline for the release of comrades
imprisoned in West Germany. The Bonn government
had refused to yield to the demands.
•
Several other hostages were wounded in the
midnight blasts, which sent flames belching from
upper-story windows, but the West German
ambassador and at least one other man and two
women escaped unhurt or with minor burns. A
number of police and firemen were reported
injured.
Six radicals were captured after a brief shootout,
police said, and another was taken after being
pinned down by police fire in the burning four-story
