# New Lecture Note Head Named
## 
### 
Sophomore Jasmine Gunthorpe has
been appointed director of the ASSU
Lecture Notes Service for next year.
Gunthorpe will replace Vic Petroff,
who directed the Service during its
first year. Gunthorpe, who has worked
in the ASSU Special Events office this
year, is working closely with Petroff
this quarter.
Gunthorpe said yesterday that she
hopes to expand the Service. "One of
our biggest problems will be deciding

what courses to cover," she said.
Though she won't automatically
exclude small classes, she said she
"might shy away from smaller classes
because a notetaker might not be as
effective" as in a larger, more
lecture-oriented class.
Finances were necessarily
important this year in order to get the
program off the ground, she said,
admitting she "can't avoid finances
next year" but does hope to place
greater emphasis on the service value
of lecture notes.
"I'd like to think I'm benefiting as
many students as possible," she said.
