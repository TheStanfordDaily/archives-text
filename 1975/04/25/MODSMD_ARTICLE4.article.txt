# Campus, P.A. Fire Depts. Study Possible Merger
## 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
An unofficial study is underway to
determine the feasibility of merging
the Stanford and Palo Alto Fire
Departments.
Palo Alto Battalion Chief Chuck
Challenger two months ago began
collecting statistical data at Stanford
for this purpose. He stated that "by
June 1 we must submit a preliminary
report which would outline the
method of an actual study."
City and University officials will
review the report, and are presently
researching the legal and financial
aspects of a merger.
If an actual study is initiated, it will
investigate the potential redesigning of
the two department's territories,
collective response to emergencies and
cooperative equipment purchasing.
"I'm not going to say that there
should be a merger," said Stanford
Fire Chief Frank Jurian, "but there is
a possibility that we'll save money."
Lower operating costs are the primary
reason for the investigation.
Challenger is studying the financial
position of both departments, the level
of services now offered as opposed to
what could be improved in a joint
operation and the problem areas in

regard to different methods of
operation.
With the aid of Public Technology
Inc., Challenger has divided the two
fire departments into "fire demand
zones" to ascertain how Stanford
equipment could respond in Palo Alto
and vice versa.
Initially the two fire departments
exchanged personnel to try to improve
their daily operations, but earlier this
year, when Stanford Asst. Fire Chief
John Barr spent some time on duty
with the Palo Alto department, a
survey of the merger idea began to
solidify.
One of the problems the two fire
departments will face is the
discrepancy in manpower and salaries.
The highest salary received among
Stanford's 61 firemen is $1197 per
month with retirement at age 65,
while city fire fighters get a top salary
of $1227 per month plus numerous
benefits, and receive retirement
eligibility at age 50.
Beginning in May, Challenger will
work on a part-time basis with Ed
Everett of Palo Alto Budget Services
to complete the preliminary data
analysis.
