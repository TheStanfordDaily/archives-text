# SHOCKLEY UNINTERRUPTED AT TEXAS-EL PASO
## 
### 
After thanking students at the
University of Texas at El Paso for
their restraint, Stanford Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley
said Wednesday the American
welfare system may be making
worse what he believes is already a
genetic disadvantage of blacks.
Shockley's theory is that
intelligence is largely hereditary and
that those with "inferior" genes,
most of whom are blacks, should be
encouraged to undergo sterilization.
"Our welfare system may be
unwittingly downbreeding the
black population toward genetic
enslavement," the Nobel Prize
winner said.
Shockley seems to cause a furor
wherever and whenever he speaks
on his theory of blacks' hereditary
inferiority. For example, in a
speech last week at Yale University,
he was openly booed.
His Texas appearance caused
only mild protests: one picket line
in front of the theater in which he
spoke and some scoffing by
students inside during the speech.
