# Rosenbaum Slate Wins ASSU Council Election
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The Lee Rosenbaum Council of
Presidents (COP) slate scored a
smashing victory in ASSU balloting
which ended yesterday, defeating a
slate headed by Kevin McDermott 59
to 41 percent.
Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane tallied
1397 votes against 964 for
McDermott, Bonny Rodden, Andy
Leuchter and Mark Simonian.
Students also approved the
Committee of 15's (C-15) proposed
new campus judicial system in an
upset. Two previous proposals to
reform the current Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) had been soundly defeated
by students.
The "Stanford Judicial Council"
(SJC) passed by a 769 to 635 margin,
with 1057 abstaining.
In balloting for senior class officers,
slates headed by "Wierd Walt" Spevak
and Dan Poston topped the field and
will meet in a runoff next Wednesday.
Low Turnout
The election turnout of 2461 was
the lowest for a COP runoff since
1963, and fell far short of both last
year's turnout of 3051 and last week's
3325 mark.
The election, however, proved a
victory for the new computer voting
procedure as results were released at
5:50 p.m., less than two hours after
the last polls closed. The two
computer readouts took 49 and 26
minutes respectively.
Galligan said he was "elated with
the results. I think we can offer the
students the kind of leadership they
want."
Takeover
The Rosenbaum slate will take over
the COP offices from Mike Herman,
Quinn Mayer, Ann Carter and Len
Mackey as soon as the ASSU Senate
ratifies the election results, probably
early next month.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald noted that the overseas
ballots have not been returned, though
they will not change the results. The
slates also have to submit financial
statements and remove all campaign
posters by next Friday in order to
avoid being disqualified.
Herman, reacting to the judicial
system vote, termed the result "a
minor miracle considering past
experience with the C-15 and the

media campaign against the measure."
The Daily had opposed the proposal.
Herman added that Academic
Secretary Eric Hutchinson "has
assured me [the Faculty Senate] will
bring it up before the end of this
quarter." Ratification by this body
and approval by President Richard
Lyman is necessary before the SJC will
officially replace the CJP.

The CJP was established by Lyman
in 1971 when student government
refused to appoint members to the
existing Stanford Judicial Council.
The new SJC will consist of three
students and three faculty members,
with two chairmen; a student
chairman will vote to break ties in all
Honor Code cases, while a faculty
chairman will vote to break ties in all
other cases.

The ASSU Senate will select
student members to serve on the SJC
from a randomly compiled list of 24
students who express an interest in
serving.
'Long Way To Go'
Rosenbaum, commenting on the
results of the judicial system balloting,
said "we definitely have a long way to
go before the students will be totally
satisfied."
In the senior class race, the Spevak
slate led with 202 votes, followed
closely by the Poston slate with 199.
Lyse Strnad's slate finished with 162
and the Kay Anderson slate trailed
with 100 votes.
Fitzgerald said that two polling
places will be open from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. next Wednesday in the ASSU
lobby in Tresidder and either at the
Post Office or the Quad's engineering
corner.
Fitzgerald also said that those
results which have been received from
overseas balloting in the primary have
now given the constitutional
amendment to change "sexist"
wording the necessary two-thirds to
pass. However, he noted that all
overseas ballots have not been
returned.
Asst. Elections Commissioner Mike
Murray said there will be a "definite
savings in the long run" by using the
computer balloting system. He noted
that a "major cost in this election was
the [computer] program," which will
be available for use in the future.

minutes respectively.
Galligan said he was "elated with
the results. I think we can offer the
students the kind of leadership they
want."
Takeover
The Rosenbaum slate will take over
the COP offices from Mike Herman,
Quinn Mayer, Ann Carter and Len
Mackey as soon as the ASSU Senate
ratifies the election results, probably
early next month.
Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald noted that the overseas
ballots have not been returned, though
they will not change the results. The
slates also have to submit financial
statements and remove all campaign
posters by next Friday in order to
avoid being disqualified.
Herman, reacting to the judicial
system vote, termed the result "a
minor miracle considering past
experience with the C-15 and the

media campaign against the measure."
The Daily had opposed the proposal.
Herman added that Academic
Secretary Eric Hutchinson "has
assured me [the Faculty Senate] will
bring it up before the end of this
quarter." Ratification by this body
and approval by President Richard
Lyman is necessary before the SJC will
officially replace the CJP.

The CJP was established by Lyman
in 1971 when student government
refused to appoint members to the
existing Stanford Judicial Council.
The new SJC will consist of three
students and three faculty members,
with two chairmen; a student
chairman will vote to break ties in all
Honor Code cases, while a faculty
chairman will vote to break ties in all
other cases.

The ASSU Senate will select
student members to serve on the SJC
from a randomly compiled list of 24
students who express an interest in
serving.
'Long Way To Go'
Rosenbaum, commenting on the
results of the judicial system balloting,
said "we definitely have a long way to
go before the students will be totally
satisfied."
In the senior class race, the Spevak
slate led with 202 votes, followed
closely by the Poston slate with 199.
Lyse Strnad's slate finished with 162
and the Kay Anderson slate trailed
with 100 votes.
Fitzgerald said that two polling
places will be open from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. next Wednesday in the ASSU
lobby in Tresidder and either at the
Post Office or the Quad's engineering
corner.
Fitzgerald also said that those
results which have been received from
overseas balloting in the primary have
now given the constitutional
amendment to change "sexist"
wording the necessary two-thirds to
pass. However, he noted that all
overseas ballots have not been
returned.
Asst. Elections Commissioner Mike
Murray said there will be a "definite
savings in the long run" by using the
computer balloting system. He noted
that a "major cost in this election was
the [computer] program," which will
be available for use in the future.
The Lee Rosenbaum Council of
Presidents (COP) slate scored a
smashing victory in ASSU balloting
which ended yesterday, defeating a
slate headed by Kevin McDermott 59
to 41 percent.
Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane tallied
1397 votes against 964 for
McDermott, Bonny Rodden, Andy
Leuchter and Mark Simonian.
Students also approved the
Committee of 15's (C-15) proposed
new campus judicial system in an
upset. Two previous proposals to
reform the current Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) had been soundly defeated
by students.
The "Stanford Judicial Council"
(SJC) passed by a 769 to 635 margin,
with 1057 abstaining.
In balloting for senior class officers,
slates headed by "Wierd Walt" Spevak
and Dan Poston topped the field and
will meet in a runoff next Wednesday.
Low Turnout
The election turnout of 2461 was
the lowest for a COP runoff since
1963, and fell far short of both last
year's turnout of 3051 and last week's
3325 mark.
The election, however, proved a
victory for the new computer voting
procedure as results were released at
5:50 p.m., less than two hours after
the last polls closed. The two
computer readouts took 49 and 26
minutes respectively.
Galligan said he was "elated with
the results. I think we can offer the
students the kind of leadership they
want."
