# Stiff Writing Tests To Greet Freshmen
## 
### BILL MacDOUGALL 
Freshman English will be more "professional" next year and the
undergraduate writing requirements will be stiffer, reports English Prof. Wilfred
Stone.
As part of the toughening, incoming students who scored over 700 on the
College Entrance Examination Board English achievement test also will be
required to pass an English Department writing test to be exempted from
Stanford's writing requirement.
Previously such students were automatically exempted.
Stone, who resumed directorship of Freshman English this year after a
12-year absence, said the achievement test is "not a writing test."
As in the past, incoming students who score four or five on the English
Advanced Placement test will be exempted from the requirement, while other
students who score below 700 on the achievement test will be required to take

Freshman English.
Next year 19 sections of Freshman
English will bo taught by regular
faculty, compared with seven this year
and fewer in previous years. All regular
English faculty will be required to
teach two sections of Freshman
English every three years.
As in the past, however, most
writing classes will be taught by
graduate students. But Stone says the
training of graduate students in
teaching methods will be improved.
The one-quarter, six-unit writing
workshops now offered will be
eliminated next year in favor of
two-quarter, three-unit classes, which
most students now take.
Stone says that though both types
of workshops theoretically require the
same amount of writing, the duration
of the course is related to its
effectiveness.
Stone says non-administrative
activities of the Undergraduate Writing
Program (UWP) will be "completely
absorbed" by the English Department
next year, but that writing sections
associated with courses in other
departments — one of the UWP's
innovations — will be increased next
year.
The UWP will continue to conduct
its current administrative functions —
such as supervising the writing
requirement — for one more year.
