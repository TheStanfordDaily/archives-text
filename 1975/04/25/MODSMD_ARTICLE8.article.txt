# Rabbi Familant Resigns Hillel Post
## 
### RIV WEBER 
Rabbi Charles Familant, director of Stanford Hillel,
announced his resignation yesterday, effective at the end of
spring quarter.
"I have decided to go into private counseling," said
Familant. He is interested in teaching, but says positions are
not available at this time.
Rick Mills, a member of the Hillel Council, reported that
Familant sent an official letter of resignation to the
National Hillel Foundation in Washington. D.C., on April
14.
Following receipt of this letter, the Foundation has sent
resumes of acceptable replacements to Stanford.
A meeting has been planned for next Wednesday to
discuss the qualities Council members consider important in
a director. The resumes should arrive in about a week, at
which time they will be available to faculty and students in
the Hillel office.
Changed Mind
Although Familant last year had indicated he would
resign at the end of this year, he rescinded his decision in
early March.
The change incited many members of the Stanford
Jewish community to contact the National Hillel

Foundation. There was discussion of starting an alternative
organization through the Jewish Students of Stanford.
Mills, however, noted that Familant's latest decision
"was not made at the peak of pressure." Familant has
discussed becoming a counselor for some time.
Council member Brad Levin said Familant "had gotten
into counseling" rather than "student activity directing."
Emphasized Education
Doug Krohn, Council member and editor of the
quarterly Jewish magazine, On One Foot, said he is
"ambivalent" about the resignation. He noted that
"Familant has emphasized the education role of Hillel."
Krohn cited Familant's achievements in adding Jewish
Studies, Hebrew and Yiddish to the Stanford curriculum.
He described the Rabbi as "low-keyed," and "scholastic."
said that Familant relates well with other people,
but that Hillel would be "revitalized" with the introduction
of a new director.
"He didn't inspire people to do anything," said Mills.
"He sees himself as a counselor." Mills cited "the charisma
and ability to inspire people" as qualities he would seek in a
new director. The director must be "the public
representative of the Jewish community at Stanford," he
said.
