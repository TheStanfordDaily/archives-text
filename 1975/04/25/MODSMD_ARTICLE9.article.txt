## One Year Later 
### 
As the new ASSU Council of Presidents celebrates its
victory today, its members might take time to reflect on the
achievement and shortcomings of the outgoing Council.
When campaigning last spring, Mike Herman, Ann Carter,
Len Mackey and Quinn Mayer promised a variety of student
services. One year later, a good percentage of these, though
not all, have been achieved.
Two major proposals which the Council implemented
were the beginning of the ASSU Lecture Notes Service,
which has been a success, and the institution of a
Stanford-in-Stanford residential college.
The Council also followed through on its proposal for a
record co-op (which was to be the base for a complete
student store), only to have a fee assessment for it voted
down by the student body.
In other areas, we note, the Council did not fulfill its
promises. For example, it did not follow through on either a
weekly bulletin of campus events or an "intellectual union."
Nonetheless, we think the Council made a solid effort to live
up to its campaign platform, regardless of how we feel about
the individual proposals contained in the platform.
We would like to single out for praise the efforts of Vice
President Mayer in organizing a student lobbying campaign
to get the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to retain group
affinity charter flights, such as the ones which the ASSU
Travel Service offers. We believe that Mayer's efforts may
have contributed, in part, to the CAB decision to keep the
charters.
Other than in this one case, however, the Council was
weak in supporting student interests. We saw little action by
the Council in disputes about parking, SWOPSI/SCIRE and
tenure. No Council member served as a spokesman on any of
these important issues.
We believe that at the very least, a Council should use its
connections with the Administration for the benefit of
students who feel strongly about an issue. We regret that this
Council did not take a more active role in mobilizing student
interest and protest.
We hope that the new Council will take a more active role
in speaking out on subjects of vital interest to students,
while continuing the precedent set by the outgoing Council
in implementing its proposals.
