A Query to Mr. Rosenzweig
DID THEY ALL MISINTERPRET
MOYNIHAN'S MEANING, TOO?
In advising "Benign Neglect", Moynihan suggested to President
Nixon that it would be "usetul" to start giving more attention to
minorities other than Blacks and to discourage public discussion ot
minority grievances. "Useful" to whom was the question? And for
what?
On March 6, 1970, The New York Times published a statement in
which the "Benign Neglect" memorandum was called "..a flagrant
and shameful political document." The signers said, among other
criticisms:
"To say that greater attention should be given to other ethnic groups
and less to Negroes is, incredibly, to miss the point of life in a
democratic society. We insist that equal attention be given to all of
them since they are all afflicted with the common problems of
poverty or discrimination, or both...We are equally certain that ef
forts to divide minority groups in this country will fail...The gains that
minority groups have made in this country were not won by benign
neglect, but by courageous and aggressive action. We pledge that our
efforts will continue ..."

representatives of the following organizations:
