# Emerson Brown Goes To Vanderbilt
## Prof Lambasts Tenure Pressure 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The growth of the so-called
"publish or perish" syndrome at
Stanford is placing undue pressure on
junior faculty members, according to
Asst. English Prof. Emerson Brown,
who says his disillusionment with the
situation is one reason he is leaving
Stanford to accept an appointment at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
Brown, who was about to be
considered for tenure when he
announced his departure from
Stanford, also claims that the
University seems to be firing too many
of its assistant professors.
"One of the things that attracted
me to Stanford when I came here six
years ago was its sensible policy of
hiring the best young people available
and keeping them rather than
routinely firing junior professors and
hiring star professors to fatten the
senior ranks," Brown said. "But now
Stanford is firing assistant professors
and hiring stars at the full professor
level."
According to Brown, the English
Department continually is able to hire
the most talented junior scholars but
usually cannot persuade full professors
from schools like Harvard and Yale to
come here.
Star System
"Stanford is moving in the
direction of the star system, but I
don't think it will be able to pull it
off," Brown commented. "Although
the University has been able to get
some leading scholars to come here, it
would probably be better in the long
run if the best junior scholars were

allowed to remain here."
Brown complained that the
pressure on assistant professors to
publish material in order to win tenure
has forced them to neglect
undergraduate instruction.
"Teaching will not be totally
neglected," Brown said. "Students
cannot be altogether neglected because
the University needs their bodies. But
the inevitable result of turning the
screws on tenure requirements is the
creation of more fear ar. ong the junior
faculty and isolating them from
undergraduates."
Brown noted that when he first
came to Stanford, he and several other
junior professors took the lead in
organizing the Medieval Studies
program. But Brown claimed that if
the University's current attitude
toward tenure had prevailed then, they
would not have had time to organize
the program because they would have
been too busy producing material for
publication.
Stifles Creativity
According to Brown, the
administration's current attitude
toward tenure is stifling such creativity
among the untenured faculty.
Brown contended that if Stanford
continues to pressure its junior faculty
members, attracting highly qualified
young people to the University will
become increasingly difficult.
Brown noted that Stanford's
English Department has long been able
to hire its first choice of junior
scholars. But he predicted that if the
University continually refuses to give
tenure to assistant professors, Stanford

will fail to attract its first choices.
Brown said he wasn't sure whether
or not he would have received tenure
if he had chosen to remain at
Stanford.
Uncertain Future
"But I didn't want to struggle
more," Brown said. "I had a strong
offer at Vanderbilt and an uncertain
future at Stanford."
Brown emphasized that fear of not
receiving tenure was not his only
reason for going to Vanderbilt.
He claimed that personal as well as
financial considerations also
influenced his decision to leave
Stanford.
According to Brown, faculty
salaries here are higher, but the cost of
living is 30 percent lower at
Vanderbilt.
Despite the many considerations
influencing his decision to leave
Stanford, Brown declared that "if all
this talk about tenure decisions and
budget cuts hadn't come out, I
probably wouldn't have been
interested in other offers."
