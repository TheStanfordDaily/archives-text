# Election Procedure Wasn't Irregular
## 
### 
As elections commissioner, I
have silently put up with the
inaccurate and one-sided reporting
of the Daily that has accompanied
this election, attributing it to lack
of time or experience on the part
of its staff.
However, when the Daily
Editorial Board is able to produce
an editorial that is misleading,
contains exaggerations, and, in
fact, plainly lies, I can no longer
remain silent.
The Daily said I did not
understand the Senior Class
Officer campaign spending limit. I
did, however, understand it to be
$200, which is what I told anyone
that asked (all slates were given a
copy of the relevant by-laws).
I challenge the Daily to give
reasons why this figure is
incorrect. The by-laws state that
Council of Presidents (COP)
candidates, as a ticket, may spend
$200. "All other candidates may
spend $50." I interpret this to

indicate that any candidates that
run as a ticket may total their
individual $50 to spend $200.
Next, the blatant lie, which
even contradicts the Daily's own
article: When a different possible
interpretation of the spending
limit was pointed out, contrary to
the Daily I did not declare a
four-slate run-off on "my own
initiative." As reported April 21,1
received approval from all the 13
senators I was able to contact
about the plan.
The reason the senate put all
six slates back on the ballot was
to be as fair as possible, not
because of ineptitude.
Unlike the Daily which
endorsed the wrong Band fee
assessment, I at least made the
effort to call the Band to ascertain
what I originally believed to be a
$2 request. Not having attended
the senate meeting when the $1
request was passed, I could not be
expected to know if they had

changed their request until I was
able to contact them.
When I investigated the letter
from the Band to the Daily
explaining theii need for the
assessment, Editor Kevin Smith
told me that he could not even
remember what amount was
requested in the letter. He must
have read it very carefully; it
specified no amount.
Concerning press in the
computer room — at no other
count since I have "reigned" has
the Daily tried to be present.
Now, all of a sudden, Smith
decided he wanted to see what
was going on. He was so worried
about covering the story that he
did not even bring paper or
notebook. There were already 15
people invited to the count who
had more reason than he to be
there. Due to space limitations, I
saw his presence as only adding to
the confusion.

Normal election policy for
the past three elections has not
included press at the count — nor
did it try to attend, as mentioned.
The only thing I find offensive is
the display of arrogance by Smith.
When asked about the
constitutional amendment, I
replied I believed it needed
two-thirds vote, but wanted to
verify that before stating it as
factual (something the Daily
might do better to try). My job is
not to ratify amendments, only
report their vote-tallies to the
ASSU Senate for their action.
I believe it is most unfortunate
that campus politics has
degenerated to the low level
displayed by the Daily. The
irresponsible reporting and abuse
of power exhibited by the Daily is
something all students should be
aware of, if they are not already.

ASSU elections commissioner.)
