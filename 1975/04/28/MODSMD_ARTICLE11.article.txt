Daily' Is Independent
Editor:
I'd like to provide what 1 hope
will be the final words on the
Daily fee assessment, since the
campaign is over and I have the
feeling there are more compelling
things for the paper to write
about than itself.
Nonetheless, I had to comment
on Tim Ferguson's April 24 Daily
column arguing that by receiving a
"mandatory" fee assessment (actually,
it is refundable), the
Daily will somehow be
surrendering its independence and
integrity.
The fact is that by seeking a
fee assessment the Daily's board
was not destroying the paper's
independence but trying to
preserve it. There is very little
doubt in the mind of anyone
connected with the board that
failure of the assessment would
have meant the end of
independence.
The paper would almost
certainly have had to revert to the
ASSU or the University, and Lord
knows what — if anything —
might have been done with it.
By passing the assessment with
nearly 60 percent of the vote,
students have demonstrated their
support for an independent Daily
while the paper's leadership tries
to cope with the financial
problems that are facing virtually
the entire newspaper industry.
For that support, the Daily owes
the student body a very large lebt
of gratitude.
In return, the Daily must strive
to put out the best possible
product. That means establishing
standards of quality — and saying
no to sub-par material whether it is
submitted by the University,
students or Daily staffers
themselves.
The Daily's fee assessment does
not damage the integrity of the
paper, any more than having no
assessment would guarantee its
integrity. The paper's integrity is
established by its leadership, and
what is clearly needed for the
paper's survival and success is
honest, able and mature
leadership with the knowledge to
produce a quality publication and
the guts to stand up for what's
right. It is a goal devoutly to be
wished.

Why Celebrate Tragedy?
Editor:
We object to the Alliance P'or
Radical Change's (ARC's) April 24
celebration of death and
destruction in Indochina.
Regardless of one's position on
U.S. policy in Vietnam and
Cambodia, it is unthinking and
callous to find the communist
victories in this costly and terrible
war a cause for celebration.
It is callous because of the
American and Vietnamese lives
lost and because the opportunity
for democratic government in
Southeast Asia is now gone. We
are disturbed that while refugees
pour into this country, American
students cheer their exile.
Those of us who demonstrated
for peace in Vietnam during the
1960s were aware of our
responsibility as Americans for
the war. We expressed our
opposition soberly, knowing that
the war's end would produce no
real victors, little left to salvage
and less to celebrate. The ARC
might better spend its time
contemplating the human costs of
its cheap rhetoric.
