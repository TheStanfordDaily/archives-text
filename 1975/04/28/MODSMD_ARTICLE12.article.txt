## JON KRA$S 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Jon Krass tells his stock market
class things that many brokers
won't even admit in private.
Face it, the successful E.F.
Hutton broker says candidly of
the business world, "its credois: if
you don't get caught, it's all right.
That's the 11th Commandment —
'Thou shall not get caught.' "
At a time when many
undergraduates fear their college
education is not preparing them
for a business world which may
not play by the rules they've
learned, Krass's pragmatic and
frank approach to the stock
market has become more
appealing.
Since 1969, when Krass began
teaching the undergraduate special
in the Deke House lounge,
enrollment has skyrocketed faster
than the value of a share of IBM.
Some 180 students have crowded
Jordan Hall each Thursday this
quarter.

"I figured it might do me good
to take something practical before
I graduate," says junior Ira Rubin,
a political science major summing
up a common sentiment.
Quick Decisions
Refusing to teach simply
through lectures and exams, Krass
forces his students to make quick
decisions just as if they were
haggling on the busy floor of the
New York Stock Exchange.
Each class member must
"purchase" up to $50,000 worth of
stock and then follow its progress
on the market. There's no fudging
— each transaction must be
reported to Krass no more than
one day after it is made.
A recent rising market meant
many successful student
stockholders last quarter. Some
earned $15,000. Everybody
learned.
Krass also demands that his
students make a commitment by
constantly prodding them to raise

their hands if they think a
statement is correct.
"Raise your hand if you'd buy
a stock that was going down," he
tells the class.
Or, "Raise your hand if you
think you're honest."
'Live To Work'
More philosophically, "Raise
your hand if you live to work"
(few students do) "or work to
live" (many hands go up).
"If young people will make
more of a commitment, right or
wrong, they'll learn by it," Krass
believes. "You can't say 'oh that's
what I would have said, oh that's
what I thought'" in the real
world.
Krass's own life is a case in
point. He thrives on not only the
commitment, but the gamble.
Had To Sell
"He enjoys living his life on the
edge of a precipice," says Angela
Mclntire, his trading assistant.
"He likes volatile situations in

which he purposely sticks out his
neck to see if he can take the risk
and come out winning."
When Krass was 23, he fled a
securities analyst job with a future
in New York City to live in
California, 3000 miles from any
familiar face or account. "My net
worth was 12 shares of AT&T,
which I had to sell to pay the
rent," he recalls.
But noting that he was "too
young, dumb and naive to be
scared at 23," Krass aggressively
began to pursue clients.
Hefty Chances
Now, at 36, he earns more tnan
all but 12 of 2350 E.F. Hutton
brokers, mostly in one of the
financial world's riskiest arenas —
the commodities market. He says
he's wiser, and the 200 pounds of
dried food he stores in the garage
of his Woodside home "in case the
supermarkets close" may indicate
that he has added a touch of
caution to his outlook.
Krass still craves playing the
investment game, though. He's
memorized its rules so completely
that only by taking the longshot
gamble can he still experience its
challenge.
Mclntire admits she's seen
Krass take some hefty chances
with his own money in the
commodities market. "They're so
ridiculous that you know he's just
doing it for the risk. He feels
exhilarated by taking them," she
says.
'The Next IBM'
Indeed, the only stock that
Krass owns other than E.F.
Hutton shares is that of a tiny
new company with potentially
earth-shaking inventions in drug
delivery systems that could
multiply the stock's value tenfold
— or fall through, bankrupt the
company and ruin the stock's
value. He calls the company, Palo
Alto's Alza Corporation, possibly
the next IBM.
"If there's a possibility of
reward, he'll take a risk,"
concludes Judy Briles, another
E.F. Hutton broker.
Krass can't satisfy his love of
risk within the confines of the
securities market. "He plays chess
and board games aggressively and
skis fast, hard and long," observes

Sam Gordon, a broker who grew
up with Krass in Scarsdale, a
wealthy suburb of New York
City.
Gamble
He's also a crafty if infrequent
gambler, sometimes winning
enough when he visits a casino to
pay for a few extra ski holidays.
And in the classroom, Krass
enjoys going out on a limb by
subjecting himself to a barrage of
questions from students perplexed
by the intricacies of stock market
regulations filled with loopholes.
No doubt about it, Krass is a
true performer. "He enjoys
showing he can answer most any
question, and he usually can,"
says Mclntire, who attended all of
Krass's lectures last quarter just
for the background the course
provides.
"Teaching brings out the ham
and ego in me," Krass admits of
the job for which he doesn't
receive pay.
'History Of Krass*?
He tears dollar bills in half to
demonstrate the effects of
inflation, and flips a one-ounce
solid gold coin while discussing
the value of gold.
And Krass loves to digress,
sometimes telling stories about
himself to the point where
students may wonder whether the
class is a "History of Jon Krass"
rather than a general survey of the
stock market.
He won't hesitate to let the
class in on his support for higher
taxes and a return of "strong
leaders like Churchill and
DeGaulle."
Qualified For Nothing
But Krass also teaches because
"I want the class to be an
experience I missed as an
undergraduate."
An economics major at Williams
College in Massachusetts, Krass
found himself "qualified for
absolutely nothing when I got out
of college."
He wants his students to
personally experience the stock
market. Thus, he invites each to
his office for a chance to see the
ultramodern electronic screen
flashing green neon stock symbols
and prices, and, of course, to
watch Jon Krass and his fellow

brokers in action.
Often Krass is on the phone
with a client when the student
arrives, so the visitor has time to
browse through disheveled piles of
colored cardboard and wooden
crates which look quite
out-of-place among the neatly
stacked account statements and
financial magazines in his office.
Such bric-a-brac is Krass's idea
of a collection of research papers.
He encourages any kind of
creation the student can dream up
as long as it relates to money or
the stock market.
Many of the projects exemplify
sheer ingenuity — original
thinking which Krass believes
students do not utilize enough in
college.
One student submitted an
entire front page, whacky feature
headlines and all, from a Wall
Street Journal of 1996. The
newspaper tells of cars running on
ethanol, of President McCloskey
seeking an increase in the tax on
marijuana "just for the hell of it,"

and of Sen. Bob Dylan (L-N.Y.)
lamenting the world economic
situation.
Women, Skiing, Money
Not surprisingly, there are
several tributes to Krass, including
a two-foot high drawing which
captures the confidence in Krass's
expression. Flip back the drawing,
and underneath you see a collage
of thoughts swirling in bachelor
Jon Krass's head — women, skiing
and money predominate.
Nevertheless, Krass says he
never wants to be a millionaire so
long as he can live like one and as
long as life presents him with
challenges such as teaching, skiing
and the stock market.
He's recently found a new
challenge, which he excitedly
relates to his class.
"Ever played baroque chess?"
he asks. "I'm completely boggled
by it. The pawns move like rooks
and other pieces move like
queens. I've dreamed about it
three nights now.
"Stay after class a few minutes
and I'll show you the rules."
