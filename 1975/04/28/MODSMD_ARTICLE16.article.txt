# Men, Women Netters Runners-Up At Ojai
## 
### RON BECK 
For the second weekend in a
row, UCLA's men's tennis team
has stung Stanford. The Bruins
absolutely dominated the Ojai
tournament, and broke Stanford's
three-year tourney win streak in
the process.
The Bruins were in such
command of the tournament that
the Cardinals were shut out of
both the singles and the doubles
finals.
Both Jim Delaney and John
Whitlinger lost to the eventual
winner, Billy Martin, but neither
player did poorly. In the
quarter-finals, Delaney took
Martin to three-sets, with a 5-4
tiebreaker in the first-set going to
Martin.
The following day in the
semifinals, Whitlinger was serving
for the match in the second set
(6-4, 5-3), but was broken. Whit
lost 10 of the next 11 games for
the three-set loss.
The real surprise of the
tourney for the Cards was the
semifinals loss of Whitlinger-Del
aney to UCLA's second doubles
team of Taygan and Kreiss. After
last weekend's outstanding
performances, Whitlinger and
Delaney were favored to win the
tourney.
Other notable performances
were turned in by Bill Maze and
Craig Johnson. Maze and Johnson
extended Martin and Brian
Teacher to three sets in the
double quarterfinals.
But even had Stanford taken

the doubles with any of its
entries, UCLA would still have
been the victors due to the
number of points it received in
singles play. UCLA had secured
the win even before the finals
were played, mathematically
eliminating all contenders after
the semis.
The women's team came
within a point of winning its part
of the tournament, but Arizona
State, the defending national
champions, edged the Cards with
a win in the doubles finals for the
deciding one-point margin.
Marcy O'Keefe made it to the
singles finals before losing to
Utah's Jane Stratton, and Liza
Pande and Whitney Grant
advanced to the doubles finals
before succumbing to ASU's
Shomoyers sisters in a close 6-2,
3-6, 6-3 match.
Stanford's eight points were
worth second-place behind ASU,
which had nine.

For the second weekend in a
row, UCLA's men's tennis team
has stung Stanford. The Bruins
absolutely dominated the Ojai
tournament, and broke Stanford's
three-year tourney win streak in
the process.
The Bruins were in such
command of the tournament that
the Cardinals were shut out of
both the singles and the doubles
finals.
Both Jim Delaney and John
Whitlinger lost to the eventual
winner, Billy Martin, but neither
player did poorly. In the
quarter-finals, Delaney took
Martin to three-sets, with a 5-4
tiebreaker in the first-set going to
Martin.
The following day in the
semifinals, Whitlinger was serving
for the match in the second set
(6-4, 5-3), but was broken. Whit
lost 10 of the next 11 games for
the three-set loss.
The real surprise of the
tourney for the Cards was the
semifinals loss of Whitlinger-Del
aney to UCLA's second doubles
team of Taygan and Kreiss. After
last weekend's outstanding
performances, Whitlinger and
Delaney were favored to win the
tourney.
Other notable performances
were turned in by Bill Maze and
Craig Johnson. Maze and Johnson
extended Martin and Brian
Teacher to three sets in the
double quarterfinals.
But even had Stanford taken

the doubles with any of its
entries, UCLA would still have
been the victors due to the
number of points it received in
singles play. UCLA had secured
the win even before the finals
were played, mathematically
eliminating all contenders after
the semis.
The women's team came
within a point of winning its part
of the tournament, but Arizona
State, the defending national
champions, edged the Cards with
a win in the doubles finals for the
deciding one-point margin.
Marcy O'Keefe made it to the
singles finals before losing to
Utah's Jane Stratton, and Liza
Pande and Whitney Grant
advanced to the doubles finals
before succumbing to ASU's
Shomoyers sisters in a close 6-2,
3-6, 6-3 match.
Stanford's eight points were
worth second-place behind ASU,
which had nine.
