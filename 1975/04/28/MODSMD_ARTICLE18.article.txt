# Card Batters Drop Two; USC Opens Pac-8 Lead
## 
### DAN PYNE 
"Some days are born ugly. From the very first
light they are no damn good whatever the weather,
and everybody knows it. No one knows what
causes this, but on such a day people resist getting
out of bed and set their heels against the day. When
they are finally forced out by hunger or job they
find that the day is just as lousy as they knew it
would be." — John Steinbeck
Yesterday was sunny and warm — one of the
finest displays of spring weather experienced all
quarter. It was one of those days you feel like
venturing out with a tube of suntan oil, watching a
baseball game and searching for the perfect tan.
But for the Cardinal baseball team all hell broke
loose. Stanford dropped an 18-9 decision to USC
and fell further behind in the race for the Pacific
Eight Southern Division crown.
The facts are sufficiently eloquent.
USC batters knocked out four Cardinal pitchers
in five innings. The Trojans scored all 18 runs in
those innings, but only two were earned. USC had
one extra-base hit.
Sophomore Bruce Davis started, and pitched
two-thirds of the first inning, walking three and
allowing four runs on one hit and two errors. With
the bases loaded and one out designated hitter
Bruce Tonascia bounced a ball back at the mound.
Davis fielded it, and threw the ball over Stanford
catcher Bruce Robinson's head.
Kent Caldwell followed, ending the first and
pitching the entire second with but one run
allowed Caldwell went out with bases loaded in the
third, and no one out. The score was 8-1.
Jim Scharffenberger dropped the USC battery in
order to end the third, but was blown out in the
fourth on four hits and one error that scored five
runs.
Ed Matta ended the fourth with a strikeout, and
started the fifth the same way. He walked in two
runs with two outs and pitching coach Tom
Dunton made another trip to the diamond.
Cardinal pitchers faced 43 Trojans in the first
five innings. The Stanford infield (including the
pitchers and catcher) committed 10 errors.
Offensively, the Cardinals were not quiet. Center

fielder Bob Hampton contributed the first three
runs with a towering home run, his eighth of the
season, to lead off the second and a two-RBI single
in the third.
Dave Baker, who saw action both in left field
and behind the plate, batted in four of the final six
runs.
Righthander A 1 Arthur started the opener of the
doubleheader and pitched the complete seven
innings allowing but four hits. Unfortunately three
of ti em were homers — two by right fielder Steve
Kemp in successive innings — and the Trojans
picked up a 4-0 decision.
Trojan ace Pete Redfearn, scattering five hits in
shutting out the Card batters, faced but 15 Cards in
the first five innings.
Stanford played solid baseball in the nightcap,
and thumped the Trojans 7-2.
Lefty John Yandle pitched eight and two-thirds
innings of one-hit baseball and picked up the win.
Reliever Ed Matta allowed USC's only other hit, a
check-swing single, in the ninth.
Saturday was a toss-up. Sunday
was ... we 11....
In the fifth inning Tonascia lashed a Johnson
fastball high and foul, toward the right field
bullpens. Rick Doharty was sitting on the green
fence watching the game. The ball came at him —
about 340 feet in the air — and Doharty caught it
calmly, Willie Mays style, without moving.
The fans, with Stanford losing 18-3, went wild
with applause.
It was one of those days.

USC batters knocked out four Cardinal pitchers
in five innings. The Trojans scored all 18 runs in
those innings, but only two were earned. USC had
one extra-base hit.
Sophomore Bruce Davis started, and pitched
two-thirds of the first inning, walking three and
allowing four runs on one hit and two errors. With
the bases loaded and one out designated hitter
Bruce Tonascia bounced a ball back at the mound.
Davis fielded it, and threw the ball over Stanford
catcher Bruce Robinson's head.
Kent Caldwell followed, ending the first and
pitching the entire second with but one run
allowed Caldwell went out with bases loaded in the
third, and no one out. The score was 8-1.
Jim Scharffenberger dropped the USC battery in
order to end the third, but was blown out in the
fourth on four hits and one error that scored five
runs.
Ed Matta ended the fourth with a strikeout, and
started the fifth the same way. He walked in two
runs with two outs and pitching coach Tom
Dunton made another trip to the diamond.
Cardinal pitchers faced 43 Trojans in the first
five innings. The Stanford infield (including the
pitchers and catcher) committed 10 errors.
Offensively, the Cardinals were not quiet. Center

fielder Bob Hampton contributed the first three
runs with a towering home run, his eighth of the
season, to lead off the second and a two-RBI single
in the third.
Dave Baker, who saw action both in left field
and behind the plate, batted in four of the final six
runs.
Righthander A 1 Arthur started the opener of the
doubleheader and pitched the complete seven
innings allowing but four hits. Unfortunately three
of ti em were homers — two by right fielder Steve
Kemp in successive innings — and the Trojans
picked up a 4-0 decision.
Trojan ace Pete Redfearn, scattering five hits in
shutting out the Card batters, faced but 15 Cards in
the first five innings.
Stanford played solid baseball in the nightcap,
and thumped the Trojans 7-2.
Lefty John Yandle pitched eight and two-thirds
innings of one-hit baseball and picked up the win.
Reliever Ed Matta allowed USC's only other hit, a
check-swing single, in the ninth.
Saturday was a toss-up. Sunday
was ... we 11....
In the fifth inning Tonascia lashed a Johnson
fastball high and foul, toward the right field
bullpens. Rick Doharty was sitting on the green
fence watching the game. The ball came at him —
about 340 feet in the air — and Doharty caught it
calmly, Willie Mays style, without moving.
The fans, with Stanford losing 18-3, went wild
with applause.
It was one of those days.

"Some days are born ugly. From the very first
light they are no damn good whatever the weather,
and everybody knows it. No one knows what
causes this, but on such a day people resist getting
out of bed and set their heels against the day. When
they are finally forced out by hunger or job they
find that the day is just as lousy as they knew it
would be." — John Steinbeck
Yesterday was sunny and warm — one of the
finest displays of spring weather experienced all
quarter. It was one of those days you feel like
venturing out with a tube of suntan oil, watching a
baseball game and searching for the perfect tan.
But for the Cardinal baseball team all hell broke
loose. Stanford dropped an 18-9 decision to USC
and fell further behind in the race for the Pacific
Eight Southern Division crown.
