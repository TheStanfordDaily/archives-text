# Spikers Do Well In Relays
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
For the first time in what
seems like an eternity, the
Stanford track team wasn't
shellshocked by a Pacific-Eight
dual meet power this weekend.
But the Cards didn't compete in a
dual meet. A contingent of 15
Cards journeyed to the Mt. San
Antonio Relays in Walnut, and
they did okay for themselves.
On a rare smogless day, Pay ton
Jordan's crew took three bronze
medals and qualified one spiker
for the NCAA Championship
meet. But more importantly, the
lull from dual meet competition
gave Jordan an opportunity to
rest some of his injured Cards for
next Saturday's 79th "Big" Meet.
"After all the schellackings
we've had the past couple of
weeks, the meet gave us a chance
to get some individual honors,"
said Asst. Coach Marshall Clark.

Hurdler John Foster was one
Card who came away with honors.
Competing against a star-studded
invitational 120 high hurdle field,
the junior-college transfer clocked
a 14.1 for third place behind
USC's Fred Shaw.
The distancemen, Stanford's
most consistent group this year,
ran into some tough competition
but came away with a couple of
medals. Miler Steve Crowley
clocked a 4:13.0 for third place in
the invitational mile. And Tony
Sandoval finally got untracked.
The junior lung-buster placed fifth
in the 10,000 meter run with a
29:57.6 and met the NCAA
qualifying standard for the
six-mile run in the process. Jack
Bellah ran his first steeplechase in
nearly a month and it showed.
Bellah ran a 9:23.0 which was
only good enough for fifth place.
While his spikers were running

against the West Coast's premier
track talent, Jordan was
competing against some of the
best in the over 50 age bracket.
Jordan won the senior century
with a 10.9 and then came back
to run a 48.0 leg for the senior
mile relay team.
