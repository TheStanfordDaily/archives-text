# Settlement Reached At Brown University
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
A coalition of minority students
ended its occupation of the Brown
University administration building
Friday evening after reaching a
negotiated settlement with University
officials.
The Third World Coalition, a group
consisting of black, Latin-American
and Asian-American students, had
occupied University Hall early
Thursday and presented the
administration with a list of 21
demands concerning minority
recruiting and enrollment, faculty
composition and student services.
In a statement issued jointly by
University and Third World Coalition
negotiators Friday, Brown agreed to
make concessions in the areas of
minority recruitment and faculty
affirmative action. Brown Daily Herald
Senior Editor Matthew Wald told the
Daily last night.
Minority Increase
The University agreed to increase
the proportion of minority students
among undergraduates by 25 percent
over the next three years. Black
students represent nine percent of the
student body at present. The
undergraduate population of 5118 also
includes 30 Latin Americans, the other
affected minority, Wald said.
Brown will also appoint a minority
admissions officer, responsible for
reviewing applications from minority
students, and will allow a black
graduating senior to evaluate
applications from black students. Wald

explained that University policy had
previously been to deny any student
the right to read application folders.
The University also committed
itself to the goal of increasing the
proportion of minorities and women
on the faculty over the next few years.
This comes at a time when the
administration has already announced
a 16.5 percent faculty cut, to come
mostly from untenured faculty. Most
black and women faculty members are
currently untenured, Wald noted,
pointing out that only four of the
roughly 300 tenured professors are
black.
The approximately 40 protesters
were also granted full "academic and
legal amnesty."
'Never Again'
At a press conference yesterday,
Brown University President Donald
Hornig vigorously defended the
agreement. "We did not negotiate
under a gun," he asserted. "We did not
agree to anything which would not
have been considered right and proper
in the absence of a building
occupation."
However, he stated, "I will never do
business again as we did this last
week." He explained that he meant
negotiating in "a crisis situation" with
people occupying buildings.
Brown did not meet all the
demonstrators' requests. It refused to
guarantee continuation of the current
levels of financial aid, but agreed to
meet demonstrated need of minority
students. The University also rejected
the demand that the instructional
faculty remain the same size.
Noel Rubinton, a Herald reporter
who remained inside the
administration building throughout
the occupation, said the people inside
remained calm for the entire two days.
"The most impressive thing was how
well organized they [the
demonstrators 1 were," he added.
Rubinton said the people inside
never expected to be evicted, and
remained jubilant throughout the
weekend, reading and watching
television.
Rubinton and Wald both
emphasized that the demonstrators
apparently had "a lot of outside
support."

business again as we did this last
week." He explained that he meant
negotiating in "a crisis situation" with
people occupying buildings.
Brown did not meet all the
demonstrators' requests. It refused to
guarantee continuation of the current
levels of financial aid, but agreed to
meet demonstrated need of minority
students. The University also rejected
the demand that the instructional
faculty remain the same size.
Noel Rubinton, a Herald reporter
who remained inside the
administration building throughout
the occupation, said the people inside
remained calm for the entire two days.
"The most impressive thing was how
well organized they [the
demonstrators 1 were," he added.
Rubinton said the people inside
never expected to be evicted, and
remained jubilant throughout the
weekend, reading and watching
television.
Rubinton and Wald both
emphasized that the demonstrators
apparently had "a lot of outside
support."
A coalition of minority students
ended its occupation of the Brown
University administration building
Friday evening after reaching a
negotiated settlement with University
officials.
The Third World Coalition, a group
consisting of black, Latin-American
and Asian-American students, had
occupied University Hall early
Thursday and presented the
administration with a list of 21
demands concerning minority
recruiting and enrollment, faculty
composition and student services.
In a statement issued jointly by
University and Third World Coalition
negotiators Friday, Brown agreed to
make concessions in the areas of
minority recruitment and faculty
affirmative action. Brown Daily Herald
Senior Editor Matthew Wald told the
Daily last night.
Minority Increase
The University agreed to increase
the proportion of minority students
among undergraduates by 25 percent
over the next three years. Black
students represent nine percent of the
student body at present. The
undergraduate population of 5118 also
includes 30 Latin Americans, the other
affected minority, Wald said.
Brown will also appoint a minority
admissions officer, responsible for
reviewing applications from minority
students, and will allow a black
graduating senior to evaluate
applications from black students. Wald

explained that University policy had
previously been to deny any student
the right to read application folders.
The University also committed
itself to the goal of increasing the
proportion of minorities and women
on the faculty over the next few years.
This comes at a time when the
administration has already announced
a 16.5 percent faculty cut, to come
mostly from untenured faculty. Most
black and women faculty members are
currently untenured, Wald noted,
pointing out that only four of the
roughly 300 tenured professors are
black.
The approximately 40 protesters
were also granted full "academic and
legal amnesty."
'Never Again'
At a press conference yesterday,
Brown University President Donald
Hornig vigorously defended the
agreement. "We did not negotiate
under a gun," he asserted. "We did not
agree to anything which would not
have been considered right and proper
in the absence of a building
occupation."
However, he stated, "I will never do
business again as we did this last
week." He explained that he meant
negotiating in "a crisis situation" with
people occupying buildings.
