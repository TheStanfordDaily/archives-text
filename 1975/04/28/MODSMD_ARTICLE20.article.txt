# Spartans Trip Golfers
## 
### 
After overwhelming their
opposition in last week's U.S.
Collegiate Invitational, you
would expect Stanford's
golfers to cool off a little.
But Friday afternoon on the
windswept Stanford course,
the Cards cooled off a lot.
San Jose State rolled to an
easy 17V6-7V4 victory as only
three Stanford players —
Conrad Nilmeier, Dave Baskins
and George Pettinger —
managed to break 80.
