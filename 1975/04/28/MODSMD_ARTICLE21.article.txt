# Parking recommendations from Committee on Land and Building Development
## 
### 
following is the text of a letter from Prof. Charles J.
Meyers, law, chairman of the University Committee on Land
and Building Development, to President Richard W. Lyman
April 23, transmitting the committee's recommendations
concerning parking and transportation poiicy.
By letter of March 25, 1975, Acting President William
Miller referred the Carpenter Study entitled "Recommended
Parking and Transportation Policies for Stanford University"
to the University Committee on Land and Building Develop
ment for review and advice. He requested that the Committee
have its report ready by April 25, in order that other ele
ments of the University could act with dispatch if changes in
parking and transportation policy were deemed advisable.
Despite the limited time available to the Committee (clas
ses did not resume until March 31), the Subcommittee on
Parking and Transportation, chaired by Prof. Scott Pearson,
met three times to consider the Carpenter Study, on April 4,
9, ?..;C' for a total of nine meeting hours, the first of
which was spent with Mr. Carpenter going over the Study.
(Before the Study appeared, the Subcommittee spent a great
deal of time consulting with Mr. Carpenter on the prepara
tion of the Study.)
As Chairman of the Committee on Land and Building
Development, I conducted a public hearing on the Study on
April 7 from 8 p.m. to 10:45 p.m. at which about 60 persons
attended, of whom all who wished to speak were heard. I also
read and summarized for the Committee all written commu
nications which had been received before the April 17 meet
ing.
On April 17, the Committee met to consider the Study,
devoting seven hours to it from 3 p.m. until 11 30 p.m. with
time out for supper. All members of the Committee had read
the Carpenter Study and also had read a thoughtful and
unanimous Subcommittee Report analyzing the Study and
making recommendations on parking and transportation pol
icy in the light of both the Study and the public comments
on it. The parent committee was also fully aware of and
sensitive to public comment on the Study in its deliberations.
I transmit herewith the Minutes of the meeting of April
17, in which some 29 recommendations were acted upon. In

only two instances out of 29 was the Committee closely
divided; in the other instances, the votes were either unani
mous or with one or two dissents, and the dissenting votes
were cast by different members on the several issues. In other
words, there were no Committee members who consistently
voted in the minority.
I believe, therefore, that the Committee's recommenda
tions come to you with very strong backing, after careful
thought and due deference to community opinion.
The Committee believes that it is time for a change in
parking and transportation policy, that the Carpenter Study
was a necessary and valuable first step in considering desir
able changes, that gradual changes are to be preferred to
abrupt ones, and that the recommendations we are forward
ing to you are moderate without being inconsequential.
SUMMARY OF UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE OIM
LAND AND BUILDING DEVELOPMENT
COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS
ON PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION
(prepared by Professor Meyers)
The University Committee on Land and Building Develop
ment, at its meeting on April 17, considered parking and
transportation policy, using in its deliberations the Carpenter
Study, the oral and written comments submitted in the
public hearing on April 7, the report of its Subcommittee on
Parking and Transportation dated April 15, and additional
expressions of Stanford community opinion communicated
both formally and informally to Committee members.
The Committee recommends to the President that moder
ate charges be established for parking in certain designated,
close-in areas of the campus, to be collected from faculty,
staff, and students. The revenues thus collected should go
into a special fund. The goal of expenditures from the special
fund should be to reduce private motor car traffic in the
central part of the campus, including the Medical School.
The Committee recommends that the new policies be
implemented at the beginning of the 1975-76 academic year.
A new University committee would be established to oversee
the operation of the new policies and to recommend changes
as experience may dictate.

In addition, the new committee would establish priorities
for expenditures from the special fund and would make
recommendations on such expenditures. The committee
would be composed of three faculty members, three staff
members, and three student members, with one person from
off campus and another from on campus in each category of
membership.
In addition, there would be three ex-officio memberi
representative of the Director of Public Safety, of the Facili
ties Planning Office, and of the Provost's Office. The Vice
president for Business and Finance would be the University's
officer in charge of administering the policies.
Under the new plan, all motor vehicles regularly used on
campus would be registered, without charge. There would be
no parking regulations in the faculty-staff residence area, and
student residence parking would continue to be assigned
under the rules presently in force. Thus, Escondido Village
wou'd retain its system of one-parking-space-per-dwelling
unit, and other student residences would continue with the
present system of assigned lots. There would be no sale of
more permits than there are spaces in these residence areas.
In the Academic Zone, parking would continue to be
assigned on the basis of reserved areas for faculty, staff, and
off-campus students. On-campus students would not be per
mitted to park in the Academic Zone.
Free parking lots would be established for those choosing
to walk a little further to their campus destinations. In
addition, to provide for visitor parking and other short-term
parking and to help with the problem of parking on rainy
days, the Committee recommends that parking meters be
installed, and gate-actuated, pay lots be established. Two
unmanned information booths at main entrances to the cam
pus should be established for visitors.
The Committee recommends that parking fees in the
Academic Zone, on an annual basis, be $48 for faculty, $40
for staff, and $32 for off-campus students. The parking fee in
the Residence Zone would be $5 per quarter, but parking
charges currently assessed in student residential rental fees
would be eliminated.
