Viet Leader To Ask For Cease Fire
SAIGON — Neutralist leader Duong Van "Big" Minh,
unanimously named to the presidency by the National
Assembly, is expected to appeal today for an immediate
cease-fire and the opening of political talks with the Viet
Cong.
Over the past six days, as political and diplomatic
pressure built up against President Tran Van Huong to step
aside in favor of the 59-year-old retired general, Minh's
associates have said such an appeal would be the first
priority of his "government of negotiation."
Although the Viet Cong have declined comment on
Minh's acceptability as a representative of the Saigon
government for peace negotiations, Minh and his associates
are confident the communist side will agree to deal with
him. The Viet Cong refused to deal with Huong.
In recent days, as communist-led forces around the
South Vietnamese capital have kept an ominous silence, a
sense of urgency has marked political negotiations over
Huong's ouster. This peaked yesterday following an early
morning rocket attack on Saigon — the first since the 1973
cease-fire — and heavy fighting east of the capital which
many opposition politicians interpreted as a "warning"
from the Viet Cong.
Military sources said Ba Ria, the capital of Phuoc Tuy
Province 30 miles southeast of Saigon, and the district
capital of Long Thanh, 20 miles to the east, had fallen to
communist-led troops.
Bien Hoa, the big military complex 15 miles northeast of
Saigon that houses a corps headquarters and a
fighter-bomber base, was reported under heavy artillery
attack. Military sources said hundreds of shells had hit the
Bien Hoa area and its defenders were bracing for a ground
attack.
Khmer Rouge Enter Thailand
BANGKOK, Thailand — Heavily armed troops of the
communist-led Khmer Rouge made a brief and peaceful
incursion into Thailand yesterday morning as the new
Cambodian regime in Phnom Penh trumpeted its victory
with music and propaganda statements, but little news.
The Khmer Rouge troops talked to a Thai provincial
governor and Red Cross officials before returning to their
side of the border on the Gulf of Siam. One of the Khmer
Rouge soldiers said they had come in peace.
Puthipong Chaiyasothi, the governor of Thailand's Trat
province, where many Cambodians sought refuge after
Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge, talked with the
rebels. Afterward, he told newsmen the refugees had come
to Thailand because they were frightened but that they
were returning after seeing that there was peace between
the Khmer Rouge and the Thai border guards. Eleven of
nearly 2000 Cambodian refugees living near the beach
border returned home yesterday.
Earlier reports from refugees crossing the border farther
north had told of executions and of the Khmer Rouge
forcing villagers to evacuate towns in Northwest Cambodia.
Congress To Debate Budget
WASHINGTON — Congress will debate the federal
budget as a whole this week for the first time, considering
spending and deficit estimates generally larger than
proposed by President Ford.
The House will also consider legislation giving Ford
limited authority to use troops in South Vietnam if needed
for evacuation. The bill provides $327 million in
humanitarian aid.
Each house will have before it a sort of budget outline in
the form of a resolution approved by its budget committee
and intended to serve as a guideline for the specific
appropriations to come.
The House version estimates outlays of $368.2 billion
against revenues of $295 billion, leaving a deficit of $73.2
billion.
The Senate resolution calls for a $365 billion spending
level with a $67.2 billion deficit.
Ford's original budget estimated outlays of $349.4

billion with a deficit of $51.9 billion, but it has been
revised subsequently. The administration is insisting that
the deficit be held to $60 billion in any case.
While Republicans and fiscally conservative Democrats
will be trying to get the proposed spending closer to
Ford-recommended levels, one group of senators already
has called for inclusion of an additional $9 billion for
recession-fighting programs and similar efforts are expected
in the House.
The fiscal debates will dominate congressional action
during the week, but the House still has to act on the
compromise legislation giving Ford limited authority to
send troops into South Vietnam if they are needed to guard
the evacuation. The Senate approved the measure Friday.
The House probably will act tomorrow.
Reagan, Clifford Criticize Kissinger
NEWARK, N.J. — Former California Gov. Ronald
Reagan said at a Republican party fundraiser in West
Orange, N.J.,yesterday that the collapse of South Vietnam
represents a defeat for America in that "it is the first time
this country has ever been in the position of violating an
agreement."
"I think that's what brought Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger home from the Middle East," Reagan said. "He
knows the Arabs can't be sure Congress will back up what
he says."
Further criticism of Kissinger came from former Defense
Secretary Clark Clifford who said in Washington yesterday
that the imminent fall of Saigon to communist control
signals the failure of Henry Kissinger's policies in Indochint.
and around the world.
He called on President Ford to replace Kissinger as
secretary of state and senior White House foreign policy
adviser.
U.S. Prepares For Viet Refugees
WASHINGTON — Robert McCloskey, assistant secretary
of state for congressional relations, said yesterday that
about 130,000 Vietnamese refugees will be brought to the
United States.
McCloskey said on the NBC interview program Meet The
Press. "Up until yesterday [Saturday] something around
30,000 have been taken out of Vietnam. Some of them
have reached the United States; most of them are at Guam,
Wake Island and a base in the Philippines."
If the United States evacuated all the Vietnamese who
were in some way associated with the United States during
the past 15 years, the number "would run up to a million,"
McCloskey said.
Washington Job Rally Draws 45,000
WASHINGTON"I —"I think they got their message
across," commented a union spokesman following a
weekend "Jobs Now" rally that had to be halted when the
crowd spilled onto the field and drowned out the speakers
they were to hear.
The rally, organized by the Industrial Union Department
of the AFL-CIO, drew more than 45,000 union members
here Saturday — the largest such turnout since the Great
Depression.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey (D-Minn.) and Rep. Barbara
Jordan (D-Tex.) were drowned out then they tried to
speak. Sen. Richard Schweiker, (R-Pa.) left without
addressing the crowd.
"They don't want words. What they want is action,"
said Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.).
Union leaders said government economic policy should
include commitment to a national full employment policy,
public works programs, reduction of interest rates and
credit allocations, tax reform and mass transit programs.
