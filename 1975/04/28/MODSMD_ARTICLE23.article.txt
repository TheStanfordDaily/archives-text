ASSU Senate
The ASSU Senate will meet tonight
at 7:30 in Room 75 of the Graduate
School of Business.
CORRECTION
The Daily editorial Friday
incorrectly stated that the Council of
Presidents failed to institute a weekly
bulletin. The Bulletin was published
fall and winter quarters but was
replaced by a calendar in the Chaparral
this quarter because of publishing
costs.
