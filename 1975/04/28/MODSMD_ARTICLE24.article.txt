# Task forces to study Administration, student services, calendar... ...faculty development, economic trends, professional schools, too
## 
### 
Following arc excerpts from charges to five task forces of
the University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission which
the Senate Committee to Consider Problems of Higher Edu
cation deems particularly pertinent to its report.
TASK FORCE I
The Size and Function oj the University Administration and
Other Support Services
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
The range of functions included in /the terms "University
Administration and other support services"/ -which might be
looked upon as any activity not involving the faculty in
direct teaching and research-is very wide, embracing such
disparate employees as librarians and firemen, departmental
secretaries and payroll clerks, deans and plumbers, the Presi
dent's staff and a professor 's lab technician. Precision in
defining the various functions, and care in analyzing cost and
benefits, are essential to a considered judgment of priorities.
The present University financial situation makes necessary
a thorough review and evaluation of the nature, size, scope,
and quality of the activities called "administrative and other
support services." This task force is asked to conduct that
review and evaluation, dividing its work into two parts:
1. A description of the area of concern. The task force
should begin its work by describing the totality of adminis
trative and other support services in categories or classifica
tions that will facilitate effective further communication and
review. A report by the task force at the earliest opportunity
within a few weeks of its formation will be helpful to all with
whom the evaluative aspects of this charge will be discussed.
2. An evaluation of the purpose and structure of the
subject services. Early in the autumn 1974 review of budget
alternatives, these criteria for evaluating support services were
suggested:
Necessity: Is the service necessary at all? If it is, what is its
minimum necessary size? (On what grounds is it necessary?
What function does it perform? For whom? What would be
the consequences of its reduction or elimination?)
Economy and effectiveness: is the function structured in
the most economical way to meet its minimum essential
responsibilities? (Has its structure been recently reviewed
from this point of view? Can it be repatterned or reduced to
be effective at less cost? What are the likely consequences of
a less costly structuring?)
Quality of staffing and direction: Is the service well mana
ged?
The task force is requested to concentrate its efforts on
the first two criteria. Clarity, insight, and informed discus
sions on these will help responsible officers make judgments
about the third. This task force should coordinate its work
with the Task Force on Student Services and Activities.
OtheT University committees may also be able to offer useful
advice and insight.

TASK FORCE II
Student Support Services and Activities
In recommeiiding the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
This topic, covering as it does housing as well as psycho
logical counseling, intramural sports as well as career place
ment, and medical care as well as the ASSU, has some of the
aspects of the first in that it includes a wide range o)
activities that from different perspectives are seen on a spec
trum ranging from integral to the academic process, through
materially supportive of it, to tangential if not irrelevant to
it. We need some help with both fact and rationale. . .preci
sion in analysis is important.
The overall job of this task force is to study student
support services and activities in order to evaluate which ones
should, because of their integral relationship, to University
purposes and process, be continued and which, because of a
less integral relationship, should be attenuated oi eliminated.
In examining student services and activities, the task force
should be alert to ways in which budgets might be reduced
through restructuring or reordering priorities. Attention to
concerns of the following kinds might, for example, produce
modifications which would still achieve essential goals but at
lower costs:
Scope and depth. Are there areas where the essential
purpose of an activity can be preserved even though its
extent is diminished? Are there areas where the range of
services should be preserved but the degree of assistance
offered reduced, leaving to individuals to pursue matters in
greater depth?
Alternatively structured services. Some offices themselves
provide the service with which they are associated; others
merely facilitate that service or activity. Can more nonaca
demic student functions be performed on the latter bases,
with the University's formal role being to help organizfe and
monitor rather than run such functions?
Payment by users. Are there student services and activities
which might properly be paid for by those who use them
rather than be covered within the tuition charge?
Duplication and consolidation. Are there services wfiich
are essentially similar but which are offered at department,
school, and University levels? If so, is such duplication essen
tial? Are there services which are now distributed which
could be effective and more economical if consobdated?
TASK FORCE 111
Academic Calendar and Utilization of the Academic Plant
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Commission wrote:
This topic includes inquiring into such questions as the
economic educational impact of a full-four-quarter calendar:

the possibilities of a semester system, including the corollary
effect of a necessary reexamination of every course offering
in the University; the feasibility and wisdom of tuition differ
entials; the impact of any calendar change on the size of the
student body, the resulting restrictions on faculty research
options; the possibilities of part-time student status; and like
matters. The variety and complexity of the relevant factors
are great, and any change having significant financial impact
would take careful planning and much time to implement.
This task force is asked to examine the range of relevant
issues and alternatives (Of which examples arc given above)
and determine those where change would be likely to pro
duce a significant and positive economic impact not only
without harm to the academic program but perhaps en
hancing it as well.
The task is one of proposing and examining alternatives'
which generate cost savings or income increases and then
judging their feasibility. Definitive studies are not expected,
although the commission will welcome work that goes be
yond the feasibility stage.
TASK FORCE IV
Professorial Rank and Faculty Development
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
The long-term thrust of the University depends on a
process of constant faculty renewal, an aspect of academic
development that even in normal times responds to the
competing tensions inherent in the tenure system.
When money is tight, the system comes under severe
strain. The necessity for a continuous infusion of voung
strength in a distinguished faculty is unquestioned.
In times of crisis there are factors at work in the budget
ary process that pull in opposite directions: on the one hand
junior faculty billets are decreased by their vulnerability to
elimination; on the other they are increased by the attraction
of replacing a retiring senior professor with a less costly
junior one. Both forces are at work. In particular situations
-either one nor the other is necessarily wrong.
What is required by the commission now is a precise
analysis of fact and rationale, by department and school, that
will make clear not only the relationship between the oppor
tunities for junior faculty and the effect of />articular depart
mental recommendations, but also the shape of long-term
University initiative.
The matter of faculty renewal is many sided. It includes
but is not limited to these aspects:
maintaining opportunities to appoint new assistant profes
sors;
maintaining opportunities to achieve tenure through pro
motion;
maintaining opportunities to appoint new tenured faculty
maintaining faculty affirmative action;
facilitating individual shifts of intellectual field:
providing opportunities for early retirement;

Space paid for by News and Publication Services

providing opportunities for part time service;
examining tenure ratios and age distributions.
This task force is asked to examine the age and .rank
distribution of the present faculty, assess the effects of the
1975-76 Operating Budget recommendations on those fac
tors, study by area the likely consequences of possible alter
native plans for selective increases and decreases in the num
bers of faculty positions over the coming two to four years,
and develop concepts and criteria to be applied in the review
of budget recommendations for 1976-77 and 1977-78 as they
affect faculty renewal.
TASK FORCE VI
Professional Schools and the Operating Budget
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
Special circumstances having to do partly with school
restricted endowment strength and partly with necessary
autonomy in academic programming make for varying de
grees of independence of the professional schools.
With respect to University budget matters, this necessary
semi-autonomy expresses itself differently for cach school,
not only because of intrinsic differences among them but also
because changing fiscal and operational circumstances require
periodic adjustments of the basic relationships between
school budgets and general University unrestricted funds.
We think it appropriate that the commission examine
these relationships and their impact on the Operating Budget,
and in particular to ask if the allocation-by-formula [to the
School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Business/ is
equitable and whether other schools should be put on the
same basis.
In undertaking this review, the task force will perforce
examine the relationship of centrai University services to the
several schools; the nature of the interrelationships among
schools and between schools and central academic, student,
and administrative support services; and the various funding
patterns for both school and non-school budgets.
Of central concern, however, is the question of whether a
budget formula arrangement provides a relative advantage in
respect to programmatic autonomy, financial discretion, or
standard of academic living over other schools. A similar
question is whether the formula schools have a greater ability
directly to make trade-offs of ancillary services than schools
where those services are provided from budgets not under the
dean's control.
A further set of questions would deal with whether for
mula arrangements are themselves the causal agent in individ
ual situations or whether a school's unique situation is merely
reflected in the form of its budget.
In considering whether formula arrangements might be
expanded, the task force will need to examine the extent and
cost of essential central services and alternatives for their
support as well as the cost of accounting for them.

the University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission which

In recommending the creation of this task force, the

less integral relationship, should be attenuated oi eliminated.
In examining student services and activities, the task force
should be alert to ways in which budgets might be reduced
through restructuring or reordering priorities. Attention to
concerns of the following kinds might, for example, produce
modifications which would still achieve essential goals but at
lower costs:
Scope and depth. Are there areas where the essential
purpose of an activity can be preserved even though its
extent is diminished? Are there areas where the range of
services should be preserved but the degree of assistance
offered reduced, leaving to individuals to pursue matters in
greater depth?
Alternatively structured services. Some offices themselves
provide the service with which they are associated; others
merely facilitate that service or activity. Can more nonaca
demic student functions be performed on the latter bases,
with the University's formal role being to help organizfe and
monitor rather than run such functions?
Payment by users. Are there student services and activities
which might properly be paid for by those who use them
rather than be covered within the tuition charge?
Duplication and consolidation. Are there services wfiich
are essentially similar but which are offered at department,
school, and University levels? If so, is such duplication essen
tial? Are there services which are now distributed which
could be effective and more economical if consobdated?

Academic Calendar and Utilization of the Academic Plant
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Commission wrote:
This topic includes inquiring into such questions as the
economic educational impact of a full-four-quarter calendar:

the possibilities of a semester system, including the corollary
effect of a necessary reexamination of every course offering

student body, the resulting restrictions on faculty research
options; the possibilities of part-time student status; and like
matters. The variety and complexity of the relevant factors
are great, and any change having significant financial impact
would take careful planning and much time to implement.
This task force is asked to examine the range of relevant
issues and alternatives (Of which examples arc given above)
and determine those where change would be likely to pro
duce a significant and positive economic impact not only
without harm to the academic program but perhaps en

The task is one of proposing and examining alternatives'
which generate cost savings or income increases and then
judging their feasibility. Definitive studies are not expected,
although the commission will welcome work that goes be

TASK FORCE IV
Professorial Rank and Faculty Development
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
The long-term thrust of the University depends on a
process of constant faculty renewal, an aspect of academic
development that even in normal times responds to the
competing tensions inherent in the tenure system.
When money is tight, the system comes under severe
strain. The necessity for a continuous infusion of voung
strength in a distinguished faculty is unquestioned.
In times of crisis there are factors at work in the budget
ary process that pull in opposite directions: on the one hand
junior faculty billets are decreased by their vulnerability to
elimination; on the other they are increased by the attraction
of replacing a retiring senior professor with a less costly
junior one. Both forces are at work. In particular situations
-either one nor the other is necessarily wrong.
What is required by the commission now is a precise
analysis of fact and rationale, by department and school, that
will make clear not only the relationship between the oppor
tunities for junior faculty and the effect of />articular depart
mental recommendations, but also the shape of long-term
University initiative.
The matter of faculty renewal is many sided. It includes
but is not limited to these aspects:
maintaining opportunities to appoint new assistant profes
sors;
maintaining opportunities to achieve tenure through pro
motion;
maintaining opportunities to appoint new tenured faculty
maintaining faculty affirmative action;
facilitating individual shifts of intellectual field:
providing opportunities for early retirement;

Space paid for by News and Publication Services

providing opportunities for part time service;
examining tenure ratios and age distributions.
This task force is asked to examine the age and .rank
distribution of the present faculty, assess the effects of the
1975-76 Operating Budget recommendations on those fac
tors, study by area the likely consequences of possible alter
native plans for selective increases and decreases in the num
bers of faculty positions over the coming two to four years,
and develop concepts and criteria to be applied in the review
of budget recommendations for 1976-77 and 1977-78 as they
affect faculty renewal.
TASK FORCE VI
Professional Schools and the Operating Budget
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
Special circumstances having to do partly with school
restricted endowment strength and partly with necessary
autonomy in academic programming make for varying de
grees of independence of the professional schools.
With respect to University budget matters, this necessary
semi-autonomy expresses itself differently for cach school,
not only because of intrinsic differences among them but also
because changing fiscal and operational circumstances require
periodic adjustments of the basic relationships between
school budgets and general University unrestricted funds.
We think it appropriate that the commission examine
these relationships and their impact on the Operating Budget,
and in particular to ask if the allocation-by-formula [to the
School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Business/ is
equitable and whether other schools should be put on the
same basis.
In undertaking this review, the task force will perforce
examine the relationship of centrai University services to the
several schools; the nature of the interrelationships among
schools and between schools and central academic, student,
and administrative support services; and the various funding
patterns for both school and non-school budgets.
Of central concern, however, is the question of whether a
budget formula arrangement provides a relative advantage in
respect to programmatic autonomy, financial discretion, or
standard of academic living over other schools. A similar
question is whether the formula schools have a greater ability
directly to make trade-offs of ancillary services than schools
where those services are provided from budgets not under the
dean's control.
A further set of questions would deal with whether for
mula arrangements are themselves the causal agent in individ
ual situations or whether a school's unique situation is merely
reflected in the form of its budget.
In considering whether formula arrangements might be
expanded, the task force will need to examine the extent and
cost of essential central services and alternatives for their
support as well as the cost of accounting for them.
Following arc excerpts from charges to five task forces of
the University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission which
the Senate Committee to Consider Problems of Higher Edu
cation deems particularly pertinent to its report.
TASK FORCE I
The Size and Function oj the University Administration and
Other Support Services
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
The range of functions included in /the terms "University
Administration and other support services"/ -which might be
looked upon as any activity not involving the faculty in
direct teaching and research-is very wide, embracing such
disparate employees as librarians and firemen, departmental
secretaries and payroll clerks, deans and plumbers, the Presi
dent's staff and a professor 's lab technician. Precision in
defining the various functions, and care in analyzing cost and
benefits, are essential to a considered judgment of priorities.
The present University financial situation makes necessary
a thorough review and evaluation of the nature, size, scope,
and quality of the activities called "administrative and other
support services." This task force is asked to conduct that
review and evaluation, dividing its work into two parts:
1. A description of the area of concern. The task force
should begin its work by describing the totality of adminis
trative and other support services in categories or classifica
tions that will facilitate effective further communication and
review. A report by the task force at the earliest opportunity
within a few weeks of its formation will be helpful to all with
whom the evaluative aspects of this charge will be discussed.
2. An evaluation of the purpose and structure of the
subject services. Early in the autumn 1974 review of budget
alternatives, these criteria for evaluating support services were
suggested:
Necessity: Is the service necessary at all? If it is, what is its
minimum necessary size? (On what grounds is it necessary?
What function does it perform? For whom? What would be
the consequences of its reduction or elimination?)
Economy and effectiveness: is the function structured in
the most economical way to meet its minimum essential
responsibilities? (Has its structure been recently reviewed
from this point of view? Can it be repatterned or reduced to
be effective at less cost? What are the likely consequences of
a less costly structuring?)
Quality of staffing and direction: Is the service well mana
ged?
The task force is requested to concentrate its efforts on
the first two criteria. Clarity, insight, and informed discus
sions on these will help responsible officers make judgments
about the third. This task force should coordinate its work
with the Task Force on Student Services and Activities.
OtheT University committees may also be able to offer useful
advice and insight.

TASK FORCE II
Student Support Services and Activities
In recommeiiding the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:

materially supportive of it, to tangential if not irrelevant to
it. We need some help with both fact and rationale. . .preci

will make clear not only the relationship between the oppor
tunities for junior faculty and the effect of />articular depart
mental recommendations, but also the shape of long-term
University initiative.
The matter of faculty renewal is many sided. It includes
but is not limited to these aspects:
maintaining opportunities to appoint new assistant profes
sors;
maintaining opportunities to achieve tenure through pro
motion;
maintaining opportunities to appoint new tenured faculty
maintaining faculty affirmative action;
facilitating individual shifts of intellectual field:
providing opportunities for early retirement;

Space paid for by News and Publication Services

providing opportunities for part time service;
examining tenure ratios and age distributions.
This task force is asked to examine the age and .rank
distribution of the present faculty, assess the effects of the
1975-76 Operating Budget recommendations on those fac
tors, study by area the likely consequences of possible alter
native plans for selective increases and decreases in the num
bers of faculty positions over the coming two to four years,
and develop concepts and criteria to be applied in the review
of budget recommendations for 1976-77 and 1977-78 as they
affect faculty renewal.
TASK FORCE VI
Professional Schools and the Operating Budget
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
Special circumstances having to do partly with school
restricted endowment strength and partly with necessary
autonomy in academic programming make for varying de
grees of independence of the professional schools.
With respect to University budget matters, this necessary
semi-autonomy expresses itself differently for cach school,
not only because of intrinsic differences among them but also
because changing fiscal and operational circumstances require
periodic adjustments of the basic relationships between
school budgets and general University unrestricted funds.
We think it appropriate that the commission examine
these relationships and their impact on the Operating Budget,
and in particular to ask if the allocation-by-formula [to the
School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Business/ is
equitable and whether other schools should be put on the
same basis.
In undertaking this review, the task force will perforce
examine the relationship of centrai University services to the
several schools; the nature of the interrelationships among
schools and between schools and central academic, student,
and administrative support services; and the various funding
patterns for both school and non-school budgets.
Of central concern, however, is the question of whether a
budget formula arrangement provides a relative advantage in
respect to programmatic autonomy, financial discretion, or
standard of academic living over other schools. A similar
question is whether the formula schools have a greater ability
directly to make trade-offs of ancillary services than schools
where those services are provided from budgets not under the
dean's control.
A further set of questions would deal with whether for
mula arrangements are themselves the causal agent in individ
ual situations or whether a school's unique situation is merely
reflected in the form of its budget.
In considering whether formula arrangements might be
expanded, the task force will need to examine the extent and
cost of essential central services and alternatives for their
support as well as the cost of accounting for them.
Following arc excerpts from charges to five task forces of
the University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission which
the Senate Committee to Consider Problems of Higher Edu
cation deems particularly pertinent to its report.
TASK FORCE I
The Size and Function oj the University Administration and
Other Support Services
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
The range of functions included in /the terms "University
Administration and other support services"/ -which might be
looked upon as any activity not involving the faculty in
direct teaching and research-is very wide, embracing such
disparate employees as librarians and firemen, departmental
secretaries and payroll clerks, deans and plumbers, the Presi
dent's staff and a professor 's lab technician. Precision in
defining the various functions, and care in analyzing cost and
benefits, are essential to a considered judgment of priorities.
The present University financial situation makes necessary
a thorough review and evaluation of the nature, size, scope,
and quality of the activities called "administrative and other
support services." This task force is asked to conduct that
review and evaluation, dividing its work into two parts:
1. A description of the area of concern. The task force
should begin its work by describing the totality of adminis
trative and other support services in categories or classifica
tions that will facilitate effective further communication and
review. A report by the task force at the earliest opportunity
within a few weeks of its formation will be helpful to all with
whom the evaluative aspects of this charge will be discussed.
2. An evaluation of the purpose and structure of the
subject services. Early in the autumn 1974 review of budget
alternatives, these criteria for evaluating support services were
suggested:
Necessity: Is the service necessary at all? If it is, what is its
minimum necessary size? (On what grounds is it necessary?
What function does it perform? For whom? What would be
the consequences of its reduction or elimination?)
Economy and effectiveness: is the function structured in
the most economical way to meet its minimum essential
responsibilities? (Has its structure been recently reviewed
from this point of view? Can it be repatterned or reduced to
be effective at less cost? What are the likely consequences of
a less costly structuring?)
Quality of staffing and direction: Is the service well mana
ged?
The task force is requested to concentrate its efforts on
the first two criteria. Clarity, insight, and informed discus
sions on these will help responsible officers make judgments
about the third. This task force should coordinate its work
with the Task Force on Student Services and Activities.
OtheT University committees may also be able to offer useful
advice and insight.

TASK FORCE II
Student Support Services and Activities
In recommeiiding the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
This topic, covering as it does housing as well as psycho
logical counseling, intramural sports as well as career place
ment, and medical care as well as the ASSU, has some of the
aspects of the first in that it includes a wide range o)
activities that from different perspectives are seen on a spec
trum ranging from integral to the academic process, through
materially supportive of it, to tangential if not irrelevant to
it. We need some help with both fact and rationale. . .preci
sion in analysis is important.
The overall job of this task force is to study student
support services and activities in order to evaluate which ones
should, because of their integral relationship, to University
purposes and process, be continued and which, because of a
less integral relationship, should be attenuated oi eliminated.
In examining student services and activities, the task force
should be alert to ways in which budgets might be reduced
through restructuring or reordering priorities. Attention to
concerns of the following kinds might, for example, produce
modifications which would still achieve essential goals but at
lower costs:
Scope and depth. Are there areas where the essential
purpose of an activity can be preserved even though its
extent is diminished? Are there areas where the range of
services should be preserved but the degree of assistance
offered reduced, leaving to individuals to pursue matters in
greater depth?
Alternatively structured services. Some offices themselves
provide the service with which they are associated; others
merely facilitate that service or activity. Can more nonaca
demic student functions be performed on the latter bases,
with the University's formal role being to help organizfe and
monitor rather than run such functions?
Payment by users. Are there student services and activities
which might properly be paid for by those who use them
rather than be covered within the tuition charge?
Duplication and consolidation. Are there services wfiich
are essentially similar but which are offered at department,
school, and University levels? If so, is such duplication essen
tial? Are there services which are now distributed which
could be effective and more economical if consobdated?
TASK FORCE 111
Academic Calendar and Utilization of the Academic Plant
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Commission wrote:
This topic includes inquiring into such questions as the
economic educational impact of a full-four-quarter calendar:

the possibilities of a semester system, including the corollary
effect of a necessary reexamination of every course offering
in the University; the feasibility and wisdom of tuition differ
entials; the impact of any calendar change on the size of the
student body, the resulting restrictions on faculty research
options; the possibilities of part-time student status; and like
matters. The variety and complexity of the relevant factors
are great, and any change having significant financial impact
would take careful planning and much time to implement.
This task force is asked to examine the range of relevant
issues and alternatives (Of which examples arc given above)
and determine those where change would be likely to pro
duce a significant and positive economic impact not only
without harm to the academic program but perhaps en
hancing it as well.
The task is one of proposing and examining alternatives'
which generate cost savings or income increases and then
judging their feasibility. Definitive studies are not expected,
although the commission will welcome work that goes be
yond the feasibility stage.
TASK FORCE IV
Professorial Rank and Faculty Development
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
The long-term thrust of the University depends on a
process of constant faculty renewal, an aspect of academic
development that even in normal times responds to the
competing tensions inherent in the tenure system.
When money is tight, the system comes under severe
strain. The necessity for a continuous infusion of voung
strength in a distinguished faculty is unquestioned.
In times of crisis there are factors at work in the budget
ary process that pull in opposite directions: on the one hand
junior faculty billets are decreased by their vulnerability to
elimination; on the other they are increased by the attraction
of replacing a retiring senior professor with a less costly
junior one. Both forces are at work. In particular situations
-either one nor the other is necessarily wrong.
What is required by the commission now is a precise
analysis of fact and rationale, by department and school, that

The present University financial situation makes necessary
a thorough review and evaluation of the nature, size, scope,
and quality of the activities called "administrative and other
support services." This task force is asked to conduct that
review and evaluation, dividing its work into two parts:
1. A description of the area of concern. The task force
should begin its work by describing the totality of adminis
trative and other support services in categories or classifica
tions that will facilitate effective further communication and
review. A report by the task force at the earliest opportunity
within a few weeks of its formation will be helpful to all with
whom the evaluative aspects of this charge will be discussed.
2. An evaluation of the purpose and structure of the
subject services. Early in the autumn 1974 review of budget
alternatives, these criteria for evaluating support services were
suggested:
Necessity: Is the service necessary at all? If it is, what is its
minimum necessary size? (On what grounds is it necessary?
What function does it perform? For whom? What would be
the consequences of its reduction or elimination?)
Economy and effectiveness: is the function structured in
the most economical way to meet its minimum essential
responsibilities? (Has its structure been recently reviewed
from this point of view? Can it be repatterned or reduced to
be effective at less cost? What are the likely consequences of
a less costly structuring?)
Quality of staffing and direction: Is the service well mana
ged?
The task force is requested to concentrate its efforts on
the first two criteria. Clarity, insight, and informed discus
sions on these will help responsible officers make judgments
about the third. This task force should coordinate its work
with the Task Force on Student Services and Activities.
OtheT University committees may also be able to offer useful
advice and insight.

TASK FORCE II
Student Support Services and Activities
In recommeiiding the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:

it. We need some help with both fact and rationale. . .preci

The overall job of this task force is to study student
support services and activities in order to evaluate which ones
should, because of their integral relationship, to University
purposes and process, be continued and which, because of a
less integral relationship, should be attenuated oi eliminated.
In examining student services and activities, the task force
should be alert to ways in which budgets might be reduced
through restructuring or reordering priorities. Attention to
concerns of the following kinds might, for example, produce
modifications which would still achieve essential goals but at
lower costs:
Scope and depth. Are there areas where the essential
purpose of an activity can be preserved even though its
extent is diminished? Are there areas where the range of
services should be preserved but the degree of assistance
offered reduced, leaving to individuals to pursue matters in
greater depth?
Alternatively structured services. Some offices themselves
provide the service with which they are associated; others
merely facilitate that service or activity. Can more nonaca
demic student functions be performed on the latter bases,
with the University's formal role being to help organizfe and
monitor rather than run such functions?
Payment by users. Are there student services and activities
which might properly be paid for by those who use them
rather than be covered within the tuition charge?
Duplication and consolidation. Are there services wfiich
are essentially similar but which are offered at department,
school, and University levels? If so, is such duplication essen
tial? Are there services which are now distributed which
could be effective and more economical if consobdated?
TASK FORCE 111
Academic Calendar and Utilization of the Academic Plant
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Commission wrote:
This topic includes inquiring into such questions as the
economic educational impact of a full-four-quarter calendar:

the possibilities of a semester system, including the corollary
effect of a necessary reexamination of every course offering
in the University; the feasibility and wisdom of tuition differ
entials; the impact of any calendar change on the size of the
student body, the resulting restrictions on faculty research
options; the possibilities of part-time student status; and like
matters. The variety and complexity of the relevant factors
are great, and any change having significant financial impact
would take careful planning and much time to implement.
This task force is asked to examine the range of relevant
issues and alternatives (Of which examples arc given above)
and determine those where change would be likely to pro
duce a significant and positive economic impact not only
without harm to the academic program but perhaps en
hancing it as well.
The task is one of proposing and examining alternatives'
which generate cost savings or income increases and then
judging their feasibility. Definitive studies are not expected,
although the commission will welcome work that goes be

TASK FORCE IV
Professorial Rank and Faculty Development
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
The long-term thrust of the University depends on a
process of constant faculty renewal, an aspect of academic
development that even in normal times responds to the
competing tensions inherent in the tenure system.
When money is tight, the system comes under severe
strain. The necessity for a continuous infusion of voung
strength in a distinguished faculty is unquestioned.
In times of crisis there are factors at work in the budget
ary process that pull in opposite directions: on the one hand
junior faculty billets are decreased by their vulnerability to
elimination; on the other they are increased by the attraction
of replacing a retiring senior professor with a less costly
junior one. Both forces are at work. In particular situations
-either one nor the other is necessarily wrong.
What is required by the commission now is a precise
analysis of fact and rationale, by department and school, that
will make clear not only the relationship between the oppor
tunities for junior faculty and the effect of />articular depart
mental recommendations, but also the shape of long-term
University initiative.
The matter of faculty renewal is many sided. It includes
but is not limited to these aspects:
maintaining opportunities to appoint new assistant profes
sors;
maintaining opportunities to achieve tenure through pro
motion;
maintaining opportunities to appoint new tenured faculty
maintaining faculty affirmative action;
facilitating individual shifts of intellectual field:
providing opportunities for early retirement;

Space paid for by News and Publication Services

providing opportunities for part time service;
examining tenure ratios and age distributions.
This task force is asked to examine the age and .rank
distribution of the present faculty, assess the effects of the
1975-76 Operating Budget recommendations on those fac
tors, study by area the likely consequences of possible alter
native plans for selective increases and decreases in the num
bers of faculty positions over the coming two to four years,
and develop concepts and criteria to be applied in the review
of budget recommendations for 1976-77 and 1977-78 as they
affect faculty renewal.
TASK FORCE VI
Professional Schools and the Operating Budget
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
Special circumstances having to do partly with school
restricted endowment strength and partly with necessary
autonomy in academic programming make for varying de
grees of independence of the professional schools.
With respect to University budget matters, this necessary
semi-autonomy expresses itself differently for cach school,
not only because of intrinsic differences among them but also
because changing fiscal and operational circumstances require
periodic adjustments of the basic relationships between
school budgets and general University unrestricted funds.
We think it appropriate that the commission examine
these relationships and their impact on the Operating Budget,
and in particular to ask if the allocation-by-formula [to the
School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Business/ is
equitable and whether other schools should be put on the
same basis.
In undertaking this review, the task force will perforce
examine the relationship of centrai University services to the
several schools; the nature of the interrelationships among
schools and between schools and central academic, student,
and administrative support services; and the various funding
patterns for both school and non-school budgets.
Of central concern, however, is the question of whether a
budget formula arrangement provides a relative advantage in
respect to programmatic autonomy, financial discretion, or
standard of academic living over other schools. A similar
question is whether the formula schools have a greater ability
directly to make trade-offs of ancillary services than schools
where those services are provided from budgets not under the
dean's control.
A further set of questions would deal with whether for
mula arrangements are themselves the causal agent in individ
ual situations or whether a school's unique situation is merely
reflected in the form of its budget.
In considering whether formula arrangements might be
expanded, the task force will need to examine the extent and
cost of essential central services and alternatives for their
support as well as the cost of accounting for them.
Following arc excerpts from charges to five task forces of
the University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission which
the Senate Committee to Consider Problems of Higher Edu

services should be preserved but the degree of assistance
offered reduced, leaving to individuals to pursue matters in
greater depth?
Alternatively structured services. Some offices themselves
provide the service with which they are associated; others
merely facilitate that service or activity. Can more nonaca
demic student functions be performed on the latter bases,
with the University's formal role being to help organizfe and
monitor rather than run such functions?
Payment by users. Are there student services and activities
which might properly be paid for by those who use them
rather than be covered within the tuition charge?
Duplication and consolidation. Are there services wfiich
are essentially similar but which are offered at department,
school, and University levels? If so, is such duplication essen
tial? Are there services which are now distributed which
could be effective and more economical if consobdated?
TASK FORCE 111
Academic Calendar and Utilization of the Academic Plant
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Commission wrote:
This topic includes inquiring into such questions as the
economic educational impact of a full-four-quarter calendar:

the possibilities of a semester system, including the corollary
effect of a necessary reexamination of every course offering
in the University; the feasibility and wisdom of tuition differ
entials; the impact of any calendar change on the size of the
student body, the resulting restrictions on faculty research
options; the possibilities of part-time student status; and like
matters. The variety and complexity of the relevant factors
are great, and any change having significant financial impact
would take careful planning and much time to implement.
This task force is asked to examine the range of relevant
issues and alternatives (Of which examples arc given above)
and determine those where change would be likely to pro
duce a significant and positive economic impact not only
without harm to the academic program but perhaps en
hancing it as well.
The task is one of proposing and examining alternatives'
which generate cost savings or income increases and then
judging their feasibility. Definitive studies are not expected,
although the commission will welcome work that goes be
yond the feasibility stage.
TASK FORCE IV
Professorial Rank and Faculty Development
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
The long-term thrust of the University depends on a
process of constant faculty renewal, an aspect of academic
development that even in normal times responds to the
competing tensions inherent in the tenure system.
When money is tight, the system comes under severe
strain. The necessity for a continuous infusion of voung
strength in a distinguished faculty is unquestioned.
In times of crisis there are factors at work in the budget
ary process that pull in opposite directions: on the one hand
junior faculty billets are decreased by their vulnerability to
elimination; on the other they are increased by the attraction
of replacing a retiring senior professor with a less costly
junior one. Both forces are at work. In particular situations
-either one nor the other is necessarily wrong.
What is required by the commission now is a precise
analysis of fact and rationale, by department and school, that
will make clear not only the relationship between the oppor
tunities for junior faculty and the effect of />articular depart
mental recommendations, but also the shape of long-term
University initiative.
The matter of faculty renewal is many sided. It includes
but is not limited to these aspects:
maintaining opportunities to appoint new assistant profes
sors;
maintaining opportunities to achieve tenure through pro
motion;
maintaining opportunities to appoint new tenured faculty
maintaining faculty affirmative action;
facilitating individual shifts of intellectual field:
providing opportunities for early retirement;

Space paid for by News and Publication Services

providing opportunities for part time service;
examining tenure ratios and age distributions.
This task force is asked to examine the age and .rank
distribution of the present faculty, assess the effects of the
1975-76 Operating Budget recommendations on those fac
tors, study by area the likely consequences of possible alter
native plans for selective increases and decreases in the num
bers of faculty positions over the coming two to four years,
and develop concepts and criteria to be applied in the review
of budget recommendations for 1976-77 and 1977-78 as they
affect faculty renewal.
TASK FORCE VI
Professional Schools and the Operating Budget
In recommending the creation of this task force, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory Commission wrote:
Special circumstances having to do partly with school
restricted endowment strength and partly with necessary
autonomy in academic programming make for varying de
grees of independence of the professional schools.
With respect to University budget matters, this necessary
semi-autonomy expresses itself differently for cach school,
not only because of intrinsic differences among them but also
because changing fiscal and operational circumstances require
periodic adjustments of the basic relationships between
school budgets and general University unrestricted funds.
We think it appropriate that the commission examine
these relationships and their impact on the Operating Budget,
and in particular to ask if the allocation-by-formula [to the
School of Medicine and the Graduate School of Business/ is
equitable and whether other schools should be put on the
same basis.
In undertaking this review, the task force will perforce
examine the relationship of centrai University services to the
several schools; the nature of the interrelationships among
schools and between schools and central academic, student,
and administrative support services; and the various funding
patterns for both school and non-school budgets.
Of central concern, however, is the question of whether a
budget formula arrangement provides a relative advantage in
respect to programmatic autonomy, financial discretion, or
standard of academic living over other schools. A similar
question is whether the formula schools have a greater ability
directly to make trade-offs of ancillary services than schools
where those services are provided from budgets not under the
dean's control.
A further set of questions would deal with whether for
mula arrangements are themselves the causal agent in individ
ual situations or whether a school's unique situation is merely
reflected in the form of its budget.
In considering whether formula arrangements might be
expanded, the task force will need to examine the extent and
cost of essential central services and alternatives for their
support as well as the cost of accounting for them.
