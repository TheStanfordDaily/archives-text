# McCloskey Blasts Kissinger
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) last week blamed
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for preventing President
Ford from receiving "hard data" on the military situation
in Indochina.
"The danger is that Ford will only get the intelligence
information that Kissinger feels he should," McCloskey said
in an interview with the Daily from his Washington office.
Early last week, McCloskey wrote Ford, "[T]he hard
intelligence summaries prepared by the CIA [Central
Intelligence Agency] could be distorted by their passage
through the hands of State and Defense Department people
who desired that intelligence summaries be supportive of
past or current policy success."
The policy that McCloskey opposed was military aid to
South Vietnam. He voted against a House bill authorizing
$327 million for humanitarian and evacuation programs. "I
feared that Kissinger might use B-52 power in Vietnam"
with the powers granted him by the bill, he said.
No Difference
However, in a speech here last month, McCloskey came
out in favor of aid to Cambodia to prevent massive killing
of innocent people by the Khmer Rouge.
McCloskey predicted that 30,000 people would die in
fighting before the beginning of the rainy season June 1 if
aid were not provided.
In retrospect, however, McCloskey said that the "aid [to
Vietnam] would not have helped; I'm not sure thai the aid
would have made a difference."
While McCloskey supported Cambodian aid, the
"Vietnam situation is different. We created South
Vietnam," he said. "The [U.S.] government will have no
chance of preventing the takeover of Saigon."
'Felt Like Resigning'
McCloskey called on the CIA — "the only accurate
appraiser of [overseas] activities" — to provide Ford with
the necessary information to assess the Indochina conflict.
"I found CIA intelligence not covered by policy-makers. We
need to preserve a CIA intelligence capacity," he said.
After Ford's State of the World address, "I felt like
resigning my seat in Congress," McCloskey said, because of
the President's call for increased aid to Vietnam. That call
for aid, according to many press reports, came at Kissinger's
insistence.
Kissinger's "value system" is not appropriate to the Ford
administration, McCloskey said. "Ford needs a secretary of
state with the same value system that he has. Kissinger's
values are ruled by people like Metternich and Bismarck. He
practices deception and obfuscation in foreign diplomacy."
The basic fault in Kissinger's foreign policy is that it
does not "take people into account," McCloskey said.
"Kissinger wants to move people around like pieces on a
chessboard."
McCloskey suggested Elliot Richardson, U.S. Ambassador
to Great Britain, as the prime candidate to replace Kissinger

in the secretary of state post. Richardson, a former
undersecretary of state; secretary of health, education and
Welfare; secretary of defense and attorney general, received
McCloskey's support because he is "suited to the Ford
style."
On the economy, McCloskey said he voted against the
congressional tax bill last month because of the severe
deficit spending it mandated. The Ford plan for a smaller
tax cut was "the better economic program," McCloskey
said.
However, the congressional tax legislation did contain
some advantageous proposals for the United States: "The
ending of the oil depletion allowance is appropriate,"
McCloskey said.
In addition, he thought that the congressional bill had a
"more fair" tax rebate plan than ihat proposed by Ford.
Ford's proposal extended a greater share of the tax rebates
to higher income groups than did the congressional version.

Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) last week blamed
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for preventing President
Ford from receiving "hard data" on the military situation
in Indochina.
"The danger is that Ford will only get the intelligence
information that Kissinger feels he should," McCloskey said
in an interview with the Daily from his Washington office.
Early last week, McCloskey wrote Ford, "[T]he hard
intelligence summaries prepared by the CIA [Central
Intelligence Agency] could be distorted by their passage
through the hands of State and Defense Department people
who desired that intelligence summaries be supportive of
past or current policy success."
The policy that McCloskey opposed was military aid to
South Vietnam. He voted against a House bill authorizing
$327 million for humanitarian and evacuation programs. "I
feared that Kissinger might use B-52 power in Vietnam"
with the powers granted him by the bill, he said.
No Difference
However, in a speech here last month, McCloskey came
out in favor of aid to Cambodia to prevent massive killing
of innocent people by the Khmer Rouge.
McCloskey predicted that 30,000 people would die in
fighting before the beginning of the rainy season June 1 if
aid were not provided.
In retrospect, however, McCloskey said that the "aid [to
Vietnam] would not have helped; I'm not sure thai the aid
would have made a difference."
While McCloskey supported Cambodian aid, the
"Vietnam situation is different. We created South
Vietnam," he said. "The [U.S.] government will have no
chance of preventing the takeover of Saigon."
'Felt Like Resigning'
McCloskey called on the CIA — "the only accurate
appraiser of [overseas] activities" — to provide Ford with
the necessary information to assess the Indochina conflict.
"I found CIA intelligence not covered by policy-makers. We
need to preserve a CIA intelligence capacity," he said.
After Ford's State of the World address, "I felt like
resigning my seat in Congress," McCloskey said, because of
the President's call for increased aid to Vietnam. That call
for aid, according to many press reports, came at Kissinger's
insistence.
Kissinger's "value system" is not appropriate to the Ford
administration, McCloskey said. "Ford needs a secretary of
state with the same value system that he has. Kissinger's
values are ruled by people like Metternich and Bismarck. He
practices deception and obfuscation in foreign diplomacy."
The basic fault in Kissinger's foreign policy is that it
does not "take people into account," McCloskey said.
"Kissinger wants to move people around like pieces on a
chessboard."
McCloskey suggested Elliot Richardson, U.S. Ambassador
to Great Britain, as the prime candidate to replace Kissinger

in the secretary of state post. Richardson, a former
undersecretary of state; secretary of health, education and
Welfare; secretary of defense and attorney general, received
McCloskey's support because he is "suited to the Ford
style."
On the economy, McCloskey said he voted against the
congressional tax bill last month because of the severe
deficit spending it mandated. The Ford plan for a smaller
tax cut was "the better economic program," McCloskey
said.
However, the congressional tax legislation did contain
some advantageous proposals for the United States: "The
ending of the oil depletion allowance is appropriate,"
McCloskey said.
In addition, he thought that the congressional bill had a
"more fair" tax rebate plan than ihat proposed by Ford.
Ford's proposal extended a greater share of the tax rebates
