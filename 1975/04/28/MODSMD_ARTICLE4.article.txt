# New Report Recommends Less Costly Parking Plan
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Annual parking fees for campus
parking should be substantially lower
than those suggested in the Carpenter
parking study, a new report
recommends.
The report, written by the
University Committee on Land and
Building Development (C-LBD),
recommends that annual parking fees
be $48 for faculty, $40 for staff and
$32 for off-campus students using
spaces designated as convenient.
Parking in less convenient areas
would be free.
The earlier study by Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs, recommended fees of
$60 per year i:. the central academic
zone.
First Step
"The Carpenter study was a
necessary and valuable first step," said
Law Prof. Charles Meyers, C-LBD
chairman. But he added that the
C-LBD report's "gradual changes"
were p*eferable to the Carpenter
report's ' abrupt ones."
"Under the new plan, all motor
vehicles jegularly used on campus
would be registered without charge,"
Meyers said. "There would be no
parking regulations in the faculty-staff
residence area. On-campus students
would not be permitted to park in the
academic zone."
The report calls for an initial
allocation of 4800 spaces for the
academic zone and approximately
3600 for a free zone. About 200
spaces in the Wilbur Hall parking lot
would be allocated exclusively for
free off-campus student parking.
Students living on campus would
pay $5 per quarter for parking, but
charges for this purpose in current
rental fees would be eliminated,
according to the report.
"Thus Escondido Village would
retain its system of one parking space
per dwelling unit, and other student
residences would continue with the
present system of assigned lots," said
Meyers. "There would be no sale of
more permits than there are spaces in
these residences areas."
Meyers declined to say whether he
thought his committee's report to
University President Richard Lyman
would be approved, but he did say,
"In that these proposals have very
strong support from various groups,
the chances for change are pretty

good."
The report also suggests that all
funds collected from parking fees go
to a special fund.
"The money would be used to
reduce the use of private vehicles —
automobiles and the like — in central
campus areas," according to Meyers.
New Committee
More specifically, Meyers said the
money might be used for the upkeep
of bike paths and to help support a
shuttle bus and improved street
lighting on campus.
The report recommends that a
faculty-staff-student committee be
established to determine priorities for
expenditures of parking revenues.
According to the report, the new
group would include three staff
members, three faculty members and
three students.
One representative each from the
Director of Public Safety, Facilities

Planning Office and the Provost's
Office would serve as ex officio
members, while the Vice President for
Business and Finance would be in
charge of administering the group's
policies.
'Might Work Out'
Escondido Village Council
President Cathie Colson said that she
thought that the new report, if
adopted, "is going to work out okay."
She agreed that the cut in rates
from the Carpenter study figures was
"considerable."
She criticized the report for not
being more specific on funds
designation.
She also said she wished the
committee had recommended parking
charges for "people from the outside
who come to campus to see public
events."

were p*eferable to the Carpenter
report's ' abrupt ones."
"Under the new plan, all motor
vehicles jegularly used on campus
would be registered without charge,"
Meyers said. "There would be no
parking regulations in the faculty-staff
residence area. On-campus students
would not be permitted to park in the
academic zone."
The report calls for an initial
allocation of 4800 spaces for the
academic zone and approximately
3600 for a free zone. About 200
spaces in the Wilbur Hall parking lot
would be allocated exclusively for
free off-campus student parking.
Students living on campus would
pay $5 per quarter for parking, but
charges for this purpose in current
rental fees would be eliminated,
according to the report.
"Thus Escondido Village would
retain its system of one parking space
per dwelling unit, and other student
residences would continue with the
present system of assigned lots," said
Meyers. "There would be no sale of
more permits than there are spaces in
these residences areas."
Meyers declined to say whether he
thought his committee's report to
University President Richard Lyman
would be approved, but he did say,
"In that these proposals have very
strong support from various groups,
the chances for change are pretty

good."
The report also suggests that all
funds collected from parking fees go
to a special fund.
"The money would be used to
reduce the use of private vehicles —
automobiles and the like — in central
campus areas," according to Meyers.
New Committee
More specifically, Meyers said the
money might be used for the upkeep
of bike paths and to help support a
shuttle bus and improved street
lighting on campus.
The report recommends that a
faculty-staff-student committee be
established to determine priorities for
expenditures of parking revenues.
According to the report, the new
group would include three staff
members, three faculty members and
three students.
One representative each from the
Director of Public Safety, Facilities

Planning Office and the Provost's
Office would serve as ex officio
members, while the Vice President for
Business and Finance would be in
charge of administering the group's
policies.
'Might Work Out'
Escondido Village Council
President Cathie Colson said that she
thought that the new report, if
adopted, "is going to work out okay."
She agreed that the cut in rates
from the Carpenter study figures was
"considerable."
She criticized the report for not
being more specific on funds
designation.
She also said she wished the
committee had recommended parking
charges for "people from the outside
who come to campus to see public
events."
Annual parking fees for campus
parking should be substantially lower
than those suggested in the Carpenter
parking study, a new report
recommends.
The report, written by the
University Committee on Land and
Building Development (C-LBD),
recommends that annual parking fees
be $48 for faculty, $40 for staff and
$32 for off-campus students using
spaces designated as convenient.
Parking in less convenient areas
would be free.
The earlier study by Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs, recommended fees of
$60 per year i:. the central academic
zone.
First Step
"The Carpenter study was a
necessary and valuable first step," said
Law Prof. Charles Meyers, C-LBD
chairman. But he added that the
C-LBD report's "gradual changes"
were p*eferable to the Carpenter
report's ' abrupt ones."
