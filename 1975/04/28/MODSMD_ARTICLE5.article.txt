# Mancall Predicts Cuts For Overseas Studies
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Overseas studies programs will
likely have to cut enrollment despite
an increase in their popularity.
Although enrollment at the 10
overseas programs increased seven
percent this year and will likely
increase by the same amount next
year, the Overseas Studies Office must
reduce expenditures from $1,582,242
this year to $800,000 by 1978,
according to Overseas Studies Director
Mark Mancall.
"We have a real paradox, cutting
the budget at a time when student
interest is increasing," he said.
Mancall added that he didn't know
by how much or at what locations
enrollment would have to be reduced.
However, he explained some cuts are
inevitable unless the trend of
increasing costs because of unfavorable
foreign exchange and inflation rates
reverses drastically.
Cost-Sharing
The Overseas Studies Office and the
Committee on Foreign Studies
Program (C-FSP) are developing policy
for the largest budget cuts.
Mancall said it was too soon to
make recommendations, but explained
one option is sharing costs with other
universities while allowing their

students to enroll at Stanford overseas
campuses. Stanford instructors would
still teach as many courses as they do
now, but other schools would also pay
for fixed costs.
Mills College students now attend
overseas campuses, but Mills does not
pay for costs in excess of tuition.
The cost per student overseas next
year will exceed tuition here by 16
percent.
Combine Programs
Mancall said he has already talked
to several schools about such an
arrangement for many of the programs
including those at Berlin, Vienna and
Florence.
He also said that combining two
programs in the same language area
might be an alternative to eliminating
them.
However, he said curtailment of
some programs is an option he and the
C-FSP must consider.
Emphasizing that there are no plans
now to end any program except the
one in Peru, Mancall said any decision
to close down a location would
depend on several variables including
economic conditions and student
interest.
Specialized Programs
He said recent changes in several
programs need evaluation before
policy decisions are made.
Mancall noted the start of programs
at the large campuses where students
devote themselves to a concentrated
area of study. The health services
program at Cliveden this summer is the
first of five already planned.
He said his office would continue
to make small cuts wherever it
could, but added, "You can only take
that so far."
The Overseas Studies Office made a
15 to 20 percent cut in expenditures
just to maintain the budget at its
present level, according to Don Price,
associate director. Unfavorable
exchange and inflation rates offset the
effect of the cuts, he said.
Price admitted that the budget still
fell $141,749 short of the reductions
the provost's office had requested for
the 1975-76 academic year.
"We've done the best we can,"
Price said. "It's up to the provost after
that."
