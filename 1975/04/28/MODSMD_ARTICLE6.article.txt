# Rose Bowl Grid Star Pleads Guilty
## 
### RON ELVING 
Former Stanford football star
Roger Cowan, defensive lineman on
the 1971 and 1972 Rose Bowl teams,
entered a guilty plea in the federal
district court of Los Angeles April 18,
after being charged with aiding and
abetting the concealment of an illegal
alien.
Pleading guilty to the concealment
of one illegal alien was Cowan's father,
Bernard, a defeated candidate in last
month's primary election for the Los
Angeles City Council.
The two men made an unscheduled
appearance before U.S. District Judge
Manuel Real to change their earlier
pleas of innocent.
Both face fines of up to $2000 and
maximum prison sentences of five
years. Sentencing has been scheduled
for May 5.
The Cowans were indicted
following a March 27 incident at the
Bernie Bowan Belt Manufacturing
