# Rose Bowl Grid Star Pleads Guilty
## 
### RON ELVING 
Former Stanford football star
Roger Cowan, defensive lineman on
the 1971 and 1972 Rose Bowl teams,
entered a guilty plea in the federal
district court of Los Angeles April 18,
after being charged with aiding and
abetting the concealment of an illegal
alien.
Pleading guilty to the concealment
of one illegal alien was Cowan's father,
Bernard, a defeated candidate in last
month's primary election for the Los
Angeles City Council.
The two men made an unscheduled
appearance before U.S. District Judge
Manuel Real to change their earlier
pleas of innocent.
Both face fines of up to $2000 and
maximum prison sentences of five
years. Sentencing has been scheduled
for May 5.
The Cowans were indicted
following a March 27 incident at the
Bernie Bowan Belt Manufacturing
Company factory in Pomona. The
senior Cowan, acting on a lawyer's
advice, told U.S. immigration officials
they could not search his plant with a
warrant.
Unwise Decision
When the officers left to obtain a
warrant, Bernard Cowan told his son
to drive 24 employees away in a van.
"It wasn't a wise decision," the senior
Cowan told the judge, "but we did
so."
The International Ladies Garment
Workers Union had been striking
against the factory at the time.
According to a Los Angeles Times
report, union officials acknowledged
that one of their organizers informed
police of the attempted concealment.
Union officials termed the disputed
workers "strike breakers," though the
Cowans nave maintained that many of
them were longtime employees of the
firm.
Contacted in Los Angeles, Roger
Cowan, a 1973 political science
graduate, said that neither he nor his
father could discuss the case until
sentence had been passed. He deferred
comment to his attorney, Roger
Cossack, who was unavailable for
comment.

In an earlier statement to the press,
Cossack said he believed the case to be
the first instance of an employer being
prosecuted for concealing aliens. He
denied the Cowans had brought the
aliens into the country and said the
workers were being paid "at least
union scale."
Asst. U.S. Attorney Norman
James, case prosecutor, told the Daily
that "[the Cowans]could not have
been prosecuted had they allowed
|immigration]officers to survey the
employees ... the law exempts
employers if aliens are found in
the course of work."
James said he "wasn't sure"
whether he would make any
recommendations in terms of
sentencing, noting that "Judge Real
doesn't often ask for
recommendations from prosecutors."
'Thunder Chicken'
At Stanford, Cowan was one of
four defensive linemen who called
themselves the "Thunder Chickens"
and received considerable national
publicity for both their play and their
nickname.
Transferring to Stanford in his
sophomore year. Cowan was a key
factor on the 1970-72 varsity squads,
although his career was marred by foot

injuries which kept him out of several
crucial games and on the bench
through much of his senior year.
Steve Jubb, former All American
offensive tackle on the 1971 Rose
Bowl team and now a Drofessiona!
musician, reacted to the news of
Cowan's arrest with surprise, terming
it "bizarre" to think of Cowan facing a
prison sentence.
"I roomed with Roger when he first
came to Stanford," Jubb said. "He
wasn't naive but he had a wide-eyed
approach to Stanford, and he went
through some changes while he was
here. He was always just a really nice
guy."
'Caught In The Squeeze'
As to Cowan's present legal
difficulties, Jubb concluded: "It
sounds like Rog just got caught in the
old squeeze."
Head Football Coach Jack
Christiansen said, "In all my dealings
with him ] Cowan JI never knew him
to be out of line. He liked to go out
and have a good time, but as far as I
was concerned he was never a
problem."
Christiansen said he hopes the best
for Cowan in his present situation and
expressed his sympathy with the
former athlete's position. "Sometimes
these things just happen," he said.

for May 5.
The Cowans were indicted
following a March 27 incident at the
Bernie Bowan Belt Manufacturing
Company factory in Pomona. The
senior Cowan, acting on a lawyer's
advice, told U.S. immigration officials
they could not search his plant with a
warrant.
Unwise Decision
When the officers left to obtain a
warrant, Bernard Cowan told his son
to drive 24 employees away in a van.
"It wasn't a wise decision," the senior
Cowan told the judge, "but we did
so."
The International Ladies Garment
Workers Union had been striking
against the factory at the time.
According to a Los Angeles Times
report, union officials acknowledged
that one of their organizers informed
police of the attempted concealment.
Union officials termed the disputed
workers "strike breakers," though the
Cowans nave maintained that many of
them were longtime employees of the
firm.
Contacted in Los Angeles, Roger
Cowan, a 1973 political science
graduate, said that neither he nor his
father could discuss the case until
sentence had been passed. He deferred
comment to his attorney, Roger
Cossack, who was unavailable for
comment.

In an earlier statement to the press,
Cossack said he believed the case to be
the first instance of an employer being
prosecuted for concealing aliens. He
denied the Cowans had brought the
aliens into the country and said the
workers were being paid "at least
union scale."
Asst. U.S. Attorney Norman
James, case prosecutor, told the Daily
that "[the Cowans]could not have
been prosecuted had they allowed
|immigration]officers to survey the
employees ... the law exempts
employers if aliens are found in
the course of work."
James said he "wasn't sure"
whether he would make any
recommendations in terms of
sentencing, noting that "Judge Real
doesn't often ask for
recommendations from prosecutors."
'Thunder Chicken'
At Stanford, Cowan was one of
four defensive linemen who called
themselves the "Thunder Chickens"
and received considerable national
publicity for both their play and their
nickname.
Transferring to Stanford in his
sophomore year. Cowan was a key
factor on the 1970-72 varsity squads,
although his career was marred by foot

injuries which kept him out of several
crucial games and on the bench
through much of his senior year.
Steve Jubb, former All American
offensive tackle on the 1971 Rose
Bowl team and now a Drofessiona!
musician, reacted to the news of
Cowan's arrest with surprise, terming
it "bizarre" to think of Cowan facing a
prison sentence.
"I roomed with Roger when he first
came to Stanford," Jubb said. "He
wasn't naive but he had a wide-eyed
approach to Stanford, and he went
through some changes while he was
here. He was always just a really nice
guy."
'Caught In The Squeeze'
As to Cowan's present legal
difficulties, Jubb concluded: "It
sounds like Rog just got caught in the
old squeeze."
Head Football Coach Jack
Christiansen said, "In all my dealings
with him ] Cowan JI never knew him
to be out of line. He liked to go out
and have a good time, but as far as I
was concerned he was never a
problem."
Christiansen said he hopes the best
for Cowan in his present situation and
expressed his sympathy with the
former athlete's position. "Sometimes
these things just happen," he said.
