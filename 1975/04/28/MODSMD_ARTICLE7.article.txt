## Opinions editorials Peace Is Welcome 
### 
One week ago today, Nguyen Van Thieu resigned his post
as South Vietnamese president. We are glad to see Thieu step
down, as his resignation was obviously a prerequisite to any
peace negotiations.
We hope that the new government of South Vietnam tries
to rapidly negotiate a settlement with insurgent forces.
Perhaps such a settlement would be little more than an
orderly transfer of power to the Viet Cong, but that is far
superior to a bloodbath in the streets of Saigon.
Last Thursday, the Alliance for Radical Change (ARC)
held a rally in White Plaza celebrating the victory of the
"forces of liberation" in Indochina. We think that its
celebration was misguided. We believe that the only thing
worth celebrating would be a peaceful resolution to the
fighting and not a victory by one side or the other.
We do not know whether the new governments will be
any better, or worse, than were the old. We only know that
for the vast majority of people in this region, peace under
any rulers is better than continued bloodshed.
