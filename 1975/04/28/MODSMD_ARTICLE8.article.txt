# Free Catalogs

### 
The University recently instituted a new policy regarding
the distribution of its catalog, Courses and Degrees.
According to the new policy, only first-year students w'll
receive free copies of the catalog. All other persons will
have to pay $2 for their copies.
While we believe that it is a legitimate budget-cutting
move to charge non-students (including high school
counseling offices) for Courses and Degrees, we think that
all students and faculty should be entitled to a free copy of
the book every year.
For $3810 in tuition, it would seem that the University
could at least provide students with up-to-date information
on what courses the University offers. As it is, information
in Courses and Degrees is often outdated by the time
students consult it. Giving students only one copy of the
catalog for four years would only intensify this
information gap.
We would also like to propose, in the interest of
budget-cutting, that students be limited to one free copy of
Courses and Degrees per year. This could be enforced by
means of checking a box on the student identification card
as each student received his or her free catalog.
