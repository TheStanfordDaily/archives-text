# USE And Hospital Distort Issues
## 
### William Ross 
In the conflict between United Stanford
Employees (USE) and the Stanford Hospital
administration, it is difficult to determine
which side has wallowed in the shabbier
tactics.
USE might qualify for the dubious
distinction by its insistence upon claiming
that a small majority of voters would have
opted for the union in this month's
representational elections if the hospital had
not unfairly persuaded workers to oppose
unionization.
USE's contention — which it is presenting
to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) in an unfair labor practices charge —
is deflated by the election's outcome. Despite
USE's call for a boycott, approximately 85
percent of hospital workers voted in the
election, and more than 80 percent of the
voters chose to remain unrepresented by any
anion.
Since USE strenuously countered hospital
charges prior to the election, it seems
virtually impossible that the hospital was able
to coerce or deceive hundreds of workers
into opposing unionization.
Most workers who have articulated their
reasons for voting against USE and the other
unions seem to be well informed about the
most fundamental election issues.
They tended to oppose unionization
because they believed that they could bargain
with hospital administrators for better wages
and working conditions without the
complications that a union would bring.

Several hospital employees have told the
Daily that they fear a strike would follow
unionization, causing them to lose wages
during its duration. Furthermore, many of
them have objected to compulsory payment
of union dues and have expressed satisfaction
with current wage scales and working
conditions.

USE's insistence that workers were
intimidated and misinformed by hospital
administrators is insulting to the intelligence
of hospital employees. They were able to make
up their own minds on the question of
unionization and chose to reject it.
But the intelligence of workers was
equally insulted by the propaganda
techniques of the hospital, which USE President
Jim Berk aptly termed "heavy handed."
Even though USE greatly exaggerates the
effect of the propaganda, there is no doubt
that much of it was unfair — in the moral
sense — to USE. Whether or not it was legally
unfair is, of course, up the NLRB to decide.

The hospital's most distorted charge
involved the so-called "34-cent firing."
Hospital administrators claimed that the USE
tried to fire a worker because he had failed to
pay 34 cents of his union dues for January.
But in reality, Berk seems merely to have
notified University officials of the failure to
pay, in accordance with legal procedure.
There is no evidence that Berk tried to have
the employee fired.
The hospital also seems to have been a bit
too eager to warn its employees of the
violence and bitterness that unionization
could engender. Such warnings, repeated
again and again in the hospital's letters to its
employees served no useful purpose and
smeared the USE, which has hardly had a
reputation for violence.
Likewise, the hospital's claim that
unionization would cause the quality of
patient care to deteriorate seems unfounded.
As Berk noted recently, patient care for
the hospital is a business, while for the union,
it is a livelihood. There is no logical reason
that care standards will decline under
unionization.
Fortunately, most employees seem to
have been able to see through the ploys of
both the union and the hospital and voted on
the real issues of unionization rather than the
charges and counter-charges of USE and the
hospital.

USE might qualify for the dubious
distinction by its insistence upon claiming
that a small majority of voters would have
opted for the union in this month's
representational elections if the hospital had
not unfairly persuaded workers to oppose
unionization.
USE's contention — which it is presenting
to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) in an unfair labor practices charge —
is deflated by the election's outcome. Despite
USE's call for a boycott, approximately 85
percent of hospital workers voted in the
election, and more than 80 percent of the
voters chose to remain unrepresented by any
anion.
Since USE strenuously countered hospital
charges prior to the election, it seems
virtually impossible that the hospital was able
to coerce or deceive hundreds of workers
into opposing unionization.
Most workers who have articulated their
reasons for voting against USE and the other
unions seem to be well informed about the
most fundamental election issues.
They tended to oppose unionization
because they believed that they could bargain
with hospital administrators for better wages
and working conditions without the
complications that a union would bring.

Several hospital employees have told the
Daily that they fear a strike would follow
unionization, causing them to lose wages
during its duration. Furthermore, many of
them have objected to compulsory payment
of union dues and have expressed satisfaction
with current wage scales and working
conditions.

USE's insistence that workers were
intimidated and misinformed by hospital
administrators is insulting to the intelligence
of hospital employees. They were able to make
up their own minds on the question of
unionization and chose to reject it.
But the intelligence of workers was
equally insulted by the propaganda
techniques of the hospital, which USE President
Jim Berk aptly termed "heavy handed."
Even though USE greatly exaggerates the
effect of the propaganda, there is no doubt
that much of it was unfair — in the moral
sense — to USE. Whether or not it was legally
unfair is, of course, up the NLRB to decide.

The hospital's most distorted charge
involved the so-called "34-cent firing."
Hospital administrators claimed that the USE
tried to fire a worker because he had failed to
pay 34 cents of his union dues for January.
But in reality, Berk seems merely to have
notified University officials of the failure to
pay, in accordance with legal procedure.
There is no evidence that Berk tried to have
the employee fired.
The hospital also seems to have been a bit
too eager to warn its employees of the
violence and bitterness that unionization
could engender. Such warnings, repeated
again and again in the hospital's letters to its
employees served no useful purpose and
smeared the USE, which has hardly had a
reputation for violence.
Likewise, the hospital's claim that
unionization would cause the quality of
patient care to deteriorate seems unfounded.
As Berk noted recently, patient care for
the hospital is a business, while for the union,
it is a livelihood. There is no logical reason
that care standards will decline under
unionization.
Fortunately, most employees seem to
have been able to see through the ploys of
both the union and the hospital and voted on
the real issues of unionization rather than the
charges and counter-charges of USE and the
hospital.
