Educational Research Seed Grants for Youny Faculty
The Spencer Foundation has provided Stanford University with funds to support research of
young scholars working on problems related to education. The grant is premised on the assump
tions that small start-up funds for research by young faculty are hard to come by, that better
decisions can be made locally on where the best returns fjr such investments are likely, and that
encouraging young scholars across many disciplines to address educational problems is a good
way to increase knowledge about learning processes and other matters of importance to policy
and practice in education.
Grants for 1975-76 can be made in amounts up to approximately $5,000 for approximately a one
year period. Salary support for the principal investigator should not be requested, although
stipends for a necessary graduate student Research Assistant may be indluded. Preference will
be given to investigators who are assistant or associate professors and to competent proposals
that bring the social, behavioral or natural sciences to bear on educational problems and that
have a high likelihood of developing into moreextensive programs funded by other sources.
Those interested in applying for 1975-76 support should file proposals before June 1, 1975 to
Arthur Coladarci, Dean of the School of Education. The proposal may be brief but should indicate
the problem to be addressed, its significance, general methodology, and proposed budget. It
should be accompanied by a one-page vita, indicating the investigator's training and relevant
publications. Six (6) copies are required.
Dean Coladarci will be happy to answer any questions (7-2111).
