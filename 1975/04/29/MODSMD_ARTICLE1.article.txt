# Report Suggests Cut In Tenure Appointments
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
If the University's appointment and
promotion policy of the 1960s is
continued, 78 percent of the faculty
will be tenured by 1985, with 50
percent age 45 or older, says a report
by two researchers in the provost's
office.
New appointments would need to
drop to 30 per year, the study says, if
the University is to maintain the
faculty constant in number. The new
appointment rate would drop to 11.3
per year over the next three years, the
report reveals.
Financed by the Exxon foundation,
the report is authored by Staff
Associate David Hopkins of the
Academic Planning Office and Vice
Provost Arthur Bienenstock. In it,
they conclude that fewer
appointments and promotions of
faculty are necessary in the face of
budget cutbacks, but that at the same
time such a policy conflicts with the
need to attract the best possible junior
faculty.
Cutbacks Suggested
The study, which suggests large
cutbacks in the percentage of junior
faculty receiving tenure, is to be
reviewed shortly by the Task Force on
Professorial Rank and Faculty
Development.
Hopkins and Bienenstock also claim
in their report that recruitment of
younger faculty members is necessary
to "maintain the institution's
capability to respond to further
enrollment patterns and disciplinary
changes," and to "maintain a high
quality faculty" suitable to a "highly
select" student body.
The study suggests several solutions
to this conflict. Early retirement and
part-time appointments are listed as
ways to open up more opportunities
for junior faculty without increasing
faculty size. The most effective way,
Hopkins and Bienenstock say, is to
put stricter limits on the number of
junior faculty receiving tenure.
The authors oppose "numerical
tenure quotas" as a means to achieve
the lower tenure rate. They write, "We
believe the fixed tenure quota to be
too simplistic an analysis of individual
departments." They add that the
University cannot "attract the very
best junior scholars if the possibility of

achieving tenure is withdrawn."
Appointments May Drop
During the 19605, the School of
Humanities and Sciences averaged 37.4
new faculty appointments per year,
according to the study. One-third of
these were tenured appointments. An
average of 39 percent of the junior
faculty were promoted to tenured
positions. The school's faculty size
grew from 257 to 422.
If the University's annual atrition
rate during the 1960s of 2.4 percent
from death, resignation and retirement
drops to one percent, the average
number of appointments could drop

to 24.3 per year if the University seeks
to maintain a constant faculty size.
Hopkins and Bienenstock contend
that if fewer new appointments at the
tenured level are made, and if 20
percent instead of 40 percent of junior
faculty members receive tenure, then
the new appointment rate can be
changed to 17.3 per year. This would
allow the University to increase the
"flow" of junior faculty and keep
bringing in new blood, they say.
The report recommends against
tenure quotas because such limits
"would automatically prevent a
department from promoting a truly
outstanding young scholar to tenure."
'Fine Tuning' Needed
"Instead, it seems more appropriate
to 'fine tune' the system so that the
tenure appointment and promotion
rate approaches 20 percent," says the
report. Tenure decisions should be
made on a departmental and individual
basis.
The study points out several
methods already being used to open
up more opportunities for tenured
appointments. One plan includes
providing sizable severance allowances
to faculty who want to move on,
either to retire early or go elsewhere to
teach. Another method is to make
part-time employment more attractive.
Several faculty members are working
part-time at present, according to the
report.
Yet another route, the report notes,
is to provide better opportunities for
faculty to take sabbatical leaves in
order to change their field of
concentration, and thereby adapt their
studies to more current problems.
