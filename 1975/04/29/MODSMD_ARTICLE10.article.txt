# History Of The New System
## 
### 
Early last October, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs, Larry Horton,
contacted the Committee on Services
to Students (COSS) asking for its
participation in a thorough review of
the entire University housing system.
The proposed review was sparked
by a request from Alphi Sigma Phi one
year ago, in which the coed fraternity
asked to be exempt from the housing
draw, an option it had held
previously as an all-male organization.
Its request had been denied since
the draw exemption favor would then
have to be extended to all coed

fraternities and possibly other small
living groups.
The issue was not closed, however,
as it had brought to light one of the
severest inequities present in the
housing system at that time: the
exemption option was granted only to
all-male fraternity members, making
the system discriminatory on the basis
of sex.
Subcommittee Formed
In answer to Morton's request for a
study of the housing issue, COSS
formed a subcommittee on residences,
composed of one University staff

member, six students and three
ex-officio members, Horton, Ed
Scoles, director of Housing and Food
Services, and the student chairwoman
of COSS.
The student component of the
group included one fraternity member,
three dormitory residents, one Row
house resident and two off-campus
students.
We jokingly titled it "Housing I," as
a new overview class offered by the
Department of Residential Education.
Our reserve reading, located in the
Housing Office, included the history
of the system, public documents
pertaining to the issue and numerous
housing proposals.
Housing I was a lesson not only in
how the housing system operates, but
in how the committee process can
work. We moved with painful slowness
at first and gradually gained
momentum as terms were defined,
principles were established, and goals
were founded.
Cost-Benefit Analysis
Bill Rifkin, a senior economics
major, served as director of the
proceedings, charting each proposal
through a cost-benefit analysis judging
which students would lose or gain
from particular system amendments.
We agreed that we had three
options in dealing with the draw
exemption — we could extend it,
remove it or retain it.
If we retained it as it was, we would
have solved nothing. If we extended it,
we would have to decide to whom.
Suppose it was granted to 508
women, offsetting exactly the number
of men living in the draw-exempt
fraternities.

Cecile Herold

That step would result in a higher
eviction rate of the men and women
left to contend in the draw.
We decided we wanted to
recommend a proposal fair to all
students, not just equal numbers of
men and women students.
Near the start of the subcommittee
meetings, COSS chairwoman Suzi
Harmatz asked, "What if we have each
student live off campus for three
quarters?"
Housing Responsibility
Shortly thereafter, alumnus Pitch
Johnson submitted a proposal which
assigned a housing responsibility
number to each male fraternity. In
that way, fraternities shared equally in
the housing burden without having to
participate in a campus draw.
The subcommittee's eventual
recommendation, the Guaranteed
Housing Plan, is based on an
amalgamation of these two
suggestions. The Housing Office was
then faced with the mammoth task of
implementing the plan.
Throughout our housing review, the
subcommittee continually sought the
input of students through direct and
indirect channels.
As a student member of the
subcommittee, I can say that my
opinions were listened to and
thoughtfully considered by the
administration.
As long as the University faces a
housing shortage, the housing issue is
not a closed one. The subcommittee is
now an established branch of COSS
and will continue its work throughout
and probably beyond the
implementation period of the
Guaranteed Housing Plan.

Subcommittee Formed
In answer to Morton's request for a
study of the housing issue, COSS
formed a subcommittee on residences,
composed of one University staff

member, six students and three
ex-officio members, Horton, Ed
Scoles, director of Housing and Food
Services, and the student chairwoman
of COSS.
The student component of the
group included one fraternity member,
three dormitory residents, one Row
house resident and two off-campus
students.
We jokingly titled it "Housing I," as
a new overview class offered by the
Department of Residential Education.
Our reserve reading, located in the
Housing Office, included the history
of the system, public documents
pertaining to the issue and numerous
housing proposals.
Housing I was a lesson not only in
how the housing system operates, but
in how the committee process can
work. We moved with painful slowness
at first and gradually gained
momentum as terms were defined,
principles were established, and goals
were founded.
Cost-Benefit Analysis
Bill Rifkin, a senior economics
major, served as director of the
proceedings, charting each proposal
through a cost-benefit analysis judging
which students would lose or gain
from particular system amendments.
We agreed that we had three
options in dealing with the draw
exemption — we could extend it,
remove it or retain it.
If we retained it as it was, we would
have solved nothing. If we extended it,
we would have to decide to whom.
Suppose it was granted to 508
women, offsetting exactly the number
of men living in the draw-exempt
fraternities.

Cecile Herold

That step would result in a higher
eviction rate of the men and women
left to contend in the draw.
We decided we wanted to
recommend a proposal fair to all
students, not just equal numbers of
men and women students.
Near the start of the subcommittee
meetings, COSS chairwoman Suzi
Harmatz asked, "What if we have each
student live off campus for three
quarters?"
Housing Responsibility
Shortly thereafter, alumnus Pitch
Johnson submitted a proposal which
assigned a housing responsibility
number to each male fraternity. In
that way, fraternities shared equally in
the housing burden without having to
participate in a campus draw.
The subcommittee's eventual
recommendation, the Guaranteed
Housing Plan, is based on an
amalgamation of these two
suggestions. The Housing Office was
then faced with the mammoth task of
implementing the plan.
Throughout our housing review, the
subcommittee continually sought the
input of students through direct and
indirect channels.
As a student member of the
subcommittee, I can say that my
opinions were listened to and
thoughtfully considered by the
administration.
As long as the University faces a
housing shortage, the housing issue is
not a closed one. The subcommittee is
now an established branch of COSS
and will continue its work throughout
and probably beyond the
implementation period of the
Guaranteed Housing Plan.

Early last October, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs, Larry Horton,
contacted the Committee on Services
to Students (COSS) asking for its
participation in a thorough review of
the entire University housing system.
The proposed review was sparked
by a request from Alphi Sigma Phi one
year ago, in which the coed fraternity
asked to be exempt from the housing
draw, an option it had held
previously as an all-male organization.
Its request had been denied since
the draw exemption favor would then
have to be extended to all coed

fraternities and possibly other small
living groups.
The issue was not closed, however,
as it had brought to light one of the
severest inequities present in the
housing system at that time: the
exemption option was granted only to
all-male fraternity members, making
the system discriminatory on the basis
of sex.
