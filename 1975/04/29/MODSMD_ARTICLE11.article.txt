## Assistant Provost' Gives Away Space' Metcalfe: Stanford's Robin Hood 
### 
By AARON WEINER
Biking frantically around
campus, long blond hair flipping
in the breeze, she could be any
woman heading for class. But
Amy Metcalfe, 31, is hardly a
student.
As assistant provost in charge
of academic facilities, she is
probably rushing to a meeting of a
University planning committee.
In her job, Metcalfe works very
closely with the provost's office,
allocating and renovating building
space.
"People view space very much
like they view their own salary,"
she says.
"I'm a Robin Hood of sorts in
this field, giving space and
renovation funds to those who
need it most," she added.
Social Skills
Metcalfe says she emphasizes
her social rather than technical
skills at work. "The most
important part of the job is the

people that I meet and what I
learn from those interactions. So
far I have learned a tremendous
amount."
But even though Metcalfe likes
her job, she has complaints. "One
of my big gripes is that women
and men are compared against
each other," she says.

'People view spaee
very mueh like ihey
view their own salary."

"At first I felt a tremendous
need to over-prove myself. By
doing extra staff work and
background work, I guarantee
that no one will conclude a
negative thing because I'm a
woman."
Female Advantage
Metcalfe says there is at least
one advantage to being a woman

in her current job. "I haven't been
brought up with the
responsibilities of being a
provider, and so 1 have been
willing to take risks."
Judging from the response, she
has produced to everyone's
satisfaction.
"She's more than proven that
my judgment |to hire her] was a
good judgment," says Ed Shaw,
executive assistant to the vice
president and provost.
"She is one who will be
creative, inventive and take
initiative in her work. In addition
to having a professional respect
for her, I have a personal respect."
Buckley Amendment
Currently, Metcalfe is assisting
James Siena, legal advisor to
President Lyman, in a review of
the controversial "Buckley
Amendment."
"I got involved in the 'Buckley
Amendment' because I'm
fascinated with the law, but don't

know anything about it," she
says, her face gleaming with an
excited smile.
She also is involved with
affirmative action and the
Committee for the Education and
Employment of Women (CEEW).
Both groups act as watchdogs over
hiring practices at Stanford, and
the latter also serves as a general
sounding board for women on
campus.
For affirmative action,
Metcalfe monitors the presidential
and provostial staff force,
numbering around 3500. She was
the chairperson of CEEW last
year, a "very exciting" enterprise,
she says.
But, she complains, "It's
frustrating seeing so few women
and minorities with jobs of
responsibility here."
Makes Time
While pursuing her numerous
duties enthusiastically, Metcalfe
still manages to make time for
people.
She nearly always puts down
what she is doing to accommodate
a visitor in her office, whether it
be President Lyman or a female
student needing career advice.
"I don't want people to take
this [being friendly and
hospitable] as my being frivilous
or anything less than serious
about my work," she adds.
And the atmosphere one enters
is as accommodating as she is.
Rows of philodendrons, creeping
Charlies, ivys and asparagus ferns
hang in macrameed holders from
the ceiling in her office.
Four full little candy jars rest
on top of a large round coffee
table and a beanbag chair rounds
out one corner of the room.
The entire office is subtly lit
with desk lamps. "I get migraine
headaches from fluorescent
lights," Metcalfe confides.
P.E. Teacher
Metcalfe began her professional
career 10 years ago as a physical
education teacher at a junior high
school in Columbus, Ohio.
She says she found that she
spent as much time counseling
students as she did teaching P.E.
Her interest expanded, she says,
and so, while teaching P.E. at the
junior high in the day, she earned
a master's degree in counseling
psychology through night school
at nearby Ohio State.
Venturing to Cambridge in the
summer of 1967, she became a
student placement counselor at
MIT. There she met her husband,

Bob.
"I like to tell people that he
came with a problem, and 1 solved
his problem," she jokes. They
were married in May 1968.
Big Hurdle
In 1972, because Bob was
offered a job as a research
scientist for Xerox in Palo Alto,
they moved. Metcalfe was hired
by the provost's office in August,
1972.
Becoming assistant provost
was a meaningful hurdle, she says.
Throughout her career at MIT she

was an "assistant to the . . ." to
dean, to the director of personnel
and to the vice president for
research. Here she started out as
assistant to the provost.
"I was very sensitive to being
somebody's assistant as opposed
to being a person with substantial
responsibility," she explains. And
last fall, she was promoted to
assistant provost, and eagerly
assumed the greater range of
duties.
Because Metcalfe has no

children, she says she can divert
most of her resources to her work.
At home Metcalfe pursues her
gardening, macrame, flute and
photography interests. With her
husband, she also snow skis, and
plays squash and tennis
religiously.
Metcalfe says she is thankful
for what she has, and adds, "It's
very important that people take
me seriously and as a professional.
The key, I think, of the women's
issue, is that it is important as a
woman to be taken seriously."
