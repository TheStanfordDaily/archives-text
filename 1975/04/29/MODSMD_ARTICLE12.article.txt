Is there any place on campus to rent a good electric
typewriter and what are the rates? —M.D.C.
Yes, there is a place on campus to rent
typewriters. The bookstore rents them at the
following rates:
— a standard portable (non-electric) costs $7 a
month or $4 a week;
— a portable electric (with manual return) costs
$12 a month or $7 a week, and
— an IBM Selectric (with correctable tape) costs
$25 a month or $14 a week.

I wonder whether there is any special reason why
the roads on campus arc continually littered with
gravel. Both building site crews and road repairmen
leave huge amounts of rocks and pebbles which
only disappear when they become embedded in the
tires and paint of cars. Why can't they be like
normal people and clcan up their mess? —J.M.
Director of Plant Services Jason Mavis said that
the University does sweep most of the campus
streets once a week. However, he said, they do not
have the manpower to follow trucks to pick up
anything they might drop, especially with the large
amount of construction going on at the moment.
He noted that the University is in the process of
getting a new street sweeper.

Why does the University charge a fee for duplicates
of those cheap student ID cards? —T.F.
The Registrar's Office said that the $2
fee to replace ID cards is for the time and cost of

the material. Supposedly the office must make sure
that the person who lost the card is really who he
says he is, and then has to do a lot of checking and
cross-checking.
Frankly, we're skeptical. One Daily staffer lost
his card and had it replaced in less than five
minutes. At that rate, a secretary in the office is
getting paid $24 an hour for replacing ID's.

What is the Boys Town Center? —J.J.B.
The Boys Town Center was established at
Stanford by the trustees of Father Flanagan's Boys
Town in Omaha, Nebraska. Its purpose is to do
basic research on neglect of children, hopefully
preventing the problems which the original Boys
Town deals with.
So far the Stanford Boys Town Center has
concentrated on studying children classified as "at
risk." These include premature infants, children
whose parents are alcoholics or in jail, and shy
children. The center has also studied the effects of
being a minority child in a majority school. Finally,
there have been studies of "social intervention"
methods, including day care centers and residential
juvenile programs, like Boys Town.
The Boys Town Center at Stanford will be
around for a long time. There is a 25-year contract,
and approximately $450,000 a year for salaries and
research expenses. In addition, $1,500,000 will be
spent to construct permanent research space on the
Quad.

— an IBM Selectric (with correctable tape) costs
$25 a month or $14 a week.

I wonder whether there is any special reason why
the roads on campus arc continually littered with
gravel. Both building site crews and road repairmen
leave huge amounts of rocks and pebbles which
only disappear when they become embedded in the
tires and paint of cars. Why can't they be like
normal people and clcan up their mess? —J.M.
Director of Plant Services Jason Mavis said that
the University does sweep most of the campus
streets once a week. However, he said, they do not
have the manpower to follow trucks to pick up
anything they might drop, especially with the large
amount of construction going on at the moment.
He noted that the University is in the process of
getting a new street sweeper.

Why does the University charge a fee for duplicates
of those cheap student ID cards? —T.F.
The Registrar's Office said that the $2
fee to replace ID cards is for the time and cost of

the material. Supposedly the office must make sure
that the person who lost the card is really who he
says he is, and then has to do a lot of checking and
cross-checking.
Frankly, we're skeptical. One Daily staffer lost
his card and had it replaced in less than five
minutes. At that rate, a secretary in the office is
getting paid $24 an hour for replacing ID's.

What is the Boys Town Center? —J.J.B.
The Boys Town Center was established at
Stanford by the trustees of Father Flanagan's Boys
Town in Omaha, Nebraska. Its purpose is to do
basic research on neglect of children, hopefully
preventing the problems which the original Boys
Town deals with.
So far the Stanford Boys Town Center has
concentrated on studying children classified as "at
risk." These include premature infants, children
whose parents are alcoholics or in jail, and shy
children. The center has also studied the effects of
being a minority child in a majority school. Finally,
there have been studies of "social intervention"
methods, including day care centers and residential
juvenile programs, like Boys Town.
The Boys Town Center at Stanford will be
around for a long time. There is a 25-year contract,
and approximately $450,000 a year for salaries and
research expenses. In addition, $1,500,000 will be
spent to construct permanent research space on the
Quad.


Is there any place on campus to rent a good electric
typewriter and what are the rates? —M.D.C.
Yes, there is a place on campus to rent
typewriters. The bookstore rents them at the
following rates:
— a standard portable (non-electric) costs $7 a
month or $4 a week;
— a portable electric (with manual return) costs
$12 a month or $7 a week, and
— an IBM Selectric (with correctable tape) costs
$25 a month or $14 a week.
