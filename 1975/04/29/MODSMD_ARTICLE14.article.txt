# X-Ray Scanner May Help Doctors In Cancer Battles

### MARY INGERSOLL 
Cancer patients may look
forward in a few years to a new
machine capable of detecting very
small tumors, and hence, enabling
an earlier and more successful
cure by traditional surgical or
radiation methods, says Dr.
Douglas Boyd,research physicist at
the Hansen Labs.
Several years of research at the
Medical Center have culminated in
the development of a "computer
tomographic x-ray scanner," says
Boyd, one of the developers. The
computer "produces accurate
cross-sectional diagnostic images"
of tumors in the body, he says.
Dr. David Pistenma, acting
assistant professor of radiology,
says that the scanner "measures
alternations of x-ray beams from
different directions in a plane, and
reconstructs computer densities
representing the body sections."
This results in cross-sectional
images, projected in different
colors, that enable tumors to
show up against the surrounding
healthy tissue, and in relation to
other organs, he says.

The new scanner is a
technological improvement over
an existing brain scanner, which
only produces cross-sections of
the brain, says Boyd. The new
scanner uses the same principles,
but has advantages of showing the
whole body, and in a shorter
period of time.
Little Differences
Boyd says that one of the
problems of traditional tumor
detection is that the "little
differences between tumor and
normal tissue don't show up."
Tumors must be five to 10
centimeters before they can be
detected under traditional
methods, he says, adding that the
new scanner can detect tumors as
small as one to two millimeters.
Early detection is the first
important step in a cure for
cancer, says Boyd. "Early
detection means we catch it when
the tumor is small."
But the scanner is not only
useful in the detection of tumors,
says Pistenma. It also has
"widespread use in diagnostic
studies of other medical problems,
such as distinguishing cysts."
Radiation
Both Pistenma and Boyd
agreed that a patient is subjected
to some radiation from the new
scanner, but, they say, no more
than with a normal radiograph.
Boyd adds, however, that "the
amount of information |on the
patient] per unit dose |of
radiation | is increased," making
the detection process more
efficient.
Approximately 20 companies
have been working on the
development of similar scanners in
the past few years, according to
Boyd. Some of them are

commercially available, but have
extremely high distribution costs.
When government funding
comes through, "hopefully within
two years, it [the scanner] might
be marketed at $50,000 to
$75,000," says Boyd. The current
market price is near $350,000,
says Pistenma.
Tumor Killing
When the scanner finally
becomes popular, the remaining
problem will be how to kill the
tumor. Boyd says that the current
method of radiation is "limited as
it isn't selective in where it hits."
Healthy tissue surrounding the
tumor is often killed, he says.
Hand-in-hand with the scanner,
then, has come the development
of a "pion generator," which is
"still in the prototype stage," says
Boyd. The generator explodes and
kills cancerous cells by
bombarding them with subnuclear
particles called "pions."
"Pions go into the patient, do
little damage to surrounding tissue
on the way, then release their
energy at a stopping point,
depending on the density |of the
tissue |," says Boyd.
The density of the tissue can
be determined by the scanner,
says Boyd, making treatment
more accurate.
