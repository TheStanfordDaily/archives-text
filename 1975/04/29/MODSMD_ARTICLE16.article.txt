# Economists Examine Marxism, Capitalism
## 
### KEN McLAUGHLIN 
"The Marxist has a very
different and more sensible way
of understanding society" than
the capitalist, said economics
Ph.D. candidate Jens Christiansen
Thursday night in an economic
symposium. But the other
panelist, Economics Prof. George
Bach, didn't agree.
"Rather than arguing | that ]
we can choose as rational
individuals, the Marxist contends
economic and social forces move
by their own momentum," said
Christiansen.
Bach, on the other hand, said,
man has the free will to make an
individual choice. "The free
market provides a basis for the
individual to do what is good for
all of us by doing what is good for
himself. There is simply no better
way of getting work done."
Bach, however, said he would
not defend untrammelled
laissez-faire capitalism.
He said the position "that
government should do nothing is
stupid."
Four Purposes
Government, Bach said, should
have four purposes: make the
rules of the economic game, help
stabilize the economy, provide
public goods which the
marketplace will not provide and

redistribute income. The
"invisible hand" of the free
market. Bach argued, would take
care of the rest.
Christiansen scoffed at this
notion, saying, "The invisible
hand does not work. The
'harmony of interests' the
capitalist speaks of simply does
not exist."
Although Christiansen
conceded that many of Marx's
predictions have proved incorrect,
he said he feels Marx's basic
framework has remained intact.
Contradictions
The contradictions of
capitalism, said Christiansen, can
never resolve themselves. "There
will always be those who own the
means of production and there
will always be the powerless who
either have to work or starve."
He said he thought it was
improbable that a future capitalist
society in which each worker
owned shares in the company he
worked for could develop.
"Workers have always been
able to buy stock, but it's an
undisputable fact that a small
majority still reaps most of the
benefits," said Christiansen.
Bach asserted that capitalism
has actually freed the working
class from backbreaking labor.
