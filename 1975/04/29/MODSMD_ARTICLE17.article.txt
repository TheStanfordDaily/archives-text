## Cunningham Keeps Advancing 
### JANICE ROSS 
BERKELEY — One day last
summer Merce Cunningham was
talking with a group of young
dancers. "You know,"he
cautioned them, "one should
never lose sight of the fact that
you got into dance because you
love it, and you have to keep
finding what it is you love in it to
keep you alive. . . ."
At his two recent performances
in Berkeley Cunningham left no
doubt that he had indeed
discovered the secret of an eternal
joie de uivre in the dance.
Although he is well past the age at
which most dancers are forced to
retire, Cunningham continues to
exude the enthusiasm and puerile
energy of a man half his age.
Cunningham's dances too still
have that incredible capacity to
excite and incense. Twenty-five
years after he was first declared an
anathema by the established
dance world, Cunningham
continues to amaze and dazzle
audiences.
He has the true earmark of a
genius in that he manages to
outdistance his most talented
imitators, by choreographing in a
style that can only be classified as
avant-avant-garde.
One Of Few
A prolific creator, Cunningham
is one of a handful of
choreographers who refuses to
carry dances in his repertoire for
more than a few seasons. And he
has the fecund ingenuity to carry
it off.
Even Signals (1970), the oldest
Cunningham piece performed at
the Berkeley concerts, was worthy
of panegyrics by the strictness of
contemporary standards.
Signals employed several
aleatory elements, in the classic
Cunningham style; two of the
dance's four sections can be done
by one or two and five or six
dancers, the lighting varies from
one performance to the next, and
the music is spontaneously
composed by the resident
musicians, in this case, Tudor,
Cage and Behrman, depending on
the week and month of the
performance.
Signals like Changing
Slcps/Loops and Rebus, the other
two dances performed in one of
Cunningham's shows, was a fine
example of Cunningham
technique; gravity-defying
off-center balances, miraculously
stretched extensions that keep
climbing higher, and of course
intricate emendations of heads,
shoulders, backs, insteps and
elbows.
Peculiar to Cunningham's style
of movement is the fact that he
vitalizes not only the dancer's
entire body, but the space that
surrounds it as well. So that rather
than traversing or "moving

through" the stage space, the
Cunningham dancer manipulates
and palpates it.
Exquisite Treatment
This treatment of space in
conjunction with exquisite
lighting and delicately hued pastel
leotards and tights give the
Cunningham stage the look of an
impressionist landscape. The
atmosphere is vibrant and alive
with color and shadow.
Because the accompaniment
for his dances is so often
unpredictable, Cunningham has
circumvented the problem of not
having a reliable rhythmic beat by
providing his own. In the course
of a piece like Signals, he may
clap softly offstage, pause briefly
and nod, or exhale his breath in
short regular gasps to establish a
rhythm for a particular passage.
This functions to keep the
dancers together and
inadvertently reveals to the
audience the difficulty of what
they are doing.
Recent Piece
In Rebus ( 1975),
Cunningham's most recent piece,
the accompaniment is provided by
the incantations of a woman's
voice. This voice, together with
extraordinarily artful costumes
and an ominous rack of old
clothes in the background,
contributed to the haunting and
desultory quality of the dance.
Cunningham begins Rebus

garbed in baggy, dingy grey-brown
pants and shirt. He moves
meticulously, cautiously
measuring his steps against the
lively fluid phrases of his
company, who are garbed in
brilliant white body stockings
with soft rainbow shading on the
forearms of the women and the
ankles of the men.
Set off against his dancers
Cunningham is a strange somber
force. They are a virtuoistic,
dazzling yet anonymous unit,
representing the beauty and cold
precision of immaculately trained
dancers in their prime.
Although his more dauntless
physical powers art 1 waning,
Cunningham can still captivate an
audience with his incredible speed
and irresistible conviction in
movement.
In his Solo dance Sunday
evening Cunningham performed
the simplest of gestures; an
inquisitively cocked head, a
tentatively arched instep, and a
suggestively brushing leg, yet the
effect was spellbinding.
Undoubtedly he still has the
power to arouse and awe, and if
not by technical virtuosity then
by passion.
Proficient technicians in dance
are common, but creative genius
and profound insight are not.
Cunningham's Berkeley concerts
were joyous affirmation that
senescence for this eminent spirit
is still a long way off.

circumvented the problem of not
having a reliable rhythmic beat by
providing his own. In the course
of a piece like Signals, he may
clap softly offstage, pause briefly
and nod, or exhale his breath in
short regular gasps to establish a
rhythm for a particular passage.
This functions to keep the
dancers together and
inadvertently reveals to the
audience the difficulty of what
they are doing.
Recent Piece
In Rebus ( 1975),
Cunningham's most recent piece,
the accompaniment is provided by
the incantations of a woman's
voice. This voice, together with
extraordinarily artful costumes
and an ominous rack of old
clothes in the background,
contributed to the haunting and
desultory quality of the dance.
Cunningham begins Rebus

garbed in baggy, dingy grey-brown
pants and shirt. He moves
meticulously, cautiously
measuring his steps against the
lively fluid phrases of his
company, who are garbed in
brilliant white body stockings
with soft rainbow shading on the
forearms of the women and the
ankles of the men.
Set off against his dancers
Cunningham is a strange somber
force. They are a virtuoistic,
dazzling yet anonymous unit,
representing the beauty and cold
precision of immaculately trained
dancers in their prime.
Although his more dauntless
physical powers art 1 waning,
Cunningham can still captivate an
audience with his incredible speed
and irresistible conviction in
movement.
In his Solo dance Sunday
evening Cunningham performed
the simplest of gestures; an
inquisitively cocked head, a
tentatively arched instep, and a
suggestively brushing leg, yet the
effect was spellbinding.
Undoubtedly he still has the
power to arouse and awe, and if
not by technical virtuosity then
by passion.
Proficient technicians in dance
are common, but creative genius
and profound insight are not.
Cunningham's Berkeley concerts
were joyous affirmation that
senescence for this eminent spirit
is still a long way off.
BERKELEY — One day last
summer Merce Cunningham was
talking with a group of young
dancers. "You know,"he
cautioned them, "one should
never lose sight of the fact that
you got into dance because you
love it, and you have to keep
finding what it is you love in it to
keep you alive. . . ."
At his two recent performances
in Berkeley Cunningham left no
doubt that he had indeed
discovered the secret of an eternal
joie de uivre in the dance.
Although he is well past the age at
which most dancers are forced to
retire, Cunningham continues to
exude the enthusiasm and puerile
energy of a man half his age.
Cunningham's dances too still
have that incredible capacity to
excite and incense. Twenty-five
years after he was first declared an
anathema by the established
dance world, Cunningham
continues to amaze and dazzle
audiences.
He has the true earmark of a
genius in that he manages to
outdistance his most talented
imitators, by choreographing in a
style that can only be classified as
avant-avant-garde.
One Of Few
A prolific creator, Cunningham
is one of a handful of
choreographers who refuses to
carry dances in his repertoire for
more than a few seasons. And he
has the fecund ingenuity to carry
it off.
Even Signals (1970), the oldest
Cunningham piece performed at
the Berkeley concerts, was worthy
of panegyrics by the strictness of
contemporary standards.
Signals employed several
aleatory elements, in the classic
Cunningham style; two of the
dance's four sections can be done
by one or two and five or six
dancers, the lighting varies from
one performance to the next, and
the music is spontaneously
composed by the resident
musicians, in this case, Tudor,
Cage and Behrman, depending on
the week and month of the
performance.
Signals like Changing
Slcps/Loops and Rebus, the other
two dances performed in one of
Cunningham's shows, was a fine
example of Cunningham
technique; gravity-defying
off-center balances, miraculously
stretched extensions that keep
climbing higher, and of course
intricate emendations of heads,
shoulders, backs, insteps and
elbows.
Peculiar to Cunningham's style
of movement is the fact that he
vitalizes not only the dancer's
entire body, but the space that
surrounds it as well. So that rather
than traversing or "moving

through" the stage space, the
Cunningham dancer manipulates
and palpates it.
Exquisite Treatment
This treatment of space in
conjunction with exquisite
lighting and delicately hued pastel
leotards and tights give the
Cunningham stage the look of an
impressionist landscape. The
atmosphere is vibrant and alive
with color and shadow.

He has the true earmark of a
genius in that he manages to
outdistance his most talented
imitators, by choreographing in a
style that can only be classified as
avant-avant-garde.
One Of Few
A prolific creator, Cunningham
is one of a handful of
choreographers who refuses to
carry dances in his repertoire for
more than a few seasons. And he
has the fecund ingenuity to carry
it off.
Even Signals (1970), the oldest
Cunningham piece performed at
the Berkeley concerts, was worthy
of panegyrics by the strictness of
contemporary standards.
Signals employed several
aleatory elements, in the classic
Cunningham style; two of the
dance's four sections can be done
by one or two and five or six
dancers, the lighting varies from
one performance to the next, and
the music is spontaneously
composed by the resident
musicians, in this case, Tudor,
Cage and Behrman, depending on
the week and month of the
performance.
Signals like Changing
Slcps/Loops and Rebus, the other
two dances performed in one of
Cunningham's shows, was a fine
example of Cunningham
technique; gravity-defying
off-center balances, miraculously
stretched extensions that keep
climbing higher, and of course
intricate emendations of heads,
shoulders, backs, insteps and
elbows.
Peculiar to Cunningham's style
of movement is the fact that he
vitalizes not only the dancer's
entire body, but the space that
surrounds it as well. So that rather
than traversing or "moving

through" the stage space, the
Cunningham dancer manipulates
and palpates it.
Exquisite Treatment
This treatment of space in
conjunction with exquisite
lighting and delicately hued pastel
leotards and tights give the
Cunningham stage the look of an
impressionist landscape. The
atmosphere is vibrant and alive
with color and shadow.
Because the accompaniment
for his dances is so often
unpredictable, Cunningham has
circumvented the problem of not
having a reliable rhythmic beat by
providing his own. In the course
of a piece like Signals, he may
clap softly offstage, pause briefly
and nod, or exhale his breath in
short regular gasps to establish a
rhythm for a particular passage.
This functions to keep the
dancers together and
inadvertently reveals to the
audience the difficulty of what
they are doing.
Recent Piece
In Rebus ( 1975),
Cunningham's most recent piece,
the accompaniment is provided by
the incantations of a woman's
voice. This voice, together with
extraordinarily artful costumes
and an ominous rack of old
clothes in the background,
contributed to the haunting and
desultory quality of the dance.
Cunningham begins Rebus

garbed in baggy, dingy grey-brown
pants and shirt. He moves
meticulously, cautiously
measuring his steps against the
lively fluid phrases of his
company, who are garbed in
brilliant white body stockings
with soft rainbow shading on the
forearms of the women and the
ankles of the men.
Set off against his dancers
Cunningham is a strange somber
force. They are a virtuoistic,
dazzling yet anonymous unit,
representing the beauty and cold
precision of immaculately trained
dancers in their prime.
Although his more dauntless
physical powers art 1 waning,
Cunningham can still captivate an
audience with his incredible speed
and irresistible conviction in
movement.
In his Solo dance Sunday
evening Cunningham performed
the simplest of gestures; an
inquisitively cocked head, a
tentatively arched instep, and a
suggestively brushing leg, yet the
effect was spellbinding.
Undoubtedly he still has the
power to arouse and awe, and if
not by technical virtuosity then
by passion.
Proficient technicians in dance
are common, but creative genius
and profound insight are not.
Cunningham's Berkeley concerts
were joyous affirmation that
senescence for this eminent spirit
is still a long way off.
