# Cranston Sees His 'Big Story' Revived
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
"It's like old times. The lines
are coming back to me," the
elated U.S. senator from
California tells several old friends
crowded around him in the small
theatre lobby.
You might expect that
someone as successful as Alan
Cranston in winning two elections
both as state controller and U.S.
senator is remembering a victory
speech.
Instead, he is reminiscing about
his first and only play, The Big
Story, at its opening last Friday
night at the Manhattan Playhouse
in East Palo Alto.
Cranston's work as a foreign
correspondent in Italy shortly
after he graduated from Stanford
in 1936 served as much of the
basis for the comedy about two
reporters trying to "scoop" a
story about a planned assassination
of Mussolini.
Co-Authors Curious
Standing next to the play's
co-author, cartoonist Lee Falk of
the "Mandrake" strip, Cranston
lowers his voice as he admits to
members of the sellout audience
of about 200 that he, too, is

curious to see the play.
Neither Cranston nor Falk has
seen The Big Story since its only
previous production in
Maplewood, New Jersey in 1940,
the same year they wrote the
play.
Cranston's and Falk's curiosity
turns to mirth as they watch their
creation satirize everything from
the tough reporter who won't
leave his 24-hour job for a
moment — even though his wife is
giving birth to their first child —
to Mussolini, impersonated by a
surly janitor whose only English
is, "I'm pleased to meet you."
Ridiculous Events
The two reporters get their
story through a ridiculous chain
of events reminiscent of The
Front Page, but spend the rest of
the play escaping retaliation by
the assassin and the fascist soldiers
angry that the truth has been
printed.
The audience laughes
frequently but occasionally misses
jokes that leave the two authors
smiling widely, whispering to each
other and laughing. Falk, in his
black and white checkerboard suit
that looks flashy in contrast to

Cranston's modest gray suit,
resembles a Hollywood producer
consulting his lawyer.
Cranston tries to restrain his
laughter as he watches the tough
reporter's bungling young
assistant, William Dudley,
misinterpret, forget and ignore
telephone messages because he
can't understand Italian. Dudley's
boss threatens to fire him if he
doesn't leam the language soon.
Cranston Congratulates
At the reception after the play,
Cranston congratulates Robert
Chase on his role as Dudley.
Chase, blushing and pressing his
fist to his forehead, cries out, "I
didn't know it was you, Senator."
Cranston admits some of
Dudley's experiences are based on
his own: "I remember being very
scared of that phone ringing.
There were many stringers around
Italy that would phone in stories
at all hours of the day and night
trying to beat the competition . ..
"Because I couldn't understand
Italian, I was always afraid that
I'd miss stories they'd called in,
bills and other things. My boss
told me if I didn't learn to speak
Italian within three months, he'd
fire me."
Roughly Speaking
Cranston said he learned to
speak it "roughly." Apparently
that was good enough as Cranston
continued work with the
International News Service
traveling also to England, Ethiopia
and Germany between 1936 and
1938.

During this time in Italy,
Cranston met Falk, already a
syndicated cartoonist for King
Features, Ire. When the two
returned to the U.S. they began
work on the play by swapping
stories about their newspaper
experiences for three or four
months. They worked on the
actual writing for 66 hours,
Cranston calculated.
Falk explains that after the
play's brief debut in New Jersey,
no one pushed to continue it
because "we [the United States]
were ready to go to war and
Mussolini was no longer a joke."
Stashed Away
The play remained stashed
away in a drawer until a friend of
the Cranston family heard of it
and approached the co-owner of
the Manhattan Playhouse, Judith
Dresch, who agreed to produce
and direct the comedy.
Dresch says she thinks the play
is good enough that she would
have staged it even if Cranston
hadn't been one of its authors.
Amidst the clink of champagne
glasses and chatter of the
reception, a typical reaction was,
"It may not go to Broadway, but
it was great fun."
Falk admits to one reporter
that he agrees with a Palo Alto
Times review which claims the
play needs some rewriting: "Oh
yes. You have to realize we
weren't professional playwrights."
However, Falk adds that their
agent had negotiated with a

Broadway producer who had
showed some interest but then
rejected the play. Falk, who has
already written several other
plays, says he plans to continue
writing drama.
Cranston says he does not,
explaining he enjoyed working on
his one play but doesn't have the
time for more. Asked if he would
consider returning to drama if he
retired from politics, Cranston
replies: "I've always enjoyed
writing. I've written a book,
several magazine articles and
newspaper columns. I intend to
continue writing."
Then leaning over closer to one
reporter, he adds, "But I intend
to stay in politics for some time."
As Cranston circulates through
the reception sharing champagne
and conversation, no one would
have disagreed.
However, one Massachusetts
resident seemed so worried he
telegraphs Cranston all the way
from Washington, D.C. to warn
him "just because Ronald Reagan
and George Murphy gave up the
theatre for politics doesn't mean
you should give up politics for the
theatre."
The message was signed,
"Sincerely, Teddy Kennedy,"
perhaps with a little jealousy.

Cranston tries to restrain his
laughter as he watches the tough
reporter's bungling young
assistant, William Dudley,
misinterpret, forget and ignore
telephone messages because he
can't understand Italian. Dudley's
boss threatens to fire him if he
doesn't leam the language soon.
Cranston Congratulates
At the reception after the play,
Cranston congratulates Robert
Chase on his role as Dudley.
Chase, blushing and pressing his
fist to his forehead, cries out, "I
didn't know it was you, Senator."
Cranston admits some of
Dudley's experiences are based on
his own: "I remember being very
scared of that phone ringing.
There were many stringers around
Italy that would phone in stories
at all hours of the day and night
trying to beat the competition . ..
"Because I couldn't understand
Italian, I was always afraid that
I'd miss stories they'd called in,
bills and other things. My boss
told me if I didn't learn to speak
Italian within three months, he'd
fire me."
Roughly Speaking
Cranston said he learned to
speak it "roughly." Apparently
that was good enough as Cranston
continued work with the
International News Service
traveling also to England, Ethiopia
and Germany between 1936 and
1938.

During this time in Italy,
Cranston met Falk, already a
syndicated cartoonist for King
Features, Ire. When the two
returned to the U.S. they began
work on the play by swapping
stories about their newspaper
experiences for three or four
months. They worked on the
actual writing for 66 hours,
Cranston calculated.
Falk explains that after the
play's brief debut in New Jersey,
no one pushed to continue it
because "we [the United States]
were ready to go to war and
Mussolini was no longer a joke."
Stashed Away
The play remained stashed
away in a drawer until a friend of
the Cranston family heard of it
and approached the co-owner of
the Manhattan Playhouse, Judith
Dresch, who agreed to produce
and direct the comedy.
Dresch says she thinks the play
is good enough that she would
have staged it even if Cranston
hadn't been one of its authors.
Amidst the clink of champagne
glasses and chatter of the
reception, a typical reaction was,
"It may not go to Broadway, but
it was great fun."
Falk admits to one reporter
that he agrees with a Palo Alto
Times review which claims the
play needs some rewriting: "Oh
yes. You have to realize we
weren't professional playwrights."
However, Falk adds that their
agent had negotiated with a

Broadway producer who had
showed some interest but then
rejected the play. Falk, who has
already written several other
plays, says he plans to continue
writing drama.
Cranston says he does not,
explaining he enjoyed working on
his one play but doesn't have the
time for more. Asked if he would
consider returning to drama if he
retired from politics, Cranston
replies: "I've always enjoyed
writing. I've written a book,
several magazine articles and
newspaper columns. I intend to
continue writing."
Then leaning over closer to one
reporter, he adds, "But I intend
to stay in politics for some time."
As Cranston circulates through
the reception sharing champagne
and conversation, no one would
have disagreed.
However, one Massachusetts
resident seemed so worried he
telegraphs Cranston all the way
from Washington, D.C. to warn
him "just because Ronald Reagan
and George Murphy gave up the
theatre for politics doesn't mean
you should give up politics for the
theatre."
The message was signed,
"Sincerely, Teddy Kennedy,"
perhaps with a little jealousy.
"It's like old times. The lines
are coming back to me," the
elated U.S. senator from
California tells several old friends
crowded around him in the small
theatre lobby.
You might expect that
someone as successful as Alan
Cranston in winning two elections
both as state controller and U.S.
senator is remembering a victory
speech.
Instead, he is reminiscing about
his first and only play, The Big
Story, at its opening last Friday
night at the Manhattan Playhouse
in East Palo Alto.
Cranston's work as a foreign
correspondent in Italy shortly
after he graduated from Stanford
in 1936 served as much of the
basis for the comedy about two
reporters trying to "scoop" a
story about a planned assassination
of Mussolini.
Co-Authors Curious
Standing next to the play's
co-author, cartoonist Lee Falk of
the "Mandrake" strip, Cranston
lowers his voice as he admits to
members of the sellout audience
of about 200 that he, too, is

curious to see the play.
Neither Cranston nor Falk has
seen The Big Story since its only
previous production in
Maplewood, New Jersey in 1940,
the same year they wrote the
play.
Cranston's and Falk's curiosity
turns to mirth as they watch their
creation satirize everything from
the tough reporter who won't
leave his 24-hour job for a
moment — even though his wife is
giving birth to their first child —
to Mussolini, impersonated by a
surly janitor whose only English
is, "I'm pleased to meet you."
Ridiculous Events
The two reporters get their
story through a ridiculous chain
of events reminiscent of The
Front Page, but spend the rest of
the play escaping retaliation by
the assassin and the fascist soldiers
angry that the truth has been
printed.
The audience laughes
frequently but occasionally misses
jokes that leave the two authors
smiling widely, whispering to each
other and laughing. Falk, in his
black and white checkerboard suit
that looks flashy in contrast to

Cranston's modest gray suit,
resembles a Hollywood producer
consulting his lawyer.

hadn't been one of its authors.
Amidst the clink of champagne
glasses and chatter of the
reception, a typical reaction was,
"It may not go to Broadway, but
it was great fun."
Falk admits to one reporter
that he agrees with a Palo Alto
Times review which claims the
play needs some rewriting: "Oh
yes. You have to realize we
weren't professional playwrights."
However, Falk adds that their
agent had negotiated with a

Broadway producer who had
showed some interest but then
rejected the play. Falk, who has
already written several other
plays, says he plans to continue
writing drama.
Cranston says he does not,
explaining he enjoyed working on
his one play but doesn't have the
time for more. Asked if he would
consider returning to drama if he
retired from politics, Cranston
replies: "I've always enjoyed
writing. I've written a book,
several magazine articles and
newspaper columns. I intend to
continue writing."
Then leaning over closer to one
reporter, he adds, "But I intend
to stay in politics for some time."
As Cranston circulates through
the reception sharing champagne
and conversation, no one would
have disagreed.
However, one Massachusetts
resident seemed so worried he
telegraphs Cranston all the way
from Washington, D.C. to warn
him "just because Ronald Reagan
and George Murphy gave up the
theatre for politics doesn't mean
you should give up politics for the
theatre."
The message was signed,
"Sincerely, Teddy Kennedy,"
perhaps with a little jealousy.
"It's like old times. The lines
are coming back to me," the
elated U.S. senator from
California tells several old friends
crowded around him in the small
theatre lobby.
You might expect that
someone as successful as Alan
Cranston in winning two elections
both as state controller and U.S.
senator is remembering a victory
speech.
Instead, he is reminiscing about
his first and only play, The Big
Story, at its opening last Friday
night at the Manhattan Playhouse
in East Palo Alto.
Cranston's work as a foreign
correspondent in Italy shortly
after he graduated from Stanford
in 1936 served as much of the
basis for the comedy about two
reporters trying to "scoop" a
story about a planned assassination
of Mussolini.
Co-Authors Curious
Standing next to the play's
co-author, cartoonist Lee Falk of
the "Mandrake" strip, Cranston
lowers his voice as he admits to
members of the sellout audience
of about 200 that he, too, is

curious to see the play.
Neither Cranston nor Falk has
seen The Big Story since its only
previous production in
Maplewood, New Jersey in 1940,
the same year they wrote the
play.
Cranston's and Falk's curiosity
turns to mirth as they watch their
creation satirize everything from
the tough reporter who won't
leave his 24-hour job for a
moment — even though his wife is
giving birth to their first child —
to Mussolini, impersonated by a
surly janitor whose only English
is, "I'm pleased to meet you."
Ridiculous Events
The two reporters get their
story through a ridiculous chain
of events reminiscent of The
Front Page, but spend the rest of
the play escaping retaliation by
the assassin and the fascist soldiers
angry that the truth has been
printed.
The audience laughes
frequently but occasionally misses
jokes that leave the two authors
smiling widely, whispering to each
other and laughing. Falk, in his
black and white checkerboard suit
that looks flashy in contrast to

Cranston's modest gray suit,
resembles a Hollywood producer
consulting his lawyer.
Cranston tries to restrain his
laughter as he watches the tough
reporter's bungling young
assistant, William Dudley,
misinterpret, forget and ignore
telephone messages because he
can't understand Italian. Dudley's
boss threatens to fire him if he
doesn't leam the language soon.
Cranston Congratulates
At the reception after the play,
Cranston congratulates Robert
Chase on his role as Dudley.
Chase, blushing and pressing his
fist to his forehead, cries out, "I
didn't know it was you, Senator."
Cranston admits some of
Dudley's experiences are based on
his own: "I remember being very
scared of that phone ringing.
There were many stringers around
Italy that would phone in stories
at all hours of the day and night
trying to beat the competition . ..
"Because I couldn't understand
Italian, I was always afraid that
I'd miss stories they'd called in,
bills and other things. My boss
told me if I didn't learn to speak
Italian within three months, he'd
fire me."
Roughly Speaking
Cranston said he learned to
speak it "roughly." Apparently
that was good enough as Cranston
continued work with the
International News Service
traveling also to England, Ethiopia
and Germany between 1936 and
1938.

During this time in Italy,
Cranston met Falk, already a
syndicated cartoonist for King
Features, Ire. When the two
returned to the U.S. they began
work on the play by swapping
stories about their newspaper
experiences for three or four
months. They worked on the
actual writing for 66 hours,
Cranston calculated.
Falk explains that after the
play's brief debut in New Jersey,
no one pushed to continue it
because "we [the United States]
were ready to go to war and
Mussolini was no longer a joke."
Stashed Away
The play remained stashed
away in a drawer until a friend of
the Cranston family heard of it
and approached the co-owner of
the Manhattan Playhouse, Judith
Dresch, who agreed to produce
and direct the comedy.
Dresch says she thinks the play
is good enough that she would
have staged it even if Cranston
hadn't been one of its authors.
Amidst the clink of champagne
glasses and chatter of the
reception, a typical reaction was,
"It may not go to Broadway, but
