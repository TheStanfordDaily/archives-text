# Class Of '76 To Vote In Runoff
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Juniors will go to the polls
tomorrow and Thursday for the third
time in as many weeks to choose next
year's senior class officers.
Two slates, headed by "Weird
Walt" Spevak and Dan Poston,
emerged victorious from a special
rerun election last week.
The special election was authorized
by the ASSU Senate after two slates,
headed by Poston and Lyse Strnad.
spent more than $50. Many had
understood $50 to be the campaign
spending limit.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald said he told Poston the limit
was, in fact, $200. Strnad, a member
of the committee which wrote the
present rules, agreed with Fitzgerlad's
interpretation.
"I'm on the Bylaws Committee that
rewrote the procedure," Strnad
commented. "I really assumed the
limit was $200."
Bylaws Vague
The ASSU Bylaws regarding senior
class officers specify no campaign
spending limit. But the electioneering
section of the bylaws contains the
following provision:
"Candidates for [the Council of
Presidents) may spend, as a ticket, up
to $200 for electioneering. All other
candidates may spend up to $50."
According to Fitzgerald, he
assumed that the four senior class
candidates could pool their $50 each,
totaling $200.
"1 didn't even consider there was
another interpretation until Thursday
of the first election. No other
interpretation came to my mind,"
Fitzgerald related.
Representatives from the Poston
and Strnad slates asked him the actual
amount of the limit. Fitzgerald said.
Me added that he did not consider
telling other slates about the limit,
because he did not feel the bylaws
were vague.
Election Too 'Political'
"What usually happens when 1 pass
out instructions to anyone — say, to
election workers — is I get a lot of
phone calls" asking clarification,
Fitzgerald said. "Usually, it's because a
person hasn't read that part of the
rules carefully," he argued, saying he
originally thought this was such a case.
After the ASSU Senate threw out
the results of the first election and
called for a new vote including all six
slates, two slates dropped out.
Leo Salazar and Frank Ramirez,
heads of the two slates which declined
to continue the race, both criticized
Fitzgerald for allowing the election to
become too "political." "In my
opinion, Fitzgerald did a very nice job
of alienating the other slates from the
election process," Ramirez
commented. "I said to him, 'We won't
be party to your folly.' "
"We just felt that the election was
just going to be your typical class
election," Salazar noted. "We didn't
think it would turn into your deceitful
type of campaign. That was our big
complaint . . . I'm just real
disappointed that it all had to
happen."
Traditionally 'Low Key'
All the slates agreed that the senior
class election had traditionally been a
"low-key" campaign. Lise Pfeiffer,
currently senior class president, said

spending was far less last year.
"Last year we spent about $9.35. I
don't remember any limit, any
information on it. The $9.35 went for
less than 1000 — maybe 800 — flyers.
We thought the campaign should be
run on the issues," Pfeiffer said.
But this year's campaign was one of
"name-recognition," according to
Salazar. And Ramirez said he objected
to the senate's decision to set an
arbitrary $85 spending limit Monday
night, with the voting scheduled for
Wednesday.
"The Strnad-lTim] Conway slate
was looking after its own interests in
the senate. We were told on a Monday
night that we had tomorrow —
Tuesday — to spend $50 and catch
up" with the other slates, Ramirez
charged. Strnad and running-mate
Conway are ASSU senators.
Conway voted with the majority on
an 8-1 vote to disqualify
non-registered students from running
for office. At the time, there was a
question as to whether Poston was a
registered student. The Registrar's
Office has since ruled that Poston is
registered.
A motion to allow the Poston slate
to stand failed by one vote, with

Strnad abstaining.
"I refrained from all discussion in
the interest of fairness, and I didn't do
any voting," Strnad said. "I've been
criticized both ways. Some people said
I should not be voting; others said I
should be voting . . . We certainly were
not looking out for our own interests
in any way."
For a while, the actual date of the
primary election was in doubt, Spevak
reported.
"I read the Reg Packet calendar
that the Chaparral puts out, and it says
that the primary is April 9 and 10 with
the final on April 16 and 17," he
commented. The actual dates were one
week later.
Poston blamed Fitzgerald for the
myriad of mixups, saying the senate's
remedial actions were ineffective.
"They should make things clear at
the beginning," Poston explained. "It's
a lot of half-baked ideas [from the
senate] to patch up the whole mess."

Two slates, headed by "Weird
Walt" Spevak and Dan Poston,
emerged victorious from a special
rerun election last week.
The special election was authorized
by the ASSU Senate after two slates,
headed by Poston and Lyse Strnad.
spent more than $50. Many had
understood $50 to be the campaign
spending limit.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald said he told Poston the limit
was, in fact, $200. Strnad, a member
of the committee which wrote the
present rules, agreed with Fitzgerlad's
interpretation.
"I'm on the Bylaws Committee that
rewrote the procedure," Strnad
commented. "I really assumed the
limit was $200."
Bylaws Vague
The ASSU Bylaws regarding senior
class officers specify no campaign
spending limit. But the electioneering
section of the bylaws contains the
following provision:
"Candidates for [the Council of
Presidents) may spend, as a ticket, up
to $200 for electioneering. All other
candidates may spend up to $50."
According to Fitzgerald, he
assumed that the four senior class
candidates could pool their $50 each,
totaling $200.
"1 didn't even consider there was
another interpretation until Thursday
of the first election. No other
interpretation came to my mind,"
Fitzgerald related.
Representatives from the Poston
and Strnad slates asked him the actual
amount of the limit. Fitzgerald said.
Me added that he did not consider
telling other slates about the limit,
because he did not feel the bylaws
were vague.
Election Too 'Political'
"What usually happens when 1 pass
out instructions to anyone — say, to
election workers — is I get a lot of
phone calls" asking clarification,
Fitzgerald said. "Usually, it's because a
person hasn't read that part of the
rules carefully," he argued, saying he
originally thought this was such a case.
After the ASSU Senate threw out
the results of the first election and
called for a new vote including all six
slates, two slates dropped out.
Leo Salazar and Frank Ramirez,
heads of the two slates which declined
to continue the race, both criticized
Fitzgerald for allowing the election to
become too "political." "In my
opinion, Fitzgerald did a very nice job
of alienating the other slates from the
election process," Ramirez
commented. "I said to him, 'We won't
be party to your folly.' "
"We just felt that the election was
just going to be your typical class
election," Salazar noted. "We didn't
think it would turn into your deceitful
type of campaign. That was our big
complaint . . . I'm just real
disappointed that it all had to
happen."
Traditionally 'Low Key'
All the slates agreed that the senior
class election had traditionally been a
"low-key" campaign. Lise Pfeiffer,
currently senior class president, said

spending was far less last year.
"Last year we spent about $9.35. I
don't remember any limit, any
information on it. The $9.35 went for
less than 1000 — maybe 800 — flyers.
We thought the campaign should be
run on the issues," Pfeiffer said.
But this year's campaign was one of
"name-recognition," according to
Salazar. And Ramirez said he objected
to the senate's decision to set an
arbitrary $85 spending limit Monday
night, with the voting scheduled for
Wednesday.
"The Strnad-lTim] Conway slate
was looking after its own interests in
the senate. We were told on a Monday
night that we had tomorrow —
Tuesday — to spend $50 and catch
up" with the other slates, Ramirez
charged. Strnad and running-mate
Conway are ASSU senators.
Conway voted with the majority on
an 8-1 vote to disqualify
non-registered students from running
for office. At the time, there was a
question as to whether Poston was a
registered student. The Registrar's
Office has since ruled that Poston is
registered.
A motion to allow the Poston slate
to stand failed by one vote, with

Strnad abstaining.
"I refrained from all discussion in
the interest of fairness, and I didn't do
any voting," Strnad said. "I've been
criticized both ways. Some people said
I should not be voting; others said I
should be voting . . . We certainly were
not looking out for our own interests
in any way."
For a while, the actual date of the
primary election was in doubt, Spevak
reported.
"I read the Reg Packet calendar
that the Chaparral puts out, and it says
that the primary is April 9 and 10 with
the final on April 16 and 17," he
commented. The actual dates were one
week later.
Poston blamed Fitzgerald for the
myriad of mixups, saying the senate's
remedial actions were ineffective.
"They should make things clear at
the beginning," Poston explained. "It's
a lot of half-baked ideas [from the
senate] to patch up the whole mess."

Juniors will go to the polls
tomorrow and Thursday for the third
time in as many weeks to choose next
year's senior class officers.
Two slates, headed by "Weird
Walt" Spevak and Dan Poston,
emerged victorious from a special
rerun election last week.
The special election was authorized
by the ASSU Senate after two slates,
headed by Poston and Lyse Strnad.
spent more than $50. Many had
understood $50 to be the campaign
spending limit.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald said he told Poston the limit
was, in fact, $200. Strnad, a member
of the committee which wrote the
present rules, agreed with Fitzgerlad's
interpretation.
"I'm on the Bylaws Committee that
rewrote the procedure," Strnad
commented. "I really assumed the
limit was $200."
Bylaws Vague
The ASSU Bylaws regarding senior
class officers specify no campaign
spending limit. But the electioneering
section of the bylaws contains the
following provision:
"Candidates for [the Council of
Presidents) may spend, as a ticket, up
to $200 for electioneering. All other
candidates may spend up to $50."
According to Fitzgerald, he
assumed that the four senior class
candidates could pool their $50 each,
totaling $200.
"1 didn't even consider there was
another interpretation until Thursday
of the first election. No other
interpretation came to my mind,"
Fitzgerald related.
Representatives from the Poston
and Strnad slates asked him the actual
amount of the limit. Fitzgerald said.
Me added that he did not consider
telling other slates about the limit,
because he did not feel the bylaws
were vague.
Election Too 'Political'
"What usually happens when 1 pass
out instructions to anyone — say, to
election workers — is I get a lot of
phone calls" asking clarification,
Fitzgerald said. "Usually, it's because a
person hasn't read that part of the
rules carefully," he argued, saying he
originally thought this was such a case.
After the ASSU Senate threw out
the results of the first election and
called for a new vote including all six
slates, two slates dropped out.
Leo Salazar and Frank Ramirez,
heads of the two slates which declined
to continue the race, both criticized
Fitzgerald for allowing the election to
become too "political." "In my
opinion, Fitzgerald did a very nice job
of alienating the other slates from the
election process," Ramirez
commented. "I said to him, 'We won't
be party to your folly.' "
"We just felt that the election was
just going to be your typical class
election," Salazar noted. "We didn't
think it would turn into your deceitful
type of campaign. That was our big
complaint . . . I'm just real
disappointed that it all had to
happen."
Traditionally 'Low Key'
All the slates agreed that the senior
class election had traditionally been a
"low-key" campaign. Lise Pfeiffer,
currently senior class president, said

spending was far less last year.
"Last year we spent about $9.35. I
don't remember any limit, any
information on it. The $9.35 went for
less than 1000 — maybe 800 — flyers.
We thought the campaign should be
run on the issues," Pfeiffer said.
But this year's campaign was one of
"name-recognition," according to
Salazar. And Ramirez said he objected
to the senate's decision to set an
arbitrary $85 spending limit Monday
night, with the voting scheduled for
Wednesday.
"The Strnad-lTim] Conway slate
was looking after its own interests in
the senate. We were told on a Monday
night that we had tomorrow —
Tuesday — to spend $50 and catch
up" with the other slates, Ramirez
charged. Strnad and running-mate
Conway are ASSU senators.
Conway voted with the majority on
an 8-1 vote to disqualify
non-registered students from running
for office. At the time, there was a
question as to whether Poston was a
registered student. The Registrar's
Office has since ruled that Poston is
registered.
A motion to allow the Poston slate
to stand failed by one vote, with

Strnad abstaining.
"I refrained from all discussion in
the interest of fairness, and I didn't do
any voting," Strnad said. "I've been
criticized both ways. Some people said
I should not be voting; others said I
should be voting . . . We certainly were
not looking out for our own interests
in any way."
For a while, the actual date of the
primary election was in doubt, Spevak
reported.
"I read the Reg Packet calendar
that the Chaparral puts out, and it says
that the primary is April 9 and 10 with
the final on April 16 and 17," he
commented. The actual dates were one
week later.
Poston blamed Fitzgerald for the
myriad of mixups, saying the senate's
remedial actions were ineffective.
"They should make things clear at
the beginning," Poston explained. "It's
a lot of half-baked ideas [from the
senate] to patch up the whole mess."
