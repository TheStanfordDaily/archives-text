Frederick Exley
PAGES FROM A COLD ISLAND
Random House; 274 pages; $7.95
Probably no one will claim that
Frederick Exley is producing great
literature, but he has
demonstrated some interesting
things about writing.
A couple of years ago, with the
publication of A Fan's Notes, he
proved that you can write a book
about your own life, call the main
character by your own name,
change the names of the minor
characters to "A," "B," and so on
to avoid lawsuits, and thus win
the William Faulkner Award (yes,
it's a real award) for "the year's
most notable first novel."
And now, with Pages From a
Cold Island, Exley has showed
that on the basis of a book like
Notes, you can not only call
yourself a novelist but also write a
book about how it feels to be a
novelist, all the while winking
slyly at those literary folks who
are busily involved in debating
whether you have actually ever
written a novel in the first place.
Exley gets along surprisingly
well on this sort of foolishness.
His writing is consistently fresh, at
times hilarious and often engaging
— amazingly so for the story of a
man who, by his own description,
seems to be a combination of
amiable drunkard, timid

intellectual and minor-league
sexpot.
And Exley is also a
hero-worshipper with a rather
bizarre set of heroes. In A Fan's
Notes Exley told of his fanatical
devotion to Frank Gifford —
although this was, of course, the
good old Gifford of New York
Giants days, not the latter-day
version, Howard Cosell's straight
man.
But the idol that Exley reverses
most in the pages of Pages is
literary critic and sometime
novelist Edmund Wilson, whose
particular attractiveness to Exley
seems to be that they both lived
in upstate New York.
One complication is that, by
the time the book opens, Wilson
already just died — but the
grief-stricken Exley goes on to
interview Wilson's long-time typist
and to have a picnic with Wilson's
daughter Rosalind.
In the end, Exley's
preoccupation with Wilson
doesn't lead to anything
particularly meaningful, but there
are some fascinating digressions;
Exley talking somewhat
sheepishly to Gloria Steinem (the
very funny interview has been
printed before this in Playboy), or
wandering around the University
of lowa as a creative-writing
teacher.
To this Exley adds some pokes
at that ogre Norman Mailer, and
some entertaining sketches of
acquaintances, mostly bartenders.
Almost everything is believable,
with the notable exception of
Exley's portrait of Gabrielle< "An
astonishingly beautiful
22-year-old ... a recent magna
cum laude Stanford graduate and
a lesbian."
But why all this, instead of a
novel? Gore Vidal is supposed to
have said that speaking before a
crowd is the greatest possible
orgasm. I think Exley may like
writing about himself almost as
much as Gore likes talking in
front of a crowd.
So Exley's pleasant ramblings
will probably continue for a few
more volumes — whatever he has
to say about himself will be fun to
read. But perhaps Exley would
have even more fun if he thought
of another character besides
himself.

intellectual and minor-league
sexpot.
And Exley is also a
hero-worshipper with a rather
bizarre set of heroes. In A Fan's
Notes Exley told of his fanatical
devotion to Frank Gifford —
although this was, of course, the
good old Gifford of New York
Giants days, not the latter-day
version, Howard Cosell's straight
man.
But the idol that Exley reverses
most in the pages of Pages is
literary critic and sometime
novelist Edmund Wilson, whose
particular attractiveness to Exley
seems to be that they both lived
in upstate New York.
One complication is that, by
the time the book opens, Wilson
already just died — but the
grief-stricken Exley goes on to
interview Wilson's long-time typist
and to have a picnic with Wilson's
daughter Rosalind.
In the end, Exley's
preoccupation with Wilson
doesn't lead to anything
particularly meaningful, but there
are some fascinating digressions;
Exley talking somewhat
sheepishly to Gloria Steinem (the
very funny interview has been
printed before this in Playboy), or
wandering around the University
of lowa as a creative-writing
teacher.
To this Exley adds some pokes
at that ogre Norman Mailer, and
some entertaining sketches of
acquaintances, mostly bartenders.
Almost everything is believable,
with the notable exception of
Exley's portrait of Gabrielle< "An
astonishingly beautiful
22-year-old ... a recent magna
cum laude Stanford graduate and
a lesbian."
But why all this, instead of a
novel? Gore Vidal is supposed to
have said that speaking before a
crowd is the greatest possible
orgasm. I think Exley may like
writing about himself almost as
much as Gore likes talking in
front of a crowd.
So Exley's pleasant ramblings
will probably continue for a few
more volumes — whatever he has
to say about himself will be fun to
read. But perhaps Exley would
have even more fun if he thought
of another character besides
himself.

PAGES FROM A COLD ISLAND
Random House; 274 pages; $7.95
Probably no one will claim that
Frederick Exley is producing great
literature, but he has
demonstrated some interesting
things about writing.
A couple of years ago, with the
publication of A Fan's Notes, he
proved that you can write a book
about your own life, call the main
character by your own name,
change the names of the minor
characters to "A," "B," and so on
to avoid lawsuits, and thus win
the William Faulkner Award (yes,
it's a real award) for "the year's
most notable first novel."
And now, with Pages From a
Cold Island, Exley has showed
that on the basis of a book like
Notes, you can not only call
yourself a novelist but also write a
book about how it feels to be a
novelist, all the while winking
slyly at those literary folks who
are busily involved in debating
whether you have actually ever
written a novel in the first place.
Exley gets along surprisingly
well on this sort of foolishness.
His writing is consistently fresh, at
times hilarious and often engaging
— amazingly so for the story of a
man who, by his own description,
seems to be a combination of
amiable drunkard, timid

intellectual and minor-league
sexpot.
And Exley is also a
hero-worshipper with a rather
bizarre set of heroes. In A Fan's

devotion to Frank Gifford —
