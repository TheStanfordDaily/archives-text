20,000 Refugees Arrive In California
CAMP PENDLRTON — The first wave of an estimated
20,000 Indochina war tefugees arrived here yesterday and
today. They stay at this base near Richard Nixon's seaside
estate.
Nine aircraft carrying 700 refugees from U.S. bases in
the Pacific will land about noon at El Toro Marine Corps
Air Station, military spokesmen said last yesterday.
Earlier yesterday, Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. sharply
criticized "haphazard" federal plans to relocate the
thousands of homeless war victims in the state.
He said California "can not afford" more unemployment
which the refugee influx would spur.
It was reported by spokesmen that Brown was balking at
a request by the federal government that he make available
$100,000 to set up temporary facilities to aid the refugees
in California.
Mario Obledo, head of the state's health and welfare
agency, said the governor wanted more information on the
refugee situation before releasing any state money for their
relocation.
Most of the Vietnamese refugees are from the upper
echelons of Saigon society.
Most are educated with professional skills — medical
doctors, embassy workers, defense technicians trained in
the United States, employes of U.S. companies, university
professors — and many were in some way associated with
the U.S. war effort.
But every refugee left most of his material possessions
behind in fleeing war-torn Vietnam. They have been living
in tents and military huts on Guam, Philippines and Wake.
"Everybody is working around the clock to get ready for
them," said Lt. Col. Arthur Brill, the base public
information officer.
Siege Ends At Israeli Consulate
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A siege of the Israeli
Consulate in downtown Johannesburg ended early
yesterday after 16 hours, and Police Minister Jimmy Kruger
announced that an assistant security officer at the consulate
with "some political axe to grind" was responsible.
At least two persons were killed and more than 33
wounded during a series of gun battles after six terrorists
stormed the fifth-floor consulate yesterday afternoon.
In Jerusalem, Israeli radio reported that eight more
persons were wounded in another outburst of firing just
before midnight.
Most of the casualties were bystanders near the six-story
building located in the center of the city's movie and
theater district.
Five wounded hostages have been released by the
terrorists. Two were identified as Vice Consul Shemi Zur
and Consul General Arieh Bustan.
Israeli sources said 12 hostages, including at least two
children, were being held. However, Police Minister James
Kruger told newsmen it is estimated that between 27 and
32 persons, including the gunmen, are holed up on the fifth
floor of the building.
A police spokesman said the terrorists had demanded
surgical masks, white coats and 27 Sten guns by a 4 a.m.
GMT — 8 p.m. PDT — deadline yesterday.
The spokesman said the terrorists' idea is to dress
themselves and their hostages alike so authorities will not
be able to distinguish between them if they leave the
building. He said the idea was to give nonworking Sten guns
to the hostages, making them look exactly like the gunmen,
who would be armed.
The police minister also said the terrorists had demanded
a helicopter capable of carrying 20 persons, and an El A 1
Airliner to take them to Israel.

Witnesses Diseuss Remiro's Guns
SACRAMENTO — Defendant Joseph Remiro's gun
collection — including a rifle he won as a door prize — was
described by prosecution witnesses at the Marcus Foster
murder trial yesterday.
But the defense — including Remiro, who
cross-examined a witness — pointed out that there was
nothing illegal about the assortment of shotguns, rifles and
pistols., or about Remiro's activity as a gun instructor.
Remiro and Little, avowed members of the Symbionese
Liberation Army, are charged with killing Foster, Oakland's
superintendent of schools, and wounding his top aide,
Robert Blackburn, on Nov. 6, 1973.
The eighth day of testimony included documents and
statements saying Remiro owned in 1973:
-A semi-automatic rifle.
—Two ,12-guage shotguns.
—Two .380 Walther automatic pistols, including one
found on him when he was arrested Jan. 10, 1974 after a
shootout with Concord police.
—A .30-30 Winchester rifle, which he won as a door
prize at the grand opening of Siegle's Guns, Inc., in
Oakland. A witness said Remiro later traded the rifle to him
for a ,30-caliber military carbine.
Panel OK's Nuclear Reactors' Safety
WASHINGTON — There is no immediate danger of
nuclear power reactor accidents that would release large
quantities of radiation, an American Physical Society study
group reported yesterday.
But the special panel, which began studying the problem
of power reactor safety last summer, called for substantial
increases in safety-related research in coming years to
resolve many uncertainties in the operation of the large
plants that generate electricity by splitting the atom.
"We have not uncovered reasons for substantial
short-range concern regarding risk of accidents in
light-water reactors," the panel said in the report released
to the annual spring meeting of the society here.
But because of the serious consequences that might
follow a major reactor accident, the panel warned: "We
believe that there should be a continuing major effort to
improve light water reactor safety as well as to understand
and mitigate the consequences of possible accidents."
Much of the concern over nuclear power plant safety
centers on a possible accident in which the water that cools
the reactor's core is lost, causing the rods containing
radioactive reactor fuel to melt, leading to a rupture of the
reactor's enclosing vessel.
Economy Index Shows March Drop
WASHINGTON — A government index reversed for
March what had been the first solid gain since the recession
started, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
But the slip was so slight that the index remained just
ahead of where it was in January, after six consecutive
months of decline amounting to 14 percent.
The March drop amounted to five-tenths of one percent.
February's increase — originally reported as one percent —
was revised downward to show a six-tenths of one percent
climb.
"The latest decline is not inconsistent with prospects of
a recovery around midyear," said James Pate, Commerce's
top economist.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with low clouds or fog along
the coast increasing somewhat tonight. Small craft advisory
for northwest winds 15 to 25 mph afternoons. Cooler near
the coast tomorrow. Low tonight in the low 40s to low 50s.
