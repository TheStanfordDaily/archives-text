# Shuttle Bus Service Ends
## 
### MICHELE FARRAK 
Stanford's nighttime shuttle bus service has completed
its trial period here, but Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape said the service will not continue to run.
"It has served its purpose as an experiment," Snape said
at a press conference yesterday afternoon, "and considering
the lack of funds, we'll not continue with the experiment
this quarter." The bus service will start again next fall if it
receives funding.
A parking study released yesterday by the University
Committee on Land and Building Development (C-LBD)
may provide funds for the shuttle. If the study is approved,
Snape said he is hopeful the bus will run again.
Gloria Guth, head of the Committee on Graduate
Women on Safety at Stanford, pointed out that if the
Carpenter parking study is accepted, a Transportation
Committee will be established to investigate campus
transportation problems.
"Another thing we could try to do is look into

institutional donors — maybe oil companies," said Guth.
Most students who used the service indicated an
unwillingness to pay for the ride, and suggested University
funding. The projected operational costs for a year are
estimated at $15,000.
Snape said that the bus averaged nine riders per night
during the three-week experiment. Sixty riders filled out
questionnaires, and half of the 26 women who responded
claimed that they used the service because they felt safer
than if walking or bicycling.
Although 1000 bus schedules were circulated to
libraries, dormitories, and University departments, both
Snape and Guth said more publicity was needed. Snape
added that the white bus "wasn't noticeable enough."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Leah Kaplan said: "I'm still
committed to the idoa — safety is still a very real issue on
campus." Snape, Guth, and Kaplan stressed the necessity of
"increased student input" and advocated continuation of
the shuttle bus service next fall.
