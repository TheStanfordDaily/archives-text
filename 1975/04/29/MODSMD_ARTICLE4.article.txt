# U.S. Evacuates Saigon; Embassy Closes Down
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — The United States
began the final evacuation of
Americans from Vietnam today and
officials said the U.S. Embassy would
close, ending 30 years of American
involvement in the Indochina war.
Buses began carrying Americans to
pickup points to await helicopters to
fly them to the U.S. Navy carriers
waiting off the coast.
High-ranking South Vietnamese
military and police officials, fearing
they were marked for death by the
communists, fled with them.
The government apparently

maintained a tight lid on the operation
until it was actually in progress.
Pentagon officials and others refused
to discuss reports in any way.
President Duong Van Minh
yesterday had ordered all Americans
assigned to the U.S. defense attache's
office to leave Saigon within 24 hours.
Minh announced his order in a brief
radio address. He gave no explanation,
but it appeared he was trying to meet
demands the Viet Cong laid down for
peace negotiations.
After the communist leaders
rejected the Saigon government's
appeal for a truce and peace talks, high
military sources said they apparently
had decided to settle for nothing less
than a complete military victory.
Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger, Gen. George Brown,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and other officials spent last night in
the Pentagon's national military
command center where they
monitored preparations for the
evacuation.
U.S. officials had hoped to avoid a
helicopter evacuation, and the

commitment of Marines for its
protection, but heavy communist
rocket and artillery attacks on Saigon's
Tan Son Nhut airport closed that
avenue of escape.
The helicopter evacuation was
regarded as a last resort because of the
risks involved from heavy communist
antiaircraft weapons, including
missiles, around Saigon and possibly
along the 45-mile route to the sea.
Two American Marines were
reported among those killed in the
shelling of the airfield and a U.S. Air
Force CI3O cargo plane there to fly
n>fugees out was destroyed.
U.S. sources said the two Marines
were part of the American Embassy
security staff, but had been detached
to the defense attache's office at Tan
Son Nhut to help evacuate refugees
and were on guard there when a shell
hit the compound.
South Vietnamese field reports said
Viet Cong units attacked six villages
10 miles north of Saigon and radio
contact was lost with three, indicating
the defenders' positions had been
overrun. Radio contact also was lost
with a ranger company northwest of
the capital, according to the reports.
By midmorning, rockets still were
falling occasionally into the air base
but most of the explosions heard in
Saigon were from bombs of South
Vietnamese warplanes attacking Viet
Cong rocket positions and suspected

troop concentrations.
When communist-led troops severed
the highway between Saigon and the
Bien Hoa air base 15 miles to the
north they left Saigon with Tan Son
Nhut as the only base for large planes.
Hours before the predawn
rocketing started, communist leaders
turned down an appeal by the new
Saigon government for a cease-fire and
peace talks.

had decided to settle for nothing less
than a complete military victory.
Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger, Gen. George Brown,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and other officials spent last night in
the Pentagon's national military
command center where they
monitored preparations for the
evacuation.
U.S. officials had hoped to avoid a
helicopter evacuation, and the

commitment of Marines for its
protection, but heavy communist
rocket and artillery attacks on Saigon's
Tan Son Nhut airport closed that
avenue of escape.
The helicopter evacuation was
regarded as a last resort because of the
risks involved from heavy communist
antiaircraft weapons, including
missiles, around Saigon and possibly
along the 45-mile route to the sea.
Two American Marines were
reported among those killed in the
shelling of the airfield and a U.S. Air
Force CI3O cargo plane there to fly
n>fugees out was destroyed.
U.S. sources said the two Marines
were part of the American Embassy
security staff, but had been detached
to the defense attache's office at Tan
Son Nhut to help evacuate refugees
and were on guard there when a shell
hit the compound.
South Vietnamese field reports said
Viet Cong units attacked six villages
10 miles north of Saigon and radio
contact was lost with three, indicating
the defenders' positions had been
overrun. Radio contact also was lost
with a ranger company northwest of
the capital, according to the reports.
By midmorning, rockets still were
falling occasionally into the air base
but most of the explosions heard in
Saigon were from bombs of South
Vietnamese warplanes attacking Viet
Cong rocket positions and suspected

troop concentrations.
When communist-led troops severed
the highway between Saigon and the
Bien Hoa air base 15 miles to the
north they left Saigon with Tan Son
Nhut as the only base for large planes.
Hours before the predawn
rocketing started, communist leaders
turned down an appeal by the new
Saigon government for a cease-fire and
peace talks.
SAIGON (AP) — The United States
began the final evacuation of
Americans from Vietnam today and
officials said the U.S. Embassy would
close, ending 30 years of American
involvement in the Indochina war.
Buses began carrying Americans to
pickup points to await helicopters to
fly them to the U.S. Navy carriers
waiting off the coast.
High-ranking South Vietnamese
military and police officials, fearing
they were marked for death by the
communists, fled with them.
The government apparently

maintained a tight lid on the operation
until it was actually in progress.
Pentagon officials and others refused
to discuss reports in any way.
President Duong Van Minh
yesterday had ordered all Americans
assigned to the U.S. defense attache's
office to leave Saigon within 24 hours.
Minh announced his order in a brief
radio address. He gave no explanation,
but it appeared he was trying to meet
demands the Viet Cong laid down for
peace negotiations.
After the communist leaders
rejected the Saigon government's
appeal for a truce and peace talks, high
military sources said they apparently
had decided to settle for nothing less
than a complete military victory.
