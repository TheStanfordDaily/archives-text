# Health Center Planned For Escondido Village
## 
### DEE BAER FARNETH 
Midpeninsula Health Service, Inc.
(MHS) is proceeding with plans to
open by September a community
owned and controlled health center in
Escondido Village.
"What we now need is input from
members of Escondido Village and the
community," says Tryn Clark, director
of the MHS planning effort.
Cowell Student Health Center
provides no services for student
dependents. At present, non-student
residents of Escondido must travel
outside of their immediate community
for basic health care.
The planned clinic will provide
comprehensive, scientific health care
to its subscribers, according to Clark.
Services will be administered at the
clinic as well as in patients' homes
whenever possible.
Organizational Stages
"There is plenty of expert help
available," says Clark. "Right now,
we're trying to get organized, get
people who live here to commit
themselves to this new experiment."
A meeting to discuss plans for the
clinic is scheduled for Wednesday, 8
p.m., in the Escondido Village Center.
MHS is currently applying for
tax-exempt status. The Escondido
Village clinic will be the organization's
pilot program for subscriber-owned
and controlled health cooperatives.
Planning Input
MHS grew out of a feasibility study
initiated by Immunology Prof. Halsted
Holman three years ago. Holman, then
director of the Joint Planning
Committee of the Medical School and
former Dean of Clinical Medicine,

asked community members to study
the feasibility of a family health
center. Health professionals, trade
union members, Escondido residents,
the Senior Citizens Coordinating
Committee and many others
responded.
Holman's research indicated a
serious need for a community Health
Maintenance Organization when their
recommendations were presented to
the medical school last year, MHS was
formed, and incorporation followed.
"The med school will be affiliated
with us, but will not act as a sponsor,"
says Clark. This is because MHS will be
member-controlled, he added.
Clark says she thinks that "in all
likelihood, it | the clinic) will be
located in the Village, serving the
population there, along with the senior
citizen community." There are
approximately 9000 senior citizens in
Palo Alto.
Low Cost Care
"We want to have a clinic. We want
it to be located in Kscondido Village
and provide low cost family care."
Clark stressed that home health care
delivery will be one of the hallmarks
of the clinic.
She is working with Pat Miller,
founder of Family Planning
Alternatives, in hopes that the clinic
will be able to provide home delivered
birth service.
"What we want is service that
would get away from hospitalization,"
Clark says. "|We want) to focus care
in the home whenever possible; to
provide support services and eliminate
unnecessary diagnostic testing and
medication."

union members, Escondido residents,
the Senior Citizens Coordinating
Committee and many others
responded.
Holman's research indicated a
serious need for a community Health
Maintenance Organization when their
recommendations were presented to
the medical school last year, MHS was
formed, and incorporation followed.
"The med school will be affiliated
with us, but will not act as a sponsor,"
says Clark. This is because MHS will be
member-controlled, he added.
Clark says she thinks that "in all
likelihood, it | the clinic) will be
located in the Village, serving the
population there, along with the senior
citizen community." There are
approximately 9000 senior citizens in
Palo Alto.
Low Cost Care
"We want to have a clinic. We want
it to be located in Kscondido Village
and provide low cost family care."
Clark stressed that home health care
delivery will be one of the hallmarks
of the clinic.
She is working with Pat Miller,
founder of Family Planning
Alternatives, in hopes that the clinic
will be able to provide home delivered
birth service.
"What we want is service that
would get away from hospitalization,"
Clark says. "|We want) to focus care
in the home whenever possible; to
provide support services and eliminate
unnecessary diagnostic testing and
medication."
Midpeninsula Health Service, Inc.
(MHS) is proceeding with plans to
open by September a community
owned and controlled health center in
Escondido Village.
"What we now need is input from
members of Escondido Village and the
community," says Tryn Clark, director
of the MHS planning effort.
Cowell Student Health Center
provides no services for student
dependents. At present, non-student
residents of Escondido must travel
outside of their immediate community
for basic health care.
The planned clinic will provide
comprehensive, scientific health care
to its subscribers, according to Clark.
Services will be administered at the
clinic as well as in patients' homes
whenever possible.
Organizational Stages
"There is plenty of expert help
available," says Clark. "Right now,
we're trying to get organized, get
people who live here to commit
themselves to this new experiment."
A meeting to discuss plans for the
clinic is scheduled for Wednesday, 8
p.m., in the Escondido Village Center.
MHS is currently applying for
tax-exempt status. The Escondido
Village clinic will be the organization's
pilot program for subscriber-owned
and controlled health cooperatives.
Planning Input
MHS grew out of a feasibility study
initiated by Immunology Prof. Halsted
Holman three years ago. Holman, then
director of the Joint Planning
Committee of the Medical School and
former Dean of Clinical Medicine,

asked community members to study
the feasibility of a family health
center. Health professionals, trade
union members, Escondido residents,
the Senior Citizens Coordinating
Committee and many others
responded.
