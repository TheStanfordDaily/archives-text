# "Everything We Touched Turned To Shit'
## U.S. Vietnam Policy Embitters Veterans 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
"1 can't be objective about them [the
Vietnamese orphansJ. They remind me of
the place, the problem we created, and it is
an unpleasant memory. Just like everything
we did there, hit them with our trucks,
tore up the rice fields with our tanks,
defoliated the jungle, fought battles in the
cities, uprooted thousands, inflated the
economy, screwcd their women and finally
imported their orphans — we always had
good intentions, trying to help, but
everything we touched turned to shit. "
This was one Stanford Vietnam
veteran's response to a questionnaire
circulated recently by the Daily, soliciting
the reaction of 20 veterans to U.S. policy
in Vietnam and Cambodia.
The questionnaires were sent through
the Veterans Benefits Office and names
were chosen randomly. Ten veterans
responded.
The vets were asked to comment on the
current situation in Indochina. Nine of the
10 welcomed the close of the war.
The 10th vet responded. "I certainly
cannot welcome the collapse of South
Vietnam. The ending of the
generation-long war will of course be
welcomed by all, but to call the ensuing
peace a liberation would be a travesty."'
The veteran said, "There might possibly
have been a viable nation of Vietnamese

who prefer the old order. These people
have been betrayed by the failure of their
own government to offer proper
leadership, and our well-intentioned
meddling in their affairs has proven
disastrous."
Richard Young, a graduate student in
applied mechanics, echoed this disapproval
cf U.S. intervention, saying, "From the
standpoint of American culpability,
Cambodia is the true tragedy. A nation
which probably could have rolled with the
political punches and suffered minimal
trauma became a sorry pawn in the
psychotic global chess of Richard Nixon
and Henry Kissinger."
"If Kissinger wants to find a message in
this debacle, it is not that America will
blithely abandon its allies, but rather that
America cannot, and eventually will not,
prop up a paper government forever,"
Young said.
All 10 vets agreed that the U.S.
exercised poor judgement in chosing to
intervene.
Waste Of Time?
Seven of the 10 veterans felt their
service to be a waste of time. As one vet
said, "Twenty-one months were taken
from my early 20s and neither 1, the U.S.
Army, nor the people of Southeast Asia
profited from my service."
However, the remaining three veterans

valued their experience. One felt that his
service was "a time of great personal
growth and maturing." Another believed
that it was simply his duty "to serve the
United States."
For the most part, the veterans were
opposed to sending more aid to Indochina.
"I firmly believe more aid wouldn't
make any difference, so why bother," said
one vet. "We can't send them guts,
determination and dedication and that's
what they lack."
Culture Breeds Corruption
"It's just too damn bad about those 200
million plus Vietnamese who are our
'friends,' " another vet said. "If they spent
half as much effort fighting the
communists as they have feathering their
own nests maybe they wouldn't be in the
trouble they're in."
The veterans agreed in claiming that the
Thieu government was corrupt and
repressive, but stressed that it was in
keeping with the culturp.
One vet said, "What the hell do you
expect? The average South Vietnamese
peasant did not want the South
Vietnamese government, the North
Vietnamese government, the Viet Cong, or
the U.S. He wanted to be left alone with
his family, his rice paddy, and his buffalo."
He emphasized that the culture "makes
Thieu not only possible but necessary.

That is the only government they have
known for thousands of years. They expect
the government to abuse its
responsibility ..."
In regard to the U.S. airlift of
Vietnamese orphans, seven of the 10 vets
were positive in their responses.
One vet, however, said, "Our culture
brought them no benefits while we were
there. What makes you think we will be
any more successful if we bring them here?
Why orphans?
"Nice emotional thing — children. What
about those Vietnamese officials who did
try? There is no justice. Let them go. We
have destroyed far too much to be offset
by a vast immigration movement."
"I am bitter because America wants to
elect a king, to go away from the polls each
year and forget their responsibility to
themselves to read, be informed, and
demand that the media and their
government serve them better," said one
discouraged veteran of the American
public.
"I am bitter that all those in Congress
who supported the war and later repented,
after it was obvious that there were serious
questions about the war. are still there. I
am bitter that my friends were shot up and
died in vain, not for South Vietnam but for
Main Street, U.S.A."
