# Fraternities: A Change With The Times
## 
### 
When the housing issue first began
to be discussed in February of 1974,
no one realized that the task of
remodeling the housing system would
take so long or be so difficult.
The Alpha Sigma Phi proposal
initially put forth an issue that was, up
to that point, ignored.
Looking at the old housing
situation objectively, an obvious
question arises: If there is a group of
specially treated men within the
overall University housing system,
then why can't there be a group of
correspondingly treated women? This
question has first been answered on
the basis of historical precedent, and
subsequently on the basis of present
demand.
Sorority System
A large number of female students
in 1944 felt that the then existing
sorority system had outlived its social
usefulness and should be summarily
disbanded. The girls complained that
the sororities placed an unfair, and
often unbearable, social pressure upon
them as rushees and as members.
President Donald Tresidder agreed,
and sororities ceased to exist at
Stanford. This has been the case
through the present day, despite the
recent efforts of a group of girls on
campus who would like to restore the
Pan-Hellenic society.
Unfortunately, their number is not
deemed significant enough, by the
powers that be, to warrant the
institution of any change along those
lines in the new housing system.
Title IX
The advent of Title IX in June,
made the moral obligation of "equal
treatment regardless of sex," a
requirement under law. As long as
women are treated in the same fashion
as men, the law is satisfied.
Applied to the housing situation,
women must have equal access to
residences comparable to the ones
enjoyed by men.
It does not mean that women must
have identical houses and social
programs.
Better Chance
Women have always been given a
better chance of living in the
University residence system than men.
This was to compensate for the
number of men living on campus in
fraternities.
Under the new system, every
undergraduate will have an equal
opportunity to live on campus. The
question that comes up here, is: Are
the men in fraternities to be treated
the same way as every other student?
The answer is both affirmative and
negative. This question is also one that
is explained on the bases of historical
precedent and present demand.
On-Campus Living
The answer is yes in the sense that
by being a member of a fraternity, you
cannot live on campus any longer than
dormitory or Row house residents.
The answer is also no, because only
the fraternities are allowed to select
their members, instead of having them
assigned through the draw. The
fraternities have retained their flexible
living agreement.
Fraternity residents are not
obligated to a year-long live-in
contract with their house. They may
move out at the end of any quarter,
instead of having to wait until the end
of spring quarter as in the dorms and
Row houses.
Draw Exemption
Historically, fraternities have
enjoyed the privileges of being exempt
from the housing draw and being able
to choose their own members. This is
primarily due to the fact that each

fraternity house was built by its
respective alumni corporation.
The University has spent little if
any of its own funds in constructing
fraternity houses. Instead, University
credit was used at various times by the
alumni groups, to obtain federal
assistance loans to finance
construction.
At one time, all fraternities were
responsible for the general upkeep of
their houses, and all house financial
matters were handled by the houses
themselves.
Increasingly more fraternity
business has been handled (for one
reason or another) by the University,

but the houses have retained their
privileges.
Complaints
From time to time, there have been
complaints from University parvenus
and student discontents, charging that
fraternities don't deserve any special
privileges.
These charges have usually brought
about some incremental changes in the
fraternity system, which in turn,
resulted in a demurring reaffirmation
of support for the system by the
University.
In 1961, President J.E. Wallace
Sterling authored a letter which
strongly supported the fraternity
residence construction program.
Since that time, other fraternities
have been renovated at considerable
expense to the University.
No Plot '
These renovations were done with
the intent of using the houses for
University housing if the fraternity
should for any reason cease to exist at
some future date.
It is a mistake for any fraternity
member or alumnus to conclude that
the University has plotted the demise
of the fraternity system, because it
had the renovations done with the
possibility of coed living in mind.
The Board of Trustees has recently
allayed the fraternities' recurring
mistrust of the University by approving
a housing policy that preserves and
protects the fraternity system.
Current Interest
Undoubtedly, one of the reasons
for this action is the current interest in

the system. According to the Director
of Row Houses and Fraternities,
Norman Robinson, there are 668
members in the 550 space fraternity
system.
Pledge classes have been
considerably larger the last two years
than they have been since 1965.
The reason for this popularity
seems to be that the Stanford
fraternities do not fit the stereotype of
"the frat."
The image of fraternities has
changed considerably since the 1968
Study of Education at Stanford, which
charged that fraternities were
"anti-intellectual" and to some degree
"racist."
The fraternities function more to
provide for the wants and needs of
present members than they do to
preserve remnants of the past.
Fraternity alumni are playing more
of a complementary, rather than a
restrictive, role in the functioning of
their houses.
As long as the houses continue to
change themselves to accommodate
the new members, their existence is
virtually guaranteed.
System A Benefit
Fraternity members have fought to
preserve their system mainly because
they believe it is something other
students will want to be part of, and
can continually benefit from.
If the future demand for
fraternities declines, so in turn will
the number of fraternities. There is,
indeed, no reason to retain a system
that the students do not want.
From all indications of rush this
year, it looks as if the fraternities are
enjoying the enthusiastic support of
the students.
Housing Shortage
Despite the fact that the new
housing plan has as one of its stated
aims to deal with all the
undergraduates requesting on-campus
housing with equity, it fails to address
the basic problem â€” the need for more
housing.
Admittedly, the University is not in
a financial position to begin large scale
construction of student residences.
The University can, however, assign
housing a higher priority in
fund-raising efforts.
The reluctance of University
officials to do this is,in part, due to an
uncertain future demand for
on-campus housing.
Assessing Demand
Assessing present demand is not
easy, and when a consensus is reached,
it is invariably protested by some
group or other. For many reasons,
there is,and will continue to be, a large
element of uncertainty in the future
housing plans of the University.

Michael Nilsson

It has been my experience in
dealing with the University officials
concerned with student housing, that
they are people who try hard
(sometimes too hard) to satisfy as
many people as possible.
To satisfy everyone is a given
impossibility. Fraternities have had to
give up their draw exempt status under
the new housing system in order to
help satisfy the needs of the general
student body.
They are not necessarily afraid of
this change to meet the demands of
the times. What they and others are
afraid of is an eventual change that
would deny a substantial number of
students the freedom of choice in a
residence system. If something is not
done about the present shortage of
housing spaces, this might very well
come about.
