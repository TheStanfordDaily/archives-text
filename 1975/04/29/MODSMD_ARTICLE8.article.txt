# Students Can Influence Policy
## 
### 
In what has been a whirlwind year
for the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) Subcommittee on
Residents, I was delighted to discover
that I would be given the opportunity
to wax eloquent in the Daily about the
incredibly broad topic of housing.
The first thing that struck me while
sifting my thoughts was that
Stanford's residence system is
incredibly complex. This complexity
has led to many misunderstandings of
the system, and these
misunderstandings have in turn led to
a great deal of hostility towards the

Housing Office.
One of the more prevalent
misunderstandings I have encountered
this year is a notion that all housing
decisions are made before any student
input is heard. Numerous students
have approached me with the
question, "Do you [the
subcommittee] really think you can
influence housing policy — after all,
aren't all decisions made before the
subcommittee even considers the
issue(s)?"
It is true that the Housing Office
often operates under great time

pressure, but this constraint does not
necessarily preclude student input.
On the contrary, the COSS
Subcommittee (which is composed of
a sizable student majority) has been
asked by Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton for its
recommendations on a variety of
topics such as how to construct an
equitable housing allocation system,
where to locate the two new
residential programs and how to
alleviate hostilities in Florence Moore
Hall due to construction.
In all of these cases the
subcommittee was eventually able to
make a recommendation after long
hours of discussion and
information-gathering.
The point is, I think, that six
students were actively involved in the
decision-making process. Moreover, all
of the students on the subcommittee
were selected by the ASSU
Nominations Committee, dispelling
any possibilities of a group being
handpicked by the administration.
I doubt seriously if any members of
the subcommittee would assert that
our proceedings have been
mistake-proof. I do feel, however, that
all members of the subcommittee
would agree that we have attempted to
make recommendations which are in
the best interests of the entire student
body.
The subcommittee has not favored
any particular faction or minority of
the student body, but rather has
worked for a better housing system for
all students.
I think it is important to realize
that we are dealing with a situation
where housing is in great demand but
limited supply. Thus, any allocation of
this scarce resource which does not
favor a particular group will naturally
come under criticism from that group.
One answer, of course, is to build
enough housing to satisfy all students
— the Flo Mo addition and the three
new Row houses are steps in the right
direction.
For the present, however, I'm
afraid students here will be facing a
housing shortage.
I would encourage anyone who has
suggestions as to how we can improve
its functions to submit them to the
subcommittee. In 'addition, four
student at-large positions must be
filled for next year's subcommittee —
anyone who has an interest in
improving Stanford's housing system
ought to seriously consider an
application to the COSS
Subcommittee on Residences.


You know it's a bad quarter when you thought you had on-campus
housing, but. . .
