# Residential Environments And Education
## 
### 
The Stanford undergraduate
residence program surely has its share
of problems, some quite serious and
most very visible.
Yet not everyone agrees on exactly
what the problems are and even fewer
agree on the solutions. Because so
much has already been written about
the housing shortage and because
copies of the staff report
Undergraduate Housing Needs at
Stanford, 1974-1984 are available in
Meyer Library, I will not discuss that
issue here.
Instead, I would like to make some

general comments on the University's
commitment to a diversity of
undergraduate residence options under
the broad umbrella referred to as
residential education and on the
federal structure of the Stanford
residence program.
Broad Environment
The term residential education as it
is used at Stanford now should not be
mistaken for a narrow notion of
pumping formal instruction into every
cranny of student life in University
residences.
Rather it refers to a broad and basic

objective of providing a residential
environment to complement and
supplement undergraduate education,
the core of which will always remain
the formal curriculum. It is a
recognition that, in the very term
University residences, University
should be an operative word.
The commitment to a diverse set of
residence options does not mean that
all housing programs desired by some
students would be implemented even
if sufficient space were available.
The system is broad enough to
encompass a Columbae and a Kappa
Alpha, but there are several examples
in recent years of programs which are
not acceptable
Desirable Housing
There is also a problem of having to
choose between desirable types of
housing. While there is general
agreement on the desirability of a
diverse residence program, there is no
agreed upon formula for deciding just
what the mix should be.
The Committee on Services to
Students Subcommittee on Residences
has recognized this problem and is
working on a set of criteria for
evaluation of houses.
The 66 undergraduate residences
include wide variations in physical
accommodations, in staffing, in
housekeeping and food preparation
arrangements, and the objectives of
individual house programs.
A high degree of operational
independence is expected of each
residence, and indeed I am acutely
aware of the spirited independence of
most residences on campus. It is a
quality which we seek to foster.
Operational Independence
This operational independence is an
essential element in the basic
decentralized operation of Stanford
residences.
The students, faculty and staff in
each residence determine what
happens there.
In the ritual incantations about the
lack of student power and influence in
decision-making, it is almost always
neatly forgotten that students do, in
fact, make most of the operational
decisions in the residences. And it
should, of course, be that way.
Dynamic System
The University system is also a
dynamic one. Modifications and
reallocation of resources are essential
if the vitality of Stanford residences is
to continue.
Decisions to change a house or to
reallocate resources are not easy ones,

Lorry Horton

nor are they undertaken lightly.
The lack of neatness or clarity in
decision-making about residences
weighs heavily on all those involved in
the process — students, staff and
faculty — and it is not likely to
improve markedly.
The nature of the judgments
required will continue to be
controversial, and the time allotted for
making those judgments will probably
continue to be inadequate. Surely
mistakes will be made.
Let us — and I mean all of those
concerned with residences — make the
best decisions we can and learn from
what we do.

affairs
The Stanford undergraduate
residence program surely has its share
of problems, some quite serious and
most very visible.
Yet not everyone agrees on exactly
what the problems are and even fewer
agree on the solutions. Because so
much has already been written about
the housing shortage and because
copies of the staff report
Undergraduate Housing Needs at
Stanford, 1974-1984 are available in
Meyer Library, I will not discuss that
issue here.
Instead, I would like to make some

general comments on the University's
commitment to a diversity of
undergraduate residence options under
the broad umbrella referred to as
residential education and on the
federal structure of the Stanford
residence program.
Broad Environment
The term residential education as it
is used at Stanford now should not be
mistaken for a narrow notion of
pumping formal instruction into every
cranny of student life in University
residences.
Rather it refers to a broad and basic

objective of providing a residential
environment to complement and
supplement undergraduate education,
the core of which will always remain
the formal curriculum. It is a
recognition that, in the very term
University residences, University
should be an operative word.
The commitment to a diverse set of
residence options does not mean that
all housing programs desired by some
students would be implemented even
if sufficient space were available.
The system is broad enough to
encompass a Columbae and a Kappa
Alpha, but there are several examples
in recent years of programs which are
not acceptable
Desirable Housing
There is also a problem of having to
choose between desirable types of
housing. While there is general
agreement on the desirability of a
diverse residence program, there is no
agreed upon formula for deciding just
what the mix should be.
The Committee on Services to
Students Subcommittee on Residences
has recognized this problem and is
working on a set of criteria for
evaluation of houses.
The 66 undergraduate residences
include wide variations in physical
accommodations, in staffing, in
housekeeping and food preparation
arrangements, and the objectives of
individual house programs.
A high degree of operational
independence is expected of each
residence, and indeed I am acutely
aware of the spirited independence of
most residences on campus. It is a
quality which we seek to foster.
Operational Independence
This operational independence is an
essential element in the basic
decentralized operation of Stanford
residences.
The students, faculty and staff in
each residence determine what
happens there.
In the ritual incantations about the
lack of student power and influence in
decision-making, it is almost always
neatly forgotten that students do, in
fact, make most of the operational
decisions in the residences. And it
should, of course, be that way.
Dynamic System
The University system is also a
dynamic one. Modifications and
reallocation of resources are essential
if the vitality of Stanford residences is
to continue.
Decisions to change a house or to
reallocate resources are not easy ones,

Lorry Horton

nor are they undertaken lightly.
The lack of neatness or clarity in
decision-making about residences
weighs heavily on all those involved in
the process — students, staff and
faculty — and it is not likely to
improve markedly.
The nature of the judgments
required will continue to be
controversial, and the time allotted for
making those judgments will probably
continue to be inadequate. Surely
mistakes will be made.
Let us — and I mean all of those
concerned with residences — make the
best decisions we can and learn from
what we do.
