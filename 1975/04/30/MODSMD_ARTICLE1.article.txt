# The 						War Is Over: Saigon Surrenders

SAIGON (AP) — I The Saigon government
surrendered unconditionally to the
Viet Cong, ending 30 years of
warfare.
Columns of South Vietnamese
troops pulled out of their defensive
positions in the city and marched to
central points to turn in their
weapons.
President Duong Van Minh
announced the surrender in a
five-minute broadcast to the city and
the Viet Cong. He spoke a few hours

after an armada of U.S. Marine
helicopters completed the emergency
evacuation of 1000 Americans and
thousands of Vietnamese from the
besieged capital.
Minh, a retired general and
neutralist, was named president
Monday in a desperate and
unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a
peace with the communist leaders.
In a five-minute radio address, Minh
said "The Republic of Vietnam policy
is the policy of peace and
reconciliation, aimed at saving the
blood of our people. I ask all
servicemen to stop firing and stay

where you are. I also demand that
soldiers of the Provisional
Revolutionary Government [Viet
Cong) stop firing and stay in place."
In Washington, White House
Deputy Press Secretary John Hushen
said when asked for comment on
Minh's announcement: "There will be
no statement forthcoming from the
White House tonight."
One high-ranking official said he
got his first word from a reporter.
The United States completed the
month-long evacuation of more than
6000 Americans and about 56,000
South Vietnamese from Saigon
yesterday as President Ford called on
the nation "to close ranks, to avoid
recrimination about the past."
When word was flashed to the
White House that Ambassador Graham
Martin and the last evacuees had been
airlifted from South Vietnam, Ford
declared: "This action closes a chapter
in the American experience."
Some 6500 were rescued on the last
day. Ford said it was now time "to
look ahead to the many goals we share
and to work together on the great
tasks that remain to be accomplished."
Delays blamed on bad weather,
pilot fatigue and difficult helicopter
landings stretched out the day's

withdrawal, which marked the end of
U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war
— a war that Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger acknowledged did not meet
U.S. objectives.
But, sharing the President's
sentiments, Kissinger said, "It is a time
to heal wounds, to look to our
international obligations and to
remember that peace and progress in
the world has depended importantly
on American commitment and
American conviction ..."
Two U.S. marine pilots were lost in
the final effort when their helicopter
fell into the South China Sea.
White House Press Secretary Ron
Nessen said the operation was
extended several hours because "a lot
more Vietnamese were taken out than

had been planned."
In a briefing, Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger rejected suggestions
that Ambassador Martin resisted this
last withdrawal. "He was in a very
difficult position," Kissinger said, "he
felt a moral obligation to the people
with whom he was associated.
"He attempted to save as many
people as possible. That's not the
worst fault a man can have."
Kissinger said the United States
moved deliberately over the last few
weeks to avoid panic among the local
population and to save many of the
5000 to 8000 South Vietnamese
thought to be in a "high risk" category
because of their known opposition to
Hanoi and the Viet Cong.
At the same time, Kissinger

credited the Soviet Union with
providing "some help" in the
evacuation effort. He was not specific,
saying the degree would have to be
assessed later.
Meanwhile, congressional leaders
indicated that with the evacuation
complete, plans to provide
congressional authorization for the use
of American troops in the evacuation
may be dropped.
They added that a pending
authorization of humanitarian aid to
South Vietnam could also be cut to
whatever is needed to pay for
evacuation of South Vietnamese and
other foreign nationals to the United
States.
The first group of South
Vietnamese refugees destined for

temporary homes on military bases in
California, Arkansas and Florida
arrived on the West Coast from Guam
on Tuesday.
The refugees arriving at Norton Air
Force Base and El Toro Marine Corps
Air Station were the first of up to
20,000 who will be housed at Camp
Pendleton, Calif. Two other military
bases — Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., and
Ft. Chafee, Ark. — also are prepared
for up to 20,000 refugees each.
Other refugees, many of them
relatives of Americans or Vietnamese
married to Americans, have come to
the United States in recent weeks, but
yesterday's group marked the
beginning of the mass arrivals expected
in the next few days.
