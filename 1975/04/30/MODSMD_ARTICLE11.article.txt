# Activism At Brown Produces Results
## 
### Stephen Carter 
In one installment of the popular comic
strip "Doonesbury" some years ago,
"Megaphone" Mark Slackmeyer, a clumsy
but dedicated revolutionary, took over the
office of the president at Yale.
CBS sent cameras to record the
occupation, and Mark began broadcasting
live. "The president has agreed to meet me
here and negotiate my demands, and I think I
hear him coming in now," he begins. Two
heavily armed police officers enter. Turning
back to the camera, Mark explains, "This
program is temporarily cancelled due to a
breach of faith."
Although humorous, this cartoon for
many lypified the student strife of the late
1960s and early 19705. Peaceful
demonstrations always seemed to erupt into
violence, and violent ones were always put
down forcefully.
Of course, most of the current
undergraduates — myself included — were
still in high school at the time of the campus
wars. But we still remember such events as
the murders at Kent State five years ago this
week, and the killings at Jackson State
shortly thereafter.
A New Attitude?
With such memories of violence and
tragedy in the wake of campus activism, one
can only be relieved — or perhaps, enthused—
with what appears to be a new attitude
toward campus activists and radicals.
When a group of black and other Third
World students took over the administration
building at Brown University late last week,
the school officials immediately renounced
any use of force to quell the disturbance.
In fact, all in all, the occupation seemed
rather a lark — a small comedy well acted by
all involved.
Thursday morning, the Third World

Coalition began demonstrating outside
University Hall. A student strike at the
university had just ended, and the coalition
was clearly dissatisifed with the results. The
Student Coalition, which had organized the
four-day boycott of classes, had become
hopelessly splintered and indecisive.
Minority students, left out of the
settlement, decided to take action. At about
8 a.m. EDT Thursday, 36 black, two Latin
American and one Asian-American student
entered the building.

Hostages By Choice
Somehow, the University had caught wind
of the coming occupation, and managed in a
short time to transfer nearly all essential
personnel and equipment to another
building. Two administrators, whom some
news reports incorrectly said had been locked
in the building, remained in their offices by
choice.
A crowd of supporters of all races
gathered outside the building, picketing
peacefully. President Donald Hornig, through
a spokesman, piously rejected the use of
force, and emphasized the school's
commitment to resolve the students'
grievances.
Again, all concerned played their parts
well, classes continued and the operations of
the university — with the exception of

advance registration for autumn — went
ahead almost undisturbed. Except, of course,
that 39 students, two administrators and a
few newsmen still occupied University Hall,
awaiting action on 21 student demands.
A Colorful Group
Students within the building studied,
watched television, ate and slept, and let
their negotiators work. One black and one
chicano student negotiated for the students
— one WASP and one Jew for the university
so that, as one Brown Daily Herald reporter
laughed, "They made a colorful group."
Some tense moments came Friday, when a
group of fraternity men decided the
occupation had gone on long enough, and
announced they would evict the
demonstrators unless they vacated the
building by early evening. Similar rumors had
been flying for some time, but these seemed
backed by some substance.
However, a committee of faculty
members, unrelated to the negotiations but
intent on preventing violence, immediately
took action. Along with several
administrators, the faculty members staged
an "occupation" of their own — on the green
outside of the building.
There was no further talk of violence, and
the negotiators announced a settlement later
that night. The university really didn't give
much, but Brown's Third World community
nevertheless gained much.
Such a return to student activism is a
welcome response to what seems to be a
growing attitude on the part of officials that
students will not act. And such a response by
Brown shows just how useful, in a time of
changed attitudes, such activism can be.
