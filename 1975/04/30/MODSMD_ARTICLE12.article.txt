# Moynihan Doesn't Deserve Invitation
## 
### 
It has been widely reported
that 12 Anthropology
Department faculty members, as
well as some 30 other faculty
members, have expressed concern
about the choice of Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as commencement
speaker.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs, in an
April 4 Daily column, singled out
for chastisement a letter written
by several anthropology
professors protesting Moynihan's
selection.
Rosenzweig considers our
attempts at communication mere
"noises" and demands of us a
"standard of discourse"
more appropriate for a journal
article than a letter of protest.
Our letter was addressed to
senior class presidents. It merely
expressed regret about the

selection, suggested that future
committees contain faculty
representation and tried to spell
out the reasons why Moynihan's
selection offended blacks and
caused anthropologists regret.
Incidentally, no kind of action
was suggested other than measures
to prevent unhappy choices of
this type from being made in the
future. Stanford is now a
multi-ethnic, multi-racial
university and the sensitivities of
ethnic parents and students
should be taken into account.
Wrongful Legitimacy
One point made by our letter
was that Moynihan should not be
presented as a leading social
scientist, because he really isn't
one. Another objection was to
Stanford giving legitimacy to his
policy positions in regard to black
people.

Commencement speakers are a
part of the University's public
relations strategy and a speaker
also inevitably gains credibility
from having been honored by
Stanford.
Current Biography noted, in
1965, that the one and only thing,
at the time, that gave Moynihan's
career any national significance
was the publication of "The
Moynihan Report" â€” The Negro
Family: A Case For National
Action. That, and the 1970
"benign neglect" memorandum,
are, perhaps, still the actions
generally associated with his
name.
We cited The Negro Family as
an example of "bad scholarship,"
partly, because it involved misuse
of statistics. On the basis of one
lone graph he suggested that even
if the unemployment problem
were solved for blacks, they
would probably not be able to
improve their condition.
Moynihan has said that he
considers this the most important
insight in his study! (See The
Politics of a Guaranteed Income,
p. 328). This is only one example
of overgeneralizing from his
statistics to support policy
positions.
However, more serious from an
anthropological perspective, The
Negro Family gave spurious
legitimacy to the idea that the
black community is no more than
what Moynihan calls a "tangle of
pathology," that Afro-Americans
do not have any meaningful
subculture. Anthropologist C.A.
Valentine devotes considerable
space to a criticism of this
Moynihan thesis in Culture of
Poverty: Critique and
Counterproposals.
Responsibility Needed
Our criticisms arise not from
pique over "poaching" but from
the belief that "experts" should
have knowledge and empathy as
well as "scope of responsibility."
The Negro Family diverted
attention from a concentrated
attack upon unemployment and
racism into a debate about the
effect of the family on black
achievement. (See Lee Rainwater
and William L. Yancey, The
Moynihan Report and the Politics
of Controversy 11967 | especially
critiques by educator Christopher
Jencks, psychologist William

Drake, ef a/.

Ryan, and sociologist Hylan
Lewis.) The one clear
recommendation made in The
Negro Family (pp. 86-89 in
Rainwater and Yancey) is a
suggestion that young blacks
would be well-served by stepping
up their recruitment into the
army which would remove them
from those damaging matriarchal
families and provide more
equality of opportunity.
Whether "deplorable" is too
strong a word for these and other
Moynihan "recommendations"
may depend upon one's attitude
toward "solutions" like this, and
toward Community Action
Programs which he deplored. (See
his Maximum Feasible
Misunderstanding- Community
Action in the War on Poverty.)
