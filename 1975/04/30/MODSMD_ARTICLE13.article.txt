This is a response to David
Giber and John PercivaPs letter
(Daily, April 2.8) condemning the
Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) celebration of the
liberation of Cambodia. 1
personally participated in the
celebration and I believe that
there are good reasons for it.
In 1963, former Prime Minister
Sihanouk declared the United
States Cambodia's number one
enemy, after seeing the torment
that the U.S. brought to Vietnam.
Soon after the overthrow of
Sihanouk in 1970, which had the
familiar markings of / CIA
involvement, the U.S. invaded
Cambodia and brought only death
and destruction to a formerly
peaceful country.
Today, the Cambodians are rid
of these U.S. activities which have
ravaged their land and killed their
people. The U.S. had nothing to
offer the people of Cambodia who
are now able to live, free of fear
of U.S. mass destruction.
As an American citizen and a
part of the system which brought
terrible disaster to Cambodia, 1
must express my deepest regrets
for the lives that were lost, both
Cambodian and American. But
mourning over past deaths does
not allow us to appreciate the
present and the future which will
be free of this vicious, genocidal
war.
As a human being, I.feel it is
right to celebrate the freeing of
Cambodia from the death grip of
U.S. forces. The Cambodian
people are now able to enjoy life
in their own terms, and life is
something to celebrate.

Once again, for the fourth time
in almost as many days, the Daily
has reported whatever it wished to
report, and then attributed it to
me.
I did not accuse the Dan
Poston slate of misrepresenting
the fact that I told them I thought
the spending limit was $200 per
slate. I did tell it that was
what I interpreted the by-laws to
mean. My concern was with the
fact that its posters claim that
he was told his slate was
"technically disqualified." That is
not the case. What he was told by
me was that someone had
questioned the interpretation of
the spending limit and that the
issue would be considered by the
ASSU Senate.
Two other statements that I do
not believe are accurate which
Poston used on his literature were
the fact that the repeat of the
election would cost $400. It is
expected to cost $75, quite a bit
lower than what he claims.
The other statement was that
when the subject of his
disqualification went to the
senate, it was done without
knowledge on his part. In fact, as
soon as the subject came up
Monday afternoon, before the
senate meeting 1 called him and
informed him personally of the
situation.

ASSU Senate.
Two other statements that I do
not believe are accurate which
Poston used on his literature were
the fact that the repeat of the
election would cost $400. It is
expected to cost $75, quite a bit
lower than what he claims.
The other statement was that
when the subject of his
disqualification went to the
senate, it was done without
knowledge on his part. In fact, as
soon as the subject came up
Monday afternoon, before the
senate meeting 1 called him and
informed him personally of the
situation.

This is a response to David
Giber and John PercivaPs letter
(Daily, April 2.8) condemning the
Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) celebration of the
liberation of Cambodia. 1
personally participated in the
celebration and I believe that
there are good reasons for it.
In 1963, former Prime Minister
Sihanouk declared the United
States Cambodia's number one
enemy, after seeing the torment
that the U.S. brought to Vietnam.
Soon after the overthrow of
Sihanouk in 1970, which had the
familiar markings of / CIA
involvement, the U.S. invaded
Cambodia and brought only death
and destruction to a formerly
peaceful country.
Today, the Cambodians are rid
of these U.S. activities which have
ravaged their land and killed their
people. The U.S. had nothing to
offer the people of Cambodia who
are now able to live, free of fear
of U.S. mass destruction.
As an American citizen and a
part of the system which brought
terrible disaster to Cambodia, 1
must express my deepest regrets
for the lives that were lost, both
Cambodian and American. But
mourning over past deaths does
not allow us to appreciate the
present and the future which will
be free of this vicious, genocidal
war.
As a human being, I.feel it is
right to celebrate the freeing of
Cambodia from the death grip of
U.S. forces. The Cambodian
people are now able to enjoy life
in their own terms, and life is
something to celebrate.

Once again, for the fourth time
in almost as many days, the Daily
has reported whatever it wished to
report, and then attributed it to
me.
I did not accuse the Dan
Poston slate of misrepresenting
the fact that I told them I thought
the spending limit was $200 per
slate. I did tell it that was
what I interpreted the by-laws to
mean. My concern was with the
fact that its posters claim that
he was told his slate was
"technically disqualified." That is
not the case. What he was told by
me was that someone had
questioned the interpretation of
the spending limit and that the
issue would be considered by the
ASSU Senate.
