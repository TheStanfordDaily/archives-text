# Americans Flee Saigon In Dying Moments Of War
## 
### GEORGE ESPER Associated Press Writer 
SAIGON — Dodging random
shots fired by bitter South Vietnamese
soldiers and fighting off desperate
civilians, Americans fled from Saigon
yesterday in an armada of 81
helicopters guarded by 800 Marines.
The final evacuation of nearly 900
Americans and thousands of
Vietnamese began shortly before noon
from the roof of the fortress-like U.S.
Embassy as Communist-led troops
pressed on Saigon.
America's 30-year involvement in
Vietnam ended in tears, panic, looting
and rage.
Embittered Saigon soldiers, felling
betrayed by America's withdrawal,
fired shots at buses carrying evacuees
to the embassy and at the helicopters
skimming overhead.
Climbing Walls
Thousands of civilians, fearing they
would be killed by the Viet Cong
victors, tried toclawtheir way over the
10-foot-high wall surrounding the
gleaming white embassy building and
its gardens.
Marines and U.S. civilians used
pistol and rifle butts to hammer their
fingers, but scores got over and raced
with the Americans for the helicopter
pad on the top of the four-story
embassy.
Some frantic civilians jumped from
the wall and landed in barbed wire
below. A middle-aged man and some
women were bleeding as they struggled
against the steel barbs.
Mothers holding up their children
wept as they pleaded with Americans
to take the youngsters with them.
Looting
Across the street, men and boys
began stripping the abandoned U.S.
vehicles. Mobs stormed into
apartments vacated by the Americans
and carried out armloads of loot.
Pilots of the South Vietnamese air
force, Saigon's staunchest
anti-Communist service, flew more
than 70 air force cargo and attack
planes to American-controlled Utapao
air base in neighboring Thailand. They
carried more than 2000 refugees.
Scores of other South Vietnamese
helicopter pilots filled their craft with
military men and civilians and headed
out to sea, searching for the carriers of
the U.S. 7th Fleet.
Associated Press reporter Arnold
Zeitlin, aboard the command ship
U.S.S. Blue Ridge, said seven
Vietnamese helicopters arrived
unexpectedly and made a dash for the
helipad at the rear of the vessel.
Helicopters Collide
One pilot dropped his chopper on
the whirling blades of another that had

just landed, and chunks of metal
ripped through the air, Zeitlin
reported. The top helicopter with its
load of women and children nearly
toppled into the sea, but they were
rescued and there were no injuries.
As other Vietnamese helicopters
landed, their passengers were pulled
free, U.S. sailors ripped the doors off
the craft to make them sink and the
pilots then jettisoned them in the sea
to make room for other arrivals
circling overhead. Two small craft
rescued the swimming pilots.
U.S. sailors heaved the two
damaged choppers overboard to clear
the landing pad. For the Vietnamese it
was a last-ditch chance to survive.
The American evacuation was
reported orderly, although it was
delayed several times because of
weather and pilot fatigue.
Roof Tops
The choppers picked up the
evacuees from the roof of the
American Embassy, the embassy
parking lot, and the tops of onetime
American billets.
Wednesday morning (Saigon time),
21 hours after it had started, the airlift
ended when a big Marine helicopter
swooped down onto the embassy roof
and plucked out a number of Marines
stranded there overnight as the rear
guard for the evacuation.
They fired a red smoke grenade to
guide the CH46 helicopter in and as it
touched down they scrambled aboard
and were airbound within four
minutes. Washington spokesmen said
there were 11 in the group.
Hundreds of civilians swarmed into
the compound and onto the roof after
the Marines had left. On the roof of a
nearby building that had also served as
an emergency helipad several hundred
civilians huddled together, hoping
there would be more choppers to carry
them away.
Abandoned Vehicles
Despite a 24-hour curfew, there was
moderate traffic in the city's streets.
There also were abandoned U.S.
Embassy vehicles that had been taken
over by Vietnamese and driven around
until they ran out of gas.
Marine pilots who arrived aboard
the U.S.S. Blue Ridge offshore said
they took fire flying over Saigon.
Four American Marines died during
the evacuation. Two were killed in the
early morning bombardment of
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport as they
were standing guard at the U.S.
defense attache's office and a rocket
hit the compound. The other two died
during the evacuation when their
helicopter plunged into the South
China Sea.
Officials in Washington reported

that 6400 persons had been evacuated
in the 13-hour operation, with U.S.
Ambassador Graham Martin on the
last lift of 19 helicopters. They were
carried by choppers to aircraft carriers
standing off the coast.
Tht massive shelling of Tan Son
Nhut air base and an order by South
Vietnamese President Duong Van
Minh lor the American defense attache
and his staff to get out led to President
Ford order to remove all Americans,
with only a handful of newsmen and
relief workers remaining voluntarily.
A !iandful of newsmen passed up
the final evacuation to report the
dramatic closing events of the war
many already had risked their lives to
cover.
Do ens of others joined the
delico;>ter evacuation. There was no
repori of injuries among the evacuated
newsmen.
Three Associated Press reporters
with a combined experience of nearly
two decades in Indochina volunteered
to remain.
Other AP staffers and members of
other news organizations had been
pulled out earlier to reduce the risks of
the last-minute withdrawal, expected
to be difficult at best.

A spokesman for United Press
International said all of its staff was
seeking evacuation. The last seven UPI
men driving to the U.S. embassy were
twice halted by crowds.
The ignition wires of their car were
ripped out, and the staffers headed for
the U.S. embassy on foot. Two, Bert
Okuley and Kenneth Englade,
managed with the help of American
marines to get into the embassy
compound and boarded helicopters.
UPI said its five remaining staffers
apparently remained in Saigon. The\
are Asian manager Leon Daniel. Alan
Dawson, Paul Vogle, Hugh Vanes and
Charles Huntley.
NBC News said seven American
staffers and two French nationals had
been removed and that one man had
stayed behind. He was not identified
out of fear for his personal safety,
NBC said.
CBS in New York reported nine of
its staffers were withdrawn and that a
British school teacher, Eric Cavaliero,
would try to handle news for them in
Saigon.
ABC said its last two American
staffers withdrew but that a Canadian
woman it declined to identify had
remained behind.

reported. The top helicopter with its
load of women and children nearly
toppled into the sea, but they were
rescued and there were no injuries.
As other Vietnamese helicopters
landed, their passengers were pulled
free, U.S. sailors ripped the doors off
the craft to make them sink and the
pilots then jettisoned them in the sea
to make room for other arrivals
circling overhead. Two small craft
rescued the swimming pilots.
U.S. sailors heaved the two
damaged choppers overboard to clear
the landing pad. For the Vietnamese it
was a last-ditch chance to survive.
The American evacuation was
reported orderly, although it was
delayed several times because of
weather and pilot fatigue.
Roof Tops
The choppers picked up the
evacuees from the roof of the
American Embassy, the embassy
parking lot, and the tops of onetime
American billets.
Wednesday morning (Saigon time),
21 hours after it had started, the airlift
ended when a big Marine helicopter
swooped down onto the embassy roof
and plucked out a number of Marines
stranded there overnight as the rear
guard for the evacuation.
They fired a red smoke grenade to
guide the CH46 helicopter in and as it
touched down they scrambled aboard
and were airbound within four
minutes. Washington spokesmen said
there were 11 in the group.
Hundreds of civilians swarmed into
the compound and onto the roof after
the Marines had left. On the roof of a
nearby building that had also served as
an emergency helipad several hundred
civilians huddled together, hoping
there would be more choppers to carry
them away.
Abandoned Vehicles
Despite a 24-hour curfew, there was
moderate traffic in the city's streets.
There also were abandoned U.S.
Embassy vehicles that had been taken
over by Vietnamese and driven around
until they ran out of gas.
Marine pilots who arrived aboard
the U.S.S. Blue Ridge offshore said
they took fire flying over Saigon.
Four American Marines died during
the evacuation. Two were killed in the
early morning bombardment of
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport as they
were standing guard at the U.S.
defense attache's office and a rocket
hit the compound. The other two died
during the evacuation when their
helicopter plunged into the South
China Sea.
Officials in Washington reported

that 6400 persons had been evacuated
in the 13-hour operation, with U.S.
Ambassador Graham Martin on the
last lift of 19 helicopters. They were
carried by choppers to aircraft carriers
standing off the coast.
Tht massive shelling of Tan Son
Nhut air base and an order by South
Vietnamese President Duong Van
Minh lor the American defense attache
and his staff to get out led to President
Ford order to remove all Americans,
with only a handful of newsmen and
relief workers remaining voluntarily.
A !iandful of newsmen passed up
the final evacuation to report the
dramatic closing events of the war
many already had risked their lives to
cover.
Do ens of others joined the
delico;>ter evacuation. There was no
repori of injuries among the evacuated
newsmen.
Three Associated Press reporters
with a combined experience of nearly
two decades in Indochina volunteered
to remain.
Other AP staffers and members of
other news organizations had been
pulled out earlier to reduce the risks of
the last-minute withdrawal, expected
to be difficult at best.

A spokesman for United Press
International said all of its staff was
seeking evacuation. The last seven UPI
men driving to the U.S. embassy were
twice halted by crowds.
The ignition wires of their car were
ripped out, and the staffers headed for
the U.S. embassy on foot. Two, Bert
Okuley and Kenneth Englade,
managed with the help of American
marines to get into the embassy
compound and boarded helicopters.
UPI said its five remaining staffers
apparently remained in Saigon. The\
are Asian manager Leon Daniel. Alan
Dawson, Paul Vogle, Hugh Vanes and
Charles Huntley.
NBC News said seven American
staffers and two French nationals had
been removed and that one man had
stayed behind. He was not identified
out of fear for his personal safety,
NBC said.
CBS in New York reported nine of
its staffers were withdrawn and that a
British school teacher, Eric Cavaliero,
would try to handle news for them in
Saigon.
ABC said its last two American
staffers withdrew but that a Canadian
woman it declined to identify had
remained behind.

were the headlines — including this one at Stanford, when 205 demonstrators
were arrested for blocking El Camino Real.
SAIGON — Dodging random
shots fired by bitter South Vietnamese
soldiers and fighting off desperate
civilians, Americans fled from Saigon
yesterday in an armada of 81
helicopters guarded by 800 Marines.
The final evacuation of nearly 900
Americans and thousands of
Vietnamese began shortly before noon
from the roof of the fortress-like U.S.
Embassy as Communist-led troops
pressed on Saigon.
America's 30-year involvement in
Vietnam ended in tears, panic, looting
and rage.
Embittered Saigon soldiers, felling
betrayed by America's withdrawal,
fired shots at buses carrying evacuees
to the embassy and at the helicopters
skimming overhead.
Climbing Walls
Thousands of civilians, fearing they
would be killed by the Viet Cong
victors, tried toclawtheir way over the
10-foot-high wall surrounding the
gleaming white embassy building and
its gardens.
Marines and U.S. civilians used
pistol and rifle butts to hammer their
fingers, but scores got over and raced
with the Americans for the helicopter
pad on the top of the four-story
embassy.
Some frantic civilians jumped from
the wall and landed in barbed wire
below. A middle-aged man and some
women were bleeding as they struggled
against the steel barbs.
Mothers holding up their children
wept as they pleaded with Americans
to take the youngsters with them.
Looting
Across the street, men and boys
began stripping the abandoned U.S.
vehicles. Mobs stormed into
apartments vacated by the Americans
and carried out armloads of loot.
Pilots of the South Vietnamese air
force, Saigon's staunchest
anti-Communist service, flew more
than 70 air force cargo and attack
planes to American-controlled Utapao
air base in neighboring Thailand. They
carried more than 2000 refugees.
Scores of other South Vietnamese
helicopter pilots filled their craft with
military men and civilians and headed
out to sea, searching for the carriers of
the U.S. 7th Fleet.
Associated Press reporter Arnold
Zeitlin, aboard the command ship
U.S.S. Blue Ridge, said seven
Vietnamese helicopters arrived
unexpectedly and made a dash for the
helipad at the rear of the vessel.
Helicopters Collide
One pilot dropped his chopper on
the whirling blades of another that had

just landed, and chunks of metal
ripped through the air, Zeitlin
reported. The top helicopter with its
load of women and children nearly
toppled into the sea, but they were
rescued and there were no injuries.

ANGRY TIMES—It seems like ages ago — and perhaps three years is an age. But
in April 1972 demonstrations against American participation in the Vietnam war
were the headlines — including this one at Stanford, when 205 demonstrators
were arrested for blocking El Camino Real.
SAIGON — Dodging random
shots fired by bitter South Vietnamese
soldiers and fighting off desperate
civilians, Americans fled from Saigon
yesterday in an armada of 81
helicopters guarded by 800 Marines.
The final evacuation of nearly 900
Americans and thousands of
Vietnamese began shortly before noon
from the roof of the fortress-like U.S.
Embassy as Communist-led troops
pressed on Saigon.
America's 30-year involvement in
Vietnam ended in tears, panic, looting
and rage.
Embittered Saigon soldiers, felling
betrayed by America's withdrawal,
fired shots at buses carrying evacuees
to the embassy and at the helicopters
skimming overhead.
Climbing Walls
Thousands of civilians, fearing they
would be killed by the Viet Cong
victors, tried toclawtheir way over the
10-foot-high wall surrounding the
gleaming white embassy building and
its gardens.
Marines and U.S. civilians used
pistol and rifle butts to hammer their
fingers, but scores got over and raced
with the Americans for the helicopter
pad on the top of the four-story
embassy.
Some frantic civilians jumped from
the wall and landed in barbed wire
below. A middle-aged man and some
women were bleeding as they struggled
against the steel barbs.
Mothers holding up their children
wept as they pleaded with Americans
to take the youngsters with them.
Looting
Across the street, men and boys
began stripping the abandoned U.S.
vehicles. Mobs stormed into
apartments vacated by the Americans
and carried out armloads of loot.
Pilots of the South Vietnamese air
force, Saigon's staunchest
anti-Communist service, flew more
than 70 air force cargo and attack
planes to American-controlled Utapao
air base in neighboring Thailand. They
carried more than 2000 refugees.
Scores of other South Vietnamese
helicopter pilots filled their craft with
military men and civilians and headed
out to sea, searching for the carriers of
the U.S. 7th Fleet.
Associated Press reporter Arnold
Zeitlin, aboard the command ship
U.S.S. Blue Ridge, said seven
Vietnamese helicopters arrived
unexpectedly and made a dash for the
helipad at the rear of the vessel.
Helicopters Collide
One pilot dropped his chopper on
the whirling blades of another that had

just landed, and chunks of metal
ripped through the air, Zeitlin
reported. The top helicopter with its
load of women and children nearly
toppled into the sea, but they were
rescued and there were no injuries.
As other Vietnamese helicopters
landed, their passengers were pulled
free, U.S. sailors ripped the doors off
the craft to make them sink and the
pilots then jettisoned them in the sea
to make room for other arrivals
circling overhead. Two small craft
rescued the swimming pilots.
U.S. sailors heaved the two
damaged choppers overboard to clear
the landing pad. For the Vietnamese it
was a last-ditch chance to survive.
The American evacuation was
reported orderly, although it was
delayed several times because of
weather and pilot fatigue.
Roof Tops
The choppers picked up the
evacuees from the roof of the
American Embassy, the embassy
parking lot, and the tops of onetime
American billets.
Wednesday morning (Saigon time),
21 hours after it had started, the airlift
ended when a big Marine helicopter
swooped down onto the embassy roof
and plucked out a number of Marines
stranded there overnight as the rear
guard for the evacuation.
They fired a red smoke grenade to
guide the CH46 helicopter in and as it
touched down they scrambled aboard
and were airbound within four
minutes. Washington spokesmen said
there were 11 in the group.
Hundreds of civilians swarmed into
the compound and onto the roof after
the Marines had left. On the roof of a
nearby building that had also served as
an emergency helipad several hundred
civilians huddled together, hoping
there would be more choppers to carry
them away.
Abandoned Vehicles
Despite a 24-hour curfew, there was
moderate traffic in the city's streets.
There also were abandoned U.S.
Embassy vehicles that had been taken
over by Vietnamese and driven around
until they ran out of gas.
Marine pilots who arrived aboard
the U.S.S. Blue Ridge offshore said
they took fire flying over Saigon.
Four American Marines died during
the evacuation. Two were killed in the
early morning bombardment of
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport as they
were standing guard at the U.S.
defense attache's office and a rocket
hit the compound. The other two died
during the evacuation when their
helicopter plunged into the South
China Sea.

ANGRY TIMES—It seems like ages ago — and perhaps three years is an age. But
in April 1972 demonstrations against American participation in the Vietnam war
were the headlines — including this one at Stanford, when 205 demonstrators
were arrested for blocking El Camino Real.
SAIGON — Dodging random
shots fired by bitter South Vietnamese
soldiers and fighting off desperate
civilians, Americans fled from Saigon
yesterday in an armada of 81
helicopters guarded by 800 Marines.
The final evacuation of nearly 900
Americans and thousands of
Vietnamese began shortly before noon
from the roof of the fortress-like U.S.
Embassy as Communist-led troops
pressed on Saigon.
America's 30-year involvement in
Vietnam ended in tears, panic, looting
and rage.
Embittered Saigon soldiers, felling
betrayed by America's withdrawal,
fired shots at buses carrying evacuees
to the embassy and at the helicopters
skimming overhead.
Climbing Walls
Thousands of civilians, fearing they
would be killed by the Viet Cong
victors, tried toclawtheir way over the
10-foot-high wall surrounding the
gleaming white embassy building and
its gardens.
Marines and U.S. civilians used
pistol and rifle butts to hammer their
fingers, but scores got over and raced
with the Americans for the helicopter
pad on the top of the four-story
embassy.
Some frantic civilians jumped from
the wall and landed in barbed wire
below. A middle-aged man and some
women were bleeding as they struggled
against the steel barbs.
Mothers holding up their children
wept as they pleaded with Americans
to take the youngsters with them.
Looting
Across the street, men and boys
began stripping the abandoned U.S.
vehicles. Mobs stormed into
apartments vacated by the Americans
and carried out armloads of loot.
Pilots of the South Vietnamese air
force, Saigon's staunchest
anti-Communist service, flew more
than 70 air force cargo and attack
planes to American-controlled Utapao
air base in neighboring Thailand. They
carried more than 2000 refugees.
Scores of other South Vietnamese
helicopter pilots filled their craft with
military men and civilians and headed
out to sea, searching for the carriers of
the U.S. 7th Fleet.
Associated Press reporter Arnold
Zeitlin, aboard the command ship
U.S.S. Blue Ridge, said seven
Vietnamese helicopters arrived
unexpectedly and made a dash for the
helipad at the rear of the vessel.
Helicopters Collide
One pilot dropped his chopper on
the whirling blades of another that had

just landed, and chunks of metal
ripped through the air, Zeitlin
reported. The top helicopter with its
load of women and children nearly
toppled into the sea, but they were
rescued and there were no injuries.
As other Vietnamese helicopters
landed, their passengers were pulled
free, U.S. sailors ripped the doors off
the craft to make them sink and the
pilots then jettisoned them in the sea
to make room for other arrivals
circling overhead. Two small craft
rescued the swimming pilots.
U.S. sailors heaved the two
damaged choppers overboard to clear
the landing pad. For the Vietnamese it
was a last-ditch chance to survive.
The American evacuation was
reported orderly, although it was
delayed several times because of
weather and pilot fatigue.
Roof Tops
The choppers picked up the
evacuees from the roof of the
American Embassy, the embassy
parking lot, and the tops of onetime
American billets.
Wednesday morning (Saigon time),
21 hours after it had started, the airlift
ended when a big Marine helicopter
swooped down onto the embassy roof
and plucked out a number of Marines
stranded there overnight as the rear
guard for the evacuation.
They fired a red smoke grenade to
guide the CH46 helicopter in and as it
touched down they scrambled aboard
and were airbound within four
minutes. Washington spokesmen said
there were 11 in the group.
Hundreds of civilians swarmed into
the compound and onto the roof after
the Marines had left. On the roof of a
nearby building that had also served as
an emergency helipad several hundred
civilians huddled together, hoping
there would be more choppers to carry
them away.
Abandoned Vehicles
Despite a 24-hour curfew, there was
moderate traffic in the city's streets.
There also were abandoned U.S.
Embassy vehicles that had been taken
over by Vietnamese and driven around
until they ran out of gas.
Marine pilots who arrived aboard
the U.S.S. Blue Ridge offshore said
they took fire flying over Saigon.
Four American Marines died during
the evacuation. Two were killed in the
early morning bombardment of
Saigon's Tan Son Nhut airport as they
were standing guard at the U.S.
defense attache's office and a rocket
hit the compound. The other two died
during the evacuation when their
helicopter plunged into the South
China Sea.
Officials in Washington reported

that 6400 persons had been evacuated
in the 13-hour operation, with U.S.
Ambassador Graham Martin on the
last lift of 19 helicopters. They were
carried by choppers to aircraft carriers
standing off the coast.
Tht massive shelling of Tan Son
Nhut air base and an order by South
Vietnamese President Duong Van
Minh lor the American defense attache
and his staff to get out led to President
Ford order to remove all Americans,
with only a handful of newsmen and
relief workers remaining voluntarily.
A !iandful of newsmen passed up
the final evacuation to report the
dramatic closing events of the war
many already had risked their lives to
cover.
Do ens of others joined the
delico;>ter evacuation. There was no
repori of injuries among the evacuated
newsmen.
Three Associated Press reporters
with a combined experience of nearly
two decades in Indochina volunteered
to remain.
Other AP staffers and members of
other news organizations had been
pulled out earlier to reduce the risks of
the last-minute withdrawal, expected
to be difficult at best.

A spokesman for United Press
International said all of its staff was
seeking evacuation. The last seven UPI
men driving to the U.S. embassy were
twice halted by crowds.
The ignition wires of their car were
ripped out, and the staffers headed for
the U.S. embassy on foot. Two, Bert
Okuley and Kenneth Englade,
managed with the help of American
marines to get into the embassy
compound and boarded helicopters.
UPI said its five remaining staffers
apparently remained in Saigon. The\
are Asian manager Leon Daniel. Alan
Dawson, Paul Vogle, Hugh Vanes and
Charles Huntley.
NBC News said seven American
staffers and two French nationals had
been removed and that one man had
stayed behind. He was not identified
out of fear for his personal safety,
NBC said.
CBS in New York reported nine of
its staffers were withdrawn and that a
British school teacher, Eric Cavaliero,
would try to handle news for them in
Saigon.
ABC said its last two American
staffers withdrew but that a Canadian
woman it declined to identify had
remained behind.
