# 'All American' Boys: But Now They're Dead
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — One was a Boy of
the Year in 1971. The other had been
an Eagle Scout. Now they're both
dead Marines.
The two, Lance Cpl. Darwin L.
Judge of Marshalltown, lowa, and Cpl.
Charles McMahon of Woburn. Mass.,
were killed in an artillery and rocket
attack on Tan Son Nhut airport
Monday near Saigon.
They were among the last
Americans killed in the war and two of
four Marines killed during the last days
of the American evacuation operation
in South Vietnam. Two other Marines
died yesterday when their helicopter
fell into the South China Sea. Their
names were not immediately available.
McMahon and Judge were part of a
security guard detachment helping
guard the American embassy in

Saigon.
McMahon, 22, was a native of
Woburn and known in that Boston
suburb as a model boy. The son of Mr.
and Mrs. Charles McMahon, he had
been active in the Woburn Boys Club
and was named its Boy of the Year in
1971, the year before he graduated
from Woburn High School.
He was home recently on leave and
attended the annual dinner of the
Boys Club April 5 where he was
singled out as former holder of the
club's award. McMahon had been on
leave after embassy duty in
Washington with the consular corps.
Some of his leave he also spent at
Tenney Mountain in Plymouth, N.H.,
a favorite skiing resort.
Judge went to Vietnam last month
for what was to have been a one-year
tour of duty.
