# Stanford Students Stop Out With Style
## 
### PATRICIA THOMPSON 
"Stopping Out" is in.
At Stanford, the new craze,
taking a quarter, a year or any
period away from the traditional
academic grind, is becoming more
widespread, accepted and in those
cases where necessary, more easily
justified.
"It's a whole different world,"
said one communications student
just returning to the University to
utilize his one-year sabbatical
doing work related to his major.
"You can't explain what a
professional does until you do it."
Speaking at an informal
afternoon discussion in Tresidder
two weeks ago, he said his
experience on the outside helped
him gain self-confidence and
confirm his goal: to become a
broadcaster.
'Professional Stopout'
Another self-proclaimed
"professional stopout" said he has
taken more than four years off
from Stanford at different times.
He said he has worked at
everything from hard-hat
construction to para-professional
counseling of juveniles.
Discovering his desire to work
with children brought him back to
Stanford to complete an
undergraduate career which began
in 1965, he said.
But to obtain professional

experience is not the only reason
students stop out. Travel is
another reason. Two
respresentatives from Bechtel
International Center (I-Center)
highlighted some of the travel
options from straight study at a
Stanford overseas campus to an
individualized work - stu dv
program to independent volunteer
or paid employment.
To get the most from an
overseas experience, one
representative said, it is necessary
to clarify the reasons for going
and set particular goals to
accomplish while there.
She also recommended finding
locations of American centers and
arranging University credit if
desired, before boarding the plane
or ship. Though paid employment
is hard to find, she said, the
possibilities and benefits of an
overseas experience remain
extensive.
Red Tape?
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Harold Boyd presented the
red-tape aspects of stopping out,
which, as he stated them, do not
seem as conspiratorial or
overwhelming as one might
assume.
Boyd explained that Stanford
is unique in that if a student has
good academic standing, he can
withdraw without penalization or
re-application procedures at any
time for any number of quarters.
He cautioned that getting
refunds, however, depends on the
time in the quarter one
withdraws. Boyd also said a
perspective stopout should go to
the Credit Evaluation office
before leaving school and should
send letters to the University
about a month before return.

locations of American centers and
arranging University credit if
desired, before boarding the plane
or ship. Though paid employment
is hard to find, she said, the
possibilities and benefits of an

extensive.
Red Tape?
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Harold Boyd presented the
red-tape aspects of stopping out,
which, as he stated them, do not
seem as conspiratorial or
overwhelming as one might
assume.
Boyd explained that Stanford
is unique in that if a student has
good academic standing, he can
withdraw without penalization or
re-application procedures at any
time for any number of quarters.
He cautioned that getting
refunds, however, depends on the
time in the quarter one
withdraws. Boyd also said a
perspective stopout should go to
the Credit Evaluation office
before leaving school and should
send letters to the University
about a month before return.
"Stopping Out" is in.
At Stanford, the new craze,
taking a quarter, a year or any
period away from the traditional
academic grind, is becoming more
widespread, accepted and in those
cases where necessary, more easily
justified.
"It's a whole different world,"
said one communications student
just returning to the University to
utilize his one-year sabbatical
doing work related to his major.
"You can't explain what a
professional does until you do it."
Speaking at an informal
afternoon discussion in Tresidder
two weeks ago, he said his
experience on the outside helped
him gain self-confidence and
confirm his goal: to become a
broadcaster.
'Professional Stopout'
Another self-proclaimed
"professional stopout" said he has
taken more than four years off
from Stanford at different times.
He said he has worked at
everything from hard-hat
construction to para-professional
counseling of juveniles.
Discovering his desire to work
with children brought him back to
Stanford to complete an
undergraduate career which began
in 1965, he said.
But to obtain professional

experience is not the only reason
students stop out. Travel is
another reason. Two
respresentatives from Bechtel
International Center (I-Center)
highlighted some of the travel
options from straight study at a
Stanford overseas campus to an
individualized work - stu dv
program to independent volunteer
or paid employment.
To get the most from an
overseas experience, one
representative said, it is necessary
to clarify the reasons for going
and set particular goals to
accomplish while there.
