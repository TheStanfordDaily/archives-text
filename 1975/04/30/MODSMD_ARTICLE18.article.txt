## Moffitt Family Has Two Stars Giant Hurler Is 'Second Best' 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Twenty-six-year-old Randy
Moffitt already has three seasons
and 161 pitching appearances
with the San Francisco Giants
behind him, and last season,
registered "more saves" (preserved
victories) than any other pitcher
in the National League except the
Los Angeles Dodgers' Mr.
Wonderful, Mike Marshall — all of
which is good enough to rank
Moffitt as one of the best young
relief pitchers in baseball and the
family's second best athlete.
Moffitt's sister is Billie Jean
King. Or rather, Randy Moffitt is
Billie Jean King's brother. There's
a difference. Although Moffitt
and his substantial personal
achievements deserve recognition
in themselves, he remains known
primarily as just that — BJK's
brother. Let's face it, nobody
looks at Billie Jean King and says,
"Oh yeah, she's Randy Moffitt's
sister."
Moffitt doesn't mind playing
the role of little brother (Billie
Jean is five years older), which is
fortunate because his nickname
around the Giant clubhouse is, of
course, "Billie Jean."
"I'm proud to be called Billie
Jean King's brother," Moffitt
says. "Tt doesn't bother me a bit."
If the siblings'combined talents
seem extraordinary, that's nothing
compared to the relationship
they've been able to maintain.
"We've never had a fight," Moffitt
said. "We have a perfect
brother-sister relationship."
Moffitt is not interested in
rivaling his sister for wealth or
popularity. "I'm not envious | of
her |," her says."The more
money she makes, the better. She
really works hard for it and
deserves it."
Moffitt grew up in Long Beach
and actually took up tennis before
baseball. Randy was six years old
and Billie Jean 11 when both
began taking tennis lessons from
the public recreation department.
Randy continued playing tennis
for three years but, too young to
play effectively with his sister,
lost interest when he couldn't find
people to play.
"I think there were two or
three kids my own age playing
tennis regularly in Long Beach,"
Moffitt said. "I was more
interested in baseball. There were
more kids playing in Little
League. I haven't played tennis
again until recently."
In the meantime, if Moffitt

hasn't risen to the top of his
chosen sport, as his sister has in
hers, he hasn't done badly. With
the trade of Elias Sosa, the Giants'
other top relief specialist last year,
to St. Louis over the winter,
Moffitt has become the ace of the
San Francisco bullpen. And as of
this writing, the 6-foot-3, 190
pound righthander is unscored
upon in nine and one-third innings
of work this season despite a sore
back.
Moffitt was called up from
Phoenix, the Giants' top minor
league affiliate, to San Francisco
in June 1972. He's been with "the
big club" ever since. That flight
from Phoenix to San Francisco
was one Moffitt will not soon
forget. Most passengers are lucky
to get a Coke and a few
complimentary peanuts out of a
United flight, but Moffitt gained
both a career and a wife at 30,000
feet.
Moffitt's first trip to the major
leagues coincided with the present
Pam Moffitt's first flight out of
stewardess school. The two were
married last Oct. 19 after a
cross-country courtship. Now,
between Pam's work and Randy's
road trips, the pair make Henry
Kissinger look like a homebody.
Moffitt pitched in 40 games for
the Giants after being called up a
third of the way into the 1972
season and finished with a
respectable 3.68 ERA. Moffitt
was superb in 1973, his first full
season with San Francisco. He
appeared in 60 games, his control
improved, and his ERA fell to
2.43.
Moffitt and the Giants would
just as soon forget 1974. Moffitt
actually pitched well until the last
two months of the season, when
both his arm and ERA swelled.
Pitching frequently, the Giant
pitcher's arm gave out and he was
forced to throw at less than peak

efficiency. The Giants have no
such excuse, setting team records
in 1974 for fewest wins and
lowest attendance since they
moved out west in 1958.
"It was the worst season since
I've been here," Moffitt said. "We
weren't winning and we weren't
putting people in the ballpark. It
was a combination of things. You
can't blame it on any one person.
Everyone happened to have a bad
year at the same time."
Will 1975 be any better?
"It couldn't be any worse,"
Moffitt said. "I can see things
getting better. Everybody has one
more year of experience. I'm
hoping everyone can revert this
year. Maybe we can surprise some
people. I'm more or less just as
curious as everybody to see if it'll
be different this season. It'll be
interesting to see how all the
trades worked out."
New Giants via trades are
Bobby Murcer, Marc Hill, Derrell
Thomas, and Von Joshua. Gone
are Bobby Bonds, Tito Fuentes,
and Sosa.
Moffitt has wanted to try his
hand as a starting pitcher, but
Sosa's departure gives him about
as much chance of leaving the
bullpen as William Shockley has
of being named an honorary
member of the Black Panthers.
"I don't see myself starting in
the near future," Moffitt said,
"but I'm curious to see if I could
start. I've always thought I could.
I'd hate to go my whole career
and never give it a try."
Not that Moffitt dislikes relief
pitching.
"I like to pitch under pressure;
I concentrate better. That's why I
like relief pitching. In Little
League I'd fool around until I got
men on base — second and third,
or bases loaded — and then bear
down."

THE OLD SOFT SHOE -No, dance students, this is not the watusi. Left fielder Dave Baker and third
baseman Gary Pitchford (31) display the hasepath boldness that has netted 114 stolen bags for the Cards
this season, a new school record. Stanford had seven and Baker four in yesterday's 5-3 victory.
