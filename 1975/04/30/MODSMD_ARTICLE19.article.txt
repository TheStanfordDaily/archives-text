## Foreman Backs To The Ropes

Foreman fights five!!!
Like, King Kong meets Godzilla!!! or
Batman meets the Joker!!!
But certainly nothing like Conan the
Barbarian (Crom!).
George Foreman fought five large entities
Saturday and made sports history in
becoming the youngest former heavyweight
boxing champion to humiliate himself in the
ring before a national television audience.
He also proved that fools are still being
bom every minute.
It was a match that, if nothing else, marks
a new low in history of boxing. There was
Big George himself, overweight and out of
shape, prancing around the ring with the
finesse of a lame yak and boxing with the
skill of a punch-drunk kangaroo.
There was the world champion,
Muhammed Ali, leading chants of "AH-LEE!
AH-LEE!" and yelling at each of Foreman's
opponents, telling them to get against the
ropes. As he explained (or rather shouted) to
Howard Cosell at one point, "That's the Ali
way. That's the Ali style of boxing." And the
champ proceeded to demonstrate on the side
of the ring, bobbing forward and backward
with his hands up protecting his face,
occasionally jabbing a left to the air.
Ali's commentary consisted of telling
everyone how tired Foreman was getting and
how bad Foreman was and how, if the fans
really wanted to see some boxing, he would
put on a show in Orlando, Florida Saturday
night. The fans loved it. Foreman was not as
impressed'. He threw a chair at Muhammed
before the fights began, and he kept staring
at him between fights.

There were the fighters themselves.
Foreman floored the first two boxers (if
you care to use the term loosely) in the
second round. Alonzo Johnson was the first,
and he sort of crumpled from a lack of talent
(among other things).
Then came Jerry Judge, who went down
a couple times but got back up. He was
taunted by Foreman after the KO, got back
up, went after him, and the two wrestled to
the mat. Foreman received two points for a
take-down.
The third boxer, Terry Daniels, who
Foreman had KOed a couple years ago, lasted
two ragged rounds before Foreman asked the
referee to stop the fight. Daniels, at 195
pounds, was slightly out-weighed (Foreman
came in at 232) but was actually in better
shape when the fight stopped than he had
been at points during the first round.
Daniels was upset by the decision. He
decided to continue the fight and he and old
George exchanged a few light blows before
Foreman, displaying his best punch of the
afternoon, knocked down one of Daniels'
corner boys with a left hook. The
unsuspecting handler lost his glasses and
received a cut on the mouth. A TKO, no
doubt.
Charley Polite, a hack who has probably
thrown more fights than he's won (and who
has fought but once in a decade), was the
fourth fighter and he went the distance
utilizing the "Ali style":
Bing! Round one. Foreman moves toward
Polite. Polite moves to ropes, covering his
head. Foreman throws ineffective
roundhouse punches. Polite occasionally

shows his face, and dot's a few Ali shuffles.
Eventually the fight becomes Foreman trying
to pull Polite away from the ropes, and Polite
constantly backing away, scoring a couple
times with a hard right. Ali bobs forward and
backward explaining his new form of boxing.
"AH-LEE! AH-LEE!"
By the time Foreman got through with
the fourth comedy he was sweating profusely
and showing his poor condition. The final
fight with an inept Boone Kirkman was
spiritless.
Foreman fights five, KOs two, calls off
one, and goes the distance with the others.
Oh boy. Throw in a kiss from Polite and a
punch to a bystander, and you get eggroll.
Afterward Foreman said, "It looked so
easy, people thought it was a play game."
Polite said, "Foreman's not the same since
he went against Ali." Kirkman said,
"Foreman is still strong but he's not the same
as when I went against him." Judge said,
"He's not even that strong anymore. He's just
big."
Foreman said he proved what he wanted
to prove.
In all it was a horrendous display of
professional boxing (that came close lo
professional gladiation) and was perhaps
redeemed only by the fact it was held in
Canada and not the United States.
All Foreman did was provide Muhammed
Ali another chance to tell everyone how great
Muhammed Ali really is.
But, alas. Until the rest of the boxing
world pulls its head out of the sand (or
wherever else it may be), the Butterfly that
Stings will reign.
Foreman fought five.
