# Lyman Supports Judicial Proposal
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
President Richard Lyman indicated
yesterday that he supports the
proposed new campus judicial system
endorsed by student voters last week.
Appearing on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman stated that "my
present inclination is to favor the
proposal" when it comes before the
Faculty Senate a week from Thursday
for debate and possible approval. If
the Senate endorses the plan, Lyman
must also approve it before it takes
effect.
The president had declined to state
his views on the proposal prior to last
week's ASSU election. In that
balloting, students approved the
proposal of the Committee of 15
(C-15) by a 769 to 635 tally.
Yesterday, Lyman noted that the
new proposal may not satisfy all
interested parties. But, he said, it
"goes some of the distance toward
meeting some of the student
criticisms" that caused earlier C-15
proposals to be defeated by the
student body.
The current package provides for a
six-member panel: three faculty
members named by the Faculty Senate
and three students named by the
ASSU Senate from a list of 24
interested students chosen at random.
The panel would have two chairmen, a
student to preside over Honor Code
cases and a faculty member to preside
in all others (the chairman also votes
in case of a tie).
Drew Criticism
Previous proposals drew criticism
over the lack of a clear student
majority on the panel and over alleged

inequities between methods of
selection of student and faculty
members.
Some student leaders have
indicated they favored the latest C-15
proposal as the first step towards a
further reform of the judicial system.
But Lyman yesterday wondered
whether additional changes were
likely.
Muster Energy
At least for the near future, he said,
"I would think people would find it a
little difficult to muster the necessary
energy to attack the problem all over
again."
In answer to other questions during
the wide-ranging discussion, the
president lightheartedly claimed that
he would be "100 percent cowardly"
in commenting on the latest campus
parking recommendations of the
Committee on Land and Building
Development.
Time To Study
The whole parking issue, he said,
has become "unbelievably
controverted and warmly argued" and
he wants more time to study the
proposals before making up his mind.
Lyman sidestepped questions on
faculty tenure and hiring, although he
did caution against misconstruction of
the recently released University report
on appointments and promotions
authored by Staff Associate David
Hopkins of the Academic Planning
Office and Vice Provost Arthur
Bienenstock.
The report, Lyman said, was more
along the lines of laying out
alternatives than advocating specific
hiring and tenure levels.
