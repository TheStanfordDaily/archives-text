Little Punches Witness In SLA Trial
SACRAMENTO — Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA)
member Russell Little punched a prosecution witness
yesterday before bailiffs dragged him from the Marcus
Foster murder trial courtroom.
Little had been asking Christopher Thompson, a slightly
built black man, if he felt responsible for the deaths of six
SLA members in a Los Angeles shootout last May.
Suddenly he lunged at Thompson, who was called "an
enemy of the people" in an SLA tape recording a year ago,
and knocked Thompson's glasses off when he struck him.
Thompson did not appear injured as bailiffs yanked the
slender, 25-year-old Little down a stairway to a holding cell
in the courthouse basement.
During the brief struggle, a woman in the spectators'
section was heard yelling "kill." An attorney said three
members of the jury were in tears as they filed out of the
courtroom after the incident.
Thompson had testified of his relationships with
numerous SLA members, including Little and co-defendant
Joseph Remiro, who are both on trial for the 1973 slaying
of Oakland schools' chief Marcus Foster.
Ford, Hussein Toast Mideast Peace
WASHINGTON — President Ford and King Hussein of
Jordan, exchanging toasts at a White House dinner last
pledged continued efforts to seek peace in the Middle
East.
Ford said that despite the failure of Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger's most recent Mideast peace effort, "we
can't tolerate stagnation or stalemate and we do not intend
to do so.
"The momentum for progress has to be continued," the
President said, because "the situation in the Middle East is
totally related to the improvement of world condition."
Hussein praised the Mideast efforts of Ford and
Kissinger, whom he said has acted with "patience,
perseverance and dedication."
"Regardless of the outcome to date, we admire the spirit
and the tremendous effort," the king said."Welook forward
to the future with hope in the chance that is ahead, which
might be a final chance for a just and durable peace."

marijuana law cleared its last committee test yesterday and
its author predicted the bill would win final passage soon.

predicted: "I think it will pass."

knocks down the crime of marijuana possession to
inisdemeanor status.
If approved by the Assembly, the bill would go back to
the Senate for amendment approval and then go to Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr.
Moscone predicted the governor would sign the bill.
Brown has said he would sign a bill like the Oregon law,
and this is like the Oregon law," Moscone said after the
vote.
ilis bill, which takes effect Jan. 1, allows persons caught
with an ounce or less to be given a citation instead of being
booked on a formal charge.
In the bill the maximum penalty for possession of one
ounce or less is a $100 fine, Moscone said. The maximum
penalty for possession of more than an ounce would be
$500 and six months in county jail.

charge as a misdemeanor or felony, and a convicted person
can face up to 10 years in state prison on a first conviction.
