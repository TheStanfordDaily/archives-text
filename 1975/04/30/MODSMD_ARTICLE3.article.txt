# ARLO Seeks Other Funds; PIRG Closes Campus Office
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) is applying for funds outside
the University, and the Northern
California Public Interest Research
Group (NorCal PIRG) is curtailing its
campus activities, following the defeat
of fee assessments for both broups.
"We have the Daily to thank for
it," said ARLO co-director Edith
Kddy, referring to the newspaper's
editorial opposition to the ARLO
assessment.
Eddy accused the Daily editorial of
including two inaccuracies: that
ARLO had been operating successfully
without student money and that it had
a $10,000 surplus.
Graduate student Jamie Newton,
one of ARLO's founders, stated that
ARLO actually started with $2000 in
seed money from the Council of
Presidents and the ASSU Senate. This
evidence of student support "went a
long way toward convincing the
Hancock Foundation" that ARLO was
worthy of a grant last November,
Newton added.
Eddy claimed that the currently
unspent ARLO funds will be gone by
August. According to Newton,

ARLO's main expense is paying staff
members to coordinate students with
project ideas, faculty sponsors and
community groups.
Wrote Letter
Newton wrote a letter defending
ARLO after the Daily
recommendation was printed, but the
letter was never published. "I think if
the Daily had printed the letter, our
assessment would have passed," he
said.
Opinions Editor John Freed said
that the letter was received too late to
print before the election.
Eddy said that ARLO is re-applying
to the Hancock Foundation and is
applying to the San Mateo Foundation
and the University Relations Office for
funds. If these efforts fail, the group
may try for another fee assessment
next fall, Newton said.
Both ARLO and NorCal PIRG will
remain in their offices in the ASSU
office at least through the summer.
Not Political
PIRG student representative Jeffrey
Kimball said the consumer activist
group's assessment did not pass
because, "basically, Stanford is not a
political campus; it doesn't have a

political consciousness."
He also said the Daily had included
a "misconception" in its editorial
opposition to the assessment when it
criticized the group for not doing
more this year.
Although PIRG's first fee
assessment was collected last fall, the
group did not get access to the money
until four months ago, Kimball
claimed.
He said 80 to 90 percent of the
money originally was to be channeled
into the PIRG regional board of
directors, and that the University
consequently held up release of the
funds because it did not want to
collect a fee assessment for an
off-campus group.
University officials could not be
reached to confirm or deny Kimball's
charges.
'Daily' Motives
In an interview with the Santa Clara
(student newspaper) last week, NorCal
PIRG Projects Coordinator Lee Jones
charged that the Daily had political
reasons for not supporting the fee
assessment passed, and so opposed
only off-campus interest groups.

the Quad, 12 art students were able to construct this work of art in the Quad
last night before the University ordered its removal.
But Kimball said that the Daily
only "reflected the feeling of the
campus as a whole," although he felt
that criticism of NorCal PIRG was
unduly harsh. "The Informer," a
consumer information book produced
by the group, was criticized because of
allegedly inadequate surveying
techniques. Kimball said that except
for minor omissions, the publication
was complete and valuable.
NorCal PIRG will have to reduce its
fulltime staff from two to one now
that it has lost financial support from
Stanford, Kimball said, and the
Stanford branch will have no paid staff
members available.

Eddy said that ARLO is re-applying
to the Hancock Foundation and is
applying to the San Mateo Foundation
and the University Relations Office for
funds. If these efforts fail, the group
may try for another fee assessment
next fall, Newton said.
Both ARLO and NorCal PIRG will
remain in their offices in the ASSU
office at least through the summer.
Not Political
PIRG student representative Jeffrey
Kimball said the consumer activist
group's assessment did not pass
because, "basically, Stanford is not a
political campus; it doesn't have a

political consciousness."
He also said the Daily had included
a "misconception" in its editorial
opposition to the assessment when it
criticized the group for not doing
more this year.
Although PIRG's first fee
assessment was collected last fall, the
group did not get access to the money
until four months ago, Kimball
claimed.
He said 80 to 90 percent of the
money originally was to be channeled
into the PIRG regional board of
directors, and that the University
consequently held up release of the
funds because it did not want to
collect a fee assessment for an
off-campus group.
University officials could not be
reached to confirm or deny Kimball's
charges.
'Daily' Motives
In an interview with the Santa Clara
(student newspaper) last week, NorCal
PIRG Projects Coordinator Lee Jones
charged that the Daily had political
reasons for not supporting the fee
assessment passed, and so opposed
only off-campus interest groups.

But Kimball said that the Daily
only "reflected the feeling of the
campus as a whole," although he felt
that criticism of NorCal PIRG was
unduly harsh. "The Informer," a
consumer information book produced
by the group, was criticized because of
allegedly inadequate surveying
techniques. Kimball said that except
for minor omissions, the publication
was complete and valuable.
NorCal PIRG will have to reduce its
fulltime staff from two to one now

Stanford, Kimball said, and the
Stanford branch will have no paid staff

"We have the Daily to thank for
it," said ARLO co-director Edith
Kddy, referring to the newspaper's
editorial opposition to the ARLO
assessment.
Eddy accused the Daily editorial of
including two inaccuracies: that
ARLO had been operating successfully
without student money and that it had
a $10,000 surplus.
Graduate student Jamie Newton,
one of ARLO's founders, stated that
ARLO actually started with $2000 in
seed money from the Council of
Presidents and the ASSU Senate. This
evidence of student support "went a
long way toward convincing the
Hancock Foundation" that ARLO was
worthy of a grant last November,
Newton added.
Eddy claimed that the currently
unspent ARLO funds will be gone by
August. According to Newton,

ARLO's main expense is paying staff
members to coordinate students with
project ideas, faculty sponsors and
community groups.

Newton wrote a letter defending
ARLO after the Daily
recommendation was printed, but the
letter was never published. "I think if
the Daily had printed the letter, our

said.
