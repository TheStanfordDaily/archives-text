## 
### RON ELVING 
One year after taking office,
outgoing ASSU President | Mike
Herman looked back this week and
spoke of his administration's
"fulfilling promises and justifying faith
in the Council of Presidents [COPJ"
The Herman slate's campaign
literature had stressed "a few realistic
services which we would like to bring
to the community," the president said.
The ticket defeated a slate (headed by
800 Bacon) that emphasized social
and political issuer, of a wider scope.
"My personal direction has been to,
see that the promises and proposals we,
made came into being," Herman said.
"A lot of people campaigned for u&
and believed in us, and I wanted to be
able to look those people in the eye
after we left office."
Cataloging ASSU projects on which
he has worked, Herman mentioned the
Lecture Note Service, the
Stanford-in-Stanford theme house.

revision of the ASSU Nominations
Committee, assistance to the
Escondido child care center and
student passage of a new campus
judicial system.
Herman also pointed to the
establishment of a commission on
advising ("to advise professors on what
their advisees want") and the
publication of a bi-quarterly
newsletter that "gives the Council of
Presidents a heightened level of
visibility."
Negative Aspects
Turning to negative aspects of the
year's experience, Herman cited Asst.
Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish's
tenure denial ("a defeat for all of us
who worked to reverse the decision")
and the furor which arose over the
proposed hiring of fulltime
professionals to manage ASSU
finances and special events.
ASSU Vice President Ann Carter
called her COP's objectives "realistic"

and added that its "track record was
100 percent." Carter said she was
"happiest" about her work on three
new Row houses scheduled for
occupancy in fall 1976, calling them
"a model project designed according
to what the students wanted."
Carter also worked on the proposed
student record co-op, but did not feel
"particularly disappointed" when the
project failed to gain student support
at the polls. "There was no point in
going any further if the students didn't
want it," she said.
Course Review
"One thing that really distressed me
was the Course Review," Carter said.
"We took [the Course Review] to the
Faculty Senate and encountered a lot
of opposition. Many of | the faculty |
just aren't receptive to course
evaluation done by students."
ASSU Vice President Len Mackey
regretted the conflict between his job
