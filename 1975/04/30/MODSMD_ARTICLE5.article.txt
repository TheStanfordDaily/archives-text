# People Say They Feel Relief, Hope

### VLAE KERSHNER 
Most students and faculty surveyed
by the Daily last night after the
surrender of the South Vietnamese
government not only seemed relieved
that the war was over but expected the
new government to be better for the
people than was the regime of former
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
Few students were overly surprised
at the news of the fall. Senior David
Antonuccio, summing up a
widely-held view, said, "It was
inevitable. You can't expect a fascist
government like Thieu's to stand up
without U.S. military aid."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall likewise was not surprised at
news of the surrender, saying 'i didn't
expect [President Duong Van "Big"]
Minh to fight to the death."
Marshall said the new South
Vietnamese government would likely
follow an independent course. "The
Vietnamese are easier going than the
Russians and Chinese. The
shopkeepers will probably remain in
business for awhile and the peasants
will probably be allowed to keep a
parcel of their own land while working
on collectives.
"The Vietnamese are passionately
independent. They are communists,
there is no doubt about that, but they
won't feel a slavish obligation to
model their system after the Chinese,"
Marshall said.
Disagreement
Director of East Asian Studies
Victor Li agreed that the new
government would likely be "very
independent."
But Stefan Possony, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, disagreed:
"The new government will either be
like that of the Ukrainian government
or like that of Poland. It doesn't make
that much difference. From now on,
Hanoi will give the orders in all of
Vietnam."
Both Marshall and Assoc. History
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke doubted that a
"bloodbath" would occur.
'Some Violence'
"There'll be some violence —
there's scores to be settled," Van
Slyke said. "But I don't foresee and
will be very surprised if there's any
bloodbath like that predicted by those
in our country who wanted the U.S. to
continue its involvement"
