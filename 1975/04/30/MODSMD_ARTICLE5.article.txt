# People Say They Feel Relief, Hope
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Most students and faculty surveyed
by the Daily last night after the
surrender of the South Vietnamese
government not only seemed relieved
that the war was over but expected the
new government to be better for the
people than was the regime of former
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
Few students were overly surprised
at the news of the fall. Senior David
Antonuccio, summing up a
widely-held view, said, "It was
inevitable. You can't expect a fascist
government like Thieu's to stand up
without U.S. military aid."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall likewise was not surprised at
news of the surrender, saying 'i didn't
expect [President Duong Van "Big"]
Minh to fight to the death."
Marshall said the new South
Vietnamese government would likely
follow an independent course. "The
Vietnamese are easier going than the
Russians and Chinese. The
shopkeepers will probably remain in
business for awhile and the peasants
will probably be allowed to keep a
parcel of their own land while working
on collectives.
"The Vietnamese are passionately
independent. They are communists,
there is no doubt about that, but they
won't feel a slavish obligation to
model their system after the Chinese,"
Marshall said.
Disagreement
Director of East Asian Studies
Victor Li agreed that the new
government would likely be "very
independent."
But Stefan Possony, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, disagreed:
"The new government will either be
like that of the Ukrainian government
or like that of Poland. It doesn't make
that much difference. From now on,
Hanoi will give the orders in all of
Vietnam."
Both Marshall and Assoc. History
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke doubted that a
"bloodbath" would occur.
'Some Violence'
"There'll be some violence —
there's scores to be settled," Van
Slyke said. "But I don't foresee and
will be very surprised if there's any
bloodbath like that predicted by those
in our country who wanted the U.S. to
continue its involvement"
While most professors and students
seemed relieved at the outcome,
radical leaders past and present were
nothing short of overjoyed at the
outcome.
A meeting of the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC) burst into
applause when informed of the
surrender. Later, ARC released an
official statement saying, "It is a time
for great happiness and celebration.
"The history of this war has made
it abundantly clear that it was the U.S.
that was responsible for the long and
terrible bloodbath the lndochinese
people have suffered," the ARC
statement said.
4 A Victory'
David Harris, former student body
president and anti-draft activist, said,
"Vietnam hasn't fallen, but it has
risen."
But Bruce Smyth, editor of the
conservative Stanford Arena, said
that as a result of U.S. "no-win" war
policy, U.S. allies around the world
"may come to the conclusion that
while it is unpleasant to be an enemy
of the United States, to be its friend
may be fatal."
Few agreed that the surrender was
sad, however. History Prof. Mark
Mancall said, "It's the best thing that
could have happened — it should have
happened years agd."
Mancall said, "1 personally hope
that the two Vietnams are reunified as
soon as possible."
Poor Better Off
Asst. Political Science Prof. Harry
Harding predicted that "economically,
many of the poor will be better
off... We've been told that the fall of
South Vietnam would mean terrible
things. I'm curious to see if the dire
predictions of the '50s and '60s will be
borne out."
But most students, far from making
predictions, simply seemed happy that
the killing had ended at last. One
student, who claimed he was on an
acid trip, said, "I'm glad its over — I
like shooting guns and trees and shit,

but wow, this thing of blowing people
away is too much ..."
Freshman David Seidenwurn
laughed at the news of the war's end,
and added sarcastically, "It's a
tragedy. Now they have no chance for
freedom and self-determination.
American appeasement of foreign
governments has gone too far. It's just
like Munich — what are we going to do
next, give them Hawaii?"
Freshman Sarah Alfadl, who lived
in Egypt at the time of the 1967
Middle East war, said that from her
personal experience she was sure that
"the people in Vietnam are just
relieved."
Perhaps reaction was most
succinctly summarized by one elderly
woman. Told of the war's end, she said
only, "Thank God it's over."

Ross.)

"may come to the conclusion that
while it is unpleasant to be an enemy
of the United States, to be its friend
may be fatal."
Few agreed that the surrender was
sad, however. History Prof. Mark
Mancall said, "It's the best thing that
could have happened — it should have
happened years agd."
Mancall said, "1 personally hope
that the two Vietnams are reunified as
soon as possible."
Poor Better Off
Asst. Political Science Prof. Harry
Harding predicted that "economically,
many of the poor will be better
off... We've been told that the fall of
South Vietnam would mean terrible
things. I'm curious to see if the dire
predictions of the '50s and '60s will be
borne out."
But most students, far from making
predictions, simply seemed happy that
the killing had ended at last. One
student, who claimed he was on an
acid trip, said, "I'm glad its over — I
like shooting guns and trees and shit,

but wow, this thing of blowing people
away is too much ..."
Freshman David Seidenwurn
laughed at the news of the war's end,
and added sarcastically, "It's a
tragedy. Now they have no chance for
freedom and self-determination.
American appeasement of foreign
governments has gone too far. It's just
like Munich — what are we going to do
next, give them Hawaii?"
Freshman Sarah Alfadl, who lived
in Egypt at the time of the 1967
Middle East war, said that from her
personal experience she was sure that
"the people in Vietnam are just
relieved."
Perhaps reaction was most
succinctly summarized by one elderly
woman. Told of the war's end, she said
only, "Thank God it's over."
(Other reporters contributing to this
story were Dan Fiduccia and William
Ross.)
Most students and faculty surveyed
by the Daily last night after the
surrender of the South Vietnamese
government not only seemed relieved
that the war was over but expected the
new government to be better for the
people than was the regime of former
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
Few students were overly surprised
at the news of the fall. Senior David
Antonuccio, summing up a
widely-held view, said, "It was
inevitable. You can't expect a fascist
government like Thieu's to stand up
without U.S. military aid."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall likewise was not surprised at
news of the surrender, saying 'i didn't
expect [President Duong Van "Big"]
Minh to fight to the death."
Marshall said the new South
Vietnamese government would likely
follow an independent course. "The
Vietnamese are easier going than the
Russians and Chinese. The
shopkeepers will probably remain in
business for awhile and the peasants
will probably be allowed to keep a
parcel of their own land while working
on collectives.
"The Vietnamese are passionately
independent. They are communists,
there is no doubt about that, but they
won't feel a slavish obligation to
model their system after the Chinese,"
Marshall said.
Disagreement
Director of East Asian Studies
Victor Li agreed that the new
government would likely be "very
independent."
But Stefan Possony, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, disagreed:
"The new government will either be
like that of the Ukrainian government
or like that of Poland. It doesn't make
that much difference. From now on,
Hanoi will give the orders in all of
Vietnam."
Both Marshall and Assoc. History
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke doubted that a
"bloodbath" would occur.
'Some Violence'
"There'll be some violence —
there's scores to be settled," Van
Slyke said. "But I don't foresee and
will be very surprised if there's any
bloodbath like that predicted by those
in our country who wanted the U.S. to
continue its involvement"
While most professors and students
seemed relieved at the outcome,
radical leaders past and present were
nothing short of overjoyed at the
outcome.
A meeting of the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC) burst into
applause when informed of the
surrender. Later, ARC released an
official statement saying, "It is a time
for great happiness and celebration.
"The history of this war has made
it abundantly clear that it was the U.S.
that was responsible for the long and
terrible bloodbath the lndochinese
people have suffered," the ARC
statement said.
4 A Victory'
David Harris, former student body
president and anti-draft activist, said,
"Vietnam hasn't fallen, but it has
risen."
But Bruce Smyth, editor of the
conservative Stanford Arena, said

independent. They are communists,
there is no doubt about that, but they
won't feel a slavish obligation to
model their system after the Chinese,"
Marshall said.
Disagreement
Director of East Asian Studies
Victor Li agreed that the new
government would likely be "very
independent."
But Stefan Possony, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, disagreed:
"The new government will either be
like that of the Ukrainian government
or like that of Poland. It doesn't make
that much difference. From now on,
Hanoi will give the orders in all of
Vietnam."
Both Marshall and Assoc. History
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke doubted that a
"bloodbath" would occur.
'Some Violence'
"There'll be some violence —
there's scores to be settled," Van
Slyke said. "But I don't foresee and
will be very surprised if there's any
bloodbath like that predicted by those
in our country who wanted the U.S. to
continue its involvement"
While most professors and students
seemed relieved at the outcome,
radical leaders past and present were
nothing short of overjoyed at the
outcome.
A meeting of the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC) burst into
applause when informed of the
surrender. Later, ARC released an
official statement saying, "It is a time
for great happiness and celebration.
"The history of this war has made
it abundantly clear that it was the U.S.
that was responsible for the long and
terrible bloodbath the lndochinese
people have suffered," the ARC
statement said.
4 A Victory'
David Harris, former student body
president and anti-draft activist, said,
"Vietnam hasn't fallen, but it has
risen."
But Bruce Smyth, editor of the
conservative Stanford Arena, said
that as a result of U.S. "no-win" war
policy, U.S. allies around the world
"may come to the conclusion that
while it is unpleasant to be an enemy
of the United States, to be its friend
may be fatal."
Few agreed that the surrender was
sad, however. History Prof. Mark
Mancall said, "It's the best thing that
could have happened — it should have
happened years agd."
Mancall said, "1 personally hope
that the two Vietnams are reunified as
soon as possible."
Poor Better Off
Asst. Political Science Prof. Harry
Harding predicted that "economically,
many of the poor will be better
off... We've been told that the fall of
South Vietnam would mean terrible
things. I'm curious to see if the dire
predictions of the '50s and '60s will be
borne out."
But most students, far from making
predictions, simply seemed happy that
the killing had ended at last. One
student, who claimed he was on an
acid trip, said, "I'm glad its over — I
like shooting guns and trees and shit,

but wow, this thing of blowing people
away is too much ..."
Freshman David Seidenwurn
laughed at the news of the war's end,
and added sarcastically, "It's a
tragedy. Now they have no chance for
freedom and self-determination.
American appeasement of foreign
governments has gone too far. It's just
like Munich — what are we going to do
next, give them Hawaii?"
Freshman Sarah Alfadl, who lived
in Egypt at the time of the 1967
Middle East war, said that from her
personal experience she was sure that
"the people in Vietnam are just
relieved."
Perhaps reaction was most
succinctly summarized by one elderly
woman. Told of the war's end, she said
only, "Thank God it's over."
