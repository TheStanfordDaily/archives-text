Last week, students ratified the proposal for a new
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) by a vote of 769 to 635,
vith 1057 students abstaining. We have discovered that the
reason some of these persons abstained was because of the
extremely misleading wording of the ballot.
Instructions on which box to mark on the SJC issue were
split into two paragraphs. The first paragraph contained
instructions on how to cast either a YES or a NO vote. The
second paragraph, labeled NO CHOICE, told students what
to do "if you do not wish to vote for this proposal."
This is obviously misleading, since it implies that by
checking the NO CHOICE box, students would be voting
against the proposal.
Because of the confusing wording, and because such an
unusual percentage of voters abstained, we urge the ASSU
Senate to carefully consider these issues before ratifying the
results of the referendum.
We admit that the students who carefully studied the
ballot could figure out the right way to vote. But we do not
think that voters should be expected to conduct their own
linguistic analyses at the polls. Wording must be clear and
unmistakable. We hope that, in the future, election officials
more carefully frame the words by which decisions are
made.
