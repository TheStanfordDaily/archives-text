# Unify America
## 
### 
As our Western civilization is
rapidly collapsing, according to
sober commentators around the
globe — which proves that at the
very least it is in perilous
condition — it is interesting to
observe the attitude of the
academic sounds of the decaying
middle class, the class which once
produced practically all the high
culture (and glorious it was) that
we have.
That attitude is often
bemusingly parallel to the one
depicted by Thomas Mann in his
agonized masterpiece Dr.
Faustus, for example through
Chaim Breisacher, a Jew who calls
for and sides with the "creatively
barbaric" wave of the future. It
turned out to be Nazism. Will
certain "with it" professors some
day be as embarrassed before a
renascent decency and dignity as
Heidegger and Jung came to be?
But the attitude is rather
varied. Some invest their
creativity in their work
exclusively and have little
radicalism left over for the public
realm. They tend to accept their
tradition, like T.S. Eliot, William
Butler Yeats or Hugh Kenner.
They make fairly mild gestures in
the direction of social change.
The majority of academics
seem to be in this latter category;
only a few are outright
conservatives of the William F.
Buckley stripe.
Then there are the handful of
faculty, usually younger, who are
trying to better things with talent,
sincerity and courage, exerting a
valuable critique agairfat some
ugly American institutions.
Should we be encouraging this
last attitude, or not? Generally, it
is almost impossible to grow as a
significant intellectual, scholar or
artist, and actively to adhere to
revolutionary doctrine. Even
Albert Camus had to make some
kind of either-or choice in later
years. And now there is a fresh

reason to endorse Camus'
position, which came to be firmly
anti-ideological, anti-totalitarian
and hence anti-revolutionary.
In the last few years, history
has made a wild qualitative leap.
There is a major crisis of faith in
freedom and culture. Although it
is clear that those nations which
put freedom above equality
generally ended with far more
equality — and on a higher
plane — than those which did not,
as Daniel P. Moynihan observes.
The middle-class intellectuals,
particularly in Britain, tended to
preach egalitarianism to the
former colonies with success.
The result is a mainly socialist
Third World where welfareism,
inter alia, has made economic
progress meager indeed, even
before the oil crisis which is
canceling it. These "developing"
states increasingly make common
cause with the totalitarians,
Russia and China, against
"imperialist" America, as if all the
failures were our fault.
In these circumstances I think
our intellectuals ought to stand by
the notion of a newly unified
America and the best of its
tradition as the struggle against
degradation moves massively to a
world stage.
I believe we have to find some
fairly middling point of coalition
in 1976, which we can identify as
a viable and dynamic,
world-conscious yet deeply
self-respecting the American Way. I
don't at the moment see either
party as capable of
providing the impetus and focus
for such a movement.
I don't know who can and am
not a bit sanguine about the
prospects. But I sure feel we
ought to be turning our minds and
hearts to it and not to the
relatively petty gripes of
yesterday.
