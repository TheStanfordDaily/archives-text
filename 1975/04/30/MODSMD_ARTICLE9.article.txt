# Hatred Won't Halt Mid-East Woes
## 
### 
At a time when there is an urgent need for
Jews and Arabs, especially Israelis and
Palestinians, to begin demythologizing each
other and to deal with their intertwined
histories without facile propaganda — it is
fatuous, boring, and ultimately futile to
argue about the terror of the past.
Thus my chagrin upon reading Ahmad
Abuel-Haija's "Zionists Commit Atrocities"
(Daily, April 23). For Abuel-Haija's column
either fails to substantiate or grossly distorts
the record of that same past he asks us to
closely examine; more importantly, it utterly
ignores the realities and dilemmas of the
present.
Abuel-Haija and I may have the luxury to
quibble about history; thousands of
Palestinian refugees and thousands of
Israelis worried about fighting in their fifth
full-scale war in a generation do not. Before
dealing briefly with that present, I must
discuss some phrases used by Abuel-Haija
which cloud, not clarify, the entire issue.
On "Zionists": while Abuel-Haija refers to
a specific Palestinian group, the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO), his use of
"Zionists" implies a monolithic movement
and even dredges up the old mythical
imagery of an "international Zionist
conspiracy." Now if Abuel-Haija really does
know the area and its history and current
events, he knows that "Zionists" as a
definable ideological whole no more exist
than "Palestinians" Neither movement is

monolithic.
Indeed, one of the current significant
differences between Israeli and Palestinian
politics is that the former has a strong, vocal,
and somewhat influential faction which
favors the establishment of a Palestinian
state. At a February press conference in New
York which I attended, Shulamit Aloni, a
member of that faction, said she favored
negotiations with the PLO provided it
recognized Israel's right to exist and was
representative of the Palestinian people. Yet
no recognized Palestinian leader, neither
Yassir Arafat nor others, is willing to grant
Israel's right to exist; further, each has
supported and condoned the use of terror
against Israeli civilians and against civilians
from outside the area.
Furthermore, I am disturbed that
Abuel-Haija has the chutzpah to accuse the
"Zionists" of this five months after Arafat's
United Nations appearance with a holster
belt on his waist, and,six weeks after the
attack on the Savoy Hotel.
But wait, let's stop this; it is so childish
and so dehumanizing to both sides to throw
about atrocity accusations and stories. For
each "Deir Yassim" and "Kafr Kassem"
Abuel-Haija cares to invoke, I can counter
with a Hebron, a Ben Yehudah street
bombing, a Munich and a Maalot. What is the
point and where will it get us in terms of
bringing about a just settlement for both
Israelis and Palestinians? What matters is to

David Szonyi

condemn any terror against any innocent
civilians.
Through a New York-based group called
Breira ("alternative"), I have for months
been among those condemning Palestinian
terrorism and Israeli counter-terrorism,
calling for a broader Zionist-Palestinian
dialogue, and supporting Israeli and other
"doves" favoring the establishment of a
Palestinian state. Indeed, I view my advocacy
of a Palestinian state as an integral part of my
Zionism. After all, the original U.N. partition
resolution of Nov. 29, 1947 saw the need for
and authorized the establishment of both a
Jewish and an Arab state within the borders
of what was then called "Palestine."
Since May 15, 1948, it has made no sense
to speak of "Zionists" when what one'means
is a real state called Israel, a state which has
absorbed several million refugees of its own
and survived numerous baptisms of blood.
It is time for Abuel-Haija and others to
finally come to terms with that state, to deal
with it as a political and human reality, not
as myth.
At long last, it is time to begin healing
the old and deep wounds. To do so, we have
to look at each other's history, think and talk
about each other in ways radically different
from the stereotypes and shibboleths of the
hate-saturated past.

Israel's right to exist; further, each has
supported and condoned the use of terror
against Israeli civilians and against civilians
from outside the area.
Furthermore, I am disturbed that
Abuel-Haija has the chutzpah to accuse the
"Zionists" of this five months after Arafat's
United Nations appearance with a holster
belt on his waist, and,six weeks after the
attack on the Savoy Hotel.
But wait, let's stop this; it is so childish
and so dehumanizing to both sides to throw
about atrocity accusations and stories. For
each "Deir Yassim" and "Kafr Kassem"
Abuel-Haija cares to invoke, I can counter
with a Hebron, a Ben Yehudah street
bombing, a Munich and a Maalot. What is the
point and where will it get us in terms of
bringing about a just settlement for both
Israelis and Palestinians? What matters is to

David Szonyi

condemn any terror against any innocent
civilians.
Through a New York-based group called
Breira ("alternative"), I have for months
been among those condemning Palestinian
terrorism and Israeli counter-terrorism,
calling for a broader Zionist-Palestinian
dialogue, and supporting Israeli and other
"doves" favoring the establishment of a
Palestinian state. Indeed, I view my advocacy
of a Palestinian state as an integral part of my
Zionism. After all, the original U.N. partition
resolution of Nov. 29, 1947 saw the need for
and authorized the establishment of both a
Jewish and an Arab state within the borders
of what was then called "Palestine."
Since May 15, 1948, it has made no sense
to speak of "Zionists" when what one'means
is a real state called Israel, a state which has
absorbed several million refugees of its own
and survived numerous baptisms of blood.
It is time for Abuel-Haija and others to
finally come to terms with that state, to deal
with it as a political and human reality, not
as myth.
At long last, it is time to begin healing
the old and deep wounds. To do so, we have
to look at each other's history, think and talk
about each other in ways radically different
from the stereotypes and shibboleths of the
hate-saturated past.
(David S2onyi is a graduate student in
history.)
At a time when there is an urgent need for
Jews and Arabs, especially Israelis and
Palestinians, to begin demythologizing each
other and to deal with their intertwined
histories without facile propaganda — it is
fatuous, boring, and ultimately futile to
argue about the terror of the past.
Thus my chagrin upon reading Ahmad
Abuel-Haija's "Zionists Commit Atrocities"
(Daily, April 23). For Abuel-Haija's column
either fails to substantiate or grossly distorts
the record of that same past he asks us to
closely examine; more importantly, it utterly
ignores the realities and dilemmas of the
present.
Abuel-Haija and I may have the luxury to
quibble about history; thousands of
Palestinian refugees and thousands of
Israelis worried about fighting in their fifth
full-scale war in a generation do not. Before
dealing briefly with that present, I must
discuss some phrases used by Abuel-Haija
which cloud, not clarify, the entire issue.
On "Zionists": while Abuel-Haija refers to
a specific Palestinian group, the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO), his use of
"Zionists" implies a monolithic movement
and even dredges up the old mythical
imagery of an "international Zionist
conspiracy." Now if Abuel-Haija really does
know the area and its history and current
events, he knows that "Zionists" as a
definable ideological whole no more exist
than "Palestinians" Neither movement is

monolithic.
Indeed, one of the current significant
differences between Israeli and Palestinian
politics is that the former has a strong, vocal,
and somewhat influential faction which
favors the establishment of a Palestinian
state. At a February press conference in New
York which I attended, Shulamit Aloni, a
member of that faction, said she favored
negotiations with the PLO provided it
recognized Israel's right to exist and was
representative of the Palestinian people. Yet
no recognized Palestinian leader, neither
Yassir Arafat nor others, is willing to grant
Israel's right to exist; further, each has
supported and condoned the use of terror
against Israeli civilians and against civilians
from outside the area.
Furthermore, I am disturbed that
Abuel-Haija has the chutzpah to accuse the
