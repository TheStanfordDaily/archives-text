For so many of us. the essential pain
generated by life in this Old Age comes
from the loss of being able to care And
if we are sincere with ourselves, we
see. undeniably, that this is true
Somehow, with the passing of time, we
have each lost our own way of feeling,
of caring for our individual lives and for
all of life as well Perhaps this is why,
as self-admitting cynics, we are now so
attracted to what we hear is the begin
ning of a New Age The news of this
Age sounds a predominant note of
hope to those of us who sense, deep
down, not simply that our lives should
be different, but, rather, that they could
enjoy a real sense of quality. The New
Age may not mean for us a trip to the
moon, aspirations of enlightenment, or
even overhauling our generally unsatis
fying lives. Instead, we are responding
to this note of hope as it touches an un
defined possibility in ourselves to find
a way back into the life of feeling and
caring which we all experienced to
some extent in our childhood To be
sincere again, we might even be temp
ted to call this New Age, the New
Childhood
