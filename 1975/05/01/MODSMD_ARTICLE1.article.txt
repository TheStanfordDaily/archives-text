# Ambassador Marks U.S. As Key Ally
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
A reduction in U.S. military
involvement in Europe would destroy
a precarious balance of power that is
vital to the process of detente, West
German Ambassador Bemdt von
Staden declared yesterday.
Speaking to about 100 people in
Annenberg Auditorium, Staden
claimed that relations between the
United States and Germany have never
been as good as they are at present.
"The tragic events (in South
Vietnam | will not impair our relations
with the U.S. and our confidence in
the U.S. as a friend and an ally," he
told reporters at an on-campus press
conference.
West Germany relies on American
friendship, in the form of troops and
nuclear deterrents, to guarantee a
balance of power on both sides of
U.S.-Soviet detente, Staden said.
"We believe there is no alternative
to the policy of detente, especially in a
nuclear age," Staden continued. But
he added that this view is not always
easy for Germans to accept.
Hope For Unity
"We accept the situation as it is, as
a basis for cooperation," he said. "But
we are not going to give up the fight
for self-determination nor the hope
that Germany will be reunited."
American troops are of
psychological and political importance
to the balance of power in Europe,
even though European nations provide
much support for their own defense,
Staden said. "We can't cut back on
defense. We feel that a reduction [in
the number of American troops]
would have great consequences. That's
not to say that they will never be able
to be reduced."
Staden said West German
policy-makers are concerned about
increases in the number of Warsaw
Pact troops while the number of
NATO troops remains constant. But
dissatisfaction with the NATO alliance
is a thing of the past, he added.
"The political cohesion of the
alliance is in the very satisfactory state
indeed," he said. "[But] we have
problems in the northern
Mediterranean, the southern flank of
NATO."
Staden cited tensions between
Greece and Turkey and said the
problems must be solved by the parties
involved.
The situation in Portugal is
"encouraging," he continued. "It's

unification of Germany.
most remarkable that a people, which
for 50 years had no opportunity to
participate in politics, had a voter
turnout of 92 percent. The popular
support gives us hope."
According to Staden, West
Germany is adopting a wait-and-see
posture in the Middle East and hoping
for a reopening of negotiations in
Geneva.
About 70 percent of West
Germany's oil is purchased from
countries in the Middle East, Staden
noted. "We are dependent on Middle
East oil. We have no hopes for a
program of energy independence," he
said.
Recent attempts to organize
international energy talks have
revealed "solidarity between
oil-producing nations and developing
nations," Staden said. "They feel they
have common interests in opposition
to industrialized nations."
Cooperation Needed
No European country, acting alone,
carries enough weight to influence
world politics, Staden said.
Cooperation between European
nations is "of tremendous importance
in a difficult economic time when the
danger of protectionism is greater than
ever," he added.
Asked about the future of the
Common Market, Staden said, "We see
the light at the end of the tunnel and

we hope the economy will turn up by
the end of the year."
Staden, a 54-year-old career
diplomat, served on the European
Economic Commission in Brussels and
helped plan the establishment of the
Common Market. His visit to Stanford
was part of his first major tour of the
U.S. since he was named ambassador
in 1973.

in a difficult economic time when the
danger of protectionism is greater than
ever," he added.
Asked about the future of the
Common Market, Staden said, "We see
the light at the end of the tunnel and

we hope the economy will turn up by
the end of the year."
Staden, a 54-year-old career
diplomat, served on the European
Economic Commission in Brussels and
helped plan the establishment of the
Common Market. His visit to Stanford
was part of his first major tour of the
U.S. since he was named ambassador
in 1973.
A reduction in U.S. military
involvement in Europe would destroy
a precarious balance of power that is
vital to the process of detente, West
German Ambassador Bemdt von
Staden declared yesterday.
Speaking to about 100 people in
Annenberg Auditorium, Staden
claimed that relations between the
United States and Germany have never
been as good as they are at present.
"The tragic events (in South
Vietnam | will not impair our relations
with the U.S. and our confidence in
the U.S. as a friend and an ally," he
told reporters at an on-campus press
conference.
West Germany relies on American
friendship, in the form of troops and
nuclear deterrents, to guarantee a
balance of power on both sides of
U.S.-Soviet detente, Staden said.
"We believe there is no alternative
to the policy of detente, especially in a
nuclear age," Staden continued. But
he added that this view is not always
easy for Germans to accept.
Hope For Unity
"We accept the situation as it is, as
a basis for cooperation," he said. "But
we are not going to give up the fight
for self-determination nor the hope
that Germany will be reunited."
American troops are of
psychological and political importance
to the balance of power in Europe,
even though European nations provide
much support for their own defense,
Staden said. "We can't cut back on
defense. We feel that a reduction [in
the number of American troops]
would have great consequences. That's
not to say that they will never be able
to be reduced."
Staden said West German
policy-makers are concerned about
increases in the number of Warsaw
Pact troops while the number of
NATO troops remains constant. But
dissatisfaction with the NATO alliance
is a thing of the past, he added.
"The political cohesion of the
alliance is in the very satisfactory state
indeed," he said. "[But] we have
problems in the northern
Mediterranean, the southern flank of
NATO."
Staden cited tensions between
Greece and Turkey and said the
problems must be solved by the parties
involved.
The situation in Portugal is
"encouraging," he continued. "It's

for 50 years had no opportunity to
participate in politics, had a voter
turnout of 92 percent. The popular
support gives us hope."
According to Staden, West
Germany is adopting a wait-and-see
posture in the Middle East and hoping
for a reopening of negotiations in
Geneva.
About 70 percent of West
Germany's oil is purchased from
countries in the Middle East, Staden
noted. "We are dependent on Middle
East oil. We have no hopes for a
program of energy independence," he
said.
Recent attempts to organize
international energy talks have
revealed "solidarity between
oil-producing nations and developing
nations," Staden said. "They feel they
have common interests in opposition
to industrialized nations."
Cooperation Needed
No European country, acting alone,
carries enough weight to influence
world politics, Staden said.
Cooperation between European
nations is "of tremendous importance
in a difficult economic time when the
danger of protectionism is greater than
ever," he added.
