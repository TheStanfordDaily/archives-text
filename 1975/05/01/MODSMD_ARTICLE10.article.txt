# Nozick's Case For Libertarianism
## 
### Bill Evers 
Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and
Utopia has just been given the National Book
Award in the category of philosophy. As
reviewers in journals from the New York
Review of Books to the Times Literary
Supplement in England have noted, Nozick's
book is a brilliant and intellectually
intriguing defense of libertarianism.
Nozick's book and John Rawls's Theory
of Justice have been received by academic
political theorists as the most important
English-language books of political
philosophy in decades. But while Rawls's
book fits quite well with the predominantly
social democratic beliefs of Anglo-American
university professors, Nozick is arguing for a
libertarian position that has not had much of
a hearing in scholarly journals and academic
circles for some time.
Indicative of Nozick's style of
argumentation is his criticism of what he calls
"patterned" principles of justice. Such
theories include those calling for the greatest
happiness for the greatest number, those
calling for maximizing the condition of the
worst-off, and many other theories.
According to these theories, one decides
whether justice has prevailed by looking at
the total picture of the holdings in the
society to see if the holdings are distributed
in some pattern that the theory says is just.
Having shown that many theories of
justice seek to implement some societal
pattern, Nozick proceeds to show the startled
reader how liberty upsets all patterned
distributions. He asks the advocates of all the
different possible patterned distributions to
imagine that their favorite distribution has

taken place.
Then, Nozick says, imagine that Wilt
Chamberlain, because he is such a favorite
with basketball fans, is able to sign the
following sort of contract with a team: At
each home game, 25 cents from the
price of each admission ticket to him.
During the season, the fans cheerfully
drop 25 cents in a special box
labeled with Chamberlain's name as they pay
for their tickets. They are excited about

seeing him play. It is worth the whole price
of admission to them.
By the end of the season, a million tickets
have been purchased for home games, and
Chamberlain nets $250,000. This is a much
larger income than the average in the
hypothetical society. It is larger even than
anyone else's. Is this new distribution unjust?
Any redistributionist would have to agree
that at the time of the first distribution in
the Chamberlain parable, the distribution was
just. It conformed to whatever was that
redistributionist's favorite pattern. But now
some people (basketball fans) have taken
some of the holdings to which they were

justly entitled and given them to somebody
else (Wilt the Stilt). Can anyone complain
about this new distribution on grounds of
justice?
Nozick then modifies his Wilt
Chamberlain story slightly to make clear that
the problem it highlights would arise in a
socialist society. He goes on to tell a similar
parable in which one can easily see how
legitimate private property in means of
production can come into existence in a
socialist society.
Having shown some of the difficulties
with patterned distributions, Nozick sketches
an unpatterned alternative: the entitlement
theory of justice. Under the entitlement
principle, instead of looking at the total
picture to see if a proper pattern is there, one
engages in historical inquiry to see if persons
are entitled to their present holdings.
Have they obtained them via transfers of
holdings which were in conformity with the
principles of just transfer? Were the original
appropriations of the holdings just? Or were
the holdings obtained by force or fraud?
Nozick's book has unusual discussions of
taxation, democracy, envy, Utopian
communities, charity, workers' control, the
labor theory of value and other topics. Those
who have never read an exposition of
libertarian political theory will find issues to
grapple with and problems to puzzle over. A
long-neglected political doctrine is now back
on the agenda for consideration.
