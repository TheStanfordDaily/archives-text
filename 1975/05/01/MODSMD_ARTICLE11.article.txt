# Cyclists Lose In 'Chicken'
## 
### 
It's hard to decide if the University's latest
fiasco is an example of outright disconcern for
student safety, if it is merely another incompetent
oversight or if it is an effort to assure us that
intramural sports are not discarded along with the
other programs of value at Stanford.
Our administration has recently employed its
creativity by inventing another game directed at
abusing the student. This new folly, aptly called
"bicycle-chicken," is a feeble attempt to bring the on
and off-campus students closer together.
However, when signing up for the sport, the
on-campus students had no idea that they were to
play a part in tlie game as hood ornaments of the
off-campus students.
The Rules
This is how the game is played: Traffic is
diverted from Mayfield Avenue into a dense area of
campus near the post office. Bicycles employ their
standard routes of travel between campus and
either Florence Moore or the Row.
As cars move along at 25 to 35 miles per hour
on the straightaway, bicycles are allowed to enter
either along the same route or from a side road.
Bicycles are generally given from two to three
seconds to cross the road before being hit broadside
or head on by anything ranging from a Volkswagen
to a four-ton mail truck.
A recent victim of the game, Paul Navar,
commented yesterday after being the fourth such

Bruce Blakely

casualty of bicycle-chicken. He remarked that the
game was a good idea on the University's part, but
a bit too dangerous for the two-wheeled
contestants.
Knocked Out
After being mauled by a VW, knocked
unconscious, picked up by an ambulance, and
carried to Cowell Student Health Center, his first
questions were: "Is that heap of metal on the chair
really my bicycle?" and "When will I get the feeling
back into my left arm, doctor?"
He also commented that the driver had totally
avoided the goal of the game, that is, better rapport
between on- and off-campus students, since he
failed to catch the driver's name (hit and run
accidents, of which this was one, are not permitted
according to the rules of the game).
Navar's suggestions for the future are to employ
one of the following solutions;
—do away with the game entirely and close off
the road to any further traffic;
—permit only the mail trucks to pass along the
road to the post office;
—provide each of the bicyclists with an armload
of stones, which he may use to unleash in the
direction of the car should the latter attempt an
infraction of the rules of bicycle-chicken for the
sole purpose of dismembering the unsuspecting
challenger.
