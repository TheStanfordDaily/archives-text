Another Apology

The Chaparral apologizes for any
problem caused by the election
date errors in our calendar. We
thought they were wrong when
we received them, so in
mid-March we asked ASSU
Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald whether they were
correct.
He stated that he didn't know
when the elections were. Since the
elections commissioner didn't
know when the elections were, we
gave up. Sorry.

Joy To The World
It is a time for great happiness
and celebration, for celebration of
the end of U.S. domination of
Indochina. Though many
newspapers are lamenting the
"fall" of Cambodia and Saigon,
we, along with many, many other
Americans and people all over the
world wish to express our joy at
the rising of Indochina.
The defeat of the United States
and its puppet Nguyen Van Thieu
means that, at long last, the
Indochinese people can live in
peace, can plant and harvest and
walk in the fields without the fear
of U.S. bombs.
The Indochinese people have
carried on an incredibly long and
difficult struggle for their freedom
â€” against French colonialism and
then against U.S. neocolonialism.
The history of this war has
made it abundantly clear that it
was the United States that was
responsible for the long and
terrible bloodbath the
Indochinese people have suffered.
We who have struggled against this
war can never forget the pain and
suffering of the people of
Indochina and can only feel joy
now that they have won freedom
and peace.
