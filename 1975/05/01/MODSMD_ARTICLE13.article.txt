## No Hope For Women At County Jail 
### SCOTT MORRISON 
There is a pervasive, almost
tragic sense of frustration and
despair among the women in the
San Bruno County Jail. Life for
them has long since become one
long, dreary and timeless routine,
from which there is no escape,
and little if any hope for the
future.
The 31 women incarcerated in
San Bruno are quite helpless —
and they know it. They have been
convicted primarily of
prostitution, narcotics, petty theft
and burglary — crimes which are
most frequently interrelated, and
which, for these women, are the
most difficult to avoid.
They are poor, unskilled and
largely uneducated. They live on
the streets the hard way.
Sometimes they survive; most
often they end up in jail.
No Diversions
Unlike the state prison for
women — the California
Institution for Women in Los
Angeles (Daily, April 21) — the
county jail offers no training, no
diversions from the monotony of
incarceration.
"As for rehabilitation, there
really isn't any," says Lt.
O'Callaghan, the matron. "A
person has to want to be
rehabilitated in the first place.
"Sometimes there's just not
much that we can do. They
behave themselves here. That's all
we're asking."
The endless hours behind bars
are spent cleaning up, playing
cards, watching television or
listening to music — all in one
large room.
Occasionally the women are
allowed into the exercise yard to
play volleyball. Otherwise, they
"just sit out there like robots," as
one inmate succinctly described
her imprisonment.
Came Right Back
The recidivism rate is
understandably high, given the
background of the women and the
nature of their offenses. As one
inmate puts it, "Hell, you get out
of here and what are you going to
do but come right back. If you
have nothing to go to outside,
how can you help it?"
According to O'Callaghan,
the recidivism rate runs between
50 and 60 percent, and almost
exclusively includes the women
previously busted for prostitution
and drugs.
The vicious cycle is broken
only periodically by a stretch in
jail, where hooked inmates
experience the horrors of going
"cold turkey." "They kick the
habit here," says O'Callaghan.
"They stay sick for a couple of
weeks and then they're okay. The
doctors do give them
tranquilizers to help ease the
pain."
Visitors
The women are allowed
visitors, but only on weekends
and holidays. Each visit lasts from
15 to 20 minutes and takes place
in a small room partitioned by a
double-screened wall with
one-by-two foot glass panels.
Sounds are barely audible
through the partition — there is
no touching, no sense of intimacy.

Many women don't allow their
children to visit them under these
conditions, for they feel it is
"degrading."
Beneath the rather passive
facade of prison life — violence
among women in prison is rare —
there exists a deep-rooted, yet
subtle sense of bitterness and
futility.
"Sure I'm bitter," says one
inmate, "but what good is it going
to do me to show it? I'm not going
to do nothing but get my own self
in trouble anyway.
"All you can do is sit back and

do your time. You just keep
everything inside of you."
Aren't Involved
Unlike their male counterparts,
women have historically been
reluctant to band together in an
effort to redress grievances. Rising
expectations among women on
the outside, and their subsequent
self assertion, have yet to seep into
the county jails as they have in
the more "sophisticated" state
prisons.
Pattv Holder, a director of the
prisoners' union in San Francisco,
attributes this lack of awareness
to the movement itself. "Most of

the women aren't involved with
feminist attitudes because it's a
middle class movement.
"You just don't see very many
upper and middle class women
doing time in the county jail." As
one inmate claims, "The whole
movement has been
overemphasized. I think a lot of
rich women have ruined it."
Yet as fundamental changes
occur in the outside society, they
will inevitably affect the women
and therefore the life in the
county jails as well. Life which is
now empty, meaningless and
without hope.

"As for rehabilitation, there
really isn't any," says Lt.
O'Callaghan, the matron. "A
person has to want to be
rehabilitated in the first place.
"Sometimes there's just not
much that we can do. They
behave themselves here. That's all
we're asking."
The endless hours behind bars
are spent cleaning up, playing
cards, watching television or
listening to music — all in one
large room.
Occasionally the women are
allowed into the exercise yard to
play volleyball. Otherwise, they
"just sit out there like robots," as
one inmate succinctly described
her imprisonment.
Came Right Back
The recidivism rate is
understandably high, given the
background of the women and the
nature of their offenses. As one
inmate puts it, "Hell, you get out
of here and what are you going to
do but come right back. If you
have nothing to go to outside,
how can you help it?"
According to O'Callaghan,
the recidivism rate runs between
50 and 60 percent, and almost
exclusively includes the women
previously busted for prostitution
and drugs.
The vicious cycle is broken
only periodically by a stretch in
jail, where hooked inmates
experience the horrors of going
"cold turkey." "They kick the
habit here," says O'Callaghan.
"They stay sick for a couple of
weeks and then they're okay. The
doctors do give them
tranquilizers to help ease the
pain."
Visitors
The women are allowed
visitors, but only on weekends
and holidays. Each visit lasts from
15 to 20 minutes and takes place
in a small room partitioned by a
double-screened wall with
one-by-two foot glass panels.
Sounds are barely audible
through the partition — there is
no touching, no sense of intimacy.

Many women don't allow their
children to visit them under these
conditions, for they feel it is
"degrading."
Beneath the rather passive
facade of prison life — violence
among women in prison is rare —
there exists a deep-rooted, yet
subtle sense of bitterness and
futility.
"Sure I'm bitter," says one
inmate, "but what good is it going
to do me to show it? I'm not going
to do nothing but get my own self
in trouble anyway.
"All you can do is sit back and

do your time. You just keep
everything inside of you."
Aren't Involved
Unlike their male counterparts,
women have historically been
reluctant to band together in an
effort to redress grievances. Rising
expectations among women on
the outside, and their subsequent
self assertion, have yet to seep into
the county jails as they have in
the more "sophisticated" state
prisons.
Pattv Holder, a director of the
prisoners' union in San Francisco,
attributes this lack of awareness
to the movement itself. "Most of

the women aren't involved with
feminist attitudes because it's a
middle class movement.
"You just don't see very many
upper and middle class women
doing time in the county jail." As
one inmate claims, "The whole
movement has been
overemphasized. I think a lot of
rich women have ruined it."
Yet as fundamental changes
occur in the outside society, they
will inevitably affect the women
and therefore the life in the
county jails as well. Life which is
now empty, meaningless and
without hope.

There is a pervasive, almost
tragic sense of frustration and
despair among the women in the
San Bruno County Jail. Life for
them has long since become one
long, dreary and timeless routine,
from which there is no escape,
and little if any hope for the
future.
The 31 women incarcerated in
San Bruno are quite helpless —
and they know it. They have been
convicted primarily of
prostitution, narcotics, petty theft
and burglary — crimes which are
most frequently interrelated, and
which, for these women, are the
most difficult to avoid.
They are poor, unskilled and
largely uneducated. They live on
the streets the hard way.
Sometimes they survive; most
often they end up in jail.
No Diversions
Unlike the state prison for
women — the California
Institution for Women in Los
Angeles (Daily, April 21) — the
county jail offers no training, no
diversions from the monotony of
incarceration.
