### Patty Fels 
Uh, great Bug Me, I am presenting a question to
you over which I have lost much sleep. Please, I
must know this. Is the manager's name at
Jack-in-the-Box really Be Weirdsma? —D.F.
Yes, it is. Be (pronounced Bay) is a nickname
for Bernardus, a common name in Holland from
where he has recently moved, he said.
*****
Life for me is one full time diet . . , but that's not
what I'm bugging you about. You see, I love ice
cream, and I fear that it's too fattening /or me to
indulge in. I've been told that the ice cream at
Foster's Freeze is made of skim milk and therefore
lower in calories than a regular Swensen's or 31
Flavors cone. Can you tell me exactly how many
calories are contained in a small Foster's cone?
Bikini season beckons. —B.G.G.
Foster's Freeze makes a product called
Soft-Serve ice milk. It is not made with skim milk,
according to Jackie Elliot, owner of the Palo Alto
Foster's Freeze, but is two percentage points under
the amount of butterfat contained in regular ice
cream. A small cone (10 cents) is 127.6 calories,
compared to approximately 180 calories for a
scoop of regular ice cream. The regional office for
the entire chain also said that the company is now
working on a formula to make the calorie content
even lower. Happy?

Why are campus maps always printed with north
pointing diagonally off to tfie bottom? Does this result

from some sort of Ptolcmaic view that the universe
rotates around Stanford? Because it violates the
usual map convention of north to the top, it results
in hordes of disoriented visitors and new students
(with the possibility of untold psychological
damage). —G.A.T.
The Ptolemaic theory isn't far off. Apparently,
there is no rational reason that Stanford maps are
drawn upside-down. But they always are.
Master Planner Oscar Nelson said that
reproductions of the original Olmsted drawings (the
landscape architect responsible for designing
the layout of the campus) are all upside-down. So
are the birds-eye perspectives of the campus that
were drawn to help the Stanfords visualize their
creation. Since then all maps have been drawn that
way.
"We've even persuaded the architects and the
landscape architects and the engineers to sort of
put their professional training on the shelf and
conform to north at the bottom when they're
working at Stanford," said Nelson proudly.
He admitted that the University has taken "a lot
of static from our friends in Menlo Park and the
county" for its odd perspective, however. "We've
had questions as to why Stanford is upside-down
and the rest of the world isn't," he said, adding
quickly "on maps, that is."
"It's sort of freaky, but at least there's a
consistency there," said Nelson, with a sigh.

county" for its odd perspective, however. "We've
had questions as to why Stanford is upside-down
and the rest of the world isn't," he said, adding
quickly "on maps, that is."
"It's sort of freaky, but at least there's a
consistency there," said Nelson, with a sigh.


Uh, great Bug Me, I am presenting a question to
you over which I have lost much sleep. Please, I
must know this. Is the manager's name at
Jack-in-the-Box really Be Weirdsma? —D.F.
Yes, it is. Be (pronounced Bay) is a nickname
for Bernardus, a common name in Holland from
where he has recently moved, he said.

Life for me is one full time diet . . , but that's not
what I'm bugging you about. You see, I love ice
cream, and I fear that it's too fattening /or me to
indulge in. I've been told that the ice cream at
Foster's Freeze is made of skim milk and therefore
lower in calories than a regular Swensen's or 31
Flavors cone. Can you tell me exactly how many
calories are contained in a small Foster's cone?
Bikini season beckons. —B.G.G.
Foster's Freeze makes a product called
Soft-Serve ice milk. It is not made with skim milk,
according to Jackie Elliot, owner of the Palo Alto
Foster's Freeze, but is two percentage points under
the amount of butterfat contained in regular ice
cream. A small cone (10 cents) is 127.6 calories,
compared to approximately 180 calories for a
scoop of regular ice cream. The regional office for
the entire chain also said that the company is now
working on a formula to make the calorie content
even lower. Happy?

Why are campus maps always printed with north
pointing diagonally off to tfie bottom? Does this result

from some sort of Ptolcmaic view that the universe
rotates around Stanford? Because it violates the
usual map convention of north to the top, it results
in hordes of disoriented visitors and new students
(with the possibility of untold psychological
damage). —G.A.T.
The Ptolemaic theory isn't far off. Apparently,
there is no rational reason that Stanford maps are
drawn upside-down. But they always are.
Master Planner Oscar Nelson said that
reproductions of the original Olmsted drawings (the
landscape architect responsible for designing
the layout of the campus) are all upside-down. So
are the birds-eye perspectives of the campus that
were drawn to help the Stanfords visualize their
creation. Since then all maps have been drawn that
way.
"We've even persuaded the architects and the
landscape architects and the engineers to sort of
put their professional training on the shelf and
conform to north at the bottom when they're
working at Stanford," said Nelson proudly.
He admitted that the University has taken "a lot
of static from our friends in Menlo Park and the
county" for its odd perspective, however. "We've
had questions as to why Stanford is upside-down
and the rest of the world isn't," he said, adding
quickly "on maps, that is."
"It's sort of freaky, but at least there's a
consistency there," said Nelson, with a sigh.
