This is that time of spring quarter
known as the blah period. Midterms have
just ended and the sunshine is luring you
away from your'books. We know how
you feel— you just want something
exciting to do. Since reading this column
is not among the most exciting activities,
and since there are few of those this
week, we'll be brief.
The week's most reasonably priced
bet occurs tonight at Winterland. The
Pacific Film Archives presents Monterey
Pop, Woodstock and Concert For
Bangladesh for (so we're told) under $3.
You may never want to hear or see
another rock concert again, but this is a
pretty good deal.
If you're searching for live rock, Bill
Graham presents Dave Mason and Alice
Stewart on Friday and Jackson Browne
("Doctor, My Eyes") and Phoebe Snow
("Poetry Man") on Sunday in San Jose.
For superb jazz, Dizzy Gillespie appears
Friday and Saturday at the Great
American Music Hall for a live recording
session. Songstress Vikki Carr ("Milk has
something for everybody") appears at
the Circle Star Theatre through Sunday.
For classical music on the Stanford
campus, violinist Ani Kavafian appears in
the Tresidder Lounges Friday night, as
part of the Office of Public Events'
Young Concert Artists series. Kavafian,
who holds a master's degree from the
Juilliard School, is "extraordinarily
gifted," according to the New York
Times. Also at Stanford, the Music
Department will present classical
Renaissance music on Tuesday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
For superb musical theater, try the
Civic Light Opera production of

Wonderful Town, opening Tuesday and
starring Nanette Fabray. It will run for
seven weeks (these productions usually
have trouble walking — sorry, but please
allow us our usual bad joke for the
week).
Speaking of a bad joke, it seems that
Sean Connery (you remember the
original James Bond) just can't keep out
of the spy business. He's at it again in
The Terrorists, his latest film showing at
the Hacienda Cinemas in Sunnyvale. One
reason Connery has not made any more
Bond films in recent years is that he and
studio officials believed he was too old
for the part. It should be interesting to
see if that thesis holds true here as well
(we'll bet it does).
For a film that earned an Oscar
nomination for "weirdest title of the
year," try The Apprenticeship of Duddy
Kravitz (didn't he used to write for the
Daily? No, that's Dan Kravetz) at this
week's Sunday Flicks. The story involves
"a man who sets out with (sic) trying to
be somebody," according to a press
release. Even the person who put out the
release appears to have been confused.
You probably think we've forgotten
sports — not so. On Saturday, don't miss
the track and field Big Meet against
Berkeley in the stadium. Even the
Dollies and Band will be there. Also, the
men's tennis team takes on the Bears on
the Varsity Courts.
Finally, if you haven't had enough
sports, watch Creature Features on
KTVU Saturday night at 9:30. This
week's flick is Godzilla and The Smog
Monster, the story of the founding of
use.

For a film that earned an Oscar
nomination for "weirdest title of the
year," try The Apprenticeship of Duddy
Kravitz (didn't he used to write for the
Daily? No, that's Dan Kravetz) at this
week's Sunday Flicks. The story involves
"a man who sets out with (sic) trying to
be somebody," according to a press
release. Even the person who put out the
release appears to have been confused.
You probably think we've forgotten
sports — not so. On Saturday, don't miss
the track and field Big Meet against
Berkeley in the stadium. Even the
Dollies and Band will be there. Also, the
men's tennis team takes on the Bears on
the Varsity Courts.
Finally, if you haven't had enough
sports, watch Creature Features on
KTVU Saturday night at 9:30. This
week's flick is Godzilla and The Smog
Monster, the story of the founding of
use.

This is that time of spring quarter
known as the blah period. Midterms have
just ended and the sunshine is luring you
away from your'books. We know how
you feel— you just want something
exciting to do. Since reading this column
is not among the most exciting activities,
and since there are few of those this
week, we'll be brief.
The week's most reasonably priced
bet occurs tonight at Winterland. The
Pacific Film Archives presents Monterey
Pop, Woodstock and Concert For
Bangladesh for (so we're told) under $3.
You may never want to hear or see
another rock concert again, but this is a
pretty good deal.
If you're searching for live rock, Bill
Graham presents Dave Mason and Alice
Stewart on Friday and Jackson Browne
("Doctor, My Eyes") and Phoebe Snow
("Poetry Man") on Sunday in San Jose.
For superb jazz, Dizzy Gillespie appears
Friday and Saturday at the Great
American Music Hall for a live recording
session. Songstress Vikki Carr ("Milk has
something for everybody") appears at
the Circle Star Theatre through Sunday.
For classical music on the Stanford
campus, violinist Ani Kavafian appears in
the Tresidder Lounges Friday night, as
part of the Office of Public Events'
Young Concert Artists series. Kavafian,
who holds a master's degree from the
Juilliard School, is "extraordinarily
gifted," according to the New York
Times. Also at Stanford, the Music
Department will present classical
Renaissance music on Tuesday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
For superb musical theater, try the
Civic Light Opera production of

Wonderful Town, opening Tuesday and
starring Nanette Fabray. It will run for
seven weeks (these productions usually
have trouble walking — sorry, but please
allow us our usual bad joke for the
week).
Speaking of a bad joke, it seems that
Sean Connery (you remember the
original James Bond) just can't keep out
of the spy business. He's at it again in
The Terrorists, his latest film showing at
the Hacienda Cinemas in Sunnyvale. One
reason Connery has not made any more
Bond films in recent years is that he and
studio officials believed he was too old
for the part. It should be interesting to
see if that thesis holds true here as well
(we'll bet it does).
