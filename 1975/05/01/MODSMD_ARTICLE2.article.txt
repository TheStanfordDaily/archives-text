# Spevak Slate Takes Senior Class Runoff
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
"Weird Walt" Spevak and running
mates Greg Smith, Marie Fiatarone
and Eric Standberg emerged victorious
over Dan Poston's slate in yesterday's
senior class runoff election by a
183-91 vote.
"I'm very happy that it's all over,"
said Spevak. "I hope that many people
who were upset by the campaign will
come and talk to us about it."
There were "universal feelings"
among participants in the election,
according to Spevak, that "things were
pretty screwed up. It seems
inconceivable that elections have been
going on year after year and something
like finances has remained so
ambiguous."
There are plans to meet and "clear
up ambiguities" in the election bylaws,
said Spevak.
Poston has begun circulating a
petition to revise the bylaws,
according to Spevak. "The whole slate
is behind the petition,"said Ping Ho, a
member of Poston's slate. "I don't
regret what happened. Hopefully,
people in future elections will benefit
from what happened to us."
Spevak suggested that the issue over
a spending limit on the campaign had
only come up now because of a
"revived interest" in senior class
officers taking a "more active role" in
campus events. This led the
participating slates to formulate
extensive programs and platforms
which were publicized through more
pamphlets and posters, he said.
Some of Spevak's plans for next
year include the compilation of a
senior address list, U-Haul trailer pools
to help seniors move out and a senior
auction. He hopes to facilitate
communication between seniors and
the class officers through the
establishment of a senior news letter.
General plans for a more
representative way of choosing the
commencement speaker at graduation

have also been discussed. By polling
the seniors, Spevak said he would like
to submit a list to the administrative
committee which approves possible
speakers. The list would include any
suggestions from the students. This
"approved list" would then be voted
on, and the person with the most votes
would be the first choice for a speaker.
Spevak said he would also like to
see "better alumni-student
relationships." He said he hopes to
initiate a program which would put
seniors in contact with alumni who
would be willing to give advice or
insight into their own careers.
