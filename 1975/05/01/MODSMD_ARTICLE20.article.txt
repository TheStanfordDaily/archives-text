# Washington's Set Disappoints
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO - With
only sparse chords from his
electric pianist to back him,
Grover Washington Jr. can play
smooth and lovely streams of
notes on his alto saxophone.
Washington plays his soprano
saxophone with as much sting as
anyone. And he is equally skilled
on the tenor sax — probably no
other jazz musician has mastered
all three saxophones as
completely as Grover.
But despite Grover's
instrumental wizardry, there was
quite definitely something missing
from the late Keystone Korner set
he played one night last week.
What was missing certainly
wasn't diversity — Grover and six
backing musicians tackled every
style from soft ballads to funk,
with a lot of mainstream jazz in
between. And shifting between
electric and acoustic instruments
didn't seem to rattle Washington's
(unidentified) bassist and pianist
at all.
But as the set progressed, the
weak points of Grover's approach
became apparent. He had picked a
weak set of compositions — it's
very difficult to play lyrically if
the melody is completely
undistinguished. Grover's

complete lack of verbal
communication with the audience
and the quick, abrupt transitions
between different styles of pieces
gave the set an uncomfortably
jerky quality.
Washington looked tired and
bored — but his own playing was
clearly the highlight of the
evening. Few saxophonists
sacrifice as much inventiveness to
pure technique as Washington —
the only reason he can pull it off
is that he has mastered so many
styles, although most of them are
quite conventional.
Grover's flugelhorn player and
second saxophonist, in contrast,
looked earnestly interested. Try as
they might, though, between
them they produced no
interesting solos, only exercises in
running quickly up and down the
scales. The exercises were very
long ones.
I'm not sure if these two
instrumentalists are regular
members of Washington's group
or not — their names weren't
announced either. But at any rate

they got no support at all from
Grover's pianist, drummer and
bassist, who seemed unconcerned
with changes in loudness or beat.
Their playing was often
inexcusably mechanical.
One obviously irregular
member, Keystone owner Todd
Barkan, provided a little variety to
the often drab music with his
assortment of percussion
instruments, mostly chimes and
bells.
Grover finally played with as
much spark as he has showed on
his recordings, but only in his last
two pieces. These two, both for
soprano sax and both in a funky
vein, sounded almost
immeasureably better than all
their disappointing predecessors.
Indeed soul and funk are what
Grover seems to do best. He has
played them well and often on
records, and his current album,
Mister Magic, is one of the
best-selling jazz albums of the
year.
But most of the magic was
surely missing last week.
