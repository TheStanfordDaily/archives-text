Ford To Ask For Refugee founds
WASHINGTON - Congress will be asked for funds to
care for perhaps up to 70,000 refugees from Indochina,
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said yesterday.
Elsewhere, Asst. Secretary of State Philip Habib said it
probably will cost the United States about $500 million
over a year to resettle the Vietnamese refugees.
Kissinger mentioned no costs when he talked briefly
with reporters after a closed-door session with a House
Appropriations subcommittee.
"We consider we have a moral obligation to tens of
thousands of people who worked with us, relying on us, for
15 years," he said.
The debate over the Vietnamese evacuation continued.
At the White House, Press Secretary' Ron Nessen, asked
about President Ford's authority to order Vietnamese
evacuated, quoted Ford as saying: "I did it because the
people would have been killed otherwise, and I'm proud of
it."
Nessen said Ford acted on moral, not legalistic grounds.
Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) said that Ford discussed the
evacuation during a moming White House meeting with
Republican congressional leaders, expressing his view that it
had been "very well done."
But at the Capitol, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) said
the evacuation was bungled, "and I think you have to start
with ambassador Graham Martin."
Kennedy said Martin failed to inform the administration
adequately on the deteriorating military position of the
Saigon government.
Evacuation Bill Abandoned
WASHINGTON — Congress wrestled nearly three weeks
over whether to give President Ford the power to send U.S.
evacuation forces into Saigon and finally gave it to him by
default.
Ford had already sent the evacuation forces in and the
House was within an hour of giving him Congress' final
approval of the authority Tuesday when the bill was pulled
off the floor as moot.
Speaker Carl Albert and other House leaders said they
wanted to drop the evacuation authority entirely and start
from scratch on a new aid bill for Indochinese refugees. But
no final decision has been made to do thai.
Some Democratic leaders say Congress deliberately
stalled action to force Ford to start getting Americans out
faster without troops.
But two drafters of the War Powers Act of 1973 say that
if Congress does not yet approve the authority even after
the fact it will have copped out on its new war-making
authority.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield said yesterday
Congress went slowly on the bill because it "insisted not only
on the w.thdrawal of American personnel but on a speedup
of that withdrawal as a precondition of further
appropriations."
Take-Home Pay To Increase
WASHINGTON — Beginning with paychecks dated
today, workers will get a few dollars more in their
take-home pay as part of a government effort to perk up the
economy by adding $17.6 billion to consumers' buying
power.
The bigger paychecks will be the result of an adjustment
of federal withholding tax tables to reflect tax cuts
approved by President Ford last month. The Internal
Revenue Service anticipates that because of the short time
permitted for employers to change to the new tables, some
workers will have to wait another week or so.

But generally, beginning with paychecks dated May 1 or
later a single person earning $10,000 a year will get a
weekly increase of $1.44.
For the childless married couple earning $20,000, the
weekly savings will be $2.94. A married worker supporting
a family of four on $15,000 a year will take home an extra
$4.73.
The overall effect will be to provide people with $7.8
billion to spend over the rest of the year.
And that extra money will be supplemented by $8.1
billion in tax rebates of up to $200 which start going out
next week. Another $1.7 billion worth of $50 checks for
Social Security recipients is expected to be distributed by
June.
Prosecution Presents SLA Evidence
SACRAMENTO — Cyanide-filled bullets, a stockpile of
ammunition and threatening messages from the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) were offered as evidence yesterday
in the Marcus Foster murder trial.
Defendants Russell Little and Joseph Remiro, both
avowed SLA members, sat quietly through the
presentation, a day after Little slugged prosecution witness
Christopher Thompson and was carried out of the
courtroom.
The prosecution said some of the ammunition was fired
from guns used to kill Foster, Oakland's superintendent of
schools, and wound his top aide, Robert Blackburn, in a
dimly lit parking lot Nov. 6, 1973.
The ammunition and documents were salvaged by
firemen from the ruins of a house in Concord that bumed
Jan. 10, 1974, half a day after Little and Remiro were
arrested.
The prosecution contends Little and two other SLA
members lived in the house under assumed names and were
visited by Remiro and other members of the group.

from scratch on a new aid bill for Indochinese refugees. But
no final decision has been made to do thai.
Some Democratic leaders say Congress deliberately
stalled action to force Ford to start getting Americans out
faster without troops.
But two drafters of the War Powers Act of 1973 say that
if Congress does not yet approve the authority even after
the fact it will have copped out on its new war-making
authority.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield said yesterday
Congress went slowly on the bill because it "insisted not only
on the w.thdrawal of American personnel but on a speedup
of that withdrawal as a precondition of further
appropriations."
Take-Home Pay To Increase
WASHINGTON — Beginning with paychecks dated
today, workers will get a few dollars more in their
take-home pay as part of a government effort to perk up the
economy by adding $17.6 billion to consumers' buying
power.
The bigger paychecks will be the result of an adjustment
of federal withholding tax tables to reflect tax cuts
approved by President Ford last month. The Internal
Revenue Service anticipates that because of the short time
permitted for employers to change to the new tables, some
workers will have to wait another week or so.

But generally, beginning with paychecks dated May 1 or
later a single person earning $10,000 a year will get a
weekly increase of $1.44.
For the childless married couple earning $20,000, the
weekly savings will be $2.94. A married worker supporting
a family of four on $15,000 a year will take home an extra
$4.73.
The overall effect will be to provide people with $7.8
billion to spend over the rest of the year.
And that extra money will be supplemented by $8.1
billion in tax rebates of up to $200 which start going out
next week. Another $1.7 billion worth of $50 checks for
Social Security recipients is expected to be distributed by
June.
Prosecution Presents SLA Evidence
SACRAMENTO — Cyanide-filled bullets, a stockpile of
ammunition and threatening messages from the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) were offered as evidence yesterday
in the Marcus Foster murder trial.
Defendants Russell Little and Joseph Remiro, both
avowed SLA members, sat quietly through the
presentation, a day after Little slugged prosecution witness
Christopher Thompson and was carried out of the
courtroom.
The prosecution said some of the ammunition was fired
from guns used to kill Foster, Oakland's superintendent of
schools, and wound his top aide, Robert Blackburn, in a
dimly lit parking lot Nov. 6, 1973.
The ammunition and documents were salvaged by
firemen from the ruins of a house in Concord that bumed
Jan. 10, 1974, half a day after Little and Remiro were
arrested.
The prosecution contends Little and two other SLA
members lived in the house under assumed names and were
visited by Remiro and other members of the group.

Ford To Ask For Refugee founds
WASHINGTON - Congress will be asked for funds to
care for perhaps up to 70,000 refugees from Indochina,
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said yesterday.
Elsewhere, Asst. Secretary of State Philip Habib said it
probably will cost the United States about $500 million
over a year to resettle the Vietnamese refugees.
Kissinger mentioned no costs when he talked briefly
with reporters after a closed-door session with a House
Appropriations subcommittee.
"We consider we have a moral obligation to tens of
thousands of people who worked with us, relying on us, for
15 years," he said.
The debate over the Vietnamese evacuation continued.
At the White House, Press Secretary' Ron Nessen, asked
about President Ford's authority to order Vietnamese
evacuated, quoted Ford as saying: "I did it because the
people would have been killed otherwise, and I'm proud of
it."
Nessen said Ford acted on moral, not legalistic grounds.
Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) said that Ford discussed the
evacuation during a moming White House meeting with
Republican congressional leaders, expressing his view that it
had been "very well done."
But at the Capitol, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) said
the evacuation was bungled, "and I think you have to start
with ambassador Graham Martin."
Kennedy said Martin failed to inform the administration
adequately on the deteriorating military position of the
Saigon government.
Evacuation Bill Abandoned
WASHINGTON — Congress wrestled nearly three weeks
over whether to give President Ford the power to send U.S.
evacuation forces into Saigon and finally gave it to him by
default.
Ford had already sent the evacuation forces in and the
House was within an hour of giving him Congress' final
approval of the authority Tuesday when the bill was pulled
off the floor as moot.
Speaker Carl Albert and other House leaders said they
wanted to drop the evacuation authority entirely and start

next week. Another $1.7 billion worth of $50 checks for
Social Security recipients is expected to be distributed by
June.
Prosecution Presents SLA Evidence
SACRAMENTO — Cyanide-filled bullets, a stockpile of
ammunition and threatening messages from the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) were offered as evidence yesterday
in the Marcus Foster murder trial.
Defendants Russell Little and Joseph Remiro, both
avowed SLA members, sat quietly through the
presentation, a day after Little slugged prosecution witness
Christopher Thompson and was carried out of the
courtroom.
The prosecution said some of the ammunition was fired
from guns used to kill Foster, Oakland's superintendent of
schools, and wound his top aide, Robert Blackburn, in a
dimly lit parking lot Nov. 6, 1973.
The ammunition and documents were salvaged by
firemen from the ruins of a house in Concord that bumed
Jan. 10, 1974, half a day after Little and Remiro were
arrested.
The prosecution contends Little and two other SLA
members lived in the house under assumed names and were
visited by Remiro and other members of the group.

Ford To Ask For Refugee founds
WASHINGTON - Congress will be asked for funds to
care for perhaps up to 70,000 refugees from Indochina,
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said yesterday.
Elsewhere, Asst. Secretary of State Philip Habib said it
probably will cost the United States about $500 million
over a year to resettle the Vietnamese refugees.
Kissinger mentioned no costs when he talked briefly
with reporters after a closed-door session with a House
Appropriations subcommittee.
"We consider we have a moral obligation to tens of
thousands of people who worked with us, relying on us, for
15 years," he said.
The debate over the Vietnamese evacuation continued.
At the White House, Press Secretary' Ron Nessen, asked
about President Ford's authority to order Vietnamese
evacuated, quoted Ford as saying: "I did it because the
people would have been killed otherwise, and I'm proud of
it."
Nessen said Ford acted on moral, not legalistic grounds.
Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.) said that Ford discussed the
evacuation during a moming White House meeting with
Republican congressional leaders, expressing his view that it
had been "very well done."
But at the Capitol, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) said
the evacuation was bungled, "and I think you have to start
with ambassador Graham Martin."
Kennedy said Martin failed to inform the administration
adequately on the deteriorating military position of the
Saigon government.
Evacuation Bill Abandoned
WASHINGTON — Congress wrestled nearly three weeks
over whether to give President Ford the power to send U.S.
evacuation forces into Saigon and finally gave it to him by
default.
Ford had already sent the evacuation forces in and the
House was within an hour of giving him Congress' final
approval of the authority Tuesday when the bill was pulled
off the floor as moot.
Speaker Carl Albert and other House leaders said they
wanted to drop the evacuation authority entirely and start
from scratch on a new aid bill for Indochinese refugees. But
no final decision has been made to do thai.
Some Democratic leaders say Congress deliberately
stalled action to force Ford to start getting Americans out
faster without troops.
But two drafters of the War Powers Act of 1973 say that
if Congress does not yet approve the authority even after
the fact it will have copped out on its new war-making
authority.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield said yesterday
Congress went slowly on the bill because it "insisted not only
on the w.thdrawal of American personnel but on a speedup
of that withdrawal as a precondition of further
appropriations."
Take-Home Pay To Increase
WASHINGTON — Beginning with paychecks dated
today, workers will get a few dollars more in their
take-home pay as part of a government effort to perk up the
economy by adding $17.6 billion to consumers' buying
power.
The bigger paychecks will be the result of an adjustment
of federal withholding tax tables to reflect tax cuts
approved by President Ford last month. The Internal
Revenue Service anticipates that because of the short time
permitted for employers to change to the new tables, some
workers will have to wait another week or so.

But generally, beginning with paychecks dated May 1 or
later a single person earning $10,000 a year will get a
weekly increase of $1.44.
For the childless married couple earning $20,000, the
weekly savings will be $2.94. A married worker supporting
a family of four on $15,000 a year will take home an extra
$4.73.
The overall effect will be to provide people with $7.8
billion to spend over the rest of the year.
And that extra money will be supplemented by $8.1
billion in tax rebates of up to $200 which start going out
next week. Another $1.7 billion worth of $50 checks for
Social Security recipients is expected to be distributed by
June.
