Military Academies
Applications for the three military service academies are
now available from the district office of Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park). Young men and women
desiring to attend Annapolis, the Air Force Academy or
West Point for the class that enters in 1976 should
complete applications now. Call McCloskey's office at

CORRECTION
The Daily incorrectly stated in a headline that PIRG's
campus offices would close. Instead, as explained in the
article, PIRG's office will remain open during the summer
and may continue operating next fall on a reduced scale.
