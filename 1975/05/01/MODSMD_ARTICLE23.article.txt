# Simon Notifies Lyman Of Change In IRS Race Discrimination Laws
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Treasury- Secretary William Simon
has notified President Richard Lyman
that, in response to a letter written by
Lyman, Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) regulations egainst racial
discrimination in higher education will
be changed to eliminate costly
record-keeping requirements.
In a Feb. 28 letter to Simon,
Lyman had termed the IRS proposals
"unnecessary, ill-conceived .. . and
oblivious to the web of regulation that
already exists" against racial
discrimination.
He noted that Stanford is currently
monitored for discrimination by the
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare (HEW) the Department of
Labor, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and the
California Fair Employment Practices
Commission.
"There is ample data available from
those agencies as to our policies, plans,
and practices to meet any reasonable
need of the IRS," Lyman wrote.
Under the plan proposed by the
IRS, each private institution would

have been required to keep its
applications for admission, financial
assistance and employment for three
years. A written explanation noting
reasons for rejecting any applicant
would also have to be retained.
Lyman also said that he objected to
the proposed regulations because of
their possible infringement on privacy.
"Neither the purpose or the access
was made clear," he explained. "It
would be unconscionable to hold the
private records of thousands of
individuals under so loose and
ambiguous a statement of purpose."
Simon replied that the IRS can
discharge its duties "faithfully and
fairly ... without imposing duplicative
and expensive administrative burdens
on private universities."
'Eliminate Interference'
He indicated that one of his highest
priorities has been to eliminate "costly
and unnecessary government
interference in the private sector.
"You may be sure that the
proposed rules will be modified to
eliminate for institutions such as yours
the duplicative burdens your letter

describes," Simon said.
Just a year ago, in a letter to HEW
Secretary' Caspar Weinberger, Lyman
persuaded federal administrators to
abandon a proposal to "establish and
use internal procedures for reviewing
curricula, designed ... to insure that
they do not reflect discrimination on
the basis of sex."
Noting the "compelling logic" in
Lyman's letter, Weinberger wrote that
the matter would be dropped.
