# COP Pledges Fight For Students
## 
### RON ELVING 
ASSU President-elect Lee
Rosenbaum this week pledged that the
new Council of Presidents (COFj will
"work to make the University realize
that students are not just consumers,
which seems to be the way the
administration regards us now.
"It won't happen overnight,"
Rosenbaum cautioned. He added that
"it's going to take a lot of work, not
just by the COP but by the whole
student body."
Rosenbaum, with running mates
Josie Jaramillo, Dave Galligan and
Charlotte Germane, campaigned on a
platform calling for increased student
involvement in University affairs and
improved . student-ASSU
communication.
Among their platform projects, the
four included a revitalized Course
Review, creation of a peer counseling
service, publication of a student
buying guide and a new
"communication committee" to
represent student opinion directly to
the COP.
'Information Gap'
Expanding on his slate's campaign
literature promise to "fight for

students' rights," Rosenbaum
explained that an "information gap"
currently exists between University
officials and students.
"The administration has us over a
barrel when they know more about
something than [students] do,"
Rosenbaum said. "Students have to
develop a level of expertise of their
own so they can make alternative
proposals at the committee level when
they object to a policy or project."
Rosenbaum said the new COP
members "are working on the basics of
a division of labor now. But we're
going to be a council of presidents —
my role is certainly not going to be
dominant — and we expect to work on
all issues together as well as
individually."
One of Jaramillo's individual
responsibilities will be the Legal
Counseling Office.
"Right now, students can't use the
Legal Counseling service for suits
against the University, and we're going
to try to change that," Jaramillo said.
Affirmative Action
Jaramillo also said she plans to
continue working on financial aid and
other minority student issues,
promising that the COP will
"repeatedly remind the University of
its responsibility to live up to the
affirmative action philosophy it so
glibly states."
Jaramillo said her greatest concern
is to make Stanford provide "a
broader base of education ... not just
academics but also an awareness of
what's going on in the larger world
outside that we will be entering."
Galligan will chair the ASSU
Nominations Committee and
otherwise participate in placing
students on University committees. He
stressed the need to "orient and
support" these students so they won't
be "uninformed, overawed, co-opted
or taken in."
Galligan said he would also have
primary responsibility for the
"communication committee." Galligan
outlined plans to "leave selection of
campus representatives to the

residences and contact off-campus
people through the off-campus
students' lounge."
Though Galligan said the new group
would have "no formal power," he felt
it could be used to "poll" student
opinion and strengthen the COP's
hand in dealing with the
administration.
'Course Review'
Germane said she would be starting
work "immediately" on the peer
counseling service and the Course
Review.
"Last year's Course Review was
poorly managed financially," Germane
said, "and (he editors weren't ready to
deal with innovative ideas from other
members of the policy board."
Germane referred to ASSU
profit-making as "a pretty high
priority" in the new COP's plans. "The
University is bound to cut ASSU
support way back," she said, adding
that "the ASSU should be financially
independent of the University
anyway."
Germane urged students to
participate in decisions "at the
committee level" because "after a
policy or project is announced, the
administration becomes involved in
'saving face.' "
