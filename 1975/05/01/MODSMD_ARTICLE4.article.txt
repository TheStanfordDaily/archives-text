# PRG Renames Saigon To Honor Ho Chi Minh
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) â€” North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong forces marched into
Saigon yesterday and put an abrupt
end to a century of Western influence
over the often-bloodied Indochina
peninsula.
To cheers and applause from some
South Vietnamese, communist-led
troops poured into the city and raised
the flag of the Provisional
Revolutionary Government (PRG)
over the presidential palace a few
hours after President Duong Van Minh
announced his government's
capitulation.
Soon after the takeover, normal
telephone and telegraph
communications with Saigon went
down.
Radio Saigon, the station of the
former South Vietnamese government,
fell silent shortly after midday
following several victory broadcasts by
the Viet Cong.
Ho Chi Minh City
A Hanoi broadcast monitored in
Tokyo stressed Viet Cong
announcements that Saigon had been
renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of

the late North Vietnamese leader.
President Minh, in a mid-morning
broadcast, ordered the South
Vietnamese armed forces to turn in
their arms. He was later returned to a
microphone by a jeepload of North
Vietnamese soldiers and issued another
order for the Saigon troops to turn in
their arms.
The subsequent whereabouts of
Minh, 59, was unknown.
A Viet Cong broadcast monitored
in Bangkok said much of the Mekong
Delta south and west of Saigon was
"not yet liberated." The broadcast
named a total of eight provinces that
had not surrendered.
'Appeal To The Enemy'
The broadcast made no mention of
fighting more than 12 hours after
Saigon capitulated, but said the Viet
Cong commander "appealed to the
enemy to submit themselves quickly
to his government."
Viet Cong troops were ordered to
provide security and the public was
told to remain calm. The broadcast
said all looting and robbery in the
capital had been halted.
In Saigon, many former soldiers
tried to lose themselves in the civilian
population. A police colonel walked
up to an army memorial statue,
saluted and shot himself. He died later
in a hospital.
The role of the United States,
which entered Indochina shortly after
French colonial rule collapsed with the
1954 defeat at Dienbienphu, ended
Tuesday in a massive helicopter airlift.
U.S. Ambassador Graham Martin,
about 900 other Americans and some
5600 Vietnamese were evacuated to
ships of the 7th Fleet in the South
China Sea.
Two weeks earlier, the U.S.

presence in neighboring Cambodia
came to a similar close a few days
before the Khmer Rouge marched into
Phnom Penh.
India and Sweden quickly
recognized the new Viet Cong
government and Australia and
Thailand said they were preparing to
do the same. Other non-communist
nations, including Britain and Japan,
indicated they were considering early
recognition of the PRO.
The Indian Parliament cheered
loudly when told of its government's
decision. Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, addressing a meeting of
British Commonwealth leaders in
Jamaica, blamed what she called
mistaken American estimates of the
strength of Indochinese nationalism
for the tragedy of Vietnam.
In Laos, the third country involved
in the 1973 Paris accords on
Indochina, a shaky truce is holding
although there have been a number of
clashes between rightist forces and the
communist-backed Pathet Lao. Both
sides share ministries in a coalition
government set up under the cease-fire
agreement signed on Feb. 21, 1973.
U.S. Relations Reviewed
Several other Asian countries are
reassessing their relations with the
United States in light of its withdrawal
from Vietnam and Cambodia.
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
has said he is reviewing agreements for
U.S. military bases in his country.
Thailand, which indicated recently
it wants U.S. troops based in the
country to be withdrawn over the next
year, now is treading a narrow path to
keep from antagonizing the new
Khmer Rouge rulers in neighboring
Cambodia.
