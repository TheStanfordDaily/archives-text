Students at Brandeis University
yesterday continued to occupy an
administrative building for the second
consecutive day in protest against
pending budget cuts.
The seizure came within a week of
the takeover of a Brown University
administration building, also in a
budget dispute.
The group that seized the building
at the Waltham, Mass. campus
represents a coalition of black, Latin-
American and Asian-American
students, although it also includes

white supporters.
"The group's leaders were served
with a preliminary restraining order,"
Brandeis Justice News Editor Randy
Levitt said last night. "The group
decided not to evacuate ... and the
negotiations ended tonight."
TYP Cutbacks
Primary among the demonstrators'
demands is the repeal of a plan to cut
back the Transitional Year Program
(TYP) from $82,000 to $35,000, as
proposed by the administration last
week.
The TYP l is designed to prepare
poorly educated students for college.
The administration yesterday agreed
to cut the program's budget to
$52,000.
Meanwhile, at San Jose State
University Tuesday, students briefly
occupied the office of the chairman of
the economics department. The
protesters left under threat of arrest
after a two-and-one-haif hour sit-in.
Students are demanding that five
radical economists be rehired. Among
the five fired professors is Stanford
SWOPSI Director Andy Parnes. Parnes
was unavailable for comment last
night.
'Political Purposes Only'
The protesters claim the firings
were made for political purposes only.
At Brandeis, the student
demonstrators demand:
Full financial aid compensation
for tuition, room and board increases
next year;
—No faculty layoffs made as a
result of budget constraints;
—TYP funding at this academic
year's $82,000 level;
~Total amnesty for those
occupying the building;
—Inclusion of Asian Americans in
the financial aid pool;
" No staff firings to obtain demands
listed above; and
—Faculty representation in
negotiations with the administration.
