# City Growth Debated In Palo Alto Election
## 
### FENTON JOHNSON First of Two Parts 
The direction of future Palo Alto
growth and slate politics have emerged
as the principle issues in the Palo Alto
City Council race — with a little love
thrown in on the side.
Though each of the 11
candidates officially declares him or
herself as in favor of "controlled
growth," the campaign again shapes up
as a struggle between traditional
"residentialist" and "establishment"

slates.
Three incumbents — Enid Pearson,
Alan Henderson, and Dick Rosenbaum
— along with challenger Larry Klein,
make up the "residentialist" slate,
sponsored by the Association for a
Balanced Community (ABC).
Incumbent Roy Clay leads the
"establishment" slate, "Palo Alto
'75," joined by Anne Witherspoon,
Scott Carey and Fred Eyerly.
In selecting the direction of Palo
Alto growth as the campaign's chief
issue, Pearson summarizes the
"residentialist" position.
"The issue is which candidates have
the guts to protect you and your
neighborhoods," she declares. "Palo
Alto is not for sale."
Old Issue?
Pointing to the last four years as a
time of "controlled growth with
neighborhood support," Pearson cites
as evidence the 50-foot height limit on
buildings, the open-space zoning of the
foothills and the revitalization of
downtown Palo Alto. Because of the
"residentialist majority," the
council's direction has been on
services, rather than on "rotating
chicken buckets and a Wilshire
Boulevard El Camino," she claimed.
Palo Alto '75 (PA '75) candidate
Scott Carey calls the direction of Palo
Alto growth an "old issue," since none
of the candidates now running favors
unlimited expansion. Instead, he calls
"the politics of this city" the principle
issue, accusing ABC incumbents of
hurting city interests by their "bloc
voting."
"Some candidates are worried more
about majority control than voting
responsibility," he claims.
Anne Witherspoon, one of Carey's
partners on the PA '75 slate, supports
his condemnation of the
residentialists' voting patterns, naming
"partisan party politics" as the major
threat to effective city government.
"It's time to throw the rascals out,"
she declares.
'Irrelevant'
ABC candidate Henderson dismisses
the bloc voting issue as irrelevant. "If
you have a 5-4 vote on an issue, the
four vote as a bloc, too," he says. He
characterizes the ABC candidates as
completely independent, declaring
that "not once in four years have we
gotten together before a meeting to
discuss our votes."
The Palo Alto drug abuse clinic and
the financial condition of the city have
also emerged as controversial issues.
Founded in 1972, the Palo Alto
drug control clinic, known as the
"Collective," has come under fire for
its stands on political issues, especially
its statement condemning the
evacuation of children from South
Vietnam.
While ABC candidates generally
disapprove of the political direction
the Collective has followed, they are
unanimous in praising its drug control
and rehabilitation program.
Objectives Met
"The current program has met all
objectives set for it by the city,"
Henderson claims, citing praise from
Stanford Medical School doctors as
proof of its success.
Pearson said she believes the
Collective should never have become
an issue, pointing out that it has less
than one percent of the city budget
allocated to it.
Though PA '75 candidates differ as
to the effectiveness of the drug
program, they unanimously call for an
end to its political pronouncements.
Incumbent Roy Clay says,"The
goal of the drug program must be the
measurable elimination of the
problem, not the maintenance of an
ever-increasing problem." Witherspoon
says the program is "not particularly
effective for the amount of money
spent on it," claiming that each case
treated costs $120.
PA '75 candidate Fred Eyerly sees
the condition of the budget as the
principle problem facing the city.
'Must Be Careful'
Henderson claims the city has $18
million in reserves, "more than any
other city of its size." Because of the
current economic slump, the city must
be careful in where and how it spends
its money, but currently runs no
danger of finishing the fiscal year 1975
in the red, he said.
Three independent candidates are
also running for election, though most
observers give them little chance of
success. Both Brian Devendorf and
John Fredrich emphasize
independence as their primary asset.
Scott Amoroso, a psychologist
researching "the nature of revelation,"
claims he represents "common sense —
bringing love to a council torn by
factions."

bringing love to a council torn by
factions."
The direction of future Palo Alto
growth and slate politics have emerged
as the principle issues in the Palo Alto
City Council race — with a little love
thrown in on the side.
Though each of the 11
candidates officially declares him or
herself as in favor of "controlled
growth," the campaign again shapes up
as a struggle between traditional
"residentialist" and "establishment"

slates.
Three incumbents — Enid Pearson,
Alan Henderson, and Dick Rosenbaum
— along with challenger Larry Klein,
make up the "residentialist" slate,
sponsored by the Association for a
Balanced Community (ABC).
Incumbent Roy Clay leads the
"establishment" slate, "Palo Alto
'75," joined by Anne Witherspoon,
Scott Carey and Fred Eyerly.
In selecting the direction of Palo
Alto growth as the campaign's chief
issue, Pearson summarizes the
"residentialist" position.
"The issue is which candidates have
the guts to protect you and your
neighborhoods," she declares. "Palo
Alto is not for sale."
Old Issue?
Pointing to the last four years as a
time of "controlled growth with
neighborhood support," Pearson cites
as evidence the 50-foot height limit on
buildings, the open-space zoning of the
foothills and the revitalization of
downtown Palo Alto. Because of the
"residentialist majority," the
council's direction has been on
services, rather than on "rotating
chicken buckets and a Wilshire
Boulevard El Camino," she claimed.
Palo Alto '75 (PA '75) candidate
Scott Carey calls the direction of Palo
Alto growth an "old issue," since none
of the candidates now running favors
unlimited expansion. Instead, he calls
"the politics of this city" the principle
issue, accusing ABC incumbents of
hurting city interests by their "bloc
voting."
"Some candidates are worried more
about majority control than voting
responsibility," he claims.
Anne Witherspoon, one of Carey's
partners on the PA '75 slate, supports
his condemnation of the
residentialists' voting patterns, naming
"partisan party politics" as the major
threat to effective city government.
"It's time to throw the rascals out,"
she declares.
'Irrelevant'
ABC candidate Henderson dismisses
the bloc voting issue as irrelevant. "If
you have a 5-4 vote on an issue, the
four vote as a bloc, too," he says. He
characterizes the ABC candidates as
completely independent, declaring
that "not once in four years have we
gotten together before a meeting to
discuss our votes."
The Palo Alto drug abuse clinic and
the financial condition of the city have
also emerged as controversial issues.
Founded in 1972, the Palo Alto
drug control clinic, known as the
"Collective," has come under fire for
its stands on political issues, especially
its statement condemning the
evacuation of children from South
Vietnam.
While ABC candidates generally
disapprove of the political direction
the Collective has followed, they are
unanimous in praising its drug control
and rehabilitation program.
Objectives Met
"The current program has met all
objectives set for it by the city,"
Henderson claims, citing praise from
Stanford Medical School doctors as
proof of its success.
Pearson said she believes the
Collective should never have become
an issue, pointing out that it has less
than one percent of the city budget
allocated to it.
Though PA '75 candidates differ as
to the effectiveness of the drug
program, they unanimously call for an
end to its political pronouncements.
Incumbent Roy Clay says,"The
goal of the drug program must be the
measurable elimination of the
problem, not the maintenance of an
ever-increasing problem." Witherspoon
says the program is "not particularly
effective for the amount of money
spent on it," claiming that each case
treated costs $120.
PA '75 candidate Fred Eyerly sees
the condition of the budget as the
principle problem facing the city.
'Must Be Careful'
Henderson claims the city has $18
million in reserves, "more than any
other city of its size." Because of the
current economic slump, the city must
be careful in where and how it spends
its money, but currently runs no
danger of finishing the fiscal year 1975
in the red, he said.
Three independent candidates are
also running for election, though most
observers give them little chance of
success. Both Brian Devendorf and
John Fredrich emphasize
independence as their primary asset.
Scott Amoroso, a psychologist
researching "the nature of revelation,"
claims he represents "common sense —
bringing love to a council torn by
factions."
