## 'Course Review' 
### 
The ASSU Course Review, since its revival in 1973, has
proven to be a valuable student service. In an era in which
the University has too few criteria by which to judge
teaching performance, the Course Review supplies needed
data on this topic, as well as informing students about
classes.
One would think that this year, with students up in arms
over tenure decisions, that members of the Course Review
Policy Board and the ASSU Senate would try especially hard
to keep the Course Review alive. Instead, in the guise of
making improvements, they may well have killed it.
The senate, backed by the board, voted to eliminate all
funding from the Program Fee for next year's Course
Review budget.
Such a move was crippling because each year's Course
Review has been funded in part from the following year's
budget, an unwise and dangerous policy. With circumstances
indicating that all of their work might be in vain, the three
editors resigned. We believe the editors were correct in
resigning, since their anticipated funding was cut off after
most of the work for the edition had been completed.
Following the resignations, die senate set up a special
committee to delve into the controversy. Unfortunately, the
committee is largely comprised of policy board members.
We question the value of letting people review their own
decision.
We realize that the senate withheld funds for the Course
Review because it wanted to see improvements made. The
suggested changes, which included free and more frequent
distribution of the Review and elimination of any
professorial control over course evaluation forms, are indeed
worthy of consideration.
But we fear that the senate, by using the tactic of
withholding funds for a project which was nearly complete,
has dealt the Course Review a potentially fatal blow.
