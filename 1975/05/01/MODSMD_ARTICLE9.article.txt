# BAC Shows Bias
## 
### 
United Stanford Employees
Union (USE) filed unfair labor
practice charges against the
University on April 9, the day
before representation elections
were to begin in the hospital. Part
of the charge was the role the
Black Advisory Committee (BAC)
had played during the election.
The BAC has made it its policy
to attack and prevent black
workers from supporting USE's
efforts to organize hospital
workers to collectively bargain
with the University.
This Personnel-controlled
committee has consistently
spouted management's anti-union
line and lies about the union. The
BAC was organized several years
ago by the hospital administration
to advise management on
"matters relating to minority
problems."
Unfair Chair
The chairperson of the
committee, Nadine Ellis, is not an
elected representative. She's hired
by Personnel ?nd she has strongly
influenced the committee since
its inception.
During the course of the
campaign, Ernest Lewis, elected
BAC representative from the
Dietary Department and a
staunch USE supporter, pressed
hard to have the committee hear
the union's position and not to
rely on management's claims
against USE.
The week of the election,
USE's publication Employees
Organize featured a center spread
of union supporters with their
individual statements "WHY

Beverly Tilghman

VOTE FOR U.S.E." Lewis stated
why USE had his full support.
The BAC began its campaign
of harassment and intimidation
to force Lewis to resign. Lewis's
response was firm, "as long as the
workers elect and support me I
will continue to function on the
committee in their behalf. The
First Amendment guarantees me
and my constituents the freedom
of speech, religion |and] political
views."
The BAC realized it could not
pressure Lewis to resign. So on
April 24, 1975, the BAC voted in
his absence to oust him from the
committee. This act by the BAC
exposes its intent to prevent
workers from effectively dealing
with the real problem—
management, not the union.
Workers' Support
Workers have organized a
petition of support for Lewis.
Black workers will not tolerate
the BAC working against their
interests.
The BAC has really shown its
true colors. Whose interests is it
representing? Why is it so
determined to prevent black
workers from organizing to solve
their problems? The BAC has
exposed itself. Its purpose is to
divide the workers and keep them
from dealing with their problems.
Lewis, black workers and the
union will not tolerate such
puppet organizations blocking the
road of workers struggling for
better pay, hours and working
conditions.

United Stanford Employees
Union (USE) filed unfair labor
practice charges against the
University on April 9, the day
before representation elections
were to begin in the hospital. Part
of the charge was the role the
Black Advisory Committee (BAC)
had played during the election.
The BAC has made it its policy
to attack and prevent black
workers from supporting USE's
efforts to organize hospital
workers to collectively bargain
with the University.
This Personnel-controlled
committee has consistently
spouted management's anti-union
line and lies about the union. The
BAC was organized several years
ago by the hospital administration
to advise management on
"matters relating to minority
problems."
Unfair Chair
The chairperson of the
committee, Nadine Ellis, is not an
elected representative. She's hired
by Personnel ?nd she has strongly
influenced the committee since
its inception.
During the course of the
campaign, Ernest Lewis, elected
BAC representative from the
Dietary Department and a
staunch USE supporter, pressed
hard to have the committee hear
the union's position and not to
rely on management's claims
against USE.
The week of the election,
USE's publication Employees
Organize featured a center spread
of union supporters with their
individual statements "WHY

Beverly Tilghman

VOTE FOR U.S.E." Lewis stated
why USE had his full support.
The BAC began its campaign
of harassment and intimidation
to force Lewis to resign. Lewis's
response was firm, "as long as the
workers elect and support me I
will continue to function on the
committee in their behalf. The
First Amendment guarantees me
and my constituents the freedom
of speech, religion |and] political
views."
The BAC realized it could not
pressure Lewis to resign. So on
April 24, 1975, the BAC voted in
his absence to oust him from the
committee. This act by the BAC
exposes its intent to prevent
workers from effectively dealing
with the real problem—
management, not the union.
Workers' Support
Workers have organized a
petition of support for Lewis.
Black workers will not tolerate
the BAC working against their
interests.
The BAC has really shown its
true colors. Whose interests is it
representing? Why is it so
determined to prevent black
workers from organizing to solve
their problems? The BAC has
exposed itself. Its purpose is to
divide the workers and keep them
from dealing with their problems.
Lewis, black workers and the
union will not tolerate such
puppet organizations blocking the
road of workers struggling for
better pay, hours and working
conditions.

hospital organizer.)
