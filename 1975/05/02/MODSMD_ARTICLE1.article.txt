# For Latin, Asian Americans
## C-UAFA Rejects Aid Proposal 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids
(C-UAFA) has rejected one
recommendation from Students for
Equity (SFE), but is taking action on
another of the group's suggestions,
according to C-UAFA Chairman Paul
Green.
C-UAFA has tabled an SFE
recommendation that Asian American
and Latin American students be
granted minority status so they could
receive the "economic inducements,
support services and other benefits"
given to the three currently designated
minorities here. These are blacks,
chicanos and Native Americans.
But, according to Green, C-UAFA
is acting on a recommendation to set
up an independent monitoring
committee to review financial aid,
recruitment and admissions policies.

The committee would:
—be composed of non-C-UAFA
members, but would report to
C-UAFA;
—have special access to data related
to financial aid, recruitment and
admissions policies;
—have as members an equal number
of representatives from each ethnic
group, to be chosen by a body such as
the Ethnic Minority Task Force on
Financial Aid;
—be chosen this spring, so it could
begin its task in the fall.
Won't Increase
Because the University has already
made a decision on the minority
question for this year, "we have
decided not to pursue any increase in
the number of designated minorities at
this time," said Green.
He also noted that the
"substructuring of the University

along ethnic lines seems unwise."
Besides resulting in "duplication and
inefficiency" of efforts, it would lead
to the reverse argument that the
interests of majority students are best
served only by majority personnel, he
argued.
Green said that in his view, the
University's emphasis has been on
"balance and mixture in the form of
individuals, rather than a mosaic of
groups."
Problems vs. Groups
He suggested that SFE address itself
to "problems" rather than "groups,"
and urged groups for which "cultural shock"
is most prevalent to consider proposing
solutions that can "be applied across
all ethnic lines."
Said Green, "cultural shock is not
confined to minorities or any
economic group."
But Green is more open to the
review committee. "C-UAFA is
attempting to establish a joint effort
with the Office of [the Dean of]
Student Affairs relative to the
commitment to the currently
designated minorities," because the
issues raised by SFE "transcend
G-UAFA's jurisdiction," Green said.
Not Discussed
But David Asai, a student member
of C-UAFA, commented that the
question of setting up a monitoring
committee has not been discussed by
C-UAFA since its Feb. 25 meeting,
when C-UAFA decided that such a
committee should be established.
There will probably be an interim
arrangement for the group designed
during spring quarter, to be followed
by "something more definite" in the

fall, Green said.
It would not be possible to include
SFE in the arrangement because SFE
is "an ad hoc body, and it doesn't
seem to be within the Senate rules to
delegate authority to an ad hoc body,"
Green said.
Dissatisfied
Members of SFE have expressed
dissatisfaction with the reasons for
which their recommendations were
not fully accepted. Green had outlined
his reservations in a four-page letter to
the group.
"Students for Equity is not asking
to sit on a sub-committee of
C-UAFA," said Loren Bloch, a
member of SFE's Core Committee.
"We just want a monitoring committee
independent of C-UAFA."
Observing that Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff serve as
cx officio members of C-UAFA and
that they too must have particular
interests, Bloch suggested that
members from SFE could sit in as
cx officio members.

Bloch also observed that there
seems to be a "communication gap"
between Green and other University
officials, and the SFE.
"We agree completely that we
should treat people in terms of general
human problems," Bloch said.
"We are not saying that differences
are the prime consideration. But the
differences that exist between students
are a problem, and that's what the
University refuses to recognize."
As an example of the University's
"failure" to recognize the problems
involved in differences. Bloch pointed
to a passage in Green's letter, which
said it would be "fruitful" to considei
cultural shock as a "hazard to all
students."
