## Opinions Overseas Budget Needs Input Now 
### Jim Wascher 
It's no secret that the University doesn't
really have enough money to continue
funding all of its programs at current levels.
Nor would it come as a surprise to anyone
that the outlook for the next few years is
equally dismal.
Budget crunches aren't news here —
they've become a way of life. Besides,
budgets, deficits and the like are boring. Who
wants to waste any time wading through
columns of figures or deciphering hundreds
of pages of bureaucratic jargon?
If students know what's good for them,
however, they'll take the time to sort out the
facts. The fate of a favorite program might
very well turn out to be at stake.
Take, for instance, the report made to the
Faculty Senate last week by Overseas Studies
Director Marc Mancall and Education Prof.
James March, chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Studies Programs.
Massive Cutback
These gentlemen told the senate that by
the 1978-79 school year, the Overseas
Studies program must cut $800,000 from its
$2.1 million budget base — a reduction of
nearly 40 percent over the next three years.
These cuts will be particularly difficult to
make if inflation and the devaluation of the
dollar continue in Europe: unfavorable
economic developments such as these tend to
reduce the real impact of cuts that are made.
According to the Overseas Studies staff,
there are three principal options available to
them when it comes time to make the cuts.
Elimination?
First, certain overseas programs might be
eliminated entirely. Obviously, this is the

least attractive alternative; nevertheless, it
remains a very viable one at this point. If one
of Mancall's newly revamped programs
proves noticeably less successful than the
others, then it could rise quickly to the top
of the "expendable" list.
Second, Stanford might allow students
from certain other universities to enroll at its
overseas programs, provided that the other
universities pay for their fair share of the
programs' fixed expenses. This option would

reduce the number of spots available overseas
for Stanford students at the very time when
interest in studying abroad is climbing
rapidly here,.
Third, the University might choose to
combine several common-language programs
at one center. Hypothetically, then, it might
move the current Berlin program to
Beutelsbach, where it would operate
alongside the program available there now.
This might also reduce the total possible
enrollment overseas.
Inevitable Choice
None of the alternatives is particularly
appealing. But, unless conditions change

drastically, the Overseas Studies people
eventually must select one, or a combination
of options. And that's where you, the
students, come in.
As March's committee studies the possible
cuts in the coming months, student opinion
could prove to be a critical factor.
Corb Smith, assistant director of overseas
studies, emphasized that, in Nov. 1973,
rational presentations by
Stanford-in-Germany alumni significantly
altered Mancall's thoughts about the future
of that program, persuading him to keep it in
Beutelsbach, rather than moving it to Berlin.
, Input Needed
Similar concern — and input — from
alumni of all overseas programs will
definitely shape the important decisions
which are required by the $800,000 budget
cut. But people should start getting involved
in the process now, before the decisions are
made, instead of whining after it's too late.
Students can play an even more important
service by persuading the administration and
faculty that the Overseas Studies program is,
as President Richard Lyman said this week,
expandable and contractable — and not
expendable.
That sort of persuasion is important
because certain high-level people here have
been traditionally skeptical when it comes to
assessing the value of having any campuses
abroad. The friends of the Overseas Studies
program should always try to remind these
skeptics that Overseas Studies are a major
reason why this University is so special.

Budget crunches aren't news here —
they've become a way of life. Besides,
budgets, deficits and the like are boring. Who
wants to waste any time wading through
columns of figures or deciphering hundreds
of pages of bureaucratic jargon?
If students know what's good for them,
however, they'll take the time to sort out the
facts. The fate of a favorite program might
very well turn out to be at stake.
Take, for instance, the report made to the
Faculty Senate last week by Overseas Studies
Director Marc Mancall and Education Prof.
James March, chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Studies Programs.
Massive Cutback
These gentlemen told the senate that by
the 1978-79 school year, the Overseas
Studies program must cut $800,000 from its
$2.1 million budget base — a reduction of
nearly 40 percent over the next three years.
These cuts will be particularly difficult to
make if inflation and the devaluation of the
dollar continue in Europe: unfavorable
economic developments such as these tend to
reduce the real impact of cuts that are made.
According to the Overseas Studies staff,
there are three principal options available to
them when it comes time to make the cuts.
Elimination?
First, certain overseas programs might be
eliminated entirely. Obviously, this is the

least attractive alternative; nevertheless, it
remains a very viable one at this point. If one
of Mancall's newly revamped programs
proves noticeably less successful than the
others, then it could rise quickly to the top
of the "expendable" list.
Second, Stanford might allow students
from certain other universities to enroll at its
overseas programs, provided that the other
universities pay for their fair share of the
programs' fixed expenses. This option would

reduce the number of spots available overseas
for Stanford students at the very time when
interest in studying abroad is climbing
rapidly here,.
Third, the University might choose to
combine several common-language programs
at one center. Hypothetically, then, it might
move the current Berlin program to
Beutelsbach, where it would operate
alongside the program available there now.
This might also reduce the total possible
enrollment overseas.
Inevitable Choice
None of the alternatives is particularly
appealing. But, unless conditions change

drastically, the Overseas Studies people
eventually must select one, or a combination
of options. And that's where you, the
students, come in.
As March's committee studies the possible
cuts in the coming months, student opinion
could prove to be a critical factor.
Corb Smith, assistant director of overseas
studies, emphasized that, in Nov. 1973,
rational presentations by
Stanford-in-Germany alumni significantly
altered Mancall's thoughts about the future
of that program, persuading him to keep it in
Beutelsbach, rather than moving it to Berlin.
, Input Needed
Similar concern — and input — from
alumni of all overseas programs will
definitely shape the important decisions
which are required by the $800,000 budget
cut. But people should start getting involved
in the process now, before the decisions are
made, instead of whining after it's too late.
Students can play an even more important
service by persuading the administration and
faculty that the Overseas Studies program is,
as President Richard Lyman said this week,
expandable and contractable — and not
expendable.
That sort of persuasion is important
because certain high-level people here have
been traditionally skeptical when it comes to
assessing the value of having any campuses
abroad. The friends of the Overseas Studies
program should always try to remind these
skeptics that Overseas Studies are a major
reason why this University is so special.

It's no secret that the University doesn't
really have enough money to continue
funding all of its programs at current levels.
Nor would it come as a surprise to anyone
that the outlook for the next few years is
equally dismal.
