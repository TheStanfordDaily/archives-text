Since Stanford traditionally
has been linked with the city of
Palo Alto, it seems fitting that
Stanford should be represented in
the Palo Alto Bicentennial
Redwood Grove.
Charles Benjamin Wing,
professor of civil engineering at
Stanford and famed for designing
the Stanford stadium, had a deep
personal interest in the redwoods.
He started a move in 1894 to
preserve the remarkable trees of
the Santa Cruz Mountains and was
one of the fathers and guardians
of Big Basin Redwoods State
Park.
Large Sites
Sempervirens Fund, a local
conservation organization, has set
aside magnificent 10-acre grove
sites in Big Basin as memorials.
One of these is the Palo Alto
Grove. Stanford students and
faculty may contribute by having
a standing redwood in the Grove
named for the University or for
separate organizations on campus.
Trees range in price according to
size, starting at $100.
Students and faculty may also
have young trees planted in ,Big
Basin Redwoods State Park in
their own name, or as a gift to a
friend or relative for a birthday,
wedding anniversary, birth of a
child etc. These trees are $5, $10
and $20, according to size.
Conservation
The location oÂ£ each tree is
recorded by name of donor and
person to whom the tree is
dedicated. Young people, eager to
learn about conservation and the
role of trees in the balance of
nature, plant them during the wet
winter months and water them
during the late summer and early
fall when the ground is dry.
All contributions are used to
acquire other forest land, whose
redwoods are facing the ax, to
bring it into the park. The
tax-deductible donations are
matched dollar for dollar by the
state of California. Free
brochures may be obtained by
calling 968-4509 or writing to
Sempervirens Funds, Box 1141,
Los Altos, Calif. 94022.
