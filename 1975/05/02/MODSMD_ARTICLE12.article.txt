# Letters-George Wallace, 'Misquotation'

More On Wallace
Editor:
The news that George Wallace
was to be awarded the President's
Medal by St. John's College High
School in Washington, D.C. struck
me as it did Curt Chumbley in his
article in the Daily of April 25 (If
Wallace 'Contributes' to
Education," Then I'm A .. .) as a

tragic mistake.
As a graduate of the school and
as a member of the Christian
Brothers, the impact was even
more personal. I was particularly
concerned by the knowledge that,
in the eyes of many, St. John's
giving such an award to George
Wallace would be seen as the
Christian Brothers doing the same
thing.

This concern was realized in
Chumbley's labeling us all as
victims of having "trouble
remembering"' and as a group with
a "case of selective forgetting."
While I have no doubts that
among the 3000 American
Brothers and the 15,000 Brothers
around the world there are those
who might so suffer, those that I
know are as appalled by the
announcement a<; Chumbley.
The honoring of Wallace for his
"contribution to education" was
proposed by the Parents Club of
the school and approved by the
president, who is a Christian
Brother. The final decision, then,
is essentially that of one man.
I wholeheartedly agree that
this man and the people who
proposed the award have
demonstrated a remarkable
insensitivity and a high degree of
"selective forgetting."
It does not logically follow
that the Christian Brothers as a
group should be saddled with the
stigma of proclaiming Wallace and
what he stands for as an example
to be approved, followed and
imitated. Neither the Brothers nor
the Catholic Church are the
monoliths such thinking seems to
assume.

'Misquoted'
Editor:
In four years at Stanford I have
been "quoted" by the Daily three
times: 1 have been misquoted each
time.
However, this latest incident is
by far the most blatant. When
Daily reporter Viae Kershner
asked my reactions to the
surrender of South Vietnam,
remembering the previous
misquotes, I decided to write out
my comments and to keep a copy
of what I wrote.
According to the April 30
Daily, I "said that as a result of
U.S. 'no-win' war policy. U.S.

allies around the world 'may come
to the conclusion that while it is
unpleasant to be an enemy of the
United States, to be its friend may
be fatal.' "
This is my actual statement:
"I think it is a very sad day for
South Vietnam and the United
States, but it is perhaps the
inevitable result of pursuing a
no-win war policy.
"I think that a number of
nations in the world, such as
Thailand, Portugal, Western
European nations and, perhaps
soon, Israel, will look back on
Vietnam and note that while the
Russians and Chinese were
pumping $1.5 billion into North
Vietnam, we were turning off the
tap. I think that they may come

to the conclusion that while it is
unpleasant to be an enemy of the
United States, to be its friend may
be fatal."
The statement suggesting that
being a friend of the U.S. may be
fatal (paraphrasing a recent
statement by Henry Kissinger)
clearly does not refer to a no-win
policy; anyway, I do not believe
such a statement to be true. But I
do believe that our failure to
supply aid we had promised may
induce some of our allies to
believe that it is.
I would hope that in the future
such creative writing could be left
to the Chaparral; at least their
stuff is funny.

among the 3000 American
Brothers and the 15,000 Brothers
around the world there are those

know are as appalled by the
announcement a<; Chumbley.
The honoring of Wallace for his
"contribution to education" was
proposed by the Parents Club of
the school and approved by the
president, who is a Christian
Brother. The final decision, then,
is essentially that of one man.
I wholeheartedly agree that
this man and the people who
proposed the award have
demonstrated a remarkable
insensitivity and a high degree of
"selective forgetting."
It does not logically follow
that the Christian Brothers as a
group should be saddled with the
stigma of proclaiming Wallace and
what he stands for as an example
to be approved, followed and
imitated. Neither the Brothers nor
the Catholic Church are the
monoliths such thinking seems to

'Misquoted'
Editor:
In four years at Stanford I have
been "quoted" by the Daily three
times: 1 have been misquoted each
time.
However, this latest incident is
by far the most blatant. When
Daily reporter Viae Kershner
asked my reactions to the
surrender of South Vietnam,
remembering the previous
misquotes, I decided to write out
my comments and to keep a copy
of what I wrote.
According to the April 30
Daily, I "said that as a result of
U.S. 'no-win' war policy. U.S.

allies around the world 'may come
to the conclusion that while it is
unpleasant to be an enemy of the
United States, to be its friend may
be fatal.' "
This is my actual statement:
"I think it is a very sad day for
South Vietnam and the United
States, but it is perhaps the
inevitable result of pursuing a
no-win war policy.
"I think that a number of
nations in the world, such as
Thailand, Portugal, Western
European nations and, perhaps
soon, Israel, will look back on
Vietnam and note that while the
Russians and Chinese were
pumping $1.5 billion into North
Vietnam, we were turning off the
tap. I think that they may come

to the conclusion that while it is
unpleasant to be an enemy of the
United States, to be its friend may
be fatal."
The statement suggesting that
being a friend of the U.S. may be
fatal (paraphrasing a recent
statement by Henry Kissinger)
clearly does not refer to a no-win
policy; anyway, I do not believe
such a statement to be true. But I
do believe that our failure to
supply aid we had promised may
induce some of our allies to
believe that it is.
I would hope that in the future
such creative writing could be left
to the Chaparral; at least their
stuff is funny.

The news that George Wallace
was to be awarded the President's
Medal by St. John's College High
School in Washington, D.C. struck
me as it did Curt Chumbley in his
article in the Daily of April 25 (If
Wallace 'Contributes' to
Education," Then I'm A .. .) as a

tragic mistake.
As a graduate of the school and
as a member of the Christian
Brothers, the impact was even
more personal. I was particularly
concerned by the knowledge that,
in the eyes of many, St. John's
giving such an award to George
Wallace would be seen as the
Christian Brothers doing the same
thing.

This concern was realized in
Chumbley's labeling us all as
victims of having "trouble
remembering"' and as a group with
a "case of selective forgetting."
