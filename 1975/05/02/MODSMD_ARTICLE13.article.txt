There's no telling what the ASSU Senate
will do.
If the senators find no reason to toss out
any of the ASSU election results, a month of
hectic electioneering will be over.
On the other hand, the senate wouldn't
have to look too far to find technical
violations in the handling of some of the
votes.
At least' two problems have yet to be
considered:
—the senior class election was held
Wednesday only, while ASSU by-laws specify
that "all elections shall be held on two
consecutive days, except at overseas
campuses";
—the wording of the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) proposal was ambiguous, at
best. One voting option specified that
students should check it if they did not wish
to vote "for" the plan. Unfortunately,
students who assumed such a vote meant

"no" were recorded as abstaining.
The senate is unlikely to overturn the
senior class results, because it specifically
authorized ASSU Elections Commissioner
Tom Fitzgerald to hold a one-day election and
because one senior class ballot was already
thrown out after two slates allegedly violated
campaign spending rules.
Senate reaction to the SJC mixup is less
predictable. Some senators, sick of the three
elections already held this month, may vote
against another ballot. Others may be
influenced by the unusually large number of
recorded abstentions.
The 1057 abstentions outnumbered both
"yes" and "no" votes.
Fitzgerald has borne the brunt of many of the
criticisms of election procedures.
Procedural Blasts
Representatives from all six slates in the
original senior class ejection expressed

displeasure with Fitzgerald's handling of the
first election, and a Daily editorial blasted him
for ignorance of election procedures, rules and
precedents.
Fitzgerald defended himself by calling the
Daily editorial one "that is misleading,
contains exaggerations, and, in fact, plainly
lies."
The ASSU Senate invalidated the first
senior class election after Fitzgerald had told
two slates that the spending limit was $200.
Traditionally, the election was a "low-key"
one, so the other four slates apparently
assumed the limit was $50. The ASSU by-laws
are ambiguous on the subject.
Lise Pfeiffer, this year's senior class
president, expressed mild surprise that this
year's campaign was run at such a high pitch.
Small Bucks
"Last year we spent about $9.35. I don't
remember any limit. . . We thought the
campaign should be run on the issues," she
commented.

Fitzgerald has received some praise for one
innovation. The computer-assisted tally
procedure used for this campaign drastically
reduced the work required to count ballots.
The results were amazingly quick and
accurate, producing two counts that agreed to
within one vote in a fraction of the time that
hand-counting method consumed.
Mechanical Flaws?
But Mike Dornheim, a co-terminal student
majoring in mathematics and
aeronautics/astronautics, criticized the choice
of ballot-counting machines. Dornheim used
the same type of machine when he took
Electrical Engineering 181.
"The machinery being used is
unsatisfactory," Dornheim said at the time.
"Anyone familiar with this machine can only
laugh at its use."
Will archivists some day dig up the 1975
time capsule and, in recounting the ballots,
discover that the SJC lost in a landslide? It's
unlikely, but only time will tell.

that "all elections shall be held on two
consecutive days, except at overseas
campuses";
—the wording of the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) proposal was ambiguous, at
best. One voting option specified that
students should check it if they did not wish
to vote "for" the plan. Unfortunately,
students who assumed such a vote meant

"no" were recorded as abstaining.
The senate is unlikely to overturn the
senior class results, because it specifically
authorized ASSU Elections Commissioner
Tom Fitzgerald to hold a one-day election and
because one senior class ballot was already
thrown out after two slates allegedly violated
campaign spending rules.
Senate reaction to the SJC mixup is less
predictable. Some senators, sick of the three
elections already held this month, may vote
against another ballot. Others may be
influenced by the unusually large number of
recorded abstentions.
The 1057 abstentions outnumbered both
"yes" and "no" votes.
Fitzgerald has borne the brunt of many of the
criticisms of election procedures.
Procedural Blasts
Representatives from all six slates in the
original senior class ejection expressed

displeasure with Fitzgerald's handling of the
first election, and a Daily editorial blasted him
for ignorance of election procedures, rules and
precedents.
Fitzgerald defended himself by calling the
Daily editorial one "that is misleading,
contains exaggerations, and, in fact, plainly
lies."
The ASSU Senate invalidated the first
senior class election after Fitzgerald had told
two slates that the spending limit was $200.
Traditionally, the election was a "low-key"
one, so the other four slates apparently
assumed the limit was $50. The ASSU by-laws
are ambiguous on the subject.
Lise Pfeiffer, this year's senior class
president, expressed mild surprise that this
year's campaign was run at such a high pitch.
Small Bucks
"Last year we spent about $9.35. I don't
remember any limit. . . We thought the
campaign should be run on the issues," she
commented.

Fitzgerald has received some praise for one
innovation. The computer-assisted tally
procedure used for this campaign drastically
reduced the work required to count ballots.
The results were amazingly quick and
accurate, producing two counts that agreed to
within one vote in a fraction of the time that
hand-counting method consumed.
Mechanical Flaws?
But Mike Dornheim, a co-terminal student
majoring in mathematics and
aeronautics/astronautics, criticized the choice
of ballot-counting machines. Dornheim used
the same type of machine when he took
Electrical Engineering 181.
"The machinery being used is
unsatisfactory," Dornheim said at the time.
"Anyone familiar with this machine can only
laugh at its use."
Will archivists some day dig up the 1975
time capsule and, in recounting the ballots,
discover that the SJC lost in a landslide? It's
unlikely, but only time will tell.

RERUN—Students thoughtfully marking
ballots were a familiar sight last month.
There's no telling what the ASSU Senate
will do.
If the senators find no reason to toss out
any of the ASSU election results, a month of
hectic electioneering will be over.
On the other hand, the senate wouldn't
have to look too far to find technical
violations in the handling of some of the
votes.
At least' two problems have yet to be
considered:
—the senior class election was held
Wednesday only, while ASSU by-laws specify
that "all elections shall be held on two
consecutive days, except at overseas
campuses";
