## Choice Of Moynihan As Speaker Raises Questions About Selection Process

y Moynihan's selection in February, a
y majority of anthropology professors and
a graduate students, along with all but seven

y statements calling Moynihan unacceptable
J to the black community and other ethnic
\ groups.
( Moynihan has been assailed because of
y his statements in The Negro Family on the
J deterioration of the black family and for
) advising the Nixon administration to
adopt a policy of "benign neglect" in
y regard to the problems of the black
P community.
No Consultation
Moynihan's opponents also pointed out
that faculty members in Moynihan's
academic area and minority representatives
were not consulted during the selection
process.

The group that chose Moynihan was
composed of some unidentified
administrators and three senior class
officers. Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig told the Harvard
Crimson that faculty members were not
involved because they have not wanted to
be part of the process in previous years.
But the Moynihan controversy suggests
that faculty members should be included in
the future.
The senior class officers claim they
informally polled seniors on their choices
for a speaker, but most seniors don't
remember being contacted.
Rosenzweig has stated that Moynihan
has been considered as a potential
commencement speaker for some years.
But several critics, doubting whether every
graduating class consistently would have
suggested Moynihan, have wondered just
who really did choose him.
Moynihan Is . . .
Rosenzweig has defended Moynihan,
claiming that none of the critics have
specifically attacked Moynihan's policies.
Rosenzweig also differed with the
anthropology professors who called
Moynihan an economist; Rosenzweig noted
that Moynihan's degree was in political
science (the professors have also claimed
that Moyniha.i is neither an anthropologist
nor a sociologist, and therefore not

qualified to write in these areas).
Rosenzweig also asserted that the critics
never examined Moynihan's "benign
neglect" statement in context.
Yet Rosenzweig has never discussed the
main arguments concerning Moynihan's
alleged racism. In his Daily column early
last month, Rosenzweig simply stated that
"in a university the answer to alleged error
is truth, and in that spirit" an inquiry into
Moynihan's other policies would be "in
order."
Moynihan, whose speech will be on the
subject of "The Future of Higher
Education," has termed the protests
"vulgar and ignorant." He has been
unavailable for further comment for the
past week.
This week, anthropology professors
challenged Moynihan's scholarship in detail
and objected to Stanford's sanctioning his
national and international policies by
giving him a forum at graduation.
Based largely on an article Moynihan
authored recently in Commentary some
have called Moynihan an imperialist.
Moynihan wrote that "international
liberalism and its processes have enormous
recent achievements to their credit."
Moynihan termed the multinational
corporation "the most creative
international institution of the 20th

century."
Topping off this whole unbelievable
affair are news reports that Moynihan
could be nominated as the next U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations. People
who were upset over Moynihan's speaking
here have become incensed at
the possibility of giving him the U.N. as his
next speaking platform.
The protest seems to be snowballing.
Over the past few weeks chicano faculty,
staff and students have passed a resolution
supporting the black community in protest
of Moynihan. Native American students
have also voiced support.
Black seniors reportedly are considering
an alternative commencement, and some
faculty have said that they won't attend
graduation. The black seniors are also
working on a campaign to inform black
parents why they are opposed to
Moynihan.
If the protest gains enough support,
graduation day could be remembered for a
visible lack of support of faculty, students
and parents.
Harvard has a system by which seniors
vote on a graduation speaker, and the
wi.irer is invited. Such a system may
have its share of problems too, but a
method which includes more than a
handful of seniors and administrators
should be considered here.

No Consultation
Moynihan's opponents also pointed out
that faculty members in Moynihan's
academic area and minority representatives
were not consulted during the selection
process.

The group that chose Moynihan was
composed of some unidentified
administrators and three senior class
officers. Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig told the Harvard
Crimson that faculty members were not
involved because they have not wanted to
be part of the process in previous years.
But the Moynihan controversy suggests
that faculty members should be included in
the future.
The senior class officers claim they
informally polled seniors on their choices
for a speaker, but most seniors don't
remember being contacted.
Rosenzweig has stated that Moynihan
has been considered as a potential
commencement speaker for some years.
But several critics, doubting whether every
graduating class consistently would have
suggested Moynihan, have wondered just
who really did choose him.
Moynihan Is . . .
Rosenzweig has defended Moynihan,
claiming that none of the critics have
specifically attacked Moynihan's policies.
Rosenzweig also differed with the
anthropology professors who called
Moynihan an economist; Rosenzweig noted
that Moynihan's degree was in political
science (the professors have also claimed
that Moyniha.i is neither an anthropologist
nor a sociologist, and therefore not

qualified to write in these areas).
Rosenzweig also asserted that the critics
never examined Moynihan's "benign
neglect" statement in context.
Yet Rosenzweig has never discussed the
main arguments concerning Moynihan's
alleged racism. In his Daily column early
last month, Rosenzweig simply stated that
"in a university the answer to alleged error
is truth, and in that spirit" an inquiry into
Moynihan's other policies would be "in
order."
Moynihan, whose speech will be on the
subject of "The Future of Higher
Education," has termed the protests
"vulgar and ignorant." He has been
unavailable for further comment for the
past week.
This week, anthropology professors
challenged Moynihan's scholarship in detail
and objected to Stanford's sanctioning his
national and international policies by
giving him a forum at graduation.
Based largely on an article Moynihan
authored recently in Commentary some
have called Moynihan an imperialist.
Moynihan wrote that "international
liberalism and its processes have enormous
recent achievements to their credit."
Moynihan termed the multinational
corporation "the most creative
international institution of the 20th

century."
Topping off this whole unbelievable
affair are news reports that Moynihan
could be nominated as the next U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations. People
who were upset over Moynihan's speaking
here have become incensed at
the possibility of giving him the U.N. as his
next speaking platform.
The protest seems to be snowballing.
Over the past few weeks chicano faculty,
staff and students have passed a resolution
supporting the black community in protest
of Moynihan. Native American students
have also voiced support.
Black seniors reportedly are considering
an alternative commencement, and some
faculty have said that they won't attend
graduation. The black seniors are also
working on a campaign to inform black
parents why they are opposed to
Moynihan.
If the protest gains enough support,
graduation day could be remembered for a
visible lack of support of faculty, students
and parents.

have its share of problems too, but a
method which includes more than a
handful of seniors and administrators
should be considered here.
