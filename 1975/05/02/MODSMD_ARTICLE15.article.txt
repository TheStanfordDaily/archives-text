# Voters Reject ARLO Assessment Backers Scramble For Support
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Students have refused to fund the Action
Research Liaison Office (ARLO), a program
which would seem to integrate education with
community needs.
The entire concept of ARLO — projects
which are both useful and flexible to
individual interests — is in line with recent
demands for social relevance and student
input to education. Last quarter, students
vigorously defended the similarly innovative
SWOPSI and SCIRE programs.

Students apparently feel that this type of
option should be included in their tuition, not
supported bv an extra ASSU fee assessment.
Although ARLO has received the
University's approval as a three-year
experimental program, it has not received
promises of economic support. And judging
from the curtailment of SCIRE as the budget
tightens, student-initiated projects are not
high on the list of University priorities.
Because neither the University nor the
students are paying for ARLO, the group

plans to apply for grants for off-campus
foundations. ARLO co-director Bill Lefand
points out that the community is a legitimate
source of funds because of community
benefits from ARLO projects.
This year, $13,000 of ARLO's $19,200
budget came from "outside" foundations.
ARLO had planned to get half of next year's
funds from outside the University.
Jamie Newton, one of ARLO's founders,
predicts that this foundation money will be
harder to get without the demonstrated
support of the Stanford community.
No Charge
Co-director Edith Eddy says that it would
not be feasible to actually charge the
organizations using ARLO. Groups which
could afford to pay consultants could go to
professionals, she says, while ARLO is
designed to mobilize free student labor for
non-profit community groups.
As University, student and community
funding sources are eliminated, ARLO could
consider alternative structures which might be
less expensive or more appealing to students.
Currently, most of the budget goes to pay
staff members who coordinate project ideas
and recruit faculty sponsors.
Although Leland admits that a
student-staffed office could work, he says that
the University would find it hard to justify
giving units for office coordinating work.
Job Aid Possibility
No one seems to have seriously considered
paying students to coordinate ARLO. This
type of organizing work could ease some of
the demand for part-time campus jobs while
providing students with valuable""real-worid"
experience and contacts.
So far, no moves have been made to
integrate ARLO's function into existing
innovative programs. Newton points out that
the University is not now open to
budget-straining additions, and Eddy
emphasizes that ARLO had planned to be
independent for at least three years.
And in the meantime, a valuable student
and community service is still looking for
somebody to support it.
