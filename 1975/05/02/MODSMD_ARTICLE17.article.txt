## Movies: Deaf Dumb And Blind, And Under Water 
### 
Today's musical question is
what is Tommy, by The Who? Or
is it who is Tommy, by the What?
It all depends on how much sleep
you've had the night before. Is
Tommy (a) anti-religion, (b)
pro-religion, (c) anti-war, (d)
confusing, or (e) totally
unintelligible? Answer (e) is a
little harsh — I'd opt for (d).
If someone happened to walk
off the street into Tommy
without knowing the story, he
would be assaulted by bright,
flashy, Disneyland-like sets and
costumes that often look like
someone at Sherwin-Williams
freaked out.
I have to admit that in order to
understand Tommy, I had to
resort to reading other critics'
reviews. John Wasserman in
Friday's Chronicle determined
Peter Townshend's story to be
one of redemption. And Art
George in Sunday's Chronicle says
Ken Russell's film is anti-religious.
Apparently, they're as
confused as I am but don't want
to admit it. The scenes with
Marilyn Monroe statues in her
famous Seven Year Itch stance as
a goddess (which she is to us, in
another sense of the word) are
obviously sacrilegiously intended.
Who?
And vhen Tommy as pinball
champion comes to be considered
a god with millions of followers, is
he a god, or Jesus Christ, or who?
Or what?
If this is anti-religious, why
does Tommy seem to be
redeemed by the rising sun at the
end? Tommy, then, can be taken
any way you want — it's open to
interpretation. As for me, I don't
know what to make of it.
Other confusions abound. The
beginning is filled with idyllic
scenes between Ann-Margret (as
Nora, Tommy's mother) and
Robert Powell (as Captain Walker,
Tommy's father) to show their
love, and Nora is very upset when
he is missing in action and
presumed dead.
Why, then, when he returns to
find her and Oliver Reed (as
Frank, the lover) in bed and
Tommy witnesses Frank killing

Captain Walker, is Nora's first
thought not about the murder,
but that Tommy must not be
allowed to remember it, the
traumatic incident that causes him
to go psychosomatically deaf,
dumb and blind.
Loving Wife?
This is a loving wife? What is
the purpose of Paul Nicholas's
sadistic cousin Kevin or Keith
Moon's perverted Uncle Ernie,
other than to inject sadism and
perversion for their own sake into

the picture?
And the purpose, please, for
the perfectly disgusting fantasy
scene in Nora's bedroom when her
television explodes chocolate,
beans, and soapsuds? It was
almost enough to induce nausea.
As in opera, every line is sung. In
the beginning, the voices are
looped so poorly that it is
embarrassing. As for the acting,
Oliver Reed is villainous enough
but he can't sing, which I think
should be a prerequisite for opera.

Ann-Margret's make-up man
may have been stoned, because
she looks like a hag in the
beginning and gets younger as the
movie progresses, and that's not
the way I've always heard it
should be.
Roger Daltrey looks like a
refugee from Creature Features.
Many rock stars make cameo
appearances (Eric Clapton, Peter
Townshend, John Entwhistle),
and the best, I think, is Elton John
as the Pinball Wizard, while Tina

Turner as the Acid Queen looks as
if she's in the throes of epilepsy.
Jack Nicholson joins in
momentarily as Tommy's doctor.
I think the best condition to be
in when you see this is zonked out
of your head, which is the state
screenwriter/director Ken Russell,
(Mahler, Women In Love)
probably was in when he made it.
Perhaps then the lights and music
sound better.
The visual effects were
boggling, if you happen to enjoy
phantasmagorical visions of
rainbows. I prefer, however, not
to be assaulted by animated and
cinematic effects that give me
splitting headaches.
It may not be your idea of a
good time either, but if it is, go
enjoy it and be sure and tell me
what it means when you figure it
out.

Some actors enjoy doubling as
their own directors (Sidney
Poitier, Clint Eastwood), others as
their own producers (Robert
Redford, Warren Beatty), but
rarely do you find one (with the
possible exception of Jerry Lewis)
ambitious enough to tackle both,
along with starring in a movie
they've written themselves.
Cornel Wilde is one of these
men, who, with his new movie,
Shark's Treasure, has achieved
better quality than Lewis ever
managed. Asked at a dinner
interview last week why an actor
would turn to a position behind

the camera, Wilde replied that as a
director and producer, he has
more control over how his
performance as an actor will be
seen.
While he talks in a rich, deep
voice in a slow and methodical
tone, he fiddles with his plate as
we await dinner. His hands are
never still, restlessly exploring the
surrounding silverware until they
are banished to his lap, where
they twitch and fidget to
communicate that they don't

enjoy being trapped there.
He says he learned how to
direct from watching and asking
questions on the sets of the
movies he starred in (The Greatest
Show On Earth, A Song To
Remember, Leave Her To Heaven,
among others), but I doubt it.
When Wilde does something, he
doesn't do it halfway.
Shark Knowledge
He learned about snakes for his
recent Beach Red, and now he can
tell you anything about sharks.
His movies are done without
compromise, scrupulously on
location (this one in the
Caribbean and on the island of
Bonaire in the Coral Sea off
Australia).
Thus I don't think he learned
directing haphazardly. Sharks
Treasure shows that he pursued
every aspect of movie-making
with the same vigor he employs to
make his movies totally authentic.
Shark's Treasure, on the
surface, is a highly original action
drama about the search for the
treasure of a fleet of sunken
Spanish ships.
Underlying ihat, though,
Wilde's recurrent theme of man
against the elements and man
against his fellow man ("I wanted
to do a story with human
conflict," Wilde said. "I like
action if it comes from character
conflict"), and just below that it
is the story of the
unscrupulousness of men.
When the crew of four reaches

the ships, they find them
surrounded by territorial sharks,
which much be eliminated before
the treasure can be dug up.
The ecological aspect of killing
the sharks never occurs to them
(in reality, when Wilde asked
Australian officials about a permit
to shoot sharks, they laughed and
considered giving him a bounty
for each one killed). Similarly,
when they start to excavate the
treasure, they assault the ocean
floor with a vacuum to extricate
the valuable trinkets, as if "search
and destroy" were the password.
Perhaps this is an allegory for
our modern day tactics of
destroying landmarks and the
environment in the name of
"progress." Even worse than the
four are the escaped convicts who
commandeer the four men's ship
and treasure with the same greed.
Underwater Shots
The underwater photography,
courtesy of experts Al (biddings
and Chuck Nicklin, is beautiful.
Equally excellent are the

hair-raising scenes between the
men and the sharks. Not entirely
rehearsed was the scene in which a
shark enters the diver's cage in a
nasty mood.
Wilde had sawed halfway
through the bar so the shark
would break it, but he never
dreamed that it would shoot two
feet into the cage while he was
only armed with a shark billy (an
axe handle with nail-heads).
He hastened to add — are you
listening, Steven Spielberg?
(director of Jaws) — that none of
the sharks were drugged, tired, in
shock, or rubber.
82 Teeth
In other words, they were real,
and as the commercial says,"the
shark has 82 teeth — all sharp."
The shark scenes are done so well
that one is amazed to discover
that they were filmed in a matter
of hours.
Cornel Wilde's Jim Carnahan,
the skipper of the crew, is a nice
piece of acting, rounding out his
other talents shown in the film.

At least his Southern accent
didn't slip like Richard Burton's
did in The Klansman.
To be singled out, though, is
Cliff Osmond as the leader of the
convicts who impede the
progression of the treasure hunt.
His was the most difficult role,
calling for him to be at times
sadistic and unscrupulous, at
others gentle and loving to a
fellow convict (David Gilliam).
Their relationship, which
wouldn't have been filmed a few
years ago, is sad to watch and
even sadder when one realizes
how true-to-life it is,
1 would not wish Gilliam's role
of Johnny on my worst enemy.
His whining, pitiful performance
is as excruciating to watch as it
must have been to play.
It is embarassing watching such
overacting, most likely a mixture
of Gilliam's inexperience and a
minor Haw in Wilde's direction.
Overall, though, Shark's lYcasurc
is highly entertaining and
enjoyable. g
