## Cardinal Knowledge Who's The Starting QB? 
### Ron Beck 
When are Stanford football fans going to find out who next
season's starting quarterback is? Well, don't look to next weekend's
alumni game for the answer.
Fans generally assume that the first-half starter in the
end-of-spring-training scrimmage — this year the alumni game — will
be Head Coach Jack Christiansen's personal selection for the starting
quarterback slot. But that's false assumption, according to Chris.
"We'll get a good chance to look at both quarterbacks during a
game situation," Chris muses, "but 1 don't see anything special about
who starts. I may just flip a coin."
Both Guy Benjamin and Mike Cordova have looked impressive in
spring drills, says Christiansen. Last season's third quarterback, Jerry
Waldvogel, has been sidelined for most of the spring sessions due to a
shoulder injury.
Good Percentages
Benjamin is throwing at a 62 percent completion rate, and Cordova
at 57 percent, but that's far from a definitive statistic. "First, we
always knew that Guy is the better 'pure' passer," explains Chris,
"and second, you've got to remember that these passes aren't all to
first-string players. You've got some fourth-stringers out there who
don't catch as well. We could pick by statistics, but there are things
that statistics just don't show." So everyone will have to wait some
more for the answer.
Defensively, spring drills have been a great help. Replacing eight of
11 starters would be a tough task for any team, but Chris is confident
that by the end of the spring drills "we should have a very good idea
of who should start."
Christiansen names only five defensive players who have come
close to securing starting assignments: Duncan McColl, a down
lineman; Dan Francis and John Olenchalk at the linebacking positions;
and Rich Waters and Paul Skrabo at the corners.

The alumni game next weekend is a new twist, or at least a revival
of an old twist, for the spring training finale. For the past decade, the
Card squad has been divided into two teams that squared off in the
Red-White game. This year, Chris has changed the format to a'spring
squad versus alumni game.
Reasons Behind Change
A few of the reasons that Chris cites for the new format are fan
interest, alumni-present player relationships and a lack of depth
adequate enough to field two teams.
"At some positions we just don't have enough people," says
Christiansen. "If we split them up and someone gets hurt, then we
have to stop the game."
It's almost too early in the year to start making predictions for the
season, but, when pressed, Christiansen is willing to admit that, as in
the past, USC and UCLA are going to be the teams to beat for the
Pacific-Eight crown. "It doesn't change much from year to year. USC
and UCLA are always going to be up there.
"You've got to consider Cal also. Their tie against USC gave them a
lot of confidence. Plus they've got |Chuck| Muncie coming back at
running back, and Steve Rivera receiving, so I hey should be tough
again."
With the season over four months away, Christiansen is still more
concerned with his own team's progress than with that of Pac-8
opponents. And with the question marks Chris still has about the
team, the activities of the next week could be crucial to the team's
success next season.

THE BIG MEET— California may be the prohibitive favorite in tomorrow's 81st Big Meet in Stanford
Stadium at 1:15 p.m., but as Stanford mentor Payton Jordan says, "anything can happen in this meet."
Last year steeplechaser Stacy Geiken (falling in the water) came back to win the Big Meet steeplechase.
Geiken is listed as "questionable" for tomorrow's meet.
