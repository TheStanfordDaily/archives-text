# Big Meet: Spikers Face Cal
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The only thing that will be big
in tomorrow afternoon's 81st Big
Meet in Stanford Stadium will be
California's score. Indeed, the
meet might be more appropriately
called the "Big Sweep."
The real big meet will take
place in Los Angeles where
defending national dual meet
champion UCLA will defend its
crown against a challenge by USC.
But Card Coach Payton Jordan
says tomorrow's 1:15 p.m. clash is
the season's biggest meet for him.
"Both teams have felt the sting
of losing to USC and UCLA," said
Jordan, "so this really becomes
the biggest meet of the year. We
expect a close meet, but a great

deal depends upon the condition
of several of our top men who
have been injured and whether the
football players on our team can
compete fresh."
Both teams may have been
"stung" by USC and UCLA, but
the Cards got stung a lot worse
than the Bears did. Cal made a
good showing in losing to the
Bruins two weeks ago. The Bears
lost by 21 points, but almost
pulled off upsets in the mile and
440 relays. UCLA blew Stanford
off the track last month, sweeping
every event.
Jordan isn't shying away from
Cal. "We know they're a top rated
team. They're well-balanced and
they'll be highly favored because

of their great depth," said Jordan.
"But this is the Big Meet and
everything is equal now," he
contended.
Just how equal the meet will
be depends largely upon the skill
of Stanford trainer Dave
Blanchard. Five of the Cards' top
performers, including defending
Pac-8 intermediate hurdles
champion Matt Hogsett, top
quarter milers Scott Wingo and
Alan Sheats, distance man Stacy
Geiken and hurdler Dave
Bagshaw, may miss the meet.
Hogsett (pulled hamstring),
Sheats (asthma), and Wingo
(severe shin splints) are listed as
"probable" by Jordan. Bagshaw
and Geiken, both suffering from
sprained ankles, are rated as
"questionable."
And what depth Stanford has
in the weight events may be gone.
"All the people in our weight
crew are scheduled for a heavy
football scrimage Saturday
morning," said Jordan. "We hope
they'll be excused from the
scrimage so they can come to the
meet fresh."
Oh well, it will probably be a
nice day for sitting in the sun, and
the presence of the Band and the
Dollies won't hurt.

Cal. "We know they're a top rated
team. They're well-balanced and
they'll be highly favored because

of their great depth," said Jordan.
"But this is the Big Meet and
everything is equal now," he
contended.
Just how equal the meet will
be depends largely upon the skill
of Stanford trainer Dave
Blanchard. Five of the Cards' top
performers, including defending
Pac-8 intermediate hurdles
champion Matt Hogsett, top
quarter milers Scott Wingo and
Alan Sheats, distance man Stacy
Geiken and hurdler Dave
Bagshaw, may miss the meet.
Hogsett (pulled hamstring),
Sheats (asthma), and Wingo
(severe shin splints) are listed as
"probable" by Jordan. Bagshaw
and Geiken, both suffering from
sprained ankles, are rated as
"questionable."
And what depth Stanford has
in the weight events may be gone.
"All the people in our weight
crew are scheduled for a heavy
football scrimage Saturday
morning," said Jordan. "We hope
they'll be excused from the
scrimage so they can come to the
meet fresh."
Oh well, it will probably be a
nice day for sitting in the sun, and
the presence of the Band and the
Dollies won't hurt.
The only thing that will be big
in tomorrow afternoon's 81st Big
Meet in Stanford Stadium will be
California's score. Indeed, the
meet might be more appropriately
called the "Big Sweep."
The real big meet will take
place in Los Angeles where
defending national dual meet
champion UCLA will defend its
crown against a challenge by USC.
But Card Coach Payton Jordan
says tomorrow's 1:15 p.m. clash is
the season's biggest meet for him.
"Both teams have felt the sting
of losing to USC and UCLA," said
Jordan, "so this really becomes
the biggest meet of the year. We
expect a close meet, but a great

deal depends upon the condition
of several of our top men who
have been injured and whether the
football players on our team can
compete fresh."
Both teams may have been
"stung" by USC and UCLA, but
the Cards got stung a lot worse
than the Bears did. Cal made a
good showing in losing to the
Bruins two weeks ago. The Bears
lost by 21 points, but almost
pulled off upsets in the mile and
440 relays. UCLA blew Stanford
off the track last month, sweeping
every event.
Jordan isn't shying away from
Cal. "We know they're a top rated
team. They're well-balanced and
they'll be highly favored because

of their great depth," said Jordan.

everything is equal now," he
