# P.A.Council Hopefuls Debate Growth Issues
## 
### FENTON JOHNSON Last of Two Parts 
Though all of the candidates
emphasize their independence, Palo
Alto's May 13 City Council election
again shapes up as a battle between
traditional "residentialist" and
"establishment" slates, with
independents given little chance of an
upset.
Sponsored by the Association for
Balanced Community (ABC), the
residentialist slate, composed of
incumbents Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson, Dick Rosenbaum and
challenger Larry Klein, regards the
future direction of Palo Alto growth as
the campaign's chief issue.
Peaison characterizes the
establishment slate as "high-rise
supported [Scott ] Carey,"
"road-expander I Anne] Witherspoon,"
"baylands-developer | Royl Clay," and
"for-foothill-developmeni (Fred]
Eyerly."
She stresses "quality, not quantity'
in Palo Alto's growth, emphasizing
that Stanford "should not be allowed
a free run" in plans it may have for
future expansion of the Industrial Park
and Shopping Center.
Stanford graduate and public
accountant Henderson claims Palo
Alto is in excellent financial condition.
Highlights
Henderson lists several highlights of
his council career, including the
maintenance of open space in the
foothills, opposition to the
Dumbarton Bridge project, and the
Lytton Gardens senior citizens housing
project.
Rosenbaum points to his
opposition to "Superblock," a
high-rise development planned for
downtown Palo Alto by opponent
Carey's real estate firm, as proof of his
commitment to controlled growth.
"Superblock" was later defeated in
a special voter referendum.
"Considering the soft space for offices
now, I think we did Scott | Carey | and
his associates a great favor,"
Rosenbaum claims.
Klein, the only non-incumbent on

the ABC slate, says that though all
candidates favor controlled growth,
"there is a difference of degree which
becomes a difference of kind."
Never Involved
He claims his opponents have never
been involved with conservation or
land use policy in Palo Alto, criticizing
"Clay's support of the new
Dumbarton Bridge and Carey's
road-widening program" as
encouraging unnecessary growth.
Incumbent Clay leads the
"establishment" slate, with Carey,
Eyerly and Witherspoon. Calling
themselves "Palo Alto '75," they
center their attack on their incumbent
opponents' "bloc voting."
Clay, the only black candidate of
the 11, calls the issue of
development vs. preservation of
residential quality "a smokescreen."
Citing his opponents' voting record as
the campaign's primary issue, Clay
commented, "The city is ill-served by
bloc voting," and promised to serve
"all segments of Palo Alto citizenry."
Resurrected Dead
Carey claims his opponents have
"resurrected the issue of growth out of
dead files," because all of the
candidates are for controlled growth.
Asked if he believed there might be
a conflict of interest between his vice
presidency of the Comish and Carey
real estate firm and a city council seat,
he claimed, "we all have conflicts,"
pointing to Mayor and Stanford Law
Prof. Byron Sher as an example. "You
just need to know how to exercise
judgment on when to vote and when
to abstain."
'Political Patronage'
Eyerly accuses his opponents of
using city funds for "political
patronage," citing a $19,000 study of
the need for an access road to the
Stanford Industrial Park as an
example. "That study was done for
the College Terrace people to form a
political base [for the ABC
candidates]," Eyerly claimed. Though
in favor of controlled growth, he feels
that "development should be allowed
where appropriate."
Stanford graduate Witherspoon sees
the city as "encouraging the kind of
growth it wants," pointing to retail
trade expansion as desirable. She calls
industrial growth a "moot point,"
claiming that because there is no
market for unskilled labor in Palo
Alto, industries will not move their
facilities here. "Instead, there will be
growth in the area of research and
development," she said.
While each of the three unslated
candidates — Brian Devendorf, Scott
Amoroso, and John Fredrich —
emphasizes his independence as a
primary asset, the contest appears to
be between the traditional slates.
Though the "establishment"
candidates claim the issue of growth is
dead, it seems the traditional dividing
lines will remain intact, at least for this
election.

Dumbarton Bridge project, and the
Lytton Gardens senior citizens housing
project.
Rosenbaum points to his
opposition to "Superblock," a
high-rise development planned for
downtown Palo Alto by opponent
Carey's real estate firm, as proof of his
commitment to controlled growth.
"Superblock" was later defeated in
a special voter referendum.
"Considering the soft space for offices
now, I think we did Scott | Carey | and
his associates a great favor,"
Rosenbaum claims.
Klein, the only non-incumbent on

the ABC slate, says that though all
candidates favor controlled growth,
"there is a difference of degree which
becomes a difference of kind."
Never Involved
He claims his opponents have never
been involved with conservation or
land use policy in Palo Alto, criticizing
"Clay's support of the new
Dumbarton Bridge and Carey's
road-widening program" as
encouraging unnecessary growth.
Incumbent Clay leads the
"establishment" slate, with Carey,
Eyerly and Witherspoon. Calling
themselves "Palo Alto '75," they
center their attack on their incumbent
opponents' "bloc voting."
Clay, the only black candidate of
the 11, calls the issue of
development vs. preservation of
residential quality "a smokescreen."
Citing his opponents' voting record as
the campaign's primary issue, Clay
commented, "The city is ill-served by
bloc voting," and promised to serve
"all segments of Palo Alto citizenry."
Resurrected Dead
Carey claims his opponents have
"resurrected the issue of growth out of
dead files," because all of the
candidates are for controlled growth.
Asked if he believed there might be
a conflict of interest between his vice
presidency of the Comish and Carey
real estate firm and a city council seat,
he claimed, "we all have conflicts,"
pointing to Mayor and Stanford Law
Prof. Byron Sher as an example. "You
just need to know how to exercise
judgment on when to vote and when
to abstain."
'Political Patronage'
Eyerly accuses his opponents of
using city funds for "political
patronage," citing a $19,000 study of
the need for an access road to the
Stanford Industrial Park as an
example. "That study was done for
the College Terrace people to form a
political base [for the ABC
candidates]," Eyerly claimed. Though
in favor of controlled growth, he feels
that "development should be allowed
where appropriate."
Stanford graduate Witherspoon sees
the city as "encouraging the kind of
growth it wants," pointing to retail
trade expansion as desirable. She calls
industrial growth a "moot point,"
claiming that because there is no
market for unskilled labor in Palo
Alto, industries will not move their
facilities here. "Instead, there will be
growth in the area of research and
development," she said.
While each of the three unslated
candidates — Brian Devendorf, Scott
Amoroso, and John Fredrich —
emphasizes his independence as a
primary asset, the contest appears to
be between the traditional slates.
Though the "establishment"
candidates claim the issue of growth is
dead, it seems the traditional dividing
lines will remain intact, at least for this
election.
Though all of the candidates
emphasize their independence, Palo
Alto's May 13 City Council election
again shapes up as a battle between
traditional "residentialist" and
"establishment" slates, with
independents given little chance of an
upset.
Sponsored by the Association for
Balanced Community (ABC), the
residentialist slate, composed of
incumbents Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson, Dick Rosenbaum and
challenger Larry Klein, regards the
future direction of Palo Alto growth as
the campaign's chief issue.
Peaison characterizes the
establishment slate as "high-rise
supported [Scott ] Carey,"
"road-expander I Anne] Witherspoon,"
"baylands-developer | Royl Clay," and
"for-foothill-developmeni (Fred]
Eyerly."
She stresses "quality, not quantity'
in Palo Alto's growth, emphasizing
that Stanford "should not be allowed
a free run" in plans it may have for
future expansion of the Industrial Park
and Shopping Center.
Stanford graduate and public
accountant Henderson claims Palo
Alto is in excellent financial condition.
Highlights
Henderson lists several highlights of
his council career, including the
maintenance of open space in the
foothills, opposition to the
Dumbarton Bridge project, and the
Lytton Gardens senior citizens housing
project.
