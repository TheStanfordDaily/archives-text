## Netters Face Two 
### DAVE SMITH 
The Stanford men's tennis
team, whose preparations to
defend its Pac-8 and NCAA
crowns later this spring have been
slowed more by injuries than by
opponents recently, may send
some injured stars back into
action in two home matches this
weekend.
The Card netters will take on
the University of San Diego this
afternoon at 2:30, and Cal's team,
which the Cards dumped 8-1 early
this season, tomorrow at 1 p.m.
I
Among the Cards who have
been nursing pulled muscles and
sitting out recent matches are
Nick Saviano, whose status is still
listed as "indefinite," and Gene
Mayer, who probably won't play
today but may appear against Cal
tomorrow.
But more important for the
Cards' title hopes will be the play
of their number one man, NCAA
champ John Whitlinger.
Whitlinger, who has been playing
with a sore shoulder recently, goes
into today's match with a

dual-match record of only six
wins and seven losses.
Whitlinger's play has been one
of the major disappointments of
the Cards' season. The nation's
second-ranked amateur, he has
lost twice to each of USC's Butch
Walts. San Jose State's Hank
Pfister and UCLA's top-ranked
collegian Billy Martin. But Whit
played well in his loss to Martin
last week at Ojai, and two wins
this weekend should inspire some
much-needed confidence in the
Stanford ace.
Tomorrow Whitlinger will meet
Cal's Doug King, who won their
earlier match when Whit had to
default. Other Card singles players
certain to be in action this
weekend are the undefeated
(13-0) Jim Delaney and relatively
healthy regulars Bill Maze and Pat
DuPre.
Playing without their top stars,
Wednesday the Card netters edged
UC-Davis, 5-4.
Whitlinger is seeded first in the
California State Tennis
Championships, which start in
Portola Valley tomorrow.
Chico Ilagey, runner-up last
year, is seeded seventh, right
behind Delaney at sixth. Nick
Saviano is 13th. Pat DuPre 14th.
and Mayer 15th. Whitlinger and
Delaney are top-seeded in the
doubles.
