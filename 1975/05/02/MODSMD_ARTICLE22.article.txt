# IM Roundup
## Bikers: Prepare! 
### PETE BHATIA 
The IM Bike Race grabs center
stage this weekend among
intramural events with a new
course and some new regulations.
The race will be Sunday on the
Loop Road at SLAC with
registration beginning at 9:30
a.m., and the race beginning
promptly at 10. .
Each organization may enter
one five-man team with the top
three finishers per team counting
towards the team title. Individuals
are also welcome to ride.
In addition, each team or
individual must furnish a lap
counter, and each rider must sign
a pre-race waiver freeing SLAC
from any responsibility in case of
injury during the 10-mile event.
The course measures .8 miles
per lap and the race will
(obviously) be approximately 12
laps. The SLAC course measures
about twice as long as the course
used the past two years at the
Artificial Intelligence Center.
Last year's winners, the Nads —
composed of members of the
Stanford crew team — are back
again this year as the "Hog Ridin'
Fools." Don't be surprised if they
win it all again this year. After all,
the only people who get up before
11 a.m. on Sunday at Stanford are
pre-meds and the crew crazies.

They'll be peaking for the day
about the time the race starts.
More information can be obtained
at the IM office in Encina Gym.

In softball this week, our
always observant IM Roundup
reporting staff has unearthed
another one of those rare and
enjoyable IM teams, that never
wins a game but has a good time
trying (Nice Cliche). But seriously
folks, the team in question — the
Gavilan '72 of softball — is the
awesomely monikered "Fighting
Armadillos."
These gifted athletes are led by
their coach, mentor and masseur,
Tom Galligan. Galligan, who grew
up in the shadows of the greats of
New York, evokes a Yankee-like
determination from his boys. Last
year they went winless. This year,
however, after dropping their first
two decisions, the Armadillos are
on a two-game winning streak.
Well, almost. Last week the
Fighting A's picked up a win by
forfeit, and this week the
Armadillos won the first game of
their Stanford campaign, a 6-2
decision over Serra. More exciting
details will follow in upcoming
roundups on the Armadillos.

The IM Bike Race grabs center
stage this weekend among
intramural events with a new
course and some new regulations.
The race will be Sunday on the
Loop Road at SLAC with
registration beginning at 9:30
a.m., and the race beginning
promptly at 10. .
Each organization may enter
one five-man team with the top
three finishers per team counting
towards the team title. Individuals
are also welcome to ride.
In addition, each team or
individual must furnish a lap
counter, and each rider must sign
a pre-race waiver freeing SLAC
from any responsibility in case of
injury during the 10-mile event.
The course measures .8 miles
per lap and the race will
(obviously) be approximately 12
laps. The SLAC course measures
about twice as long as the course
used the past two years at the
Artificial Intelligence Center.
Last year's winners, the Nads —
composed of members of the
Stanford crew team — are back
again this year as the "Hog Ridin'
Fools." Don't be surprised if they
win it all again this year. After all,
the only people who get up before
11 a.m. on Sunday at Stanford are
pre-meds and the crew crazies.

They'll be peaking for the day
about the time the race starts.
More information can be obtained
at the IM office in Encina Gym.

In softball this week, our
always observant IM Roundup
reporting staff has unearthed
another one of those rare and
enjoyable IM teams, that never
wins a game but has a good time
trying (Nice Cliche). But seriously
folks, the team in question — the
Gavilan '72 of softball — is the
awesomely monikered "Fighting
Armadillos."
These gifted athletes are led by
their coach, mentor and masseur,
Tom Galligan. Galligan, who grew
up in the shadows of the greats of
New York, evokes a Yankee-like
determination from his boys. Last
year they went winless. This year,
however, after dropping their first
two decisions, the Armadillos are
on a two-game winning streak.
Well, almost. Last week the
Fighting A's picked up a win by
forfeit, and this week the
Armadillos won the first game of
their Stanford campaign, a 6-2
decision over Serra. More exciting
details will follow in upcoming
roundups on the Armadillos.
