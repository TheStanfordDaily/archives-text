# Batters Whip S.F. State; Ready To Face Bruins
## 
### PAUL BAUMAN DAN PYNE 
Stanford Baseball Coach Ray
Young knows what his team is up
against this weekend in Los
Angeles.
"No question about it, if we're
going to be in the run for the roses
we have to sweep somebody."
This weekend Stanford faces
UCLA.
Next weekend the Cards take
on Cal in a season-closing
three-game series. Since the
Cardinals are one-and-a-half games
behind front running USC, all six
of these games are important.
Young says Stanford must win
five of them.
The Bruins are in the Pacific
Eight Southern Division cellar.
They haven't been there long. A
week ago they were in third and
two weeks ago they were tied for
first with the Cards. At 28-16
overall, 5-7 in league play, UCLA
is no one to overlook.
Cards Ready
But Stanford, still hurting from
two losses to the Trojans a few
days ago, will be ready.
Stanford picked up another
mid-week victory Wednesday with
a 6-2 thrashing of San Francisco
State. "We haven't dazzled
anybody with our statistics,"
Young says, "but we've been
winning the Tuesday and
Wednesday games. Last year we
weren't doing that."

But Young's pitching woes
continued. Bruce Davis started the
game for the Cards, but missed
picking up the win by two outs.
Davis pitched four-and-a-third
innings, and allowed both of the
Gators' runs. He had some control
problems, falling behind the early
batters, and went out in the fifth
with one out and the bases
loaded.
Tender Arm Win
Jim Scharffenberger, nursing a
tender arm, replaced Davis on the
mound, and ended the fifth with a
double play. Scharffenberger, now
4-2 for the season, pitched
through the eighth allowing two
hits, two walks, and walking two.
John Yandle, who will see action
at UCLA along with A 1 Arthur,
pitched the ninth.
Young said afterward he was
stil unsure who his third starter
would be at UCLA, as only
Yandle and Arthur are completely
healthy.
He also indicated that UCLA's
Sawtelle Field is a tough park for
pitchers because the fences are
short.
The pitching woes are
particularly troubling if you look

at UCLA's batting statistics. Left
fielder Venoy Garrison leads the
Bruins with a .345 average and six
home runs, and three of his
teammates are also hitting over
.300.
No Stanford regular is hitting
.300; the top Card is shortstop
Steve Davis with a .295 average.
Stanford's scoring was
highlighted by center fielder Bob
Hampton's ninth home run of the
season, a solo blast in the fifth
that cleared the outer green fence
in left-center, about 430-450 feet
from the plate.
Card Runs
The Cards scored three runs in
the third, Hampton's one in the
fifth, and two more in the seventh
inning.
Stanford took two of three
games from the Bruins on Sunken
Diamond earlier this year. Last
week UCLA lost two of three to
Cal in Berkeley.
