Viet Conp: No More U.S. Influence
SAIGON— The Viet Cong announced
yesterday they were in complete control of South
Vietnam and issued a series of policy decrees
stressing revolutionary government and an end to 15
years of U.S. influence. A broadcast warned people
against "acting like Americans."
Among the decrees was an order nationalizing
virtually all the country's business and industry, the
Cuban news agency reported.
North Vietnam demanded that U.S. warships
withdraw from areas off the coast and halt what it
called "forcible evacuation" of Vietnamese who.
according to the Pentagon, have been fleeing in rafts
and small boats into the South China Sea.
In Washington, the House rejected President
Ford's urgent $327 million aid request for South
Vietnamese refugees yesterday because it still bore
authority for U.S. military evacuations.
Hours later. Ford issued a statement declaring
the House's decision was "not worthy of a people
which has lived by the philosophy symbolized in the
Statue of Liberty."
He appealed to Congress to draw up new
legislation and House leaders indicated they would
draft a new bill containing the money only.
The bill, written before the Saigon government
fell was up for Congress' final approval yesterday.
It was rejected 246-162 despite an appeal from Ford
that its evacuation authority was now useless and
the money was "desperately needed."
600 Refugees Missinp In Cambodia
THAILAND — Concern arose here yesterday
over the whereabouts and condition of more than
600 refugees reported on an arduous overland trip
across Communist-ruled Cambodia.
The group, believed en route by truck convoy
from Phnom Penh since Wednesday, ran out of
gasoline only 30 miles short of the
Cambodian-Thailand border, frontier guards told
relief agency officials, diplomats and newsmen who
have been waiting two days at the border.
Members of the group expected from Phnom
Penh were foreigners who took refuge in the
Cambodian capital's French Embassy when the city
fell to Khmer Rouge forces April 17.
France has protested that supplies to the
embassy were cut off in violation of international
custom and that the Khmer Rouge finally forced
the more than 600 men, women and children to
leave by truck instead of plane.
SLA: More Ammunition Evidence
SACRAMENTO — Stores of ammunition from a

Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) house —
including bullets taken from a shirt pocket and said

linked to SLA member Joseph Remiro, who along
with Russell Little is charged with the
cyanide-bullet slaying of Oakland school Supt.
Marcus Foster.
The jury had a slide-show tour of the house in
Concord where a fire broke out Jan. 10, 1974,
hours after Little and Remiro were arrested.
The 53 slides shown on a screen in the
courthouse included views of ammunition bags, pipe
bombs, bags marked "cyanide plates," news
clippings taped on walls and numerous empty
bottles of plum wine.

Hundreds Of Doctors k On Strike"
SAN FRANCISCO — Hundreds of Northern
California physicians stayed oul of operating rooms
yesterday, bringing nonemergency surgery to a
virtual standstill in a protest of spiraling malpractice
insurance rates.
The deadline for 4000 doctors in eight counties
to renew their agreement with Argonaut Insurance
Co. of Menlo Park passed at midnight. Many of the
doctors refused to pay higher rates ranging up to
322 percent.
A spot check of 25 hospitals revealed virtually all
had restricted surgical admission to critically ill
patients. Only emergency surgery was being
performed at most hospitals, with some continuing
to perform operations that required only a local
anesthetic.
Senate Passes Budget Guidelines
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a budget
guideline resolution yesterday contemplating a
$67.2 billion deficit $7.2 billion above President
Ford's figure — and the House plunged ahead with a
measure envisaging an even greater deficit.
The version passed by the Senate sets a $365
billion spending target, while the version on which

the House was working contemplated $368.2 billion
outlays and a $73.2 billion deficit. The House
version of the deficit could be increased or
decreased by amendments.
In letters to both chambers. Ford reiterated his
stand that a $60 billion deficit is the maximum the
country can stand. He has no authority to veto the
resolution, though he may confront Congress later
with vetoes on specific spending bills.
Ford Vetoes Farm Bill
WASHINGTON — President Ford vetoed a
controversial one-year farm bill yesterday that
administration experts said would trigger massive
new farm subsidies and result in higher consumer
food prices.
The bill would raise federal target prices and loan
rates for major crops including wheat, corn and
cotton. It also would bolster federal milk price
supports.
Ford said that "in the long haul, this bill would
lead to constraints on production and result in loss
of jobs in food-related industries. It would induce
farmers to grow more cotton — already in surplus —
and less soybeans needed for food. The bill would
jeopardize the competitive position of our cotton in
world markets."
Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz told a White
House briefing before the veto that "the longer run
impact of this bill will be to raise food prices. You
can't interpret it otherwise."
Butz said he thought Ford's veto would be
upheld in the House where leaders said they would
attempt to override it next week. Congressional
supporters of the bill said the vote would be close in
the House, but that the Senate probably would
override the veto.

Viet Conp: No More U.S. Influence
SAIGON— The Viet Cong announced
yesterday they were in complete control of South
Vietnam and issued a series of policy decrees
stressing revolutionary government and an end to 15
years of U.S. influence. A broadcast warned people
against "acting like Americans."
Among the decrees was an order nationalizing
virtually all the country's business and industry, the
Cuban news agency reported.
North Vietnam demanded that U.S. warships
withdraw from areas off the coast and halt what it
called "forcible evacuation" of Vietnamese who.
according to the Pentagon, have been fleeing in rafts
and small boats into the South China Sea.
In Washington, the House rejected President
Ford's urgent $327 million aid request for South
Vietnamese refugees yesterday because it still bore
authority for U.S. military evacuations.
Hours later. Ford issued a statement declaring
the House's decision was "not worthy of a people
which has lived by the philosophy symbolized in the
Statue of Liberty."
He appealed to Congress to draw up new
legislation and House leaders indicated they would
draft a new bill containing the money only.
The bill, written before the Saigon government
fell was up for Congress' final approval yesterday.
It was rejected 246-162 despite an appeal from Ford
that its evacuation authority was now useless and
the money was "desperately needed."
600 Refugees Missinp In Cambodia
THAILAND — Concern arose here yesterday
over the whereabouts and condition of more than
600 refugees reported on an arduous overland trip
across Communist-ruled Cambodia.
The group, believed en route by truck convoy
from Phnom Penh since Wednesday, ran out of
gasoline only 30 miles short of the
Cambodian-Thailand border, frontier guards told
relief agency officials, diplomats and newsmen who
have been waiting two days at the border.
Members of the group expected from Phnom
Penh were foreigners who took refuge in the
Cambodian capital's French Embassy when the city
fell to Khmer Rouge forces April 17.
France has protested that supplies to the
embassy were cut off in violation of international
custom and that the Khmer Rouge finally forced
the more than 600 men, women and children to
leave by truck instead of plane.

yesterday, bringing nonemergency surgery to a
virtual standstill in a protest of spiraling malpractice
insurance rates.

Senate Passes Budget Guidelines
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a budget
guideline resolution yesterday contemplating a
$67.2 billion deficit $7.2 billion above President

measure envisaging an even greater deficit.
The version passed by the Senate sets a $365
billion spending target, while the version on which

the House was working contemplated $368.2 billion
outlays and a $73.2 billion deficit. The House
version of the deficit could be increased or
decreased by amendments.
In letters to both chambers. Ford reiterated his
stand that a $60 billion deficit is the maximum the
country can stand. He has no authority to veto the
resolution, though he may confront Congress later

Ford Vetoes Farm Bill
WASHINGTON — President Ford vetoed a
controversial one-year farm bill yesterday that
administration experts said would trigger massive
new farm subsidies and result in higher consumer
food prices.
The bill would raise federal target prices and loan
rates for major crops including wheat, corn and
cotton. It also would bolster federal milk price
supports.
Ford said that "in the long haul, this bill would
lead to constraints on production and result in loss
of jobs in food-related industries. It would induce
farmers to grow more cotton — already in surplus —
and less soybeans needed for food. The bill would
jeopardize the competitive position of our cotton in
world markets."
Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz told a White
House briefing before the veto that "the longer run
impact of this bill will be to raise food prices. You
can't interpret it otherwise."
Butz said he thought Ford's veto would be
upheld in the House where leaders said they would
attempt to override it next week. Congressional
supporters of the bill said the vote would be close in
the House, but that the Senate probably would
override the veto.

Viet Conp: No More U.S. Influence
SAIGON— The Viet Cong announced
yesterday they were in complete control of South
Vietnam and issued a series of policy decrees
stressing revolutionary government and an end to 15
years of U.S. influence. A broadcast warned people
against "acting like Americans."
Among the decrees was an order nationalizing
virtually all the country's business and industry, the
Cuban news agency reported.
North Vietnam demanded that U.S. warships
withdraw from areas off the coast and halt what it
called "forcible evacuation" of Vietnamese who.
according to the Pentagon, have been fleeing in rafts
and small boats into the South China Sea.
In Washington, the House rejected President
Ford's urgent $327 million aid request for South
Vietnamese refugees yesterday because it still bore
authority for U.S. military evacuations.
Hours later. Ford issued a statement declaring
the House's decision was "not worthy of a people
which has lived by the philosophy symbolized in the
Statue of Liberty."
He appealed to Congress to draw up new
legislation and House leaders indicated they would
draft a new bill containing the money only.
The bill, written before the Saigon government
fell was up for Congress' final approval yesterday.
It was rejected 246-162 despite an appeal from Ford
that its evacuation authority was now useless and
the money was "desperately needed."
600 Refugees Missinp In Cambodia
THAILAND — Concern arose here yesterday
over the whereabouts and condition of more than
600 refugees reported on an arduous overland trip
across Communist-ruled Cambodia.
The group, believed en route by truck convoy
from Phnom Penh since Wednesday, ran out of
gasoline only 30 miles short of the
Cambodian-Thailand border, frontier guards told
relief agency officials, diplomats and newsmen who
have been waiting two days at the border.
Members of the group expected from Phnom
Penh were foreigners who took refuge in the
Cambodian capital's French Embassy when the city
fell to Khmer Rouge forces April 17.
France has protested that supplies to the
embassy were cut off in violation of international
custom and that the Khmer Rouge finally forced
the more than 600 men, women and children to
leave by truck instead of plane.
SLA: More Ammunition Evidence
SACRAMENTO — Stores of ammunition from a

Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) house —
including bullets taken from a shirt pocket and said
to contain cyanide - were shown to a Superior
Court jury yesterday.
Prosecutor Lowell Jensen says the shirt will be
linked to SLA member Joseph Remiro, who along
with Russell Little is charged with the
cyanide-bullet slaying of Oakland school Supt.
Marcus Foster.
The jury had a slide-show tour of the house in
Concord where a fire broke out Jan. 10, 1974,
hours after Little and Remiro were arrested.
The 53 slides shown on a screen in the
courthouse included views of ammunition bags, pipe
bombs, bags marked "cyanide plates," news
clippings taped on walls and numerous empty
bottles of plum wine.

Hundreds Of Doctors k On Strike"
SAN FRANCISCO — Hundreds of Northern
California physicians stayed oul of operating rooms
yesterday, bringing nonemergency surgery to a
virtual standstill in a protest of spiraling malpractice
insurance rates.
The deadline for 4000 doctors in eight counties
to renew their agreement with Argonaut Insurance
Co. of Menlo Park passed at midnight. Many of the
doctors refused to pay higher rates ranging up to
322 percent.
A spot check of 25 hospitals revealed virtually all
had restricted surgical admission to critically ill
patients. Only emergency surgery was being
performed at most hospitals, with some continuing
to perform operations that required only a local
anesthetic.
Senate Passes Budget Guidelines
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a budget
guideline resolution yesterday contemplating a
$67.2 billion deficit $7.2 billion above President
Ford's figure — and the House plunged ahead with a
measure envisaging an even greater deficit.
The version passed by the Senate sets a $365
billion spending target, while the version on which

the House was working contemplated $368.2 billion
outlays and a $73.2 billion deficit. The House
version of the deficit could be increased or
decreased by amendments.
In letters to both chambers. Ford reiterated his
stand that a $60 billion deficit is the maximum the
country can stand. He has no authority to veto the
resolution, though he may confront Congress later
with vetoes on specific spending bills.
Ford Vetoes Farm Bill
WASHINGTON — President Ford vetoed a
controversial one-year farm bill yesterday that
administration experts said would trigger massive
new farm subsidies and result in higher consumer
food prices.
The bill would raise federal target prices and loan
rates for major crops including wheat, corn and
cotton. It also would bolster federal milk price
supports.
Ford said that "in the long haul, this bill would
lead to constraints on production and result in loss
of jobs in food-related industries. It would induce
farmers to grow more cotton — already in surplus —
and less soybeans needed for food. The bill would
jeopardize the competitive position of our cotton in
world markets."
Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz told a White
House briefing before the veto that "the longer run
impact of this bill will be to raise food prices. You
can't interpret it otherwise."
Butz said he thought Ford's veto would be
upheld in the House where leaders said they would
attempt to override it next week. Congressional
supporters of the bill said the vote would be close in
the House, but that the Senate probably would
override the veto.
