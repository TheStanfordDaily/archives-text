# Protest Closes Lasuen After Many Accidents
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
Campus police closed Lasuen Mall
to vehicle traffic yesterday after 35
student demonstrators blocked the
entrance to the street at May field
Avenue.
Residents of Storey, Lathrop,
Columbae and Sigma Chi houses
organized by Faisan residents Bruce
Blakely and Rusty Schwartz,
obstructed the throughway from
11:30 a.m. until around 4 p.m., when
police chief Marvin Herrington placed
steel posts back into the asphalt to
close it off. Herrington said the road
would be closed permanently.
The street was opened three weeks
ago to serve as a temporary access road
to the post office and bookstore while
Old Lane A, which runs behind
Lathrop and Columbae, is being
repaved to lead into the new Law
School's parking lot.
Row residents have complained of
the heavy traffic, excessive speed and
parking problems incurred since the
street's opening. Last week, two of the
three streetlamps on the block were
knocked over in two separate car
accidents within 24 hours.
Tuesday, Paul Navar. a Faisan
resident, was hit by a car while
bicycling to class. Navar was not
seriously hurt, but was treated for
minor abrasions at Cowell Student
Health Center and released.
Prior Plans
After a meeting with Master
Planner Oscar Nelson yesterday
morning, Herrington said the road
would remain open until Monday, the
date contractors for the new road have
told the Planning Office it would be
finished.
However, in the afternoon,
Herrington talked with demonstrators
at the blockade and began directing
traffic away from Lasuen himself.
Later he returned with the steel posts
to close the street. Cars thus will be

barred access to the post office until
late Monday.
A temporary road leading from
Lasuen to the bookstore has also been
barricaded.
Peaceful
The sit-in was peaceful, with
students milling around, talking and
eating lunch. Each car that attempted
to drive through was stopped,
informed of the sit-in, and turned
away. Only delivery trucks and mail
carriers were given passage.
Jack Laird, alumni relations

director for the athletic department,
appeared irate with the demonstrators.
"My initial reaction was negative,"
he said later. "At first glance, it
smacked of a demonstration, and I had
a heavy box I had to get to the post
office. But a student told me there was
another access road for trucks, so I
went that route."
Herrington said yesterday, "we
weren't particularly thrilled about
opening Lasuen, but they | planning
officials! said it would only be for a
short while."

the heavy traffic, excessive speed and
parking problems incurred since the
street's opening. Last week, two of the
three streetlamps on the block were
knocked over in two separate car
accidents within 24 hours.
Tuesday, Paul Navar. a Faisan
resident, was hit by a car while
bicycling to class. Navar was not
seriously hurt, but was treated for
minor abrasions at Cowell Student
Health Center and released.
Prior Plans
After a meeting with Master
Planner Oscar Nelson yesterday
morning, Herrington said the road
would remain open until Monday, the
date contractors for the new road have
told the Planning Office it would be
finished.
However, in the afternoon,
Herrington talked with demonstrators
at the blockade and began directing
traffic away from Lasuen himself.
Later he returned with the steel posts
to close the street. Cars thus will be

barred access to the post office until
late Monday.
A temporary road leading from
Lasuen to the bookstore has also been
barricaded.
Peaceful
The sit-in was peaceful, with
students milling around, talking and
eating lunch. Each car that attempted
to drive through was stopped,
informed of the sit-in, and turned
away. Only delivery trucks and mail
carriers were given passage.
Jack Laird, alumni relations

director for the athletic department,
appeared irate with the demonstrators.
"My initial reaction was negative,"
he said later. "At first glance, it
smacked of a demonstration, and I had
a heavy box I had to get to the post
office. But a student told me there was
another access road for trucks, so I
went that route."
Herrington said yesterday, "we
weren't particularly thrilled about
opening Lasuen, but they | planning
officials! said it would only be for a
short while."
Campus police closed Lasuen Mall
to vehicle traffic yesterday after 35
student demonstrators blocked the
entrance to the street at May field
Avenue.
Residents of Storey, Lathrop,
Columbae and Sigma Chi houses
organized by Faisan residents Bruce
Blakely and Rusty Schwartz,
obstructed the throughway from
11:30 a.m. until around 4 p.m., when
police chief Marvin Herrington placed
steel posts back into the asphalt to
close it off. Herrington said the road
would be closed permanently.
The street was opened three weeks
ago to serve as a temporary access road
to the post office and bookstore while
Old Lane A, which runs behind
Lathrop and Columbae, is being
repaved to lead into the new Law
School's parking lot.
Row residents have complained of
