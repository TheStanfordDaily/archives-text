# Prof, Students Argue Over Iranian Contract

The Iranian people will benefit
from the Communication
Department's three-year, $970,000
contract with the Iranian government.
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker
asserted yesterday over the protests of
several Iranian students.
"If you want to mobilize people to
help themselves, putting in a
communication system is a powerful
developmental tool," Parker, one of the
principal investigators of the contract,
told 80 people at a Communication
Department public symposium.
But spokesmen for a group of
about 20 Iranian students at the
meeting insisted that the new
communication system, which will
link isolated areas of Iran through a
statellite network, will be used to by
the Iranian government to "repress the
people."
"How on earth can this advanced
system be functional when |many
Iranian | people can't even operate a
two-way radio?" one Iranian asked
Parker.

"Where do you start in bringing
about changes?" Parker retorted,
claiming that the satellite system is a
good beginning.
"It is precisely at points of
technological change that institutions
must change," he said.
'Police State'
Several Iranians claimed that the
satellite will be used to bolster what
they called Iran's "police state" by
providing a centralized system for
identifying dissidents.
But Parker denied this, arguing that
"technology designed to have total
communication is not appropriate to
military purposes. It is too easy to
jam."
A number of Iranians told Parker
he should assume moral responsibility
for the political consequences of the
contract.
Bloody Chalk
"In a few weeks, the white chalk
that you hold in your hand will be red
with the blood of my people," one
Iranian yelled at Parker.
Although Parker replied that "if
this project does harm to people, I'll
feel moral responsibility and know
that I've made a terrible mistake,"
Parker predicted that the project
would not be used to harm the Iranian
people.
One student retorted, however, that
"you can't gauge the extent of risk
until it [the risk | is gone."
Another student contended that
once the Iranian government has taken
control of the communication
satellite, it will use it for its own
political purposes rather than for
educational aims.
But Parker claimed that the Iranian
government probably would not
change the original uses of the satellite
because such an action would cause
the government to lose credibility
among the people.
Take It Away
"Once the people have used it | the
satellite), it will be hard to take it
away from them," Parker said.
Iranian students countered by
calling Parker naive and claiming that
the government has already lost all
credibility among its people.
Parker insisted, however, that "one
shouldn't deprive rural people of the
potential benefits of the
communication system" merely
because of the possibility that it might
be misused.
