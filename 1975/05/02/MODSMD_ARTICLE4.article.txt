# Prof, Students Argue Over Iranian Contract

The Iranian people will benefit
from the Communication
Department's three-year, $970,000
contract with the Iranian government.
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker
asserted yesterday over the protests of
several Iranian students.
"If you want to mobilize people to
help themselves, putting in a
communication system is a powerful
developmental tool," Parker, one of the
principal investigators of the contract,
told 80 people at a Communication
Department public symposium.
But spokesmen for a group of
about 20 Iranian students at the
meeting insisted that the new
communication system, which will
link isolated areas of Iran through a
statellite network, will be used to by
the Iranian government to "repress the
people."
"How on earth can this advanced
system be functional when |many
Iranian | people can't even operate a
two-way radio?" one Iranian asked
Parker.

"Where do you start in bringing
about changes?" Parker retorted,
claiming that the satellite system is a
good beginning.
"It is precisely at points of
technological change that institutions
must change," he said.
'Police State'
Several Iranians claimed that the
satellite will be used to bolster what
they called Iran's "police state" by
providing a centralized system for
identifying dissidents.
But Parker denied this, arguing that
"technology designed to have total
communication is not appropriate to
military purposes. It is too easy to
jam."
A number of Iranians told Parker
he should assume moral responsibility
for the political consequences of the
contract.
Bloody Chalk
"In a few weeks, the white chalk
that you hold in your hand will be red
with the blood of my people," one
Iranian yelled at Parker.
