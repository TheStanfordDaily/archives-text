# Faculty Report Urges 'Innovation'
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Stanford should support academic
innovation and consider programs
aimed at off-campus audiences, a
Faculty Senate committee
recommended yesterday.
"Some definite part of the
operating budget [should] be
designated for high quality innovation
in academic programs," urged the
Committee on Problems of Higher
Education in a report to the Senate.
"In the budgetary tradeoff between
maintaining traditional but weaker
programs or funding newer,
experimental programs, preference
should go to the innovative academic
program," the report continued.
Chaired by Physics Prof. J.D.
Walecka, the committee tried to
"identify a few problems of major
importance for Stanford in the
decades ahead" and propose Senate
action.
The report also asked the Senate to
consider reaching non-campus
audiences through closed-circuit TV or

video cassettes of existing lecture
courses and technical demonstrations.
All schools and departments should
consider such a program, and some
financial incentive should be provided
"to those units that generate
additional income," the committee
suggested.
Approved Two
The Senate tabled these proposals,
but it approved two other committee
recommendations. Under one, the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) will examine whether
undergraduates can be involved more
deeply in scholarship and research
"through such mechanisms as research
credits, senior theses, undergraduate
honors programs and tutorial
programs."
Also, effects of rising tuition on the
makeup of the student body will be
considered by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids.
The Senate also debated proposed
distribution requirement changes.

Under a C-US proposal, students
would still be required to take a
minimum of three courses in each of
the three general areas of humanities,
social sciences and natural
science/mathematics/technology. But
social science and humanities courses
would preferably be "related by a
common theme," usually as part of
designated sequences. Also at least one
course in natural sciences or
technology would be required, rather
than solely math courses being
allowed, to fulfill that division's
requirement.
Clebsch Concerned
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebsch commended the proposal. "I
am concerned, however, about the
implementation of the policy. For I
fear ... the very kind of problem that
led you (the Senate | to abolish the
earlier distribution requirements
several years ago," he added, referring
to the possibility that every course
meeting the requirement would have
to be approved by the Senate.
