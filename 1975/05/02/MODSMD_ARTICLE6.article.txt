# Endorses UFW Legislation
## Chavez Attacks Brown's Farm Bill 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Farm Workers (UFW) leader Ceasar
Chavez yesterday launched a campaign against
farmworkers' legislation proposed by Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr., saying that the Brown bill
( 3. 813) could lead to a "legislatively
; >ported ghetto in agriculture."
Chavez addressed about 800 people in
Memorial Church last night on the first day of a
statewide tour designed to rally popular support
against S.B. 813 and in favor of UFW-supported
bill A.B. 1.
The UFW leader specifically objected to a
provision of S.B. 813 which would allow a
commission to differentiate agricultural jobs for
voting purposes, so that higher-paid workers
could be in a seperate union.
This provision could "relegate the blacks and
the browns to the short-handled pole and stoop
labor . .. and make it very difficult for them to
get the good jobs."
Chavez said that the bill was written by
members of Brown's staff who had "no idea of
what they were doing."
S.B. 813 was introduced in the Senate on
April 10 as a compromise between the
UFW-supported bill, which allows secondary
boycotts such as the one UFW is now conducting
against liquor stores and supermarkets, and
several measures backed by the agricultural
industry, which prohibit secondary boycotts.
The wording of S.B. 813 is "confusing" on the
boycott issue, according to Chavez.
Chavez and Fred Ross of the UFW Bay Area
Support Committee urged the audience to

immediately write Brown to persuade him to
drop his support of S.B. 813.
According to Chris Coleman of the Stanford
UFW Support Committee, "a minimum of 600
letters," were collected at the end of the speech.
Coleman also said that Chavez received a $1365
honorarium from various campus groups and that
$315 was collected at the door.
In his speech, Chavez also said that the
Teamsters Union committed "probably one of
the most shameful acts of labor history in this
country," in attempting to wrest contracts from
UFW.
He reiterated his call for a boycott of the
products of E. & J. Gallo Co., which signed a
contract with the Teamsters in 1973 after six
years during which the UFW represented the
Gallo farmworkers.
Chavez drew the biggest laugh of the evening
when he cited three ways of recognizing Gallo
products. One was to look for the Gallo name,
the second to look for wine bottled in Modesto.
"But they tell me there's a third way of
recognizing Gallo wine. If you miss the first two
signs, drink the stuff and then get sick, that's also
Gallo."
This anecdote was labelled a "low blow" by
Gallo student representative Steven Westly after
the speech. He said that some Gallo wine now on
the shelves was picked by UFW workers.
Westly also said that Gallo opposed A.B 1
because it allowed secondary boycotts, and had
not taken any position on the Brown-supported
bill, which both he and Chavez noted was
"confusing."

UFW LEADER -Cesar Chavez launches a campaign
against Gov. Edmund Brown's proposed ij
farmworker's legislation last night at Memorial ■«
Church. !'
United Farm Workers (UFW) leader Ceasar
Chavez yesterday launched a campaign against
farmworkers' legislation proposed by Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr., saying that the Brown bill
( 3. 813) could lead to a "legislatively
; >ported ghetto in agriculture."
Chavez addressed about 800 people in
Memorial Church last night on the first day of a
statewide tour designed to rally popular support
against S.B. 813 and in favor of UFW-supported
bill A.B. 1.
The UFW leader specifically objected to a
provision of S.B. 813 which would allow a
commission to differentiate agricultural jobs for
voting purposes, so that higher-paid workers
could be in a seperate union.
This provision could "relegate the blacks and
the browns to the short-handled pole and stoop
labor . .. and make it very difficult for them to
get the good jobs."
Chavez said that the bill was written by
members of Brown's staff who had "no idea of
what they were doing."
S.B. 813 was introduced in the Senate on
April 10 as a compromise between the
UFW-supported bill, which allows secondary
boycotts such as the one UFW is now conducting
against liquor stores and supermarkets, and
several measures backed by the agricultural
industry, which prohibit secondary boycotts.
The wording of S.B. 813 is "confusing" on the
boycott issue, according to Chavez.
Chavez and Fred Ross of the UFW Bay Area
Support Committee urged the audience to

immediately write Brown to persuade him to
drop his support of S.B. 813.
According to Chris Coleman of the Stanford
UFW Support Committee, "a minimum of 600
letters," were collected at the end of the speech.
Coleman also said that Chavez received a $1365
honorarium from various campus groups and that
$315 was collected at the door.
In his speech, Chavez also said that the
Teamsters Union committed "probably one of
the most shameful acts of labor history in this
country," in attempting to wrest contracts from
UFW.
He reiterated his call for a boycott of the
products of E. & J. Gallo Co., which signed a
contract with the Teamsters in 1973 after six
years during which the UFW represented the
Gallo farmworkers.
Chavez drew the biggest laugh of the evening
when he cited three ways of recognizing Gallo
products. One was to look for the Gallo name,
the second to look for wine bottled in Modesto.
"But they tell me there's a third way of
recognizing Gallo wine. If you miss the first two
signs, drink the stuff and then get sick, that's also
Gallo."
This anecdote was labelled a "low blow" by
Gallo student representative Steven Westly after
the speech. He said that some Gallo wine now on
the shelves was picked by UFW workers.
Westly also said that Gallo opposed A.B 1
because it allowed secondary boycotts, and had
not taken any position on the Brown-supported
bill, which both he and Chavez noted was
"confusing."
