## Getting Heard 
### 
The recent student strike and sit-in at Brown University is
a good example of a situation when students needed to take
militant action in order to have a voice in a university
decision-making process.
The Brown administration announced its decision to
make drastic budget cutbacks without any student
input, even though such cutbacks would have seriously
affected the quality of a Brown education. For example, the
proposal of instituting a 16.5 percent cut in faculty would
have drastically reduced the number of minority and women
teachers, most of whom are untenured.
Since other means of having their grievances considered
were proving futile, most of Brown's 5100 undergraduates
boycotted classes for four days. While the strike was not
directly successful in getting the university to negotiate, it
was effective in drawing nationwide attention to the Brown
controversy.
When the boycott produced no results, 3" minority
students staged a sit-in at University Hall, the administration
building. The Brown administration immediate Iv began
seriously negotiating with the demonstrators, wisely
deciding that conciliation was preferable to using force to
oust the demonstrators.
After only two days of negotiation, a settlement was
reached. While not acceding to all of the protesters'
demands, the university agreed to increase the proportion of
minority students and faculty over the next several years,
and granted the demonstrators full amnesty.
Donald Hornig, Brown's president, said later "We did not
agree to anything which would not have been considered
right and proper in the absence of a building occupation."
Perhaps this is true. It is clear, however, that the students at
Brown got more prompt and serious consideration of their
demands precisely because they did use demonstration
tactics.
The Brown strike and sit-in proved to be effective and
justifiable responses to a secret university decision-making
process which did not adequately take into account the
opinions of students. While not condoning such tactics in an
across-the-board fashion, we believe that the actions at
Brown should be considered by students at other universities
such as Stanford where students have similar problems in
being heard.
