# BAC Has Merit
## 
### 
The "no-union" election in the
medical center has passed, yet it
is still not too late to give you
more facts.
Before and after the election.
United Stanford Employees
Union (USE) has falsely stated
that the Black Advisory
Committee (BAC) is organized
and controlled by the hospital
administration. Actually, the BAC
is and has always been organized
and controlled, by those workers
who elect their representatives to
sit on the BAC — a process that
USE tried and failed.
It is amusing that USE should
speak of the BAC as being
controlled when USE itself is
controlled by its own parent
organization, the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU of the AFL-CIO). Part of
the monthly dues and fees
collected by USE must go to
SEIU; contracts signed by USE
must be approved by SEIU. So,
who is being controlled?
The USE paper, Employees
Organize, has contained quotes by
USE officers that show disrespect
of individuals and dishonesty
about itself. USE was
disrespectful because it attempted
to dishonor, through lies, people
dedicated to improving working
conditions of all people, especially
black people. USE was dishonest
because it attempted to mislead
voters.

Look at recent issues of
Employees Organize. Usually
almost half of the pictures in the
paper are of minority people, but
there are few minority
representatives on the powerful
executive board, and who are
stewards. Yet, from the pictures
in the USE paper, you would get
the opinion that minorities run
USE. Such is not the case.
USE was further dishonest in
stating that people were
intimidated. USE is correct in
part; USE did not further reveal
that it was doing the harassing and
intimidating in pressuring people
to make "donations" to USE and
to join it. If USE wishes to get the
vote, it must clear itself of
disrespect and dishonesty.
The hospital administration
should not misread the vote
against unions. A vote against
unions is. not a vote for
management! By the same token,
it cannot be said that the
administration's opposition to
unions is a vote for improved
employee benefits and fairness.
There are still many employee
problems in the medical center. Is
the administration willing to
correct them? Is USE still willing
— without harassing people to
make "donations"?

organization, the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU of the AFL-CIO). Part of
the monthly dues and fees
collected by USE must go to
SEIU; contracts signed by USE
must be approved by SEIU. So,
who is being controlled?
The USE paper, Employees
Organize, has contained quotes by
USE officers that show disrespect
of individuals and dishonesty
about itself. USE was
disrespectful because it attempted
to dishonor, through lies, people
dedicated to improving working
conditions of all people, especially
black people. USE was dishonest
because it attempted to mislead
voters.

Look at recent issues of
Employees Organize. Usually
almost half of the pictures in the
paper are of minority people, but
there are few minority
representatives on the powerful
executive board, and who are
stewards. Yet, from the pictures
in the USE paper, you would get
the opinion that minorities run
USE. Such is not the case.
USE was further dishonest in
stating that people were
intimidated. USE is correct in
part; USE did not further reveal
that it was doing the harassing and
intimidating in pressuring people
to make "donations" to USE and
to join it. If USE wishes to get the
vote, it must clear itself of
disrespect and dishonesty.
The hospital administration
should not misread the vote
against unions. A vote against
unions is. not a vote for
management! By the same token,
it cannot be said that the
administration's opposition to
unions is a vote for improved
employee benefits and fairness.
There are still many employee
problems in the medical center. Is
the administration willing to
correct them? Is USE still willing
— without harassing people to
make "donations"?
