# Gas Tax Better Than Rationing
## 
### 
Most people now agree that it is in our
national interest to reduce oil consumption,
and most people now agree that one of the
most socially desirable ways to accomplish
this reduction is through the use of less
gasoline and diesel fuel in transportation. We
can either do less transporting of ourselves
and our goods or we can use more efficient
transport systems or both.
A surprisingly large percentage of
automobile driving (about 75 percent) takes
place with one or two persons in the car at
speeds of less than 40 miles per hour on trips
of less than 10 miles distance.
For this service a small.
30-miles-per-gallon vehicle can provide about
the same comfort and convenience as present
American cars. If we change to a mix of car
sizes in which the majority of cars are small,
we can achieve the desired near-term
reduction in oil consumption without really
changing what we do.
Long-Term Effect
In the longer term, some reduction in
transporting will also have to occur, but only
a gradual reduction is required.
Several alternative mechanisms for
accmplishing this result are being considered,
the gas tax and rationing being the two most
prominent. Surprisingly, the precise forms of
these two mechanisms being considered are
rarely specifically defined in media accounts
of the subject. In fact, either mechanism can
be used in a wide variety of forms.
Only one form of each will be discussed
here. In my opinion, a sensible debate can
only be conducted if the alternatives are
clear.
Alternative 1, Gas tax: An income tax
rebate is given to all taxpayers. This rebate is

in the form of an income tax credit equal to
the amount of gas tax collected, less direct
administrative costs.
The average driver now spends about $600
per year for 1090 gallons of fuel at 55 cents
per gallon. Let us assume that a new gas tax
of $1 per gallon is imposed. The price of gas
would then be $1.55 per gallon, which is
comparable to the present price in Europe.
The average driver will then spend $1690 if
he doesn't reduce his consumption.
But the tax is imposed in order to induce
him to reduce his consumption of fuel, and
we assume that at a price of $1.55 per gallon
he will reduce fuel consumption by 20
percent within a period of six months to a
year, perhaps by changing to a smaller car.
He now purchases $1352 worth of fuel
per year, and, when he files his federal
income tax form, he receives a rebate of the
tax paid less administrative costs (assumed to
be three percent for the purpose of this
example). The average driver thus receives an
income tax credit of $846.
Objections
One objection to this alternative has been
the fact that many low-income persons who
now do not have to file income tax returns
will do so, in order to receive their rebates,
and that this will cause high administrative
costs. However, a rationing program will
almost certainly involve still higher
administrative costs.
This approach has also been viewed as
inflationary, but its main effect when the
rebate is taken into account is to shift
purchases from gasoline to other products.
An important additional feature of this
alternative is the ease with which rebates
could be varied with income, reducing the

Donald Dunn
rebates to users with high incomes if desired.
Alternative 2, Gas rationing: An equal
number of free coupons is mailed to each
registered automobile owner monthly. A
legal market in coupons is operated through
gas stations. Coupons can be bought or sold
freely, and gas can be purchased at a gas
station either with coupons or without.
Let us assume that the market value of
coupons reaches equilibrium at $1 per gallon
when a 20 percent reduction in consumption
is imposed, so that gas is available at 55 cents
per gallon with coupons and at $1.55
without. Note that, assuming the price of
gasoline is constant, one-gallon coupons will
sell for the same amount as a per-gallon tax,
if both result in a market equilibrium at a
level of consumption 20 percent below the
present level.
If administrative costs can be held to three
percent, there is thus very little difference
between the two approaches, other than the
"cross-subsidy" which, in the rationing
systems, results in net payments from users
of above-average amounts of gas to users of
below-average amounts of gas, without regard
to their incomes or wealth.
The gas tax approach avoids this transfer,
is easy to adjust, and also is likely to result in
lower administrative costs.
I therefore prefer Alternative 1 to
Alternative 2. However, the most important
point is that either mechanism can be used to
accomplish any desired reduction in
consumption and that the level of tax will be
about equal to the price of coupons for an
equivalent reduction in consumption.

alternative is the ease with which rebates
could be varied with income, reducing the

Donald Dunn
rebates to users with high incomes if desired.
Alternative 2, Gas rationing: An equal
number of free coupons is mailed to each
registered automobile owner monthly. A
legal market in coupons is operated through
gas stations. Coupons can be bought or sold
freely, and gas can be purchased at a gas
station either with coupons or without.
Let us assume that the market value of
coupons reaches equilibrium at $1 per gallon
when a 20 percent reduction in consumption
is imposed, so that gas is available at 55 cents
per gallon with coupons and at $1.55
without. Note that, assuming the price of
gasoline is constant, one-gallon coupons will
sell for the same amount as a per-gallon tax,
if both result in a market equilibrium at a
level of consumption 20 percent below the
present level.
If administrative costs can be held to three
percent, there is thus very little difference
between the two approaches, other than the
"cross-subsidy" which, in the rationing
systems, results in net payments from users
of above-average amounts of gas to users of
below-average amounts of gas, without regard
to their incomes or wealth.
The gas tax approach avoids this transfer,
is easy to adjust, and also is likely to result in
lower administrative costs.
I therefore prefer Alternative 1 to
Alternative 2. However, the most important
point is that either mechanism can be used to
accomplish any desired reduction in
consumption and that the level of tax will be
about equal to the price of coupons for an
equivalent reduction in consumption.

engineering-economic systems.)
Most people now agree that it is in our
national interest to reduce oil consumption,
and most people now agree that one of the
most socially desirable ways to accomplish
this reduction is through the use of less
gasoline and diesel fuel in transportation. We
can either do less transporting of ourselves
and our goods or we can use more efficient
transport systems or both.
A surprisingly large percentage of
automobile driving (about 75 percent) takes
place with one or two persons in the car at
speeds of less than 40 miles per hour on trips
of less than 10 miles distance.
For this service a small.
30-miles-per-gallon vehicle can provide about
the same comfort and convenience as present
American cars. If we change to a mix of car
sizes in which the majority of cars are small,
we can achieve the desired near-term
reduction in oil consumption without really
changing what we do.
Long-Term Effect
In the longer term, some reduction in
transporting will also have to occur, but only
a gradual reduction is required.
Several alternative mechanisms for
accmplishing this result are being considered,
the gas tax and rationing being the two most
prominent. Surprisingly, the precise forms of
these two mechanisms being considered are
rarely specifically defined in media accounts
of the subject. In fact, either mechanism can
be used in a wide variety of forms.
Only one form of each will be discussed
here. In my opinion, a sensible debate can
only be conducted if the alternatives are
clear.
Alternative 1, Gas tax: An income tax
rebate is given to all taxpayers. This rebate is

in the form of an income tax credit equal to
the amount of gas tax collected, less direct
administrative costs.
The average driver now spends about $600
per year for 1090 gallons of fuel at 55 cents
per gallon. Let us assume that a new gas tax
of $1 per gallon is imposed. The price of gas
would then be $1.55 per gallon, which is
comparable to the present price in Europe.
The average driver will then spend $1690 if
he doesn't reduce his consumption.
But the tax is imposed in order to induce
him to reduce his consumption of fuel, and
we assume that at a price of $1.55 per gallon
he will reduce fuel consumption by 20
percent within a period of six months to a
year, perhaps by changing to a smaller car.
He now purchases $1352 worth of fuel
per year, and, when he files his federal
income tax form, he receives a rebate of the
tax paid less administrative costs (assumed to
be three percent for the purpose of this
example). The average driver thus receives an
income tax credit of $846.
Objections
One objection to this alternative has been
the fact that many low-income persons who
now do not have to file income tax returns
will do so, in order to receive their rebates,
and that this will cause high administrative
costs. However, a rationing program will
almost certainly involve still higher
administrative costs.
This approach has also been viewed as
inflationary, but its main effect when the
rebate is taken into account is to shift
purchases from gasoline to other products.
An important additional feature of this
alternative is the ease with which rebates
could be varied with income, reducing the

Donald Dunn
rebates to users with high incomes if desired.

Alternative 1, Gas tax: An income tax
rebate is given to all taxpayers. This rebate is

in the form of an income tax credit equal to
the amount of gas tax collected, less direct
administrative costs.
The average driver now spends about $600
per year for 1090 gallons of fuel at 55 cents
per gallon. Let us assume that a new gas tax
of $1 per gallon is imposed. The price of gas
would then be $1.55 per gallon, which is
comparable to the present price in Europe.
The average driver will then spend $1690 if
he doesn't reduce his consumption.
But the tax is imposed in order to induce
him to reduce his consumption of fuel, and
we assume that at a price of $1.55 per gallon
he will reduce fuel consumption by 20
percent within a period of six months to a
year, perhaps by changing to a smaller car.
He now purchases $1352 worth of fuel
per year, and, when he files his federal
income tax form, he receives a rebate of the
tax paid less administrative costs (assumed to
be three percent for the purpose of this
example). The average driver thus receives an
income tax credit of $846.
Objections
One objection to this alternative has been
the fact that many low-income persons who
now do not have to file income tax returns
will do so, in order to receive their rebates,
and that this will cause high administrative
costs. However, a rationing program will
almost certainly involve still higher
administrative costs.
This approach has also been viewed as
inflationary, but its main effect when the
rebate is taken into account is to shift
purchases from gasoline to other products.
An important additional feature of this
alternative is the ease with which rebates
could be varied with income, reducing the

Alternative 2, Gas rationing: An equal
number of free coupons is mailed to each
registered automobile owner monthly. A
legal market in coupons is operated through
gas stations. Coupons can be bought or sold
freely, and gas can be purchased at a gas
station either with coupons or without.
Let us assume that the market value of
coupons reaches equilibrium at $1 per gallon
when a 20 percent reduction in consumption
is imposed, so that gas is available at 55 cents
per gallon with coupons and at $1.55
without. Note that, assuming the price of
gasoline is constant, one-gallon coupons will
sell for the same amount as a per-gallon tax,
if both result in a market equilibrium at a
level of consumption 20 percent below the
present level.
If administrative costs can be held to three
percent, there is thus very little difference
between the two approaches, other than the
"cross-subsidy" which, in the rationing
systems, results in net payments from users
of above-average amounts of gas to users of
below-average amounts of gas, without regard
to their incomes or wealth.
The gas tax approach avoids this transfer,
is easy to adjust, and also is likely to result in
lower administrative costs.
I therefore prefer Alternative 1 to
Alternative 2. However, the most important
point is that either mechanism can be used to
accomplish any desired reduction in
consumption and that the level of tax will be
about equal to the price of coupons for an
equivalent reduction in consumption.
