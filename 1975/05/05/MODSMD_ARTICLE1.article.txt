### RICHARD FEARON 
The formation of the
Vietnamese Refugee Assistance
Committee (VRAC) to aid the
adjustment of some 50,000 to
80,000 Vietnamese refugees to
the ways of American society was
formally announced here Friday
morning.
At a press conference held in
Memorial Church, Robert
Hamerton-Kelly dean of the
chapel and chairman of VRAC,
explained the committee's
purpose and future activities.
VRAC will have two general
functions, he said: organization of
Vietnamese and American
volunteers to hand out packets of
information, provided by the
committee to all incoming
refugees; and provision of a list of
service organizations, both public

Vietnamese Refugee Assistance Committee, explained in
Vietnamese the purpose and future activities of the committee. Du Long issued
his appeal before television cameras for future broadcast
and private, which are offering help to
refugees.
To deal with any further problems
of incoming Vietnamese, the
committee has organized a nationwide,
toll-free phone number, to be
answered by Vietnamese-speaking
volunteers, to refer callers to other
agencies or specific members of the
committee who can advise them.
The informative packets will
contain a manual informing refugees
of the culture and customs found in
the United States; information on
employment, business and industrial
centers; a map indicating areas least
affected by unemployment; a list of
industries, businesses and professions
in greatest and least demand in
America today; and social security
forms, medical care and schooling
information.
Hamerton-Kelly noted that "a
unique situation has arisen in the
United States.... It seems to those of
us who formed this committee that it
is our responsibility to take care of the
refugees."
"The moment these people arrived
in the United States, the problems of
politics ended . . . the problems of war
ended.... What we have now are
human beings who need help," said
Hamerton-Kelly. "It is simple human

decency for us to care for them."
Pointing out that Congress had just
voted down a measure to give
assistance to refugees, he claimed that
"the private sector should come
forward and provide what the
government cannot or will not
provide."
The committee realizes that there
will be resentment of the incoming
refugees among unemployed
Americans, he stated.
"But resentment is not a laudable
sentiment," said Hamerton-Kelly. "To
impede these people would be
contrary to our tradition of civil
rights."
VRAC, a branch of the
International Aid to the Children of
Vietnam organization, was formed at
the urging of the Vietnamese
community, said Hamerton-Kelly.
Presently, the committee is composed
of both American and Vietnamese
residents of the United States, he said,
estimating its membership at nearly
70.
"Pat" Du Long, co-chairman of the
committee and an ex-South
Vietnamese diplomat, read an appeal
in Vietnamese 1 for the television
coverage at the meeting. This appeal
relayed information about the
committee to Vietnamese listeners.
