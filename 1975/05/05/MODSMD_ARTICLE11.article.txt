# Get Bugs Out Of Draw System
## 
### John Freed 
It's Spring Housing Draw time. Freshmen
and transfer students are, as usual,
expressing confusion and apprehension. The
rest of us who entered the draw, on the
other hand, are apprehensive and confused.
Ignore the fact that only a handful of
people on campus really comprehend the
draw. Forget about those Lambda Nudies
who always seem to get back in.
Just contemplate your 2682 and wonder
if you'll get back on campus at all.
Have A Happy
The man who gets most of the flak these
days is Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton, also known as the "housing czar."
The draw has become an institution under
Horton — as have complaints about
insufficient or inadequate housing.
Yet — despite claims to the contrary by
fraternities — Horton has made a
conscientious effort to get student input on
the housing system. The housing
subcommittee of the Committee On Student
Services has influenced much of the
decision-making at the housing office this
year.
And, the draw itself has shown some
progress.
Thanks For Nothing
For example, for the first time this year
students had a chance to mark "Any
Lagunita" or "Any Co-Ed Row House" as
draw choices. Those of us who marked down
six Lag houses and two Row houses as our
first-round choices last year — before
drawing a miserable number — appreciated
the effort.
A few further reforms suggest themselves.
One change would be to let students list
eight choices they do not want. For
example, after listing certain Lag, Row and
ex-frat houses, a student now must
either take a random assignment or no
assignment at all. Under this revision, a

student could say "Please do not assign me
to: Phi Sig, Manzanita, Mirrielees, Any
Stern, Any Wilbur."
The Wait Begins
Two drawbacks become apparant. First,
the paperwork in the housing office would
go up. Students must now wait an
interminable time to get Round One results;
the delay would get even longer.

A second problem would involve those
who received fairly good — not great —
numbers. They would receive random
assignment within the vast middle-range of
choices. Ah, well. . . .
Another proposal, suggested to me by
many people, is to let a student find out his
number before putting down his Round One
choices. Horton coYnmented on the
suggestion.
"They could. It doesn't make any
difference, if you fully understand the draw.
Processing would be considerably more
difficult," Horton explained.
Swell Idea
When pressed on the matter further,
Horton said he had not seen a groundswell
of student support for the idea. Let the
swelling begin.
Drawing before choosing would allow
students to make realistic first-round
choices, giving them the chance to get into

housing they want.
A third revision would establish sign-up
lists for housing. Students could sign house
lists depending on the first letter of their last
name — much as class lists are handled at
registration time.
Students For Equity
Students could use some foresight in
determining their housing — and,
presumably, everyone would get the
equivalent of Manzanita housing at least
once. Equity.
The thrust of these proposals is to
eliminate some of the uncertainties which
face students who draw. Uncertainty is
probably the most maddening aspect of the
present draw system.
Horton himself has conceded this point,
and has taken steps to alleviate the problem.
The Guaranteed Housing Program, which
takes effect with this year's freshmen, gives
those students a target year when they
should expect to be tossed off-campus.
'UNASSIG'
And that knowledge is valuable. Some
students used to breeze through four years
on campus, while others were placed in that
popular Row house, "UNASSIG," after
Round Two for up to two years running.
But you'd never know until April what
September would bring.
These revision plans assume the draw will
remain relatively intact. Abolition of the
draw is not out of the question, however —
even Horton admits, "The draw is no sacred
cow."
Students who give a damn about where
they'll live — and who will decide — should
give the matter some thought and let Horton
know.
