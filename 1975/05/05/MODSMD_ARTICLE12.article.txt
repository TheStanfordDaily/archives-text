Parking Sanity
Charles Meyers, head of the
University Committee on Land
and Building Development
which just recently submitted a
revised parking plan, should be
commended for adding sanity to
a disturbed and belabored issue.
The Carpenter Report, which
Meyers's report now supersedes,
was a real shock to me. No
matter how "reasonable"
charges may be, an increase of
480 percent in fees (as the
Carpenter Report proposed) has
to smell like a ripoff.
While University employees
may have some difficulties with
their fees, these may gradually
be resolved by salary and wage
adjustments similar to the
adjustments planned for
residents. The overall scope of
the report is acceptable,
although l would hope that
before it is finally accepted some
more detailed figures will be
given indicating exact collections
and dispositions.
The major unknown in the
committee's greatly improved
report is where these parking
fees shift from being a payment
for services one uses to being a
subsidy for future services one
may never use.
As a first step, the University
should concentrate on making
those who use a service pay for
it, and then later, gradually, the
emphasis on subsidization of
needed auxiliary services can be
increased.
Few will object to paying for
what they get, but this issue has
been too upsetting to too many
people for them to accept
paying $20 to $48 a year for
"bike paths."

War Was Futile
Editor:
The Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC) has recently
stated that "this is a time for
great happiness and celebration"
(Daily, April 30).
It quoted Ho Chi Minh saying
that "after sorrow comes joy."
The ARC's delusions are
understandable â€” the war in
Vietnam is over, so it feels
reason to rejoice. However, it
seems to be missing the point.
Though the fighting is over, the
effects of the war linger on.
Much of the country has been
ravaged by bombing, deflation
defoliation, etc., making it unfit
for agriculture. It is common
knowledge that these effects last
for many decades. Most
important, hundreds of
' thousands have died in the 30
years of war which resulted in
nothing. The ultimate outcome
is the same as it would have been
had no fighting occurred.
The ARC says to celebrate? I
; say its members are fools.
