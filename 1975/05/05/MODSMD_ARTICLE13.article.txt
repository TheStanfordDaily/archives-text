# Spray Cans Imperil Environment Safety
## 
### 
Scientists have often warned
that of the 50,000 industrial
chemicals now in use, one may
eventually endanger human
existence. Recently these
"doomsday" warnings have been
confirmed by findings that focus

on an unlikely culprit — the
aerosol spray can.
Scientists now believe that
fluorocarbons, the propellant
gases within spray cans, are
capable of destroying the earth's
ozone layer, and with it, life
itself.
The ozone layer is a
protective shield in the
stratosphere that filters out the
sun's powerful ultraviolet rays.
Excessive ultraviolet radiation
causes cancer and premature
aging of the skin. Ultraviolet
radiation also breaks down
DNA, the genetic building block
of life, causing mutations and
birth defects.
Ozone Depletion
The already severe world
food shortage would be
worsened by ozone depletion.
High ultraviolet radiation retards
plant growth and can be
particularly lethal to agricultural
species. Ozone depletion would
also lowei atmospheric heat,
decreasing world agricultural
yields.
Finally, excessive ultraviolet
radiation impedes the growth of
plankton, the vital first link in
the marine food chain, and the
primary source of world oxygen.
In short, substantial ozone
depletion could shatter the
ecological structure that permits
man to remain alive on this
planet.
A serious aspect of the
fluorocarbon threat is that it
strikes after a time lag. It takes
years after release for the
fluorocarbons to reach the
stratosphere, where the chlorine
within them breaks down ozone.
Because of this "time-bomb"
effect, once ozone depletion
becomes indisputable, there will

be enough fluorocarbons in the
atmosphere to increase radiation
some years later by catastrophic
proportions.
If there is no ban by 1980,
and fluorocarbon use increases
at the current annual rate, a
Harvard study predicts a drastic
four-fold radiation increase by
1994.
No Antidote
There is no technological
solution to the above threat. No
chemical process can remove
fluorocarbons from the air once
they are released.
Even so, governmental
concern with the fluorocarbon
threat has been minimal. No
government agency — not even
the Environmental Protection
Agency — is willing to touch this
political hot potato.
What can an individual do?
The natural start is to stop
buying aerosol spray cans.
Action Is Possible
In the University community,
several more actions can be
taken.
Students considering working
for DuPont, Allied Chemical,
Union Carbide, Pennwalt, Kaiser
Chemical or Racon should
consider their plans in view of
these firms' roles in
manufacturing fluorocarbons.
Professors consulting for or
having a research grant from one
of these companies should make
similar ethical considerations.
Faculty with professional
reputations or access to the
media should call both their
colleagues and the public's
attention to the aerosol threat.
Any scientist who feels social as
well as academic responsibilities
should take a stand on a

fluorocarbon ban.
Finally, writing to one's
congressman, while hardly
exciting, is infinitely more
effective than inaction.
In many respects other than
the aerosol threat, we are
proceeding along a collision
course with ecological
catastrophe. Overpopulation,
resource depletion, nuclear
warfare and reactors — all pose
threats equal to that of
fluorocarbons. But what makes
the aerosol issue unique is the
simplicity of its solution. One

Fried/and, Hemel

legislative enactment or agency
ruling would eliminate the
problem entirely. The aerosol
issue therefore is a litmus test. If
it is solved, it is a sign that we
have the energy and persistence
to attack more complex
environmental problems. If it
remains ignored, this and other
threats are likely to overwhelm
us. The stake of the effort is
nothing less than the habitability
of the planet.

"doomsday" warnings have been
confirmed by findings that focus

on an unlikely culprit — the
aerosol spray can.
Scientists now believe that
fluorocarbons, the propellant
gases within spray cans, are
capable of destroying the earth's
ozone layer, and with it, life
itself.
The ozone layer is a
protective shield in the
stratosphere that filters out the
sun's powerful ultraviolet rays.
Excessive ultraviolet radiation
causes cancer and premature
aging of the skin. Ultraviolet
radiation also breaks down
DNA, the genetic building block
of life, causing mutations and
birth defects.
Ozone Depletion
The already severe world
food shortage would be
worsened by ozone depletion.
High ultraviolet radiation retards
plant growth and can be
particularly lethal to agricultural
species. Ozone depletion would
also lowei atmospheric heat,
decreasing world agricultural
yields.
Finally, excessive ultraviolet
radiation impedes the growth of
plankton, the vital first link in
the marine food chain, and the
primary source of world oxygen.
In short, substantial ozone
depletion could shatter the
ecological structure that permits
man to remain alive on this
planet.
A serious aspect of the
fluorocarbon threat is that it
strikes after a time lag. It takes
years after release for the
fluorocarbons to reach the
stratosphere, where the chlorine
within them breaks down ozone.
Because of this "time-bomb"
effect, once ozone depletion
becomes indisputable, there will

be enough fluorocarbons in the
atmosphere to increase radiation
some years later by catastrophic
proportions.
If there is no ban by 1980,
and fluorocarbon use increases
at the current annual rate, a
Harvard study predicts a drastic
four-fold radiation increase by
1994.
No Antidote
There is no technological
solution to the above threat. No
chemical process can remove
fluorocarbons from the air once
they are released.
Even so, governmental
concern with the fluorocarbon
threat has been minimal. No
government agency — not even
the Environmental Protection
Agency — is willing to touch this
political hot potato.
What can an individual do?
The natural start is to stop
buying aerosol spray cans.
Action Is Possible
In the University community,
several more actions can be
taken.
Students considering working
for DuPont, Allied Chemical,
Union Carbide, Pennwalt, Kaiser
Chemical or Racon should
consider their plans in view of
these firms' roles in
manufacturing fluorocarbons.
Professors consulting for or
having a research grant from one
of these companies should make
similar ethical considerations.
Faculty with professional
reputations or access to the
media should call both their
colleagues and the public's
attention to the aerosol threat.
Any scientist who feels social as
well as academic responsibilities
should take a stand on a

fluorocarbon ban.
Finally, writing to one's
congressman, while hardly
exciting, is infinitely more
effective than inaction.
In many respects other than
the aerosol threat, we are
proceeding along a collision
course with ecological
catastrophe. Overpopulation,
resource depletion, nuclear
warfare and reactors — all pose
threats equal to that of
fluorocarbons. But what makes
the aerosol issue unique is the
simplicity of its solution. One

Fried/and, Hemel

legislative enactment or agency
ruling would eliminate the
problem entirely. The aerosol
issue therefore is a litmus test. If
it is solved, it is a sign that we
have the energy and persistence
to attack more complex
environmental problems. If it
remains ignored, this and other
threats are likely to overwhelm
us. The stake of the effort is
nothing less than the habitability
of the planet.
