## 'Fiction Is An Art Of Discovery' Nancy Packer Thinks Writing Can Be Taught 
### D. LODATO 
"Maybe I don't teach
anybody about writing, but I
know it can be done with a good
teacher because Dick Scowcroft
and Wallace Stegner taught me a
lot about writing."
Creative writing teacher
Nancy Packer's statement lends
insight not only to her character
but to her abilities as well.
Emeritus English Prof. Wallace
Stegner says:
"She's the best creative
writing teacher I know. She
opens her heart, house and mind
to students."
Techniques
Packer believes teachers can
help young writers save time by
developing their critical faculties
in critical supportive situations.
She also believes teachers can
help develop a conception of the
techniques of fiction — the
"how things are made" idea.
For Packer, this conception
would be the result of a close
relationship with a writer's
works — such as the works of a
Hemingway or Faulkner.
And Packer also notes the
more obvious contribution of
creative writing teachers:
allowing students a closer touch
with themselves.
An Act
"Writing fiction is an art of
discovery. You discover your
own attitudes toward the human
condition. You can't start with a
big general philosophy and then
make the characters conform to
this pre-conception," Packer
notes.
"The characters would not be
allowed to come alive. Rather,"
she explains, "a successful short
story starts v/ith — as Faulkner
says — 'a memory, a picture, an
image, 'and the process is to see
what leads up to that picture."
"Maicolm Cowley [the
literary critic] once said,
'characters have ideas but writers
have characters.'
"Writing is an expression of
maturity."

This philosophy is shared by
the other teachers at Stanford's
creative writing center. They are
traditionalists who like realism,
not the experimental.
In past years,different schools
of thought have emerged from
the center. It all depends on who
has residency.
Packer came to Stanford with
her late husband, a law professor,
from a public relations position
in Birmingham, Alabama. In
1958 she qualified as a Wallace
E. Stegner Fellow in creative
writing.

She completed the program
in 1960 after attaining a masters
degree from the University of
Chicago in theology. In 1968 she
became an assistant professor.
Politics
"I always thought I wanted
to be a politician," Packer
recalls. "I gave it up. I really like
to teach."
Her father was a congressman
for 22 years and Packer served as
campaign manager for her
brother in a victorious
congressional contest. Currently
she is meeting her political

interests by aiding Palo Alto
Mayor Byron Sher.
'Feisty'
Whether in class or a cocktail
party she is viewed as feisty,
gutsy, intelligent and
enthusiastic. Director of the
Writing Center Richard
Scowcroft describes her as
"constantly talking about ideas,
challenging, arguing, praising and
disagreeing.
"She is stimulated by
differences of opinion although
she has strong ones of her own,"
Scowcroft says.

A former student compared
Packer to Katharine Hepburn:
"really intelligent and really
adamant. Almost a 'masculinity'
but actually very feminine
underneath it all. She's a
romantic."
Action
The center's secretary, Dolly
Kringel says, "Nancy's
everything wonderful in this
world except her feisty side."
Apparently there's a little
bull-headedness in Packer, whose
decisions as a member of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies affect many
undergraduates.
"I like to be where the action
is," Packer says, "where things
are going on even if it's not
going my way. If you're not
willing to serve on committees,
you're not going to have much
effect on the University.
"But all women and
minorities are overworked in
that regard." She continues, "We
are providing a little institutional
guidance without depriving
students of much freedom."
For Nancy Packer, the future
seems to hold nothing but
further accomplishment. A
member of no less than five
University committees and an
author who's published "widely
but not well," she has three new
stories which will appear in, as
she says, "various obscure
journals."
She hopes to write a novel
(more than one publisher has
asked her to) and possibly a
textbook for teachers
concerning the real problems of
writing.
Can Nancy Packer teach
anybody about writing*? Some
think writing cannot be taught.
But many call her
the "ultimate" teacher for
undergraduates on the creative
writing circuit.

attitudes toward the human conditions," she says. Packer at one time thought she'd become a
politician and since has served on numerous University committees.
"Maybe I don't teach
anybody about writing, but I
know it can be done with a good
teacher because Dick Scowcroft
and Wallace Stegner taught me a
lot about writing."
Creative writing teacher
Nancy Packer's statement lends
insight not only to her character
but to her abilities as well.
Emeritus English Prof. Wallace
Stegner says:
"She's the best creative
writing teacher I know. She
opens her heart, house and mind
to students."
Techniques
Packer believes teachers can
help young writers save time by
developing their critical faculties
in critical supportive situations.
She also believes teachers can
help develop a conception of the
techniques of fiction — the
"how things are made" idea.
For Packer, this conception
would be the result of a close
relationship with a writer's
works — such as the works of a
Hemingway or Faulkner.
And Packer also notes the
more obvious contribution of
creative writing teachers:
allowing students a closer touch
with themselves.
An Act
"Writing fiction is an art of
discovery. You discover your
own attitudes toward the human
condition. You can't start with a
big general philosophy and then
make the characters conform to
this pre-conception," Packer
notes.
"The characters would not be
allowed to come alive. Rather,"
she explains, "a successful short
story starts v/ith — as Faulkner
says — 'a memory, a picture, an
image, 'and the process is to see
what leads up to that picture."
"Maicolm Cowley [the
literary critic] once said,
'characters have ideas but writers
have characters.'
"Writing is an expression of
maturity."

This philosophy is shared by
the other teachers at Stanford's
creative writing center. They are
traditionalists who like realism,
not the experimental.
In past years,different schools
of thought have emerged from
the center. It all depends on who
has residency.
Packer came to Stanford with
her late husband, a law professor,
from a public relations position
in Birmingham, Alabama. In
1958 she qualified as a Wallace
E. Stegner Fellow in creative
writing.

She completed the program
in 1960 after attaining a masters
degree from the University of
Chicago in theology. In 1968 she
became an assistant professor.
Politics
"I always thought I wanted
to be a politician," Packer
recalls. "I gave it up. I really like
to teach."
Her father was a congressman
for 22 years and Packer served as
campaign manager for her
brother in a victorious
congressional contest. Currently
she is meeting her political

interests by aiding Palo Alto
Mayor Byron Sher.
'Feisty'
Whether in class or a cocktail
party she is viewed as feisty,
gutsy, intelligent and
enthusiastic. Director of the
Writing Center Richard
Scowcroft describes her as
"constantly talking about ideas,
challenging, arguing, praising and
disagreeing.
"She is stimulated by
differences of opinion although
she has strong ones of her own,"
Scowcroft says.

A former student compared
Packer to Katharine Hepburn:
"really intelligent and really
adamant. Almost a 'masculinity'
but actually very feminine
underneath it all. She's a
romantic."
Action
The center's secretary, Dolly
Kringel says, "Nancy's
everything wonderful in this
world except her feisty side."
Apparently there's a little
bull-headedness in Packer, whose
decisions as a member of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies affect many
undergraduates.
"I like to be where the action
is," Packer says, "where things
are going on even if it's not
going my way. If you're not
willing to serve on committees,
you're not going to have much
effect on the University.
"But all women and
minorities are overworked in
that regard." She continues, "We
are providing a little institutional
guidance without depriving
students of much freedom."
For Nancy Packer, the future
seems to hold nothing but
further accomplishment. A
member of no less than five
University committees and an
author who's published "widely
but not well," she has three new
stories which will appear in, as
she says, "various obscure
journals."
She hopes to write a novel
(more than one publisher has
asked her to) and possibly a
textbook for teachers
concerning the real problems of
writing.
Can Nancy Packer teach
anybody about writing*? Some
think writing cannot be taught.
But many call her
the "ultimate" teacher for
undergraduates on the creative
writing circuit.

FROM POLITICS TO WRITER — Nancy Packer has combined talent and persistence to become the
"ultimate" creative writing teacher. "Writing fiction is an act of discovery. You discover your own
attitudes toward the human conditions," she says. Packer at one time thought she'd become a
politician and since has served on numerous University committees.
"Maybe I don't teach
anybody about writing, but I
know it can be done with a good
teacher because Dick Scowcroft
and Wallace Stegner taught me a
lot about writing."
Creative writing teacher
Nancy Packer's statement lends
insight not only to her character
but to her abilities as well.
Emeritus English Prof. Wallace
Stegner says:
"She's the best creative
writing teacher I know. She
opens her heart, house and mind
to students."
Techniques
Packer believes teachers can
help young writers save time by
developing their critical faculties
in critical supportive situations.
She also believes teachers can
help develop a conception of the
techniques of fiction — the
"how things are made" idea.
For Packer, this conception
would be the result of a close
relationship with a writer's
works — such as the works of a
Hemingway or Faulkner.
And Packer also notes the
more obvious contribution of
creative writing teachers:
allowing students a closer touch
with themselves.
An Act
"Writing fiction is an art of
discovery. You discover your
own attitudes toward the human
condition. You can't start with a
big general philosophy and then
make the characters conform to
this pre-conception," Packer
notes.
"The characters would not be
allowed to come alive. Rather,"
she explains, "a successful short
story starts v/ith — as Faulkner
says — 'a memory, a picture, an
image, 'and the process is to see
what leads up to that picture."
"Maicolm Cowley [the
literary critic] once said,
'characters have ideas but writers
have characters.'
"Writing is an expression of
maturity."

This philosophy is shared by
the other teachers at Stanford's
creative writing center. They are
traditionalists who like realism,
not the experimental.
In past years,different schools
of thought have emerged from
the center. It all depends on who
has residency.
Packer came to Stanford with
her late husband, a law professor,
from a public relations position
in Birmingham, Alabama. In
1958 she qualified as a Wallace
E. Stegner Fellow in creative
writing.

She completed the program
in 1960 after attaining a masters
degree from the University of
Chicago in theology. In 1968 she
became an assistant professor.
Politics
"I always thought I wanted
to be a politician," Packer
recalls. "I gave it up. I really like
to teach."
Her father was a congressman
for 22 years and Packer served as
campaign manager for her
brother in a victorious
congressional contest. Currently
she is meeting her political

interests by aiding Palo Alto
Mayor Byron Sher.
'Feisty'
Whether in class or a cocktail
party she is viewed as feisty,
gutsy, intelligent and
enthusiastic. Director of the
Writing Center Richard
Scowcroft describes her as
"constantly talking about ideas,
challenging, arguing, praising and
disagreeing.
"She is stimulated by
differences of opinion although
she has strong ones of her own,"
Scowcroft says.

A former student compared
Packer to Katharine Hepburn:
"really intelligent and really
adamant. Almost a 'masculinity'
but actually very feminine
underneath it all. She's a
romantic."
Action
The center's secretary, Dolly
Kringel says, "Nancy's
everything wonderful in this
world except her feisty side."
Apparently there's a little
bull-headedness in Packer, whose
decisions as a member of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies affect many
undergraduates.
"I like to be where the action
is," Packer says, "where things
are going on even if it's not
going my way. If you're not
willing to serve on committees,
you're not going to have much
effect on the University.
"But all women and
minorities are overworked in
that regard." She continues, "We
are providing a little institutional
guidance without depriving
students of much freedom."
For Nancy Packer, the future
seems to hold nothing but
further accomplishment. A
member of no less than five
University committees and an
author who's published "widely
but not well," she has three new
stories which will appear in, as
she says, "various obscure
journals."
She hopes to write a novel
(more than one publisher has
asked her to) and possibly a
textbook for teachers
concerning the real problems of
writing.
Can Nancy Packer teach
anybody about writing*? Some
think writing cannot be taught.
But many call her
the "ultimate" teacher for
undergraduates on the creative
writing circuit.
