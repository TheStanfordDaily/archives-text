# McCloskey Backs Funds For SLAC
## 
### 
The new $74-niillion
high-energy physics project for
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) received the
support of Rep. Paul (Pete)
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) at a
recent congressional
subcommittee hearing.
McCloskey's testimony
before the House Public Works
Appropriations Subcommittee
last Thursday came as a surprise
to SLAC Director Wolfgang
Panofskv.
But Panofsky said the
testimony was good news.
Building funds for a preliminary
design and engineering plans for
the $74 million Positron-
Electron Project (PEP) were
authorized by Congress last year.
The project was to be built
jointly by the University of
California's Lawrence
Laboratory and Stanford.
Not Appropriated
However, the funds were
never included in the Ford
Administration's budget request
for the Energy Research and
Development Administration
(ERDA), nor were they
appropriated for fiscal year
1976.
PEP will be an underground
ring inside the present SLAC
boundary which the University

has leased to the federal
government, Panofsky said.
Approximately half of the ring
will be tunneled under the
existing accelerator.
Panofsky said. "There will be
very little to see."
Scientists would be able to
create electron-posi tron
collisions in the new plant of
much greater reaction energy
than is possible by means of
conventional accelerators.
Panofsky said.
Discoveries
McCloskey told the
subcommittee that with the
present accelerators, scientists
found three new atomic particles.
He said, "The present SLAC
accelerator is uniquely
well-suited to act as a source of
electron and positron beams.
"The addition of PEP would
provide a four-fold increase in
reaction energies of the most
powerful existing machine.
"During recent years, the U.S.
has consistently devoted a
relatively lower level of funding
to accelerator improvements. To
continue this pattern could
seriously impair our leadership
role in this field of science,"
McCloskey said.
"PEP has received excellent
support from the American high
energy physics community and
is recommended by ERDA's
High-Energy Physics Advisory
Panel. It ranks as the highest
priority construction project
within ERDA's Physical
Research Program."
