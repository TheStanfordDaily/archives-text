## Card Nine's Dreams Flicker 
### DAN PYNE 
WESTWOOD - Los Angeles.
City of dreams and dreamers. A
vast forest of houses and
buildings spread between the
mountains and the ocean,
quartered and sectioned by
ribbons of grey highway.
It was in The City that the
Stanford baseball team proved
it was a legitimate Pacific
Eight title contender with a
series victory over Southern Cal
earlier this season.
It was in The City this
weekend that the Cardinals kept
that dream alive. Barely.
The Cards swept a
doubleheader from UCLA in the
smog, 4-3 in the first game and
13-3 in the nightcap, after
dropping a 9-5 decision Friday.
With an 8-7 league record the
Cards now need to sweep Cal
next weekend, and hope that
UCLA can sweep league-leading
use.
Friday, plagued by Sawtelle's
short fences (the park was
dubbed "the Fenway Park of the
Pac-8" by KZSU's Bob Dean),
Card starter John Yandle gave
up three home runs in six

innings. Although Stanford
made a late rally, the Bruins
notched their sixth victory of
the season.
Stanford scored first, but
Bruins' catcher Dennis Delaney
led off the second with a
towering fly that just dropped
over the left field fence. Venoy
Garrison and Bobby Dallas later
homered. All of the Bruin
four-baggers were short, and
would have been outs on Sunken
Diamond.
The Cards picked up four
runs in the ninth, paced by Dave
Baker's two-run single, but it
was not enough.
Saturday the tables turned.
Mike Williamson, who has
seen little action on the mound
recently due to an injured arm,
started and had a one-hitter
going through the fifth inning,
before giving up a homer to
Bruin center fielder Dave Peniall.
The Card scoring was opened
by a solo Bob Hampton homer
in the fourth, Hampton's 10th
home run of the season.
Shortstop Steve Davis was
bunted in from third by Dave
Perez for another run in the

fifth. In the sixth, Randy Wong
drove in two more runs.
UCLA put pressure on in the
last two innings, and Williamson
was relieved by Stanford's ace,
A 1 Arthur. The tall right-hander
picked up a save for
one-and-two-thirds innings of
work.
And then he started the
nightcap.
Arthur, now 8-4, gave up
three runs on four hits in a
rocky first inning, then settled
down and limited the Bruins to
one base hit in the remaining
eight
Stanford racked the three
UCLA pitchers for 16 hits,
including catcher Bruce
Robinson's 11th home run of
tl.e year in the sixth inning. The
400-foot-plus shot tied the
school record for most home
runs in a single season.
Tom Guardino batted in four
of the Card tallies. Designated
hitter Gary Bei scored three
times and picked up one RBI.
Davis led the Cardinal defense
with some spectacular plays at
shortstop.

AND AFTER ONE MILE — Inches were all that separated Cal's Jim Harris and Stanford's Terrv
Crowley as they finished the mile run in yesterday's Big Meet. Only a last second lunge by the spent
Harris who toured the course in 4:09.3 — prevented Crowley from taking first Crowlev was
one-tenth of a second behind at 4:09.4.
