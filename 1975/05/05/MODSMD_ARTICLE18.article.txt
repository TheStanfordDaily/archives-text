Tennis
Which is Stanford's best
athletic team this year?
Well, Stanford's women's
tennis team did not lose a single
match in winning the Northern
California Intercollegiate
Athletic Association title Friday
and Saturday.
Any other questions?
The Cards took first in the
17-team event with 24 points,
outclassing second place
finishers Fresno State and
UC-Davis with 15 each.
Lele Forood, at first singles,
was (horrors!) forced into
going the full three sets in the
semis with Leslie Airioa of Cal,
but came back to win the finals
over Debbie Cator of Davis, 6-4,
6-2.
Marcy O'Keefe and Pat
Delaney won all their matches at
second and third singles. In
doubles, Liza Pande-Whitney
Grant, Andrea Barnes—Tracy
Macnair and Joy Hahn-Mary
Anderson all won all their
matches.
Crew
In what seems to be an
annual event, the Stanford crew

lived down to the yearly
headline this weekend as they
left for Smogville full of hope
and returned with only the
mutter of "next year."
Friday, the crewmen took on
UCLA and USC in the annual
Harbach Cup Regatta before a
large crowd at San Pedro. UCLA
and SC battled each other for
the first 1200 meters, with
Stanford hanging a boatlength
back.
At that, point, Stanford
started its sprint, which carried
the Cards by a tiring Trojan boat
and within a few feet of the
Bruins — and that's where they
finished. For the third time this
season the Cards had lost a race
by less than a second.
The undefeated junior varsity
fell prey to the L.A. jinx as well,
finishing second behind the
UCLA jayvees, who hadn't won
a race all season. The frosh also
followed the script, beating USC
but losing to the Bruin frosh.

Saturday, the varsity got a
second shot at UCLA in a race at
Long Beach which also included
UC-Irvine and Long Beach State.
What figured to be a two-boat
race between Stanford and
UCLA didn't materialize as
Irvine jumped out to a
commanding lead and held off
the charging UCLA and Stanford
eights to take the victory. The
Cards once again fell barely
short of beating the Bruins.

Golf
Stanford golfers were
successful in both charitable and
intercollegiate competition
Friday.
Mike Peck eagled the 18th
hole at Spring Valley Golf
Course for a five-under-par 66,
leading the Cards to
simultaneous victories over two
collegiate opponents.
Jay Johnston and Ray Navis
contributed 72s as Stanford
rolled past Santa Clara 14-4 and

the University of British
Columbia 16-2.
Meanwhile, Conrad Nilmeier
fired a 73 to capture the annual
Heart Fund tournament at Palo
Alto Hills Country Club.
Nilmeier defeated teammate
Dave Baskins and former touring
pro John Lotz in a sudden-death
playoff for the championship.
Baskins won the long-driving
contest with a 303-yard shot on
the 18th hole.

simultaneous victories over two
collegiate opponents.
Jay Johnston and Ray Navis
contributed 72s as Stanford
rolled past Santa Clara 14-4 and

the University of British
Columbia 16-2.
Meanwhile, Conrad Nilmeier
fired a 73 to capture the annual
Heart Fund tournament at Palo
Alto Hills Country Club.
Nilmeier defeated teammate
Dave Baskins and former touring
pro John Lotz in a sudden-death
playoff for the championship.
Baskins won the long-driving
contest with a 303-yard shot on
the 18th hole.
Tennis
Which is Stanford's best
athletic team this year?
Well, Stanford's women's
tennis team did not lose a single
match in winning the Northern
California Intercollegiate
Athletic Association title Friday
and Saturday.
Any other questions?
The Cards took first in the
17-team event with 24 points,
outclassing second place
finishers Fresno State and
UC-Davis with 15 each.
Lele Forood, at first singles,
was (horrors!) forced into
going the full three sets in the
semis with Leslie Airioa of Cal,
but came back to win the finals
over Debbie Cator of Davis, 6-4,
6-2.
Marcy O'Keefe and Pat
Delaney won all their matches at
second and third singles. In
doubles, Liza Pande-Whitney
Grant, Andrea Barnes—Tracy
Macnair and Joy Hahn-Mary
Anderson all won all their
matches.
Crew
In what seems to be an
annual event, the Stanford crew

lived down to the yearly
headline this weekend as they
left for Smogville full of hope
and returned with only the
mutter of "next year."
Friday, the crewmen took on
UCLA and USC in the annual
Harbach Cup Regatta before a
large crowd at San Pedro. UCLA
and SC battled each other for
the first 1200 meters, with
Stanford hanging a boatlength
back.
At that, point, Stanford
started its sprint, which carried
the Cards by a tiring Trojan boat
and within a few feet of the
Bruins — and that's where they
finished. For the third time this
season the Cards had lost a race
by less than a second.
The undefeated junior varsity
fell prey to the L.A. jinx as well,
finishing second behind the
UCLA jayvees, who hadn't won
a race all season. The frosh also
followed the script, beating USC
but losing to the Bruin frosh.

Saturday, the varsity got a
second shot at UCLA in a race at
Long Beach which also included
UC-Irvine and Long Beach State.
What figured to be a two-boat
race between Stanford and
UCLA didn't materialize as
Irvine jumped out to a
commanding lead and held off
the charging UCLA and Stanford
eights to take the victory. The
Cards once again fell barely
short of beating the Bruins.

Golf
Stanford golfers were
successful in both charitable and
intercollegiate competition
Friday.
Mike Peck eagled the 18th
hole at Spring Valley Golf
Course for a five-under-par 66,
leading the Cards to
simultaneous victories over two
collegiate opponents.
