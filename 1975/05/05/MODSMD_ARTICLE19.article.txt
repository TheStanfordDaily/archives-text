# Big Meet Ends In Biggest Loss

Stanford Sports Information Director Gary Cavalli — always on
the lookout for that unique angle which will raise an otherwise
humdrum sports write-up out of the depths of boredom — thought
he'd hit upon a gem for this year's Big (track) Meet with California.
In fact, Cavalli explained it even before the meet got underway.
"You see," he said, gesturing with his right hand, "Mike
Langford is going to throw the shotput for the first time today."
Langford, ah, let's see, didn't he kick a field goal or something
in the last second to beat Cal in the Big (football) Game?
"Right," Cavalli continued. "A 50-yard field goal. And today
he's going to throw the shot 50 feet and were gonna beat Cal
73-72."
Well, Langford actually threw 48-11 to finish third, but a
hero he was not. Cal never gave him the chance to be a hero of this
meet as they literally ran the Stanford track team into the ground
103-42.
The Bears swept three events and won 13 of 17 on the way to
their biggest win ever over the Cardinals. The last time anyone ran
up a score like that in the Big Meet was 43 years ago when
Stanford clubbed Cal 101 1 /2-29'/2.
OK, so team-wise it was a disaster. But there were some fine
individual performances turned in. Tony Sandoval recorded an
outstanding 8:53.6 — a personal best in the two mile — while
holding off a final charge by Cal's Wolfgang Schmulewicz.
Bob Flint won a personal duel with Cal's Dennis Drew in the
pole vault. Clearing 16-0 on his first attempt, Flint had to sit back
and watch Drew fail three times at the same height before picking
up the blue ribbon. It was one of the few events that the crowd
really was able to warm to.
Bob Hall and Matt Hogsett both came off the injured list to take
the triple jump and the 440 intermediate hurdles. Hall leaped
48-1 Vi while Hogsett raced away from the field to win the hurdles
in 51.8. He bested his nearest rival by a full second.
Other than that, the meet was a disappointment from a
Stanford viewpoint.
Longjumper James Lofton proved he hasn't fully recovered
from a groin injury when he defaulted on his last jump and lost to
Cal's Gerald Smith. Lofton's best of 23-9 was well off his best leap
of the year.
Stanford's Ben Scheible did put on an impressive performance in
the 880, even though he was bested by Cal's world class half-miler
James Robinson.Scheible turned in a personal best of 1:50.1.
