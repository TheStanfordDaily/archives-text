# Residential Study Program 'Zapped'
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The first Stanford-in-Stanford
residential study program was
cancelled last week because ZAP
House, selected for the program, did
not fill during the first round of the
housing draw.
Only 25 men and five women
obtained a priority and chose the
49-space International Relations and
Arms Control program house as a first
choice housing assignment, according
to Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton. Of those, 20 men and
five women were assigned to the house
in a test run of the draw.
Four men and nine women who
listed the Stanford-in-Stanford house
as less than a first choice also were
assigned to the house, Horton noted.
Hence, only 24 of the 26 places
assigned to men and only 14 of the 23
places assigned to women were filled,
Horton said.
Horton claimed that the program
would not have been viable with 11
spaces unfilled.
Casualties
Nine students (eight men and one
woman) with priority to draw for the
house were above the cutoff number
in the first round and therefore were
not assigned. Horton noted. In
addition, five men and six women with

priority for the program listed the
house as less than a first choice and
were therefore assigned to other
residences.
Horton noted that he considered
moving the new French theme house
from its smaller Guthrie House to ZAP
and moving the Stanford-in-Stanford
program to Guthrie.
The Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) discussed that
possibility on Thursday and voted to
exchange the houses with the consent
of the French house's organizers.
COSS voted against moving the house
without their consent, however,
Horton said.
French Opposed
Asst. French Prof. David Brostoff
consulted other French house
organizers and told Horton that they
were adamantly opposed to moving
the house.
Brostoff claimed that ZAP is too
far from Bechtel International Center,
Hammarskjold House for international
students and the French Department.
He added that ZAP has "an
intangible atmosphere that would not
be conducive to the type of
atmosphere we are seeking."
Expected No Problems
"When the current ZAP house was
allocated for the International

Relations and Arms Control program,
tne sponsors expected no difficulty in
filling the house before the draw,"
Horton said. "That expectation was
not fulfilled, and it has not proved
feasible to move the program to
another house at this late date."
Horton said he was surprised that
so few women chose to participate in
the program.
"We should have been more aware
that not many women planned to
participate," Horton said. "There is
such a tendency to believe in sex
equality that we sometimes forget that
certain choices do reflect sex
differences."
Blames Publicity
Although Horton claimed that the
program was well publicized, Tom
Glenn, co-creator of the
Stanford-in-Stanford concept, blamed
the lack of student interest on a dearth
of publicity, and said much of that
which was received was unfavorable.
"Last fall, the Daily treated the
program as a foolish proposal," Glenn
said yesterday."The program was
treated in a fairly mocking manner and
the Daily created the impression that
the program was doomed because it
was unrealistic."
Glenn admitted that many of the
features of the original program were

unfeasible, but he claimed that the
revised plan for the program devised
early this year was indeed viable.
Un workable
According to Glenn, the original
plan to have five faculty members live
in the house was unworkable because
no faculty members were willing to
live in the house, which allegedly
provided inadequate facilities for
families.
The plan to have students take 15
units of the house's theme subject
each quarter also proved unworkable,
Glenn said. The plan as revised last
quarter allowed participants to take
most of their classes in other areas, but
provided for coordination of courses
taken by participants, Glenn
explained.
However, Glenn, Horton and ASSU
President Mike Herman, also a designer
of the program, expressed optimism
about the future of the
Stanford-in-Stanford concept.
Glenn predicted that enough
students could be found to participate
in a program for the 1976-77 school
year.
He mentioned American studies
and black studies programs as possible
themes.
