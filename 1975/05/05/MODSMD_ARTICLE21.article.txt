# Questions Mark Pair Of Net Wins
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
Can John Whitlinger return to
top form? Is undefeated Jim
Delaney as good as his
dual match record? Where do
Pat DuPre, Nick Saviano and
Gene Mayer belong in the
Stanford tennis lineup?
These questions were
certainly not answered during
the Cardinal netters' weekend
routs of the University of San
Diego (8-1) and Cal (9-0).
Whitlinger, whose consistency
propelled him to the NCAA
singles championship a year ago,

played the most inconsistent
tennis of the weekend. The
Stanford number-one player
easily outclassed San Diego's
NCAA College Division
champion Andy Rae on Friday,
but his Saturday showdown with
Cal's Doug King was a different
story.
Whitlinger threatened to
demolish the veteran King twice
during their match — in the first
set, which Whit took, 6-2, and at
the beginning of the third, when
he was serving and ahead 4-0 in
games.
But King gave Whitlinger a lot
of trouble during the rest of the
match. Perhaps lulled by his easy
first-set win, the Stanford star
lost the second set 1-6. And with
King's serve working well and his
groundstrokes often passing
Whitlinger at the net, King came
roaring back to tie the final set
6-6.
Several untimely muffed
shots by King allowed Whitlinger
to win the decisive tiebreaker,
5-1.
Meanwhile, the two players
who have looked best against
Whitlinger, San Jose State's
Hank Pfister and USC's Butch
Walts, both lost matches last

weekend. Pfister was upset ,by
Long Beach State's Curt
Condon, while UCLA's Billy
Martin dominated Walts in
straight sets. UCLA beat the
Trojans overall, 6-3.
Delaney, who climbed to the
second singles position this
week, looked devastating in two
easy wins against clearly inferior
opponents.
After sitting out Friday's
match to rest a pulled groin
muscle, Saviano had little
trouble with Cal's fourth-best
player, Manuel Castenada.
Gene Mayer ran well and
volleyed well in his return to
action, teaming . with Perry
Wright to defeat Cal's second
doubles team. Mayer, one of the

Cards' key singles players,
showed few ill effects from the
back injury he suffered two
weeks ago.
DuPre? The Cards' biggest
question mark didn't play at all
over the weekend, leaving
doubts whether he will be ready
for the Pac-8 tournament that
starts a week from Thursday.

tennis of the weekend. The
Stanford number-one player
easily outclassed San Diego's
NCAA College Division
champion Andy Rae on Friday,
but his Saturday showdown with
Cal's Doug King was a different
story.
Whitlinger threatened to
demolish the veteran King twice
during their match — in the first
set, which Whit took, 6-2, and at
the beginning of the third, when
he was serving and ahead 4-0 in
games.
But King gave Whitlinger a lot
of trouble during the rest of the
match. Perhaps lulled by his easy
first-set win, the Stanford star
lost the second set 1-6. And with
King's serve working well and his
groundstrokes often passing
Whitlinger at the net, King came
roaring back to tie the final set
6-6.
Several untimely muffed
shots by King allowed Whitlinger
to win the decisive tiebreaker,
5-1.
Meanwhile, the two players
who have looked best against
Whitlinger, San Jose State's
Hank Pfister and USC's Butch
Walts, both lost matches last

weekend. Pfister was upset ,by
Long Beach State's Curt
Condon, while UCLA's Billy
Martin dominated Walts in
straight sets. UCLA beat the
Trojans overall, 6-3.
Delaney, who climbed to the
second singles position this
week, looked devastating in two
easy wins against clearly inferior
opponents.
After sitting out Friday's
match to rest a pulled groin
muscle, Saviano had little
trouble with Cal's fourth-best
player, Manuel Castenada.
Gene Mayer ran well and
volleyed well in his return to
action, teaming . with Perry
Wright to defeat Cal's second
doubles team. Mayer, one of the

Cards' key singles players,
showed few ill effects from the
back injury he suffered two
weeks ago.
DuPre? The Cards' biggest
question mark didn't play at all
over the weekend, leaving
doubts whether he will be ready
for the Pac-8 tournament that
starts a week from Thursday.

Can John Whitlinger return to
top form? Is undefeated Jim
Delaney as good as his
dual match record? Where do
Pat DuPre, Nick Saviano and
Gene Mayer belong in the
Stanford tennis lineup?
These questions were
certainly not answered during
the Cardinal netters' weekend
routs of the University of San
Diego (8-1) and Cal (9-0).
