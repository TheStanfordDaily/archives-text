'Executions Ordered In Cambodia*
NEW YORK — Newsweek magazine reported
yesterday that U.S. Intelligence had intercepted
radio orders from the communist regime in
Cambodia calling for the execution of thousands of
supporters of the defeated Lon Nol government.
Newsweek said the messages indicated the
killings would apply to all officers of the
Cambodian army and their wives, down to the rank
of second lieutenant.
Saigon Adjusts
SAIGON — South Vietnam's new rulers have
formed a military committee to provide security
for Saigon and return the city to normalcy, the
Saigon radio said yesterday.
Named to head the committee was Gen. Trail
Van Tra, who headed the 1968 Tet offensive
against Saigon, according to radio reports
monitored in Bangkok.
The Viet Cong's Liberation radio, believed based
in North Vietnam, Hanoi radio and Saigon radio
are the only sources of news from the South
Vietnamese capital since telecommunications were
cut on surrender day.
Soldiers have been instructed to turn in their

weapons, civil servants to get back to work,
workers to lengthen their hours and bar girls to
seek other employment, according to reports.
Orders presumably directed at the Viet Cong
themselves forbade committing crimes in their
movement's name, and everyone has been told to
protect lives and property.
Other radio reports said former navy men have
been urged to bring in their warships from off the
South Vietnamese coast and not "run after the
Americans," and that overseas diplomats of the old
regime have been told to prepare to tuni over
money and embassy property.
The Revolutionary Government, which took
over after Saigon surrendered to the Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese last Wednesday, also announced
it wants South Vietnam's seat at the United
Nations, Liberation Radio said.
U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim has said
action will begin on Vietnam's membership when
the new government sends an envoy to U.N.
headquarters in New York.
INew Refugees Crowd Guam
AGANA, Guam The instant city of
Vietnamese immigrants, thrown up on this Pacific
island less than two weeks ago, is beginning to
burst at the seams.
While evacuees fastidiously cleaned their tents
and hung out laundry, the stench of overused
outhouses permeated the camp, adding to the
discomfort of oppressively humid weather.
The U.S. Navy, alerted that perhaps 80,000
more refugees are on their way, intensified efforts
to rush thousands of earlier arrivals toward the
mainland.
The "New Life" evacuation airlift gained speed
yesterday, flying refugees to resettlement camps on
the mainland at the rate of 4000 every 24 hours,
and will soon move 6000 a day to keep pace with
the influx.
The former vice president of South Vietnam,
Nguyen Cao Ky, arrived yesterday on Guam,
joining the swelling ranks of refugees from his
homeland.
Meanwhile, at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida,
344 Vietnamese refugees were welcomed by
cheering spectators yesterday and the Niceville
High School Band played "America the
Beautiful."
Eglin is the third refugee center to open. Camp
Pendleton, Calif., and Fort Chaffee, Ark., started
receiving refugees last week.

Doctors Continue Boycott
SAN FRANCISCO — Most Northern California
surgeons and anesthesiologists appear determined
in their boycott against soaring malpractice
insurance rates despite threatened hospital closures
and layoffs, a physicians' insurance broker said
yesterday.
Hospitals in the eight Northern California
counties affected by the rate hikes began cutting
back staffing and services as doctors refused all but
emergency surgery.
Public hospitals and clinics — whose doctors
need not carry their own insurance — reported they
were able to handle all emergency surgery cases
referred to them by private institutions.
Congress Considers New Bills
WASHINGTON — Congress considers strip
mining, the farm bill and a new consumer
protection agency this week.
Sens. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) and Claiborne Pell
(D-R.1.) said Saturday they will introduce a bill to
provide whatever funds are needed to help
Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees resettle in this
country.
Estimates of the cost of the refugee program
have ranged up to $500 million.
Senate supporters of a bill to create a federal
consumer protection agency predict passage by a
margin wide enough to override an expected veto
by President Ford.
