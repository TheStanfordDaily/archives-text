A "clean bill of health" notice
accompanied the return of
Mountain Dew soda to campus
vending machines over the
weekend.
Cans of the sweet yellow-green
drink were removed from the
machines after April 16 when a
medical center employee became ill
after taking a sip from a can.
Chemical tests performed on
that can and its contents turned up
nothing. According to Deputy
Director of Purchasing Thomas
Killebrew, the final report said
explicitly that no contaminants
were found, either in the drink
itself or on the can.
