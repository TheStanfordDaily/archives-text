# Housing Draw Cutoffs 'Revealed'
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Cutoffs for this year's first round
draw are 2001 for men and 3125 for
women, the Daily learned late
yesterday from a computer printout
obtained by a student who wished
to remain anonymous.
However, Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton would not verify
the results of the program. "This is a
pirated copy [made] at some stage of
the process," he said. "We will do
some elaborate cross checks and
manual checks" to determine the final
cut-off numbers for the first round.
Those checks will be made, Horton
said, before this Thursday, the
tentative release date for the official
draw results.

The anonymous student reportedly
intercepted the program while it was
being run by Richard Wales, .vho is in
charge of computer processing for the
draw. The student then secured a copy
of the results using his own computer
account.
Wales warned that even if one had a
present residence assignment and were
ahead of the cutoff, it is not a 100
percent guarantee of admittance to the
house.
This is because present residence
statuses were granted to some students
now attending overseas campuses and
because a few dorms will have
different ratios of freshmen to other
students for next year, stated Wales.
Wales anticipated no foul-ups in the

computer assignments. "We've spent
considerable time checking over the
results to make sure they are
accurate," he said. "We are sure that
they are correct."
Among those getting assignments in
first round were John Barth, Jeffrey
Gerecke and Paul Ruddy, a group of
"guaranteed" freshmen who drew
number 5000. They all currently live
in Branner Hall.
Barth and Ruddy have been
assigned to Burbank House in Stern
Hall next year, and Gerecke is bound
for Manzanita Park.
Drawing number 0001 was Ruben
Sanchez, a "guaranteed" freshman
currently living in Cardenal. Sanchez
chose Alpha Sig as his first choice.
