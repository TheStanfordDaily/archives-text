# Groups Plan Alternate Graduation Ceremony
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Several groups are planning an
alternate commencement ceremony on
graduation day as a protest against
commencement speaker Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
Currently a Harvard professor of
government, Moynihan has attracted
criticism from some campus groups
over alleged poor scholarship in his
works on the problems of black
Americans.
Charles Ogletree, graduate student
in political science and former ASSU
vice president, said alternate
commencement will be on Sunday,
June 15. Ogletree said "its main
purpose will be to provide an alternate
ceremony for black seniors, black
parents and [all J those receiving
M.A.'s and Ph.D.'s."
Ogletree stressed that the special
ceremony is "open to any graduating
student who doesn't want to attend

the University's commencement."
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig said he had "no
feelings" about the alternate
commencement "because I don't
know anything about it. I would like
to know more about it."
Interference
Rosenzweig said the possibility of
University interference with the
alternate ceremony "depends on
where it's held and the circumstances.
People can do what they want if they
don't interfere with the
commencement. No law says you have
to go to commencement."
Ogletree claimed that "the response
from many of the black parents has
been that they intend to attend the
alternate commencement." He added
that "there will be joint participation
and cooperation from other ethnic
communities."
Speakers for the alternate
commencement still have not been
confirmed, Ogletree said. He would
not discuss possible sites for the
alternate ceremony, stating "we're not
expecting the administration to give
anything or any assistance â€” it goes
against their philosophy. But I
don't think they will do anything
to prevent it."
Usual Procedure
Ogletree mentioned that "there has
usually been an alternate ceremony for
ethnic minorities for the last few years
to bring the families together."
Members of other minority groups
have joined in supporting Ogletree's
position. MEChA spokeswoman Maria

Echaveste said chicano faculty, staff
and students passed a resolution in
early April supporting the black
students. "We felt that inviting
Moynihan to give the commencement
speech was a serious insult."
Echaveste said that "we will help
them in any way the blacks see fit."
* "We do support the black
community," said Sharon Malotte,
spokeswoman for the Stanford
American Indian Organization, but
Malotte did not know of the alternate
commencement proposal. "We will
help in a campaign if asked," she said.
Asians In Favor
Last Friday the Stanford Asian
Students Coordinating Committee
(SASCC) voted in favor of a position
paper opposing Moynihan's speaking
at graduation.
The paper stated that "Moynihan's
selection is the latest episode in this
administration's callous regard for
ethnics of color. The action is not only
an insult to the sensibilities of ethnic
parents and students, but an exercise
in abuse on the part of the University's
public relations machine."
SASCC stated that it regards "the
Moynihan invitation as an indication
of Stanford's waning commitment to
all ethnics of color," and has urged
"concerned members of the Stanford
community to boycott the
commencement exercises at which
Moynihan will speak."
A teach-in Wednesday at 7 p.m. in
the Physics Tank will deal with
Moynihan's scholarship.
