# Publication Revived For Next Fall
## More Course Reviews Planned 
### BETSY MORRIS 
The ASSU Course Review will not be published this
spring, the Senate Commission on the Course Review
announced Friday. The raw data that has been collected
for this year's publication will instead be used for a
revised Course Guide to come out next autumn and
winter quarters, according to Commission Chairwoman
Debbi Siiton.
The commission was formed after the April 14
resignation of its editors — Paul Sobotka, Valerie Tonat
and Clifford Schireson — who quit their jobs because of
lack of both funding and support of their policy board.
The commission has set Sept. 1 as the tentative date
for the publication of the first Course Guide, citing that
date as a time when the review will be most useful to
students in choosing courses.
Consumer's Guide
"We want the publication to be a type of consumer's
guide that students can focus on at the moment of
decision [on a quarter's courses]," said Bob Nelson, a
commission member. Bill Hoke, another member, added
that it would be "a supplement to the time schedule."
The commission plans to publish the newsprint guide
at least three times a year- at autumn registration and at
winter and spring pre-registrations, Siiton said. According
to Hoke, the Guide hopefully will expand its current
coverage of approximately 500 courses to include
four-fifths of the classes here.
However, the commission does not now know exactly
how many courses it will be able to afford to cover. "That
is a matter of how much money we have and how much
we can get," Siiton said. "Hopefully we will be able to
extend our coverage to graduate courses, but what we are
aiming for now is an excellent undergraduate review."
More Money Needed
The new guide "will take greater amounts of money,"
Hoke pointed out. Earlier this quarter Siiton had said that
the Guide possibly could receive up to $4000 of ASSU
Senate funding.

But Hoke claimed Friday that the commission now
expects the Publications Board to be its major source of
funding.
He added that the commission still expects some senate
funding, though not the total $4000, in addition to
income from ad and sales revenues.
ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri said that
because the new Course Guide is a publication, "it has
become painfully apparent that this body [the Pub
Board] should be funding some of the Guide's expenses."
Indicating that a decision would be up to the Pub
Board, Board Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky said that he
could not "foresee any serious objection to at least giving
some money to the course review."
Questionnaire Distribution
Beginning this quarter, questionnaires will be
distributed and collected during the same class period by
the Guide's own staff members rather than by the
professor, as is now the case, according to Silton.
This, she pointed out, "will encourage a high response
rate and ensure the student's right to confidentiality."
Unless a student specifically indicates that he or she
wishes the professor to see a questionnaire, it will not be
made public, she said.
The revised Guide will emphasize statistical data with
less stress on written judgments. It will indicate how
department majors, non-majors and graduate students
have ranked specific courses and will compare them to
other University courses, Silton added.
Instead of editors, the Guide staff will be headed by a
project manager who will be a liaison directly responsible
to the policy board. Three assistants — in charge of
finances, publishing and data — will work under him,
along with an army of course reporters who will be paid a
yet undetermined sum for their work, according to
Nelson.
Olivieri said that this new structure hopefully will take
care of the lack of organization that has plagued the
Course Review staff in the past.
