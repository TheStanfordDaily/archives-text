# Rain An Ironic Reminder To Drought Fund Hikers
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
The weather was cool and overcast as 35 walkers began their 12-mile
trek through Palo Alto Saturday morning.
The scattered raindrops were an ironic reminder to the participants
in the African Famine Relief Walkathon of the reason for the hike: the
terrible drought which killed tens of thousands in the African Sahel over
the past few years.
Rains have recently returned to the region, but famine lingers on in
Northwest Africa.
"The famine is not over," said Charles Ogletree, organizer of the
walkathon and former ASSU vice president. "What has happened is that
the famine is no longer a severe famine, but it is still a famine
nevertheless."
Part of the area's problem is its lack of water storage facilities in its
losing, climatic tug-of-war with the neighboring Sahara Desert. Over
250,000 square miles of once-fertile land have been turned to desert sands.
Funds raised by the African Famine Relief Committee here are
earmarked for construction of dams in the Sahel, according to Ogletree.
The walkathon raised "up to $1300" in pledges, Ogletree said. One
graduate student collected $500 in pledges from fellow employees, and
several University administrators contributed substantial amounts.
The committee will collect funds from two other campus events this
year, the first the upcoming Stanford Carnival.
The committee also will sponsor a "non-dinner" May 27. Participants
will receive a slice of bread and butter and a glass of water for a $5
contribution.
By that time the committee hopes to have collected "no less than
$10,000 and hopefully as much as $15,000 or $20,000," Ogletree said.
