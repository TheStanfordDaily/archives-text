## Iran Contract 
### 
The $970,000 contract between the Communication
Department and the government of Iran to link rural
areas of Iran through a satellite network is one which
should never have been signed.
Principal investigators of the contract, such as
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker, assert that the
contract will help educate the Iranian people, and rhat
such education is a prerequisite to social change. But
technological advances in communication are
double-edged swords. They can be used not only to
propagate the flow of ideas but to stifle them through
propaganda. Technology, researchers must learn, is not
neutral.
Given the past conduct of the Shah in repressing
dissenters, we cannot be confident that this
communication satellite will be used solely to teach
Iranian citizens. A powerful tool such as this one may
well be used to consolidate and extend the Shah's power,
even though it was not designed for that purpose.
We believe that Parker and his fellow researchers did
not adequately take this into account when deciding to
go ahead with this contract.
Before signing such an important contract, researchers
should conclusively demonstrate that the service they
provide is certain to be used for beneficial purposes. We
do not think the Shah's word that it will be used
constructively is good enough.
Despite our opposition to this contract, however, we
must defend Parker's right to pursue it if he so chooses.
Academic freedom implies that a person granted standing
as an academician should be able to pursue any research
that is within the law. Stanford's policy on academic
research, which states that a researcher can accept just
about any work as long as it is not kept secret, is a wise
one.
We only wish that in this case, Parker and his
associates had required a higher standard of proof before
going ahead with the project.
