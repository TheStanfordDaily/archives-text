# Parking Proposal
## 
### 
With regard to the Peter
Carpenter report on parking and
transportation, I would like to
make some comments and
suggest some alternative
proposals.
The survey of "...practices
at more than 46 universities in
the United States and Canada"
appears aimed more at
comparisons of fee structures
than viable alternative modes of
transportations.
Outrageous use of taxes at
schools with other fees (e.g.,
tuition) comparable to Stanford
doesn't logically justify
escalating parking fees to those
same heights.
All letters previously alluding
to the financial hardships upon
students which would follow
adoption of the Carpenter report
are personally well taken.
Proposed fees, though on a far
less punitive scale, for faculty
and staff appear reasonable.
Attempts by ourselves and
neighbors to self-regulate car
usage (e.g., through carpooling),
would now seem token gestures
only by Carpenter's standards;
yet we could almost certainly
not afford the exorbitant fees
suggested in recent weeks merely
to meet the day-to-day
commitments and requirements
of normal living.
While concurring that present
and future building density
precludes any plan to equitably
distribute and/or increase
parking facilities around center
campus as it now exists, the
following proposals might, if
taken in tandem, provide a
reasonable solution.

First, conversion of the areas
both adjacent to Tresidder
Union now a parking area, and
fronting the quadrangle facing
Palm Drive to multilevel, below
ground facilities (both for
aesthetic and financial reasons)
would provide needed spaces.
Reasonable hourly and/or
daily fees for visitors and
quarterly fees for faculty, staff
and appropriate others could
fund such construction as it has
at numerous other sites.
Similar facilities might be
appropriate for the medical
center, where the present
Californian (as opposed to
Eastern) concept of spreading
one s self out rather than up (or
down) engulfs many acres of
land.
Second, outlying parking
areas could be built (and
similarly financed) far removed
from any likely building sites, a
partial solution if, third, the trial
shuttle bus service were
expanded to include those areas
on an all-day and early-evening
basis. Complete financing of
shuttle bus services, enlarged to
include frequent stops at
strategic points (perhaps even to
selected off-campus points),
could be arranged through
minimal fees (on the order of
two or three dollars) paid yearly
by anyone wishing to obtain a
bus pass (nontransferable).
This program, incidentally,
has successfully solved a like
problem at the University of
Connecticut for the past several
years.
