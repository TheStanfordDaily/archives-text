# 'Bridge' Is Useful Service
## 
### 
A small number of dedicated and energetic
students have been maintaining the Bridge as a
peer counseling center, growth center and drop-in
center for the past four years.
After a recent class meeting of SWOPSI 109,
which prepares students to staff the Bridge, we
got into a discussion about how it was that the
Bridge was being under-utilized by students.
What emerged was for me an old story which I
have heard every quarter for the last 16
quarters and it has to do with a stereotype about
the Bridge which I wish to correct.
The students who were talking with me are
enthusiastic about the potential of the Bridge as a
helping place for all students. They said that they
formerly had held the following impressions and
stereotypes about the Bridge:
—It was run by long-haired, dope-smoking
freaks.
—It was a self-serving, cliqueish group of
muddle-headed leftovers from the hippie
subculture who were preaching love and
understanding and all sorts of sensual indulgences.
—It was a place where only very disturbed
students with very serious personal problems or
drug problems would go.
These students went on to discuss at length
how these stereotypes were misleading and
untrue. The truth is that the Bridge is staffed by
well-trained and competent peer counselors who
receive export training and consultation and are
available to the Stanford community from 10
a.m. until midnight, five days a week and who
maintain a hotline which is available 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.

The Bridge sponsors workshops which provide
exciting paraformal learning experiences for
students and nonstudents at no charge and several
hundred people attend those workshops each
academic year.
The Bridge initiated and has continued to
produce the magnificent festival of joy and fun
each year, namely, the Spring Faire; this event
requires enormous energy and dedication on the
part of the Bridge counselors and is the principal
fund-raising event which enables the Bridge to
continue.
The Bridge is sponsored by the dean of student
affairs and the Health Service who provide
professional assistance and professional time for
teaching and consultation; the University provides
the building and some maintenance services but
the Bridge pays all bills.
The Bridge is very interested in working with
individuals and with groups, especially living
groups, and is interested in providing listening
skills training to students in any department or
residence, especially those students who are
working as house associates.
As a human resource, it is incredibly
underestimated and under-used at this time. I call
it to the attention of Daily readers as an option
for them at a time when they simply want to
discuss a situation, whatever it might be, with
another student who has had training and can be
available to students in a way that professionals
cannot be.

academic year.
The Bridge initiated and has continued to
produce the magnificent festival of joy and fun
each year, namely, the Spring Faire; this event
requires enormous energy and dedication on the
part of the Bridge counselors and is the principal
fund-raising event which enables the Bridge to
continue.
The Bridge is sponsored by the dean of student
affairs and the Health Service who provide
professional assistance and professional time for
teaching and consultation; the University provides
the building and some maintenance services but
the Bridge pays all bills.
The Bridge is very interested in working with
individuals and with groups, especially living
groups, and is interested in providing listening
skills training to students in any department or
residence, especially those students who are
working as house associates.
As a human resource, it is incredibly
underestimated and under-used at this time. I call
it to the attention of Daily readers as an option
for them at a time when they simply want to
discuss a situation, whatever it might be, with
another student who has had training and can be
available to students in a way that professionals
cannot be.

A small number of dedicated and energetic
students have been maintaining the Bridge as a
peer counseling center, growth center and drop-in
center for the past four years.
After a recent class meeting of SWOPSI 109,
which prepares students to staff the Bridge, we
got into a discussion about how it was that the
Bridge was being under-utilized by students.
What emerged was for me an old story which I
have heard every quarter for the last 16
quarters and it has to do with a stereotype about
the Bridge which I wish to correct.
The students who were talking with me are
enthusiastic about the potential of the Bridge as a
helping place for all students. They said that they
formerly had held the following impressions and
stereotypes about the Bridge:
—It was run by long-haired, dope-smoking
freaks.
—It was a self-serving, cliqueish group of
muddle-headed leftovers from the hippie
subculture who were preaching love and
understanding and all sorts of sensual indulgences.
—It was a place where only very disturbed
students with very serious personal problems or
drug problems would go.
These students went on to discuss at length
how these stereotypes were misleading and
untrue. The truth is that the Bridge is staffed by
well-trained and competent peer counselors who
receive export training and consultation and are
available to the Stanford community from 10
a.m. until midnight, five days a week and who
maintain a hotline which is available 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.

The Bridge sponsors workshops which provide
exciting paraformal learning experiences for
students and nonstudents at no charge and several
hundred people attend those workshops each
academic year.
