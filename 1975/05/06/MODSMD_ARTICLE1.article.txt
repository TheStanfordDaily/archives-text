# Students At UCSB Protest University Minority Policy
## 
### KATHY JACKSON 
Over 700 students at UC-Santa
Barbara yesterday afternoon rallied in
front of the administration building
protesting university budget policies
toward minority students as 25
hel meted policemen blocked the
building's doors.
Yet even as student leaders
picketed the building, university
officials were turning down the first of
the student demands — for a
sanctioned student moratorium of
classes Wednesday afternoon — while
postponing action on three others.
Organized by a coalition of
minority students, yesterday's protest
was the second in as many days at
Santa Barbara and the latest in a wave
of student demonstrations across the
country.
A similar budget furor at Brandeis
University ended Sunday when 35
students left buildings they had
occupied for five days. Their demands
for major increases in scholarships,
faculty and administrative staffing at
the Waltham, Mass. campus were
turned down by university officials
after a weekend of talks.
More Demonstrations Predicted
Meanwhile, in Santa Barbara,
tension had been mounting during the

past week over administration
decisions to phase out certain parts of
the black and chicano studies
programs.
Yesterday's demonstration, though
protesting the termination of the
minority programs, was also fueled in
part by student reaction to an aborted
protest of the night before, according
to Jim Tang, a staff writer on the
UCSB Daily Nexus.
Until student demands are
successfully met, Tang said he
predicted many more demonstrations
— "probably" one today and
"definitely" one tomorrow.
Twenty-three students were
arrested early yesterday morning by
flak jacketed policemen and sheriff's
deputies some four hours after they
seized the university's $14 million
computer center.
Spotlight Minorities
Entering the center shortly after 9
p.m. Sunday, students bolted the
computer center gate with bike locks
and chains. It took police nearly half
an hour to break down the barrier
with heavy bolt cutters.
Though asserting that "if we go, the
machines go." protestors did not
damage the computer and offered
little resistance as they were led to

police vans. A spokesman for the
coalition said that the takeover was
done to spotlight minority problems,
not to damage the computer system.
Nevertheless, students involved in
the actual sit-in as well as three
protestors outside, were arrested on
charges ranging from trespassing and
disturbing the peace, to failure to
disburse and resisting arrest.
Demands yesterday stressed
amnesty for those students arrested in
the takeover, as well as increased
funding and the appointment of
full-time directors for both the black
and chicano study centers. None of
the demands were acted upon.
Administrators maintained a "you
guys blew it last night" attitude as
they negotiated, said Tang.

PEACE — Religious Studies Prof. Robert McAfee Brown (left) and David Harris, former Vietnam draft resister and
ASSU president, spoke yesterday in White Plaza at a noon rally. Both speakers celebrated the end of the war.
Over 700 students at UC-Santa
Barbara yesterday afternoon rallied in
front of the administration building
protesting university budget policies
toward minority students as 25
hel meted policemen blocked the
building's doors.
Yet even as student leaders
picketed the building, university
officials were turning down the first of
the student demands — for a
sanctioned student moratorium of
classes Wednesday afternoon — while
postponing action on three others.
Organized by a coalition of
minority students, yesterday's protest
was the second in as many days at
Santa Barbara and the latest in a wave
of student demonstrations across the
country.
A similar budget furor at Brandeis
University ended Sunday when 35
students left buildings they had
occupied for five days. Their demands
for major increases in scholarships,
faculty and administrative staffing at
the Waltham, Mass. campus were
turned down by university officials
after a weekend of talks.
More Demonstrations Predicted
Meanwhile, in Santa Barbara,
tension had been mounting during the

past week over administration
decisions to phase out certain parts of
the black and chicano studies
programs.
Yesterday's demonstration, though
protesting the termination of the
minority programs, was also fueled in
part by student reaction to an aborted
protest of the night before, according
to Jim Tang, a staff writer on the
UCSB Daily Nexus.
Until student demands are
successfully met, Tang said he
predicted many more demonstrations
— "probably" one today and
"definitely" one tomorrow.
Twenty-three students were
arrested early yesterday morning by
flak jacketed policemen and sheriff's
deputies some four hours after they
seized the university's $14 million
computer center.
Spotlight Minorities
Entering the center shortly after 9
p.m. Sunday, students bolted the
computer center gate with bike locks
and chains. It took police nearly half
an hour to break down the barrier
with heavy bolt cutters.
Though asserting that "if we go, the
machines go." protestors did not
damage the computer and offered
little resistance as they were led to

police vans. A spokesman for the
coalition said that the takeover was
done to spotlight minority problems,
not to damage the computer system.
Nevertheless, students involved in
the actual sit-in as well as three
protestors outside, were arrested on
charges ranging from trespassing and
disturbing the peace, to failure to
disburse and resisting arrest.
Demands yesterday stressed
amnesty for those students arrested in
the takeover, as well as increased
funding and the appointment of
full-time directors for both the black
and chicano study centers. None of
the demands were acted upon.
Administrators maintained a "you
guys blew it last night" attitude as
they negotiated, said Tang.
