# Can Capitalism Deal With Scarcity?
## 
### 
Anyone who asserts that scarcity is the
fundamental economic question should
investigate the implications of such a
statement. Prof. George L. Bach states
(Daily, April 25) that since resources are
scarce, not everyone can have all that he
wants and we therefore need a free market
to decide what got produced, how. and for
whom.
I would like to ask Bach, i£ in light of the
following, he can say that capitalism is the
most efficient, equitable and rational system
to deal with scarcity-related problems:
The United States, with its powerful
economic, political and military apparatus,
has been instrumental in making scarcity an
extremely real phenomenon for large
numbers of people around the world.
We have supported, if not helped to
install, governments that welcomed our
capital and assured us cheap labor and
resources - all at the expense of
governments that wanted to nationalize their
own resources, institute land reform and
bring education and control of their own
destinies to the people.
Bach says that somebody has to decide
what gets produced. Our free market
decentralizes these important decisions and
supposedly, therefore, disperses power.
Since the political process "doesn't do what

I want it to do," Bach puts his faith in the
market mechanism.
The important question here is: do we
want the right to have 50 brands of
cigarettes to choose from or do we want the
right to regular employment, a decent
standard of living and control over our own
lives? In our capitalist economy where 500,
and even 100, firms have an inordinate
amount of control, we find we have a system
that doesn't resemble a free market very
much.
We also find that we are experiencing the
logical results of a system of monopoly capital
which observes no law but that of profit —
this same law which Bach hails for its
properties of efficiency in production and
consumption.
Capitalist Recession
When big corporations cannot tolerate a
drop of a few percentage points on the
profit charts, we get the massive layoffs and
firings and further tax breaks to
corporations that are now occurring. In
other words, the profit motive is efficient —
in assuring job insecurity, causing cyclical
recessions and requiring the irrational and
wasteful use of human and natural resources.
The lack of rationality and humanity of
such a system is again made obvious when
we realize that although there is much

Terry Bright
hunger and poverty in our own country, milk
is poured down drains, calves are
slaughtered, grain is allowed to rot and
farmers are paid for not growing crops.
Limited Competition
The profit motive drives firms to restrict
supply and raise prices, spend millions on
advertising to create needs for new cars
every three years, strive to depress wage
increases, manipulate Congress, control
foreign governments and buy out or limit
competition wherever possible.
Another achievement of capitalism,
according to Bach, is its elimination of
"back-breaking labor." First. I'd like to ask
Bach when the last time was that he talked
to a farmworker, a coal miner or a
ditch-digger. And then I will acknowledge
that, whereas great technological advances
have been made, I believe that the fruits
should be shared by all.
Particularly when Bach himself admits of
no faith in the political process, I find his
equating of political democracy with the
free market to be untenable. If anything,our
"free market" makes political democracy
less possible and economic democracy
impossible — for ourselves and others.

I want it to do," Bach puts his faith in the
market mechanism.
The important question here is: do we
want the right to have 50 brands of
cigarettes to choose from or do we want the
right to regular employment, a decent
standard of living and control over our own
lives? In our capitalist economy where 500,
and even 100, firms have an inordinate
amount of control, we find we have a system
that doesn't resemble a free market very
much.
We also find that we are experiencing the
logical results of a system of monopoly capital
which observes no law but that of profit —
this same law which Bach hails for its
properties of efficiency in production and
consumption.
Capitalist Recession
When big corporations cannot tolerate a
drop of a few percentage points on the
profit charts, we get the massive layoffs and
firings and further tax breaks to
corporations that are now occurring. In
other words, the profit motive is efficient —
in assuring job insecurity, causing cyclical
recessions and requiring the irrational and
wasteful use of human and natural resources.
The lack of rationality and humanity of
such a system is again made obvious when
we realize that although there is much

hunger and poverty in our own country, milk
is poured down drains, calves are
slaughtered, grain is allowed to rot and
farmers are paid for not growing crops.
Limited Competition
The profit motive drives firms to restrict
supply and raise prices, spend millions on
advertising to create needs for new cars
every three years, strive to depress wage
increases, manipulate Congress, control
foreign governments and buy out or limit
competition wherever possible.
Another achievement of capitalism,
according to Bach, is its elimination of
"back-breaking labor." First. I'd like to ask
Bach when the last time was that he talked
to a farmworker, a coal miner or a
ditch-digger. And then I will acknowledge
that, whereas great technological advances
have been made, I believe that the fruits
should be shared by all.
Particularly when Bach himself admits of
no faith in the political process, I find his
equating of political democracy with the
free market to be untenable. If anything,our
"free market" makes political democracy
less possible and economic democracy
impossible — for ourselves and others.

economics.)
Anyone who asserts that scarcity is the
fundamental economic question should
investigate the implications of such a
statement. Prof. George L. Bach states
(Daily, April 25) that since resources are
scarce, not everyone can have all that he
wants and we therefore need a free market
to decide what got produced, how. and for
whom.
I would like to ask Bach, i£ in light of the
following, he can say that capitalism is the
most efficient, equitable and rational system
to deal with scarcity-related problems:
The United States, with its powerful
economic, political and military apparatus,
has been instrumental in making scarcity an
extremely real phenomenon for large
numbers of people around the world.
We have supported, if not helped to
install, governments that welcomed our
capital and assured us cheap labor and
resources - all at the expense of
governments that wanted to nationalize their
own resources, institute land reform and
bring education and control of their own
destinies to the people.
Bach says that somebody has to decide
what gets produced. Our free market
decentralizes these important decisions and
supposedly, therefore, disperses power.
Since the political process "doesn't do what

I want it to do," Bach puts his faith in the
market mechanism.
