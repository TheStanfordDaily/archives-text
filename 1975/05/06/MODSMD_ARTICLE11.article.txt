Sorry About That . . .
Editor:
As one of the students on the
commencement speaker
selection committee, I want to
apologize for my neglect in not
seeking the minority view on a
large scale during the selection
process. I realize that the
selection of Daniel Patrick
Moynihan has greatly offended
members of" the Stanford
community, and for that I am
deeply sorry.
The selection process had no
minority viewpoint
incorporated into it, and in the
future years it would be most
beneficial to include minority
views, by faculty or by senior
minority leaders.
However, since Moynihan has
been selected, we are trying to
educate the Stanford
community about his work and
experiences. The senior class
officers support the idea of the
African and Afro-American
Studies program —"Moynihan:
Three Perspectives." Asst.
Sociology Prof. Michael Hannan
will speak about "Moynihan and
the Black Family";
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair
Drake, "Moynihan and the Third
World"; and Sociology Prof. W.
Richard Scott, "Moynihan and
Maximum feasible
Misunderstanding." We hope this
program will help to explain and
to clarify many of the
controversial issues surrounding
Moynihan and to give people an
opportunity to evaluate and to
discuss his work.

Editor:
I am honored to have been
placed on the ever-growing list
of people misquoted by the
Daily. But I must correct the
heinous wrong of your April 29
article where you reported that I
"criticized Fitzgerald for
allowing the election [senior
class | to become too 'political.' "
First, 1 never mentioned Tom
Fitzgerald throughout the entire
course of the interview. Second,
it would be absurd to try to
place the blame for such a fiasco
on Fitzgerald. Third, if 1 was to
say anything about Tom, it
would be this: He made every
effort, in my estimation, to do a
good job and make the correct
decisions. I admire him for the
job he did and certainly do not
envy his position.
You asked in an editorial why
people voted against the Daily.
May I suggest a possible starting
point of self-examination: Look
at the biased reporting the Daily
has become infamous for and
the disgracefully lengthy list of
misquotes which constantly
appear in the articles. That
would be a big step in the right
direction.

You asked in an editorial why
people voted against the Daily.
May I suggest a possible starting
point of self-examination: Look
at the biased reporting the Daily
has become infamous for and
the disgracefully lengthy list of
misquotes which constantly
appear in the articles. That
would be a big step in the right
direction.

Sorry About That . . .
Editor:
As one of the students on the
commencement speaker
selection committee, I want to
apologize for my neglect in not
seeking the minority view on a
large scale during the selection
process. I realize that the
selection of Daniel Patrick
Moynihan has greatly offended
members of" the Stanford
community, and for that I am
deeply sorry.
The selection process had no
minority viewpoint
incorporated into it, and in the
future years it would be most
beneficial to include minority
views, by faculty or by senior
minority leaders.
However, since Moynihan has
been selected, we are trying to
educate the Stanford
community about his work and
experiences. The senior class
officers support the idea of the
African and Afro-American
Studies program —"Moynihan:
Three Perspectives." Asst.
Sociology Prof. Michael Hannan
will speak about "Moynihan and
the Black Family";
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair
Drake, "Moynihan and the Third
World"; and Sociology Prof. W.
Richard Scott, "Moynihan and
Maximum feasible
Misunderstanding." We hope this
program will help to explain and
to clarify many of the
controversial issues surrounding
Moynihan and to give people an
opportunity to evaluate and to
discuss his work.

More Misquotes
Editor:
I am honored to have been
placed on the ever-growing list
of people misquoted by the
Daily. But I must correct the
heinous wrong of your April 29
article where you reported that I
"criticized Fitzgerald for
allowing the election [senior
class | to become too 'political.' "
First, 1 never mentioned Tom
Fitzgerald throughout the entire
course of the interview. Second,
it would be absurd to try to
place the blame for such a fiasco
on Fitzgerald. Third, if 1 was to
say anything about Tom, it
would be this: He made every
effort, in my estimation, to do a
good job and make the correct
decisions. I admire him for the
job he did and certainly do not
envy his position.
