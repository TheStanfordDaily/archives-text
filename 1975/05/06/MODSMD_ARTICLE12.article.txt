# University Encourages 'Benign Neglect'
## 
### 
Hsu, SASCC

The Stanford Asian Students
Coordinating Committee
(SASCC) joins members of the
black community, the
Anthropology Department, and
other concerned Stanford staff,
faculty and students in
protesting the designation of
Daniel Patrick Moynihan as the

main speaker for the 1975
commencement ceremonies.
Moynihan's selection is the
latest episode in this
administration's callous regard
for the ethnics of color. The
action is not only an insult to
the sensibilities of ethnic parents
and students, but an exercise in

abuse on the part of the
University's public relations
machine.
The fact that this University
proclaims its dedication to the
principles of academic freedom
and excellence while it selects a
speaker whose scholarship and
reputation is based upon
politically motivated,
pseudo-social science constitutes
manifest hypocrisy.
The use of the
commencement speech as a
vehicle for Moynihan's views is
equally pernicious in that the
University has taken deliberate
advantage of this particular
forum. Hence, Moynihan and his
views derive unwarranted honor
and legitimacy.
Moynihan's published works
have attempted to locate
America's racial problems with
the people of color while
eschewing any analysis of racism
as endemic to American society.
Moynihan's ideas appear to
coincide nicely with various
administrators' contentions that
the source of Stanford's own
racial problems lie with its
minority students.
Stanford Asian Americans
know only too well the meaning
of "benign neglect." Stanford
does not recognize Asian
Americans as a minority. We are
systematically ignored in areas
such as counseling, minority
financial aids and admissions
consideration.
Also implicit in the
University's actions is the
spurious assumption that Asian
Americans are a problem-free
and well-adjusted minority.
There cannot exist such a

problem-free and well-adjusted
minority as long as the
University persists in its
assimilationist rhetoric.
We regard the Moynihan
invitation as an indication of
Stanford's waning commitment
to all ethnics of color.
SASCC supports and urges
concerned members of the
Stanford community to boycott
the commencement exercises at

which Moynihan will speak. It is
hoped that future selection
committees will reflect the
multi-racial and multi-ethnic
composition of its faculty and
students.

SASCC supports and urges
concerned members of the
Stanford community to boycott
the commencement exercises at

which Moynihan will speak. It is
hoped that future selection
committees will reflect the
multi-racial and multi-ethnic
composition of its faculty and
students.

The Stanford Asian Students
Coordinating Committee
(SASCC) joins members of the
black community, the
Anthropology Department, and
other concerned Stanford staff,
faculty and students in
protesting the designation of
Daniel Patrick Moynihan as the

main speaker for the 1975
commencement ceremonies.
Moynihan's selection is the
latest episode in this
administration's callous regard
for the ethnics of color. The
action is not only an insult to
the sensibilities of ethnic parents
and students, but an exercise in

abuse on the part of the
University's public relations
machine.
The fact that this University
proclaims its dedication to the
principles of academic freedom
and excellence while it selects a
speaker whose scholarship and
reputation is based upon
politically motivated,
pseudo-social science constitutes
manifest hypocrisy.
The use of the
commencement speech as a
vehicle for Moynihan's views is
equally pernicious in that the
University has taken deliberate
advantage of this particular
forum. Hence, Moynihan and his
views derive unwarranted honor
and legitimacy.
Moynihan's published works
have attempted to locate
America's racial problems with
the people of color while
eschewing any analysis of racism
as endemic to American society.
Moynihan's ideas appear to
coincide nicely with various
administrators' contentions that
the source of Stanford's own
racial problems lie with its
minority students.
Stanford Asian Americans
know only too well the meaning
of "benign neglect." Stanford
does not recognize Asian
Americans as a minority. We are
systematically ignored in areas
such as counseling, minority
financial aids and admissions
consideration.
Also implicit in the
University's actions is the
spurious assumption that Asian
Americans are a problem-free
and well-adjusted minority.
There cannot exist such a

problem-free and well-adjusted
minority as long as the
University persists in its
assimilationist rhetoric.
We regard the Moynihan
invitation as an indication of
Stanford's waning commitment
to all ethnics of color.
SASCC supports and urges
concerned members of the
Stanford community to boycott
the commencement exercises at

which Moynihan will speak. It is
hoped that future selection
committees will reflect the
multi-racial and multi-ethnic
composition of its faculty and
students.
