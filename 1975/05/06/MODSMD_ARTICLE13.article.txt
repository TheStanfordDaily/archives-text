I'ruy tell, exactly what are Ihe rules regarding
lee ping in trailers/campers/tents/sleeping bags on
umpus? Why were these rules implemented?
Where might I Hue in my trailer and not be
hassled? It seems that the crime is not to have a
trailer here but to sleep in it. Is that true?—L P.
University policy is to forbid camping of any
kind, according to Marvin Herrington, director of
police services. "We can't allow camping as a
general practice or we'd have everybody stopping
in here to use this as a campground," he said,
noting that there are no camping facilities on
campus.
However, Herrington admitted that the police
will not generally bother students sleeping outside
on a hot night. And authorized groups — like the
Boy Scouts — can obtain permission to camp out
for a weekend.
Herrington said that it's true that students
with camping trailers may park and store them on
campus, but can't live in them. He suggested that
you go to a public trailer park.

Why arc the gumdrops in the candy machine only
one-and-one-half ounces when the ones advertised
on the front of the machine are two ounces? Is
this false advertising?—S.M.

"That's a good question," said Marv Krueger,
route supervisor for Canteen Corporation. "I
guess the candy company made a change that we
weren't aware of."
Our astute sources in the law school said that
it probably is false advertising, but recommended
no specific legal action. And Krueger didn't sound
particularly wc ried about the possibility.

Why do Xerox machines at the Stanford libraries
and elsewhere on campus cost five cents and six
cents per copy, when off-campus commercial
copy centers charge three cents and four cents
and still make a profit? Stanford is a large
customer of Xerox; can't the University get a
more favorable rate than a small commercial
establishment, particularly when overhead for
space, etc. is less? Who is getting ripped off—the
University or the users?—A.S.
Frankly, we couldn't find those cut-rate copy
centers to which you are referring. A brief survey
of ten copy services near campus showed that
most charged about 15 cents more than the
University to Xerox 100 copies of a standard
sheet And one charged almost twice as much.
The only cheaper place we found was Campus
Copy in Menlo Park. There you can get 100
copies for $4.18; Stanford's rate is $4.30.
