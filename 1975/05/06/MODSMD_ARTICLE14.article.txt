# Absorb The Shock Of Repairs
## ‘How Do I Save On Auto Expenses? 
### JIM ALEVERAS 
If you have a car, you know how
operating expenses are skyrocketing.
Maybe you've read about ways to get
better gas mileage, but that hasn't helped
much. Another strategy is to cut down
the amount you pay in maintenance and
repairs.
Labor Costs
One step in reducing repair bills is to
pay attention to where you have work
done. This refers more to what sort of
city than what sort of shop. For example,
the hourly labor rate at some major Palo
Alto area new car dealers runs about $24
to $27. A nearby gas station charges $18
per hour.
In contrast, suburban San Diego new
car dealers have a labor rate as low as $12
per hour. The difference is largely due to
extensive union membership among Bay
Area new car dealer mechanics, according
to local service personnel.
The moral is that if you drive home to
a city outside the Bay Area, check the
local labor rates. If they're favorable, try
to have your labor-intensive work (like
tune ups, overhauls, and body repair)
done there. A clutch adjustment that
costs $13 at a Menlo Park Chevrolet
dealer runs under $6 at a La Mesa
Chevrolet dealer.
Shopping Around
Tires, mufflers, brake linings and
shock absorbers are major routine
replacement items. A survey conducted
by this writer last summer in southern
California indicated that prices on these

items can vary considerably, and that
shopping around does pay off.
Generally, these parts are most
expensive at gas stations, and least
expensive at major chain discount stores
with automotive service departments.
There aren't any of the latter near
Stanford, but comparative shopping is
still useful. Check national outlets like
Sears and J.C.Penney to get ballpark ideas
of product quality and price; then try to
find a better deal.
Tires
Tire chain stores often run ads in
sports pages of local newspapers with
reduced prices on a certain tire or on a
particular item like a brake reline. If
that's just what you need, look into it.
Be advised, however, not to have
non-advertised work done or equipment
installed while you're there. Often, that's
how these stores make their money.
Thus, if you have some spare time, a few
phone calls and a little legwork can
translate into savings of up to 40 percent,
particularly on tires and wheel alignment.
A Few Tips
A great deal of money is wasted on
unnecessary repairs. Here are some
pitfalls to avoid:
—Often major work is performed (such
as valve jobs) when a minor adjustment
could suffice. This is why it's important
to get several diagnoses and estimates
where large repairs are involved. Better
yet is to get to know someone who's

familiar with cars. We enjoy giving free
advice.
—While regular tune-ups are important
to good fuel economy, having the car
tuned more often than recommended in
the owner's manual will cost more than
realized gas savings.
Shock Absorbers
—If you think ( or have been told) that
you need new shock absorbers, push up
and down on a fender so that the car
bounces. If it stops rocking within one
bounce after you let go, your shocks are
fine. If the car keeps bouncing, it's time
for replacement.
—If it's possible, try to stay with your
car when it's being serviced. For example,
even if you're not an expert, it's less
likely that you will be told falsely that
you need new brake linings if you're on
hand to inspect for yourself.
—Re read your owner's manual. It
contains many useful and often unheeded
suggestions. Also, in the manuals of many
small cars, instructions are given for
do-it-yourself maintenance.
The Gas Station
The gas station you choose is
important. You can save 10 to 15 percent
of your fuel bill by purchasing gas at an
independent, self-service station.
Checking the tire pressure yourself every
two weeks can greatly extend tire life.
By checking your own oil, battery,
and coolant, you know the job will get
done, and you'll have an opportunity to
better acquaint yourself with your car.

familiar with cars. We enjoy giving free
advice.
—While regular tune-ups are important
to good fuel economy, having the car
tuned more often than recommended in
the owner's manual will cost more than
realized gas savings.
Shock Absorbers
—If you think ( or have been told) that
you need new shock absorbers, push up
and down on a fender so that the car
bounces. If it stops rocking within one
bounce after you let go, your shocks are
fine. If the car keeps bouncing, it's time
for replacement.
—If it's possible, try to stay with your
car when it's being serviced. For example,
even if you're not an expert, it's less
likely that you will be told falsely that
you need new brake linings if you're on
hand to inspect for yourself.
—Re read your owner's manual. It
contains many useful and often unheeded
suggestions. Also, in the manuals of many
small cars, instructions are given for
do-it-yourself maintenance.
The Gas Station
The gas station you choose is
important. You can save 10 to 15 percent
of your fuel bill by purchasing gas at an
independent, self-service station.
Checking the tire pressure yourself every
two weeks can greatly extend tire life.
By checking your own oil, battery,
and coolant, you know the job will get
done, and you'll have an opportunity to
better acquaint yourself with your car.
If you have a car, you know how
operating expenses are skyrocketing.
Maybe you've read about ways to get
better gas mileage, but that hasn't helped
much. Another strategy is to cut down
the amount you pay in maintenance and
repairs.
Labor Costs
One step in reducing repair bills is to
pay attention to where you have work
done. This refers more to what sort of
city than what sort of shop. For example,
the hourly labor rate at some major Palo
Alto area new car dealers runs about $24
to $27. A nearby gas station charges $18
per hour.
In contrast, suburban San Diego new
car dealers have a labor rate as low as $12
per hour. The difference is largely due to
extensive union membership among Bay
Area new car dealer mechanics, according
to local service personnel.
The moral is that if you drive home to
a city outside the Bay Area, check the
local labor rates. If they're favorable, try
to have your labor-intensive work (like
tune ups, overhauls, and body repair)
done there. A clutch adjustment that
costs $13 at a Menlo Park Chevrolet
dealer runs under $6 at a La Mesa
Chevrolet dealer.
Shopping Around
Tires, mufflers, brake linings and
shock absorbers are major routine
replacement items. A survey conducted
by this writer last summer in southern
California indicated that prices on these

items can vary considerably, and that
shopping around does pay off.
Generally, these parts are most
expensive at gas stations, and least
expensive at major chain discount stores
with automotive service departments.
There aren't any of the latter near
Stanford, but comparative shopping is
still useful. Check national outlets like
Sears and J.C.Penney to get ballpark ideas
of product quality and price; then try to
find a better deal.
Tires
Tire chain stores often run ads in
sports pages of local newspapers with
reduced prices on a certain tire or on a
particular item like a brake reline. If
that's just what you need, look into it.
Be advised, however, not to have
non-advertised work done or equipment
installed while you're there. Often, that's
how these stores make their money.
Thus, if you have some spare time, a few
phone calls and a little legwork can
translate into savings of up to 40 percent,
particularly on tires and wheel alignment.
A Few Tips
A great deal of money is wasted on
unnecessary repairs. Here are some
pitfalls to avoid:
—Often major work is performed (such
as valve jobs) when a minor adjustment
could suffice. This is why it's important
to get several diagnoses and estimates
where large repairs are involved. Better
yet is to get to know someone who's

familiar with cars. We enjoy giving free
advice.
—While regular tune-ups are important
to good fuel economy, having the car
tuned more often than recommended in
the owner's manual will cost more than
