# Vitamin C Controversy Continues
## 
### ANTHONY DELLING 
Despite the widespread use of
Vitamin C to prevent or alleviate
colds, such use has come under
increasing attack in the past year
by those who doubt whether the
vitamin has any significant
preventative or remedial effect
with regard to colds.
Since 1970, When Emeritus
Chemistry Prof. Linus Pauling
asserted that large daily doses of
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)
reduced frequency and severity
of colds, there has been some
debate among researchers and
physicians as to the vitamin's
efficacy in this regard. Recently,
however, this debate has
intensified considerably.
The American Medical
Association (AMA) in particular
has taken a skeptical attitude
towards claims about Vitamin C
by Pauling, a two-time Nobel
Prize winner. In a recent edition
of the AMA Journal, two articles
questioned the value of Vitamin
C in combatting the common
cold.
Dosages
One article examined a study
in which 311 subjects received
either three grams a day of
Vitamin C or three grams of a
placebo. When a subject showed
signs of coming down with a
cold, the dosages of Vitamin C
or the placebo were doubled.
Though the Journal conceded

that the study showed the
Vitamin C group to have colds
of shorter duration, it concluded
that this was due to a
psychological effect resulting
from some of the Vitamin C
subjects having tasted their
capsules and thus expecting to
have shorter colds.
Therefore, according to the
Journal, Vitamin C "had only a
minor influence on the duration
and severity of colds," and no
influence on the incidence of
colds.
The other Journal article
reviewed a number of Vitamin C
studies over the past 25 years.
The authors stated that little
evidence" existed to justify the
claim that Vitamin C is effective
in reducing the frequency or
virulence of colds.
Moreover. the review
suggested that large doses of
ascorbic acid may be medically
harmful, causing kidney stones
or temporary diarrhea.
In a letter to Time, Pauling,
responding to a Time article on
Vitamin C, blasted the AMA for
its "unjustified effort to
downgrade Vitamin C." He
asserted that, contrary to the
Journal articles. Vitamin C does
provide "significant protection
against colds for most people."
'Hypothetical'
When contacted by the Daily,
Pauling also said that the side

effects referred to in the second
AMA a rticle were
"hypothetical," and that "no
case of kidney stones has been
reported in people taking large
doses of Vitamin C."
Another publication, The
Medical Letter, also examined
several Vitamin C studies. One
of them, a Canadian study,
utilized over 2000 subjects,
some of whom took up to two
grams of ascorbic acid daily.
In this study, according to
The Medical Letter, "there were
no significant differences
between any of the groups
taking Vitamin C and those
taking placebos."

Another study of children in
an Arizona boarding school did
show 30 percent fewer colds
among Vitamin C groups, said
The Medical Letter. Nonetheless,
since other illnesses also
occurred 30 percent less often
among the Vitamin C groups, a
statistical analysis of the results
was done. The Medical Letter
claimed that this analysis
showed "no consistent effect
due to Vitamin C."
Pauling said that the results
of these studies "have been
misrepresented by
commentators." He maintained
that the Canadian study was of
questionable validity because of

irregularities in the control
groups which received the
placebo.
Furthermore, he added, an
earlier study by the same
researchers "found 30 percent
less illness [days lost from
school and work | among the
Vitamin C group."
In addition, Pauling claimed
that 12 studies have been done
to determine the value of
ascorbic acid in preventing or
treating colds and that "all 12
studies showed a smaller amount
of colds [up to 75 percent less]
in the groups taking Vitamin C
than in the control groups."
