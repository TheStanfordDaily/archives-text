" What's for breakfast ?"
"The usual. . . fried termites and smoked
caterpilhrs."
"Oh."
That might be the conversation at your
breakfast table if you take what Asst. Industrial
Engineering Prof. Douglas Daetz says to heart.
During a lecture here. Daetz observed that
insects could provide nutritious food for
Americans if people weren't so fussy.
He said that smoked caterpillars have six times
the protein of eggs per ounce and that fried
termites have three times the protein of eggs.
However, the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association has voiced reservations about Daetz's
comments.
In its current newsletter, the association says,
"We would only hope that if this kind of project

| insect production for food purposes | ever
received serious consideration, a carefully studied
environmental impact statement would be
prepared.
"Would the termite harvest be done by strip
mining techniques? How about experimental
permits? And would your neighbor's backyard
termite garden be a threat to your picket fence?"
the letter says.
Daetz said he is amused by the reaction to his
statement. "Because I threw in that information
in this talk, (people have| .. . just gone wild. I
got a request in the mail from a publishing
company, asking me if I wanted'to write a book."
Even though he said he thinks Americans may
end up eating bugs, Daetz has yet to indulge in a
gourmet meal of them himself. "I'm trying to get
brave enough to eat a smoked caterpillar," he said
