## The
						Blues Moves On Dixon Visits Sophie's; Wolf Dies 
### DAN FORTE 
Little Red Rooster,
"Spoonful," "Hoochie Coochie
Man," "I Can't Quit You,
Baby," "The Seventh Son," "My
Babe," "Back Door Man."
It seems impossible that one
bluesman could have written all
these blues standards and many
others. Pick up any blues record
and it's likely that the name
Willie Dixon will appear under
one or more of the song titles.
Dixon's tunes are constantly
being revived by blues and rock
groups alike — with recent hits
of "Wang Dang Doodle" by the
Pointer Sisters, and "Insane
Asylum" by Kathi McDonald.
All the while, Dixon continues
to pen more and more tunes,
many of which will doubtless
become future standards.
Dixon has been in the blues
business from every angle since
1950 when he signed with Chess
records. He has worked as
composer, featured artist,
session bassist, promoter, talent
scout. For the past several years
he's been touring with his
Chicago Blues All-Stars, a
compilation of some of the most
able blues musicians alive today.
Band To Sophie's
The tour brought the band to
Sophie's, on California St.,
Wednesday, April 23 where they
were met by a large crowd. "It's
been my idea for a long time,
see, to expose people to the
blues. Because a lot of people
say 'blues' and they really don't
know what the blues are."
With all the notoriety and
royalties his compositions have
brought him, the main reason
Dixon, now in his 50s, still
tours actively is to represent the
blues, and educate people about
the idiom.
"People have always tried to
consider blues a low class
music," he says. "They try to
pick out all the bad things and
say, 'this is the blues.'Most of the
time, people fail to remember
what the blues was made for,
and how they was made, and
why they was made.
Slaves Made
"Slaves made it in order to
consume time and to consolate
their minds; and they also used
it to deliver messages. And in
delivering messages, well, that's
what they're doin' today. But,
naturally, it wouldn't be a
message of the past, but a
message of the present and the
future.
"Years ago when people was
doin' that farm work, they'd be

singin' farm songs, about the
mules or whatever they were
involved in. But, today you're
involved in a different thing; this
is why the modern blues came as
time went by."
Dixon is very concerned
about the future of his music,
but at the same time he is
confident that "the blues'll
grow, because more people are
understanding what the blues
mean. At one time I remember
when they used to call, like now,
they'll call one music jazz, and
one music blues; but they're all
basically blues. Because the
original tones and qualities and
changes in the music are
basically the blues."
On his upcoming Ovation LP,
Dixon has a song entitled "What
Happened To My Blues?" which
follows the continual branching
out of what began with blues.
"It tells where 'they took the
old blues and they added a little
beat, and they called it boogie
woogie all up and down the
street.' After then, 'they added a
little sock, and then they begin
to call my blues some kind of
rock.'
"Then, 'they say they added
class when they called my blues
some kind of modern jazz.' But,
it tells the various ways of
relating and changing blues.
Blues is gonna be around a long
time, 'cos there's more people
with them."
White Audience
With the obvious reference to
blues's largely white audience,
Dixon was quick to disagree
with the view, held by 8.8. King
amongst others, that there has
been an irreparable split between
blues and young blacks.
"There's no way out of it,"
according to Dixon, "because
he's the creator — his
foreparents created the blues.
It's utterly impossible for him to
lose it; it's just like a tiger trying
to lose his stripes. If a tiger can
lose his stripes, then a black man
can lose the blues."
Dixon's All-Stars are one of
the traveling-est bands in the
business, covering the U.S.,
Canada, and Europe several
times over. The current
personnel includes: Carey Bell
(harmonica), Lafayette Leake
(piano), Buster Benton (guitar),
and Clifton James (drums), with
Willie Dixon and his song
swapping chores on bass.

Only a month after the
untimely death of blues guitarist
T-Bone Walker comes the

saddest news in years for blues
fans. Chester A. Burnett, better
known as the Howlin' Wolf, is
dead at the age of 64, after
several years of kidney trouble.
If Howlin' Wolf wasn't the
greatest blues singer ever, he was
quite possibly the most
powerful. The 6-foot-5,
270-pounder would make his
stage entrance on all fours,
howling and screaming an
appropriate tune such as
"Moanin' at Midnight" or
"Howlin' For My Darlin'."
Though he was one of Chess
Records's most popular artists,
Wolf was not recorded until
1951, at the age of 41. It was
Ike Turner who discovered Wolf,
and played piano on those early
recordings.
DJ/Singer
Prior to this time, Wolf had
worked as a DJ/singer on his
own radio show over KWEM,
West Memphis, Arkansas. Born
in Mississippi, June 10, 1910,
Wolf didn't develop an interest
in music until he reached 18,
and began learning guitar from
Charley Patton.
He later received his first
harmonica lessons when Sonny
Boy Williamson (Rice Miller)
married his step-sister. Playing in
Arkansas road-houses during the
early 1930s with Patton and Son
House, Wolf met the legendary
Robert Johnson. The two
formed a trio for a short time,
with Sonny Boy on harp.
But it was in Chicago, during
the early 19505, that Wolf came
to be the giant that blues fans
will always remember him as.
Although his harmonica and
guitar styles retained much of
his Memphis background, the
overall sound of Wolf's energetic
band — with the dazzling lead
guitar of Hubert Sumlin always
in the forefront — was Chicago
in every respect; tense, electric, a
bit harsh and rough, but
extremely emotional and
compelling.
Reissue
Chess has just recently
re-issued a collection of Wolf's
latter period material
(1956-1968) entitled Change My
Way (418). By far the best
overview of Wolf's hits, though,
are contained in the double-set

Chester Burnett A.K.A. Howlin'
Wolf (60016). "Smokestack
Lightnin'," "Spoonful," "Red
Rooster," "Evil Is Goin' On,"
"Killing Floor," "How Many
More Years," all are here.
Howlin' Wolf's passing will no
doubt go as unnoticed as did
T-Bone Walker's, rating only a
couple of paragraphs in a few
magazines and newspapers. But,
to those who knew him and his
music, Wolf was equivalent to a
Miles Davis, a Duke Ellington or
any other great American
musician.
In an interview a few years
back, Paul Williams of
Crawdaddy asked the man what
would happen if the blues lost
its audience altogether. "If there
weren't any more people
listening to the blues," Chester
A. Burnett replied, "there
wouldn't be no Wolf."
