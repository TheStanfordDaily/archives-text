# Two Young Dance Troupes At Berkeley
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
It's been a busy season for
dance in Berkeley.
Cunningham's and Falco's
companies had barely cleared
their props from the Zellerbach
stage, when in rolled yet another
troup; this time it was the
Pennsylvania Ballet. While U.C.
hosted this new group, around
the corner, in the smaller
Zellerbach Playhouse Theatre,
U.C.'s own University Dance
Theatre was performing.
The two groups have more in
common than one would expect.
Both the Pennsylvania Ballet and
the University Dance Theatre are
young repertory companies which
boast a few very good dancers
and a corps of not-so-good
dancers; both perform
contemporary as well as
traditional pieces within their
respective idioms.
And both are extra-pro
fessional — the U.D.T. because
the majority of its dancers are
young students not yet
acquainted with the world of
professional dance, and the
Pennsylvania Ballet because for
one reason or another most of
its dancers lack that special

something necessary for really

"big-time" performing.
Saturday evening's program
afforded a generous sampling of
the Pennsylvania Ballet's wares.
The program included a
Harkarvy homage to the
Renaissance, a lively Lar
Lubovitch ballet, a soporific
adagio by Hans Von Manen and
the by-now obligatory
Balanchine sign-off piece.
Individual Strengths
Given that Harkarvy is the
Pennsylvania Ballet's artistic
director, and reputedly a master
at illuminating individual
dancer's strengths, one would
have expected his Madrigalesco
to be the "ideal vehicle" for his
company's virtuosities. To a
certain extent it was — the
movements were intricate and at
times painstakingly complex, yet
the company handled them with
remarkable ease.
It was apparent that Harkarvy
is a very conscientious and
thorough choreographer, and
that when he constructs a ballet
based on Renaissance "attitudes
and sentiments" it is a studied
and thoughtful piece. The only
problem was that the dancing
never really caught fire.
Even within the staid

Renaissance context the
partnering was often
dispassionate and the unison
movements too static. All too
often choreographers, even good
ones like Harkarvy, fall prey to a
blatant mimicry when they seek
to relate the plastic arts and
dance.
Crazy Dance
Zig-Zag, Lubovitch's crazy
ballet for one man and six
women, provided the evening's
first apercus into the
Pennsylvania dancers as
individuals. Ludovitch is an
unusually gifted young
choreographer with a wonderful
sense of the humorous and
absurd.
In Zig-Zag we see a
vain, glorious young man
exhausting himself with virtuous
technical display before an
adoring audience of six women.
The women, though, casually
proceed to surpass his feats with
kinetic bravura of their own. It's
a fun piece and one that lets the
dancers show themselves off as
skilled dramatic soloists.
In the final two pieces, Von
Manen's Adagio Hammerclauier,
and Balanchine's Scotch
Symphony, the Pennsylvania
company demonstrated its
considerable technical skill, but
was devoid of the insouciance
and charisma it exhibited in
Zig-Zag.
No Exception
Just about every ballet
company performing in the U.S.
today includes at least one
Balanchine classic in its
repertoire, and the Pennsylvania
Ballet is no exception. The final
piece in Saturday's concert was
Scotch Symphony, Balanchine's
light version of the old
scotsman-sylph saga.
Here the Pennsylvania Ballet
corps was remarkably good,
and the principles revealed a
clear mastery of the teasing

Balanchine ploy of never
finishing a phrase exactly in the
way we expect.
Although the U.D.T. doesn't
have any choreographers on a
par with Balanchine, it does"
manage to present an engaging
and enjoyable evening of
concert-quality dance. This
season it premiered several
new works choreographed by
Marni Wood, Anna Mittleholzer
and David Wood, the head of
U.C.'s dance program.
Graham Line . -
Although both Woods are
descendants from the Martha
Graham tradition of
choreography, their dances,
especially David Wood's more
recent pieces, display a
distinctive appreciation of the
student-dancer's skills.
P re-Amble, originally
choreographed three years ago t
is a clever vision of the dancer's
side of a performance, including
the pre-performance warm-up ifl
a motley assortment of practice
clothes.
Passage, Wood's most recent
piece, was a less successful
sculpture-influenced work tffitt
fell short in the same way
Harkarvy's Madrigalesco did;
both pieces succumbed to the
urge to imitate, rather than
emulate, the work of art.
Simple
Synergy U , choreographed by
Carolyn Brown, the former
Cunningham dancer, was the
simplest and in some ways the
most successful dance on
U.D.T.'s Thursday program. The
dance included set and
spontaneously devised
movements combined in such a
way that neither looked rigid or
sloppy.
