## Author FitzGerald Attacks Shah Of Iran 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The Shah of Iran cannot integrate
his goals of progress and sophistication
with his policies of keeping the people
politically and intellectually
undeveloped, author Frances
FitzGerald said last night in a talk on
"The Roots of Repression in Iran."
Speaking to a capacity crowd in
Annenberg Auditorium, FitzGerald
said the Shah is using imported
technology and culture to create a
society which "looks modern ... but
is completely alienated from itself."
In spite of the exotic image of Iran
commonly portrayed in the press,
FitzGerald described Iran as a police
state "as close as I've ever seen to the
one in the Soviet Union.. . . The only
thing exotic about it is the torture
methods."
A winner of the National Book
Award for her description of Vietnam,
Fire in the Lake. FitzGerald compared
the U.S.-created regimes in Iran and
South Vietnam. She said that the
infusion of foreign money in both
countries narrowed the governments'
power bases instead of broadening
them.

"The notion was to create strong
governments ... to contain
communism," she said, "but instead of
creating bastions against what we're
supposed to be creating bastions
against, we've been creating very weak
governments."
FitzGerald accused the Central
Intelligence Agency of sponsoring the
1953 coups which brought the Shah to
power in Iran and Ngo Dinh Diem to
power in South Vietnam.
In each case, she said, the coup was
not "the really important thing,"
pointing instead to the massive
infusions of United States military aid
to Diem and the Shah following the
coups. By providing money for police
and armies, "we bought two people
entire governments," she said.
One of the differences about Iran,
she said, is the "double motive" for
U.S. involvement: strategic military
interests combined with access to raw
materials.
