# Symphony Highlights Composers

SAN FRANCISCO - The San
Francisco Symphony took a
different approach to its music
selection Wednesday night;
instead of featuring the usual
soloists, it highlighted the
early, middle and late period of
Saint-Saens, Ravel and Mahler
respectively.
The orchestra played the
American premiere of
Saint-Saens Symphony in A
Major, composed in 1851 when
he was just 15. He kept it "in
the closet" for many years, and
now it has been returned to the
concert circuit.
But it should have stayed in
the closet; its simple and easily
discernible themes are pleasant
enough but the piece lacks
depth, maturity and interest.
The orchestra played it
excellently, doing it justice.
In contrast, Ravel's Rapsodie
Espagnole, Pavane pour une
Infante Defunte, and Bolero, are
from the composer's middle
years. Ravel was always
fascinated with the rhythm and

melodies of Spanish music, and
the three pieces reflect that
infatuation.
The Rapsodie features
popular folkdance music; the
Pavane a thoughtful and
beautiful melody. On each, the
orchestra was excellent,
capturing the motion and
sensuousness that is
characteristic of Spanish music.
But the Bolero brought the
house to its feet. The Bolero is
musically the most absurd of the
three, and indeed, Ravel wrote it
as a challenging exercise. It
consists of one constant
crescendo, beginning pianissimo
with solo percussion and flute,
and repeating the melody over
and over by gradually adding
more instruments, sound and
excitement.
It ends in a huge, crashing
fortissimo, with everyone
playing as loud as he possibly
can. The orchestra gave it all
it had, and the audience loved
it. ,
Mahler's Adagio from
Symphony No. 10 in F Sharp

Minor, on the other hand, is the
antithesis of the other
lighthearted fare. Mahler never
finished the Symphony, and
barely finished the Adagio while
on his deathbed.
It is a romantic-modern
movement that lacks form and
predictability, but is full of
serious, introspective thematic
material.
The orchestra was very
sensitive to the inherent despair
and somber emotion of the
piece, performing with a lucidity
and strength that defines
Mahler's music.
