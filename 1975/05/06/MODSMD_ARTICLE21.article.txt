Fingerprints Identify SLA Members
SACRAMENTO — A witness told the Marcus Foster
murder trial jury yesterday how fingers were cut off to
identify the charred remains of six Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) members.
Vincent Yoder, senior fingerprint expert of the Los
Angeles Police Department, testified at the trial of SLA
members Russell Little and Joseph Remiro. They are
accused of murder in the Nov. 6, 1973 slaying of Foster,
superintendent of schools in Oakland.
Alameda County Dist. Atty. Lowell Jensen, said in an
interview that three of the six killed in the shootout with
police in Los Angeles Last May 17 would be connected by
fingerprints to materials found in the Concord residence
he has called an SLA "death house."
The prosecution contends that the assassination of
Foster, a nationally known black educator, was plotted at
the Concord house.
Yoder told the jury that the six bodies were "too badly
charred" for normal fingerprint examination so "we had
to remove fingers from the bodies."
Fingers were put in bottles before scalpels were used to
slice off the charred finger tips, revealing a printable layer
of skin.
"The fingers were placed in separate jars, then
mounted on pegs and photographed," Yoder said.
Jensen said that fingerprints would link Donald
"Cinque" DeFreeze, Nancy Ling Perry and Patricia
Soltysik, three of the slain SLA members, to materials at
the Concord residence.
Haldeman Lawsuit Dismissed
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A federal court jury yesterday
dismissed a $1 million lawsuit against former White House
aide H.R. Haldeman and others stemming from a
turbulent 1971 rally attended by former President
Richard Nixon.
The jury deliberated two hours before deciding the
constitutional rights of none of the 18 plaintiffs had been
violated.
George Daly, attorney for the plaintiffs, did not say
whether he would appeal.
The plaintiffs, most of them members of the local
antiwar Red Hornets May Day Tribe organization, had
filed suit against Haldeman and others alleging they were
illegally excluded from an Oct. 15, 1971, rally honoring
evangelist Billy Graham.
Earlier, U.S. District Court Judge James McMillan had
dismissed as defendants 11 Secret Service agents.
Remaining as defendants were Haldeman, White House
chief of staff under Nixon; three other former White
House staffers; two local members of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars (VFW) and three policemen.
McMillan also dismissed as defendants four other
Charlotte policemen and two other VFW members who
had served as marshals for the rally.
Saigon Warns Holdouts To Surrender
SAIGON — Warning that holdouts would be severely
punished, Saigon's new rulers have extended the deadline
to May 31 for members of the defeated South Vietnamese
armed forces to turn themselves in.
According to a Saigon radio broadcast monitored
yesterday in Bangkok, the new regime for the sixth
consecutive day ordered anyone holding military
equipment to turn it in immediately.
Some observers interpreted this as a sign of possible
delays in efforts to round up weapons, soldiers, policemen
and officials from the old regime. Others said it may mean
some former troops are in jungles or other isolated areas.
An order signed by Gen. Tran Van Tra, head of the
Saigon military committee, said anyone still hiding after
midnight May 31 would be severely punished, according
to the broadcast. Tra also said that all who have
"temporarily reported" must do so again. The previous
deadline had been Wednesday.
Another broadcast said the release of "political

prisoners" of the old Saigon regime was under way and
called on prisoners already freed and families of prisoners
to plan a welcoming ceremony for persons returning from
Con Son prison island.
The government of former President Nguyen Van
Thieu never acknowledged holding political prisoners, but
communists alleged there were tens of thousands.
Duong Van Minh, the neutralist retired general who
was president of South Vietnam for three days before last
week's surrender, also was at liberty, according to the Viet
Cong's Liberation radio, believed to emanate from Hanoi.
A broadcast said Minh, his premier, Vu Van Mau, and
14 other cabinet and legislative figures were released from
custody Friday in a meeting at the presidential palace,
asked to contribute to reconstruction and invited to a
Revolutionary Government reception.
Ford Wants $507 Million Refugee Aid
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration requested
an additional $507 million yesterday for the care and
relocation of South Vietnamese refugees but ran into
immediate resistance in Congress.
The director of Ford's refugee task force, Ambassador
L. Dean Brown, said the money is needed within a week
because of $98 million fund for postwar reconstruction of
Vietnam, now used to pay for the program, will be spent
by then.
Testifying before the House immigration
subcommittee, Brown said the refugees are now estimated
to number about 135,000.
He believes the country's attitude is changing toward
welcome for the refugees, Brown said, and even if the
number of refugees reached 150,000, only about 30,000
would seek jobs.
He said the U.S. is urging other countries to take
refugees, adding that, if there are no widespread killings in
South Vietnam, "I believe we would see a large outflow
back. This is their homeland."
"I'm under no illusion this will come quickly," he said.
Subcommittee members complained there were no
specific figures on how many refugees there will be, how
many can pay their own way or what will happen to
South Vietnamese who profiteered or tortured people
during the war.
Rep. Joshua Eilberg (D-Pa.), subcommittee chairman,
said the subcommittee may act within a week but
predicted it will not approve the full $507 million request.

An order signed by Gen. Tran Van Tra, head of the
Saigon military committee, said anyone still hiding after
midnight May 31 would be severely punished, according
to the broadcast. Tra also said that all who have
"temporarily reported" must do so again. The previous
deadline had been Wednesday.
Another broadcast said the release of "political

prisoners" of the old Saigon regime was under way and
called on prisoners already freed and families of prisoners
to plan a welcoming ceremony for persons returning from
Con Son prison island.
The government of former President Nguyen Van
Thieu never acknowledged holding political prisoners, but
communists alleged there were tens of thousands.
Duong Van Minh, the neutralist retired general who
was president of South Vietnam for three days before last
week's surrender, also was at liberty, according to the Viet
Cong's Liberation radio, believed to emanate from Hanoi.
A broadcast said Minh, his premier, Vu Van Mau, and
14 other cabinet and legislative figures were released from
custody Friday in a meeting at the presidential palace,
asked to contribute to reconstruction and invited to a
Revolutionary Government reception.
Ford Wants $507 Million Refugee Aid
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration requested
an additional $507 million yesterday for the care and
relocation of South Vietnamese refugees but ran into
immediate resistance in Congress.
The director of Ford's refugee task force, Ambassador
L. Dean Brown, said the money is needed within a week
because of $98 million fund for postwar reconstruction of
Vietnam, now used to pay for the program, will be spent
by then.
Testifying before the House immigration
subcommittee, Brown said the refugees are now estimated
to number about 135,000.
He believes the country's attitude is changing toward
welcome for the refugees, Brown said, and even if the
number of refugees reached 150,000, only about 30,000
would seek jobs.
He said the U.S. is urging other countries to take
refugees, adding that, if there are no widespread killings in
South Vietnam, "I believe we would see a large outflow
back. This is their homeland."
"I'm under no illusion this will come quickly," he said.
Subcommittee members complained there were no
specific figures on how many refugees there will be, how
many can pay their own way or what will happen to
South Vietnamese who profiteered or tortured people
during the war.
Rep. Joshua Eilberg (D-Pa.), subcommittee chairman,
said the subcommittee may act within a week but
predicted it will not approve the full $507 million request.
Today's Weather
Fair through today but with patchy low clouds late
night and early morning. Slightly warmer days. Lows
tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 60s
to low 70s. Northwest winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons
and evenings.
Fingerprints Identify SLA Members
SACRAMENTO — A witness told the Marcus Foster
murder trial jury yesterday how fingers were cut off to
identify the charred remains of six Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) members.
Vincent Yoder, senior fingerprint expert of the Los
Angeles Police Department, testified at the trial of SLA
members Russell Little and Joseph Remiro. They are
accused of murder in the Nov. 6, 1973 slaying of Foster,
superintendent of schools in Oakland.
Alameda County Dist. Atty. Lowell Jensen, said in an
interview that three of the six killed in the shootout with
police in Los Angeles Last May 17 would be connected by
fingerprints to materials found in the Concord residence
he has called an SLA "death house."
The prosecution contends that the assassination of
Foster, a nationally known black educator, was plotted at
the Concord house.
Yoder told the jury that the six bodies were "too badly
charred" for normal fingerprint examination so "we had
to remove fingers from the bodies."
Fingers were put in bottles before scalpels were used to
slice off the charred finger tips, revealing a printable layer
of skin.
"The fingers were placed in separate jars, then
mounted on pegs and photographed," Yoder said.
Jensen said that fingerprints would link Donald
"Cinque" DeFreeze, Nancy Ling Perry and Patricia
Soltysik, three of the slain SLA members, to materials at
the Concord residence.
Haldeman Lawsuit Dismissed
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A federal court jury yesterday
dismissed a $1 million lawsuit against former White House
aide H.R. Haldeman and others stemming from a
turbulent 1971 rally attended by former President
Richard Nixon.
The jury deliberated two hours before deciding the
constitutional rights of none of the 18 plaintiffs had been
violated.
George Daly, attorney for the plaintiffs, did not say
whether he would appeal.
The plaintiffs, most of them members of the local
antiwar Red Hornets May Day Tribe organization, had
filed suit against Haldeman and others alleging they were
illegally excluded from an Oct. 15, 1971, rally honoring
evangelist Billy Graham.
Earlier, U.S. District Court Judge James McMillan had
dismissed as defendants 11 Secret Service agents.
Remaining as defendants were Haldeman, White House
chief of staff under Nixon; three other former White
House staffers; two local members of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars (VFW) and three policemen.
McMillan also dismissed as defendants four other
Charlotte policemen and two other VFW members who
had served as marshals for the rally.
Saigon Warns Holdouts To Surrender
SAIGON — Warning that holdouts would be severely
punished, Saigon's new rulers have extended the deadline
to May 31 for members of the defeated South Vietnamese
armed forces to turn themselves in.
According to a Saigon radio broadcast monitored
yesterday in Bangkok, the new regime for the sixth
consecutive day ordered anyone holding military
equipment to turn it in immediately.
Some observers interpreted this as a sign of possible
delays in efforts to round up weapons, soldiers, policemen
and officials from the old regime. Others said it may mean
some former troops are in jungles or other isolated areas.
An order signed by Gen. Tran Van Tra, head of the
Saigon military committee, said anyone still hiding after

Vincent Yoder, senior fingerprint expert of the Los
Angeles Police Department, testified at the trial of SLA
members Russell Little and Joseph Remiro. They are
accused of murder in the Nov. 6, 1973 slaying of Foster,
superintendent of schools in Oakland.
Alameda County Dist. Atty. Lowell Jensen, said in an
interview that three of the six killed in the shootout with
police in Los Angeles Last May 17 would be connected by
fingerprints to materials found in the Concord residence
he has called an SLA "death house."
The prosecution contends that the assassination of
Foster, a nationally known black educator, was plotted at
the Concord house.
Yoder told the jury that the six bodies were "too badly
charred" for normal fingerprint examination so "we had
to remove fingers from the bodies."
Fingers were put in bottles before scalpels were used to
slice off the charred finger tips, revealing a printable layer
of skin.
"The fingers were placed in separate jars, then
mounted on pegs and photographed," Yoder said.
Jensen said that fingerprints would link Donald
"Cinque" DeFreeze, Nancy Ling Perry and Patricia
Soltysik, three of the slain SLA members, to materials at
the Concord residence.
Haldeman Lawsuit Dismissed
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A federal court jury yesterday
dismissed a $1 million lawsuit against former White House
aide H.R. Haldeman and others stemming from a
turbulent 1971 rally attended by former President
Richard Nixon.
The jury deliberated two hours before deciding the
constitutional rights of none of the 18 plaintiffs had been
violated.
George Daly, attorney for the plaintiffs, did not say
whether he would appeal.
The plaintiffs, most of them members of the local
antiwar Red Hornets May Day Tribe organization, had
filed suit against Haldeman and others alleging they were
illegally excluded from an Oct. 15, 1971, rally honoring
evangelist Billy Graham.
Earlier, U.S. District Court Judge James McMillan had
dismissed as defendants 11 Secret Service agents.
Remaining as defendants were Haldeman, White House
chief of staff under Nixon; three other former White
House staffers; two local members of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars (VFW) and three policemen.
McMillan also dismissed as defendants four other
Charlotte policemen and two other VFW members who
had served as marshals for the rally.
Saigon Warns Holdouts To Surrender
SAIGON — Warning that holdouts would be severely
punished, Saigon's new rulers have extended the deadline
to May 31 for members of the defeated South Vietnamese
armed forces to turn themselves in.
According to a Saigon radio broadcast monitored
yesterday in Bangkok, the new regime for the sixth
consecutive day ordered anyone holding military
equipment to turn it in immediately.
Some observers interpreted this as a sign of possible
delays in efforts to round up weapons, soldiers, policemen
and officials from the old regime. Others said it may mean
some former troops are in jungles or other isolated areas.
An order signed by Gen. Tran Van Tra, head of the
Saigon military committee, said anyone still hiding after
midnight May 31 would be severely punished, according
to the broadcast. Tra also said that all who have
"temporarily reported" must do so again. The previous
deadline had been Wednesday.
Another broadcast said the release of "political

prisoners" of the old Saigon regime was under way and
called on prisoners already freed and families of prisoners
to plan a welcoming ceremony for persons returning from
Con Son prison island.
The government of former President Nguyen Van
Thieu never acknowledged holding political prisoners, but
communists alleged there were tens of thousands.
Duong Van Minh, the neutralist retired general who
was president of South Vietnam for three days before last
week's surrender, also was at liberty, according to the Viet
Cong's Liberation radio, believed to emanate from Hanoi.
A broadcast said Minh, his premier, Vu Van Mau, and
14 other cabinet and legislative figures were released from
custody Friday in a meeting at the presidential palace,
asked to contribute to reconstruction and invited to a
Revolutionary Government reception.
Ford Wants $507 Million Refugee Aid
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration requested
an additional $507 million yesterday for the care and
relocation of South Vietnamese refugees but ran into
immediate resistance in Congress.
The director of Ford's refugee task force, Ambassador
L. Dean Brown, said the money is needed within a week
because of $98 million fund for postwar reconstruction of
Vietnam, now used to pay for the program, will be spent
by then.
Testifying before the House immigration
subcommittee, Brown said the refugees are now estimated
to number about 135,000.
He believes the country's attitude is changing toward
welcome for the refugees, Brown said, and even if the
number of refugees reached 150,000, only about 30,000
would seek jobs.
He said the U.S. is urging other countries to take
refugees, adding that, if there are no widespread killings in
South Vietnam, "I believe we would see a large outflow
back. This is their homeland."
"I'm under no illusion this will come quickly," he said.
Subcommittee members complained there were no
specific figures on how many refugees there will be, how
many can pay their own way or what will happen to
South Vietnamese who profiteered or tortured people
during the war.
Rep. Joshua Eilberg (D-Pa.), subcommittee chairman,
said the subcommittee may act within a week but
predicted it will not approve the full $507 million request.

Fingerprints Identify SLA Members
SACRAMENTO — A witness told the Marcus Foster
murder trial jury yesterday how fingers were cut off to
identify the charred remains of six Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) members.
