# Stanford Doctors To Meet With California Legislators
##

More than 20 Stanford Medical
School doctors will hold emergency
meetings today with legislators in
Sacramento to discuss the medical
malpractice insurance problem in the
Bay Area.
The problem, which has led to the
refusal by hundreds of physicians in
northern California to perform all but
emergency surgery, is "a national
crisis," said Philip Larson, chairman of
the hospital's Anesthesia Department.
In eight northern California
counties, including San Francisco,
Marin, Alameda and Contra Costa,
group malpractice insurance policies
have been canceled, and insurance
companies are only offering individual
policies.
Insurance Rates Up
Because of skyrocketing
malpractice insurance rates, some
doctors are facing hikes of 330
percent, Larson said.
Anesthesiologists are particularly
hard hit by the rate increase, he added.
However, the rise in insurance rates
is not likely to affect Stanford for
some time, because most physicians in
Santa Clara and San Mateo counties
are covered by group malpractice
insurance policies with Travelers
Insurance Co. These policies do not

run out until November.
But doctors here will face the same
situation as doctors in the other eight
northern California counties unless
something is done, Larson warned.
Bills
Larson said his group will not
support any of the numerous federal
and state bills currently being reviewed
by legislators at the meetings today.
"No matter which bill they look at,
I think they should keep some basic
principles in mind," he said.
One of these principles is "to make
the liability of the insurance company
predictable," Larson said. In
high-reward malpractice suits this year
patients may be awarded close to $2
million, Larson said. "Who's to say
whether it will or won't be $10 million
in two years?"

Because insurance companies are
not sure how much they are going to
be liable for, they don't know how
much to charge, Larson said.
He said he also will urge legislators
to pass laws which will insure that the
patients get a larger fraction of
malpractice premiums paid by doctors.
He estimated that only about 18
percent of the premiums go to patient*
who win malpractice suits now. The
rest goes to insurance companies and
toward the cost of litigation, he said.
Larson said he will also urge
legislators to change current
malpractice insurance policies which
he said discriminate against certain
policy holders.
Some part-time anesthesiologists do
not handle as many cases as those that
work full time, but they are forced to
pay the same premiums, Larson said.
