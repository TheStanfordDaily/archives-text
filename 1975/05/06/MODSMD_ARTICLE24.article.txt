# City Committee To Study Nuclear Energy Source
## 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night voted to establish a committee
of 15 members to study the feasibility
of nuclear power as a potential energy
source for the city.
Councilwoman Enid Pearson
proposed that the citizen committee
be appointed to gather information
and make recommendations regarding
the issue of nuclear power.
"This is a moral issue and requires
great input from our citizens," Pearson
said.
Pearson said she preferred a
citizen's committee to a public hearing
before the council, believing that
through such a committee the
community as well as the council
would be educated. "A minimum
expenditure of $35 million should
involve the citizens," Pearson added.
The committee was established by a

5-4 vote. It will have six months in
which to prepare its recommendations
to the council.
The committee is to concern itself
with the sociological, environmental
and safety aspects relating to the
question of nuclear power. There will
be a mandatory minimum of two
public meetings.
The council members discussed the
city's membership in a group of five
cities that would financially support
geothermal research. The city would
contribute $116,000 annually toward
the research and development of
geothermal energy resources.
The danger in investing in the
geothermal research is that "one might
drill for steam and not find it," stated
Mayor Byron Sher. The question
before the council is whether to join
the five cities or develop an alternate
plan for future energy resources.
