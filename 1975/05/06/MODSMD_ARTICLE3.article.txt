# Supervisors Curtail Dial-A-Ride Services
## 
### BILL MacDOUGALL 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors last night voted to curtail
Dial-A-Ride, the controversial, flexible
bus system.
An expanded fixed route system
will replace dial-a-ride as proposed by
Supervisor Rod Diridon. Dial-A-Ride
will continue only in the rural area of
the county, south of San Jose.
These reinstituted routes would
include route 31 which ran from
College Terrace to downtown Palo
Alto, and route 36 which was a
circular rouie in central Palo Alto.
Diridon's proposal said the county
will also study other methods of
helping the aged, the blind and the
handicapped, such as subsidization of
private taxi trips.
Taxi Purchase Canceled
The bus pool services in which a
bus picks up a group of people from
an area and transports them to
on-location will continue throughout
the county.
County Counsel William Siegel said
he thought that because of this action
the county will not be required to
purchase competing taxi cab
companies except in Gilroy and
Morgan Hill.
Superior Court Judge Marshall Hall
ordered the county last January to
purchase all the taxi cab companies in
the county or discontinue Dial-A-Ride,
on the grounds that state law requires
transit districts to purchase all
competing systems.
Diridon's motion was supported by
Supervisors Sig Sanchez and Gerry
Steinberg. Supervisor Dominic Cortese
voted against the motion and
Supervisor Dan McCorquodale
abstained.
Bechtel Recommendation
The action came in the wake of a
recommendation passed last
Wednesday by a 17-1 vote of the Santa
Clara County Transit Commission to
accept the recommendations of a
consulting firm to eliminate

Dial-A-Ride.
Bechtel Inc. was hired for $44,000
eight weeks ago to study the county
transit system.
In their final report released April
23, Bechtel recommended that the
county terminate Dial-A-Ride unless it
was willing to substantially increase its
bus fleet.
The county owns only 212 buses.
However, all but 75 of them are used
for fixed route arterial service. Bechtel
said that to provide "adequate"
Dial-A-Ride service during peak hours,
the county would need to use 334
buses.
Inadequate
The Bechtel report said that
because of this vehicle shortage,
Dial-A-Ride is inadequate during
off-peak hours and virtually
non-existent during peak hours.
The report also said the district's

goal of replacing 80 percent of the
automobile transportation with public
transportation by 1990 was somewhat
unrealistic.
Bechtel said this market
penetration level would require — in
addition to the proposed 140 mile
fixed railway system — "an estimated
fleet of 6000 buses."
The report said a "more
conventional goal of five percent
market penetration" would itself be
"no small task."
Deficit Illegal
McCorquodale said the current
Dial-A-Ride system carries 6000 riders
a day. "Using the same equipment on
fixed routes we could carry 21,000
riders," he said.
Sanchez said that "We tried to do
too much with too little." But he
added "I hope to see Dial-A-Ride
sometime in the future."

buses.
Inadequate
The Bechtel report said that
because of this vehicle shortage,
Dial-A-Ride is inadequate during
off-peak hours and virtually
non-existent during peak hours.
The report also said the district's

goal of replacing 80 percent of the
automobile transportation with public
transportation by 1990 was somewhat
unrealistic.
Bechtel said this market
penetration level would require — in
addition to the proposed 140 mile
fixed railway system — "an estimated
fleet of 6000 buses."
The report said a "more
conventional goal of five percent
market penetration" would itself be
"no small task."
Deficit Illegal
McCorquodale said the current
Dial-A-Ride system carries 6000 riders
a day. "Using the same equipment on
fixed routes we could carry 21,000
riders," he said.
Sanchez said that "We tried to do
too much with too little." But he
added "I hope to see Dial-A-Ride
sometime in the future."
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors last night voted to curtail
Dial-A-Ride, the controversial, flexible
bus system.
An expanded fixed route system
will replace dial-a-ride as proposed by
Supervisor Rod Diridon. Dial-A-Ride
will continue only in the rural area of
the county, south of San Jose.
These reinstituted routes would
include route 31 which ran from
College Terrace to downtown Palo
Alto, and route 36 which was a
circular rouie in central Palo Alto.
Diridon's proposal said the county
will also study other methods of
helping the aged, the blind and the
handicapped, such as subsidization of
private taxi trips.
Taxi Purchase Canceled
The bus pool services in which a
bus picks up a group of people from
an area and transports them to
on-location will continue throughout
the county.
County Counsel William Siegel said
he thought that because of this action
the county will not be required to
purchase competing taxi cab
companies except in Gilroy and
Morgan Hill.
Superior Court Judge Marshall Hall
ordered the county last January to
purchase all the taxi cab companies in
the county or discontinue Dial-A-Ride,
on the grounds that state law requires
transit districts to purchase all
competing systems.
Diridon's motion was supported by
Supervisors Sig Sanchez and Gerry
Steinberg. Supervisor Dominic Cortese
voted against the motion and
Supervisor Dan McCorquodale
abstained.
Bechtel Recommendation
The action came in the wake of a
recommendation passed last
Wednesday by a 17-1 vote of the Santa
Clara County Transit Commission to
accept the recommendations of a
consulting firm to eliminate

Dial-A-Ride.
Bechtel Inc. was hired for $44,000
eight weeks ago to study the county
transit system.
In their final report released April
23, Bechtel recommended that the
county terminate Dial-A-Ride unless it
was willing to substantially increase its
bus fleet.
The county owns only 212 buses.
However, all but 75 of them are used
for fixed route arterial service. Bechtel
said that to provide "adequate"
Dial-A-Ride service during peak hours,
the county would need to use 334
buses.
