# State Ruling Won't Affect Medical School
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
The Medical School will not lose its
state funding as had been feared,
according to University administrators.
State officials had believed that a
California attorney general's opinion,
which denied $983,000 of state
scholarship funding to the Loma Linda
University Medical School, might be
applied to both Stanford and the
University of Southern California (USC).
Both Stanford and USC are part of
a three-year-old state Scholarship and
Loan Commission (SLC) program
which provides private institutions
with up to $12,000 per year for each
medical student whom the University
contracts to add to its roles above the
school's 1971-72 enrollment level.

John Schwartz said that "the SLC has
informed Stanford ihat it's not
interpreting the opinion to preclude
Stanford from the program."
'Number Of Prpblems'
Schwartz commented that "there
were a number of problems with the
Loma Linda situation. The attorney
general's opinion deals with each of
these problems.
"The attorney general's conclusion
was that it was not lawful for the state
(Scholarship and| Loan Commission
to pay Loma Linda to enter into
contracts in accordance with this
legislation," said Schwartz.
Schwartz explained that the
decision was based on the facts that
Loma Linda had a religious affiliation
with the Seventh Day Adventist
Church, that Loma Linda had not
complied with the affirmative action
requirement in the legislation and that
the state constitution "appears to
prohibit this kind of aid to private or
religious institutions."
Constitutional Clause
The clause of the constitution in
question (Article 9, Section 8), reads,
"No public money shall ever be
appropriated for the support of any
sectarian or denominational school, or
any school not under the exclusive
control of the public schools."
Schwartz said that the attorney
general did not make clear which of
these reasons "was paramount" for the
ruling.
"It's my understanding that this
opinion was restricted to the particular
case at hand, and should not affect the
rest of the aid for the University,"
Schwartz said.

Spyros Andreopoulos explained that
the basis for the state program was
that the state thought "it would be
cheaper for schools to increase their
class size than to build new schools,
and so private schools were included."
