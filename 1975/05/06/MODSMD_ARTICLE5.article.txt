## Senate' Certifies' C-15 Election 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Senate voted 8-7 in a
roll call vote last night to "certify" the
election results on the Committee of
15's (C-15) proposal to revise the
judicial system.
Senators disagreed on whether the
referendum on the C-15 proposal
should be considered an opinion poll,
meant to guide senate action, or
whether the senate, in placing the
matter on the ballot, had given the
student body the binding decision on
the matter.
The senate also voted 13-0-1 to
certify all other election results.
Upon certification of his election to
the Council of Presidents, Lee
Rosenbaum resigned as senate
chairman. Vice Chairman Janice
Haney chaired the rest of the meeting.
According to Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald, except
for the senior class elections, the vote
counts presented to the senate last
night include reports from the overseas
campuses in England, France, Italy,
Germany and Austria.
"'Certify' Not 'Ratify'
The senate decided to "certify"
rather than "ratify" election results,
after deciding that to "certify" meant
merely affirming that the election had
been a proper one, while to "ratify"
would imply agreement in the
"rightness" of the result.
Sens. Chris Gray, Charlotte
Germane, Debbi Silton, Lyse Strnad,
Mike Dorsey, David Harris and Charles
Chernack opposed certification of the
election results on the C-15 proposal.
Those senators argued that the
ambiguity of the wording on the ballot
may have led confused students to
mark "No Choice" when they meant
"No," and that therefore it is possible
that the students did not really want
to approve the C-15 proposal.
Other senators replied that the
students were intelligent enough to
figure out the difference between
voting "No" and voting "No Choice."
'Matter Of Politics'
Sen. Tim Conway commented that
the dissent was "just a matter of
politics" on the part of senate
members who hadn't wanted the
proposal to pass. By refusing to certify
the votes, the senate would be saying
that "the students don't know what
they're doing," Conway said. Sen. Vic
Petroff agreed.
After over an hour of discussion,
the senate certified the election result.
Silton presented a resolution,
amended by Sen. Mike Linsey (who

had voted for certification of C-15
election results) that the senate
request the Faculty Senate to consider
that the "irregularities" in the election
cast "some doubt on the accuracy of
the results" and that the issue be
placed on the fall ballot in a "clearer
form to resolve the ambiguity."
Ambiguous Language
The resolution argued that the
student body vote was not a binding
action, and that there was some
ambiguity in the language and format
of the ballot. It also pointed out that
1711 students had voted either "No"
or "No Choice" while only 796 had
voted "Yes."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Dale Snape pointed out that if the
senate approved Silton's resolution, it
would create confusion in the Faculty
Senate as to what the senate meant.
The uncertainty would "kill" the C-15
proposal, Snape said.

Traditionally, Snape said, placing
the C-15 proposal on the ballot had
meant getting back to basics by letting
the student body decide. He
maintained that the same held true in
this case.
Rosenbaum disagreed with Snape,
saying that according to senate
minutes, the final decision in this case
was the senate's. He added that
whether or not the senate should
ignore the student vote was another
matter.
Debate dragged on for over an
hour, ending unresolved shortly after
11 p.m. when the senate lost a quorum
and adjourned.
In other action, the senate voted
9-0, with four abstentions, to give
Fitzgerald a vote of confidence and
censure the Daily for an "abusive and
vituperative attitude toward the
elections commissioner."
