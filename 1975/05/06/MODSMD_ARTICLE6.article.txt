## Parking Plan 
### 
The report on parking issued last week by the
University Committee on Land and Building
Development (C-LBD) recommends a system which
would retain most of the advantages of the earlier
Carpenter study while eliminating many of the features
of the Carpenter report which proved objectionable to
students.
A major advantage of the C-LBD study is that it
recommends a substantially lower student parking fee.
On-campus students will have to pay $5 per quarter for
parking near their residences, compared with the $16 per
quarter suggested by the report of Peter Carpenter,
assistant vice president for medical affairs.
In addition, the $5 fee will guarantee the student a
parking space, whereas Carpenter recommended
overselling the lots. We think that the C-LBD report is
thus fairer to students with cars, who should not be
forced to pay stiff fines to leave cars in residence lots.
The new plan is also fairer to off-campus students,
faculty and staff, all of whom will have to pay a parking
fee only if they wish to park in areas designated as
"convenient," under the C-LBD report. If they choose
not to pay the money and park in less convenient areas,
they will be able to register their cars for free.
While improving the fee structure, the C-LBD plan
retains the basic structure of the Carpenter report,
dividing parking spaces into academic, residence and free
zoneÂ£ A minor flaw in both reports, however, is that the
parking lot next to Tresidder, in the center of the
campus, is designated as "free."
We suggest that this lot be made into a 40-minute zone
during working hours, so that drivers could not evade the
parking fee by using this lot. At night, when visitors come
to campus for events at Tresidder and Dinkelspiel, the lot
could revert to being free.
Other than this, however, the C-LBD report seems to
answer most of the objections made to the Carpenter
study. We are glad to see that the C-LBD took the
opinions of students into account when making its
recommendations. The time the committee took in
soliciting input is reflected in the quality of the final
report.
