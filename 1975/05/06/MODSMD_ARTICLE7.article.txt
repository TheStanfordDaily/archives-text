# Save The Coast

Over 1000 miles of coastline
form the scenic western border
of California. The rapid growth
of population, development, and
interest in exploiting the coastal
zone's natural resources have put
our coast in serious danger.
In November 1972, the voters
of California took the first step
to protect the coast region with
the passage of the Coastal
Initiative (Proposition 20).
The initiative provided for
the founding of the California
Coastal Zone Conservation
Commission and through this
body a Coast Plan for the
protection and preservation
would be prepared.
Beauty, Peace
Many of you will be
immediately affected by the
Coast Plan. Those of you
who have grown up along or
near the California coast have
experienced first-hand the
beauty and tranquility of the
coastal zone. You have also
witnessed the overdevelopment
of both small coast towns and
large metropolitan areas such as
Los Angeles/Orange County.
You have seen the damage
done by oil spills and sewage
drainage and the threat of
malfunctions in nuclear power
plants, and the list goes on.
Others of you have lived on
the coast in other states and seen
similar growth problems. The
Coast Plan is significant in your
case because its decisions will
influence the policy of all
coastal states.
Frustrations
Some of you have always
lived inland; the Coast Plan also

affects you. Trips to the ocean
become very frustrating when
you have to travel miles up and
down the coast just to find a
public beach.
As a citizen of California, you
have the legal right to experience
the ocean from the mean high
tide line to three miles out to
sea. The problem is finding
public access to the tidal zone.
If you have any interest in, or
appreciation of, the coastline,
the Coast Plan will affect you.
Whether you agree with the
commission's findings and
policies or not, you should
familiarize yourself with the
Coast Plan and act now.
Act Now!
This is what you can do: As
of this date, the commission has
come up with a preliminary
Coast Plan which was written to
be changed with the outcome of
state-wide regional public
hearings, concerning the plan.
Basically the plan covers public
access, development,
transportation, recreation,
energy, marine and coastal
environment, and recom
mendations for implementation
of the plan.
During May and June the
public hearings will take place.
Now is the time to find out the
workings of the plan and voice
suggestions and dissatisfaction.
If you have any further
questions at all, please get in
touch with me.
