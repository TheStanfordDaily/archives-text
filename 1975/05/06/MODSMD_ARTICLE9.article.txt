# Horton Shuns Simple Solution
## 
### William Ross 
Perfectionism won a victory over
compromise last week in the housing office
and 48 students got shafted in the process.
Rather than make minor revisions in the
University's new French theme house.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton and the Committee on Student
Services (COSS) decided to axe altogether
the first Stanford-in-Stanford program.
Many students never liked the idea of a
residential study program. But
approximately 25 students liked the idea
enough to list ZAP house, the residential
study program residence, as their first choice
in the spring housing draw. Quite a few
others listed it as less than a first choice, and
38 were finally assigned to it.
Since ZAP house had 49 spaces and the
University couldn't allow 11 spaces to
remain unfilled while so many students
don't have any on-campus assignment, the
housing office decided to cancel the program
altogether.
Meanwhile, dozens of students were
turned down for placement in the 39-space
Guthrie House, site of the new French
theme house
Hence, by a simple compromise, the
University could have relocated the
Stanford-in-Stanford house in Guthrie and
reassigned the French theme house to ZAP.
A total of 48 students would have
benefited from the change — the 38
students who wanted to participate in
Stanford-in-Stanford plus 10 of the students
who were turned down for placement in the
French house.
Trade Needed Consent
Horton and COSS, however, decided that
moving the French theme house would be
unjust to its participants. With three
members voting in the affirmative and three
abstaining, COSS voted to trade houses only
with the consent of the French program's
leaders.
After consulting the program's core
group. Asst. French Prof. David Brostoff
expressed the group's opinion that it didn't

want to move. The issue was settled.
But the reasons offered in a Sunday Daily
interview by Brostoff seemed highly
inadequate.
First, Brostoff noted that ZAP is further
from The Bechtel International Center,
Hammarskjold House and the Quadrangle
than is Guthrie.
This is true, but since the theme of the
first Stanford-in-Stanford program is
International Relations and Arms Control,
Stanford-in-Stanford had just as much
reason for being near those three places as
did the French house.
Intangible Atmosphere
Brostoff also claimed that ZAP had an
'intangible atmosphere" that he found

"strikingly different" from Guthrie's and
didn't like. While Brostoff is probably
correct in assuming that Guthrie would suit
the French theme house better than would
ZAP. this hardly seems a justification for
allowing the first Stanford-in-Stanford
program to be dropped.
Although Brostoff told me that "it was
not ap easy decision to make and we
pondered over it at great length," the fact is
that the decision was made and it smacks of
selfishness.
If the* French program's leaders had
chosen to move, both the French program
and next years Stanford-in-Stanford
program could have survived. Now only one
survives, even though plans are already
underway for a 1976-7 7
Stanford-in-Stanford theme.

As ASSU President Mike Herman pointed
out last week, however, the French program
might have suffered somewhat from the
move, and it was only natural for its
organizers to want to preserve it in the best
possible form.
' It was a selfish decision, but I don't
mean selfish in the usual, negative
connotation of the word," Herman told me.
But even if one assumes that the French
house leaders should have acted out of
self-interest ~ and I'm not sure that they
should have — there seems to
be no excuse for the decision of Horton and
COSS to in effect leave the decision up to
the French theme house's organizers.
Passing The Buck
Horton and COSS seem to have passed
the buck. Rather than make an unpleasant
decision alone, they told Brostoff that he
could decide whether or not to move the
house so that they could escape some of the
responsibility for the decision.
Horton's fear that neither program would
function as well in a different house than
it would have in its original location is
probably well-founded. The carefully laid
plans for the programs assumed they'd be
located in particular places. But it's absurd to
assume that a mere house could have made
all the difference between the success or
failure of the programs.
It is therefore hard to understand why
the housing office preferred to cancel one
program altogether rather than to bend both
programs a little bit.
I have no personal gripe. I didn't ask to
be in either program and to me, residential
study seems more stultifying than
enlightening. But at least 48 students saw
the matter differently, and the housing
office should have given them what they
wanted by way of a very simple
compromise.

Stanford-in-Stanford had just as much
reason for being near those three places as
did the French house.
Intangible Atmosphere
Brostoff also claimed that ZAP had an
'intangible atmosphere" that he found

"strikingly different" from Guthrie's and
didn't like. While Brostoff is probably
correct in assuming that Guthrie would suit
the French theme house better than would
ZAP. this hardly seems a justification for
allowing the first Stanford-in-Stanford
program to be dropped.
Although Brostoff told me that "it was
not ap easy decision to make and we
pondered over it at great length," the fact is
that the decision was made and it smacks of
selfishness.
If the* French program's leaders had
chosen to move, both the French program
and next years Stanford-in-Stanford
program could have survived. Now only one
survives, even though plans are already
underway for a 1976-7 7
Stanford-in-Stanford theme.

As ASSU President Mike Herman pointed
out last week, however, the French program
might have suffered somewhat from the
move, and it was only natural for its
organizers to want to preserve it in the best
possible form.
' It was a selfish decision, but I don't
mean selfish in the usual, negative
connotation of the word," Herman told me.
But even if one assumes that the French
house leaders should have acted out of
self-interest ~ and I'm not sure that they
should have — there seems to
be no excuse for the decision of Horton and
COSS to in effect leave the decision up to
the French theme house's organizers.
Passing The Buck
Horton and COSS seem to have passed
the buck. Rather than make an unpleasant
decision alone, they told Brostoff that he
could decide whether or not to move the
house so that they could escape some of the
responsibility for the decision.
Horton's fear that neither program would
function as well in a different house than
it would have in its original location is
probably well-founded. The carefully laid
plans for the programs assumed they'd be
located in particular places. But it's absurd to
assume that a mere house could have made
all the difference between the success or
failure of the programs.
It is therefore hard to understand why
the housing office preferred to cancel one
program altogether rather than to bend both
programs a little bit.
I have no personal gripe. I didn't ask to
be in either program and to me, residential
study seems more stultifying than
enlightening. But at least 48 students saw
the matter differently, and the housing
office should have given them what they
wanted by way of a very simple
compromise.

Perfectionism won a victory over
compromise last week in the housing office
and 48 students got shafted in the process.
Rather than make minor revisions in the
University's new French theme house.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton and the Committee on Student
Services (COSS) decided to axe altogether
the first Stanford-in-Stanford program.
Many students never liked the idea of a
residential study program. But
approximately 25 students liked the idea
enough to list ZAP house, the residential
study program residence, as their first choice
in the spring housing draw. Quite a few
others listed it as less than a first choice, and
38 were finally assigned to it.
Since ZAP house had 49 spaces and the
University couldn't allow 11 spaces to
remain unfilled while so many students
don't have any on-campus assignment, the
housing office decided to cancel the program
altogether.
Meanwhile, dozens of students were
turned down for placement in the 39-space
Guthrie House, site of the new French
theme house
Hence, by a simple compromise, the
University could have relocated the
Stanford-in-Stanford house in Guthrie and
reassigned the French theme house to ZAP.
A total of 48 students would have
benefited from the change — the 38
students who wanted to participate in
Stanford-in-Stanford plus 10 of the students
who were turned down for placement in the
French house.
Trade Needed Consent
Horton and COSS, however, decided that
moving the French theme house would be
unjust to its participants. With three
members voting in the affirmative and three
abstaining, COSS voted to trade houses only
with the consent of the French program's
leaders.
After consulting the program's core
group. Asst. French Prof. David Brostoff
expressed the group's opinion that it didn't

want to move. The issue was settled.
But the reasons offered in a Sunday Daily
interview by Brostoff seemed highly
inadequate.
First, Brostoff noted that ZAP is further
from The Bechtel International Center,
Hammarskjold House and the Quadrangle
than is Guthrie.
This is true, but since the theme of the
first Stanford-in-Stanford program is
International Relations and Arms Control,
Stanford-in-Stanford had just as much

the housing office preferred to cancel one
program altogether rather than to bend both
programs a little bit.
I have no personal gripe. I didn't ask to
be in either program and to me, residential
study seems more stultifying than
enlightening. But at least 48 students saw
the matter differently, and the housing
office should have given them what they
wanted by way of a very simple
compromise.

Perfectionism won a victory over
compromise last week in the housing office
and 48 students got shafted in the process.
Rather than make minor revisions in the
University's new French theme house.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton and the Committee on Student
Services (COSS) decided to axe altogether
the first Stanford-in-Stanford program.
Many students never liked the idea of a
residential study program. But
approximately 25 students liked the idea
enough to list ZAP house, the residential
study program residence, as their first choice
in the spring housing draw. Quite a few
others listed it as less than a first choice, and
38 were finally assigned to it.
Since ZAP house had 49 spaces and the
University couldn't allow 11 spaces to
remain unfilled while so many students
don't have any on-campus assignment, the
housing office decided to cancel the program
altogether.
Meanwhile, dozens of students were
turned down for placement in the 39-space
Guthrie House, site of the new French
theme house
Hence, by a simple compromise, the
University could have relocated the
Stanford-in-Stanford house in Guthrie and
reassigned the French theme house to ZAP.
A total of 48 students would have
benefited from the change — the 38
students who wanted to participate in
Stanford-in-Stanford plus 10 of the students
who were turned down for placement in the
French house.
Trade Needed Consent
Horton and COSS, however, decided that
moving the French theme house would be
unjust to its participants. With three
members voting in the affirmative and three
abstaining, COSS voted to trade houses only
with the consent of the French program's
leaders.
After consulting the program's core
group. Asst. French Prof. David Brostoff
expressed the group's opinion that it didn't

want to move. The issue was settled.
But the reasons offered in a Sunday Daily
interview by Brostoff seemed highly
inadequate.
First, Brostoff noted that ZAP is further
from The Bechtel International Center,
Hammarskjold House and the Quadrangle
than is Guthrie.
This is true, but since the theme of the
first Stanford-in-Stanford program is
International Relations and Arms Control,
Stanford-in-Stanford had just as much
reason for being near those three places as
did the French house.
Intangible Atmosphere
Brostoff also claimed that ZAP had an
'intangible atmosphere" that he found

"strikingly different" from Guthrie's and
didn't like. While Brostoff is probably
correct in assuming that Guthrie would suit
the French theme house better than would
ZAP. this hardly seems a justification for
allowing the first Stanford-in-Stanford
program to be dropped.
Although Brostoff told me that "it was
not ap easy decision to make and we
pondered over it at great length," the fact is
that the decision was made and it smacks of
selfishness.
If the* French program's leaders had
chosen to move, both the French program
and next years Stanford-in-Stanford
program could have survived. Now only one
survives, even though plans are already
underway for a 1976-7 7
Stanford-in-Stanford theme.

As ASSU President Mike Herman pointed
out last week, however, the French program
might have suffered somewhat from the
move, and it was only natural for its
organizers to want to preserve it in the best
possible form.
' It was a selfish decision, but I don't
mean selfish in the usual, negative
connotation of the word," Herman told me.
But even if one assumes that the French
house leaders should have acted out of
self-interest ~ and I'm not sure that they
should have — there seems to
be no excuse for the decision of Horton and
COSS to in effect leave the decision up to
the French theme house's organizers.
Passing The Buck
Horton and COSS seem to have passed
the buck. Rather than make an unpleasant
decision alone, they told Brostoff that he
could decide whether or not to move the
house so that they could escape some of the
responsibility for the decision.
Horton's fear that neither program would
function as well in a different house than
it would have in its original location is
probably well-founded. The carefully laid
plans for the programs assumed they'd be
located in particular places. But it's absurd to
assume that a mere house could have made
all the difference between the success or
failure of the programs.
It is therefore hard to understand why
the housing office preferred to cancel one
program altogether rather than to bend both
programs a little bit.
I have no personal gripe. I didn't ask to
be in either program and to me, residential
study seems more stultifying than
enlightening. But at least 48 students saw
the matter differently, and the housing
office should have given them what they
wanted by way of a very simple
compromise.
