TRAVEL IS BROADENING
So why not leave the campus occasionally and venture into Terra
Incognita?
The Terra Incognita Improvement Association would like you to
see our new bookstore at 711 Santa Cruz in Menlo Park. As an in
ducement we are instituting our 10% DISCOUNT SUNDAYS. As
the catchy name implies, we will offer a 10% DISCOUNT to all
students and Faculty with I.D. on any book in the store each Sun
day from now until we get tired of it. Why Sundays-? It's lonely
down here on Sundays.
Why not venture down (or is it over? or across? or up? We're new
here). Our hours are: Mon.-Thur. 10 a.m.-9 p.m., Fri & Sat.
10 a.m.-11 p.m., Sun. 12-5 p.m.
