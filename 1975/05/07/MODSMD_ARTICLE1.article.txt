The title for this powerful
account of the Attica tragedy
might have come from the Bible's
Book of Ecclesiastes: To
everything there is a season, and a
time to every purpose under
heaven.
Actually, though, it came from
Congressman Herman Badillo.
Sitting in a prison office while
police and state troopers put
down the inmate uprising, holding
a handkerchief to his facc to avoid
the effects of the clouds of gas
outside, Badillo said quietly,
"There's always time to die. I
don't know what the rush was."
Whether right or wrong, the
results of "the rush" arc
indisputable. Out of the
approximately 1500 men in the
yard of the upstate New York
prison on Sept. 13, 1971, 39 died
as a result of the police assault —
10 of them hostages. Another
person — a guard — died of
injuries received during the melee
that led to the uprising. Three
others — all inmates — died under
mysterious circumstances while
the prisoners were in control. All

told, 43 lives were lost.
Tom Wicksr. columnist and
associate editor of the New York
Times, was there at the inmates'
request to act as an "observer." A
Time to Die is his moving, often
disturbing account of the four
climaxed by that terrible
bloodbath.
Wicker is a Southerner by
birth, a journalist by profession
and a liberal by politics. He felt he
had been summoned to Attica
because his writings in the Times
conveyed an empathy, or at least
sympathy, with the downtrodden
of American society.
But once at the prison, he
discovered that nothing in his
professional career, or his entire
life, had really prepared him for
what he found: a world of
frequent, sometimes almost
random violence, of inadequate
food and shelter, of forced labor
for pennies a day, of sub-par
medical treatment and one shower
a month.
Almost from the beginning,
Wicker realized contradictions: in
himself, in his work, in his role at
the prison. Was he to be an
observer or negotiator? Was he
asked there to help formulate a
settlement, or to tell the world

through the formidable voice of
the Times of the conditions at
Attica? Were "his people" the
armed troopers and state officials
on the outside — all of them white
or where they the screaming
inmates — mostly black and
Puerto Rican holding hostages
on the inside? Or were they all
"his people?" Or were none of
them?
These are the questions that
went through his mind during
those four days. Many arc never
answered, or answered
unsatisfactorily even to Wicker's
mind. But their very presence —
and the author's own lack of
reluctance to answer "I don't
know" — testify to the honesty of
the book.
For Wicker, the four days at
Attica challenged many of his
own assumptions about himself.
Before Attica, he could tell
himself he had long ago outgrown
that part of his Southern heritage
that taught him to consider blacks
as a unitary mass, rather than as
individual human beings.
But when the observers entered
the prison to meet with the
inmates, Wicker realized that the
old notions had really been only
submerged, not destroyed. The
catalyst for the realization was
fear: fear of being under the
control - even temporarily of a
society so different from his own.

Wicker, of course, was far from
alone in his emotions; no less than
radical lawyer William Kunstler, a
fellow observer, freely admitted
that "all of my white, middleclass
fears and images about prisoners
had come to the fore" during his
time within the walls.
But in conceding his own fears,
Wicker provides a kind of
self-catharsis: by admitting that
such fears still exist within him,
he feels he has taken the first
steps towards overcoming them.
Wicker uses third-person
narration to keep such admissions
and baring of emotions from
becoming maudlin. The result is a
work that combines such
intensely personal perceptions
with the sense of detachment that
is the hallmark of his profession.
The book, thus, is equally a
chronology of Attica, of pride and
passion, of official arrogancc and
inmate sword-rattling, of
occasional flashes of concern and
humanity on all sides. Here
Wicker functions as the
consummate newsman he is,
recounting meetings,
reconstructing arguments and
giving the reader a sense of
presence at the tragedy. He even
takes the reader via telephone
to the office of then New York
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, as the
observers futilcly plead with him
to come to Attica and meet with

them.
The overriding question that is
the legacy of Attica is, of course,
"Could it have been avoided?"
Wicker frankly says he doesn't
know. He was, he admits, "a
moderate to the end. He could
not be sure where the fault lay,
how much in men, how much in
systems. He did not know what
might have been done. But he
could not see himself, or [prison
chief Russell| Oswald, or Nelson
Rockefeller, the dead hostages,
the brothers cut down in the mud
of D-yard, as the helpless pawns
of relentless forces."
Considered with that is the
painful reality: despite threats to
the contrary, the inmates killed
no hostages. Every man - hostage
and inmate alike — killed during
the re-taking of D-yard died from
police bullets.
In the end, Wicker writes,
"behind their futile trenches and
barricades, in their vivid flights of
defiance, even in the suspicion
and distrust of their hard
experience, many of these
despised inmates finally had not
believed that the state the
society, The Man would shoot
them down. The hard truth was
that the Attica brothers had had
more faith in the state than the
state had had in them. Both had
been wrong."


BEHIND THE WALLS-Attica observers discuss inmate demands during the four-day siege of the prison.
Among those present was radical lawyer William Kunstler (right). Despite the efforts of the observers, 43
men died as a result of the seizure.

The title for this powerful
account of the Attica tragedy
might have come from the Bible's
Book of Ecclesiastes: To
everything there is a season, and a
time to every purpose under
heaven.
Actually, though, it came from
Congressman Herman Badillo.
Sitting in a prison office while
police and state troopers put
down the inmate uprising, holding
a handkerchief to his facc to avoid
the effects of the clouds of gas
outside, Badillo said quietly,
"There's always time to die. I
don't know what the rush was."
Whether right or wrong, the
results of "the rush" arc
indisputable. Out of the
approximately 1500 men in the
yard of the upstate New York
prison on Sept. 13, 1971, 39 died
as a result of the police assault —
10 of them hostages. Another
person — a guard — died of
injuries received during the melee
that led to the uprising. Three
others — all inmates — died under
mysterious circumstances while
the prisoners were in control. All

told, 43 lives were lost.
Tom Wicksr. columnist and
associate editor of the New York
Times, was there at the inmates'
request to act as an "observer." A
Time to Die is his moving, often
disturbing account of the four
climaxed by that terrible
bloodbath.
Wicker is a Southerner by
birth, a journalist by profession
and a liberal by politics. He felt he
had been summoned to Attica
because his writings in the Times
conveyed an empathy, or at least
sympathy, with the downtrodden
of American society.
But once at the prison, he
discovered that nothing in his
professional career, or his entire
life, had really prepared him for
what he found: a world of
frequent, sometimes almost
random violence, of inadequate
food and shelter, of forced labor
for pennies a day, of sub-par
medical treatment and one shower
a month.
Almost from the beginning,
Wicker realized contradictions: in
himself, in his work, in his role at
the prison. Was he to be an
observer or negotiator? Was he
asked there to help formulate a
settlement, or to tell the world

through the formidable voice of
the Times of the conditions at
Attica? Were "his people" the
armed troopers and state officials
on the outside — all of them white
or where they the screaming
inmates — mostly black and
Puerto Rican holding hostages
on the inside? Or were they all
"his people?" Or were none of
them?
These are the questions that
went through his mind during
those four days. Many arc never
answered, or answered
unsatisfactorily even to Wicker's
mind. But their very presence —
and the author's own lack of
reluctance to answer "I don't
know" — testify to the honesty of
the book.
For Wicker, the four days at
Attica challenged many of his
own assumptions about himself.
Before Attica, he could tell
himself he had long ago outgrown
that part of his Southern heritage
that taught him to consider blacks
as a unitary mass, rather than as
individual human beings.
But when the observers entered
the prison to meet with the
inmates, Wicker realized that the
old notions had really been only
submerged, not destroyed. The
catalyst for the realization was
fear: fear of being under the
control - even temporarily of a
society so different from his own.

Wicker, of course, was far from
alone in his emotions; no less than
radical lawyer William Kunstler, a
fellow observer, freely admitted
that "all of my white, middleclass
fears and images about prisoners
had come to the fore" during his
time within the walls.
But in conceding his own fears,
Wicker provides a kind of
self-catharsis: by admitting that
such fears still exist within him,
he feels he has taken the first
steps towards overcoming them.
Wicker uses third-person
narration to keep such admissions
and baring of emotions from
becoming maudlin. The result is a
work that combines such
intensely personal perceptions
with the sense of detachment that
is the hallmark of his profession.
The book, thus, is equally a
chronology of Attica, of pride and
passion, of official arrogancc and
inmate sword-rattling, of
occasional flashes of concern and
humanity on all sides. Here
Wicker functions as the
consummate newsman he is,
recounting meetings,
reconstructing arguments and
giving the reader a sense of
presence at the tragedy. He even
takes the reader via telephone
to the office of then New York
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, as the
observers futilcly plead with him
to come to Attica and meet with

them.
The overriding question that is
the legacy of Attica is, of course,
"Could it have been avoided?"
Wicker frankly says he doesn't
know. He was, he admits, "a
moderate to the end. He could
not be sure where the fault lay,
how much in men, how much in
systems. He did not know what
might have been done. But he
could not see himself, or [prison
chief Russell| Oswald, or Nelson
Rockefeller, the dead hostages,
the brothers cut down in the mud
of D-yard, as the helpless pawns
of relentless forces."
Considered with that is the
painful reality: despite threats to
the contrary, the inmates killed
no hostages. Every man - hostage
and inmate alike — killed during
the re-taking of D-yard died from
police bullets.
In the end, Wicker writes,
"behind their futile trenches and
barricades, in their vivid flights of
defiance, even in the suspicion
and distrust of their hard
experience, many of these
despised inmates finally had not
believed that the state the
society, The Man would shoot
them down. The hard truth was
that the Attica brothers had had
more faith in the state than the
state had had in them. Both had
been wrong."

The title for this powerful
account of the Attica tragedy
might have come from the Bible's
Book of Ecclesiastes: To
everything there is a season, and a
time to every purpose under
heaven.
Actually, though, it came from
Congressman Herman Badillo.
Sitting in a prison office while
police and state troopers put
down the inmate uprising, holding
a handkerchief to his facc to avoid
the effects of the clouds of gas
outside, Badillo said quietly,
"There's always time to die. I
don't know what the rush was."
Whether right or wrong, the
results of "the rush" arc
indisputable. Out of the
approximately 1500 men in the
yard of the upstate New York
prison on Sept. 13, 1971, 39 died
as a result of the police assault —
10 of them hostages. Another
person — a guard — died of
injuries received during the melee
that led to the uprising. Three
others — all inmates — died under
mysterious circumstances while
the prisoners were in control. All

told, 43 lives were lost.
Tom Wicksr. columnist and
associate editor of the New York
Times, was there at the inmates'
request to act as an "observer." A
Time to Die is his moving, often
disturbing account of the four
climaxed by that terrible
bloodbath.
Wicker is a Southerner by
birth, a journalist by profession
and a liberal by politics. He felt he
had been summoned to Attica
because his writings in the Times
conveyed an empathy, or at least
sympathy, with the downtrodden
of American society.
But once at the prison, he
discovered that nothing in his
professional career, or his entire
life, had really prepared him for
what he found: a world of
frequent, sometimes almost
random violence, of inadequate
food and shelter, of forced labor
for pennies a day, of sub-par
medical treatment and one shower
a month.
Almost from the beginning,
Wicker realized contradictions: in
himself, in his work, in his role at
the prison. Was he to be an
observer or negotiator? Was he
asked there to help formulate a
settlement, or to tell the world

through the formidable voice of
the Times of the conditions at
Attica? Were "his people" the
armed troopers and state officials
on the outside — all of them white
or where they the screaming
inmates — mostly black and
Puerto Rican holding hostages
on the inside? Or were they all
"his people?" Or were none of
them?
These are the questions that
went through his mind during
those four days. Many arc never
answered, or answered
unsatisfactorily even to Wicker's
mind. But their very presence —
and the author's own lack of
reluctance to answer "I don't
know" — testify to the honesty of
the book.
For Wicker, the four days at
Attica challenged many of his
own assumptions about himself.
Before Attica, he could tell
himself he had long ago outgrown
that part of his Southern heritage
that taught him to consider blacks
as a unitary mass, rather than as
individual human beings.
But when the observers entered
the prison to meet with the
inmates, Wicker realized that the
old notions had really been only
submerged, not destroyed. The
catalyst for the realization was
fear: fear of being under the
control - even temporarily of a
society so different from his own.

Wicker, of course, was far from
alone in his emotions; no less than
radical lawyer William Kunstler, a
fellow observer, freely admitted
that "all of my white, middleclass
fears and images about prisoners
had come to the fore" during his
time within the walls.
But in conceding his own fears,
Wicker provides a kind of
self-catharsis: by admitting that
such fears still exist within him,
he feels he has taken the first
steps towards overcoming them.
Wicker uses third-person
narration to keep such admissions
and baring of emotions from
becoming maudlin. The result is a
work that combines such
intensely personal perceptions
with the sense of detachment that
is the hallmark of his profession.
The book, thus, is equally a
chronology of Attica, of pride and
passion, of official arrogancc and
inmate sword-rattling, of
occasional flashes of concern and
humanity on all sides. Here
Wicker functions as the
consummate newsman he is,
recounting meetings,
reconstructing arguments and
giving the reader a sense of
presence at the tragedy. He even
takes the reader via telephone
to the office of then New York
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, as the
observers futilcly plead with him
to come to Attica and meet with

them.
The overriding question that is
the legacy of Attica is, of course,
"Could it have been avoided?"
Wicker frankly says he doesn't
know. He was, he admits, "a
moderate to the end. He could
not be sure where the fault lay,
how much in men, how much in
systems. He did not know what
might have been done. But he
could not see himself, or [prison
chief Russell| Oswald, or Nelson
Rockefeller, the dead hostages,
the brothers cut down in the mud
of D-yard, as the helpless pawns
of relentless forces."
Considered with that is the
painful reality: despite threats to
the contrary, the inmates killed
no hostages. Every man - hostage
and inmate alike — killed during
the re-taking of D-yard died from
police bullets.
In the end, Wicker writes,
"behind their futile trenches and
barricades, in their vivid flights of
defiance, even in the suspicion
and distrust of their hard
experience, many of these
despised inmates finally had not
believed that the state the
society, The Man would shoot
them down. The hard truth was
that the Attica brothers had had
more faith in the state than the
state had had in them. Both had
been wrong."
