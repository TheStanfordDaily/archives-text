# Book notes: sex, pseudo-science
## 
### 
A new book with a big
accolade is The Psychology of Sex
Differences, by Stanford Prof.
Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Nagy
Jacklin (Stanford University Press,
$18.95). The New York Times
Book Review has listed it as one
of its "editors' choices," and calls
it "scholarly but accessible" and
"quietly myth-challenging."

And on other things Stanford,
fired English Prof: H. Bruce
Eranklin has just brought out
Back Where You Came From
(Harper's Magazine Press, $7.95),
which devotes several chapters to
the events that eventually caused
him to be stripped of his tenured
faculty position here.

Richard Nixon may be long
gone from Washington, but his
last crisis is still providing material
for major new books. Already
released is U.S. v. Nixon: The
ci-v,; Crisis Vr-.rt-
Times/Quadrangle, $7.95) by
former McGovern campaign chief
Frank Mankiewicz, with Jimmy
Bresl in's How the Good Guys
Finally Won: Notes on an
Impeachment Summer expected
imminently. Minkiewicz's book is
something of a sequel to his 1974
volume, Perfectly Clear.
But what is perhaps the most
widely awaited Watergate book is
due out this month: Theodore H.
White's. Not to disappoint, but
it's titled neither "The Unmaking
of the President" nor "The
Breaking of the President." It's
Breach of Faith, and Atheneum is
publishing it.

Pseudo-science seems to be big
in hardback this year, with one of
the major sellers of the year being
The Bermuda Triangle by Charles
Berlitz (Doublcday, $7.95), about
a supposedly mysterious stretch
of ocean around Bermuda.
Berlitz's book has been the
subject of much debate,
particularly by researchers who
dispute several "facts" cited by

Berlitz. Now comes another book,
The Bermuda Triangle Mystery:
Solved by Laurence David Kusche
(Harper & Row, $10) that tries to
explode most of Berlitz's
assertions. Whether it does as well
sales-wise as the Berlitz volume
remains to be seen.

Emeritus English Prof. Wallace
Stegner, whose biography of critic
Bernard DcVoto (The Uneasy
Chair) was nominated for a
National Book Award last year,
has just edited a collection of
DeVoto correspondence, The
Letters of Bernard DeVoto
(Doubleday, $10).
* * *
Yet another Stanford figure,
Robert Ornstein, has just issued a
most unusual volume. Entitled
Common Knowledge
(Viking/Compass, $3.50), it's a
collection of — believe it or not —
iniers and oii-oeat news items
culled from the pages of the San
Francisco Chronicle. It's subtitled,
"Can of Foot Powder Elected
Mayor of Ecuadorian Town."

Fiction has been in something
of an economic slump lately;
word has it that the market is
slow and very difficult for new
authors to break into.
One possible way to pick up
the market — which may not be
greeted with great pleasure by
book-buyers — is an increase in
prices. The great experiment in
this department is James
Michener's latest epic, Centennial.
Random House, Michener's
publisher, assigned a $12.50 price
tag to the book — previous ceiling
was $10 — and watched closely
for any signs of customer
resistance. But the book has been
riding the top of the best-seller
lists for months.

George V. Higgins was a federal
prosecutor in Boston when his
first novel was published. The

Friends of Eddie Coyle, and then
The Digger's Game, both dealt
with small-time hoods in the
Boston underworld. In what may
be a commentary of some sort,
Higgins's latest book deals with
Washington and politics. It's A
City On a Hill (Knopf, $7.95).

There are many who think that
The New Yorker is the finest
magazine being published today.
To celebrate the magazine's 50th
birthday, readers have two major
books to choose from. Here at the
New Yorker (Random House,
$12.95) is critic Brendan Gill's
combination history and tribute
to the magazine, while Burton
Bernstein's Thurber: A Biography
(Dodd Mead, $15) examines the
real life and hard times of the
humorist-cartoonist, one of The
New Yorker's most famous
contributors.
* * *
Certain to provoke a new
round of controversy is We Are
Your Sons (Houghton Mifflin,
$10) by Michael and Robert
Meeropol, the children of Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg, who were
executed for supposedly passing
U.S. atomic secrets to Russia. The
new volume comes on the heels of
recent books by Louis Nizer (The
Implosion Conspiracy) and
Rosenberg co-defendant Martin
Sobell (On Doing Time).

And finally, one more Stanford
person making literary news is
David Kennedy, historian and
bane of many an undergraduate's
existence. The Nation magazine
recently published an article by
Kennedy excerpted from a
forthcoming book.
