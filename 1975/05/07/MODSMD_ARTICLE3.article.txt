Watergate was arguably the
most significant event in modern
American political history. It can
be contended that World War II
with its concommitant growth in
America's global power, or
Vietnam with its lesson of the
limits of that power, were even
more important. But the fact is
that Watergate not only toppled a
presidency in mid-stream, but also
generated subtle shock waves that
will be felt around the nation and
around the world for years to
come.
It's still too early to assess the
effects of those shock waves,
although some instant historians
a!readv trvin? R ,|f it isn't too
early to begin probing into the
backgrounds, attitudes and
philosophies of the men who
created Watergate or allowed it to
happen.
When David Halbcrstam
applied this "men who made the
event" approach to Vietnam, he
came up with the brilliant The

Best and the Brightest. Neither of
these two books on the
pre-Watergate Nixon White House
approach Halberstam's effort in
clarity or perception. But both
have enough to make them
worthy of attention.
Rather and Safire, while
covering much of the same
ground, do so with widely
differing approaches. This might
be expected from their
backgrounds. As CBS News White
House correspondent, Rather
gained a national reputation for
incisive reporting on presidential
activities — and made the White
House enemies list for it.
Safire, on the other hand, is a
former p.r. man who became one
of Nixon's top speechwriters (he
was the "house moderate"), and is
now the "house conservative"
columnist for the New York
T'mes.
For Safire — and sometimes for
the reader as well — the task of
compiling the "inside record" of
the Nixon Administration before
Watergate is made painful by the
knowledge of what followed.
Before the Fall is intended to
be many things. But first and
foremost, it is an exhaustive (704

pages) chronicle of the Nixon
presidency through March of
1973, when Safire left the White
House (and, coincidentally, James
McCord's letter to Judge Sirica
began to unravel the Watergate
cover-up).
To help illustrate his account,
Safire relies upon large handfuls
of private memos to and from the
President (often quoted at
interminable length); doodles
from staff meetings (most
intriguing: Elliot Richardson's and
John Ehrlichman's); and
conversations reconstructed from
the author's copious notes.
The result of all this is an often
wordy, often repetitive, but
somehow fascinating glimpse at
men so sure of themselves, so
supremely confident in what they
were doing, that they lost all
moral bearings.
Safire himself is still not
entirely free of the same
mentality, although he says that
the later revelation that his own
telephone was tapped helped
enlighten him about the White
House "excesses."
To Safire, Nixon was a mixture
of good and bad, and his
presidency a continual struggle
between Nixon's good side and
bad side.
The good side acted with
"courage" in mining Haiphong
and bombing Hanoi, invading
Cambodia, traveling to Peking and
establishing detente with Russia.
The bad side was manifested in
suspicion of aides, readiness to
trample individual rights in the
name of "national security" and
(in what is easily the best chapter
in the book), Nixon's almost
maniacal hatred of the press.
The book is equally fascinating
for the peek it gives of the men
around Nixon. There is Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, the
Kennedy-Johnson aide who
became domestic counselor and a
shooting star in the first Nixon
term; prickly, dignified Arthur

Burns, a Nixon confidant of
earlier days quickly eclipsed and
shunted off to the Federal
Reserve Board; press secretary
Ron Ziegler, often unfairly
maligned; and Treasury Secretary
John Connally, a man who, much
as did Moynihan, fascinated
Nixon in some strange and
mysterious way.
But most of all, there is the
"Berlin Wall," H.R. Haldeman and
John Ehrlichman. Between them,
these two wielded as much power
as any non-elected officials ever
have. And yet, they emerge from
Rather's book as well as Safire's as
remarkably unremarkable, save
for their ability to cater to their
boss's craving for privacy and
organization.
Unlike Safire, Rather makes no
effort at trying to explain or
explore the intricate workings of

policy formation in the White
House. Instead, The Palace Guard
is more like a guided tour through
the corridors of power.
Lighter in weight — by several
hundred pages - and far breezier,
The Palace Guard is more like a
scorecard than a chronicle.
Obviously, many of the same
personalities who dominate Before
the Fall are prominent here as
well. Perhaps surprisingly, many
perceptions are similar: Moynihan
emerges from both books as one
of the "good guys"; Haldeman,
the martinet; Ehrlichman,
sometimes officious but
well-meaning; Henry Kissinger,
the charming professor, yet skilled
bureaucratic infighter.
But unlike Safire, Rather and
Gates make no pretense of writing
history, or of trying to pass

judgment on the accomplishments
of the Nixon era. Where Before
the Fall sometimes takes on the
air of an apologia, The Palace
Guard doesn't make excuses.
Where Safire is sometimes
overawed by the presidential
mystique, Rather and Gates treat
the White House with a healthy
irreverence.
If The Palace Guard has a flaw,
it's that it is sometimes too slick,
bordering on the glib and
superficial. The same aspects that
make it so readable — the
generous application of anecdote
to illustrate major themes - also
prevents the reader from too deep
an exploration of the personalities
involved.
For example, we know from
Rather and Gates that Pat
Moynihan fascinated the
President, that he led the battle
for a welfare reform program that
went well beyond many liberal

Democratic proposals, and that he
was eventually — and, in the view
of the authors, unfairly — tarred
with the now-famous "benign
neglect" memo.
But what we don't get from
The Palace Guard is the basic
"why" of the matter: why a
liberal Democrat would be
working for a conservative
Republican president in the first
place. We're told that Nixon and
Moynihan seemed to fascinate
each other but the reason for that
remains basically unstated.
All told, The Palace Guard and
Before the Fall complement each
other fairly well: the former
succeeds by readability, the latter
by comprehensiveness. But it
remains for someone else to
combine the two elements, and
come up with the definitive story
of the pre-Watergate Nixon
Administration.
