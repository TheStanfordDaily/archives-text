The search for "self-identity," the ongoing and
(ah, yes) painful journey toward self-awareness, is a
theme which, in the last decade, has been used and
abused, discussed and over-discussed. It is an idea
so loaded with cliches and hackneyed terminology
that any writer dealing with it now must be highly
original and, above all, subtle.
Al Young, in his novel, Who Is Angelina?, is
neither.
As the title announces, the story concerns a
young black woman's quest for herself and, of
course, the meaning of life. From the freaky
sex-and-dope world of Berkeley through Mexican
adventure to her father's Michigan home, Angelina
criscrosses the continent, all the while asking
herself soul-searching questions.
Few of them are answered, but Angelina
occasionally makes some profound observation like
"Life is simple. Life is hard. Life is simply hard."
She meets a tall-dark-and-handsome stranger
called Watusi and muses about love and sex ("She
wanted it to mean something"). She visits
childhood friends in Michigan and reminisces

endlessly about her youth ("What happy times
she'd remembered from those days!"). She even
discovers transcendental meditation "to get back in
touch with her natural untampered body rhythms
and see the world with a clear head."
A far from unusual plot line, to be sure, but a
skilled writer might be able to pull it off with a
little finesse. Young doesn't quite succeed.
He does show occasional flashes of genius in
some of his characterizations through dialogue.
Capturing a variety of distinctive speech rhythms,
he uses dialect in a surprisingly natural way. But
unfortunately, Young all too often neglects the
events themselves.
Not only is the action burdened with Angelina's
cliched thoughts, but it also has no real focus. As
directionless as its heroine, the book wanders from
one anti-climax to another, introducing scores of
characters who might entertain but have no
important function.
Moreover, Young, who is black, cannot resist
commenting on the sad state of affairs in America.
Using his characters as mouthpieces, he preaches
endlessly — and tediously — about crime, drugs,
hippies, the black militant, the middle-class white,
religion . . . you name it.
While this commentary seriously detracts from
the novel by diverting the action, it does enhance
the book's interest from an historical standpoint.
Young's moderate stance on politics and social
behavior marks the emergence in literature of a
black consciousness profoundly different from that
of the '60s.
Young is no Eldridge Cleaver or Malcolm X,
whose writings fairly explode with the passion of
their deep-seated frustration. Instead, he replaces
emotionalism with reason and speaks with hope
rather than despair.
The characters are presented first as human
beings rather than blacks or whites. The author
even pokes fun at those people — whether
Afro-American revolutionaries or reactionary
rednecks — who insist on the importance of the
color distinction.
Of purely regional interest is the book's familiar
Bay Area setting. Young, who taught writing and
literature classes here at Stanford last year, shows
an inside knowledge of Berkeley coffee houses, San
Francisco hot spots, and hip college parties.
The question posed by the book's title, however,
never really gets answered. But then, does Al
Young really care who Angelina is? For that
matter, after reading the book, do we?
