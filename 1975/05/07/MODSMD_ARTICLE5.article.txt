Reviewed by Jim Wascher
We'd.love to hear you speak your
mind
In plain and simple ways,
Call a spade a spade
Just like you did back in the days.
You would play the piano,
And then you'd walk a mile,
Speak of what was going down
With honesty and style.
"Harry Truman,"Chicago Vlllalbum
If you'd prefer to think of
Harry Truman in the idyllic terms
of Robert Lamm's song, then you
shouldn't read Meeting at
Potsdam.
The book goes a long way
towards debunking the favorable
press which the late president has
received recently.
As the Watergate
unpleasantness peaked last year,
Americans were caught up in an
incredible nostalgia craze
centering on Truman. For at least
a decade, they hadn't had a

president they felt they could
trust with the White House
silverware.
"Wc need someone like
Truman again," we said to one
another. "He may not have been
so great, but at least he was
honest." It was, therefore, no
accident that Gerald Ford hung a
portrait of Truman in the White
House before he even unpacked
his bags last August.
Charles Mee's lively account of
the Potsdam Conference shatters
more than a few notions about
the forthright manner in which
Truman explained his goals and
policies.
The book effectively
demonstrates that Truman and
Josef Stalin held the conference
for the express purpose of
beginning the Cold War - each
deciding upon the plan
independently, and each satisfied
by the results. Neither was at all
candid in public during or after
the conference about the
implications of what was decided.
In Mee's interpretation of
Potsdam, British Prime Ministers
Winston Churchill and Clement
Attlee did their best to drive a
wedge between the Americans and
the Russians, hoping to salvage
whatever they could from their
own Empire.
In his prologue to the book,
Mee notes: "Because Allied
harmony ended at Potsdam,
because the conference did not
ensure a generation of peace, it is
commonly considered a 'failure,'
and so a minor episode in
international diplomacy."
But the author spends the rest
of the book refuting that view. In
his well-supported opinion,
Truman and Stalin left Potsdam
having achieved their diplomatic
objectives — for them, at least, the
conference was a rousing success.
Mee is not your typical leftist
historian, bent upon proving that
the United States is the true

villain responsible for decades of
global misery.
Instead, the author presents a
flawlessly researched account of
the conference's public sessions,
those attended by the Big Three.
Then he goes beneath the surface
to reveal the motives and aims of
the three heads of state, "who
were intent upon increasing the
power of their countries and of
themselves."
For this inside information,
Mee relies upon the journals and
diaries of the high-level
participants in the Potsdam
Conference. His principal problem
was the inaccessibility of the
Russian viewpoint, his only major
Soviet source being a 1962
summary of Conversations With
Stalin, written by Yugoslav leader

Milovan Djilas.
Meeting at Potsdam portrays
Truman as a man who has firmly
taken hold of the office which he
had assumed unsteadily only three
months earlier. His private
knowledge of the first successful
testing of the atomic bomb
allowed Truman to adopt a cocky,
almost cavalier, attitude towards
his Russian adversaries, and even
towards his own aides.
According to Mee, the
President never formally informed
his American associates of his
intentions. Those who failed to
pick up the hints about his
post-war strategy quickly found
themselves ignored. Truman also
kept the American public in the
dark about his plans until it suited
his purpose to tell them.

No, Mee doesn't deal
charitably with Truman. Neither,
though, does he deal the
Missourian any cheap shots. As
nearly as I can tell, Mee gives the
reader as much as Dragnet's joe
Friday would expect from him:
"Just the facts."
The facts, however, arc
collected in a thoroughly
enjoyable narrative which never
seems to get bogged down in trivia
or confusing speculation.
Truman's reputation emerges
quite tarnished after Mee's
examination. The Chicago song
laments: "Harry, all we get is
lies." The book just goes to show
the more things change the more
they tend to remain the same.

INTO THE COLD-Neither U.S. President Harry Truman nor Soviet leader Josef Stalin were particularly
disturbed with the course of the Potsdam Conference that initiated the Cold War, writes Charles Mee.
Caught in the middle, British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and Clement Atlee did their best to
salvage some remnants of their Empire.

those attended by the Big Three.
Then he goes beneath the surface
to reveal the motives and aims of
the three heads of state, "who
were intent upon increasing the
power of their countries and of
themselves."
For this inside information,
Mee relies upon the journals and
diaries of the high-level
participants in the Potsdam
Conference. His principal problem
was the inaccessibility of the
Russian viewpoint, his only major
Soviet source being a 1962
summary of Conversations With
Stalin, written by Yugoslav leader

Milovan Djilas.
Meeting at Potsdam portrays
Truman as a man who has firmly
taken hold of the office which he
had assumed unsteadily only three
months earlier. His private
knowledge of the first successful
testing of the atomic bomb
allowed Truman to adopt a cocky,
almost cavalier, attitude towards
his Russian adversaries, and even
towards his own aides.
According to Mee, the
President never formally informed
his American associates of his
intentions. Those who failed to
pick up the hints about his
post-war strategy quickly found
themselves ignored. Truman also
kept the American public in the
dark about his plans until it suited
his purpose to tell them.

No, Mee doesn't deal
charitably with Truman. Neither,
though, does he deal the
Missourian any cheap shots. As
nearly as I can tell, Mee gives the
reader as much as Dragnet's joe
Friday would expect from him:
"Just the facts."
The facts, however, arc
collected in a thoroughly
enjoyable narrative which never
seems to get bogged down in trivia
or confusing speculation.
Truman's reputation emerges
quite tarnished after Mee's
examination. The Chicago song
laments: "Harry, all we get is
lies." The book just goes to show
the more things change the more
they tend to remain the same.

INTO THE COLD-Neither U.S. President Harry Truman nor Soviet leader Josef Stalin were particularly
disturbed with the course of the Potsdam Conference that initiated the Cold War, writes Charles Mee.
Caught in the middle, British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and Clement Atlee did their best to
salvage some remnants of their Empire.

We'd.love to hear you speak your
mind
In plain and simple ways,
Call a spade a spade
Just like you did back in the days.
You would play the piano,
And then you'd walk a mile,
Speak of what was going down
With honesty and style.
"Harry Truman,"Chicago Vlllalbum
If you'd prefer to think of
Harry Truman in the idyllic terms
of Robert Lamm's song, then you
shouldn't read Meeting at
Potsdam.
The book goes a long way
towards debunking the favorable
press which the late president has
received recently.
As the Watergate
unpleasantness peaked last year,
Americans were caught up in an
incredible nostalgia craze
centering on Truman. For at least
a decade, they hadn't had a

president they felt they could
trust with the White House
silverware.
"Wc need someone like
Truman again," we said to one
another. "He may not have been
so great, but at least he was
honest." It was, therefore, no
accident that Gerald Ford hung a
portrait of Truman in the White
House before he even unpacked
his bags last August.
Charles Mee's lively account of
the Potsdam Conference shatters
more than a few notions about
the forthright manner in which
Truman explained his goals and
policies.
The book effectively
demonstrates that Truman and
Josef Stalin held the conference
for the express purpose of
beginning the Cold War - each
deciding upon the plan
independently, and each satisfied
by the results. Neither was at all
candid in public during or after
the conference about the
implications of what was decided.
In Mee's interpretation of
Potsdam, British Prime Ministers
Winston Churchill and Clement
Attlee did their best to drive a
wedge between the Americans and
the Russians, hoping to salvage
whatever they could from their
own Empire.
In his prologue to the book,
Mee notes: "Because Allied
harmony ended at Potsdam,
because the conference did not
ensure a generation of peace, it is
commonly considered a 'failure,'
and so a minor episode in
international diplomacy."
But the author spends the rest
of the book refuting that view. In
his well-supported opinion,
Truman and Stalin left Potsdam
having achieved their diplomatic
objectives — for them, at least, the
conference was a rousing success.
Mee is not your typical leftist
historian, bent upon proving that
the United States is the true

villain responsible for decades of
global misery.

of Robert Lamm's song, then you
shouldn't read Meeting at
Potsdam.
The book goes a long way
towards debunking the favorable
press which the late president has
received recently.
As the Watergate
unpleasantness peaked last year,
Americans were caught up in an
incredible nostalgia craze
centering on Truman. For at least
a decade, they hadn't had a

president they felt they could
trust with the White House
silverware.
"Wc need someone like
Truman again," we said to one
another. "He may not have been
so great, but at least he was
honest." It was, therefore, no
accident that Gerald Ford hung a
portrait of Truman in the White
House before he even unpacked
his bags last August.
Charles Mee's lively account of
the Potsdam Conference shatters
more than a few notions about
the forthright manner in which
Truman explained his goals and
policies.
The book effectively
demonstrates that Truman and
Josef Stalin held the conference
for the express purpose of
beginning the Cold War - each
deciding upon the plan
independently, and each satisfied
by the results. Neither was at all
candid in public during or after
the conference about the
implications of what was decided.
In Mee's interpretation of
Potsdam, British Prime Ministers
Winston Churchill and Clement
Attlee did their best to drive a
wedge between the Americans and
the Russians, hoping to salvage
whatever they could from their
own Empire.
In his prologue to the book,
Mee notes: "Because Allied
harmony ended at Potsdam,
because the conference did not
ensure a generation of peace, it is
commonly considered a 'failure,'
and so a minor episode in
international diplomacy."
But the author spends the rest
of the book refuting that view. In
his well-supported opinion,
Truman and Stalin left Potsdam
having achieved their diplomatic
objectives — for them, at least, the
conference was a rousing success.
Mee is not your typical leftist
historian, bent upon proving that
the United States is the true

villain responsible for decades of
global misery.
Instead, the author presents a
flawlessly researched account of
the conference's public sessions,
those attended by the Big Three.
Then he goes beneath the surface
to reveal the motives and aims of
the three heads of state, "who
were intent upon increasing the
power of their countries and of
themselves."
For this inside information,
Mee relies upon the journals and
diaries of the high-level
participants in the Potsdam
Conference. His principal problem
was the inaccessibility of the
Russian viewpoint, his only major
Soviet source being a 1962
summary of Conversations With
Stalin, written by Yugoslav leader

Milovan Djilas.
Meeting at Potsdam portrays
Truman as a man who has firmly
taken hold of the office which he
had assumed unsteadily only three
months earlier. His private
knowledge of the first successful
testing of the atomic bomb
allowed Truman to adopt a cocky,
almost cavalier, attitude towards
his Russian adversaries, and even
towards his own aides.
According to Mee, the
President never formally informed
his American associates of his
intentions. Those who failed to
pick up the hints about his
post-war strategy quickly found
themselves ignored. Truman also
kept the American public in the
dark about his plans until it suited
his purpose to tell them.

No, Mee doesn't deal
charitably with Truman. Neither,
though, does he deal the
Missourian any cheap shots. As
nearly as I can tell, Mee gives the
reader as much as Dragnet's joe
Friday would expect from him:
"Just the facts."
The facts, however, arc
collected in a thoroughly
enjoyable narrative which never
seems to get bogged down in trivia
or confusing speculation.
Truman's reputation emerges
quite tarnished after Mee's
examination. The Chicago song
laments: "Harry, all we get is
lies." The book just goes to show
the more things change the more
they tend to remain the same.

INTO THE COLD-Neither U.S. President Harry Truman nor Soviet leader Josef Stalin were particularly
disturbed with the course of the Potsdam Conference that initiated the Cold War, writes Charles Mee.
Caught in the middle, British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and Clement Atlee did their best to
salvage some remnants of their Empire.
