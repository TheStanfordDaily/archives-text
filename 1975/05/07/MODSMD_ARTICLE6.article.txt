The paperback trade has
always been disdained by the
so-called "serious" (i.e.,
hardcover) publishers. But the
fact is that paperback is no longer
the little brother. Paperback
allows hardcover bestsellers (that
means sales in the thousands) to
reach the masses at much cheaper
prices (that means sales in the
millions). Paperback sales now
often determine whether or not a
books is financially successful; it's
no coincidence that the purchaser
of Richard Nixon's memoirs is not
a hardcover house, but Warner
Paperback Library.
This month, one paperback
house has two of last year's
biggest hardcover bestsellers in
release. The house is Avon, and
the books are Watership Down,
Richard Adams's novel of a rabbit
civilization, and Alive! by Piers
Paul Read, the story of the
survivors of an Andes plane crash.

Paperbacks seem to thrive on
movie tie-ins, and two that are
already on the racks and selling
well stand to benefit even more
from forthcoming film versions.
One is Jaws, Peter Bcnchley's
great fish story (Bantam). The
movie, due shortly, will star
Richard Dreyfuss, and will
apparently be quite different than
the novel. (By the end of the
book, most readers seem to be
rooting for the shark.)
The other forthcoming film is
based on Max Ehrlich's The
Reincarnation of Peter Proud
(Bantam). The movie, just
released, stars Michael Sarrazin.
* * *
Also recently released in paper
is Kissinger, by Marvin and
Bernard Kalb (Dell). The authors,
both CBS-TV newsmen, write
beautifully, and the book is both
a fast read and a fascinating one.
Their problem, though, is that
they seem to have gotten a little
too close to their topic. Kissinger
himself is obviously the source for
much of the information in the
book, and try as the reporters
might, they can't quite keep a
certain admiration for the man
from coloring the work.
Needless to say — particularly
in light of his recent failures in the
Middle East and Indochina — it's
just too soon for us to pass
judgment on Flenry Alfred
Kissinger. Nonetheless, the Kalbs
provide a highly readable portait
of the man in the process of
making history.
* * *
Speaking of movies from
currcnt paperbacks, as we were a
while ago, two flicks are still in
preliminary stages, both based on
new Bantam releases. Widow, by
Lynn Caine, will be turned into a
made-for-television movie for
broadcast during the 1975-76
season, while Irving Wallace's The
Fan Club will be produced for
theatrical release. The latter, in

which Racquel Welch may star, is
about a sexy Hollywood film
queen who's, kidnaped by a gang
of middle-aged men, who then
proceed to act out their wildest
fantasies (at least, that's how the
New York Times described it).
* * *
Just issued by Fawcett is Art
Buchwald's latest book. The
volume contains much of the
satirist's best work from the
Watergate-impeachment months,
and the title sets the tone for
what follows. It's called "I Am
Not a Crook."
* * *
In the so-called "trade"
paperback market — as opposed
to the "mass market" books you
find in a supermarket — three
books are especially worth noting.
They are The Joy of Sex (Simon
& Schuster, $5.95), Alex
Comfort's "gourmet guide to
lovemaking"; The Best of Life
(Avon, $7.95), classic photos
from the magazine of the same
name; and The Art of Walt Disney
(New American Library, $7.95),
by Christopher Finch. The latter
two are paperback editions of two
highly expensive, quite successful
"coffee table" books.

fact is that paperback is no longer
the little brother. Paperback
allows hardcover bestsellers (that
means sales in the thousands) to
reach the masses at much cheaper
prices (that means sales in the
millions). Paperback sales now
often determine whether or not a
books is financially successful; it's
no coincidence that the purchaser
of Richard Nixon's memoirs is not
a hardcover house, but Warner
Paperback Library.
This month, one paperback
house has two of last year's
biggest hardcover bestsellers in
release. The house is Avon, and
the books are Watership Down,
Richard Adams's novel of a rabbit
civilization, and Alive! by Piers
Paul Read, the story of the
survivors of an Andes plane crash.

Paperbacks seem to thrive on
movie tie-ins, and two that are
already on the racks and selling
well stand to benefit even more
from forthcoming film versions.
One is Jaws, Peter Bcnchley's
great fish story (Bantam). The
movie, due shortly, will star
Richard Dreyfuss, and will
apparently be quite different than
the novel. (By the end of the
book, most readers seem to be
rooting for the shark.)
The other forthcoming film is
based on Max Ehrlich's The
Reincarnation of Peter Proud
(Bantam). The movie, just
released, stars Michael Sarrazin.
* * *
Also recently released in paper
is Kissinger, by Marvin and
Bernard Kalb (Dell). The authors,
both CBS-TV newsmen, write
beautifully, and the book is both
a fast read and a fascinating one.
Their problem, though, is that
they seem to have gotten a little
too close to their topic. Kissinger
himself is obviously the source for
much of the information in the
book, and try as the reporters
might, they can't quite keep a
certain admiration for the man
from coloring the work.
Needless to say — particularly
in light of his recent failures in the
Middle East and Indochina — it's
just too soon for us to pass
judgment on Flenry Alfred
Kissinger. Nonetheless, the Kalbs
provide a highly readable portait
of the man in the process of
making history.

Speaking of movies from
currcnt paperbacks, as we were a
while ago, two flicks are still in
preliminary stages, both based on
new Bantam releases. Widow, by
Lynn Caine, will be turned into a
made-for-television movie for
broadcast during the 1975-76
season, while Irving Wallace's The
Fan Club will be produced for
theatrical release. The latter, in

which Racquel Welch may star, is
about a sexy Hollywood film
queen who's, kidnaped by a gang
of middle-aged men, who then
proceed to act out their wildest
fantasies (at least, that's how the
New York Times described it).
* * *
Just issued by Fawcett is Art
Buchwald's latest book. The
volume contains much of the
satirist's best work from the
Watergate-impeachment months,
and the title sets the tone for
what follows. It's called "I Am
Not a Crook."

In the so-called "trade"
paperback market — as opposed
to the "mass market" books you
find in a supermarket — three
books are especially worth noting.
They are The Joy of Sex (Simon
& Schuster, $5.95), Alex
Comfort's "gourmet guide to
lovemaking"; The Best of Life
(Avon, $7.95), classic photos
from the magazine of the same
name; and The Art of Walt Disney
(New American Library, $7.95),
by Christopher Finch. The latter
two are paperback editions of two
highly expensive, quite successful
"coffee table" books.
