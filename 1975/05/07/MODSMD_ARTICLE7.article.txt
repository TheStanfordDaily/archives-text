The American Food Scandal: Why You Can't Eat
Well On What You Earn, by William Robbins.

Do you worry about what you eat? Do you diet
to lose weight or to get in better shape? Are you a
vegetarian or considered a "picky eater" because
you care about your body and realize that most
food is adulterated? What dictates nutritional
standards and the cost of food?
The American Food Scandal covers a great deal
of ground, from"The Land Syndicates: And The
Rich Get Richer," to "The Laboratory Invasion."
In a chapter called "Golden Grain: The Russian
Wheat Deals," there is full coverage of the
American agri-business - Russian wheat and corn
negotiations. Robbins quotes an unpublished
official study: "Two visits by a Russian trading
team to the United States in the summer of '12
have cost American shoppers more than $3 billion a
year."
Throughout the book, Robbins contends that
corporations, not the government, controls
American food policy. He contends that
government agencies such as the Food and Drug
Administration have a "strange laxity" regarding
enforcement of health standards. He quotes Sen.
Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn.): "Substances
classified as suspect carcinogens are allowed to
remain in the food supply until there is absolute
proof they do cause cancer."
Why this disregard of our health? Why are our
pockctbooks abused for eating? The conclusion
drawn from Robbins's story is that maximizing
profits is the main focus; concern for consumer

welfare is not a high priority, if it is a priority at all.
Agri-business is the essence of impure
competition: nearly all foods come from huge
industries that have the market cornered on an item
and get higher prices and profits off of the
consumer. Under capitalism the consumer benefits
only when there is pure competition. As Fred
Harris, a former senator from Oklahoma, says,
"Agri-business giants and huge food companies . . .
are not more efficient at farming and processing;
they're more efficient at farming us, the taxpayers
and consumers."
William Robbins, once a North Carolina
farmboy, is now in Washington, D.C. specializing in
agriculture as a reporter and editor for the New
York Times. His book often reads like a
newspaper: shocking news on every page. I suggest
reading Robbins's book if you worry about your
own health and the politics of food, and drawing
your own conclusions.
Robbins writes, "While the nation's small towns
and rural villages wither, tax-paid agricultural
researchers work on systems that will help
agri-business sweep away the remaining rural
families and'turn the countryside into vast factories
in the fields.
"While ecologists worry about the environment,
the researchers ... focus on ever more deadly
pesticides. They breed vegetables for survival in
mechanical harvesters rather than for taste and
food value. And they develop hormones to
promote livestock profits with no recorded advance
research into attributes that might be harmful to
health."
That is the American Food Scandal.

agri-business sweep away the remaining rural
families and'turn the countryside into vast factories
in the fields.
"While ecologists worry about the environment,
the researchers ... focus on ever more deadly
pesticides. They breed vegetables for survival in
mechanical harvesters rather than for taste and
food value. And they develop hormones to
promote livestock profits with no recorded advance
research into attributes that might be harmful to
health."
That is the American Food Scandal.
The American Food Scandal: Why You Can't Eat
Well On What You Earn, by William Robbins.

Do you worry about what you eat? Do you diet
to lose weight or to get in better shape? Are you a
vegetarian or considered a "picky eater" because
you care about your body and realize that most
food is adulterated? What dictates nutritional
standards and the cost of food?
The American Food Scandal covers a great deal
of ground, from"The Land Syndicates: And The
Rich Get Richer," to "The Laboratory Invasion."
In a chapter called "Golden Grain: The Russian
Wheat Deals," there is full coverage of the
American agri-business - Russian wheat and corn
negotiations. Robbins quotes an unpublished
official study: "Two visits by a Russian trading
team to the United States in the summer of '12
have cost American shoppers more than $3 billion a
year."
Throughout the book, Robbins contends that
corporations, not the government, controls
American food policy. He contends that
government agencies such as the Food and Drug
Administration have a "strange laxity" regarding
enforcement of health standards. He quotes Sen.
Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn.): "Substances
classified as suspect carcinogens are allowed to
remain in the food supply until there is absolute
proof they do cause cancer."
Why this disregard of our health? Why are our
pockctbooks abused for eating? The conclusion
drawn from Robbins's story is that maximizing
profits is the main focus; concern for consumer

welfare is not a high priority, if it is a priority at all.
Agri-business is the essence of impure
competition: nearly all foods come from huge
industries that have the market cornered on an item
and get higher prices and profits off of the
consumer. Under capitalism the consumer benefits
only when there is pure competition. As Fred
Harris, a former senator from Oklahoma, says,
"Agri-business giants and huge food companies . . .
are not more efficient at farming and processing;
they're more efficient at farming us, the taxpayers
and consumers."
William Robbins, once a North Carolina
farmboy, is now in Washington, D.C. specializing in
agriculture as a reporter and editor for the New
York Times. His book often reads like a
newspaper: shocking news on every page. I suggest
reading Robbins's book if you worry about your
own health and the politics of food, and drawing
your own conclusions.
Robbins writes, "While the nation's small towns
and rural villages wither, tax-paid agricultural
researchers work on systems that will help
agri-business sweep away the remaining rural
families and'turn the countryside into vast factories
in the fields.
