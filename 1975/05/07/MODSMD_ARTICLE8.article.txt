Free Life Editions has brought
out in inexpensive paperback
editions two classics of "Old
Right" thought. The intellectual
leaders of the "Old Right"
opposed FDR's New Deal as a
threat to civil liberties, the free
market and isolationist foreign
policy.
The "Old Right" is to be
distinguished from the "New
Right" led by William Buckley's
National Review. The Buckleyite
Right has called for the
anti-isolationist policy of total
war against communist countries
with American civil liberties and
the market being supressed for the
duration.
In Our Enemy the State, Nock
takes the "conquest theory" of
the origins of the state - as found
in the writings of sociologist
Franz Oppenheimer - and applies
the theory to the United States
using material from historian
Charles Beard to show that the
American government was
imposed by an elite.
Nock's prose is a delight to
read. He was a writer of the old
school who believed in writing in
English, not sociological jargon.
This edition contains a valuable
bibliographic essay by Walter
Grinder on the Nockian tradition
of political analysis.
Flynn's As We Go Marching is
an early description of the
corporate liberalism denounced
by the New Left in the 19605.
Writing in 1943, Flynn saw how
the social welfare programs,
conscription, imperialism abroad,
transformation of industries into
regulated cartels and curtailment

of civil liberties, all fit together to
form the political system of the
corporate state. Despite the social
democratic rhetoric of the New
Deal the New Deal system was in
essence the same as the system in
Germany and Italy at that time.
The logical outcome of the
New Deal policies has been the
Vietnam War and the Watergate
scandal — both products of an
increasingly powerful corporate
state.
The communists' claim in the
pre-Popular Front period that the
social democrats were social
fascists seemed exaggerated to
some at the time and since, but
the subsequent history of the
corporate state in America and
Western Europe seems to have
borne out many of the insights of
both these communists'and "Old
Right" critics like Flynn.
The Flynn book has a new
preface by radical historian
Ronald Radosh, whose book on
isolationist critics of American
imperialism has just been
published.

,The Vietnam War, which
seared the nation's conscience for
more than a decade, has. also
shattered many of the benign
assumptions Americans have held
about previous foreign policy
ventures.
These books, the work of a
new generation of Asia scholars
for whom Vietnam was a
formative experience, examine
anew the recent history and
politics of Korea and question

many of the beliefs that underlie
the judgment that the United
States' intervention there was one
of our finest hours.
Discarding the common
assumption that the communist
world in 1950 was a monolithic
bloc, Robert Simmons explores
the often uneasy Moscow-Peking
P'yongyang alliance and its impact
upon the origins and conduct of
the Korean War.
To those familiar only with the
official American version of the
war, his conclusions will appear
novel: that Kim 11-sung's rise to
power in North Korea was as
much the result of his own
leadership ability as any Soviet
flat, that the Soviet Union in
1950 attempted to keep the
People's Republic of China out of
the United Nations and that the
North Koreans themselves were
responsible for both the initiation
and timing of the attack on the
South.
Though many of his findings
are speculative and subject to
debate, Simmons has provided a
valuable service by critically
re-examining problems that Cold
War orthodoxy had declared
closed.
The Baldwin volume, a
collection of seven essays which
deal with such topics as Korea's
peasantry, economy and
relationship to the United States,
carries further the task of
challenging the wisdom and
beneficence of America's role in
Korea since World War 11.
Perhaps the most effective of
the essays is Bruce Cumings's
sensitive account of the American
occupation of Korea in 1945 and
1946. He shows how the United
States, in its zeal to confront the
Soviets and combat communism,
thwarted Korea's aspirations for
independence and crushed Korean
efforts to establish a popular
government which would repair
the damage done by years of
Japanese domination.

Public schools:
boon or prison?
The Twelve-Year Sentence, edited
by William F. Rickenbacker. Open
Court, $6.95.
In the 1960s the realities of
high truancy rates and urban
school failure combined with the
writings of Paul Goodman, John
Holt, Ivan lllich and Edgar Z.
Friedenberg to call into question
the received wisdom that
compulsory school attendance
was a blessing for the young and a
proper symbol of progress for
society.
This new volume reprints the
scholarly papers given at an
educational symposium on
compulsory schooling and has the
additional attribute of providing
an extensive, annotated
bibliography on the topic.
Radical educational historian
Joel P. Spring notes that
"schooling must be viewed as a
tool by which the state solidifies

its power and creates a
citizenry . . . School
ing... becomcs an instrument of
power for a ruling elite to
maintain and enhance their power
over the social system."
Educational researcher George
Resch discusses the ways in which
compulsory education and
government-run schools are in
conflict with natural human
variety and diversity.
Economic historian Murray
Rothbard finds the roots of
compulsory attendance laws in
Reformation efforts by Lutherans
and Calvinists to impose their
views. Calvinist New England
became the American stronghold
of compulsory education, with
the new goals of instilling loyalty
to the government
("citizenship"), fostering labor
discipline, and controlling
immigrants easily being added to
the old goal of thought-control.
Other contributors discuss the
constitutional and legal
background of truancy laws.

Two classics of

Our Enemy the State, by Albert
Jay Nock. Free Life Editions,
$2.95.
As We Go Marching, by John T.
Flynn. Free Life Editions, $3.45.
Reviewed by Bill Evers
Free Life Editions has brought
out in inexpensive paperback
editions two classics of "Old
Right" thought. The intellectual
leaders of the "Old Right"
opposed FDR's New Deal as a
threat to civil liberties, the free
market and isolationist foreign
policy.
The "Old Right" is to be
distinguished from the "New
Right" led by William Buckley's
National Review. The Buckleyite
Right has called for the
anti-isolationist policy of total
war against communist countries
with American civil liberties and
the market being supressed for the
duration.
In Our Enemy the State, Nock
takes the "conquest theory" of
the origins of the state - as found
in the writings of sociologist
Franz Oppenheimer - and applies
the theory to the United States
using material from historian
Charles Beard to show that the
American government was
imposed by an elite.
Nock's prose is a delight to
read. He was a writer of the old
school who believed in writing in
English, not sociological jargon.
This edition contains a valuable
bibliographic essay by Walter
Grinder on the Nockian tradition
of political analysis.
Flynn's As We Go Marching is
an early description of the
corporate liberalism denounced
by the New Left in the 19605.
Writing in 1943, Flynn saw how
the social welfare programs,
conscription, imperialism abroad,
transformation of industries into
regulated cartels and curtailment

of civil liberties, all fit together to
form the political system of the
corporate state. Despite the social
democratic rhetoric of the New
Deal the New Deal system was in
essence the same as the system in
Germany and Italy at that time.
The logical outcome of the
New Deal policies has been the
Vietnam War and the Watergate
scandal — both products of an
increasingly powerful corporate
state.
The communists' claim in the
pre-Popular Front period that the
social democrats were social
fascists seemed exaggerated to
some at the time and since, but
the subsequent history of the
corporate state in America and
Western Europe seems to have
borne out many of the insights of
both these communists'and "Old
Right" critics like Flynn.
The Flynn book has a new
preface by radical historian
Ronald Radosh, whose book on
isolationist critics of American
imperialism has just been
published.

,The Vietnam War, which
seared the nation's conscience for
more than a decade, has. also
shattered many of the benign
assumptions Americans have held
about previous foreign policy
ventures.
These books, the work of a
new generation of Asia scholars
for whom Vietnam was a
formative experience, examine
anew the recent history and
politics of Korea and question

many of the beliefs that underlie
the judgment that the United
States' intervention there was one
of our finest hours.
Discarding the common
assumption that the communist
world in 1950 was a monolithic
bloc, Robert Simmons explores
the often uneasy Moscow-Peking
P'yongyang alliance and its impact
upon the origins and conduct of
the Korean War.
To those familiar only with the
official American version of the
war, his conclusions will appear
novel: that Kim 11-sung's rise to
power in North Korea was as
much the result of his own
leadership ability as any Soviet
flat, that the Soviet Union in
1950 attempted to keep the
People's Republic of China out of
the United Nations and that the
North Koreans themselves were
responsible for both the initiation
and timing of the attack on the
South.
Though many of his findings
are speculative and subject to
debate, Simmons has provided a
valuable service by critically
re-examining problems that Cold
War orthodoxy had declared
closed.
The Baldwin volume, a
collection of seven essays which
deal with such topics as Korea's
peasantry, economy and
relationship to the United States,
carries further the task of
challenging the wisdom and
beneficence of America's role in
Korea since World War 11.
Perhaps the most effective of
the essays is Bruce Cumings's
sensitive account of the American
occupation of Korea in 1945 and
1946. He shows how the United
States, in its zeal to confront the
Soviets and combat communism,
thwarted Korea's aspirations for
independence and crushed Korean
efforts to establish a popular
government which would repair
the damage done by years of
Japanese domination.

Two classics of
the Old Right'
Our Enemy the State, by Albert
Jay Nock. Free Life Editions,
$2.95.
As We Go Marching, by John T.
Flynn. Free Life Editions, $3.45.
Reviewed by Bill Evers
Free Life Editions has brought
out in inexpensive paperback
editions two classics of "Old
Right" thought. The intellectual
leaders of the "Old Right"
opposed FDR's New Deal as a
threat to civil liberties, the free
market and isolationist foreign
policy.
The "Old Right" is to be
distinguished from the "New
Right" led by William Buckley's
National Review. The Buckleyite
Right has called for the
anti-isolationist policy of total
war against communist countries
with American civil liberties and
the market being supressed for the
duration.
In Our Enemy the State, Nock
takes the "conquest theory" of
the origins of the state - as found
in the writings of sociologist
Franz Oppenheimer - and applies
the theory to the United States
using material from historian
Charles Beard to show that the
American government was
imposed by an elite.
Nock's prose is a delight to
read. He was a writer of the old
school who believed in writing in
English, not sociological jargon.
This edition contains a valuable
bibliographic essay by Walter
Grinder on the Nockian tradition
of political analysis.
Flynn's As We Go Marching is
an early description of the
corporate liberalism denounced
by the New Left in the 19605.
Writing in 1943, Flynn saw how
the social welfare programs,
conscription, imperialism abroad,
transformation of industries into
regulated cartels and curtailment

of civil liberties, all fit together to
form the political system of the
corporate state. Despite the social
democratic rhetoric of the New
Deal the New Deal system was in
essence the same as the system in
Germany and Italy at that time.
The logical outcome of the
New Deal policies has been the
Vietnam War and the Watergate
scandal — both products of an
increasingly powerful corporate
state.
The communists' claim in the
pre-Popular Front period that the
social democrats were social
fascists seemed exaggerated to
some at the time and since, but
the subsequent history of the
corporate state in America and
Western Europe seems to have
borne out many of the insights of
both these communists'and "Old
Right" critics like Flynn.
The Flynn book has a new
preface by radical historian
Ronald Radosh, whose book on
isolationist critics of American
imperialism has just been
published.
