Edmund Burke, edited by Isaac Kramnick. Prentice-Hall, $3.25.
Books in the Great Lives Observed scries are customarily about 200
pages, with one-third selections from the subject figure's own writings,
one-third contemporary evaluations and one-third modern acadcmic
scholarship.
This volume on the famous traditionalist-conservative Edmund
Burke omits any selections from his youthful anarchist work, The
Vindication of Natural Society, (1756). Political theorist Yehoshua
Arieli recently termed the often-neglected Vindication a "forerunner
of European anarchism."
Kramnick also omits Burke's indictment of Warren Hastings, the
British official in India whose impeachment and trial would be
subjects of interest to Watergate-era readers.
Kramnick docs include Burke's cloying praise of Marie Antoinette,
a piece of prose which exemplifies Burke's traditionalist loyalties. He
also includes an extract from Burke's Tract on the Popery Laws,
which shows the influence of the natural law tradition on Burke's
largely empiricist thought. But Kramnick does not include the
writings of any modern scholar (for instance, Peter j. Stanlis) who
emphasizes this aspect of Burke.
Most curious of all in this volume is the essay by C.B. Macpherson.
Macphcrson has a persistent habit of taking the most disparate
thinkers and making them out as actual defenders of liberal
capitalism. In this essay he argues that Burke, the traditionalist and
defender of the ancien regime, is fundamentally a defender of a
market-oriented society. Macphcrson considers Burke a more genuine
defender of the free market ideal than laissez-faire liberal Herbert
Spencer. g
