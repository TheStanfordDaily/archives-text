Sometimes it's nicc to be dif
ferent; to do or own some
thing that sets you apart from
the crowd. When this takes
the form of a special jewelry
accessory, it is equally nice to
know that the pleasure and
value will he a lasting joy to
you and generations to come.
We will be happy to create a
special design for you alone,
using cither new gems of your
choice, or those from your
present pieces. The cost may
be less than you think for
what can become your very
own "signature in gems" Stop
in soon and let us develop
a sketch or two for your
approval.
