# Von Hayek: Government On Principle
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
"Democracy will not survive, and
will not be a beneficial institution,
unless we find a way of making
democratic government also a form of
limited government," Nobel
Prize-winning economist Friedrich von
Hayek told an audience of 250 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night.
Ostensibly addressing a meeting of
the Stanford Conservative Forum on
the topic "Reflections on The Road to
Serfdom," a book he penned in 1944,
Hayek instead laid the groundwork for
a government which "rests on
principle, not the whim of the
majority."
The 1974 Nobel winner said he
now agreed with economist Joseph
Shumpeter's view of 30 years ago that
"socialism, though it could not fulfill
its promise, was bound to come
because of the inherent mechanism" in
present democracy.
He was "forced to criticize the
present kind of democratic system to
save democracy," Hayek claimed. The
economic ill-effects of modern
government intervention "are due to
the particular kind of democracy in
the Western world."
Hayek said he advocated separating
the legislative branch into two bodies:
"one assembly to run the [business
of] government and one to make laws
governing the conduct of the
individual."
Government Management
Under Western democratic
institutions, legislative bodies "have
always had both powers," Hayek said.
Thus legislatures "have given
themselves laws needed as government
[management] assemblies. The same
body that did what government had to
do could make laws for itself which
allowed it to do what it wished."
Legislatures thereby have
superceded the separation of powers
principle upon which the United
States was founded, Hayek claimed.

separation whereby one branch,
elected along party lines as the Senate
and House now are, would administer
the government. Party distinctions are

beneficial in providing a choice
between policies, Hayek said.
The second branch would consist of
non-partisan, middle-aged members
elected to 15-year non-renewable
terms. This body would pass laws
regulating conduct of individuals, and
would thus set parameters for actions
of the partisan body.
Requiring a minimum age of 40
for members of the upper body would
require them to establish reputations
in "ordinary life" before turning to
politics, Hayek asserted. Legislators
thus elected and not confronted with
any additional campaigns would
"represent not particular interests, but
states of [public] opinion over what is
right," he said.
'Wise Men' Senate
Such a group would form the basis
of a "senate of wise men of which the
liberal constitutionalists [such as John
Locke and the United States'
founders] dreamed but which never
came to pass."
A questioner later accused Hayek's
plan of setting up "an elected supreme
court," but the Austrian economist
said he would maintain an appointed
court above both legislative branches.
Hayek admitted to a "Utopian
scheme" but called it "tremendously
important to give hope of providing" a
democratic alternative to the "gradual
undermining of a free enterprise
economy" by the current government.
"Our present type of society is on
the downgrade," he claimed. "If we let
it collapse, the belief will be that a
society of free men was impossible to
attain.
"But our present system is failing
not because free society has failed, but

because we made mistakes in
organizing it."
Alternate Road
Panelists Robert McAfee Brown,
professor of religious studies, and
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
had prepared their responses to
Hayek's arranged topic and did not
comment on his legislative proposal.
Brown spoke of an "alternate road
to serfdom" for Third World countries
who see the United States "paving
their road to serfdom." He called the
U.S. "a giant with its foot on the back
of the human family and that. .. foot
is going to have to come off."
Although sensing he had been asked
to appear as a "card-carrying welfare
state liberal," Marshall said he had
"seen more and more merit to the
ideas of The Road to Selfdom."
He noted "a good deal of truth to
the thesis" that heavy government
involvement in the economy "leads
incrementally and inevitably to greater
control of citizens and eventually to
totalitarianism." Such was the claim of
Hayek's book.
Change In Progression
Hayek said, "I don't think I would
ever write that book again," citing a
change in the socialist progression he
forecast.
Instead of socialization of the
means of production, which he
pointed to 30 years ago as the
forerunner of fascism, the danger now
lies in "the use of monetary and fiscal
policy to bring about inflation which
disrupts the free market."
Inflation leads to a "misdirection of
labor" and subsequent unemployment,
and a clamor for wage and price
controls which leads to a "centrally
directed system," Hayek maintained.

thus elected and not confronted with
any additional campaigns would
"represent not particular interests, but
states of [public] opinion over what is
right," he said.
'Wise Men' Senate
Such a group would form the basis
of a "senate of wise men of which the
liberal constitutionalists [such as John
Locke and the United States'
founders] dreamed but which never
came to pass."
A questioner later accused Hayek's
plan of setting up "an elected supreme
court," but the Austrian economist
said he would maintain an appointed
court above both legislative branches.
Hayek admitted to a "Utopian
scheme" but called it "tremendously
important to give hope of providing" a
democratic alternative to the "gradual
undermining of a free enterprise
economy" by the current government.
"Our present type of society is on
the downgrade," he claimed. "If we let
it collapse, the belief will be that a
society of free men was impossible to
attain.
"But our present system is failing
not because free society has failed, but

because we made mistakes in
organizing it."
Alternate Road
Panelists Robert McAfee Brown,
professor of religious studies, and
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
had prepared their responses to
Hayek's arranged topic and did not
comment on his legislative proposal.
Brown spoke of an "alternate road
to serfdom" for Third World countries
who see the United States "paving
their road to serfdom." He called the
U.S. "a giant with its foot on the back
of the human family and that. .. foot
is going to have to come off."
Although sensing he had been asked
to appear as a "card-carrying welfare
state liberal," Marshall said he had
"seen more and more merit to the
ideas of The Road to Selfdom."
He noted "a good deal of truth to
the thesis" that heavy government
involvement in the economy "leads
incrementally and inevitably to greater
control of citizens and eventually to
totalitarianism." Such was the claim of
Hayek's book.
Change In Progression
Hayek said, "I don't think I would
ever write that book again," citing a
change in the socialist progression he
forecast.
Instead of socialization of the
means of production, which he
pointed to 30 years ago as the
forerunner of fascism, the danger now
lies in "the use of monetary and fiscal
policy to bring about inflation which
disrupts the free market."
Inflation leads to a "misdirection of
labor" and subsequent unemployment,
and a clamor for wage and price
controls which leads to a "centrally
directed system," Hayek maintained.
"Democracy will not survive, and
will not be a beneficial institution,
unless we find a way of making
democratic government also a form of
limited government," Nobel
Prize-winning economist Friedrich von
Hayek told an audience of 250 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night.
Ostensibly addressing a meeting of
the Stanford Conservative Forum on
the topic "Reflections on The Road to
Serfdom," a book he penned in 1944,
Hayek instead laid the groundwork for
a government which "rests on
principle, not the whim of the
majority."
The 1974 Nobel winner said he
now agreed with economist Joseph
Shumpeter's view of 30 years ago that
"socialism, though it could not fulfill
its promise, was bound to come
because of the inherent mechanism" in
present democracy.
He was "forced to criticize the
present kind of democratic system to
save democracy," Hayek claimed. The
economic ill-effects of modern
government intervention "are due to
the particular kind of democracy in
the Western world."
Hayek said he advocated separating
the legislative branch into two bodies:
"one assembly to run the [business
of] government and one to make laws
governing the conduct of the
individual."
Government Management
Under Western democratic
institutions, legislative bodies "have
always had both powers," Hayek said.
Thus legislatures "have given
themselves laws needed as government
[management] assemblies. The same
body that did what government had to
do could make laws for itself which
allowed it to do what it wished."
Legislatures thereby have
superceded the separation of powers
principle upon which the United
States was founded, Hayek claimed.
Hayek outlined a legislative
separation whereby one branch,
elected along party lines as the Senate
and House now are, would administer
the government. Party distinctions are

beneficial in providing a choice
between policies, Hayek said.
The second branch would consist of
non-partisan, middle-aged members
elected to 15-year non-renewable
terms. This body would pass laws
regulating conduct of individuals, and
would thus set parameters for actions
of the partisan body.
Requiring a minimum age of 40
for members of the upper body would
require them to establish reputations
in "ordinary life" before turning to
politics, Hayek asserted. Legislators
thus elected and not confronted with
any additional campaigns would
"represent not particular interests, but

policy to bring about inflation which
disrupts the free market."
Inflation leads to a "misdirection of
labor" and subsequent unemployment,
and a clamor for wage and price
controls which leads to a "centrally
directed system," Hayek maintained.
"Democracy will not survive, and
will not be a beneficial institution,
unless we find a way of making
democratic government also a form of
limited government," Nobel
Prize-winning economist Friedrich von
Hayek told an audience of 250 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night.
Ostensibly addressing a meeting of
the Stanford Conservative Forum on
the topic "Reflections on The Road to
Serfdom," a book he penned in 1944,
Hayek instead laid the groundwork for
a government which "rests on
principle, not the whim of the
majority."
The 1974 Nobel winner said he
now agreed with economist Joseph
Shumpeter's view of 30 years ago that
"socialism, though it could not fulfill
its promise, was bound to come
because of the inherent mechanism" in
present democracy.
He was "forced to criticize the
present kind of democratic system to
save democracy," Hayek claimed. The
economic ill-effects of modern
government intervention "are due to
the particular kind of democracy in
the Western world."
Hayek said he advocated separating
the legislative branch into two bodies:
"one assembly to run the [business
of] government and one to make laws
governing the conduct of the
individual."
Government Management
Under Western democratic
institutions, legislative bodies "have
always had both powers," Hayek said.
Thus legislatures "have given
themselves laws needed as government
[management] assemblies. The same
body that did what government had to
do could make laws for itself which
allowed it to do what it wished."
Legislatures thereby have
superceded the separation of powers
principle upon which the United
States was founded, Hayek claimed.
Hayek outlined a legislative
separation whereby one branch,
elected along party lines as the Senate
and House now are, would administer
the government. Party distinctions are

beneficial in providing a choice
between policies, Hayek said.
The second branch would consist of
non-partisan, middle-aged members
elected to 15-year non-renewable
terms. This body would pass laws
regulating conduct of individuals, and
would thus set parameters for actions
of the partisan body.
Requiring a minimum age of 40
for members of the upper body would
require them to establish reputations
in "ordinary life" before turning to
politics, Hayek asserted. Legislators
thus elected and not confronted with
any additional campaigns would
"represent not particular interests, but
states of [public] opinion over what is
right," he said.
'Wise Men' Senate
Such a group would form the basis
of a "senate of wise men of which the
liberal constitutionalists [such as John
Locke and the United States'
founders] dreamed but which never
came to pass."
A questioner later accused Hayek's
plan of setting up "an elected supreme
court," but the Austrian economist
said he would maintain an appointed
court above both legislative branches.
Hayek admitted to a "Utopian
scheme" but called it "tremendously
important to give hope of providing" a
democratic alternative to the "gradual
undermining of a free enterprise
economy" by the current government.
"Our present type of society is on
the downgrade," he claimed. "If we let
it collapse, the belief will be that a
society of free men was impossible to
attain.
"But our present system is failing
not because free society has failed, but

because we made mistakes in
organizing it."
Alternate Road
Panelists Robert McAfee Brown,
professor of religious studies, and
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
had prepared their responses to
Hayek's arranged topic and did not
comment on his legislative proposal.
Brown spoke of an "alternate road
to serfdom" for Third World countries
who see the United States "paving
their road to serfdom." He called the
U.S. "a giant with its foot on the back
of the human family and that. .. foot
is going to have to come off."
Although sensing he had been asked
to appear as a "card-carrying welfare
state liberal," Marshall said he had
"seen more and more merit to the
ideas of The Road to Selfdom."
He noted "a good deal of truth to
the thesis" that heavy government
involvement in the economy "leads
incrementally and inevitably to greater
control of citizens and eventually to
totalitarianism." Such was the claim of
Hayek's book.
Change In Progression
Hayek said, "I don't think I would
ever write that book again," citing a
change in the socialist progression he
forecast.
Instead of socialization of the
means of production, which he
pointed to 30 years ago as the
forerunner of fascism, the danger now
lies in "the use of monetary and fiscal
policy to bring about inflation which
disrupts the free market."
Inflation leads to a "misdirection of
labor" and subsequent unemployment,
and a clamor for wage and price
controls which leads to a "centrally
directed system," Hayek maintained.
