# Von Hayek: Government On Principle
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
"Democracy will not survive, and
will not be a beneficial institution,
unless we find a way of making
democratic government also a form of
limited government," Nobel
Prize-winning economist Friedrich von
Hayek told an audience of 250 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night.
Ostensibly addressing a meeting of
the Stanford Conservative Forum on
the topic "Reflections on The Road to
Serfdom," a book he penned in 1944,
Hayek instead laid the groundwork for
a government which "rests on
principle, not the whim of the
majority."
The 1974 Nobel winner said he
now agreed with economist Joseph
Shumpeter's view of 30 years ago that
"socialism, though it could not fulfill
its promise, was bound to come
because of the inherent mechanism" in
present democracy.
He was "forced to criticize the
present kind of democratic system to
save democracy," Hayek claimed. The
economic ill-effects of modern
government intervention "are due to
the particular kind of democracy in
the Western world."
Hayek said he advocated separating
the legislative branch into two bodies:
"one assembly to run the [business
of] government and one to make laws
governing the conduct of the
individual."
Government Management
Under Western democratic
institutions, legislative bodies "have
always had both powers," Hayek said.
Thus legislatures "have given
themselves laws needed as government
[management] assemblies. The same
body that did what government had to
do could make laws for itself which
allowed it to do what it wished."
Legislatures thereby have
superceded the separation of powers
principle upon which the United
States was founded, Hayek claimed.
Hayek outlined a legislative
separation whereby one branch,
elected along party lines as the Senate
and House now are, would administer
the government. Party distinctions are
