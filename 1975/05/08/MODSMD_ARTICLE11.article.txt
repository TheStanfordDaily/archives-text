# Oliphant Offends
## 
### 
Like so many other members
of the Stanford community, I
enjoy the clever cartoons, which
regularly head the opinions page
of the Daily. Frankly, usually I
am most amused by Pat
Oliphant, whose acid pen
satirizes the folly of most
nations and their leaders with
equal vehemence (and
sometimes, poor taste).
Nevertheless, occasionally a
cartoon is misleading and even
offensive, artistic license
notwithstanding. And such was
Oliphant's cartoon of May 5,
depicting three surly Arabs
reviewing accounts and pushing
"OPEC" oil to a smug consumer.
The drawings catered to those
repugnant stereotypes, which in
the case of our own minorities,
here in America, we have come
to find demeaning and divisive,
as well as inaccurate. In a
situation of growing
interdependence economically,
and concomitant growth of
misunderstanding and mistrust,
the continued dissemination of
these stereotypes is clearly
inappropriate!
In addition, the cartoon
suggests that Bedouin Arabs are
synonymous with the
Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) and

Winford Naylor |

hence the dominant policy
makers and beneficiaries of the
activities of that group. In fact,
Venezuela and Canada are much
more important sources of oil
for this country than any of the
Arab states.
While Venezuela and Iran
pushed for high and then still
higher prices, Saudi Arabia has
led opposition both to the
present high price and to
suggested higher prices. Arab
countries alone have counseled
the importance of moderation,
of tailoring OPEC policy to
global conditions.
Of course, we cannot expect
the complexity of an important
issue to be captured in a
cartoon. Nevertheless, the
editors should make a judgment
about the suitability of a
cartoon before printing it, and
they should consider the
sensitivities of its readership.

Forum.)
Editor's Note: Oliphant's
perspectives are uniquely his
own. His cartoons do not
necessarily represent a position
of the Daily, its staff or its
editors.
