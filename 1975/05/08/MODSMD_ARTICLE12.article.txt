## From The 'Cactus Garden' To Cambodia COP Elections Change With The Times 
### CECILE HEROLD 
Things sure were simpler in
the old days.
Consider the Stanford
student government election of
spring, 1900. On a Thursday
afternoon, April 19, the
associated students met in
Memorial Chapel for the purpose
of nominating officers.
President Coverly called the
meeting to order and the various
coveted offices, from student
body president to Daily editor
to baseball manager, were
gradually filled by nominations.
The new officers were elected
the following week. No
platforms were published, no
fliers were flown, no fiery
debates, no rallies, no assembly
speeches, no radio conferences

and no door-to-door
campaigning.
In spring, 1939, when present
University Vice President for
Development Ken Cuthbertson
ran for student body president,
the campaign trail was a little
rougher.
No Posters
"Two University groups
selected the candidates: the Row
Group, all the fraternities and
sororities, and the Hall Group,
representing all the dorms,"
Cuthbertson said.
There was little doubt among
candidates about the set limit of
their campaign expenditures.
"No money could be spent at
all," Cuthbertson chuckled.
"After you were nominated,
people from the student press

would ask you for statements to
draw out your interests. Classes
were excused for one assembly
in Memorial Auditorium at
which all the candidates spoke.
But there were no posters
decorating the campus."
Cuthbertson noted one
important difference in student
living which made full-scale
campaigns unnecessary anyway.
"Your entire class already knew
you because you'd lived together
in the same dorm all freshman
year — men in Encina, women in
Roble."
'Just Planned Fun'
Cuthbertson found it difficult
to pinpoint strong issues in
student government during his
year as president. "We just
planned fun. You'd be amazed

how little we thought about the
war.
"In academics, we were
keenly interested in world
affairs, but not when it came to
student activities," he said.
The only political battles he
can recall were mostly between
the women's organizations and
the student marager.
In the old days, Cuthbertson
said that "there weren't a lot of
students out fighting for rights.
It was the tail-end of the
depression and we felt pretty
lucky to be going to school."
Vice President Coline Upshaw
did sponsor one campaign for
student rights, however. She
encouraged the campus police,

all two of them, not to bother
students parked in the "cactus
garden."
"That was the popular place
on campus to be alone with your
date," Cuthbertson remembers.
Just as students today often
wonder what exactly goes on in
the ASSU offices, during
Cuthbertson's year they were
wondering the same thing.
Especially when Upshaw and the
president got to be better friends
and announced their wedding
engagement shortly before
graduation.
Won As A Lark
In 1962, the winner of the
ASSU elections, Armin
Rosencranz, ran as a lark and
won as a write-in candidate.
Rosencranz, then a third-year
law student and a teaching
assistant in political science, was
urged to run for office by
undergraduates.
Slogans emerged, often
surprising Rosencranz as much
as his opposition. "Send a man
to do a boy's job," read one
poster, reflecting Rosencranz's
stand on non-serious student
government. "He will make the
trains run on time," promised
another.
Coed Housing
The issues of the day were
coed housing, and liquor in the
male dorms and the
fraternities. When asked about
his position on liquor, he replied
nonchalantly, "I think it should
flow in the streets."
When elected, Rosencranz
decided to take the office a bit
more seriously. He designed a
program called "Armin's
Fourteen Points," all concerned
with national issues.
"I had no strong interest in
campus affairs," Rosencranz
said. "It was the height of the

Kennedy era and the
watchwords of the day were
political and social action.
"We were concerned with
civil rights, freedom of
expression and students' rights
in other countries." He is now a
University trustee.
Bob Grant ran for the council
in spring, 1970, when "it was
really grim on campus," he said.
"Just after my slate entered
office, the U.S. sent troops to
Cambodia, and a University
strike was voted. The campus
closed down completely."
In spring. 1971, Diane Fields
became the only black woman to
serve on the council of
presidents.
"During our whole year in
office, the configuration of the
judicial panel, then called the
Student Judicial Panel, was a
strong issue. We didn't want to
have anything to do with
students prosecuting other
students for demonstrations,
peaceful or otherwise."
End of Indians
Fields'syear in office was also
the year that the old Stanford
name —the "Indians"— was
abolished.

"It was a super-political
concern," she recalls. "The
Native American group
approached us, and their
complaint went through the
administration, the student
senate and athletic department
before it was positively acted
upon.
Reflections
"I realized four people are
bound to have difficulties over a
period of a year's close work. I
was so glad when that year was
over," she recalls.
"I was very disillusioned. We
worked so hard, but you could
never do anything that would
please everyone. I would never
run for the office again, even if
it meant not going to law
school." She is currently a third
year law student here.
Fields noted the sharp change
in more recent campaigns from
off-campus issues to student
service matters. "But student
services are political too, she
said.
"They must be paid for by
the students or the
administration, and that's when
they become political in a
University sense."

FOUR YEARS AGO — In spring 1971, then-COP member Diane
Fields became very disillusioned. That was the year the "Indians"
became the "Cardinals" and Fields finally concluded, "You could
never do anything that would please everyone."
Things sure were simpler in
the old days.
Consider the Stanford
student government election of
spring, 1900. On a Thursday
afternoon, April 19, the
associated students met in
Memorial Chapel for the purpose
of nominating officers.
President Coverly called the
meeting to order and the various
coveted offices, from student
body president to Daily editor
to baseball manager, were
gradually filled by nominations.
The new officers were elected
the following week. No
platforms were published, no
fliers were flown, no fiery
debates, no rallies, no assembly
speeches, no radio conferences

and no door-to-door
campaigning.
In spring, 1939, when present
University Vice President for
Development Ken Cuthbertson
ran for student body president,
the campaign trail was a little
rougher.
No Posters
"Two University groups
selected the candidates: the Row
Group, all the fraternities and
sororities, and the Hall Group,
representing all the dorms,"
Cuthbertson said.
There was little doubt among
candidates about the set limit of
their campaign expenditures.
"No money could be spent at
all," Cuthbertson chuckled.
"After you were nominated,
people from the student press

would ask you for statements to
draw out your interests. Classes
were excused for one assembly
in Memorial Auditorium at
which all the candidates spoke.
But there were no posters
decorating the campus."
Cuthbertson noted one
important difference in student
living which made full-scale
campaigns unnecessary anyway.
"Your entire class already knew
you because you'd lived together
in the same dorm all freshman
year — men in Encina, women in
Roble."
'Just Planned Fun'
Cuthbertson found it difficult
to pinpoint strong issues in
student government during his
year as president. "We just
planned fun. You'd be amazed

how little we thought about the
war.
"In academics, we were
keenly interested in world
affairs, but not when it came to
student activities," he said.
The only political battles he
can recall were mostly between
the women's organizations and
the student marager.
In the old days, Cuthbertson
said that "there weren't a lot of
students out fighting for rights.
It was the tail-end of the
depression and we felt pretty
lucky to be going to school."
Vice President Coline Upshaw
did sponsor one campaign for
student rights, however. She
encouraged the campus police,

all two of them, not to bother
students parked in the "cactus
garden."
"That was the popular place
on campus to be alone with your
date," Cuthbertson remembers.
Just as students today often
wonder what exactly goes on in
the ASSU offices, during
Cuthbertson's year they were
wondering the same thing.
Especially when Upshaw and the
president got to be better friends
and announced their wedding
engagement shortly before
graduation.
Won As A Lark
In 1962, the winner of the
ASSU elections, Armin
Rosencranz, ran as a lark and
won as a write-in candidate.
Rosencranz, then a third-year
law student and a teaching
assistant in political science, was
urged to run for office by
undergraduates.
Slogans emerged, often
surprising Rosencranz as much
as his opposition. "Send a man
to do a boy's job," read one
poster, reflecting Rosencranz's
stand on non-serious student
government. "He will make the
trains run on time," promised
another.
Coed Housing
The issues of the day were
coed housing, and liquor in the
male dorms and the
fraternities. When asked about
his position on liquor, he replied
nonchalantly, "I think it should
flow in the streets."
When elected, Rosencranz
decided to take the office a bit
more seriously. He designed a
program called "Armin's
Fourteen Points," all concerned
with national issues.
"I had no strong interest in
campus affairs," Rosencranz
said. "It was the height of the

Kennedy era and the
watchwords of the day were
political and social action.
"We were concerned with
civil rights, freedom of
expression and students' rights
in other countries." He is now a
University trustee.
Bob Grant ran for the council
in spring, 1970, when "it was
really grim on campus," he said.
"Just after my slate entered
office, the U.S. sent troops to
Cambodia, and a University
strike was voted. The campus
closed down completely."
In spring. 1971, Diane Fields
became the only black woman to
serve on the council of
presidents.
"During our whole year in
office, the configuration of the
judicial panel, then called the
Student Judicial Panel, was a
strong issue. We didn't want to
have anything to do with
students prosecuting other
students for demonstrations,
peaceful or otherwise."
End of Indians
Fields'syear in office was also
the year that the old Stanford
name —the "Indians"— was
abolished.

"It was a super-political
concern," she recalls. "The
Native American group
approached us, and their
complaint went through the
administration, the student
senate and athletic department
before it was positively acted
upon.
Reflections
"I realized four people are
bound to have difficulties over a
period of a year's close work. I
was so glad when that year was
over," she recalls.
"I was very disillusioned. We
worked so hard, but you could
never do anything that would
please everyone. I would never
run for the office again, even if
it meant not going to law
school." She is currently a third
year law student here.
Fields noted the sharp change
in more recent campaigns from
off-campus issues to student
service matters. "But student
services are political too, she
said.
"They must be paid for by
the students or the
administration, and that's when
they become political in a
University sense."

said.

the students or the
administration, and that's when
they become political in a

FOUR YEARS AGO — In spring 1971, then-COP member Diane
Fields became very disillusioned. That was the year the "Indians"
became the "Cardinals" and Fields finally concluded, "You could
never do anything that would please everyone."
Things sure were simpler in
the old days.
Consider the Stanford
student government election of
spring, 1900. On a Thursday
afternoon, April 19, the
associated students met in
Memorial Chapel for the purpose
of nominating officers.
President Coverly called the
meeting to order and the various
coveted offices, from student
body president to Daily editor
to baseball manager, were
gradually filled by nominations.
The new officers were elected
the following week. No
platforms were published, no
fliers were flown, no fiery
debates, no rallies, no assembly
speeches, no radio conferences

and no door-to-door
campaigning.
In spring, 1939, when present
University Vice President for
Development Ken Cuthbertson
ran for student body president,
the campaign trail was a little
rougher.
No Posters
"Two University groups
selected the candidates: the Row
Group, all the fraternities and
sororities, and the Hall Group,
representing all the dorms,"
Cuthbertson said.
There was little doubt among
candidates about the set limit of
their campaign expenditures.
"No money could be spent at
all," Cuthbertson chuckled.
"After you were nominated,
people from the student press

would ask you for statements to
draw out your interests. Classes
were excused for one assembly
in Memorial Auditorium at
which all the candidates spoke.
But there were no posters
decorating the campus."
Cuthbertson noted one
important difference in student
living which made full-scale
campaigns unnecessary anyway.
"Your entire class already knew
you because you'd lived together
in the same dorm all freshman
year — men in Encina, women in
Roble."
'Just Planned Fun'
Cuthbertson found it difficult
to pinpoint strong issues in
student government during his
year as president. "We just
planned fun. You'd be amazed

how little we thought about the
war.
"In academics, we were
keenly interested in world
affairs, but not when it came to
student activities," he said.
The only political battles he
can recall were mostly between
the women's organizations and
the student marager.
In the old days, Cuthbertson
said that "there weren't a lot of
students out fighting for rights.
It was the tail-end of the
depression and we felt pretty
lucky to be going to school."
Vice President Coline Upshaw
did sponsor one campaign for
student rights, however. She
encouraged the campus police,

all two of them, not to bother
students parked in the "cactus
garden."
"That was the popular place
on campus to be alone with your
date," Cuthbertson remembers.
Just as students today often
wonder what exactly goes on in
the ASSU offices, during
Cuthbertson's year they were
wondering the same thing.
Especially when Upshaw and the
president got to be better friends
and announced their wedding
engagement shortly before
graduation.
Won As A Lark
In 1962, the winner of the
ASSU elections, Armin
Rosencranz, ran as a lark and
won as a write-in candidate.
Rosencranz, then a third-year
law student and a teaching
assistant in political science, was
urged to run for office by
undergraduates.
Slogans emerged, often
surprising Rosencranz as much
as his opposition. "Send a man
to do a boy's job," read one
poster, reflecting Rosencranz's
stand on non-serious student
government. "He will make the
trains run on time," promised
another.
Coed Housing
The issues of the day were
coed housing, and liquor in the
male dorms and the
fraternities. When asked about
his position on liquor, he replied
nonchalantly, "I think it should
flow in the streets."
When elected, Rosencranz
decided to take the office a bit
more seriously. He designed a
program called "Armin's
Fourteen Points," all concerned
with national issues.
"I had no strong interest in
campus affairs," Rosencranz
said. "It was the height of the

Kennedy era and the
watchwords of the day were
political and social action.
"We were concerned with
civil rights, freedom of
expression and students' rights
in other countries." He is now a
University trustee.
Bob Grant ran for the council
in spring, 1970, when "it was
really grim on campus," he said.
"Just after my slate entered
office, the U.S. sent troops to
Cambodia, and a University
strike was voted. The campus
closed down completely."
In spring. 1971, Diane Fields
became the only black woman to
serve on the council of
presidents.
"During our whole year in
office, the configuration of the
judicial panel, then called the
Student Judicial Panel, was a
strong issue. We didn't want to
have anything to do with
students prosecuting other
students for demonstrations,
peaceful or otherwise."
End of Indians
Fields'syear in office was also
the year that the old Stanford
name —the "Indians"— was
abolished.

"It was a super-political
concern," she recalls. "The
Native American group
approached us, and their
complaint went through the
administration, the student
senate and athletic department
before it was positively acted
upon.
Reflections
"I realized four people are
bound to have difficulties over a
period of a year's close work. I
was so glad when that year was
over," she recalls.
"I was very disillusioned. We
worked so hard, but you could
never do anything that would
please everyone. I would never
run for the office again, even if
it meant not going to law
school." She is currently a third
year law student here.
Fields noted the sharp change
in more recent campaigns from
off-campus issues to student
service matters. "But student
services are political too, she
said.
"They must be paid for by
the students or the
administration, and that's when
they become political in a
University sense."
