What is the derivation of the phrase "to
malic out"? Six of us have pondered this
question and have not been able to reach
first base. Hoping that you can do better.
—S.L.K.
Unfortunately, we can't help you score.
The* Dictionary of American Slang,
published in 1966, contains a definition of
the phrase — "to succeed in seducing a
woman" — but offers no hints regarding the
phrase's origin.
The subsequent entry in the dictionary —
"make-out artist" — doesn't go much
farther. However, it does pinpoint the first
time in which that phrase was mentioned in
a national publication — the March 6, 1949
issue of New York Times Magazine. In a
fascinating article on post-war slang, the

writer explains that a man noted for his
talents in seduction should now be referred
to as a "make-out artist" rather than a
"wolf."
The reliability of the article seems
questionable, however, when one considers
the other expressions that were reportedly
in vogue at the time. For example, did
anyone really say "F.F.F.F.T.0.Y.F.F."
rather than "Drop dead!" (It stands for
"Fall fatally flat five times on your fat
face.")? and was "Easy, breezy, you'll slide
a mile" really more popular than the old
"Take it easy"?
"Lover-boy" as a replacement for the
pre-war "dreamboat" doesn't sound
unlikely, but was a new haircut really
known as "a new peak on an old beak"?

And was an ugly girl seriously a "beast" and
had the unfortunate male who dated her
really been "beasted"?
Finally, did anyone actually exclaim
"Bongo-bongo, toot-the-hoot,
fiddle-dee-dee, chickery-chick and
fol-de-rol" instead of "You're kidding"?
Two other expressions should interest
you. A girl having an enjoyable time in
1949 would squeal "That vibrates me!" A
boy, on the other hand, chortled that he
was "making out like 10 men."
Anyway, sorry that v/e couldn't find a
good answer. You might try the Oxford
English Dictionary's supplement, scheduled
to come out later this year. So far only the
A-G volume has appeared. Here's hoping
you get to second base in the near future.
