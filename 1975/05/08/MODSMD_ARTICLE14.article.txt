# Parking Ticket Suit Remains In Limbo
## 
### ELIZABETH POLLOCK 
If you gave the ASSU your
parking tickets earlier this year,
your case has not been dismissed
yet, but "there's nothing to
worry about," according to
Escondido Village President
Cathie Colson.
"The matter is being held in
abeyance pending settlement of
the civil action," said Dent
Hand, attorney for the ASSU
and Escondido Village. "At the
present time I have no authority
to drop it [the suit|," he
continued.
"We're just letting it [the
case] sit until there is a new
plan, and everyone is happy and
satisfied with it," Colson said.

Acceptance of a parking
compromise proposed by Vice
President for Business and
Financial Affairs Robert
Augsburger earlier this year
ended active pursuit of the case
for now, but "it seems to make
better financial sense to just let
it sit there" in case the
permanent parking plan becomes
unacceptable, Colson said.
Escondido Village and the
ASSU have spent about $3000
since January, mostly for
attorneys' fees, and "I'm sure
the University is interested" in
resolving the questions raised in
the brief so the problem will no
occur again, Colson said.
The basic issues are:
— does the University have
the right to issue tickets under
the statutes cited?
—were the ticketing officers
legally deputized?
—are the posted signs
adequate?
