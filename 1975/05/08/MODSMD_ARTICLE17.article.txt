: As you know, we normally
[ have to hem and haw to get you
< interested enough to read this
c column.
c
< However, this week we can
[ honestly say that we don't need
; any enticement; for a variety of
: good fun and Stanford-centered
! activities, this is clearly the best
; week of the year. We'll let the
: events speak for themselves.
This afternoon, at the Meyer
Library Forum Room, don't miss
an interesting discussion of the
assassinations of John and Robert
Kennedy. Former New York
Congressman Allard Lowenstein
will be there and the famous
Zapruder film of President
Kennedy's assassination will be
shown. It starts at 4:15 and
admission is free.
Starting tomorrow and running
through the weekend are the

annual Spring Festival in White
Plaza and the second annual
Stanford Carnival at the corner of
Campus Drive and Serra Street.
The festival, sponsored by the
Bridge, features exhibits and items
for sale. The carnival, with some
proceeds going to the Famine
Relief Fund, will feature roller
coasters, a zipper, a paratrooper,
bumper cars and kiddie rides.
If you're a sports enthusiast,
don't miss the Alumni Football
game Saturday at 10 a.m. in the
Stadium. You'll get your chance
to judge the quarterbacks and to
see if the get up and go in several
alums has yet gotten up and gone.
Should you seek stage
performances this weekend,
Stanford offers several. ASSU
Special Events presents the
hilarious Firesign Theater on
Saturday evening for two shows in

Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The Stanford Music
Department is presenting several
fine concerts this week, including
the Francesco Trio in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium tomorrow night and
Kurt Weill's The Seven Deadly
Sins of the Bourgeoisie, an Alea II
production directed by Martin
Bresnick, Monday and Tuesday
night in Cubberley Auditorium. It
features a 35-piece orchestra.
We usually end by mocking the
habitually bad films presented by
KTVU's Creature Feature. But, in
this week of splendiferous
activities, even Bob Wilkins comes
through with Night of the
Living Dead (which the Daily's
horror expert, Glenn Garvin, calls
"The greatest horror movie ever
made") and the original
Frankenstein (1932) starring Boris
Karloff beginning at 9:30 on
Channel Two. â€”George Dobbins
