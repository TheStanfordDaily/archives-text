Committee Approves Aid Funds
WASHINGTON - The House immigration
subcommittee voted unanimously last night to approve
President Ford's request for funds to aid up to 150,000
Indochina refugees.
The bill authorizes the President to spend "such sums
as may be necessary" to carry out the Indochina refugee
effort.
While the measure contains no money figures,
President Ford has estimated that the aid programs he is
requesting will cost $507 million.
The authorization bill must be followed by an
appropriation bill setting specific amounts of money to be
spent.
The full House Judiciary Committee plans to vote on
the authorization measure tonight, clearing the way for
House action next week.
Unemployment Scores Key Increase
WASHINGTON — The government announced
yesterday that rising unemployment pushed the nation's
welfare rolls up 1.3 percent in January, the largest
monthly increase in more than three years.
The Department of Health, Education and Welfare said
that 11,147,071 persons received Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC) during January.
Khoy: Lon Nol Bribed To Leave
CAMP PENDLETON - Sau Kham Khoy, the last
president of Cambodia, said yesterday that his
government bribed former President Lon Nol with $1
million to get him to leave the country.
"Lon Nol was so strong, he had all the military and
civil power, but he was a sick man," Khoy said in a soft
voice, translated into English by a son.
"If he had remained there it would have been too
difficult to put anything into effect to defend the
country."
The bribe was made in American money, Khoy said
without specifying where the cash was obtained.

Lon Nol left Cambodia about a week before the fall of
Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge on April 17. He flew to
Hawaii where he is buying a house. Khoy succeeded Lon
Nol in the presidency and later was evacuated from his
crumbling nation with Americans.
In Honolulu, Lon Nol could not be reached for
comment. A State Department official said the former
president still does not wish to talk with newsmen.
Gun Evidence Shown In SLA Trial
SACRAMENTO — Eighteen guns found in the rubble
of a Los Angeles house where six Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) members died last May were presented at the
Marcus Foster murder trial yesterday.
They included a pistol the prosecution contends was
one of two used to kill Foster.
SLA members Russell Little and Joseph Remiro are
charged with the cyanide-bullet murder of Foster,
Oakland's superintendent of schools, on Nov. 6,1973.
Among the guns was a .38-caliber Rossi pistol that he
said was found not more than a foot away from the body
of Nancy Ling Perry. The prosecution says the gun was
one of two pistols used to kill Foster.
An earlier witness said he sold such a pistol to Little.
The prosecution says Remiro owned the other murder
weapon.

civil power, but he was a sick man," Khoy said in a soft
voice, translated into English by a son.
"If he had remained there it would have been too
difficult to put anything into effect to defend the
country."
The bribe was made in American money, Khoy said
without specifying where the cash was obtained.

Lon Nol left Cambodia about a week before the fall of
Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge on April 17. He flew to
Hawaii where he is buying a house. Khoy succeeded Lon
Nol in the presidency and later was evacuated from his
crumbling nation with Americans.
In Honolulu, Lon Nol could not be reached for
comment. A State Department official said the former
president still does not wish to talk with newsmen.
Gun Evidence Shown In SLA Trial
SACRAMENTO — Eighteen guns found in the rubble
of a Los Angeles house where six Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) members died last May were presented at the
Marcus Foster murder trial yesterday.
They included a pistol the prosecution contends was
one of two used to kill Foster.
SLA members Russell Little and Joseph Remiro are
charged with the cyanide-bullet murder of Foster,
Oakland's superintendent of schools, on Nov. 6,1973.
Among the guns was a .38-caliber Rossi pistol that he
said was found not more than a foot away from the body
of Nancy Ling Perry. The prosecution says the gun was
one of two pistols used to kill Foster.
An earlier witness said he sold such a pistol to Little.
The prosecution says Remiro owned the other murder
weapon.

Committee Approves Aid Funds
WASHINGTON - The House immigration

President Ford's request for funds to aid up to 150,000
Indochina refugees.
