# Sit-ins At Claremont, Davis
## Student Protests Multiply 
### KATHY BATTS DAN FIDUCCIA 
Black and chicano students
occupied the administration building
at the Claremont Colleges Tuesday in a
protest over the administration's
tenure and minority funding policies.
Claremont Collegian Publisher Bret
Nye told the Daily yesterday that 10
to 20 students from the Black Student
Center (BSC) and Chicano Student
Center (CSC) entered Pendleton
Business Office shortly before 9 a.m.
Tuesday. A larger group stationed
themselves outside to guard the
building, Nye said.
Neither group left until 10 that
evening, when police declared the
gathering an illegal assembly.
According to Nye, BSC Director
James Garrett stayed in the building
with two other students, defying a
temporary restraining order.
Student discontent has been
brewing since April 25, Nye said.
Noon rallies, candlelight marches and
firebombings culminated in the
disturbance Tuesday.
Infirmary Firebombed
The worst damage from the
protesters came Monday, when
Memorial Infirmary was firebombed,
causing $25,000 damage, but no
injuries. Fires were also set in Holmes
Hall dormitory, the campus security
office and Renwick Gymnasium.
Bomb threats have been called in at
Pitzer and Claremont Men's Colleges,
Sumner Hall, and the libraries at
Harvey Mudd College. In addition,
several buildings, bridges and students'
cars have been defaced with spray
paint.
The controversy focuses on two
minority issues, according to Nye. The
BSC and the CSC run summer
workshops for disadvantaged blacks
and chicanos. Up until this year the

workshops have been partially funded
by the administration, but due to
budget cutbacks, the administration
claims it cannot provide any funding
this summer at all.
"The administration does have a
legitimate argument," Nye said. "They
had to borrow $40,000 to fund the
workshops last year, of which they've
only paid back $2000. They can't have
any outside funding this year, like
they had before."
However, Nye said he thinks
minorities feel the administration is
taking advantage of tight economic
times to cut back on minority
programs.
"They feel they're being treated as
a 'fair weather program,' " hf said.
Tenure Controversy
Tenure for minority professors has
also sparked controversy. Nye said
professors that teach BSC- and
CSC-sponsored classes are denied the
same tenure privileges as professors
teaching in other departments at the
six colleges in the Claremont system.
Most professors teaching BSC and CSO
classes are not tenured, Nye said.
He added that the minority groups
were afraid that since the BSC and
CSC were being cut back, the
programs might be phased out
completely in the future. The
administration, he said, would then
prefer to have fully tenured professors
from the other colleges teaching BSC
and CSC related classes.
The campuses were relatively quiet
yesterday, Nye noted, adding that
students were "probably regrouping."
Meanwhile, Asian American
students at UC-Davis were also
demonstrating Tuesday, protesting the
tenure denial of Asst. Anthropology
Prof. Kenne Chang.
After a rally in the center of the

campus, over 50 students marched on
Mrak Hall, the administration building
to confront University Chancellor
James Meyer.
An hour later, students emerged to
announce that Meyer had rejected
their demand to reopen Chang's case.
Although the Davis anthropology
department had recommended that
Chang be granted tenure, an ad hoc
panel rejected his case, citing the fact
that Chang's works were written in
Japanese instead of English as a reason
for denial.

'MAD' OVER MOYNIHAN — Almost 100 students attended a teach-in on Daniel Patrick Moynihan last night in the
Physics Tank. The selection of Moynihan — a Harvard government professor and former official of the Nixon
administration — to speak at graduation has drawn fire from a number of quarters. The teach-in was conducted by
Sociology Prof. W. Richard Scott, Asst. Sociology Prof. Michael Hannan and Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake.
