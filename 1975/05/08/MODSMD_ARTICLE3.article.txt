# Profs Scrutinize Moynihan's Work
## 
### PAIGE CHERNO 
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake
said last night that Daniel Moynihan is
"offensive and intolerable to a whole
generation of black social scientists."
Drake was the last of three
professors to address about 100
persons attending a teach-in in the
Physics Tank dealing with Moynihan's
scholarship. The Harvard government
professor has been selected as this
year's main commencement speaker.
Asst. Sociology Prof. Michael
Hannan and Sociology Prof. W.
Richard Scott joined Drake in the
program sponsored by the
Undergraduate Program in African and
Afro-American Studies.
Drake spoke on Moynihan's
attitudes toward Third World peoples
within and outside the United States.
"The real gulf between Moynihan and
Third World peoples is what each sees
as the most important causative
factors of poverty."
'Patronizing' Attitude
Moynihan, he said, sees the
matriarchal family structure as the
major cause while Third World peoples
see their "surrounding environment
still suffused with racism" as the
cause.
Drake said he also objects to
Moynihan's "patronizing" attitude.
"He presumes to tell African and
Asian nations what he thinks is good
for them." Moynihan, who may be the
next U.S. Ambassador to the U:N.,
"tells them that multinational
corporations are the greatest invention
of the 20th Century," he added.
"One of my main objections,"
Drake said, "is that Moynihan never
consults any black or Third World
scholars" when writing his books. Yet
he criticized Drake and other
professors in On Understanding
Poverty for not contributing to the
War on Poverty task force, he said.

Hannan concentrated on
Moynihan's book, The Negro Family,
in which Moynihan presents the
"culture of poverty theory." The
theory' holds -that poverty was
originally a condition rooted in
slavery', but has since been
"transformed into a trait carried by
black people."
Irrelevant Data
Moynihan's theory was not new,
according to Hannan. "He in no sense
perfected the culture of poverty
theoiy. If anything, he probably
obscured it."
The evidence he used in the 1965
study was not new either, Hannan
said.
Hannan called Moynihan's analysis
"skimpy and simplistic." Moynihan
claimed that "persisting
unemployment among black males led
to a permanent welfare dependency"
among blacks which continued even
after unemployment figures declined
around 1960, Hannan said. Moynihan
took this as proof of
"self-perpetuating" poverty, which he
claims exists regardless of white
racism, he added.
"It is kind of curious," Hannan
noted, "that he didn't notice that in
1960 a Democratic administration
took over, which could easily have
affected the size of welfare caseloads."
Scott, on the other hand, found
"much to admire" in Moynihan's
analysis in Maximum Feasible
Misunderstanding, in which Moynihan
analyzes the shortcomings of
federally-sponsored community action
programs designed to help the poor.
Scott said he agreed with Moynihan
that the "primary defect of the
programs was their duplicity." They
had the appearance of being locally
run, while they were actually
"conceived, financed and controlled
by Washington."

he criticized Drake and other
professors in On Understanding
Poverty for not contributing to the
War on Poverty task force, he said.

Hannan concentrated on
Moynihan's book, The Negro Family,
in which Moynihan presents the
"culture of poverty theory." The
theory' holds -that poverty was
originally a condition rooted in
slavery', but has since been
"transformed into a trait carried by
black people."
Irrelevant Data
Moynihan's theory was not new,
according to Hannan. "He in no sense
perfected the culture of poverty
theoiy. If anything, he probably
obscured it."
The evidence he used in the 1965
study was not new either, Hannan
said.
Hannan called Moynihan's analysis
"skimpy and simplistic." Moynihan
claimed that "persisting
unemployment among black males led
to a permanent welfare dependency"
among blacks which continued even
after unemployment figures declined
around 1960, Hannan said. Moynihan
took this as proof of
"self-perpetuating" poverty, which he
claims exists regardless of white
racism, he added.
"It is kind of curious," Hannan
noted, "that he didn't notice that in
1960 a Democratic administration
took over, which could easily have
affected the size of welfare caseloads."
Scott, on the other hand, found
"much to admire" in Moynihan's
analysis in Maximum Feasible
Misunderstanding, in which Moynihan
analyzes the shortcomings of
federally-sponsored community action
programs designed to help the poor.
Scott said he agreed with Moynihan
that the "primary defect of the
programs was their duplicity." They
had the appearance of being locally
run, while they were actually
"conceived, financed and controlled
by Washington."
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake
said last night that Daniel Moynihan is
"offensive and intolerable to a whole
generation of black social scientists."
Drake was the last of three
professors to address about 100
persons attending a teach-in in the
Physics Tank dealing with Moynihan's
scholarship. The Harvard government
professor has been selected as this
year's main commencement speaker.
Asst. Sociology Prof. Michael
Hannan and Sociology Prof. W.
Richard Scott joined Drake in the
program sponsored by the
Undergraduate Program in African and
Afro-American Studies.
Drake spoke on Moynihan's
attitudes toward Third World peoples
within and outside the United States.
"The real gulf between Moynihan and
Third World peoples is what each sees
as the most important causative
factors of poverty."
'Patronizing' Attitude
Moynihan, he said, sees the
matriarchal family structure as the
major cause while Third World peoples
see their "surrounding environment
still suffused with racism" as the
cause.
Drake said he also objects to
Moynihan's "patronizing" attitude.
"He presumes to tell African and
Asian nations what he thinks is good
for them." Moynihan, who may be the
next U.S. Ambassador to the U:N.,
"tells them that multinational
corporations are the greatest invention
of the 20th Century," he added.
"One of my main objections,"
Drake said, "is that Moynihan never
consults any black or Third World
scholars" when writing his books. Yet
he criticized Drake and other
professors in On Understanding
Poverty for not contributing to the
War on Poverty task force, he said.
