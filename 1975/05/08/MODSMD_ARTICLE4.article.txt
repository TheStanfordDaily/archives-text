# Absence Of Permit Could Force Cancellation Of Spring Carnival
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The second annual spring carnival
scheduled to begin tomorrow may be
canceled if carnival organizers and
University officials can't find some
way around a Santa Clara County
zoning ordinance which requires them
to obtain a carnival permit.
A Santa Clara County fire marshal
told carnival organizers Tuesday that
they need a permit before they can
begin the carnival.
However, because of "red tape,"
carnival officials say they cannot
possibly obtain a regular permit by
tomorrow.
University officials will attend a
county Board of Supervisors meeting
this morning in hopes of persuading
the board to give Stanford an
exemption from the ordinance.
Might Shut Down
"If we don't get an exemption,"
said carnival Chairman Ed Connor,
"then we'll have to shut it down.

There's no question."
University officials agree. They
have asked Supervisor Geraldine
Steinberg to bring the problem to the
attention of the board.
"I will suggest that the county pass
an emergency ordinance ... that
exempts the academic campus at
Stanford from the regulations," she
said.
Unclear Reference
The current ordinance requires
permits for all "entertainment events"
but does not make clear which
Stanford events should be covered.
"It's hard to tell what the board
will do," said Andrew Doty, University
relations official. "I think we have a
reasonable request, however."
The ordinance was originally passed
to protect county residents from large
crowds congregating near their homes,
he said.
"We [the University] ought to be
able to look out for the public health

and safety here," Doty said, noting
that Stanford has its own police
department, health department and
fire department.
Last year's carnival organizers
didn't get a permit because they
apparently didn't know one was
required, Connor, a third-year law
student, said.
There is a $1000 fine for not
obtaining the proper permit, according
to the ordinance, but Michael Hudnall,
University counsel to the vice
president for business and finance, said
he doubts the county will try to
collect the fine from last year's
officials.
Another Problem
Carnival organizers have already
signed a contract with the owner of
the carnival equipment. Connor said
that he has been told that the owner
already had spent $6000 setting up the
rides.


FATHER-DAUGHTER DUET — Next year at this time. Music Lecturer Marty Bresnick and his daughter Johanna could
be playing the piano in Rome. Bresnick has received the Rome Prize Fellowships in musical composition and plans to
spend next year writing "in the romantic setting" of Italy.
If the carnival is canceled, the
equipment owner may sue the carnival
organizers, he admitted.
If the carnival does occur, Connor
said he thinks the event can net over
$3000 this year. The money will be
used to build watersheds and provide
food for starving Africans, suffering
from a recent drought in the Sahel.
Last year's carnival netted $2700.
Attractions this year include a
funhouse, a ferris wheel, expositions,
sideshows and 10 "thrill rides,"
according to Connor. Organizers and the
company providing the equipment will
split revenues from ticket sales.

However, because of "red tape,"
carnival officials say they cannot
possibly obtain a regular permit by
tomorrow.
University officials will attend a
county Board of Supervisors meeting
this morning in hopes of persuading
the board to give Stanford an
exemption from the ordinance.
Might Shut Down
"If we don't get an exemption,"
said carnival Chairman Ed Connor,
"then we'll have to shut it down.

There's no question."
University officials agree. They
have asked Supervisor Geraldine
Steinberg to bring the problem to the
attention of the board.
"I will suggest that the county pass
an emergency ordinance ... that
exempts the academic campus at
Stanford from the regulations," she
said.
Unclear Reference
The current ordinance requires
permits for all "entertainment events"
but does not make clear which
Stanford events should be covered.
"It's hard to tell what the board
will do," said Andrew Doty, University
relations official. "I think we have a
reasonable request, however."
The ordinance was originally passed
to protect county residents from large
crowds congregating near their homes,
he said.
"We [the University] ought to be
able to look out for the public health

and safety here," Doty said, noting
that Stanford has its own police
department, health department and
fire department.
Last year's carnival organizers
didn't get a permit because they
apparently didn't know one was
required, Connor, a third-year law
student, said.
There is a $1000 fine for not
obtaining the proper permit, according
to the ordinance, but Michael Hudnall,
University counsel to the vice
president for business and finance, said
he doubts the county will try to
collect the fine from last year's
officials.
Another Problem
Carnival organizers have already
signed a contract with the owner of
the carnival equipment. Connor said
that he has been told that the owner
already had spent $6000 setting up the
rides.


FATHER-DAUGHTER DUET — Next year at this time. Music Lecturer Marty Bresnick and his daughter Johanna could
be playing the piano in Rome. Bresnick has received the Rome Prize Fellowships in musical composition and plans to
spend next year writing "in the romantic setting" of Italy.
If the carnival is canceled, the
equipment owner may sue the carnival
organizers, he admitted.
If the carnival does occur, Connor
said he thinks the event can net over
$3000 this year. The money will be
used to build watersheds and provide
food for starving Africans, suffering
from a recent drought in the Sahel.
Last year's carnival netted $2700.
Attractions this year include a
funhouse, a ferris wheel, expositions,
sideshows and 10 "thrill rides,"
according to Connor. Organizers and the
company providing the equipment will
split revenues from ticket sales.
The second annual spring carnival
scheduled to begin tomorrow may be
canceled if carnival organizers and
University officials can't find some
way around a Santa Clara County
zoning ordinance which requires them
to obtain a carnival permit.
A Santa Clara County fire marshal
told carnival organizers Tuesday that
they need a permit before they can
begin the carnival.
