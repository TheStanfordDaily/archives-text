# Music Prof Wins Rome Fellowship
## Bresnick 'Dies' His Students 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
Martin Bresnick is late. He rushes through the door
clutching a squatty brown briefcase, dressed in the
serviceable dark blue clothes found in the Sears
Workmen's Department. After he slams down his bag, you
expect him to ask you why your Maytag isn't working.
Instead, he roams around the room and talks about
Robert Schumann, clasping and unclasping his hands. "In
those days," said Bresnick of Schumann's era, "nobody
was earning any money writing music."
Bresnick himself, however, has not fared quite as badly
as Schumann. The 28-year-old lecturer in music theory is
this year's recipient of the Rome Prize Fellowships in
musical composition. The award provides for a year's
residence in Europe for Bresnick, his wife and his
daughter.
This summer, Bresnick and his family will leave for
Rome and spend a year there, where he is looking forward
to writing music "in a romantic setting."
In the fall of 1976, he will go to Yale, where "I'll be
teaching less, and the stature will be greater." Yale, he
claims, is a university which is "highly dedicated to the
humanities."
Dissatisfied
Bresnick says he is dissatisfied with Stanford.
"Stanford's commitment to humanistic studies has always
been small, and it continues to dry up in this period of
budget adjustment," says Bresnick, shifting around
impatiently in his chair. "They should call it Stanford
Tech — their priorities are the sciences and engineering."
Bresnick claims that in the past 10 years, enrollment in
the Music Department has doubled, while last year the
department lost a faculty position.
"When our funding was hit, it hurt the students more
than the faculty," Bresnick continues, "and I think the

students deserve better."
Although funding may be low, Music Department
members insist that students can still benefit from
teachers like Bresnick.
"He's very gifted," says Albert Cohen, chairman of the
Music Department. "We're delighted about the award and
very proud of him."
Bresnick says he owes much to his students.
'Digs' Students
"I really dig my students." His eyes, which normally
look half-closed under his highly-arched eyebrows, light
up in enthusiasm. "We mutually like each other a lot, and
without them, I wouldn't be here." In 1972, he received
the Walter J. Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching.
Bresnick has been a resident fellow at Twain and
Lagunita, and he is also the director of Stanford's music
ensemble, Alea 11. "I enjoy conducting most of all," he
said.
Since 1894 the American Academy in Rome has
usually given the award to two persons, but this year,
Bresnick stands alone. He submitted three works: "Musica
for Nine Instruments," his doctoral dissertation piece;
"B.'s Garlands for Eight Celli"; and "Ocean of Storms,"
an orchestral piece composed when Bresnick was a
Fulbright Fellow in Vienna under the tutelage of
Gottfreid von Einem.
Stanford Demonstrator
He received his A.B. at the University of Hartford's
Hartt College of Music, and came to Stanford in the fall of
1967 for his graduate work.
"At Stanford I played in a rock band to make money
and because I really liked rock music," Bresnick says.
"I'm a veteran of the first Old Union sit-in. We hoped to
move Stanford to the left, but we were naive to think it."

Bresnick says he is dissatisfied with Stanford.
"Stanford's commitment to humanistic studies has always
been small, and it continues to dry up in this period of
budget adjustment," says Bresnick, shifting around
impatiently in his chair. "They should call it Stanford
Tech — their priorities are the sciences and engineering."
Bresnick claims that in the past 10 years, enrollment in
the Music Department has doubled, while last year the
department lost a faculty position.
"When our funding was hit, it hurt the students more
than the faculty," Bresnick continues, "and I think the

students deserve better."
Although funding may be low, Music Department
members insist that students can still benefit from
teachers like Bresnick.
"He's very gifted," says Albert Cohen, chairman of the
Music Department. "We're delighted about the award and
very proud of him."
Bresnick says he owes much to his students.
'Digs' Students
"I really dig my students." His eyes, which normally
look half-closed under his highly-arched eyebrows, light
up in enthusiasm. "We mutually like each other a lot, and
without them, I wouldn't be here." In 1972, he received
the Walter J. Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching.
Bresnick has been a resident fellow at Twain and
Lagunita, and he is also the director of Stanford's music
ensemble, Alea 11. "I enjoy conducting most of all," he
said.
Since 1894 the American Academy in Rome has
usually given the award to two persons, but this year,
Bresnick stands alone. He submitted three works: "Musica
for Nine Instruments," his doctoral dissertation piece;
"B.'s Garlands for Eight Celli"; and "Ocean of Storms,"
an orchestral piece composed when Bresnick was a
Fulbright Fellow in Vienna under the tutelage of
Gottfreid von Einem.
Stanford Demonstrator
He received his A.B. at the University of Hartford's
Hartt College of Music, and came to Stanford in the fall of
1967 for his graduate work.
"At Stanford I played in a rock band to make money
and because I really liked rock music," Bresnick says.
"I'm a veteran of the first Old Union sit-in. We hoped to
move Stanford to the left, but we were naive to think it."
Martin Bresnick is late. He rushes through the door
clutching a squatty brown briefcase, dressed in the
serviceable dark blue clothes found in the Sears
Workmen's Department. After he slams down his bag, you
expect him to ask you why your Maytag isn't working.
Instead, he roams around the room and talks about
Robert Schumann, clasping and unclasping his hands. "In
those days," said Bresnick of Schumann's era, "nobody
was earning any money writing music."
Bresnick himself, however, has not fared quite as badly
as Schumann. The 28-year-old lecturer in music theory is
this year's recipient of the Rome Prize Fellowships in
musical composition. The award provides for a year's
residence in Europe for Bresnick, his wife and his
daughter.
This summer, Bresnick and his family will leave for
Rome and spend a year there, where he is looking forward
to writing music "in a romantic setting."
In the fall of 1976, he will go to Yale, where "I'll be
teaching less, and the stature will be greater." Yale, he
claims, is a university which is "highly dedicated to the
humanities."
