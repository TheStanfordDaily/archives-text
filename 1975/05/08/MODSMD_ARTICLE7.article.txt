## Lasuen Closing 
### 
Last Thursday's demonstration that effectively closed
Lasuen Mall represents a commendable instance of
students' acting to solve a dangerous problem that police
had chosen to ignore.
Although concerned students brought their case to the
campus police long before the protest, the police decided
to leave the mall open to traffic as an access road to the
post office until the regular road, Old Lane A, was
completely repaved. Such a police decision, despite
problems of consistent speeding, parking violations and
accidents that injured a cyclist and knocked over two of
three streetlights on the mall, seems to have been
extremely unwise, and residents of the houses that line
the mall had more than adequate reasons to demand the
mall's closing.
Most unfortunate is the University's decision to open
Lasuen Mall to motor vehicles in the first place.
Surrounded by student residences and traditionally
reserved for pedestrians and bicyclists, the mall seems an
exceptionally poor choice as an access route to the post
office. Allowing cars and trucks — both noisy and
hazardous — to pass through the mall represented a
concession to motorists at the expense of residents. Such
a concession is disturbing.
Although Police Chief Marvin Herrington should be
congratulated for responding relatively quickly to the
protest, it is regrettable that police took no action at all
for the almost three weeks before the demonstration. In
the face of such a glaring problem, students should never
have had to resort to a demonstration to motivate the
police to change the situation. The students' legitimate
complaints should have been more than enough to
convince the police that Lasuen Mall had to be closed.
