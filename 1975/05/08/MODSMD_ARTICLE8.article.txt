# Old Union Due For Takeover?
## 
### Tim Ferguson 
The writing is on the
proverbial wall.
Two weeks ago at Brown
University, last week at Brandeis
and this week at as unlikely a
place as the University of
California at Santa Barbara, the
days of student occupations of
college buildings were upon us
once more.
The issues were very much
like those now being debated in
some segments of the Stanford
community: financial aid
cutbacks (particularly for
minorities), faculty layoffs
(hitting hardest at untenured
women and minorities),
inclusion of more ethnic groups
into minority aid pools and the
phasing out of ethnic studies
programs.
Occupation Here?
Now, I wouldn't be surprised
to see some lingering dispute,
say between the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids and Students for
Equity, evolve into an
occupation of Old Union. I
would be saddened by such an
event — though I sense that
many would not.
Daily News Editor Stephen
Carter, for example, in his April
30 column, wrote that "one can
only be relieved — or perhaps,
enthused" by events such as the
Brown takeover.
A majority on the Daily
Editorial Board followed him
two days later with praise for
"effective and justifiable
responses to a secret university
decision-making process" at
Brown. "The actions at Brown
should be considered by
students at other universities
such as Stanford where students
have similar problems being
heard," the editorial concluded.
Getting 'Heard'
That phrase "being heard"
troubles me, as do two other
of the recent

confrontations:
—what is the meaning of the
word "violence"?
—what are the alternatives
offered by the occupying groups
to the cutting back of programs
they deem worthy?
First, the question of student
input. The Daily editorialized
that the Brown occupation "is a
good example of a situation
when students needed to take
militant action in order to have a
voice in a university decision
making process" (my emphasis).

I wonder if the Daily
Editorial Board is aware of the
particulars of any advisory
committee system at Brown
which might have broached the
issues in dispute. I'm not, so I
won't accuse the Brown
administration of making
"drastic budget cutbacks
without any student input," as
the editorial did.
False Complaints?
Indeed, an editorial in the
Brown Daily Herald the day of
the occupation attacked the
administration's "creation of yet
another deliberating body" and
said minorities are "tired of
committees, discussions and
promises."
This prompts me to suspect
that complaints about not
"getting heard." in this case at
least, actually are frustrations
over an administration's
unwillingness to incorporate
certain arguments into its
decision, rather than over a

refusal to receive input at all.
Then there's the question of
"violence." Why is it that
forcible occupations only
become "violent" when
ostensibly legitimate authorities
seek to evict the occupiers from
their unlawful positions?
Use Of Force
Reports from Brown
consistently noted that the
administration had "renounced
any use of force" to end the
"non-violent" takeover. What of
the use of force which began the
occupation? If I should plant my
body in someone's living room
and refuse to move, I'd certainly
consider that an act of "force."
Finally, considering the
indisputable economic fact that
expenditures are outrunning
revenues at most universities,
what alternative cuts are
suggested by the occupiers in
order to save their favored
programs?
As the New York Times
noted Sunday, lucrative
minority aid payments and
generally expensive remedial and
tutorial programs for these same
students often are the first to go
in a time of economic crunch at
universities.
From none of the three
campuses hit by takeover
turmoil have I seen alternative
cuts offered — just "demands."
Instead of demanding no faculty
layoffs as they did at Brown, for
example, "protesters" could
have suggested elimination of
the tenure system which
currently is a costly roadblock
to the attainment of a more
balanced racial and sexual mix
on collegiate faculties.
But apparently the belief
exists that a free lunch will yet
come to pass — an expenditure
without cost.
I hope my prediction for

Stanford never comes true. I
hope students here are
intelligent enough to see all the
ramifications of seemingly
legitimate "demands."

California at Santa Barbara, the
days of student occupations of
college buildings were upon us
once more.
The issues were very much
like those now being debated in
some segments of the Stanford
community: financial aid
cutbacks (particularly for
minorities), faculty layoffs
(hitting hardest at untenured
women and minorities),
inclusion of more ethnic groups
into minority aid pools and the
phasing out of ethnic studies
programs.
Occupation Here?
Now, I wouldn't be surprised
to see some lingering dispute,
say between the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids and Students for
Equity, evolve into an
occupation of Old Union. I
would be saddened by such an
event — though I sense that
many would not.
Daily News Editor Stephen
Carter, for example, in his April
30 column, wrote that "one can
only be relieved — or perhaps,
enthused" by events such as the
Brown takeover.
A majority on the Daily
Editorial Board followed him
two days later with praise for
"effective and justifiable
responses to a secret university
decision-making process" at
Brown. "The actions at Brown
should be considered by
students at other universities
such as Stanford where students
have similar problems being
heard," the editorial concluded.
Getting 'Heard'
That phrase "being heard"
troubles me, as do two other
of the recent

confrontations:
—what is the meaning of the
word "violence"?
—what are the alternatives
offered by the occupying groups
to the cutting back of programs
they deem worthy?
First, the question of student
input. The Daily editorialized
that the Brown occupation "is a
good example of a situation
when students needed to take
militant action in order to have a
voice in a university decision
making process" (my emphasis).

I wonder if the Daily
Editorial Board is aware of the
particulars of any advisory
committee system at Brown
which might have broached the
issues in dispute. I'm not, so I
won't accuse the Brown
administration of making
"drastic budget cutbacks
without any student input," as
the editorial did.
False Complaints?
Indeed, an editorial in the
Brown Daily Herald the day of
the occupation attacked the
administration's "creation of yet
another deliberating body" and
said minorities are "tired of
committees, discussions and
promises."
This prompts me to suspect
that complaints about not
"getting heard." in this case at
least, actually are frustrations
over an administration's
unwillingness to incorporate
certain arguments into its
decision, rather than over a

refusal to receive input at all.
Then there's the question of
"violence." Why is it that
forcible occupations only
become "violent" when
ostensibly legitimate authorities
seek to evict the occupiers from
their unlawful positions?
Use Of Force
Reports from Brown
consistently noted that the
administration had "renounced
any use of force" to end the
"non-violent" takeover. What of
the use of force which began the
occupation? If I should plant my
body in someone's living room
and refuse to move, I'd certainly
consider that an act of "force."
Finally, considering the
indisputable economic fact that
expenditures are outrunning
revenues at most universities,
what alternative cuts are
suggested by the occupiers in
order to save their favored
programs?
As the New York Times
noted Sunday, lucrative
minority aid payments and
generally expensive remedial and
tutorial programs for these same
students often are the first to go
in a time of economic crunch at
universities.
From none of the three
campuses hit by takeover
turmoil have I seen alternative
cuts offered — just "demands."
Instead of demanding no faculty
layoffs as they did at Brown, for
example, "protesters" could
have suggested elimination of
the tenure system which
currently is a costly roadblock
to the attainment of a more
balanced racial and sexual mix
on collegiate faculties.
But apparently the belief
exists that a free lunch will yet
come to pass — an expenditure
without cost.
I hope my prediction for

Stanford never comes true. I
hope students here are
intelligent enough to see all the
ramifications of seemingly
legitimate "demands."
