Lagunita Reminders

Editor:
With the advent of the
warmer weather, many people
are heading to Lake Lagunita for
recreation. These reminders,
therefore, are timely:
—Cowell Health Service tells
me that Lake Lag is notorious
for causing infections, so never
swim with an open cut. I speak
from experience.
—' There are some people who
cruise the banks looking for
valuables belonging to
swimmers, so leave your watch,
wallet, etc. in your room, not on
the lakeshore.
—Many people less courteous
than the rest of us have been
turning the banks of the lake
into a garbage dump. Why is it
that it's easier to carry a case of
full beer bottles than a case of
empties? We can all help by
removing one more piece of
trash than we bring.
A little extra care can make
the spring more enjoyable for
all.
