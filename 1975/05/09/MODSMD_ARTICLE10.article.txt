# Vote For Residentialists
## 
### 
Much is at stake in this coming Tuesday's Palo
Alto City Council selection. The principal issue in
the campaign has been the decade-old controversy
over how much more the city should be
developed.
Standing firmly against uncontrolled or
unreasoned growth is a slate of four candidates
supported by the "residentialist" Association for
a Balanced Community (ABC). These four
candidates — incumbents Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson and Richard Rosenbaum, and
challenger Larry Klein — merit election.
Normally, we would not endorse a candidate
simply because he or she happens to be supported
by a particular party or organization. But Palo
Alto is not a normal city, and this is not a normal
election.
ABC-supported Council members have held a
precarious 5-4 majority on the Council since
1971. The seats held by Kirke Comstock and
Byron Sher are secure this year, but if even one of
the residentialist incumbents is defeated next
Tuesday, control of the Council would fall again
to the "establishment" forces represented by the
Palo Alto '75 (PA7S) group. This must not
happen.
A careful examination of the backgrounds and
supporters of the PA7S candidates proves very
revealing.
Incumbent Roy Clay, a management
consulting executive, is a long-time friend of the
area's real estate interests. It's no accident that his

Jim Wascher

office is at the top of Palo Alto's tallest building
— which also happens to house a leading local real
estate firm.
PA7S challenger Scott Carey is a counsel and
manager of commercial and industrial sales and
rentals for — you guessed it — a major real estate
firm. Carey's firm planned the so-called
"Superblock" high-rise development which
environment-conscious voters vetoed four years
ago.
The other two PA7S candidates, Anne
Witherspoon and Fred Eyerly. both have a record
of supporting such undesirable projects as
development of the foothills.
The PA7S candidates charge that the
development issue is merely a smokescreen
designed to make Palo Altans ignore the ABC
Council members' "bloc voting." They do not
mention that the four "establishment" members
of the Council vote as a bloc just as often as the
residentialists do.
They also neglect to point out 'that the
residentialist bloc, if left intact, will continue to
ensure that Palo Alto remains a pleasant
community, unspoiled by construction of too
many high-rises, freeways and industrial
complexes. Elect Pearson, Henderson,
Rosenbaum and Klein.

1971. The seats held by Kirke Comstock and
Byron Sher are secure this year, but if even one of
the residentialist incumbents is defeated next
Tuesday, control of the Council would fall again
to the "establishment" forces represented by the
Palo Alto '75 (PA7S) group. This must not
happen.
A careful examination of the backgrounds and
supporters of the PA7S candidates proves very
revealing.
Incumbent Roy Clay, a management
consulting executive, is a long-time friend of the
area's real estate interests. It's no accident that his

Jim Wascher

office is at the top of Palo Alto's tallest building
— which also happens to house a leading local real
estate firm.
PA7S challenger Scott Carey is a counsel and
manager of commercial and industrial sales and
rentals for — you guessed it — a major real estate
firm. Carey's firm planned the so-called
"Superblock" high-rise development which
environment-conscious voters vetoed four years
ago.
The other two PA7S candidates, Anne
Witherspoon and Fred Eyerly. both have a record
of supporting such undesirable projects as
development of the foothills.
The PA7S candidates charge that the
development issue is merely a smokescreen
designed to make Palo Altans ignore the ABC
Council members' "bloc voting." They do not
mention that the four "establishment" members
of the Council vote as a bloc just as often as the
residentialists do.
They also neglect to point out 'that the
residentialist bloc, if left intact, will continue to
ensure that Palo Alto remains a pleasant
community, unspoiled by construction of too
many high-rises, freeways and industrial
complexes. Elect Pearson, Henderson,
Rosenbaum and Klein.

Much is at stake in this coming Tuesday's Palo
Alto City Council selection. The principal issue in
the campaign has been the decade-old controversy
over how much more the city should be
developed.
Standing firmly against uncontrolled or
unreasoned growth is a slate of four candidates
supported by the "residentialist" Association for
a Balanced Community (ABC). These four
candidates — incumbents Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson and Richard Rosenbaum, and
challenger Larry Klein — merit election.
Normally, we would not endorse a candidate
simply because he or she happens to be supported
by a particular party or organization. But Palo
Alto is not a normal city, and this is not a normal
election.
ABC-supported Council members have held a
precarious 5-4 majority on the Council since
1971. The seats held by Kirke Comstock and
Byron Sher are secure this year, but if even one of
the residentialist incumbents is defeated next
Tuesday, control of the Council would fall again
to the "establishment" forces represented by the
Palo Alto '75 (PA7S) group. This must not
happen.
