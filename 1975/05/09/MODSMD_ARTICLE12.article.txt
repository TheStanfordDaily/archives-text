# Sexist Ads Degrade Women
## 
### Susan Luttner 
"Why can't a woman make a good
daiquiri?"
The current feminist movement has been
with us for several years now. Even
Stanford has an affirmative action program,
and no company with any concern for
public relations will claim that men make
better executives.
So why does the advertising industry
continue to provide sexist role models and
exploit women's bodies in its attempts to
make the public overconsume?
Maybe because cute put-downs make
easily read advertising copy. People can
smile indulgently when Parker urges men to
"buy her a new pen to unbalance her
checkbook with."
Given the material injustices being
fought by the feminist movement, carping
about sexist advertising verges on quibbling.
But the modeling and socializing effects of
these advertisements cannot be ignored.
Offensive TV Ads
Television, by far the worst offender,
teaches children how to dress, play, spell
and behave. Broadcasting magazine brags
that an average child has viewed 4000 hours
of television by the time she enters
kindergarten.
In these four years, the child has met
such infamous characters as the Cheerios
Kid, who saves helpless Sue at the last
moment in every commercial. Sue never
seems to find the strength to fight her own
battles, so the Kid performs his sex role
faithfully every .Saturday morning for
millions of children.
Then, in the adult realm, television
advertisements allot all housework to
women. When a beautiful young woman
notices "ring around the collar" of a male

party guest, the entire crowd glares
accusingly at the embarrassed wife. The
message is obvious: she is a failure as a wife
and a woman because she has allowed her
husband to appear in public with dirty
collars.

Scores of newlyweds worry endlessly
when their husbands refuse a second cup of
coffee. It never occurs to these women to
let the men make their own coffee; instead
Mrs. Olson saves their marriages by
recommending the proper brand.
Stinking Messages
These messages are so persistent that I
have to conclude the companies are serious.
Insulting both my intelligence and my
values, they try to convince women about
dirt they can't see and odors they can't
smell.
At a time when more and more couples
are trying to simplify housework and share
chores, the advertising industry multiplies
the work to be done and usually tells the
woman to do it.
Even the "progressive" advertisements
continue to allocate housework to working
women. "As a businesswoman with my own
model agency in New York City," Barbara
Stone appreciates how simple Centura
Dinnerware is for her cooking and

entertaining chores. Although I appreciate
this recognition that some women do work,
I wish advertisers would realize that their
products are not exclusively for women.
Sex Sells, Too
Instead of providing poor role models,
some advertisements exploit women's
bodies to sell to men. Black Velvet and
Benson & Hedges have been exposing more
and more skin lately — an effective
attention-getting technique.
These ads pair beautiful women with the
product. I can reach only two conclusions
from this juxtaposition: either women are
supposed to be so impressed by a man's
brand of cigarette that they fall at his feet;
or a man of distinction appears with only
the proper accessories, in women as well as
in liquor.
Even this subtlety is missed by
automobile and electric component
advertisers. How many beautiful women in
hot pants have draped themselves over tires
for the sake of the presumably male buyer?
As long as advertisers think they can sell
their product with this type of exploitation,
they will continue to bombard us with it.
The first step in our defense is to refuse to
buy products which have sexist advertising
campaigns.
Beyond that, we are left with the all-time
favorite consumer response, letter-writing.
The people at Birds Eye frozen vegetables
(the first vegetables a husband might even
notice) were so grateful for input that they
sent me a "no-strings" coupon for a dollar's
worth of vegetables. Of course, they haven't
changed their campaign yet, but they might
listen if they heard from more people.

brand of cigarette that they fall at his feet;
or a man of distinction appears with only
the proper accessories, in women as well as
in liquor.
Even this subtlety is missed by
automobile and electric component
advertisers. How many beautiful women in
hot pants have draped themselves over tires
for the sake of the presumably male buyer?
As long as advertisers think they can sell
their product with this type of exploitation,
they will continue to bombard us with it.
The first step in our defense is to refuse to
buy products which have sexist advertising
campaigns.
Beyond that, we are left with the all-time
favorite consumer response, letter-writing.
The people at Birds Eye frozen vegetables
(the first vegetables a husband might even
notice) were so grateful for input that they
sent me a "no-strings" coupon for a dollar's
worth of vegetables. Of course, they haven't
changed their campaign yet, but they might
listen if they heard from more people.

"Why can't a woman make a good
daiquiri?"
The current feminist movement has been
with us for several years now. Even
Stanford has an affirmative action program,
and no company with any concern for
public relations will claim that men make
better executives.
So why does the advertising industry
continue to provide sexist role models and
exploit women's bodies in its attempts to
make the public overconsume?
Maybe because cute put-downs make
easily read advertising copy. People can
smile indulgently when Parker urges men to
"buy her a new pen to unbalance her
checkbook with."
Given the material injustices being
fought by the feminist movement, carping
about sexist advertising verges on quibbling.
But the modeling and socializing effects of
these advertisements cannot be ignored.
Offensive TV Ads
Television, by far the worst offender,
teaches children how to dress, play, spell
and behave. Broadcasting magazine brags
that an average child has viewed 4000 hours
of television by the time she enters
kindergarten.
In these four years, the child has met
such infamous characters as the Cheerios
Kid, who saves helpless Sue at the last
moment in every commercial. Sue never
seems to find the strength to fight her own
battles, so the Kid performs his sex role
faithfully every .Saturday morning for
millions of children.
Then, in the adult realm, television
advertisements allot all housework to
women. When a beautiful young woman
notices "ring around the collar" of a male

party guest, the entire crowd glares
accusingly at the embarrassed wife. The
message is obvious: she is a failure as a wife
and a woman because she has allowed her
husband to appear in public with dirty
collars.

Scores of newlyweds worry endlessly
when their husbands refuse a second cup of
coffee. It never occurs to these women to
let the men make their own coffee; instead
Mrs. Olson saves their marriages by
recommending the proper brand.
Stinking Messages
These messages are so persistent that I
have to conclude the companies are serious.
Insulting both my intelligence and my
values, they try to convince women about
dirt they can't see and odors they can't
smell.
At a time when more and more couples
are trying to simplify housework and share
chores, the advertising industry multiplies
the work to be done and usually tells the
woman to do it.
Even the "progressive" advertisements
continue to allocate housework to working
women. "As a businesswoman with my own
model agency in New York City," Barbara
Stone appreciates how simple Centura
Dinnerware is for her cooking and

entertaining chores. Although I appreciate
this recognition that some women do work,
I wish advertisers would realize that their
products are not exclusively for women.
Sex Sells, Too
Instead of providing poor role models,
some advertisements exploit women's
bodies to sell to men. Black Velvet and
Benson & Hedges have been exposing more
and more skin lately — an effective
attention-getting technique.
These ads pair beautiful women with the
product. I can reach only two conclusions
from this juxtaposition: either women are
supposed to be so impressed by a man's
brand of cigarette that they fall at his feet;
or a man of distinction appears with only
the proper accessories, in women as well as
in liquor.
