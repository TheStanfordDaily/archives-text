O.i First-Year Languages
Editor:
The Faculty Senate is
currently deliberating a proposal
that would tend to introduce
more structure to the humanities
curriculum through establishing
a sequence of courses to be
offered by the various
departments. One of the more
controversial features of the
proposal is that it would deny
first-year language courses
recognition toward the
fulfillment of the area
distribution requirement in the
humanities.
There is little disagreement
among humanists as to the value
of foreign language study. It is,
therefore, ironic that at the very
time deliberations are held
concerning ways to introduce
more structure to the academic
curriculum, there is a tendency
to undermine the most
structured discipline of all.
Obviously there can be no
second-year foreign language
course without the proper
first-year foundation.
Now that the foreign
language requirement has been
dropped in schools throughout
the country, we can no longer
expect students to come
prepared with such training from
the high schools. The proposed
reform would further delay
exposure to foreign language
study and make access to the
advanced levels of language
study correspondingly difficult.
The entire college language
curriculum would be imperiled
by the proposed alteration of
the first year.
First-year language courses, at
least in the French Department,
deal with grammar, vocabulary
and pronunciation. So do
advanced language courses.
But they are also concerned
with many other questions. The
French language is inseparable
from a cultural tradition that is
reflected in all levels of language
study.

Prophetic Ministry Goes On
Editor:
Jon Bigelow's reporting of
my ministry (Daily, April 17)
quoted the basic content of my
statements which stressed my
involvement in Third World
issues.
There is one major
inaccuracy, however, that my
''prophetic ministry left the
campus last month when she was
fired by St. Ann's Catholic
Church in Palo Alto ..." Since
my firing, my ministry has
become more active and more
committed at Stanford.
For those who have the
impression that my ministry has
stopped and have wondered if
I'm still alive, I hope this
information will be helpful.
Also, I can be reached through
the United Campus Ministry.
