# The 						Holocaust: A Generation After
## 
### 
May 1975 marks the 30th
anniversary of the end of the
Holocaust.
For the average Daily reader,
the word "holocaust" may
connotate a general
conflagration or catastrophe; for
us Jews, it clutches at our hearts
and resonates in our nerves, for
it implies the systematic
destruction of three-quarters of
European and two-fifths of
world Jewrv from 1939-45.

It also conveys the nightmare
images and historical realities of
slow starvation in the ghettos of
eastern Europe, mass machine
gunnings by the German mobile
murder units known as the
Einsatzkommandos, and the
gassings in the death camps of
Treblinka, Maidenak, Auschwitz,
and others. It is 30 years, a full
generation, since the liberation
of those camps.
We do not know how to talk
about the Holocaust, for as the
philosopher and novelist Arthur
A. Cohen recently wrote, "There
is something about the nature of
thought which is alien to the
enormity of the death-camps.'"
Wider Implications
If it is tempting or expedient
to view the Holocaust as a
disaster of German or Jewish
history, so much more is
involved when one considers the
Nazis' active collaborators
throughout Europe or their
accomplices in silence in
London, Washington, the
Vatican, and elsewhere (see for
example Arthur A. Morse's
While Six Million Died or Saul
Friedlander's Pius XII and the
Jews).
"Mankind." "the civilized
world." "the non-fascist West"
or whatever else one wishes to
call it had been silent during
supreme moments of this
century's dehumanization and
slaughter before - during the
Turkish slaughter of the
Armenians in 1915 or the
Stalinist purges of the 1930s to
name two outstanding instances
— but never had that silence
been so nearly and so
self-incriminatingly unanimous
for so wide and systematic an
evil.
The Holocaust remains a stain
of shame which has, or should

have, an inseparable part of the
fabric of our lives and
consciousness, become a stain
which cannot be purged.
God In Eclipse?
Even less do we know
whether and how to believe after
the Holocaust. If some of us
believed, in our fragile
post-Enlightment way, in a God
who had and would again
intervene in history to in some
way redeem it, we now confront
a God seemingly "in eclipse," to
use Martin Buber's phrase, a God
apart from, perhaps indifferent
to, and possibly even indicted by
human suffering and yearning
within history.
Least of all do we know how
to remember. Is there a
"conspiracy of silence" with
regard to the Holocaust, which is
almost exclusively and often
callously invoked to make
analogies with Israel's plight?
Certainly, it is one indication
of the moral and intellectual
lassitude of an institution like
.Stanford that no one — in any
department — has seen fit to
commemorate the 30th
anniversary of the liberation of
the death camps. But I think
that this non-recognition is not
willed, insensitive forgetfulness.
but a neglect born from
ignorance and despair.
For we are not taught about
the Holocaust and do not talk
about it because we do not
know how, because words,
rationality, analyses can only
approach the Holocaust's factual
fringes. In Cohen's words, we are
dealing with something
''unman agable and
obdurate ... a continuous
scourage to memory and the
future of memory."
The Holocaust is so terribly
threatening because it threatens

to explode all our shibboleths
about man and "human nature,"
reason, civilization, and faith.
Still, in their shrouds of naked
silence, the anonymous dead
unanswerably indict and
challenge us from their mass
graves.
Only A Prelude?
Above all, there is this
nagging, haunting, horrible sense
that the Holocaust, unique
though it was, cannot be
consigned to history, but is a
kind of prelude.
Even as you read this,
millions, millions of children are
slowly starving amid worldwide
apathy, even as a generation ago
millions were killed amid the
same kind of apathy.

Maddeningly little has changed
since.
But then, what is "one
generation?" — a historical
eyewink. To retain our own
sanity, to muddle through our
lives somehow, we must think of
the Holocaust as history, as
something to be transcended and
largely dispensed with. But it
will neither go away nor let go
of us nearly so easily, for the
Holocaust is at the white hot
center of this cursed century's
history; it relentlessly beckons
even as it sears us, for it is the
fire right now.

self-incriminatingly unanimous

evil.

God In Eclipse?
Even less do we know
whether and how to believe after
the Holocaust. If some of us
believed, in our fragile
post-Enlightment way, in a God
who had and would again
intervene in history to in some
way redeem it, we now confront
a God seemingly "in eclipse," to
use Martin Buber's phrase, a God
apart from, perhaps indifferent
to, and possibly even indicted by
human suffering and yearning
within history.
Least of all do we know how
to remember. Is there a
"conspiracy of silence" with

almost exclusively and often
callously invoked to make
analogies with Israel's plight?
Certainly, it is one indication
of the moral and intellectual
lassitude of an institution like
.Stanford that no one — in any
department — has seen fit to
commemorate the 30th
anniversary of the liberation of
the death camps. But I think
that this non-recognition is not
willed, insensitive forgetfulness.

ignorance and despair.
For we are not taught about
the Holocaust and do not talk
about it because we do not
know how, because words,
rationality, analyses can only
approach the Holocaust's factual
fringes. In Cohen's words, we are
dealing with something
''unman agable and
obdurate ... a continuous
scourage to memory and the
future of memory."
The Holocaust is so terribly
threatening because it threatens

to explode all our shibboleths
about man and "human nature,"
reason, civilization, and faith.

silence, the anonymous dead
unanswerably indict and
challenge us from their mass
graves.
Only A Prelude?
Above all, there is this
nagging, haunting, horrible sense
that the Holocaust, unique
though it was, cannot be
consigned to history, but is a
kind of prelude.
Even as you read this,
millions, millions of children are
slowly starving amid worldwide
apathy, even as a generation ago
millions were killed amid the

But then, what is "one
generation?" — a historical
eyewink. To retain our own
sanity, to muddle through our
lives somehow, we must think of
the Holocaust as history, as
something to be transcended and
largely dispensed with. But it
will neither go away nor let go
of us nearly so easily, for the
Holocaust is at the white hot
center of this cursed century's
history; it relentlessly beckons
even as it sears us, for it is the
fire right now.

For the average Daily reader,
the word "holocaust" may
connotate a general
conflagration or catastrophe; for
us Jews, it clutches at our hearts
and resonates in our nerves, for
it implies the systematic
destruction of three-quarters of
European and two-fifths of
world Jewrv from 1939-45.

It also conveys the nightmare
images and historical realities of
slow starvation in the ghettos of
eastern Europe, mass machine
gunnings by the German mobile
murder units known as the
Einsatzkommandos, and the
gassings in the death camps of
Treblinka, Maidenak, Auschwitz,
and others. It is 30 years, a full
generation, since the liberation
of those camps.
We do not know how to talk
about the Holocaust, for as the
philosopher and novelist Arthur
A. Cohen recently wrote, "There
is something about the nature of

Wider Implications
If it is tempting or expedient
to view the Holocaust as a
disaster of German or Jewish
history, so much more is
involved when one considers the
Nazis' active collaborators
throughout Europe or their
accomplices in silence in
London, Washington, the
Vatican, and elsewhere (see for
example Arthur A. Morse's
While Six Million Died or Saul
Friedlander's Pius XII and the

Armenians in 1915 or the
Stalinist purges of the 1930s to

But then, what is "one
generation?" — a historical
eyewink. To retain our own
sanity, to muddle through our
lives somehow, we must think of
the Holocaust as history, as
something to be transcended and
largely dispensed with. But it
will neither go away nor let go
of us nearly so easily, for the
Holocaust is at the white hot
center of this cursed century's
history; it relentlessly beckons
even as it sears us, for it is the
fire right now.

May 1975 marks the 30th
anniversary of the end of the
Holocaust.
For the average Daily reader,
the word "holocaust" may
connotate a general
conflagration or catastrophe; for
us Jews, it clutches at our hearts
and resonates in our nerves, for
it implies the systematic
destruction of three-quarters of
European and two-fifths of
world Jewrv from 1939-45.

It also conveys the nightmare
images and historical realities of
slow starvation in the ghettos of
eastern Europe, mass machine
gunnings by the German mobile
murder units known as the
Einsatzkommandos, and the
gassings in the death camps of
Treblinka, Maidenak, Auschwitz,
and others. It is 30 years, a full
generation, since the liberation
of those camps.
We do not know how to talk
about the Holocaust, for as the
philosopher and novelist Arthur
A. Cohen recently wrote, "There
is something about the nature of
thought which is alien to the
enormity of the death-camps.'"
Wider Implications
If it is tempting or expedient
to view the Holocaust as a
disaster of German or Jewish
history, so much more is
involved when one considers the
Nazis' active collaborators
throughout Europe or their
accomplices in silence in
London, Washington, the
Vatican, and elsewhere (see for
example Arthur A. Morse's
While Six Million Died or Saul
Friedlander's Pius XII and the
Jews).
"Mankind." "the civilized
world." "the non-fascist West"
or whatever else one wishes to
call it had been silent during
supreme moments of this
century's dehumanization and
slaughter before - during the
Turkish slaughter of the
Armenians in 1915 or the
Stalinist purges of the 1930s to
name two outstanding instances
— but never had that silence
been so nearly and so
self-incriminatingly unanimous
for so wide and systematic an
evil.
The Holocaust remains a stain
of shame which has, or should

have, an inseparable part of the
fabric of our lives and
consciousness, become a stain
which cannot be purged.
God In Eclipse?
Even less do we know
whether and how to believe after
the Holocaust. If some of us
believed, in our fragile
post-Enlightment way, in a God
who had and would again
intervene in history to in some
way redeem it, we now confront
a God seemingly "in eclipse," to
use Martin Buber's phrase, a God
apart from, perhaps indifferent
to, and possibly even indicted by
human suffering and yearning
within history.
Least of all do we know how
to remember. Is there a
"conspiracy of silence" with
regard to the Holocaust, which is
almost exclusively and often
callously invoked to make
analogies with Israel's plight?
Certainly, it is one indication
of the moral and intellectual
lassitude of an institution like
.Stanford that no one — in any
department — has seen fit to
commemorate the 30th
anniversary of the liberation of
the death camps. But I think
that this non-recognition is not
willed, insensitive forgetfulness.
but a neglect born from
ignorance and despair.
For we are not taught about
the Holocaust and do not talk
about it because we do not
know how, because words,
rationality, analyses can only
approach the Holocaust's factual
fringes. In Cohen's words, we are
dealing with something
''unman agable and
obdurate ... a continuous
scourage to memory and the
future of memory."
The Holocaust is so terribly
threatening because it threatens

to explode all our shibboleths
about man and "human nature,"
reason, civilization, and faith.
Still, in their shrouds of naked
silence, the anonymous dead
unanswerably indict and
challenge us from their mass
graves.
