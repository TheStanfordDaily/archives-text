# P.A. Candidates: Superblocks Vs. Superblocs
## 
### FENTON JOHNSON 
Back in the '60s, voting in the Palo Alto
City Council elections was easier. Then, it was
a clear-cut case of "Residentialist" vs. the
"Establishment": the Residentialists favored
limited growth, preservation of open space,
and expanded social services; the
Establishment backed growth-oriented
businessmen who saw Palo Alto as the
financial, commercial, and medical center of
the mid-Peninsula.
Today, "controlled growth" is the favorite
phrase of all the candidates, and the traditional
Residentialist/Establishment lines have grown
fuzzy. Still, the direction of Palo Alto growth
is the central issue, blurred as it may be with
electioneering.
Founded in 1969 to oppose construction of
an 18-story hospital near the existing Palo Alto
Medical Center, the Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC) sponsors the Residentialist
slate. This year, incumbents Enid Pearson,
Dick Rosenbaum, Alan Henderson, and

newcomer Larry Klein divide their emphasis
between accusing their opponents of being
growth-oriented, and pointing to the
accomplishments of the incumbents' years on
the council.
Roy Clay, another incumbent, heads the
Establishment slate, PA'75 with challengers
Anne Witherspoon, Scott Carey, and Fred
Eyerly. Dismissing the growth issue as an "old
ghost," they attack the ABC incumbents for
"bloc voting" in city council votes.
One Bridge Backer
Certainly, the PA '75 slate is more
growth-oriented than their opponents. Of the
incumbent candidates, Clay alone supports a
new Dumbarton Bridge. He says,"The impact
of a new Dumbarton Bridge has been distorted
beyond reason."
Carey's real-estate firm, Cornish and Carey,
designed a plan to develop a two-block portion
of downtown Palo Aito into a "Superblock"
complex of two 11-story office buildings
and an underground garage. Though Carey

calls the complex (defeated by an
ABC-sponsored campaign) "a dead issue," it is
still alive, in voters' memories and the ABC
campaign literature.
Evidently realizing the disadvantages of
being on the defensive, PA'75 candidates have
tried to separate themselves from the
"Establishment" label, preferring to avoid
completely the discussion of growth as an
issue. Instead, they accuse their opponents of
lowering the quality and responsiveness of city
government by "bloc voting."
While the ABC candidates have tended to

vote together, the seriousness of the "bloc
vote" issue is questionable. As ABC candidate
Klein pointed out, "There's a logical
inconsistency in accusing one side of a 5-4 vote
of bloc voting, when the other side votes as a
bloc, too."
An investigation of city council meeting
minutes shows that the majority of council
votes are unanimous. On major questions,
where philosophical differences make
themselves apparent, the ABC incumbents
(especially Pearson and Henderson) tended to
vote together, but switchovers from both sides
occurred so often that establishing a definite

trend was nearly impossible.
It is difficult to argue with the list of
council accomplishments in the last four years.
ABC candidates can (and do) point to the
open zoning of the foothills, the 50 foot
height ceiling on buildings, and the retention
of the Baylands Nature Preserve as steps
toward "limiting growth."
The voter's view of these accomplishments
might depend on individual definitions of
"limited growth." PA '75 — the
"Establishment"— represents "big limited
growth"; ABC — the "Residentialists" —
represents "small limited growth."

Roy Clay, another incumbent, heads the
Establishment slate, PA'75 with challengers
Anne Witherspoon, Scott Carey, and Fred
Eyerly. Dismissing the growth issue as an "old
ghost," they attack the ABC incumbents for
"bloc voting" in city council votes.
One Bridge Backer
Certainly, the PA '75 slate is more
growth-oriented than their opponents. Of the
incumbent candidates, Clay alone supports a
new Dumbarton Bridge. He says,"The impact
of a new Dumbarton Bridge has been distorted
beyond reason."
Carey's real-estate firm, Cornish and Carey,
designed a plan to develop a two-block portion
of downtown Palo Aito into a "Superblock"
complex of two 11-story office buildings
and an underground garage. Though Carey

calls the complex (defeated by an
ABC-sponsored campaign) "a dead issue," it is
still alive, in voters' memories and the ABC
campaign literature.
Evidently realizing the disadvantages of
being on the defensive, PA'75 candidates have
tried to separate themselves from the
"Establishment" label, preferring to avoid
completely the discussion of growth as an
issue. Instead, they accuse their opponents of
lowering the quality and responsiveness of city
government by "bloc voting."
While the ABC candidates have tended to

vote together, the seriousness of the "bloc
vote" issue is questionable. As ABC candidate
Klein pointed out, "There's a logical
inconsistency in accusing one side of a 5-4 vote
of bloc voting, when the other side votes as a
bloc, too."
An investigation of city council meeting
minutes shows that the majority of council
votes are unanimous. On major questions,
where philosophical differences make
themselves apparent, the ABC incumbents
(especially Pearson and Henderson) tended to
vote together, but switchovers from both sides
occurred so often that establishing a definite

trend was nearly impossible.
It is difficult to argue with the list of
council accomplishments in the last four years.
ABC candidates can (and do) point to the
open zoning of the foothills, the 50 foot
height ceiling on buildings, and the retention
of the Baylands Nature Preserve as steps
toward "limiting growth."
The voter's view of these accomplishments
might depend on individual definitions of
"limited growth." PA '75 — the
"Establishment"— represents "big limited
growth"; ABC — the "Residentialists" —
represents "small limited growth."
Back in the '60s, voting in the Palo Alto
City Council elections was easier. Then, it was
a clear-cut case of "Residentialist" vs. the
"Establishment": the Residentialists favored
limited growth, preservation of open space,
and expanded social services; the
Establishment backed growth-oriented
businessmen who saw Palo Alto as the
financial, commercial, and medical center of
the mid-Peninsula.
Today, "controlled growth" is the favorite
phrase of all the candidates, and the traditional
Residentialist/Establishment lines have grown
fuzzy. Still, the direction of Palo Alto growth
is the central issue, blurred as it may be with
electioneering.
Founded in 1969 to oppose construction of
an 18-story hospital near the existing Palo Alto
Medical Center, the Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC) sponsors the Residentialist
slate. This year, incumbents Enid Pearson,
Dick Rosenbaum, Alan Henderson, and

newcomer Larry Klein divide their emphasis
between accusing their opponents of being
growth-oriented, and pointing to the
accomplishments of the incumbents' years on
the council.
