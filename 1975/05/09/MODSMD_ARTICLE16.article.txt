# Do Closed Roads Make Good Neighbors?
## Lasuen Protest Becomes A Block Party 
### KATHY BATTS 
The four houses that sit on Lasuen Mall are
a diverse lot.
They suffer a great deal from stereotyping:
Columbae is where the "rads" live, Sigma Chi
is your basic frat, Storey is a "dolly" house,
and Lathrop requires a low draw number for
the privilege of living in the tight-knit coed
house.
The majestic white houses are located on
the lower end of the Row, on a quiet street,
usually closed to traffic.
"I've always thought there was so much
potential for that block," said Hugh Lusted, a
former Sigma Chi resident. "You know —
barbeques, keggers, etc. It's the perfect spot.
But nothing ever really got going last year."
The houses tend to keep to themselves.
There has been little interaction among them,
mainly because most residents feel they have
little in common with their neighbors.
Last week, a common cause brought them
together, although it took two "outsiders"
from the nearby Florence Moore dorms to
accomplish what neighbors had never tried.
As the new Law School was being
festooned with such finishing touches as a
parking lot, Old Lane A, which runs behind
Lathrop and Columbae, was closed for
repaving. As a temporary access road, Lasuen
was opened for three weeks to car traffic to
the post office and bookstore. Nobody on
Lasuen Mall really liked the idea, but no one
got together to do anything about it either.

And then the accidents began to occur.
Two different cars uprooted two different
streetlamps within 24 hours, leaving two-thirds
of the street in near-total darkness at night.
And Paul Navar, a freshman in Faisan, was hit
by a car while bicycling to class.
It was Navar's Faisan friends, Bruce Blakely
and Rusty Schwartz, who went to the four
houses and organized the road blockade May
1.
The lunchtime demonstration looked more
like a picnic. Several people joked that it was
the first time Sigma Chi and Columbae were
on the same side of an issue.
"We really liked getting together like that,"
Columbae RA Debbi Silton commented. "It
[the road] was something Columbae felt very
strongly about."
'Frat Mentality'
Sigma Chi RA Gary Desmet was frank
about his house's involvement. "We're very
possessive about the street — call it your basic
frat mentality — and didn't mind getting it
closed again.
"It was an ego trip for the guys, too, I
think, to get the publicity. But let's face it. If
it had been any other time than lunchtime,
Sigma Chi probably wouldn't have been out
there — but Columbae would have."
Talk now has turned to socializing between
the houses. Block parties and other inter-house
mixers have been suggested.
"I really think it would be great for

everyone to get together," Silton said. "Our
biggest problem is stereotyping. If everyone
got to know each other better, I think some of
the barriers would disappear. And people
would find that no one really quite fits the
image their house may reflect."
Lathrop RA Dave Garvin was not that
optimistic. "It wasn't that big a deal for my
house." he said. "We had maybe four people at

that demonstration.
"The response from Lathrop to the whole
thing wasn't that large. It was just a brief
episode."
But that "brief episode" had some big
implications. Students forced police action
which had been planned for at at least four
days later. Police Chief Marvin Herrington says
the road will be closed permanently.

And then the accidents began to occur.
Two different cars uprooted two different
streetlamps within 24 hours, leaving two-thirds
of the street in near-total darkness at night.
And Paul Navar, a freshman in Faisan, was hit
by a car while bicycling to class.
It was Navar's Faisan friends, Bruce Blakely
and Rusty Schwartz, who went to the four
houses and organized the road blockade May
1.
The lunchtime demonstration looked more
like a picnic. Several people joked that it was
the first time Sigma Chi and Columbae were
on the same side of an issue.
"We really liked getting together like that,"
Columbae RA Debbi Silton commented. "It
[the road] was something Columbae felt very
strongly about."
'Frat Mentality'
Sigma Chi RA Gary Desmet was frank
about his house's involvement. "We're very
possessive about the street — call it your basic
frat mentality — and didn't mind getting it
closed again.
"It was an ego trip for the guys, too, I
think, to get the publicity. But let's face it. If
it had been any other time than lunchtime,
Sigma Chi probably wouldn't have been out
there — but Columbae would have."
Talk now has turned to socializing between
the houses. Block parties and other inter-house
mixers have been suggested.
"I really think it would be great for

everyone to get together," Silton said. "Our
biggest problem is stereotyping. If everyone
got to know each other better, I think some of
the barriers would disappear. And people
would find that no one really quite fits the
image their house may reflect."
Lathrop RA Dave Garvin was not that
optimistic. "It wasn't that big a deal for my
house." he said. "We had maybe four people at

that demonstration.
"The response from Lathrop to the whole
thing wasn't that large. It was just a brief
episode."
But that "brief episode" had some big
implications. Students forced police action
which had been planned for at at least four
days later. Police Chief Marvin Herrington says
the road will be closed permanently.

WHY DON'T WE DO IT ON THE ROW?—Residents of the Lasuen Mall houses broke out of
their stereotypes last Friday to protest the opening of the street to traffic. The closed road may
be the future site of inter-house get-togethers.
The four houses that sit on Lasuen Mall are
a diverse lot.
They suffer a great deal from stereotyping:
Columbae is where the "rads" live, Sigma Chi
is your basic frat, Storey is a "dolly" house,
and Lathrop requires a low draw number for
the privilege of living in the tight-knit coed
house.
The majestic white houses are located on
the lower end of the Row, on a quiet street,
usually closed to traffic.
"I've always thought there was so much
potential for that block," said Hugh Lusted, a
former Sigma Chi resident. "You know —
barbeques, keggers, etc. It's the perfect spot.
But nothing ever really got going last year."
The houses tend to keep to themselves.
There has been little interaction among them,
mainly because most residents feel they have
little in common with their neighbors.
Last week, a common cause brought them
together, although it took two "outsiders"
from the nearby Florence Moore dorms to
accomplish what neighbors had never tried.
As the new Law School was being
festooned with such finishing touches as a
parking lot, Old Lane A, which runs behind
Lathrop and Columbae, was closed for
repaving. As a temporary access road, Lasuen
was opened for three weeks to car traffic to
the post office and bookstore. Nobody on
Lasuen Mall really liked the idea, but no one
got together to do anything about it either.

And then the accidents began to occur.
