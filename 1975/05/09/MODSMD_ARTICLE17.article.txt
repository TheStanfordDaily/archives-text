# University Computer Time Poachers Prey On 'Insecure' Keyword System
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The piracy of the first round draw results
brings to light some of the problems with the
University's system of computer processing.
In the case of the housing assignment
printout, the culprit was less the computer
system than the method in which the program
was being processed, stated Dana (an assumed
name) one of the persons who intercepted the
results. None of the individuals associated with
the project wished to be referred to by their
real names.
Senior Richard Wales, who was in charge of
computer processing for the draw, had
neglected to follow all the warnings advocated
by the computer officials, Dana said. Rather
than storing his data sets on private discs,
Wales had used public data files, accessible to
anyone knowing the proper account number
and keyword, he explained.
Consequently, Dana and his friends merely
accessed the housing program from one of

their own programs and saved the results under
a personal account number.
Apart from this oversight, Wales should
have done his processing on the IBM computer
located at Encina Hall, said Leslie. Here, the
file would not have been accessible to most
students. The Encina computer is reserved
solely for University administrative work.
Dana also noted that the large amount of
time used to process the program madp it
easier for unauthorized persons to obtain the
results.
"They used an awful lot of computer time
on the housing draw," Dana said. "They were
running jobs constantly . .. They made a much
bigger production of it than it needed to be,
making it much easier to notice and catch the
program."
Wales refused comment on the charges that
he had used insufficiently secure files.
However, he defended his use of computer
time, saying that it "was not something that I

had much control over."
Experienced computer users say that
stealing files such as the housing assignments
actually is only a small part of the clandestine
activities that are done on computer facilities.
The biggest problem falls under the general
classification of "poaching" — using an
account that belongs to someone else.
One experienced poacher estimated that
anywhere from $10,000-$lOO,OOO worth of
this illegal activity is done -each year. This
poacher also ventured the guess that on a
relatively calm night as much as 25 percent of
computer usage is poaching.
Many methods are used to poach
computer accounts. The easiest way is to
secure an account's keyword, Dana said,
explaining that "once you have the keyword
you can do about anything."
A common poaching technique is to use
accounts which have not yet been assigned
keywords.
One merely needs to set a keyword for a
newly opened class account, or one can use the
public terminal to find an account that doesn't
have a keyword (many of them don't) and set
his own.
"That is one of the simplest ways for
people to start poaching," Frank noted. "The
whole keyword system is very insecure."
For more experienced programmers, it may
be possible to secure a printout of all the
account numbers and their keywords, Dana
said.
Until an addition was made to the security
checks of the computer system about two
weeks ago, one could access the keyword file
directly, he said.
The computer center now requires a special
password to use the keyword file, Dana
explained.
"They have set it up to restrict access," ho
said. He declined to state, however, whether he
had been able to crack this new system.
Another method of finding a keyword is
simply to call the accounting department,
where a list of users' accounts and their
corresponding keywords are kept, and say that
you have forgotten the keyword for an account
(which actually isn't yours).
Ron Jamtgaard, director of the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP) said
that much of the poaching is not a result of
expert programmers sneaking into the system,
but is a result of students being careless with
confidential information such as keywords.
"We do have some people who are now
paying cash for the poaching they have done,"
Jamtgaard noted, "or they work it out at the
computer center."
He predicted that in the future an
increasing number of poachers would be
reported to the district attorney. Poaching is
regarded just like any other theft, Jamtgaard
said.

account numbers and their keywords, Dana
said.
Until an addition was made to the security
checks of the computer system about two
weeks ago, one could access the keyword file
directly, he said.
The computer center now requires a special
password to use the keyword file, Dana
explained.
"They have set it up to restrict access," ho
said. He declined to state, however, whether he
had been able to crack this new system.
Another method of finding a keyword is
simply to call the accounting department,
where a list of users' accounts and their
corresponding keywords are kept, and say that
you have forgotten the keyword for an account
(which actually isn't yours).
Ron Jamtgaard, director of the Stanford
Center for Information Processing (SCIP) said
that much of the poaching is not a result of
expert programmers sneaking into the system,
but is a result of students being careless with
confidential information such as keywords.
"We do have some people who are now
paying cash for the poaching they have done,"
Jamtgaard noted, "or they work it out at the
computer center."
He predicted that in the future an
increasing number of poachers would be
reported to the district attorney. Poaching is
regarded just like any other theft, Jamtgaard
said.
The piracy of the first round draw results
brings to light some of the problems with the
University's system of computer processing.
In the case of the housing assignment
printout, the culprit was less the computer
system than the method in which the program
was being processed, stated Dana (an assumed
name) one of the persons who intercepted the
results. None of the individuals associated with
the project wished to be referred to by their
real names.
Senior Richard Wales, who was in charge of
computer processing for the draw, had
neglected to follow all the warnings advocated
by the computer officials, Dana said. Rather
than storing his data sets on private discs,
Wales had used public data files, accessible to
anyone knowing the proper account number
and keyword, he explained.
Consequently, Dana and his friends merely
accessed the housing program from one of

their own programs and saved the results under
a personal account number.
Apart from this oversight, Wales should
have done his processing on the IBM computer
located at Encina Hall, said Leslie. Here, the
file would not have been accessible to most
students. The Encina computer is reserved
solely for University administrative work.
Dana also noted that the large amount of
time used to process the program madp it
easier for unauthorized persons to obtain the
results.
"They used an awful lot of computer time
on the housing draw," Dana said. "They were
running jobs constantly . .. They made a much
bigger production of it than it needed to be,
making it much easier to notice and catch the
program."
Wales refused comment on the charges that
he had used insufficiently secure files.
However, he defended his use of computer
time, saying that it "was not something that I

had much control over."
Experienced computer users say that
stealing files such as the housing assignments
actually is only a small part of the clandestine
activities that are done on computer facilities.
The biggest problem falls under the general
classification of "poaching" — using an
account that belongs to someone else.
One experienced poacher estimated that
anywhere from $10,000-$lOO,OOO worth of
this illegal activity is done -each year. This
poacher also ventured the guess that on a
relatively calm night as much as 25 percent of
computer usage is poaching.
Many methods are used to poach
computer accounts. The easiest way is to
secure an account's keyword, Dana said,
explaining that "once you have the keyword
you can do about anything."
A common poaching technique is to use
accounts which have not yet been assigned
keywords.
One merely needs to set a keyword for a
newly opened class account, or one can use the
public terminal to find an account that doesn't
have a keyword (many of them don't) and set
his own.
"That is one of the simplest ways for
people to start poaching," Frank noted. "The
whole keyword system is very insecure."
For more experienced programmers, it may
be possible to secure a printout of all the
account numbers and their keywords, Dana
said.
Until an addition was made to the security
checks of the computer system about two
weeks ago, one could access the keyword file
directly, he said.
The computer center now requires a special
