# Law Prof Lauds Rights For Women
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
"At the very moment when
;o many people despair of
inding even simple justice in the
courtroom, the women's
novement has made rather
imazing gains through the use of
;he law in a very short time."
Assoc Law Prof. Barbara Babcock
said Tuesday.
Speaking to a crowd of
approximately 50 at the
Graduate School of Business,
Babcock cited the 1971
legalization of abortion cases
(Roe us. Wade and Doe us.
Bolton) as examples of both the
revitalization and the success of
the renewed struggle of sex
equality.
Author o-f Sex
Discrimination; Causes and Legal
Remedies, Babcock said, "As
little as five years ago, it would
have seemed utterly unbelievable
to predict that the Supreme
Court would invalidate the
anti-abortion laws of each
state."
Though the outcome of the
recent abortion cases benefitted
doctors as well as women,
Babcock said that the
invalidation of states' laws has
"created a climate of opinion of
receptivity to the issues [of
women's equality |."
History Outlined
Briefly outlining the history
of the women's movement,
Babcock emphasized the
recurrence of such issues as

equal pay, biological limitations
and sex discrimination in
education which, she pointed
out, are still questioned today.
She remarked that these
issues, along with society's
stereotypes of "women's spheres
of influence" are the very issues
attacked by such founders of the
women's movement as Lucy
Stone, Lucretia Mott and others.
These women, many of
whom had been involved in
crusades against slavery, began
the women's movement,
"because they realized the
parallel between their own
condition and that of black
slavery," Babcock said.
Legal Successes
Babcock noted, however, the
speed with which many of
society's stereotypes recently
have been struck down in the
legal arena.
She cited as one of many
examples of recent legal
successes, the lower court
revocation of the mandatory
maternity leave policy. Under
this policy, women were forced
to leave school months in
advance of their expectancy date
and to remain away shortly after
the child was born. "This, I
think arose out of a feeling that
it was unseemly for pregnant
women to be around children,"
she said.

Babcock attributed recent
successes of the women's
movement to its focus on
litigation and social change and
to the women who are
themselves working in the legal
arena.
The national litigation
campaign which fought for the
legalization of abortion "was
both inspired and directed by
women, united in the idea that
there must be access to abortion
if women were to be truly
equal," she said.
