# Lowenstein Asks For Aid In Reopening RFK Probe
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
Former Rep. Allard Lowenstein
(D-N.Y.) pleaded with an audience of
Stanford students and professors
yesterday for their aid in reopening
the investigation of the assassination
of Robert Kennedy
Lowenstein, a former Stanford
dean of men, told an overflowing
Meyer Library Forum Room crowd of
his criticisms of the assassination
investigation conducted by the Los
Angeles Police Department.
Dr. Robert Joling, president of the
American Academy of Forensic
Scientists, appeared in support of
Lowenstein.
Lowenstein pointed to
discrepancies between eyewitness
reports of the shooting and Kennedy's
autopsy. According to the former,
Lowenstein said, Kennedy was shot
from the front by Sirhan Sirhan at a
distance of at least three feet.
The autopsy, however, said the
senator was hit from a distance of one
to three inches, Lowenstein added.
Bullets Don't Match
He also said that of the seven
bullets found at the murder scene, one

lodged in the stomach of a bystander
failed to match the others, leading
Lowenstein to doubt the LAPD's
assertion that it had been fired from
Sirhan's gun.
He further attacked this assertion
by citing a disparity between the
number of bullets that Sirhan's gun
could have shot (eight) and the
number of bullet holes found (nine).
He criticized the LAPD for its
refusal to release the 10 volumes of
information and analysis concerning

the investigation.
"We can not go on fantasizing that
these incidents are all loose nuts and
bolts," Lowenstein said. "We can't
assume that this is not a conspiratorial
attack on our democratic
system ... or we risk the repetition of
future tragedies that we might
otherwise be able to avert."
Joling agreed with Lowenstein,
stating that it is time that "hypotheses
and speculations should be counted as
such."
Joling, however, concentrated on
the 1963 assassination of
then-President John Kennedy.
Disputes Commission
Disputing the Warren Commission
report, Joling demonstrated with slides
of the Kennedy assassination the
improbability that the assassin's
bullets were fired from the sixth floor
of the Texas School Book Depository.
This was the alleged perch of Lee
Harvey Oswald.
Moreover, Joling maintained it
would have taken at least four bullets
to. have done the damage resulting
from the firings, not three as the
commission reported.
Joling disavowed the popular
assertion that one of the bullets that
hit Kennedy was fired from the front
and pushed the former President's
head back.
Kennedy's jerking movement,
graphically shown in the Zapruder film
of the assassination, was a
"neurological phenomenon" resulting
from the impact of the bullet fired
from behind, he said.

Nt'ther Lowenstein nor Joling
would speculate on the reasons for the
discrepancies found in the
investigations. "If you let your
imagination go wild," Joling said,
"you can fantasize all types of things."
By doing so, he emphasized, one
would risk the same faulty
assumptions that he and Lowenstein
criticized in the previous
investigations.
