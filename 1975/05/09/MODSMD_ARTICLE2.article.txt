# Lowenstein Asks For Aid In Reopening RFK Probe

### BETSY MORRIS 
Former Rep. Allard Lowenstein
(D-N.Y.) pleaded with an audience of
Stanford students and professors
yesterday for their aid in reopening
the investigation of the assassination
of Robert Kennedy
Lowenstein, a former Stanford
dean of men, told an overflowing
Meyer Library Forum Room crowd of

bullets found at the murder scene, one

lodged in the stomach of a bystander

assertion that it had been fired from
Sirhan's gun.
He further attacked this assertion
by citing a disparity between the
number of bullets that Sirhan's gun
could have shot (eight) and the
number of bullet holes found (nine).

refusal to release the 10 volumes of
information and analysis concerning

the investigation.

these incidents are all loose nuts and
bolts," Lowenstein said. "We can't
assume that this is not a conspiratorial
attack on our democratic
system ... or we risk the repetition of
future tragedies that we might
otherwise be able to avert."
Joling agreed with Lowenstein,
stating that it is time that "hypotheses
and speculations should be counted as
