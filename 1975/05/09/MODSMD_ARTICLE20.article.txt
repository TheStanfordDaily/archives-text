# Student-Teacher Probes Creativity
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
"Writing is like a living
thing," says Virginia de Araujo,
poet and translator, working on
her Ph D. in comparative
literature at the University. "If
its spontaneity is lost, the ability
to synthesize is destroyed or
goes dormant."
In the freshmen writing
courses she teaches, de Araujo,
49. is trying to get students to
"repossess a natural power."
"What you get first in the
class is 'barbaric yawp' in
chorus," she says, quoting Walt
Whitman. "The kids say, 'now
you've coaxed me out of my
shell and I write and you come
along and say it's terrible' —
which it is.
"You have to work with
them till they begin to recognize
that there is nothing
linguistically more difficult than
writing a short poem."
De Araujo attributes the
inability to be creative with
language to the thought
processes which students are
encouraged to use in order to
succeed at the University.
Big Con Artists
"These kids are big con
artists," she says. "To get in in

the first place, they had to get
good grades. To get good grades,
they had to be teacher-pleasers,
which is not the most sincere
manifestation of the self.
"It's a whole process of
psyche-out and snow and con"
which, she notes, diminishes the
creative use of language. "Our
overemphasis on this
manipulative use of language has
backfired .. . the students have
lost the sense of language as that
internal music which everyone
should possess."
De Araujo says she feels that
"minority kids fail because they
don't fit the pattern. The
University gets the first joy of
admitting them, and the second
joy of saying they can't make
it." Other students "spend four
years doing somebody else's
thing." She advises that
students take time out during
college to explore other
interests.
'Stopped Out'
She took her own advice for
over 20 years. After
studying writing and art at

Bennington and Radcliffe
Colleges, de Araujo 'stopped
out' to go to Brazil in 1951 and
marry poet and composer Jayme
de Rojas Ovalle. There she
published several books, learned
mural painting and translated
film scripts.
After the death of her
husband in 1955, de Araujo
continued writing in both

English and Portuguese and
exhibiting her own artwork.
She and her second husband
returned to the United States
"because of politics" in 1965.
She says she finds it ironic that
Portugal, formerly a Tightest
dictatorship, has gone so far to
the left, while Brazil, formerly
liberal, has become extremely
right-wing and repressive.

the first place, they had to get
good grades. To get good grades,
they had to be teacher-pleasers,
which is not the most sincere
manifestation of the self.
"It's a whole process of
psyche-out and snow and con"
which, she notes, diminishes the
creative use of language. "Our
overemphasis on this
manipulative use of language has
backfired .. . the students have
lost the sense of language as that
internal music which everyone
should possess."
De Araujo says she feels that
"minority kids fail because they
don't fit the pattern. The
University gets the first joy of
admitting them, and the second
joy of saying they can't make
it." Other students "spend four
years doing somebody else's
thing." She advises that
students take time out during
college to explore other
interests.
'Stopped Out'
She took her own advice for
over 20 years. After
studying writing and art at

Bennington and Radcliffe
Colleges, de Araujo 'stopped
out' to go to Brazil in 1951 and
marry poet and composer Jayme
de Rojas Ovalle. There she
published several books, learned
mural painting and translated
film scripts.
After the death of her
husband in 1955, de Araujo
continued writing in both

English and Portuguese and
exhibiting her own artwork.
She and her second husband
returned to the United States
"because of politics" in 1965.
She says she finds it ironic that
Portugal, formerly a Tightest
dictatorship, has gone so far to
the left, while Brazil, formerly
liberal, has become extremely
right-wing and repressive.

"Writing is like a living
thing," says Virginia de Araujo,
poet and translator, working on
her Ph D. in comparative
literature at the University. "If
its spontaneity is lost, the ability
to synthesize is destroyed or
goes dormant."
In the freshmen writing
courses she teaches, de Araujo,
49. is trying to get students to
"repossess a natural power."
"What you get first in the
class is 'barbaric yawp' in
chorus," she says, quoting Walt
Whitman. "The kids say, 'now
you've coaxed me out of my
shell and I write and you come
along and say it's terrible' —
which it is.
"You have to work with
them till they begin to recognize
that there is nothing
linguistically more difficult than
writing a short poem."
De Araujo attributes the
inability to be creative with
language to the thought
processes which students are
encouraged to use in order to
succeed at the University.
Big Con Artists
"These kids are big con
artists," she says. "To get in in

the first place, they had to get
good grades. To get good grades,
