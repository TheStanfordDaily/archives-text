## He Calls It 'Zycleco' Chenier's Accordian: Wild Blend 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO - When
Bay Area critics write about
Clifton Chenier they usually feel
obligated to "defend" the
instrument he plays, explaining,
"Yeah, he plays accordion, but
not like you're used to hearing it
played. Forget that Ted Mack
Amateur Hour, this guy really
swings. Honest!"
But, where Clifton comes
from, accordions are nearly as
commonplace to his music as
guitars are to rock bands. In
fact, what sets this Cajun's Red
Hot Louisiana Band apart from
other gooups of that region are
his R&B-flavored sax and 8.8.
King-style guitar. This blend of
modern and traditional —
encompassing 1950s R&B, blues,
rock, and Cajun waltzes and
two-steps — is what is known as
"Zydeco," and Clifton Chenier
is its crowned king.
Clifton is back in the Bay
Area, as he has been annually for
the past four years, playing his
zydeco for the Cajuns who've
migrated out of the delta
country, and introducing his
style to the as yet uninitiated.
Through Sunday the band will
be at the Boarding House, with
blues harmonica man J.C. Burris.
For the first four numbers of
his opening set Tuesday night,
Clifton laid out while the band
loosened the crowd up with a
few R&B tunes like "Hideaway"
and "Honky Tonk." The band's
line-up is the usual guitar (Paul
Senegal), tenor (John Hart), bass
(Joe Brouchet), and drums
(Robert Peter), with added
percussion provided by Clifton's
brother Cleveland on rubboard.
With a couple of beer bottle
openers in each hand, Cleveland
scrapes, scratches, and taps away
at a corregated metal vest he
hangs around his neck.
Clifton then took the stage
dressed in a pink and white plaid
suit, with white patent leather
shoes, and a silver-capped,
diamond-studded front tooth to

top things off. After strapping
on his 40-pound Organola
Deluxe, Chenier announced
"Where we come from even the
crawfish got soul," and
proceeded to demonstrate.
Opening with "Pinetop's
Boogie Woogie," Clifton proved
that his finger-work is every bit
as deft as the boogie pianists the
number is usually associated
with. Next was an uptempo
rendition of the blues "Black
Night," Clifton's first vocal of
the evening, with only a hint of
the Cajun accent that at times
baffles listeners.
The next two numbers, both
sung in French, were a two-step
entitled "Lucille," and a waltz,
"Jole Blon." Then it was back to
the blues with an accordion
interpretation of the Robert
Jo h n so n/Elmore James
masterpiece "Dust My Broom."
This is the usual pace of a
Chenier set; abrupt changes in
style, none of which sound
exactly like the particular idiom
due to the strange
instrumentation. The only thing
all the tunes had in common was
danceability — Clifton's music is
aimed at letting people have a
good time, with an irresistible
beat. In fact, the concert format
is fairly new to Clifton, who is
used to playing all-night dances
with no breaks, no intermissions,
and no warm-up acts (when he
came to In Your Ear three years
ago, he played nonstop from 9
p.m. to 2 a.m.).
Other numbers included in
the set were Lowell Fulson's
"Sinner's Prayer," "Jambalaya,"
and two numbers off Clifton's
latest Arhoolie LP, "Calinda"
and "I'm A Hog For You, Baby"
("and I'm gonna root around
your door"). That album, Out
West, features Elvin Bishop on
guitar, and is Clifton's sixth
recording for the label that is
largely responsible for his recent
West Coast tours.
At set's end — which came
only after the management

reminded Clifton that there was
a time limit and another show
yet to come — Clifton and
Cleveland signed autographs and
talked to their fans and Cajun
friends.
One newly-con verted fan
approached Cleveland saying,
"You guys really tore it up. I
love that Cajun stuff." Clifton's
brother smiled and replied,
"Yeah, me too."

Preceding the Red Hot
Louisiana Band was J.C. Burris,
in the wake of his recent success
at the Berkeley Blues Festival.
At 47, Burris is the nephew
of the man usually regarded as
unparalleled where blues
harmonica is concerned, Sonny
Terry. Burris began learning the
instrument from Terry at the age
of thirteen, and still shows much
of his teacher's influence. Two
Terry numbers were included in
Burris's opening set, "Stranger
Blues" and "Mean Woman
Blues."
"He told me I could never do

it," Burris told the audience. "I
said I thought I'd try." While
Terry seldom records or
performs without his partner of
35 years, guitarist Brownie
McGhee, Burris prefers to go it
alone, mainly because as he put
it,"It would take too long to
train a band that can pick up
with me like Lightnin' [Hopkins]
or Brownie [McGhee]."
The only accompaniment
Burris sometimes uses are his
"rhythm bones," two sticks of
ebony which he holds like chop
sticks in his right hand to set up
some fantastic polyrhythms
while blowing his eastern
seaboard brand of harmonica.
On his own "Highway Blues,"
Burris took a "bone solo" which
received the most applause of
the set. Burris describes his style
as a "blues rhythm with a Bo
Diddley beat," a variation on the
predominant shuffle.
Other Burris originals
included "You Got To Roam,"
"Evenin' Sun," The
gospel-tinged "There's a River

Somewhere," and "Leep On
Doggin' Me," which appears on
the Folkways LP On The Road,
with Terry and Brownie's
brother Sticks McGhee.
To close his set, Burris
abandoned all his instruments
except his own two hands for a
little "hand-give" and knee
slapping, which he called the
"Educated Hand:"
"They call me the hand-jive
man,
To do this jive you gotta educate
your hands."
This brought Burris two
well-deserved encores, closing
with "Wailin' and Sailin'."
With an Arhoolie recording
session scheduled for this
summer, J.C. Burris may be
getting the chance to play places
like the Boarding House more in
the future. In the meantime,
Burris can often be found
performing at the Coffee Gallery
on Grant Street. If you miss the
Boarding Houe line-up this
week, Clifton Chenier will be
back at Keystone Berkeley, May
29-30.

and "I'm A Hog For You, Baby"
("and I'm gonna root around
your door"). That album, Out
West, features Elvin Bishop on
guitar, and is Clifton's sixth
recording for the label that is
largely responsible for his recent
West Coast tours.
At set's end — which came
only after the management

reminded Clifton that there was
a time limit and another show
yet to come — Clifton and
Cleveland signed autographs and
talked to their fans and Cajun
friends.
One newly-con verted fan
approached Cleveland saying,
"You guys really tore it up. I
love that Cajun stuff." Clifton's
brother smiled and replied,
"Yeah, me too."

Preceding the Red Hot
Louisiana Band was J.C. Burris,
in the wake of his recent success
at the Berkeley Blues Festival.
At 47, Burris is the nephew
of the man usually regarded as
unparalleled where blues
harmonica is concerned, Sonny
Terry. Burris began learning the
instrument from Terry at the age
of thirteen, and still shows much
of his teacher's influence. Two
Terry numbers were included in
Burris's opening set, "Stranger
Blues" and "Mean Woman
Blues."
"He told me I could never do

it," Burris told the audience. "I
said I thought I'd try." While
Terry seldom records or
performs without his partner of
35 years, guitarist Brownie
McGhee, Burris prefers to go it
alone, mainly because as he put
it,"It would take too long to
train a band that can pick up
with me like Lightnin' [Hopkins]
or Brownie [McGhee]."
The only accompaniment
Burris sometimes uses are his
"rhythm bones," two sticks of
ebony which he holds like chop
sticks in his right hand to set up
some fantastic polyrhythms
while blowing his eastern
seaboard brand of harmonica.
On his own "Highway Blues,"
Burris took a "bone solo" which
received the most applause of
the set. Burris describes his style
as a "blues rhythm with a Bo
Diddley beat," a variation on the
predominant shuffle.
Other Burris originals
included "You Got To Roam,"
"Evenin' Sun," The
gospel-tinged "There's a River

Somewhere," and "Leep On
Doggin' Me," which appears on
the Folkways LP On The Road,
with Terry and Brownie's
brother Sticks McGhee.
To close his set, Burris
abandoned all his instruments
except his own two hands for a
little "hand-give" and knee
slapping, which he called the
"Educated Hand:"
"They call me the hand-jive
man,
To do this jive you gotta educate
your hands."
This brought Burris two
well-deserved encores, closing
with "Wailin' and Sailin'."
With an Arhoolie recording
session scheduled for this
summer, J.C. Burris may be
getting the chance to play places
like the Boarding House more in
the future. In the meantime,
Burris can often be found
performing at the Coffee Gallery
on Grant Street. If you miss the
Boarding Houe line-up this
week, Clifton Chenier will be
back at Keystone Berkeley, May
29-30.
SAN FRANCISCO - When
Bay Area critics write about
Clifton Chenier they usually feel
obligated to "defend" the
instrument he plays, explaining,
"Yeah, he plays accordion, but
not like you're used to hearing it
played. Forget that Ted Mack
Amateur Hour, this guy really
swings. Honest!"
But, where Clifton comes
from, accordions are nearly as
commonplace to his music as
guitars are to rock bands. In
fact, what sets this Cajun's Red
Hot Louisiana Band apart from
other gooups of that region are
his R&B-flavored sax and 8.8.
King-style guitar. This blend of
modern and traditional —
encompassing 1950s R&B, blues,
rock, and Cajun waltzes and
two-steps — is what is known as
"Zydeco," and Clifton Chenier
is its crowned king.
Clifton is back in the Bay
Area, as he has been annually for
the past four years, playing his
zydeco for the Cajuns who've
migrated out of the delta
country, and introducing his
style to the as yet uninitiated.
Through Sunday the band will
be at the Boarding House, with
blues harmonica man J.C. Burris.
For the first four numbers of
his opening set Tuesday night,
Clifton laid out while the band
loosened the crowd up with a
few R&B tunes like "Hideaway"
and "Honky Tonk." The band's
line-up is the usual guitar (Paul
Senegal), tenor (John Hart), bass
(Joe Brouchet), and drums
(Robert Peter), with added
percussion provided by Clifton's
brother Cleveland on rubboard.
With a couple of beer bottle
openers in each hand, Cleveland
scrapes, scratches, and taps away
at a corregated metal vest he
hangs around his neck.
Clifton then took the stage
dressed in a pink and white plaid
suit, with white patent leather
shoes, and a silver-capped,
diamond-studded front tooth to

top things off. After strapping
on his 40-pound Organola
Deluxe, Chenier announced
"Where we come from even the
crawfish got soul," and
proceeded to demonstrate.
Opening with "Pinetop's
Boogie Woogie," Clifton proved
that his finger-work is every bit
as deft as the boogie pianists the
number is usually associated
with. Next was an uptempo
rendition of the blues "Black
Night," Clifton's first vocal of
the evening, with only a hint of
the Cajun accent that at times
baffles listeners.
The next two numbers, both
sung in French, were a two-step
entitled "Lucille," and a waltz,
"Jole Blon." Then it was back to
the blues with an accordion
interpretation of the Robert
Jo h n so n/Elmore James
masterpiece "Dust My Broom."
This is the usual pace of a
Chenier set; abrupt changes in
style, none of which sound
exactly like the particular idiom
due to the strange
instrumentation. The only thing
all the tunes had in common was
danceability — Clifton's music is
aimed at letting people have a
good time, with an irresistible
beat. In fact, the concert format
is fairly new to Clifton, who is
used to playing all-night dances
with no breaks, no intermissions,
and no warm-up acts (when he
came to In Your Ear three years
ago, he played nonstop from 9
p.m. to 2 a.m.).
Other numbers included in
the set were Lowell Fulson's
"Sinner's Prayer," "Jambalaya,"
and two numbers off Clifton's
latest Arhoolie LP, "Calinda"
and "I'm A Hog For You, Baby"
("and I'm gonna root around
your door"). That album, Out

commonplace to his music as
guitars are to rock bands. In
fact, what sets this Cajun's Red
Hot Louisiana Band apart from
other gooups of that region are
his R&B-flavored sax and 8.8.
King-style guitar. This blend of
modern and traditional —
encompassing 1950s R&B, blues,
rock, and Cajun waltzes and
two-steps — is what is known as
"Zydeco," and Clifton Chenier
is its crowned king.
Clifton is back in the Bay
Area, as he has been annually for
the past four years, playing his
zydeco for the Cajuns who've
migrated out of the delta
country, and introducing his
style to the as yet uninitiated.
Through Sunday the band will
be at the Boarding House, with
blues harmonica man J.C. Burris.
For the first four numbers of
his opening set Tuesday night,
Clifton laid out while the band
loosened the crowd up with a
few R&B tunes like "Hideaway"
and "Honky Tonk." The band's
line-up is the usual guitar (Paul
Senegal), tenor (John Hart), bass
(Joe Brouchet), and drums
(Robert Peter), with added
percussion provided by Clifton's
brother Cleveland on rubboard.
With a couple of beer bottle
openers in each hand, Cleveland
scrapes, scratches, and taps away
at a corregated metal vest he
hangs around his neck.
Clifton then took the stage
dressed in a pink and white plaid
suit, with white patent leather
shoes, and a silver-capped,
diamond-studded front tooth to

top things off. After strapping
on his 40-pound Organola
Deluxe, Chenier announced
"Where we come from even the
crawfish got soul," and
proceeded to demonstrate.
Opening with "Pinetop's
Boogie Woogie," Clifton proved
that his finger-work is every bit
as deft as the boogie pianists the
number is usually associated
with. Next was an uptempo
rendition of the blues "Black
Night," Clifton's first vocal of
the evening, with only a hint of
the Cajun accent that at times
baffles listeners.
The next two numbers, both
sung in French, were a two-step
entitled "Lucille," and a waltz,
"Jole Blon." Then it was back to
the blues with an accordion
interpretation of the Robert
Jo h n so n/Elmore James
masterpiece "Dust My Broom."
This is the usual pace of a
Chenier set; abrupt changes in
style, none of which sound
exactly like the particular idiom
due to the strange
instrumentation. The only thing
all the tunes had in common was
danceability — Clifton's music is
aimed at letting people have a
good time, with an irresistible
beat. In fact, the concert format
is fairly new to Clifton, who is
used to playing all-night dances
with no breaks, no intermissions,
and no warm-up acts (when he
came to In Your Ear three years
ago, he played nonstop from 9
p.m. to 2 a.m.).
Other numbers included in
the set were Lowell Fulson's
"Sinner's Prayer," "Jambalaya,"
and two numbers off Clifton's
latest Arhoolie LP, "Calinda"
and "I'm A Hog For You, Baby"
("and I'm gonna root around
your door"). That album, Out
West, features Elvin Bishop on
guitar, and is Clifton's sixth
recording for the label that is
largely responsible for his recent
West Coast tours.
At set's end — which came
only after the management

reminded Clifton that there was
a time limit and another show
yet to come — Clifton and
Cleveland signed autographs and
talked to their fans and Cajun
friends.
One newly-con verted fan
approached Cleveland saying,
"You guys really tore it up. I
love that Cajun stuff." Clifton's
brother smiled and replied,
"Yeah, me too."

Preceding the Red Hot
Louisiana Band was J.C. Burris,
in the wake of his recent success
at the Berkeley Blues Festival.
At 47, Burris is the nephew
of the man usually regarded as
unparalleled where blues
harmonica is concerned, Sonny
Terry. Burris began learning the
instrument from Terry at the age
of thirteen, and still shows much
of his teacher's influence. Two
Terry numbers were included in
Burris's opening set, "Stranger
Blues" and "Mean Woman
Blues."
"He told me I could never do

it," Burris told the audience. "I
said I thought I'd try." While
Terry seldom records or
performs without his partner of
35 years, guitarist Brownie
McGhee, Burris prefers to go it
alone, mainly because as he put
it,"It would take too long to
train a band that can pick up
with me like Lightnin' [Hopkins]
or Brownie [McGhee]."
The only accompaniment
Burris sometimes uses are his
"rhythm bones," two sticks of
ebony which he holds like chop
sticks in his right hand to set up
some fantastic polyrhythms
while blowing his eastern
seaboard brand of harmonica.
On his own "Highway Blues,"
Burris took a "bone solo" which
received the most applause of
the set. Burris describes his style
as a "blues rhythm with a Bo
Diddley beat," a variation on the
predominant shuffle.
Other Burris originals
included "You Got To Roam,"
"Evenin' Sun," The
gospel-tinged "There's a River

Somewhere," and "Leep On
Doggin' Me," which appears on
the Folkways LP On The Road,
with Terry and Brownie's
brother Sticks McGhee.
To close his set, Burris
abandoned all his instruments
except his own two hands for a
little "hand-give" and knee
slapping, which he called the
"Educated Hand:"
"They call me the hand-jive
man,
To do this jive you gotta educate
your hands."
This brought Burris two
well-deserved encores, closing
with "Wailin' and Sailin'."
With an Arhoolie recording
session scheduled for this
summer, J.C. Burris may be
getting the chance to play places
like the Boarding House more in
the future. In the meantime,
Burris can often be found
performing at the Coffee Gallery
on Grant Street. If you miss the
Boarding Houe line-up this
week, Clifton Chenier will be
back at Keystone Berkeley, May
29-30.
SAN FRANCISCO - When
Bay Area critics write about
Clifton Chenier they usually feel
obligated to "defend" the
instrument he plays, explaining,
"Yeah, he plays accordion, but
not like you're used to hearing it
played. Forget that Ted Mack
Amateur Hour, this guy really
swings. Honest!"

talked to their fans and Cajun
friends.
One newly-con verted fan
approached Cleveland saying,
"You guys really tore it up. I
love that Cajun stuff." Clifton's
brother smiled and replied,
"Yeah, me too."

Preceding the Red Hot
Louisiana Band was J.C. Burris,
in the wake of his recent success
at the Berkeley Blues Festival.
At 47, Burris is the nephew
of the man usually regarded as
unparalleled where blues
harmonica is concerned, Sonny
Terry. Burris began learning the
instrument from Terry at the age
of thirteen, and still shows much
of his teacher's influence. Two
Terry numbers were included in
Burris's opening set, "Stranger
Blues" and "Mean Woman
Blues."
"He told me I could never do

it," Burris told the audience. "I
said I thought I'd try." While
Terry seldom records or
performs without his partner of
35 years, guitarist Brownie
McGhee, Burris prefers to go it
alone, mainly because as he put
it,"It would take too long to
train a band that can pick up
with me like Lightnin' [Hopkins]
or Brownie [McGhee]."
The only accompaniment
Burris sometimes uses are his
"rhythm bones," two sticks of
ebony which he holds like chop
sticks in his right hand to set up
some fantastic polyrhythms
while blowing his eastern
seaboard brand of harmonica.
On his own "Highway Blues,"
Burris took a "bone solo" which
received the most applause of
the set. Burris describes his style
as a "blues rhythm with a Bo
Diddley beat," a variation on the
predominant shuffle.
Other Burris originals
included "You Got To Roam,"
"Evenin' Sun," The
gospel-tinged "There's a River

Somewhere," and "Leep On
Doggin' Me," which appears on
the Folkways LP On The Road,
with Terry and Brownie's
brother Sticks McGhee.
To close his set, Burris
abandoned all his instruments
except his own two hands for a
little "hand-give" and knee
slapping, which he called the
"Educated Hand:"
"They call me the hand-jive
man,
To do this jive you gotta educate
your hands."
This brought Burris two
well-deserved encores, closing
with "Wailin' and Sailin'."
With an Arhoolie recording
session scheduled for this
summer, J.C. Burris may be
getting the chance to play places
like the Boarding House more in
the future. In the meantime,
Burris can often be found
performing at the Coffee Gallery
on Grant Street. If you miss the
Boarding Houe line-up this
week, Clifton Chenier will be
back at Keystone Berkeley, May
29-30.
