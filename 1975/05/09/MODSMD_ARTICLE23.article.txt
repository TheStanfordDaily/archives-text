# Once Around The Turntable
## De Johnette Stirs Imagination; Carly Is Sincere 
### 
Jack DeJohnette
Sorcery
Prestige P-10081
A few months ago Jack
DeJohnette's new quartet
treated audiences at San
Francisco's Keystone Korner to
an astonishing set of music.
What made that performance so
effective was DeJohnette's
ability to bring many seemingly
incompatible (and often bizarre)
musical forms together into a
highly personal music.
DeJohnette's recent album,
Sorcery, reflects the same
concern with exploration and
experimentation. DeJohnette,
on drums, saxophone and
electric keyboards, and his
collaborators on Sorcery are at
the forefront of one of the most
promising musical trends of the
'70s, a trend that reaffirms the
importance of finding new
approaches to match new
instruments and techniques.

The first side of Soicery
shows how well an unusual
combination of instruments can
work. Besides DeJohnette on
drums and superb bassist Dave
Holland, this side features
Bennie Maupin on bass clarinet,
John Abercrombie and Mick
Goodrick on electric guitars, and
Michael Fellerman on
metaphone 1, a brass
instrument.
Especially interesting is the
contrast in styles of the two
guitarists. On "Sorcery No. 1"
Abercrombie (now the regular
guitarist in DeJohnette's
quartet) sketches his solo in soft,
broken note patterns. His work
is totally unornamented, free of
distortion.
Goodrick's solo on the
exuberant "Rock Thing" begins
fast and loud and ends in a wild
cascade of notes — a style as
unfettered as Abercrombie's is
controlled.

And between these two
pieces is "The Right Time," a
two-minute selection for spoken
voices. This bit is not only a lot
of fun to listen to (it must have
been even more fun to perform),
but an indication of another
resource that other jazz
musicians might consider using.
Side two holds the record's
most ambitious piece, the
14-minute "Reverend King
Suite." Beginning with a short
section for percussion and
changed voice (written by John
Coltrane), the piece moves to a
loud, violent section called "The
Fatal Shot," and then resolves to
a more placid and controlled
final portion, "New Spirits on
the Horizon."
In the end, a jazz musician is
really only as effective as his
imagination. DeJohnette and his
fellow musicians on Sorcery
prove how far a good
imagination can propel a good

musician.

Carly Simon
Playing Possum
Elektra 7E-1033
I think a lot of people have
know for quite a while that the
wrong female singers have been
getting the publicity. At least,
every time 1 hear the highly
vaunted Joni Mitchell, Carole
King or Phoebe Snow, I
appreciate Carly Simon a little
more.
It's not just that Carly sings
better than the others (she
does), but that her songs reflect
a kind of sincerity and maturity
that the others have never
reached.
Although Playing Possum, her
fifth album, is not as consistent
as her earlier No Secrets or
Anticipation, Possum,
alternately witty and wistful,
reveals much of Carly's
inimitable style.

Carly's cover photos aren't
the only thing that shows her
desire to make this a "body
album": her songs contain more
wry sexuality than ever before.
Her three love songs that
open the album — "Love Out in
the Street" is the finest of these
— are her most explicitly
sensual. "Look Me in the Eyes,"
for instance, has her singing:
"//'s your heat that makes me
warm
Makes me climb on you like a
tree
And I don't need no fancy
dancing
When you bend over me "
Like all Richard Perry
productions, this album features
a huge supporting cast, different
on almost every song, and plenty
of overdubbing and other
production techniques.
While Perry's policy of hiring
so many backup musicians did
help provide some interesting
combinations, especially of
Carly's voice with those of Rita
Coolidge ("Love Out in the
Street") and Carly's husband
James Taylor ("Waterfall"),
most of the musicians here seem
unnecessary.
But this overproduction can't
keep Carly down. Her songs are
consistently fresh, a kind of
urban folk music that avoids
both self-indulgence and
shallowness in a way that few
other singers can.

Jack DeJohnette
Sorcery
Prestige P-10081
A few months ago Jack
DeJohnette's new quartet
treated audiences at San
Francisco's Keystone Korner to
an astonishing set of music.
What made that performance so
effective was DeJohnette's
ability to bring many seemingly
incompatible (and often bizarre)
musical forms together into a
highly personal music.
DeJohnette's recent album,
Sorcery, reflects the same
concern with exploration and
experimentation. DeJohnette,
on drums, saxophone and
electric keyboards, and his
collaborators on Sorcery are at
the forefront of one of the most
promising musical trends of the
'70s, a trend that reaffirms the
importance of finding new
approaches to match new
instruments and techniques.

The first side of Soicery
shows how well an unusual
combination of instruments can
work. Besides DeJohnette on
drums and superb bassist Dave
Holland, this side features
Bennie Maupin on bass clarinet,
John Abercrombie and Mick
Goodrick on electric guitars, and
Michael Fellerman on
metaphone 1, a brass
instrument.
Especially interesting is the
contrast in styles of the two
guitarists. On "Sorcery No. 1"
Abercrombie (now the regular
guitarist in DeJohnette's
quartet) sketches his solo in soft,
broken note patterns. His work
is totally unornamented, free of
distortion.
Goodrick's solo on the
exuberant "Rock Thing" begins
fast and loud and ends in a wild
cascade of notes — a style as
unfettered as Abercrombie's is
controlled.

And between these two
pieces is "The Right Time," a
two-minute selection for spoken
voices. This bit is not only a lot
of fun to listen to (it must have
been even more fun to perform),
but an indication of another
resource that other jazz
musicians might consider using.
Side two holds the record's
most ambitious piece, the
14-minute "Reverend King
Suite." Beginning with a short
section for percussion and
changed voice (written by John
Coltrane), the piece moves to a
loud, violent section called "The
Fatal Shot," and then resolves to
a more placid and controlled
final portion, "New Spirits on
the Horizon."
In the end, a jazz musician is
really only as effective as his
imagination. DeJohnette and his
fellow musicians on Sorcery
prove how far a good
imagination can propel a good

musician.

Carly Simon
Playing Possum
Elektra 7E-1033
I think a lot of people have
know for quite a while that the
wrong female singers have been
getting the publicity. At least,
every time 1 hear the highly
vaunted Joni Mitchell, Carole
King or Phoebe Snow, I
appreciate Carly Simon a little
more.
It's not just that Carly sings
better than the others (she
does), but that her songs reflect
a kind of sincerity and maturity
that the others have never
reached.
Although Playing Possum, her
fifth album, is not as consistent
as her earlier No Secrets or
Anticipation, Possum,
alternately witty and wistful,
reveals much of Carly's
inimitable style.

Carly's cover photos aren't
the only thing that shows her
desire to make this a "body
album": her songs contain more
wry sexuality than ever before.
Her three love songs that
open the album — "Love Out in
the Street" is the finest of these
— are her most explicitly
sensual. "Look Me in the Eyes,"
for instance, has her singing:
"//'s your heat that makes me
warm
Makes me climb on you like a
tree
And I don't need no fancy
dancing
When you bend over me "
Like all Richard Perry
productions, this album features
a huge supporting cast, different
on almost every song, and plenty
of overdubbing and other
production techniques.
While Perry's policy of hiring
so many backup musicians did
help provide some interesting
combinations, especially of
Carly's voice with those of Rita
Coolidge ("Love Out in the
Street") and Carly's husband
James Taylor ("Waterfall"),
most of the musicians here seem
unnecessary.
But this overproduction can't
keep Carly down. Her songs are
consistently fresh, a kind of
urban folk music that avoids
both self-indulgence and
shallowness in a way that few
other singers can.
