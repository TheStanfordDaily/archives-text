# Jean Jennings: Young And Coming Porno Star
## 
### 
Now that porn movies have become a staple of
the film industry, porno producers and talent
scouts are always on the lookout for some hot
new talent or something sexually bizarre that has
never before been seen on screen.
So we come to Jean Jennings, the latest starlet
to try and crack the porn big three of Lovelace,
Chambers and Spelvin. She may be able to do it,
because she's got a long career ahead of her. She
as only 17 when she made her first hard-core
feature Defiance!, and she looks every year of it,
a lecher's wet-dream fantasy come to life.
Defiance! was made in 1974, and, now that
Jennings has turned 18, the story of her age has
been told in the New York press. Briefly, she's
just an ordinary good-looking American girl, who
wants to break into movies, so on the release she
signed before making Defiance!s she put her age
is 23. What's six years among friends, anyway?
She quickly became more than friends with
the movie's producer, Jason Russell, the husband
of Tina Russell, a porn starlet herself. Jason and
Tina formed the first husband-wife porn team,
but when Jason saw Jean Jennings, that team
dissolved faster than Burton and Taylor did.
Does this behind-the-screen knowledge make
Defiance! any more enjoyable or understandable?
>Jot really, because the movie is pretty
run-of-the-mill.
Dear blonde Jean, who still has a touch of
baby fat in her cover girl features, is caught in her
bedroom by her parents as she tries cocaine for
the first time. The parents have only one
dimension, stupid insensitivity, so they have her
committed to a mental hospital for "observation"
of her drug "addiction."
Thrust into this strange environment, poor
Jean looks lost, confused, helpless and vulnerable.
The attendants and the patients alike pass the
time of day masturbating themselves and acting
like burned-out casualties of the sexual
revolution. First Jean is forced to strip, and then
roughly examined all over by a jive-talking
attendant.
Then that night, she is set upon and raped by
three inmates, in a graphically presented gang
bang. The next morning she acts hurt, confused
and very upset, so the head doctor doses her with

thorazine, to "calm" her. Then the jiving
attendant screws her while she's too drugged to
care.
To this point, the film has been a rather crude
and lewd fantasy, but saved by Jennings's acting
(maybe she really was confused, hurt and
vulnerable) and the bizarre, surreal atmosphere of
the mental hospital.
But then the film takes a turn toward less plot
and more hard core action. Enter a
devilish-looking younger doctor, who offers to get
her out of the hospital to his private facility. Jean
accepts, and the rest of the movie's action takes
place in the doctor's home, which happens to be
filled with just enough patients to have several
good orgies.
The good young doctor, it seems, is a voyeur of
the highest order, who can only "get off' in his
mind while watching some mild sado-masochistic
action, or an orgy of from seven to 10 people.
The doctor forces poor innocent Jean to do
everything he says. At first she has to be coerced
(bondage and discipline) but very soon she
becomes a right willing little cocksucker, wearing
strange leather harness outfits and engaging in
lesbian relations with other women on the
premises.
The austere-looking young doctor presides
over all the goings-on with a regal, disdainful air,
and really, how many orgies can you watch
without becoming just a bit jaded?
As is the usual case in hard core porn, lovely
Jennings becomes liberated (sexually) and
learns to really enjoy fellatio and cunnilingus, but
still has to pass the ultimate test — should 1 help
my best girlfriend escape from this place after we
have just had a great sexual encounter?
Whatever she does, the film's got to end
anyway, now that all the standard hard-core
action has been completed. What makes this film
different is the age and obvious talent of Jean
Jennings. Is it acting, or just reacting? The Beatles
had the answer to that when they sang those
immortal words "Oh, she was just 17; you know
what 1 mean."
Defiance! is currently playing at the Paris
Theater in Palo Alto.

is 23. What's six years among friends, anyway?
She quickly became more than friends with
the movie's producer, Jason Russell, the husband
of Tina Russell, a porn starlet herself. Jason and
Tina formed the first husband-wife porn team,
but when Jason saw Jean Jennings, that team
dissolved faster than Burton and Taylor did.
Does this behind-the-screen knowledge make
Defiance! any more enjoyable or understandable?
>Jot really, because the movie is pretty
run-of-the-mill.
Dear blonde Jean, who still has a touch of
baby fat in her cover girl features, is caught in her
bedroom by her parents as she tries cocaine for
the first time. The parents have only one
dimension, stupid insensitivity, so they have her
committed to a mental hospital for "observation"
of her drug "addiction."
Thrust into this strange environment, poor
Jean looks lost, confused, helpless and vulnerable.
The attendants and the patients alike pass the
time of day masturbating themselves and acting
like burned-out casualties of the sexual
revolution. First Jean is forced to strip, and then
roughly examined all over by a jive-talking
attendant.
Then that night, she is set upon and raped by
three inmates, in a graphically presented gang
bang. The next morning she acts hurt, confused
and very upset, so the head doctor doses her with

thorazine, to "calm" her. Then the jiving
attendant screws her while she's too drugged to
care.
To this point, the film has been a rather crude
and lewd fantasy, but saved by Jennings's acting
(maybe she really was confused, hurt and
vulnerable) and the bizarre, surreal atmosphere of
the mental hospital.
But then the film takes a turn toward less plot
and more hard core action. Enter a
devilish-looking younger doctor, who offers to get
her out of the hospital to his private facility. Jean
accepts, and the rest of the movie's action takes
place in the doctor's home, which happens to be
filled with just enough patients to have several
good orgies.
The good young doctor, it seems, is a voyeur of
the highest order, who can only "get off' in his
mind while watching some mild sado-masochistic
action, or an orgy of from seven to 10 people.
The doctor forces poor innocent Jean to do
everything he says. At first she has to be coerced
(bondage and discipline) but very soon she
becomes a right willing little cocksucker, wearing
strange leather harness outfits and engaging in
lesbian relations with other women on the
premises.
The austere-looking young doctor presides
over all the goings-on with a regal, disdainful air,
and really, how many orgies can you watch
without becoming just a bit jaded?
As is the usual case in hard core porn, lovely
Jennings becomes liberated (sexually) and
learns to really enjoy fellatio and cunnilingus, but
still has to pass the ultimate test — should 1 help
my best girlfriend escape from this place after we
have just had a great sexual encounter?
Whatever she does, the film's got to end
anyway, now that all the standard hard-core
action has been completed. What makes this film
different is the age and obvious talent of Jean
Jennings. Is it acting, or just reacting? The Beatles
had the answer to that when they sang those
immortal words "Oh, she was just 17; you know
what 1 mean."

Now that porn movies have become a staple of
the film industry, porno producers and talent
scouts are always on the lookout for some hot
new talent or something sexually bizarre that has
never before been seen on screen.
So we come to Jean Jennings, the latest starlet
to try and crack the porn big three of Lovelace,
Chambers and Spelvin. She may be able to do it,
because she's got a long career ahead of her. She
as only 17 when she made her first hard-core
feature Defiance!, and she looks every year of it,
a lecher's wet-dream fantasy come to life.
Defiance! was made in 1974, and, now that
Jennings has turned 18, the story of her age has
been told in the New York press. Briefly, she's
just an ordinary good-looking American girl, who
wants to break into movies, so on the release she
signed before making Defiance!s she put her age
is 23. What's six years among friends, anyway?
She quickly became more than friends with
