# Fans Think So
## Jackson Browne Is God 
### 
"You're God, Jackson!"
yelled a fan from the
balcony. Jackson Browne,
calmly drinking wine while
stated at the piano, burst into
laughter and choked out an
incredulous "What?\"
It seemed that Browne
wasn't expecting the
enthusiastic reception he
received Sunday night at the
San Jose Center for the
Performing Arts.
Yet Browne is no
lightweight in the music
business. Since 1968, he's
been composing songs for
other artists, such as Tom
Rush, Nico, and Clarence
White. Four years later, the
California-based singer
( released a long-awaited first
album, Jackson Browne, a
grand success. His next two
releases followed suit.
Browne alternately
accompanied his earnest,
nasal voice on acoustic guitar,
piano, and electric guitar,
while a seven-member band
filled in the rest. David
Lindley provided most of the
lead work for Browne's
country-rock compositions
011 electric violin and guitar.
For "Doctor My Eyes,"
Lindley placed his guitar on
his lap and proceeded to pick
out a beautifully aching slide
solo. His violin never
screeches, but drifts
' pleasantly in the background.

Browne, usually cool
towards an audience,
maintained an easy rapport
with the crowd Sunday night.
But when performing, he
becomes totally engrossed in
the romanticism of his lyrics,
barely aware of anyone's
presence.
Browne's set included
"These Days," "Take It
Easy," "For Everyman," and
"Ready or Not."
Vocalist Phoebe Snow,
whose fame spread quickly
after her single "Poetry Man"
became a hit, gave her first
live performances in the Bay
Area this weekend.
The cheerful, slightly
plump Snow looks more like
a hip matron than the
successful blues singer that
she is. After wooing the
audience with an anecdote
and a few funny quips, Snow
launched into "Either or

Both "and displayed the quiet
smoothness of her voice.
During "Harpo's Blues,"
Snow demonstrated her
ability to sustain a note with
force and clarity, rolling the
end of each line around and
having as good a time playing
with her voice as the audience
had listening to her.
However, her arrangement |
of Neil Young's "Don't Let It
Bring You Down" was too
jazzy, and although her vocal
power is immense, her
continued emphasis on the
loud and the high became
monotonous.
j#
Snow sang a moving
version of Billie Holiday's
"No Regrets," and finished
up with another cut from her
recently released album, "No
Show Tonight," for which
she received a standing
ovation.

presence.
Browne's set included
"These Days," "Take It
Easy," "For Everyman," and
"Ready or Not."
Vocalist Phoebe Snow,
whose fame spread quickly
after her single "Poetry Man"
became a hit, gave her first
live performances in the Bay
Area this weekend.
The cheerful, slightly
plump Snow looks more like
a hip matron than the
successful blues singer that
she is. After wooing the
audience with an anecdote
and a few funny quips, Snow
launched into "Either or

Both "and displayed the quiet
smoothness of her voice.
During "Harpo's Blues,"
Snow demonstrated her
ability to sustain a note with
force and clarity, rolling the
end of each line around and
having as good a time playing
with her voice as the audience
had listening to her.
However, her arrangement |
of Neil Young's "Don't Let It
Bring You Down" was too
jazzy, and although her vocal
power is immense, her
continued emphasis on the
loud and the high became
monotonous.

Snow sang a moving
version of Billie Holiday's
"No Regrets," and finished
up with another cut from her
recently released album, "No
Show Tonight," for which
she received a standing
ovation.

"You're God, Jackson!"
yelled a fan from the
balcony. Jackson Browne,
calmly drinking wine while
stated at the piano, burst into
laughter and choked out an
incredulous "What?\"
It seemed that Browne
wasn't expecting the
enthusiastic reception he
received Sunday night at the
San Jose Center for the
Performing Arts.
Yet Browne is no
lightweight in the music
business. Since 1968, he's
been composing songs for
other artists, such as Tom
Rush, Nico, and Clarence
White. Four years later, the
California-based singer
( released a long-awaited first
album, Jackson Browne, a
grand success. His next two
releases followed suit.
Browne alternately
accompanied his earnest,
nasal voice on acoustic guitar,
piano, and electric guitar,
while a seven-member band
filled in the rest. David
Lindley provided most of the
lead work for Browne's
country-rock compositions
011 electric violin and guitar.
For "Doctor My Eyes,"
Lindley placed his guitar on
his lap and proceeded to pick
out a beautifully aching slide
solo. His violin never
screeches, but drifts
' pleasantly in the background.

Browne, usually cool
towards an audience,
maintained an easy rapport
with the crowd Sunday night.
But when performing, he
becomes totally engrossed in
the romanticism of his lyrics,
barely aware of anyone's
presence.
