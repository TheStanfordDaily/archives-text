# Stern's Violin Work Highlights Symphony
## 
### 
Symphony-goers delighted in an excellent new piece Wednesday
night as performed by the San Francisco Symphony and the great
violinist Isaac Stern.
Stern soloed in a piece he world-premiered in Pittsburgh last
month — George Rochberg's Concerto for Violin and Orchestra.
As a contemporary piece, the Concerto is very conservative.
Most of its thematic material sounds like a pretty and romantic
1940s Hollywood movie theme song, with other passages
resembling the spacy and celestial music of today. It lacks the
harsh atonalities that characterize much of today's music, and thus
is a thoroughly sensual, romantic, and personable piece.
Stern played it beautifully. He heightened the vivid dynamic
contrasts so that one could easily follow the unfamiliar melodies.
He played alternately sweetly or caustically, as the piece dictates,
with delicate off-the-fingerboard harmonies or sharp, bowcrashing
chords.
The orchestra was no less perfect. It gauged the difficult
entrances and accompanying passages with precision, and was
ready to take over when its turn came with the themes. Stern
and the orchestra had not had much rehearsal together, and the
piece is new to all, but the piece was a great success in spite of its
novelty and difficulty.
The success of the performance was as much Rochbel-g's as it
was the orchestra's and Stern's. Stern beckoned the composer
from the wings on stage, where he shared in the appluase and
standing ovation.
The orchestra performed a relatively unknown but delightful
piece, Edward Elgar's Variations on an Original Theme (Enigma
Variations). The work consists of 14 short "songs" describing
Elgar's friends, wife, and even the family bulldog. The romantic
songs range from the light and delicate to the lush and schmaltzy.
The musicians had fun with this piece — souping up the solos,
accentuating dynamics, or simply playing it straight. Principal
violist Rolf Persinger and principal cellist Robert Sayre deserve
special recognition for their small but musical solos.
Also performed was Mozart's Symphony No. 41 in C Major,
K. 551, his most famous symphony. Conductor Seiji Ozawa addpd
nothing new to the standard interpretation, but the orchestra
played it clearly and straightforwardly.
