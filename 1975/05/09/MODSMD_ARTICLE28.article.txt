# 'The Passenger': Complete Boredom
## 
### 
Every man, if only for a
moment, yearns to live another
man's life. Therein lies the
premise for Michelangelo
Antonioni's ( Blow-Up, Zabriskie
Point) new movie, The
Passenger, starring Jack
Nicholson (Chinatown) and
Maria Schneider (Last Tango In
Paris).
The Passenger is a story of a
man so bored with his own life
that he exchanges it for that of a
heart attack victim in his hotel,
keeping the dead man's
appointments and taking on his
affairs. Much could be done with
a stimulating premise like this,
but Antonioni seems to go out
of his way to avoid anything
interesting, and instead delivers a
movie as riveting as an I Love
Lucy rerun.
The Passenger is undeniably
one of the most boring movies I
have ever been subjected to.
Although it's only two hours, it
seems like a double feature of
Lawrence of Arabia and Dr.
Zhivago.
Antonioni seems obsessed in
the beginning with long pans of
the African desert where
journalist David Locke
(Nicholson) is searching for a
band of revolutionaries. On&
expects to see something that
should be noticed, that will help
to understand the movie, but
there's nothing.
This is to emphasize Locke's
isolation from the world. It also
helps to isolate the viewer from
any interest for the movie. The
Passenger is rife with symbolism,
but unfortunately, only
Antonioni knows about it.
It's one of those movies
where everything has a special
significance, but darned if any of
it can be understood.
Much is made of Locke's
isolation. As a journalist, always
observing, he feels alienated and
eventually tires of this existence,
even though he is successful at
it, and wants to experience
rather than watch. Perhaps all of
us at one time or another wish
to pack up and move on,
forsaking our old lives and
starting all over again.
"Can't we throw it all away
day by day?" asks Locke. When
a stranger named Robertson in
the room next to his at their
African hotel dies, Locke
exchanges pictures of their
passports and lets it be known
that it is Locke who has had a
heart attack.
His wife and employer then
try to track down Robertson,
whom they assume was the last
one to see Locke alive. If this
confuses you, you have a good
idea of what the movie is like.

It begins to bounce back and
forth between being a chase
movie complete with wild
driving and an exercise in
undecipherable symbolism.
Although Locke has taken
Robertson's life, it is as though
it's forgotten. There is an
occasional scene with sparse
humor achieved as Locke meets
with Robertson's associates, who
turn out to be buying guns for
the African revolutionaries.
This association fades into
the distance, and as he turns up
in the cities written in
Robertson's appointment book,
nothing connected with the dead
man ever seems to happen as
Locke never attempts to do
anything about fulfilling
Robertson's contracts.
Locke seems obsessed with
moving ahead, but he never
seems to fully take over
Robertson's life. Fortunately,
Jack Nicholson is very
charismatic — he has an
undeniable screen presence.
Maria Schneider's beauty and
delicate voice are equally
appealing, but they cannot keep
the movie from being not only a
waste of time but also quickly
forgettable.
The question of the identity
of the passenger is never
answered — is it Locke riding on
Robertson's life, or the girl
riding with Locke? Is this
supposed to mean we are all
riding along complacently in our
lives, and are not really living
them? Does it mean we are all
passengers, or something deep
like that? Not that I care, of
course.
In failing to keep track of
either life, The Passenger melts.
Leaving nothing of any
substance. The seven minutes at
the end that have been raved
about — which pass like as many
hours — are ambiguous,
confusing, and unsatisfying. The
Passenger is to be avoided at all
costs.

Robertson's life, it is as though
it's forgotten. There is an
occasional scene with sparse
humor achieved as Locke meets
with Robertson's associates, who
turn out to be buying guns for
the African revolutionaries.
This association fades into
the distance, and as he turns up
in the cities written in
Robertson's appointment book,
nothing connected with the dead
man ever seems to happen as
Locke never attempts to do
anything about fulfilling
Robertson's contracts.
Locke seems obsessed with
moving ahead, but he never
seems to fully take over
Robertson's life. Fortunately,
Jack Nicholson is very
charismatic — he has an
undeniable screen presence.
Maria Schneider's beauty and
delicate voice are equally
appealing, but they cannot keep
the movie from being not only a
waste of time but also quickly
forgettable.
The question of the identity
of the passenger is never
answered — is it Locke riding on
Robertson's life, or the girl
riding with Locke? Is this
supposed to mean we are all
riding along complacently in our
lives, and are not really living
them? Does it mean we are all
passengers, or something deep
like that? Not that I care, of
course.
In failing to keep track of
either life, The Passenger melts.

Every man, if only for a
moment, yearns to live another
man's life. Therein lies the
premise for Michelangelo
Antonioni's ( Blow-Up, Zabriskie
Point) new movie, The
Passenger, starring Jack
Nicholson (Chinatown) and
Maria Schneider (Last Tango In
Paris).
The Passenger is a story of a
man so bored with his own life
that he exchanges it for that of a
heart attack victim in his hotel,
keeping the dead man's
appointments and taking on his
affairs. Much could be done with
a stimulating premise like this,
but Antonioni seems to go out
of his way to avoid anything
interesting, and instead delivers a
movie as riveting as an I Love
Lucy rerun.
The Passenger is undeniably
one of the most boring movies I
have ever been subjected to.
Although it's only two hours, it
seems like a double feature of
Lawrence of Arabia and Dr.
Zhivago.
Antonioni seems obsessed in
the beginning with long pans of
the African desert where
journalist David Locke
(Nicholson) is searching for a
band of revolutionaries. On&
expects to see something that
should be noticed, that will help
to understand the movie, but
there's nothing.
This is to emphasize Locke's
isolation from the world. It also
helps to isolate the viewer from
any interest for the movie. The
Passenger is rife with symbolism,
but unfortunately, only
Antonioni knows about it.
It's one of those movies
where everything has a special
significance, but darned if any of
it can be understood.
Much is made of Locke's
isolation. As a journalist, always
observing, he feels alienated and
eventually tires of this existence,
even though he is successful at
it, and wants to experience
rather than watch. Perhaps all of
us at one time or another wish
to pack up and move on,
forsaking our old lives and
starting all over again.
"Can't we throw it all away
day by day?" asks Locke. When
a stranger named Robertson in
the room next to his at their
African hotel dies, Locke
exchanges pictures of their
passports and lets it be known
that it is Locke who has had a
heart attack.
His wife and employer then
try to track down Robertson,
whom they assume was the last
one to see Locke alive. If this
confuses you, you have a good
idea of what the movie is like.

It begins to bounce back and
forth between being a chase
movie complete with wild
driving and an exercise in
undecipherable symbolism.
Although Locke has taken
Robertson's life, it is as though
it's forgotten. There is an
occasional scene with sparse
humor achieved as Locke meets
with Robertson's associates, who
turn out to be buying guns for
the African revolutionaries.
