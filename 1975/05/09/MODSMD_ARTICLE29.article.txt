## Spring Football Finale Alums Ready For Bone-Crusher 
### JIM WASCHER 
The number of broken bones
might well exceed the number of
broken plays tomorrow when a
squad of notable Stanford
football alumni squares off
against Jack Christiansen's 1975
Cardinals beginning at 10 a.m. in
the Stadium.
"It'll be important for us to
play hard just to avoid being
hurt," said 1972 Rose Bowl
Player-of-the-Game Don Bunce,

scheduled to be the alumni's
starting quarterback. Bunce
himself suffered a slight groin
muscle pull Wednesday during
the alums' first practice.
He will be joined by Rose
Bowl teammates Jeff Siemon
(Minnesota Vikings), Bob Moore
(Oakland Raiders), Pete La/etich
(San Diego Chargers), Dave
Tipton (also of the Chargers)
and Jackie Brown (Stanford Law
School).

The main attraction of the
game, though, might be the
match-up featuring outstanding
Card defensive end Duncan
McColl and his father, Bill, who
earned All-American honors here
two years in a row as an
offensive end in the early '50s.
The elder McColl is now a
prominent orthopedic surgeon
practicing in West Covinaaftera
brilliant career with the Chicago
Bears.

Tomorrow's contest replaces
the annual Red-White intrasquad
game. It will be the first alumni
tilt here since 1964. Tickets, on
sale at the gate beginning at 9
a.m., will be priced at $1.
Thin Squad
"We have only 75 players out
for spring football," Christiansen
explained, "and we're very thin
at some positions, so it's almost
impossible to split up the
squad." In addition, Chris hopes
the game will bolster relations
between current players and
alumni.
While the alums have held
some informal practices this
week, they still may not be in
the greatest form. "There were a
couple of guys out there who
haven't played for 10 years,"
Bunce said. "They're still
wearing those high-top shoes."
Bunce, a second-year medical
school student here, admits,
"I've picked up a ball twice in
the last year and a half, and once
it was just to move it from one
part of the house to another."
The game should be an
entertaining affair, nevertheless.
Old skills are rarely forgotten.
Playing For Fun
"We're just going to approach
the game with the idea of having
a good time," Bunce said. Even
so. he ventured that "it might be
a close game."
Frosh JV Coach Doug Single,
a 1973 graduate who is doubling
as the head coach for the alums,
said his team is "going to try to
have some fun, play-wise, and
open it up with a lot of passing."
Single's secret weapon is a
working knowledge of the
Cardinals' game plan. "I've got
one big advantage because I've
scouted those guys for four
weeks," he said confidently.
But it won't hurt a bit to
have players like All-Pro guard
Blaine Nye of the Callas
Cowboys, safety Jack Schultz,
receivers Eric Cross, Jack Lasater
and Miles Moore, linebacker Ron
Kadziel, defensive tackle Larry
Butler, kicker Steve Horowitz,
cornerback Charles McCloud,
offensive guard Younger
Klippert and quarterback Dave
Ottmar.
