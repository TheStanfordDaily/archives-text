# Draw Results Distributed

### 
The official round one housing
draw cutoff numbers, released
yesterday by the housing office, are
2001 for men and 3125 for women, as
the Daily reported Monday.
Response cards indicating one's
round one assignment can be picked
up at residence hal! offices.
Off-campus students can obtain theirs
at the housing office. Cards must be
returned no later than Tuesday if one
wishes to enter round two of the draw.
Any student who receives an
assignment in round one but fails to
enter round two will lose his round
one assignment and the opportunity to
claim a draw number priority on the
housing waiting list. Only students
who entered round one are eligible to
participate in the second round.
All priorities operating in round
one will hold for round two. The
principles governing round two
assignments are similar to those of
round one, except that each student
receiving a specific assignment in
round one has priority to retain that
assignment.
However, 48 spaces in ZAP house
formerly alloted to the International
Relations and Arms Control residential
housing program will be available for
assignment. ZAP will not be a special
priority house but will be assigned in
the same manner as Row houses such
as Lathrop and Durand.
Any student entering round two of
the draw and receiving an assignment
is expected to accept that assignment.
If he chooses not to accept the
assignment, or accepts the assignment
and then cancels before August 1, he
will be charged a $10 administrative
fee.
After August 1, any student who
chooses to cancel his assignment,
whether made through the draw or
through waiting lists, will lose his $50
housing deposit.
In round one, 2554 spaces are filled
from the 3760 students who entered
the draw. Only 2005 students were
assigned in last year's first round, out
of a total entering of 3676, because
restrictions on the assignment of
people to Manzanita and Mirrielees.
