Women Putters
The women golfers took their
first Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) Meet
Championship of the season at
Sacramento State yesterday.
The putters nailed down first
place with a strong 365 score,
eight better than second-place
Santa Clara. Santa Clara took
the first meet last April 22, with
Pat Cornett taking the individual
title.
This time, Cornett came in
second, but it wasn't an
opponent in first place.
Stanford's Pam Palmieri took
the individual honors with a 78
score, one better than Cornett's
79. Ellen Sale's 98 was third best
for the golfers.
Cornett and Palmieri are both
going to Eugene next weekend

to play in the University of
Oregon Invitational. Coach
Carrol Diaz is optimistic about
their added value to the team
after a winning performance. "If
Pat and Pam do well up there,
we should be able to win the
final NCIAC meet (at Stanford
on May 23)," Diaz said before
yesterday's win.
Women's Superstars
Ever heard of ABC's
Superstars competitions? Well,
Stanford's Women's Recreation
Association (WRA) is sponsoring
its own version of the popular
concept. The first Women's
Decathlon will start tomorrow at
10 p.m. in the Roble gym.
The competition is open to
all women: faculty, staff and
students. For a modest $1 entry
fee, entrants will participate in:
pool, bowling, golf, swimming
and track. Morning events
(Swimming golf, etc.) will take
place at the Roble gym. By
mid-morning, Tresidder will host
the bowling and pool events, and
after lunch the final events will
take place at Angell field.
Prizes will be awarded to the
highest overall scorers, but
everybody, losers especially, will
be able to console themselves
with beer and food after the
events at Masters Memorial
Picnic Grounds.

interested members at Roble

Field Hockey
With interest in women's field

hockey increasing rapidly in this
area, a move towards
development of a Santa Clara
county league has started.
Outside of Stanford's
women's team, which competes
in a college league, there is
presently no organization for
area piayers. But if Penny
Manser has her way, field
hockey enthusiasts will have
their own loop soon.
Manser has attempted to
drum up enthusiasm on the
Stanford campus in a variety of
ways. To exhibit the seriousness
of the women, Manser has
helped to start a trial league for
the summer. In addition, she has
tried to publicize the sport by
scheduling an exhibition match
during the summer.
Some of the present Stanford
varsity players will scrimmage
against a team made up of San
Jose Earthquake soccer players.
Although the match won't be
played until Aug. 30,
arrangements have already been
set for the donation of the
funds. Fifty percent of the profits
will go to the Police Athletic
League of San Jose, 25 percent
of the Special Olympics Program
for the Mentally Retarded and
the remainder will be distributed
to various athletic recreation
clubs at Stanford that are not
supported by University funds.
Help is needed with all
aspects of the exhibition. Even
prospective players are
encouraged to contact Manser at
923-7957 after 6 p.m.

Women Putters
The women golfers took their
first Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) Meet
Championship of the season at
Sacramento State yesterday.
The putters nailed down first
place with a strong 365 score,
eight better than second-place
Santa Clara. Santa Clara took
the first meet last April 22, with
Pat Cornett taking the individual
title.
This time, Cornett came in
second, but it wasn't an
opponent in first place.
Stanford's Pam Palmieri took
the individual honors with a 78
score, one better than Cornett's
79. Ellen Sale's 98 was third best
for the golfers.
Cornett and Palmieri are both
going to Eugene next weekend

to play in the University of
Oregon Invitational. Coach
Carrol Diaz is optimistic about
their added value to the team
after a winning performance. "If
Pat and Pam do well up there,
we should be able to win the
final NCIAC meet (at Stanford
on May 23)," Diaz said before
yesterday's win.
Women's Superstars
Ever heard of ABC's
Superstars competitions? Well,
Stanford's Women's Recreation
Association (WRA) is sponsoring
its own version of the popular
concept. The first Women's
Decathlon will start tomorrow at
10 p.m. in the Roble gym.
The competition is open to
all women: faculty, staff and
students. For a modest $1 entry
fee, entrants will participate in:
pool, bowling, golf, swimming
and track. Morning events
(Swimming golf, etc.) will take
place at the Roble gym. By
mid-morning, Tresidder will host
the bowling and pool events, and
after lunch the final events will
take place at Angell field.
Prizes will be awarded to the
highest overall scorers, but
everybody, losers especially, will
be able to console themselves
with beer and food after the
events at Masters Memorial
Picnic Grounds.
There is a sign-up list for
interested members at Roble

Field Hockey
With interest in women's field

hockey increasing rapidly in this
area, a move towards
development of a Santa Clara
county league has started.
Outside of Stanford's
women's team, which competes
in a college league, there is
presently no organization for
area piayers. But if Penny
Manser has her way, field
hockey enthusiasts will have
their own loop soon.
Manser has attempted to
drum up enthusiasm on the
Stanford campus in a variety of
ways. To exhibit the seriousness
of the women, Manser has
helped to start a trial league for
the summer. In addition, she has
tried to publicize the sport by
scheduling an exhibition match
during the summer.
Some of the present Stanford
varsity players will scrimmage
against a team made up of San
Jose Earthquake soccer players.
Although the match won't be
played until Aug. 30,
arrangements have already been
set for the donation of the
funds. Fifty percent of the profits
will go to the Police Athletic
League of San Jose, 25 percent
of the Special Olympics Program
for the Mentally Retarded and
the remainder will be distributed
to various athletic recreation
clubs at Stanford that are not
supported by University funds.
Help is needed with all
