# Batters Need Miracle

### PAUL BAUMAN 
It's the final weekend of the
season and Stanford must play
for pride while USC uses the
opportunity to tune up for
post-season play.
Sound familiar? This time the
sport is baseball. The Trojans
have clinched the Pae-8
Southern Division title and will
go on to meet the Northern
Division champion after their
weekend series with UCLA.
Stanford, meanwhile, will likely
give its best against Cal
tomorrow and Sunday and then
reminisce over a highly
successful, but frustrating
season.
Actually, there is a chance
that Stanford could gain a berth
in the NCAA Championships as
a second-place team. There's also
a chance the San Francisco
Giants will win the National
League pennant this year. You
get the idea.
Stanford's first step would be
to win two of the three Cal
games, or sweep the series. Step
two would be for USC to defeat
the Northern Division winner,
probably leaving Stanford as the
Pac-B's second-best team. The
Cards' NCAA prospects would
then be subject to the discretion
of the conference and NCAA
directors would decide whether
to accept Stanford or another
club to play in the Rocky
Mountain Regional. It doesn't
look good. The Cards are 36-20
overall, but only 8-7 in the
Pac-8.
Cal is in last place in the
Pac-8 Southern Division with a
4-9 record, but the Bears took
two out of three from Stanford

in last month's series.
"I hope Cal doesn't have the
same kind of weekend as when
we first played them," Coach
Ray Young said. "Cal has
become a good hitting team. We
need a good crowd. Student
support would help us out an
awful lot."
The two teams will meet
tomorrow at noon for a
doubleheader at Sunken
Diamond and then travel to
Berkeley for a season-ending
single game Sunday starting at 1
p.m. Young will start Mike
Williamson (6-3) and A 1 Arthur
(8-4) Saturday, and John Yandle
(5-5) on Sunday.
If the Cards combine
pitching, defense and hitting
against Cal as they did
Wednesday against U.C. Davis,
they'll be in good shape.
Stanford handed the Aggies
(25-18) their first shutout of the
year, 3-0, with Jim
Scharffenberger, Bruce Davis,
and Yandle combining on a

three-hitter. Scharffenberger
(4-2) started and won, going five
innings and giving up a
fourth-inning single and no
walks.
"He was smooth, and in
control of himself," Young said.
"When he pitches like that, he
can beat anybody."
Bruce Robinson, whose 12th
home run Tuesday broke
Stanford's single season record,
hit a 400-foot solo shot for
number 13 in the second inning
off Davis's Roger McKay (5-2)
giving Scharffenberger and his
successors all the runs they
needed. Robinson also knocked
in Stanford's second run with a
sacrifice fly to center field in the
third following a walk by Dave
Baker and a double by Gary
Pitch ford.
Stanford added its final run
in the fifth when, with two out.
Steve Davis reached second base
on an infield hit and an error,
and Tom Guardino doubled him
home with a long drive.
