# Laxmen Riding High On Five-Game Streak
## 
### 
A lot of scoring and a lot of
winning.
Stanford's lacrosse team?
That's right. The laxmen have
won five straight games, with a
total of 71 goals. Led by
midfielder Joe Stratton and
attackmen Grey "Kid" Hoberg
and Whit Budge, the team has
scored at least 12 goals per
game.

Last week, the Cards won
three games in two days while
taking first place in the
Northwest Invitational Lacrosse
Tournament at Oregon.
And this weekend the offense
exploded for 18 goals against
Northern California Lacrosse
Association title contender
Golden Gate.
The laxmen have two
must-win matches before the
squad can claim a spot in the
NCLA playoffs. Tomorrow, the
Palo Alto Lacrosse Club visits
Stanford in the first of the two
matches.
On May 15, league rival Cal
meets the Cards, and if Stanford
has lost to Palo Alto or loses to
Cal, it would be the team's last
match of the long season.
