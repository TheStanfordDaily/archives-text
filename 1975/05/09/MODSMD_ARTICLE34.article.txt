# Five Cards Advance Into Cal-State Quarterfinals
## 
### RON BECK 
PORTOLA VALLEY -
Maybe it's the pressure of being
number two, or maybe it's the
great spring weather of the past
couple days. But whatever is
responsible for the resurgence of
outstanding play by the
Stanford tennis squad is doing a
mighty fine job.
The Card netters have done
just about everything right so far
at the California State
Championships at the Alpine
Hills Tennis and Swim Club. Of
the eight quarterfinalists in the
men's singles tourney, five are
Stanford players, and three of
the remaining eight doubles pairs
are also Cards.
A few of the Stanford players
have been extremely successful
in the tourney thus far. Nick
Saviano toppled San Jose State's
Hank Pfister in straight sets
yesterday. Pfister is the same
guy who only two weeks ago
looked like the best bet for the
NCAA singles crown.
Jim Delaney took apart

ex-Card Rick Fisher in a fast 6-2,
6-2 win. The only thing that
kept Delaney from winning in
under 45 minutes was a
mandatory interruption caused
by a swarm of thousands of
bees.
Lots Of Buzzes
Bees flew all over two of the
courts (also disrupting
Whitlinger's match) and cleared
out a large part of the crowd for
about an hour. Both Whit and
Delaney resumed their matches
on other courts while a
beekeeper captured all of the
malcontents.
One of the other surprises for
Stanford is the play of Bill Maze.
Wednesday, Maze knocked off
Chico Hagey, last year's Cal
State and NCAA runnerup, in
three sets. Yesterday Maze beat
Bob Hansen of San Jose State.
John Whitlinger had trouble
with his control against San
Jose's Joe Meyers, but came
from a 3-1 deficit in the third set
to win. Whit is scheduled to
meet defending champion Jim

McManus in today's action. It's
rare that the number one seed in
a tournament (which Whit is)
meets the defending champion
in as early a round as the
quarterfinals, but that's the way
the draw was set up.
The tournament continues
through the weekend.
* * *
While the men have been
having a grand time in the valley,
the women's team has been
doing a little bit of traveling.
The women concluded their
dual-match season Wednesday
with identical 6-0 whitewashes
over both the University of the
Pacific and Mills College.
The squad is splitting up
today and tomorrow to enter
both the UCLA and Modesto
Invitational tournament. Coach
Curly Neal has sent her top
players to UCLA to compete in
the unofficial Pac-8
championship tourney.
Playing first singles will be
Marcy O'Keefe. Lele Forood and
Andrea Barnes are playing at
second and third singles,
respectively. Forood and
O'Keefe displaced Liza Pande
and Whitney Grant as the top
doubles team, while Barnes and
Tracy Macnair remain in the
third doubles slot

PORTOLA VALLEY -
Maybe it's the pressure of being
number two, or maybe it's the
great spring weather of the past
couple days. But whatever is
responsible for the resurgence of
outstanding play by the
Stanford tennis squad is doing a
mighty fine job.
The Card netters have done
just about everything right so far
at the California State
Championships at the Alpine
Hills Tennis and Swim Club. Of
the eight quarterfinalists in the
men's singles tourney, five are
Stanford players, and three of
the remaining eight doubles pairs
are also Cards.
A few of the Stanford players
have been extremely successful
in the tourney thus far. Nick
Saviano toppled San Jose State's
Hank Pfister in straight sets
yesterday. Pfister is the same
guy who only two weeks ago
looked like the best bet for the
NCAA singles crown.
Jim Delaney took apart

ex-Card Rick Fisher in a fast 6-2,
6-2 win. The only thing that
kept Delaney from winning in
under 45 minutes was a
mandatory interruption caused
by a swarm of thousands of
bees.
Lots Of Buzzes
Bees flew all over two of the
courts (also disrupting
Whitlinger's match) and cleared
out a large part of the crowd for
about an hour. Both Whit and
Delaney resumed their matches
on other courts while a
beekeeper captured all of the
malcontents.
One of the other surprises for
Stanford is the play of Bill Maze.
Wednesday, Maze knocked off
Chico Hagey, last year's Cal
State and NCAA runnerup, in
three sets. Yesterday Maze beat
Bob Hansen of San Jose State.
John Whitlinger had trouble
with his control against San
Jose's Joe Meyers, but came
from a 3-1 deficit in the third set
to win. Whit is scheduled to
meet defending champion Jim

McManus in today's action. It's
rare that the number one seed in
a tournament (which Whit is)
meets the defending champion
in as early a round as the
quarterfinals, but that's the way
the draw was set up.
The tournament continues
through the weekend.
* * *
While the men have been
having a grand time in the valley,
the women's team has been
doing a little bit of traveling.
The women concluded their
dual-match season Wednesday
with identical 6-0 whitewashes
over both the University of the
Pacific and Mills College.
The squad is splitting up
today and tomorrow to enter
both the UCLA and Modesto
Invitational tournament. Coach
Curly Neal has sent her top
players to UCLA to compete in
the unofficial Pac-8
championship tourney.
Playing first singles will be
Marcy O'Keefe. Lele Forood and
Andrea Barnes are playing at
second and third singles,
respectively. Forood and
O'Keefe displaced Liza Pande
and Whitney Grant as the top
doubles team, while Barnes and
Tracy Macnair remain in the
third doubles slot
