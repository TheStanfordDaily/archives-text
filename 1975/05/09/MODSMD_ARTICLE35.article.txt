# IM Roundup
## Los Arcos: Tops 
### PETE BHATIA 
Los Areos took the team championship and SLAC's Dave Faust
the individual title last Sunday in the annual intramural bike race
at SLAC.
Los Arcos got its winning points from Gene Duval, Rob Hager
and Dave Voss, who finished fourth, fifth and seventh in the
10-mile race. Faust, who won by about 30 yards going away, was
timed at 25:47.
The Hog Ridin' Fools, the pre-race favorite, finished a decent
second — although they had to resort to some unethical
hanky-panky to do that. El Cuadro was third, led by third place
finisher Doug Wilson and eighth place Clara Teyssier. SLAC was
fourth, led by Faust and Soto was fifth with Bruce Carlsmith and
Andrew Staatz in 13th and 14th.
The team win earned Los Arcos 25 IM points. The Fools will
receive 20, El Cuadro 15, SLAC 12 and Soto, 10.

In volleyball, the tentative
seedings for "A" volleyball were
released this week at an IM
office press conference and, to
no one's surprise, the defending
champion and so far undefeated
Theta Delt "A" team was seeded
first.
The Theta Delts finished the
regular season at 5-0 Wednesday
with a 15-8, 15-12 victory over
previously undefeated Roble.
Roble also will qualify for the
playoffs. Other tentative
seedings include Porf I — second.
El Tigre — third Serra — fourth
and either JRA A 2, the Leptons
or the Iranians at fifth.
The "B" seedings will be
announced next week along with
the seedings for the "A" and
"B" softball tournaments.
Playoffs for both sports are
slated to begin on Saturday, May
16. All volleyball teams should
report all their seasons results,
win or lose, to the IM office by
5 pm. today to insure
consideration for points and/or
to be placed in the playoffs.
* * *
And in the sport that really
counts, horseshoes, Lambda Nu
has placed two teams into the
quarterfinals. The Nudies, under
the coaching of New Yorker
Marc "Action" Judson, have
been the surprise of the draw.
Judson claims that the Nudies
are so successful because of "our
chutzpah
* * *
Finally, in softball, those
rugged Armadillos shocked the
sporting world for the third
week in a row with an 11-4
victory over the DU's. Awesome.

seedings for "A" volleyball were
released this week at an IM
office press conference and, to
no one's surprise, the defending
champion and so far undefeated
Theta Delt "A" team was seeded
first.
The Theta Delts finished the
regular season at 5-0 Wednesday
with a 15-8, 15-12 victory over
previously undefeated Roble.
Roble also will qualify for the
playoffs. Other tentative
seedings include Porf I — second.
El Tigre — third Serra — fourth
and either JRA A 2, the Leptons
or the Iranians at fifth.
The "B" seedings will be
announced next week along with
the seedings for the "A" and
"B" softball tournaments.
Playoffs for both sports are
slated to begin on Saturday, May
16. All volleyball teams should
report all their seasons results,
win or lose, to the IM office by
5 pm. today to insure
consideration for points and/or
to be placed in the playoffs.

And in the sport that really
counts, horseshoes, Lambda Nu
has placed two teams into the
quarterfinals. The Nudies, under
the coaching of New Yorker
Marc "Action" Judson, have
been the surprise of the draw.
Judson claims that the Nudies
are so successful because of "our
chutzpah

Finally, in softball, those
rugged Armadillos shocked the
sporting world for the third
week in a row with an 11-4
victory over the DU's. Awesome.

WISHING IT IN — Dave Baskins is one of the six reasons why
Stanford is rated as one of the top teams in the NCAA. Baskins,
the S.F. City Champ, currently leads the team with a 73.9 average.
Los Areos took the team championship and SLAC's Dave Faust
the individual title last Sunday in the annual intramural bike race
at SLAC.
Los Arcos got its winning points from Gene Duval, Rob Hager
and Dave Voss, who finished fourth, fifth and seventh in the
10-mile race. Faust, who won by about 30 yards going away, was
timed at 25:47.
The Hog Ridin' Fools, the pre-race favorite, finished a decent
second — although they had to resort to some unethical
hanky-panky to do that. El Cuadro was third, led by third place
finisher Doug Wilson and eighth place Clara Teyssier. SLAC was
fourth, led by Faust and Soto was fifth with Bruce Carlsmith and
Andrew Staatz in 13th and 14th.
The team win earned Los Arcos 25 IM points. The Fools will
receive 20, El Cuadro 15, SLAC 12 and Soto, 10.
