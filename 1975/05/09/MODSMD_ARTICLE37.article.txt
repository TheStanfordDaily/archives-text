# Golfers Prepared For Tough Week
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
After three months of birdies,
bogeys, victories and
disappointments, it has finally
become apparent that Stanford
has six outstanding individual
golfers.
In the next five days, Coach
Bud Finger will find out if those
six players comprise a
championship team.
Today and tomorrow,
Stanford, USC, UCLA and
California will compete for the
Pacific Eight Southern Division
championship at Half Moon Bay.
Immediately following
tomorrow's final round, all four
teams will fly to Eugene, Ore.,
to join the Northern Division
schools for the 16th annual
Pac-8 tournament.
The two events are perhaps
the most grueling back-to-back
tournaments in amateur golf.
The Southern Division teams
will play 36 holes today and 18
tomorrow, while the Pac-8
tourney consists of 36 holes
Monday and 36 more on
Tuesday.
It seems certain that Stanford
and USC will battle for the
Southern Division crown, with
host Oregon challenging USC
and Stanford in the Pac-8 event.
Those three schools have
combined for 11 of 15 previous
championships.
"USC has to be favored,"
Finger said, "and Oregon could
do pretty well playing on their
home course. But if we play
right, we can win it."
Last year the Cards played
exactly right, winning the
tournament by a convincing 24
shots over runnerup USC on the
Stanford course.
AH three top individuals
return from last year's event.
Oregon's Peter Jacobsen
compiled a four-under-par 280
total to win the championship,
while Stanford's Aly Trompas
and George Pettinger finished
two and three strokes back,

respectively.
This year, Trompas and
Pettinger will join Dave Baskins,
Conrad Nilmeier, Mike Peck and
Jay Johnston in the Cardinal
lineup for both events.
Nilmeier will be looking for
his second victory of the year at
the challenging Half Moon Bay
course. He won the Confidence
Masters tournament there over
spring break.

Watson, a 1971 Stanford
graduate, has made tentative
plans to hold an exhibition here
on Oct. 6 to raise money for
varsity golf scholarships. The
Athletic Department announced
last month that golf would no
longer receive any scholarship
funds.
Watson has reportedly lined
up Hubert Green, Forest Fezler,
John Mahaffey and several other
touring pros.

Watson, a 1971 Stanford
graduate, has made tentative
plans to hold an exhibition here
on Oct. 6 to raise money for
varsity golf scholarships. The
Athletic Department announced
last month that golf would no
longer receive any scholarship
funds.
Watson has reportedly lined
up Hubert Green, Forest Fezler,
John Mahaffey and several other
touring pros.
After three months of birdies,
bogeys, victories and
disappointments, it has finally
become apparent that Stanford
has six outstanding individual
golfers.
In the next five days, Coach
Bud Finger will find out if those
six players comprise a
championship team.
Today and tomorrow,
Stanford, USC, UCLA and
California will compete for the
Pacific Eight Southern Division
championship at Half Moon Bay.
Immediately following
tomorrow's final round, all four
teams will fly to Eugene, Ore.,
to join the Northern Division
schools for the 16th annual
Pac-8 tournament.
The two events are perhaps
the most grueling back-to-back
tournaments in amateur golf.
The Southern Division teams
will play 36 holes today and 18
tomorrow, while the Pac-8
tourney consists of 36 holes
Monday and 36 more on
Tuesday.
It seems certain that Stanford
and USC will battle for the
Southern Division crown, with
host Oregon challenging USC
and Stanford in the Pac-8 event.
Those three schools have
combined for 11 of 15 previous
championships.
"USC has to be favored,"
Finger said, "and Oregon could
do pretty well playing on their
home course. But if we play
right, we can win it."
Last year the Cards played
exactly right, winning the
tournament by a convincing 24
shots over runnerup USC on the
Stanford course.
AH three top individuals
return from last year's event.
Oregon's Peter Jacobsen
compiled a four-under-par 280
total to win the championship,
while Stanford's Aly Trompas
and George Pettinger finished
two and three strokes back,

respectively.
This year, Trompas and
Pettinger will join Dave Baskins,
Conrad Nilmeier, Mike Peck and
Jay Johnston in the Cardinal
lineup for both events.
Nilmeier will be looking for
his second victory of the year at
the challenging Half Moon Bay
course. He won the Confidence
Masters tournament there over
spring break.
