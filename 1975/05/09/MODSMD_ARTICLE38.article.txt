# Spikers In Relays
## Off To The Races 
### RON BECK 
It's been a long season for the
Stanford track team. Sure, there
have been some good times for
the squad, but overall the
Cardinals (2-4) in dual matches
for the season, haven't had much
to cheer about.
But the season continues.
Tomorrow the spikers will be
represented by 15 team members
at the West Coast Relays at
Fresno. And again, prospects for
a win are slim at best.
After last weekend's 103-42
shellacking at the hands of
California, the Cards don't have
to worry about trying to regroup
for any more dual meets. The
dual-meet season has ended, and
none too soon for Stanford.
Specific Preparation
Coach Payton Jordan can
concentrate on preparing some
of the squad's standouts for the
upcoming Pac-8 and, hopefully,
NCAA toumeys. The Pac-8s are
next weekend at Washington St.,
and UCLA and USC are the only
two teams that will really be
fighting for the title.
Last weekend, while Cal was
walking over the Cards, the
Bruins and Trojans put on a
tremendous show for track and
field fans. At stake was the

fictitious title of national
dual-meet champion. UCLA
pulled out a 75-70 victory over
USC in the second-to-last event,
the triple jump.
Don't expect it to be much of
a surprise to anybody if UCLA
goes all the way.
The Cards could get a chance
to spoil the Bruins' hopes next
weekend with some strong
showings in some of the events.
Possible Displacement
If Stanford can displace any
Bruin point-getters in the
eighUchool meet, the Trojans could
slip by. But that's not what
Jordan is shooting for. Jordan
wants Stanford to place high in
any of the events, so that they
can qualify for the NCAA
tourney. And that's where this
weekend's meet comes in.
The 15 Cards entered in the
meet will all get a final fling at
league competition before the
Pac-Bs. Top NCAA hope Tony
Sandoval, Stanford's premier
two-miler, will join Mark
McConnell in the event for
Stanford.
Pole vaulter Bob Flint, and
triple-jumper Mike Hall, the only
Cardinal to win events against
Cal, are both entered tomorrow.

fictitious title of national
dual-meet champion. UCLA
pulled out a 75-70 victory over
USC in the second-to-last event,
the triple jump.
Don't expect it to be much of
a surprise to anybody if UCLA
goes all the way.
The Cards could get a chance
to spoil the Bruins' hopes next
weekend with some strong
showings in some of the events.
Possible Displacement
If Stanford can displace any
Bruin point-getters in the
eighUchool meet, the Trojans could
slip by. But that's not what
Jordan is shooting for. Jordan
wants Stanford to place high in
any of the events, so that they
can qualify for the NCAA
tourney. And that's where this
weekend's meet comes in.
The 15 Cards entered in the
meet will all get a final fling at
league competition before the
Pac-Bs. Top NCAA hope Tony
Sandoval, Stanford's premier
two-miler, will join Mark
McConnell in the event for
Stanford.
Pole vaulter Bob Flint, and
triple-jumper Mike Hall, the only
Cardinal to win events against
Cal, are both entered tomorrow.
