Legislature Okays Sex, Nixes Pot
SACRAMENTO — The California Legislature approved
a sex bill of rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals, but
a bill easing marijuana penalties stalled two steps away
from passage yesterday.
The assembly narrowly approved the sex bill — despite
heavy lobbying from church groups — but refused by
three votes to approve a bill sharply reducing penalties for
possession of small amounts of pot.
Democratic Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. has commented
positively on both bills and is expected to sign both if
they reach his desk. Marijuana bill sponsors said they
would try again later to get the bill approved.
Passage of the so-called "consenting adults" bill was
hailed by its author, Democratic Assemblyman Willie
Brown of San Francisco, as a step toward granting
"personal, individual freedoms."
The sex bill tosses out numerous sections of the state's
100-year-old sex laws and legalizes sex acts in private
between consenting adults of the same or opposite sex. It
won in a 45-26 vote.
Sen. George Moscone, a Democratic candidate for
mayor of San Francisco, sponsored the marijuana bill. It
sets a fine similar to a parking ticket for possession of
small amounts of marijuana.
"People voted for their own interest in political
self-preservation rather than for the bill on its merits,"
Moscone said angrily after the measure went down to
defeat.
Vietnam Reopens Communieations
BANGKOK — South Vietnam began to reestablish
contact with the rest of the world yesterday while
neighboring Cambodia, declaring its determination to go it
alone, sent out most of the remaining known foreign
refugees from its borders.
In Saigon, the government held its first news
conference since the South Vietnamese capital fell April
30.
On Wednesday the government permitted newsmen
begin filing news dispatches for the first time since the
city fell.
Several of the 550 foreign evacuees arriving in Thailand
from Phnom Penh described the Cambodian capital as a
"dead city," littered with decomposing bodies and
abandoned household goods.
They said the city was populated only by stray pets
and Khmer Rouge soldiers. Earlier evacuees, in accounts
released yesterday, told mixed tales of killings and
kindness from the Khmer Rouge.
The new evacuees said an unknown number of
Westerners, including two Americans, were still believed
to be inside Cambodia.
House To Aet On Refugee Aid
WASHINGTON — President Ford's emergency aid
request for Indochina refugees was cleared for House
action next week by one committee last night and cut to
$405 million by another congressional panel.
The House foreign operations appropriations
subcommittee trimmed the President's $507 million aid
request for 150,000 refugees down to $405 million,

generally basing its action on figures showing the actual
number of refugees involved now totals about 114,000.
Gun Linked To Foster Murder
SACRAMENTO — Bullets and shell casings from a gun
seized in the arrest of Joseph Remiro and Russell Little
were linked yesterday by a criminologist to the
assassination of Marcus Foster.
John Davis, an Oakland police criminologist, testified
that a .380-caliber Walther pistol taken from Remiro fired
bullets both in the Nov. 6, 1973 murder of Foster and in
the shootout with Concord police Jan. 10, 1974.
Symbionese Liberation Army members Remiro, 28,
and Little, 25, are on trial for murder in the death of
Foster, a nationally known black educator who was
superintendent of scnools in Oakland.
Brown To Ask For Drilling Delay
LOS ANGELES — California will take the federal
government to court unless a federal plan to lease
Southern California offshore land to oil companies is
delayed, a spokesman for Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said
yesterday.
Brown will ask Interior Secretary Rogers Morton for
the delay in the next week, said Anthony Kline, the
governor's legal affairs secretary.
Brezhnev Seeks Improved Detente
MOSCOW — Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev
expressed hope yesterday the end of war in Vietnam will
bring better U.S.-Soviet relations. He sent a cordial
message to President Ford to mark the 30th anniversary
of V-E Day.
Brezhnev's letter to Ford, published by the official
Soviet news agency Tass, said "substantial positive
changes have been achieved in Soviet-American relations
as a result of efforts made by our countries."
"The elimination of the hotbed of war in Indochina
creates the conditions for a further improvement of the
international atmosphere," Brezhnev said.
Brezhnev's conciliatory comments, the first about
Vietnam by a major Soviet leader, were one more sign
that the Soviets were taking a cautious approach to the
communist victory in the south for the sake of
maintaining Soviet-American detente.
Wholesale Prices Go Back Up
WASHINGTON — Soaring farm prices drove the
wholesale price index up 1.5 percent in April, reversing a
four-month decline and signaling higher grocery bills, the
government said yesterday.
As the Labor Department reported the wholesale price
rise, the Agriculture Department forecast a six to eight
percent rise in retail food prices this year.
Today's Weather
Low clouds this morning. Mostly sunny this afternoon
becoming cloudy with chance of showers tonight and
tomorrow. Lows tonight in mid 40s to low 50s. Highs
today and tomorrow in upper 50s and 60s. Variable winds
5 to 15 mph becoming southwest 10 to 20 mph late
today. Chance of rain 30 percent tonight.

SACRAMENTO — The California Legislature approved
a sex bill of rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals, but
a bill easing marijuana penalties stalled two steps away
from passage yesterday.
The assembly narrowly approved the sex bill — despite
heavy lobbying from church groups — but refused by
three votes to approve a bill sharply reducing penalties for
possession of small amounts of pot.
Democratic Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. has commented
positively on both bills and is expected to sign both if
they reach his desk. Marijuana bill sponsors said they
would try again later to get the bill approved.
Passage of the so-called "consenting adults" bill was
hailed by its author, Democratic Assemblyman Willie
Brown of San Francisco, as a step toward granting
"personal, individual freedoms."
The sex bill tosses out numerous sections of the state's
100-year-old sex laws and legalizes sex acts in private
between consenting adults of the same or opposite sex. It
won in a 45-26 vote.
Sen. George Moscone, a Democratic candidate for
mayor of San Francisco, sponsored the marijuana bill. It
sets a fine similar to a parking ticket for possession of
small amounts of marijuana.
"People voted for their own interest in political
self-preservation rather than for the bill on its merits,"
Moscone said angrily after the measure went down to
defeat.
Vietnam Reopens Communieations
BANGKOK — South Vietnam began to reestablish
contact with the rest of the world yesterday while
neighboring Cambodia, declaring its determination to go it
alone, sent out most of the remaining known foreign
refugees from its borders.
In Saigon, the government held its first news
conference since the South Vietnamese capital fell April
30.
On Wednesday the government permitted newsmen
begin filing news dispatches for the first time since the
city fell.
Several of the 550 foreign evacuees arriving in Thailand
from Phnom Penh described the Cambodian capital as a
"dead city," littered with decomposing bodies and
abandoned household goods.
They said the city was populated only by stray pets
and Khmer Rouge soldiers. Earlier evacuees, in accounts
released yesterday, told mixed tales of killings and
kindness from the Khmer Rouge.
The new evacuees said an unknown number of
Westerners, including two Americans, were still believed
to be inside Cambodia.
House To Aet On Refugee Aid
WASHINGTON — President Ford's emergency aid
request for Indochina refugees was cleared for House
action next week by one committee last night and cut to
$405 million by another congressional panel.
The House foreign operations appropriations
subcommittee trimmed the President's $507 million aid
request for 150,000 refugees down to $405 million,

generally basing its action on figures showing the actual
number of refugees involved now totals about 114,000.
Gun Linked To Foster Murder
SACRAMENTO — Bullets and shell casings from a gun
seized in the arrest of Joseph Remiro and Russell Little
were linked yesterday by a criminologist to the
assassination of Marcus Foster.
John Davis, an Oakland police criminologist, testified
that a .380-caliber Walther pistol taken from Remiro fired
bullets both in the Nov. 6, 1973 murder of Foster and in
the shootout with Concord police Jan. 10, 1974.
Symbionese Liberation Army members Remiro, 28,
and Little, 25, are on trial for murder in the death of
Foster, a nationally known black educator who was
superintendent of scnools in Oakland.
Brown To Ask For Drilling Delay
LOS ANGELES — California will take the federal
government to court unless a federal plan to lease
Southern California offshore land to oil companies is
delayed, a spokesman for Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said
yesterday.
Brown will ask Interior Secretary Rogers Morton for
the delay in the next week, said Anthony Kline, the
governor's legal affairs secretary.
Brezhnev Seeks Improved Detente
MOSCOW — Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev
expressed hope yesterday the end of war in Vietnam will
bring better U.S.-Soviet relations. He sent a cordial
message to President Ford to mark the 30th anniversary
of V-E Day.
Brezhnev's letter to Ford, published by the official
Soviet news agency Tass, said "substantial positive
changes have been achieved in Soviet-American relations
as a result of efforts made by our countries."
"The elimination of the hotbed of war in Indochina
creates the conditions for a further improvement of the
international atmosphere," Brezhnev said.
Brezhnev's conciliatory comments, the first about
Vietnam by a major Soviet leader, were one more sign
that the Soviets were taking a cautious approach to the
communist victory in the south for the sake of
maintaining Soviet-American detente.
Wholesale Prices Go Back Up
WASHINGTON — Soaring farm prices drove the
wholesale price index up 1.5 percent in April, reversing a
four-month decline and signaling higher grocery bills, the
government said yesterday.
As the Labor Department reported the wholesale price
rise, the Agriculture Department forecast a six to eight
percent rise in retail food prices this year.

SACRAMENTO — The California Legislature approved
a sex bill of rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals, but
a bill easing marijuana penalties stalled two steps away
from passage yesterday.
The assembly narrowly approved the sex bill — despite
heavy lobbying from church groups — but refused by
three votes to approve a bill sharply reducing penalties for
possession of small amounts of pot.
Democratic Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. has commented
positively on both bills and is expected to sign both if
they reach his desk. Marijuana bill sponsors said they
would try again later to get the bill approved.
Passage of the so-called "consenting adults" bill was
hailed by its author, Democratic Assemblyman Willie
Brown of San Francisco, as a step toward granting
"personal, individual freedoms."
The sex bill tosses out numerous sections of the state's
100-year-old sex laws and legalizes sex acts in private
between consenting adults of the same or opposite sex. It
won in a 45-26 vote.
Sen. George Moscone, a Democratic candidate for
mayor of San Francisco, sponsored the marijuana bill. It
sets a fine similar to a parking ticket for possession of
small amounts of marijuana.
"People voted for their own interest in political
self-preservation rather than for the bill on its merits,"
Moscone said angrily after the measure went down to
defeat.
Vietnam Reopens Communieations
BANGKOK — South Vietnam began to reestablish
contact with the rest of the world yesterday while
neighboring Cambodia, declaring its determination to go it
alone, sent out most of the remaining known foreign
refugees from its borders.
In Saigon, the government held its first news
conference since the South Vietnamese capital fell April
30.
On Wednesday the government permitted newsmen
begin filing news dispatches for the first time since the
city fell.
Several of the 550 foreign evacuees arriving in Thailand
from Phnom Penh described the Cambodian capital as a
"dead city," littered with decomposing bodies and
abandoned household goods.
They said the city was populated only by stray pets
and Khmer Rouge soldiers. Earlier evacuees, in accounts
released yesterday, told mixed tales of killings and
kindness from the Khmer Rouge.
The new evacuees said an unknown number of
Westerners, including two Americans, were still believed
to be inside Cambodia.
House To Aet On Refugee Aid
WASHINGTON — President Ford's emergency aid
request for Indochina refugees was cleared for House
action next week by one committee last night and cut to
$405 million by another congressional panel.
The House foreign operations appropriations
subcommittee trimmed the President's $507 million aid
request for 150,000 refugees down to $405 million,

generally basing its action on figures showing the actual
number of refugees involved now totals about 114,000.
Gun Linked To Foster Murder
SACRAMENTO — Bullets and shell casings from a gun
seized in the arrest of Joseph Remiro and Russell Little
were linked yesterday by a criminologist to the
assassination of Marcus Foster.
John Davis, an Oakland police criminologist, testified
that a .380-caliber Walther pistol taken from Remiro fired
bullets both in the Nov. 6, 1973 murder of Foster and in
the shootout with Concord police Jan. 10, 1974.
Symbionese Liberation Army members Remiro, 28,
and Little, 25, are on trial for murder in the death of
Foster, a nationally known black educator who was
superintendent of scnools in Oakland.
Brown To Ask For Drilling Delay
LOS ANGELES — California will take the federal
government to court unless a federal plan to lease
Southern California offshore land to oil companies is
delayed, a spokesman for Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said
yesterday.
Brown will ask Interior Secretary Rogers Morton for
the delay in the next week, said Anthony Kline, the
governor's legal affairs secretary.
Brezhnev Seeks Improved Detente
MOSCOW — Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev
expressed hope yesterday the end of war in Vietnam will
bring better U.S.-Soviet relations. He sent a cordial
message to President Ford to mark the 30th anniversary
of V-E Day.
Brezhnev's letter to Ford, published by the official
Soviet news agency Tass, said "substantial positive
changes have been achieved in Soviet-American relations
as a result of efforts made by our countries."
"The elimination of the hotbed of war in Indochina
creates the conditions for a further improvement of the
international atmosphere," Brezhnev said.
Brezhnev's conciliatory comments, the first about
Vietnam by a major Soviet leader, were one more sign
that the Soviets were taking a cautious approach to the
communist victory in the south for the sake of
maintaining Soviet-American detente.
Wholesale Prices Go Back Up
WASHINGTON — Soaring farm prices drove the
wholesale price index up 1.5 percent in April, reversing a
four-month decline and signaling higher grocery bills, the
government said yesterday.
As the Labor Department reported the wholesale price
rise, the Agriculture Department forecast a six to eight
percent rise in retail food prices this year.
