## SLE Challenges Profs, Students 
### JON BIGELOW 
Stanford's Structured Liberal
Education (SLE) program, now in its
second year, has proved as much a
challenge to the faculty members
involved as it has to its students.
Heated debates between professors
in different disciplines, for example,
often explode during class. These
sometimes reach such proportions,
according to Assoc. History Prof. Mark
Mancall, director of the program, that
the discussion comes to a standstill.
"We still haven't perfected team
teaching," says Mancall of the
program, which involves 28 freshmen
from Arroyo and Cedro Houses in
Wilbur. The reason, Mancall is quick to
point out, is that SLE tries to integrate
all the major disciplines (natural
science, social science and the
humanities), and scholars from such
diverse fields have trouble working
together.
But students remain enthusiastic.
"The basic concept is excellent," says
Cedro SLE student Nick Kouletsis.
"The main advantage of this approach
is that it gives you really interesting
perspectives on philosophy," he adds.
The program tackles one time
period per quarter. Autumn quarter
dwelt on the ancient world. During
that time, through seminars, lectures
and small tutorial groups, the students
looked at the significant developments
in philosophy, social organization and
science in the period.
Scientific Difficulty
But it is difficult to present
scientific material at a level which
satisfies both those well versed in
natural science and those who are not,
many students observe.
The schedule also has presented
difficulties. The course is very
intensive (nine units per quarter are
offered), and many students find that
they have little time to pursue other
courses. "This is especially a problem
for pre-meds," says Mancall.
The intensive nature of the program
is one reason for an enrollment which
has dwindled from 50 to 28 since
autumn term. Nancy Kirkner, an
Arroyo freshman, cites the commonly
mentioned problems, but says that the
grading system discouraged her also.
Grading Informal
Grading is very informal, with the
several papers each quarter given no
letter grades, but close personal
attention by tutors and faculty
members. Kirkner and others feel the
deemphasis on letter grades was a step
toward providing less feedback rather
than toward progressive education.
Some have also complained that a
great deal of reading is required.
Mancall admits that "the syllabus
sometimes runs away from us," but

added that the faculty have been
paring down from former amounts.
Despite the bugs, the advantages
have made the program worthwhile in
the minds of those who have stuck
with it. Close interaction with the
faculty members involved attracts
many students. Katie Solomonson
from Cedro says that although the
students "feel kind of like guinea
pigs," the faculty are "always
around."
Valid Part
Mancall says that "the valid part of
the program is intensive teaching."
There are 10 faculty members in the
program, providing a student-faculty
ratio of three to one.
Other strong points of the program
are pointed out by students. Kouletsis
says that SLE "teaches you to read

things on your own." And
Solomonson says that the "personal
attention given to your work has really
taught me how to write well."
The program was originally planned
to accommodate 150 students within
two or three years. Mancall notes that
"with the budget crunch, we just can't
expand." SLE received a $181,000
grant from the Carnegie Foundation
last year, which Mancall says is just
keeping the program going at its
present level.
'Constantly Changing'
Mancall stresses that "the program
is constantly changing. When it
becomes set and rigid it's time to
abandon it... we don't want to be
ossified. It's healthy to be always
