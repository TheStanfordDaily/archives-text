# Court Gives $8.5 Million To Endowment Fund
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
An $8.5 million bequest was
awarded the University yesterday by
the Fresno County Superior Court.
The money was bequethed to the
University by George Capron, a Fresno
real estate developer who died at age
86 on Oct 26, 1972.
Although the details of Capron's
estate were settled only yesterday, the
University has long been aware of the
gift and had already included it in its
long-term financial plans, according to
Bob Beyers, director of University
News and Publications.
"While the University hadn't
anticipated the exact amount of the
estate, this was not a bolt out of the
blue," Beyers said.
The entire amount will be placed in
the University's endowment, Beyers
said.
Restricted
Under the terms of Capron's will,
most of the funds donated to the
University will be restricted to the
endowment, which totaled about $350
million before the gift.
Some $2 million of the gift will be
held in trust by the University for
Capron's brother Ralph of Los Angeles
and his children, and a niece, June Pais
of Booneville, Ark.
The income from the $2 million
trust will be received by Capron's heirs
until their deaths, at which time it will
become the University's. The
University is free to use income
generated by the remaining $6.5
million however it chooses.
Reduced By Taxes
The $2 million will be reduced
somewhat by taxes, Beyers noted, but
the remainder is not subject to
taxation.
Capron's total estate was valued at
$12.5 million. Its size was reduced to

$8.5 million by taxes and various
other claims against it.
The gift is the third largest ever
received from an individual by the
University, General Secretary Daryl
Pearson noted.
Anonymous Gift
An anonymous individual
contributed $15 million in 1971 and a
number of corporations have
contributed larger sums, Pearson said.
And President Richard Lyman noted
last night that Leland Stanford's
original bequest was also larger. It
amounted to $24 million, which
would be far greater under current
prices, Lyman added.
"It is welcome news that this
matter has finally been settled by the
court," Lyman said.
Lyman emphasized that since the
money "has been part of our financial
forecasts for some time," the
settlement of the matter in court will

not alter the University's financial
situation.
Campaign
According to Pearson, the money
will be included in the University's
five-year $300 million Campaign For
Stanford fund raising drive if it is
received before the end of the
campaign in April 1977.
Pearson said Capron had been a
"friend of the University for many
years" and notified the University of
his plans for the bequest long before
his death.
Capron, who made his fortune in
California real estate, worked as a
coach at Long Beach High School after
a stint as a professional baseball player
early in the century.
He first became interested in the
University after visiting it while
playing baseball.
