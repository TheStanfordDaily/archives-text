# Bankruptcies Up On Student Loans

### WILLIAM ROSS 
Bankruptcies by holders of
Stanford student loans have increased
50 percent during the last academic
year, according to Joseph Jedd,
manager of student accounting.
Some 47,261 in student debts were
erased by bankruptcy declarations
during 1973-74, compared to the
$31,875 that was last in 1972-73.
"This is a disturbing increase," Jedd
said. "The problem of bankruptcies is
worse than ever before and we expect
the money lost during the current year
to be much larger than before."
Jedd attributed the increase to
what he termed "changing morals"
rather than to the economic recession.
He claimed that bankruptcy no longer
involves the social stigma that it once
did.
Observing that the increase in
bankruptcy on student loans is a
nationwide phenomenon, Jedd
expressed fear that the problem might
encourage the government to reduce
funding for loans.
Jedd noted that $22,687 of the
$47,261 lost to bankruptcies last year
came from government loans
administered by the University.
'Terribly Vital'
"It may become popular for
legislators to vote against money for
students," Jedd said. "This would be
bad because loans are terribly vital to
many students."
Jedd added that if the public learns
of the trend and pressures legislators
to restrict funding, educational
institutions might also suffer from
decreased funding on loans because

they would have to assume a larger
share of the burden of providing
student loans.
Jedd claimed that legislation
limiting the ability of student loan
holders to declare bankruptcy might
help solve the problem of the rising
bankruptcy rate.
Deterrence
A bill, HR3I, currently under
consideration by the House Judiciary
Committee's subcommittee on civil
and constitutional rights, would deter
former students from declaring
bankruptcy on educational loans
during the first five years following
their graduation.
Jedd expressed approval of the bill,
claiming that if it passed, "former
students would not be able to hide
behind bankruptcy laws to escape
their obligations."
Robert Freelen, the University's
director of government relations, said
the bill is part of a much more
extensive bankruptcy revision law that
"is slogging through Congress."
Schools Approve
Freelen said that Stanford and
many other universities have notified
Congress of their approval of the bill's
intention.
"We support some mechanism by
which to prevent people from
perverting the intention of student
loans," Freelen said.
Alan Parker, counsel for the
subcommittee studying the bill, told
the Daily that no hearing will occur on
it for several months.
Although Parker emphasized that
