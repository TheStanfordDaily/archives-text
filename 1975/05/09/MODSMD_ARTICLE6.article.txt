# Bankruptcies Up On Student Loans
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Bankruptcies by holders of
Stanford student loans have increased
50 percent during the last academic
year, according to Joseph Jedd,
manager of student accounting.
Some 47,261 in student debts were
erased by bankruptcy declarations
during 1973-74, compared to the
$31,875 that was last in 1972-73.
"This is a disturbing increase," Jedd
said. "The problem of bankruptcies is
worse than ever before and we expect
the money lost during the current year
to be much larger than before."
Jedd attributed the increase to
what he termed "changing morals"
rather than to the economic recession.
He claimed that bankruptcy no longer
involves the social stigma that it once
did.
Observing that the increase in
bankruptcy on student loans is a
nationwide phenomenon, Jedd
expressed fear that the problem might
encourage the government to reduce
funding for loans.
Jedd noted that $22,687 of the
$47,261 lost to bankruptcies last year
came from government loans
administered by the University.
'Terribly Vital'
"It may become popular for
legislators to vote against money for
students," Jedd said. "This would be
bad because loans are terribly vital to
many students."
Jedd added that if the public learns
of the trend and pressures legislators
to restrict funding, educational
institutions might also suffer from
decreased funding on loans because

they would have to assume a larger
share of the burden of providing
student loans.
Jedd claimed that legislation
limiting the ability of student loan
holders to declare bankruptcy might
help solve the problem of the rising
bankruptcy rate.
Deterrence
A bill, HR3I, currently under
consideration by the House Judiciary
Committee's subcommittee on civil
and constitutional rights, would deter
former students from declaring
bankruptcy on educational loans
during the first five years following
their graduation.
Jedd expressed approval of the bill,
claiming that if it passed, "former
students would not be able to hide
behind bankruptcy laws to escape
their obligations."
Robert Freelen, the University's
director of government relations, said
the bill is part of a much more
extensive bankruptcy revision law that
"is slogging through Congress."
Schools Approve
Freelen said that Stanford and
many other universities have notified
Congress of their approval of the bill's
intention.
"We support some mechanism by
which to prevent people from
perverting the intention of student
loans," Freelen said.
Alan Parker, counsel for the
subcommittee studying the bill, told
the Daily that no hearing will occur on
it for several months.
Although Parker emphasized that
he could not predict whether or not
the student loan clause would be
successful, he said that the provision
has encountered some opposition from
the legal profession.
According to Parker, the National
Bankruptcy Conference, at its annual
meeting in Chicago last month,
expressed reservations about the
student loan clause.
"Their feeling is that educational
debts should not be different from any
other debts," Parker said.
His impression is that the
Conference might announce its
opposition to the measure.
Five-Year Period
Under the bill's provisions, all
bankruptcy cases involving student
loans would be individually considered
by judges after the expiration of the
five-year period, Parker said. If the
loan's holder could prove hardship, the
judge would have the power to
discharge the loan, he added. In the
meantime, however, the loan recipient
would be held liable for his debt.
"This is a middle of the road
position between not allowing student
loans to be discharged at all and
retaining the existing laws that treat

them like any other obligation," Parker
said.
Despite the growth in bankruptcies
on student loans. Jedd said that
delinquencies on loans are in a steady
state.
Jedd noted that former students
who declare bankruptcy virtually
never repay their loans from the
University.
"Some believe at the time they
declare bankruptcy that they will
eventually pay back the University,
but they don't do so," Jedd said.
"When I came to Stanford 15 years
ago, I was told to tread lightly on the
collection of student loans because the
people with outstanding accounts were
potential donors," Jedd added. "But I
once did a survey and found out that
people who allow their loans to
become severely delinquent donate
practically nothing to the University.
"People who like money so much
that they don't want to discharge their
debts don't want to donate anything
to the University, either."
Jedd said he was shocked by the
apparent lack of guilt displayed by
people who declare bankruptcy and
have no intention of repaying the
University.

delinquencies on loans are in a steady
state.
Jedd noted that former students
who declare bankruptcy virtually
never repay their loans from the
University.
"Some believe at the time they
declare bankruptcy that they will
eventually pay back the University,
but they don't do so," Jedd said.
"When I came to Stanford 15 years
ago, I was told to tread lightly on the
collection of student loans because the
people with outstanding accounts were
potential donors," Jedd added. "But I
once did a survey and found out that
people who allow their loans to
become severely delinquent donate
practically nothing to the University.
"People who like money so much
that they don't want to discharge their
debts don't want to donate anything
to the University, either."
Jedd said he was shocked by the
apparent lack of guilt displayed by
people who declare bankruptcy and
have no intention of repaying the
University.
Bankruptcies by holders of
Stanford student loans have increased
50 percent during the last academic
year, according to Joseph Jedd,
manager of student accounting.
Some 47,261 in student debts were
erased by bankruptcy declarations
during 1973-74, compared to the
$31,875 that was last in 1972-73.
"This is a disturbing increase," Jedd
said. "The problem of bankruptcies is
worse than ever before and we expect
the money lost during the current year
to be much larger than before."
Jedd attributed the increase to
what he termed "changing morals"
rather than to the economic recession.
He claimed that bankruptcy no longer
involves the social stigma that it once
did.
Observing that the increase in
bankruptcy on student loans is a
nationwide phenomenon, Jedd
expressed fear that the problem might
encourage the government to reduce
funding for loans.
Jedd noted that $22,687 of the
$47,261 lost to bankruptcies last year
came from government loans
administered by the University.
'Terribly Vital'
"It may become popular for
legislators to vote against money for
students," Jedd said. "This would be
bad because loans are terribly vital to
many students."
Jedd added that if the public learns
of the trend and pressures legislators
to restrict funding, educational
institutions might also suffer from
decreased funding on loans because

they would have to assume a larger
share of the burden of providing
student loans.
Jedd claimed that legislation
limiting the ability of student loan
holders to declare bankruptcy might
help solve the problem of the rising
bankruptcy rate.
Deterrence
A bill, HR3I, currently under
consideration by the House Judiciary
Committee's subcommittee on civil
and constitutional rights, would deter
former students from declaring
bankruptcy on educational loans
during the first five years following
their graduation.
Jedd expressed approval of the bill,
claiming that if it passed, "former
students would not be able to hide
behind bankruptcy laws to escape
their obligations."
Robert Freelen, the University's
director of government relations, said
the bill is part of a much more
extensive bankruptcy revision law that
"is slogging through Congress."
Schools Approve
Freelen said that Stanford and
many other universities have notified
Congress of their approval of the bill's
intention.
"We support some mechanism by
which to prevent people from
perverting the intention of student
loans," Freelen said.
Alan Parker, counsel for the
subcommittee studying the bill, told
the Daily that no hearing will occur on
it for several months.
Although Parker emphasized that
he could not predict whether or not
the student loan clause would be
successful, he said that the provision
has encountered some opposition from
the legal profession.
According to Parker, the National
Bankruptcy Conference, at its annual
meeting in Chicago last month,
expressed reservations about the
student loan clause.
"Their feeling is that educational
debts should not be different from any
other debts," Parker said.
His impression is that the
Conference might announce its
opposition to the measure.
Five-Year Period
Under the bill's provisions, all
bankruptcy cases involving student
loans would be individually considered
by judges after the expiration of the
five-year period, Parker said. If the
loan's holder could prove hardship, the
judge would have the power to
discharge the loan, he added. In the
meantime, however, the loan recipient
would be held liable for his debt.
"This is a middle of the road
position between not allowing student
loans to be discharged at all and
retaining the existing laws that treat

them like any other obligation," Parker
said.

Bankruptcy Conference, at its annual
meeting in Chicago last month,
expressed reservations about the
student loan clause.
"Their feeling is that educational
debts should not be different from any
other debts," Parker said.
His impression is that the
Conference might announce its
opposition to the measure.
Five-Year Period
Under the bill's provisions, all
bankruptcy cases involving student
loans would be individually considered
by judges after the expiration of the
five-year period, Parker said. If the
loan's holder could prove hardship, the
judge would have the power to
discharge the loan, he added. In the
meantime, however, the loan recipient
would be held liable for his debt.
"This is a middle of the road
position between not allowing student
loans to be discharged at all and
retaining the existing laws that treat

them like any other obligation," Parker
said.
Despite the growth in bankruptcies
on student loans. Jedd said that
delinquencies on loans are in a steady
state.
Jedd noted that former students
who declare bankruptcy virtually
never repay their loans from the
University.
"Some believe at the time they
declare bankruptcy that they will
eventually pay back the University,
but they don't do so," Jedd said.
"When I came to Stanford 15 years
ago, I was told to tread lightly on the
collection of student loans because the
people with outstanding accounts were
potential donors," Jedd added. "But I
once did a survey and found out that
people who allow their loans to
become severely delinquent donate
practically nothing to the University.
"People who like money so much
that they don't want to discharge their
debts don't want to donate anything
to the University, either."
Jedd said he was shocked by the
apparent lack of guilt displayed by
people who declare bankruptcy and
have no intention of repaying the
University.
