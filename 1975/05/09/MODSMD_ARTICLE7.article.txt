# Fire Permit Regulation Waived
## Carnival To Open As Scheduled 
### 
The second annual spring
carnival will open on schedule at 4
p.m. today.
Santa Clara County supervisors
voted unanimously yesterday to
exempt the University from a fire
permit regulation which had
threatened to prevent the carnival
from opening.
A fire marshal had informed the
event's organizers earlier this week
that they need such a permit, but
carnival officials responded that
they could not obtain it by today.
Andrew Doty, community
relations director for the
University, said the vote reflected
the supervisors' belief that the
University has "a responsible
record" and can regulate itself.
Doty noted that Supervisor
Geraldine Steinberg had been
largely responsible for the Board's
decision. "She deserves a great deal
of credit." he said.
The carnival will run through
Sunday. All net revenue from
concessions and 15 percent of the
income from ticket sales will go to
the Wunderman Water Storage
Systems project in Mali, one of six
African nations most affected by
the current drought, according to
organizer Charles Ogletree.
One of the concessions will bo a
dunking booth at which, for 25
cents, a person will have three
chances to dunk, among others,
