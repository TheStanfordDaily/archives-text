## African Relief 
### 
Few Stanford groups have worked as diligently toward
a humanitarian goal as has the African Famine Relief
Committee, and the committee members'.efforts to raise
money to aid famine victims have been highly successful.
We hope that the committee's Stanford Carnival, which
begins today, will also gain the support of the Stanford
community.
All of the funds from the carnival's sideshows and 15
percent of the proceeds from the rides will go toward
providing long-term drought relief for Africa's stricken
Sahel region. Although the severe drought conditions of a
year ago have been eased somewhat by recent rainfall,
funds are still urgently needed so that water-storage
facilities and dams can be built. Thus in the future the
region could be spared devastating famines like the one
caused by the recent lack of rainfall.
Students can contribute to the committee's
fund-raising efforts in several ways: by supporting its
programs (such as the carnival and the planned
"non-dinner" on May 27), by volunteering to help raise
funds or by giving money directly to the committee.
Students concerned with the problems of the Sahel — and
we hope all students will study the committee's
statements on the seriousness of the problems — should
consider aiding the African Famine Relief Committee.
