# On Theme House
## 
### 
Being one of the statistics —
one of those people expressing
interest in joining the
Stanford-In-Stanford theme
house program and ultimately
being assigned to it in the test
run of the draw, referred to in
the May 7 Daily editorial
entitled "Plan Disarmed"—l was,
once again, disappointed in the
inaccuracy the Daily exhibited
in presenting the "facts."
It was stated that "even if all
persons who expressed interest
in joining the program had been
admitted, there still would have
been 13 empty spaces." This is a
gross factual error.
The International Relations
and Arms Control program was
assigned 49 spaces to fill the
ZAP House and, in fact, 53
persons submitted priority cards.
If all 53 persons would have
been placed, certainly a 49-space
house would have been filled.
It is true, however, that only
38 persons were placed in the
allotted house during round one
of the draw, although it is likely
that more would have been
placed in round two.
It was because of this that a
switch was considered to the
39-space Guthrie House, where
there would have been little
difficulty filling the house.
Hard Work Invested
More damaging than the
above error was the claim made
in the editorial that "this entire
snafu could have been avoided if
the students who authored the
project had better surveyed the
student body to determine
interest in the program." Both
Mike Herman and Tom Glenn
put an incredible amount of
work into this program.
Early in the year (Jan. 28 and
29), two open meetings were
held for the expressed purpose
of "determining student
interest."
Contrary to the implications
in the Daiiy, the University was
informed, and participated in, all
decisions made concerning
implementation of
Stanford-In-Stanford. On the
basis of the number of students
present at the open meetings it
was decided jointly by Herman,
Glenn, Director John Barton,
Co-ordinator Lawrence Weiler,
and Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton, that there
wds sufficient interest for the
University to proceed to

Carole Houck

implement and support the
Stanford-In-Stanford program.
Granted interest was not
overwhelming, it was still
sufficient enough to secure the
filling of a relatively small house
(for which the program was
originally designed to insure
maximum efficiency).
My only question at this
point is: given the knowledge
that interest was minimally
sufficient, why did Larry Horton
choose to place Stan
ford-In-Stanford in the larger of
the two houses , ZAP and
Guthrie, designated for the new
theme houses?
Ross Was Right
I believe that William Ross's
statement in his May 6 column
entitled "Horton Shuns Simple
Solution" should be emphasized.
"While | Asst. French Prof.
David | Brostoff is probably
correct in assuming that Guthrie
would suit the French theme
house better than would ZAP,
this hardly seems a justification
for allowing the Stan
ford-In-Stanford program to be
dropped," Ross wrote.
I would like to commend
Ross on his column, for while I
feel a residential study program
is not "stultifying," I agree with
Ross that "by a simple
compromise, the University
could have relocated the
Stanford-In-Stanford House in
Guthrie and reassigned the
French theme house to ZAP. A
total of 48 students would have
benefitted from the change.
Lack Of Commitment
It seems to me that 53
students was sufficient, interest
for initiation of Stan
ford-In-Stanford. 1 was
disappointed by Horton's lack of
genuine commitment to stand
behind a proposal he agreed to
back and provide for the
students.
I resent the Daily's insistence
on incorrectly condemning the
work of the authors of
Stanford-In-Stanford.
It is too bad that in the early
stages of the proposal the Daily
elected to give such negative
coverage to a program with so
many positive aspects.
I am pleased that the authors
continue to support the
Stanford-In-Stanford program
and it is my hope that those
students concerned with its
future will express their support.
