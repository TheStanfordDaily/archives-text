# Franklin Promotes New Book
## 
### RON ELVING 
Former Assoc. English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin, fired from his tenured
faculty post in 1971 for "urging and
inciting" students to disrupt
University operations, is back in town.
Touring to promote his recently
published "political autobiography"
(Back Where You Came From: One
Life in the Death of the Empire),
Franklin gave a reading from the book
and discussed his present activities
yesterday afternoon at Kepler's
Bookstore in Menlo Park.
Approximately 50 persons attended.
The 41-year old Melville scholar
and avowed Maoist read a chapter
entitled "Peace Is Our Profession," an
account of some of his experience
while serving with the Strategic Air
Command (SAC) as a navigator and
intelligence officer from 1956 to
1959.
Franklin's portrait of the U.S. Air
Force combined a humorous view of
military bureaucracy with an overlay
of commentary on the role of the
military in American global strategy.
The chapter focused repeatedly on
SAC's attempts to overvalue itself in
the eyes of the tax-paying public.
Lenny Bruce Humor
After the reading, the author was
complimented by a middle-aged
women in the audience on having kept
his "Lenny Bruce sense of humor."
Franklin replied that there were
good reasons for "one to be in a good
humor," citing in particular the
"liberation of Ho Chi Minh City." He
referred to the deposed Saigon regime
of President Thieu as "hired killers and
professional sadists."
Asked about the suit being brought
against Stanford by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) on his behalf,
