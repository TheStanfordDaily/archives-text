# Franklin Promotes New Book
## 
### RON ELVING 
Former Assoc. English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin, fired from his tenured
faculty post in 1971 for "urging and
inciting" students to disrupt
University operations, is back in town.
Touring to promote his recently
published "political autobiography"
(Back Where You Came From: One
Life in the Death of the Empire),
Franklin gave a reading from the book
and discussed his present activities
yesterday afternoon at Kepler's
Bookstore in Menlo Park.
Approximately 50 persons attended.
The 41-year old Melville scholar
and avowed Maoist read a chapter
entitled "Peace Is Our Profession," an
account of some of his experience
while serving with the Strategic Air
Command (SAC) as a navigator and
intelligence officer from 1956 to
1959.
Franklin's portrait of the U.S. Air
Force combined a humorous view of
military bureaucracy with an overlay
of commentary on the role of the
military in American global strategy.
The chapter focused repeatedly on
SAC's attempts to overvalue itself in
the eyes of the tax-paying public.
Lenny Bruce Humor
After the reading, the author was
complimented by a middle-aged
women in the audience on having kept
his "Lenny Bruce sense of humor."
Franklin replied that there were
good reasons for "one to be in a good
humor," citing in particular the
"liberation of Ho Chi Minh City." He
referred to the deposed Saigon regime
of President Thieu as "hired killers and
professional sadists."
Asked about the suit being brought
against Stanford by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) on his behalf,
Franklin said he expects the case to
make headway in the near future.
Private vs. Public
"We're still basically fighting over
the issue of whether or not Stanford
can call itself private while it receives
support from public funds," Franklin
said. The administration has argued its
right to hire and fire employees as a
private institution.
Franklin emphasized that the case
is ultimately based on his
Constitutional right to free speech,
"Whether or not Stanford is private,
the First Amendment still applies."
Franklin reported that a similar
ACLU suit against the Board of
Regents of the University of Colorado
was making more progress. The Board
overturned the Colorado English
Department's decision to hire
Franklin.
"We're trying to document FBI
involvement in the Colorado case, as
well as in the Stanford decision,"
Franklin said.
Franklin said that commitments in
San Francisco would prevent him from
attending the rally planned for
tomorrow afternoon. Rallyers will
protest changes in University policy on

financial aid for minority students and
the Communications Department's
contract with the Iranian government.
Stays Cool
"Anyway," Franklin added with a
smile, "I wouldn't want to urge or
incite anybody."
Franklin noted recent
demonstrations against such changes in
minority programs on a number of
campuses. He called the new minority
policies "a conscious attempt to cut
down on the participation of Third
World peoples in the universities."
Franklin said he had talked to
friends on the Stanford faculty and
found them "very depressed" by the
trend in administration decisions. He
said he had noticed University
spokesmen becoming "arrogant and
blatant in their statements about what
the University stands for."
Franklin asserted that Stanford is
acquiring an "infamous reputation"
for its "intensive screening-out" of
potentially radical students.
Concluding his remarks on
Stanford, he termed the faculty in
humanities and social sciences "very
bad by any criteria." He added that he
didn't know "why any student would
elect to go to Stanford except to

further a career in science, business or
law."
Franklin took a brighter view of his
new job at Rutgers University's
Newark campus. Despite the
opposition of the New Jersey
legislature, Franklin will begin
teaching on a three-year appointment
there in the fall.
"Rutgers-Newark is a commuter
campus in a working class district,"
Franklin stated. "I may have to eat
these words some day, but the
administration there seems sincere in its
desire to serve the needs of the
immediate community," Franklin
added.
Asked whether he had considered
leaving academics, Franklin replied:
"The easy way out would have been to
take another kind of job ... but it
would have been irresponsible to do
so.
"I've trained as a teacher, I like to
teach," Franklin added, "and I want
to be in the university so I can work
toward forcing the university to serve
the people."
Franklin will be in the Bay Area for
the next few days, discussing his book
and his political philosophy on radio
stations KGO, KPFA and KRON.
