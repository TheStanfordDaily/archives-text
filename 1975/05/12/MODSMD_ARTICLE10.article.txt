# Academic Freedom & Iran
## 
### 
It is gratifying to see that the Daily opposes
the Iran contract, but I believe the May 5
editorial only skims the surface of the question of
whether academic freedom assures Professor
Parker's unconditional right to pursue the
contract if he chooses.
It can surely be argued that researchers have
the right to choose subjects of research, however
unpopular. Freedom of inquiry should not be
circumscribed by taboos, whether they are
imposed by trustees or students.
On the other hand, there are legitimate limits
one can set for the regulation of research projects,
particularly those for which the University shares
responsibility, even if — like secret research —
they are "within the law."
One established principle is that the
community has the right to review and approve
projects involving the use of human subjects, both
in the Medical School and in behavioral science
research. A project carrying the risk of assisting a
government to control the thought or behavior of
its citizens — or groups that government might
choose to consider "dissident" — should be very
carefully scrutinized before the University decides
to associate itself with the project. There have
been too many examples of universities
conducting social experiments on the peoples of
Southeast Asia with disastrous effects (especially
in collaboration with government agencies like
Agency for International Development.)
The informed consent of the people used in
the experiment is essential. It has not been
obtained. This project would lead to the
imposition of social changes on a population
whose wishes in the matter have never been
democratically consulted and who become the

unwilling victims of experimentation and
manipulation. Like the Vietnamese in past
projects, the people of Iran have had no say in
Professor Parker's plan to "modernize"
communications in their country with his satellite
system.
It seems incredible that, even after Vietnam,
American scientists can still believe that technical
expertise, not to speak of "academic freedom,"
gives them the right to plan the social and
political development of a foreign population
without their knowledge or consent.
Any right ceases to be absolute when it
infringes on the rights of others. In this case Prof.
Parker's rights collide with the Iranian people's
right to self-determination, to their free choice of
how they will use Western technology, if at all. in
their development.
Professors Parker and Lusignan do, of course,
have the right to express themselves freely in
proposing improvement of conditions in Iran. But
that isn't the question. We are talking about a
contract to which the University itself is a party,
and that involves at least two departments,
including students and facilities. Academic
freedom may prevent the University from
forbidding these professors to undertake their
our research project, however distasteful it may be
to some of us and to Iranians. It does not require
the University to associate itself institutionally
with their work. That constitutes a commitment
above and beyond academic freedom — a
commitment to involvement in another country's
social and political life and to the idea that that
sort of highly polarized political action is an
acceptable function of an American university.
