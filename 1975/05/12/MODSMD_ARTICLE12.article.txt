# PA '75 Platform Misrepresented
## 
### 
Jim Wascher's editorial on the Palo Alto
City Council race in Friday's Daily, in
which he claims to have given a careful
examination of the backgrounds of PA '75
candidates, is grossly biased and full of
factual errors, due no doubt to the fact that
he didn't talk to any of those candidates
nor with any official PA '75 representative.
To set the record straight, all four PA '75
candidates have firmly declared their
opposition to high-rise growth, freeways,
and large industrial developments. PA '75 is
deeply concerned about the financial state
of the city, about the party politics the
majority on the Council practices, including
bloc voting and packing of commissions,
about a poorly conceived and managed drug
program, and about the majority's tendency
to govern by ordinance and moratorium.
Wascher's editorial "proved" Roy Clay
to be a friend of real estate interests because
"his office is at the top of Palo Alto's tallest
building â€” which also happens to house a

leading local real estate firm." This is
responsible deductive logic?!
Scott Carey is described as "counsel and
manager of commercial and industrial sales
and rentals for a major real estate firm."
Actually, his firm has 95 percent of its
business in residential real estate and logic
would argue that no one should be more
concerned about the quality of residential
life than such a firm.
As for Super Block, it was conceived and
planned by a City Council of which Enid
Pearson and Larry Klein's law partner were
members and put out to bid. Scott's firm
scaled down that original concept, and he
requested the Council to put it to the voters
because of its controversial nature.
The most grossly misleading statement of
Wascher's editorial was the comment that
Anne Witherspoon and Fred Eyerly have a
"record of supporting development of the
foothills." They have stated just the
opposite: that they are very concerned that

open space in the foothills which they
support may be jeopardized by the
down-zoning without compensation to
landowners, which has resulted in
$30,000,000 in law suits against the city.
They have both been active for a number of
years working with neighborhood
associations involved in such issues as traffic
reduction, preservation of residential
quality, park improvements, and opposition
to high-density housing projects.
High school debaters may be forgiven for
making up evidence in a moment of zeal,
but I find it hard to condone the editor of a
university paper doing that. One thing that
Wascher and I agree on is that there is a
great deal at stake in Tuesday's election. It
will set the character and direction of Palo
Alto. That topic should be treated more
responsibly than it was in Friday's Daily.
