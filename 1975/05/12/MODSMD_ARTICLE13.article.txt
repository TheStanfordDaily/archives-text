# "Don't Graduate, Dummies!"
## 
### 
You thought I was dead and
gone, didn't you? Demised,
deceased, or at least
permanently deposed from my
Daily perch, right? (They say
that having a newspaper column
is like a license to print-hogwash;
but that's another story.)
Well — you're wrong,
turkeys: I'm sending you this
message from beyond the grave,
as it were, to save you from that
horrible yearly climax of the
body-academic; premature
graduation. (And by premature I
mean anything less than 6
years.) So pull your heads out of
those cereal bowls and read this
column, before you do
something drastic — like
graduate.
Of course, this column is
geared primarily toward
undergrads (the silent majority,
the Stanford 6200), everyone
else having already made the
fatal mistake. My message is
clear: stay in Stanford as long as
you can; you may never again
have as much fun with as little
worry at so small a cost. (So
small a cost? I've only been out
a year and already I'm
outdated.)
What qualifies me to say this?
I left Stanford only to get hit

with a misdemeanor conviction
for assault with a concealed
education (Penal Code 35). And
the penalty was a three year
stretch at the California
Post-graduate Correctional
Facility at U.C. Davis (the
inmates like to call it the State's
Honor Farm).
But I was too undisciplined
for them so I got put in "the
hole": The Davis School of Law
And Other Mumbo Jumbo.
(Followers of my column last
spring might remember the
Bosco J. Embo law school
preparatory course I took. Let
me tell you it didn't help half as
much as the payoffs and
blackmail threats to the
admissions committee up here.
They'll never figure out how I
got that picture of the

committee members in the
steam bath with those iguanas
and all the latex paint . . . but
that's for another story.)
Anyway, law school's no
Easy Street, and neither is
getting your B.A. only to
discover you probably can't even
get a job selling shoes. Or, for
that matter, selling Grit,
America's leading occasional
newspaper.
Remember how your parents
used to say "cherish these years;
they'll be the happiest of your
life." Well, for once in the last
two decades, they're absolutely
right. But I don't say cherish
them; I'm telling you to prolong
them. And you don't need any
messy creames or greasy lotions
to prolong the ecstasy of
academic climax — just slow

down, take some incompletes,
relax and enjoy.
Got 164 units already and
taking 15 now? Change your
major, or become co-terminal.
Cause once you hit the real
world, baby, you may become
really co-terminal.
It's not too late to turn in
your graduation tickets, or at
least change the name on your
diploma to "Chuck U. Farley"
and enlist in a second four-year
tour of duty under your real
name. And don't worry: they're
not going to call out Lt. Don
Tamm and the Santa Clara Tac
Squad to carry vou away.

not going to call out Lt. Don
Tamm and the Santa Clara Tac
Squad to carry vou away.
(Jerry Cole man is a first-year law
student at UC-Davis. His weekly
column "On the Light Side"
used to appear on this page until
we came to our senses.)
You thought I was dead and
gone, didn't you? Demised,
deceased, or at least
permanently deposed from my
Daily perch, right? (They say
that having a newspaper column
is like a license to print-hogwash;
but that's another story.)
Well — you're wrong,
turkeys: I'm sending you this
message from beyond the grave,
as it were, to save you from that
horrible yearly climax of the
body-academic; premature
graduation. (And by premature I
mean anything less than 6
years.) So pull your heads out of
those cereal bowls and read this
column, before you do
something drastic — like
graduate.
Of course, this column is
geared primarily toward
undergrads (the silent majority,
the Stanford 6200), everyone
else having already made the
fatal mistake. My message is
clear: stay in Stanford as long as
you can; you may never again
have as much fun with as little
worry at so small a cost. (So
small a cost? I've only been out
a year and already I'm
outdated.)
What qualifies me to say this?
I left Stanford only to get hit

with a misdemeanor conviction
for assault with a concealed
education (Penal Code 35). And
the penalty was a three year
stretch at the California
Post-graduate Correctional
Facility at U.C. Davis (the
inmates like to call it the State's
Honor Farm).
But I was too undisciplined
for them so I got put in "the
hole": The Davis School of Law
And Other Mumbo Jumbo.
(Followers of my column last
spring might remember the
Bosco J. Embo law school
preparatory course I took. Let
me tell you it didn't help half as
much as the payoffs and
blackmail threats to the
admissions committee up here.
They'll never figure out how I
got that picture of the

committee members in the
steam bath with those iguanas
and all the latex paint . . . but
that's for another story.)
Anyway, law school's no
Easy Street, and neither is
getting your B.A. only to
discover you probably can't even
get a job selling shoes. Or, for
that matter, selling Grit,
America's leading occasional
newspaper.
Remember how your parents
used to say "cherish these years;
they'll be the happiest of your
life." Well, for once in the last
two decades, they're absolutely
right. But I don't say cherish
them; I'm telling you to prolong
them. And you don't need any
messy creames or greasy lotions
to prolong the ecstasy of
academic climax — just slow

down, take some incompletes,
relax and enjoy.
Got 164 units already and
taking 15 now? Change your
major, or become co-terminal.
Cause once you hit the real
world, baby, you may become
really co-terminal.
It's not too late to turn in
your graduation tickets, or at
least change the name on your
diploma to "Chuck U. Farley"
and enlist in a second four-year
tour of duty under your real
name. And don't worry: they're
not going to call out Lt. Don
Tamm and the Santa Clara Tac
Squad to carry vou away.
