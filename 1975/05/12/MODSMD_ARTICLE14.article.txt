Blunderous U.S. policy ir
Indochina has come to an end
but its ramifications will be
many and long-lasting. One such
ramification is the question ol
Vietnamese refugees, who are
currently arriving in the U.S. by
the thousands. It is yet too early
to know their destinations and
destiny.
But so far most of them have
come to various locations on the
West Coast, and it is likely that
West Coast states will be
receiving a great many more of
them when their relocation is
completed.
These men and women upon
arrival will immediately join that
part of the labor force which is
labeled "unemployed," and will
inevitably compete for jobs with
the rest of the unemployed labor
force, which is now pushing up
to 10 percent.
This cannot but remind me of
the hatred and discrimination
against Orientals on the West
Coast before World War 11, in
large part caused by economic
factors. Removal of 100,000
Japanese during World War II
from the West Coast to
concentration camps in flagrant
violation of the U.S.
Constitution was indeed
precipitated by the white man's
economic insecurity of the
Depression era, coupled with his
racist prejudice against Orientals.
Do we not see a parallel
situation now, with a high
unemployment rate and a large
influx of Vietnamese, who will
soon be competing for jobs with
the unemployed on the West
Coast, the hotbed of Oriental
racism? Let us not forget that
many of the men and women
who were glad to see "Japs" sent
off to concentration camps are
still very much alive and among
us.
Governor Brown has already
expressed his concern over the
necessity for California to take
care of so many refugees when
his state is already suffering
from a large scale
unemployment.
We already hear grumblings
from people that refugees are
costing us so much or that we
don't need refugees when we
don't ever have enough jobs for
Americans. Let us also not
forget that these refugees are the
very people whom G.l.'s in
Vietnam contemptously called
"Gooks" only a few days ago,
and treated like dirt during the
war.
Is it too much to foresee a
combination of economic
frustration and latent Oriental
racism to spread among the
populace and be translated into
another "Hate Orientals"
campaign when Vietnamese
refugees are all here and begin to
look for jobs to support
themselves and their families?
This is one time when I as a
social scientist hope that my
prediction will not come true.
