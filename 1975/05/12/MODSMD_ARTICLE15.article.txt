Cinco de Mayo
Editor:
Thank you for your coverage
of Cinco de Mayo.
However, for future
reference, I would like to point
out that the word "ole" is not
Mexican at all, but Spanish. No
Mexican or chicano does or ever
would use "ole" during a fiesta.
Especially since Cinco de Mayo
is a celebration of Mexico's fight
against foreign domination, the
word "ole" is highly
inappropriate.
Thanks again for showing
interest in the Cinco de Mayo
celebration and I hope you
enjoyed the celebrations, the big
one at Manzanita Park on
Sunday and the small one at
Zapata on Monday.

Nuclear Initiative
Editor:
We are standing on the brink
of what has been termed the
"Plutonium Age."
There is still time to decide
whether to push ahead with the
massive deployment of nuclear
power plants including breeder
reactors and plutonium
recycling or to hold back
because the risks are too great.
The debate has stimulated
widely diverse responses ranging
from endorsement of nuclear
power by Nobel Laureates (and
denouncements by others!) to
the statement by the ex-director
of the atomic Energy
Commission's Oak Ridge facility
that we should all share the guilt
of placing us in the nuclear age.
The controversy cannot be
resolved entirely on a technical
level. For example, how does
one evaluate the morality, let

alone the risks, of producing
highly dangerous radioactive
waste products which must be
isolated from the biosphere for
hundreds of thousands of years?
Eminent scientists stand on
both sides of the issue, but often
they agree that the issues should
be debated openly, and the
decisions should not be made in
closed door sessions but subject
to the democratic process. This
is the main thrust of an initiative
proposal by People for Proof
who need signatures to place the
issue in the 1976 statewide
election.
The initiative requires that
the nuclear industry satisfy the
state legislature that proposed
plants are safe, and requires
power companies to assume the
full burden of the financial
responsibility resulting from any
malfunction of a nuclear facility.
At present their liability is
limited by law to far less than
the possible damages from a
nuclear disaster; additionally
most private insurance policies
exclude nuclear disasters.
Signatures of registered voters
are needed.

Viet Stereotypes
Editor:
To most Americans, Vietnam
is a synonym for war, misery,
suffering, and a gamut of
associated human misfortunes.
The country and its people seem
to be distant, alien, and almost
inconsequential.
An awareness of the wealth
of the Vietnamese People's
culture and history is obscured
by a regrettable tendency to
consider only information about
their political ideologies and

statistical data. They are
commonly stereotyped as
"V.C.," "liberators,"
"peasants," or merely "gooks."
Some naively intellectualize
the status of the Vietnamese
who remain in their country.
The Alliance for Radical Change
proclaims victory â€” quite safe in
the sanctuary of their flirtations
with revolutionary polemics.
I am appalled by the obvious
insensitivity to the fate of a
people who entertain the same
aspirations, including
self-determination, dignity, and

human rights, which we do.
Freedom is surely a relative
concept, but freedom under the
totalitarian Revolutionary
Government may best be
defined in the Orwellian sense of
1984.
In honor of the Vietnamese
whom I have known and loved
as my family, I propose that it
would be more appropriate to
offer our compassion in humility
than to rejoice in their
misfortune.
