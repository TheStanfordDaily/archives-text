# Nobody's Favorite Managing Editor

### BETTY GOODWIN 
Glenn Garvin doesn't hate
women.
He says that Raquel Welch is
one of the greatest things to
have happened to the United
States. "There's nothing at all
wrong with Raquel Welch,
Katherine Ross or Carol Doda,"
insists Garvin. "They're
wonderful."
Raquel Welch may belong to
the country, but Glenn Garvin —
for better or for worse — belongs
to the Daily.
He is the paper's young,
sometimes offensive and always
obnoxious managing editor.
He's also the sports columnist
who labeled Billie Jean King a
"menance to the human race."
Says Garvin, in amazement at
the "two million calls" he
received the day after he wrote
the notorious column, "I
thought it was a pretty moderate
position, myself.
"I just think (Sports Editor|
Viae Kershner put a nasty
headline on my column so
people would think / was a nasty
person. Most people think
[Sports Columnists] Kershner
and Robinson are calm, natural
people. In reality, they're
monsters and would trample
over their grandmothers. But
when / say something as
innocent as 'Billie Jean King is a
menace to the human race,'
everyone takes it personally."
But Garvin, nonetheless, has
always had the reputation of
being a hard-assed reporter.
He fondly remembers the
days he spent at a journalism

workshop in New Mexico the
summer before he came to
Stanford. When the Governor of
New Mexico arrived there for a
student press conference, Garvin
says, most of the high school
journalists asked meaty
questions like, "What did you
have for breakfast, Governor'?"
"I became the star
attraction," says Garvin,
"because I asked the Governor
to comment on a recent
popularity poll which said
two-thirds of the people in the
state thought he was an
asshole."
Garvin's reputation stuck
with him.
Thanks to Garvin, who is a
campus stringer for Time, the
Daily was the first paper in the

country to print what state
officials said was the
Symbionese Liberation Army's
"hit list."
For months, Garvin "lived
and breathed" the Patty Hearst
case which he covered for Time.
He says,"The more I did, the
more I found out, and the more
I had to pursue. . . It was the
most dramatic and fascinating
news story I ever worked on."
What does Garvin hope for
his future?
"My fantasy is to track down
Patty Hearst and get her entire
confession on paper and win a
Pulitzer Prize for it ... but
that's the fantasy of every
reporter who ever covered the
Patty Hearst case."

Garvin, however, received the
$1600 Eugene Pulliam
Fellowship at the Indianapolis
Star and News for the summer.
He says, "Maybe if I'm lucky, it
will develop into something, but
I'll probably come back to
Stanford and get a job at
Jack-in-the-Box."
Some people think that he's
not as bad as his columns make
him out to be.
"He's not a male chauvinist,"
says his girfriend, "Bug Me"
Columnist Patty Fels, "but he
likes to be thought of as one. . .
A lot of his attitudes on
women's lib are just to get a rise
out of people. He'll say
something, sit back and watch
people get upset."
However, Garvin honestly
believes that Billie Jean King
represents the "wing of the
women's movement that
horrifies me most. She doesn't
want women to be free to make
a free choice. She wants women
to be 'free' to make a certain
choice — that of having a
career. . . If that's freedom, it's a
pretty warped definition of
freedom."
But don't get Garvin wrong.
He still likes to get a rise out of
people — especially Patty.
"The first present Glenn ever
gave me was a five-foot poster of
Raquel Welch leaning back in
the sand and wearing a bikini.
He told me to hang it by my
mirror and aspire to be as much
like it as possible."
What will become of Garvin?
All Daily staffers wonder. . .
