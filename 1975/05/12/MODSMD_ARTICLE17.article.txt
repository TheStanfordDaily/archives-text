# Movies In The Morning
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
"It's hard to concentrate at
Stanford, because four or five
times a day, they all have to
stand at attention and face the
Southern Pacific tracks as the
commuter blasts through, in
memory of Leland Stanford,
well-known rip-off artist and
land baron" — Andy Moore,
advertising manager at MMM
Carpets, sponsors of Movies Til
Dawn, which run from 1 a.m.
until about 5 a.m. on San Jose's
channel 36, KGSC-TV.
Moore and Gary Ferry
appear at the station breaks of
Movies 'Til Dawn to make witty
comments and otherwise relieve
the boredom of the movies,
which are never of the highest
calibre. Not that their jokes are
any better — a typical example
of their humor is Gary's riddle,
"How many people work at the
phone company?" About 18
percent. Who can take that kind
of humor late at night? Their
audience consists of ...whom?
"Freaks," says Andy. "Anybody
that's a closet out-of--
step-with-society type."
"Actually," responds Gary a
little more seriously, "it's
anyone with nothing to do at
three in the morning" — usually
waitresses, musicians, swing
shifts at factories, insomniacs, or
"little old ladies, young
narcotics addicts, cops and
killers, and elephant rapers."
Both of them are actors at
heart, which explains why they
have been able to cater to this

elite group for two-and-a-half
years. Both have worked as disk
jockeys and worked in the
Saratoga-Los Gatos Community
Theatre for many years, which
they enjoyed until the
carpet-selling game at MMM cut
into their spare hours. The show
was Andy's idea, and they
continue with it because, as
Gary admits, "it's fun to do. It's
pure entertainment. We're not
out to deliver a message."
No Script
As the crew puts the set (that
looks like an eccentric spend
thrift went crazy at a Flea
Market) together, Andy suggests
they light it like Chinatown
—"Maybe we'll win an Academy
Award." Gary moves to the
topic of Francis Ford Coppola,
which in turns inspires Andy to
add, "I hear he was pissed off
because his mother didn't get
one." They bounce off each
other at liberty, letting the jokes
and insults about local
personalities flow as they come
to them. On camera, there is no
script. Their repetoire is full of
in-jokes about the crew members
and the old movies they show.
Gary once referred to Navy
training as watching five William
Bendix movies.
A lot of their banter back and
forth is sexual, making one
wonder how much of it is
actually going to be put out over
the air. Their mail contains its
fair share of pornography and
sexual offers (one,
unfortunately, without a name,

address, or phone number). Gary
said. "We're going to see how
much of this we can get away
with before they close us down"
(does the FCC know about
this?).
Their mail does get rather
unusual, as Gary attests. "We
were doing this show on channel
20 called The Old Sourdough in
which he (Andy) was an old
prospector and I was an old
Indian and we had this little
cabin setting and what-have-you.
And to show you how people's
minds work, we got a letter from
and it said, 'We notice
there are two of you in the cabin
and only one bunk. Is this
alluding to the fact or subtle
hint to those of us 'in the know'
that you are of the gay
persuasion and if so, we're
having a get-together . . . why
don't you come down?' We drive
by Hay ward very quickly."
Sometimes, it just doesn't
flow. "We have to do that
again," says the cameraman.
"Why?" asks Andy. "Maybe it'll
get better," comes the answer.
"Okay, we're out of it," yelled
the cameraman another time,
referring to the tape. "Ycu'ie
telling me," said Gary.
After going down to the
station and being witty three
hours, they go back and reap the
harvest of being celebrities.
They are now stopped on
the streets, which
they love, of course, though it
does get tiring. "You can't get
through a r.ieal no matter where
you go," lamented Andy, "I
went to the Camelian Room on
the top of the Bank of America
building to eat and I figured that
I gotia be safe here because
even oody here is too high-class
to watch the show, right? The
wine steward goes, 'Ah, ah.

you're on ooh-ooh'."
Ordinary People Interviewed
In order to inject variety into
these station breaks, Gary and
Andy invite ordinary people (as
opposed to the celebrities that
Carson and Griffin have) to be
interviewed during their taping
sessions. "We bring normal
people in off the street and
insult the tar off of them," says
Gary. Indeed, he does often
sound like Don Rickles. One
guest, Terry, would toss every
question back as quickly as it
wis asked. She very snottily
rejected such impersonal
questions as "How's your sex
life?" and shot back to Andy,
"How's yours?" Andy said, "It's
fantastic. What can I tell you?",
to which Gary retorted, "That's
right — what can you tell us?".
Terry was rather unusual. It
was hard to tell who was
stranger — the guest or the hosts.
When asked where she was from,
she replied, "I'm from another
planet." "Seriously," said Andy,
"where are you from?" After a
little prodding, she finally
admitted she was from Castro
Valley. "That is another
planet!" observed Andy.
The guests do add a touch of
variety, giving the hosts
something to work with. Mark
was from Fremont, so they
moved onto Fremont jokes with
Andy said, "Now we're going to
get letters from Fremont." "No,
we're not," said Gary "Oh,
that's right — no one can write
in Fremont."
So now you know what
you're missing while you're
studying 'til dawn. Despite
invitations from Hayward and
indignant letters from little, old
ladies, Moore and Ferry will
always be there to turn to.
