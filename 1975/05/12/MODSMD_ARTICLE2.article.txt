# Political Activities Attacked
## Drug Board May Lose Funds 
### RIV WEBER KIM NYEGAARD 
The future funding of the Palo Alto
Community Drug Abuse Board
[PACDAB) is uncertain because of
reaction to its political activities.
Renewal of the PACDAB contract,
which expires June 30, is a major issue
in this week's City Council elections.
The "ABC" council slate generally
disapproves of the political activities
of the staff, but is satisfied with the
drug control and rehabilitation
program.
The "P.A. '75" slate unanimously
called for an end to the political
pronouncements of the Board. They
also questioned whether the drug

advocating support for the Viet Cong
and the co-sponsorship of a
Marxist-Leninist seminar last March.
Councilman Kirke Comstock,
mayor during the start of the program
in 1972, advocates continuation of
funding for PACDAB.
Comstock will present a proposal to
the City Council on May 19, placing
two demands on PACDAB.
First, that the Council should
"issue a directive to the Board to
withdraw the pamphlet Uncle Sam,
the Pusher Man.
Collective Endorsement
This pamphlet was endorsed by the
"Collective," the drug center's staff.
Part of the Booklet reads, "The rulers

Councilman John Bears has
questioned the value of the drug abuse
program.
"I don't think the city should
subsidize political activists," he said.
"I think we have an alcohol and drug
problem. It is here forever. I don't
know if the taxpayers would have to
indulge the selfish individual user."
Program Aims
The drug abuse program aims "to
provide and to operate a
comprehensive program directed
toward the prevention and reduction
or elimination of the various costs and
consequences of drug abuse, both to
the individual citizens and the
community as a whole," according to
the contract between the city and
PACDAB.
But as Collective staff member
Donna Paylor pointed out, "We
seldom get attacked on our day-to-day
work; we get attacked on our
politics."
A John F. Kennedy University
study heralded the program, stating,
"The staff members are dedicated,
energetic and self-motivated people;
85 percent of the counseling
participants in the evaluation study
reported that they had been helped 'a
lot' or 'some' by the Collective."
Political complaints are now being
directed at PACDAB, the Collective,
and its staff. Gary Fazzino, the city
liason to the Collective, said the
operation "has really alienated a lot of
people in Palo Alto.
"The Council philosophy could
change because of the elections," he
said. "People are more fiscally aware;
people are concerned with waste."
"P.A. '75" slate leader Roy Clay
said that the election has given "more
visibility" to PACDAB, but the
publicity has been "mostly negative."
ABC slate member Larry Klein
wants an "iron-clad guarantee of no
political activity by the PACDAB staff
as a staff." Klein stressed that
PACDAB is not indispensable, and the
city can find another contractor.
Klein characterized the Collective's
political activities as "inappropriate"
and "undermining the public
confidence."
"The real problem is the inability
of the board to control the staff [the
Collective] so they won't get involved
in irrelevant political activities," said
Comstock.
Collective Staff Member Ray
Hofstetter defended the relevancy of
the staff's political activiites.
"Drug abuse isn't necessarily the
1 problem of the individual," he said.
1 "It is the result of the social, political,
and economic structure. The
MarxistLeninst seminar presented an
alternative."
