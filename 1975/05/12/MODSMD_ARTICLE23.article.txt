### RON PELLEGRINI 
= It was all Stanford as the 75th annual
|§ California State Tennis Championships
% wound down to the last two days of
§j men's competition. Top-seeded John
s Whitlinger. the Card's No. 1 singles
j| player, met teammate Nick Saviano in
=§ Saturday's featured match, with two
j§ more Stanford netters, .lim Delaney and
s Pat DuPre, doing battle in the other
H semi-final match.
S The results of the matches were no
H surprise, with "Whit" defeating Saviano,
g 6-4, 6-4, and Delaney knocking off DuPre
H in a somewhat closer match, 7-6, 6-3.
jj§ Then in Sunday's finals, Delaney
H ousted Whitlinger. 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, in a rare
|| best three-of-five sets match. The score
H itself tells the story of the match, as only
§§ one service break occurred in each of the

sets, with all three breaks coming at
Whit's expense.
Delaney, who played superbly all week
in defeating (JSC's No. 1 player Butch
Walts and DuPre, employed a big serve
and a deadly net game to discourage the
blond-haired defending NCAA champ.
Whit's game began to resemble his
form of late last year, and he played weii
in the finals. But Delaney never let his
own serve be broken and he came out on
top in the best played match of the
tournament.
The finals of the men's doubles saw
Whitlinger and Delanev pair up to defeat
the team of Terry Stansbury and Todd
Williams, 6-4, 6-4. This match also served
to brighten the Card's Pac-8 title hopes,
for the doubles competition could prove
to be a decisive factor in the battle for

the Pac-8 crown.
Other Stanford netters who competed
in the nine-day tournament were Bill
Maze, who lost to DuPre in the
quarterfinals, Gene Mayer who was
defeated soundly by pro Jim McManus, a
veteran of the WCT circuit, and Craig
Johnson, a loser to Gunn High star Nial
Brash in the qualifying round.
The tourney's results had to be quite
pleasing to Coach Dick Gould as the
Cards displayed a depth that might be
needed to retain the Pac-8 title later this
week.
Tickets are still available for
the Pac-8 tennis championships which
begin here Thursday. The featured
semifinal and final matches will be played
indoors at Maples Pavilion on Friday and
Saturday nights, starting at 6:30.

sets, with all three breaks coming at
Whit's expense.
Delaney, who played superbly all week
in defeating (JSC's No. 1 player Butch
Walts and DuPre, employed a big serve
and a deadly net game to discourage the
blond-haired defending NCAA champ.
Whit's game began to resemble his
form of late last year, and he played weii
in the finals. But Delaney never let his
own serve be broken and he came out on
top in the best played match of the
tournament.
The finals of the men's doubles saw
Whitlinger and Delanev pair up to defeat
the team of Terry Stansbury and Todd
Williams, 6-4, 6-4. This match also served
to brighten the Card's Pac-8 title hopes,
for the doubles competition could prove
to be a decisive factor in the battle for

the Pac-8 crown.
Other Stanford netters who competed
in the nine-day tournament were Bill
Maze, who lost to DuPre in the
quarterfinals, Gene Mayer who was
defeated soundly by pro Jim McManus, a
veteran of the WCT circuit, and Craig
Johnson, a loser to Gunn High star Nial
Brash in the qualifying round.
The tourney's results had to be quite
pleasing to Coach Dick Gould as the
Cards displayed a depth that might be
needed to retain the Pac-8 title later this
week.
Tickets are still available for
the Pac-8 tennis championships which
begin here Thursday. The featured
semifinal and final matches will be played
indoors at Maples Pavilion on Friday and
Saturday nights, starting at 6:30.
