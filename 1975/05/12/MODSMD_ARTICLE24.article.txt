# Women Sweep UCLA Tourney
## 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
The women's tennis team has done it again —
they have swept yet another tournament. This
time the tournament was the UCLA Invitational
and the victory, as usual, was decisive. The Cards
won 26 out of 27 matches against UCLA, USC
and Cal.
In singles competition, Stanford's top five —
Marcy O'Keefe, Lele Forood, Andrea Barnes.
Tracy McNair and Liza Pande — swept their
fifteen matches, and no. 6 Whitney Grant won
two of three. The three Stanford doubles teams
took all nine contests.
Meanwhile, Stanford's second team played in
the 25th annual Modesto Invitational. The Cards
ended in a tie with UC/Davis for the team title,
winning the doubles while Davis took the singles.
Nancy Rudd played no. 1 singles for the Cards
and Joy Hahn and Nancy Anderson were the top

doubles pair in the tournament in which 27
schools participated.
This weekend the netters go to Berkeley for
the NCIAC (Northern California Inter-Collegiate
Athletic Conference) playoffs. Stanford will face
Fresno. Berkeley, and Davis.
Then in mid-June the Cards travel to
Kalamazoo for the Nationals, where, according to
Coach Neal. "We will surely be in the top five."
