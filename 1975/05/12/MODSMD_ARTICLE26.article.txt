# Quarterback Situation Unresolved
## Varsity Gridders Whip Alumni 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Can this really be May?
The weather has only
recently changed for the better.
The Golden State Warriors are
still playing basketball. And fans
once again filed into Stanford
Stadium from among the
eucalyptus trees Saturday to
watch a football game.
The meeting of the 1975
Stanford varsity football team
and an alumni squad including
All-Pro linebacker Jeff Sieinon
of the Minnesota Vikings,
All-Pro offensive guard Blaine
Nye of the Dallas Cowboys, and
quarterback Don Bunce of
Stanford Medical School was as
out of season as strawberries in
December, and the style of play
reflected it.
The varsity's 27-0 victory was
not what you'd call a "gridiron
classic."
A crowd of about 4000 saw
what amounted to a
smorgasbord of sports and sports
figures. The basic objective of
football — that of trying to
move the ball against the
opposition to an end-zone — did
seem to be a recurrent theme,
but the action on the field at
times resembled rugby,
keep-away, and even hot potato.
But if not for such deviations,
usually by the alums, the game
might have been almost as
exciting as watching ice melt.
Quarterback Situation
The game did little to settle
the varsity starting quarterback
situation. Mike Cordova, the
Nolan Ryan of college football,
had the statistical edge over Guy
Benjamin, but neither was
exceptionally sharp. Cordova
completed eight of 16 passes for
135 yards and two touchdowns,
while Benjamin was five of 14
for 40 yards.
"The two quarterbacks have
been just about as even as can
be," head coach Jack
Christiansen said. "They've
become better friends and are
working together well. I think
either is capable of being a
starter and mature enough to be

a good back-up."
Christiansen said he would
name a starter after the first
week of fall practice.
Neither Cordova nor
Benjamin could get much going
in the first half. The alums led
in first downs most of the way
and held the varsity scoreless
until Cordova passed six yards to
Ray Anderson for the only score
of the first half with 2:27
remaining.
The varsity took advantage of
several second-half scoring
opportunities, but the alums
never advanced past the varsity
31 the entire game. At least they
had some fun.
The alums'lack of substantial
practice time and their absence
from the game resulted in quite

a bit of ad-libbing.
"It was really spontaneous,"
said 1972 Rose Bowl star Don
Bunce. "We made up a lot of
plays in the huddle. I never quite
knew who was protecting me or
who was going to go out for the
pass."
The alums included laterals, a
fake punt and sneak, and
sideline-to-sideline runs in their
act. Late in the game they tried
a flea-flicker type play with
Bunce throwing to end Dr. Bill
McColl, father of the varsity's
defensive end Duncan McColl,
who in turn threw an impressive
spiral downfield to nobody in
particular. The ball fell
incomplete a good 20 yards
beyond the nearest alumni
player.

Buncc completed five of 17
passes for 26 yards and shared
the quarterbacking with Dave
Ottmar (1972-73) and Dick
Norman (1958-60). Ex-Stanford
quarterback Mike Boryla, now
with the Philadelphia Eagles,
served as assistant alumni coach
to Doug Single but did not get
into the game.
Tony Hill caught five passes
for 93 yards for the varsity,
while halfback Ron Inge caught
a 32-yard touchdown pass and
halfback Sig Ostrom, recovering
from knee survery, rushed for 34
yards in only four carries.
The alumni game, concluding
four weeks of spring practice for
the 1975 Cards, replaced the
annual Red vs. White intrasquad
game.

Norman (1958-60). Ex-Stanford
quarterback Mike Boryla, now

Tony Hill caught five passes

The Golden State Warriors are
still playing basketball. And fans
once again filed into Stanford
Stadium from among the
eucalyptus trees Saturday to
watch a football game.
The meeting of the 1975
Stanford varsity football team
and an alumni squad including
All-Pro linebacker Jeff Sieinon
of the Minnesota Vikings,
All-Pro offensive guard Blaine
Nye of the Dallas Cowboys, and
quarterback Don Bunce of
Stanford Medical School was as
out of season as strawberries in
December, and the style of play
reflected it.
The varsity's 27-0 victory was
not what you'd call a "gridiron
classic."
A crowd of about 4000 saw
what amounted to a
smorgasbord of sports and sports
figures. The basic objective of
football — that of trying to
move the ball against the
opposition to an end-zone — did
seem to be a recurrent theme,
but the action on the field at
times resembled rugby,
keep-away, and even hot potato.
But if not for such deviations,
usually by the alums, the game
might have been almost as
exciting as watching ice melt.
Quarterback Situation
The game did little to settle
the varsity starting quarterback
situation. Mike Cordova, the
Nolan Ryan of college football,
had the statistical edge over Guy
Benjamin, but neither was
exceptionally sharp. Cordova
completed eight of 16 passes for
135 yards and two touchdowns,
while Benjamin was five of 14
for 40 yards.
"The two quarterbacks have
been just about as even as can
be," head coach Jack
Christiansen said. "They've
become better friends and are
working together well. I think
either is capable of being a
starter and mature enough to be

a good back-up."
Christiansen said he would
name a starter after the first
week of fall practice.
Neither Cordova nor
Benjamin could get much going
in the first half. The alums led
in first downs most of the way
and held the varsity scoreless
until Cordova passed six yards to
Ray Anderson for the only score
of the first half with 2:27
remaining.
The varsity took advantage of
several second-half scoring
opportunities, but the alums
never advanced past the varsity
31 the entire game. At least they
had some fun.
The alums'lack of substantial
practice time and their absence
from the game resulted in quite

a bit of ad-libbing.
"It was really spontaneous,"
said 1972 Rose Bowl star Don
Bunce. "We made up a lot of
plays in the huddle. I never quite
knew who was protecting me or
who was going to go out for the
pass."
The alums included laterals, a
fake punt and sneak, and
sideline-to-sideline runs in their
act. Late in the game they tried
a flea-flicker type play with
Bunce throwing to end Dr. Bill
McColl, father of the varsity's
defensive end Duncan McColl,
who in turn threw an impressive
spiral downfield to nobody in
particular. The ball fell
incomplete a good 20 yards
beyond the nearest alumni
player.

Buncc completed five of 17
passes for 26 yards and shared
the quarterbacking with Dave
Ottmar (1972-73) and Dick
Norman (1958-60). Ex-Stanford
quarterback Mike Boryla, now
with the Philadelphia Eagles,
served as assistant alumni coach
to Doug Single but did not get
