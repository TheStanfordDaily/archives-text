# Batsmen Drop Cal Series
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS BRAD KREVOY 
The odds on Stanford's
baseball team advancing to the
NCAA playoffs this year are
now about as good as the Beatles
holding a spring concert in
Maples Pavilion.
After losing two of three
games to Cal this weekend, the
season seems to have come to an
end. That won't be official,
though, until this weekend,
when the Pac-8 athletic directors
vote on which two teams to send
to the NCAAs. Still, it would
take a miracle for Stanford
(37-22, 9-9) to be picked as a
wild card entry in the tourney.
In Saturday's doubleheader at
Sunken Diamond, the Cards
opened with a 4-2 win over Cal.
Sharp relief work by Jerry
Argust and Bruce Davis held the
Bears scoreless from the third
inning on.
Stanford scored a scratch run
in the second, when Randy
Wong banged a single off the leg
of Cal pitcher Gary Cowallshen,
scoring Bob Hampton. Then in
the sixth inning, Steve Davis
drilled a 3-1 pitch over the left
I

field fence for a two-run homer.
Bruce Davis took the win,
upping his record to 4-1.
The second game was all
Cal's. A 1 Arthur, the Card's ace
this season, was racked for 11
hits and seven runs in six and
one-third innings, as the Bears
won a laugher, 10-1.
"Arthur had a tender
shoulder, and hadn't pitched all
week," Coach Ray Young
explained. Although Arthur's
shoulder was healed by
Saturday, Young believes the
layoff affected his pitching.
The lone Stanford run came
in the fifth, when Dave Baker
doubled, and Gary Pitchford
singled him in.
On Sunday, the toughness
that has characterized the Cards
all season was again
demonstrated. Unfortunately, it
came too late, as the batsmen
succumbed at Berkeley, 4-1.
In the top of the ninth, down
4-0, the Cards threatened to
make a comeback.

The Bears quickly changed
pitchers and play resumed with
Steve Davis at bat. Davis brought
the count to three balls and two
strikes, but a slider, just on the
outside corner, ended the game
— and probably the season.
It was an up-and-down
campaign for the Cardinals.
Catcher Bruce Robinson hit 13
home runs, setting a Stanford
single season record. And the
Cards stole 141 bases, shattering
the old team mark of 85.
But it was also a season that
saw an amazing number of
sore-armed pitchers. "If Ken
Grolle, Mike Williamson, and
Jerry Argust had been healthy,"
Young speculated, "we would
have won the conference going
away."

I

field fence for a two-run homer.
Bruce Davis took the win,
upping his record to 4-1.
The second game was all
Cal's. A 1 Arthur, the Card's ace
this season, was racked for 11
hits and seven runs in six and
one-third innings, as the Bears
won a laugher, 10-1.
"Arthur had a tender
shoulder, and hadn't pitched all
week," Coach Ray Young
explained. Although Arthur's
shoulder was healed by
Saturday, Young believes the
layoff affected his pitching.
The lone Stanford run came
in the fifth, when Dave Baker
doubled, and Gary Pitchford
singled him in.
On Sunday, the toughness
that has characterized the Cards
all season was again
demonstrated. Unfortunately, it
came too late, as the batsmen
succumbed at Berkeley, 4-1.
In the top of the ninth, down
4-0, the Cards threatened to
make a comeback.

The Bears quickly changed
pitchers and play resumed with
Steve Davis at bat. Davis brought
the count to three balls and two
strikes, but a slider, just on the
outside corner, ended the game
— and probably the season.
It was an up-and-down
campaign for the Cardinals.
Catcher Bruce Robinson hit 13
home runs, setting a Stanford
single season record. And the
Cards stole 141 bases, shattering
the old team mark of 85.
But it was also a season that
saw an amazing number of
sore-armed pitchers. "If Ken
Grolle, Mike Williamson, and
Jerry Argust had been healthy,"
Young speculated, "we would
have won the conference going
away."
The odds on Stanford's
baseball team advancing to the
NCAA playoffs this year are
now about as good as the Beatles
holding a spring concert in
Maples Pavilion.
After losing two of three
games to Cal this weekend, the
season seems to have come to an
end. That won't be official,
though, until this weekend,
when the Pac-8 athletic directors
vote on which two teams to send
to the NCAAs. Still, it would
take a miracle for Stanford
(37-22, 9-9) to be picked as a
wild card entry in the tourney.
In Saturday's doubleheader at
Sunken Diamond, the Cards
opened with a 4-2 win over Cal.
Sharp relief work by Jerry
Argust and Bruce Davis held the
Bears scoreless from the third
inning on.
Stanford scored a scratch run
in the second, when Randy
Wong banged a single off the leg
of Cal pitcher Gary Cowallshen,
scoring Bob Hampton. Then in
the sixth inning, Steve Davis
drilled a 3-1 pitch over the left
I

field fence for a two-run homer.
