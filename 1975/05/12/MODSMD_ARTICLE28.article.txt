Golf
USC captured the Pacific
Eight southern division golf title
by 45 strokes over Stanford at
Half Moon Bay this weekend.
UCLA and California also
competed.
The Cards were led by Mike
Peck at 226. Other scores:
Conrad Nilmeier, 230; Jay
Johnson, 232; Dave Baskins, 238
and George Pettinger, 243.
Right after the match ended,
the Cards left for Eugene,
Oregon, where they will
participate in the Pac-8 finals
today and tomorrow.
The Cards are the defending
champs, but off their southern
division win, USC is considered
the favorite for this year's event.

Stanford's Aly Trompas, who
withdrew after two rounds this
weekend, has been replaced by
Mike Mc√üride in the Pac-8
tourney. Card Coach Bud
Fingers made the move despite
the fact that Trompas was
the league runnerup last year.
Craw
The Cardinal crewmen
traveled to Berkeley Saturday
for rowing's version of the Big
Game against Cal. In recent
years the Bears have made short
work of the Stanford oarsmen
but this year it seemed the story
might end differently. The
Cards, although losing several
races, looked very strong and Cal
seemed to be suffering a down

year. A large crowd of alumni,
including almost the entire 1950
Stanford varsity, was on hand
hoping to witness an
all-too-seldom Stanford victory.
All the crowd got was a nice
sun tan as Cal put the Cards well
back in the first 500 meters.
From there it was up to
Stanford to play the difficult
game of catch-up, and Stanford
never could close the gap. So for
another year the red and white
shirts were turned over to the

Cal victors as the Bears finished
eight seconds up.
Soccer
The Stanford soccer team
wrapped up its spring season
Saturday night with a 2-2 tie
against Santa Clara in San Jose's
Spartan Stadium. Phil Wright
scored both goals for the Cards.
The booters, strengthened by
the return of Rich Caldwell and
Bobby Geiger, ended their
exhibition play with a 5-2-1 record.

Swimming
The Stanford women's swim
team received a big boost with
the signing of a top U.S. female
swimmer this weekend. The
recruit is Jo Harshbarger, the
former world record holder in
the women's 1500 meter
freestyle. Harshbarger, a high
school senior from Bellevue,
Washington, becomes one of the
first to benefit from Stanford's
new policy of awarding athletic
scholarships to women.
