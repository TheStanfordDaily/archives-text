Congress To Faee Refugee Bill
WASHINGTON — Congress faces major action this
week on aid for Indochina refugees, a $32 billion weapons
bill and admitting women in military academies.
The House is to act on a $405 million refugee aid bill,
cut from President Ford's $507 million request for up to
150,000 refugees to a level to pay for about the 114,000
refugees counted so far.
A fight over admitting women to West Point,
Annapolis and the Air Force Academy is promised when
the House takes up a $32 billion weapons bill, probably
Thursday.
Rep. Samuel S. Stratton (D-N.Y.), announced he
would take the issue to the floor after the House Armed
Services Committee rejected his amendment last week to
make women eligible for academy enrollment and all
military duty, including combat.
The $32 billion military hardware authorization for the
15-month period beginning July 1 is $3.7 billion below
Ford's request although only about $1.4 billion is a true
funding cut.
The $3.7 billion includes $1.3 billion in military aid to
South Vietnam and $1 billion in shipbuilding funds
deferred to next year.
White Says Nixon Was 'Unstable'
WASHINGTON — In describing the last days of
Richard Nixon's presidency in his new book, Theodore
White says Nixon had become "an unstable personality"
being eased toward resignation by his staff.
"What the men in the White House were involved in,
without ever admitting it to themselves, was the
management of an unstable personally," wrote White in
his book, Breach of Faith, The Fall of Richard Nixon.
White, chronicler of each presidential campaign since
1960 when John F. Kennedy defeated Nixon, also wrote
that Alexander Haig Jr., Nixon's staff chief, virtually
assumed the duties of president during that period.
According to White, Nixon's resignation came at the
end of an intensive, delicate campaign led by Haig to
convince the embattled chief executive that for the good
of the country, he should leave office voluntarily rather
than attempt to fight impeachment.
Arabs Developing Arms Industry
CAIRO — Four Arab states have taken the first major
step toward establishing an arms industry, forming a joint
authority with $1.04 billion in capital.
Egypt and the wealthy Persian Gulf states of Saudi
Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates formed The
Arab Authority for Military Industry with contributions
of $250 million each. ~
The new group will be exempted from tax and
currency control laws and safeguarded against
nationalization, reports carried in Cairo newspapers said
yesterday.
The announcement did not say so, but the arms plants
are expected to be established in Egypt, which has a vast
pool of trainable manpower. Production would be for
Egypt's army and export to other Arab countries.
Forming the authority represented a major Arab
attempt to capitalize on its growing oil wealth and build

an arms industry to match Israel's.
Refugee Resettlement Slows
WASHINGTON AP — The resettlement of Indochinese
refugees moved into a holding pattern over the weekend,
as money began to run short and the transition camps in
the United States remained full.
"At the moment we're just holding," said a State
Department spokesman asked about progress of the
resettlement.
"The speedy part of the operation has pretty much run
its course," he said yesterday, noting that most of the
refugees who have American relatives have already been
processed through the centers and moved to new homes
around the nation.
For the remaining refugees, he said, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service has begun a more elaborate
clearing process which is taking longer.
And since most of these people don't have relatives in
the United States, the finding of sponsors to help them
get resettled also is taking longer.
As a result, the spokesman said, most of the transition
camps in the United States are at or near capacity and
"there are no plans to go over capacity."
Boston Busing Plan Draws Protest
BOSTON — A new and final desegregation order for
the Boston school system drew adverse reaction yesterday
from many officials and white community leaders.
Unveiled at a news conference Saturday, the so-called
Phase 11, or city wide desegreation plan drawn up by U.S.
District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity, Jr.,would require
the busing of approximately 21,000 students, 12,000 in
lower grades.
Through an aide, Mayor Kevin White said yesterday
that he was disappointed in Garrity's decision because it
would disrupt neighborhoods.
John McDonough, chairman of the Boston School
Committee, who with his committee colleagues had
proposed a no-busing plan,, said Garrity's plan ". .. is a
disaster for the people of the city of Boston."
The Boston chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People said it would have no
comment on the plan until today.
U.S. Losses Cheer Mideast Guerillas
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The dramatic defeat of
American-backed governments in Indochina has boosted
the morals of Palestinian guerrillas in their struggle against
Israel.
"Today Vietnam, tomorrow Palestine," rejoiced the
current cover of Palestine Revolution, the weekly organ of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The United States departure from Saigon and Phnom
Penh was taken as a lesson throughout the Palestinian
movement, from chieftain Yasir Arafat to
machinegun-toting guemllas in remote hill camps.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with night and morning
low clouds or fog near the coast. Highs today and
tomorrow mid 60s to mid 70s. Lows both nights mid 40s
to mid 50s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 m.p.h. afternoons.

U.S. Losses Cheer Mideast Guerillas
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The dramatic defeat of
American-backed governments in Indochina has boosted
the morals of Palestinian guerrillas in their struggle against
Israel.
"Today Vietnam, tomorrow Palestine," rejoiced the
current cover of Palestine Revolution, the weekly organ of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The United States departure from Saigon and Phnom
Penh was taken as a lesson throughout the Palestinian
movement, from chieftain Yasir Arafat to
machinegun-toting guemllas in remote hill camps.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with night and morning
low clouds or fog near the coast. Highs today and
tomorrow mid 60s to mid 70s. Lows both nights mid 40s
to mid 50s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 m.p.h. afternoons.
Congress To Faee Refugee Bill
WASHINGTON — Congress faces major action this
week on aid for Indochina refugees, a $32 billion weapons
bill and admitting women in military academies.
The House is to act on a $405 million refugee aid bill,
cut from President Ford's $507 million request for up to
150,000 refugees to a level to pay for about the 114,000
refugees counted so far.
A fight over admitting women to West Point,
Annapolis and the Air Force Academy is promised when
the House takes up a $32 billion weapons bill, probably
Thursday.
Rep. Samuel S. Stratton (D-N.Y.), announced he
would take the issue to the floor after the House Armed
Services Committee rejected his amendment last week to
make women eligible for academy enrollment and all
military duty, including combat.
The $32 billion military hardware authorization for the
15-month period beginning July 1 is $3.7 billion below
Ford's request although only about $1.4 billion is a true
funding cut.
The $3.7 billion includes $1.3 billion in military aid to
South Vietnam and $1 billion in shipbuilding funds
deferred to next year.
White Says Nixon Was 'Unstable'
WASHINGTON — In describing the last days of
Richard Nixon's presidency in his new book, Theodore
White says Nixon had become "an unstable personality"
being eased toward resignation by his staff.
"What the men in the White House were involved in,
without ever admitting it to themselves, was the
management of an unstable personally," wrote White in
his book, Breach of Faith, The Fall of Richard Nixon.
White, chronicler of each presidential campaign since
1960 when John F. Kennedy defeated Nixon, also wrote
that Alexander Haig Jr., Nixon's staff chief, virtually
assumed the duties of president during that period.
According to White, Nixon's resignation came at the
end of an intensive, delicate campaign led by Haig to
convince the embattled chief executive that for the good
of the country, he should leave office voluntarily rather
than attempt to fight impeachment.
Arabs Developing Arms Industry
CAIRO — Four Arab states have taken the first major
step toward establishing an arms industry, forming a joint
authority with $1.04 billion in capital.
Egypt and the wealthy Persian Gulf states of Saudi
Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates formed The
Arab Authority for Military Industry with contributions
of $250 million each. ~
The new group will be exempted from tax and
currency control laws and safeguarded against
nationalization, reports carried in Cairo newspapers said
yesterday.
The announcement did not say so, but the arms plants
are expected to be established in Egypt, which has a vast
pool of trainable manpower. Production would be for
Egypt's army and export to other Arab countries.
Forming the authority represented a major Arab
attempt to capitalize on its growing oil wealth and build

an arms industry to match Israel's.
Refugee Resettlement Slows
WASHINGTON AP — The resettlement of Indochinese
refugees moved into a holding pattern over the weekend,
as money began to run short and the transition camps in
the United States remained full.
"At the moment we're just holding," said a State
Department spokesman asked about progress of the
resettlement.
"The speedy part of the operation has pretty much run
its course," he said yesterday, noting that most of the
refugees who have American relatives have already been
processed through the centers and moved to new homes
around the nation.
For the remaining refugees, he said, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service has begun a more elaborate
clearing process which is taking longer.
And since most of these people don't have relatives in
the United States, the finding of sponsors to help them
get resettled also is taking longer.
As a result, the spokesman said, most of the transition
camps in the United States are at or near capacity and
"there are no plans to go over capacity."
Boston Busing Plan Draws Protest
BOSTON — A new and final desegregation order for
the Boston school system drew adverse reaction yesterday
from many officials and white community leaders.
Unveiled at a news conference Saturday, the so-called
Phase 11, or city wide desegreation plan drawn up by U.S.
District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity, Jr.,would require
the busing of approximately 21,000 students, 12,000 in
lower grades.
Through an aide, Mayor Kevin White said yesterday
that he was disappointed in Garrity's decision because it
would disrupt neighborhoods.
John McDonough, chairman of the Boston School

and Naturalization Service has begun a more elaborate
clearing process which is taking longer.
And since most of these people don't have relatives in
the United States, the finding of sponsors to help them
get resettled also is taking longer.
As a result, the spokesman said, most of the transition
camps in the United States are at or near capacity and
"there are no plans to go over capacity."
Boston Busing Plan Draws Protest
BOSTON — A new and final desegregation order for
the Boston school system drew adverse reaction yesterday
from many officials and white community leaders.
Unveiled at a news conference Saturday, the so-called
Phase 11, or city wide desegreation plan drawn up by U.S.
District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity, Jr.,would require
the busing of approximately 21,000 students, 12,000 in
lower grades.
Through an aide, Mayor Kevin White said yesterday
that he was disappointed in Garrity's decision because it
would disrupt neighborhoods.
John McDonough, chairman of the Boston School
Committee, who with his committee colleagues had
proposed a no-busing plan,, said Garrity's plan ". .. is a
disaster for the people of the city of Boston."
The Boston chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People said it would have no
comment on the plan until today.
U.S. Losses Cheer Mideast Guerillas
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The dramatic defeat of
American-backed governments in Indochina has boosted
the morals of Palestinian guerrillas in their struggle against
Israel.
"Today Vietnam, tomorrow Palestine," rejoiced the
current cover of Palestine Revolution, the weekly organ of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The United States departure from Saigon and Phnom
Penh was taken as a lesson throughout the Palestinian
movement, from chieftain Yasir Arafat to
machinegun-toting guemllas in remote hill camps.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with night and morning
low clouds or fog near the coast. Highs today and
tomorrow mid 60s to mid 70s. Lows both nights mid 40s
to mid 50s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 m.p.h. afternoons.
Congress To Faee Refugee Bill
WASHINGTON — Congress faces major action this
week on aid for Indochina refugees, a $32 billion weapons
bill and admitting women in military academies.
The House is to act on a $405 million refugee aid bill,
cut from President Ford's $507 million request for up to
150,000 refugees to a level to pay for about the 114,000
refugees counted so far.
A fight over admitting women to West Point,
Annapolis and the Air Force Academy is promised when
the House takes up a $32 billion weapons bill, probably
Thursday.
Rep. Samuel S. Stratton (D-N.Y.), announced he
would take the issue to the floor after the House Armed
Services Committee rejected his amendment last week to
make women eligible for academy enrollment and all
military duty, including combat.
The $32 billion military hardware authorization for the
15-month period beginning July 1 is $3.7 billion below
Ford's request although only about $1.4 billion is a true
funding cut.
The $3.7 billion includes $1.3 billion in military aid to
South Vietnam and $1 billion in shipbuilding funds
deferred to next year.
White Says Nixon Was 'Unstable'
WASHINGTON — In describing the last days of
Richard Nixon's presidency in his new book, Theodore
White says Nixon had become "an unstable personality"
being eased toward resignation by his staff.
"What the men in the White House were involved in,
without ever admitting it to themselves, was the
management of an unstable personally," wrote White in
his book, Breach of Faith, The Fall of Richard Nixon.
White, chronicler of each presidential campaign since
1960 when John F. Kennedy defeated Nixon, also wrote
that Alexander Haig Jr., Nixon's staff chief, virtually
assumed the duties of president during that period.
According to White, Nixon's resignation came at the
end of an intensive, delicate campaign led by Haig to
convince the embattled chief executive that for the good
of the country, he should leave office voluntarily rather
than attempt to fight impeachment.
Arabs Developing Arms Industry
CAIRO — Four Arab states have taken the first major
step toward establishing an arms industry, forming a joint
authority with $1.04 billion in capital.
Egypt and the wealthy Persian Gulf states of Saudi
Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates formed The
Arab Authority for Military Industry with contributions
of $250 million each. ~
The new group will be exempted from tax and
currency control laws and safeguarded against
nationalization, reports carried in Cairo newspapers said
yesterday.
The announcement did not say so, but the arms plants
are expected to be established in Egypt, which has a vast
pool of trainable manpower. Production would be for
Egypt's army and export to other Arab countries.
Forming the authority represented a major Arab
attempt to capitalize on its growing oil wealth and build

an arms industry to match Israel's.
Refugee Resettlement Slows
WASHINGTON AP — The resettlement of Indochinese
refugees moved into a holding pattern over the weekend,
as money began to run short and the transition camps in
the United States remained full.
"At the moment we're just holding," said a State
Department spokesman asked about progress of the
resettlement.
"The speedy part of the operation has pretty much run
its course," he said yesterday, noting that most of the
refugees who have American relatives have already been
processed through the centers and moved to new homes
around the nation.
For the remaining refugees, he said, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service has begun a more elaborate
clearing process which is taking longer.
And since most of these people don't have relatives in
the United States, the finding of sponsors to help them
get resettled also is taking longer.
