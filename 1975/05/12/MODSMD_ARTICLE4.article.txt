# Discovery Offers Hemophiliac Cure
## 
### KATHY JACKSON 
Stanford scientists are investigating
a clotting factor concentrate which
may offer hope for patients with
hemophilia who develop resistance to
treatment.
Hemophilia, found almost
exclusively in males, is the hereditary
tendency to bleed excessively and is
caused by a congenital deficiency of a
substance necessary for clotting.
Hemophiliacs lack one of ten proteins
in blood plasma known to interact and
cause coagulation.
Most patients are currently treated
with infusions of a clotting protein
known as Antihemophilic Globulin
(AHG), also called Factor VIII.
However, about ten percent of these
"inhibitor" patients develop an
antibody to the protein, greatly
complicating therapy.
Accidental Discovery
The clotting effect of the new
concentrate, which apparently
"short-circuits" the need for Factor
VIII, turned up almost accidentally,
said Dr. Judith Pool, professor of
Medicine.
An inhibitor patient was treated
with plasma protein concentrate which
had been rejected for general use
because of "excess activity." The
concentrate, called activated

prothrombin complex, successfully
stimulated clotting in the patient.
As presently understood, blood
clotting is a series of enzymatic
reactions, each reaction dependant on
the previous one. If any of the
necessary enzymes is missing, as in
hemophilia, a clot will not form.
"We suspect that the principal
activated clotting factor in this
concentrate is thrombin, the last
enzyme in the chain," says Pool.
"Now we are trying to identify and
assay it."
Specific Test
Pool also believes that specific tests
can be developed to identify potential
inhibitor patients, once considered
"nearly untreatable," before they
develop antibodies.
One approach used with such
patients at other medical centers, she
noted, is to withhold treatment for
minimal bleeding, saving infusions of
Factor VIII for more serious episodes.
This method prevents increased
antibody formation.
But it also means more
hemorrhaging, slower recovery' and
more crippling from the disease,
according to Pool. "We've found
this condition over and over again in
families."
