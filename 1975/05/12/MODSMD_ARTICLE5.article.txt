# Budget And Minority Issues Spark Nationwide Protest At 10 Colleges
## 
### BILL MacDOUGALL 
Spring has seen a new series of
campus protests.
Students of more than 10 colleges
have protested over minority and
budget issues this year.
However, the only protest to gain
significant administration concessions
has been at Brown University.
Forty black students occupied the
Brown administration building for
three days at the end of April.
A week before the sit-in, most of

Brown's 5000 students had staged a
four-day boycott of classes to protest
budget cuts and minority issues.
University Agreed
The University agreed to recruit
more minority students, to hire a
minority admissions officer
responsible for reviewing minority
applications, to recruit more minority
and female professors and to grant
amnesty to the protesters.
Brown University President Donald
Hornig claimed he knew of "nothing

in the agreement that would have been
different had there not been an
occupation."
Last February, 100 students at the
University of Michigan occupied the
second floor of the administration
building for three days. They were
protesting the University's failure to
live up to its 1972 pledge to increase
minority enrollment 12 percent. This
year's minority enrollment was 10
percent.
The students left after University
President Robben W. Fleming
promised amnesty for the protesters
and further negotiations. As of yet,
the students' demands have not been
met.
Brandeis Protests
At Brandeis University, in
Massachusetts, 30 students occupied
the Sociology building for five days
last week. They demanded the
University drop its plans to kill the
Transitional Year Program (which aids
poorly prepared minority students), to
reduce financial aid and to dismiss
some faculty.
Protesters claimed the
administration's plans would result in
the University being "even richer and
whiter." The University defended the
cuts, claiming they would prevent a
$1.5 million deficit.
Twenty-three UC Santa Barbara
students were arrested following a four
hour occupation of the UCSB
computation center last Sunday.
The following day 700 of
UCSB's 13,000 students rallied in
favor of amnesty for the arrested
students and increased funding for
minority programs.
Boycott Classes
At the University of Massachusetts
last week, 15,500 of the University's
22,000 students boycotted classes for

two days, protesting increases in
tuition and fees. Students organized
40 workshops on such subjects as
"Higher Education and the Current
Crisis" and "Lobbying Tactics."
The following day, 1000 students
marched to the Massachusetts
statehouse.
The Memorial Infirmary was
firebombed at the Claremont Colleges
on May 5, causing $25,000 damage. In
addition, several buildings, bridges and
students' cars have been defaced with
spray paint.
Twenty students occupied the
Claremont Business Office for 13
hours to protest the termination of
funding for summer workshops for
minorities.
Harvard Protests
Twelve Harvard blacks staged a four
hour sit-in in the administration
building on May 2 to protest alleged
university procrastination in
establishing the proposed W.E.B.
Du Bois Institute for Afro-American
Studies. Two hundred students
marched outside the occupied
building.
The Harvard students also
complained about tuition, faculty
cutbacks and the proposed format of
the institute.
Forty San Jose State students
demanded the rehiring of radical
professors in a protest on April 30.
SWOPSI Director Andrew Parnes was
one of the professors fired last year.
Other demands included the
reenfranchisement of Economics
faculty members and curriculum
changes.
City University of New York
students demonstrated against Mayor
Abraham Beame's budget cutting
plans. Nine hundred students joined
that protest.

have protested over minority and
budget issues this year.
However, the only protest to gain
significant administration concessions
has been at Brown University.
Forty black students occupied the
Brown administration building for
three days at the end of April.
A week before the sit-in, most of

Brown's 5000 students had staged a
four-day boycott of classes to protest
budget cuts and minority issues.
University Agreed
The University agreed to recruit
more minority students, to hire a
minority admissions officer
responsible for reviewing minority
applications, to recruit more minority
and female professors and to grant
amnesty to the protesters.
Brown University President Donald
Hornig claimed he knew of "nothing

in the agreement that would have been
different had there not been an
occupation."
Last February, 100 students at the
University of Michigan occupied the
second floor of the administration
building for three days. They were
protesting the University's failure to
live up to its 1972 pledge to increase
minority enrollment 12 percent. This
year's minority enrollment was 10
percent.
The students left after University
President Robben W. Fleming
promised amnesty for the protesters
and further negotiations. As of yet,
the students' demands have not been
met.
Brandeis Protests
At Brandeis University, in
Massachusetts, 30 students occupied
the Sociology building for five days
last week. They demanded the
University drop its plans to kill the
Transitional Year Program (which aids
poorly prepared minority students), to
reduce financial aid and to dismiss
some faculty.
Protesters claimed the
administration's plans would result in
the University being "even richer and
whiter." The University defended the
cuts, claiming they would prevent a
$1.5 million deficit.
Twenty-three UC Santa Barbara
students were arrested following a four
hour occupation of the UCSB
computation center last Sunday.
The following day 700 of
UCSB's 13,000 students rallied in
favor of amnesty for the arrested
students and increased funding for
minority programs.
Boycott Classes
At the University of Massachusetts
last week, 15,500 of the University's
22,000 students boycotted classes for

two days, protesting increases in
tuition and fees. Students organized
40 workshops on such subjects as
"Higher Education and the Current
Crisis" and "Lobbying Tactics."
The following day, 1000 students
marched to the Massachusetts
statehouse.
The Memorial Infirmary was
firebombed at the Claremont Colleges
on May 5, causing $25,000 damage. In
addition, several buildings, bridges and
students' cars have been defaced with
spray paint.
Twenty students occupied the
Claremont Business Office for 13
hours to protest the termination of
funding for summer workshops for
minorities.
Harvard Protests
Twelve Harvard blacks staged a four
hour sit-in in the administration
building on May 2 to protest alleged
university procrastination in
establishing the proposed W.E.B.
Du Bois Institute for Afro-American
Studies. Two hundred students
marched outside the occupied
building.
The Harvard students also
complained about tuition, faculty
cutbacks and the proposed format of
the institute.
Forty San Jose State students
demanded the rehiring of radical
professors in a protest on April 30.
SWOPSI Director Andrew Parnes was
one of the professors fired last year.
Other demands included the
reenfranchisement of Economics
faculty members and curriculum
changes.
City University of New York
students demonstrated against Mayor
Abraham Beame's budget cutting
plans. Nine hundred students joined
that protest.
