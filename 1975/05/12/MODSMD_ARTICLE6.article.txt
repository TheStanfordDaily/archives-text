## 
### CRAIG DENNIS 
Action Research Liason Office
(ARLO), ASSU Special Events and
ASSU Sunday Flicks will move from
the loft to the main level of the ASSU
office under a plan proposed by
recently-elected ASSU President Lee
Rosenbaum.
The Council of Presidents (COP) will
occupy the loft along with the ASSU
Senate Chairman and the ASSU
Committee's staff assistant. The ASSU
Lecture Note Service will move to the
vacated space on the main level.
"The idea is that the ASSU services
will be downstairs where people can
get at them," explained Rosenbaum.
Few costs are envisioned in the move
planned for June.
"The COP does not have to deal
with students on a day by day, hour
by hour basis, while the ASSU services
do," said ASSU Special Events
Director Randy Phillips.
ARLO plans to continue operation
next year at a reduced rate, because of
the defeated fee assessment. ARLO
and Special Events will receive
smaller offices but a more acessible
location. The Lecture Note Service
will move into a larger office.
