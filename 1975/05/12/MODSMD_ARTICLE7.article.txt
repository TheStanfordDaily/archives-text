# Control Of Laos Falling To Reds
## 
### 
VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) - The
Laotian government last night
appealed to the populace to remain
calm, denied rumors there would be
bloodshed in Vientiane and prohibited
Laotian and foreign residents from
leaving the country.
The directives were given under the
name of the mixed security forces, the
security body of the coalition
government of rightists, leftists and
neutralists set up under the 1973
peace accord to keep peace in the
capital.
To Forestall Rumors
They were aimed at forestalling
rumors and fears that a violent transfer
of power to the Communist-led Pathet
Lao was imminent.
The rumors came after Premier
Souvanna Phouma virtually conceded
yesterday that the Pathet Lao have
won the struggle for control of Laos.
He said it is necessary to look at the

facts and prepare to reach "an accord
with history."
The radio urged people to obt'y
government orders and blamed rumors
that then* would be bloodshed on
"certain rightist groups" who were
trying to panic the population.
It said the joint security forces in
Vientiane, made up of Pathet Lao and
former rightist troops, would ensure
the security of the city.
Exodus of Officials
Although there has been an exodus
of high ranking officials associated
with rightist, pro-American groups,
and Vietnamese and Chinese
businessmen, the city has been calm.
Shops were shut yesterday, but
most Laotians appeared unaffected
and unconcerned. There has been no
obvious change in the day to day life,
only one demonstration Friday in
which the U.S. Embassy was stoned by
students.
Hotels and restaurants were open as
usual. There were no Pathet Lao
troops, who number more than 2000
in the city, seen on the streets.
Communist Control
If the Pathet Lao win control of
Laos, the country will be the third of
the U.S.-backed countries of
Indochina to come under Communist
control in recent weeks. Cambodia
surrendered April 17 and South
Vietnam on April 30.
Souvanna's speech followed the
resignation of four senior rightist
cabinet ministers and the removal of
three top rightist generals from their
posts. This amounts to the collapse of
the pro-American wing of the coalition
government and leaves the Pathet Lao
as the only cohesive political
organization in the country.
A coalition government was set up
in Laos on the basis of the peace
accords signed in Paris in February
1973. The rightists and the Pathet Lao
each were given six cabinet posts and
neutralists two.
Military forces of the rightists and
the Pathet Lao were assigned to
different areas of the country.
Vientiane and the royal capital of
Luang Prabang were declared neutral.
However, sporadic military clashes
have occurred since April.
The announcement by the
73-year-old Souvanna amounts to his
concession to his 63-year-old
half-brother, Prince Souphanouvong,
who heads the Pathet Lao. The
Paris-educated sons of a Lao prince
have differed for much of their lives
over the path that Laos should take.
Both favored its independence from
France after World War 11, but
Souvanna chose to work within the
existing government for gradual
change while Souphanouvong went to
Hanoi to join Ho Chi Minh's Viet
Minh. He later founded the Pathet
Lao.
Souvanna, a U.S.-backed neutralist
who has long tried to balance the
right-wing and Communist sides in
Laos, told a gathering of high officials
including King Sisavang Vathana that
20 years of upheavals "have clearly
resulted in a new situation.
"We must stop the fighting. The
war has reached an end," he said.

leaving the country.
The directives were given under the
name of the mixed security forces, the
security body of the coalition
government of rightists, leftists and
neutralists set up under the 1973
peace accord to keep peace in the
capital.
To Forestall Rumors
They were aimed at forestalling
rumors and fears that a violent transfer
of power to the Communist-led Pathet
Lao was imminent.
The rumors came after Premier
Souvanna Phouma virtually conceded
yesterday that the Pathet Lao have
won the struggle for control of Laos.
He said it is necessary to look at the

facts and prepare to reach "an accord
with history."
The radio urged people to obt'y
government orders and blamed rumors
that then* would be bloodshed on
"certain rightist groups" who were
trying to panic the population.
It said the joint security forces in
Vientiane, made up of Pathet Lao and
former rightist troops, would ensure
the security of the city.
Exodus of Officials
Although there has been an exodus
of high ranking officials associated
with rightist, pro-American groups,
and Vietnamese and Chinese
businessmen, the city has been calm.
Shops were shut yesterday, but
most Laotians appeared unaffected
and unconcerned. There has been no
obvious change in the day to day life,
only one demonstration Friday in
which the U.S. Embassy was stoned by
students.
Hotels and restaurants were open as
usual. There were no Pathet Lao
troops, who number more than 2000
in the city, seen on the streets.
Communist Control
If the Pathet Lao win control of
Laos, the country will be the third of
the U.S.-backed countries of
Indochina to come under Communist
control in recent weeks. Cambodia
surrendered April 17 and South
Vietnam on April 30.
Souvanna's speech followed the
resignation of four senior rightist
cabinet ministers and the removal of
three top rightist generals from their
posts. This amounts to the collapse of
the pro-American wing of the coalition
government and leaves the Pathet Lao
as the only cohesive political
organization in the country.
A coalition government was set up
in Laos on the basis of the peace
accords signed in Paris in February
1973. The rightists and the Pathet Lao
each were given six cabinet posts and
neutralists two.
Military forces of the rightists and
the Pathet Lao were assigned to
different areas of the country.
Vientiane and the royal capital of
Luang Prabang were declared neutral.
However, sporadic military clashes
have occurred since April.
The announcement by the
73-year-old Souvanna amounts to his
concession to his 63-year-old
half-brother, Prince Souphanouvong,
who heads the Pathet Lao. The
Paris-educated sons of a Lao prince
have differed for much of their lives
over the path that Laos should take.
Both favored its independence from
France after World War 11, but
Souvanna chose to work within the
existing government for gradual
change while Souphanouvong went to
Hanoi to join Ho Chi Minh's Viet
Minh. He later founded the Pathet
Lao.
Souvanna, a U.S.-backed neutralist
who has long tried to balance the
right-wing and Communist sides in
Laos, told a gathering of high officials
including King Sisavang Vathana that
20 years of upheavals "have clearly
resulted in a new situation.
"We must stop the fighting. The
war has reached an end," he said.
