## Capitalist Way 
### 
Of late, it has become
popular to blame the American
way of life generally, and
capitalism specifically, for most
of the ills of the world. A recent
example is Terry Bright's
column in the Daily (May 6). His
attacks are used as a model for
reply out of convenience, not
because his distortions are any
more egregious than those of
many other critics.
Ms. Bright begins with the
familiar allegation that the U.S.
exports scarcity by exploiting
foreign resources. This charge is
flatly contradicted by the facts.
The U.S. comprises about six
percent of the world's
population and land mass, but
produces over 20 percent of the
world's food. If the U.S. were
eliminated from the world map,
inestimable millions would
starve.
The weary argument that
capitalism causes irrational use
of resources ("50 brands of
cigarettes") and worker
insecurity merits brief
consideration. While every
person could list products which
seem to waste resources, no
single product would appear on
all of these lists. Furthermore,

indicates that "irrational" use of
resources is not restricted to
capitalist countries.
Moreover, job security and a
better standard of living do not
always coincide. Great Britain's
plight demonstrates this point.
Finally, substantial ethical
questions are raised by
eliminating capitalism that
critics blithely ignore. It is
important to remember that one
must first disagree with the
statement, "A person should
have a right to what he
produces" before he can endorse
any system other than
capitalism.
In short, theoretical
arguments against capitalism
tend to include extremely facile
assumptions. Empirical
arguments tend to ignore the
overwhelming weight of the
evidence. It is the privilege of
the critics to ignore the facts in
their attacks. We only hope, for
everyone's sake, that these
attacks are appropriately
discounted.
