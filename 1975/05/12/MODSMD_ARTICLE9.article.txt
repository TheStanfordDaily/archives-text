# Just Sour Grapes

To those not initiated in the
mysteries of the social sciences,
the current dispute over the
selection of Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as this year's
commencement speaker may
seem to have a slightly medieval
flavor. Much of the argument is
of the form:
"I say these are apples."
"No â€” they aren't oranges."
So it is intractable to discussion.
Nonetheless, two separate
vortices of controversy are
distinguishable.
The first concerns
Moynihan's scholarship as a
social scientist, particularly in
The Negro Family. Why
scholarship should be an issue is
problematic, since it has hardly
been a requirement of previous
speakers (e.g. Eric Sevareid,
Charles Percy, John Monro,
etc.), and Moynihan is also a
well-known author and public
servant.
As for the Moynihan Report,
it may be said that its argument
is less persuasive than the
Binomial Theorem. Of course,
the same is true of its supposed
refutations, and indeed of much
of social science in general.
But whatever the weaknesses
in their argument, Moynihan and
his collaborator, Nathan Glazer,
have explicitly deplored the
quality of the data available to
them at the time of their work,
and have always advanced their
thesis in a style far more
tentative than dogmatic.
Anyone who suggests that
such opinion is beyond the pale
of consideration by reasonable
men and women of good will is
either presuming too much of
the evidence, or gratuitously

limiting the scope of discourse.
It is hard to escape the
conclusion that the issue of
Moynihan's scholarship is
secondary here, and that at the
heart of the controversy is
politics. On the one hand is Ben
Brown's Daily letter of Feb. 20:
"Implicit in this [The Negro
Family | is the notion that
change must occur within the
black community rather than in
American society as a
whole... In this analysis of
social organization, Moynihan
shows definite race and class
bias."
On the other hand, Moynihan
has always shied away from
moralistic recrminations and has
rejected political radicalism as
being unrealistic.
Therefore St. Clair Drake et
al could write in their Daily
letter of April 30: "The Negro
Family diverted attention from a
concentrated attack upon
unemployment and racism." But
of course Moynihan's point is
that no totalistic attack is
politically possible in a society
as diverse i<s America, since the
just rights of different interest
groups inevitably collide, and
radical rhetoric on either side
becomes counter-productively
provocative. Until the current
anti-Moynihanian gaucheries
pass away, I shall perforce tune
down my sensitivities by means
of a therapy which Drake etal
may also find useful, and wh>ch
is summarized by the following
rule of thumb: the best cure for
moral indigestion is to swear off
sour grapes.
