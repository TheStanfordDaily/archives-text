# Lusignan Debates Use Of Iranian Satellite
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The Iranian government will be able
to purchase a communications system
from five or six international
companies if Stanford doesn't
undertake its development, stated
Assoc. Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan last night.
Lusignan made the remarks in an
open debate in Tresidder Large
Lounge with an audience of
approximately 100 opponents of the
contract.
The Iranian contract calls for
development of a communications
satellite to provide adult level
education to the rural sectors of Iran.
Oscar Gandy, a communications
researcher and Ph.D. candidate who
has researched the project, asked
Lusignan what studies have been made
by the system's planners regarding the
import of the satellite and what
economic and political restraints are
implicit in the contract.
"I have prepared an analysis and
concluded that the system would be
disastrous," said Gandy. Lusignan
asked him to submit his results to the
system's planners.
Leads To Repression
A student representing the Iranian
Students Association (ISA), attacked
the contract, claiming that it would
lead to an increase of repression in
Iran.
"If we believe that such a system
can be operated, I think that the only
solution we can draw is that it is going
to be used by the | Iranian | regime to
further repression. . ~" he commented.
He followed this statement by offering
a warmly-received resolution calling
for the Engineering Department and
the National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT) to terminate the
contract.
Other Iranians argued that NIRT is
merely a branch of the government,
and that as such, the government will
merely utilize the communication
system to further its allegedly
repressive aims. As one student

pointed out, the chief of NIRT is also
a member of SAVAC, the Iranian
secret police.
'Military Purposes'
Further evidence of the regime's
intent to use the communications
satellite for repression, he noted, is a
government statement that it "would
be used for educational
communication and military
purposes."
Lusignan replied that the contract
is being developed in close conjunction
with education authorities in Iran and
not under government supervision.
"They [the minority educators] are
uncomfortable with the political
system in Iran, but they are working
for education goals that we agree
with," said Lusignan.
Basic Goals
Asked what these "goals" were,
Lusignan refused to give specifics, just
noting that they are basic goals of
most educational systems.
A number of individuals contested
Lusignan's claim that Iranian
educators enjoy independence.
"There is no such thing as an
independent education institution in
Iran," emphasized one Iranian student.
ISA Not Representative
Lusignan also claimed that the
attitude of the Iranian students at the
debate is not representative of Iranian
student opinion as a whole. He said
that the research team had talked to
many who supported the project's
objectives and offered their assistance.
"My view is that . . . many of them
are uncomfortable with the political
situation in Iran; however, they feel
that they can work with it," said
Lusignan.
Many members of the audience
questioned this contention, asking to
which Iranian students Lusignan had
spoken. One pointed out that
Lusignan's impression may be
incorrect, claiming that the Shah of
Iran stipulated when giving
scholarships that students must not

oppose the communications satellite
project.
Shut Down School
As evidence of student opinion, the
Iranian also noted that his government
has had to close down Teheran
University because of student protests
over government policy.
Lusignan enumerated two
conditions under which he would have
opposed the Iran contract: if the
Iranian government had not followed a
strategy of getting the system
competitively and if control of the
project did not allow him to work
"jointly with the planning and
educational institutions in the
country."
Asked whether Nazi Germany and
Vietnam might have qualified for a
contract under his criteria, Lusignan
claimed that neither probably would
have been able to meet these
conditions.
Questioned Tactics
Lusignan also questioned whether
the tactics of the ISA were an
improvement over the Shah's. He
claimed that many Iranian students
have been intimidated by "the type of
threats people from your group are
making against them."
A representative of the ISA said the
organization is a democratic group
which has never used coercion to
persuade Iranian students to agree
with its viewpoints.
He also said that Lusignan's
statement "accuses us of being a
fascist organization. That is a threat
and I want to you to take that back."
Lusignan responded that his
statement had been misinterpreted.

oppose the communications satellite
project.
Shut Down School
As evidence of student opinion, the
Iranian also noted that his government
has had to close down Teheran
University because of student protests
over government policy.
Lusignan enumerated two
conditions under which he would have
opposed the Iran contract: if the
Iranian government had not followed a
strategy of getting the system
competitively and if control of the
project did not allow him to work
"jointly with the planning and
educational institutions in the
country."
Asked whether Nazi Germany and
Vietnam might have qualified for a
contract under his criteria, Lusignan
claimed that neither probably would
have been able to meet these
conditions.
Questioned Tactics
Lusignan also questioned whether
the tactics of the ISA were an
improvement over the Shah's. He
claimed that many Iranian students
have been intimidated by "the type of
threats people from your group are
making against them."
A representative of the ISA said the
organization is a democratic group
which has never used coercion to
persuade Iranian students to agree
with its viewpoints.
He also said that Lusignan's
statement "accuses us of being a
fascist organization. That is a threat
and I want to you to take that back."
Lusignan responded that his
statement had been misinterpreted.
The Iranian government will be able
to purchase a communications system
from five or six international
companies if Stanford doesn't
undertake its development, stated
Assoc. Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan last night.
Lusignan made the remarks in an
open debate in Tresidder Large
Lounge with an audience of
approximately 100 opponents of the
contract.
The Iranian contract calls for
development of a communications
satellite to provide adult level
education to the rural sectors of Iran.
Oscar Gandy, a communications
researcher and Ph.D. candidate who
has researched the project, asked
Lusignan what studies have been made
by the system's planners regarding the
import of the satellite and what
economic and political restraints are
implicit in the contract.
"I have prepared an analysis and
concluded that the system would be
disastrous," said Gandy. Lusignan
asked him to submit his results to the
system's planners.
Leads To Repression
A student representing the Iranian
Students Association (ISA), attacked
the contract, claiming that it would
lead to an increase of repression in
Iran.
"If we believe that such a system
can be operated, I think that the only
solution we can draw is that it is going
to be used by the | Iranian | regime to
further repression. . ~" he commented.
He followed this statement by offering
a warmly-received resolution calling
for the Engineering Department and
the National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT) to terminate the
contract.
Other Iranians argued that NIRT is
merely a branch of the government,
and that as such, the government will
merely utilize the communication
system to further its allegedly
repressive aims. As one student

pointed out, the chief of NIRT is also
a member of SAVAC, the Iranian
secret police.
'Military Purposes'
Further evidence of the regime's
intent to use the communications
satellite for repression, he noted, is a
government statement that it "would
be used for educational
communication and military
purposes."
Lusignan replied that the contract
is being developed in close conjunction
with education authorities in Iran and
not under government supervision.
"They [the minority educators] are
uncomfortable with the political
system in Iran, but they are working
for education goals that we agree
with," said Lusignan.
Basic Goals
Asked what these "goals" were,
Lusignan refused to give specifics, just
noting that they are basic goals of
most educational systems.
A number of individuals contested
Lusignan's claim that Iranian
educators enjoy independence.
"There is no such thing as an
independent education institution in
Iran," emphasized one Iranian student.
ISA Not Representative
Lusignan also claimed that the
attitude of the Iranian students at the
debate is not representative of Iranian
student opinion as a whole. He said
that the research team had talked to
many who supported the project's
objectives and offered their assistance.

system's planners.
Leads To Repression
A student representing the Iranian
Students Association (ISA), attacked
the contract, claiming that it would
lead to an increase of repression in
Iran.
"If we believe that such a system
can be operated, I think that the only
solution we can draw is that it is going
to be used by the | Iranian | regime to
further repression. . ~" he commented.
He followed this statement by offering
a warmly-received resolution calling
for the Engineering Department and
the National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT) to terminate the
contract.
Other Iranians argued that NIRT is
merely a branch of the government,
and that as such, the government will
merely utilize the communication
system to further its allegedly
repressive aims. As one student

pointed out, the chief of NIRT is also
a member of SAVAC, the Iranian
secret police.
'Military Purposes'
Further evidence of the regime's
intent to use the communications
satellite for repression, he noted, is a
government statement that it "would
be used for educational
communication and military
purposes."
Lusignan replied that the contract
is being developed in close conjunction
with education authorities in Iran and
not under government supervision.
"They [the minority educators] are
uncomfortable with the political
system in Iran, but they are working
for education goals that we agree
with," said Lusignan.
Basic Goals
Asked what these "goals" were,
Lusignan refused to give specifics, just
noting that they are basic goals of
most educational systems.
A number of individuals contested
Lusignan's claim that Iranian
educators enjoy independence.
"There is no such thing as an
independent education institution in
Iran," emphasized one Iranian student.
ISA Not Representative
Lusignan also claimed that the
attitude of the Iranian students at the
debate is not representative of Iranian
student opinion as a whole. He said
that the research team had talked to
many who supported the project's
objectives and offered their assistance.
"My view is that . . . many of them
are uncomfortable with the political
situation in Iran; however, they feel
that they can work with it," said
Lusignan.
Many members of the audience
questioned this contention, asking to
which Iranian students Lusignan had
spoken. One pointed out that
Lusignan's impression may be
incorrect, claiming that the Shah of
Iran stipulated when giving
scholarships that students must not

oppose the communications satellite
project.
Shut Down School
As evidence of student opinion, the
Iranian also noted that his government
has had to close down Teheran
University because of student protests
over government policy.
Lusignan enumerated two
conditions under which he would have
opposed the Iran contract: if the
Iranian government had not followed a
strategy of getting the system
competitively and if control of the
project did not allow him to work
"jointly with the planning and
educational institutions in the
country."
Asked whether Nazi Germany and
Vietnam might have qualified for a
contract under his criteria, Lusignan
claimed that neither probably would
have been able to meet these
conditions.
Questioned Tactics
Lusignan also questioned whether
the tactics of the ISA were an
improvement over the Shah's. He
claimed that many Iranian students
have been intimidated by "the type of
threats people from your group are
making against them."
A representative of the ISA said the
organization is a democratic group
which has never used coercion to
persuade Iranian students to agree
with its viewpoints.
He also said that Lusignan's
statement "accuses us of being a
fascist organization. That is a threat
and I want to you to take that back."
Lusignan responded that his
statement had been misinterpreted.
