# Sit-ins: Short Sighted Tactic
## Bruce Smyth 
### 
One of the perquisites of becoming
Arena editor is that thereafter one's
viewpoint is inevitably classified as
"the conservative opinion" on the
topic, in this case a discussion of
student occupations of administration
buildings.
Yet the opinion I express here is
not a uniquely conservative one: it
used to be a viewpoint almost all
liberals held. At one time, it would
have seemed pointless or at least
uninteresting to discuss building
occupations, for there used to be a
firm consensus.
But that was back in the days when
a totalitarian was regarded as a
totalitarian whether he was on the
right or left. And that was when being
a liberal meant that one deplored using
physical force in the University to get
one's point across — no matter how
"legitimate" that point was.
Consensus
The consensus went something like
this: Students c<Juld, and in fact
should, have a voice in University
decision-making, not because they had
any proprietary right to do so, but
because it was beneficial to the
University. Students, in being students,
have a unique and valuable viewpoint
to contribute to the development of
the University.
If their proposals were not
followed, they could lobby faculty,
organize, argue, cajole, or peacefully
demonstrate at appropriate times and
places, e.g. in White Plaza rather than
in a class. And if that failed, they
could always elect to spend their
$5500 a year at a place somewhat
more amenable to their ideas. But they
could not use physical force.
Building sit-ins, no matter how
"non-violent" they are, physically
force University operations to halt.
Under such blackmail conditions,
negotiations are to take place. The

threat is clear: give in or we will
continue to disrupt operations.
Short-Sighted Tactics
Yet the use of such force is not
only morally wrong, but I submit that
it is a short-sighted use of tactics. It is
no surprise that, in certain cases, sit-ins
are effective, as the Brown University
occupation shows. College
administrators are not a notably
strong-willed bunch, and when force is
used, they often give in.
They will of course deny that they
are doing soT* as Brown President
Donald Hirsig did. stating in the true
Ron Ziegler tradition "we did not
negotiate under a gun" and then going
on to state "I will never do business
again as we did this last week,"
explaining that he meant negotiating
in such "a crisis situation." They fool
no one, except, perhaps, themselves.
While an occupation of the Old

Union might successfully force the
University to give greater financial aid
to minorities, an occupation by a
different group demanding completely
equal financial aid instead of the
present plan might also be effective, as
might a protest to hire fewer Marxists
or to bring back ROTC.
'Daily'Sit-In?
Indeed, there is nothing to prevent
the sit-in tactic from being applied to

its loudest boosters. A week ago, a
Daily editorial praised the "effective
and justifiable responses to a secret
university decision-making process" at
Brown.
But are Daily editorial board
meetings open to the public? Has the
Daily been responsive to student input
lately?
Then perhaps students should sit in
at the Storke building and thus
prevent them from publishing until
they agree to become more responsive
or until they call the police.
And so the University, where reason
and rational discourse are supposed to
reign supreme, can become a
battleground where those who most
skillfully use force rule.
Lower Discussion Level
The tactics of the sit-in inevitably
lower the level of discussion of
University problems. The "demands"
presented almost always concentrate
on a specific problem, say, faculty
cutbacks, while ignoring the larger
picture, in this case, the undeniable
fact that University expenditures are
outrunning revenues. Yet alternative
cutbacks are never offered.
1 hope that the days of the tactics
of the sit-in and other uses of force
never return, for they degrade
reasoned discussion and turn different
segments of the University community
against one another. Yet il those days
are upon us again 1 hope that the
organization concerned, be it the
Stanford administration or the
Stanford Daily, would employ
legitimate authorities to remove
demonstrators instead of submitting to
a low-key type of blackmail.
While descending to the tactics of
forceful building occupation would be
unfortunate, allowing such tactics to
succeed would in the long run be far
worse still — for both the University
and society as a whole.

One of the perquisites of becoming
Arena editor is that thereafter one's
viewpoint is inevitably classified as
"the conservative opinion" on the
topic, in this case a discussion of
student occupations of administration
buildings.
Yet the opinion I express here is
not a uniquely conservative one: it
used to be a viewpoint almost all
liberals held. At one time, it would
have seemed pointless or at least
uninteresting to discuss building
occupations, for there used to be a
firm consensus.
But that was back in the days when
a totalitarian was regarded as a
totalitarian whether he was on the
right or left. And that was when being
a liberal meant that one deplored using
physical force in the University to get
one's point across — no matter how
"legitimate" that point was.
Consensus
The consensus went something like
this: Students c<Juld, and in fact
should, have a voice in University
decision-making, not because they had
any proprietary right to do so, but
because it was beneficial to the
University. Students, in being students,
have a unique and valuable viewpoint
to contribute to the development of
the University.
If their proposals were not
followed, they could lobby faculty,
organize, argue, cajole, or peacefully
demonstrate at appropriate times and
places, e.g. in White Plaza rather than
in a class. And if that failed, they
could always elect to spend their
$5500 a year at a place somewhat
more amenable to their ideas. But they
could not use physical force.
Building sit-ins, no matter how
"non-violent" they are, physically
force University operations to halt.
Under such blackmail conditions,
negotiations are to take place. The

threat is clear: give in or we will
continue to disrupt operations.
Short-Sighted Tactics
Yet the use of such force is not
only morally wrong, but I submit that
it is a short-sighted use of tactics. It is
no surprise that, in certain cases, sit-ins
are effective, as the Brown University
occupation shows. College
administrators are not a notably
strong-willed bunch, and when force is
used, they often give in.
They will of course deny that they
are doing soT* as Brown President
Donald Hirsig did. stating in the true
Ron Ziegler tradition "we did not
negotiate under a gun" and then going
on to state "I will never do business
again as we did this last week,"
explaining that he meant negotiating
in such "a crisis situation." They fool
no one, except, perhaps, themselves.
While an occupation of the Old

Union might successfully force the
University to give greater financial aid
to minorities, an occupation by a
different group demanding completely
equal financial aid instead of the
present plan might also be effective, as
might a protest to hire fewer Marxists
or to bring back ROTC.
'Daily'Sit-In?
Indeed, there is nothing to prevent
the sit-in tactic from being applied to

its loudest boosters. A week ago, a
Daily editorial praised the "effective
and justifiable responses to a secret
university decision-making process" at
Brown.
But are Daily editorial board
meetings open to the public? Has the
Daily been responsive to student input
lately?
Then perhaps students should sit in
at the Storke building and thus
prevent them from publishing until
they agree to become more responsive
or until they call the police.
And so the University, where reason
and rational discourse are supposed to
reign supreme, can become a
battleground where those who most
skillfully use force rule.
Lower Discussion Level
The tactics of the sit-in inevitably
lower the level of discussion of
University problems. The "demands"
presented almost always concentrate
on a specific problem, say, faculty
cutbacks, while ignoring the larger
picture, in this case, the undeniable
fact that University expenditures are
outrunning revenues. Yet alternative
cutbacks are never offered.
1 hope that the days of the tactics
of the sit-in and other uses of force
never return, for they degrade
reasoned discussion and turn different
segments of the University community
against one another. Yet il those days
are upon us again 1 hope that the
organization concerned, be it the
Stanford administration or the
Stanford Daily, would employ
legitimate authorities to remove
demonstrators instead of submitting to
a low-key type of blackmail.
While descending to the tactics of
forceful building occupation would be
unfortunate, allowing such tactics to
succeed would in the long run be far
worse still — for both the University
and society as a whole.
