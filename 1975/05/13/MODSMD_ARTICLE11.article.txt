# Those In Power Listen To Demonstrators
## Chris Gray, Don Zweig 
### 
Demonstrations work. They bring changes in the
form of concessions, education and a sense of
solidarity among the people.
A look at universities attests to the effectiveness
of demoastrating. Minority programs at campuses
all over America were the direct result of the
militant demonstrations after Martin Luther King's
murder.
At Stanford, the elimination of classified
research, chemical and biological warfare research,
ROTC and ties with Stanford Research Institute
were all the direct result of student protests.
Last month at Brown University a building
takeover brought about an immediate change in
administration policy.
Here, just last week, the mini-sit-in on Lasuen
St. was immediately successful. Those in power
only listen when it is in their interests.
Demonstrations make it in their interest to listen.
Contribute To Larger Struggles
In a less direct fashion demonstrations
contribute to larger struggles. Without a doubt the
anti-war movement had a profound effect not only
on the decisions of Presidents Johnson. Nixon and
Ford but also on the struggling Vietnamese and
Cambodian people.
Khieu Samphan thanked the American people
for their help in his victory speech after the
liberation of Cambodia.
The Vietnamese people have always been very
aware of the "American Front." Events like the El
Camino march and bust of April 1972 were given
extensive coverage on North Vietnamese radios.
Educational Importance
Demonstrations are also very important
educationally. They create an atmosphere in which
people must think about and confront the issues.
For the demonstrator, the response to the
demonstration can be profoundly educational.
A series of protests bring about a climate of
change which leads to other reforms and structural
changes. SWOPSI and SCIRE are two perfect
examples. It is important to note that once the
marching stops, the programs are attacked.
Finally, demonstrations bring the struggle and
its issues to other sectors of society that may not
otherwise have access to alternative viewpoints. For
example, student protests against the Vietnam War

encouraged workers to protest and Gl's to revolt.
Right, Responsibility
We all have the right and the responsibility to
demonstrate. We have the right to demonstrate
because we have the right to reach out and take
control of our own lives. We have the responsibility
because to fail to oppose what is evil, is to condone
it.
Many of us who will demonstrate today have
come to the realization that the oppression of
Vietnamese of Chileans, of Iranians, of blacks, of
chicanos, of women and of workers is our
oppression too.
Not just in the sense that they are our brothers
and sisters but also in the coldly pragmatic
realization that our alienation and oppression

springs from the same system. We must struggle
against it together if we hope to change it.
Real Community
This struggle itself, forges a real community out
of those who struggle together. It often transends
the alienation that is so basic to most people's lives.
We are at Stanford now. It is our community.
And if we don't protest and attempt to change it
when we see it as wrong, we must bear the
responsibility for its actions.
It is not President Lyman's Stanford. It is not
the trustees' Stanford. It is not the Shah's
Stanford. It is not a question of who "owns"
Stanford or under what conditions we came to be
here.
In 1776, when Americans rebelled, it wasn't a
question of who "owned" America or how they
came to be there.
Stanford Rulers
This University was built with the sweat and
blood of Chinese coolies, Irish immigrants and

Central Valley farmers. Now Stanford is ruled by a
self-perpetuating board of capitalists much like old
Leland Stanford himself. It should be run by the
students, workers and faculty who live and work
here.
Lyman, Provost William Miller, Vice President
Robert Rosensweig and the trustees will not give
us control of our lives; we will have to take it. They
will not end" the Shah's contract (and its millions);
we will have io end it. And they will not restore
the minority aid package; we will have to force
them to restore it.
Out of the struggle will come change. There will
come victories and defeats. There will come new
knowledge and mass education. There will come
love and solidarity. Come to White Plaza today at
12:45 p.m.-JOIN US.

This group was successful, as the recruiters left
without conducting interviews.
Demonstrations work. They bring changes in the
form of concessions, education and a sense of
solidarity among the people.
A look at universities attests to the effectiveness
of demoastrating. Minority programs at campuses
all over America were the direct result of the
militant demonstrations after Martin Luther King's
murder.
At Stanford, the elimination of classified
research, chemical and biological warfare research,
ROTC and ties with Stanford Research Institute
were all the direct result of student protests.
Last month at Brown University a building
takeover brought about an immediate change in
administration policy.
Here, just last week, the mini-sit-in on Lasuen
St. was immediately successful. Those in power
only listen when it is in their interests.
Demonstrations make it in their interest to listen.
Contribute To Larger Struggles
In a less direct fashion demonstrations
contribute to larger struggles. Without a doubt the
anti-war movement had a profound effect not only
on the decisions of Presidents Johnson. Nixon and
Ford but also on the struggling Vietnamese and
Cambodian people.
Khieu Samphan thanked the American people
for their help in his victory speech after the
liberation of Cambodia.
The Vietnamese people have always been very
aware of the "American Front." Events like the El
Camino march and bust of April 1972 were given
extensive coverage on North Vietnamese radios.
Educational Importance
Demonstrations are also very important
educationally. They create an atmosphere in which
people must think about and confront the issues.
For the demonstrator, the response to the
demonstration can be profoundly educational.
A series of protests bring about a climate of
change which leads to other reforms and structural
changes. SWOPSI and SCIRE are two perfect
examples. It is important to note that once the
marching stops, the programs are attacked.
Finally, demonstrations bring the struggle and
its issues to other sectors of society that may not
otherwise have access to alternative viewpoints. For
example, student protests against the Vietnam War

encouraged workers to protest and Gl's to revolt.
Right, Responsibility
We all have the right and the responsibility to
demonstrate. We have the right to demonstrate
because we have the right to reach out and take
control of our own lives. We have the responsibility
because to fail to oppose what is evil, is to condone
it.
Many of us who will demonstrate today have
come to the realization that the oppression of
Vietnamese of Chileans, of Iranians, of blacks, of
chicanos, of women and of workers is our
oppression too.
Not just in the sense that they are our brothers
and sisters but also in the coldly pragmatic
realization that our alienation and oppression

springs from the same system. We must struggle
against it together if we hope to change it.
Real Community
This struggle itself, forges a real community out
of those who struggle together. It often transends
the alienation that is so basic to most people's lives.
We are at Stanford now. It is our community.
And if we don't protest and attempt to change it
when we see it as wrong, we must bear the
responsibility for its actions.
It is not President Lyman's Stanford. It is not
the trustees' Stanford. It is not the Shah's
Stanford. It is not a question of who "owns"
Stanford or under what conditions we came to be
here.
In 1776, when Americans rebelled, it wasn't a
question of who "owned" America or how they
came to be there.
Stanford Rulers
This University was built with the sweat and
blood of Chinese coolies, Irish immigrants and

Central Valley farmers. Now Stanford is ruled by a
self-perpetuating board of capitalists much like old
Leland Stanford himself. It should be run by the
students, workers and faculty who live and work
here.
Lyman, Provost William Miller, Vice President
Robert Rosensweig and the trustees will not give
us control of our lives; we will have to take it. They
will not end" the Shah's contract (and its millions);
we will have io end it. And they will not restore
the minority aid package; we will have to force
them to restore it.
Out of the struggle will come change. There will
come victories and defeats. There will come new
knowledge and mass education. There will come
love and solidarity. Come to White Plaza today at
12:45 p.m.-JOIN US.
