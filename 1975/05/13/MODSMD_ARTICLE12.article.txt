## Wearing Androgeny On Their Earlobes Men's Earrings Have Many Meanings 
### 
By KARKN LACHENAUER
They used to be the hallmark
of pirates, gypsies, and, more
recently, the Hell's Angels.
Today's fashion-conscious
woman wears them, but always
in pairs.
They're also a favorite
ornament of the promenaders on
San Francisco's gayest streets.
In the Stanford area, earrings
on men have special
connotations the earring-wearers
aren't always willing to talk
about.
"A lot of people get their
own meanings out of it, like left
[earlobe | equals gay and right is
'get it on,' " scoffs Chipper, a
cook at a Palo Alto restaurant.
"I don't worry about that kind
of thing.
"I did it for expression —
following the trend of the '70s
which is getting really bizarre,
and picking up on other
cultures: Indian and Native
American."
Dressing Up
Chipper, who says he
moonlights as a "Middle Eastern
dancer," has a collection of
clothes and jewelry. He says he
loves to dress up with sashes and
two to four of his earrings: large
and small hoops, coins, scarabs.

to work at the
Bank of Ameriea'

Chipper's earlobes each have
two holes, about a quarter of an
inch apart. Each hole has a story
behind it.
A fellow passenger on a
schoolbus punched the first hole
five years ago when Chipper was
14. He punched the second one
himself while hitchhiking, for
luck.
Holes number three and four
arrived with a wife; when she

left, the holes remained.
Former LSJUMB drum major
Buzz Thompson was one of the
first Stanford students to pierce
an ear. He opted for a fine gold
wire in his left earlobe during
spring quarter 1971, his
freshman year. He isn't quite
sure why he did it.
"It was a spur of the moment
decision," says Thompson, now
an administrator of the
Volunteers in Asia program. "I
saw someone else with one and I
liked it."
There were only one or two
male earring-wearers besides
Thompson in spring 1971.
Thompson immediately upped
the count by piercing the ears of
two friends. "I guess you could
say they were my disciples," he
explains.
Thompson estimates that 10
to 12 men on campus are now
sporting earrings. But there may
be more. ,
Jose Lovel, a graduate
student in aeronautics, says he
personally knows about 10

earring-wearers, six of them in
the Physics and Statistics
Departments.

i had absolutely
nothing to lose*

Punched 'Between Songs'
David Roth, a
communication major, says two
of his female friends pierced his
ear last fall "between songs" in
the KZSU studios. He says
women give him pierced earrings
when they lose half of a set.
Roth says the motivation
behind his ear piercing was
"almost spiritual." Perhaps it
was inspired by the life style of
his sister, who lives on a farm
without electricity in Marin
County.
"She designs jewelry and her
old man wears an earring," Roth
said. "[Ear piercing) was free. I
had absolutely nothing to loaj.
The idea was that if I didn't like
it I could let [the hole} grow
back."
But Roth liked it. He
habitually sports gold or silver
rings on his left ear.
Advertising Androgyny
There may be an opal, a
butterfly wing, or a turquoise on
the left earlobe of Robb Gilmer,
a communication graduate
student.
"I want to bring out my
androgyny — the female aspect
of my nature — without overt
physical implications," he says.
"It's an enormous fallacy that
men are less emotional than
women."
The hole in his ear is part of a
long-range change of attitude.
"You should have seen me five
years ago," Gilmer says."I was
married, in Escondido Village,
with a wife, wingtips, and short
hair. After a B.A. in poli sci, I
did a year at Harvard Business

School before I realized it wasn't
for me."
Now a filmmaker, Gilmer
says his changing attitudes were
reflected in a progression of
"uniforms" from suits and shoes
to sportscoats and boots, from
slacks and haircuts to jeans and a
beard — and then, a year ago, an
earring.
"I'd really like to wear eye
makeup," he says."I had some
on the other night at a party and
everybody thought it was great."
it's Risque'
Male earring advocates must
learn to deal with public
opinion. Gilmer, a part-time
bartender, says,"From men you
get a discernibly hostile
reaction." But women like it.
"They think it's risque."
Sophomore Linda
Buddenberg thinks earrings on
men are "great, because I can
give away extra earrings. And I
think it's sort of sexy."

i think it's

Most women interviewed for
this article agreed that an earring
alone doesn't make a man
appear more attractive.
"It shows men are more
interested in a different kind of
appearance from before, more
colorful — almost a feminine
attitude toward dressing," says
Robin Davis, a junior.
Gilmer advances a theory that
men in earrings want to be
noticed, due to their insecurity.
Whatever a person wears is a
costume and shows his feelings
about himself, Gilmer says.
Why aren't more men
piercing their ears? "My concern
is the inherent hazard of
physical injury," said MiKe
Decker, a law student. His wife

stopped wearing dangling
earrings after the birth of their
child.
Lovel said he is "too
chicken" to pierce his ears.
Of all local earring wearers.
Chipper seems most oblivious to
public opinion.
"I get stares, but if they
know me, they don't resist what
I am," he shrugs with an other
worldly air. "I'm bisexual, but
I'm beyond man and woman.
I'm not anything and at the
same time, I'm into everything."
It takes a certain kind of man
to wear an earring. "I think it
reveals great independence," a
Palo Altan commented on
Gilmer's earring. "But you have
to be skinny and pretty to carry
it off."
"It's like necklaces or purses;
sexual stereotyping has faded,"
Gilmer responds. "But I
wouldn't wear one to work at
the Bank of America."

One man's earring collection


—Daily photos by Karen Lachenauer
THE EARS HAVE IT- -This man's earring could be a symbol of his
androgeny, his independence, or both. But earring-wearers must be
prepared for a variety of reactions to their ear ornaments.
By KARKN LACHENAUER
They used to be the hallmark
of pirates, gypsies, and, more
recently, the Hell's Angels.
Today's fashion-conscious
woman wears them, but always
in pairs.
They're also a favorite
ornament of the promenaders on
San Francisco's gayest streets.
In the Stanford area, earrings
on men have special
connotations the earring-wearers
aren't always willing to talk
about.
"A lot of people get their
own meanings out of it, like left
[earlobe | equals gay and right is
'get it on,' " scoffs Chipper, a
cook at a Palo Alto restaurant.
"I don't worry about that kind
of thing.
"I did it for expression —
following the trend of the '70s
which is getting really bizarre,
and picking up on other
cultures: Indian and Native
American."
Dressing Up
Chipper, who says he
moonlights as a "Middle Eastern
dancer," has a collection of
clothes and jewelry. He says he
loves to dress up with sashes and
two to four of his earrings: large
and small hoops, coins, scarabs.

i wouldn't wear one
to work at the
Bank of Ameriea'

Chipper's earlobes each have
two holes, about a quarter of an
inch apart. Each hole has a story
behind it.
A fellow passenger on a
schoolbus punched the first hole
five years ago when Chipper was
14. He punched the second one
himself while hitchhiking, for
luck.
Holes number three and four
arrived with a wife; when she

left, the holes remained.
Former LSJUMB drum major
Buzz Thompson was one of the
first Stanford students to pierce
an ear. He opted for a fine gold
wire in his left earlobe during
spring quarter 1971, his
freshman year. He isn't quite
sure why he did it.
"It was a spur of the moment
decision," says Thompson, now
an administrator of the
Volunteers in Asia program. "I
saw someone else with one and I
liked it."
There were only one or two
male earring-wearers besides
Thompson in spring 1971.
Thompson immediately upped
the count by piercing the ears of
two friends. "I guess you could
say they were my disciples," he
explains.
Thompson estimates that 10
to 12 men on campus are now
sporting earrings. But there may
be more. ,
Jose Lovel, a graduate
student in aeronautics, says he
personally knows about 10

earring-wearers, six of them in
the Physics and Statistics
Departments.

i had absolutely
nothing to lose*

Punched 'Between Songs'
David Roth, a
communication major, says two
of his female friends pierced his
ear last fall "between songs" in
the KZSU studios. He says
women give him pierced earrings
when they lose half of a set.
Roth says the motivation
behind his ear piercing was
"almost spiritual." Perhaps it
was inspired by the life style of
his sister, who lives on a farm
without electricity in Marin
County.
"She designs jewelry and her
old man wears an earring," Roth
said. "[Ear piercing) was free. I
had absolutely nothing to loaj.
The idea was that if I didn't like
it I could let [the hole} grow
back."
But Roth liked it. He
habitually sports gold or silver
rings on his left ear.
Advertising Androgyny
There may be an opal, a
butterfly wing, or a turquoise on
the left earlobe of Robb Gilmer,
a communication graduate
student.

androgyny — the female aspect
of my nature — without overt

Dressing Up
Chipper, who says he
moonlights as a "Middle Eastern
dancer," has a collection of
clothes and jewelry. He says he
loves to dress up with sashes and
two to four of his earrings: large
and small hoops, coins, scarabs.

to work at the
Bank of Ameriea'

Chipper's earlobes each have
two holes, about a quarter of an
inch apart. Each hole has a story
behind it.
A fellow passenger on a
schoolbus punched the first hole
five years ago when Chipper was
14. He punched the second one
himself while hitchhiking, for
luck.
Holes number three and four
arrived with a wife; when she

left, the holes remained.
Former LSJUMB drum major
Buzz Thompson was one of the
first Stanford students to pierce
an ear. He opted for a fine gold
wire in his left earlobe during
spring quarter 1971, his
freshman year. He isn't quite
sure why he did it.
"It was a spur of the moment
decision," says Thompson, now
an administrator of the
Volunteers in Asia program. "I
saw someone else with one and I
liked it."
There were only one or two
male earring-wearers besides
Thompson in spring 1971.
Thompson immediately upped
the count by piercing the ears of
two friends. "I guess you could
say they were my disciples," he
explains.
Thompson estimates that 10
to 12 men on campus are now
sporting earrings. But there may
be more. ,
Jose Lovel, a graduate
student in aeronautics, says he
personally knows about 10

earring-wearers, six of them in
the Physics and Statistics
Departments.

nothing to lose*

Punched 'Between Songs'
David Roth, a
communication major, says two
of his female friends pierced his
ear last fall "between songs" in
the KZSU studios. He says
women give him pierced earrings
when they lose half of a set.
Roth says the motivation
behind his ear piercing was
"almost spiritual." Perhaps it
was inspired by the life style of
his sister, who lives on a farm
without electricity in Marin
County.
"She designs jewelry and her
old man wears an earring," Roth
said. "[Ear piercing) was free. I
had absolutely nothing to loaj.
The idea was that if I didn't like
it I could let [the hole} grow
back."
But Roth liked it. He
habitually sports gold or silver
rings on his left ear.
Advertising Androgyny
There may be an opal, a
butterfly wing, or a turquoise on
the left earlobe of Robb Gilmer,
a communication graduate
student.
"I want to bring out my
androgyny — the female aspect
of my nature — without overt
physical implications," he says.
"It's an enormous fallacy that
men are less emotional than
women."
The hole in his ear is part of a
long-range change of attitude.
"You should have seen me five
years ago," Gilmer says."I was
married, in Escondido Village,
with a wife, wingtips, and short
hair. After a B.A. in poli sci, I
did a year at Harvard Business

School before I realized it wasn't
for me."
Now a filmmaker, Gilmer
says his changing attitudes were
reflected in a progression of
"uniforms" from suits and shoes
to sportscoats and boots, from
slacks and haircuts to jeans and a
beard — and then, a year ago, an
earring.
"I'd really like to wear eye
makeup," he says."I had some
on the other night at a party and
everybody thought it was great."
it's Risque'
Male earring advocates must
learn to deal with public
opinion. Gilmer, a part-time
bartender, says,"From men you
get a discernibly hostile
reaction." But women like it.
"They think it's risque."
Sophomore Linda
Buddenberg thinks earrings on
men are "great, because I can
give away extra earrings. And I
think it's sort of sexy."

i think it's

Most women interviewed for
this article agreed that an earring
alone doesn't make a man
appear more attractive.
"It shows men are more
interested in a different kind of
appearance from before, more
colorful — almost a feminine
attitude toward dressing," says
Robin Davis, a junior.
Gilmer advances a theory that
men in earrings want to be
noticed, due to their insecurity.
Whatever a person wears is a
costume and shows his feelings
about himself, Gilmer says.
Why aren't more men
piercing their ears? "My concern
is the inherent hazard of
physical injury," said MiKe
Decker, a law student. His wife

stopped wearing dangling
earrings after the birth of their
child.
Lovel said he is "too
chicken" to pierce his ears.
Of all local earring wearers.
Chipper seems most oblivious to
public opinion.
"I get stares, but if they
know me, they don't resist what
I am," he shrugs with an other
worldly air. "I'm bisexual, but
I'm beyond man and woman.
I'm not anything and at the
same time, I'm into everything."
It takes a certain kind of man
to wear an earring. "I think it
reveals great independence," a
Palo Altan commented on
Gilmer's earring. "But you have
to be skinny and pretty to carry
it off."
"It's like necklaces or purses;
sexual stereotyping has faded,"
Gilmer responds. "But I
wouldn't wear one to work at
the Bank of America."

Now a filmmaker, Gilmer
says his changing attitudes were
reflected in a progression of
"uniforms" from suits and shoes
to sportscoats and boots, from
slacks and haircuts to jeans and a
beard — and then, a year ago, an
earring.
"I'd really like to wear eye
makeup," he says."I had some

everybody thought it was great."

Male earring advocates must
learn to deal with public
opinion. Gilmer, a part-time
bartender, says,"From men you
get a discernibly hostile
reaction." But women like it.
"They think it's risque."

Most women interviewed for
this article agreed that an earring
alone doesn't make a man
appear more attractive.
"It shows men are more
interested in a different kind of
appearance from before, more
colorful — almost a feminine
attitude toward dressing," says

Gilmer's earring. "But you have
to be skinny and pretty to carry
it off."
"It's like necklaces or purses;
sexual stereotyping has faded,"
Gilmer responds. "But I
wouldn't wear one to work at
the Bank of America."
