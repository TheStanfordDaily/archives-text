A few years ago, during a thunderstorm, a
lightning bolt hit Hoover Tower. A concrete ball,
which had been placed on the top of the tower,
plunged down to earth. 1 haven't seen that ball
since. I miss it, for esthetic and for other reasons.
Arc there any plans to put it back? —K.L
Most underclassmen probably do not
remember the 300-pound concrete ball which fell
285 feet from the top of Hoover Tower on Dec.
2, 1970. According to the Dec. 3 Daily, the ball,
struck by lightning at approximately 6:30 a.m.,
made a six-inch impact hole, with pieces flying
over 50 feet.
"It was rumored that several yo>:ng males were
fighting for souvenir pieces of the famed phallic
symbol," the Daily reported.
Principal Project Planner Gene Kershner said
that there were no plans to replace the ball,

although it was part of the original design for the
building. "We barely even discussed it in this
office except from a humorous standpoint," he
said. "It would be a very expensive thing to do, as
you can imagine, and not at all necessary."

Who is Ken Lilly, the man whom the Sunken
Diamond scoreboard is named after? —M.D.H.
The Sports Information Office calls Lilly "one
of Stanford's greatest all-time athletes." He won
eight varsity letters in four sports, three of them
in baseball, and was one of the original members
of the Stanford Sports Hall of Fame.
The Daily's predecessor, the Daily Palo Alto,
called Lilly a fielder "of the first water" and "a
soid |sic| hitter" in its issue of March 13, 1918.
"In center, Lilly brought the bleacherites out of
their shells with beautiful catches," it said.
