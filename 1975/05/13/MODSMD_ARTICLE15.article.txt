# Survey Shows:
## Shyness Not Unusual 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
If you're shy, you're not alone in the world.
Forty percent of the nearly 3000 people surveyed
considered themselves shy, according to early
res"lts of studies done by a Stanford research
group headed by Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimbardo.
Most shy people regard shyness as undesirable
and often describe it as a personal "problem" of
serious proportions, the research shows.
"On the other hand," Zimbardo says, "a team
of American developmental psychologists who
recently visited mainland China have reported to
us observing no shy children among the thousands
they saw in schools, nurseries and child care
centers."
Group Success
The Chinese "ideal is group success. There is
no emphasis on the ego of the individual. . . the
Chinese youngster is subordinate to the group,"
says Zimbardo.
"Our culture emphasizes individuality,
individual achievement and success. Once you
have a concept of success, you have to have
another of failure. So you're always concerned
about failing. Shyness may be better understood
as a social pathology which is a product of our
cultural values rather than an individual
pathology."
The research on shyness began here about 18
months ago, according to Paul Pilkonis, a Ph.D.
candidate in psychology who is working with
Zimbardo on the project.
Last spring quarter, he and Zimbardo taught a
shyness seminar. Afterwards, the students in

various psychology classes filled out shyness
questionnaires.
Pilkonis says that last quarter, researchers put
their subjects in experimental settings and
situations, and now the results from the
experiments are being compiled.
"Part of what we are finding is a difference in
actual social behavior and a difference in
self-labeling behavior," Pilkonis says. "Half the
undergraduates here are saying, 'Listen, I'm a shy
person.' " Shyness is just not that unusual, he
says.
Many people feel bashful when meeting new
people or dealing with a new situation, he
explains, adding that the difference between a shy
person and a confident person is how each thinks
about himself.
'Shyness Clinic'
The researchers plan to do more work which
may lead to the development of a "shyness
clinic" where shy students may go for help,
Pilkonis says. The assertiveness training program
would allow students to participate in
role-playing games, he says. Afterwards, they
would be able to hear their voices played back on
video tape.
"Let's practice that. Let's rehearse the scene
together," says Pilkonis. "First it sounds like a
cookbook, you know — first do this, then do this
and this."
However, he says, "After you start doing
things appropriately, you'll gain more confidence
and eventually you will have confidence."

The researchers plan to do more work which
may lead to the development of a "shyness
clinic" where shy students may go for help,
Pilkonis says. The assertiveness training program
would allow students to participate in
role-playing games, he says. Afterwards, they
would be able to hear their voices played back on
video tape.
"Let's practice that. Let's rehearse the scene
together," says Pilkonis. "First it sounds like a
cookbook, you know — first do this, then do this
and this."
However, he says, "After you start doing
things appropriately, you'll gain more confidence
and eventually you will have confidence."
If you're shy, you're not alone in the world.
Forty percent of the nearly 3000 people surveyed
considered themselves shy, according to early
res"lts of studies done by a Stanford research
group headed by Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimbardo.
Most shy people regard shyness as undesirable
and often describe it as a personal "problem" of
serious proportions, the research shows.
"On the other hand," Zimbardo says, "a team
of American developmental psychologists who
recently visited mainland China have reported to
us observing no shy children among the thousands
they saw in schools, nurseries and child care
centers."
Group Success
The Chinese "ideal is group success. There is
no emphasis on the ego of the individual. . . the
Chinese youngster is subordinate to the group,"
says Zimbardo.
"Our culture emphasizes individuality,
individual achievement and success. Once you
have a concept of success, you have to have
another of failure. So you're always concerned
about failing. Shyness may be better understood
as a social pathology which is a product of our
cultural values rather than an individual
pathology."
The research on shyness began here about 18
months ago, according to Paul Pilkonis, a Ph.D.
candidate in psychology who is working with
Zimbardo on the project.
Last spring quarter, he and Zimbardo taught a
shyness seminar. Afterwards, the students in

various psychology classes filled out shyness
questionnaires.
Pilkonis says that last quarter, researchers put
their subjects in experimental settings and
situations, and now the results from the
experiments are being compiled.
"Part of what we are finding is a difference in
actual social behavior and a difference in
self-labeling behavior," Pilkonis says. "Half the
undergraduates here are saying, 'Listen, I'm a shy
person.' " Shyness is just not that unusual, he
says.
Many people feel bashful when meeting new
people or dealing with a new situation, he
explains, adding that the difference between a shy
person and a confident person is how each thinks
about himself.
