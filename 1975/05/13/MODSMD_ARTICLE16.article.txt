## 'Mammy's Town' World Premieres Tonight THEATER 
### 
Billed as a "San Francisco
legend on stage at Stanford," the
new musical Mammy's Town
makes its world premier tonight
at 8 p m. in Memorial Aud
Adding its contribution to
the Bicentennial celebrations,
Mammy's Town centers on
the life of Mary Ellen Pleasant, a
black woman who in 1819
virtually took over San
Francisco.
Known as a voodoo queen,
black freedom fighter, bordello
operator, business wizard,
gourmet cook, blackmailer, and
murderess "Mammy," as she
came to be called, was originally
a slave in Georgia.
As the story goes, she was
sent at an early age by a kindly
master to be educated in Boston,
where she met and married
Alexander Smith, a plantation
owner and dedicated
abolitionist.
Later, Mammy came to be
known as a freedom fighter.
Legend links her with John
Brown and his famous raid at
Harper's Ferry. As the story
continues, she met with Brown
in Chatham, Canada in 1858 to
give him $30,000 for the cause.
When Brown was captured,
they found a hand-written note
on him which said, "The ax is
laid at the foot of the tree. When
the first blow is struck, there
will be more money to help."
The note was signed "W.E.P."
and Mammy fans claim that the
"W" was misread, and the
initials really stood for Mary
Ellen Pleasant.
Aside from her association
with Brown, many of Mammy's
paths to power were devious. At
first she capitalized on her skill
as a gourmet cook to hire herself
out as a housekeeper in a

wealthy bachelor establishment.
Soon she owned her own
boarding-houses and kept careful
track of the personal and
financial affairs of her clients.
The knowledge which she
acquired while waiting on the
tables of the wealthy helped her
to make shrewd investments in

the most prosperous mines.
Mammy also led a successful
campaign to place blacks in
household jobs where they were
free to eavesdrop.
She also capitalized on the
miners' desperate need for
women — the 1840 census
registered only seven women in
San Francisco. Cunningly
assuming that any single woman
arriving in the wild West must be
leaving a past behind her, she
offered many stray women

protection and a haven. Gaining
power over them by prying into
their secrets, she then married
them off to rising young men in
the community over whom she
wished to establish a hold.
Mammy's career also
entangled one of the more
scandalous incidents in San
Francisco history. Mammy was
associated with Sarah Althea Hill
who shocked the city by
claiming to be the wife of
William Sharon, the recently

elected U.S. senator and by
producing a document to prove
it. During the state court trial,
which Sarah Althea won, and
the federal circuit court trial,
which she lost. Mammy took the
stand six times in behalf of her
protegee. In his decision, the
federal judge blamed Mammy
for the whole affair. "This case,
and the forgeries and perjuries
committed in its support, have
their origin largely in the brain
of this scheming, trafficking,

crafty old woman."
A biographical sketch about
Mammy in the Oct. 13, 1895
issue of The San Francisco
Examiner gives a clear
impression of the mystery which
surrounded her. It also reflects
the racial attitudes against which
she had to fight in making a
place for herself. The article
read: "It may appear rather
strange that this retiring woman,
who seems to take something of
a pride in the fact that she was
born of an alien race, should be
referred to as a social power. Yet
such has been her sway that she
has been as a Warwick behind
the thrones of the socially
great."
The music for Mammy's
Town has been written by Harry
Booker, the songwriter for
Stevie Wonder and Eddie
Kend ricks. Directed by
Stanford's John Cochran, the
Drama Department production
features a multi-ethnic cast. The
book and lyrics were written by
Los Altos playwright Elizabeth
Means.
Mammy Pleasant's story is
obviously a fascinating one,
surrounding much of the history
of San Francisco during the
exciting gold rush era. As for the
play, with this background
information anyone can write
his own review. The world
premiere is tonight and the
critics are anxious to see how
well this fascinating story comes
across. As Mammy described her
secret back in the 1850s "a
knowledge of men and the
world, that is it. You will find
such knowledge much more
advantageousin the end than all
the book-learning you ever
knew."

sent at an early age by a kindly
master to be educated in Boston,
where she met and married
Alexander Smith, a plantation
owner and dedicated
abolitionist.
Later, Mammy came to be
known as a freedom fighter.
Legend links her with John
Brown and his famous raid at
Harper's Ferry. As the story
continues, she met with Brown
in Chatham, Canada in 1858 to
give him $30,000 for the cause.
When Brown was captured,
they found a hand-written note
on him which said, "The ax is
laid at the foot of the tree. When
the first blow is struck, there
will be more money to help."
The note was signed "W.E.P."
and Mammy fans claim that the
"W" was misread, and the
initials really stood for Mary
Ellen Pleasant.
Aside from her association
with Brown, many of Mammy's
paths to power were devious. At
first she capitalized on her skill
as a gourmet cook to hire herself
out as a housekeeper in a

wealthy bachelor establishment.
Soon she owned her own
boarding-houses and kept careful
track of the personal and
financial affairs of her clients.
The knowledge which she
acquired while waiting on the
tables of the wealthy helped her
to make shrewd investments in

the most prosperous mines.
Mammy also led a successful
campaign to place blacks in
household jobs where they were
free to eavesdrop.
She also capitalized on the
miners' desperate need for
women — the 1840 census
registered only seven women in
San Francisco. Cunningly
assuming that any single woman
arriving in the wild West must be
leaving a past behind her, she
offered many stray women

protection and a haven. Gaining
power over them by prying into
their secrets, she then married
them off to rising young men in
the community over whom she
wished to establish a hold.
Mammy's career also
entangled one of the more
scandalous incidents in San
Francisco history. Mammy was
associated with Sarah Althea Hill
who shocked the city by
claiming to be the wife of
William Sharon, the recently

elected U.S. senator and by
producing a document to prove
it. During the state court trial,
which Sarah Althea won, and
the federal circuit court trial,
which she lost. Mammy took the
stand six times in behalf of her
protegee. In his decision, the
federal judge blamed Mammy
for the whole affair. "This case,
and the forgeries and perjuries
committed in its support, have
their origin largely in the brain
of this scheming, trafficking,

crafty old woman."
A biographical sketch about
Mammy in the Oct. 13, 1895
issue of The San Francisco
Examiner gives a clear
impression of the mystery which
surrounded her. It also reflects
the racial attitudes against which
she had to fight in making a
place for herself. The article
read: "It may appear rather
strange that this retiring woman,
who seems to take something of
a pride in the fact that she was
born of an alien race, should be
referred to as a social power. Yet
such has been her sway that she
has been as a Warwick behind
the thrones of the socially
great."
The music for Mammy's
Town has been written by Harry
Booker, the songwriter for
Stevie Wonder and Eddie
Kend ricks. Directed by
Stanford's John Cochran, the
Drama Department production
features a multi-ethnic cast. The
book and lyrics were written by
Los Altos playwright Elizabeth
Means.
Mammy Pleasant's story is
obviously a fascinating one,
surrounding much of the history
of San Francisco during the
exciting gold rush era. As for the
play, with this background
information anyone can write
his own review. The world
premiere is tonight and the
critics are anxious to see how
well this fascinating story comes
across. As Mammy described her
secret back in the 1850s "a
knowledge of men and the
world, that is it. You will find
such knowledge much more
advantageousin the end than all
the book-learning you ever
knew."

The note was signed "W.E.P."
and Mammy fans claim that the
"W" was misread, and the
initials really stood for Mary
Ellen Pleasant.
Aside from her association
with Brown, many of Mammy's
paths to power were devious. At
first she capitalized on her skill
as a gourmet cook to hire herself
out as a housekeeper in a

wealthy bachelor establishment.
Soon she owned her own
boarding-houses and kept careful
track of the personal and
financial affairs of her clients.
The knowledge which she
acquired while waiting on the
tables of the wealthy helped her
to make shrewd investments in

the most prosperous mines.
Mammy also led a successful
campaign to place blacks in
household jobs where they were
free to eavesdrop.
She also capitalized on the
miners' desperate need for
women — the 1840 census
registered only seven women in
San Francisco. Cunningly
assuming that any single woman
arriving in the wild West must be
leaving a past behind her, she
offered many stray women

protection and a haven. Gaining
power over them by prying into
their secrets, she then married
them off to rising young men in
the community over whom she
wished to establish a hold.
Mammy's career also
entangled one of the more
scandalous incidents in San
Francisco history. Mammy was
associated with Sarah Althea Hill
who shocked the city by
claiming to be the wife of
William Sharon, the recently

elected U.S. senator and by
producing a document to prove
it. During the state court trial,
which Sarah Althea won, and
the federal circuit court trial,
which she lost. Mammy took the
stand six times in behalf of her
protegee. In his decision, the
federal judge blamed Mammy
for the whole affair. "This case,
and the forgeries and perjuries
committed in its support, have
their origin largely in the brain
of this scheming, trafficking,

crafty old woman."
A biographical sketch about
Mammy in the Oct. 13, 1895
issue of The San Francisco
Examiner gives a clear
impression of the mystery which
surrounded her. It also reflects
the racial attitudes against which
she had to fight in making a
place for herself. The article
read: "It may appear rather
strange that this retiring woman,
who seems to take something of
a pride in the fact that she was
born of an alien race, should be
referred to as a social power. Yet
such has been her sway that she
has been as a Warwick behind
the thrones of the socially
great."
The music for Mammy's
Town has been written by Harry
Booker, the songwriter for
Stevie Wonder and Eddie
Kend ricks. Directed by
Stanford's John Cochran, the
Drama Department production
features a multi-ethnic cast. The
book and lyrics were written by
Los Altos playwright Elizabeth
Means.
Mammy Pleasant's story is
obviously a fascinating one,
surrounding much of the history
of San Francisco during the
exciting gold rush era. As for the
play, with this background
information anyone can write
his own review. The world
premiere is tonight and the
critics are anxious to see how
well this fascinating story comes
across. As Mammy described her
secret back in the 1850s "a
knowledge of men and the
world, that is it. You will find
such knowledge much more
advantageousin the end than all
the book-learning you ever
knew."

MAMMY'S MEN—William Willmore (Mervyn Greene, left) and Buck Brown (Doug Green) are
baffled by the mysteries of Mammy and one of her protegees. The Stanford Drama Department
production of "Mammy's Town" will be presented at 8 p.m. May 13-17, 20-24 in Memorial
Auditorium.
Billed as a "San Francisco
legend on stage at Stanford," the
new musical Mammy's Town
makes its world premier tonight
at 8 p m. in Memorial Aud
Adding its contribution to
the Bicentennial celebrations,
Mammy's Town centers on
the life of Mary Ellen Pleasant, a
black woman who in 1819
virtually took over San
Francisco.
Known as a voodoo queen,
black freedom fighter, bordello
operator, business wizard,
gourmet cook, blackmailer, and
murderess "Mammy," as she
came to be called, was originally
a slave in Georgia.
As the story goes, she was
sent at an early age by a kindly
master to be educated in Boston,
where she met and married
Alexander Smith, a plantation
owner and dedicated
abolitionist.
Later, Mammy came to be
known as a freedom fighter.
Legend links her with John
Brown and his famous raid at
Harper's Ferry. As the story
continues, she met with Brown
in Chatham, Canada in 1858 to
give him $30,000 for the cause.
When Brown was captured,
they found a hand-written note
on him which said, "The ax is
laid at the foot of the tree. When
the first blow is struck, there
will be more money to help."
The note was signed "W.E.P."
and Mammy fans claim that the
"W" was misread, and the
initials really stood for Mary
Ellen Pleasant.
