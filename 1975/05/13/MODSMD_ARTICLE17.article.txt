# Wed. Night At Lambda Nu
## Dave Alexander: Blues Of Today MUSIC 
### 
Dave Alexander, aside from
being one of the most adept
pianists on the Bay Area scene,
is possibly the most innovative
performer currently playing
blues.
If the above statement sets
off a skeptical alarm inside your
head and you ask "Why, then,
haven't I heard of him?", well,
that's just the type of irony
Alexander has been dealing with
for most of his life.

In a business that rewards
jive, showmanship and
gimmicks, Alexander has
continually poured out nothing
but real music, with a degree of
craftsmanship that only. 20 years
as a professional pianist could
account for. While record
companies demand overnight
"hits," Alexander has composed
a portfolio of classics which no
one even glances at.
At 37, it has only been in the

past four years that Alexander
has received any notice from the
media. Numerous articles have
appeared in small-time blues
publications praising the
"newcomer," The San Francisco
Chronicle has nearly recounted
his complete life story. And
Calif orn ia Living recen tl y
dubbed Alexander the "best
known unknown pianist."
Alexander now has two LP's
on the market, both on the
Arhoolie label. But, admittedly,
the Berkeley-based operation
can do little to help Alexander
reach a large audience — "they
just don't have the distribution,"
says Alexander. As he waits for
offers from established
companies, Alexander's
portfolio of original
compositions continues to grow
and improve.
While most blues being
recorded today continues to
feed off the staple subjects —
whiskey, women and money —
which have kept it going since
the beginning, Alexander's blues
tell of what is happening today:
In this house there's a TV set,
showing pictures of dyin' crops,
and children that ain't got any
shoes.
This is the house that was
built by the blues.
or about his own brother being
beaten to death by East Bay
junkies:
Where were you when the
ravens rapped and tapped on my
window pane ?
Where were you when blood

fell in the streets just like rain?
But, Alexander's tunes aren't
only outstanding lyrically;
musically, he has managed to
put his years as a backup
musician and dinner pianist to
good use. Elements borrowed
from boogie woogie, rock 4 n'
roll, gospel, soul and jazz from
swing right through to modern
can all be detected in a single
Alexander performance.
"The Hoodoo Man" is based
on Horace Silver's "Senor
Blues"; "The Day the Ravens
Danced in the Streets" turns
Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata"
into one of the most disturbing,
personal blues written in
decades. It is just one of dozens
of Alexander's numbers which
has not yet reached wax.
All this has, understandably,
made Alexander somewhat
bitter, both over the music
business and the establishment
as a whole. He openly disdains
today's AM-programmed rock
music and the use of electronics.
He finds it absurd that a rock
star can "learn four changes"
and make thousands of dollars!
while he is still "scufflin' for
gigs."
Along with his bitterness,
though, Alexander is a very
determined man. And, although
he may still be scuffling, the gigs
are gradually getting bigger. He
has recently moved into a new
circuit which includes The
Boarding House, the Berkeley
Blues Festival, and at long last
Winterland, where he was

booked last January on a bill
with Bobby "Blue" Bland and
8.8. King. As he told the
audience that night, "I'm in the
midst of the gods." That one gig
probably gave Alexander as
much exposure as both his
Arhoolie albums put together.
But, his home is still at
Minnie's Can-Do, at its new
location of 1725 llaight St. in
The City, where he and his trio
perform every Friday and
Saturday (when he doesn't have
conflicting gigs). Another major
gig is coming up May 9-10 at
Keystone Berkeley, where
Alexander will gladly play
warm-up to the legendary
Muddy Waters.

And on Wednesday, May 14,
Alexander will bring his
craftsmanship to Stanford, in
Lambda Nu, as part of "The
History of the Blues.'' The set
wilt begin at 7:30. and admission
is $1.

decades. It is just one of dozens
of Alexander's numbers which
has not yet reached wax.
All this has, understandably,
made Alexander somewhat
bitter, both over the music
business and the establishment
as a whole. He openly disdains
today's AM-programmed rock
music and the use of electronics.
He finds it absurd that a rock
star can "learn four changes"
and make thousands of dollars!
while he is still "scufflin' for
gigs."
Along with his bitterness,
though, Alexander is a very
determined man. And, although
he may still be scuffling, the gigs
are gradually getting bigger. He
has recently moved into a new
circuit which includes The
Boarding House, the Berkeley
Blues Festival, and at long last
Winterland, where he was

booked last January on a bill
with Bobby "Blue" Bland and
8.8. King. As he told the
audience that night, "I'm in the
midst of the gods." That one gig
probably gave Alexander as
much exposure as both his
Arhoolie albums put together.
But, his home is still at
Minnie's Can-Do, at its new
location of 1725 llaight St. in
The City, where he and his trio
perform every Friday and
Saturday (when he doesn't have
conflicting gigs). Another major
gig is coming up May 9-10 at
Keystone Berkeley, where
Alexander will gladly play
warm-up to the legendary
Muddy Waters.

And on Wednesday, May 14,
Alexander will bring his
craftsmanship to Stanford, in
Lambda Nu, as part of "The
History of the Blues.'' The set
wilt begin at 7:30. and admission
is $1.

READY FOR REDDY -From a reception for the Queen of
England, where she danced with Ambassador Elliot Richardson,
Helen Reddy will soon be on her way to Stanford. Sunday,
May 25 at 2 p.m., Reddy along with Peter Allen, will entertain
at Frost Amphitheater.
Dave Alexander, aside from
being one of the most adept
pianists on the Bay Area scene,
is possibly the most innovative
performer currently playing
blues.
If the above statement sets
off a skeptical alarm inside your
head and you ask "Why, then,
haven't I heard of him?", well,
that's just the type of irony
Alexander has been dealing with
for most of his life.

In a business that rewards
jive, showmanship and
gimmicks, Alexander has
continually poured out nothing
but real music, with a degree of
craftsmanship that only. 20 years
as a professional pianist could
account for. While record
companies demand overnight
"hits," Alexander has composed
a portfolio of classics which no
one even glances at.
At 37, it has only been in the

past four years that Alexander
has received any notice from the
media. Numerous articles have
appeared in small-time blues
publications praising the
"newcomer," The San Francisco
Chronicle has nearly recounted
his complete life story. And
Calif orn ia Living recen tl y
dubbed Alexander the "best
known unknown pianist."
Alexander now has two LP's
on the market, both on the
Arhoolie label. But, admittedly,
the Berkeley-based operation
can do little to help Alexander
reach a large audience — "they
just don't have the distribution,"
says Alexander. As he waits for
offers from established
companies, Alexander's
portfolio of original
compositions continues to grow
and improve.
While most blues being
recorded today continues to
feed off the staple subjects —
whiskey, women and money —
which have kept it going since
the beginning, Alexander's blues
tell of what is happening today:
In this house there's a TV set,
showing pictures of dyin' crops,
and children that ain't got any
shoes.
This is the house that was
built by the blues.
or about his own brother being
beaten to death by East Bay
junkies:
Where were you when the
ravens rapped and tapped on my
window pane ?
Where were you when blood

fell in the streets just like rain?
But, Alexander's tunes aren't
only outstanding lyrically;
musically, he has managed to
put his years as a backup
musician and dinner pianist to
good use. Elements borrowed
from boogie woogie, rock 4 n'
roll, gospel, soul and jazz from
swing right through to modern
can all be detected in a single
Alexander performance.
"The Hoodoo Man" is based
on Horace Silver's "Senor
Blues"; "The Day the Ravens
Danced in the Streets" turns
Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata"
into one of the most disturbing,
personal blues written in
decades. It is just one of dozens
of Alexander's numbers which
has not yet reached wax.

one even glances at.
At 37, it has only been in the

past four years that Alexander
has received any notice from the
media. Numerous articles have
appeared in small-time blues
publications praising the
"newcomer," The San Francisco
Chronicle has nearly recounted
his complete life story. And
Calif orn ia Living recen tl y
dubbed Alexander the "best
known unknown pianist."
Alexander now has two LP's
on the market, both on the
Arhoolie label. But, admittedly,
the Berkeley-based operation
can do little to help Alexander
reach a large audience — "they
just don't have the distribution,"
says Alexander. As he waits for
offers from established
companies, Alexander's
portfolio of original
compositions continues to grow
and improve.
While most blues being
recorded today continues to
feed off the staple subjects —
whiskey, women and money —
which have kept it going since
the beginning, Alexander's blues
tell of what is happening today:
In this house there's a TV set,
showing pictures of dyin' crops,
and children that ain't got any
shoes.
This is the house that was
built by the blues.
or about his own brother being
beaten to death by East Bay
junkies:
Where were you when the
ravens rapped and tapped on my
window pane ?
Where were you when blood

fell in the streets just like rain?
But, Alexander's tunes aren't
only outstanding lyrically;
musically, he has managed to
put his years as a backup
musician and dinner pianist to
good use. Elements borrowed
from boogie woogie, rock 4 n'
roll, gospel, soul and jazz from
swing right through to modern
can all be detected in a single
Alexander performance.
"The Hoodoo Man" is based
on Horace Silver's "Senor
Blues"; "The Day the Ravens
Danced in the Streets" turns
Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata"
into one of the most disturbing,
personal blues written in
decades. It is just one of dozens
of Alexander's numbers which
has not yet reached wax.
All this has, understandably,
made Alexander somewhat
bitter, both over the music
business and the establishment
as a whole. He openly disdains
today's AM-programmed rock
music and the use of electronics.
He finds it absurd that a rock
star can "learn four changes"
and make thousands of dollars!
while he is still "scufflin' for
gigs."
Along with his bitterness,
though, Alexander is a very
determined man. And, although
he may still be scuffling, the gigs
are gradually getting bigger. He
has recently moved into a new
circuit which includes The
Boarding House, the Berkeley
Blues Festival, and at long last
Winterland, where he was

booked last January on a bill
with Bobby "Blue" Bland and
8.8. King. As he told the
audience that night, "I'm in the
midst of the gods." That one gig
probably gave Alexander as
much exposure as both his
Arhoolie albums put together.
But, his home is still at
Minnie's Can-Do, at its new
location of 1725 llaight St. in
The City, where he and his trio
perform every Friday and
Saturday (when he doesn't have
conflicting gigs). Another major
gig is coming up May 9-10 at
Keystone Berkeley, where
Alexander will gladly play
warm-up to the legendary
Muddy Waters.

And on Wednesday, May 14,
Alexander will bring his
craftsmanship to Stanford, in
Lambda Nu, as part of "The
History of the Blues.'' The set
wilt begin at 7:30. and admission
is $1.
