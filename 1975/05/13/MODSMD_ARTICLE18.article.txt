# Take Two
## 'Shampoo': Beatty Rinses The Press CINEMA 
### 
When one thinks of Warren
Beatty, one thinks of "Bonnie
and Clyde ," passing over some
of his more recent but less
colorful releases — $, The
Parallax View and McCabe
and Mrs. Miller (a rare sort of
film that managed to appear on
both Ten Best and Ten Worst
lists of 1971).
But the times are a-changing,
for Warren Beatty has come out
with a film that will knock
Bonnie and Clyde right off its
pedestal as his most talked-about
film. The next best thing to
having a great movie is having a
controversial movie.
1 do not disguise the fact that
1 did not like Shampoo but
the mere fact that some
reviewers consider it solid gold
and others consider it solid dust

is going to make it talked about.
Some San Francisco movie
reviewers, a few with
photographers, met with Warren
Beatty last week at the Hyatt
Union Squari' to speak some of
the first words about
"Shampoo." It was the
afternoon following the
screening of the movie for
journalists, which began with
some of us still in the lobby.
The sound was distorted
occasionally (Beatty was very
upset about this and attributed
it to a 95-year-old projectionist)
but we struggled through it.
Anyway, Beatty showed up at
the press conference about 15
minutes late, quietly exuding
charm — no sarcasm intended.
Expecting a rather brassy,
egotistical person bragging about
his achievements (whether they
are is debatable) as a writer,
producer and actor, 1 was
surprised by the short (like
Newman and Redford, about 5-
foot-10, soft-spoken, even shy
man dressed informally in a shirt
and sport jacket.
He walked over to the desk in
front of the tiny room and said
quietly to the publicity man
from Columbia. "Is this for me?
A microphone 1 ?" as if
to say,"what the hell do I need a
microphone for in a closet this
size?"
He sat down and looked at
the journalists; the journalists
looked at him for a few silent
seconds. One of us broke the ice
by saying to Beatty, "What

would you like to ask us?"
We discussed Beatty's past,
present and future movies, his
political ambitions (none
whatsoever beyond working for
the Democratic candidate in
1976) and his Shampoo
co-workers. I shied away from
asking about Shampoo
because he admitted that he
thought it was very good, and
others in the room who shared
my opinion were equally tactful.
Instead, I geared my
questions to what was ahead —
The Fortune, with Jack
Nicholson.
"I really shouldn't tell you,
but it's about two schmucks
who go after the heiress to a
sanitary napkin fortune," he said
playfully.
m m m m m m■■■■■■■

Warren Beatty has a
wonderful sense of humor, and
made the affair very comfortable
rather than stilted. When the
Columbia man called time on us,
Beatty demanded 15 more
minutes to make up for the time
he was late.
He was very complimentary
toward his collaborators and
co-workers, Robert Towne and
Hal Ashby, as well as his
ex-girlfriend. Julie Christie,
whom he termed the "best thing
on screen."
Oddlv enough, Beatty had
the idea for Shampoo in
1966, and it has taken him this
long to get it onto celluloid. It
looks as though, after a string of
turkeys, ol' Clyde Barrow will be
gunning them down again.

The Fortune, with Jack
Nicholson.
"I really shouldn't tell you,
but it's about two schmucks
who go after the heiress to a
sanitary napkin fortune," he said

Warren Beatty has a
wonderful sense of humor, and
made the affair very comfortable
rather than stilted. When the
Columbia man called time on us,
Beatty demanded 15 more
minutes to make up for the time
he was late.
He was very complimentary
toward his collaborators and
co-workers, Robert Towne and
Hal Ashby, as well as his
ex-girlfriend. Julie Christie,
whom he termed the "best thing
on screen."
Oddlv enough, Beatty had
the idea for Shampoo in
1966, and it has taken him this
long to get it onto celluloid. It
looks as though, after a string of
turkeys, ol' Clyde Barrow will be
gunning them down again.

When one thinks of Warren
Beatty, one thinks of "Bonnie
and Clyde ," passing over some
of his more recent but less
colorful releases — $, The
Parallax View and McCabe
and Mrs. Miller (a rare sort of
film that managed to appear on
both Ten Best and Ten Worst
lists of 1971).
But the times are a-changing,
for Warren Beatty has come out
with a film that will knock
Bonnie and Clyde right off its
pedestal as his most talked-about
film. The next best thing to
having a great movie is having a
controversial movie.
1 do not disguise the fact that
1 did not like Shampoo but
the mere fact that some
reviewers consider it solid gold
and others consider it solid dust

is going to make it talked about.
Some San Francisco movie
reviewers, a few with
photographers, met with Warren
Beatty last week at the Hyatt
Union Squari' to speak some of
the first words about
"Shampoo." It was the
afternoon following the
screening of the movie for
journalists, which began with
some of us still in the lobby.
The sound was distorted
occasionally (Beatty was very
upset about this and attributed
it to a 95-year-old projectionist)
but we struggled through it.
Anyway, Beatty showed up at
the press conference about 15
minutes late, quietly exuding
charm — no sarcasm intended.
Expecting a rather brassy,
egotistical person bragging about
his achievements (whether they
are is debatable) as a writer,
producer and actor, 1 was
surprised by the short (like
Newman and Redford, about 5-
foot-10, soft-spoken, even shy
man dressed informally in a shirt
and sport jacket.
He walked over to the desk in
front of the tiny room and said
quietly to the publicity man
from Columbia. "Is this for me?
A microphone 1 ?" as if
to say,"what the hell do I need a
microphone for in a closet this
size?"
He sat down and looked at
the journalists; the journalists
looked at him for a few silent
seconds. One of us broke the ice
by saying to Beatty, "What

would you like to ask us?"
We discussed Beatty's past,
present and future movies, his
political ambitions (none
whatsoever beyond working for
the Democratic candidate in
1976) and his Shampoo
co-workers. I shied away from
asking about Shampoo
because he admitted that he
thought it was very good, and
others in the room who shared
my opinion were equally tactful.
Instead, I geared my
questions to what was ahead —
The Fortune, with Jack
Nicholson.
"I really shouldn't tell you,
