Cambodians Sieze U.S. Merchant Ship
A Cambodian navy vessel fired on and seized a U.S.
merchant ship and its crew of 39 yesterday in the Gulf of
Thailand, the White House reported.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said President
Ford considered the incident "an act of piracy" and
ordered the State Department to demand immediate
release of the ship. "Failure to do so," he said, "would
have the most serious consequences."
State Department spokesmen saicl immediate steps
would involve "diplomatic and not military initiatives."
But some warships of the U.S. 7th Fleet that had
assembled for the evacuation of South Vietnamese
refugees after the fall of Saigon reportedly were directed
to head for the area.
The seizure brought congressional protests. Sen. John
Sparkman (D-Ala.) said, "We ought to go after it. We
ought to go after it. We should get that ship back . . . any
way that we can." Ohio Republican Sen. Robert Taft told
newsmen Washington "Should take all kinds of sanctions
first ... but that doesn't mean ruling out retaking it. We
can't allow thai kind thing to happen on the high seas."
Doctors* Malpractice Strike Spreads
SAN FRANCISCO — The doctors' protest over
skyrocKeting malpractice rates gained momentum
yesterday as physicians from three more Northern
California counties refused to perform all but emergency
surgery.
More than 90 anesthesiologists and an unknown
number of surgeons in Santa Clara, San Mateo and Santa
Cruz counties joined in the boycott begun May 1 by
colleagues in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Sacramento County physicians also threatened to walk
off their jobs May 19, and members of the Los Angeles
County Medical Association are reportedly considering a
boycott of hospitals over a 200-mile stretch from the
Mexican border to the Tehachapi mountains.
'Emergency' In South Korea
SEOUL, South Korea — President Chung Hee Park,
worried about Communist victories in Indochina, is
moving South Korea toward what the government calls a
"total security posture" or a "wartime emergency
system."
Park, who rules with unlimited power form a 1972
constitution written to cope with an alleged imminent
threat from North Korea, has often been accused of
overplaying the issue of national security for his own
political purposes. Now, however, he is getting support for
his claim that Sou»h Korea's national security is more
seriously threatened than at any time since the 1953
Korean armistice.
The U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and
Cambodia has caused a crisis mood among South Koreans.
Tens of thousands of citizens turn out daily for rallies
across the country intended to support Park's views.
In a national broadcast on April 29, Park said it was
not the time to debate whether there was serious danger
from the North but the time to take concrete steps
promptly against such a possibility.
Increased Gas Taxes Proposed
WASHINGTON — A proposed flexible oil import
quota program survived another test yesterday as the
House Ways and Means Committee began its final voting
on an energy tax bill designed to punish waste and reward
conservation.
The bill would boost the federal tax on gasoline by as
much as 23 cents a gallon, create quotas and new duties

on imported petroleum, tax gas-guzzling new cars if
automakers fail to meet mileage efficiency standards, tax
some industrial and business use of petroleum and natural
gas, set up a trust fund to encourage developing new
energy sources, and give personal tax cuts to Americans
who install energy-conserving home insulation.
The major dispute to be resolved by the committee
centered on features which would increase the present
four-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax, with a
three-cents-a-gallon increase next year to be followed in
1977 by a boost of up to 20 cents a gallon.
This added 20 cents a gallon would apply if
conservation efforts fail to curb the nation's gasoline
consumption during 1976 compared to the 1973 record
level. However, there would be a special refund system
returning to taxpayers much of the money which would
be raised through this feature.
Two Boston Schools May Close
BOSTON — U.S. District Court Judge W. Arthur
Garrity, warning of an explosive racial situation stemming
from the city's integration crisis, said yesterday he would
close two potentially troublesome high schools if
necessary.
Garrity's warning came as the U.S. Supreme Court in
Washington let stand a Dec. 18 decision by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in connection with the city's
integration program. The appeals court had upheld
Garrity's finding that the Boston School Committee
deliberately operated a segregated school system.
Garrity, who issued a new integration plan Saturday,
warned at a hearing here yesterday that tensions in South
Boston and Hyde Park high schools, already building for
several days, were heightened by his latest proposal.
The judge added, "The court feels that it has an
obligation to do whatever it can to head off an explosive
situation in two of the schools that could cause serious
injury to young peole."
SLA Accused Of 3 More Plots
SACRAMENTO — The Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) plotted at least three terrorist attacks that were
never carried out, the prosecution in the Marcus Foster
murder trial said yesterday.
As the prosecution moved into the last hours of its
case. Judge Elvin Sheehy allowed SLA communiques to
be shown to the jury saying Kaiser Industires, General Tire
& Rubber Co. and Avis Rent-a-Car were targets of the
planned attacks.
The jury will also hear about the March 1 escape
attempt by Joseph Remiro and Russell Little in which
two sheriff's deputies were injured, Sheehy said, ruling
again over defense objections as the seventh week of the
trial began.
Remiro, 28, and Little, 25, are charged with the Nov.
6, 1973, cyanide-bullet assassination of Foster, the
Oakland school chief, and the wounding of Robert
Blackburn, his deputy.
Jensen read three communiques to the jury that were
apparently intended for publication after the attacks took
place in the fall of 1973. None of the attacks occurred.

Doctors* Malpractice Strike Spreads
SAN FRANCISCO — The doctors' protest over
skyrocKeting malpractice rates gained momentum
yesterday as physicians from three more Northern
California counties refused to perform all but emergency
surgery.
More than 90 anesthesiologists and an unknown
number of surgeons in Santa Clara, San Mateo and Santa
Cruz counties joined in the boycott begun May 1 by
colleagues in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Sacramento County physicians also threatened to walk
off their jobs May 19, and members of the Los Angeles
County Medical Association are reportedly considering a
boycott of hospitals over a 200-mile stretch from the
Mexican border to the Tehachapi mountains.
'Emergency' In South Korea
SEOUL, South Korea — President Chung Hee Park,
worried about Communist victories in Indochina, is
moving South Korea toward what the government calls a
"total security posture" or a "wartime emergency
system."
Park, who rules with unlimited power form a 1972
constitution written to cope with an alleged imminent
threat from North Korea, has often been accused of
overplaying the issue of national security for his own
political purposes. Now, however, he is getting support for
his claim that Sou»h Korea's national security is more
seriously threatened than at any time since the 1953
Korean armistice.
The U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and
Cambodia has caused a crisis mood among South Koreans.
Tens of thousands of citizens turn out daily for rallies
across the country intended to support Park's views.
In a national broadcast on April 29, Park said it was
not the time to debate whether there was serious danger
from the North but the time to take concrete steps
promptly against such a possibility.
Increased Gas Taxes Proposed
WASHINGTON — A proposed flexible oil import
quota program survived another test yesterday as the
House Ways and Means Committee began its final voting
on an energy tax bill designed to punish waste and reward
conservation.
The bill would boost the federal tax on gasoline by as
much as 23 cents a gallon, create quotas and new duties

on imported petroleum, tax gas-guzzling new cars if
automakers fail to meet mileage efficiency standards, tax
some industrial and business use of petroleum and natural
gas, set up a trust fund to encourage developing new
energy sources, and give personal tax cuts to Americans
who install energy-conserving home insulation.
The major dispute to be resolved by the committee
centered on features which would increase the present
four-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax, with a
three-cents-a-gallon increase next year to be followed in
1977 by a boost of up to 20 cents a gallon.
This added 20 cents a gallon would apply if
conservation efforts fail to curb the nation's gasoline
consumption during 1976 compared to the 1973 record
level. However, there would be a special refund system
returning to taxpayers much of the money which would
be raised through this feature.
Two Boston Schools May Close
BOSTON — U.S. District Court Judge W. Arthur
Garrity, warning of an explosive racial situation stemming
from the city's integration crisis, said yesterday he would
close two potentially troublesome high schools if
necessary.
Garrity's warning came as the U.S. Supreme Court in
Washington let stand a Dec. 18 decision by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in connection with the city's
integration program. The appeals court had upheld
Garrity's finding that the Boston School Committee
deliberately operated a segregated school system.
Garrity, who issued a new integration plan Saturday,
warned at a hearing here yesterday that tensions in South
Boston and Hyde Park high schools, already building for
several days, were heightened by his latest proposal.
The judge added, "The court feels that it has an
obligation to do whatever it can to head off an explosive
situation in two of the schools that could cause serious
injury to young peole."
SLA Accused Of 3 More Plots
SACRAMENTO — The Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) plotted at least three terrorist attacks that were
never carried out, the prosecution in the Marcus Foster
murder trial said yesterday.
As the prosecution moved into the last hours of its
case. Judge Elvin Sheehy allowed SLA communiques to
be shown to the jury saying Kaiser Industires, General Tire
& Rubber Co. and Avis Rent-a-Car were targets of the
planned attacks.
The jury will also hear about the March 1 escape
attempt by Joseph Remiro and Russell Little in which
two sheriff's deputies were injured, Sheehy said, ruling
again over defense objections as the seventh week of the
trial began.
Remiro, 28, and Little, 25, are charged with the Nov.
6, 1973, cyanide-bullet assassination of Foster, the
Oakland school chief, and the wounding of Robert
Blackburn, his deputy.
Jensen read three communiques to the jury that were
apparently intended for publication after the attacks took
place in the fall of 1973. None of the attacks occurred.

Doctors* Malpractice Strike Spreads
SAN FRANCISCO — The doctors' protest over
skyrocKeting malpractice rates gained momentum
yesterday as physicians from three more Northern
California counties refused to perform all but emergency
surgery.
More than 90 anesthesiologists and an unknown
number of surgeons in Santa Clara, San Mateo and Santa
Cruz counties joined in the boycott begun May 1 by
colleagues in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Sacramento County physicians also threatened to walk
off their jobs May 19, and members of the Los Angeles
County Medical Association are reportedly considering a
boycott of hospitals over a 200-mile stretch from the
Mexican border to the Tehachapi mountains.
'Emergency' In South Korea
SEOUL, South Korea — President Chung Hee Park,
worried about Communist victories in Indochina, is
moving South Korea toward what the government calls a
"total security posture" or a "wartime emergency
system."
Park, who rules with unlimited power form a 1972
constitution written to cope with an alleged imminent
threat from North Korea, has often been accused of
overplaying the issue of national security for his own
political purposes. Now, however, he is getting support for
his claim that Sou»h Korea's national security is more
seriously threatened than at any time since the 1953
Korean armistice.
The U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and
Cambodia has caused a crisis mood among South Koreans.
Tens of thousands of citizens turn out daily for rallies
across the country intended to support Park's views.
In a national broadcast on April 29, Park said it was
not the time to debate whether there was serious danger
from the North but the time to take concrete steps
promptly against such a possibility.
Increased Gas Taxes Proposed
WASHINGTON — A proposed flexible oil import
quota program survived another test yesterday as the
House Ways and Means Committee began its final voting
on an energy tax bill designed to punish waste and reward
conservation.
The bill would boost the federal tax on gasoline by as
much as 23 cents a gallon, create quotas and new duties

on imported petroleum, tax gas-guzzling new cars if
automakers fail to meet mileage efficiency standards, tax
some industrial and business use of petroleum and natural
gas, set up a trust fund to encourage developing new
energy sources, and give personal tax cuts to Americans
who install energy-conserving home insulation.
The major dispute to be resolved by the committee
centered on features which would increase the present
four-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax, with a
three-cents-a-gallon increase next year to be followed in
1977 by a boost of up to 20 cents a gallon.
This added 20 cents a gallon would apply if
conservation efforts fail to curb the nation's gasoline
consumption during 1976 compared to the 1973 record
level. However, there would be a special refund system
returning to taxpayers much of the money which would
be raised through this feature.
Two Boston Schools May Close
BOSTON — U.S. District Court Judge W. Arthur
Garrity, warning of an explosive racial situation stemming
from the city's integration crisis, said yesterday he would
close two potentially troublesome high schools if
necessary.
Garrity's warning came as the U.S. Supreme Court in
Washington let stand a Dec. 18 decision by the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in connection with the city's
integration program. The appeals court had upheld
Garrity's finding that the Boston School Committee
deliberately operated a segregated school system.
Garrity, who issued a new integration plan Saturday,
warned at a hearing here yesterday that tensions in South
Boston and Hyde Park high schools, already building for
several days, were heightened by his latest proposal.
The judge added, "The court feels that it has an
obligation to do whatever it can to head off an explosive
situation in two of the schools that could cause serious
injury to young peole."
SLA Accused Of 3 More Plots
SACRAMENTO — The Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA) plotted at least three terrorist attacks that were
never carried out, the prosecution in the Marcus Foster
murder trial said yesterday.
As the prosecution moved into the last hours of its
case. Judge Elvin Sheehy allowed SLA communiques to
be shown to the jury saying Kaiser Industires, General Tire
& Rubber Co. and Avis Rent-a-Car were targets of the
planned attacks.
The jury will also hear about the March 1 escape
attempt by Joseph Remiro and Russell Little in which
two sheriff's deputies were injured, Sheehy said, ruling
again over defense objections as the seventh week of the
trial began.
Remiro, 28, and Little, 25, are charged with the Nov.
6, 1973, cyanide-bullet assassination of Foster, the
Oakland school chief, and the wounding of Robert
Blackburn, his deputy.
Jensen read three communiques to the jury that were
apparently intended for publication after the attacks took
place in the fall of 1973. None of the attacks occurred.

Cambodians Sieze U.S. Merchant Ship
A Cambodian navy vessel fired on and seized a U.S.
merchant ship and its crew of 39 yesterday in the Gulf of
Thailand, the White House reported.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said President
Ford considered the incident "an act of piracy" and
ordered the State Department to demand immediate
release of the ship. "Failure to do so," he said, "would
have the most serious consequences."
State Department spokesmen saicl immediate steps
