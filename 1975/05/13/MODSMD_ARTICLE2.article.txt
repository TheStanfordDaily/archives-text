# Linguistics To Become Full Department; Applied Mechanics To Lose Independence
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The Board of Trustees is expected today to
approve plans to elevate the Committee on
Linguistics to full-fledged department status and
eliminate the Applied Mechanics Department by
subsuming it under mechanical engineering.
Linguistics Prof. Charles Ferguson said last night
the elevation of his discipline will be beneficial not
only because of "the status involved," but because
"the University is organized by departments.
Faculty hiring is done on a departmental basis."
Ferguson said linguistics would probably remain
at its present size, which includes nine full-time
faculty members. The new department will
continue to offer M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in
linguistics, as well as a B.A. in human language.
Assoc. Linguistics Prof. Clara Bush, currently
chairman of the Committee on Linguistics, will
chair the new department, according to Ferguson.
The Committee on Linguistics was formed

"about 1965," Ferguson said. "1 don't think the
University planned at that time to create a
department, but it hired some good people in the
field, and we now have a full program."
18 Graduates
Currently 18 graduate students are enrolled in
linguistics, a larger number than in at least five
other departments in the School of Humanities
and Sciences (H&S).
Ferguson explained that with the creation of the
human languages major this academic year,
linguistics now has all of the features normally
associated with an H&S department.
The subsuming of the Applied Mechanics
Department under mechanical engineering is "a
logical thing," according to William Kays, dean of
the School of Engineering.
'Way Too Small'
"The (Applied Mechanics] Department was
already being reduced from six to five faculty,"

Kays said, "and that's way too small for a
department."
Another reason for the merger, Kays said, is that
the two fields are closely related and that the study
of mechanical engineering will be "more flexible"
under one department than two.
Kays said there will thus be "long run
cost-savings," but that there will be "no immediate
savings." He said that no layoffs were planned.
Can Finish
The 36 graduate students currently enrolled in
applied mechanics will be able to finish their
degrees in that field, Kays said.
He said that "the decision was made, with my
help, by the faculty of the two departments.
There's been a good deal of conversation about the
change, but it's not that controversial."
The Chemical Engineering Department currently
has only six faculty members, but Kays said that
there was no danger that it would be eliminated.

approve plans to elevate the Committee on
Linguistics to full-fledged department status and
eliminate the Applied Mechanics Department by
subsuming it under mechanical engineering.
Linguistics Prof. Charles Ferguson said last night
the elevation of his discipline will be beneficial not
only because of "the status involved," but because
"the University is organized by departments.
Faculty hiring is done on a departmental basis."
Ferguson said linguistics would probably remain
at its present size, which includes nine full-time
faculty members. The new department will
continue to offer M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in
linguistics, as well as a B.A. in human language.
Assoc. Linguistics Prof. Clara Bush, currently
chairman of the Committee on Linguistics, will
chair the new department, according to Ferguson.
The Committee on Linguistics was formed

"about 1965," Ferguson said. "1 don't think the
University planned at that time to create a
department, but it hired some good people in the
field, and we now have a full program."
18 Graduates
Currently 18 graduate students are enrolled in
linguistics, a larger number than in at least five
other departments in the School of Humanities
and Sciences (H&S).
Ferguson explained that with the creation of the
human languages major this academic year,
linguistics now has all of the features normally
associated with an H&S department.
The subsuming of the Applied Mechanics
Department under mechanical engineering is "a
logical thing," according to William Kays, dean of
the School of Engineering.
'Way Too Small'
"The (Applied Mechanics] Department was
already being reduced from six to five faculty,"

Kays said, "and that's way too small for a
department."
Another reason for the merger, Kays said, is that
the two fields are closely related and that the study
of mechanical engineering will be "more flexible"
under one department than two.
Kays said there will thus be "long run
cost-savings," but that there will be "no immediate
savings." He said that no layoffs were planned.
Can Finish
The 36 graduate students currently enrolled in
applied mechanics will be able to finish their
degrees in that field, Kays said.
He said that "the decision was made, with my
help, by the faculty of the two departments.
There's been a good deal of conversation about the
change, but it's not that controversial."
The Chemical Engineering Department currently
has only six faculty members, but Kays said that
there was no danger that it would be eliminated.
