# P.A. Mayor, County Supervisor Oppose Property Tax Increase
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Palo Alto Mayor Byron Sher and
Santa Clara County Supervisor Gerry
Steinberg yesterday pledged to oppose
property tax increases this year.
The pledge, made at a press
conference in the mayor's office, was
prompted by the Santa Clara County
assessor's recent announcement of a
hike in assessed property values.
The reassessment of many
properties in Palo Alto, Stanford and
elsewhere in the county will ultimately
raise the county landowner's tax bill.
Assessed value increases will average
15 percent and could range as high as
100 percent. Stanford's residential tax
bill will climb "approximately eight to
12 percent," county assessor's office

spokesman Bob Nellis said.
Stanford industrial park properties
have not yet been completely
reappraised, he added.
Reassessment will not affect the tax
rate (amount paid per $100 of assessed
evaluation). However, it does change
the total value of the property,
increasing the tax base.
The county assessor is directed by
state law to continually assess
property values based on current sales.
According to Sher, there has been a
tremendous escalation of selling prices
in Palo Alto.
Steinberg explained that although a
continuing assessment standard is

maintained, "from year to year certain
areas get scrutinized. This year it was
Palo Alto." Steinberg represents the
fifth-supervisorial district, which
includes Stanford.
The issuance of annual assessment
notices in neighboring counties last
week promoted strong protests by
property owners. Santa Clara residents
have expressed comparatively quiet
concern.
At Stanford very few complaints
have been directed to the Faculty
Housing Office, according to Manager
Robert Summers. "I've had a few
inquiries from half a dozen
homeowners but no one has been
really irate about it,"he said.
