# But Craftsmen Like While Plaza Atmosphere
## Economy, Regulations Hassle Vendors 
### PAMELA BAGLEY 
"For a penny? Sure, here's one
just for you!" says Larry, the flower
man, as he pulls a wilting red carnation
from his "extra" box and hands it to
the beaming little girl.
It's definitely not a big sale, but
one that's typical to the good-natured
vendors who scatter themselves around
White Plaza each weekday.
But just how long this generosity
can last is a matter of concern to these
craftsmen.
"The economy is taking its toll out
here, too," says Larry. "It's hardly
worth my time for just $15 a day."
Such a dearth of business scarcely
warrants his 100-mile daily journey to
Stanford from Santa Cruz, he says.
But it's not just the recession that is
impelling Larry to pack up and leave.
"The administration is getting tougher
on us each day — really beginning to
crack down," he says.
Vehicle Restriction
Specifically, Larry objects to the
University's recent enforcement of a
regulation which restricts motor
vehicles in White Plaza.
According to the State Vehicle
Code — Section 21-113: "No person
shall drive any vehicle . . . upon the
grounds of any educational institution
.. . except with permission of the

governing board or officer."
"I had some complaints that driving
in White Plaza caused hazards," recalls
former University Ombudsman Harvey
Hall. "White Plaza is not a traffic area,
and this should apply also to the
vendors. They could use hand-carts
just as well."
Little Red Wagon
Larry, who dislikes pulling flowers
in a little red wagon, turned to Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Dale Snape
for support.
Backed by Larry and several other
vendors, Snape responded to Hall's
complaints with a "scheduling-system"
proposal.
The plan suggested that the trucks
be driven onto the plaza during
"soft-times" — the 50 minutes while
classes are in session. The trucks could
not encroach while students moved
between classes.
'Was' Great Idea
"It was a great idea" says Snape,
"until the difficulty of enforcing such
a system was pointed out. Also, the
thin concrete on White Plaza was not
made for vehicles .. . there are too
many service vehicles as it is."
Most vendors, especially those with
small light wares, don't mind
unloading from afar.

SLOW BURN—"Everything's slow for everybody here in the Plaza," says Steve C.raziani, a craftsman who frequently
sets up shop on campus. He also owns a shop in San Jose.
