# But Craftsmen Like While Plaza Atmosphere
## Economy, Regulations Hassle Vendors 
### PAMELA BAGLEY 
"For a penny? Sure, here's one
just for you!" says Larry, the flower
man, as he pulls a wilting red carnation
from his "extra" box and hands it to
the beaming little girl.
It's definitely not a big sale, but
one that's typical to the good-natured
vendors who scatter themselves around
White Plaza each weekday.
But just how long this generosity
can last is a matter of concern to these
craftsmen.
"The economy is taking its toll out
here, too," says Larry. "It's hardly
worth my time for just $15 a day."
Such a dearth of business scarcely
warrants his 100-mile daily journey to
Stanford from Santa Cruz, he says.
But it's not just the recession that is
impelling Larry to pack up and leave.
"The administration is getting tougher
on us each day — really beginning to
crack down," he says.
Vehicle Restriction
Specifically, Larry objects to the
University's recent enforcement of a
regulation which restricts motor
vehicles in White Plaza.
According to the State Vehicle
Code — Section 21-113: "No person
shall drive any vehicle . . . upon the
grounds of any educational institution
.. . except with permission of the

governing board or officer."
"I had some complaints that driving
in White Plaza caused hazards," recalls
former University Ombudsman Harvey
Hall. "White Plaza is not a traffic area,
and this should apply also to the
vendors. They could use hand-carts
just as well."
Little Red Wagon
Larry, who dislikes pulling flowers
in a little red wagon, turned to Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Dale Snape
for support.
Backed by Larry and several other
vendors, Snape responded to Hall's
complaints with a "scheduling-system"
proposal.
The plan suggested that the trucks
be driven onto the plaza during
"soft-times" — the 50 minutes while
classes are in session. The trucks could
not encroach while students moved
between classes.
'Was' Great Idea
"It was a great idea" says Snape,
"until the difficulty of enforcing such
a system was pointed out. Also, the
thin concrete on White Plaza was not
made for vehicles .. . there are too
many service vehicles as it is."
Most vendors, especially those with
small light wares, don't mind
unloading from afar.

SLOW BURN—"Everything's slow for everybody here in the Plaza," says Steve C.raziani, a craftsman who frequently
sets up shop on campus. He also owns a shop in San Jose.
"I've seen three bike accidents —
right here — bad enough that
ambulances had to take the kids
away," says Linda Thompson, as she
sorts her hand-tooled leather goods.
Battleground
"With our trucks down there, this
place would be one hell of a congested
bloody battleground!"
It seems that the majority of the
White Plaza craftsmen are content
with their lifestyle.
"I can't complain. I'm happy here.
This place is almost hassle-free ... no
ripoffs, friendly people ... the nicest
place to work around," says Dave
Wright, the goggle-eyed metal worker
from Sunnyvale.
Benevolent
"In general, we try to be
benevolent in supporting their
industry," says Snape. "Our
relationship with the vendors is a cross
between laissez-faire and negligence."
According to Snape, establishment
of rules and regulations would define a
relationship with these vendors.
Because they are making money, they
are violating the stipulation of the
University's property-tax exemption.
Thus, if the administration wfcnts to
maintain its tax status, it must,either
have no relationship with the vendors
or get rid of them altogether, Snape
says.
The vendors, especially those
without the government's required
$100 resale permit, appreciate the
administration's leniency towards
them. They feel they return the favor
by "enhancing the atmosphere at
Stanford."

Bruce Baird, former Stmford
history student, enjoys the three days
a week he spends here as a vendor. For
him, his work is a daily "reunion"
with old friends.
Baird views Stanford as his "trial
balloon with affluent students"— a test
of the popularity of his Guatemalan
handicrafts.
Within a year, he hopes to leave
White Plaza, organize an import
business with his partner, now in
Guatemala, and set up a retail store in
Palo Alto.
But for the moment, Baird says,"I
love it here and don't want to leave.
The foot traffic is great, especially at
noon, and I do a better business here
than I do at the San Jose flea market
on weekends."
