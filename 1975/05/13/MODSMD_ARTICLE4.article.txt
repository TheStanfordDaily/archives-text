## Senate Ratifies C-15 Vote 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Senate voted 6-1 with
four abstentions last night to ratify the
results of the referendum on the
proposed amendments to the Campus
Judicial Charter (CJC).
The senate also urged the
Committee of 15 (C-15) to reconvene
and investigate further amendments to
the judicial system, particularly for a
student majority in all judicial cases
and equivalent selection methods for
faculty and student members of the
new Student Judicial Council.
The senate further urged the
Council of Presidents to take all steps
necessary by the end of this month to
ensure that the C-15 will reconvene.
Before ratifying the election results,
the senate rejected 3-7-2 Sen. Debbi
Silton's resolution of last week for
another election on the C-15 proposal

in the fall because of the alleged
ambiguity in the language and format
of the - ballot and possible student
confusion as to whether or not the
vote was binding.
The resolution to ratify the
referendum results, submitted by Sen.
Mike Dorsey, argued that the proposed
amendments to the CJC "represent a
substantial, although not completely
satisfactory improvement in the
judicial system."
'Best Interests'
Ratification of the amendments,
said the resolution, is "in the best
interest" of the students' position in
University decision-making processes
and would allow for "continued
progress in judicial reform."
Defeating the amendments would
"effectively prevent any further
changes for at least a year" stated the

resolution.
The amendments will go into effect
when they have been approved by
President Richard Lyman and the
Academic Council.
Gray Resigns
Following passage of the resolution,
Sen. Chris Gray, who had abstained,
resigned from the senate. He could not
be reached for an explanation of his
decision.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
reported that four committees had
been omitted from an earlier list of
University committees with student
positions: There are openings on the
Action Research Liason Office policy
board, "the Committee on~"Services to
Students (COSS) subcommittee on
housing and the ASSU guest
professorship board, and for a student
representative to the faculty senate.
ASSU Vice President Charlotte
Germane told senators that a pilot
program in peer advising will probably
begin fall quarter in two dormitories
yet to be named.
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
suggested that in the future,
organizations requesting fee
assessments be required to submit
budgets to his office for review. The
only other organization in a position
to review fee assessment requests,
Olivieri noted, is the Daily Editorial
Board.
Its recommendations on KZSU and
the Stanford Band, said Olivieri, were
based on budgets which Olivieri would
have questioned. The Band budget had
no information on detailed costs,
while the KZSU budget had very
rounded figures, he said.
"To recommend a fee assessment
with this kind of a budget is a crime,"
said Olivieri.
The matter will be discussed further
at the next senate meeting.

ASSU Vice President Charlotte
Germane told senators that a pilot
program in peer advising will probably
begin fall quarter in two dormitories
yet to be named.
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
suggested that in the future,
organizations requesting fee
assessments be required to submit
budgets to his office for review. The
only other organization in a position
to review fee assessment requests,
Olivieri noted, is the Daily Editorial
Board.
Its recommendations on KZSU and
the Stanford Band, said Olivieri, were
based on budgets which Olivieri would
have questioned. The Band budget had
no information on detailed costs,
while the KZSU budget had very
rounded figures, he said.
"To recommend a fee assessment
with this kind of a budget is a crime,"
said Olivieri.
The matter will be discussed further
at the next senate meeting.
The ASSU Senate voted 6-1 with
four abstentions last night to ratify the
results of the referendum on the
proposed amendments to the Campus
Judicial Charter (CJC).
The senate also urged the
Committee of 15 (C-15) to reconvene
and investigate further amendments to
the judicial system, particularly for a
student majority in all judicial cases
and equivalent selection methods for
faculty and student members of the
new Student Judicial Council.
The senate further urged the
Council of Presidents to take all steps
necessary by the end of this month to
ensure that the C-15 will reconvene.
Before ratifying the election results,
the senate rejected 3-7-2 Sen. Debbi
Silton's resolution of last week for
another election on the C-15 proposal

in the fall because of the alleged
ambiguity in the language and format
of the - ballot and possible student
confusion as to whether or not the
vote was binding.
The resolution to ratify the
referendum results, submitted by Sen.
Mike Dorsey, argued that the proposed
amendments to the CJC "represent a
substantial, although not completely
satisfactory improvement in the
judicial system."
'Best Interests'
Ratification of the amendments,
said the resolution, is "in the best
interest" of the students' position in
University decision-making processes
and would allow for "continued
progress in judicial reform."
Defeating the amendments would
"effectively prevent any further
changes for at least a year" stated the

resolution.
The amendments will go into effect
when they have been approved by
President Richard Lyman and the
Academic Council.
Gray Resigns
Following passage of the resolution,
Sen. Chris Gray, who had abstained,
resigned from the senate. He could not
be reached for an explanation of his
decision.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
reported that four committees had
been omitted from an earlier list of
University committees with student
positions: There are openings on the
Action Research Liason Office policy
board, "the Committee on~"Services to
Students (COSS) subcommittee on
housing and the ASSU guest
professorship board, and for a student
representative to the faculty senate.
