# Marxist Offered Economics Post

Don Harris, a prominent Marxist
professor, has been offered a full
professorship in the Economics
Department here, Department
Chairman James Rosse confirmed
yesterday.
Rosse said Harris has not yet
accepted the offer, but he "expects to
hear from him this week."
Harris, who still holds a tenured
position at the University of
Wisconsin, has served as a visiting
professor here, and is currently
teaching at the University of the West
Indies in Kingston, Jamaica.
The appointment is the direct result
of student pressure in recent years to
hire more faculty who favor an
"alternative approach" to economics,
said Economics Prof. John Gurley,
who now teaches the only
undergraduate course in Marxist
econmics.
Gurley said the appointment of

Harris was the culmination of a
six-month "round-the-world" search
for the most qualified Marxist
professor available.
'Exceptionally Good'
Gurley called Harris "an
exceptionally good teacher,
outstanding researcher and one of the
leading young people in Marxist
economics."
One knowledgeable source told the
Daily that some senior faculty
members were very hesitant about
hiring Harris, but that they gradually
yielded to student pressure.
A conservative economics faculty
member, who wished to remain
anonymous, said he was "not part of
the decision and it would thus be fair
not to say anything."
He also added that "as far as I'm
concerned, [Harris] is not in the same
field I'm in."
Alternatives
The department, Gurley said,
looked for economists who espoused
not only Marxist viewpoints, but other
alternative perspectives as well.
Libertarian economists, who
advocate un trammeled laissez-faire
capitalism, for example, also were
considered in the selection, he
claimed.
Gurley said the search included
those knowledgeable about socialist
economies, even if they didn't
sympathize with a Marxist system.
Search Continues
He admitted, however, that for
most of the students involved in the
struggle for an alternative economist,
"alternative meant Marxist."
The search will continue for
qualified non-traditional economists,
Gurley said.
With the addition of Harris, the
department would be able to offer a
much greater number of courses
taught from a Marxist viewpoint.
Harris is expected to be a popular
choice among students who have
fought for more alternative
economists.
"When the students were looking
for someone last year, they wanted
him," said SWOPSI Director Andy
Panies, a Marxist economist recently
fired from San Jose State University.
New course offerings in radical
economics for 1975-76 are expected
to include seminars in "Imperialism
and Dependency," "Marxian Social
Change," and "Marxist Economic
Theory." Two sections of Economics
120 will be offered, and a new
undergraduate course taught by Harris
may be added.
