# P.A. Voters To Choose Councilmen
## 
### 
Palo Alto voters will elect four city
council members from 11 candidates
today, culminating a typically heated
struggle between traditional slates.
Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8
p.m. as voters choose between the
"residentialists," backed by the
Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC), and the
"establishment," backed by PA '75.
The campaign heated up in its
waning days, as both sides traded
accusations of unfair practices.
Two-Partv Breakdown
ABC candidates Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson, Dick Rosenbaum, and
Larry Klein complained of a
door-to-door handout by PA '75
which was titled "The Big Brother
Politics of ABC."
Henderson sent a formal letter of
complaint to the state Fair Political
Practices Commission, claiming the
handout was "replete with
misstatements of fact and distortions."
PA '75 candidates Roy Clay, Anne
Witherspoon, Scott Carey and Fred
Eyerly accused the ABC slate of
"smear politics," claiming that an ABC
flyer misrepresented their stands on
growth-oriented issues, especially the
proposed Dumbarton Bridge.
Other Issues

incumbent residentialists with "bloc
voting" on key issues.
The issue of controlled growth for
Palo Alto has also been pivotal in the
campaign, with candidates on both
sidec claiming they favor some limit to
growth.
Three independent candidates —
Scott Amoroso, John Frederich and
Brian Devendorf — also are running.
