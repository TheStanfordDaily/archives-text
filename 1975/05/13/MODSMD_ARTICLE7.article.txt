# College Issues Spark Current Protests

During the spring of 1972, the
"radical movement" at Stanford
seemed to have breathed its last.
It is true that there were a lot of
relatively minor disturbances then,
including the arrest of 205
mostly-bewildered people on El
Camino Real, but student activism
that year reminded me of a beached
whale thrashing its tail to try to stay
alive.
With the suspension or expulsion
by the Campus Judicial Panel of most
of the radical leaders that year, it
seemed inevitable that the beached
whale would die quickly.
And indeed it looked like that was
exactly what happened. During the
1972 1973 and 1973-1974 school

years, student activism here became a
museum piece — something for new
collegians to regard with distant
wonder and old participants to
reminisce about.
Not Surprised
I certainly wasn't surprised. While
most of the 1971-1972 Stanford
radicals were well-intentioned, it was
clear that the student body was by
then skeptical of demonstration
politics and was not particularly
concerned that there were Marine
recruiters at the Placement Center or
that there was Department of
Defense-sponsored research going on
at the Hansen Labs.
Many have attempted to explain
that return of student lethargy to
Stanford and to other campuses
around the country.
The phasing out of large-scale
military induction and the winding
down of U.S. troop involvement in
Indochina seemed the best
explanations to me. Students didn't
care (or at least not enougn to make
themselves heard) as long as their own
lives were no longer threatened with
disruption.
A Generation Away?
With the whale lying motionless, I
became convinced that it would be at
least another generation before

students would again lead protests in
this country.
I frankly thought that if
demonstration tactics came into use
again during this decade, the source
would be angry, middle-class workers
laid off from their jobs.
And although this part of my
prediction was not too far off (note
the 45,000 AFL-CIO members who
rallied in Washington, D.C. last
month), I must admit that the sudden
upsurge in student activity this spring
caught me completely by surprise.
Brown Action Incredible
The fact that 3000 Brown
University undergraduates voted to
strike out of an undergraduate
population of 5100 is nothing short of
incredible. Heck, the fact that over
3000 were concerned enough to vote
either way is no small wonder.
Sure, the actual level of
participation at Brown involved fewer
than 3000 students, and the protests
at other colleges and universities have
been much smaller, but two crucial
factors must be considered:
First, there has not just been one
isolated demonstration, but rather a
widespread and growing number of
them. Second, all of these protests
have revolved around issues central to
colleges and universities themselves —
issues such as financial aid, faculty
reductions and other budgetary
concerns.
Directly College-Related
This second point is vitally
important because the protestors are
now questioning decisions which are
directly traceable to college and
university administrators whereas
many of the old protests grew

primarily out of frustration with
decisions made in Washington.
Stanford's Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC) has been the primary
group to concern itself with similar
issues at this University. So far, the
group's strength has not really been
tested, and the approach of the group
has been relatively low-key.
ARC, however, has called for a
protest today, when the University's
Board of Trustees is on campus, over
the issues of minority financial aid and
the Communication Department
contract with Iran.
Support Revealing
The amount of student support for
the protest will likely be very
revealing. 1 am personally skeptical
that the same Stanford student body
that lay dormant for two years will
come alive at this demonstration over
these issues.
But then if you had asked me three
months ago whether I could foresee
three-fifths of Brown's undergraduates
voting to go on strike, I would have
laughed in your face.
The beached whale is beginning to
show some signs of life at Stanford
too, but my guess is that it won't get
very far. Then again, it might be one
hell of a sleeping giant.

PROTEST '75 -Earlier this year students protesting cutbacks in financial aids
to minority students rallied in front of the Old Union, leading some observers
to believe that the students' movement might be coming back. See picture
below for what the 1971 demonstrations had to offer.
