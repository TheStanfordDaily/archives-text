# Demonstrations And Real Issues
## Robert Rosenzweig 
### 
In this Age of Hyperbole the word
"jnovement" preceded by an adjective
like "political," "social," or "student"
makes me nervous. The image it is
intended to evoke, that of masses of
people marching in rhythm to the
great music of history, is simply too
far from the mark too much of the
time.
So 1 was skeptical of the "old"
student movement - to be worthy of
t.fie name a movement should at least
reach beyond kindergarten age before
expiring â€” and I am even more
sceptical of the "new" student
movement. My mind is open, but I
need to be persuaded.
I mean by this no disrespect to the
Capacity of college students to engage
in political activity of one kind or
another. Actually, on the average they
do so less than their elders, but the
participation of college students in the
civil rights activities of the early '60s
and the anti war activities of the later
'60s certainly added some effective
manpower and energy to both of those
causes.
Speculation
The recent outbreak of strikes and
sit-ins has naturally enough, raised
speculation about the start of a "new"
movement.
* Such speculation seems to me to
say less about what is actually
happening than about the continuing
fascination of the communications
media with the behavior of the young
J-- a fascination that produced almost
as much attention to the question of
why the campuses have been quiet as
it did a few years ago to the question
of why they were noisy.

The stimulus for the current round
of activity seems to be the financial
difficulties of the institutions in which
students live and study. It is no
accident that many of the
demonstrations have focused on the
commitment of colleges to minority
programs. There is ample reason in
history for blacks, chicanos and other
minorities to fear that as the financial
diet becomes leaner theirs will be the
first ration to be reduced.

Healthy Effect
That understandable concern, and
the alertness that ought to accompany
it should have a healthy effect on
institutional decision-making. There
are some dangers, however.
One is that every change that
affects minorities will be interpreted
automatically as a lessening of
commitment; another is the
assumption that all institutions are
alike, and that what happens in one is
bound to happen in others; a third is
that methods of action devised in
other times for other issues will be

thought to be appropriate and
effective for these times and these
issues. - - *
I believe that all of those are wrong.
1 also believe that blurring local
differences in order to fit the pattern
of a presumed national movement can
produce destructive errors of
judgment.
Real Danger
That, it seems to me, is the real
danger of the too easy talk about a
new student movement.
There are real issues aplenty as
colleges and universities contract for
the first time in 30 years.
We can find constructive and
effective ways to deal with those
issues. But we are less likely to do so if
the seductive music of movement
diverts attention from the more
tedious but more important agenda of
analysis, discussion and decision.
