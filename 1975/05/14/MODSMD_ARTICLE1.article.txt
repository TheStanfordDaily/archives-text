# PA '75 Defeats ABC In City Council Fight
## 
### FENTON JOHNSON 
Palo Alto's heated city council campaign ended with a surprise last night
as the "establishment" slate, PA '75, swept all four seats in contention.
Of the four incumbents running, only '75 candidate Roy Clay held his seat,
with his slate partners Anne Witherspoon, Scott Carey and Fred Eyerly elected
to first terms on the council.
Association for a Balanced Community (ABC) slate incumbents Enid
Pearson, Alan Henderson and Dick Rosenbaum lost, along with the slate's
fourth member, Larry Klein.
Final unofficial returns showed Witherspoon the top vote-getter with
7610, trailed by Eyerly, 6902; Carey,6733; and Clay, 6727. Defeated were
Rosenbaum, 6671; Henderson, 6322; Klein, 6214; Pearson, 5708; and three
other candidates who received less than 1000 votes apiece.

The PA '75 victory climaxed a
campaign which grew increasingly
heated in the closing moments as both
sides traded accusations of unfair
practices.
ABC candidate Henderson filed a
letter of complaint Monday with the
state Fair Political Practices
Commission, charging PA '75
handouts were "replete with
mistatements of fact and distortions."
'Came Too Late'
Asked if the letter could reverse
any of the election's results,
Henderson said, "I suspect that unless
they find something completely illegal
that it won't matter. It came too late."
Candidates on both sides felt thtat
the Palo Alto Times endorsement of
three of the PA '75 candidates played
a major role in the establishment
sweep.
ABC candidates complained that, as
the only local newspaper, the Times
had no right to endorse candidates in
local races. Pearson declared that "it is
despicable that in a one-newspaper
town they should have such power."
She pointed at the results and said,
"Thank the Palo Alto Times."
Editorial 'Important'
PA '75 winner Clay called the
editorial "very important," but
running mate Fted Eyerly pointed to
his victory over Times-endorsed
incumbent Rosenbaum as proof that
"you don't need the Times'
endorsement."
Carey attributed his slate's victory
to the controversial campaign tactics
of his ABC opponent Pearson. "Any
time a candidate makes a blanket
condemnation of another slate, he's in
trouble," he said, referring to
Pearson's attacks on the PA '75 slate
as a whole at various public forums.
None of the PA '75 winners
foresees a dramatic change in the city
council's orientation, though they
predict an end to the "bloc voting" of
the defeated ABC incumbents. Clay
said the new council would be "more
objective, and more issue oriented."
'Step Backward'
ABC forces regard their defeat as a
"step backward" for the quality of
residential life in Palo Alto. Pearson
predicted "the things [limiting
growth ] we worked for will be slowly
eliminated..
Eyerly characterized the new
council as residentialist, however,
claiming it will take a "moderate
view" that Palo Alto residents really
want.
One of the first changes ABC
candidates predicted is the unseating
of Stanford Law Prof. Byron Sher as
Palo Alto Mayor. "Sher cannot help
but be unseated," Henderson said,
claiming that Sher generally aligns
himself with ABC council members.

'Step Backward'
ABC forces regard their defeat as a
"step backward" for the quality of
residential life in Palo Alto. Pearson
predicted "the things [limiting
growth ] we worked for will be slowly
eliminated..
Eyerly characterized the new
council as residentialist, however,
claiming it will take a "moderate
view" that Palo Alto residents really
want.
One of the first changes ABC
candidates predicted is the unseating
of Stanford Law Prof. Byron Sher as
Palo Alto Mayor. "Sher cannot help
but be unseated," Henderson said,
claiming that Sher generally aligns
himself with ABC council members.

SNAKING TOWARD THE TRUSTEES—The head of yesterday's march heads
under the Meyer Library elevated entrance as it moves toward the Center for
Research and Development in Teaching building where the Board of Trustees
was meeting. After a rally outside the building, the column moved off to the
Old Union.
Palo Alto's heated city council campaign ended with a surprise last night
as the "establishment" slate, PA '75, swept all four seats in contention.
Of the four incumbents running, only '75 candidate Roy Clay held his seat,
with his slate partners Anne Witherspoon, Scott Carey and Fred Eyerly elected
to first terms on the council.
Association for a Balanced Community (ABC) slate incumbents Enid
Pearson, Alan Henderson and Dick Rosenbaum lost, along with the slate's
fourth member, Larry Klein.
Final unofficial returns showed Witherspoon the top vote-getter with
7610, trailed by Eyerly, 6902; Carey,6733; and Clay, 6727. Defeated were
Rosenbaum, 6671; Henderson, 6322; Klein, 6214; Pearson, 5708; and three
other candidates who received less than 1000 votes apiece.

The PA '75 victory climaxed a
campaign which grew increasingly
heated in the closing moments as both
sides traded accusations of unfair
practices.
ABC candidate Henderson filed a
letter of complaint Monday with the
state Fair Political Practices
Commission, charging PA '75
handouts were "replete with
mistatements of fact and distortions."
'Came Too Late'
Asked if the letter could reverse
any of the election's results,
Henderson said, "I suspect that unless
they find something completely illegal
that it won't matter. It came too late."
Candidates on both sides felt thtat
the Palo Alto Times endorsement of
three of the PA '75 candidates played
a major role in the establishment
sweep.
ABC candidates complained that, as
the only local newspaper, the Times
had no right to endorse candidates in
local races. Pearson declared that "it is
despicable that in a one-newspaper
town they should have such power."
She pointed at the results and said,
"Thank the Palo Alto Times."
Editorial 'Important'
PA '75 winner Clay called the
editorial "very important," but
running mate Fted Eyerly pointed to
his victory over Times-endorsed
incumbent Rosenbaum as proof that
"you don't need the Times'
endorsement."
Carey attributed his slate's victory
to the controversial campaign tactics
of his ABC opponent Pearson. "Any
time a candidate makes a blanket
condemnation of another slate, he's in
trouble," he said, referring to
Pearson's attacks on the PA '75 slate
as a whole at various public forums.
None of the PA '75 winners
foresees a dramatic change in the city
council's orientation, though they
predict an end to the "bloc voting" of
the defeated ABC incumbents. Clay
said the new council would be "more
objective, and more issue oriented."
