# Indochina Forecast Still Hazy

### Stephen Carter 
The sudden collapse of illegitimate and
corrupt American-supported governments in
Southeast Asia has not, of course, surprised
anyone. The super-hawks pointed out long
ago that without American aid, the Saigon
regime of Nguyen Van Thieu and the
Phnom Penh administration of Lon Nol
could not survive — which, of course, led to
the question of why they should survive.
The super-radicals, on the other hand,
pointed to an inevitable victory —
"liberation," if you will — of and for the
people in Southeast Asia. If you accept the
premise that the people supported the
revolutionary movements in those
countries, this analysis proved closer to the
truth.
Now all Vietnam and Cambodia are
under communist domination, after years
of fighting, and Laos is undergoing a
peaceful revolution, but the new situation
seems to be raising more questions than it is
answering.
There can be no denying that the
revolutionary government in Saigon (or, if
you prefer, Ho Chi Minh City) and the
Khmer Rouge administration in Phnom
Penh are legitimate, and neither the United
States nor the United Nations can
accomplish anything useful by refusing to
recognize them.
What is unfortunately terribly unclear is
how the new governments are running their
nations. Many observers, often victims of
their own rhetoric, predicted bloodbaths in
Cambodia and Vietnam in the event of
Communist takeover. Some others said
there would be no massacres; still others
argued that it would not matter if there
WPI*P
Who Is Right?
And we still do not know who was right,
due to unfortunate information
disseminating policies by both new
governments. There have been few

dispatches from Saigon, and several have
claimed those reports are censored. A
monitor of the new government radio has
produced only scanty — and undeniably
selected — information.
The Khmer Rouge have imposed a total
news blackout, and are in the process of
removing all foreign nationals from
Cambodia. There, too, the official
government radio is the only source of
information, but its yield is even worse than
Saigon's.
Various news services and individuals
have alternatively reported and then
retracted reports of executions or slaughters
of various sizes in Phnom Penh. One
witness, widely quoted as having seen
widespread killings by the new government,

later admitted that all he had heard was
second and third hand.
Early reports that a convoy of foreigners
heading for the Thai border had met with
some dire fate in Cambodia were refuted
when the group reached the border. Most of
the people in the group admitted that
soldiers and peasants had helped them
along.
News Blackout
The on-again, off-again communications
blackout with Saigon has hindered reports,
but there is no evidence of any bloodbath.
The official radio has reported that former
government leaders have been released.

Many reply, "What else would the officials
say?" But a government should certainly be
trusted — as ours once was — until it proves
itself untrustworthy — as ours certainly has.
But Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
and his spokesman, Gerald Ford, have
treated what they insist on calling the "fall"
of Southeast Asia as a great tragedy, even
before ascertaining the lines the new
governments will take.
Actually, both governments seem bent
on remaining nonaligned. The
revolutionary government in South
Vietnam has outlawed all foreign currencies
— including North Vietnam's. That does not
sound as though the North Vietnamese are
calling the shots, as many had claimed they
would.
The Khmer Rouge have indicated no
desire to receive aid from outside the
country. Of course, Prince Sihanouk, when
he ruled that country, tried to remain
neutral — but after Nixon's pointless
invasion, and the American-armed coup
which ousted Sihanouk, this naturally
proved impossible. In any event, the new
government has apparently informed
Sihanouk, now in Peking, that it does not
seek his return.
Deplore The 'Fall'
The government of the United States,
meanwhile, continues to deplore the "fall,"
and welcomes the "refugees" with far more
enthusiasm than it has ever shown for the
unemployed and minorities at home.
There is no evidence, yet, that the
surrender of the capital cities in a few
Southeast Asian countries is a tragedy; nor
is it necessarily a time for celebration, as
others have asserted.
The entire world must simply wait and
see.

monitor of the new government radio has

The Khmer Rouge have imposed a total

removing all foreign nationals from
Cambodia. There, too, the official
government radio is the only source of

Various news services and individuals

Early reports that a convoy of foreigners
heading for the Thai border had met with

News Blackout
The on-again, off-again communications
blackout with Saigon has hindered reports,
but there is no evidence of any bloodbath.
The official radio has reported that former
government leaders have been released.

Many reply, "What else would the officials
say?" But a government should certainly be
trusted — as ours once was — until it proves
itself untrustworthy — as ours certainly has.
But Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
and his spokesman, Gerald Ford, have
treated what they insist on calling the "fall"
of Southeast Asia as a great tragedy, even
before ascertaining the lines the new
governments will take.
Actually, both governments seem bent
on remaining nonaligned. The
revolutionary government in South
Vietnam has outlawed all foreign currencies
— including North Vietnam's. That does not
sound as though the North Vietnamese are
calling the shots, as many had claimed they
would.
The Khmer Rouge have indicated no
desire to receive aid from outside the
country. Of course, Prince Sihanouk, when
he ruled that country, tried to remain
neutral — but after Nixon's pointless
invasion, and the American-armed coup
which ousted Sihanouk, this naturally
proved impossible. In any event, the new
government has apparently informed
Sihanouk, now in Peking, that it does not
seek his return.
Deplore The 'Fall'
The government of the United States,
meanwhile, continues to deplore the "fall,"
and welcomes the "refugees" with far more
enthusiasm than it has ever shown for the
unemployed and minorities at home.
There is no evidence, yet, that the
surrender of the capital cities in a few
Southeast Asian countries is a tragedy; nor
is it necessarily a time for celebration, as
others have asserted.
The entire world must simply wait and
see.

The sudden collapse of illegitimate and
corrupt American-supported governments in
Southeast Asia has not, of course, surprised
anyone. The super-hawks pointed out long
ago that without American aid, the Saigon
regime of Nguyen Van Thieu and the
Phnom Penh administration of Lon Nol
could not survive — which, of course, led to
the question of why they should survive.
The super-radicals, on the other hand,
pointed to an inevitable victory —
"liberation," if you will — of and for the
people in Southeast Asia. If you accept the
premise that the people supported the
revolutionary movements in those
countries, this analysis proved closer to the
truth.
Now all Vietnam and Cambodia are
under communist domination, after years
of fighting, and Laos is undergoing a
peaceful revolution, but the new situation
seems to be raising more questions than it is
answering.
There can be no denying that the
revolutionary government in Saigon (or, if
you prefer, Ho Chi Minh City) and the
Khmer Rouge administration in Phnom
Penh are legitimate, and neither the United
States nor the United Nations can
accomplish anything useful by refusing to
recognize them.
What is unfortunately terribly unclear is
how the new governments are running their
nations. Many observers, often victims of
their own rhetoric, predicted bloodbaths in
Cambodia and Vietnam in the event of
Communist takeover. Some others said
there would be no massacres; still others
argued that it would not matter if there
