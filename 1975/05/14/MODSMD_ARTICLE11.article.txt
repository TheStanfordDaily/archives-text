# ARLO Puts Ideas Into Action
## 
### 
How quickly can a great idea
become a reality? Having
students participate in
action-oriented research which
will enhance their educational
experience and permit their
skills and knowledge to be
applied to problems in the
broader community is an
increasingly accepted concept.
There are many reasons why
this idea is not more widespread:
community organizations need
to know what students are
interested in; students need to
know how they can get involved
and contribute without being
overwhelmed; faculty need to be
able to plan community oriented
projects into their courses; more
generally, there is a need for a
facilitator or a catalyst between
the University and the
community to develop and
connect potential needs and
resources. The Action Research

Liaison Office (ARLO) is such a
facilitating agent.
ARLO currently offers more
than 70 projects sponsored by
some 35 organizations in a range
of topic areas that include
ecology, criminal justice, mental
health, human rights, housing,
employment and education.
Since ARLO began in the spring
in 1974, more than 100 students
have worked on a total of 42
projects, and over 20 projects
have already been completed.
Some examples of completed
projects include an evaluation of
Dial-a-Ride, a study of
job-sharing and women in
non-traditional jobs, geological
and biological analyses of a 62-
acre site in the foothills which
belongs to the Palo Alto School
District and may be sold to
developers, and a survey of
public opinion on Department
of Defense Budget and

government priorities.
In order to develop a broad
range of contacts, establish
continuity and credibility, and
ensure projects with a high
probability of success, ARLO is
staffed with people who have
extensive experience in
community organizing, teaching,
and University administration.
The two co-directors, Edith
Eddy and Bill Leland, and the
office manager, Bill Dryden,
report to a Policy Board
composed of a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
four students appointed by the
ASSU Senate, four faculty
appointed by the student
members, the directors of
SWOPSI and SCIRE, and an
invited representative of the
Dean of Students staff.
Because ARLO is sponsored
by ASSU and maintains a
student majority on the Policy
Board, student control is
assured.
ARLO began with seed
money of $5000. Of this total,
$2000 came from the ASSU
Senate and Council of
Presidents, $500 came from the
Dean's Initiative Fund, and a
private contributor matched
these grants with a $2500 gift.
Although vigorous
fundraising began in the spring
of 1974, the search for money
has been difficult and
time-consuming. Without an
emergency grant of $1200 from
the University's Community
Relations Office — and without
the willingness of staff to work
for. months at 60 percent of the
salaries the board wished to pay
— ARLO could not have
survived.
In Nov. 1974, just 10 days
before our funds would have
been exhausted, the Hancock
Foundation awarded ARLO
$10,000. Four months later, a
$3000 grant was awarded by
the LARAS Fund. Altogether,
ARLO has received $19,200.
By holding expenditures 15
percent below what we had
budgeted for the current year,
we have retained enough of this
total ($7000) to sustain ARLO

through the end of August.
For 1975-76, we project a
budget of $23,945. At that level,
we're running a tight program.
76 percent of the budget will go
for salaries, 13 percent will be
used to communicate project
offerings to students and
faculty, and 11 percent will
support ARLO's computerized
information system and other
office expenses.
Three student positions (two
two-year appointments and a
one-year appointment) are now
open on the ARLO Policy
Board. Interested students, both
graduates and undergraduates,
are encouraged to pick up
applications at the ASSU office
in Tresidder and return them
completed by Friday, May 16.

student in psychology, is
chairman of ARLO's Policy
Board.)
