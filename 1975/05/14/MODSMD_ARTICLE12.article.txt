Story Insults Bresnick
Editor:
We are friends and former
students of Martin Bresnick.
After reading the article about
him in the May 8 Daily, we feel
compelled to state that he is, in
reality, intelligent, coherent, and
hard-working, and a serious
artist deeply interested in
truthful communication with his
audience.
One could easily infer that
the opposite must apply to the
article's author. The junior high
school journalism of this piece is
an insult to Bresnick and
embarrassing for his students
and friends. The inane and
presumptuous descriptions,
particularly in the opening
paragraph, were done at the
expense of Bresnick's right to
expect fair and intelligent
reportage of the honor he has
been awarded.

On Shuttle Bus
Editor:
We want to thank the Daily
staff for its very responsible and
generous coverage of our
nighttime shuttle bus service.
The service was offered to the
students on a trial basis, and any
comments about it would be
helpful.

'Daily' Is Mindless
Editor:
The Daily is controlled by a
humorless clique of ideological
rubber-stampers. Is it so
inconceivable to have two of its
distinguished editors disagreeing
on a point, or is there a Daily
policy file of which all of its
articles must support?
When questioned by the
Daily about my unusually high
draw number last week, I was
told to agree that;
—the draw system sucks;
—we should make our choices
after we draw.
I argued to the contrary, and
thus I was ignored, and was
subjected to the ignominy of
having my name spelled the way
the goys spell it.
I was also disturbed with the
May 5 column by John Freed,
master of mongoloid humor. I,
for one, don't have the ability to
write three columns of copy in
such an entertaining style that
nothing has to be said. Freed
seems aware of the Daily's
anti-housing office stand, but
seems reluctant to provide any
new insights. As long as the
mindless masses control the
Daily, students will be subjected
to this kind of uncreative
garbage.

Viets Not Yet Free
Editor:
The Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC) has expressed its
joy "now that [the people of
Indochina] have won freedom
and peace."
The people of Indochina are
now independent of U.S.
influence, and we should rejoice
that at long last they do have
peace. However, there is still a
time to wait until they are free.
It is ridiculous to claim that a
people's government
dictatorship frees people.
The states of Vietnam and
Cambodia are now free. The
people of Indochina will have to
wait for their freedom. Someday
we might have cause for
wholeheartedly rejoicing with
them.
