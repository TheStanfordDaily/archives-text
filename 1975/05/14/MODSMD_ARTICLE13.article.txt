## On The Air With KLOK's O'Day And Ronnie 'Punchlines From The Gods' Earn Oldies Radio Station Highest Evening Ratings In Town 
### GLENN GARVIN PATTY FELS 
10:52 and 20 seconds,' " O'Day
recalled. "Then the station put
up these catchy red-white-and
blue billboards that said 'WYPC
— All the time, all the time.' "
That's where they met.
"Ronnie was a go-go dancer in
Gainesville, where she was
working her way through school
on a veterinary scholarship,"
O'Day said. "No," interrupted

SAN JOSE — "You want to
know our theory of comedy?"
asked Dan O'Day, flipping
another record onto the
turntable. "It came from outer
space. You can read all about it
in our new book, Punchlines
From The Gods."
O'Day delivered the line with
a straight face, and, like so much
of what he says, it was hard to
interpret. Dan O'Day and his
partner Ronnie Richards deliver
any line, no matter how
ridiculous, with a straight face
and a steady voice.
It's apparently a successful
formula: the two nighttime disc
jockeys have pulled KLOK radio
from the bottom of the Bay
Area's seven-to-midnight ratings
to number one in that time slot.
That's not bad for two
24-year-old people who until last
fall were thrilling the
cosmopolitan folk of Lake
Wales, Florida on station WYPC.
Timely
"We gave the time. That's all
we did. You know, 'The time is

Ronnie. "I went through law
school on a veterinary
scholarship."
"Ron went on a Fulbright
scholarship, even though she was
only half bright," O'Day added.
"We did commercials together,
and they stunk. Actually they
were excellent. And so I said to
Ron, 'Ron, Goddamn it' — are
you going to print every foul
word I say? — I said, 'Ron, gosh
darn it

After the two did
commercials with each other for
a while, they began doing a
three-hour show together. Six
months later they made it to the
finals of a disc jockey contest
sponsored by Billboard
magazine.
DJ Contest
"We went to New York for
the finals," O'Day said. "We

'We like our listeners to be loyal. We want
them to listen despite the fact that they hate
everything we say or do.'

stayed in the Plaza Hotel and ate
in the Snobbery Room." They
didn't win the contest, but they
did well enough to convince
them it was time to move on to
a bigger market. So they headed
for KLOK, San Jose's
50,000-watt oldies station.
"I needed to be on the
beach," Ronnie explained. "I
ebb toward the beach. I was
bom on the beach."
"Her midwife was a

porpoise," O'Day interjected.
The station's format didn't
matter much, he said: "We'll
play Peruvian polkas if the
money is good." But O'Day
admitted that working for an
oldie station has some
advantages. "Any radio station
you listen to, most of what they
play is garbage," he said. "At
KFRC they play 19 songs, and
16 of them are garbage. But we
have a bigger play list here. So
instead of playing three songs I
like, I have 30 songs here I like."
KLOK's management, eager
to boost the sagging nighttime
ratings, gave O'Day and Ronnie
a free hand when they arrived at
the station. "They said, 'Do
what you want and as long as it

works, okay. If it doesn't, we'll
get somebody whoU do it our
way,' " O'Day said.
Newman, McQueen . . . O'Day?
So O'Day and Ronnie do it
their way, which includes
making fun of listeners,
advertisers and station
management. One taped
commercial for a local television
station's movie festival featured
a husky female voice
breathlessly asking "Who are the
three sexiest men in America
today? Paul Newman, Steve
McQueen and Robert Redford."
One night surprised listeners
heard instead a familiar
masculine voice intoning "Dan
O'Day. Dan O'Day. Dan
O'Day."
One night last week a listener
called and said "I'd like to hear
'The No-No Song.'" Ronnie
picked up the phone and began
crooning "No no no no, I don't
smoke it no more." After two
verses she stopped and asked "Is
that enough?" Laughing
helplessly, the man on the other
end didn't reply.
O'Day and Ronnie never play

their material. A fairly
well-known Bay Area radio and
advertising personality took
issue after Ronnie said that
"since we put his picture in the
KLOK commissary, all the
cockroaches have stayed away."
O'Day and Ronnie are not
married, although much of their
audience assumes they are.
Ronnie is single, and O'Day has
a wife named Sylvia. Questions
about what Sylvia does are not
particularly productive.
"She usually just hides her
head in embarrassment," O'Day
replied. "She teaches
educationally handicapped
children. It's very noble. We're
going to make a television series
about her . . . She's my best
critic. She never criticizes."
O'Day insists Sylvia is one of
his most faithful listeners. "She
listens all tho time, unless she
has something more important
to do. Like if there's a good
movie on TV, she'll watch it. Or
take a nap. Or wash out her
panty hose."
Just Kidding
The two disc jockeys insist
they never get mad at each
other. "There was the time
Ronnie called me a son of a
bitch on the air," O'Day said.
"But I laughed it off."
"Until his mother called,"
Ronnie added.
Not everything involved in
being a disc jockey is fun, O'Day
said. Specifically: "Getting

requests. "If you play the
request, they'll call you again,"
O'Day said. "We like our
listeners to be loyal. We want
them to listen to us despite the
fact that they hate our music
and everything we say or do.
"A listener that listens to
good music and likes our jokes is
a fickle listener. What happens
when we get old and lose our
wit?"
Ronnie nodded. "KLOK
plays what we want to hear. But
don't quote that."
Cockroaches
Although listeners call fairly
often and complain that O'Day
and Ronnie are making fun of
God, country or both, only one
advertiser has ever objected to

interviewed. Having to work
with Ronnie."
"You took the words right
out of my mouth, Dan," Ronnie
agreed.
"What we do is essentially
meaningless," O'Day said. "What
we do best is when we have-fun

working on their next big
project. "We want to stamp out
one of the biggest killers known
to man," O'Day said.
"It kills more than muscular
dystrophy and cancer and all
those others put together. We're
working to wipe out NC —
Natural Causes...

'There was the time Ronnie called me a son
of a hitch on the air. But I laughed it off.'

and the audience has fun
because we're having fun. But it
doesn't mean anything beyond
that. .. . It's slightly below
finding a cure for cancer. We're
going to go into TV and do a
show for about five years and
become independently wealthy
and retire. . . . We'll come back
and do benefits and things,
though.
"And TV is even more
meaningless."
"We're going into TV,"
Ronnie agreed. "We really are.
Tell him about the show."
"It's called The Rocky and
Bullwinkle Show," O'Day said.
"Right now we're looking
over lots of job offers and movie
bits," Ronnie said.
The two really do plan to
make a variety series on network
television within the next five
years. Meanwhile, they're


THE SEXIEST?—Dan O'Day may not be keeping Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and Robert Redford awake nights, but he and his radio
show partner are keeping many Bay Area listeners tuned to KLOK in the evening.

ROCK AROUND THE KLOK: Ronnie Richards is half of the team that keeps the chatter and the
platters spinning on the Bay Area's "oldies" station. Announcing the time on a radio station in
Florida helped get her where she is today.
