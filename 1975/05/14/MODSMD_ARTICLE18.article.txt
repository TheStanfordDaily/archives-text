## Three Cage Aces Sign With Cards 
### JIM WASCHER 
Basketball Coach Dick
Dißiaso will have three new aces
up his sleeve when his Cards
face a tough Pac-8 schedule next
winter.
Dißiaso announced Monday
that three All-Americans have
signed national letters of intent
to attend Stanford. They are: JC
All-America forward George
Schader of Mt. San Antonio
College in Walnut, Calif., and
two prep All-America guards,
Wolfe Perry of Oakland
Technical High School and Paul
Giovacchini of Judge Memorial
in Salt Lake City.
"Our goal was not only to
find outstanding basketball
players, but also outstanding
students and young men,"
Dißiaso said. "All three players
fulfill these requirements. We
feel all three can make
significant contributions to
Stanford basketball next year."
Schader, Perry and
Giovacchini will each receive full
scholarships here and each has a
shot at a starting spot next
season.
"When we recruited them,"
Dißiaso said, "we didn't tell
them they would start, but we
told them the opportunity was
there." Only one starter from
the 1974-75 squad, forward Ed
Schweitzer, is returning next
year.
Schader, a 6-foot-6'/2, 215
pounder, averaged 22.8 points,
10 rebounds and five assists this
past season for Mt. San Antonio,
earning first team JC
All-America honors. He was also
selected most valuable player of
the South Coast Conference.
Perry, at 6-foot-2 and 175
pounds, led Oakland Tech to a
19-6 record, a conference
championship and the
semi-finals of the Tournament of
Champions. He averaged 15
points and six assists per game
and was named a Scholastic
Coach All-American. He was also
MVP of the Golden State
Classic.
Giovacchini, who stands
6-foot-l and weighs 170, was
prep MVP in the state of Utah
this year. He averaged 23 points
and 9.7 assists per game, hitting
47.4 percent of his field goal
attempts and shooting 79.3
percent from the line. Ranked

No. 1 academically in his class,
he too was named a Scholastic
Coach All-American.
His brother, Marty, started at
guard for Washington State last
season.
Persuading the recruits to
come here wasn't all that easy,
according to Dißiaso. "All three
were recruited by major
four-year universities, all three
had scholarships offeied by
other Pac-8 universities and all
three come here with excellent
credentials."
Perry was reportedly heavily
recruited by USF, USC, Arizona
State and California He
narrowed his choices to Stanford
and Cal before making his final
decision Sunday night.
Giovacchini ended up deciding
between Stanford and Harvard.
"None of the people we
recruited had ever met me
before I came to Stanford, nor
had they visited the University,"
Dißiaso said. "We had to get
them to apply, get them to visit
and get them to know me and
the staff, which meant us going
into their homes."
Dißiaso also credited the
players here — both those who
are graduating and those who
will return next year — for their
help in recruiting the three new
men. "The underclassmen who
were here hosted them and did a
good job," the coach said.
