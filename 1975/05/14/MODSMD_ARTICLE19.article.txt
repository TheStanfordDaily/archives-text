# Trojans Capture Pac-8 Golf
## 
### 
USC pulled away from a
tightly bunched field yesterday
to win the Pacific Eight golf
tournament at Eugene Country
Club in Eugene, Ore.
After Monday's opening 36
holes, five of the eight
conference teams were within 11
shots of the Trojans. But USC
lapped the field in the final 36
holes, shooting 11 over par as a
team to win the tournament by
26 shots over defending
champion Stanford.
Immediately following the
tournament, USC, Stanford and
third-place Oregon received
invitations to the NCAA
Championships June 25-28 at
Ohio State.
"We were happy to come in

second because of the
nationals," said Dave Baskins,
"but our performance was still
disappointing. We didn't play
very well."
USC dominated the
individual as well as the team
competition. Scott Simpson
fired rounds of
77-69-73-71-290 to claim a
three-stroke victory over
defending champion Peter
Jacobsen of Oregon, while Jim
Euzirki, Craig Stadler and Jon
Fiedler — all Trojans — finished
third, fourth and fifth.
Stanford occupied the
remainder of the top 10 as
Baskins finished sixth, George
Pettinger and Mike Mcßride tied
for seventh, and Conrad
Nilmeier tied for ninth.
Mcßride's performance was
the most unexpected — and
most bizarre — of the
tournament. Coach Bud Finger
suspended Aly Trompas Friday
for breaking a club during the
second round of the Pac-8
Southern Division tournament
and instructed Mcßride Friday
night to pack his bags for
Saturday's flight to Eugene.
The senior responded with
rounds of 76-73 Monday and
was savoring his successful
performance at dinner when he
bit into a steak that made him

miserable during yesterday's 36
holes.
Apparently suffering from a
case of food poisoning, Mcßride
vomited after nine holes and had
to see a doctor between rounds.
He still managed to fire rounds
of 76-78 for a 303 total.

champion Stanford.
Immediately following the
tournament, USC, Stanford and
third-place Oregon received
invitations to the NCAA
Championships June 25-28 at
Ohio State.
"We were happy to come in

second because of the
nationals," said Dave Baskins,
"but our performance was still
disappointing. We didn't play
very well."
USC dominated the
individual as well as the team
competition. Scott Simpson
fired rounds of
77-69-73-71-290 to claim a
three-stroke victory over
defending champion Peter
Jacobsen of Oregon, while Jim
Euzirki, Craig Stadler and Jon
Fiedler — all Trojans — finished
third, fourth and fifth.
Stanford occupied the
remainder of the top 10 as
Baskins finished sixth, George
Pettinger and Mike Mcßride tied
for seventh, and Conrad
Nilmeier tied for ninth.
Mcßride's performance was
the most unexpected — and
most bizarre — of the
tournament. Coach Bud Finger
suspended Aly Trompas Friday
for breaking a club during the
second round of the Pac-8
Southern Division tournament
and instructed Mcßride Friday
night to pack his bags for
Saturday's flight to Eugene.
The senior responded with
rounds of 76-73 Monday and
was savoring his successful
performance at dinner when he
bit into a steak that made him

miserable during yesterday's 36
holes.
Apparently suffering from a
case of food poisoning, Mcßride
vomited after nine holes and had
to see a doctor between rounds.
He still managed to fire rounds
of 76-78 for a 303 total.
