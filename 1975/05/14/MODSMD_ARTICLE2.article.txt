# Lyman Says Trustees Did Not Discuss Protest

### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Board of Trustees at its
meeting yesterday did not discuss any
of the demands presented to it earlier
in the day by student protesters,
President Richard Lyman said last
night.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman claimed that the
meeting had finished by the time
demonstrators filed into Old Union
yesterday afternoon.
Lyman also asserted that the Old
Union protest was not really a sit-in
because normal business was not
disrupted. Although Lyman admitted
that some operations of Registrar Sally
Mahoney's office were shut down, he
said the action was taken "at her own
initiative."
"From what I have heard, neither
the intention nor the temper of that
crowd was to do more than to make a
point by its presence," Lyman
explained. "They seem to have gone to
great lengths to keep passages open."
Not Disruption
Lyman emphasized that the
occurrence probably would "not come
under the University's disruption
policy.

"The kind of demonstration we had
today is nothing that we ought to be
concerned about as far as discipline or
a counter-attack are concerned,"
Lyman said, adding no disciplinary
action was planned.
He added, however, that he
doubted if the protest against the
University's $975,000 contract with
Iran would cause consideration of the
pact.
Political Considerations
Lyman said it has long been
University policy not to allow political
considerations to influence its choice of
research contracts.
"Long-standing policies are not
likely to be changed because of
individual cases," Lyman said.
"University policy is based on long
years of argument and reason."
Lyman also claimed that protests
against alleged cuts in minority
financial aid were unfair to the
University since its new aid program
changes the self-help requirement for
minority freshman but does not
reduce the amount of money received
by minorities.
The wave of student protests


WELL NOW. BlLL—Human Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh looks skeptical as Dean of the Engineering School William
Kays makes a point at an open forum last night. Pittendrigh and Kays disagreed on whether raising the overhead charge
on research grants would be desirable.
