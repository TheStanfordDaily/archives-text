## Rangers Run Wild 
### Dan Pyne 
Like someone out of a Faulkner novel, Billy
Martin, the Flem Snopes of the Lone Star State,
is selling wild horses under the name Texas
Rangers. And the American League is beginning
to believe it.
"I thought we should be the team to beat even
before Oakland lost Catfish," said Martin early
this season. "Now I definitely think we should be
favored."
The Oakland A's would undoubtedly disagree.
But then, perhaps the World Champions haven't
been paying attention to the American League
Eastern Division standings.
Martin isn't telling tall tales. Last year he took
the Yippee-ai-oh-kai-ay Kids from the cellar to
second, five games behind Oakland and eight
games above .500. This year the Rangers are
already coming in like a skunk with a tail wind.
The Ranger offensive is led by right fielder Jeff
Burroughs, last year's American League MVP,
who had 25 home runs, 118 RBIs, and a
consistent .301 batting average. This year
Burroughs has six homers and 19 RBIs.
Outfield Not A Pushover
And the rest of the outfield is no pushover. In
center is veteran Willie Davis who batted .295 and
stole 25 bases for the Montreal Expos last year.
Cesar Tovar, in left field, batted .292 last year
with 58 RBIs. Joe Lovitto remains a strong
back-up.
In the infield the Rangers have an assortment
of utility men and Martin loves to shuffle them
around — against Detroit earlier this week he used
two first basemen and two third basemen. Street
and Smith's baseball bible missed its mark
predicting the Ranger infield before the season,
and no one will probably ever be able to figure
out exactly who Martin will use where this
season. But that's the way Billy likes things.
Mike Hargrove was the AL Rookie of the Year
batting .323 in 1974, and should see a lot of
action at first this year after spending his first
year as a designated hitter. Jim Fregosi, a gutsy
veteran who was on and off last year with
assorted injuries, will also start at first. Despite his
ailments Fregosi hit 12 homers in 78 games.
Attempts To Reduce Errors
Lenny Randle batted .302 last year and was
seen as the starting third baseman at the
beginning of the year, but Martin has moved him
to second in an attempt to cut down errors up the
middle. Tob\ Hurrah, who played every game last

at shortstop, moved to third base.
Behind the plate Texas has Jim Sundberg,
already considered one of the best by American
league managers. Sundberg hit .247 in only his
second year in baseball.
The problem (and it is a big one) for Texas is
on the mound. Ferguson Jenkins was 25-12 last
year with a 2.82 ERA and 225 strikeouts. At 31,
Jenkins has a few seasons left, but only if he can
get better relief from the bullpen. He pitched 29
complete games last year, but may not go as
many this season. After dropping his first two
games this year, Fergie has come back to win five
straight.
Lotsa Luck, Billy
Behind him, well, good luck. Jim Bibby was
19-19, Jackie Brown 13-12 and Steve Hargan
12-9. Steve Foucault — the only decent reliever —
appeared in 69 games last year, netting 12 saves
and 8 wins.
Martin picked up a ragbag assortment of
pitchers over the winter. Southpaw Mike Kekich,
the Yankee's famous marital switch-pitcher,
comes from Cleveland to aid a overly-righthanded
staff; Jim Umbarger, an almost-a-rookie from
Arizona State, is another needed lefty who could
come through this year. Otherwise, the bullpen
includes Clyde Wright, a 9-20 ace obtained from
Milwaukee, and Bill Hands, who was 4-5 in his
brief appearances with the Twins last year. Not
much to write home about. But perhaps just
scrappy enough.
"Another club can be beating you for six
innings," Martin says, "but for some reason the
good ball clubs get tough and win them in the last
three." This year, by hook or crook, the Rangers
are living up to that maxim.
Sure as shootin', those half-crazy, motley
spotted horses from the Great American Desert
are kicking and scratching in the American
League west.
There should be one helluva showdown in
September.
For those of you who remain unimpressed, try
this piece of worthless trivia: who is the
toughest-to-strike-out batter in professional
baseball? If you know the answer to this question
be the first to send a self-addressed handwritten
3x5 inch card to "Pro Prognosis" care of the
Stanford Daily and we will send the winner one
Ed Kranepool bubble gum card and a year's
supply of dust. Hurry.
