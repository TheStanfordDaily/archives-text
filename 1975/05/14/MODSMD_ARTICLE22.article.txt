# Pac-8 Tennis Tourney Here
## Schedule Serves Mismatches 
### RON BECK 
The South will rise again.
The Pac-B's southern schools
— Stanford, UCLA, USC and
California — open the Pac-8
tennis championships tomorrow
against both Oregon and
Washington schools in match-ups
that should be considered just
about as one-sided as the
Battle of Bull Run.
If you think that means that
the northerners don't have a
chance, then you're right. The
opening round of the tourney,
which will last all day at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium, pits
Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington and Washington
State against far stronger
opposition.
And if everything goes as the
pre-toumey seedings predict, it
will be an all-California semifinal
round on Friday. Cal (the No. 4
seed) meets Oregon St. (No. 5)
at 9 a.m. At the same time on
the varsity courts, third-seeded
USC squares off against
Washington (No. 6).
Stanford (No. 2) and Oregon
(No. 7), and UCLA (No. 1) and
Washington St. (No. 8) will play
tomorrow at 1 p.m. also on the
varsity courts.
Because UCLA, Stanford and
USC are the three top-ranked
teams in the nation, a first-round

upset is highly unlikely. The
only way a northern school has a
chance of slipping into the semis
is if Oregon St. edges out Cal.
If all the California teams do
win their opening round
matches, then Cal will meet
UCLA and Stanford will go
against USC in the semifinals.
The winners of those matches
would then play for the Pac-8
title on Saturday at the Tennis
Stadium and at Maples Pavilion.
For tennis fans, the logistics
of the tournament make
spectating easy. On Friday night,
the first singles of what should
be the UCLA-Cal match and the
first singles and first doubles of
what should be the
Stanford-USC pairing will all be
played at night in Maples.
Saturday night's Maples
matches will show off the first
and second singles, and first
doubles of the final match.
Faculty, staff and student
tickets are still on sale for all
matches at the Athletic
Department and at the gates.
