Security Council Meets On Seizure
WASHINGTON — With U.S. Marines headed for
Thailand as part of an apparent show of military force
over the Cambodian seizure of an American merchant
ship, President Ford conferred with his top national
security advisers in an hour and three-quarter session
stretching into this morning.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger joined Defense
Secretary James Schlesinger, CIA Director William Colby
and other members of the council in the late night session.
After the National Security Council meeting — the
second convened within 12 hours — ended at 12:25 a.m.
in Washington, there was no immediate word on what
decisions may have been reached to deal with the seizure.
In announcing the meeting, White House Press
Secretary Ron Nessen said the ship remained dead in the
water near Koh Tang Island about 30 miles off the
Cambodian coast.
Denying reports the vessel was moving toward an
undisclosed destination, Nessen said, "It's right where it
has been."
Refugee Aid Bill Goes To House
WASHINGTON — As Congress prepared to act on a
$405 million aid bill for Indochina refugees, the
100,000 th refugee arrived in Guam and more than 70
others Hied welfare applications in California.
The House Appropriations Committee approved the
$405 million appropriation yesterday morning, clearing
the way for action by the full House.
The same amount was approved Monday by the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
More than 115,000 refugees are already in the United
States or "in the pipeline" from processing points in the
Pacific, according to the interagency task force
coordinating resettlement efforts.
California state officials said they hoped the federal
government would foot the bill for refugees who go on
welfare. The state already has 2.5 million persons on its
welfare rolls.
"All we're doing is relying on assurances from the
federal government that all costs will be covered," said
Mario Obledo, California's secretary of health and welfare.
He said refugees are eligible for welfare benefits after
they leave Camp Pendleton and can register with
permanent addresses.
House Fails To Override Veto
WASHINGTON — The House failed yesterday to
override President Ford's veto of a one-year emergency
farm bill that critics said could increase food prices to
consumers and bring back production controls.
The bill was the first vetoed by Ford in the 94th
Congress and was endorsed by the Democratic leadership,
AFL-CIO and the Consumer Federation of America.
In other congressional action yesterday, the Senate
voted to limit debate on the controversial bill creating an
Agency for Consumer Advocacy inside the federal
government.
Supporters contend the vote makes certain the Senate
will adopt the consumer protection measure despite a veto
threat by President Ford.
National Police Spying Alleged
HOUSTON — The Houston Police Department has
refused to supply further information on noncriminal
activity to a nationwide intelligence cooperative after
allegations that the co-op spied on ordinary citizens,
police sources say.
The cooperative, called the Law Enforcement
Intelligence Unit (LEIU), is headquarterd in Long Beach
and operates a computerized information bank known as
the Interstate Organized Crime Index.
A high police source in Houston said his department
resigned from LEIU when it was asked by another LEIU
member to spy on a legitimate businessman.
The source said LEIU encouraged spying on ordinary
citizens through its network of member police agencies in
the United States and Canada and sanctioned the
collection and filing of "gutter gossip."
India Plans More Nuclear Experiments
NEW DELHI — One year after setting off its first
atomic explosion, India is planning new nuclear

experiments that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's
government insists will be only for peaceful purposes.
"The first test definitely was not our last, and we never
said it was," said one Indian official.
The timing of the next test has been a well-kept secret,
and there has been no firm indication that a definite date
has been set Nevertheless, Indian officials have confirmed
in a series of public comments that preparations are under
way for new explosions.
There is growing concern among Western diplomats
that India's next nuclear test will have serious
international repercussions, causing another setback to
normalization of relations with Pakistan and once again
increasing the danger of more countries deciding to go
nuclear.
SLA: Judge Denies Dismissal Request
SACRAMENTO — A defense attorney in the Marcus
Foster murder trial yesterday called the prosecution case
one of "shabbiness and weakness," but the judge refused
to dismiss the charges.
James Jenner, public defender for Russell Little, made
the motion after thumbing through heaps of evidence and
prosecution testimony in the seven-week-old trial.
Little and Joseph Remiro, avowed Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) members, are charged with
murder in the 1973 cyanide-bullet death of Foster, then
Oakland's superintendent of schools.
Jenner suggested that if Little and Remiro had not
been arrested, three fugitive SLA members — Patricia
Hearst and William and Emily Harris — could just as easily
have been charged with the crime.
"We see nothing, no indication that these gentlemen
Little and Remiro were involved in the shooting," Jenner
said.
Brown Doesn't See Malpractice 'Crisis'
SACRAMENTO — Thousands of hospital workers and
hundreds of anesthesiologists remained off the job as
California's burgeoning malpractice crisis continued
yesterday.
But California's young Democratic governor, Edmund
Brown Jr., backed away from describing the situation as a
crisis.
"A crisis? The word is over-used," he said. "I don't
want to throw the word around lightly."
Brown said he was considering whether to call a special
legislative session on the problem.
Jack Kirkpatrick, a California Hospital Association
spokesman, said 3000 hospital workers in San Francisco
have been laid off because over 300 anesthesiologists in
seven Northern California counties have walked off their
jobs in protest against high malpractice rates.

SACRAMENTO — Tepmsters will call a four-state

eight people were arrested as the two sides exchanged
insults, but there were no reports of violence.
