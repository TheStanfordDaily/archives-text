# Franklin Returns But Misses Rally
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
While some Stanford students
rallied yesterday, a predominant figure
in the 1970 protests here arrived on
campus — but too late to join them.
Here for a KZSU interview, former
Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin
said he missed the rally because of
previous commitments, but would
have "definitely" gone had he been
free. "I was really sorry to have missed
that," he said.
KZSU will broadcast the interview
next week.
Franklin, fired from his tenured
Stanford teaching position in 1971 for
"urging and inciting" disruption of
University operations, is in the Bay
Area to promote his new book, Back
Where You Came From: One Life in
the Heath of the Empire.
Commenting on the recent
nationwide wave of protests on college
campuses, Franklin stated that today's
students have "a higher level of
seriousness" than the students who
protested while he was at Stanford.
Students are not basing their
actions on naive ideas that a single
protest will stop the war in Vietnam,
he said. "Students have some sense of
the interrelations between the
economic structure and what's going
on in the world."
Franklin discussed the latest
developments in an American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) suit on his
behalf seeking to have the process by
which he was fired by Stanford
declared illegal.
The present procedural issue is
whether Franklin's attorneys have the
right to subpoena documents to prove
that Stanford is tax-funded.
Franklin said Stanford is public
because the state supplies the majority
of its funding. The University claims
that, as a private institution, it has a

right to hire and fire employees.
The ACLU also is suing the
University of Colorado Board of
Regents, who refused to hire Franklin
after the school's English Department
had recommended him. The ACLU
claims that Franklin, a noted Melville
scholar and Marxist, was denied the
position because of his political
beliefs.
Asked to document his remark
Sunday at Kepler's Bookstore in
Menlo Park that the FBI was involved
in both the University of Colorado and
Stanford's decisions, Franklin said his
attorneys had asked him not to discuss
specific kinds of evidence.
However, when presented with a
copy of a 1970 telegram indicating
that the agency canceled a proposed
FBI program of disruption of his
political activities, Franklin admitted
that the memo would be used as
evidence.
The name of the subject of the
FBl's planned disruption was blocked
out of the FBI document, but
Franklin asserted that the person was
"obviously me."
He emphasized that the telegram
provided evidence of "a change in FBI
plans. We know the FBI was working
very tightly with Stanford and we have
the documentary evidence of that."
Franklin recently secured a
teaching position at Rutgers University
in New Jersey for three years starting
next fall. Some state legislators have
objected to his politics but Franklin
remarked, "they're just making noise.
I have a legal contract and there's not
much they can do about it."
Franklin said he is looking forward
to his new job and to working with
students who have a "high level of
consciousness."
Commenting on the Rutgers
administration, Franklin chuckled,
"They're different from the Stanford
administration. They're pretty
enlightened and living in the 20th
century."

attorneys had asked him not to discuss
specific kinds of evidence.
However, when presented with a
copy of a 1970 telegram indicating
that the agency canceled a proposed
FBI program of disruption of his
political activities, Franklin admitted
that the memo would be used as
evidence.
The name of the subject of the
FBl's planned disruption was blocked
out of the FBI document, but
Franklin asserted that the person was
"obviously me."
He emphasized that the telegram
provided evidence of "a change in FBI
plans. We know the FBI was working
very tightly with Stanford and we have
the documentary evidence of that."
Franklin recently secured a
teaching position at Rutgers University
in New Jersey for three years starting
next fall. Some state legislators have
objected to his politics but Franklin
remarked, "they're just making noise.
I have a legal contract and there's not
much they can do about it."
Franklin said he is looking forward
to his new job and to working with
students who have a "high level of
consciousness."
Commenting on the Rutgers
administration, Franklin chuckled,
"They're different from the Stanford
administration. They're pretty
enlightened and living in the 20th
century."
While some Stanford students
rallied yesterday, a predominant figure
in the 1970 protests here arrived on
campus — but too late to join them.
Here for a KZSU interview, former
Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin
said he missed the rally because of
previous commitments, but would
have "definitely" gone had he been
free. "I was really sorry to have missed
that," he said.
KZSU will broadcast the interview
next week.
Franklin, fired from his tenured
Stanford teaching position in 1971 for
"urging and inciting" disruption of
University operations, is in the Bay
Area to promote his new book, Back
Where You Came From: One Life in
the Heath of the Empire.
Commenting on the recent
nationwide wave of protests on college
campuses, Franklin stated that today's
students have "a higher level of
seriousness" than the students who
protested while he was at Stanford.
Students are not basing their
actions on naive ideas that a single
protest will stop the war in Vietnam,
he said. "Students have some sense of
the interrelations between the
economic structure and what's going
on in the world."
Franklin discussed the latest
developments in an American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) suit on his
behalf seeking to have the process by
which he was fired by Stanford
declared illegal.
The present procedural issue is
whether Franklin's attorneys have the
right to subpoena documents to prove
that Stanford is tax-funded.
Franklin said Stanford is public
because the state supplies the majority
of its funding. The University claims
that, as a private institution, it has a

right to hire and fire employees.
The ACLU also is suing the
University of Colorado Board of
Regents, who refused to hire Franklin
after the school's English Department
had recommended him. The ACLU
claims that Franklin, a noted Melville
scholar and Marxist, was denied the
position because of his political
beliefs.
Asked to document his remark
Sunday at Kepler's Bookstore in
Menlo Park that the FBI was involved
in both the University of Colorado and
Stanford's decisions, Franklin said his
attorneys had asked him not to discuss
specific kinds of evidence.
