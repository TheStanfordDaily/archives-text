# Demonstrators Enter Old Union Protesting Aid Cuts, Iran Pact
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
About 350 demonstrators sat in
the lobby of the Old Union for over an
hour yesterday, protesting a University
research contract with Iran and
changes in financial aid programs for
minority students.
About 150 of the protestors,
including many Iranians, chanted and
marched in a picket line outside the
building. They later joined the others
in the lobby.
Inside the building, the relaxed
crowd sang protest songs, listened to
speeches, and cheered at the arrival of
a "lemonade brigade." Organizers
wearing light blue armbands patrolled
the "aisles," making sure there was
sufficient space for people to enter
and leave the building.
The marchers entered the building
around 2:10 p.m. and most left by
3:15. Plainclothes police officers and
Santa Clara County Sheriffs deputies
were at the scene, but no arrests were
made and no incidents of violence
were reported.
Earlier, at least 600 persons, mostly
students, marched across White Plaza
and rallied outside the Center for
Research and Development in
Teaching (SCRDT), in which the
Board of Trustees was holding its
monthly meeting.
Co-Sponsors
The protest was co-sponsored by
three groups: the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), the Iranian Students
Association (ISA) and the
Revolutionary Student Brigade (RSB).
Other campus groups, including
Students for Equity, endorsed the
rally.
Through University officials ARC
issued a statement asking the trustees
to terminate a three-year, $1 million
contract to develop a satellite system
for National Iranian Radio Television,
and to restore "cuts made in minority
student financial aid."
The demands were presented to the
trustees' Committee on Academic

Affairs yesterday morning by
President Richard Lyman. The trustees
asked Lyman some questions about
the issues but took no action, said
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president for
public affairs.
Rosenzweig said the trustees
probably did not discuss student
demands or the protest at their
afternoon meeting "because it wasn't
on their agenda."
No Response
The trustees' failure to respond to
the demands influenced the decision to
march on the Old Union, an ARC
source said.
A "Tactical Committee" apparently
planned and directed the
demonstration. "The Committee is
made up of three people from ARC
and two people from each of the other
[co-sponsoring) groups," the ARC
source said.
Seth Foldy, an undergraduate who
functioned as the Tactical
Committee's press secretary, said its
official policy was "to avoid
confrontation with police and to avoid
arrests."
Various factors, including the size
and composition of the crowd,
influenced the Tactical Committee's
decisions about which of several
contingency plans to use, the ARC
source said. "If there's no minority

support and you go in with demands
for minority aid it's kind of strange,"
he pointed out.
The two and a half hour
demonstration, which at times
involved more people than any
on-campus protest in the last two and
a half years, began at 12:55 p.m.
About 350 persons, most of them
non-minority students, gathered in
White Plaza to hear speakers introduce
the issues.
Few Minority Students
Asked why comparatively few
minority students were demonstrating,
ASSU Sen. Maria Echaveste of
Students for Equity said, "The
organizers of the rally put the financial
aids issue on the bottom. The Iran
contract was the main issue."
However, another speaker, Mike
Kieschnick of ARC, said the issues are
related because both show the
University's interest in "education for
profits, not for people."
At 1 p.m. the crowd formed a
column and marched in the direction
of the SCRDT building. They were
met by 120 Iranian students from
Southern California and San Jose, in
the middle of a march from Los
Angeles to San Francisco to protest
the Shah's upcoming visit to the U.S.
Members of the ASSU Council of
Presidents escorted some trustees to

the building. "The Council of
Presidents took no part in planning the
demonstration," Foldy said.
Once all the trustees had entered
the building, the marchers convened
on a nearby lawn, where speakers read
prepared statements and compard the
Stanford protest to others around the
nation.
On The Move
At about 2 p.m. ARC member Jan
Jacobson instructed the crowd to
"stay together and march through the
campus." Minutes later, the crowd
reached the Old Union Courtyard.
Information and transcript
windows were closed when protestors
entered the Old Union lobby. "I
believe it was Bob Houghton's decision
based on normal procedure when large
numbers of people enter the building,"
Registrar Sally Mahoney said.
Houghton, the associate registrar, said
it was Mahoney's decision.
Mahoney said the protest "has shut
us down, at least for now." But
business as usual prevailed on the
upper floors of the building, observers
said.
Rosenzweig, standing with other
administrators in the doorway, said he
did not consider the protest a "sit-in"
because the building was still open for
business.

AT THE OLD UNION—At the height of yesterday's demonstration, almost 350 demonstrators occupied the ground
floor of the Old Union Building. Although some offices were shut down during the occupation of the building
protesters were careful to keep passages open in hallways. President Richard Lyman, speaking on "Campus Conference,
said the administration planned to take no action against marchers.
Stanford Public Safety Officer Nick
Bruno arrived at the Old Union shortly
ahead of the bulk of the crowd and
ordered personnel to close windows
and doors. Three plainclothes
personnel from the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office circulated
freely through the crowd.
Lt. Robert E. Lees said all three
officers were from the sheriff's
Community Relations Office and were
"just observing." Lees said he had
known about the demonstration for
several days and "couldn't recall"
whether Stanford officials had
requested his presence on campus.
Although ARC spokesman stressed
a desire to avoid confrontation with
police, some demonstrators harrassed
Bruno outside the building when he
attempted to lock doors to the
Student Accounting Office. They
jeered at him and flashed a mirror in
his face.
Although there was no official
response to the demands yesterday,
ARC member Gerald Koblentz said
Vice Provost for Research William F.
Massy told him that the University
Committee on Research might meet
"sometime next week" to reconsider
research contract guidelines adopted in
1971.
Massy confirmed that a request to
convene the committee for that
purpose was being considered.

numbers of people enter the building,"
Registrar Sally Mahoney said.
Houghton, the associate registrar, said
it was Mahoney's decision.
Mahoney said the protest "has shut
us down, at least for now." But
business as usual prevailed on the
upper floors of the building, observers
said.
Rosenzweig, standing with other
administrators in the doorway, said he
did not consider the protest a "sit-in"
because the building was still open for
business.

AT THE OLD UNION—At the height of yesterday's demonstration, almost 350 demonstrators occupied the ground
floor of the Old Union Building. Although some offices were shut down during the occupation of the building
protesters were careful to keep passages open in hallways. President Richard Lyman, speaking on "Campus Conference,
said the administration planned to take no action against marchers.
Stanford Public Safety Officer Nick
Bruno arrived at the Old Union shortly
ahead of the bulk of the crowd and
ordered personnel to close windows
and doors. Three plainclothes
personnel from the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office circulated
freely through the crowd.
Lt. Robert E. Lees said all three
officers were from the sheriff's
Community Relations Office and were
"just observing." Lees said he had
known about the demonstration for
several days and "couldn't recall"
whether Stanford officials had
requested his presence on campus.
Although ARC spokesman stressed
a desire to avoid confrontation with
police, some demonstrators harrassed
Bruno outside the building when he
attempted to lock doors to the
Student Accounting Office. They
jeered at him and flashed a mirror in
his face.
Although there was no official
response to the demands yesterday,
ARC member Gerald Koblentz said
Vice Provost for Research William F.
Massy told him that the University
Committee on Research might meet
"sometime next week" to reconsider
research contract guidelines adopted in
1971.
Massy confirmed that a request to
convene the committee for that
purpose was being considered.

About 350 demonstrators sat in
the lobby of the Old Union for over an
hour yesterday, protesting a University
research contract with Iran and
changes in financial aid programs for
minority students.
About 150 of the protestors,
including many Iranians, chanted and
marched in a picket line outside the
building. They later joined the others
in the lobby.
Inside the building, the relaxed
crowd sang protest songs, listened to
speeches, and cheered at the arrival of
a "lemonade brigade." Organizers
wearing light blue armbands patrolled
the "aisles," making sure there was
sufficient space for people to enter
and leave the building.
The marchers entered the building
around 2:10 p.m. and most left by
3:15. Plainclothes police officers and
Santa Clara County Sheriffs deputies
were at the scene, but no arrests were
made and no incidents of violence
were reported.
Earlier, at least 600 persons, mostly
students, marched across White Plaza
and rallied outside the Center for
Research and Development in
Teaching (SCRDT), in which the
Board of Trustees was holding its
monthly meeting.
Co-Sponsors
The protest was co-sponsored by
three groups: the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), the Iranian Students
Association (ISA) and the
Revolutionary Student Brigade (RSB).
Other campus groups, including
Students for Equity, endorsed the
rally.
Through University officials ARC
issued a statement asking the trustees
to terminate a three-year, $1 million
contract to develop a satellite system
for National Iranian Radio Television,
and to restore "cuts made in minority
student financial aid."
The demands were presented to the
trustees' Committee on Academic

Affairs yesterday morning by
President Richard Lyman. The trustees
asked Lyman some questions about
the issues but took no action, said
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president for
public affairs.
Rosenzweig said the trustees
probably did not discuss student
demands or the protest at their
afternoon meeting "because it wasn't
on their agenda."
No Response
The trustees' failure to respond to
the demands influenced the decision to
march on the Old Union, an ARC
source said.
A "Tactical Committee" apparently
planned and directed the
demonstration. "The Committee is
made up of three people from ARC
and two people from each of the other
[co-sponsoring) groups," the ARC
source said.
Seth Foldy, an undergraduate who
functioned as the Tactical
Committee's press secretary, said its
official policy was "to avoid
confrontation with police and to avoid
arrests."
Various factors, including the size
and composition of the crowd,
influenced the Tactical Committee's
decisions about which of several
contingency plans to use, the ARC
source said. "If there's no minority

support and you go in with demands
for minority aid it's kind of strange,"
he pointed out.
The two and a half hour
demonstration, which at times
involved more people than any
on-campus protest in the last two and
a half years, began at 12:55 p.m.
About 350 persons, most of them
non-minority students, gathered in
White Plaza to hear speakers introduce
the issues.
Few Minority Students
Asked why comparatively few
minority students were demonstrating,
ASSU Sen. Maria Echaveste of
Students for Equity said, "The
organizers of the rally put the financial
aids issue on the bottom. The Iran
contract was the main issue."
However, another speaker, Mike
Kieschnick of ARC, said the issues are
related because both show the
University's interest in "education for
profits, not for people."
At 1 p.m. the crowd formed a
column and marched in the direction
of the SCRDT building. They were
met by 120 Iranian students from
Southern California and San Jose, in
the middle of a march from Los
Angeles to San Francisco to protest
the Shah's upcoming visit to the U.S.
Members of the ASSU Council of
Presidents escorted some trustees to

the building. "The Council of
Presidents took no part in planning the
demonstration," Foldy said.
Once all the trustees had entered
the building, the marchers convened
on a nearby lawn, where speakers read
prepared statements and compard the
Stanford protest to others around the
nation.
On The Move
At about 2 p.m. ARC member Jan
Jacobson instructed the crowd to
"stay together and march through the
campus." Minutes later, the crowd
reached the Old Union Courtyard.
Information and transcript
windows were closed when protestors
entered the Old Union lobby. "I
believe it was Bob Houghton's decision
based on normal procedure when large
numbers of people enter the building,"

Various factors, including the size
and composition of the crowd,
influenced the Tactical Committee's
decisions about which of several
contingency plans to use, the ARC
source said. "If there's no minority

support and you go in with demands
for minority aid it's kind of strange,"
he pointed out.
The two and a half hour
demonstration, which at times
involved more people than any
on-campus protest in the last two and
a half years, began at 12:55 p.m.
About 350 persons, most of them
non-minority students, gathered in
White Plaza to hear speakers introduce
the issues.
Few Minority Students
Asked why comparatively few
minority students were demonstrating,
ASSU Sen. Maria Echaveste of
Students for Equity said, "The
organizers of the rally put the financial
aids issue on the bottom. The Iran
contract was the main issue."
However, another speaker, Mike
Kieschnick of ARC, said the issues are
related because both show the
University's interest in "education for
profits, not for people."
At 1 p.m. the crowd formed a
column and marched in the direction
of the SCRDT building. They were
met by 120 Iranian students from
Southern California and San Jose, in
the middle of a march from Los
Angeles to San Francisco to protest
the Shah's upcoming visit to the U.S.
Members of the ASSU Council of
Presidents escorted some trustees to

the building. "The Council of
Presidents took no part in planning the
demonstration," Foldy said.
Once all the trustees had entered
the building, the marchers convened
on a nearby lawn, where speakers read
prepared statements and compard the
Stanford protest to others around the
nation.
On The Move
At about 2 p.m. ARC member Jan
Jacobson instructed the crowd to
"stay together and march through the
campus." Minutes later, the crowd
reached the Old Union Courtyard.
Information and transcript
windows were closed when protestors
entered the Old Union lobby. "I
believe it was Bob Houghton's decision
based on normal procedure when large
numbers of people enter the building,"
Registrar Sally Mahoney said.
Houghton, the associate registrar, said
it was Mahoney's decision.
Mahoney said the protest "has shut
us down, at least for now." But
business as usual prevailed on the
upper floors of the building, observers
said.
Rosenzweig, standing with other
administrators in the doorway, said he
did not consider the protest a "sit-in"
because the building was still open for
business.

AT THE OLD UNION—At the height of yesterday's demonstration, almost 350 demonstrators occupied the ground
floor of the Old Union Building. Although some offices were shut down during the occupation of the building
protesters were careful to keep passages open in hallways. President Richard Lyman, speaking on "Campus Conference,
said the administration planned to take no action against marchers.
Stanford Public Safety Officer Nick
Bruno arrived at the Old Union shortly
ahead of the bulk of the crowd and
ordered personnel to close windows
and doors. Three plainclothes
personnel from the Santa Clara
County sheriff's office circulated
freely through the crowd.
Lt. Robert E. Lees said all three
officers were from the sheriff's
Community Relations Office and were
"just observing." Lees said he had
known about the demonstration for
several days and "couldn't recall"
whether Stanford officials had
requested his presence on campus.
Although ARC spokesman stressed
a desire to avoid confrontation with
police, some demonstrators harrassed
Bruno outside the building when he
attempted to lock doors to the
Student Accounting Office. They
jeered at him and flashed a mirror in
his face.
Although there was no official
response to the demands yesterday,
ARC member Gerald Koblentz said
Vice Provost for Research William F.
Massy told him that the University
Committee on Research might meet
"sometime next week" to reconsider
research contract guidelines adopted in
1971.
Massy confirmed that a request to
convene the committee for that
purpose was being considered.

About 350 demonstrators sat in
the lobby of the Old Union for over an
hour yesterday, protesting a University
research contract with Iran and
changes in financial aid programs for
minority students.
About 150 of the protestors,
including many Iranians, chanted and
marched in a picket line outside the
building. They later joined the others
in the lobby.
Inside the building, the relaxed
crowd sang protest songs, listened to
speeches, and cheered at the arrival of
a "lemonade brigade." Organizers
wearing light blue armbands patrolled
the "aisles," making sure there was
sufficient space for people to enter
and leave the building.
The marchers entered the building
around 2:10 p.m. and most left by
3:15. Plainclothes police officers and
Santa Clara County Sheriffs deputies
were at the scene, but no arrests were
made and no incidents of violence
were reported.
Earlier, at least 600 persons, mostly
students, marched across White Plaza
and rallied outside the Center for
Research and Development in
Teaching (SCRDT), in which the
Board of Trustees was holding its
monthly meeting.
Co-Sponsors
The protest was co-sponsored by
three groups: the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), the Iranian Students
Association (ISA) and the
Revolutionary Student Brigade (RSB).
Other campus groups, including
Students for Equity, endorsed the
rally.
Through University officials ARC
issued a statement asking the trustees
to terminate a three-year, $1 million
contract to develop a satellite system
for National Iranian Radio Television,
and to restore "cuts made in minority
student financial aid."
The demands were presented to the
trustees' Committee on Academic

Affairs yesterday morning by
President Richard Lyman. The trustees
asked Lyman some questions about
the issues but took no action, said
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president for
public affairs.
Rosenzweig said the trustees
probably did not discuss student
demands or the protest at their
afternoon meeting "because it wasn't
on their agenda."
No Response
The trustees' failure to respond to
the demands influenced the decision to
march on the Old Union, an ARC
source said.
A "Tactical Committee" apparently
planned and directed the
demonstration. "The Committee is
made up of three people from ARC
and two people from each of the other
[co-sponsoring) groups," the ARC
source said.
Seth Foldy, an undergraduate who
functioned as the Tactical
Committee's press secretary, said its
official policy was "to avoid
confrontation with police and to avoid
arrests."
Various factors, including the size
and composition of the crowd,
influenced the Tactical Committee's
decisions about which of several
contingency plans to use, the ARC
source said. "If there's no minority
