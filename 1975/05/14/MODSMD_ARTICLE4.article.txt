# At Budget Forum
## Institutional Role Discussed 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Arguing in favor of encouraging
scholarship rather than "pedagogy,"
Human Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh
last night said that "American
universities have an identity problem
â€” do they really want to be
universities or a mixture of universities
and [liberal arts colleges]?"
Pittendrigh spoke at an open forum
on the budget process at Stanford

which metamorphized into a
wide-ranging discussion of the role of
Stanford as an institution.
About 40 persons attended the
forum at Meyer Library, whose
panelists also included Provost William
Miller, Dean of the Engineering School
William Kays and Cynthia Davis, a
student member of the Budget
Priorities Commission.
Pittendrigh said that a student
would be taught better at a college
such as Wooster, Reed, or Carleton
than at Stanford. "Universities are the
place for the student who wants to
learn, not to be taught."
He warned that if in tenure
decisions "pedagogy is made primary,
then scholarship will decay, and
instead of good universities, you'll
have excellent colleges."
In discussion more closely related
to the topic, Pittendrigh and Kays

debated whether the University should
increase the overhead it charges those
sponsoring research projects.
Pittendrigh said that the
University's current charge of 47
percent on research grants was too
low. Referring to the large number of
government grants, he added, "1 think
that universities ought to face up to
the fact of what [overhead] costs
really are and get the overhead out of
Uncle Sam."
But Kays said that there was "a
marketplace problem," as other
schools charge less overhead than does
Stanford, and that grants will be hard
to come by if Stanford further
increases its charge.
Miller said that Stanford was now
looking into raising its overhead
charge, to get "full recovery" of
overhead costs.
