U.S. Marines arrived in Thailand
before dawn today despite the
opposition of the Thai government,
the foreign ministry reported.
The ministry announced the arrival
of the marines a few minutes after
Premier Kukrit Pramoj told newsmen

which seized the ship Mayaguez and its
crew on Monday.
Warships of the 7th Fleet were also
reported moving toward the Gulf of
