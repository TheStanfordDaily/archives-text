# Mayaguez Still Captive; Marines Go To Thailand

BANGKOK (AP) - Eight hundred
U.S. Marines arrived in Thailand
before dawn today despite the
opposition of the Thai government,
the foreign ministry reported.
The ministry announced the arrival
of the marines a few minutes after
Premier Kukrit Pramoj told newsmen
he and his government opposed their
being sent by Washington to back up
American attempts to secure the
release of a merchant ship seized by
Cambodia's new communist
government.
Kukrit said that if the Marines

came, "we cannot be friends with the
United States any more."
The premier said he had received no
official communication from the U.S.
government concerning the Marines.
Pentagon sources reported the plans
to send Marines a few hours after the
Thai prime minister said air bases in
his country could not be used for
military operations against Cambodia,
which seized the ship Mayaguez and its
crew on Monday.
Warships of the 7th Fleet were also
reported moving toward the Gulf of
Thailand but were expected to arrive
sometime today. Pentagon sources said
the aircraft carrier Coral Sea, bound
for Australia, had been turned around
and was headed toward the gulf.
The Mayaguez radioed Monday that
it was fired on by a Cambodian
gunboat and boarded about 55 miles
off the Cambodian coast, near Poulo
Wai, a rocky island the White House
believes to be claimed by both
Cambodia and South Vietnam.
U.S. officials said air reconnaissance
found the ship had been moved to the
island of Koh Tang, some 30 miles
from the Cambodian coast, under
escort of two gunboats. Utapao Air
Base is about 200 miles from Koh
Tang. None of the 39-man crew was
reported hurt.
President Ford repeated earlier
demands that Cambodia release the
ship immediately or face "serious
consequences." Washington sources,
however, said Ford hoped to recover
the ship through diplomatic channels,
reportedly using China and other
countries as intermediaries.
