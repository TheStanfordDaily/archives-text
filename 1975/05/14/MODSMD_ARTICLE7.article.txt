## Graduation 
### 
The University's decision to confer all Humanities and
Sciences degrees in a massive Frost Amphitheater
ceremony during commencement rather than holding
separate departmental ceremonies as has been done in the
past seems objectionable on several counts.
The case for canceling the popular small ceremonies
seems somewhat flimsy. University officials claim that
the expense of setting up chairs made costs prohibitive:
Director of Public Events Tom Bacchetti stated that
axing the separate ceremonies would save $10,000. But
we think that the University should have given stronger
consideration to alternate methods of saving money; for
example, small ceremonies could be held indoors in
auditoriums where no chairs would have to be moved or
student volunteers could be persuaded to set up chairs
and equipment where needed.
But more disturbing is the fact that the students, who
are most affected by the change in procedure, did not
have a chance to voice their opinions. We think many
would disagree vigorously with Bacchetti's assertion that
"the change maintains all the elements of
commencement as we know it."
Awarding all diplomas in the huge amphitheater will
do much to depersonalize the ceremony. For each
student, whose name will now be called from a list of
over 1000, the ceremony will become mesmerizingly long
and dull, when it should be an involving experience.
The value of the small departmental ceremonies must
have been obvious to administration officials who five
years ago decided to change from the procedure they are
now planning to reinstate. Graduating students deserve
something better than the planned Frost marathon. It is
unfortunate that the senior class officers were not
effective in bringing the students' perspective to the
decision-making officials.
Even the way that the decision was announced to the
students — in a relatively informal remark by Vice
President Robert Rosenzweig on KZSU's Campus
Conference last week — seems irresponsible. We urge the
University to reconsider its decision, this time paying far
closer attention to the views of those for whom the
commencement ceremony should hold the most meaning.
