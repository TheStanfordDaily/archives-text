# Avoid Violence
## 
### 
An unqualified and
disconcerting enthusiasm for
militant movements is spreading
among politically conscious
people in this country. Here at
Stanford, some "celebrate" the
end of the war in Vietnam and
speak of "a victory for all
humanity."
At a lecture on Iran, the
audience applauds the recent
assassination of two notoriously
brutal police agents. No one
talks about nonviolence.
Clearly, the bulk of the
responsibility for the disaster in
Vietnam must fall on us. We did
not support the wrong side, we
Were the wrong side, as Daniel
Ellsberg said.
Yet, in our desire to
understand our error, we must
not blind ourselves to the folly
of the North Vietnamese and
Vietcong.
War Unnecessary
In justifying their cause, we
need not accept their methods.
Gandhi effectively harassed the
British in India; so too, perhaps
the Vietnamese could have
removed the French and the
Americans without war. At least
it would have been worth the
attempt.
Our rejection of military
organizations and military values
should extend beyond the
Pentagon to include all military
establishments.

No war, except possibly
World War 11, has justified the
shedding of blood, neither the
American Revolution nor the
war in Vietnam.
The end of the fighting
should not be greeted with
"celebration" but with somber
relief. There are no real victors.
Vietnam has not risen, it has
only stopped sinking.
Nonviolence Possible
Could the resistance in Iran
employ nonviolent tactics?
Maybe not, but again, it would
have been worth the attempt.
Perhaps there are regimes,
Hitler's Germany for example,
whose brutality and
imperviousness to civil
disobedience justify violent
revolt.
However, even for those who
believe that killing is sometimes
a necessary evil, to applaud an
assassination like an opera or a
touchdown reveals a callous and
superficial insensitivity to the
tragedy of that necessity.
In our guilt, let us not
idealize the North Vietnamese.
In our disgust with totalitarian
regimes, let us not forget that
killing for a cause destroys
something of that cause. Most
importantly, let deliberate
thought, not reactions to
rhetoric, determine one's stand
on nonviolence.
