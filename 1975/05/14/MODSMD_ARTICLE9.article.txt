# Minority Aids, Moynihan Linked
## 
### 
As one who is all too familiar with the
green hills and closed minds of Stanford, I
suppose that I should not be surprised by
the administration's latest moves to create a
passive and homogenous student body by
reneging on whatever small commitment to
minorities which existed in the admissions
and financial aids policies of the University.
Nor, I suppose, should I be surprised by
the fact that this year's commencement
speaker is Daniel P. Moynihan, a choice
which is not only questionable in light of
any academic standards, but is also an insult
to black members of the Stanford
community.
Yet I am surprised.
I find it hard to believe that the
administration and the commencement
speaker selection committee could so
blatantly disregard the demands of social
justice and responsibility to minorities
which have for centuries suffered at the
hands of white America.
I have heard the labels "reverse racism"
and "reverse discrimination" applied to
admissions and aid policies which show
some favor to blacks, chicanos, and other
minorities, and am tempted to ram my foot
down the throat of the next individual I

hear applying them.
After 300 years of slavery, lynchings,
and imprisonment in urban hellholes
maintained by white discrimination, blacks
have finally arrived at the ultimate
absurdity: they are accused of racism for
their efforts to break free from the chains
of a racist society.
Racism implies, first, a belief in the
inherent superiority of one race, and
secondly, the power to express that belief in
the social sphere.
Neither element enters into play in an
analysis of affirmative action admissions
and financial aids policies. Such policies are
a small attempt to recognize the effects
which year upon year of white racism and
its institutional forms have had on the
possibilities for fulfillment and
self-determination of minority groups in the
United States.
The policies are discriminatory, true, but
this discrimination is not only justified, but
demanded, by a full consideration of the
degraded existence, with limited avenues of
escape, which white society has attempted
to create for minorities in the United States.
Moynihan has maintained that the
problems of blacks are no longer the result

of white racism, but rather are intrinsic to
the situation of the broken black family;
the problems are self-perpetuating: lack of
initiative, non-alignment with the
achievement goals common to white
Americans.
Assuming this, he advocates an attitude
of "benign neglect" toward black America.
Stanford is apparently going to follow this
advice by emphasizing "solely economic
criteria" in its aids policy, disregarding
criteria of race and social context.
Moynihan's studies of the black family
are outrageous, yet they continue to exert a
powerful influence in high circles in the
U.S. The minority aids controversy is an
example of the readiness of elite white
institutions to discard the facade of social
responsibility, using half-baked
social-scientific analyses of the Moynihan
type to legitimate their actions. The
administration wants a prestigious elite to
attend the University, a smiling compliment
to the "value free" research orientation of
Stanford. This trend must be fought be
concerned individuals connected with the
University.
