# Committee Reports To Affect Extra-Departmental Programs
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The future structure of
extra-departmental programs (EDP's)
will be strongly influenced by two
committee reports currently being
prepared for release within the next
few weeks.
The reports about SWOPSI, SCIRE
and Undergraduate Specials deal with
how the various programs should
relate to each other and how the

EDP's should relate to the University
as a whole, starting in 1976-77.
The Ad Hoc Panel on the Future of
the Extra-Departmental Programs,
established by Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, is discussing
what the "staffing patterns" of
the programs should look like and
what the "link with the dean's office
should look like," according to SCIRE
Director Alice Supton.

Though the final report is still being
written by a drafting subcommittee of
the panel headed by Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies B. Michael
Closson, Supton said that the
programs will "retain much of their
present look" though there "will be
significant changes in staffing."
'Faculty Dean'
ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton, a
member of the ad hoc panel, said that
much discussion has centered around
Gibbs' proposal of a half-time "faculty
dean" who would oversee the quality
of the EDP's.
Silton criticized this proposal,
stating that Gibbs' main concern was
how to justify the programs "in the
eyes of the faculty, getting away from
the very reasons SWOPSI and SCIRE
were created."
The panel is also debating whether
to recommend a half-time professional
director and a half-time student
director for SWOPSI, according to
Silton.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) is considering the
position of an "undergraduate
education officer" on a broad scale,
according to C-US member and ASSU
President Lee Rosenbaum.
Three Possibilities
He said the committee is
considering three possibilities for the
officer:
—an independent dean, similar to
Gibbs' position (though the office's
structure could differ);
—a vice provost;
—an associate dean in the School
of Humanities and Sciences (H&S).
Rosenbaum indicated that the
committee thus far had mostly been
accepting input of ideas and only
"arguing" yesterday.
He said that discussion dealt "with
what an undergraduate education

officer should do." As the committee
determines this, he explained, it
should become "apparent where the
office should be placed."
C-US will be making its
recommendation to Provost William
Miller, who charged the committee
with its duty.
'More Flexibility'
Supton pointed out that though the
ad hoc panel's recommendations deal
with the three programs currently in
the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, they will "still
be able to be applied somewhere else,"
under the undergraduate education
officer decided upon by C-US.

what the "link with the dean's office
should look like," according to SCIRE
Director Alice Supton.

Though the final report is still being
written by a drafting subcommittee of
the panel headed by Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies B. Michael
Closson, Supton said that the
programs will "retain much of their
present look" though there "will be
significant changes in staffing."
'Faculty Dean'
ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton, a
member of the ad hoc panel, said that
much discussion has centered around
Gibbs' proposal of a half-time "faculty
dean" who would oversee the quality
of the EDP's.
Silton criticized this proposal,
stating that Gibbs' main concern was
how to justify the programs "in the
eyes of the faculty, getting away from
the very reasons SWOPSI and SCIRE
were created."
The panel is also debating whether
to recommend a half-time professional
director and a half-time student
director for SWOPSI, according to
Silton.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) is considering the
position of an "undergraduate
education officer" on a broad scale,
according to C-US member and ASSU
President Lee Rosenbaum.
Three Possibilities
He said the committee is
considering three possibilities for the
officer:
—an independent dean, similar to
Gibbs' position (though the office's
structure could differ);
—a vice provost;
—an associate dean in the School
of Humanities and Sciences (H&S).
Rosenbaum indicated that the
committee thus far had mostly been
accepting input of ideas and only
"arguing" yesterday.
He said that discussion dealt "with
what an undergraduate education

officer should do." As the committee
determines this, he explained, it
should become "apparent where the
office should be placed."
C-US will be making its
recommendation to Provost William
Miller, who charged the committee
with its duty.
'More Flexibility'
Supton pointed out that though the
ad hoc panel's recommendations deal
with the three programs currently in
the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, they will "still
be able to be applied somewhere else,"
under the undergraduate education
officer decided upon by C-US.
The future structure of
extra-departmental programs (EDP's)
will be strongly influenced by two
committee reports currently being
prepared for release within the next
few weeks.
The reports about SWOPSI, SCIRE
and Undergraduate Specials deal with
how the various programs should
relate to each other and how the

EDP's should relate to the University
as a whole, starting in 1976-77.
The Ad Hoc Panel on the Future of
the Extra-Departmental Programs,
established by Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, is discussing
what the "staffing patterns" of
the programs should look like and
what the "link with the dean's office
should look like," according to SCIRE
