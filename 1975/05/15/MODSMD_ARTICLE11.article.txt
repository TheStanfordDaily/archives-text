# Political Activism-Welcome Revival
## 
### 
It's good to see a return to politics at
Stanford. Political movements have a
certain ebb and flow — periods of
hyperactivity are followed by periods of
consolidation, education and base-building.
The Alliance for Radical Change (ARC) at
Stanford has been doing the important and
steady work of education and issue-raising
in what had seemed to be a period of less
public political activity.
Now ARC's day-to-day political work
has catalyzed new and massive participation
in politics here. The occupation of the Old
Union Tuesday has made Stanford's
development project in Iran a subject of
intense discussion and consideration
throughout the Stanford community.
The Iran communications development
project has to be seen in its full context.
Throughout the 20th century, American
business leaders and government officials
concerned with international affairs have
been trying to mold the world in America's
image and to gain special monopoly
privileges for influential American
businesses. To do this, America's rulers have
sought to prevent social revolutions which
aimed at throwing off the burden of
oppression and feudalism that has been
borne by the mass of the people in poor
countries.
World's Policeman
The American suppression of the
Filipino independence movement following
the Spanish-American war and American
participation in the anti-Bolshevik invasions
of Russia following the 1917 revolution are
the direct ancestors of the Vietnam war and
of U.S. support of Iran's policing of the
Persian Gulf area.
In recent days, the U.S. government's
response to the Gulf of Thailand ship
seizure confirms that American
decision-makers still aspire to global

hegemony and the role of world policeman.
(American shipping companies should
operate at their own risk. American
taxpayers should not be afflicted with
maintaining a global gendarmerie, nor
should minor ship seizures have the
potential to spark a Great Power war.)
A major aspect of American efforts at
global hegemony is the guiding of
"modernization" around the world. The
corporate liberals' favorite programs like

foreign economic aid and technical
assistance all serve the purpose of
subordinating economic activities in foreign
lands to goals of American planners and
business figures. The vision which inspires
American foreign policy makers is one in
which all countries are made over on the
model of the American welfare-warfare
state.
Props Up Shah
Knowledge of these goals of American
policy-makers places the Iran development
project in its proper light. Despite the
benign rhetoric of aid and assistance, what
we have here is another case of
American-guided modernization combined
with the propping up of a brutal feudal
despot — the Shah of Iran.
The technocratic, social-engineering
values underlying the Iran development
project were unconsciously revealed by

Prof. Bruce Lusignan's comment (Daily,
May 13) that a major thing which justified
the whole project to him was the fact he
would be able to cooperate with the Iranian
government's planners.
These are the values behind the project;
the effective goals of such communications
and educational programs are social control.
Professors Martin Camoy and Henry Levin
of the School of Education have focused in
their writings on the uses of centralized
communications networks. Because such
networks offer tight control over
information, "such centrally controlled
educational systems are particularly
appealing to authoritarian societies."
Repression
In addition, the Iran development
project has more direct potential for
repression. As Seth Foldy noted in the May
issue of Grapevine: "The Stanford contract
with [National Iranian Radio and
Television] will place in the hands of the
Shah and [his secret police] a highly
sophisticated communications system that
will bring every Iranian village into the
reach of the regime's monopoly
telecommunications network. Telephone
and teletype systems will link the entire
countryside.
"A massive date retrieval software
program, similar to the ... system .. . used
by the Thieu regime in South Vietnam to
keep track of civilian ID cards, is also being
evaluated under this contract."
Members of the Stanford community
who want to see justice done should
welcome the return of political activism to
the campus and support the campaign
against the Iran project.

project were unconsciously revealed by

Prof. Bruce Lusignan's comment (Daily,
May 13) that a major thing which justified
the whole project to him was the fact he
would be able to cooperate with the Iranian
government's planners.
These are the values behind the project;
the effective goals of such communications
and educational programs are social control.
Professors Martin Camoy and Henry Levin
of the School of Education have focused in
their writings on the uses of centralized
communications networks. Because such
networks offer tight control over
information, "such centrally controlled
educational systems are particularly
appealing to authoritarian societies."
Repression
In addition, the Iran development
project has more direct potential for
repression. As Seth Foldy noted in the May
issue of Grapevine: "The Stanford contract
with [National Iranian Radio and
Television] will place in the hands of the
Shah and [his secret police] a highly
sophisticated communications system that
will bring every Iranian village into the
reach of the regime's monopoly
telecommunications network. Telephone
and teletype systems will link the entire
countryside.
"A massive date retrieval software
program, similar to the ... system .. . used
by the Thieu regime in South Vietnam to
keep track of civilian ID cards, is also being
evaluated under this contract."
Members of the Stanford community
who want to see justice done should
welcome the return of political activism to
the campus and support the campaign
against the Iran project.

It's good to see a return to politics at
Stanford. Political movements have a
certain ebb and flow — periods of
hyperactivity are followed by periods of
consolidation, education and base-building.
The Alliance for Radical Change (ARC) at
Stanford has been doing the important and
steady work of education and issue-raising
in what had seemed to be a period of less
public political activity.
Now ARC's day-to-day political work
has catalyzed new and massive participation
in politics here. The occupation of the Old
Union Tuesday has made Stanford's
development project in Iran a subject of
intense discussion and consideration
throughout the Stanford community.
The Iran communications development
project has to be seen in its full context.
Throughout the 20th century, American
business leaders and government officials
concerned with international affairs have
been trying to mold the world in America's
image and to gain special monopoly
privileges for influential American
businesses. To do this, America's rulers have
sought to prevent social revolutions which
aimed at throwing off the burden of
oppression and feudalism that has been
borne by the mass of the people in poor
countries.
World's Policeman
The American suppression of the
Filipino independence movement following
the Spanish-American war and American
participation in the anti-Bolshevik invasions
of Russia following the 1917 revolution are
the direct ancestors of the Vietnam war and
of U.S. support of Iran's policing of the
Persian Gulf area.
In recent days, the U.S. government's
response to the Gulf of Thailand ship
seizure confirms that American
decision-makers still aspire to global

hegemony and the role of world policeman.
(American shipping companies should
operate at their own risk. American
taxpayers should not be afflicted with
maintaining a global gendarmerie, nor
should minor ship seizures have the
potential to spark a Great Power war.)
A major aspect of American efforts at
global hegemony is the guiding of
"modernization" around the world. The
corporate liberals' favorite programs like

foreign economic aid and technical
assistance all serve the purpose of
subordinating economic activities in foreign
lands to goals of American planners and
business figures. The vision which inspires
American foreign policy makers is one in
which all countries are made over on the
model of the American welfare-warfare
state.
Props Up Shah
Knowledge of these goals of American
policy-makers places the Iran development
project in its proper light. Despite the
benign rhetoric of aid and assistance, what
we have here is another case of
American-guided modernization combined
with the propping up of a brutal feudal
despot — the Shah of Iran.
The technocratic, social-engineering
values underlying the Iran development
project were unconsciously revealed by

Prof. Bruce Lusignan's comment (Daily,
May 13) that a major thing which justified
the whole project to him was the fact he
would be able to cooperate with the Iranian
