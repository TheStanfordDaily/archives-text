Foundations Gave More
Editor:
The May 9 Daily correctly
reported that George Capron's
gift was the third largest ever
received by Stanford from an
individual.
It was incorrect, however, in
reporting that "a number of
corporations have contributed
larger sums."
The correct statement is that
some foundations have
contributed larger sums.

Iran Edit Distorted
Editor:
The May 5 Daily editorial
regarding Communication Prof.
Edwin Parker's contract with

Iran to provide satellite
communication facilities caught
my attention for two reasons.
First, because such advanced
systems are of interest in my
own work (computer
communication networks) and
second, because I do not believe
the Daily has all the facts, and
has consequently rendered an
unfair judgment against the
Communication Department and
Parker.
It is hard to imagine what
kind of proof of intention the
Shah could offer to satisfy the
Daily's requirements, but my
personal experience in Iran with
the well-funded Free University
of Iran indicates that substantial
financial support has betn

allocated for a long-term modern
educational facility organized
along the lines of the British
Open University.
Educational programs to
improve rural development, train
secondary school teachers and
develop paramedical resources
are planned in the early stages of
this university. The satellite
facility is essential to the success
of the project since existing
microwave facilities do not reach
the rural areas.
I think the manner in which
the Shah has allocated funds for
the industrialization of Iran and
the education of its people
clearly shows that the
motivation for the domestic
satellite system is far beyond
mere political propaganda.
To be sure, there are aspects
of the regime there with which I
do not agree, but on the whole, I
think the Daily's criticism, while
doubtless well intended, is
unwarranted.

Aid Not Reduced
Editor:
The flyer distributed Monday
on White Plaza seems to create
the impression that there will be
a reduction next year in student
aid. Such will clearly not be the
case. It can be estimated at the
present time that approximately
$1,996,000 in additional
support will be available next
year to undergraduate students.
Of this total amount,
approximately $1.4 million will
be in gift aid, including about
$250,000 more to minority
students. Despite the difficult
financial circumstances of the
University at this time,
$501,000 in general funds
beyond the current level have
been allocated to undergraduate
scholarships and grants for
1975-76.
The increase in undergraduate
aid comes as a consequence of
the higher tuition and room and
board rates which will be in
effect next year as well as from a
reduction in the expected
parental contributions brought
about bv modifications in the
need assessment procedures of
the College Scholarship Service.

As a result of the latter
changes, the University has had
to ask all freshman students on
aid to assume a greater amount
of their support in loans and
jobs (self-help). For minority
students, this has meant
establishing a self-help
expectation in the first year.
Principally as a result of input
from minority students, the
self-help expectation of $300 for
freshman minority students
from low-income circumstances
has been kept significantly lower
than the amount originally
proposed.
While middle and
upper-income freshman minority
students will have a larger
self-help expectation the first
year ($800), this amount remains
substantially below the standard
self-help figure of $1400.
