# Fetus Is Not Human

Recently, Boston was the
center of a week of effort to
defend Dr. Ken Edelin and
women's right to choose.
Edelin' was convicted of
manslaughter two months ago
for performing a legal abortion.
The verdict was condemned by
prominent Boston medical
professionals, including the head
of Edelin's hospital, who asked
Edelin to return to work the
next day.
After such a travesty of
justice, and in support of Edelin,
it becomes necessary to examine
the arguments of those who are
seeking to remove a woman's
right to choose.
One such argument claims
that a fetus is a person and that
therefore abortion is the same as
murder. However, this argument
rests on the assumption that it is
widely believed that a fetus is
human.
Populist Law
This is an important point
since our laws supposedly reflect
the beliefs of the population,
especially on a subject such as
murder. Yet the belief that a
fetus is human is based more on
one's religious and political
tendencies.
A study published in the
American Journal of Public
Health has questioned people in
the medical professions about
when they believed life began.
Catholics, fundamentalists and
conservatives all generally
believed that life begins at
conception. Other religious
groups and liberals did not hold
this view.
This study shows that
abortion is not something that
almost all people in our society
think is wrong. It is, instead, a
religious and political belief. The
choice to have an abortion is
indeed a moral one, but the
United States is based on the
tenet that the state will not
prescribe an individual's
morality. It is a choice for every
woman to make for herself.
Certain people within the
Catholic Church are, however,
trying to force Catholics to
support its views by refusing
them the sacraments, as was
done in San Diego recently.
Volumes Of Evidence
Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.)
recently introduced volumes of
evidence showing that people
approved of legalized abortion.
For example, persons in the 18th
district of California (generally
considered to be conservative
Republican) were asked last
summer which course of action
they wished Congress to follow;
69.5 percent said that Congress
should do nothing.
It is interesting to note that
in 1869, the Catholic Church
changed its official stance. For
1800 years, it did not believe
that life began at conception.
The American Civil Liberties
Union has stated that the
abortion issue will ultimately be
resolved in this Congress. A
massive volume of letters is
needed from civil libertarians
and supporters of women's
rights to hold back the
anti-right-of-choice groups,
heavily financed by the Catholic
Church, from sending women
back into the hands of
back-room butchers.
