Did weeds grow in the Garden of Eden?—E.E.
The Department of Religious Studies is
apparently split on this quest.
"Did weeds grow? I imagine they did," said
Asst. Prof. Jerry Irish, "Of course the problem
there was finding a gardener."
But Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the
chapel, contradicted Irish. "Weeds didn't grow in
the garden ... absolutely not," Kelly said. He
cited Genesis, Chapter Three, verses 17-18, where
God tells Adam, "Cursed is the ground because of
you. In toil you shall eat of it all the days of your
life. Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to
you."
"I suggest that that shows that the coming of
weeds upon the earth was the result of man's
sin," Kelly asserted.

Is the old man still running Swensen's Ice Cream
in Palo Alto? I think his name is Gary. Recently I
went into the store and the ice cream seemed less
rich (I like this more crispy texture) and there
was an older woman running the store. Has
something changed?—H.M.
The "old man" to whom you are referring is
Neale Fountain, the Swensen's manager who quit
on March 21, according to Karen Lytle, counter
person at Swensen's. The change in the ice cream
is apparently due to a new machine which was
installed around the beginning of March.
However, the ice cream's ingredients have
remained unchanged, she said.

Is it true that someone actually died in the stacks
of the main library and wasn't found until three
days later?—G.K.
"Oh, I hope not," said Mary Sevilla, assistant
chief of circulation, between gasps of laughter.
"Did the person say when this supposedly
happened? I mean, did he stumble over the
body?"
Further investigation produced a flat denial
from Gloria Stockton, chief of central circulation.
"As far as I know, and as far as Phil Leighton
[building project manager of the University
libraries] knows, the story is erroneous," she said.

Are all the possible structures for student housing
being used? What about the many old Row
houses near the new law school, and Ventura
Hall, near Hansen Labs? What are they used
for?—C.E.
Assoc. Dean of Students Larry Horton said
that his office has a "standing call-out" for
available housing. "I really like the idea of
converting these old houses," Horton said. "But
it's not going to do anybody a favor to renovate a
house that houses just a few students and doesn't
fit into the residence program."
Horton said that most of the housing
possibilities have been considered and rejected.
Mariposa House, for example, was turned down
because it had no kitchen and would cost too
much to renovate. However, he encouraged
students to call his office if they had suggestions.
