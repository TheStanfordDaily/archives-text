# Economics And The Prostitute: A Case Of Supply And Demand
## 
### DAN WATKISS 
"There's only one thing that
differentiates a hooker from a
woman in a singles bar or a
student who meets a fellow at
the library and takes him with
her back to the dorm — and
that's cash," said Carol Silver,
legal counsel to Sheriff Richard
Hongisto in San Francisco.
Silver, a candidate for San
Francisco district attorney,
and Margo St James, head of the
"loose women's association,"
COYOTE, spoke on campus as
guests of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau last week. Both are
actively campaigning to
decriminalize prostitution.
Both speakers put moralistic
"shoulds" and "oughts" aside
and agreed that the real
argument for decriminalization
is an ecomonic one. "An average
of 50 percent of money allotted
for criminal justice in this
country goes to the prosecution
of victimless crimes:
prostitution-, pot,
homosexuality, etc," said Silver.
She said the money should be
used to help prevent "real"
crimes.
"While San Francisco cops
are out chasing prostitutes in the
Tenderloin, there's some little
old lady down the block being
robbed of her welfare check,"
St. James said.
'Oppressive' Prosecution
Criminal prosecution of the
prostitute is a form of economic
oppression, claimed both
speakers.
"There are two reasons why
women hook," maintained St.
James. "Number one is money,
and second is adventure, but it's
mostly money."
She painted the scenario of
unskilled, low-income women,
seeking financial independence
in a world that relegates women
to the status of mere financial
parasites living off the bankrolls
of their male counterparts.
"Most hookers that I know are
highly independent people who
have decided they won't kiss
ass," confided St. James.
This oppression, she
continued, falls hardest on
minority women. Unable to find
work elsewhere, they frequently
turn to prostitution as their sole
means of support. They are also
the most frequent victims of
police brutality. "The cops
usually beat them, since bruises
don't show on black skin," said
St. James.
'Zealot' Squad
The city of San Francisco
spends $900,000 a year on its
vice squad, "the department in
which the police put all of their
zealots and nuts so they won't

cause problems doing anything
of importance," St. James
asserted. The vice squad is
generally assigned to
investigating prostitution and
other "victimless crimes."
An ex-call girl herself, St.
James doubted that as many
women would become
prostitutes if the monetary
incentives were less. The work,
however, "is in many respects
very rewarding," she added.
"And so long as there is a
demand for the prostitute,
in spite of ever-enlarging vice
squads, there has always been —
and probably always will be — a
supply," she noted, as if giving a
lecture on elementary
economics.
In support of her
supply-and-demand thesis, she
summarized the history of
prostitution in the Western
world, citing references to it in
the Old Testament where the
Hebrews are warned against
prostituting their daughters.
Supply And Demand
During the frontier days of
California there was a large
supply of prostitutes. "It was
very well accepted then. Not
until World War II did
prosecution begin under the
assumption that prostitutes
spread V.D., and V.D. caused a
loss in manpower."
When asked if prostitution

was in fact a victimless crime,
both Silver and St. James cited
statistics to counter contentions
that prostitution involved theft
and the spread of venereal
disease.
"It's teenagers who spread
V.D. Public health officials tell
the kids to practice abstinence,
and then wonder why V.D. runs
rampant. The public then
chooses to ignore teenage ( sex,
and as always the prostitute
becomes the scapegoat," Silver
claimed.
In an attempt to protect
prostitutes from becoming
society's scapegoats, St. James
formed COYOTE in the early
'60s, soon after she was
arrested for prostitution in San
Francisco. The organization
offers needy women clothing,
shelter and legal services. St.
James focuses her own efforts
on legislation. This week she will
introduce a bill in Sacramento
that would decriminalize
prostitution.
St. James doesn't favor
legalization, she says, only
decriminalization. "The
government should keep out of
the bedroom. If it were
legalized, that would make Jerry
Ford into a pimp. I don't know
about you, but I don't want him
to be my pimp."
As a secondary argument for
decriminalization, St. James

addressed the social auspices of
her erstwhile profession.
Professional Bent
"The call girl is a
para-professional therapist,
dealing with a substantially
white, middle-class clientele,"
said St. James. She is sought out
by men who "need someone to
feel comfortable with .. . espec
ially since women's lib has got
most men scared shitless." There
are other men "who need to
think they're in love," and then
there are businessmen "who
want to put prospective clients
in a good mood" before the
signing of contracts.
Another large segment of
"the industry's" clientele comes
from married men who "can't
get good sex at home. Most
wives won't give ... (oral
sex)... so the men come to
whores to get it," revealed St.
James.
A prostitute can help make a
man into a better lover, she
continued. "If he's botching
something, she tells him how to
do it right. A wife can't tell her
husband that, she can't
embarrass him like that," noted
St. James.
When asked if many women
seek the services of male
prostitutes, she maintained that
there is really no market.
"Women want it, but they can't
afford it." Facetiously she added
that she keeps a stable of men
on hand for desiring females.
"The industry does really
quite well during depressions,"
said St. James. "When things are
tough men try to maximize the
pleasure they get from a dollar,
so they go to a whore instead of
a movie.
"We're getting so popular
nowadays that the people up in
Pacific Heights are throwing a
coming out party for COYOTE
later this month. You all know
about 'radical chic,'"she jested.
At the end of the
presentation, St. James sold
COYOTE t-shirts to members of
the audience. The shirts were
from the organization's 1974
convention and read
"1974—Year of the Whore." She
said this year's model carries the
motto, "My Ass Is My Own."
"There's only one thing that
differentiates a hooker from a

student who meets a fellow at

prostitutes from becoming
society's scapegoats, St. James
formed COYOTE in the early
'60s, soon after she was
arrested for prostitution in San
Francisco. The organization
offers needy women clothing,
shelter and legal services. St.
James focuses her own efforts
on legislation. This week she will
introduce a bill in Sacramento
that would decriminalize
prostitution.
St. James doesn't favor
legalization, she says, only
decriminalization. "The
government should keep out of
the bedroom. If it were
legalized, that would make Jerry
Ford into a pimp. I don't know
about you, but I don't want him
to be my pimp."
As a secondary argument for
decriminalization, St. James

addressed the social auspices of
her erstwhile profession.
Professional Bent
"The call girl is a
para-professional therapist,
dealing with a substantially
white, middle-class clientele,"
said St. James. She is sought out
by men who "need someone to
feel comfortable with .. . espec
ially since women's lib has got
most men scared shitless." There
are other men "who need to
think they're in love," and then
there are businessmen "who
want to put prospective clients
in a good mood" before the
signing of contracts.
Another large segment of
"the industry's" clientele comes
from married men who "can't
get good sex at home. Most
wives won't give ... (oral
sex)... so the men come to
whores to get it," revealed St.
James.
A prostitute can help make a
man into a better lover, she
continued. "If he's botching
something, she tells him how to
do it right. A wife can't tell her
husband that, she can't
embarrass him like that," noted
St. James.
When asked if many women
seek the services of male
prostitutes, she maintained that
there is really no market.
"Women want it, but they can't
afford it." Facetiously she added
that she keeps a stable of men
on hand for desiring females.
"The industry does really
quite well during depressions,"
said St. James. "When things are
tough men try to maximize the
pleasure they get from a dollar,
so they go to a whore instead of
a movie.
"We're getting so popular
nowadays that the people up in
Pacific Heights are throwing a
coming out party for COYOTE
later this month. You all know
about 'radical chic,'"she jested.
At the end of the
presentation, St. James sold
COYOTE t-shirts to members of
the audience. The shirts were
from the organization's 1974
convention and read
"1974—Year of the Whore." She
said this year's model carries the
motto, "My Ass Is My Own."
"There's only one thing that
differentiates a hooker from a
woman in a singles bar or a
student who meets a fellow at
the library and takes him with
her back to the dorm — and
that's cash," said Carol Silver,
legal counsel to Sheriff Richard
Hongisto in San Francisco.
Silver, a candidate for San
Francisco district attorney,
and Margo St James, head of the
"loose women's association,"
COYOTE, spoke on campus as
guests of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau last week. Both are
actively campaigning to
decriminalize prostitution.
Both speakers put moralistic
"shoulds" and "oughts" aside
and agreed that the real
argument for decriminalization
is an ecomonic one. "An average
of 50 percent of money allotted
for criminal justice in this
country goes to the prosecution
of victimless crimes:
prostitution-, pot,
homosexuality, etc," said Silver.
She said the money should be
used to help prevent "real"
crimes.
"While San Francisco cops
are out chasing prostitutes in the
Tenderloin, there's some little
old lady down the block being
robbed of her welfare check,"
St. James said.
'Oppressive' Prosecution
Criminal prosecution of the
prostitute is a form of economic
oppression, claimed both
speakers.
"There are two reasons why
women hook," maintained St.
James. "Number one is money,
and second is adventure, but it's
mostly money."
She painted the scenario of
unskilled, low-income women,
seeking financial independence
in a world that relegates women
to the status of mere financial
parasites living off the bankrolls
of their male counterparts.
"Most hookers that I know are
highly independent people who
have decided they won't kiss
ass," confided St. James.
This oppression, she
continued, falls hardest on
minority women. Unable to find
work elsewhere, they frequently
turn to prostitution as their sole
means of support. They are also
the most frequent victims of
police brutality. "The cops
usually beat them, since bruises
don't show on black skin," said
St. James.
'Zealot' Squad
The city of San Francisco
spends $900,000 a year on its
vice squad, "the department in
which the police put all of their
zealots and nuts so they won't

cause problems doing anything
of importance," St. James
asserted. The vice squad is
generally assigned to
investigating prostitution and
other "victimless crimes."
An ex-call girl herself, St.
James doubted that as many
women would become
prostitutes if the monetary
incentives were less. The work,
however, "is in many respects
very rewarding," she added.
"And so long as there is a
demand for the prostitute,
in spite of ever-enlarging vice
squads, there has always been —
and probably always will be — a
supply," she noted, as if giving a
lecture on elementary
economics.
In support of her
supply-and-demand thesis, she
summarized the history of
prostitution in the Western
world, citing references to it in
the Old Testament where the
Hebrews are warned against
prostituting their daughters.
Supply And Demand
During the frontier days of
California there was a large
supply of prostitutes. "It was
very well accepted then. Not
until World War II did
prosecution begin under the
assumption that prostitutes
spread V.D., and V.D. caused a
loss in manpower."
When asked if prostitution

was in fact a victimless crime,
both Silver and St. James cited
statistics to counter contentions
that prostitution involved theft
and the spread of venereal
disease.
"It's teenagers who spread
V.D. Public health officials tell
the kids to practice abstinence,
and then wonder why V.D. runs
rampant. The public then
chooses to ignore teenage ( sex,
and as always the prostitute
becomes the scapegoat," Silver
claimed.

St. James said.
'Oppressive' Prosecution
Criminal prosecution of the
prostitute is a form of economic
oppression, claimed both
speakers.
"There are two reasons why
women hook," maintained St.
James. "Number one is money,
and second is adventure, but it's
mostly money."
She painted the scenario of
unskilled, low-income women,
seeking financial independence
in a world that relegates women
to the status of mere financial
parasites living off the bankrolls
of their male counterparts.
"Most hookers that I know are
highly independent people who
have decided they won't kiss
ass," confided St. James.
This oppression, she
continued, falls hardest on
minority women. Unable to find
work elsewhere, they frequently
turn to prostitution as their sole
means of support. They are also
the most frequent victims of
police brutality. "The cops
usually beat them, since bruises
don't show on black skin," said
St. James.
'Zealot' Squad
The city of San Francisco
spends $900,000 a year on its
vice squad, "the department in
which the police put all of their
zealots and nuts so they won't

cause problems doing anything
of importance," St. James
asserted. The vice squad is
generally assigned to
investigating prostitution and
other "victimless crimes."
An ex-call girl herself, St.
James doubted that as many
women would become
prostitutes if the monetary
incentives were less. The work,
however, "is in many respects
very rewarding," she added.
"And so long as there is a
demand for the prostitute,
in spite of ever-enlarging vice
squads, there has always been —
and probably always will be — a
supply," she noted, as if giving a
lecture on elementary
economics.
In support of her
supply-and-demand thesis, she
summarized the history of
prostitution in the Western
world, citing references to it in
the Old Testament where the
Hebrews are warned against
prostituting their daughters.
Supply And Demand
During the frontier days of
California there was a large
supply of prostitutes. "It was
very well accepted then. Not
until World War II did
prosecution begin under the
assumption that prostitutes
spread V.D., and V.D. caused a
loss in manpower."
When asked if prostitution

was in fact a victimless crime,
both Silver and St. James cited
statistics to counter contentions
that prostitution involved theft
and the spread of venereal
disease.
"It's teenagers who spread
V.D. Public health officials tell
the kids to practice abstinence,
and then wonder why V.D. runs
rampant. The public then
chooses to ignore teenage ( sex,
and as always the prostitute
becomes the scapegoat," Silver
claimed.
In an attempt to protect
prostitutes from becoming
society's scapegoats, St. James
formed COYOTE in the early
'60s, soon after she was
arrested for prostitution in San
Francisco. The organization
offers needy women clothing,
shelter and legal services. St.
James focuses her own efforts
on legislation. This week she will
introduce a bill in Sacramento
that would decriminalize
prostitution.
St. James doesn't favor
legalization, she says, only
decriminalization. "The
government should keep out of
the bedroom. If it were
legalized, that would make Jerry
Ford into a pimp. I don't know
about you, but I don't want him
to be my pimp."
As a secondary argument for
decriminalization, St. James

addressed the social auspices of
her erstwhile profession.
Professional Bent
"The call girl is a
para-professional therapist,
dealing with a substantially
white, middle-class clientele,"
said St. James. She is sought out
by men who "need someone to
feel comfortable with .. . espec
ially since women's lib has got
most men scared shitless." There
are other men "who need to
think they're in love," and then
there are businessmen "who
want to put prospective clients
in a good mood" before the
signing of contracts.
Another large segment of
"the industry's" clientele comes
from married men who "can't
get good sex at home. Most
wives won't give ... (oral
sex)... so the men come to
whores to get it," revealed St.
James.
A prostitute can help make a
man into a better lover, she
continued. "If he's botching
something, she tells him how to
do it right. A wife can't tell her
husband that, she can't
embarrass him like that," noted
St. James.
When asked if many women
seek the services of male
prostitutes, she maintained that
there is really no market.
"Women want it, but they can't
afford it." Facetiously she added
that she keeps a stable of men
on hand for desiring females.
"The industry does really
quite well during depressions,"
said St. James. "When things are
tough men try to maximize the
pleasure they get from a dollar,
so they go to a whore instead of
a movie.
"We're getting so popular
nowadays that the people up in
Pacific Heights are throwing a
coming out party for COYOTE
later this month. You all know
about 'radical chic,'"she jested.
At the end of the
presentation, St. James sold
COYOTE t-shirts to members of
the audience. The shirts were
from the organization's 1974
convention and read
"1974—Year of the Whore." She
said this year's model carries the
motto, "My Ass Is My Own."
"There's only one thing that
differentiates a hooker from a
woman in a singles bar or a
student who meets a fellow at
the library and takes him with
her back to the dorm — and
that's cash," said Carol Silver,
legal counsel to Sheriff Richard
Hongisto in San Francisco.
Silver, a candidate for San
Francisco district attorney,
and Margo St James, head of the
"loose women's association,"
COYOTE, spoke on campus as
guests of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau last week. Both are
actively campaigning to
decriminalize prostitution.
Both speakers put moralistic
"shoulds" and "oughts" aside
and agreed that the real
argument for decriminalization
is an ecomonic one. "An average
of 50 percent of money allotted
for criminal justice in this
country goes to the prosecution
of victimless crimes:
prostitution-, pot,
homosexuality, etc," said Silver.
She said the money should be
used to help prevent "real"
crimes.
"While San Francisco cops
are out chasing prostitutes in the
Tenderloin, there's some little
old lady down the block being
robbed of her welfare check,"
St. James said.

there are businessmen "who
want to put prospective clients
in a good mood" before the
signing of contracts.
Another large segment of
"the industry's" clientele comes
from married men who "can't
get good sex at home. Most
wives won't give ... (oral
sex)... so the men come to
whores to get it," revealed St.
James.
A prostitute can help make a
man into a better lover, she
continued. "If he's botching
something, she tells him how to
do it right. A wife can't tell her
husband that, she can't
embarrass him like that," noted
St. James.
When asked if many women
seek the services of male
prostitutes, she maintained that
there is really no market.
"Women want it, but they can't
afford it." Facetiously she added
that she keeps a stable of men
on hand for desiring females.
"The industry does really
quite well during depressions,"
said St. James. "When things are
tough men try to maximize the
pleasure they get from a dollar,
so they go to a whore instead of
a movie.
"We're getting so popular
nowadays that the people up in
Pacific Heights are throwing a
coming out party for COYOTE
later this month. You all know
about 'radical chic,'"she jested.
At the end of the
presentation, St. James sold
COYOTE t-shirts to members of
the audience. The shirts were
from the organization's 1974
convention and read
"1974—Year of the Whore." She
said this year's model carries the
motto, "My Ass Is My Own."
