# Mitford Asks Reform, Attacks Penal System
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Jessica Mitford, a controversial
commentator on America's penal
system, enlightened a crowd of almost
200 listeners last night with her tales
of the horrors of this nation's prisons.
Mitford, who spoke on behalf of
the Stanford Forum, is the author of
Kind and Usual Punishment, a scathing
attack on American prisons. She
extended her assault last night to
include Karl Menninger and former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark, two
advocates of various prison reforms.
"One should distinguish between
two types of prison reform — the type
that law enforcement types and some
liberals advocate, and the type the
prisoners themselves want," Mitford
warned.
She said that the building of new
prisons — a stance once supported by
Menninger, Clark and wardens' groups
— was self-defeating. Clark, in fact,
once chastised Americans for spending
$12 billion a year on liquor and only
$2 billion a year on corrections.
Reduce Prison Population
"I say we should spend $14 billion
a year on liquor and nothing on

corrections, and we'd be much better
off," she commented.
Overcrowding in prisons should not
be solved by building new prisons, she
argued, but rather by reducing the
prison population. She said this could
be done by:
—decriminalizing victimless crimes,
"up to and including trafficking in


JESSICA MITFORD
heroin and other drugs"; and
—shortening the lengths of all prison
sentences.
Restore Civil Rights
Mitford also advocated restoring
civil rights to prisoners.
"Convicts [should have] all civil
rights — First Amendment rights, right
to receive uncensored mail... right to
form unions," she insisted, noting the
positive effects of existing prisoners'
unions.
A keen observer of prison life,
Mitford suggested that perhaps prison
authorities are more pathological than
prisoners.
"If you were to ask a little boy,
'What would you like to be?' and he
replied 'A prison guard,' you might
like to put him ... under
observation," she commented.
