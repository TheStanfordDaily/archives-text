### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Only three weeks left
[until you can bask in the
Isun and stop worrying
[about tests and grades.
| Hard to believe, isn't it?
|We understand. And
jbecause we do, we're going
'to keep enticing you with
things to keep you sane.
This week isn't quite as
| busy as the last one, but,
lin the words of Law
| Prof. John Kaplan, sit
I tight, be patient and we'll
j tell you what there is.
The week's best bet is
.undoubtedly. Bill Cosby,
|who will appear tomorrow
►night at the Foothill
College Gym. He puts on a
>superb show.
Rumor has it that he
>has been asked to speak at
[Harvard's commencement
[and has accepted. (Daniel
IMoynihan are you
[listening? Senior class
presidents are you?)
i If you -prefer a
[multitude of talent on
'stage, don't miss the
[Stanford Drama
[Department's production
lof Mammy's Town,
(running through Saturday
might this week and
'Tuesday through Saturday
lof next in Memorial

Auditorium.
The play was written
by Elizabeth Means of Los
Altos especially for the
department. It traces the
life of Mammy Pleasant, a
"fabulous character from
early San Francisco
history whom legend
portrays as a freedom
fighter, gourmet cook,
bordello operator, business
wizard, voodoo queen,
blackmailer and
murderess," according to a
press release. Music for the
play was written by Harry
Booker, who writes music
for Stevie Wonder and
Eddie Kendricks.
If you wish to see and
hear more music than
drama, the Music
Department is presenting
several activities this week,
including soprano Marie
Gibson and pianist Nathan
Schwartz on Friday, the
Glee Club on Saturday and
the Stanford Symphony
on Tuesday evening.
Let us not fail to
mention for popular tastes
that Danny Thomas is now
appearing at the Venetian
Room of the Fairmont
(the Copa Cabana it isn't,
but it's still expensive)
and, if you prefer
something cheaper (in
price and perhaps in
quality), the Ice Follies
open Tuesday at the
Oakland Coliseum.
(Snoopy, are you
listening?).
For fine popular music,
try Sergio Franchi and
Michel Legrand at the
Circle Star Theater tonight
through Sunday. Legrand
("Summer of '42,"
"Brian's Song") writes fine
melodies and plays a
magnifigue piano. (Pardon
our French).
If you can get to the
Boarding House in San

Francisco, Neil Sedaka
will only be there on
Tuesday evening. Sedaka's
current hit, "The
Immigrant," was written
for John Lennon after he
was deported from this
country — supposedly, the
song is winning Lennon a
lot of support. It may also
win Sedaka a gold record.
If you are a sports
enthusiast, particularly
tennis, do not despair —
this is the week of the
Pac-8 Tennis Champion
ships. They will run
through the weekend on
the varsity courts and in
Maples Pavilion. Today,
Stanford plays Oregon.
Should you wish to
center off campus and still
remain outdoors, then go
to Hillsborough on
Sunday. (Yes, the home of

the Hearsts and Crosbys).
At the William H. Crocker
Jr. High School, from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., the annual
Concours d'Elegance will
feature a superb antique
car show and the best
barbequed hamburgers
you've had in a long time.
In the realm of movies,

you'll have to go to the
Carlos in San Carlos to see
Ben Gazzara as Capone,
but you can see Warren
Beatty in Shampoo at the
Menlo. If you want
something artistic and
entertaining, the ASSU
Sunday Flicks screens the
tenth annual International
Tournee of Animation at
6:30 and 9 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
Finally, let us advise
you that for a good laugh,
watch the Emmy Awards
(television's oscars)
Monday at 9 p.m. on CBS
and Creature Features on
Saturday at 9:30 p.m. on
channel 2. This week's
film is Thirteen Ghosts
(1960). This film, when it
was shown in a theater,
required viewers to wear
special glasses to see ghosts
otherwise hidden from
view.
We don't know how
they'll work this out on
TV. But if you like ouija
boards, watch it. Here's
the plot: "A professor and
his wife move into an
ancient house which
proves to be haunted by
the former owners." We're
told that channel 2 is
dedicating the film to the
Stanford -in-Stanford
project.
