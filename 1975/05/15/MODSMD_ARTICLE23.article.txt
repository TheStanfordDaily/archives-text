House Passes Refugee Aid Bill
WASHINGTON — Resettlement aid for Indochina
refugees was overwhelmingly approved by the House last
night despite assertions that some American poor people
will not get the same benefits.
The House approved a bill authorizing the $507 million
aid President Ford requested and then took up a separate
bill to appropriate $405 million of the money that would
be authorized.
The authorization bill was passed by a vote of 381-31.
Floor leaders urged the House to put no limit in the
authorization bill, saying the $507 million limit was only
a "rough figure" and that more money may be needed.
But the House approved 353-54 an amendment by
Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman (D-N.Y.) to write in the $507
million limit.
The House rejected 346-71 an amendment by Rep.

Donald Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) that would have required that
any job, housing or other benefits for refugees would also
have to be extended to other Americans with "equivalent
personal economic hardship."
Thailand Demands Exit Of Marines
BANGKOK — Thailand threatened its long-time ally,
the United States, with "drastic action" unless Marines
sent here because of the Mayaguez crisis leave
immediately.
A Foreign Ministry official angrily called the U.S. air
attacks on the Cambodian vessels "piracy" and "madness
— an action taken with no thought for the consequences
of Thailand."
Official tempers also rose over the use of U.S. bases in
Thailand for the sinking of three Cambodia gunboats.
The demand for the removal of the 1100 Marines came
from Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj who said he wanted
them out by this moming — last night by New York time—
or his government would take "drastic action." He did not
elaborate nor did he cite a specific hour for withdrawal of
the Marines.
SLA Defense Begins Its Case
SACRAMENTO — The names of Patty Hearst and her
former fiance Steven Weed popped up in the Marcus
Foster murder trial yesterday as the defense began to
detail its case for the jury.
James Jenner, the assistant public defender
representing Russell Little, outlined how he intends to
prove his client's innocence using a chart and a red felt-tip
pen.
Little, 25, and Remiro, 28, are charged with murdering
Oakland schools chief Marcus Foster at dusk Nov. 6,
1973, in a school district parking lot.
Jenner said Tom Matthews, a Los Angeles youth who
says he was kidnapped by William and Emily Harris and
Hearst on May 17, 1974, will testify on what the three
talked about while driving in his van.
Warriors Defeat Bulls To Gain Finals
OAKLAND — Rick Barry, after making two of his first
15 shots, fired in 14 points for Golden State in the final
period last night and led the Warriors to a 83-79 victory
over the Chicago Bulls in the deciding seventh game of the
National Basketball Association's (NBA) Western
Conference championship.

afternoon. Fair through tomorrow. A little warmer

House Passes Refugee Aid Bill
WASHINGTON — Resettlement aid for Indochina
refugees was overwhelmingly approved by the House last
night despite assertions that some American poor people
will not get the same benefits.
The House approved a bill authorizing the $507 million
aid President Ford requested and then took up a separate
bill to appropriate $405 million of the money that would
be authorized.
The authorization bill was passed by a vote of 381-31.
Floor leaders urged the House to put no limit in the
authorization bill, saying the $507 million limit was only
a "rough figure" and that more money may be needed.
But the House approved 353-54 an amendment by
Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman (D-N.Y.) to write in the $507
million limit.
The House rejected 346-71 an amendment by Rep.

Donald Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) that would have required that
any job, housing or other benefits for refugees would also
have to be extended to other Americans with "equivalent
personal economic hardship."
Thailand Demands Exit Of Marines
BANGKOK — Thailand threatened its long-time ally,
the United States, with "drastic action" unless Marines
sent here because of the Mayaguez crisis leave
immediately.
A Foreign Ministry official angrily called the U.S. air
attacks on the Cambodian vessels "piracy" and "madness
— an action taken with no thought for the consequences
of Thailand."
Official tempers also rose over the use of U.S. bases in
Thailand for the sinking of three Cambodia gunboats.
The demand for the removal of the 1100 Marines came
from Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj who said he wanted
them out by this moming — last night by New York time—
or his government would take "drastic action." He did not
elaborate nor did he cite a specific hour for withdrawal of
the Marines.
SLA Defense Begins Its Case
SACRAMENTO — The names of Patty Hearst and her
former fiance Steven Weed popped up in the Marcus
Foster murder trial yesterday as the defense began to
detail its case for the jury.
James Jenner, the assistant public defender
representing Russell Little, outlined how he intends to
prove his client's innocence using a chart and a red felt-tip
pen.
Little, 25, and Remiro, 28, are charged with murdering
Oakland schools chief Marcus Foster at dusk Nov. 6,
1973, in a school district parking lot.
Jenner said Tom Matthews, a Los Angeles youth who
says he was kidnapped by William and Emily Harris and
Hearst on May 17, 1974, will testify on what the three
talked about while driving in his van.
Warriors Defeat Bulls To Gain Finals

15 shots, fired in 14 points for Golden State in the final
period last night and led the Warriors to a 83-79 victory

Conference championship.
Today's Weather
Cloudy today with occasional drizzle clearing this
afternoon. Fair through tomorrow. A little warmer
