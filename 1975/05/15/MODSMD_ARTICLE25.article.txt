# Fire In Faculty Home
## 
### 
A fire of unknown origin burned
the home of Marjorie Manning,
former wife of former Law School
Dean Bayless Manning on the
campus yesterday.
Fire Chief Frank Jurian
estimated $75,000 structural
damage to the wooden frame house
at 776 Dolores street.
Manning had recently sold the
house to Business School Prof.
George Shultz, a former U.S.
secretary of the treasury and now
a Bechtel vice president.
Jurian and investigators said the
fire apparently started in the
kitchen sometime after 8 a.m. when
Mrs. Manning left for work. A
neighbor one block away noticed
smoke pouring from the second and
third story windows and
telephoned the alarm at 11:55 a.m.
