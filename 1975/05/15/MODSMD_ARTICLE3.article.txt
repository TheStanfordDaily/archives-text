# Cambodia Returns U.S. Crewmen When Faced With Military Force
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Cambodia
surrendered 40 American freighter
crewmen in the face of military force
early today after U.S. Marines
recaptured the ship seized by the
Khmer Rouge government three days
ago.
President Ford announced the
return of the full crew after a tense and
uncertain day of troop landings,
bombings and false hopes.
Two helicopters were reported lost
in the operation and White House
press secretary Ron Nessen said
"reports indicated some American
casualties."
Ford said the crew was returned
and the ship was intact, but that
Marines who landed on a small island
off Cambodia were still under hostile
fire as they sought to disengage
following return of the crew.
Since the ship had been captured,
reports numbered the crew at 39
Americans. But Nessen said early
today that 40 Americans were
returned along with five Thais.
Nessen added at a briefing

following Ford's statement: "It
appears that the Thais may have
decided to go off by themselves in a
small boat.-It is not clear."
The Pentagon said preliminary
reports indicated the U.S. casualties
were light, with no known deaths.
The civilian freighter was seized
Monday about 90 miles off Cambodia
but within about eight miles of the
small island of Koh Tang, which
Cambodia claims.
Sought Chinese Help
The U.S. government immediately
demanded return of the ship and
sought diplomatic help through the
People's Republic of China.
But no diplomatic help was
forthcoming in this clash with a
communist government which had
taken power in Cambodia only days
earlier.
Last night the White House
announced that Marines were landing
from U.S. ships which had rushed to
the Gulf of Thailand.
As hundreds of Marines stormed
onto the island, U.S. planes bombed
Cambodian air installations on the
mainland and sank three Cambodian
gunboats early yesterday.
Empty Ship
The boats were sunk after the
Cambodian navy tried to move the
crew of the U.S. merchant ship S.S.
Mayaguez to the mainland, the
Pentagon said.
When Marines seized the freighter,
hopes rose that the crisis was over. But
the ship was empty, although warm
food was in the galley.
As the U.S. assault continued, a
Cambodian ship flying a white flag
approached the U.S. destroyer Wilson
and handed over 30 of the ship's crew.
It was not immediately clear how
the remaining 10 were returned, but
Ford said in a one-minute nationally
broadcast and televised statement that

40 were safe.
Speaking in measured and somber
tones, Ford said:
"At my direction, United States
forces tonight [Wednesday night]
boarded the American merchant ship
S.S. Mayaguez and landed at the island
of Koh Tang for the purpose of
rescuing the crew and ship which had
been illegally seized by Cambodian
forces. They also conducted
supporting strikes against nearby
military installations.

"I have now received information
that the vessel has been recovered
intact and that the entire crew has
been rescued.
"The forces that have successfully
accomplished this mission are still
under hostile fire but are preparing to
disengage.
"I wish to express my appreciation
and that of the entire nation to the
units and men who participated in
these operations for their valor and
sacrifice."

crew of the U.S. merchant ship S.S.
Mayaguez to the mainland, the
Pentagon said.
When Marines seized the freighter,
hopes rose that the crisis was over. But
the ship was empty, although warm
food was in the galley.
As the U.S. assault continued, a
Cambodian ship flying a white flag
approached the U.S. destroyer Wilson
and handed over 30 of the ship's crew.
It was not immediately clear how
the remaining 10 were returned, but
Ford said in a one-minute nationally
broadcast and televised statement that

40 were safe.
Speaking in measured and somber
tones, Ford said:
"At my direction, United States
forces tonight [Wednesday night]
boarded the American merchant ship
S.S. Mayaguez and landed at the island
of Koh Tang for the purpose of
rescuing the crew and ship which had
been illegally seized by Cambodian
forces. They also conducted
supporting strikes against nearby
military installations.

"I have now received information
that the vessel has been recovered
intact and that the entire crew has
been rescued.
"The forces that have successfully
accomplished this mission are still
under hostile fire but are preparing to
disengage.
"I wish to express my appreciation
and that of the entire nation to the
units and men who participated in
these operations for their valor and
sacrifice."
WASHINGTON (AP) - Cambodia
surrendered 40 American freighter
crewmen in the face of military force
early today after U.S. Marines
recaptured the ship seized by the
Khmer Rouge government three days
ago.
President Ford announced the
return of the full crew after a tense and
uncertain day of troop landings,
bombings and false hopes.
Two helicopters were reported lost
in the operation and White House
press secretary Ron Nessen said
"reports indicated some American
casualties."
Ford said the crew was returned
and the ship was intact, but that
Marines who landed on a small island
off Cambodia were still under hostile
fire as they sought to disengage
following return of the crew.
Since the ship had been captured,
reports numbered the crew at 39
Americans. But Nessen said early
today that 40 Americans were
returned along with five Thais.
Nessen added at a briefing

following Ford's statement: "It
appears that the Thais may have
decided to go off by themselves in a
small boat.-It is not clear."
The Pentagon said preliminary
reports indicated the U.S. casualties
were light, with no known deaths.
The civilian freighter was seized
Monday about 90 miles off Cambodia
but within about eight miles of the
small island of Koh Tang, which
Cambodia claims.
Sought Chinese Help
The U.S. government immediately
demanded return of the ship and
sought diplomatic help through the
People's Republic of China.
But no diplomatic help was
forthcoming in this clash with a
communist government which had
taken power in Cambodia only days
earlier.
Last night the White House
announced that Marines were landing
from U.S. ships which had rushed to
the Gulf of Thailand.
As hundreds of Marines stormed
onto the island, U.S. planes bombed
Cambodian air installations on the
mainland and sank three Cambodian
gunboats early yesterday.
Empty Ship
The boats were sunk after the
Cambodian navy tried to move the
crew of the U.S. merchant ship S.S.
Mayaguez to the mainland, the
Pentagon said.
