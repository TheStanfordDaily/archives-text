# Kingscote: A 'Novel' Apartment?
## 
### PAM WOODS 
In a swinging California apartment
complex where anything went, these
desperate men and women sought to
fill the aching void in their lives with
the pleasures of the flesh — and the
apartment exploded in an orgy of dark
desires and scorching shock!"
So reads the back cover of a recent
novel. The Apartments, by Charles
Beardsley.
But where are these swinging
apartments, and who are those whose
lives are nothing but wild orgies? Is
this some Southern California singles
place where the Hollywood set lives?
Ole and Faith Morris, managers of
the Kingscote Garden apartments on
the comer of Lagunita and Lomita
Drives, think not. They believe
Beardsley wrote his book about their
apartments.
The privately owned operation
admits its own residents, most of
whom are or were connected with the
University and some of whom are
students.
"You can see that he describes the
place perfectly," said Ole Morris. And
indeed, Kingscote Gardens does
resemble remarkably Beardsley's
description of his "Kumquat
Gardens":
.. completed fifty years ago,
built in the style of a rambling Italian
villa, gray and buff with soft green
trim. Rectangular in shape, with two
wings forming a U. Between the U and
at main-floor level is a raised portico
with a semi-circular fan of curved
lobby windows offering a wide view of
angled lawns, massive oaks, shrubs, fir
trees.,.."
The Morrises also claim that
Beardsley, who lived in Kingscote
Gardens while he was writing the book
and for a short time thereafter,
modeled the book's characters after
the Morrises and their tenants.
'That's Us'
"Hope and Ace Greeley — that's
us," stated Morris, speaking of the
managers of Kumquat Gardens. Both
the Greeleys and the Morrises came
from the midwest, both were married
•;ear Kansas City and both have a son

on Okinawa.
Ace Greeley, however, also has a
basement retreat he calls "the Playboy
Room," in which he drinks beer,
watches TV and occasionally views the
action in the room next door through
a one-way mirror he has concocted.
Author Beardsley, who could not
be reached for comment, claims that
there is no resemblance between
Kumquat and Kingscote Gardens and
that his book is totally fiction, said the
Morrises.
Among those living in the fictional
Cumquat Gardens are a wife-swapping
couple, a hippie artist, a dying former
prostitute and her illegitimate

daughter and a homosexual couple.
"As far as I know I am not in that
book — Charles told me I wasn't," said
one tenant, a writer himself, who
closely resembles one character in The
Apartments. "But many people here
saw themselves in Charles' pages.
Common Problem
"It is a common problem in
fiction," ho said, that supposedly
fictional characters resemble real
people, "but perhaps this book came a
little too close to home."
Beardsley did not tell the Morrises
that he was writing the book, and Mrs.
Morris was "shocked that he would
write the book while living here" with
the people he allegedly was writing
about.
Requested To Leave
Although Beardsley continued to
live in Kingscote for a span after The
Apartments was published, he left
after being requested to do so by
Morris.
The Morrises plan no suit against
Beardsley, although they stated that
both they and Kingscote Gardens were
falsely represented. "We don't want to
draw any more attention to [the
book]they said.

complex where anything went, these
desperate men and women sought to

novel. The Apartments, by Charles
Beardsley.
But where are these swinging
apartments, and who are those whose
lives are nothing but wild orgies? Is
this some Southern California singles
place where the Hollywood set lives?
Ole and Faith Morris, managers of
the Kingscote Garden apartments on
the comer of Lagunita and Lomita
Drives, think not. They believe
Beardsley wrote his book about their
apartments.
The privately owned operation
admits its own residents, most of
whom are or were connected with the
University and some of whom are
students.
"You can see that he describes the
place perfectly," said Ole Morris. And
indeed, Kingscote Gardens does
resemble remarkably Beardsley's
description of his "Kumquat
Gardens":
.. completed fifty years ago,
built in the style of a rambling Italian
villa, gray and buff with soft green
trim. Rectangular in shape, with two
wings forming a U. Between the U and
at main-floor level is a raised portico
with a semi-circular fan of curved
lobby windows offering a wide view of
angled lawns, massive oaks, shrubs, fir
trees.,.."
The Morrises also claim that
Beardsley, who lived in Kingscote
Gardens while he was writing the book
and for a short time thereafter,
modeled the book's characters after
the Morrises and their tenants.
'That's Us'
"Hope and Ace Greeley — that's
us," stated Morris, speaking of the
managers of Kumquat Gardens. Both
the Greeleys and the Morrises came
from the midwest, both were married
•;ear Kansas City and both have a son

on Okinawa.
Ace Greeley, however, also has a
basement retreat he calls "the Playboy
Room," in which he drinks beer,
watches TV and occasionally views the
action in the room next door through
a one-way mirror he has concocted.
Author Beardsley, who could not
be reached for comment, claims that
there is no resemblance between
Kumquat and Kingscote Gardens and
that his book is totally fiction, said the
Morrises.
Among those living in the fictional
Cumquat Gardens are a wife-swapping
couple, a hippie artist, a dying former
prostitute and her illegitimate

daughter and a homosexual couple.
"As far as I know I am not in that
book — Charles told me I wasn't," said
one tenant, a writer himself, who
closely resembles one character in The
Apartments. "But many people here
saw themselves in Charles' pages.
Common Problem
"It is a common problem in
fiction," ho said, that supposedly
fictional characters resemble real
people, "but perhaps this book came a
little too close to home."
Beardsley did not tell the Morrises
that he was writing the book, and Mrs.
Morris was "shocked that he would
write the book while living here" with
the people he allegedly was writing
about.
Requested To Leave
Although Beardsley continued to
live in Kingscote for a span after The
Apartments was published, he left
after being requested to do so by
Morris.
The Morrises plan no suit against
Beardsley, although they stated that
both they and Kingscote Gardens were
falsely represented. "We don't want to
draw any more attention to [the
book]they said.
In a swinging California apartment
complex where anything went, these
desperate men and women sought to
fill the aching void in their lives with
the pleasures of the flesh — and the
apartment exploded in an orgy of dark
desires and scorching shock!"

novel. The Apartments, by Charles
