# Sandra Bern To Quit, Cites 'High Pressure'

Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
will resign at the end of this summer,
the Daily has learned. She said she
turned in her resignation last week,
after "thinking about it since the
beginning of the year."
"I didn't want to subject myself to
the kind of intense performance
pressures ... that I see Stanford as
having," Bern explained. She will
continue her academic work next year
with a one-year position as a visiting
scholar at Mills College.
Bern's appointment would have
continued until at least Sept. 1976,
when she would have been considered
for tenure. She said that the question
of tenure did not really enter her
decision to leave Stanford. "It's a high
pressure environment whether one has
tenure or not," she said.
Psychology Department
Chairman Eleanor Maccoby agreed
that Stanford faculty members do feel
a lot of performance pressure.
"There's no question about it. It's

every person's decision if they want to
subject themselves to it or not," she
said.
Find Best Possible Job
Maccoby said that the Psychology
Department hopes to continue Bern's
Psychology 130 course, "Psychology
of Sex Roles," which has been one of
the most popular in the department.
"I think she contributed a great
deal to undergraduate teaching in the
department," Maccoby added, saying
she regrets Bems's decision to leave.
Bern said she plans to apply for
permanent positions not only in the
Bay Area but also in the East.
Her husband, Psychology Prof.
Daryl Bern, has tenure in the
Psychology Department. Sandra Bern
said that "We will do again what we
have always said we would do," and go
where they both can find the best
possible jobs.
She quickly explained that "The
best job is not necessarily defined as
the highest status job."

DOES KINGSCOTE SWING?— "Kumquat Gardens," a swinging apartment
complex in "The Apartments" by Charles Beardsley, bears remarkable physical
resemblance to the Kingscote Garden apartments on the corner of Lagunitaand
Lomita. Beardsley, who wrote his book while living at Kingscote, denies any
connection between the two.
