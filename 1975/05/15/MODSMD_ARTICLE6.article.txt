# Minorities And Fraternities: How Much In Common?
## 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Though the number of minority members in
fraternities is small, fraternity officials claim that racial
discrimination, in its true sense, does not exist. All of
Stanford's 13 fraternities say they welcome members of
any race.
There are eight black students — representing roughly
two-and-one-half percent of the total black undergraduate
enrollment — who belong to fraternities. There are also 20
chicano and 23 Asian-American members.
Mike Nilsson, Inter-Fraternity Council president, says,
"One thing a frat doesn't want to be labeled is racist.... I
would like to see more minorities in frats."
But fraternity members say the numbers are few
because minorities show little interest in joining. Members
say this lack of interest is shown by an absence of minorities
who appear at fraternity rush parties — which are "open
to everyone."
"The reason minorities aren't in frats," says John
Holman, co-rush chairman of Alpha Delta Phi, is that
"minorities aren't interested in the first place. About five
or six minorities out of 160 came up for our first open
house."
Enthusiasm Lessened
Kappa Sigma Rush Chairman Greg Brown says, "Even
if we were inclined to discriminate, we couldn't because
there weren't enough minorities at rush to discriminate
against."
Ray Anderson, a black student who rushed three frats
and received a bid from Phi Delta Theta this spring, says
of rush, "As we [he and friend Gerald Wilson] went
through it, our enthusiasm lessened."
He and Wilson were both interested in joining a frat,
but, says Anderson, "I don't think the frats gave us much
of an invitation. We took the initiative ourselves. We

extended our own invitation. There's no one extending an
open hand, saying, 'come join our house.' "
In fact, says Anderson, "most people didn't take us
seriously. They thought we were rushing just to have a
free beer. Everyone we went up to, we had to say, 'Hey
man, we're interested, we're not bullshitting you.' "
Assoc. Dean of Students Harold Boyd, a black, says,
"To the extent that minorities have felt unwelcome, I
would like to think that a frat — if sincere — would have
aggressive programs in which they would recruit and
welcome minorities to come over, to see what the house is
like — to generally throw out the welcome mat."
No Special Effort
Fraternity members admit that they don't extend any
preferential invitations to minorities.
"There's no special effort to get any type of person in
particular," says Holman. "We treat everybody the same."
The feeling of "treating everyone the same" pervades
in every fraternity. Says Delta Upsilon Vice President
Bruce Dines, "Rush is open to anyone who wants to
come. There's no special effort to get minorities."
"We can't go out and solicit people. We want people
who show an interest in us," says another rush chairman.
"We don't go out advertising for them. We're only
interested in people who will help our house — black,
white or yellow," says another.
'WASP-ish'
A former white member of Kappa Alpha says one
reason why so few minorities appear at rush functions is
"the idea of a frat is the people you live with are the
people you choose to live with. You are their brother, and
it doesn't make sense for a black to want to live with a
bunch of WASP-ish type guys — unless he has something
in common with them."
But the history of fraternities strongly suggests that

minorities do not have anything in common with frat
brothers. The history strongly suggests that minorities are
not welcome.
"Most frats started in the South in years past when
they were more attuned to the white man, says Beta
Theta Pi President Steve Pickrell. "Frats were a white
southern gentleman's 'thing,' and that feeling is carried
over today — especially in houses where a strong fraternal
tradition exists." (One K.A. member says Confederate
flags are put up around the house occasionally.)
'An Oversight'
"When minority members want to be a part of the
[fraternity] community, the house will make sure and
show they can indeed be part of the house," says Nilsson.
This wasn't wholly the case for Anderson. "Gerald and
I didn't even get an invitation to the Phi Delt luau — the
biggest event of their rush," he claims. "I saw members of
the Phi Delts all week long at [spring football] practice
and they were all talking about it. After the party,
members came up to us and asked why we weren't there."
Anderson says that when he told them that he and
Wilson didn't receive an invitation, members said, "Oh, it
must have just been an oversight."
"It's not easy for a frat to have an outreach program
for minorities," says Nilsson, "because first, there's a
problem of conveying our sincerity. Secondly, we don't
like to come down too hard on anybody because it gives
them the feeling they're being pressured to become
rah-rah red-hots. We're fighting that image.
"The easiest and best way of joining a frat is by having
friends there; that's how most members are gotten," says
Nilsson.
It seems that for some of those minority students who
do have friends in a fraternity, joining is easier.
Jeff Brandon, a black student who recently received a

bid from Zeta Psi. says "All my friends from the tennis
team live in that frat.... There was no discomfort in
rushing because I already knew most of the people."
"[The parents of minorities] haven't belonged to
fraternities.... You're talking about a different set of
values," says Boyd. "People you don't know much
about...."
Some people wonder if more minority students are
really interested in living in a fraternity as opposed to a
theme house.
Black Frat?
Boyd says, "Minorities want to feel comfortable on
this campus, they want to feel a sense of belonging and
they want to have the same opportunities as
What's available to one should be available to all" — and
that includes the option of having a black fraternity.
According to Black Students Union President Mae
Jemison, some blacks - though not an overwhelming
majority — have shown an interest in a black fraternity at
Stanford. Jemison says'that some black Stanford students
currently belong to a black fraternity at Berkeley.
"A black frat would not only be good for the black
men at Stanford, but it would be good for Stanford....
Intuition tells me some good things would come out of
it,"says Anderson.
Larry Horton, associate dean of students, says, "There
is no agreed-upon way to approach the problems of
cultural diversity and minority dissent in American
society. There is surely no agreed-upon approach to those
problems here at Stanford."
But, Horton adds, "It would be gratifying if fraternities
would lead the way in developing living groups with
substantial numbers of minority and non-minority
students living together."

them the feeling they're being pressured to become
rah-rah red-hots. We're fighting that image.
"The easiest and best way of joining a frat is by having
friends there; that's how most members are gotten," says
Nilsson.
It seems that for some of those minority students who
do have friends in a fraternity, joining is easier.
Jeff Brandon, a black student who recently received a

bid from Zeta Psi. says "All my friends from the tennis
team live in that frat.... There was no discomfort in
rushing because I already knew most of the people."
"[The parents of minorities] haven't belonged to
fraternities.... You're talking about a different set of
values," says Boyd. "People you don't know much
about...."
Some people wonder if more minority students are
really interested in living in a fraternity as opposed to a
theme house.
Black Frat?
Boyd says, "Minorities want to feel comfortable on
this campus, they want to feel a sense of belonging and
they want to have the same opportunities as
What's available to one should be available to all" — and
that includes the option of having a black fraternity.
According to Black Students Union President Mae
Jemison, some blacks - though not an overwhelming
majority — have shown an interest in a black fraternity at
Stanford. Jemison says'that some black Stanford students
currently belong to a black fraternity at Berkeley.
"A black frat would not only be good for the black
men at Stanford, but it would be good for Stanford....
Intuition tells me some good things would come out of
it,"says Anderson.
Larry Horton, associate dean of students, says, "There
is no agreed-upon way to approach the problems of
cultural diversity and minority dissent in American
society. There is surely no agreed-upon approach to those
problems here at Stanford."
But, Horton adds, "It would be gratifying if fraternities
would lead the way in developing living groups with
substantial numbers of minority and non-minority
students living together."
Though the number of minority members in
fraternities is small, fraternity officials claim that racial
discrimination, in its true sense, does not exist. All of
Stanford's 13 fraternities say they welcome members of
any race.
There are eight black students — representing roughly
two-and-one-half percent of the total black undergraduate
enrollment — who belong to fraternities. There are also 20
chicano and 23 Asian-American members.
Mike Nilsson, Inter-Fraternity Council president, says,
"One thing a frat doesn't want to be labeled is racist.... I
would like to see more minorities in frats."
But fraternity members say the numbers are few
because minorities show little interest in joining. Members
say this lack of interest is shown by an absence of minorities
who appear at fraternity rush parties — which are "open
to everyone."
"The reason minorities aren't in frats," says John
Holman, co-rush chairman of Alpha Delta Phi, is that
"minorities aren't interested in the first place. About five
or six minorities out of 160 came up for our first open
house."
Enthusiasm Lessened
Kappa Sigma Rush Chairman Greg Brown says, "Even
if we were inclined to discriminate, we couldn't because
there weren't enough minorities at rush to discriminate
against."
Ray Anderson, a black student who rushed three frats
and received a bid from Phi Delta Theta this spring, says
of rush, "As we [he and friend Gerald Wilson] went
through it, our enthusiasm lessened."
He and Wilson were both interested in joining a frat,
but, says Anderson, "I don't think the frats gave us much
of an invitation. We took the initiative ourselves. We

extended our own invitation. There's no one extending an
open hand, saying, 'come join our house.' "
In fact, says Anderson, "most people didn't take us
seriously. They thought we were rushing just to have a
free beer. Everyone we went up to, we had to say, 'Hey
man, we're interested, we're not bullshitting you.' "
Assoc. Dean of Students Harold Boyd, a black, says,
"To the extent that minorities have felt unwelcome, I
would like to think that a frat — if sincere — would have
aggressive programs in which they would recruit and
welcome minorities to come over, to see what the house is
like — to generally throw out the welcome mat."
No Special Effort
Fraternity members admit that they don't extend any
preferential invitations to minorities.
"There's no special effort to get any type of person in
particular," says Holman. "We treat everybody the same."
The feeling of "treating everyone the same" pervades
in every fraternity. Says Delta Upsilon Vice President
Bruce Dines, "Rush is open to anyone who wants to
come. There's no special effort to get minorities."
"We can't go out and solicit people. We want people
who show an interest in us," says another rush chairman.
"We don't go out advertising for them. We're only
interested in people who will help our house — black,
white or yellow," says another.
'WASP-ish'
A former white member of Kappa Alpha says one
reason why so few minorities appear at rush functions is
"the idea of a frat is the people you live with are the
people you choose to live with. You are their brother, and
it doesn't make sense for a black to want to live with a
bunch of WASP-ish type guys — unless he has something
in common with them."
But the history of fraternities strongly suggests that

minorities do not have anything in common with frat
brothers. The history strongly suggests that minorities are
not welcome.
"Most frats started in the South in years past when
they were more attuned to the white man, says Beta
Theta Pi President Steve Pickrell. "Frats were a white
southern gentleman's 'thing,' and that feeling is carried
over today — especially in houses where a strong fraternal
tradition exists." (One K.A. member says Confederate
flags are put up around the house occasionally.)
'An Oversight'
"When minority members want to be a part of the
[fraternity] community, the house will make sure and
show they can indeed be part of the house," says Nilsson.
This wasn't wholly the case for Anderson. "Gerald and
I didn't even get an invitation to the Phi Delt luau — the
biggest event of their rush," he claims. "I saw members of
the Phi Delts all week long at [spring football] practice
and they were all talking about it. After the party,
members came up to us and asked why we weren't there."
Anderson says that when he told them that he and
Wilson didn't receive an invitation, members said, "Oh, it
must have just been an oversight."
"It's not easy for a frat to have an outreach program
for minorities," says Nilsson, "because first, there's a
problem of conveying our sincerity. Secondly, we don't
like to come down too hard on anybody because it gives
them the feeling they're being pressured to become
rah-rah red-hots. We're fighting that image.

interested in people who will help our house — black,
white or yellow," says another.
'WASP-ish'
A former white member of Kappa Alpha says one
reason why so few minorities appear at rush functions is
"the idea of a frat is the people you live with are the
people you choose to live with. You are their brother, and
it doesn't make sense for a black to want to live with a
bunch of WASP-ish type guys — unless he has something
in common with them."
But the history of fraternities strongly suggests that

minorities do not have anything in common with frat
brothers. The history strongly suggests that minorities are
not welcome.
"Most frats started in the South in years past when
they were more attuned to the white man, says Beta
Theta Pi President Steve Pickrell. "Frats were a white
southern gentleman's 'thing,' and that feeling is carried
over today — especially in houses where a strong fraternal
tradition exists." (One K.A. member says Confederate
flags are put up around the house occasionally.)
'An Oversight'
"When minority members want to be a part of the
[fraternity] community, the house will make sure and
show they can indeed be part of the house," says Nilsson.
This wasn't wholly the case for Anderson. "Gerald and
I didn't even get an invitation to the Phi Delt luau — the
biggest event of their rush," he claims. "I saw members of
the Phi Delts all week long at [spring football] practice
and they were all talking about it. After the party,
members came up to us and asked why we weren't there."
Anderson says that when he told them that he and
Wilson didn't receive an invitation, members said, "Oh, it
must have just been an oversight."
"It's not easy for a frat to have an outreach program
for minorities," says Nilsson, "because first, there's a
problem of conveying our sincerity. Secondly, we don't
like to come down too hard on anybody because it gives
them the feeling they're being pressured to become
rah-rah red-hots. We're fighting that image.
"The easiest and best way of joining a frat is by having
friends there; that's how most members are gotten," says
Nilsson.
It seems that for some of those minority students who
do have friends in a fraternity, joining is easier.
Jeff Brandon, a black student who recently received a

bid from Zeta Psi. says "All my friends from the tennis
team live in that frat.... There was no discomfort in
rushing because I already knew most of the people."
"[The parents of minorities] haven't belonged to
fraternities.... You're talking about a different set of
values," says Boyd. "People you don't know much
about...."
Some people wonder if more minority students are
really interested in living in a fraternity as opposed to a
theme house.
Black Frat?
Boyd says, "Minorities want to feel comfortable on
this campus, they want to feel a sense of belonging and
they want to have the same opportunities as
What's available to one should be available to all" — and
that includes the option of having a black fraternity.
According to Black Students Union President Mae
Jemison, some blacks - though not an overwhelming
majority — have shown an interest in a black fraternity at
Stanford. Jemison says'that some black Stanford students
currently belong to a black fraternity at Berkeley.
"A black frat would not only be good for the black
men at Stanford, but it would be good for Stanford....
Intuition tells me some good things would come out of
it,"says Anderson.
Larry Horton, associate dean of students, says, "There
is no agreed-upon way to approach the problems of
cultural diversity and minority dissent in American
society. There is surely no agreed-upon approach to those
problems here at Stanford."
But, Horton adds, "It would be gratifying if fraternities
would lead the way in developing living groups with
substantial numbers of minority and non-minority
students living together."
Though the number of minority members in
fraternities is small, fraternity officials claim that racial
discrimination, in its true sense, does not exist. All of
Stanford's 13 fraternities say they welcome members of
any race.
There are eight black students — representing roughly
two-and-one-half percent of the total black undergraduate
enrollment — who belong to fraternities. There are also 20
chicano and 23 Asian-American members.
Mike Nilsson, Inter-Fraternity Council president, says,
"One thing a frat doesn't want to be labeled is racist.... I
would like to see more minorities in frats."
But fraternity members say the numbers are few
because minorities show little interest in joining. Members
say this lack of interest is shown by an absence of minorities
who appear at fraternity rush parties — which are "open
to everyone."
"The reason minorities aren't in frats," says John
Holman, co-rush chairman of Alpha Delta Phi, is that
"minorities aren't interested in the first place. About five
or six minorities out of 160 came up for our first open
house."
Enthusiasm Lessened
Kappa Sigma Rush Chairman Greg Brown says, "Even
if we were inclined to discriminate, we couldn't because
there weren't enough minorities at rush to discriminate
against."
Ray Anderson, a black student who rushed three frats
and received a bid from Phi Delta Theta this spring, says
of rush, "As we [he and friend Gerald Wilson] went
through it, our enthusiasm lessened."
He and Wilson were both interested in joining a frat,
but, says Anderson, "I don't think the frats gave us much
of an invitation. We took the initiative ourselves. We

extended our own invitation. There's no one extending an
open hand, saying, 'come join our house.' "
In fact, says Anderson, "most people didn't take us
seriously. They thought we were rushing just to have a
free beer. Everyone we went up to, we had to say, 'Hey
man, we're interested, we're not bullshitting you.' "
Assoc. Dean of Students Harold Boyd, a black, says,
"To the extent that minorities have felt unwelcome, I
would like to think that a frat — if sincere — would have
aggressive programs in which they would recruit and
welcome minorities to come over, to see what the house is
like — to generally throw out the welcome mat."
No Special Effort
Fraternity members admit that they don't extend any
preferential invitations to minorities.
"There's no special effort to get any type of person in
particular," says Holman. "We treat everybody the same."
The feeling of "treating everyone the same" pervades
in every fraternity. Says Delta Upsilon Vice President
Bruce Dines, "Rush is open to anyone who wants to
come. There's no special effort to get minorities."
"We can't go out and solicit people. We want people
who show an interest in us," says another rush chairman.
"We don't go out advertising for them. We're only
interested in people who will help our house — black,
white or yellow," says another.
