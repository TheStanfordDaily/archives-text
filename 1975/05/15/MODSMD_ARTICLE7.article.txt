This has been an eventful month for individual
freedom in the state of California. The California
Legislature admirably passed a long-overdue sex law
reform last week, but then turned around and failed to
pass a measure that would make penalties for marijuana
possession considerably more lenient.
We find much to praise in the legislature's decision to
legalize all sex acts between consenting adults. It is
embarassing that laws like the California sex statutes were
allowed to remain on the books for such a long time —
embarassing because such laws represent an imposition on
the civil rights of all citizens. And it seems ridiculous to
suppose that such laws could ever be equitably enforced,
even if their enforcement achieved some worthwhile goal.
The state's present marijuana laws contain the same
faults as the old sex laws: they are outmoded, unsound
and unenforceable. The bill that was voted down last
week would make punishment for marijuana possession
no more severe than present penalties for a parking
violation. We urge the assembly to reconsider and
approve this measure because it represents an important
first step toward what should be the legislature's ultimate
goal: the total decriminalization of marijuana.
The deficiencies in the recently-rejected bill make it a
far-from-adequate solution to the marijuana-law problem.
There seem to be no compelling or logical reasons to
provide for any penalties for marijuana use, and
legislators must force themselves to realize that keeping
marijuana possession a criminal offense is no less
arbitrary and irrational than making homosexual acts
between consenting adults a crime. And marijuana-law
enforcement has been frighteningly and wastefully
expensive.
There seems to be no acceptable excuse for the
legislators' failure on the marijuana bill. It is failure that,
we hope, they will correct as soon as possible, and thus
move toward eliminating one of the state's most
unnecessary laws.
