At the demonstration
Tuesday I heard one of your
basic young, clean-cut, white
male Stanford students remark
contemptuously, "All these
upper-middle class students out
protesting for minorities and the
Third World!" as if there was
something phony and irrelevant
about standing up for the rights
of others.
I told him that at least they
gave a damn and that was more
than the majority of
upper-middle class students were
giving. I also pointed out the
large proportion of
non-upper-middle class and
non-white people present. He
didn't argue; he just went away.
Several things could be said
about this incident, but the most
important ones concern the
nature of freedom. Our hero
didn't argue, he didn't opppose
the demonstration — he was just
very uncomfortable in a group
going to such extremes as to
exercise the rights of free speech
and assembly to protest denials
of life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, particularly others'
life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness. (I could be wrong: He
might have opposed equal

Scott Foster

opportunities for minorities and
supported American-backed
dictatorships abroad, but been
afraid to admit it.)
This shows not only a
disgusting unwillingness to
support America's greatest
contributions to the concept of
human freedom but an
incredible selfishness. Especially
it shows a class-based selfishness,
which says not, "We the
People," but "Us, the well-off
people," and "Them, the
downtrodden."
I am familiar with our hero's
feeling. Until recently, I was a
victim of it myself. It comes
from family and class insularity
and I think it is probably
widespread at Stanford.
But it can be overcome, if its
contradiction with the basic
ideals we were brought up with
is realized. I hope that in the
future we will see more
upper-middle class, white
students joining us —
upper-middle class, white
students who don't know their
place.
