# NIRT Contract Will Aid Iranians

### 
The Stanford study for National Iranian
Radio and Television has both technical and
institutional components. The technical
objectives are to design a communications
satellite system to extend television and
telephone services to as much of Iran as
possible. The system is to be implemented
in about three years. Stanford will work
closely with Iranian authorities through
design bidding and early installation phases.
This will be the first national satellite
system designed to meet the full needs of a
developing country and will have heavy
emphasis on extending services beyond the
major urban areas. The satellites can provide
communications to towns and villages at
one-third to one-tenth the cost of
conventional microwave and cable
technologies. With satellites, telephone and
television services can play a role in rural
development; previously such services were
prohibitively expensive.
We are also developing buying strategies
to promote both international competition
and Iranian manufacture. This is creating
competitive international markets able to
provide low-cost equipment suited to the
needs of many developing countries.
The institutional components of the
Stanford study are concerned with use of
television in Iranian education and with the
role of telephone and television services in
Iran's planned development. Initially,
television courses suited to international
production are being considered separately
from courses sufficiently culture-sensitive
that they should only be produced within
Iran.

Educational television at the college level
is used extensively in the United States and
in other countries. Television typically can
replace and often improve the quality of
lectures and many demonstrations.
It typically is not able to replace
textbooks, homework, interaction between
students, informal discussion with
knowledgeable teachers and guidance, all of
which are essential to learning. However, on
the adult level, lectures and demonstrations
are the major part of the cost of teaching.
Use of television can greatly reduce the
number of faculty needed to offer a wide
variety of high quality courses to adults.
Iran and other developing countries have
great need for university graduates in their
growing economies. To meet these needs,
they have sought to expand their own
university offerings with the help of faculty
from developed countries.
A component of our study is assessing
the potential of Iran to meet its needs in
college-level education through financing
production of international television
courses.
We are identifying the planning and
production techniques that will make the
courses suited, with little modification, to
the needs of a number of countries. To the
degree that this is possible, Iran can satisfy
its own needs while creating internationally
available television courses that will benefit
other countries as well.
Many subject areas on the college level
are suited to international program
production. However, it is likely that most
areas of ?dult education suited to rural

Bruce Lusignan

development goals will be very
culture-dependent and will be produced and
used only domestically.
It appears that such learning centers can
offer a wide range of adult education
throughout rural Iran at very reasonable
cost.
The specific courses needed in different
areas of Iran are not yet clearly defined. To
translate the general concept of the centers
into specifics requires a more detailed
understanding of planned development in
rural Iran.
A component of our study is, therefore,
reviewing the cultural background and the
social structure of Iran's rural population,
the current institutions offering education
and the potential impact of rural economic
growth.
In the following year, with the guidance
of Iranian planners, these factors will be
related to specific plans for the evolution of
the learning centers and their program
offerings.
To some degree, the rural development
review is intended to educate the Stanford
study group so that it will not blunder in
assumptions about Iran's rural educational
needs.
However, by working closely with
Iranian planners, we also hope to encourage
a review of rural educational objectives that
reflects flexibility offered by the use of
television in education.

in other countries. Television typically can
replace and often improve the quality of
lectures and many demonstrations.
It typically is not able to replace
textbooks, homework, interaction between
students, informal discussion with
knowledgeable teachers and guidance, all of
which are essential to learning. However, on
the adult level, lectures and demonstrations
are the major part of the cost of teaching.
Use of television can greatly reduce the
number of faculty needed to offer a wide
variety of high quality courses to adults.
Iran and other developing countries have
great need for university graduates in their
growing economies. To meet these needs,
they have sought to expand their own
university offerings with the help of faculty
from developed countries.
A component of our study is assessing
the potential of Iran to meet its needs in
college-level education through financing
production of international television
courses.
We are identifying the planning and
production techniques that will make the
courses suited, with little modification, to
the needs of a number of countries. To the
degree that this is possible, Iran can satisfy
its own needs while creating internationally
available television courses that will benefit
other countries as well.
Many subject areas on the college level
are suited to international program
production. However, it is likely that most
areas of ?dult education suited to rural

Bruce Lusignan

development goals will be very
culture-dependent and will be produced and
used only domestically.
It appears that such learning centers can
offer a wide range of adult education
throughout rural Iran at very reasonable
cost.
The specific courses needed in different
areas of Iran are not yet clearly defined. To
translate the general concept of the centers
into specifics requires a more detailed
understanding of planned development in
rural Iran.
A component of our study is, therefore,
reviewing the cultural background and the
social structure of Iran's rural population,
the current institutions offering education
and the potential impact of rural economic
growth.
In the following year, with the guidance
of Iranian planners, these factors will be
related to specific plans for the evolution of
the learning centers and their program
offerings.
To some degree, the rural development
review is intended to educate the Stanford
study group so that it will not blunder in
assumptions about Iran's rural educational
needs.
However, by working closely with
Iranian planners, we also hope to encourage
a review of rural educational objectives that
reflects flexibility offered by the use of
television in education.

The Stanford study for National Iranian
Radio and Television has both technical and
institutional components. The technical
objectives are to design a communications
satellite system to extend television and
telephone services to as much of Iran as
possible. The system is to be implemented
in about three years. Stanford will work
closely with Iranian authorities through
design bidding and early installation phases.
This will be the first national satellite
system designed to meet the full needs of a
developing country and will have heavy
emphasis on extending services beyond the
major urban areas. The satellites can provide
communications to towns and villages at
one-third to one-tenth the cost of
conventional microwave and cable
technologies. With satellites, telephone and
television services can play a role in rural
development; previously such services were
prohibitively expensive.
We are also developing buying strategies
to promote both international competition
and Iranian manufacture. This is creating
competitive international markets able to
provide low-cost equipment suited to the
needs of many developing countries.
The institutional components of the
Stanford study are concerned with use of
television in Iranian education and with the
role of telephone and television services in
Iran's planned development. Initially,
television courses suited to international
production are being considered separately
from courses sufficiently culture-sensitive
that they should only be produced within
Iran.
