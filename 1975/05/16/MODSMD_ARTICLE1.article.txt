# Bruins attempt a takeover
## Stanford netters try to hold off attacks on Pac-8 title

Put the nation's top three teams in a tournament
with five unranked squads, and what have you got?
The 1975 Pacific-Eight Conference
Championships, and one hell of a battle for first
place.
It's the same story every year. UCLA, Stanford
and USC battle for the title, while California, the
Oregons and the Washingtons do all they can to
stay out of last place.
The northern schools have already been
eliminated from title contention, after having lost
in the opening round for the umpteenth
consecutive year. So it's an all-California semifinal
round, headed by No. 1 ranked UCLA and
second-ranked Stanford.
The Bruins and Cardinals both have perhaps the
strongest and deepest teams in college tennis
history. UCLA is so powerful that last year's
Â»np-ranked collegiate player, Brian Teacher, is only
.jood enough for a second-singles position behind
freshman Billy Martin.
That fact doesn't intimidate Stanford, though.
The Cards' defending NCAA singles and doubles

champion, John Whitlinger, is also playing at
second singles. Two-time NCAA doubles champion
Jim Delaney barely edges out Whitlinger for the
top-spot.
Where does that leave USC and Cal? The Trojans
lost their three top singles players last year to
graduation and the pros, but a young lineup headed
by Butch Walts and Bruce Manson has done an
outstanding job of leading the Trojans to a
third-place national ranking.
Cal is lucky to be in the company of the other
three semifinalists. The Bears have fallen upon hard
times, and are hardly in contention for any spot
other than fourth-place.
Being ranked No. 2 forces Stanford to play USC
and, if successful against the Trojans, UCLA in
consecutive nights. The Cards have won the NCAA
title for the past two years, and the Pac-8 title last
year, so they're used to the pressure the scheduling
causes.
And if it comes down to a final-round match
between UCLA and Stanford, as it has for the past
two years, cxpect to see the most exciting tennis in
the nation this year.
