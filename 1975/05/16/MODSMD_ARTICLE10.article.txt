Stanford Tennis Coach Dick Gould started it in the college
ranks, and it's really beginningto catch on. This year San josc
State did it successfully. Next year Pepperdine and UCLA are
planning on trying it.
What is it? Indoor tennis matches. Taking a tip from the
pros who have been playing matches indoors for a number of
years, Gould bought a slightly used Sportsface carpet and
transformed Maples Pavilion into a tennis arena.
Last month, the nation's three top-ranked teams, Stanford,
UCLA and USC, clashed under the Pavilion roof to the delight
of over 12,000 fans.
The best amateur tennis in the nation was played. In one
particular match, the four top-ranked amateurs in the country
fought for a team point. UCLA's Billy Martin (No. 22) and
Brian Teacher (No. 28) played across the net from Stanford's
John Whitlinger (No. 27) and Jim Delaney (No. 36).
If the tournament goes as the seedings predict, that
fabulous doubles match will be repeated on Saturday night,
with the possibility of the match deciding the Pac-8 title.
Last month, Delaney (top) surprised Stanford fans with
amazing consistency. Tcachcr (left) dismissed Saviano (right,
getting salt pills during a break from Gould) in straight sets
giving UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett (middle right) and Gould
some interesting thoughts to mull over before this weekend.
A repeat of that memorable tennis weekend is sure to
come.
