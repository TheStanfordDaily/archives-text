# Stanford duo sees its titles double
## Pair works in harmony 
### DAVE SMITH 
A little before this time a year
ago, Stanford tennis Coach Dick
Gould had a problem. Cardinal
net star Pat DuPre, suffering from
the tendinitis in his wrist that still
bothers him today, had to sit out
of the Pac-8 tournament. And
that was the end of the Cards'
second doubles team, DuPrc and
John Whitlinger.
Luckily (as it happened) Gould
didn't have much time to think
about that problem, because at
just about the same time, Alex
Mayer, Stanford's unpredictable
first singles player, suddenly quit
the Stanford team. And that left
Jim Delaney without a doubles
partner.
"Pat and John had been an
excellent team, and of course Jim
and Alex Mayer had won the
NCAA championships the year
before," says Gould. I'd been kind
of counting on both those teams
for the Pac-B's and NCAA's.
"But then what could I do?"
he says."I really had no choice at
all. I just had to stick Jim and
John together and hope things
would come out all right."
Fortuitous Choice
The choice that Gould had to
make turns out to be one of his
best of the season. The
one-month-old team of Delaney
and Whitlinger swept through
opposition on the way to the
1974 NCAA doubles crown, even
though the sixth-seeded Delaney
had been upset in the third round
of singles competition. It was the
third year in a row that a Stanford
pair had won the crown.

And today, one year after
Delaney and Whitlinger were
forced together, opponents are
searching in vain for ways to take
them apart. The Cardinal duo is
the top-ranked college team in the
country.
"We had played a little before
the Pac-B's last year," says
Whitlinger. "'So I wasn't worried
at all about our chances. And by
now I know almost exactly what
jim's going to do and he
what I'll do. When we're playing
decently I don't think there's any
college team that can beat us."
Good Blend
"They really are an excellent team
by any standards professional
or anything else," says Gould.
"You always want to get a
powerful player who can really
put shots away matched with a
guy who moves the ball around
well, and that's exactly what they
are. They couldn't have worked
out any better."
The Whitlingcr-Delaney team
has borne out Gould's praise
numerous times during its highly
successful career. Last weekend,
the two Cards dominated the
doubles competition at the Cal
State tournament. But perhaps
the finest exhibition of how
devasting the pair can be came
during last month's Maples
Pavilion matches against the first
doubles teams from USC and
UCLA earlier this season.
Delaney's big serve and
powerful overhead smashes
complemented Whitlinger's deft
groundstrokes perfectly as the
Cards mastered first the Bruins'

Billy Martin-Brian Teacher duo
and then Trojans Butch Walts and
Bruce Manson. Both wins were in
straight sets. Neither Whitlinger
nor Delaney seems reluctant to
point out the strong points of
their play as a team.
Delaney's Forte
"We're both really quick," says
defending NCAA singles champ
Whitlinger. "He [Delaney) has a
great backhand chip return — he
can put the ball right at the other
team's feet. And he's not exactly
a little guy - he's awfully
powerful."

Of his partner, Delaney says,
"He returns really well. He sets up
a lot of points with his returns.
And we move well together. There
aren't many empty spots for an
opponent to shoot for. We've got
them all covered."
"Usually I can stop points, and
he puts them away," Whitlinger
declares. "Of course I do my share
of putting them away too."
But doesn't this team have any
weak points? Delaney pauses for a
long time before attempting that
question. "I can't really think of
any," he says finally."l guess he

returns a little better than I do
and I serve better than him. But
that's all."
No Fear
And the Cards don't seem
overly awed by their likely
opponents this weekend — the
same (JSC and UCLA duos they
defeated in Maples earlier this
year. Of the Walts-Manson team,
Whitlinger says only, "They're a
decent team." Delaney agrees,
"They're an all right team."

Whitlinger and Delancy shake hands with USC's players after a straight-set win
records, seem formidable
opponents, but Delaney says he
isn't worried. "They're not really
a bad team," he declares, "but I
don't think they've played well I
don't think we should have much
trouble with them."
But Martin naturally disagrees.
"Brian and I are an excellent
team," he says. "We complement
each other really well: He's cool
and mellow, and I'm a little more
emotional.
"It's ridiculous to think that
our losing to Whitlinger and
Delaney [at Stanford this year|

really meant much. Brian's arm
was so sore he couldn't even play
the next day against Cal. And of
course by the time we played, we
| UCLA | had already clinched the
match."
Not Overly Protective
But neither player seems to be
going too far out of his way to
protect his partner's ego. Last
weekend, for example, they met
in the singles final of the Cal State
tournament, with Delaney
mastering Whitlinger in straight
sets. "I didn't regret it at all that I
had to play my doubles partner,"
says Delaney. "That's just one of

those things."
"How could it hurt that they
played each 'other?" says Gould.
"They're both really competitive
guys. I hope they play each other
a few more times - like in the
finals of the NCAA's," he says
with a laugh.
But even if Dclaney and
Whitlinger don't meet on opposite
sides of the net at next month's
tournament, it's a good bet that
they'll still shake hands with cach
other at the tournament's end
after they've given Stanford its
fourth straight NCAA doubles
crown.
