# USC's sex symbol distracts bleacher creatures
## Butch Walts is toll, dark, handsome...and he can play 
### MARSHA ROBERTSON 
When Stanford's stream of
bleacher crcatures spends a
Saturday afternoon sharing
Coppertone and Coors, it is
generally as loyal and enthusiastic
as a die-hard Dodger fan. But on
the night of April 19, when
Stanford met USC, several eyes
were diverted from the red and
white, prompting one female fan
to ask, "How can you concentrate

on tennis with a distraction like
that?"
Although the tennis world has
been introduced to every item in
Chris ("Why doesn't someone call
me sexy?") Evert's wardrobe, the
male peacock rarely has his
feathers displayed. But when
Butch Walts walked onto the
Stanford courts in a canary-yellow
warm-up suit, Evert could have hit
an overhead in her underwear and

no one would have noticed.
Butch Walts is USC's top tennis
player. He is 6-foot-4, weighs 190
pounds, wears XL tennis shirts,
33L jeans, walks onto the court in
his size 13 tennis shoes and draws
applause merely by un/ipping his
racquet cover.
"But can he play?" asked a
loyal Stanford fan, easily
identified by his biting sarcasm
and quick wit. Although several
girls answered "Who cares?",
Walts blasted NCAA champ John
Whitlinger that evening, 6-3, 6-3.
The questions stopped and a fan
club rose out of the lloor-boards
in Maples Pavilion.
Ugly Beginning
Born in Fresno as "the ugliest
baby my parents had ever seen,"
Walts overcame this physical
handicap and won his first
tournament at the age of 7. His
father, Ken Walts, now a teaching
pro in Mcnlo Park, is credited for
his son's slicing serve and broad
baseline game.
Because Fresno is no l orest
Hills, Walts spent half of his senior
year at Woodside High School in
order to face stiff Bay Area
competition. At age 17, he was
named to the U.S. Junior Davis
Cup team and then later enrolled
at USC.
"I chose SC for a lot of
reasons, but probably because of
Coach Tolcy, Lven though I've
worked with guys like Pancho
Scgura, Tolcy has a lot ol
patience . . . the guy is always
right."
In nothing less than a
whirlwind career, Walts rode the
ladder at number 5 as a freshman.

As a sophomore, he now
commands the number 1 position.
Walts's appearance on Stanford
courts last year placcd him across
the net from Nick Saviano, where
he lost in three sets. Returning
this year to Stanford and Maplcs's
"Center Court," Walts disposed of
Whitlingcr in two quick sets.
Whit: Best Match
"I guess you could say that
Whitlingcr was my best match of
the year ... it had to be," Walts
said.
Although he played under the
eyes of solid Stanford supporters,
Whit's loyal frat bros and
frustrated lootball fans who insist

upon Ihc USC rivalry, Walts feels
that the Maples crowd was very
fair.
"Tennis is so popular in
Northern California. There really
is that advantage in drawing
crowds."
He emphasizes the lack of
attention that USC tennis teams
receive in the Los Angeles Area.
"Our own paper only covers our
matches against Stanford or
UCLA. The biggest crowd that
I've ever seen was maybe 2000
people, and that included UCLA
fans."
