# USC's sex symbol distracts bleacher creatures
## Butch Walts is toll, dark, handsome...and he can play 
### MARSHA ROBERTSON 
When Stanford's stream of
bleacher crcatures spends a
Saturday afternoon sharing
Coppertone and Coors, it is
generally as loyal and enthusiastic
as a die-hard Dodger fan. But on
the night of April 19, when
Stanford met USC, several eyes
were diverted from the red and
white, prompting one female fan
to ask, "How can you concentrate

on tennis with a distraction like
that?"
Although the tennis world has
been introduced to every item in
Chris ("Why doesn't someone call
me sexy?") Evert's wardrobe, the
male peacock rarely has his
feathers displayed. But when
Butch Walts walked onto the
Stanford courts in a canary-yellow
warm-up suit, Evert could have hit
an overhead in her underwear and

no one would have noticed.
Butch Walts is USC's top tennis
player. He is 6-foot-4, weighs 190
pounds, wears XL tennis shirts,
33L jeans, walks onto the court in
his size 13 tennis shoes and draws
applause merely by un/ipping his
racquet cover.
"But can he play?" asked a
loyal Stanford fan, easily
identified by his biting sarcasm
and quick wit. Although several
girls answered "Who cares?",
Walts blasted NCAA champ John
Whitlinger that evening, 6-3, 6-3.
The questions stopped and a fan
club rose out of the lloor-boards
in Maples Pavilion.
Ugly Beginning
Born in Fresno as "the ugliest
baby my parents had ever seen,"
Walts overcame this physical
handicap and won his first
tournament at the age of 7. His
father, Ken Walts, now a teaching
pro in Mcnlo Park, is credited for
his son's slicing serve and broad
baseline game.
Because Fresno is no l orest
Hills, Walts spent half of his senior
year at Woodside High School in
order to face stiff Bay Area
competition. At age 17, he was
named to the U.S. Junior Davis
Cup team and then later enrolled
at USC.
"I chose SC for a lot of
reasons, but probably because of
Coach Tolcy, Lven though I've
worked with guys like Pancho
Scgura, Tolcy has a lot ol
patience . . . the guy is always
right."
In nothing less than a
whirlwind career, Walts rode the
ladder at number 5 as a freshman.

As a sophomore, he now
commands the number 1 position.
Walts's appearance on Stanford
courts last year placcd him across
the net from Nick Saviano, where
he lost in three sets. Returning
this year to Stanford and Maplcs's
"Center Court," Walts disposed of
Whitlingcr in two quick sets.
Whit: Best Match
"I guess you could say that
Whitlingcr was my best match of
the year ... it had to be," Walts
said.
Although he played under the
eyes of solid Stanford supporters,
Whit's loyal frat bros and
frustrated lootball fans who insist

upon Ihc USC rivalry, Walts feels
that the Maples crowd was very
fair.
"Tennis is so popular in
Northern California. There really
is that advantage in drawing
crowds."
He emphasizes the lack of
attention that USC tennis teams
receive in the Los Angeles Area.
"Our own paper only covers our
matches against Stanford or
UCLA. The biggest crowd that
I've ever seen was maybe 2000
people, and that included UCLA
fans."

Walts attracts a following even when he's not on the court
NorCal tournament last week,
Cal's number I player Chris
Sylvan, feci the differences
between the ' northern and
southern Californians arc larger
than just spectator interest.
Sylvan, although categorized as a
northerner is originally from
Florida and prefers to associate
himself with the southern
California lifestyle.
Different Looks
"The look in southern
California is much different than
that of Stanford," says Sylvan.
"The L.A. players tend to look
more like individuals than team
members. Their dress and actions
arc a lot less rigid."
Walts agrees, adding: "Stanford
players are boring. They don't

enjoy life."
No one accused Walts of being
boring when he returned to the
Bay Area for the NorCal
championships at Alpine Hills. As
lie sauntered past the Alpine
courts in high-waisted jeans,
chunky heels, a yellow knit body
shirt and a black leather coat, a
middle-aged woman in the box
seats whistled and her eyes
followed him to the drawboards.
Martin: 'A Good Guy'
Since Walts's last Stanford
performance, his record has been
bent by both Ferdi Taygan and
Martin. Walts's most recent match
with Martin included several
tantrums, but Butch states, "Off
the court, Billy's a very nice guy.
If he's cocky, he has to be. Any
great player has to believe in

himself and maybe we're all
pretty cocky."
When questioned about what
he might like to do if he did not
play tennis, Walts hesitates and
answers, "Tennis is it. If I didn't
play professionally, I'd try to
teach at a club." Butch's interests
outside of tennis vary from the
inimitable ("I am one of the best
water skiers in Fresno") to the
unprintable.
When confronted with the
news of a fan club membership
whose number was still unknown,
Walts commented, "Arc you
serious .. . where are they?"
Glancing around at the spectators
who ambled past him, Walts
laughed, "I'm single... I'm not
engaged . . . and I'm ready when
you are."
