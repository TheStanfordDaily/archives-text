# Dick Gould: hard work, luxurious play
## Card coach's unique philosophy builds glittering tennis program 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
The man who has coached Stanford to
two consecutive NCAA tennis
championships in 1973 and 1974 and a 92-
9 record over the past five years labels
such achievements as "superficial" and
wants to impress upon his players that
"there is more to life than just tennis."
Dick Gould, 37, may look like the
stereotypical tennis coach — young,
handsome, tanned, wide "Pearl Drops"
smile — but his coaching philosophy
provides a sharp contrast to that of other
coaches who build successful programs via
endless hours of practice to the virtual
exclusion of all other activities.
"My philosophy," Gould says, "is that
when you work you work hard, and when
you play you have a good time."
The Cards put Gould's maxim to use
and then some last month when they
traveled to Los Angeles to play USC and
UCLA. The team stayed at the luxurious
Century Plaza Hotel and was an afternoon
guest of Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner at
his Beverly Hills mansion.
Working Vacation Planned
The tennis team will also probably fly
to Hawaii in the fall for "a week of fun,"
but will have to work to make it possible.
"I think tennis should be kept in
perspective with everything else," Gould
says. "You go out and win or lose a match
and not that many people on this earth
proportionally really care. I think it's really
important that these kids realize that there
is more to life than just tennis, and maybe
that's the idea we're trying to project."

Meanwhile, the Carth continue winning
(19-1 this year) and Stanford keeps
producing top professional prospects.
Gould has coached, or is presently
coaching, nine of the current top 55 men's
players in the United States, including pros
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer, ranked
fourth and 17th respectively in the nation.
Stanford never had an All-American
player before Gould came along; seven
Cards, or Indians, have since been named
All-Americans, most of them more than
once.
Recruiting Top Priority
Gould, a 1960 master's degree recipient
from Stanford, has built Stanford into a
tennis power by giving top priority to
recruiting.
"To be at the championship level,"
Gould says,"I feel you must have players
who have themselves been at .that level in
the past. Recruiting, then, is first and
foremost."
Gould initially attracted top players
such as Tanner by selling Stanford
academically, geographically and by
"selling the fact that a real personal
interest would be taken in them here, and
that there would be a lot of fun things to
do as well as work hard."
Residual Effects
Gould's recruiting success has had
residual effects. "Once you get a foot in
the door, the top players go where the
competition is," he says.
Gould recruits actively (he first
contacted Stanford's three-time
Ail-American jim Delaney in ninth grade),

but insists his recruiting techniques are
comparatively low-keyed. He has made
only two recruiting trips for Stanford
outside California in his nine years here -
once to Michigan for the National Junior
Championships in 1967, and oncc to'
Florida this year after the team played at
the University of Georgia.
"I don't think I've ever really pressured
a player," the Wilson Sporting Goods'
1974 "Coach of the Year" says. "Oncc we
dccidc on the three or four kids in the
country who we feel can help our program,
and who may have a good chance ol
admission, then we really zero in on them.
Constant Contact
"I try to stay in contact with the kids
we're rccruiting at least every week or ten
days through some source - either by
phone call, letter or maybe having an alum
contact them. I try to send them
information about the school itself that
will increase their interest in the school.
It's more than really sending them tennis
information."
One player says: "If he wants you, your
mailbox won't be empty your entire senior
year."
Gould promotes not only Stanford
tennis, but tennis in general. In 1966, he
co-foundcd Recreation Tennis, Inc., which
administers municipal tennis instruction to
over 15,000 people annually. In 1971,
Gould initiated the "Stanford Tennis
School," a two-week instructional camp, to
help finance tennis scholarships.
Non-Stop Thoughts
"The guy's thinking all the time," says
John Whitlingcr, Stanford's highest
nationally-ranked player.
Gould also wrote Tennis, Anyoro' an
instructional text which sells ove x',ooo
copies annually.
Bccausc of his youth, Gould ma> be a
more accomplished promoter and recruiter
than coach. He is sclf-admittedly "not a
great tennis mind."
"I really feel that in another few years
I'll be a pretty good coach, without making
apologies for now. I'm learning all the
time."
Tough Decisions
Gould faces a coaching dilemma that is
both enviable and frustrating he has 12

of the top collegiate players in the United
States each of whom (except for the top
player) would like to play at number one
on the ladder, and could at almost any
other school. No matter how Gould
arranges the ladder, somebody is going to
be unhappy.
"It's a tough spot for him," comments
Mark Mitchell, Stanford's seventh-ranked
player. "It's hard to be fair to all 12, and
that's part of the problem — Dick tries to
be fair to all 12. Sometimes it'd really be
better if he'd just lay down who'll play
where. But I wouldn't like to be anywhere
else, and I'm sure everybody [on the team]
feels that way."
Criticisms
One player lower on the ladder is more
critical of Gould.
"I'm left on my own more than I should
be to develop my skills. He doesn't put
people over winning, and to mc that's
wrong. I've lost a lot of respect for the
guy."
The team has met confidentially several
times recently and has apparently resolved
its own conflicts. The Cards' only concern
now is to successfully defend their Pac-8
and NCAA titles.
Gould wouldn't exactly dismiss a third
straight NCAA championship as
unimportant, but he says he is more
interested with his players' personal
development.
Superficial Accomplishments
"Sure, we've won a national
championship, or two of them, and
established ourselves as one of the top
teams in the country, but when you come
right down to it, those arc rather
superficial goals and accomplishments.
"The big thrill for me is to see someone
like John Whitlinger, who is barely number
six on the team one year, turn around the
next year and win the NCAA's. Or to see
someone like Chico Hagcy | ex-Stanford
player turned pro|, with all the
frustrations he went through his last year
after recovering from an injury come
through when the chips were rcallv down
and get to the NCAA finals."
The moral of the story? All that glitters
is not for Gould.

competition is," he says.
Gould recruits actively (he first
contacted Stanford's three-time
Ail-American jim Delaney in ninth grade),

but insists his recruiting techniques are
comparatively low-keyed. He has made
only two recruiting trips for Stanford
outside California in his nine years here -
once to Michigan for the National Junior
Championships in 1967, and oncc to'
Florida this year after the team played at
the University of Georgia.
"I don't think I've ever really pressured
a player," the Wilson Sporting Goods'
1974 "Coach of the Year" says. "Oncc we
dccidc on the three or four kids in the
country who we feel can help our program,
and who may have a good chance ol
admission, then we really zero in on them.
Constant Contact
"I try to stay in contact with the kids
we're rccruiting at least every week or ten
days through some source - either by
phone call, letter or maybe having an alum
contact them. I try to send them
information about the school itself that
will increase their interest in the school.
It's more than really sending them tennis
information."
One player says: "If he wants you, your
mailbox won't be empty your entire senior
year."
Gould promotes not only Stanford
tennis, but tennis in general. In 1966, he
co-foundcd Recreation Tennis, Inc., which
administers municipal tennis instruction to
over 15,000 people annually. In 1971,
Gould initiated the "Stanford Tennis
School," a two-week instructional camp, to
help finance tennis scholarships.
Non-Stop Thoughts
"The guy's thinking all the time," says
John Whitlingcr, Stanford's highest
nationally-ranked player.
Gould also wrote Tennis, Anyoro' an
instructional text which sells ove x',ooo
copies annually.
Bccausc of his youth, Gould ma> be a
more accomplished promoter and recruiter
than coach. He is sclf-admittedly "not a
great tennis mind."
"I really feel that in another few years
I'll be a pretty good coach, without making
apologies for now. I'm learning all the
time."
Tough Decisions
Gould faces a coaching dilemma that is
both enviable and frustrating he has 12

of the top collegiate players in the United
States each of whom (except for the top
player) would like to play at number one
on the ladder, and could at almost any
other school. No matter how Gould
arranges the ladder, somebody is going to
be unhappy.
"It's a tough spot for him," comments
Mark Mitchell, Stanford's seventh-ranked
player. "It's hard to be fair to all 12, and
that's part of the problem — Dick tries to
be fair to all 12. Sometimes it'd really be
better if he'd just lay down who'll play
where. But I wouldn't like to be anywhere
else, and I'm sure everybody [on the team]
feels that way."
Criticisms
One player lower on the ladder is more
critical of Gould.
"I'm left on my own more than I should
be to develop my skills. He doesn't put
people over winning, and to mc that's
wrong. I've lost a lot of respect for the
guy."
The team has met confidentially several
times recently and has apparently resolved
its own conflicts. The Cards' only concern
now is to successfully defend their Pac-8
and NCAA titles.
Gould wouldn't exactly dismiss a third
straight NCAA championship as
unimportant, but he says he is more
interested with his players' personal
development.
Superficial Accomplishments
"Sure, we've won a national
championship, or two of them, and
established ourselves as one of the top
teams in the country, but when you come
right down to it, those arc rather
superficial goals and accomplishments.
"The big thrill for me is to see someone
like John Whitlinger, who is barely number
six on the team one year, turn around the
next year and win the NCAA's. Or to see
someone like Chico Hagcy | ex-Stanford
player turned pro|, with all the
frustrations he went through his last year
after recovering from an injury come
through when the chips were rcallv down
and get to the NCAA finals."
The moral of the story? All that glitters
is not for Gould.

Gould and Craig Johnson watch the Cards practice


USC Coach George Toley (left) and Gould watch a match in L.A
The man who has coached Stanford to
two consecutive NCAA tennis
championships in 1973 and 1974 and a 92-
9 record over the past five years labels
such achievements as "superficial" and
wants to impress upon his players that
"there is more to life than just tennis."
Dick Gould, 37, may look like the
stereotypical tennis coach — young,
handsome, tanned, wide "Pearl Drops"
smile — but his coaching philosophy
provides a sharp contrast to that of other
coaches who build successful programs via
endless hours of practice to the virtual
exclusion of all other activities.
"My philosophy," Gould says, "is that
when you work you work hard, and when
you play you have a good time."
The Cards put Gould's maxim to use
and then some last month when they
traveled to Los Angeles to play USC and
UCLA. The team stayed at the luxurious
Century Plaza Hotel and was an afternoon
guest of Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner at
his Beverly Hills mansion.
Working Vacation Planned
The tennis team will also probably fly
to Hawaii in the fall for "a week of fun,"
but will have to work to make it possible.
"I think tennis should be kept in
perspective with everything else," Gould
says. "You go out and win or lose a match
and not that many people on this earth
proportionally really care. I think it's really
important that these kids realize that there
is more to life than just tennis, and maybe
that's the idea we're trying to project."

Meanwhile, the Carth continue winning
(19-1 this year) and Stanford keeps
producing top professional prospects.
Gould has coached, or is presently
coaching, nine of the current top 55 men's
players in the United States, including pros
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer, ranked
fourth and 17th respectively in the nation.
Stanford never had an All-American
player before Gould came along; seven
Cards, or Indians, have since been named
All-Americans, most of them more than
once.
Recruiting Top Priority
Gould, a 1960 master's degree recipient
from Stanford, has built Stanford into a
tennis power by giving top priority to
recruiting.
"To be at the championship level,"
Gould says,"I feel you must have players
who have themselves been at .that level in
the past. Recruiting, then, is first and
foremost."
Gould initially attracted top players
such as Tanner by selling Stanford
academically, geographically and by
"selling the fact that a real personal
interest would be taken in them here, and
that there would be a lot of fun things to
do as well as work hard."
Residual Effects

residual effects. "Once you get a foot in

better if he'd just lay down who'll play

Criticisms
One player lower on the ladder is more
critical of Gould.

people over winning, and to mc that's

times recently and has apparently resolved
its own conflicts. The Cards' only concern
now is to successfully defend their Pac-8
and NCAA titles.
Gould wouldn't exactly dismiss a third
straight NCAA championship as
unimportant, but he says he is more
interested with his players' personal
development.
Superficial Accomplishments
"Sure, we've won a national
championship, or two of them, and
established ourselves as one of the top
teams in the country, but when you come
right down to it, those arc rather
superficial goals and accomplishments.
"The big thrill for me is to see someone
like John Whitlinger, who is barely number
six on the team one year, turn around the
next year and win the NCAA's. Or to see
someone like Chico Hagcy | ex-Stanford
player turned pro|, with all the
frustrations he went through his last year
after recovering from an injury come
through when the chips were rcallv down
and get to the NCAA finals."
The moral of the story? All that glitters
is not for Gould.

The man who has coached Stanford to
two consecutive NCAA tennis
championships in 1973 and 1974 and a 92-
9 record over the past five years labels
such achievements as "superficial" and
wants to impress upon his players that
"there is more to life than just tennis."
Dick Gould, 37, may look like the
stereotypical tennis coach — young,
handsome, tanned, wide "Pearl Drops"
smile — but his coaching philosophy
provides a sharp contrast to that of other
coaches who build successful programs via
endless hours of practice to the virtual
exclusion of all other activities.
"My philosophy," Gould says, "is that
when you work you work hard, and when
you play you have a good time."
The Cards put Gould's maxim to use
and then some last month when they
traveled to Los Angeles to play USC and
UCLA. The team stayed at the luxurious
Century Plaza Hotel and was an afternoon
guest of Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner at
his Beverly Hills mansion.
Working Vacation Planned
The tennis team will also probably fly
to Hawaii in the fall for "a week of fun,"
but will have to work to make it possible.
"I think tennis should be kept in
perspective with everything else," Gould
says. "You go out and win or lose a match
and not that many people on this earth
proportionally really care. I think it's really
important that these kids realize that there
is more to life than just tennis, and maybe
that's the idea we're trying to project."

Meanwhile, the Carth continue winning
(19-1 this year) and Stanford keeps
producing top professional prospects.
Gould has coached, or is presently
coaching, nine of the current top 55 men's
players in the United States, including pros
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer, ranked
fourth and 17th respectively in the nation.
Stanford never had an All-American
player before Gould came along; seven
Cards, or Indians, have since been named
All-Americans, most of them more than
once.
Recruiting Top Priority
Gould, a 1960 master's degree recipient
from Stanford, has built Stanford into a
tennis power by giving top priority to
recruiting.
"To be at the championship level,"
Gould says,"I feel you must have players
who have themselves been at .that level in
the past. Recruiting, then, is first and
foremost."
Gould initially attracted top players
such as Tanner by selling Stanford
academically, geographically and by
"selling the fact that a real personal
interest would be taken in them here, and
that there would be a lot of fun things to
do as well as work hard."
Residual Effects
Gould's recruiting success has had
residual effects. "Once you get a foot in
the door, the top players go where the
competition is," he says.
Gould recruits actively (he first
contacted Stanford's three-time
Ail-American jim Delaney in ninth grade),

but insists his recruiting techniques are
comparatively low-keyed. He has made
only two recruiting trips for Stanford
outside California in his nine years here -
once to Michigan for the National Junior
Championships in 1967, and oncc to'
Florida this year after the team played at
the University of Georgia.
"I don't think I've ever really pressured
a player," the Wilson Sporting Goods'
1974 "Coach of the Year" says. "Oncc we
dccidc on the three or four kids in the
country who we feel can help our program,
and who may have a good chance ol
admission, then we really zero in on them.
Constant Contact
"I try to stay in contact with the kids
we're rccruiting at least every week or ten
days through some source - either by
phone call, letter or maybe having an alum
contact them. I try to send them
information about the school itself that
will increase their interest in the school.
It's more than really sending them tennis
information."
One player says: "If he wants you, your
mailbox won't be empty your entire senior
year."
Gould promotes not only Stanford
tennis, but tennis in general. In 1966, he
co-foundcd Recreation Tennis, Inc., which
administers municipal tennis instruction to
over 15,000 people annually. In 1971,
Gould initiated the "Stanford Tennis
School," a two-week instructional camp, to
help finance tennis scholarships.
Non-Stop Thoughts
"The guy's thinking all the time," says
John Whitlingcr, Stanford's highest
nationally-ranked player.
Gould also wrote Tennis, Anyoro' an
instructional text which sells ove x',ooo
copies annually.
Bccausc of his youth, Gould ma> be a
more accomplished promoter and recruiter
than coach. He is sclf-admittedly "not a
great tennis mind."
"I really feel that in another few years
I'll be a pretty good coach, without making
apologies for now. I'm learning all the
time."
Tough Decisions
Gould faces a coaching dilemma that is
both enviable and frustrating he has 12

of the top collegiate players in the United
States each of whom (except for the top
player) would like to play at number one
on the ladder, and could at almost any
other school. No matter how Gould
arranges the ladder, somebody is going to
be unhappy.
"It's a tough spot for him," comments
Mark Mitchell, Stanford's seventh-ranked
player. "It's hard to be fair to all 12, and
that's part of the problem — Dick tries to
be fair to all 12. Sometimes it'd really be
better if he'd just lay down who'll play
where. But I wouldn't like to be anywhere

his Beverly Hills mansion.
Working Vacation Planned
The tennis team will also probably fly
to Hawaii in the fall for "a week of fun,"
but will have to work to make it possible.
"I think tennis should be kept in
perspective with everything else," Gould
says. "You go out and win or lose a match
and not that many people on this earth
proportionally really care. I think it's really
important that these kids realize that there
is more to life than just tennis, and maybe
that's the idea we're trying to project."

Meanwhile, the Carth continue winning
(19-1 this year) and Stanford keeps
producing top professional prospects.
Gould has coached, or is presently
coaching, nine of the current top 55 men's
players in the United States, including pros
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer, ranked
fourth and 17th respectively in the nation.
Stanford never had an All-American
player before Gould came along; seven
Cards, or Indians, have since been named
All-Americans, most of them more than
once.
Recruiting Top Priority
Gould, a 1960 master's degree recipient
from Stanford, has built Stanford into a
tennis power by giving top priority to
recruiting.
"To be at the championship level,"
Gould says,"I feel you must have players
who have themselves been at .that level in
the past. Recruiting, then, is first and
foremost."
Gould initially attracted top players
such as Tanner by selling Stanford
academically, geographically and by
"selling the fact that a real personal
interest would be taken in them here, and
that there would be a lot of fun things to
do as well as work hard."
Residual Effects
Gould's recruiting success has had
residual effects. "Once you get a foot in
the door, the top players go where the
competition is," he says.
Gould recruits actively (he first
contacted Stanford's three-time
Ail-American jim Delaney in ninth grade),

but insists his recruiting techniques are
comparatively low-keyed. He has made
only two recruiting trips for Stanford
outside California in his nine years here -
once to Michigan for the National Junior
Championships in 1967, and oncc to'
Florida this year after the team played at
the University of Georgia.
"I don't think I've ever really pressured
a player," the Wilson Sporting Goods'
1974 "Coach of the Year" says. "Oncc we
dccidc on the three or four kids in the
country who we feel can help our program,
and who may have a good chance ol
admission, then we really zero in on them.
Constant Contact
"I try to stay in contact with the kids
we're rccruiting at least every week or ten
days through some source - either by
phone call, letter or maybe having an alum
contact them. I try to send them
information about the school itself that
will increase their interest in the school.
It's more than really sending them tennis
information."
One player says: "If he wants you, your
mailbox won't be empty your entire senior
year."
Gould promotes not only Stanford
tennis, but tennis in general. In 1966, he
co-foundcd Recreation Tennis, Inc., which
administers municipal tennis instruction to
over 15,000 people annually. In 1971,
Gould initiated the "Stanford Tennis
School," a two-week instructional camp, to
help finance tennis scholarships.
Non-Stop Thoughts
"The guy's thinking all the time," says
John Whitlingcr, Stanford's highest
nationally-ranked player.
Gould also wrote Tennis, Anyoro' an
instructional text which sells ove x',ooo
copies annually.
Bccausc of his youth, Gould ma> be a
more accomplished promoter and recruiter
than coach. He is sclf-admittedly "not a
great tennis mind."
"I really feel that in another few years
I'll be a pretty good coach, without making
apologies for now. I'm learning all the
time."
Tough Decisions
Gould faces a coaching dilemma that is
both enviable and frustrating he has 12

of the top collegiate players in the United
States each of whom (except for the top
player) would like to play at number one
on the ladder, and could at almost any
other school. No matter how Gould
arranges the ladder, somebody is going to
be unhappy.
"It's a tough spot for him," comments
Mark Mitchell, Stanford's seventh-ranked
player. "It's hard to be fair to all 12, and
that's part of the problem — Dick tries to
be fair to all 12. Sometimes it'd really be
better if he'd just lay down who'll play
where. But I wouldn't like to be anywhere
else, and I'm sure everybody [on the team]
feels that way."
Criticisms
One player lower on the ladder is more
critical of Gould.
"I'm left on my own more than I should
be to develop my skills. He doesn't put
people over winning, and to mc that's
wrong. I've lost a lot of respect for the
guy."
The team has met confidentially several
times recently and has apparently resolved
its own conflicts. The Cards' only concern
now is to successfully defend their Pac-8
and NCAA titles.
Gould wouldn't exactly dismiss a third
straight NCAA championship as
unimportant, but he says he is more
interested with his players' personal
development.
Superficial Accomplishments
"Sure, we've won a national
championship, or two of them, and
established ourselves as one of the top
teams in the country, but when you come
right down to it, those arc rather
superficial goals and accomplishments.
"The big thrill for me is to see someone
like John Whitlinger, who is barely number
six on the team one year, turn around the
next year and win the NCAA's. Or to see
someone like Chico Hagcy | ex-Stanford
player turned pro|, with all the
frustrations he went through his last year
after recovering from an injury come
through when the chips were rcallv down
and get to the NCAA finals."
The moral of the story? All that glitters
is not for Gould.
