# Sandy Mayer returns home...almost
## Ex-NCAA star now a WTT professional 
### DAN PYNE 
OAKLAND - Alex "Sandy" Mayer, Stanford's
former NCAA singles and doubles tennis champion,
was back in his old stomping grounds this week.
Well, almost.
Mayer appeared in the uniform of the New York
Sets for a World Team Tennis match with the
Golden Gatcrs at Oakland Coliseum Tuesday night.
The mustache was gone, the hair maybe a little
shorter, but as Mayer warmed up, the game looked
the same.
Well, almost.
Though the Sets won a close decision, Sandy
Mayer was nothing to write home about. He
dropped the men's singles match 6-1 to Tom
Okker, then lost a men's doubles match (teamed
with Fred Stolle), to Okker and Frew MacMillan.
Likes WTT
But the ex-Cardinal star was unphased, praising
the WTT format after the match.
"I think it's great," he said. "Why? Because it's
fast, because it's interesting, because it's exciting.
You couldn't have anything more exciting than the
match tonight."
Mayer said WTT is "tons of tennis. You get a lot
more practice and a lot more coaching than you
normally would; and you play more games over the
season."
Looking back, Mayer said that his career as a
professional has not been rosy. "When I turned pro,
I thought that after playing with pros as an amateur
the transition for me would be easy. I was wrong.

It's tougher than I thought it would be, and a lot of
it has been a real grind."
Against Okker the former NCAA champ was
grinding.
False First Look
At first it looked like a classic match-up, cool
and calm Sandy Mayer against the hyperactive
Okker. Mayer's service is a clean, smooth motion;
Okkcr's is a quick and strenuous snap. That energy
made a difference.
Okker hard, well-placed shots which,
combined with some crippled returns by Mayer,
was good enough for the win. Mayer and Stolle had
problems in the doubles, dropping a 7-6 decision.
Mayer said he has worked hard as a pro to
improve his game, and that his performance this
winter was "satisfactory."
After the match Mayer was besieged by friends
and by little kids looking for authographs.
Somebody brought him a sandwich. John
Whitlinger was at the match, as was Mayer's
younger brother, Gene. Everyone was happy,
especially Sets Coach Bi I lie Jean King.
Oh yes, and Mayer made a prediction for the
NCAA title. "I hate to say it, but UCLA by a
note." He would not pick a singles champion.
"Billy Martin is certainly beatable," he said, "but
it's too close to call."
The lights dimmed and the Coliseum emptied,
and on the side of the court Sandy Mayer ate his
sandwich and talked to his friends. Back home
again. Well, almost.
