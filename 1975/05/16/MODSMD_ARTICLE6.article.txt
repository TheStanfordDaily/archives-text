# Second-string is first class
## Cardinal back-ups better than most regular squads 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Jake Wardc has won more
national tennis titles than anyone
on the Stanford tennis team
except for the defending NCAA
champion, John Whitlinger.
Perry Wright was ranked

nationally as the number one
doubles player last year.
Chip Fisher was the 1973 and
1974 Nor-Cal Intercollegiate
doubles champion.
Craig Johnson was a
nationally-ranked junior player

and just recently beat the number
four man from UCLA.
Each of these men is serious
about his tennis. Each of them
plays for Stanford, but none of
them arc among the top seven on
the team.
Along with Tim Noonan and
Alex Cortez, these players make
Stanford's second front (the six
players after the top seven)
probably the best second string in
the nation.
"It's very possible that the
second six players would fare very
well against the top teams in the
nation," says Coach Dick Gould.
Fisher, a senior who plans to
turn pro this summer, agrees, and
adds that the second front could
possibly beat every team in the
Pac-8 except for USC, UCLA and
Cal.
And even Cal might not be
better than the second string.

Although comparative statistics
usually aren't too reliable in
sports, the fact remains that
Stanford's second string beat
Foothill College's highly-rated
tennis team by an 8-1 score. Cal
was only able to edge the same
Foothill squad by a 5-4 margin.
Some players are naturally not
delighted with only being on the
second team, but the rewards
sometimes allow one to overlook
the drawbacks. "[Being on the
second-string] can't help but
bother you," says Warde, who had
no equal in the U.S. as a junior
player. "But there are a lot of
good things about it, too."
Some of the benefits Warde
mentions arc the good times that
he has on the Stanford team, and
the advantage of practicing with

the best college tennis players in
the nation.
Warde says he has no regrets
about coming to Stanford or
playing on the second-string, and
adds that his game has definitely
improved because of his playing
here.
Fisher, who has beaten touring
pro John Holladay and Brian
Teacher in straight sets, says he
has no regrets either.
Fisher admits that if his sole
interest was tennis, Stanford may
not have been the best choice.
"When you arc always playing
people better than you arc, you
lose the habit of winning," he
says.
"When I play someone like
Whitlingcr and lose, I can just
shake it off by saying that they're
better than me," he says. That's a

bad habit to get into, he adds.
Fisher, who has seen more
glamorous days as a Stanford
player, insists that Coach Gould
has given him a fair shake as a
player, "and if there is anyone to
blame, it's me."
Johnson played at number 12
as a freshman, and has been
moving up ever since. This
weekend, Johnson is slated to sec
some singles and a lot of doubles
activity. He says he knows that if
he'd gone to another school, he
could have played in a number
one slot. But, he says, the fame is
not what's important.
"What's important," says
Johnson, summing up the feelings
of most of the second stringers
"is when I graduate, I know I'll be
a better tennis player."

player, insists that Coach Gould
has given him a fair shake as a
player, "and if there is anyone to
blame, it's me."
Johnson played at number 12
as a freshman, and has been
moving up ever since. This
weekend, Johnson is slated to sec
some singles and a lot of doubles
activity. He says he knows that if
he'd gone to another school, he
could have played in a number
one slot. But, he says, the fame is
not what's important.
"What's important," says
Johnson, summing up the feelings
of most of the second stringers
"is when I graduate, I know I'll be
a better tennis player."
Jake Wardc has won more
national tennis titles than anyone
on the Stanford tennis team
except for the defending NCAA
champion, John Whitlinger.
Perry Wright was ranked

nationally as the number one
doubles player last year.
Chip Fisher was the 1973 and
1974 Nor-Cal Intercollegiate
doubles champion.
Craig Johnson was a
nationally-ranked junior player

and just recently beat the number
four man from UCLA.
Each of these men is serious
about his tennis. Each of them
plays for Stanford, but none of
them arc among the top seven on
the team.
Along with Tim Noonan and
Alex Cortez, these players make
Stanford's second front (the six
players after the top seven)
probably the best second string in
the nation.
"It's very possible that the
second six players would fare very
well against the top teams in the
nation," says Coach Dick Gould.
Fisher, a senior who plans to
turn pro this summer, agrees, and
adds that the second front could
possibly beat every team in the
Pac-8 except for USC, UCLA and
Cal.
And even Cal might not be
better than the second string.

Jake Warde maneuvers for a tough volley


Chip Fisher practices his serves
Although comparative statistics
usually aren't too reliable in
sports, the fact remains that
Stanford's second string beat
Foothill College's highly-rated
tennis team by an 8-1 score. Cal
was only able to edge the same
Foothill squad by a 5-4 margin.
Some players are naturally not
delighted with only being on the
second team, but the rewards
sometimes allow one to overlook
the drawbacks. "[Being on the
second-string] can't help but
bother you," says Warde, who had
no equal in the U.S. as a junior
player. "But there are a lot of
good things about it, too."
Some of the benefits Warde
mentions arc the good times that
he has on the Stanford team, and
the advantage of practicing with

the best college tennis players in
the nation.
Warde says he has no regrets
about coming to Stanford or
playing on the second-string, and
adds that his game has definitely
improved because of his playing
here.
Fisher, who has beaten touring
pro John Holladay and Brian
Teacher in straight sets, says he
has no regrets either.
Fisher admits that if his sole
interest was tennis, Stanford may
not have been the best choice.
"When you arc always playing
people better than you arc, you
lose the habit of winning," he
says.
"When I play someone like
Whitlingcr and lose, I can just
shake it off by saying that they're
better than me," he says. That's a

bad habit to get into, he adds.
Fisher, who has seen more
glamorous days as a Stanford
player, insists that Coach Gould
has given him a fair shake as a
player, "and if there is anyone to
blame, it's me."
