# Second-string is first class
## Cardinal back-ups better than most regular squads

Jake Wardc has won more
national tennis titles than anyone
on the Stanford tennis team
except for the defending NCAA
champion, John Whitlinger.
Perry Wright was ranked

nationally as the number one
doubles player last year.
Chip Fisher was the 1973 and
1974 Nor-Cal Intercollegiate
doubles champion.
Craig Johnson was a
nationally-ranked junior player

and just recently beat the number
four man from UCLA.
Each of these men is serious
about his tennis. Each of them
plays for Stanford, but none of
them arc among the top seven on
the team.
Along with Tim Noonan and
Alex Cortez, these players make
Stanford's second front (the six
players after the top seven)
probably the best second string in
the nation.
"It's very possible that the
second six players would fare very
well against the top teams in the
nation," says Coach Dick Gould.
Fisher, a senior who plans to
turn pro this summer, agrees, and
adds that the second front could
possibly beat every team in the
Pac-8 except for USC, UCLA and
Cal.
And even Cal might not be
better than the second string.
