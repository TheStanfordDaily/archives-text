# Pac-8 tourney isn't the only one around
## Berkeley contest draws Stanford's winning women 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The Pac-8 men's tennis finals in
Maples Pavilion aren't the only
game in town this weekend.
The Stanford women's tennis
team is expected to dominate the
Northern California
In tercol legiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) playoffs
Saturday at UC-Berkeley.
Stanford will face UC-Davis in
division one of a round robin
tournament. Berkeley meets
Fresno State in division two.

"It will probably turn out like
the Fresno Invitational two weeks
ago where we beat all those
teams," Coach Curley Neal said.
The Cards' season record is
enough to make opponents
consider staying at home;
Stanford last month defeated
Fresno State 6-0 and Davis 5-0 in
dual meets.
And at last weekend's UCLA
Invitational, Stanford's top singles
and doubles players scored
convincing wins over Berkeley's

best. The Cards won 26 of 27
matches, outscoring UCLA, USC
and Cal for the tournament title.
The number one singles spot
has flip-flopped from freshman
Lele Forood to sophomore Marcy
O'Keefe. Close behind them,
seniors Andrea Barnes, Tracy
McNair and Whitney Grant,
freshman )oy Hahn and Nancy
Rudd, and sophomores Liza
Pande and Nancy Anderson
challenge each other for places in
the top six.
So volatile are the ladder
positions that Neal is still unsure
which six players will travel to
Kalamazoo, Michigan for the
national finals, June 16-21.
But she is certain that O'Keefe
and Forood will play number one
and two singles at Berkeley this
weekend, with Pande-Grant
playing doubles. NCI AC tourneys
involve only two singles players
and one doubles team from each
school.
Although conference rules
permit a player to participate in
both singles and doubles, Neal
chose not to enter the number
one team of O'Keefe-Forood in
the doubles event. "It's our
personal preference to use as
many players as possible," she
explains.
This philosophy has nurtured a
bumper crop of women's tennis
talent at Stanford;, the Cards'

sccond team last weekend tied the
UC-Davis first team for the
Modesto Invitational title.
"Curlcy Ncal has created the
base for a fine team," says men's
Coach Dick Gould, who will

supervise women's competitive
tennis activity here next year
when Neal returns to full time
teaching. Gould, as director of
tennis, will select a new women's
coach over the summer.

team is expected to dominate the
Northern California
In tercol legiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) playoffs
Saturday at UC-Berkeley.
Stanford will face UC-Davis in
division one of a round robin
tournament. Berkeley meets
Fresno State in division two.

"It will probably turn out like
the Fresno Invitational two weeks
ago where we beat all those
teams," Coach Curley Neal said.
The Cards' season record is
enough to make opponents
consider staying at home;
Stanford last month defeated
Fresno State 6-0 and Davis 5-0 in
dual meets.
And at last weekend's UCLA
Invitational, Stanford's top singles
and doubles players scored
convincing wins over Berkeley's

best. The Cards won 26 of 27
matches, outscoring UCLA, USC
and Cal for the tournament title.
The number one singles spot
has flip-flopped from freshman
Lele Forood to sophomore Marcy
O'Keefe. Close behind them,
seniors Andrea Barnes, Tracy
McNair and Whitney Grant,
freshman )oy Hahn and Nancy
Rudd, and sophomores Liza
Pande and Nancy Anderson
challenge each other for places in
the top six.
So volatile are the ladder
positions that Neal is still unsure
which six players will travel to
Kalamazoo, Michigan for the
national finals, June 16-21.
But she is certain that O'Keefe
and Forood will play number one
and two singles at Berkeley this
weekend, with Pande-Grant
playing doubles. NCI AC tourneys
involve only two singles players
and one doubles team from each
school.
Although conference rules
permit a player to participate in
both singles and doubles, Neal
chose not to enter the number
one team of O'Keefe-Forood in
the doubles event. "It's our
personal preference to use as
many players as possible," she
explains.
This philosophy has nurtured a
bumper crop of women's tennis
talent at Stanford;, the Cards'

sccond team last weekend tied the
UC-Davis first team for the
Modesto Invitational title.
"Curlcy Ncal has created the
base for a fine team," says men's
Coach Dick Gould, who will

supervise women's competitive
tennis activity here next year
when Neal returns to full time
teaching. Gould, as director of
tennis, will select a new women's
coach over the summer.
