# Mild -mannered Martin is Superfrosh

Right now, Billy Martin is a
better tennis player than jimmy
Connors was at the same stage of
his career.

UCLA Coach
The slight, blond-haired youth
squirms in the plush leather chair
and yawns impatiently. So this is
the next jimmy Connors?
Staring into Billy Martin's
boyish face and listening to his
squeaky, unrefined speech, the
visitor finds it hard to believe. The
host of the richly furnished Santa
Monica apartment seems to be
just another UCLA freshman,
battling for an identity among the
Westwood mobs and trying to
decide whether to go into
economics or psychology.
But there is no denying it.
Once the mild-mannered Martin
plants his 5-foot-9, 145-pound
frame on a tennis court, he is
indeed transformed into
Superfrosh.
Young Start
At the age of 18, the whiz kid
from Palos Verdes has already
defeated Stan Smith, Tom
Gorman and several other
professionals in tournament play;
whipped Stanford's John
Whitlinger, the defending NCAA
champ, twice; and established
himself as the world's premier
amateur tennis player.
Heading into this weekend's
league championship, Martin has
enjoyed a "perfect season" as the
No. 1 player on the nation's No. 1
college team. In addition to his
wins over Whit, Martin has scored
notable decisions over Stanford's
Jim Delancy and USC's Butch
Walts, two other NCAA
contenders, and has led his Bruins
to an undefeated season.
In the process, Martin has

amassed a myriad of reputations
that run the gamut from "a cocky
prima donna" to "the
temperamental crybaby" to "the
straight-laced, no-nonsense" athlete.
It seems no one knows quite
what to make of this new kid on
the block. It's obvious that he can
play tennis a bit, but beyond that,
Billy Martin is the most
misunderstood character since Dr.
Pepper.
Two-Fisted Shot
The confusion began as far
back as 11 years ago, when
Martin first started whacking at

the fuzz ball. As a seven-year-old,
he was so weak he had to use
two hands to hit a backhand, but
he immediately took to the game.
Cajoled by his parents, Martin
began to eschew the escapades of
his peers and plunged head-first
into tennis.
"But I became sort of an
outcast," Martin recalls. "It
seemed like I was always
practicing tennis instead of
goofing around with the guys. It's
hard to make any real good
friends that way, and I must

admit, that bothered me some."
At the age of 10, Martin says,
he really "got serious" about
tennis, practicing "7-8 hours a
day." Maintaining his dedication,
as well as his two-fisted backhand,
he quickly moved up in the
juniors rankings.
"My parents convinced me that
devoting myself to tennis would
be better for me in the long run,"
Martin says. "They've been my
moral supporters all the way.
Different Desires
"But it irritated me that people
looked down on me for doing

what I wanted to do," he says."I
didn't consider myself any better
or worse than them. It's just that
what I wanted to do with my life
was different."
Last year as the No. 1 junior
player in the United States,
Martin walked away with the
Junior singles crowns at
Wimbledon and Forest Hills. He
had developed into the most
sought-after tennis player in the
nation, and he opted to attend
UCLA where he could continue to
work with his coach, Glenn
Bassett.
Playing under the shadow of
ex-Bruins such as Connors (1971
NCAA champ), Arthur Ashe
(1965 NCAA champ), Charles
Pasarcll and Jeff Borowiak (1970
NCAA champ), Martin has
responded remarkably well this
year.
Successful Season
He decisively beat out
teammate Brian Teacher, last
year's top seeded player in the
NCAA's, for the right to play top
singles for UCLA, and he has lost
only one match all year, that to
San Jose State's Hank Pfister.
But when people compare
Martin to Jimmy Connors, it is
usually more than just a reference
to his tennis prowess.
Martin's on-court behavior
sometimes alienates crowds, and
has causcd fans to draw parallels
with Connors, the noted "Badboy
of Tennis."
Martin thinks such
comparisons are unfair.
"Some of the things Jimmy
docs I really don't agree with,"
Martin declares. "Some of them
arc amazing. Almost indecent. I
don't think I've ever done
anything Ike that. I'll stand up for
what I think is right on a line call
and I like to talk to mvself on the
