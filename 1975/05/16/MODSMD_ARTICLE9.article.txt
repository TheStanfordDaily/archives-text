Right now, Billy Martin is a
better tennis player than jimmy
Connors was at the same stage of
his career.
—Glenn Bassett,
UCLA Coach
The slight, blond-haired youth
squirms in the plush leather chair
and yawns impatiently. So this is
the next jimmy Connors?
Staring into Billy Martin's
boyish face and listening to his
squeaky, unrefined speech, the
visitor finds it hard to believe. The
host of the richly furnished Santa
Monica apartment seems to be
just another UCLA freshman,
battling for an identity among the
Westwood mobs and trying to
decide whether to go into
economics or psychology.
But there is no denying it.
Once the mild-mannered Martin
plants his 5-foot-9, 145-pound
frame on a tennis court, he is
indeed transformed into
Superfrosh.
Young Start
At the age of 18, the whiz kid
from Palos Verdes has already
defeated Stan Smith, Tom
Gorman and several other
professionals in tournament play;
whipped Stanford's John
Whitlinger, the defending NCAA
champ, twice; and established
himself as the world's premier
amateur tennis player.
Heading into this weekend's
league championship, Martin has
enjoyed a "perfect season" as the
No. 1 player on the nation's No. 1
college team. In addition to his
wins over Whit, Martin has scored
notable decisions over Stanford's
Jim Delancy and USC's Butch
Walts, two other NCAA
contenders, and has led his Bruins
to an undefeated season.
In the process, Martin has

amassed a myriad of reputations
that run the gamut from "a cocky
prima donna" to "the
temperamental crybaby" to "the
straight-laced, no-nonsense" athlete.
It seems no one knows quite
what to make of this new kid on
the block. It's obvious that he can
play tennis a bit, but beyond that,
Billy Martin is the most
misunderstood character since Dr.
Pepper.
Two-Fisted Shot
The confusion began as far
back as 11 years ago, when
Martin first started whacking at

the fuzz ball. As a seven-year-old,
he was so weak he had to use
two hands to hit a backhand, but
he immediately took to the game.
Cajoled by his parents, Martin
began to eschew the escapades of
his peers and plunged head-first
into tennis.
"But I became sort of an
outcast," Martin recalls. "It
seemed like I was always
practicing tennis instead of
goofing around with the guys. It's
hard to make any real good
friends that way, and I must

admit, that bothered me some."
At the age of 10, Martin says,
he really "got serious" about
tennis, practicing "7-8 hours a
day." Maintaining his dedication,
as well as his two-fisted backhand,
he quickly moved up in the
juniors rankings.
"My parents convinced me that
devoting myself to tennis would
be better for me in the long run,"
Martin says. "They've been my
moral supporters all the way.
Different Desires
"But it irritated me that people
looked down on me for doing

what I wanted to do," he says."I
didn't consider myself any better
or worse than them. It's just that
what I wanted to do with my life
was different."
Last year as the No. 1 junior
player in the United States,
Martin walked away with the
Junior singles crowns at
Wimbledon and Forest Hills. He
had developed into the most
sought-after tennis player in the
nation, and he opted to attend
UCLA where he could continue to
work with his coach, Glenn
Bassett.
Playing under the shadow of
ex-Bruins such as Connors (1971
NCAA champ), Arthur Ashe
(1965 NCAA champ), Charles
Pasarcll and Jeff Borowiak (1970
NCAA champ), Martin has
responded remarkably well this
year.
Successful Season
He decisively beat out
teammate Brian Teacher, last
year's top seeded player in the
NCAA's, for the right to play top
singles for UCLA, and he has lost
only one match all year, that to
San Jose State's Hank Pfister.
But when people compare
Martin to Jimmy Connors, it is
usually more than just a reference
to his tennis prowess.
Martin's on-court behavior
sometimes alienates crowds, and
has causcd fans to draw parallels
with Connors, the noted "Badboy
of Tennis."
Martin thinks such
comparisons are unfair.
"Some of the things Jimmy
docs I really don't agree with,"
Martin declares. "Some of them
arc amazing. Almost indecent. I
don't think I've ever done
anything Ike that. I'll stand up for
what I think is right on a line call
and I like to talk to mvself on the

Superfrosh Billy Martin: two different personalities, on and off the court
court, but I never try to bother an
opponent and I don't even talk to
the crowd."
But Martin realizes that fans
will always have their prejudices.
"As long as you're in the
limelight, people will make
judgments without knowing
anything. Maybe if they got to
know me they'd change their
opinion, but I can't do anything
about that. I can't worry about
what the papers or other people
say, because once I do, I lose my
concentration and it hurts my
game,"
jimmy Connors was quoted
recently in a national publication
as saying he went to UCLA just to
win the NCAA singles title. After
watching Martin this season, some
have suggested he is following a
similar course.
"First of all," Martin replies, "I
doubt that jimmy made that
statement. And as for myself, I
found out a lot of players from
other schools think I pay people
to go to my classes and that I'm
always on the courts.
"Well, that's a bunch of
baloney! There's no way you can
do that at a school like UCLA.
You have to take care of your
school work here."
Martin, says he "really enjoys
college," and hopes to finish
school someday. He says he hasn't
yet made up his mind about
turning pro after this year, but
when he does, the choice won't
have anything to do with

academics.
"My decision will be based on
what's best for my tennis game,"
he says. "Right now, turning pro
would probably hurt me. I don't
think I'm ready yet to compete
with the top players week in and
week out. But after the NCAA's,
I'll see how my game is. If I think
it's good enough to do well in the
pros. I'll give up school. If not, I'll
stay another year.
"You know,"he continues, "the
pro circuit is not really such a
glamorous thing. There's a lot of
money to be made, but it can get
awful lonely and tiring being
away, staying in hotel rooms
12-16 weeks at a time, and with
no one my age around. I have to
remember, once I turn pro, there's
no turning back."
Despite his reservations, there
is no doubt that Billy Martin is
shooting to be the best tennis
player in the world, and with his
tremendous competitiveness, he's
got a shot at it.
"I think I'm at least 3 or 4 years
away," he says. "I've got a lot of
work ahead of me, but I'm going
to work as hard as I can."
For 11 years, Billy Martin's
life has revolved around tennis. He
says if it weren't for the sport
he'd "probably go crazy." He's
had to make tremendous sacrifices
and at times it's been tough, but
when someone mentions the glory
of being number one, or even
$500,000 paychecks, a smile
slowly spreads across his youthful
countenance. It's Billy Martin's
way of saying "it was worth it."

yet made up his mind about
turning pro after this year, but
when he does, the choice won't
have anything to do with

academics.
"My decision will be based on
what's best for my tennis game,"
he says. "Right now, turning pro
would probably hurt me. I don't
think I'm ready yet to compete
with the top players week in and
week out. But after the NCAA's,
I'll see how my game is. If I think
it's good enough to do well in the
pros. I'll give up school. If not, I'll
stay another year.
"You know,"he continues, "the
pro circuit is not really such a
glamorous thing. There's a lot of
money to be made, but it can get
awful lonely and tiring being
away, staying in hotel rooms
12-16 weeks at a time, and with
no one my age around. I have to
remember, once I turn pro, there's
no turning back."
Despite his reservations, there
is no doubt that Billy Martin is
shooting to be the best tennis
player in the world, and with his
tremendous competitiveness, he's
got a shot at it.
"I think I'm at least 3 or 4 years
away," he says. "I've got a lot of
work ahead of me, but I'm going
to work as hard as I can."
For 11 years, Billy Martin's
life has revolved around tennis. He
says if it weren't for the sport
he'd "probably go crazy." He's
had to make tremendous sacrifices
and at times it's been tough, but
when someone mentions the glory
of being number one, or even
$500,000 paychecks, a smile
slowly spreads across his youthful
countenance. It's Billy Martin's
way of saying "it was worth it."

The slight, blond-haired youth
squirms in the plush leather chair
and yawns impatiently. So this is
the next jimmy Connors?
Staring into Billy Martin's
boyish face and listening to his
squeaky, unrefined speech, the
visitor finds it hard to believe. The
host of the richly furnished Santa
Monica apartment seems to be
just another UCLA freshman,
battling for an identity among the

But there is no denying it.
Once the mild-mannered Martin
plants his 5-foot-9, 145-pound
frame on a tennis court, he is
indeed transformed into
Superfrosh.
Young Start
At the age of 18, the whiz kid
from Palos Verdes has already
defeated Stan Smith, Tom
Gorman and several other
professionals in tournament play;
whipped Stanford's John
Whitlinger, the defending NCAA
champ, twice; and established
himself as the world's premier
amateur tennis player.
Heading into this weekend's
league championship, Martin has
enjoyed a "perfect season" as the
No. 1 player on the nation's No. 1
college team. In addition to his
wins over Whit, Martin has scored
notable decisions over Stanford's
Jim Delancy and USC's Butch
Walts, two other NCAA
contenders, and has led his Bruins
to an undefeated season.
In the process, Martin has

amassed a myriad of reputations
that run the gamut from "a cocky
prima donna" to "the
temperamental crybaby" to "the
straight-laced, no-nonsense" athlete.
It seems no one knows quite
what to make of this new kid on
the block. It's obvious that he can
play tennis a bit, but beyond that,
Billy Martin is the most
misunderstood character since Dr.
Pepper.
Two-Fisted Shot
The confusion began as far
back as 11 years ago, when
Martin first started whacking at

the fuzz ball. As a seven-year-old,
he was so weak he had to use
two hands to hit a backhand, but
he immediately took to the game.
Cajoled by his parents, Martin
began to eschew the escapades of
his peers and plunged head-first
into tennis.
"But I became sort of an
outcast," Martin recalls. "It
seemed like I was always
practicing tennis instead of
goofing around with the guys. It's
hard to make any real good
friends that way, and I must

admit, that bothered me some."
At the age of 10, Martin says,
he really "got serious" about
tennis, practicing "7-8 hours a
day." Maintaining his dedication,
as well as his two-fisted backhand,
he quickly moved up in the
juniors rankings.
"My parents convinced me that
devoting myself to tennis would
be better for me in the long run,"
Martin says. "They've been my
moral supporters all the way.
Different Desires
"But it irritated me that people
looked down on me for doing

what I wanted to do," he says."I
didn't consider myself any better
or worse than them. It's just that
what I wanted to do with my life
was different."
Last year as the No. 1 junior
player in the United States,
Martin walked away with the
Junior singles crowns at
Wimbledon and Forest Hills. He
had developed into the most
sought-after tennis player in the
nation, and he opted to attend
UCLA where he could continue to
work with his coach, Glenn
Bassett.
Playing under the shadow of
ex-Bruins such as Connors (1971
NCAA champ), Arthur Ashe
(1965 NCAA champ), Charles
Pasarcll and Jeff Borowiak (1970
NCAA champ), Martin has
responded remarkably well this
year.
Successful Season
He decisively beat out
teammate Brian Teacher, last
year's top seeded player in the
NCAA's, for the right to play top
singles for UCLA, and he has lost
only one match all year, that to
San Jose State's Hank Pfister.
But when people compare
Martin to Jimmy Connors, it is
usually more than just a reference
to his tennis prowess.
Martin's on-court behavior
sometimes alienates crowds, and
has causcd fans to draw parallels
with Connors, the noted "Badboy
of Tennis."
Martin thinks such
comparisons are unfair.
"Some of the things Jimmy
docs I really don't agree with,"
Martin declares. "Some of them
arc amazing. Almost indecent. I
don't think I've ever done
anything Ike that. I'll stand up for
what I think is right on a line call

Superfrosh Billy Martin: two different personalities, on and off the court
court, but I never try to bother an

But Martin realizes that fans
will always have their prejudices.
"As long as you're in the
limelight, people will make
judgments without knowing
anything. Maybe if they got to
know me they'd change their
opinion, but I can't do anything
about that. I can't worry about
what the papers or other people
say, because once I do, I lose my
concentration and it hurts my
game,"
jimmy Connors was quoted
recently in a national publication
as saying he went to UCLA just to
win the NCAA singles title. After
watching Martin this season, some
have suggested he is following a
similar course.
"First of all," Martin replies, "I
doubt that jimmy made that
statement. And as for myself, I
found out a lot of players from
other schools think I pay people
to go to my classes and that I'm
always on the courts.
"Well, that's a bunch of
baloney! There's no way you can
do that at a school like UCLA.
You have to take care of your
school work here."
Martin, says he "really enjoys

But Martin realizes that fans
will always have their prejudices.
"As long as you're in the

anything. Maybe if they got to

about that. I can't worry about
what the papers or other people

jimmy Connors was quoted

win the NCAA singles title. After

have suggested he is following a

"First of all," Martin replies, "I
doubt that jimmy made that
statement. And as for myself, I
found out a lot of players from
other schools think I pay people
to go to my classes and that I'm
always on the courts.
"Well, that's a bunch of
baloney! There's no way you can
do that at a school like UCLA.
You have to take care of your
school work here."
Martin, says he "really enjoys
college," and hopes to finish
school someday. He says he hasn't
yet made up his mind about
turning pro after this year, but
when he does, the choice won't
have anything to do with

academics.
"My decision will be based on
what's best for my tennis game,"
he says. "Right now, turning pro
would probably hurt me. I don't
think I'm ready yet to compete

week out. But after the NCAA's,
I'll see how my game is. If I think
it's good enough to do well in the
pros. I'll give up school. If not, I'll
stay another year.
"You know,"he continues, "the
pro circuit is not really such a
glamorous thing. There's a lot of
money to be made, but it can get
awful lonely and tiring being
away, staying in hotel rooms
12-16 weeks at a time, and with
no one my age around. I have to
remember, once I turn pro, there's
no turning back."
Despite his reservations, there
is no doubt that Billy Martin is
shooting to be the best tennis
player in the world, and with his
tremendous competitiveness, he's
got a shot at it.
"I think I'm at least 3 or 4 years
away," he says. "I've got a lot of
work ahead of me, but I'm going
to work as hard as I can."
For 11 years, Billy Martin's
life has revolved around tennis. He
says if it weren't for the sport
he'd "probably go crazy." He's
had to make tremendous sacrifices
and at times it's been tough, but
when someone mentions the glory
of being number one, or even
$500,000 paychecks, a smile

The slight, blond-haired youth
squirms in the plush leather chair
and yawns impatiently. So this is
the next jimmy Connors?
Staring into Billy Martin's
boyish face and listening to his
squeaky, unrefined speech, the
visitor finds it hard to believe. The
host of the richly furnished Santa
Monica apartment seems to be
just another UCLA freshman,
battling for an identity among the
Westwood mobs and trying to
decide whether to go into
economics or psychology.
But there is no denying it.
Once the mild-mannered Martin
plants his 5-foot-9, 145-pound
frame on a tennis court, he is
indeed transformed into
Superfrosh.
Young Start
At the age of 18, the whiz kid
from Palos Verdes has already
defeated Stan Smith, Tom
Gorman and several other
professionals in tournament play;
whipped Stanford's John
Whitlinger, the defending NCAA
champ, twice; and established
himself as the world's premier
amateur tennis player.
Heading into this weekend's
league championship, Martin has
enjoyed a "perfect season" as the
No. 1 player on the nation's No. 1
college team. In addition to his
wins over Whit, Martin has scored
notable decisions over Stanford's
Jim Delancy and USC's Butch
Walts, two other NCAA
contenders, and has led his Bruins
to an undefeated season.
In the process, Martin has

amassed a myriad of reputations
that run the gamut from "a cocky
prima donna" to "the
temperamental crybaby" to "the
straight-laced, no-nonsense" athlete.
It seems no one knows quite
what to make of this new kid on
the block. It's obvious that he can
play tennis a bit, but beyond that,
Billy Martin is the most
misunderstood character since Dr.
Pepper.
Two-Fisted Shot
The confusion began as far
back as 11 years ago, when
Martin first started whacking at

the fuzz ball. As a seven-year-old,
he was so weak he had to use
two hands to hit a backhand, but
he immediately took to the game.
Cajoled by his parents, Martin
began to eschew the escapades of
his peers and plunged head-first
into tennis.
"But I became sort of an
outcast," Martin recalls. "It
seemed like I was always
practicing tennis instead of
goofing around with the guys. It's
hard to make any real good
friends that way, and I must

admit, that bothered me some."
At the age of 10, Martin says,
he really "got serious" about
tennis, practicing "7-8 hours a
day." Maintaining his dedication,
as well as his two-fisted backhand,
he quickly moved up in the
juniors rankings.
"My parents convinced me that
devoting myself to tennis would
be better for me in the long run,"
Martin says. "They've been my
moral supporters all the way.
Different Desires
"But it irritated me that people
looked down on me for doing

what I wanted to do," he says."I
didn't consider myself any better
or worse than them. It's just that
what I wanted to do with my life
was different."
Last year as the No. 1 junior
player in the United States,
Martin walked away with the
Junior singles crowns at
Wimbledon and Forest Hills. He
had developed into the most
sought-after tennis player in the
nation, and he opted to attend
UCLA where he could continue to
work with his coach, Glenn
Bassett.
Playing under the shadow of
ex-Bruins such as Connors (1971
NCAA champ), Arthur Ashe
(1965 NCAA champ), Charles
Pasarcll and Jeff Borowiak (1970
NCAA champ), Martin has
responded remarkably well this
year.
Successful Season
He decisively beat out
teammate Brian Teacher, last
year's top seeded player in the
NCAA's, for the right to play top
singles for UCLA, and he has lost
only one match all year, that to
San Jose State's Hank Pfister.

The confusion began as far
back as 11 years ago, when
Martin first started whacking at

the fuzz ball. As a seven-year-old,
he was so weak he had to use
two hands to hit a backhand, but
he immediately took to the game.
Cajoled by his parents, Martin
began to eschew the escapades of
his peers and plunged head-first
into tennis.
"But I became sort of an
outcast," Martin recalls. "It
seemed like I was always
practicing tennis instead of
goofing around with the guys. It's
hard to make any real good
friends that way, and I must

admit, that bothered me some."
At the age of 10, Martin says,
he really "got serious" about
tennis, practicing "7-8 hours a
day." Maintaining his dedication,
as well as his two-fisted backhand,
he quickly moved up in the
juniors rankings.
"My parents convinced me that
devoting myself to tennis would
be better for me in the long run,"
Martin says. "They've been my
moral supporters all the way.
Different Desires
"But it irritated me that people
looked down on me for doing

what I wanted to do," he says."I
didn't consider myself any better
or worse than them. It's just that
what I wanted to do with my life
was different."
Last year as the No. 1 junior
player in the United States,
Martin walked away with the
Junior singles crowns at
Wimbledon and Forest Hills. He
had developed into the most
sought-after tennis player in the
nation, and he opted to attend
UCLA where he could continue to
work with his coach, Glenn
Bassett.
Playing under the shadow of
ex-Bruins such as Connors (1971
NCAA champ), Arthur Ashe
(1965 NCAA champ), Charles
Pasarcll and Jeff Borowiak (1970
NCAA champ), Martin has
responded remarkably well this
year.
Successful Season
He decisively beat out
teammate Brian Teacher, last
year's top seeded player in the
NCAA's, for the right to play top
singles for UCLA, and he has lost
only one match all year, that to
San Jose State's Hank Pfister.
But when people compare
Martin to Jimmy Connors, it is
usually more than just a reference
to his tennis prowess.
Martin's on-court behavior
sometimes alienates crowds, and
has causcd fans to draw parallels
with Connors, the noted "Badboy
of Tennis."
Martin thinks such
comparisons are unfair.
"Some of the things Jimmy
docs I really don't agree with,"
Martin declares. "Some of them
arc amazing. Almost indecent. I
don't think I've ever done
anything Ike that. I'll stand up for
what I think is right on a line call
and I like to talk to mvself on the

Superfrosh Billy Martin: two different personalities, on and off the court
court, but I never try to bother an
opponent and I don't even talk to
the crowd."
But Martin realizes that fans
will always have their prejudices.
"As long as you're in the
limelight, people will make
judgments without knowing
anything. Maybe if they got to
know me they'd change their
opinion, but I can't do anything
about that. I can't worry about
what the papers or other people
say, because once I do, I lose my
concentration and it hurts my
game,"
jimmy Connors was quoted
recently in a national publication
as saying he went to UCLA just to
win the NCAA singles title. After
watching Martin this season, some
have suggested he is following a
similar course.
"First of all," Martin replies, "I
doubt that jimmy made that
statement. And as for myself, I
found out a lot of players from
other schools think I pay people
to go to my classes and that I'm
always on the courts.
"Well, that's a bunch of
baloney! There's no way you can
do that at a school like UCLA.
You have to take care of your
school work here."
Martin, says he "really enjoys
college," and hopes to finish
school someday. He says he hasn't
yet made up his mind about
turning pro after this year, but
when he does, the choice won't
have anything to do with

academics.
"My decision will be based on
what's best for my tennis game,"
he says. "Right now, turning pro
would probably hurt me. I don't
think I'm ready yet to compete
with the top players week in and
week out. But after the NCAA's,
I'll see how my game is. If I think
it's good enough to do well in the
pros. I'll give up school. If not, I'll
stay another year.
"You know,"he continues, "the
pro circuit is not really such a
glamorous thing. There's a lot of
money to be made, but it can get
awful lonely and tiring being
away, staying in hotel rooms
12-16 weeks at a time, and with
no one my age around. I have to
remember, once I turn pro, there's
no turning back."
Despite his reservations, there
is no doubt that Billy Martin is
shooting to be the best tennis
player in the world, and with his
tremendous competitiveness, he's
got a shot at it.
"I think I'm at least 3 or 4 years
away," he says. "I've got a lot of
work ahead of me, but I'm going
to work as hard as I can."
For 11 years, Billy Martin's
life has revolved around tennis. He
says if it weren't for the sport
he'd "probably go crazy." He's
had to make tremendous sacrifices
and at times it's been tough, but
when someone mentions the glory
of being number one, or even
$500,000 paychecks, a smile
slowly spreads across his youthful
countenance. It's Billy Martin's
way of saying "it was worth it."

Right now, Billy Martin is a

Connors was at the same stage of
his career.
—Glenn Bassett,
UCLA Coach
The slight, blond-haired youth
squirms in the plush leather chair
and yawns impatiently. So this is
the next jimmy Connors?
Staring into Billy Martin's
boyish face and listening to his
squeaky, unrefined speech, the
visitor finds it hard to believe. The
host of the richly furnished Santa
Monica apartment seems to be
just another UCLA freshman,
battling for an identity among the
Westwood mobs and trying to
decide whether to go into
economics or psychology.
But there is no denying it.
Once the mild-mannered Martin
plants his 5-foot-9, 145-pound
frame on a tennis court, he is
indeed transformed into
Superfrosh.
Young Start
At the age of 18, the whiz kid
from Palos Verdes has already
defeated Stan Smith, Tom
Gorman and several other
professionals in tournament play;
whipped Stanford's John
Whitlinger, the defending NCAA
champ, twice; and established
himself as the world's premier
amateur tennis player.
Heading into this weekend's
league championship, Martin has
enjoyed a "perfect season" as the
No. 1 player on the nation's No. 1
college team. In addition to his
wins over Whit, Martin has scored
notable decisions over Stanford's
Jim Delancy and USC's Butch
Walts, two other NCAA
contenders, and has led his Bruins
to an undefeated season.
In the process, Martin has

amassed a myriad of reputations
that run the gamut from "a cocky
prima donna" to "the
temperamental crybaby" to "the
straight-laced, no-nonsense" athlete.
It seems no one knows quite
what to make of this new kid on
the block. It's obvious that he can
play tennis a bit, but beyond that,
Billy Martin is the most
misunderstood character since Dr.
Pepper.
Two-Fisted Shot
The confusion began as far
back as 11 years ago, when
Martin first started whacking at

the fuzz ball. As a seven-year-old,
he was so weak he had to use
two hands to hit a backhand, but
he immediately took to the game.
Cajoled by his parents, Martin
began to eschew the escapades of
his peers and plunged head-first
into tennis.
"But I became sort of an
outcast," Martin recalls. "It

practicing tennis instead of
goofing around with the guys. It's
