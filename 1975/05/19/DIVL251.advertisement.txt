There will not be Advance Registration in Spring Quarter for
Autumn Quarter 1975-76. Instead there will be a Class List
. Sign-Up for current students to sign class lists for those courses
requiring it. Courses will be listed on Autumn Program Cards that
will be available at the "Autumn Program Cards" window in the
lobby of the Old Union beginning May 20. Signing of Class Lists
will begin May 20 according to the schedule in the Time Schedule
(available at the Information window in the lobby of the Old
Union).
Each student should bring his or her ID to get a Program Card.
No advisors' signatures will be required on the Autumn Program
Cards and only courses that require signing class lists should be
shown. Students who do not need to sign class lists should not fill
out and turn in Autumn Program Cards. The last day to pick up
Program Cards is June 2, but Class Lists can be signed through
June 3. The cards should be turned in at the Class List windows
by June 3 and will be returned to students at Autumn Quarter
