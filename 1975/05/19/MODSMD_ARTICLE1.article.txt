# U.S. Considered B52s For Raid

VIENNA (AP) — The United States seriously
considered 852 bombing raids on Cambodia last week
in order to recapture the American merchant ship
Mayaguez and its 39-man crew, a senior American
official said yesterday.
Speaking aboard Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger's plane en route to Vienna for talks with
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, the official
said no one in the Ford administration wanted to use
the big bombers.
But he added such raids were a real possibility
once it was decided that some kind of military action
was necessary by Wednesday night to carry off the
rescue.
Preferred Course Taken
The preferred course was the one finally taken: to
land Marines on the Mayaguez and the nearby island
of Koh Tang, using air cover and support from the
aircraft carrier Coral Sea.
If the Coral Sea had not been able to reach its
necessary position by Wednesday night, the
supersonic bombers might have raided the mainland,
he said, but it arrived in the afternoon and the 852
option was dropped.
In Singapore, the captain and crew of the
Mayaguez agreed that Marines invaded the wrong
Cambodian island trying to rescue the crew of the
captured freighter.
"They hit the wrong island," said Bill Bellinger,
52, a mess attendant from Washington, D.C. "We
were 25 miles away from the island the Marines
landed on. They went where they thought we were."
Marines Under Fire
The captain, Charles Miller, said the men were on
an island his charts identified as Rong San Lem,
about 25 miles from Koh Tang. According to
Pentagon reports, about 200 Marines landed on the
beach at Koh Tang and remained under heavy
Cambodian fire for about 10 hours after the freed
Mayaguez crew reached the destroyer U.S.S. Wilson.
Meanwhile, in Washington, Defense Secretary
James Schlesinger sharply revised upward the
Pentagon casualty figures to five dead, 16 missing and
70 to 80 wounded. However, Miller said seven dead
Marines were already "on ice" when he boarded the
Wilson, apparently victims of a helicopter crash.
Speculation about the Marines' landing point came
during a shipboard post mortem while 20 new crew
members flown from the United States signed aboard
the vessel. Twenty-one of the 39 men who were held
captive will leave for home, said Miller.
The United States expressed regret Monday to
Thailand for using Thai bases as a take-off point for
the armed rescue of the freighter Mayaguez. Thai
Foreign Minister Chatichai Choonhavan told newsmen
he considered the letter a formal apology.

CAMPUS RALLY-Pacific Studies Center Director Lenny Siegel said Friday that one reason for the U.S.'s recent
assault on Cambodia was to prove to allies that the U.S. can still respond to crises with military strength. Siegel
criticized the U.S. action at a rally of 150 people in White Plaza.
