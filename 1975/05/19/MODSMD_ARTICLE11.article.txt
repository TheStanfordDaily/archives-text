# Dear John: About Your Column....
## 
### John Freed 
This is the last of my bi-weekly tirades
this year (no applause, please). I have
discovered that readers of this column are
an active group — perhaps they feel safe
commenting about someone who looks like
he's asleep.
In any event, I devote this week's
column to letters and calls from readers.

"The Stanford Department of Public
Safety owes its present 'peace officer
status' of existence to an opinion rendered
by the California attorney general.
Interestingly enough, this opinion pertains
only to Stanford and the Santa Clara
County Sheriff through a 'memorandum of
understanding.'
The University of Southern California
attempted to establish its own police force
with 'peace officer status' and was denied
authority.
The enclosed information could possibly
cause reverberations throughout Stanford,
(JSC and all other private universities in the
state. Due to the very sensitive nature of
this information, you can readily believe
that I wouldn't dare to sign my name."-THE
FERRET, Palo Alto.
COMMENT: This reader provided a
wealth of information on the legal authority
of our campus police. Regarding the right of
campus cops, say, to issue parking tickets,
an analysis provided by the attorney
general's office noted:
"The sole restriction under state law is
that a conflict of interest may not
exist...."
This crucial point was overlooked in
Peter Carpenter's parking report, which
recommended parking fines of $10, much
of which would go toward salaries of the
ticketers. This would have intensified the
already existing conflicts of interest.

"Please have your art layout man paint
out the white in the background around
your chin. At first glance — which is all that
most readers give — it looks like you have a
hatchet chin." J.G., Stanford.
COMMENT: I've also been told that the
photo accompanying this column makes me
look narcoleptic. At least muggers can't
recognize me.

"Why did you write your column about
me? Your column about the screw-ups in
the bureaucracy here ("Battling Our
Bungling Bureaucracy," Daily, Feb. 18)
described my situation perfectly. I object to
your using information about me without
my permission." Anonymous caller.
COMMENT: The tribulations of "Spike"
Miller, an erstwhile Manzanitan who had
some run-ins with the Housing Office, the
ASSU Travel Service and the Registar's
Office, struck a responsive chord with many
readers.
All of Spike's problems were fictional —
but they were based on real occurrences.
Several readers agreed that such travesties
exist, but only one complained about the
column.
It seems that the person in question:
—had been put on academic probation

but hadn't been told because the Registrai
sent notices to the wrong address;
—had lost a $50 deposit with the ASSU
Travel Service because a secretary gave out
the wrong information.
The parallel wasn't complete,
unfortunately. The hapless reader was
female and hence didn't relish changing her
name to Spike.

'Your column on handguns was fucked.
Every American man who wants to own a
handgun has that right; no one can take it
away." Another anonymous caller.
COMMENT: Oh. I forgot that gun
ownership contributes to America's macho
image. Far be it for me to destroy that.

"The Stani'ord Daily is controlled by a
humorless clique of ideological
rubber-stampers. Is it so inconceivable to
have two of your distinguished editors
disagreeing I sic] on a point, or is there a
Daily policy file of which all of your
editorials must support?
I cite the editorial by John Freed, master
of mongoloid humor. I, for one, don't have
the ability to write three columns of copy
in such an entertaining style that nothing
has to be said and can be read for pleasure
(sic) [sic]. He seems aware of the Daily's
anti- Housing Office stand, but seems
reluctant to shower any new insights." J. 8.,
Stanford.
COMMENT: I'm sorry you chose to
insult mongoloids, a group which faces
serious problems without being made the
butt of cruel and unthinking jokes. I hope
my views have not been monolithic; in fact,
I have supported Larry Morton and the
Housing Office when merited. Sometimes
they mess up — and they should expect
criticism then.
