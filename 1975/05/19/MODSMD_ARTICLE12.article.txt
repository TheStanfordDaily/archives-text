# KZSU Story Errs

Many points need
clarification concerning a May 8
Daily article which
inappropriately appeared as a
headline news story.
First, let me correct the
errors in reference to people and
their respective positions. Sandy
Feldman officially takes office
as KZSU Station Manager on
June 15. I remain station
manager until that date. Gary
Sezekas is actually Gary Fazekas
who is not station manager of
KFJC, but rather KFJC chief
announcer. Done Denz is
presently KJFC station
manager. Further, Bruce Anzer
is really Bruce Enzer and is not
the chief engineer of KFJC. Ron
Teel is chief engineer.
1 have been told by the
reporter that the portion on
Enzer was edited in after she
submitted the article for
publication. 1 must therefore
assume that some of the faulty
reporting originated in the
editorial staff.
Second, it is a little ironic
that the story spoke of Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC) dislike for radio stations
confident of power increases
when the reporter opened the
article with a statement
expressing 90 percent confidence
in our proposed power increase.
To begin with, the statement
was out of context.
1 explained that we were 80
percent to 90 percent more
confident with the present
application than with previous
applications and that we had
hired professional engineering
consultants to complete our
engineering studies.
Third, I certainly said nothing
for publication in the Daily
about KFJC's head being on a
"meat sheer" if they objected to
our power increase proposal.
Both KFJC and KZSU are
applying for higher power
simultaneously. The mutual
application for power increases
requires both parties to mutually
waive signal interference.
If either station were to
object to the other's
interference, then neither
station's application would be
approved. We have found it very
easy to work with Teel, KFJC
chief engineer, on the higher
power applications.
Finally, editors at the Daily
have informally apologized to
KZSU for printing the poorly
written article, especially as a
headline story. The question is,
"Why didn't they discover that
before publishing it?"
(Michael Winder, is KZSU station
manager.)
