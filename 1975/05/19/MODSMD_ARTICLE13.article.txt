# Letters--Demonstration, Graduation

Editor:
Just to clear up any possible
misunderstanding: The article on
last week's demonstration that
appeared under my by-line in
the May 14 San Francisco
Chronicle was not written by
me. As campus stringer for the
Chron, I merely phoned in basic
information on the activities; the
story was completely written
and fashioned by a rewriteman
in San Francisco. I can take no
responsibility for the finished
product.

Hollow Ceremony
Editor:
All seniors face graduation
weekend with various
expectations. I hope some agree
with me that it has become a
hollow and disappointing end to
four years of learning and
change.
The latest slight by the
University is the decision to
keep all graduates from the
School of Humanities and
Sciences in Frost Amphitheatre.
The school will no longer be
broken down by department or
combination of smaller
departments because of the cost
in setting up chairs around
campus.
Receiving our diplomas in
smaller groups was a time for
seeing students who were not
close friends but those in smaller
required classes who are
following similar career areas. It
was a time when you could see
professors who actually know
you, a time when your parents
could meet those people who
taught and helped you, not the
ones who sign the letter heads
and bills.
For many seniors this
ceremony was the only
meaningful connection between
four years of study and
graduation. The humanities and
sciences have only two or three
departments with more than 300
declared majors. For some
seniors, their departments are a
familiar, well-traveled piece of a
scattered university life.
Graduation is as much a time
for our parents as it is for us.
After four years and a lot of
bucks they deserve to* see more
of our actual involvement here
than a mass gathering at Frost.
I am asking only two
questions. Where are our senior
class officers when these
decisions are made? Do the

individual departments have so
little interest in the students
who join them they are willing
to pass them through unnoticed
at the end?

Cruel Headline
Editor:
May I suggest that we need a
cure for headline writers?
Perhaps each should keep a small
notice on the wall: "Are you
using the word 'cure*? Are you
sure that's what you mean?"
It was embarrassing to read
the headline of the Daily's story
about our hemophilia research
on May 12. Although much
progress has been made in
therapy for this disease, even for
those doubly unfortunate
patients who develop the
inhibitor antibody, none of us
bandies about the word "cure,"
and we feel it is both cruel and
misleading to do so since
patients may read or hear such
statements.
Kathy Jackson did a good job
on the story; only the headline
created a headache.

Editor:
The May 14 Daily article
about the May 13 demonstration
gives an unclear picture of the
role of the ASSU Council of
Presidents in the day's events.
It is true that we escorted
some trustees to the building.
It is true that we took no part
in planning the demonstration.
These two statements
standing alone imply that we did
not support the demonstration
or agree with the sentiments of
the demonstrators on the issues
involved.
This is not true.
We were escorting some

trustees back from lunch in
student residences, an
experience which we think was
valuable to both students and
trustees. We read a statement
before the Board's Academic
Affairs Committee, of which all
trustees are members. The
statement read as follows:
"We are opposed to the Iran
contract, as it represents an
invasion into the lives of an
unsuspecting population which
has not given its consent to
being the subjects of such an
experiment.
"We are opposed to the new
configurations in minority
financial aid programs, as they
represent a retrenchment from

Stanford's commitments to
minority populations.
"We are particularly opposed
to these two items as they
represent decisions made
without or against, student
opinion. It is our belief that
students are not just consumers;
they are an integral part of the
University."
The statement was
well-received by the Board and,
we hope, may have had some
impact — if not on these issues,
at least in the longer run.

Hollow Ceremony
Editor:
All seniors face graduation
weekend with various
expectations. I hope some agree
with me that it has become a
hollow and disappointing end to
four years of learning and
change.
The latest slight by the
University is the decision to
keep all graduates from the
School of Humanities and
Sciences in Frost Amphitheatre.
The school will no longer be
broken down by department or
combination of smaller
departments because of the cost
in setting up chairs around
campus.
Receiving our diplomas in
smaller groups was a time for
seeing students who were not
close friends but those in smaller
required classes who are
following similar career areas. It
was a time when you could see
professors who actually know
you, a time when your parents
could meet those people who
taught and helped you, not the
ones who sign the letter heads
and bills.
For many seniors this
ceremony was the only
meaningful connection between
four years of study and
graduation. The humanities and
sciences have only two or three
departments with more than 300
declared majors. For some
seniors, their departments are a
familiar, well-traveled piece of a
scattered university life.
Graduation is as much a time
for our parents as it is for us.
After four years and a lot of
bucks they deserve to* see more
of our actual involvement here
than a mass gathering at Frost.
I am asking only two
questions. Where are our senior
class officers when these
decisions are made? Do the

individual departments have so
little interest in the students
who join them they are willing
to pass them through unnoticed
at the end?

Cruel Headline

May I suggest that we need a
cure for headline writers?
Perhaps each should keep a small
notice on the wall: "Are you
using the word 'cure*? Are you
sure that's what you mean?"
It was embarrassing to read
the headline of the Daily's story
about our hemophilia research
on May 12. Although much
progress has been made in
therapy for this disease, even for
those doubly unfortunate
patients who develop the
inhibitor antibody, none of us
bandies about the word "cure,"
and we feel it is both cruel and
misleading to do so since
patients may read or hear such
statements.
Kathy Jackson did a good job

The May 14 Daily article
about the May 13 demonstration
gives an unclear picture of the
role of the ASSU Council of
Presidents in the day's events.
It is true that we escorted
some trustees to the building.
It is true that we took no part
in planning the demonstration.
These two statements
standing alone imply that we did
not support the demonstration
or agree with the sentiments of
the demonstrators on the issues
involved.
This is not true.
We were escorting some

trustees back from lunch in
student residences, an
experience which we think was
valuable to both students and
trustees. We read a statement
before the Board's Academic
Affairs Committee, of which all
trustees are members. The
statement read as follows:
"We are opposed to the Iran
contract, as it represents an
invasion into the lives of an
unsuspecting population which
has not given its consent to
being the subjects of such an
experiment.
"We are opposed to the new
configurations in minority
financial aid programs, as they
represent a retrenchment from

Stanford's commitments to
minority populations.
"We are particularly opposed

experience which we think was
valuable to both students and
trustees. We read a statement
before the Board's Academic
Affairs Committee, of which all
trustees are members. The
statement read as follows:
"We are opposed to the Iran
contract, as it represents an
invasion into the lives of an
unsuspecting population which
has not given its consent to
being the subjects of such an
experiment.
"We are opposed to the new
configurations in minority
financial aid programs, as they
represent a retrenchment from

Stanford's commitments to
minority populations.
"We are particularly opposed
to these two items as they
represent decisions made
without or against, student
opinion. It is our belief that
students are not just consumers;
they are an integral part of the
University."
The statement was
well-received by the Board and,
we hope, may have had some
impact — if not on these issues,
at least in the longer run.
