## Northwest Indians Call Him—- Skookum Chief 
### 
Archie Blacksmith, a member of the Sioux
nation, journeyed from his home in the Black
Hills near Rosebud, South Dakota, to attend the
annual powwow on Stanford grounds last
weekend.
The Northwest Indians might have called him
"skookum chief." In their dialect, skookum is a
word for strength.
The strength of Native American culture and
traditions was revealed in the variety of events
and participants in the powwow.
Members of 45 tribes, primarily from
California but including representatives from
Nevada, Oregon and Arizona, gathered on the
field east of the football stadium. The powwow,
organized by the Stanford American Indian

Organization and the Native American Cultural
Center featured demonstrations of traditional
Indian dancing and a bazaar of Indian food,
jewelry, pottery, ornaments, rugs, and sketches
and drawings on Indian themes.
About 250 people registered as powwow
participants. Some competed in dance and craft
contests for a share of the $1300 competition
purse. Casual visitors came to sample Indian tacos
— similar to the Mexican version but made with
refried bread instead of tortillas. While munching,

they admired hand-beaded belts, purses and hair
ornaments and displays of turquoise rings and
bracelets.
One booth offered Indian cards and bumper
stickers reading "Indians discovered America"
and "Custer had it coming."
The powwow began Friday evening with a
general welcoming program, dancing, and the
setting up of camps andteepees.lt ended Sunday
afternoon after the senior mens dancing
competition and a raffle drawing.
The co-sponsoring groups are Stanford-based
organizations with a combined membership of
about 75 undergraduate and graduate students.
The Stanford American Indian Association
coordinates intramural sports and other social

events. The Stanford American Indian
Organization works for cultural innovations on
campus, such as new classes for or about Native
Americans.
The annual powwow is a "social reunion" for
the participants," said Senior Randy Peters,
chairman of the organizing committee. "It is not
meant to carry religious or political overtones.
Everyone comes here each year to enjoy
themselves. Whatever money we make from
donations is used towards next year's powwow."
