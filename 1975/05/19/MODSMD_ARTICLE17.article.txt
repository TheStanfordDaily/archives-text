# Women Edge Out Davis To Take NCIAC Tourney
## 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
Stanford edged UC-l)avis
1-1-13 to win the Northern
California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference (NCIAC)
playoffs Saturday at
UC-Berkeley.
Stanford's win proved to be
more difficult than Coach
Curley Neai had anticipated.
Neal's optimism was based on
the Cards' performance last
month when they defeated
Fresno State 6-0 and Davis 5-0
in dual meets and then swept the
Pac-8 finals at UCLA, outscoring
USC, Ca! and UCLA to win 26
to 27 matches.
Saturday, Stanford met Davis
in Division One of the round
robin tournament and scored a
decisive 4-2 win.
However, Davis's performance in
its matches against Fresno and
Cal made for a neck-and-neck
race with the Cards for the best
overall tournament team score.
Stanford fielded a tough team
for the big event. Sophomore
Marcy O'Keefe played number
one singles while freshman Lele

Forood played at number two.
Pat Delaney and Jane Hayes
alternated at the number three
spot. Hayes playing against
Fresno and Cal, and Delaney
against Davis.
Neal is anticipating the Cards'
final competition. Six players
will travel to Kalamazoo,
Michigan for the national finals,
June 16-21.
Neal believes that her team
will place among the top five.
"The toughest competition
will be Trinity and Arizona,"
Neal said.
