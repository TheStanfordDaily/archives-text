### MARK FUNK 
PULLMAN. WASH—Dis
tance runner Tony Sandoval
picked up over half of Stanford's
points in this weekend's Pacific
Eight Track and Field
Championships held in Pullman
Wash., and earned himself a trip
to the NCAA tournament in the
process.
Sandoval turned in a lifetime
best of 28:43.1 in the six-mile
and easily outdistanced his
nearest rivals — with one
exception — to finish in second
place. Washington State's John
Ngeno pleased a home town
crowd winning the event in
28:38.0.
Sandoval's eight points
helped make up for the loss of
Stanford's intermediate hurdler
Matt Hogsett. Hogsett,
defending Pac-8 champion at his
specialty, failed to place in this
year's meet.
In the race for the Pac-8 team
title, USC took a surprisingly
easy victory from cross-town
rival UCLA. Paced by Olympic
gold medalist Randy Williams,
the Trojans amassed 152 points
for the win. Williams took a first
in the long jump — the fourth
consecutive time he has done so

and a second place in the 100
yard dash behind teammate
James Gilkes. Both were timed
in 9.4.
Gilkes also won the 220.
James Lofton picked up
another point for Stanford with
a sixth place in the long jump.
