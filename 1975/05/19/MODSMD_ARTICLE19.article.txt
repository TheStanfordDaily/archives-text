# Martin, Bruins Take Pac-8 Tennis Crown From Cards
## 
### RON BECK 
Take away Nick Saviano and
Pat DuPre from Stanford's
tennis team, and what have vou
got?
The ex-Pac-8 champions.
UCLA's netters took
advantage of an injury-weakened
Cardinal squad Saturday to take
the 1975 Pac-8 championships
and the league title. But despite
the 6-3 final score, Stanford
wasn't far from upsetting the
favored Bruins.
Saviano and DuPre, the Cards
third and fourth singles players,
were held out of the
competition due to injuries.
Their absence necessitated the
addition of Mark Mitchell and
Craig Johnson into the top six
spots. Mitchell was undefeated
during the tourney, and Johnson
was 2-1, the loss coming against
the Bruins.
Besides having to bring in
Mitchell and Johnson, the vacant
slots at third and fourth singles
forced C.ene Mayer and Bill
Maze to each play two positions
higher than they are accustomed
to.
Fairly Successful
Although both players were
successful (Maze went
undefeated and Mayer only lost
his match to UCLA), two UCLA
points in the last four singles
spots might have gone to
Stanford.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
considered the second and third
doubles matches as the pivotal
points. Both matches went the
distance of three sets, and both
were won by the Bruins.
Mayer teamed up with DuPre,
a surprising combination
considering that Gould didn't
feel DuPre was capable of

playing in the singles, and the
pair won the first set from
UCLA's Ferdi Taygan and
Tommy Kreiss.
Kreiss and Taygan came back
in the next two sets on a series
of Stanford mis-hits to win the
match.
Ending Match
Maze and Mitchell lost the
first set of their match, came
back to win the second, but lost
service twice in the final set to
lose the match and end the
afternoon's play.
Coming into the evening, the
Cards were down 4-2 and looked
hopelessly out of contention.
But suddenly John Whitlinger
picked up a point for Stanford
by demolishing Brian Teacher in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, and the
6500 Maples fans started to
come alive.
With the overall score now at
4-3 UCLA, Billy Martin, the
nation's top-ranked amateur,
was in a position to sew up the
match for the Bruins or throw
the whole thing into a tie.
Martin wasn't serving
particularly well all night, and in
the first set, Delaney made good
use of Martin's weaker second
serve. The Stanford senior broke
Martin's service in the fourth
game and went on to win the
first set, 6-3.
'Cool Down'
"1 was really worried | after
the first set]," explained Martin
afterwards. "Delaney was
playing really well and 1 said to
myself 'Jesus, I've got to cool
down.' "
Martin did, and finished up
the match playing flawless
tennis. Delaney was continually
on the defensive because of
Martin's perfectly placed

approach shots.
Delaney's big serve and volley
game was ineffective against
Martin's array of perfectly aimed
shots, resulting in a 3-6,6-1, 6-3
UCLA victory.
The final doubles match was
meaningless in terms of the
Pac-8 results, but both teams,
conscious of the NCAA doubles
seedings that rely on match
scores, had to play all out.
Big Beginning
Delaney and Whitlinger
started to roll over UCLA,
winning the first set 6-1. All of a
sudden, Martin and Teacher
awakened from their lethargy
and played great tennis to take
the next two sets and extend the
final score to 6-3.
"I was exhausted and stiff,"
said Martin, explaining his
first-set performance. "I got a
second wind and Brian and I
started to really play."
Gould, more than a little
discouraged after the day's
events, credited UCLA Coach
Glenn Bassett and the whole
Bruin squad. "We played well,"
said Gould, "but they played
better."
Friday night, Stanford
performed brilliantly against
USC. During the afternoon, the
Cards won every singles match
and one of the two doubles

matches to clinch the semifinal
victory at 6-1. In Maples Friday
evening, USC's Butch Walts put
on another one of his Maples'
serving exhibitions as he aced his
way by Delaney in the top
singles match, 6-4, 6-4.
Whitlinger and Delaney
topped Walts and Bruce Manson
in the doubles match by a 6-0,
7-6 score to end the match at
7-2.
