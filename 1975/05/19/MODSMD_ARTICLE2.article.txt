# Bombing, Assault Spark Protest
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
Approximately 150 Stanford students and
members of the Palo Alto community protested the
United States' recent involvement in Cambodia
Friday at a rally in White Plaza.
The rally was also sponsored by the Alliance for
Radical Change in order to publicize details behind
the Mayaguez incident.
"I am here to tell you good news and bad news,"
Religious Studies Prof. Robert McAfee Brown said.

"The good news is that we had world peace for
12 days. The bad news is that we had world peace
for only 12 days." Brown, who has opposed U.S.
involvement in Indochina for over 10 years, urged the
crowd to channel its protest into telephone calls and
letters to legislators.
It is crucial to make the government realize that it
cannot act with impunity in the future," he said of
the U.S. bombing of three Cambodian patrol boats,
the assault of Koh Tang Island and the raids on the
Cambodian mainland.
He directed them to a card table supplied with
writing paper, stamps, envelopes, addresses of
congressmen, and a telegram, signed by 120 students,
addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield.
The message protested "the flagrant military
overreaction and loss of life in the Mayaguez
incident."

Citing a newspaper article from the San Francisco
Chronicle which stated that Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger had ordered the bombing even if it
threatened the lives of the Mayaguez crew members,
Brown pointed out that the intention of the attack
was "not to save lives but to risk them as pawns in a
show of strength at whatever cost to the rest of the
world."
Pacific Studies Center Director Lenny Siegel
agreed with Brown that the reason for the incident
had not been solely to reclaim the Mayaguez.
He said that he thought the assault had been
waged to warn other countries not to seize American
ships and to prove to such countries as South Korea
and the Philippines that the U.S. can still respond to
crises with military strength.
Later in the rally, the microphone was opened to
the crowd. One of the approximately 10 speakers
called the Mayaguez seizure an act of piracy and an
infringement upon the U.S.'s right to international
trade.
He urged members of the crowd to put themselves
'in the place of the Mayaguez crew. "How would you
like to sit in a communist torture chamber for 11
months?" he asked.

threatened the lives of the Mayaguez crew members,
Brown pointed out that the intention of the attack
was "not to save lives but to risk them as pawns in a
show of strength at whatever cost to the rest of the
world."
Pacific Studies Center Director Lenny Siegel
agreed with Brown that the reason for the incident
had not been solely to reclaim the Mayaguez.
He said that he thought the assault had been
waged to warn other countries not to seize American
ships and to prove to such countries as South Korea
and the Philippines that the U.S. can still respond to
crises with military strength.
Later in the rally, the microphone was opened to
the crowd. One of the approximately 10 speakers
called the Mayaguez seizure an act of piracy and an
infringement upon the U.S.'s right to international
trade.
He urged members of the crowd to put themselves
'in the place of the Mayaguez crew. "How would you
like to sit in a communist torture chamber for 11
months?" he asked.
