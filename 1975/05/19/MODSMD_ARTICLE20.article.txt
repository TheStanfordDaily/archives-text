Foreigners 'Safe' In Laos
ViLNi'iANE, Laos—A dozen Americans and
seven other foreigners detained in the southern
Laotian town of Savannakhet sent two radio
messages to the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane
yesterday, assuring officials that they are safe and
well, an embassy spokesman said.
The students holding the Americans have
refused to let them leave until the Vientiane
coalition government, dominated by the
communist-led Pathet Lao, agrees to a series of
demands that include: neutralization of three
Mekong River provinces, complete disbanding of
U.S. agencies and restrictions on the number of
Americans in Laos, who now number 1200.
Officials of the joint committee of the Pathet
Lao, rightists and neutralists set up to implement
the 1973 cease-fire agreements are in Savannakhet
trying to negotiate release of the Americans.
Across the border, Thai students bumed effigies
of Uncle Sam and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger in front of the U.S. Embassy yesterday
after an all-night vigil to back demands that
Washington apologize for launching the rescue of
the Mayaguez from Thailand.
Airlift Left Americans Behind
SAIGON—The abrupt U.S. evacuation from
Saigon left behind about two dozen Americans,
150 South Koreans and 200 Filipinos who wanted
to flee on the airlift, according to figures of an
international relief official.
Most arrived at the American embassy too late
to be taken out aboard U.S. Marine helicopters on
April 29 and the morning of April 30.
One Korean, Yi Sang Su, 37, had gone to the
U.S. Embassy on April 29 and waited through the
night but said he was forced to leave after the
Marines threw tear gas into the crowd.
Also trapped were a number of South Korean
Embassy personnel. The 150 Koreans are staying in
three locations in Saigon with the primary one
being the former Korean ambassador's residence.
The 200 stranded Filipinos are scattered about
Saigon, living with their Vietnamese wives or
friends.

Kissinger-Gromyko Talks Begin
VIENNA— Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
arrived yesterday for talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, and a senior U.S.
official said Washington is willing to consider
relaxing a key demand for a new treaty limiting
nuclear arms.
Kissinger said that in his two-day conference
with Gromyko he would "make every effort to
improve the prospect of peace, while still remaining
determined to protect the American national
interests and the interests of U.S. allies."
During the flight from Washington, newsmen
were told by a senior American official that the
U.S. side may ease its position on how to police an
agreement limiting the number of multitargeted
warheads — MIRVs — for use on offensive missiles.
Progress has been greater on the
MIRV-verification issue than is apparent, the
official added, and a new Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks treaty should be ready for the planned visit
of Soviet party leader Leonid Brezhnev to the
United States next autumn.
Ford Wants New Creed For U.S.
PHILADELPHIA—President Ford said yesterday
the United States, as it nears its 200 th birthday,
has a chance to redefine its national purposes and
write a new "declaration of interdependence,
among ourselves and with all peoples."
"On our 200 th birthday, shall we occupy
ourselves questioning our limitations — or
exploring our possibilities?" he asked in remarks
prepared for University of Pennsylvania
commencement exercises.
He said America recently has "gone through
some rough times," militarily and diplomatically.
But he said the founders of the nation, who signed
the Declaration of Independence and framed the
Constitution in Philadelphia, "survived experiences
far worse."
He told the 5000 graduates in the audience that
they are among almost one million young
Americans graduating this year who "are faced,
through no fault of their own, with economic
difficulties greater than any" since the Depression

years of the 19305.
The President spoke after receiving an honorary
doctor of laws degree from university president
Martin Meyerson.
Kent Stale Civil Trial Begins
CLEVELAND—A $20 million civil damages trial
beginning today could be the last public forum for
resolving any doubts lingering from the 1970 Kent
State University shootings.
The trial places the parents of four slain and
nine wounded students against Gov. James Rhodes
of Ohio and 50 former state officials.
The parents contend in their civil damages case
that Rhodes, former Kent State President Robert
White and other former state officials failed to take
adequate precautions to prevent injuries after
armed and untrained National Guardsmen were
ordered to campus.
A key legal point is the doctrine of sovereign
immunity: whether state officials can be immune
from prosecution and damages in civil and criminal
cases proceedings.
On April 17, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that the state's doctrine of sovereign
immunity was not absolute in the Kent State case.
Terrorism Continues In Mideast
JERUSALEM—An Arab blew himself up
yesterday while apparently attempting to throw a
hand grenade into a schoolyard in northern Israel
where about 30 students were exercising, police
said.
A small bomb also went off in the Arab sector
of Jerusalem, causing no casualties. In Lebanon,
two more Arab children died from a mortar
explosion, bringing the casualty toll to nine dead
and three wounded in the border village of
Aiteroun.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with low
clouds this morning. Lows tonight in the upper 40s
to low 50s. Highs both days in the low 70s to low
80s.

resolving any doubts lingering from the 1970 Kent
State University shootings.
The trial places the parents of four slain and
nine wounded students against Gov. James Rhodes
of Ohio and 50 former state officials.
The parents contend in their civil damages case
that Rhodes, former Kent State President Robert
White and other former state officials failed to take
adequate precautions to prevent injuries after
armed and untrained National Guardsmen were
ordered to campus.
A key legal point is the doctrine of sovereign
immunity: whether state officials can be immune
from prosecution and damages in civil and criminal
cases proceedings.
On April 17, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that the state's doctrine of sovereign
immunity was not absolute in the Kent State case.
Terrorism Continues In Mideast
JERUSALEM—An Arab blew himself up
yesterday while apparently attempting to throw a
hand grenade into a schoolyard in northern Israel
where about 30 students were exercising, police
said.
A small bomb also went off in the Arab sector
of Jerusalem, causing no casualties. In Lebanon,
two more Arab children died from a mortar
explosion, bringing the casualty toll to nine dead
and three wounded in the border village of
Aiteroun.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with low
clouds this morning. Lows tonight in the upper 40s
to low 50s. Highs both days in the low 70s to low
80s.
Foreigners 'Safe' In Laos
ViLNi'iANE, Laos—A dozen Americans and
seven other foreigners detained in the southern
Laotian town of Savannakhet sent two radio
messages to the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane
yesterday, assuring officials that they are safe and
well, an embassy spokesman said.
The students holding the Americans have
refused to let them leave until the Vientiane
coalition government, dominated by the
communist-led Pathet Lao, agrees to a series of
demands that include: neutralization of three
Mekong River provinces, complete disbanding of
U.S. agencies and restrictions on the number of
Americans in Laos, who now number 1200.
Officials of the joint committee of the Pathet
Lao, rightists and neutralists set up to implement
the 1973 cease-fire agreements are in Savannakhet
trying to negotiate release of the Americans.
Across the border, Thai students bumed effigies
of Uncle Sam and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger in front of the U.S. Embassy yesterday
after an all-night vigil to back demands that
Washington apologize for launching the rescue of
the Mayaguez from Thailand.
Airlift Left Americans Behind
SAIGON—The abrupt U.S. evacuation from
Saigon left behind about two dozen Americans,
150 South Koreans and 200 Filipinos who wanted
to flee on the airlift, according to figures of an
international relief official.
Most arrived at the American embassy too late
to be taken out aboard U.S. Marine helicopters on
April 29 and the morning of April 30.
One Korean, Yi Sang Su, 37, had gone to the
U.S. Embassy on April 29 and waited through the
night but said he was forced to leave after the
Marines threw tear gas into the crowd.
Also trapped were a number of South Korean
Embassy personnel. The 150 Koreans are staying in
three locations in Saigon with the primary one
being the former Korean ambassador's residence.
The 200 stranded Filipinos are scattered about
Saigon, living with their Vietnamese wives or
friends.

Kissinger-Gromyko Talks Begin
VIENNA— Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
arrived yesterday for talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, and a senior U.S.
official said Washington is willing to consider
relaxing a key demand for a new treaty limiting
nuclear arms.
Kissinger said that in his two-day conference
with Gromyko he would "make every effort to
improve the prospect of peace, while still remaining
determined to protect the American national
interests and the interests of U.S. allies."
During the flight from Washington, newsmen
were told by a senior American official that the
U.S. side may ease its position on how to police an
agreement limiting the number of multitargeted
warheads — MIRVs — for use on offensive missiles.
Progress has been greater on the
MIRV-verification issue than is apparent, the
official added, and a new Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks treaty should be ready for the planned visit
of Soviet party leader Leonid Brezhnev to the
United States next autumn.
Ford Wants New Creed For U.S.
PHILADELPHIA—President Ford said yesterday
the United States, as it nears its 200 th birthday,
has a chance to redefine its national purposes and
write a new "declaration of interdependence,
among ourselves and with all peoples."
"On our 200 th birthday, shall we occupy
ourselves questioning our limitations — or
exploring our possibilities?" he asked in remarks
prepared for University of Pennsylvania
commencement exercises.
He said America recently has "gone through
some rough times," militarily and diplomatically.
But he said the founders of the nation, who signed
the Declaration of Independence and framed the
Constitution in Philadelphia, "survived experiences
far worse."
He told the 5000 graduates in the audience that
they are among almost one million young
Americans graduating this year who "are faced,
through no fault of their own, with economic
difficulties greater than any" since the Depression

years of the 19305.
The President spoke after receiving an honorary
doctor of laws degree from university president
Martin Meyerson.

warheads — MIRVs — for use on offensive missiles.
Progress has been greater on the
MIRV-verification issue than is apparent, the
official added, and a new Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks treaty should be ready for the planned visit
of Soviet party leader Leonid Brezhnev to the
United States next autumn.
Ford Wants New Creed For U.S.
PHILADELPHIA—President Ford said yesterday
the United States, as it nears its 200 th birthday,
has a chance to redefine its national purposes and
write a new "declaration of interdependence,
among ourselves and with all peoples."
"On our 200 th birthday, shall we occupy
ourselves questioning our limitations — or
exploring our possibilities?" he asked in remarks
prepared for University of Pennsylvania
commencement exercises.
He said America recently has "gone through
some rough times," militarily and diplomatically.
But he said the founders of the nation, who signed
the Declaration of Independence and framed the
Constitution in Philadelphia, "survived experiences
far worse."
He told the 5000 graduates in the audience that
they are among almost one million young
Americans graduating this year who "are faced,
through no fault of their own, with economic
difficulties greater than any" since the Depression

years of the 19305.
The President spoke after receiving an honorary
doctor of laws degree from university president
Martin Meyerson.
Kent Stale Civil Trial Begins
CLEVELAND—A $20 million civil damages trial
beginning today could be the last public forum for
resolving any doubts lingering from the 1970 Kent
State University shootings.
The trial places the parents of four slain and
nine wounded students against Gov. James Rhodes
of Ohio and 50 former state officials.
The parents contend in their civil damages case
that Rhodes, former Kent State President Robert
White and other former state officials failed to take
adequate precautions to prevent injuries after
armed and untrained National Guardsmen were
ordered to campus.
A key legal point is the doctrine of sovereign
immunity: whether state officials can be immune
from prosecution and damages in civil and criminal
cases proceedings.
On April 17, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that the state's doctrine of sovereign
immunity was not absolute in the Kent State case.
Terrorism Continues In Mideast
JERUSALEM—An Arab blew himself up
yesterday while apparently attempting to throw a
hand grenade into a schoolyard in northern Israel
where about 30 students were exercising, police
said.
A small bomb also went off in the Arab sector
of Jerusalem, causing no casualties. In Lebanon,
two more Arab children died from a mortar
explosion, bringing the casualty toll to nine dead
and three wounded in the border village of
Aiteroun.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with low
clouds this morning. Lows tonight in the upper 40s
to low 50s. Highs both days in the low 70s to low
80s.
Foreigners 'Safe' In Laos
ViLNi'iANE, Laos—A dozen Americans and
seven other foreigners detained in the southern
Laotian town of Savannakhet sent two radio
messages to the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane
yesterday, assuring officials that they are safe and
well, an embassy spokesman said.
The students holding the Americans have
refused to let them leave until the Vientiane
coalition government, dominated by the
communist-led Pathet Lao, agrees to a series of
demands that include: neutralization of three
Mekong River provinces, complete disbanding of
U.S. agencies and restrictions on the number of
Americans in Laos, who now number 1200.
Officials of the joint committee of the Pathet
Lao, rightists and neutralists set up to implement
the 1973 cease-fire agreements are in Savannakhet
trying to negotiate release of the Americans.
Across the border, Thai students bumed effigies
of Uncle Sam and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger in front of the U.S. Embassy yesterday
after an all-night vigil to back demands that
Washington apologize for launching the rescue of
the Mayaguez from Thailand.
Airlift Left Americans Behind
SAIGON—The abrupt U.S. evacuation from
Saigon left behind about two dozen Americans,
150 South Koreans and 200 Filipinos who wanted
to flee on the airlift, according to figures of an
international relief official.
Most arrived at the American embassy too late
to be taken out aboard U.S. Marine helicopters on
April 29 and the morning of April 30.
One Korean, Yi Sang Su, 37, had gone to the
U.S. Embassy on April 29 and waited through the
night but said he was forced to leave after the
Marines threw tear gas into the crowd.
Also trapped were a number of South Korean
Embassy personnel. The 150 Koreans are staying in
three locations in Saigon with the primary one
being the former Korean ambassador's residence.
The 200 stranded Filipinos are scattered about
Saigon, living with their Vietnamese wives or
friends.

Kissinger-Gromyko Talks Begin
VIENNA— Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
arrived yesterday for talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, and a senior U.S.
official said Washington is willing to consider
relaxing a key demand for a new treaty limiting
nuclear arms.
Kissinger said that in his two-day conference
with Gromyko he would "make every effort to
improve the prospect of peace, while still remaining
determined to protect the American national
interests and the interests of U.S. allies."
During the flight from Washington, newsmen
were told by a senior American official that the
U.S. side may ease its position on how to police an
agreement limiting the number of multitargeted
warheads — MIRVs — for use on offensive missiles.
