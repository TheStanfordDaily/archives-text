# Minority Hiring Total Falls Below Projection
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Although the proportion of
minorities on the University staff
increased by about one percent
between autumn 1973 and autumn
1974, the 19.9 percent total fell short
of a projected level of 21 percent,
according to a summary of data from a
report from the Affirmative Action Office.
The minority total is comprised of
members from black, Asian, Spanish
surname and Native American groups.
According to the report summary,
gains were made mainly in the number
of minority clerical workers.
In non-research administrative and
professional jobs paying $12,000 a
year or more, however, the number of
minority employees leaving positions
equaled the number of new minority
appointments from summer 1973 to
December 1974.
Moreover, seven of the eight
appointments to "truly senior jobs"
paying about $20,000 a year went to
non-minority males, the summary
stated.
"The base of talent for future
promotion and leadership [in
administrative and professional jobs]
was not expanded," concluded the
summary.
The report covers about 4800 staff
members working half-time or more.
Employees at the Hospital and the
Linear Accelerator Center are not
included.
Based On Assumptions
The summary was sent to
University deans, managers and
officers to be used in affirmative
action planning for the coming year.
According to Affirmative Action
Officer Anne Miner, the 21 percent
goal was based on assumptions about
staff turnover rate and the predictions
of individual managers as to the type

of employees they would hire.
Miner attributed the failure to
reach this goal to a combination of
slightly lower hiring rates,
unrealistically high predictions by
some managers, and losses of minority
employees in some areas (although she
noted that in most areas, minority
employees generally stay on more
often than others).
According to the summary, some
172 appointments were made in the
$12,000-a-year-or-more category from
summer 1973 to December 1974.
Minority candidates received about 14
percent of the jobs during the first 12
months of the period, but 22 percent
of the jobs in the last six months, due
to improved hiring procedures.
Non-minority women filled 29

percent of the positions in the first 12
months and 33 percent in the last six
months.
New Appointments
No Native Americans were
appointed during this period. Miner
said that the applicant pool of Native
Americans is very small because they
comprise only a small proportion of
the California population.
The number of minority women in
administrative and professional jobs
increased, but the total number is
small, the summary said.
Non-minority women now make up
49 percent of the total staff, a one
percent increase. Increases occurred in
officials and managers, professional
and technician categories, but some
problems remain, the report found.
For one, about 60 percent of all
non -minority women are also
concentrated in office and clerical
jobs. Few women (minority or
non-minority) hold positions in
crafts, operatives or laborers groups;
few women hold jobs involving line
authority and policy making.
Despite the shortcomings revealed
in the staff affirmative action
summary, "I believe Stanford, when
compared to any other university, has
one of the best affirmative action
programs," commented President
Richard Lyman in a letter sent out
with the summary.
Miner agreed that the University's
affirmative action program is one of

the best, when the results are
objectively viewed, but added that
"We don't want that kind of
conclusion to lead to complacency. In
no way are we content with the
results."
Joseph Scroggs, deputy director of
personnel and employee relations,
noted that the University is not up to
the statewide average in the percentage
of minority employees, but that the
University is doing well in relation to
other employers in Mid-Peninsula area,
where there is a smaller minority
applicant pool.
In an attempt to deal with this
problem, Ruth Moghadam of the
campus personnel office recently has
been appointed recruitment
coordinator with responsibility for
recruiting professional candidates.

minorities on the University staff

appointed during this period. Miner
said that the applicant pool of Native
Americans is very small because they
comprise only a small proportion of
the California population.
The number of minority women in
administrative and professional jobs
increased, but the total number is
small, the summary said.
Non-minority women now make up
49 percent of the total staff, a one
percent increase. Increases occurred in
officials and managers, professional
and technician categories, but some
problems remain, the report found.
For one, about 60 percent of all
non -minority women are also
concentrated in office and clerical
jobs. Few women (minority or
non-minority) hold positions in
crafts, operatives or laborers groups;
few women hold jobs involving line
authority and policy making.
Despite the shortcomings revealed
in the staff affirmative action
summary, "I believe Stanford, when
compared to any other university, has
one of the best affirmative action
programs," commented President
Richard Lyman in a letter sent out
with the summary.
Miner agreed that the University's
affirmative action program is one of

the best, when the results are
objectively viewed, but added that
"We don't want that kind of
conclusion to lead to complacency. In
no way are we content with the
results."
Joseph Scroggs, deputy director of
personnel and employee relations,
noted that the University is not up to
the statewide average in the percentage
of minority employees, but that the
University is doing well in relation to
other employers in Mid-Peninsula area,
where there is a smaller minority
applicant pool.
In an attempt to deal with this
problem, Ruth Moghadam of the
campus personnel office recently has
been appointed recruitment
coordinator with responsibility for
recruiting professional candidates.
Although the proportion of
minorities on the University staff
increased by about one percent
between autumn 1973 and autumn
1974, the 19.9 percent total fell short
of a projected level of 21 percent,
according to a summary of data from a
report from the Affirmative Action Office.
The minority total is comprised of
members from black, Asian, Spanish
surname and Native American groups.
According to the report summary,
gains were made mainly in the number
of minority clerical workers.
In non-research administrative and
professional jobs paying $12,000 a
year or more, however, the number of
minority employees leaving positions
equaled the number of new minority
appointments from summer 1973 to
December 1974.
Moreover, seven of the eight
appointments to "truly senior jobs"
paying about $20,000 a year went to
non-minority males, the summary
stated.
"The base of talent for future
promotion and leadership [in
administrative and professional jobs]
was not expanded," concluded the
summary.
The report covers about 4800 staff
members working half-time or more.
Employees at the Hospital and the
Linear Accelerator Center are not
included.
Based On Assumptions
The summary was sent to
University deans, managers and
officers to be used in affirmative
action planning for the coming year.
According to Affirmative Action
Officer Anne Miner, the 21 percent
goal was based on assumptions about
staff turnover rate and the predictions
of individual managers as to the type

of employees they would hire.
Miner attributed the failure to
reach this goal to a combination of
slightly lower hiring rates,
unrealistically high predictions by
some managers, and losses of minority
employees in some areas (although she
noted that in most areas, minority
employees generally stay on more
often than others).
According to the summary, some
172 appointments were made in the
$12,000-a-year-or-more category from
summer 1973 to December 1974.
Minority candidates received about 14
percent of the jobs during the first 12
months of the period, but 22 percent
of the jobs in the last six months, due
to improved hiring procedures.
Non-minority women filled 29

percent of the positions in the first 12
months and 33 percent in the last six
months.

appointed during this period. Miner
