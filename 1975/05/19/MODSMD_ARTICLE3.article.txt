# Minority Hiring Total Falls Below Projection
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Although the proportion of
minorities on the University staff
increased by about one percent
between autumn 1973 and autumn
1974, the 19.9 percent total fell short
of a projected level of 21 percent,
according to a summary of data from a
report from the Affirmative Action Office.
The minority total is comprised of
members from black, Asian, Spanish
surname and Native American groups.
According to the report summary,
gains were made mainly in the number
of minority clerical workers.
In non-research administrative and
professional jobs paying $12,000 a
year or more, however, the number of
minority employees leaving positions
equaled the number of new minority
appointments from summer 1973 to
December 1974.
Moreover, seven of the eight
appointments to "truly senior jobs"
paying about $20,000 a year went to
non-minority males, the summary
stated.
"The base of talent for future
promotion and leadership [in
administrative and professional jobs]
was not expanded," concluded the
summary.
The report covers about 4800 staff
members working half-time or more.
Employees at the Hospital and the
Linear Accelerator Center are not
included.
Based On Assumptions
The summary was sent to
University deans, managers and
officers to be used in affirmative
action planning for the coming year.
According to Affirmative Action
Officer Anne Miner, the 21 percent
goal was based on assumptions about
staff turnover rate and the predictions
of individual managers as to the type

of employees they would hire.
Miner attributed the failure to
reach this goal to a combination of
slightly lower hiring rates,
unrealistically high predictions by
some managers, and losses of minority
employees in some areas (although she
noted that in most areas, minority
employees generally stay on more
often than others).
According to the summary, some
172 appointments were made in the
$12,000-a-year-or-more category from
summer 1973 to December 1974.
Minority candidates received about 14
percent of the jobs during the first 12
months of the period, but 22 percent
of the jobs in the last six months, due
to improved hiring procedures.
Non-minority women filled 29

percent of the positions in the first 12
months and 33 percent in the last six
months.
New Appointments
No Native Americans were
appointed during this period. Miner
said that the applicant pool of Native
Americans is very small because they
comprise only a small proportion of
the California population.
The number of minority women in
administrative and professional jobs
increased, but the total number is
small, the summary said.
Non-minority women now make up
49 percent of the total staff, a one
percent increase. Increases occurred in
officials and managers, professional
and technician categories, but some
