# Friedmann Selected For 'Course Guide'
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Junior Lance Friedmann has been
selected project manager for next
year's Course Guide.
Chosen over one other applicant for
the position, Friedmann was selected
on the basis of his capability and
willingness to do the job, said ASSU
Sen. Bill Hoke.
As project manager, Friedmann will
be responsible for the day-to-day
operation of the Guide, said Hoke.
The ASSU Course Guide Policy
Board, to be selected next autumn,
will review policy issues and draw up
long-range plans.
"He will have sufficient leeway to
do his job," said Hoke. The situation is
similar to that of "a board of directors
which delegates a lot of authority to
the man it puts in the chief spot."
'Forward Looking'
The Course Guide, whose name was
changed from that of Course Review
to provide a forward-looking
approach, will be published three
times next year. It will monitor 250 to
350 courses each quarter, covering
most undergraduate courses of more
than 15 students, Friedmann said.

"This is considerably more than
they have covered in the past," he
noted.
As another improvement,
Friedmann plans to simplify the
method used to report quantitative
data.
"One of the big problems of the
past course reviews was that the
quantitative data were just a string of
numbers," he said. "They need to be
more interpretable."
Two Major Tasks
Although Friedmann will use the
present questionnaires for this
quarter's evaluations, he said he is
conducting a survey of questionnaires
used at 35 other universities to
determine what improvements could
be made.
Right now, Friedmann sees two
major tasks ahead â€” obtaining
adequate funding and recruiting
personnel.
He estimates that the cost of
producing next year's Guide will be
$10,790. The Guide presently is
$1000 in debt, said Friedmann.
As a start, the Publications Board
recently awarded the Course Guide
$1000. And "they have indicated that
we can come back for more" when an
additional disbursement of $10,000 is
made next autumn, Friedmann noted.
Other sources of funding will be the
ASSU Senate and University
departments, said Friedmann.
Friedmann is unsure how much
money he can lure from University
departments.
Besides these sources, Friedmann
plans to sell advertising space in the
Guide, which he expects could net
substantial profits. Only as the last
resort will the Guide be sold at a price,
said Friedmanij.
His other chief concern is to hire a
staff. Over the next two weeks, he will
be hiring three editors and course
reporters. Reporters will earn $3 for
each class in which they distribute and
tabulate data.
