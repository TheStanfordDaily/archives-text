# French, Italian Lecturers Dispute Contract Format
## 
### RIV WEBER 
Lecturers in the French and Italian Department are complaining of the lack
of a professorial ladder in their department, which they claim denies them the
same contract renewal rights as those of untenured faculty in other
departments.
Currently the eight lecturers are given one-year contracts with no guarantee
of renewal. None have doctorates in their field nor can they receive tenure.
However, Department Chairman Alphonse Juilland said this is going to
change next autumn when a form of tenure will be offered. A lecturer will then
have a status comparable to that of an assistant professor. A step above that
will be senior lecturer, the equivalent of an associate professor. At the top of
the ladder is "adjunct professor," comparable to a full professor.
Four extended five-year contracts will be offered next year in the
department, to comply with this new plan. Three of the five French lecturers
and one of three Italian lecturers will receive these contracts. The other
lecturers will continue with the same one-year appointments, renewable each
year.
Juilland explained the new contracts as "an effort by the administration

to improve the situation for the
lecturers."
However, competition among eight
language teachers has caused
dissension within the department.
Some of the lecturers have
described the setup as demeaning. New
contracts are often issued only a few
months in advance.
Leda Mussio, a lecturer in Italian,
said she came to the United States to
teach here seven years ago, with a
degree from the University of
Florence.
"Although I knew my contract was
a one-year contract, it was written on
the contract that it was to be
considered a permanent position," said
Mussio.
Lecturer Emily Olmsted has her
M.A. in Italian from UC-Berkeley. She
said she was given a verbal agreement
similar to the one given Mussio.
In the past six years, at least five
part-time members of the French and
Italian Department have been hired
with no prior teaching experience.
There is concern among the
lecturers that this will reoccur in the
future, should some of the present
contracts be discontinued. Observers
within the department feel the present
experienced teachers should be
retained. Juilland insisted that the
department will maintain "very high
standards."
