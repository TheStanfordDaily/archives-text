# Campus Crime Probes: It's Up To The Officer
## 
### BONNY RODDEN First of Two Parts 
Many students think they can
indulge in illegal sex acts, marijuana
parties and drunk driving sprees at
Stanford without being harassed by
the police.
Technically, those students are
wrong.
In 1971, when the Stanford Police
Department was deputized, the police
became obligated to investigate all
crimes as long as the officers found
reasonable cause.
Do officers actually follow through
with their obligation? It's up to the
officer, Director of Police Services
Marvin Herrington said. "We train
them but essentially they work on
their own."
Investigating More Violations
Training Officer Herman Williams, a
17-year veteran of the Stanford police
force, stated that officers who have
recently graduated from the police
academy, where they receive more
than five months of training, generally
investigate more violations than the
"old-timers. They check everything
out, applying everything they have
learned at the academy," he said.
Regarding marijuana-related crimes,
Williams said the officers are not
instructed to "go out looking for

them." He said he personally felt
"what a person does in the privacy of
his or her own home is up to him or
her."
However, he continued, ''If
smoking is done blatantly in front of
us, we're going to do something about
it whether we think it's right or
wrong."
According to current law, if a
Stanford police officer, responding to
a burglary in a dormitory, smells and
sees marijuana smoke coming from
under a door, he is obligated to
investigate to see whether a crime is
actually being committed.
Specific Evidence
Herrington noted the difficulty the
officers have in proving in court that
the occupants of the room were
actually smoking dope. The officer has
to provide specific evidence, surh as a
marijuana cigarette found in the room.
He must also prove he is an expert and
qualified to enter the room with
reasonable cause in the first place.
But Herrington also remarked, "I
don't have the manpower to go around
sniffing under doors."
Stanford police are also instructed
to be aware of other victimless crimes,
such as sexual intercourse involving a
minor. It is their responsibility to
investigate any vehicle parked in an

unusual spot at an unusual hour ii
case a rape or assault is in progress,
according to Williams.
'Parking'
Williams said, "[I put| on my
searchlight and flash my red lights
when approaching a parked car/' He
explained that this procedure gives the
couple a chance to sit up and be aware
that the police are in the vicinity.
He said he questions the occupants
to see whether or not they are
Stanford students. He added that he
uses "his sixth sense" to decide
whether or not to ask for an
identification, proving the person's
age.
He said he asks non-Stanford
students to leave the campus.
However, he remarked that Stanford
students should be left undisturbed
because "this is their home. This is like
their backyard and they have a right to
use all the facilities."
One officer remarked that in the
days before co-educational dorms,
students regularly fornicated in their
cars in the eucalyptus groves. He said
he would look for Stanford parking
stickers on the cars. If the cars had the
stickers the occupants would be left
alone. If not, the couple would be
asked to leave campus.

THE SYMBOL OF AUTHORITY—The Stanford Police Department — a part of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department — represents police authority on campus. But how far does it go to enforce that authority? Officer Phillip
Love (in car), about to go on duty, is the lav/'s first line of defense. He will not go out looking for offenders, but if he
sees an illegal act in public he should use his discretion on whether to make an arrest, according to police chief Marvin

Specific Evidence
Herrington noted the difficulty the
officers have in proving in court that
the occupants of the room were
actually smoking dope. The officer has
to provide specific evidence, surh as a
marijuana cigarette found in the room.
He must also prove he is an expert and
qualified to enter the room with
reasonable cause in the first place.
But Herrington also remarked, "I
don't have the manpower to go around
sniffing under doors."
Stanford police are also instructed
to be aware of other victimless crimes,
such as sexual intercourse involving a
minor. It is their responsibility to
investigate any vehicle parked in an

unusual spot at an unusual hour ii
case a rape or assault is in progress,
according to Williams.
'Parking'
Williams said, "[I put| on my
searchlight and flash my red lights
when approaching a parked car/' He
explained that this procedure gives the
couple a chance to sit up and be aware
that the police are in the vicinity.
He said he questions the occupants
to see whether or not they are
Stanford students. He added that he
uses "his sixth sense" to decide
whether or not to ask for an
identification, proving the person's
age.
He said he asks non-Stanford
students to leave the campus.
However, he remarked that Stanford
students should be left undisturbed
because "this is their home. This is like
their backyard and they have a right to
use all the facilities."
One officer remarked that in the
days before co-educational dorms,
students regularly fornicated in their
cars in the eucalyptus groves. He said
he would look for Stanford parking
stickers on the cars. If the cars had the
stickers the occupants would be left
alone. If not, the couple would be
asked to leave campus.

THE SYMBOL OF AUTHORITY—The Stanford Police Department — a part of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department — represents police authority on campus. But how far does it go to enforce that authority? Officer Phillip
Love (in car), about to go on duty, is the lav/'s first line of defense. He will not go out looking for offenders, but if he
sees an illegal act in public he should use his discretion on whether to make an arrest, according to police chief Marvin
Herrington,
Many students think they can
indulge in illegal sex acts, marijuana
parties and drunk driving sprees at
Stanford without being harassed by
the police.
Technically, those students are
wrong.
In 1971, when the Stanford Police
Department was deputized, the police
became obligated to investigate all
crimes as long as the officers found
reasonable cause.
Do officers actually follow through
with their obligation? It's up to the
officer, Director of Police Services
Marvin Herrington said. "We train
them but essentially they work on
their own."
Investigating More Violations
Training Officer Herman Williams, a
17-year veteran of the Stanford police
force, stated that officers who have
recently graduated from the police
academy, where they receive more
than five months of training, generally
investigate more violations than the
"old-timers. They check everything
out, applying everything they have
learned at the academy," he said.
Regarding marijuana-related crimes,
Williams said the officers are not
instructed to "go out looking for

them." He said he personally felt
"what a person does in the privacy of
his or her own home is up to him or
her."
However, he continued, ''If
smoking is done blatantly in front of
us, we're going to do something about
it whether we think it's right or
wrong."
According to current law, if a
Stanford police officer, responding to
a burglary in a dormitory, smells and
sees marijuana smoke coming from
under a door, he is obligated to
investigate to see whether a crime is
actually being committed.
