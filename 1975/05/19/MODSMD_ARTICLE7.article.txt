## Bungled Rescue 
### 
The incident last week, involving the seizure of the
American merchant vessel S.S. Mayaguez and its crew by
Cambodian gunboats called for a careful, deliberate
response by the U.S. government. Instead, through rash
actions that included ship sinkings, Marine invasions and
bombing of a Cambodian airfield, the U.S. caused much
destruction and loss of life that might easily have been
prevented through more patient negotiation.
Certainly the Cambodians' actions in this case are
virtually indefensible: seizure of the ship essentially
amounts to theft and kidnaping in neutral territory
without provocation. And in such cases, we cannot
dispute that the U.S. government ought to take steps to
bring about the return of American property and, most
important, the preservation of American lives. Killing to
save lives, however, is usually a doubtful proposition,
especially when the killing takes place before other ways
of resolving the situation have been tried.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's rationale for the
sinking of three Cambodian ships and the damaging of
four others was that that ships appeared to be escorting
the Mayaguez and her crew to the Cambodian coast.
From there, Kissinger continued, they might have been
taken far inland and held, out of easy reach of American
rescue forces.
Even if we ignore the possibility that the American
crewmen might already have been taken aboard the
Cambodian ships when the ships were bombed, the
American attack seems unjustified. The attack seemed to
be based on precluding a relatively unlikely situation: if
crewmen were indeed being transported to the mainland,
and if they would then be removed to a prison far inland
and if negotiations would produce no solution, then the
sinking of the gunboats might endanger fewer lives than
a future attack on the mainland to free the crew. But we feel
that the U.S. should have risked that unlikely chance and
undertaken serious negotiations.
Other aspects of the American attack constitute
nothing more than incompetent bungling. The fact that
five Marines arc dead, 16 missing and many wounded
from an attack on the wrong Cambodian island represents
more than an embarrassment. It is a horrible waste of
American lives. And the unnecessary bombing of
Cambodian airfields and the presumptuous use of bases
for Marines in Thailand without Thai permission are two
more inexcusable incidents in a generally inexcusable
battle-plan to recapture the Mayaguez.
