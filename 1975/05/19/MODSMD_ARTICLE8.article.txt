# Unfair Charges

Teri Lee criticized the Daily's
coverage of minority affairs in
her May 16 Daily letter and
some of her arguments deserve
clarification.
First, there was the May 12
Daily story entitled "Budget and
Minority Issues Spark
Nationwide Protest at 10
Colleges." The many minority
demonstrations occurring across
the country were brought forth
and explained. Stories on the
sit-in at Brown University
(involving mainly black
students) have also appeared in
recent issues of the Daily.
An article which appeared on
May 8 detailed the protest of
Asian American students at UC-
Davis. These must be some
examples of the Daily's "benign
neglect" of which Lee speaks.
Next, Lee calls Students for
Equity (SFE) "the greatest
mobilizing force in Stanford's
Third World Community." I do
not wish to dispute this point,
but SFE certainly wasn't the
"greatest mobilizing force" at
last Tuesday's demonstration.
Neither SFE, nor any minority
organization, were part of the
demonstration's "tactical
leadership." Certainly this was
not the fault of the Daily.
SFE endorsed the
demonstration but chose not to
co-sponsor it with the Alliance
for Radical Change (ARC) and
other groups. One of SFE's
reasons, similar to that adopted
by the Stanford Asian Students
Coordinating Committee

Dan Fiduccia

(SASCC),ran along the lines that
"it would not look good for a
member of SFE to appear in a
picture of a demonstration on
the front page of the Daily while
SFE was discussing various
proposals with the University."
Perhaps this is why it was not
possible to take a picture with
more than two minority faces in
it.
As for past Daily coverage of
minorities, Lee might stop to
consider the Daily articles on the
selection of Harvard Prof. Daniel
Moynihan as commencement
speaker — certainly a minority
and Third World issue.
Finally, I suggest that Lee
check with other minorities
concerning the accessibility of
the press to their actions and
meetings. Some minorities do
not keep written notes of their
meetings or resolutions, thus
making it difficult to ascertain
exactly what transpired and
what was voted on at the
meetings. On the Moynihan
controversy, one minority t group did
not even take a stand until after
it was contacted by the Daily.
The Daily was recently
misinformed, albeit
unintentionally, on the date of
one minority group's meeting,
therefore making coverage of the
meeting a bit more challenging.
The Daily's coverage of
minority groups is certainly not
perfect, but to accuse the Daily
as being solely responsible also
smacks of unfairness.

possible to take a picture with
more than two minority faces in
it.
As for past Daily coverage of
minorities, Lee might stop to
consider the Daily articles on the
selection of Harvard Prof. Daniel
Moynihan as commencement
speaker — certainly a minority
and Third World issue.
Finally, I suggest that Lee
check with other minorities
concerning the accessibility of
the press to their actions and
meetings. Some minorities do
not keep written notes of their
meetings or resolutions, thus
making it difficult to ascertain
exactly what transpired and
what was voted on at the
meetings. On the Moynihan
controversy, one minority t group did
not even take a stand until after
it was contacted by the Daily.
The Daily was recently
misinformed, albeit
unintentionally, on the date of
one minority group's meeting,
therefore making coverage of the
meeting a bit more challenging.
The Daily's coverage of
minority groups is certainly not
perfect, but to accuse the Daily
as being solely responsible also
smacks of unfairness.

Teri Lee criticized the Daily's
coverage of minority affairs in
her May 16 Daily letter and
some of her arguments deserve
clarification.
First, there was the May 12
Daily story entitled "Budget and
Minority Issues Spark
Nationwide Protest at 10
Colleges." The many minority
demonstrations occurring across
the country were brought forth
and explained. Stories on the
sit-in at Brown University
(involving mainly black
students) have also appeared in
recent issues of the Daily.
An article which appeared on
May 8 detailed the protest of
Asian American students at UC-
Davis. These must be some
examples of the Daily's "benign
neglect" of which Lee speaks.
Next, Lee calls Students for
Equity (SFE) "the greatest
mobilizing force in Stanford's
Third World Community." I do
not wish to dispute this point,
but SFE certainly wasn't the
"greatest mobilizing force" at
last Tuesday's demonstration.
Neither SFE, nor any minority
organization, were part of the
demonstration's "tactical
leadership." Certainly this was
not the fault of the Daily.
SFE endorsed the
demonstration but chose not to
co-sponsor it with the Alliance
for Radical Change (ARC) and
other groups. One of SFE's
reasons, similar to that adopted
by the Stanford Asian Students
Coordinating Committee

Dan Fiduccia

(SASCC),ran along the lines that
"it would not look good for a
member of SFE to appear in a
picture of a demonstration on
the front page of the Daily while
SFE was discussing various
proposals with the University."
Perhaps this is why it was not
possible to take a picture with
more than two minority faces in
it.
