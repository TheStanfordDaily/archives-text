# Frat Doesn't Shun Blacks

### 
Glancing at the May 15 Daily,
<ve happened to notice an article
entitled "Minorities and
Fraternities: How Much in
Common?" by Betty Goodwin.
Alter reading the article, we
were surprised to learn that we
had been living in a
"anti-minority" fraternity for
the past year or more.
Our initial reaction was
incoherent giggling, but after a
while, we realized that those
who are not aware of the
situation here might actually
accept the picture painted by
the Daily.
Our philosophy at Kappa
Sigma is to extend bids to the
people that show interest in our
house and who appear to want
to help our house grow. We do
not recruit on the basis of race,
color, political preference or
religion.
Bids To People
We do not extend bids to
"minority students;" we extend
them to people, and we try not

to let stereotypical role-playing
enter into our selection process.
Apparently, Goodwin and the
Daily feel that we should recruit
certain individuals because they
are "minority students." We do
not accept this and doubt that
we ever will.
Goodwin's article is written
in a very misleading style, using
one-sided statistics that do little
more than confuse the reader.
Number Underestimated
Her statement that the
number of blacks living in
fraternities is "roughly
two-and-one-half percent of the
total black undergraduate
enrollment" does not consider
tha fact that at this time
fraternities are not allowed to
pledge women; it does not allow
for the existence of the
black-theme house in
Olivo-Magnolia, nor does it allow
for the stereotyped image of
fraternities that the Daily and
other organizations have helped
foster.

Mueller, et 01.

It also strikes us as rather odd
that although Goodwin spoke
with our rush chairman, Greg
Brown, for over an hour, she
chose to print only one
statement; the one that best
supported her position.
Perhaps some of our statistics
might provide a more
representative view of minorities
in fraternities, at least in Kappa
Sigma: "Minority students"
compose 18.8 percent of our
current membership; next year,
with the addition of our pledge
class, the percentage will
increase to 20 percent. We hope
that students will come by and
see our Canadian and Japanese
flags flapping proudly in the
breeze.
