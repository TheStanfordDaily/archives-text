# Gibbs Views Role As Go-Between
## 
### LIZ HUFFERD BRUCE KADDEN 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs views his role in relation
to SWOPSI and SCIRE as an
"intermediary between the faculty and
the programs," according to minutes
of the Ad Hoc Panel on the Future of
Extra-Departmental Programs (EDP's).
Gibbs has been a strong advocate of
establishing a "faculty dean" to
oversee the quality of the
extra-departmental programs, the
minutes, obtained from an anonymous
panel member, show.
Explained Gibbs, "If the dean were
a faculty person and constantly talking
with faculty and his own department,
such a person would have a deeper
understanding of the trade-offs which
would benefit the programs in a
couple of years."
But student members of the panel
disagree. ASSU Senator Debbi Silton
said, according to the minutes, that
"the energy of the dean of
extra-departmental programs should
be directed toward the programs and
not toward the faculty."
Another panel member. Asst.
Medicine Prof. James McClenahan,
noted that the students may have a
different view than the faculty or the
dean. ''Through the
extra-departmental programs the
students have some small say in what
is important," he said. "The faculty
have not done enough to date and it is
unrealistic to expect the faculty to
change."
Accreditation
The minutes also show sharp
disagreement about accreditation of
the programs' courses.
Gibbs pointed out that the faculty
limited distribution credit for the
EDP's because they recognize the
impermanent status of the offerings.
According to the minutes, Gibbs
said he formerly was more involved in
the accreditation process, but "now he
feels more uncomfortable because he
is not so involved and does not see
proposals or have the same sense of
policy board discussions."
SWOPSI/SCIRE advocates argued
that "risk-taking" was more important
than faculty accreditation to the
EDP's. These risks are:
—that a poor course might be
offered;
