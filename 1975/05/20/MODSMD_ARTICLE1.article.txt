# Gibbs Views Role As Go-Between
## 
### LIZ HUFFERD BRUCE KADDEN 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs views his role in relation
to SWOPSI and SCIRE as an
"intermediary between the faculty and
the programs," according to minutes
of the Ad Hoc Panel on the Future of
Extra-Departmental Programs (EDP's).
Gibbs has been a strong advocate of
establishing a "faculty dean" to
oversee the quality of the
extra-departmental programs, the
minutes, obtained from an anonymous
panel member, show.
Explained Gibbs, "If the dean were
a faculty person and constantly talking
with faculty and his own department,
such a person would have a deeper
understanding of the trade-offs which
would benefit the programs in a
couple of years."
But student members of the panel
disagree. ASSU Senator Debbi Silton
said, according to the minutes, that
"the energy of the dean of
extra-departmental programs should
be directed toward the programs and
not toward the faculty."
Another panel member. Asst.
Medicine Prof. James McClenahan,
noted that the students may have a
different view than the faculty or the
dean. ''Through the
extra-departmental programs the
students have some small say in what
is important," he said. "The faculty
have not done enough to date and it is
unrealistic to expect the faculty to
change."
Accreditation
The minutes also show sharp
disagreement about accreditation of
the programs' courses.
Gibbs pointed out that the faculty
limited distribution credit for the
EDP's because they recognize the
impermanent status of the offerings.
According to the minutes, Gibbs
said he formerly was more involved in
the accreditation process, but "now he
feels more uncomfortable because he
is not so involved and does not see
proposals or have the same sense of
policy board discussions."
SWOPSI/SCIRE advocates argued
that "risk-taking" was more important
than faculty accreditation to the
EDP's. These risks are:
—that a poor course might be
offered;
—that instructors might lack
complete conventional credentials;
—that the good name of the
University might be tainted.
Faculty Judges
SWOPSI Director Andrew Parnes
"expressed concern not so much about
the criteria as about the judges," the
minutes state. He noted that faculty
rather than students are the judges
who are making decision about what
the University is. "It is a risk to go
against the mainstream of what the
faculty want."
The Ad Hoc Panel, formed by
Gibbs, is expected to release its final
report later this week, which will
include recommendations about the
programs staff and its link with the
dean's office.
SCIRE Director Alice Supton, said
last week that under the rough-draft
proposal, the programs will "retain
much of their present look" though
there "will be significant changes in
staffing."
The Committee of Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) is examining of an
undergraduate education officer,
currently Gibbs' position, on a broad
scale.
Lisa Lang, a student member of
both the ad hoc panel and C-US, said
she thought the faculty interest in
absorbing the EDP's was part of a
trend in academic policy discussions
here.
Assistant Dean
She pointed specifically to the
proposal before C-US to move the

Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies to the School of Humanities
and Sciences, making the head of
EDP's an assistant dean in the school.
Land said that Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Halsey Roydon, Assoc.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies for
Advising Mason Yearian and Provost
William Miller supported the proposal.
Asst. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Sally Monfort explained the
advantages of this proposal in an
interview last week.
"Humanities and sciences teaches a
majority of undergraduates." so it's a
"logical place to have someone who is
concerned with undergraduates."
Monfort added that there is "value
in extra-departmental programs," but
that "some courses ought to be taught
in departments." She cited a greater
flexibility of the school to work with
departments than the current
arrangement.
'Centrality'
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Clossen explained
the dispute in an April 17 memo to
the committee.
"The dean has consistently stressed
his belief that institutional 'centrality'
and respectability are major objectives
to be pursued by" EDP's Clossen
wrote.
"The motivation behind this stance
is the belief that stability and
administrative effectiveness can best
be achieved by these programs if they
are closely integrated to the University
and administrative structure."
