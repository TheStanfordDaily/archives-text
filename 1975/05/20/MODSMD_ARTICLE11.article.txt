# New Council Represents Business
## 
### William Ross 
Regardless of what they call themselves,
Palo Alto's four city council election victors
are developmentalists who represent the
city's business interests. Supporters of
environmental concerns and social services
might as well resign themselves to enduring
at least two lean years.
Fred Eyerly, Scott Carey, Anne
Witherspoon and incumbent Roy Clay claim
that they represent the whole city rather
than any particular group. Eschewing the
label "developmentalist," they avoid even
the name of "PA '75" which they have been
given by the media.
Draping themselves in non-partisanship,
they have expressed righteousindignationat
the slate politics of their opponents, the
Association for a Balanced Community
(ABC). But it is no secret that they all share
the same views and worked together during
the past election as a team.
Go-Slow Attitude
All of them advocate having the city go
slow on social welfare concerns. Typical of
their attitude toward low-income housing is
what Eyerly told the Daily last week after
his election.
Eyerly noted that Palo Alto is a leader
among local communities in the amount of
low income housing it has constructed. He
said that the city ought to wait for other
towns to catch up with Palo Alto before
building more. Otherwise, the city will attract
too many low income residents, he implied.
Of course, such people must go
somewhere, but apparently PA '75 members
don't care where so long as it isn't to Palo
Alto.
The slate's members have emphasized,
however, that their minds are open on
environmental matters. This may be true,
but their past record certainly doesn't prove
it.
Clay is also a real estate developer and
Witherspoon and Eyerly have long
supported development of the foothills.
Before his election to the council,
Eyerly's main political role was serving as

president of the Crescent Park
Ho me owner's Association, which
vehemently protested the location of a drug
abuse center in its vicinity.
Carey, of Cornish and Carey Real Kstate,
fought hard in 1971 promoting a highrise
development project — dubbed
"Superblock" — in downtown Palo Alto.
Richard Rosenbaum, Carey's successful
antagonist in that venture, went down to
defeat in last week's election.

The PACDAB Factor
Last year, Eyerly was a leader in the
protest against Palo Alto Drug Abuse Board
(PACDAB), claiming that it wasted city
funds and was too political since it
advocated a Marxist viewpoint.
As it turned out, Eyerly and the other
PA '75 candidates used the drug abuse issue
as a means of defeating their opponents.
Incumbents Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson, and to a lesser extent
Rosenbaum all were accused by their
opponents of failing to criticize PACDAB's
controversial political pronouncements
harshly enough.
Pearson told the Daily after her defeat
that her opponents made a conscious effort
during the election campaign to associate
her with some of PACDAB's radical
positions, such as its advocacy of Marxism
and its jubilation at the Communist triumph
in Indochina.
Both Henderson and Rosenbaum agreed
that they had unfairly been smeared during
the campaign.

Unlike Pearson, who rightly defends the
privilege of PACDAB to advocate political
views, Henderson and Rosenbaum opposed
their expression of such views, so the
charges against Henderson and Rosenbaum
were particularly unfair.
All three said that the voters reacted in
fear to the charges that they were
encouraging radicalism in the drug abuse
center.
Actually, all three had advocated taking
a hard look at how the center could be
reformed — a position not much different
from that of their opponents.
Role Of The 'Times'
Pearson and Henderson stressed that the
Palo Alto Times's endorsement of their
opponents and its emphasis on the drug
issue was a key factor in their defeat.
Noting that neither the Times's publisher
nor its editor live in Palo Alto or have ever
attended a council meeting, Pearson said
that it is unjust that the paper should have
decided the outcome of the election.
Since the final vote totals of all the
candidates were, relatively close, it is likely
that the paper's endorsements did indeed
decide the outcome of the election.
During the next two years, many critical
issues will come before the council.
These include the question of density
limits on Stanford Industrial Park,
extension of Willow Road to El Camino,
development of foothills and Bay Area land,
recycling of waste materials, and
reevaluation of height limits on city
buildings.
It is too early to predict just how the
council, with a 7-2 developmentalist
majority, will react to these issues.
But judging by the past records of the
majority's members, the outlook isn't very
hopeful for people who believe in social
service spending and preservation of the
environment.
