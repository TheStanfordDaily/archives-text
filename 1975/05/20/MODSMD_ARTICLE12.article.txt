# McCloskey Fools His Constituents
## 
### 
I have pity for Rep. Pete
McCloskey's press secretary Bill
Johnson. McCloskey has said
one thing and then voted the
opposite way so often, and has
voted on both sides of an issue
so many times, that it is very
difficult for McCloskey's press
secretary to explain his
positions. Maybe that is why
Pete has two press secretaries:
Johnson and Kathy
Cunningham.
In the May 16 Daily, Johnson
tried to explain McCloskey's
position on humanitarian and
evacuation aid for South
Vietnam. Johnson wrote:
"When the vote for

humanitarian and evacuation
relief aid came up on April 23,
McCloskey offered an
amendment that would prevent
President Ford from using any
American military force to
evacuate Vietnamese citizens
from South Vietnam .. . His
amendment was rejected, and he
voted against the bill."
That statement is not true.
McCloskey offered no such
amendment, spoke for only one
minute before the 14-hour, April
23 debate on the aid bill, and
voted against the peace forces on
the most important vote on the
bill.
The House of Representatives

debate on the Vietnam
Humanitarian Assistance and
Evacuation Act of 1975 appears
on pages H3OBl-H3105 and
H3142-H3 212 of the
Congressional Record. Before
the bill was passed, the House
voted on 45 amendments.
McCloskey sponsored no
amendments.
According to the Coalition to
Stop Funding the War,
McCloskey voted the wrong way
on the amendment that provided
the key test vote on the bill.
McCloskey's one minute of
debate on April 23 is instructive
for two reasons. First, it appears
in the Congressional Record
before any votes were taken, but
was inserted under a House rule
that permitted McCloskey to
"revise and extend his remarks."
In plain language this means that
McCloskey wrote his "speech"
after all the votes were taken.
That way, before any voting
took place it appears that he
"said" he was in favor of
humanitarian aid, even though
he had already voted against the
Meyner amendment.
Second, what McCloskey said
on April 23 helps explain both
his support of Ford's attack on
Cambodia over the Mayaguez
seizure, and his sadness over the
death of the U.S. marines who
took part in the attack.
McCloskey said on April 23:
"I would probably authorize
the use of B-52 bombers and
whatever other military force
might be necessary to save a
Marine of this country"
( Congressional Record, page
H3139).
.loin The Surge
Before Johnson and the rest
of McCloskey's overworked
press staff begin reading their
Congressional Records, I suggest
they read the front page of the
same Daily that contains
McCloskey's article.
The front page article reports
that Pete is once again
considering retirement.

The 1976 Republican Party
primary will be a much different
one than any MeCloskey has
participated in before. Campaign
financing laws restrict spending
to less than $100,000, while
MeCloskey spent more than
$150,000 (before inflation) in
the last two primaries.
MeCloskey won those
Republican primaries with
Democratic volunteers, money,
and votes — all of which should
be greatly reduced following his
latest change of position.
Rather than join McCloskey's
Republican opponents in
shedding crocodile tears over his
impending departure, Johnson
should join the surge, register to
vote in the 1976 Democratic
Party primary, and phone
326-PETE to say "Good-bye
Pete."

relief aid came up on April 23,
McCloskey offered an
amendment that would prevent
President Ford from using any
American military force to
evacuate Vietnamese citizens
from South Vietnam .. . His
amendment was rejected, and he
voted against the bill."
That statement is not true.
McCloskey offered no such
amendment, spoke for only one
minute before the 14-hour, April
23 debate on the aid bill, and
voted against the peace forces on
the most important vote on the
bill.
The House of Representatives

debate on the Vietnam
Humanitarian Assistance and
Evacuation Act of 1975 appears
on pages H3OBl-H3105 and
H3142-H3 212 of the
Congressional Record. Before
the bill was passed, the House
voted on 45 amendments.
McCloskey sponsored no
amendments.
According to the Coalition to
Stop Funding the War,
McCloskey voted the wrong way
on the amendment that provided
the key test vote on the bill.
McCloskey's one minute of
debate on April 23 is instructive
for two reasons. First, it appears
in the Congressional Record
before any votes were taken, but
was inserted under a House rule
that permitted McCloskey to
"revise and extend his remarks."
In plain language this means that
McCloskey wrote his "speech"
after all the votes were taken.
That way, before any voting
took place it appears that he
"said" he was in favor of
humanitarian aid, even though
he had already voted against the
Meyner amendment.
Second, what McCloskey said
on April 23 helps explain both
his support of Ford's attack on
Cambodia over the Mayaguez
seizure, and his sadness over the
death of the U.S. marines who
took part in the attack.
McCloskey said on April 23:
"I would probably authorize
the use of B-52 bombers and
whatever other military force
might be necessary to save a
Marine of this country"
( Congressional Record, page
H3139).
.loin The Surge
Before Johnson and the rest
of McCloskey's overworked
press staff begin reading their
Congressional Records, I suggest
they read the front page of the
same Daily that contains
McCloskey's article.
The front page article reports
that Pete is once again
considering retirement.

The 1976 Republican Party
primary will be a much different
one than any MeCloskey has
participated in before. Campaign
financing laws restrict spending
to less than $100,000, while
MeCloskey spent more than
$150,000 (before inflation) in
the last two primaries.
MeCloskey won those
Republican primaries with
Democratic volunteers, money,
and votes — all of which should
be greatly reduced following his
latest change of position.
Rather than join McCloskey's
Republican opponents in
shedding crocodile tears over his
impending departure, Johnson
should join the surge, register to
vote in the 1976 Democratic
Party primary, and phone
326-PETE to say "Good-bye
Pete."
(Herb Borock is a Stanford
alumnus.)
I have pity for Rep. Pete
McCloskey's press secretary Bill
Johnson. McCloskey has said
one thing and then voted the
opposite way so often, and has
voted on both sides of an issue
so many times, that it is very
difficult for McCloskey's press
secretary to explain his
positions. Maybe that is why
Pete has two press secretaries:
Johnson and Kathy
Cunningham.

tried to explain McCloskey's

Vietnam. Johnson wrote:
