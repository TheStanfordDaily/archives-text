Misguided Campaign
Editor:
The campaign against Prof.
Bruce Lusignan and othen.
connected with the Iranian
contract is based upon a premise
that research projects supported
by foreign governments must
meet the approval of the
dissident citizens of that country
who are guests and beneficiaries
of this country and this
University.
The Iranian dissidents appear
to have allied themselves with
their local American
counterparts, sharing a common
bond of dislike and/or mistrust
for their own governments.
It is irrational to suppose that
research must meet the approval
not only of the researcher, the
University and the sponsoring
government, but also that of our
foreign and domestic dissidents.
Any project could be found
wanting by some disaffected
group; there are both left and
right wing dissidents, and many
factions not so neatly labelled.
In this classic example, it is
claimed that a communications
system engineered for education
by an American university is evil
because the Iranian government
might use it for repression.
The faulty logic of this claim
is so extreme that it seems
almost a parody on the act of
dissidence. If the Iranian
government wanted a tool for
repression, it could find a more
pliable contractor to do the job.
The very selection of our
University is a tribute to the
underlying educational
motivation.
A project which meets the
approval of the University and
the foreign sponsoring
government and the researcher
cannot be required to meet the
approval of all dissidents.
The very existence of the
government and University
approvals would lead toward
disapproval by disaffected
minds. If the Iranian project is
stopped by this campaign, then a
principle is set that is highly
deleterious to the cause of
freedom.
I believe the University
should take a lead in making this
point clear, rather than
following passively to see where
events will lead.

Kudos For Editorial
Editor:
I applaud the Daily editorial
of May 14 which called for a
reconsideration of the decision
to eliminate the department
ceremonies from the 1975
commencement. Surely the
administration does not regard
Stanford as merely another
diploma factory.
However, the economization
of the commencement cheapens
the sense of accomplishment
which the ceremony should
convey. Fatigue and cynicism
will be the likely reaction of
many after being herded through
the massive affair in Frost
Amphitheater.
Such a reaction will be
justified not only by the change
in the character of
commencement. The unilateral
decision by Thomas Bacchetti
and the casual announcement of
that decision by that paragon of
charm, Vice President Robert
Rosenzweig, gives credence to
charges of administration
arrogance.
Might I suggest that the
decision to save $10,000 in 1975
is short-sighted? When the
halcyon days of college are
invoked by those who solicit
gifts for the University, I will
not be surprised to learn of
reluctance to donate on the part
of the Class of 1975.
