Why hasn't the new Palo Alto City
Council gotten around to getting rid of
Mayor Byron Sher? —G.J.S.
One good reason is that the new
council members, elected last week,
don't take their seats until July 1 —
not to imply, of course, that the Daily
or anybody else knows for sure that
they'll vote to unseat Sher.

/ understand the Palo Alto Farm was
originally named after a redwood tree,
the Palo Alto, which is still on campus
somewhere, complete with plaque. Is
this true? Where is the tree? — S.C.
The El Palo Alto tree was
discovered by the explorer Portola and
his party in 1769 — when it was
already 300 years old. Although no
one knows how tall the tree was then

(it now towers over 130 feet), its
height obviously impressed Portola
enough to name the surrounding area
"Palo Alto" or "tall stick."
The tree was originally two trees
which had grown together, until it was
struck by lightning in 1881. One side
managed to survive and the giant
redwood — actually a "sequoia
sempervirens" — is still standing on
Palo Alto Avenue, east of El Camino,
by the train trestle. The tree and its
plaque are carefully watched over by
David Laßa, the city's tree
maintenance supervisor, who keeps a
bi-weekly record on the El Palo Alto.

I am an enthusiast of the sunroof on
the Women's Gym and have been
wondering if the new high rise

engineering building, planned to be
built next to the gym, will ruin our
sunbathing. — D.M.
Relax, your sunroof, the "last
sanctuary on campus," according to
Ruth Kaiser (administrative
coordinator for physical education), is
safe. The original plans for the
building would have effectively
eliminated the sunroof, but they have
since been modified to "cut the
vision."
"When our department chairman
saw the plans for the building, that
was the first thing she said — 'What
will happen to our sundeck?' " said
Kaiser. "There was only a relatively
small area in the building where the
deck could be seen — but that's all it
takes, of course."
