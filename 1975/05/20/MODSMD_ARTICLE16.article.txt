## Funny Lady Is Funny, And Good 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
Never mind that Funny Lady has been out for two months
and that half of you have seen it — that's beside the point.
This review is to show that 1 don't hate all movies.
Many of you have complained that I've panned everything
recently; not everything — just anything that's a smash at the
box office. I liked The Prisoner of Second Avenue, which
lasted in the theatres about two weeks. I liked Shark's
Treasure, which lasted one week. And I liked Rafferty and The
Gold Dust Twins, which lasted for about five hours.
So watch closely, because I'm about to give a favorable
review. I have a feeling this is one movie I can't give the kiss of
death to by writing a good review.
Those who say musicals are dead are proved wrong by one
movie a year (which is a slight decline from the '30s I have to
admit).
Recently there was Cabaret and Fiddler On The Roof
(there was also Ma me, but to mention it would ruin my
argument).
