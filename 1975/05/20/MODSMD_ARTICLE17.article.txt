And now there's Funny Lady, with its beautiful music, a
mixture of classics by Billy Rose (Just Me And My Shadow)
and new songs that Barbra belts as beautifully as ever (How
Lucky Can You Get, Let's Hear It For Me) by John Kander
and Fred Ebb (who also did Cabaret).
The movie is a flashy, gaudy, nostalgic trip into the past
that you don't have to be over 40 to enjoy. The conclusion of
Fanny Brice's story has been long awaited, and there is a
familiarity here that makes us feel like we are watching
friends.
What more, I ask you, can you ask from a movie than
Barbra Streisand (the only actress in the top 10 grossers), and
James Caan, bubbling with charisma and overflowing with
talent, and a story of heartbreak and happiness that is
absorbing and fascinating? Nothing — absolutely nothing.
Funny Lady is the best musical I have ever seen, including
Funny Girl (lower those eyebrows!).
Remember, fans, this is your last chance to see Streisand
for quite awhile. Her next movie, Rainbow Road/A Star Is
Born, hasn't started filming yet because director Jon Peters
(her boyfriend) hasn't finished his directing classes at UCLA.
Barbra turns in a typically superb performance; James Caan
surpasses everything he's done except The Gambler. Director
Herbert Ross (The Owl and the Pussycat) and producer Ray
Stark (For Pete's Sake) have created a great film. There is
simply no more to say.
And there you have it. 1 loved all two-and-a-half-hours of
Funny Ijidy. Remember, as finals approach you can do many
things that may mess up your lives forever. Going to see
Funny Lady is definitely not one of them.
