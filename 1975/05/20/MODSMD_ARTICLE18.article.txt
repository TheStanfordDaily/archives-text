## Small Club Jazz: Tyner's Overpowering 
### DAVE SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO — When McCoy Tyner's piano playing is at
its most intense, he sings wordlessly and faintly along with his
violent music. He raises his hands high above the keyboard and
then brings them down to produce savagely loud and dissonant
chords.
Around him a chorus of percussion instruments sings —
saxophonist Azar Lawrence, crouched on the stage, beats intently
on a wood-block; Wilby Fletcher's cymbals crash; percussionist
Guilherme Franco, his face contorted in an expression of either joy
or pain, plays brutally on cowbells, whistles, rattles or conga
drums.
But though these three musicians played as hard as they could
and bassist Joony Booth's instrument sounded with a thick and
powerful tone, Tyner's piano was the soul of the music at his
Keystone Korner performance May 11. Merely watching him,
leaning over the keyboard and concentrating so totally on the
music, is a captivating experience.
Certainly the attractions of McCoy Tyner and his band have
become clear to jazz audiences, who pack the Keystone for Tyner's
performances and buy his records — he has made four successful
albums in a little over a year.
And as Tyner's first set progressed, three pieces and well over an
hour long, the crowd at the Keystone became immersed in Tyner's
overpowering music in the way that only an audience in a small
club can experience jazz.
To be sure, the set had quieter moments as well, such as Booth's
lovely bass solo and the introduction to the first piece, "Sama
Layuca," featuring a brief, mysterious duet with Tyner on an
Indian tamboura and Franco on tablas.
But most of the time, the Tyner quintet played music that was
passionately loud, capturing the primitive African spirit that has
become more and more the dominant force in Tyner's music. He is,
for the most part, more a percussionist than a pianist.
Even in his solo ballad, "In a Sentimental Mood," pounding the
keys, making a sound far more akin to that of the African kalimba
and thumb piano than to a Western symphonic piano, Tyner makes
no conscious attempt to refine his music from the simple,
overwhelmingly rhythmic roots of jazz.
