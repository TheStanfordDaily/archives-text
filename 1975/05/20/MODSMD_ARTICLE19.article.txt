Backstage between sets, the mood is different. Tyner sits
wearily on a couch in the dark back room and makes sparse
conversation with some fans. Nearby Joony Booth sits on the floor
smoking, his eyes closed. And in the furthest-back of the
Keystone's back rooms, Azar Lawrence eats a salad and drains a
tall glass of milk.
He talks about his career, first as a saxophonist for several bands
in his native Los Angeles. "There's lots of jazz in L.A.," he says,
"but you can't usually find it. It's just so spread out you get tired
of looking for it. But Elvin heard me at a club there and then he
took me right out of L.A. with his band."
Elvin is Elvin Jones, the great drummer who brought Lawrence
to New York and catapulted Azar into stardom. Since then, his
career has included a set with Miles Davis in Carnegie Hall, trips to
Europe and Japan with Tyner's group, and, early this year, the
release of his own solo album, triggering speculation that he might
soon form his own group.
"I'm not in any hurry for that," says Lawrence .'"There'll be a
time when I'll be ready to do my own music most of the time, but
right now there's no one I'd rather play with than McCoy. I love
being a part of this band so much."
