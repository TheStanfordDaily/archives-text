# Police: University Guides Arrest Policy At Sit-Ins

### BONNY RODDEN Last of Two Parts 
In last week's protest over the
University's financial aid policy and
the Communication Department's
contract with Iran, Director of Police
Services Marvin Herrington said he
would have arrested anyone doing
anything "blatantly illegal."
However, in dealing with the
students who were sitting in the Old
Union, he said he looked to the
administration for guidance.
While the Old Union is essentially a
public place which students have a
right to enter, Herrington said, "I look
at the University as a homeowner and
ask it, 'Do you want me to go in there
and get (the protestors] out?' "
Herrington said none of the police
officers were ordered to close any of
the departments in the building.
However, "if we had seen the crowd
running over there with blood in their
eyes, we would have tried to get there
ahead of time and warn the staff," he
added.
He commented that there was a
fine line to be drawn between an order
by the police and advice.
Changing Policy
Herrington went on to explain how
the phenomenon of having authority
but not being able to use it exists at
protests. Frequently officers witness
illegal acts but are unable to arrest the
offender because of the crowd's
physical power to "pull the offender
away," he said.
Questioned about University
control of the police department,
Herrington stated the policy has
changed since police were deputized in
1971.
Previously, the University had
much control over how the police
enforced the laws. There were special
citations for students, which were not
filed with the Santa Clara County
Municipal Court as traffic citations for
non-students were.
Also, since officers were not
obligated to report any offenses to the
sheriff, they had the option to report
law violations to resident assistants or
the Dean of Student Affairs. The
University could protect the students

from criminal sentences using this
method.
These policies led to allegations
that "the University was trying to
protect Stanford students and
prosecute outsiders."
Herrington asserted that there is no
double standard presently in the way
students and non-students are treated.
The University can no longer set any
special policy for Stanford students,
he said.
Between 1968 and 1971 when the
Stanford police were "ordinary
citizens" and lacked the power to give
traffic citations, the police protected
