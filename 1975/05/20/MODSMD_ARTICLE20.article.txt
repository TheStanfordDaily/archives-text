# Wednesday Night At Lambda Nu
## Musselwhite Plays Bedrock Blues 
### DAN FORTE 
"Somebody's got to play the
blues," according to Charlie
Musselwhite. And that's been
the harmonica player's business
for nearly half of his 31 years.
Charlie will demonstrate just
how he plays the blues
tomorrow night at 7:30 in
Lambda Nu, as part of the
"History of the Blues." For the
performance (which costs a
dollar) Charlie will be
accompanied by, and will
accompany, guitarist Luther
Tucker.
When it comes to
Chicago-style blues. Tucker and
Mussel are as respected as any
instrumentalists active today.

Since coming to the West
Coast in 1967 (by way of
Mississippi, Memphis and
Chicago), Charlie Musselwhite
has been one of the top band
leaders in the Bay Area. And his
bands have always been blues
bands.
As Pete Welding wrote on the
back of Charlie's seccfnd LP,
"Charlie remains unalterably
committed to the direct, honest,
bedrock, truth-saying stone
blues .... Not rock-and-roll, not
acid-rock, not psychedelic
freakout music and the like —
nothing but stone blues."
It is this dedication to the
idiom which sets Charlie apart
from other young, white

bluesmen. While the Paul
Butterfields, Mike Bloomfields,
Johnny Winters and John
Mayalls have long since drifted
into more commercial modes,
Memphis Charlie keeps blowing
the blues away.
Nearly all of the whites who
have ever played blues could
accurately be termed as "blues
interpreters." But, not Charlie
Musselwhite. As pianist Dave
Alexander said, "If it wasn't for
his Caucasian face, sometimes
I'd swear Charlie was a nigger."
