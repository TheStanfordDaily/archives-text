# At The Magic Theater
## Two Macabre Studies Of Today THEATER 
### JANICE L. ROSS 
SAN FRANCISCO
Experimental Theatre in San
Francisco recently received a
major boost when Sam Shepard
moved to the Bay Area.
Shepard, a native Californian, is
a reflective young playwright
who has created two dozen
successful plays in New York
and London over the last several
years.
Tired of seeing his dramas
produced as "second hand
works,"Shepard has lately begun
to direct his own plays. Last
Friday evening he premiered in
this new dual role as writer and
director when the San Francisco
Magic Theatre — originally a
Berkeley-based Experimental
Theatre group — presented two
of his recent works, Killer's
Head and Action.
Both plays are thoughtful,
poignant studies of some of the
more macabre aspects of
contemporary existence. Killer's
Head is essentially a six-minute
monologue spoken by a young
ranch-hand as he sits in an
electric chair awaiting the
inevitable shock. "Dude says he
can give me a deal on that new
truck . .
Mazon, the condemned man,
commences in a slow, heavy
drawl. But as he speaks the
words tumble faster and faster
from his now frantic lips; he
talks proudly of his horse,
"Refinement, that's what he

brought to the breed . .
On one level the 'meaning' of
Killer's Head is obvious; the last
minute flash of one's life prior
to death, or the cant nostalgia of
the desperate. Both
interpretations can be equally

apt, yet the really disconcerting
quality of the play stems from
something more.
Perhaps it's the odd way
Ma/on begins again, like a
broken record with its own
sense of the dramatic, or perhaps
it's the disturbing right of a slim
young longhair in faded denims
and a t-shirt strapped to this
death machine.
Whatever the reasons, Killer's
Head is unsettling. Shepard has
created a fiercely moral and
political play that doesn't stoop
to the platitudinous. It's simple
and direct, yet only after we
reflect on it does the refulgent
poetry become clear.
In contrast, Action, Shepard's
other play on the Magic Theatre
bill, employs more conventional
means to achieve its end.
Action is a study of the
stoicism of two men and two
women in the face of the
unrelenting horror of quotidian
human existence. Intentionally
hackneyed humor, fishes in
buckets of drinking water,
characters who read with their
eyeglasses pushed up over their
foreheads, and obviously trite
metaphors about self-immolating
moths and vacant bodies are
employed to focus the
audience's attention on the
frighteningly debilitating
inaction of Action's characters.
What Shepard has done is to
contemporize the classic
absurdist characters by
shrouding them in the trappings
of "people from the real world of
the '605." The effect is all the
more chilling because these are
the figures of the so-called
enlightened generation; street
sages (Shooter), ex-convicts

(Jeep), hippie waifs (Liza), and
culture drop-outs (Lupe), who
have returned to the land as a
last refuge against creeping
nihilism.
In both plays the costumes
and props are minimal. It's

essentially the script, acting and
direction that make Killer's
Head and Action successful.
Shepard's direction is tight and
skillful in the way that only the
original author can be. All five
actors and especially the men,
Edde Roe Smith, Jack Thibeau
and James Dean are excellent.
Clearly this new Shepard/Magic
Theatre collaboration is a
fortuitous event for all involved,
and the future promises much
more action from both.
"Killc's Headland "Action"
continue through June S ul the
Magic Theatre's new
headquarters, 16IS California,
San Francisco. Shoivtinies are
Thurs. through Sat. S p.m., and
