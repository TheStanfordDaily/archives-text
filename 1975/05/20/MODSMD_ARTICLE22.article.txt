U.S. Ignores North Korea Charge
TOKYO — North Korea said yesterday the United
States considers South Korea a forward defense
area and that U.S. officials have said "they would
not hesitate" to use nuclear weapons in Korea if
necessary.
A broadcast by the official North Korean
Central News Agency alleged that President Ford
and other American officials, as part of a pledge of
continued U.S. military support to the South
Korean government, said recently they would
"launch all-out military intervention if necessary
and would not hesitate in the use of nuclear
weapons."
Asked for comment on the North Korean
charge, State Department spokesman Robert
Funseth said "that's nonsense."
The North Korea broadcast said the United
States will be "chased out of Korea and all other
regions of Asia to the last man by the
anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Asian
people as they were kicked out of Indochina."
The broadcast said U.S. "boasting" over the
rescue of the Mayaguez is the "last ditch effort of
those falling into decay. The U.S. imperialists
calculate that they can stay in Asia as ever with
strength. But this is a serious miscalculation."
The broadcast also attacked the regime of South
Korean President Chung Hee Park, which it said
"will perish for good" if it defies North Korea's
"serious warnings" and continues its
"anti-communist lunacy and reckless play with
fire."
The North Korean broadcast said Park has
spoken of giving up dialogue with the North to
"fight and win," and had taken steps to suppress
the South Korean people.
U.S. Starts Talks With Soviets
VIENNA — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromvko
yesterday for the first of two days of talks which
Kissinger said he hoped will restore the momentum
of detente.
With 100 applauding Viennese looking on, the
two shook hands in front of the Imperial Hotel
before going inside for their first conference.
Kissinger told reporters earlier that "we have a
number of problems" with the Soviet Union which
he said he hoped "we will make some progress"
overcoming.
He was vague about the problems, but a senior
American official told reporters on Kissinger's
plane Sunday that difficulties exist in the
negotiations on a strategic arms limitation treaty.
That official said Gromyko was expected to
have some ideas that might lead to a compromise,
particularly in the area of how to verify compliance
with whatever agreement is reached.
The need for cooperation between the United
States and the Soviet Union goes beyond the needs
of the two countries, Kissinger indicated. He said
world security depends up on the momentum of
peace.
Mayaguez Marine Hunt Near End
SUBIC NAVAL BASE, Philipines - The
commander of the Mayaguez assault force said
yesterday that U.S. Marines involved in the ship's
rescue are in the final stages of narrowing down
exactly where the missing are and indicated efforts
are under way to retrieve their bodies.
"We have interviewed everybody with personal
knowledge where they might have been and which
helicopter they were riding," Lt. Col. Randall
Austin, 38, of Glenside, Pa., said. He refused to
comment further on grounds the retrieval was in

the operational phase.
However, a Pentagon spokesman in Washington
said there were no plans to look for any of the
bodies. The Defense Department also identified
three of the men killed. He listed them as: Air
Force 2nd Lt. Richard Vandegeer of Buckland,
Ma£s.; Air Force Sgt. Elwood Rumbaugh of
Dothan, Ala., and Marine Lance Cpl. Ashton Loney
of Albany, N.Y.
Austin listed three marines killed and 13 missing
in the Mayaguez operation off Cambodia last week.
Defense Secretary James Schlesinger said on
Sunday that five Americans were killed — three
marines and two airmen — 16 men were missing,
and 70 to 80 were wounded.
Pentagon spokesman Joseph Laitin said
yesterday that the number of wounded in the
Mayaguez rescue was being cut back to 49, "for the
time being." Laitin said a review was being made to
determine how many men were hurt seriously
enough to be considered wounded. He noted that
some marines suffered only superficial injuries such
as sprained ankles.
Cambodian Gunboat Defeets
WASHINGTON — The crew of a Cambodian
navy subchaser has sought asylum in Thailand and
told Thai officials that their boat was the vessel
that captured the Mayaguez last week,
administration officials said late yesterday.
The Cambodians also told Thai officials that
they seized the Mayaguez on May 12 to prove to
thy new Khmer Rouge government in Phnom Penh
that they were reliable supporters of the regime.
However, they later had a change of heart and
sailed for Sattahip,Thailand, and asked for asylum.
Administration sources said there were several
discrepancies in the crew's story, including the fact
that their boat was a subchaser, while the American
crewmen aboard the Mayaguez reported they were
captured by two small gunboats.
Another report received in unofficial channels
said that there were four communist officers
aboard the Cambodian vessel and three of them
went aboard the Mayaguez. The other officer then

was overwhelmed by his crew and tossed
overboard. The crew then sailed to Thailand.
Lawyer Attacks SLA Theory
SACRAMENTO — A defense lawyer in the
Little-Remiro murder trial tried yesterday to punch
holes in the prosecution's theory that a Concord
home was a "house of death."
James Jenner, public defender for Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) member Russell Little,
suggested alternatives to the state's contention that
a Concord house was the headquarters for an SLA
plot to kill Marcus Foster.
Little and fellow SLA member Joseph Remiro
are charged with the cyanide-bullet slaying of
Foster, Oakland's superintendent of schools, in a
parking lot Nov. 6, 1973.
The prosecution contends Little and other SLA
members, visited by Remiro, planned the killing
and other terrorist activities in the Concord house.
Authorities say the house was set fire hours after
Little and Remiro were arrested Jan. 10, 1971.
Jenner showed the jury pictures taken from
another residence, the so-called Peking House
commune in Oakland. Little lived there with other
persons, some unconnected to the SLA.
Items pictured included rifles, ammunition,
typewriters, lug-soled boots and political posters,
including a collage depicting a huge cobra looking
at a baby. A seven-headed cobra was the SLA
symbol.
The idea, Jenner said afterward, was not to
prove that Foster's killing was planned in the
house, but to suggest that other explanations are as
likely as the prosecution's case.
If they're going to use a conspiracy theory, it
can go in all kinds of directions," the balding
attorney told reporters. "There was a lot they left
out."
Jenner also had an assistant examine a large map
of the San Francisco Bay Area to show that a
supposed escape route found in a notebook would
have been a roundabout way from Oakland to
Concord.
The notebook, identified by prosecution
witnesses as belonging to SLA member Nancy Ling
Perry, contained a sketch map, apparently of the
death scene. An arrow pointed to an escape route
on state highway 17, the Nimitz Freeway.
