# Lecturer Awaits Investigation
## Sex Discrimination Fight Continues 
### BETSY MORRIS 
Matilda Butler-Paisley, who filed
complaints of sex discrimination
against Stanford on .lan. 3, said that
she is continuing her fight against the
alleged discrimination while her case is
pending investigation.
Butler-Paisley, research assistant
and lecturer in the Communications
Department, charged the University
with discrimination in three areas —
equal employment opportunity, equal
educational opportunity and equal
opportunity for women on the
instructional and research staff to
participate in federally sponsored
programs.

Currently, she said, her case is
buried in a backlog of similar cases
that are pending the action of the
three federal agencies with which they
are filed. She added that it could take
anywhere from six months to a year
before the agencies will be able to send
investigators here to research the
complaints, and decide whether a law
suit is to be filed against Stanford.
She'll Fight
Butler-Paisley said that in the
meantime she will fight the alleged
discrimination from another angle. In
a leaflet summarizing her charges
against Stanford, she asks the
question, "Do $95 million in federal
awards perpetuate sex discrimination
at Stanford?"
The leaflet continues with the data
from her research that 98 percent of
Stanford's federal dollars go to men,
that the same percent of Stanford's
professors are men, as well as 93
percent of the associate professors and
84 percent of the assistant professors.
She said that she plans to send the
leaflet to Stanford's financial donors,
among them, federal agencies,
foundations and alumni. She would
not disclose the names of the specific
agencies.
Best Economic Interest
"The only way that Stanford will
change is if they feel it to their best
economic interest to change," she
explained, "that is if they will
suddenly get less money because of
their sexist policies or a potential for
more money because of a change in
those policies."
"We have a pretty good track
record on doing what we think is right

in spite of pocketbook actions," Vice
Provost William Massey said, citing the
disestablishment of ROTC and the
change of the Stanford mascot as
examples of this. "Those actions are
not needed to get our attention or to
make us do what we think is right."
"We do not believe that there has
been any discrimination," he said,
adding that he was both "concerned
that Butler-Paisley would feel moved
to file such a complaint," and eager to
get the case resolved.
Massey said that he was preparing

information to send to the agencies to
aid them with their investigation. He
cited tables of data and freshman
registration packet information as
examples.
Citing what she believes to be
changing federal attitudes toward
discrimination cases Butler-Paisley said
that she hopes the case's six month
delay will work to her advantage. "By
the time my complaint reaches the top
of the federal pile and hearings are
held, the government may be in a
tough enforcement mood," she said.
