# Lyman Approves Sharp Parking Fee Increases
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
President Richard Lyman yesterday
approved a plan providing for sharp
increases in parking fees next school
year.
Beginning in September, parking
close to the campus core will cost
faculty $48, staff $40 and off-campus
students $32 annually. On-campus
students will be required to pay $5 per
quarter. Parking fees will be eliminated
from student rental charges.
Faculty and staff currently receive
free parking privileges, while students
pay $7.50 annually for their parking
stickers.
In adopting the plan presented last
month by the University Committee
on Land and Building Development
(C-LBD), Lyman authorized the
establishment of a vehicle exclusion
zone for the main quadrangle. Remote
parking lots will remain free.
Free Parking Zone
The plan also sets aside
approximately 200 spaces in the
Wilbur Hall parking lot as a free
parking zone for off-campus students.
The new regulations make registration
manditary for all vehicles regularly
used on campus. This registration will
be free.

The new parking fees will cover
about -1800 spaces close to the
University's academic center. Roughly
3600 less convenient spaces will be
allocated for free parking. The plan
calls for a revision of these figures if
parking demands differ from the
C-LBD estimates.
Lyman, who adopted the plan after
consultation with University vice
presidents, was out of town last night
and unavailable for comment.
The new fees are considerably
lower than those recommended in an
earlier report by Peter Carpenter,
assistant vice president for medical
affairs. The Carpenter study suggested
a $60 annual charge.
Special Parking Fund
Revenues from the fees will be
earmarked for future parking and
transportation needs, according to
University and C-LBD spokesmen,
through a special parking fund.
Law Prof. Charles Meyers, C-LBD
chairman, indicated last month that
the money might be used for the
upkeep of bike paths, for improved
street lighting and for a shuttle bus.
Meyers was also unavailable for
comment yesterday.
One of the enunciated goals of the
parking plan, however, is to discourage

use ot private cars in the central
campus area.
The Lyman-approved plan
establishes a new University
Committee on Parking and
Transportation, comprised of three
students, three staff members and
three faculty. At least one person in
each category will live off campus and
one on campus.
Advisory Role
The Office of Public Safety, the
Facilities Planning Office and the
Provost's Office will each have an
ex-officio representative.
The committee will evaluate the
1975-76 regulations, survey
community attitudes, advise the
administration on alternative transit
proposals and review the parking fee
budget.
The committee's role will only be
advisory, however. Robert Augsburger.
the vice president for business and
finance will be responsible for
administering the new parking policy.
Augsburger said last night the
parking plan was "the right thing at
this time." He characterized the
Carpenter report's proposals as
■'probably too extreme, starting from
ground zero."
Fee Revenues
Revenues from the fees would be
around $226,000, while parking
administration costs will be an
estimated $180,000, according to the
University.
The $46,000 in revenues will be
used primarily for road maintenance
and police enforcement, Augsburger
said, with "perhaps some" for bike
paths, lighting, and public
transportation. He indicated that final
allocations for the expected revenues
have not been made.
The Univeristy collected roughly
$20,000 in student parking fees this
year.
New faculty and staff parking
permits will be paid on a 12-month
basis; students on a three-quarter basis.
The University will offer rebates for
those not intending to use their
parking sticker for the entire period.

be free.

The new parking fees will cover
about -1800 spaces close to the
University's academic center. Roughly
3600 less convenient spaces will be
allocated for free parking. The plan
calls for a revision of these figures if
parking demands differ from the
C-LBD estimates.
Lyman, who adopted the plan after
consultation with University vice
presidents, was out of town last night
and unavailable for comment.
The new fees are considerably
lower than those recommended in an
earlier report by Peter Carpenter,
assistant vice president for medical
affairs. The Carpenter study suggested
a $60 annual charge.
Special Parking Fund
Revenues from the fees will be
earmarked for future parking and
transportation needs, according to
University and C-LBD spokesmen,
through a special parking fund.
Law Prof. Charles Meyers, C-LBD
chairman, indicated last month that
the money might be used for the
upkeep of bike paths, for improved
street lighting and for a shuttle bus.
Meyers was also unavailable for
comment yesterday.
One of the enunciated goals of the
parking plan, however, is to discourage

use ot private cars in the central
campus area.
The Lyman-approved plan
establishes a new University
Committee on Parking and
Transportation, comprised of three
students, three staff members and
three faculty. At least one person in
each category will live off campus and
one on campus.
Advisory Role
The Office of Public Safety, the
Facilities Planning Office and the
Provost's Office will each have an
ex-officio representative.
The committee will evaluate the
1975-76 regulations, survey
community attitudes, advise the
administration on alternative transit
proposals and review the parking fee
budget.
The committee's role will only be
advisory, however. Robert Augsburger.
the vice president for business and
finance will be responsible for
administering the new parking policy.
Augsburger said last night the
parking plan was "the right thing at
this time." He characterized the
Carpenter report's proposals as
■'probably too extreme, starting from
ground zero."
Fee Revenues
Revenues from the fees would be
around $226,000, while parking
administration costs will be an
estimated $180,000, according to the
University.
The $46,000 in revenues will be
used primarily for road maintenance
and police enforcement, Augsburger
said, with "perhaps some" for bike
paths, lighting, and public
transportation. He indicated that final
allocations for the expected revenues
have not been made.
The Univeristy collected roughly
$20,000 in student parking fees this
year.
New faculty and staff parking
permits will be paid on a 12-month
basis; students on a three-quarter basis.
The University will offer rebates for
those not intending to use their
parking sticker for the entire period.
President Richard Lyman yesterday
approved a plan providing for sharp
increases in parking fees next school
year.
Beginning in September, parking
close to the campus core will cost
faculty $48, staff $40 and off-campus
students $32 annually. On-campus
students will be required to pay $5 per
quarter. Parking fees will be eliminated
from student rental charges.
Faculty and staff currently receive
free parking privileges, while students
pay $7.50 annually for their parking
stickers.
In adopting the plan presented last
month by the University Committee
on Land and Building Development
(C-LBD), Lyman authorized the
establishment of a vehicle exclusion
zone for the main quadrangle. Remote
parking lots will remain free.
Free Parking Zone
The plan also sets aside
approximately 200 spaces in the
Wilbur Hall parking lot as a free
parking zone for off-campus students.
The new regulations make registration
manditary for all vehicles regularly
used on campus. This registration will
be free.
