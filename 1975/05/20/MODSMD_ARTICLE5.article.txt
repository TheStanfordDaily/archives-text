# Delayed Announcement Prompts Student Commencement Outcry
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
The change in this year's commencement ceremonies
for the School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S) has
brought forth many complaints from students concerning
the late announcement of the decision.
This year's ceremony will have all departments within
H&S remain in Frost Amphitheatre for the first part of
the commencement, where all undergraduates and
graduates in H&S will receive their degrees together. The
consolidation of the H&S departments will save the
University about $10,000 in chair rental and labor costs.
Director of Public Events Thomas Bacchetti has stated
the decision was reached in December or January by the
president's staff, Bacchetti's office, and the Registrar's
Office.
Bacchetti said that the decision, which wasn't
confirmed until May 6 and still hasn't been officially
announced, wasn't announced sooner because "it didn't
seem to be an announcable decision. No announcements
are made concerning graduation ceremony changes."

Bacchetti stated seniors would have learned of the
decision, if it hadn't been leaked two weeks ago, this week
when they will pick up their tickets and get their
commencement instruction.
Senior class officers Lise Pfeiffer and Jim Dewell said
they were told that there probably would be some change
in the graduation ceremony last October. They added the
administration has not contacted them since then
concerning the change.
The lateness of the decision's announcement has
prevented seniors from planning any alternatives or any
possible money-making projects to pay for the extra chair
rental and other costs.
Over 30 seniors have already protested to the senior
class officers and the administration over the change in
ceremony.
Associate Dean of Humanities and Sciences Sydney
Burkhart commented "It's a shame that the information
wasn't earlier announced to students. In hindsight there
should have been a broad public announcement."
