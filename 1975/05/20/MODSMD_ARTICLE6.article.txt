# Enid Pearson Loses Council Seat, Wins A 'New Life
## 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
Enid Pearson was standing at the
gate of her white frame house on
Bryant St., waiting for Palo Alto Vice
Mayor Alan Henderson, who was to
drive her to a precinct walk. It was
10:30 on a morning that promised to
be hot.
She wore a white top. loose-fitting
red and white checked slacks, and a
light car coat. When a reporter arrived
she didn't extend her hand but nodded
and said, "A 1 should be here any
moment."
Pearson is a straightforward woman
who dispenses with formalities in
order to get down to business. Yet
beneath the brisk surface, one senses a
very human vulnerability.
She is, perhaps, the most
controversial Palo Alto City Council
member in the recent past. Some have
called her a "fiery" arch
conservationist.
"I'm the one who gives my
colleagues the most trouble." she
notes.
She has served 10 years on the
council, earning her seat as the top
vote-getter in three elections. While in
office she spearheaded a successful
campaign to save the Baylands and
authored many environmentalist
legislative proposals.

Now her days on the council are
numbered. She and other members of
a "residentialist" slate were defeated
by "establishment" PA '75 candidates
in a May 13 election. But during the
recent campaign, Pearson wasn't sure
she could win the recent race — or if
she wanted to.
Yet, she carried her campaign from
doorstep to doorstep discussing the
issues with the residents of the area
near Cowper St. south of Oregon
Expressway, considered one of the
most conservative neighborhoods in
Palo Alto.
No one is home at the first five
houses she approaches.
At the sixth house, she finds a
challenge. "So you're the rent control
lady," the man says. Then he invites
her to come in.
She demurs at the invitation ("You
don't cover ground that way," she
explained later). But she talks with
him for 15 minutes through a
half-open screen door. She tells him
how she backed rent control measures
after she learned about a retired
couple barely managing to pay
monthly rent of $180 and faced with
an arbitrary increase to $500.
"They say Enid Pearson thinks she
owns the city," the man warns her as

she leaves.
Will he vote for her? "Yes," she
says, brightening. "But he might not
have if we hadn't come by."
When Pearson walked precincts in
the past, she played a game with
whichever of her four children she
could persuade to go along. They'd
guess the reception they'd get at a
house by studying its exterior.
Usually, they'd be right.
At modern doors, she would
present herself and her brochure,
saying, "Hello, I'm Enid Pearson and
I'm running for re-election." The
pamphlet would be returned with a
smile. "We're behind you," the
resident would say.
Where a gaudy American eagle
stared up from a porch mat or a flag
decal loomed on a car. the homeowner
would wave her away. "That's a 'no'
vote," she'd say, trying not to be
depressed.
But people are impressed to see her
doing her own stumping.
A representative for the opposing
slate stole ahead of her, leaving a trail
of flyers. She picks one up and jokes,
"Let's hide it." The leaflet claimed
that Palo Alto's antidrug abuse
program was spreading "radical

alienation politics" in a scheme of
"indoctrination."
She reads the message and becomes
indignant. "It's a false issue," she says.
"Palo Alto has a $17 million budget
and this one little humanitarian
project takes only $135,000 of it."
According to the flyer, the antidrug
abuse program helps only 28 people a
month at a cost of $110 a visit.
"The point is," Pearson retorts
"that a heroin habit in Palo Alto costs
$50 a day. That means a user must
steal $50 a day. If we cure three
people a year, the program has paid
for itself."
"What's all this flack about the
drug program?" asks a young father,
picnicking with his family on his front
lawn. Two of his three babes tumble in
the nude. "It sounds like the council
takes drugs."
"Well, the opposition says the
Kennedy Institute warned against
politics in city programs," she replies.
"But they failed to add the institute
thinks ours is one of the best programs
in the country."
"Oh," laughs the man, "they left
out the second paragraph."
Afterthoughts
A 1 Henderson drives her home. "We
should have fought them on that drug
issue," he fumes in frustration. "We
should have made people talk to us
about it."
"Well, I don't do that," says
Pearson. The car stops in front of her
home.
Inside, the Pearson house is
spacious and cluttered. Two of the
councilwoman's three daughters stride
around in levis. Merit, honey-blonde
and 20, shows her mother new boots
with four-inch heels. "Ye gods!" says
Pearson. "You'll be 6-foot-4 in those!"
Merit and her sister Barnie, 17, also
tall and blonde, race through the

kitchen on their way to an afternoon
party. Paul, 22, showed up the other
night but is gone again. "CC," or
Cecilia, 12 — owner of two doves and
heaps of books — is nowhere to be
seen.
Pearson constructs a Dagwood-sized
sandwich on coarse whole grain bread
and sets it directly on the kitchen's

focal point: a communal, round oaken
table piled high with papers. She
munches without benefit of plate or
napkin.
The Only Survivor
What does she do with her time?
"Oh," she smiles, thinking. "I
read ... I go to a lot of meetings. I do
things with the kids. We took a trip
down the Green River in Utah — shoot
the rapids, you know. I go to Tahoe a
lot. I fly . . . I'm half-owner of a plane
at the Palo Alto airport.
"Last summer, my two youngest
daughters and I drove 4000 miles
across the United States for three
weeks. We camped out, and visited in
Montana where I was raised."
Enid Pearson was the "only
survivor" of a line of children born to
rugged parents. "We were poor," she
says, "only I didn't realize it at the
time."
Her father was a lumberjack, cook,
fisherman. "But he ended up a miner,"
she recalls, "until he had an accident
that forced him to use his head."
A Test Of Strength
Her mother went to work as a
janitor, "like a Carol Burnett
charwoman, you know," Pearson
reminisces. Sometimes, she helped her
mother. "I liked it; it was the only

place that was warm." In their
Montana town, temperatures fell to
50 degrees below zero.
Pearson's father invested his wife's
earnings of $50 a month in stocks
which he traded to good advantage.
Today, her mother, still alive and 90,
is well off.
It was a test of strength, to live in
that Montana town with a business
sense and little else; to survive above
all the other siblings who died in child
birth or in hunting accidents; to brave
the cold. Her parents, being self-made
people, must have had ambitions for
their only remaining child.
"Well, they never told me I was a
woman, a girl, that I couldn't do
things," says Pearson, clearing away
the sandwich crumbs. "Their attitude
was, 'Anything you want you can
have. You just have to go out and get
it.'
No Discrimination
"I never realized there was such a
thing as discrimination until I got out
into the world. Still, I went about
working toward my goals in a quiet
way. It's only recently that I've
become belligerent."
She no longer lives with her
husband Paul. Forthrightly, she says
they'd ceased to be lovers years before
they separated. She has been trying for
three-and-a-half years to get a divorce.
"So I served him papers," she says.
"He called me up saying, 'What are
these things?' " She says her husband
never really understood the freedom
his wife began to experience with her
ascent tc the council in 1965.
She moved to the living room,
a house-long hall with massive wood
furnishings and many books. Pearson
sits in a Queen Anne chair.
"I guess I went into politics because
it was the one area where I truly had
control over my life," she says.
"Nobody in my family had ever had

anything to do with it, not my father,
not my mother, not my husband. I
made my own decisions.
Coming Into Her Own
"For years, I thought my job was
to make everybody else's life perfect.
My husband was so cared for, when he
left, he'd probably forgotten how to
do anything for himself." Then,
without conscious homage to women's
liberation, she stopped being the
sacrificial pawn.
Today she is not overly worried
about the maturing children. They in
turn are not overly impressed by her
accomplishments. "Oh, I worry about
my son because I'm afraid he's not
happy; he's been on the road for five
years. And I worry about my
12-year-old because she's a genius and
it scares me. But I won't let them push
her in school. Merit and Barbie are
very mature.
"I'm not supposed to make
mistakes." Pearson saysof her role as a
council member. "And as a woman in
politics I'm fair game. Men are afraid
of me because I'm strong. Married men
ask me out on the sly [she says no),
then turn around and tell their wives
not to be like Enid Pearson. If the
word 'rape' has to be used at council
meetings, I'm the one who has to say
it."
Many Palo Altans know only the
Enid Pearson who sits at council
meetings, in the center of the panel
with eight other representatives, all
male. She speaks out frankly, firmly.
But can she really speak her mind?
"Oh no," she says."It turns people
off."
Attracts People
Yet many people are attracted to
her. She is trim, with brown hair, still
unflecked with gray, although she is
50. "Attracting men has never been a
problem," she says, her eyes twinkling.
She stops for a picture: in the
Queen Anne chair, in the backyard.
"Twenty-two times around my
backyard is a mile," she says, recalling
the days when few women jogged
around the block. Police would follow
her, assuming she was running from
something,so she took to exercising in
the privacy of her bush-fringed lot.

She smiles, and poses, for the
camera having learned how to face an
electorate during 18 years of politics,
the first eight in citizen and
environmental action groups.
She considers herself a politician.
"But I'm not very professional at
campaigning," she adds.
At the door, she discusses what will
happen if she loses the race. "Oh," she
replies, "It won't be the end of the
world. There are a lot of things I want
to do but certain things hold me back.
My marriage is one of them and
politicking another."
What does she want to do? "Oh,
read. Do the things I like: jogging,
tennis, flying. I'd like to start a
business of my own, I don't know
what yet, but some small business."
Will she run for a larger office? "Well,
I don't have any specific plans, but it's
hard to contain yourself to one little
city when you have a regional
outlook."
Plans For 4 A New Life'
After the May 13 election, when all
four developmentalist candidates
knocked all four residentialists out of
their bid, she reassured those who
called to offer condolences.
"That's all right," she said.
"All right?"

Tm not supposed
to make mistakes/

Well, yes, I m excited, and her
voice took an upswing. "I'm looking
forward to the new life we talked
about, though I'm scared, too, because
I don't know what it will be!"
"I've got it all rationalized," she
said of her loss. "I was the target after
1973; they geared for me. After the
election, the rumors they spread at
little coffees came back to me: 'she's a
pinko-communist,' 'she thinks she
owns the city.' And 'Isn't it awful that
Enid Pearson has become so rich since
she's been on the council?' That's
flatly untrue. The $250 a month I

made as a councilwoman just paid my
phone bill and Pearson Electronics
(her husband's company, for which
she has been secretary-treasurer) owns
only 1.7 acres.
On The Defensive
"There were a lot of things we did

"Men are afraid
of me because
I'm slroii".*

wrong," she says of the residential ist
campaign. "But it's hard when you're
on the defensive.
"I don't think we would have won
anyway, though. I read the papers and
I see where all over the east coast,
liberals like myself are being flung out.
It's the temper of the times. People are
scared. They vote for the capitalists
because it's expedient. They're not
interested in long-range planning or
subsidizing programs to help the
underdog: senior citizens, the drug
abusers, students and the poor.
"They're especially afraid of
socialism. It's the natural way to go,
the way we'll have to go, and people
themselves will force it on their leaders
without knowing it. But it's hard to
stay in office and say you're for
socialism."
She feels the tactics used to fight
her slate were "the tactics of
McCarthyism, but they're the same
tactics being used everywhere now. I
don't take it personally. 1 feel sad for
the city. It's lost people of real
quality: [defeated council members]
Dick |Rosenbaum], A 1 (Henderson]
and Larry | Klein] were superior
human beings. Now we have the
deadly, run-of-the-mill kind of
leadership you see everywhere."
Pearson now hopes to study
Swedish and travel: "I can go to
Canada or even Europe and take my
time about it without feeling guilty."
Mostly, she will take time to
recover. "After 10 years of total
dedication, I need just to sit back and
think."

END OF AN ERA— Enid Pearson, a controversial Palo Alto City Council member for the past 10 years, isn't known for
being gentle as a dove. Outspoken and straightforward, she carried her campaign from door to door, only to be defeated
in a May 13 election. The doves roosting in her backyard belong to her daughter Cecilia.
