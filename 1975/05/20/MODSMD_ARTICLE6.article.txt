# Enid Pearson Loses Council Seat, Wins A 'New Life
## 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
Enid Pearson was standing at the
gate of her white frame house on
Bryant St., waiting for Palo Alto Vice
Mayor Alan Henderson, who was to
drive her to a precinct walk. It was
10:30 on a morning that promised to
be hot.
She wore a white top. loose-fitting
red and white checked slacks, and a
light car coat. When a reporter arrived
she didn't extend her hand but nodded
and said, "A 1 should be here any
moment."
Pearson is a straightforward woman
who dispenses with formalities in
order to get down to business. Yet
beneath the brisk surface, one senses a
very human vulnerability.
She is, perhaps, the most
controversial Palo Alto City Council
member in the recent past. Some have
called her a "fiery" arch
conservationist.
"I'm the one who gives my
colleagues the most trouble." she
notes.
She has served 10 years on the
council, earning her seat as the top
vote-getter in three elections. While in
office she spearheaded a successful
campaign to save the Baylands and
authored many environmentalist
legislative proposals.

Now her days on the council are
numbered. She and other members of
a "residentialist" slate were defeated
by "establishment" PA '75 candidates
in a May 13 election. But during the
recent campaign, Pearson wasn't sure
she could win the recent race — or if
she wanted to.
Yet, she carried her campaign from
doorstep to doorstep discussing the
issues with the residents of the area
near Cowper St. south of Oregon
Expressway, considered one of the
most conservative neighborhoods in
Palo Alto.
No one is home at the first five
houses she approaches.
At the sixth house, she finds a
challenge. "So you're the rent control
lady," the man says. Then he invites
her to come in.
She demurs at the invitation ("You
don't cover ground that way," she
explained later). But she talks with
him for 15 minutes through a
half-open screen door. She tells him
how she backed rent control measures
after she learned about a retired
couple barely managing to pay
monthly rent of $180 and faced with
an arbitrary increase to $500.
"They say Enid Pearson thinks she
owns the city," the man warns her as

she leaves.
Will he vote for her? "Yes," she
says, brightening. "But he might not
have if we hadn't come by."
When Pearson walked precincts in
the past, she played a game with
whichever of her four children she
could persuade to go along. They'd
guess the reception they'd get at a
house by studying its exterior.
Usually, they'd be right.
At modern doors, she would
present herself and her brochure,
saying, "Hello, I'm Enid Pearson and
I'm running for re-election." The
pamphlet would be returned with a
smile. "We're behind you," the
resident would say.
Where a gaudy American eagle
stared up from a porch mat or a flag
decal loomed on a car. the homeowner
would wave her away. "That's a 'no'
vote," she'd say, trying not to be
depressed.
But people are impressed to see her
doing her own stumping.
A representative for the opposing
slate stole ahead of her, leaving a trail
of flyers. She picks one up and jokes,
"Let's hide it." The leaflet claimed
that Palo Alto's antidrug abuse
program was spreading "radical
