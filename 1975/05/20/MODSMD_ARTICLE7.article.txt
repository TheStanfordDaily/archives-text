After an overly long period of inactivity, (iov.
Edmund Brown Jr. has finally recognized the seriousness
of the state's medical malpractice crisis. His call for a
special session of the state legislature to try to work out
some solutions to this problem is an admirable, if belated,
step.
Some of Brown's proposals, including the
establishment of a state malpractice commission to
examine the possibility of fixing limits on the amount of
damages that malpractice victims can collect, seem to
touch on the crucial problems of this complicated issue.
We urge the legislature to give serious consideration to
this proposal, as well as other Brown suggestions that call
for the reevaluation of the role of lawyers (who
traditionally have collected half the damages) and for
regular eximination of doctors to ensure they are
qualified.
Even though the current strike of anesthesiologists and
surgeons over the malpractice issue may be damaging to
local hospitals, we must reaffirm the right of doctors to
strike just as any other employee has the right to leave
his job to protest working conditions. The option to
strike is a matter of personal rights which should be left
to the judgment of each doctor. It is an option that all
doctors, whether they practice privately or work for a
government hospital or agency, should always be free to
exercise. And the fact that this current strike has been a
major factor in motivating state officials to act on the
long-standing malpractice problem shows that doctors,
like all other workers, can use the strike to effectively
point out grievances.
