# Israel Maligned
##

Mark Licker

An amazing thing happened
at last Tuesday's demonstration
at the Board of Trustees
meeting. A speaker from the
Revolutionary Students' Brigade
(not the Alliance for Radical
Change), listing areas where
struggles for self-determination
and anti-imperialism continue,
mentioned Indochina, Latin
America, and "Palestine."
I can only surmise that he
used the British colonial name
for what is now Israel to deny its
legitimacy as an independent
Jewish state. This occurred at a
rally of Stanford students,
regardless of nationality, who
oppose doing business with the
Shah of Iran and who demand a
sense of moral responsibility on
the part of the University.
The remarkable fact, alas, is
not the anti-Israel reference.
Some of the radical left has
never been radical at all,
claiming that Israel is repressive
and imperialist because it
defends itself against the threat
of destruction.
The unexpected twist in this
episode is that the remark went
unchallenged, at the rally and in
later commentary. People who
differ in their thinking can agree
to put aside differences in
support of a common cause.
But they will not do so at the
expense of other, equally
important, issues. Those who see
the crucial difference between
the Shah's brutal,
American-installed regime and
the democratic socialist
government in Jerusalem may
have felt hesitant to draw

attention away from the
purposes of the protest.
It is awkward to break the
coalition, and possibly weaken
its effectiveness.
Actually, it is the
Revolutionary Student Brigade
which, by its implicit denial of
Israel's right to exist, is
responsible for diverting
attention from the issues at
hand. They characterize some
University policies as part of an
oppressive economic and
political system. Agreed. But if
they think that the elimination
of Israel would constitute a blow
against capitalist imperialism or
a victory for humanity, I part
company from them now.
I will continue to fight for a
change of Stanford's policy of
moral "neutrality" on research,
and to support its recognition of
social responsibility. Economic
exploitation and U.S.
imperialism will continue to
receive my attention. I will not,
however, lend support to any
group which does noi recognize
Israel.
My position is not
ethnocentric or reactionary. It is
simply a recognition of the fact
that anyone who, as David
Halberstam wrote of Henry
Kissinger, "can find no
difference between the viability
and legitimacy of the Saigon
|Thieu| government and that of
the Israelis" has an equally poor
perception of the world. Such
distorted vision is the radicalism
of fools.

moral "neutrality" on research,
and to support its recognition of
social responsibility. Economic
exploitation and U.S.
imperialism will continue to
receive my attention. I will not,
however, lend support to any
group which does noi recognize
Israel.
My position is not
ethnocentric or reactionary. It is
simply a recognition of the fact
that anyone who, as David
Halberstam wrote of Henry
Kissinger, "can find no
difference between the viability
and legitimacy of the Saigon
|Thieu| government and that of
the Israelis" has an equally poor
perception of the world. Such
distorted vision is the radicalism
of fools.

An amazing thing happened
at last Tuesday's demonstration
at the Board of Trustees
meeting. A speaker from the
Revolutionary Students' Brigade
(not the Alliance for Radical
Change), listing areas where
struggles for self-determination
and anti-imperialism continue,
mentioned Indochina, Latin
America, and "Palestine."
I can only surmise that he
used the British colonial name
for what is now Israel to deny its
legitimacy as an independent
Jewish state. This occurred at a
rally of Stanford students,
regardless of nationality, who
oppose doing business with the
Shah of Iran and who demand a
sense of moral responsibility on
the part of the University.
The remarkable fact, alas, is
not the anti-Israel reference.
Some of the radical left has
never been radical at all,
claiming that Israel is repressive
and imperialist because it
defends itself against the threat
of destruction.
The unexpected twist in this
episode is that the remark went
unchallenged, at the rally and in
later commentary. People who
differ in their thinking can agree
to put aside differences in
support of a common cause.
But they will not do so at the
expense of other, equally
important, issues. Those who see
the crucial difference between
the Shah's brutal,
American-installed regime and
the democratic socialist
government in Jerusalem may
have felt hesitant to draw

attention away from the
purposes of the protest.
It is awkward to break the
coalition, and possibly weaken
its effectiveness.
Actually, it is the
Revolutionary Student Brigade
which, by its implicit denial of
Israel's right to exist, is
responsible for diverting
attention from the issues at
hand. They characterize some
University policies as part of an
oppressive economic and
political system. Agreed. But if
they think that the elimination
of Israel would constitute a blow
against capitalist imperialism or
a victory for humanity, I part
company from them now.
I will continue to fight for a
change of Stanford's policy of
moral "neutrality" on research,
and to support its recognition of
social responsibility. Economic
exploitation and U.S.
imperialism will continue to
receive my attention. I will not,
however, lend support to any
