£ As of April 30, violence in Indochina was
a past horror for Americans.
only two weeks later, U.S. military
"forces sank three Cambodian gunboats,
! invaded Koh Tang, and bombed an airfield
tfnear Cambodia's main port city. What
Lhappened?
* On May 14, a Cambodian gunboat seized
j the U.S. merchant ship Mayageuz and held
its 40-member crew prisoner. At the time of
| seizure the Mayaguez was sailing eight miles
!* off of Koh Tang.
)' The Cambodian government claims a
■' territorial water limit of 12 miles, and so
felt justified in its act of holding the
* Mayaguez. However, the U.S. only
recognizes a three-mile territorial water
limit.
Warning Was Given
In recent weeks, the Cambodian
government, in defending these waters,
seized a Thai fishing boat, held a
Panamanian vessel for 36 hours, and fired
* upon a South Korean vessel. Presidential
Press Secretary Ron Nessen admitted that
the United States had knowledge of the
Cambodian actions three days prior to the
Mayaguez capture. It is surprising the U.S.
government was outraged when it showed
negligence in notifying American ships of
i the danger of capture.

Disputes such as these involving
territorial waters are usually dealt with
through international channels. The U.S.
government made a token effort in this
direction by contacting the People's
Republic of China.
The U.S. waited only two days for a
response and did not consult the United
Nations until after sinking the three
Cambodian ships. Congress was also not
consulted prior to these acts though
required to do so by the 1973 War Powers
Act.
Thai Objections
The Thai government, the sole U.S. ally
in Indochina, objected strongly to the use
of its bases for military actions against
Cambodia. It threatened that unless the
1100 marines flown into Thailand were
removed immediately, relations between the
countries would "be exposed to serious and
damaging consequences."
The U.S. government claims to have
acted to save U.S. lives. It is interesting to
note that there was an acknowledged
possibility that the 40 crew members of the
Mayaguez were aboard the gunboats at the
time they were bombed.
We know now that one marine died and
a number are missing as a result of the later
invasion of Koh Tang island. The San

Brown, et 01.
Francisco Chronicle's May 15 comment that
"Kissinger wanted a quick and punishing
strike even if the crew was put in danger"
mustmake us question the U.S.government's
intentions.
Message Ignored
Ironically, the Cambodian official radio
announced that they were going to "evict"
the Mayaguez from their water at the same
time Nessen announced the ordering of the
attack to retake the ship. The Cambodian
message was ignored.
Perhaps the real reason the U.S.
government responded to the seizure
militarily after responding to the Piicblo
incident and other seizures diplomatically is
summed up by Rep. Walter F'lowers
(D-Ala.). "I think it was needed. We've got
to prove to the world we're not a paper
tiger."
The United States chose to enhance our
prestige even at the expense of U.S. and
Cambodian lives.
We must continue to question how we as
American people benefit from U.S. prestige
and whether an increase in such prestige,
derived from military power, is worth the
death and injustice used to build it.
