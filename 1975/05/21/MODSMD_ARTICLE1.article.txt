# University Actions Irk Prof. Brown

### STEPHEN WALT 
Religious Studies Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown emphasized yesterday
that his decision to accept a half-time
position at the Pacific School of
Religion (PSR) was based on "more
than just dissatisfaction with
Stanford."
Appearing on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Brown spoke of his need
"to be openly identified with the
ecumenical community" as being a
prime factor in his acceptance of the
PSR post and concomitant reduction
of duties at Stanford.
Currently he plans to teach fulltime
at PSR in the fall, divide his time
between Stanford and PSR during
winter quarter, and teach fulltime at
Stanford during the spring.
While the possibility of leaving
Stanford has been on his mind for
some time, Brown again stated that
the University's refusal to grant tenure
to Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish was the "catalyst" for his
decision to consider other posts.
He and the University have
"different priorities," which became
widely disparate in the Irish case,
Brown said.
Sources Of Friction
Brown also cited alleged lack of
emphasis here on world problems and
threatened cutbacks in SWOPSI and
SCIRE as sources of friction between
himself and the University.
Brown claimed a professional and
personal desire to see Irish on the
faculty. He said that when it became
clear that the University was not going
to grant Irish tenure, he found it
necessary for his own sake to seek an
atmosphere more conducive to his
priorities and desires.
In a prepared statement read during
the broadcast, Brown said he "had
never regretted" his original decision
to come to Stanford. The University
"has always supported me fully" in his
campaigns for various social and
political causes, he said.
Feels 'Restless'
Although grateful for this support,
he said he felt a "restlessness about
teaching here," and being separated
from direct involvement with the
religious community. This restlessness,
coupled with his increasing
disagreement with the emphases of the
University, formed the basis of his
decision.
Brown admitted that he found
accusations that his departure was a
cop-out "difficult" and of great
concern to him.
However, he considered his
presence to be less than essential in
both the University and the Religious
Studies Department, and expressed
confidence that his departure will not
greatly compromise religious
academics at Stanford.
Brown, however, feared that the
tenure climate here and elsewhere was
causing University faculties to become
"too locked in" and that young
scholars had little or no chance of
finding permanent positions.
He said that after Irish's dismissal
became certain, the Religious Studies
Department received at least 100
applications to fill the post.
He praised the "early retirement"
proposals here as a means to allow
younger researchers the opportunity
to obtain positions, and noted that he
had asked for a one-year tenureless
contract at PSR.
He further said that he hoped more
student input could be instituted in

the tenure decisions, and that a
scholar's productivity could be
evaluated by persons having 'some
expertise in the field of study under
consideration.
Student Activism
Turning to the current upsurge in
student activism after the calm of
recent- years, Brown cited Columbae
House as a source of individuals
committed to social change.
Brown gave a quick overview of the
state of religious activity at Stanford
during his 13 years here. He spoke of
the enormous interest in Vatican II at
the time of his arrival, the popularity
of Asian beliefs during the late 1960s
and the present upsurge of what he
called "evangelical Protestantism." He
said that the variety of religious beliefs
here has made Religious Studies "a
very exciting place to be."
