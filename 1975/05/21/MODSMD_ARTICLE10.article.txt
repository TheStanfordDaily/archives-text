# Research Guidelines Are Rigid
##

Robert Rosenzweig, the University's
vice-president for public affairs, watched
protesters file out of the Old Union last
week and commented, "I doubt if many
students involved understand that the
president and the Board of Trustees can't
do something if University policies prohibit
it."
As long as University officials respond to
debate over controversial issues by rattling
the chains that bind them to rigid policies,
it's hard to be optimistic about change.
In this case, the issue is a multi-million
dollar contract to develop a satellite
communications system, designed for the
dissemination of education and health
services in rural areas of Iran. But contract
opponents fear that the technology will aid
the spread of official propaganda.
The distance between these two
convictions is caused partly by the physical
distance between Stanford and Iran.
Chief researchers on the contract,
including Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan and Communication Prof. Edwin
Parker, visited Iran last year, as guests of the
Shah's government. They feel their
observations justify their view of the
contract's purpose.
Oppressive Tactics
But contract protesters base their
arguments on seemingly reliable reports
from journalists inside Iran, documenting
oppressive tactics used by the regime.
Unable or unwilling to find out who is
right, the University can do nothing but
cling to its Statement of Principles
Concerning Research, adopted by the
Faculty Senate in December 1971.
These principles essentially leave

decisions about the acceptability of research
contracts to the "judgment and conscience"
of the individual researcher.
Only one restriction is placed on
academic freedom; it does not include the
right to keep a secret. But so long as
research is publishable, "the individual
scholar should be free to select the subject
matter of his research, to seek support from
any source for his work, and to form his
own findings and conclusions," the
guidelines stipulate.

Once the researcher's decision is made,
the University "should allocate space,
facilities, funds and other resources for
research programs, based on the scholarly
and educational merits of the proposed
research and not on speculations concerning
the political or moral impropriety of the
uses which might be made of its results,"
according to the statement.
Easy Bucks
Does this mean that Stanford's scarce
resources will be made available to whatever
group can entice a research grantsman?
"Parker decided to play a long shot
chance that what he is doing will have more
benefits than problems," says Tim Haight, a
communication graduate student and

opponent of the contract. "But there is a
real possibility that this will increase
oppression. It's so expensive to find out
that the University's research policy
encourages researchers to take the easy
bucks."
Vice Provost for Research William F.
Massy, one of the most candid
administrators I have contacted, is in charge
of administering the research policy
guidelines. And even he has trouble
answering that question and others like it.
Offering a hypothetical example, 1 once
asked Massy how the policy guidelines
would be applied in the following situation:
suppose than an apartheid government
soughi out a prominent Nobel Prize winning
Stanford researcher, known among other
things for his work on inherent racial
differences. Suppose further that this
government offered to contract for research
that would provide genetic evidence in
support of apartheid policies.
Massy agreed that under strict adherence
to the guidelines, such a contract could not
be contested.
Nor can the contract with the Iranian
government. It seems to me that
administrators who "can't do something if
University policies prohibit it" are hiding
behind a frail barrier.
The policy guidelines form a barbed wire
around the area of academic freedom. But
potential grenades like the Iranian contract
can too easily slip by the barricade without
adequate scrutiny. Someday, one of the
grenades is bound to explode.
