# Incompetence Fouls Up Commencement
## Glenn Garvin 
### 
"We'd like to bring back to
the seniors the kind of attention
they got when they were
freshmen."
—Lise Pfeiffer
(during campaign for
senior class president
May, 1974)
"You know, I wish you
wouldn't keep focusing
attention on commencement
and making an issue out of it,"
Tom Bacchetti, public events
director, told a caller last week.
"If this keeps up, I'm afraid
many seniors are going to go
into the ceremony with a
negative attitude."
Bacchetti's statement is
typical of the administration's
view of the current flap over
commencement. Administrators

altered the nature of
commencement without asking
students what they thought
about it, kept the alteration a
secret for five months, and spent
most of their time writing letters
to the Daily complaining about
editorials that accused them of
arrogance.
Now they complain that
students who protest the new
commencement format are
fomenting a negative attitude.
Apparently it's never occurred
to them that they made the
changes that are producing the
negative response.
Busy Work
Likewise, Senior Class
President Lise Pfeiffer has been
too busy sending everyone
invitations to join the Alumni
Association to help seniors

protest the commencement
change.
Of course, seniors who
thought Pfeiffer had something
else in mind when she talked
about "bringing back attention"
shouldn't be too hard on her.
After all, she did compose a nice
letter of apology after Daniel
Patrick Moynihan was named
commencement speaker.
Unfortunately, the fact that
Pfeiffer is sorry she didn't
bother to ask anyone about the
Moynihan selection won't help
the people who have to sit
through his speech. Half the
class thinks he's a racist, and the
other half thinks he's boring
beyond belief.
As seniors fight a losing battle
against sleep through
Moynihan's speech and the

endless list of names as every
single diploma-winner in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences troops past the podium,
they can take comfort in the
knowledge that Pfeiffer
"sincerely regrets" it all.
Perverse Logic
They may also wile away
the hours marveling over the
logic of University Vice
President Robert Rosenzweig,
who assured complaining seniors
earlier this week that he didn't
consult them because "it's never
been a matter on which students
have been consulted in the
past." And just think: he can
apply this same incisive analysis
next year, too. Administrators
can go on never consulting seniors
about commencement for all
eternity, using the defense that
they've never consulted them
before.
Perhaps Rosenzweig and
Bacchetti are right when they
say no other decision was
feasible — although their math
rivals the most torturous physics
class in complexity. Rosenzweig
maintains the University is
saving $10,000 with the new
commencement plans — $6500
for chair rental and set-up, and
$3500 in sound system rental
fees. Bacchetti says the saving is
between $7000 and $7500 for
chairs and $2500 in "related
expenses."
But Bacchetti also said it cost
65 cents to rent one chair, and
$300 per location to set up and
take down the chairs. Last year,
he said, the University provided
about 5300 chairs for the
various H&S departmental
ceremonies, spread through eight
locations. That only figures out
to a $5900 saving.
Kick In The Ass
It's rather sad. when you
think about it: if the University
can save $5900 by sending the
class of 1975 out into the world
with a kick in the ass instead of
a nicer gesture, it will do it. Is
that the "Stanford experience"
they told us about in
Approaching Stanford?
The worst of it is that they
didn't even give the senior class a
chance to propose anything else.
Maybe the University is right;
maybe no one would have been
willing to set up chairs on a

volunteer basis. Of course, we'll
never really know this way.
It might still be possible to
spare the Class of '76 some of
this. Rosenzweig has made it
clear that the University
considers students little more
than passive children as far as
commencement goes. But maybe
he'll listen to Mommy and
Daddy.
So if you don't feel so
disgusted you want to forget the
whole thing you might ask your
parents to drop him a line and
tell him what a stupid decision it
is. After all, they're adults, and
you're not — which must say
something about the value of a
Stanford degree.
For the class of '75, though,
it's too late. Enjoy yourself as
you bake in Frost, kids. And
think kind thoughts about all
the people who made it all
possible.

letter of apology after Daniel
Patrick Moynihan was named
commencement speaker.
Unfortunately, the fact that
Pfeiffer is sorry she didn't
bother to ask anyone about the
Moynihan selection won't help
the people who have to sit
through his speech. Half the
class thinks he's a racist, and the
other half thinks he's boring
beyond belief.
As seniors fight a losing battle
against sleep through
Moynihan's speech and the

endless list of names as every
single diploma-winner in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences troops past the podium,
they can take comfort in the
knowledge that Pfeiffer
"sincerely regrets" it all.
Perverse Logic
They may also wile away
the hours marveling over the
logic of University Vice
President Robert Rosenzweig,
who assured complaining seniors
earlier this week that he didn't
consult them because "it's never
been a matter on which students
have been consulted in the
past." And just think: he can
apply this same incisive analysis
next year, too. Administrators
can go on never consulting seniors
about commencement for all
eternity, using the defense that
they've never consulted them
before.
Perhaps Rosenzweig and
Bacchetti are right when they
say no other decision was
feasible — although their math
rivals the most torturous physics
class in complexity. Rosenzweig
maintains the University is
saving $10,000 with the new
commencement plans — $6500
for chair rental and set-up, and
$3500 in sound system rental
fees. Bacchetti says the saving is
between $7000 and $7500 for
chairs and $2500 in "related
expenses."
But Bacchetti also said it cost
65 cents to rent one chair, and
$300 per location to set up and
take down the chairs. Last year,
he said, the University provided
about 5300 chairs for the
various H&S departmental
ceremonies, spread through eight
locations. That only figures out
to a $5900 saving.
Kick In The Ass
It's rather sad. when you
think about it: if the University
can save $5900 by sending the
class of 1975 out into the world
with a kick in the ass instead of
a nicer gesture, it will do it. Is
that the "Stanford experience"
they told us about in
Approaching Stanford?
The worst of it is that they
didn't even give the senior class a
chance to propose anything else.
Maybe the University is right;
maybe no one would have been
willing to set up chairs on a

volunteer basis. Of course, we'll
never really know this way.
It might still be possible to
spare the Class of '76 some of
this. Rosenzweig has made it
clear that the University
considers students little more
than passive children as far as
commencement goes. But maybe
he'll listen to Mommy and
Daddy.
So if you don't feel so
disgusted you want to forget the
whole thing you might ask your
parents to drop him a line and
tell him what a stupid decision it
is. After all, they're adults, and
you're not — which must say
something about the value of a
Stanford degree.
For the class of '75, though,
it's too late. Enjoy yourself as
you bake in Frost, kids. And
think kind thoughts about all
the people who made it all
possible.

for chair rental and set-up, and
$3500 in sound system rental
fees. Bacchetti says the saving is
between $7000 and $7500 for
chairs and $2500 in "related
expenses."
But Bacchetti also said it cost
65 cents to rent one chair, and
$300 per location to set up and
take down the chairs. Last year,
he said, the University provided
about 5300 chairs for the
various H&S departmental
ceremonies, spread through eight
locations. That only figures out
to a $5900 saving.
Kick In The Ass
It's rather sad. when you
think about it: if the University
can save $5900 by sending the
class of 1975 out into the world
with a kick in the ass instead of
a nicer gesture, it will do it. Is
that the "Stanford experience"
they told us about in
Approaching Stanford?
The worst of it is that they
didn't even give the senior class a
chance to propose anything else.
Maybe the University is right;
maybe no one would have been
willing to set up chairs on a

volunteer basis. Of course, we'll
never really know this way.
It might still be possible to
spare the Class of '76 some of
this. Rosenzweig has made it
clear that the University
considers students little more
than passive children as far as
commencement goes. But maybe
he'll listen to Mommy and
Daddy.
So if you don't feel so
disgusted you want to forget the
whole thing you might ask your
parents to drop him a line and
tell him what a stupid decision it
is. After all, they're adults, and
you're not — which must say
something about the value of a
Stanford degree.
For the class of '75, though,
it's too late. Enjoy yourself as
you bake in Frost, kids. And
think kind thoughts about all
the people who made it all
possible.

"We'd like to bring back to
the seniors the kind of attention
they got when they were
freshmen."
—Lise Pfeiffer
(during campaign for
senior class president
May, 1974)
"You know, I wish you
wouldn't keep focusing
attention on commencement
and making an issue out of it,"
Tom Bacchetti, public events
director, told a caller last week.
"If this keeps up, I'm afraid
many seniors are going to go
into the ceremony with a
negative attitude."
Bacchetti's statement is
typical of the administration's
view of the current flap over
commencement. Administrators

altered the nature of
commencement without asking
students what they thought
about it, kept the alteration a
secret for five months, and spent
most of their time writing letters
to the Daily complaining about
editorials that accused them of
arrogance.
Now they complain that
students who protest the new
commencement format are
fomenting a negative attitude.
Apparently it's never occurred
to them that they made the
changes that are producing the
negative response.
Busy Work
Likewise, Senior Class
President Lise Pfeiffer has been
too busy sending everyone
invitations to join the Alumni
Association to help seniors

protest the commencement
change.
Of course, seniors who
thought Pfeiffer had something
else in mind when she talked
about "bringing back attention"
shouldn't be too hard on her.
After all, she did compose a nice
letter of apology after Daniel
Patrick Moynihan was named
commencement speaker.
Unfortunately, the fact that
Pfeiffer is sorry she didn't
bother to ask anyone about the
Moynihan selection won't help
the people who have to sit
through his speech. Half the
class thinks he's a racist, and the
other half thinks he's boring
beyond belief.
As seniors fight a losing battle
against sleep through
Moynihan's speech and the

endless list of names as every
single diploma-winner in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences troops past the podium,
they can take comfort in the
knowledge that Pfeiffer
"sincerely regrets" it all.
Perverse Logic
They may also wile away
the hours marveling over the
logic of University Vice
President Robert Rosenzweig,
who assured complaining seniors
earlier this week that he didn't
consult them because "it's never
been a matter on which students
have been consulted in the
past." And just think: he can
apply this same incisive analysis
next year, too. Administrators
can go on never consulting seniors
about commencement for all
eternity, using the defense that
they've never consulted them
before.
Perhaps Rosenzweig and
Bacchetti are right when they
say no other decision was
feasible — although their math
rivals the most torturous physics
class in complexity. Rosenzweig
maintains the University is
saving $10,000 with the new
commencement plans — $6500
for chair rental and set-up, and
$3500 in sound system rental
fees. Bacchetti says the saving is
between $7000 and $7500 for
chairs and $2500 in "related
expenses."
But Bacchetti also said it cost
65 cents to rent one chair, and
$300 per location to set up and
