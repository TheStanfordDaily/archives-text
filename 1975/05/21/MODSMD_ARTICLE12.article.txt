Confusion On Lecturers
Editor:
I wish to correct a number of
misunderstandings created by
the May 19 Daily article on the
French and Italian lecturers. As
a preamble, let me note that two
telephone conversations during
which I spoke for nearly one
hour on some highly technical
points were summarized in a few
sentences.
The statement that "a form
of tenure" is going to be offered
beginning next fall, is the
Daily's interpretation of what 1
said. I constantly referred to
"continuing employment," and
the word "tenure" was brought
in only to explain what
continuing employment is not.
Discontinuation of someone
who enjoys tenure requires that
the program as a whole be
terminated, discontinuation of
someone who enjoys continuing
employment requires only that
the position be terminated as a
result of, say, a decline in the
number of students.
I did not say that "a lecturer
will have a status comparable to
that of an assistant professor." I
did say that, under the new
rules, a lecturer will be able to
look forward to possible
promotion to senior lecturer,
just as an assistant professor can
look forward to possible
promotion to associate
professor.
1 did not say or imply that
rights and privileges which go
with the position of assistant
professor will be extended to
lecturers.
I did not say that "four
extended contracts will be
offered next year." I did say
that up to four such positions
will be considered by a
committee appointed by the
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences.
All current lecturers will be
able to compete for these
positions and for any open
teaching position in the
department.
I have tried to make clear
that those lecturers who are not
appointed to senior
lectureships (and thereby a
continuing appointment), will be
given non-terminal one-year
contracts. At this time it is
difficult to predict very far into
the future precisely what the
teaching needs and the financial
situation in the department will
be.

Chairman, Department
of French and Italian
No Comment
Editor:
We, the French lecturers,
were disconcerted to see an
article entitled "French, Italian
lecturers dispute contract
format" in the May 19 Daily,
since none of us was
interviewed. Contract
negotiations are under discussion
so this would hardly be the
proper time to comment.
We are satisfied that our
chairman is making every effort
to protect our interests.
