## Professor And Trustee: Two Men, Two Views Specialization: 'Too High A Price' 
### CECILE HEROLD 
The Stanford Bookstore has
something in common with
supermarkets all over the nation:
the checkout counter magazine
racks that invite shoppers to
browse while waiting in line.
Although the National
Enquirer is nowhere in sight, the
booklets range from creative
writing and poetry works, to
non-fictional essays and research
papers, to science fiction stories
and guides to Stanford, to one
thin, inconspicuous brown
booklet headed with the title
World Affairs Report.
The editor of this
publication, Prof. Ronald
Hilton, has been a Stanford
faculty member since 1941. He
is currently a senior fellow in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences and teaches in the
Department of Spanish and
Portuguese. Hilton says each
quarterly issue of the World
Affairs Report examines the
Soviets' role in the world,
particularly as related to the
United States.
Preparing the small but
information4oaded book is
an ongoing task for Hilton
because it requires daily sifting
through American and foreign
newspapers and immediately
checking and re-checking with
specialists for facts.
'Changing Forces'
Hilton emphasizes that
readers cannot rely on just one
American newspaper to give
them adequate coverage of all
global events. "Even when
considering the New York Times
you find that the paper hits the
highlights well, but if a country
isn't making the headlines, it
virtually disappears," Hilton
notes. "During this time of
disappearance, quiet but
significant changing forces are
still at work."
Hilton will speak on "All the
News That's Fit to Print" in the
Undergraduate Library Forum
Room this Wednesday at 4:15
p.m. According to a lecture
advertisement, Hilton plans to
"provide information hitherto
unavailable about the Kremlin's
campaign against Stanford's
commencement speaker, Daniel
Moynihan."
Hilton says he is appalled at
the average American's lack of
understanding of global news,
especially of events in the Soviet
Union. He believes the ignorance
is caused by wishful thinking or
an unwillingness to devote time
to reading news each day,

aggravated by the inability to
understand foreign languages.
A Question Of Meaning
Language, Hilton stresses, is a
pivotal point in comprehending
international events. "It's a
question of lexicography — the
meaning of words," Hilton says.
"I'm very dissatisfied with the
University structure which
separates language teaching from
international studies."
Hilton notes other University
arrangements which he considers
unsatisfactory'.
"First, there is a great
tendency for faculty to
specialize in one particular
subject," Hilton says. "Outside
of it, they've practically
withered. Specialization carries
too high a price because events
in fields quite different from
yours will often impinge upon it.
You need to understand these
effects and their sources."
Secondly, Hilton opposes the
system of mass lecture
instruction. "It results in a direct
feeding of facts which are soon
forgotten. If students must
hysterically take notes in any
haphazard style and then scrawl
out final examination essays,
they will never achieve
professional excellence," he
says.
Travel Literature Study
In answer to these structural
defects, the British-born
professor teaches an
Undergraduate Special seminar,
"The World as Seen Through
Travel Literature" and a similar
U.S. course called, "Europe and
the World."
By "travel literature," Hilton
is not referring to pamphlets
picturing Palm Springs or
Mediterranean boat cruises.
"Travel literature is perhaps one
of the most important and least
known of the literature genres,"
Hilton explains. "It is the study
of how an individual or society
forms an image of another
culture at a given time in
history. If you realize how
complex this is, you begin to
understand that travel is actually
a skill. The perspectives it brings
are a matter of life and death
since 'war is formed in the minds
of men.' "
In both seminar classes, each
student writes chapter-by
chapter analysis of a self-chosen
travel literature book. Hilton has
taught the course for about nine
years, and he estimates that 300
to 400 such book analyses are
now on file in the University
archives. "Meanwhile, students

have learned to read, write and
do thorough library' research,"
he says.
Hilton leads the class with
enthusiasm because he himself
loves to travel. At the age of 12,
he began annual visits to France,
living with French families for
several months.
Today, his History Corner
office is decorated with world
maps and a large collection of
12th-century Peruvian statues
called huacos.
Perhaps the most noticeable
of Hilton's global souvenirs is a
walled arrangement of 70 black
and white photographs featuring
authors, scholars and writers
whom Hilton has met through
work and travels. No doubt the
new visitor might mistake
Hilton's office as Stanford's
answer to the Hall of Fame.
At a typical "travel
literature" session, Hilton wears
a light gray suit, with a starched
white hankerchief in his
right-front pocket. He may be
the last professor on campus
who warns students on the
opening day of class, "Anyone
caught chewing gum in this
room will be expelled from
humanity."

hysterically take notes in any
haphazard style and then scrawl
out final examination essays,
they will never achieve
professional excellence," he
says.
Travel Literature Study
In answer to these structural
defects, the British-born
professor teaches an
Undergraduate Special seminar,
"The World as Seen Through
Travel Literature" and a similar
U.S. course called, "Europe and
the World."
By "travel literature," Hilton
is not referring to pamphlets
picturing Palm Springs or
Mediterranean boat cruises.
"Travel literature is perhaps one
of the most important and least
known of the literature genres,"
Hilton explains. "It is the study
of how an individual or society
forms an image of another
culture at a given time in
history. If you realize how
complex this is, you begin to
understand that travel is actually
a skill. The perspectives it brings
are a matter of life and death
since 'war is formed in the minds
of men.' "
In both seminar classes, each
student writes chapter-by
chapter analysis of a self-chosen
travel literature book. Hilton has
taught the course for about nine
years, and he estimates that 300
to 400 such book analyses are
now on file in the University
archives. "Meanwhile, students

have learned to read, write and
do thorough library' research,"
he says.
Hilton leads the class with
enthusiasm because he himself
loves to travel. At the age of 12,
he began annual visits to France,
living with French families for
several months.
Today, his History Corner
office is decorated with world
maps and a large collection of
12th-century Peruvian statues
called huacos.
Perhaps the most noticeable
of Hilton's global souvenirs is a
walled arrangement of 70 black
and white photographs featuring
authors, scholars and writers
whom Hilton has met through
work and travels. No doubt the
new visitor might mistake
Hilton's office as Stanford's
answer to the Hall of Fame.
At a typical "travel
literature" session, Hilton wears
a light gray suit, with a starched
white hankerchief in his
right-front pocket. He may be
the last professor on campus
who warns students on the
opening day of class, "Anyone
caught chewing gum in this
room will be expelled from
humanity."

A PROFESSOR'S VIEW-Ronald Hilton shares the world with his students through travel literature.
In his History Corner office he collects momentos of his travels. Behind him are replicas of Peruvian
stautettes, as fashioned by the Incas and the Nazcas.
The Stanford Bookstore has
something in common with
supermarkets all over the nation:
the checkout counter magazine
racks that invite shoppers to
browse while waiting in line.
Although the National
Enquirer is nowhere in sight, the
booklets range from creative
writing and poetry works, to
non-fictional essays and research
papers, to science fiction stories
and guides to Stanford, to one
thin, inconspicuous brown
booklet headed with the title
World Affairs Report.
The editor of this
publication, Prof. Ronald
Hilton, has been a Stanford
faculty member since 1941. He
is currently a senior fellow in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences and teaches in the
Department of Spanish and
Portuguese. Hilton says each
quarterly issue of the World
Affairs Report examines the
Soviets' role in the world,
particularly as related to the
United States.
Preparing the small but
information4oaded book is
an ongoing task for Hilton
because it requires daily sifting
through American and foreign
newspapers and immediately
checking and re-checking with
specialists for facts.
'Changing Forces'
Hilton emphasizes that
readers cannot rely on just one
American newspaper to give
them adequate coverage of all
global events. "Even when
considering the New York Times
you find that the paper hits the
highlights well, but if a country
isn't making the headlines, it
virtually disappears," Hilton
notes. "During this time of
disappearance, quiet but
significant changing forces are
still at work."
Hilton will speak on "All the
News That's Fit to Print" in the
Undergraduate Library Forum
Room this Wednesday at 4:15
p.m. According to a lecture
advertisement, Hilton plans to
"provide information hitherto
unavailable about the Kremlin's
campaign against Stanford's
commencement speaker, Daniel
Moynihan."
Hilton says he is appalled at
the average American's lack of
understanding of global news,
especially of events in the Soviet
Union. He believes the ignorance
is caused by wishful thinking or
an unwillingness to devote time
to reading news each day,

aggravated by the inability to
understand foreign languages.
A Question Of Meaning
Language, Hilton stresses, is a
pivotal point in comprehending
international events. "It's a
question of lexicography — the
meaning of words," Hilton says.
"I'm very dissatisfied with the
University structure which
separates language teaching from
international studies."
Hilton notes other University
arrangements which he considers
unsatisfactory'.
"First, there is a great
tendency for faculty to
specialize in one particular
subject," Hilton says. "Outside
of it, they've practically
withered. Specialization carries
too high a price because events
in fields quite different from
yours will often impinge upon it.
You need to understand these
effects and their sources."
Secondly, Hilton opposes the
system of mass lecture
instruction. "It results in a direct
feeding of facts which are soon
forgotten. If students must
hysterically take notes in any
haphazard style and then scrawl
out final examination essays,
they will never achieve
professional excellence," he

Enquirer is nowhere in sight, the
booklets range from creative
writing and poetry works, to
non-fictional essays and research
papers, to science fiction stories
and guides to Stanford, to one
thin, inconspicuous brown
booklet headed with the title
World Affairs Report.
The editor of this
publication, Prof. Ronald
Hilton, has been a Stanford
faculty member since 1941. He
is currently a senior fellow in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences and teaches in the
Department of Spanish and
Portuguese. Hilton says each
quarterly issue of the World
Affairs Report examines the
Soviets' role in the world,
particularly as related to the
United States.
Preparing the small but
information4oaded book is
an ongoing task for Hilton
because it requires daily sifting
through American and foreign
newspapers and immediately
checking and re-checking with
specialists for facts.
'Changing Forces'
Hilton emphasizes that
readers cannot rely on just one
American newspaper to give
them adequate coverage of all
global events. "Even when
considering the New York Times
you find that the paper hits the
highlights well, but if a country
isn't making the headlines, it
virtually disappears," Hilton
notes. "During this time of
disappearance, quiet but
significant changing forces are
still at work."
Hilton will speak on "All the
News That's Fit to Print" in the
Undergraduate Library Forum
Room this Wednesday at 4:15
p.m. According to a lecture
advertisement, Hilton plans to
"provide information hitherto
unavailable about the Kremlin's
campaign against Stanford's
commencement speaker, Daniel
Moynihan."
Hilton says he is appalled at
the average American's lack of
understanding of global news,
especially of events in the Soviet
Union. He believes the ignorance
is caused by wishful thinking or
an unwillingness to devote time
to reading news each day,

aggravated by the inability to
understand foreign languages.
A Question Of Meaning
Language, Hilton stresses, is a
pivotal point in comprehending
international events. "It's a
question of lexicography — the
meaning of words," Hilton says.
"I'm very dissatisfied with the
University structure which
separates language teaching from
international studies."
Hilton notes other University
arrangements which he considers
unsatisfactory'.
"First, there is a great
tendency for faculty to
specialize in one particular
subject," Hilton says. "Outside
of it, they've practically
withered. Specialization carries
too high a price because events
in fields quite different from
yours will often impinge upon it.
You need to understand these
effects and their sources."
Secondly, Hilton opposes the
system of mass lecture
instruction. "It results in a direct
feeding of facts which are soon
forgotten. If students must
hysterically take notes in any
haphazard style and then scrawl
out final examination essays,
they will never achieve
professional excellence," he
says.
Travel Literature Study
In answer to these structural
defects, the British-born
professor teaches an
Undergraduate Special seminar,
"The World as Seen Through
Travel Literature" and a similar
U.S. course called, "Europe and
the World."
By "travel literature," Hilton
is not referring to pamphlets
picturing Palm Springs or
Mediterranean boat cruises.
"Travel literature is perhaps one
of the most important and least
known of the literature genres,"
Hilton explains. "It is the study
of how an individual or society
forms an image of another
culture at a given time in
history. If you realize how
complex this is, you begin to
understand that travel is actually
a skill. The perspectives it brings
are a matter of life and death
since 'war is formed in the minds
of men.' "
In both seminar classes, each
student writes chapter-by
chapter analysis of a self-chosen
travel literature book. Hilton has
taught the course for about nine
years, and he estimates that 300
to 400 such book analyses are
now on file in the University
archives. "Meanwhile, students

have learned to read, write and
do thorough library' research,"
he says.
Hilton leads the class with
enthusiasm because he himself
loves to travel. At the age of 12,
he began annual visits to France,
living with French families for
several months.
Today, his History Corner
office is decorated with world
maps and a large collection of
12th-century Peruvian statues
called huacos.
Perhaps the most noticeable
of Hilton's global souvenirs is a
walled arrangement of 70 black
and white photographs featuring
authors, scholars and writers
whom Hilton has met through
work and travels. No doubt the
new visitor might mistake
Hilton's office as Stanford's
answer to the Hall of Fame.
At a typical "travel
literature" session, Hilton wears
a light gray suit, with a starched
white hankerchief in his
right-front pocket. He may be
the last professor on campus
who warns students on the
opening day of class, "Anyone
caught chewing gum in this
room will be expelled from
humanity."
