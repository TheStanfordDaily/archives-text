# 'A Kind Of Mob Feeling Is Always A Little Scary9
## 
### RIDGELY OCHS 
W. Parmer Fuller 111,
vice-president of Pittsburg Plate
Glass Industries, Inc., nervously
rolls two pencils across his large
mahogany desk as he reminisces.
Talk turns to the aftermath
of a decision by the Stanford
Board of Trustees to sever
University ties with the Stanford
Research Institute in 1969,
amidst student protest that the
University create closer
supervisory ties to SRI.
He recalls two letters he
received:
"When the trustees
announced the SRI decision
after hours of soul searching,
consultation with lawyers and so
on, I got a letter from an
alumnus: 'Dear Mr. Fuller: This
is to let you know that I hold
you in the utmost contempt.
Having succumbed to student
wishes, I call for your
resignation.' In the same mail, I
got another letter: 'Dear Mr.
Fuller: This is to let you know
that I am disgusted with you.
Having failed to exceed student
wishes, I call for your
resignation.' "
The 62-year-old trustee, Class
of '34, throws his hands up in

the air and laughs.
"So 1 copied them boih and
sent the alumnus letter to the
student and the student letter to
the alumnus and wrote at the
bottom 'Isn't this a paradox?' "
Man In The Middle
Fuller was president of the
Board of Trustees from 1967 to
1971, the all-but-halcyon years
of violent student protest and
alumni backlash. Although
serving now as a regular member
of the board with only four or
five years to serve, he still
remembers the feeling of being
the man caught in the middle.
"It not only took thick skin,
but a little, a little nerve,
because several times during
those periods, when the fever
was at a high pitch, meetings
were barricaded and so on. A
kind of mob feeling is always a
little scary, you know . . .
"But in order to do anything,
you don't have to be thick
skinned, you have to give the
appearance of being thick
skinned. You can suffer
inwardly and I'm sure most of us
did."
Fuller has been a trustee since
1958, and was an avid University
fundraiser before being elected
to the board. Two of his three

children attended Stanford, and
the tradition runs deep in his
family background. Fuller's
father, W. Farmer Fuller, Jr., an
early Daily editor, was a trustee
for 25 years and also served as
board president.
Fuller says he still reads the
Daily every day."I come from a
Stanford family," he says."I can
get kind of sentimental about
the University, really."
Trustee Tasks
He speaks articulately about
the role of a trustee: "Above
selecting the president and being
involved in wry broad policy
matters, I really think that one
of the trustee's principal jobs is
to explain the University to the
outside community, to kind of
be the buffer between the
community and University, so
that the University, in its
traditional search for the truth,
is kept from undue influence
from the outside as a result of
financial pressures or whatever."
Fuller doesn't believe that a
trustee should be an advocate,
but should represent a broader,
"objective," perspective.
"I'm certainly not dumb
enough to think students are
satisfied with their role because I
know they aren't. I find it
extremely helpful to have the
students' input at committee
meetings, but I don't think they
should vote on their peers.
"Also — and I know this is a
sensitive issue, and 1 don't mean
to offend any student at all —
it's more difficult to find a
student representative of student
opinion than it is to find faculty
representative of faculty
opinion. The faculty has the
Academic Senate which does
represent it, whereas the ASSU
may or may not represent total
student opinion.
"There's a transient element
to'students, too. Within a four
year period, their opinions,
feelings about the way the
University should be run may go
through a complete reversal."
Although student attitudes
toward trustees may have
changed in the last three or four
years, Fuller is still somewhat
wary. During those years when
he was on campus often, he was
perhaps too much the "buffer"
between opposing and hostile
camps, too much the symbol of
all that was wrong with society
and the University. He rarely
visits Stanford now. He says,"I
didn't grow tired of it, just
tired."
