# Students Host Trustees
## 
### CHRIS VALADA 
While approximately 350
students protested against
University policies and actions
last week, some 21 were
discovering that Stanford's
trustees did indeed belong to
the human race.
As hosts for a program
conceived by Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, these
students each "took a trustee to
lunch" in student dorms, giving
the trustees an opportunity to
see how students live and hear
what students think.
At the same time the students
were given a chance to meet
with a "real live" trustee.
ASSU Vice President
Josephine Jaramillo and Fred
Glover, secretary to the
University, who both helped
arrange the student-trustee
meetings, voiced satisfaction
with the program's results.
"There have been unanimous
expressions of pleasure from the
trustees," said Glover.
Jaramillo said, "The lunches
were pretty much a plus. They
should continue. There is usually
no interaction between students
and the trustees, and this kind of
meeting gives the trustees a
better feeling for the campus."

TRUSTEES FOR LUNCH BUNCH—On the same day that more
than 200 students "roasted" the trustees on the lawn outside the
Stanford Center for Research and Development in Teaching
(SCRDT), a smaller group of students invited them into their
dorms and residences for lunch. Here, Sharon Percy Rockefeller,
one of the trustees, eats her meal and listens to students.
