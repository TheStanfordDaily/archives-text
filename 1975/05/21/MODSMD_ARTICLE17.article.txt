# Shultz Says Americans Don't Trust Leadership

### JEANETTE GERMAIN 
People have become so critical of American
leadership that "even Ralph Nader will be over
the hill" soon, Business Prof. George Shultz said
Tuesday.
Speaking to more than 200 people in
Tresidder, Shultz said that leaders in America
can't responsibly do their jobs because there are
too many people criticizing them.
The problem is not just one of leadership, but
one of "followership," the former treasury and
labor secretary said.
'Wealth Of People'
"We have a wealth of people who have ability,
who care, who are competent, who have flair and
drive," said Shultz.
But we also have a "lawsuit society," where
people will not compromise on small details and
will not trust leaders to make fair, competent

judgements, he said.
"We have cut up society into little pieces,"
passing laws and creating administrative offices
for every subject, he said. "We undermine" our
leadership with too many rules.
Shultz gave examples from the past to
illustrate the ambiguity people feel about
leadership today.
"We knew where we were" in international
affairs 10 years ago, he said. "We didn't have to
think about" what other countries felt about the
U.S.
Gas Crisis
"Nobody could lay a glove on us" before the
gas crisis, he said. But "then all of a sudden a few
people in countries most Americans never heard
of" made people in the U.S. change their way of
living, he said.
