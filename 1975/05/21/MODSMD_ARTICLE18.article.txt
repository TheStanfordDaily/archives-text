## Card Swordsmen Capture Year's Third Nor Cal Tide 
### 
The Stanford fencing team
concluded a highly successful
season Saturday, winning the
Northern California sabre
championships at UC Santa
Cruz. Last quarter, the team
won the Nor Cal foil and epee
titles, too, and Saturday's
victory made it a clean sweep for
the Cards.
Senior Dave Moyer tied for
fourth in the individual
competition over the weekend,
and Coach Jean Helliwell says
team captain Lee Vanderveld
and junior Christopher Burke
came in close behind — although
tournament sponsors have yet to
return final point tallies to the
competing schools.
In winter quarter's Nor Cal
foil meet, senior Jack Handy led
Stanford to its first place finish
by winning the individual

competition.
At the epee championships,
sophomore Steve Walt
performed a similar service for
the Cards by also finishing first
in the individual competition.
Walt's 17th place mark in
epee at the NCAA
championships last month paced
the Cards to a 26th place finish
out of the 52 teams competing.
The tournament was held at Cal
State-Fullerton.
In the Western Intercollegiate
Conference tournament, whose
hosts invite all colleges and
universities west of the Rockies,
Stanford placed first in the foil
competition, paced by junior
Madison Grose's third place
individual finish.
The Cards were fourth in the

tournament's spee competition
and sixth in sabre, and finished
second overall out of 20 teams
participating in the March meet.
A week later, the women's
fencing team placed ninth out of
20 teams in their WIC tourney.
The women also finished
third in the NorCal foil
competition last quarter.
The outlook for Helliwell's
swordsmen next year is bright.
Individual standouts like Walt
and Burke will be returning, and
Helliwell will also be able to call
upon a number of current novice
fencers who made an impressive
showing in their first
intercollegiate competition
earlier this month.
On May 3, the Cards hosted
the Central Division of the Nor
Cal Intercollegiate Fencing
Association's 9th Annual Novice
Foil Meet. Junior David Basri
and sophomore Russ Ritter
finished first and third
respectively in the men's
competition. Junior Lorna
McCrae and sophomore Jo
Valenti placed first and sixth
respectively for the women.

ANOTHER YEAR—Quarterback Guy Benjamin, shown here during spring practice, has received an
extra year of playing eligibility, the Pacific Eight Conference office announced yesterday. Benjamin
did not play during his freshman year due to a knee injury, and won the extra year under the NCAA's
hardship rule. He will now be able to play for three more seasons.
