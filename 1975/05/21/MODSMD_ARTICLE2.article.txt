# Under Newer Law
## Urban Coalition May Run Terrace 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition
would be willing to manage
Frenchman's Terrace if it were built
under Section 8 of the Housing and
Community Development Act of
1974, coalition director Robert
Moulton told the Daily yesterday.
Frenchman's Terrace, a 225-unit
housing development, would be built
on University land annexed to Palo
Alto. Purchasers would be subsidized
by $5 million in federal funds.
Moulton said he is "extraordinarily
disappointed" that the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) decided last week to deny the
project funding under Section 236 of
the National Housing Act of 1968.
He explained that while it is still
possible to build the project under the
newer law, HUD's announcement has
only served to stall the project.
"I'm disappointed because after
several years of plans for Frenchman's
Terrace, there is still no housing,"
Moulton said. "Implicit in HUD's
latest decision is delay."
Could Have Been Built
Moulton claimed that if the
University had agreed to give up
occupancy restrictions and change the
income mix, the project would have
been built by now.
HUD objected to the University's
insistence on allocating percent of
the housing to market-priced units, 40
percent to moderate priced units and
20 percent to low-income housing.
HUD also ruled illegal the
University's plan for giving Stanford
employees priority for half of the

units.
Despite Moulton's disappointment
that the project has been delayed, he
said he could understand the
University's reasons for insisting on
the restrictions.
"The Board of Trustees wants to
demonstrate the benefits of
Frenchman's Terrace to University
employees by showing explicit
evidence that at least some of the units
will be allocated to them," Moulton
explained.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
claimed that because the University is
permitting the project to be built on
its land even though the land might be
used more profitably for other
purposes, it should have the right to

allocate half of the units to its own
employees.
Prove Benefit
Augsburger added that because the
land is a trust asset, it is necessary to
prove that some benefit will accrue to
the Univeristy before the land can be
allocated.
Moulton said, however, that he
believed "an intelligent program would
produce what the University wants"
without imposing restrictions.
James Price, HUD area director,
yesterday repeated his insistence that
the occupancy restrictions are illegal.
Augsburger could not be reached
for comment, but he stated last week
that the University hopes to persuade
HUD of the restrictions' legality.
"There is a growing acceptance of

income mixtures in projects designed
primarily to help the low income
groups," Moulton said. "It is felt
desirable to have economic integration
just as it's desirable to have racial
integration."
Moulton explained that under
Section 236, there was no provision
for construction of anything but low
and moderate income units because
the Housing Act of 1965 was designed
to help the poor.
Made Exception
HUD made an exception for the
University, allowing the allocation of
40 percent of the units to
market-priced housing, he noted.

is not designed specifically for the
poor, Section 8 will permit up to 80
percent of the units to be sold to
non-subsidized buyers.
Moulton said that if the University
decided to sell 80 percent of the units
to higher income buyers, the Urban
Coalition would reconsider its support
of the project because its goal is to
help low income groups.
Mix Is 'Freer'
Noting that the "income mix is
freer under Section 8" than under
23G, Moulton said that he is pleased

that one major obstacle has been
overcome in the struggle to build
Frenchman's Terrace. But he said that
the question of occupancy restrictions
might result in a protracted legal
dispute.
Augsburger, however, said he is
optimistic about the latest
developments.
"Section 8 really seems to be much
more flexible and adaptable to our
needs than was Section 236,"
Augsburger said. "If we can
accomplish close to the same thing,
this sounds like a better program."

is not designed specifically for the
poor, Section 8 will permit up to 80
percent of the units to be sold to
non-subsidized buyers.
Moulton said that if the University
decided to sell 80 percent of the units
to higher income buyers, the Urban
Coalition would reconsider its support
of the project because its goal is to
help low income groups.
Mix Is 'Freer'
Noting that the "income mix is
freer under Section 8" than under
23G, Moulton said that he is pleased

that one major obstacle has been
overcome in the struggle to build
Frenchman's Terrace. But he said that
the question of occupancy restrictions
might result in a protracted legal
dispute.
Augsburger, however, said he is
optimistic about the latest
developments.
"Section 8 really seems to be much
more flexible and adaptable to our
needs than was Section 236,"
Augsburger said. "If we can
accomplish close to the same thing,
this sounds like a better program."
The Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition
would be willing to manage
Frenchman's Terrace if it were built
under Section 8 of the Housing and
Community Development Act of
1974, coalition director Robert
Moulton told the Daily yesterday.
Frenchman's Terrace, a 225-unit
housing development, would be built
on University land annexed to Palo
Alto. Purchasers would be subsidized
by $5 million in federal funds.
Moulton said he is "extraordinarily
disappointed" that the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) decided last week to deny the
project funding under Section 236 of
the National Housing Act of 1968.
He explained that while it is still
possible to build the project under the
newer law, HUD's announcement has
only served to stall the project.
"I'm disappointed because after
several years of plans for Frenchman's
Terrace, there is still no housing,"
Moulton said. "Implicit in HUD's
latest decision is delay."
Could Have Been Built
Moulton claimed that if the
University had agreed to give up
occupancy restrictions and change the
income mix, the project would have
been built by now.
HUD objected to the University's
insistence on allocating percent of
the housing to market-priced units, 40
percent to moderate priced units and
20 percent to low-income housing.
HUD also ruled illegal the
University's plan for giving Stanford
employees priority for half of the

units.
Despite Moulton's disappointment
that the project has been delayed, he
said he could understand the
University's reasons for insisting on
the restrictions.
"The Board of Trustees wants to
demonstrate the benefits of
Frenchman's Terrace to University
employees by showing explicit
evidence that at least some of the units
will be allocated to them," Moulton
explained.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
claimed that because the University is
permitting the project to be built on
its land even though the land might be
used more profitably for other
purposes, it should have the right to

allocate half of the units to its own
employees.
Prove Benefit
Augsburger added that because the
land is a trust asset, it is necessary to
prove that some benefit will accrue to
the Univeristy before the land can be
allocated.
Moulton said, however, that he
believed "an intelligent program would
produce what the University wants"
without imposing restrictions.
James Price, HUD area director,
yesterday repeated his insistence that
the occupancy restrictions are illegal.
Augsburger could not be reached
for comment, but he stated last week
that the University hopes to persuade
HUD of the restrictions' legality.
"There is a growing acceptance of

income mixtures in projects designed
primarily to help the low income
groups," Moulton said. "It is felt
desirable to have economic integration
just as it's desirable to have racial
integration."
Moulton explained that under
Section 236, there was no provision
for construction of anything but low
and moderate income units because
the Housing Act of 1965 was designed
to help the poor.

University's reasons for insisting on
the restrictions.
"The Board of Trustees wants to
demonstrate the benefits of
Frenchman's Terrace to University
employees by showing explicit
evidence that at least some of the units
will be allocated to them," Moulton
explained.
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
claimed that because the University is
permitting the project to be built on
its land even though the land might be
used more profitably for other
purposes, it should have the right to

allocate half of the units to its own
employees.
Prove Benefit
Augsburger added that because the
land is a trust asset, it is necessary to
prove that some benefit will accrue to
the Univeristy before the land can be
allocated.
Moulton said, however, that he
believed "an intelligent program would
produce what the University wants"
without imposing restrictions.
James Price, HUD area director,
yesterday repeated his insistence that
the occupancy restrictions are illegal.
Augsburger could not be reached
for comment, but he stated last week
that the University hopes to persuade
HUD of the restrictions' legality.
"There is a growing acceptance of

income mixtures in projects designed
primarily to help the low income
groups," Moulton said. "It is felt
desirable to have economic integration
just as it's desirable to have racial
integration."
Moulton explained that under
Section 236, there was no provision
for construction of anything but low
and moderate income units because
the Housing Act of 1965 was designed
to help the poor.
Made Exception
HUD made an exception for the
University, allowing the allocation of
40 percent of the units to
market-priced housing, he noted.

IMMORTALITY—Stanford has always honored heroic figures of its past by naming appropriate University facilities
after them. Ray Lyman Wilbur got a dorpi. David Starr Jordan got a lecture hall. Donald Tresidder got a white
elephant. And now Steve Weiss, recent candidate for ASSU president and one of the faceless drones who puts out the
'Chaparral', has a bike rack named in his honor. 'Chappie' staffers dedicated the rack in front of the bookstore
yesterday in front of this enthusiastic audience.
is not designed specifically for the
poor, Section 8 will permit up to 80
percent of the units to be sold to
non-subsidized buyers.
Moulton said that if the University
decided to sell 80 percent of the units
to higher income buyers, the Urban
Coalition would reconsider its support
of the project because its goal is to
help low income groups.
Mix Is 'Freer'
Noting that the "income mix is
freer under Section 8" than under
23G, Moulton said that he is pleased

that one major obstacle has been
overcome in the struggle to build
Frenchman's Terrace. But he said that
the question of occupancy restrictions
might result in a protracted legal
dispute.
Augsburger, however, said he is
optimistic about the latest
developments.
"Section 8 really seems to be much
more flexible and adaptable to our
needs than was Section 236,"
Augsburger said. "If we can
accomplish close to the same thing,
this sounds like a better program."
