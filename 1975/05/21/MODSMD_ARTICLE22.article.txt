# Pro Prognosis
## Pyne's Playoff Predictions 
### Dan Pyne 
Well, television addicts, they've finally
done it. They've finally figured out how to
fill that programming gap that used to show
up in the spring when basketball and
hockey ended and baseball had not yet
begun. They've run the seasons until June.
The basketball season has fortunately
been something to watch, and now a few
people have followed NBA play to its
ultimate, albeit lengthy, finale this week.
But for hockey, the extension hasn't proven
nearly as wise. There aren't quite as many
people who watch hockey (especially here
in sunny California), and even as a
Midwestern ice-advocate, I must concede it
has been a long season. Too long.
At any rate, from the blue room atop the
Clandestine Castle of the Hotel Belmore in
modestly scenic downtown Omaha, we
bring you Arthur F. Mahoneyson and his
band of pink percussion playing a lilting
refrain of the popular song, "Zamboni In A
Minor" and a rousing rendition of "What
Are The Warriors Doing In A Professional
Basketball Playoff (And Why)?" Take it
away, Arthur.

You may have missed it, but some pretty
interesting things slid around on ice last
week in both National Hockey League
semifinal playoffs, not the least of which
was cylindrical and black, and not the most
of which was Philadelphia Flyer Dave
Schultz.
Most surprising was the astounding,
almost-miraculous, near-comeback staged
by the unsinkable New York Islanders in
their series with Philadelphia. Down 3-0 in
games and looking quite ill, the Long Island
icers battled their way back even with the
Flyers and almost, almost pulled off the
ultimate coup, only to lose the deciding
game last Tuesday.
Gilles: A Giant-Killer
Oh well. The high point of the series was
New York's Clark Gilles in his role of
giant-killer, konking hatchetman Schultz for
Sports Illustrated's "NHL heavyweight
championship." It was better than Lyle-Ali
anyway.
On the other side of the East, Buffalo
knocked off the immortal Montreal
Canadiens 4-2 with relatively little trouble,
proving that expansion teams really can
play well and win.
Montreal was very sporting about the

whole thing, which is the way you get after
you win too many Stanley Cup
championships. C'cst la vie.
The coal-headed Flyers have got to be
the unsentimental favorites for a second
straight NHL crown (besides, they lead the
series). Marshalled by Bobby Clarke
(toothless but certainly not mindless), the
Flyers are both rough and competent.
Clarke, the best defensive forward in
hockey, must be neutralized for a team to
stop Philadelphia. No one has been able to
accomplish that end yet.
In addition the Flyers throw people like
goalie Bernie Parent, forwards Bob Kelly,
Schultz, Don Saleski, scorers like Rick
MacLeich, as well as a pretty effective
power play (which New York bottled
up. . for a while) at you.
Buffalo: They're Skaters
Buffalo is mild in comparison. "A
skating team" is the way General Manager
Punch Imlach puts it, and he adds, "when
we go against Philadelphia, we never know
what to expect, a battle or a hockey game."
A battle, Punch, a battle.
The Sabres' "French Connection" line of
center Gilbert Perreault and Wingers Rene
Robert and Richard Martin accounted for
131 goals this season, and could give the
Flyers problems, but chances are better
than 2-1 that Philadelphia's punch and run
hockey will throw the Sabres' offense off its
timing.
Bobby Clarke gives Perreault a lot of
trouble in the middle whenever the two
teams play, and Perreault is important to
the Buffalo attack. In addition, the Sabres'
defense may not be able to stop New York's
aggressive attack.
Much as I hate to say it, I figure the
Flyers will win their trophy and do it in six
games, living up to Teddy Roosevelt's
famous "speak softly and carry a big
hockey stick," or something.
, * * *
And then there are the Warriors.
The Golden State Warriors.
They're a team that, if anyone had asked
me (and no one did), I would have picked
for the bottom of their division, despite
Rick Barry. Now there they are, playing in
the National Basketball Association
championships; playing well in the NBA
championships, as a matter of fact, and an
even money bet to win the whole shooting

match.
Why?
Because I've predicted they would get
killed all season long and they continually
win when they must, scrapping for points
against teams with seemingly superior
position-by-position line-ups.
Warriors Balanced
Because they've proven that Barry is not
the whole team, that guys like Derek
Dickey and Phil Smith and Charles Dudley
and Bill Bridges can come off the bench and
pull the team out of a tailspin.
Because the starting line-up of Barry and
Keith Wilkes and Charles Johnson and
Butch Beard and Clifford Kay can be an
explosive combination when they click.
Because Barry can score. And score. And
score.
Attles' Skill
Because Coach A 1 Attles has been able to
hold the team together all season,
weathering statements that Golden State
was playing "over its head," unfazed by
the fact that national press has virtually
ignored the Warriors all year, except to
comment that their division was weak, that
their offense relies heavily on Barry, and
that they are playing in the championship
against Washington. Attles has continually
kept the Warriors on the winning track.
Because the Bullets are considered the
best team in basketball simply because they
beat the Celtics and because they are from
the East. Admittedly, the Bullets have been
through a lot as well. They put away
Buffalo and high scoring Bob McAdoo.
They put away the Celtics (a not unnotable
feat in itself).
Coach K.C. Jones has kept his team in
the playoffs the way Attles has â€” through
perseverence. Elvin Hayes, Phil Chenier,
Mike Riordan, and little Kevin Porter are
scorers to be sure. Center Wes Unseld is a
small but burly center, and led the NBA in
rebounding.
But, after their two playoff series
conquests, it's got to be the Warriors. The
Cinderella of the NBA. And the home town
favorite.
I don't particularly like them. I rooted
for Chicago, as a matter of fact, and Seattle
before that. Somehow the Warriors have
won my sympathy. And my vote.
But it isn't worth much. I predicted the
Nuggets would win the ABA. And that
seemed like a safer prediction.

Well, television addicts, they've finally
done it. They've finally figured out how to
fill that programming gap that used to show
up in the spring when basketball and
hockey ended and baseball had not yet
begun. They've run the seasons until June.

best team in basketball simply because they
beat the Celtics and because they are from
the East. Admittedly, the Bullets have been
through a lot as well. They put away
Buffalo and high scoring Bob McAdoo.
They put away the Celtics (a not unnotable
feat in itself).
Coach K.C. Jones has kept his team in
the playoffs the way Attles has â€” through
perseverence. Elvin Hayes, Phil Chenier,
Mike Riordan, and little Kevin Porter are
scorers to be sure. Center Wes Unseld is a
small but burly center, and led the NBA in
rebounding.
But, after their two playoff series
conquests, it's got to be the Warriors. The
Cinderella of the NBA. And the home town
favorite.
I don't particularly like them. I rooted
for Chicago, as a matter of fact, and Seattle
before that. Somehow the Warriors have
won my sympathy. And my vote.
But it isn't worth much. I predicted the
Nuggets would win the ABA. And that
seemed like a safer prediction.

Well, television addicts, they've finally
done it. They've finally figured out how to
fill that programming gap that used to show
up in the spring when basketball and
hockey ended and baseball had not yet
begun. They've run the seasons until June.
The basketball season has fortunately
been something to watch, and now a few
people have followed NBA play to its
ultimate, albeit lengthy, finale this week.
But for hockey, the extension hasn't proven
nearly as wise. There aren't quite as many
people who watch hockey (especially here
in sunny California), and even as a
Midwestern ice-advocate, I must concede it
has been a long season. Too long.
At any rate, from the blue room atop the
Clandestine Castle of the Hotel Belmore in
modestly scenic downtown Omaha, we
bring you Arthur F. Mahoneyson and his
band of pink percussion playing a lilting
refrain of the popular song, "Zamboni In A
Minor" and a rousing rendition of "What
Are The Warriors Doing In A Professional
Basketball Playoff (And Why)?" Take it
away, Arthur.

You may have missed it, but some pretty
interesting things slid around on ice last
week in both National Hockey League
semifinal playoffs, not the least of which
was cylindrical and black, and not the most
of which was Philadelphia Flyer Dave
Schultz.
Most surprising was the astounding,
almost-miraculous, near-comeback staged
by the unsinkable New York Islanders in
their series with Philadelphia. Down 3-0 in
games and looking quite ill, the Long Island
icers battled their way back even with the
Flyers and almost, almost pulled off the
ultimate coup, only to lose the deciding
game last Tuesday.
Gilles: A Giant-Killer
Oh well. The high point of the series was
New York's Clark Gilles in his role of
giant-killer, konking hatchetman Schultz for
Sports Illustrated's "NHL heavyweight
championship." It was better than Lyle-Ali
anyway.
On the other side of the East, Buffalo
knocked off the immortal Montreal
Canadiens 4-2 with relatively little trouble,
proving that expansion teams really can
play well and win.
Montreal was very sporting about the

whole thing, which is the way you get after
you win too many Stanley Cup
championships. C'cst la vie.
The coal-headed Flyers have got to be
the unsentimental favorites for a second
straight NHL crown (besides, they lead the
series). Marshalled by Bobby Clarke
(toothless but certainly not mindless), the
Flyers are both rough and competent.
Clarke, the best defensive forward in
hockey, must be neutralized for a team to
stop Philadelphia. No one has been able to
accomplish that end yet.
In addition the Flyers throw people like
goalie Bernie Parent, forwards Bob Kelly,
Schultz, Don Saleski, scorers like Rick
MacLeich, as well as a pretty effective
power play (which New York bottled
up. . for a while) at you.
Buffalo: They're Skaters
Buffalo is mild in comparison. "A
skating team" is the way General Manager
Punch Imlach puts it, and he adds, "when
we go against Philadelphia, we never know
what to expect, a battle or a hockey game."
A battle, Punch, a battle.
The Sabres' "French Connection" line of
center Gilbert Perreault and Wingers Rene
Robert and Richard Martin accounted for
131 goals this season, and could give the
Flyers problems, but chances are better
than 2-1 that Philadelphia's punch and run
hockey will throw the Sabres' offense off its
timing.
Bobby Clarke gives Perreault a lot of
trouble in the middle whenever the two
teams play, and Perreault is important to
the Buffalo attack. In addition, the Sabres'
defense may not be able to stop New York's
aggressive attack.
Much as I hate to say it, I figure the
Flyers will win their trophy and do it in six
games, living up to Teddy Roosevelt's
famous "speak softly and carry a big
hockey stick," or something.
, * * *
And then there are the Warriors.
The Golden State Warriors.
They're a team that, if anyone had asked
me (and no one did), I would have picked
for the bottom of their division, despite
Rick Barry. Now there they are, playing in
the National Basketball Association
championships; playing well in the NBA
championships, as a matter of fact, and an
even money bet to win the whole shooting

match.
Why?
Because I've predicted they would get
killed all season long and they continually
win when they must, scrapping for points
against teams with seemingly superior
position-by-position line-ups.
Warriors Balanced
Because they've proven that Barry is not
the whole team, that guys like Derek
Dickey and Phil Smith and Charles Dudley
and Bill Bridges can come off the bench and
pull the team out of a tailspin.
Because the starting line-up of Barry and
Keith Wilkes and Charles Johnson and
Butch Beard and Clifford Kay can be an
explosive combination when they click.
Because Barry can score. And score. And
score.
Attles' Skill
Because Coach A 1 Attles has been able to
hold the team together all season,
weathering statements that Golden State
was playing "over its head," unfazed by
the fact that national press has virtually
ignored the Warriors all year, except to
comment that their division was weak, that
their offense relies heavily on Barry, and
that they are playing in the championship
against Washington. Attles has continually
kept the Warriors on the winning track.
Because the Bullets are considered the
best team in basketball simply because they
beat the Celtics and because they are from
the East. Admittedly, the Bullets have been
through a lot as well. They put away
Buffalo and high scoring Bob McAdoo.

win when they must, scrapping for points
against teams with seemingly superior
position-by-position line-ups.
Warriors Balanced
Because they've proven that Barry is not
the whole team, that guys like Derek
Dickey and Phil Smith and Charles Dudley
and Bill Bridges can come off the bench and
pull the team out of a tailspin.
Because the starting line-up of Barry and
Keith Wilkes and Charles Johnson and
Butch Beard and Clifford Kay can be an
explosive combination when they click.
Because Barry can score. And score. And
score.
Attles' Skill
Because Coach A 1 Attles has been able to
hold the team together all season,
weathering statements that Golden State
was playing "over its head," unfazed by
the fact that national press has virtually
ignored the Warriors all year, except to
comment that their division was weak, that
their offense relies heavily on Barry, and
that they are playing in the championship
against Washington. Attles has continually
kept the Warriors on the winning track.
Because the Bullets are considered the
best team in basketball simply because they
beat the Celtics and because they are from
the East. Admittedly, the Bullets have been
through a lot as well. They put away
Buffalo and high scoring Bob McAdoo.
They put away the Celtics (a not unnotable
feat in itself).
Coach K.C. Jones has kept his team in
the playoffs the way Attles has â€” through
perseverence. Elvin Hayes, Phil Chenier,
Mike Riordan, and little Kevin Porter are
scorers to be sure. Center Wes Unseld is a
small but burly center, and led the NBA in
rebounding.
But, after their two playoff series
conquests, it's got to be the Warriors. The
Cinderella of the NBA. And the home town
favorite.
I don't particularly like them. I rooted
for Chicago, as a matter of fact, and Seattle
before that. Somehow the Warriors have
won my sympathy. And my vote.
But it isn't worth much. I predicted the
Nuggets would win the ABA. And that
seemed like a safer prediction.

Well, television addicts, they've finally
done it. They've finally figured out how to
fill that programming gap that used to show
up in the spring when basketball and
hockey ended and baseball had not yet
begun. They've run the seasons until June.
The basketball season has fortunately
been something to watch, and now a few
people have followed NBA play to its
ultimate, albeit lengthy, finale this week.
But for hockey, the extension hasn't proven
nearly as wise. There aren't quite as many
people who watch hockey (especially here
in sunny California), and even as a
Midwestern ice-advocate, I must concede it
has been a long season. Too long.
At any rate, from the blue room atop the
Clandestine Castle of the Hotel Belmore in
modestly scenic downtown Omaha, we
bring you Arthur F. Mahoneyson and his
band of pink percussion playing a lilting
refrain of the popular song, "Zamboni In A
Minor" and a rousing rendition of "What
Are The Warriors Doing In A Professional
Basketball Playoff (And Why)?" Take it
away, Arthur.

You may have missed it, but some pretty
interesting things slid around on ice last
week in both National Hockey League
semifinal playoffs, not the least of which
was cylindrical and black, and not the most
of which was Philadelphia Flyer Dave
Schultz.
Most surprising was the astounding,
almost-miraculous, near-comeback staged
by the unsinkable New York Islanders in
their series with Philadelphia. Down 3-0 in
games and looking quite ill, the Long Island
icers battled their way back even with the
Flyers and almost, almost pulled off the
ultimate coup, only to lose the deciding
game last Tuesday.
Gilles: A Giant-Killer
Oh well. The high point of the series was
New York's Clark Gilles in his role of
giant-killer, konking hatchetman Schultz for
Sports Illustrated's "NHL heavyweight
championship." It was better than Lyle-Ali
anyway.
On the other side of the East, Buffalo
knocked off the immortal Montreal
Canadiens 4-2 with relatively little trouble,
proving that expansion teams really can
play well and win.
Montreal was very sporting about the

whole thing, which is the way you get after
you win too many Stanley Cup
championships. C'cst la vie.
The coal-headed Flyers have got to be
the unsentimental favorites for a second
straight NHL crown (besides, they lead the
series). Marshalled by Bobby Clarke
(toothless but certainly not mindless), the
Flyers are both rough and competent.
Clarke, the best defensive forward in
hockey, must be neutralized for a team to
stop Philadelphia. No one has been able to
accomplish that end yet.
In addition the Flyers throw people like
goalie Bernie Parent, forwards Bob Kelly,
Schultz, Don Saleski, scorers like Rick
MacLeich, as well as a pretty effective
power play (which New York bottled
up. . for a while) at you.
Buffalo: They're Skaters
Buffalo is mild in comparison. "A
skating team" is the way General Manager
Punch Imlach puts it, and he adds, "when
we go against Philadelphia, we never know
what to expect, a battle or a hockey game."
A battle, Punch, a battle.
The Sabres' "French Connection" line of
center Gilbert Perreault and Wingers Rene
Robert and Richard Martin accounted for
131 goals this season, and could give the
Flyers problems, but chances are better
than 2-1 that Philadelphia's punch and run
hockey will throw the Sabres' offense off its
timing.
Bobby Clarke gives Perreault a lot of
trouble in the middle whenever the two
teams play, and Perreault is important to
the Buffalo attack. In addition, the Sabres'
defense may not be able to stop New York's
aggressive attack.
Much as I hate to say it, I figure the
Flyers will win their trophy and do it in six
games, living up to Teddy Roosevelt's
famous "speak softly and carry a big
hockey stick," or something.
, * * *
And then there are the Warriors.
The Golden State Warriors.
They're a team that, if anyone had asked
me (and no one did), I would have picked
for the bottom of their division, despite
Rick Barry. Now there they are, playing in
the National Basketball Association
championships; playing well in the NBA
championships, as a matter of fact, and an
even money bet to win the whole shooting

match.
Why?
Because I've predicted they would get
killed all season long and they continually
win when they must, scrapping for points
