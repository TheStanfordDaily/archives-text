# Martin Visits Maples: Tantrums Tinge Tennis
## 
### MIKE TOLLIN 
Commentary
Okay, so Billy Martin once
again bvat the best the Stanford
tennis team had to offer
Saturday night. As a college
freshman, he is now probably
the best amateur player in the
world. Okay.
But one question still
remains: When the hell is the kid

going to grow up? Billy's
behavior Saturday night ranged
from infantile to obnoxious,and
brought to mind images of the
10-year-old kid who storms off
the court crying when he doesn't
get his way.
In the second set of his No. 1
singles match against Jim
Delaney, Billy decided that he
wanted to , differ with a

linesman's call. Prancing around
with his arms flailing and his
mouth wailing, Billy managed to
get the call changed. And in the
process, he earned the first
annual Billy the Kid Temper
Tantrum Award, given to the
first player who can get a gentile
tennis crowd to abandon their
whistles for some real-live boos.
Seconds later, after winning

the next point, Billy turned to
the same linesman with a
menacing look and an obscene
gesture, as if to say &%s+*. But
then, Billy was always too busy
playing tennis to learn curse
words, so what he probably
meant was, "So there!"
From that point on, the
normally magnanimous crowd
was clearly anti-Martin.
Ironically enough, after last
month's match in Maples
Pavilion, Martin said he had
made a concerted effort to
behave himself so as not to
provoke the fans. So what
happened Saturday night? Did
Billy just blow his cool?
Doubtful. While he is as naive
and unpolished as they come off
the court, Billy is incredibly
smart on the court — he simply
doesn't make mistakes. He once
said, "Everything I do is based
on how it will affect my tennis
game," and my guess is that his
tirade was a well-calculated
move.
On that occasion, and after
one outburst later, Martin
succeeded in getting reversals.
And out of several borderline
calls, only one went in Delaney's
favor. It doesn't seem so
far-fetched to think that the
linesmen were hesitant to bear
the brunt of Billy's ire, and that
Billy was wpII aware of the
subconscious effects that his
demonstration would have on
the judges. Also, down one set at
the time, Billy seemed to be

looking for something to shake
things up a bit.
Okay. So Billy helped himself
win the match with his childish
antics. But geez, if he has to
resort to that kind of tactic to
win, forget it — I can do without
him.
Next year, before Billy's
mother dresses him up in his
color-coordinated outfit, slicks
down his hair and sends him out
to play up here, let's hope she
teaches him some manners. One
Jimmy Connors is enough.

From that point on, the
normally magnanimous crowd
was clearly anti-Martin.
Ironically enough, after last
month's match in Maples
Pavilion, Martin said he had
made a concerted effort to
behave himself so as not to
provoke the fans. So what
happened Saturday night? Did
Billy just blow his cool?
Doubtful. While he is as naive
and unpolished as they come off
the court, Billy is incredibly
smart on the court — he simply
doesn't make mistakes. He once
said, "Everything I do is based
on how it will affect my tennis
game," and my guess is that his
tirade was a well-calculated
move.
On that occasion, and after
one outburst later, Martin
succeeded in getting reversals.
And out of several borderline
calls, only one went in Delaney's
favor. It doesn't seem so
far-fetched to think that the
linesmen were hesitant to bear
the brunt of Billy's ire, and that
Billy was wpII aware of the
subconscious effects that his
demonstration would have on
the judges. Also, down one set at
the time, Billy seemed to be

looking for something to shake
things up a bit.
Okay. So Billy helped himself
win the match with his childish
antics. But geez, if he has to
resort to that kind of tactic to
win, forget it — I can do without
him.
Next year, before Billy's
mother dresses him up in his

down his hair and sends him out

teaches him some manners. One

FLAILING AND WAILING-UCLA's Billy Martin, probably the
world's best amateur tennis player, launches one of several tirades
against a linesman's call during his all-important No. 1 singles
match Saturday with Jim Delaney.
Commentary
Okay, so Billy Martin once
again bvat the best the Stanford
tennis team had to offer
Saturday night. As a college
freshman, he is now probably
the best amateur player in the
world. Okay.
But one question still
remains: When the hell is the kid

going to grow up? Billy's
behavior Saturday night ranged
from infantile to obnoxious,and
brought to mind images of the
10-year-old kid who storms off
the court crying when he doesn't
get his way.
In the second set of his No. 1
singles match against Jim
Delaney, Billy decided that he
wanted to , differ with a

linesman's call. Prancing around
with his arms flailing and his
mouth wailing, Billy managed to
get the call changed. And in the
process, he earned the first
annual Billy the Kid Temper
Tantrum Award, given to the
first player who can get a gentile
tennis crowd to abandon their
whistles for some real-live boos.
Seconds later, after winning

the next point, Billy turned to
the same linesman with a
menacing look and an obscene
gesture, as if to say &%s+*. But
then, Billy was always too busy
playing tennis to learn curse
words, so what he probably
meant was, "So there!"
From that point on, the
normally magnanimous crowd
was clearly anti-Martin.
Ironically enough, after last
month's match in Maples
Pavilion, Martin said he had
made a concerted effort to
behave himself so as not to
provoke the fans. So what
