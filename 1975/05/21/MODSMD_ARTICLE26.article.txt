Communists Celebrate In Laotian City
SAVANNAKHET, Laos — The Communist-led Pathet
Lao rolled into the former rightiest stronghold of
Savannakhet yesterday, setting off a joyful celebration
that was joined in by opposing troops. A dozen Americans
and six other foreigners held by Laotion students in the
Mekong River city were reported safe and well but their
future was uncertain.
Associated Press Correspondent George Esper reported
from neighboring South Vietnam that there is still no sign
of a civilian government for Saigon three weeks after
Communist forces took over. He said North Vietnamese
troops hold the strategic positions.
Inflation Worse Than Expected
WASHINGTON — Both the economic decline and the
rate of inflation were worse in the first three months of
the year than previously believed, the government said
yesterday.
It also said there was a record decline in corporation
profits.
The Commerce Department said the nation's Gross
National Product declined at a record annual rate of 11.3
percent in the January through March period, worse than
the 10.4 percent rate of decline reported last month. It
said the rate of inflation was 8.5 percent of an annual
rate, worse than the eight percent rate reported earlier.
House Opposes Troop Withdrawls
WASHINGTON — An effort to withdraw 70,000 U.S.
troops from foreign nations faced heavy opposition in the
House yesterday, amid fear that such action would seem
to be a retreat from globa! commitments.
The troop cut was proposed as an amendment to a
$32-billion weapons bill. Other major amendments under
consideration included an across-the-board $1.9 billion
cost reduction and the opening of the military academies
to women.
Across the capitol. Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield said in the wake of U.S. setbacks in Indochina
he is reassessing his longstanding advocacy of worldwide
U.S. troop cuts.
"Since the administration is reassessing its position, I'm
reassessing mine," Mansfield told newsmen.
He said he has not decided whether to try again this
year for a U.S. troop cut, such as his proposal for a
125,000-man phased reduction rejected by the Senate last
year.
The House action was on a $32 billion authorization
for military hardware procurement, research and
development.
Ford Fights Social Security Tax Hike
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration

recommended yesterday against any new Social Security
tax increases before 1977 but refused to submit specific
new proposals to halt deficits expected to total $14.6
billion over the next three years.
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Caspar
Weinberger told the House Ways and Means subcommittee
on social security that the refusal was prompted by the
"cavalier disregard" shown by Congress toward the
administration's earlier proposal to reduce benefit
increases in July for 35 million poor and elderly
Americans.
INew Middle hast Talks Considered
VIENNA — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko have agreed to
work out a cooperative approach to holding a Middle East
peace conference in Geneva, a high U.S. official said
yesterday.
He said the two ministers made real progress during
two days of meetings in Vienna toward agreement on the
timing and manner of convening a new Geneva
conference.
Mafia. CIA Plotted Castro Murder?
NEW YORK — The Rockefeller Commission has
learned of F'Bl memos supporting charges that the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) plotted with the Mafia to kill
Cuban Premier Fidel Castro in 1961, the New York Times
reported yesterday.
The newspaper quoted authoritative sources as saying a
former Justice Department official testified before the
commission in closed session that department files contain
the FBI memos.
The memos confirm that the CIA contacted Sam
Giancana, a Chicago racketeer, and John Roselli, a soldier
of fortune with Mafia connections, in a plot to kill Castro,
according to the sources.
There was no information on whether the plot was
approved by the late President John Kennedy or high
administration officials.
Foster Defense Attaeks Gun Theory
SACRAMENTO — A San Francisco law student
yesterday sharpiy disputed a key prosecution witness'
claim that he cold a pistol to a defendant in the Marcus
Foster murder trial.
Michael McMahon's testimony related to one of the
guns the prosecution has argued was used to kill Oakland
schools chief Marcus Foster in a parking lot Nov. 6, 1973.
Christopher Thompson, a tall, slender black militant,
had told the jury earlier he sold a .38-calliber Rossi to
Russell Little.
But McMahon, dressed in a neat, dark three-piece suit,
carefully recounted a chance meeting he had with
Thompson at Hastings Law School's cafeteria after
Foster's death.
Thompson told McMahon he agreed to sell the gun to
Nancy Ling Perry, one of six Symbionese Liberation
Army members slain in a shootout a year ago with Los
Angeles police, McMahon testified.

SAN QUENTIN — Sirhan Sirhan, the convicted assassin
of U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy, is scheduled for parole on
Feb. 23, 1986, the California Adult Authority said
yesterday.

Department of Corrections, said releasing Sirhan on that
date would give him a prison sentence of 16 years, nine
months.
He said the actual length of Sirhan's life term was "at
the top range for first-degree murders."

There was no information on whether the plot was
approved by the late President John Kennedy or high

cost reduction and the opening of the military academies
to women.

125,000-man phased reduction rejected by the Senate last
year.
The House action was on a $32 billion authorization

the year than previously believed, the government said
yesterday.
It also said there was a record decline in corporation
profits.
The Commerce Department said the nation's Gross
National Product declined at a record annual rate of 11.3

House Opposes Troop Withdrawls
WASHINGTON — An effort to withdraw 70,000 U.S.
troops from foreign nations faced heavy opposition in the
House yesterday, amid fear that such action would seem
to be a retreat from globa! commitments.
The troop cut was proposed as an amendment to a
$32-billion weapons bill. Other major amendments under
consideration included an across-the-board $1.9 billion
cost reduction and the opening of the military academies
to women.
Across the capitol. Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield said in the wake of U.S. setbacks in Indochina
he is reassessing his longstanding advocacy of worldwide
U.S. troop cuts.
"Since the administration is reassessing its position, I'm
reassessing mine," Mansfield told newsmen.
He said he has not decided whether to try again this
year for a U.S. troop cut, such as his proposal for a
125,000-man phased reduction rejected by the Senate last
year.
The House action was on a $32 billion authorization
for military hardware procurement, research and
development.

WASHINGTON — The Ford administration

new proposals to halt deficits expected to total $14.6
billion over the next three years.
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Caspar
Weinberger told the House Ways and Means subcommittee
on social security that the refusal was prompted by the
"cavalier disregard" shown by Congress toward the
administration's earlier proposal to reduce benefit
increases in July for 35 million poor and elderly
Americans.

conference.
Mafia. CIA Plotted Castro Murder?
NEW YORK — The Rockefeller Commission has
learned of F'Bl memos supporting charges that the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) plotted with the Mafia to kill
Cuban Premier Fidel Castro in 1961, the New York Times
reported yesterday.
The newspaper quoted authoritative sources as saying a
former Justice Department official testified before the
commission in closed session that department files contain
the FBI memos.
The memos confirm that the CIA contacted Sam
Giancana, a Chicago racketeer, and John Roselli, a soldier
of fortune with Mafia connections, in a plot to kill Castro,
according to the sources.
There was no information on whether the plot was
approved by the late President John Kennedy or high
administration officials.

guns the prosecution has argued was used to kill Oakland
schools chief Marcus Foster in a parking lot Nov. 6, 1973.

Nancy Ling Perry, one of six Symbionese Liberation
Army members slain in a shootout a year ago with Los
Angeles police, McMahon testified.
