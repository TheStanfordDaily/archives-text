# Harvard To Treat Sexes Equally For Admission
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Equal consideration for admission
and financial aid will be given to men
and women applying to Radcliffe and
Harvard under a plan approved last
week by the Harvard University Board
of Overseers.
The plan, to go into effect in 1976,
is not predicted to immediately
change the composition of Harvard
classes, but according to the
committee, it should drop the

male-female ratio to 3-2 "within a
reasonable period." Currently, there is
a quota of five men for every two
women admitted.
Stanford abandoned using quotas
about four years ago, said Assistant
Director of Financial Aids Mary
Roberts.
The Board of Overseers' plan calls
for a single admissions office for both
Eastern schools. Women will apply to
this office, and unless legal obstacles

are encountered, will be enrolled in
both Harvard and Radcliffe.
Harvard and Radcliffe presently
share classes, dormitories and other
facilities, but remain technically
different colleges. Since 1963,
however, women have been receiving
Harvard degrees.
Plan Approved
So far, the plan has been approved
by the Harvard Corporation and the
trustees of Radcliffe College. Part of
the university faculty also has given its
approval.
Among the more controversial
proposals accepted by the Harvard
Corporation and the Board of
Overseers is a recommendation that
while thenumber of women should be
increased, the actual enrollment of
Harvard should not be "substantially"
increased. Currently, Harvard has 4568
male undergraduates, while Radcliffe
has 1719 women.
This recommended drop in the
actual number of male students
admitted has alarmed some Harvard
alumni.
Alumni Divided
Most alumni "are solidly behind
equal access and see it as a proper
principle in moral terms," said Chase
Peterson, Harvard vice president for
alumni affairs and development, in a
New York Times interview. However,
for a number of reasons, said Peterson,
"some nostalgic and irrational, some
logical and seminal" alumni opinion is
divided on the issue.
