# University Police Alter Arrest Rule
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The Department of Police Services
has relaxed its policy of notifying
Stanford employees' supervisors of an
employee's arrest. Director of Police
Services Marvin Herrington announced
yesterday.
Stanford police now will contact
the affected University department
head or personnel director only in the
cases of "job-related" arrests,
Herrington said.
The previous policy, outlined in a
March 14, 1975 memorandum from
Herrington to Captains William
Wullschleger and Raoul Niemeyer and
Lieutenant Walter Konar, states that
supervisors will be notified in all cases
involving the arrest of a Stanford
employee.
Both policies concern only arrests
made by the University police
department, Herrington asserted.
Herrington said the policy change
was prompted by a request yesterday
from Santa Clara County Undersheriff

Tom Rosa that University police, as
deputies of the county sheriff, comply
with the department's policy on
information release.
Rosa Unaware
Rosa said he was unaware of
Stanford's original policy until
confronted with the memorandum
Monday. Daily Editor Kevin Smith
had found the memo slipped under the
doors of the Daily office early Monday
morning.
"Our policy would be to only
release this evidence if it was relevant
to their employment," Rosa said. "If
we found material taken from | the
arrested person's] place of business,
we would contact the employer,"
Rosa continued.
Herrington admitted that the new
policy would necessitate the use of
discretion by police on what crimes
are "job-related."
Drunks Not Covered
He said thefts from the University
would obviously be job-related, while
drunk driving would not be.
Herrington claimed that in his
original memo "I was really interested
in job-related arrests. I just didn't try
to nitpick when 1 told my captains."
Herrington stated that he originally
wrote the memo when he received
complaints from department heads
who thought the police department
should have informed them why their
employees suddenly disappeared.
'Common Courtesy'
"If we arrest someone who works
for Lockheed, we won't notify
Lockheed. But since we're employed
by Stanford it's a common courtesy
type of thing" to notify University
supervisors. Herrington continued.
He claimed he wrote the memo on
his own volition without any orders
from other University officials.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said he had been
unaware of the original policy, but
added that if the notification policy
were limited to "the theft of
University property or crime against
