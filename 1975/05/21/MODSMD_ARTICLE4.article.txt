# Revolutionary Student Brigade
## Radical Group 'Lacks Campus Support' 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Although the Revolutionary
Student Brigade (RSB) co-sponsored
last week's rally protesting the Iran
contract and changes in minority
financial aid policy, it is not a
Stanford student organization and
may never have enough student
support to begin a chapter here, say
some members of the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC).
RSB is a national student
organization dedicated to supporting
"the struggles of oppressed peoples" at

home and overseas "against the whole
system of imperialism," and opposing
the "threat of war," according to one
of its San Francisco members, who
preferred to be identified simply as
"Anna."
If RSB did set up a chapter here,
said ARC member Stephanie
Woolhandler, it would be separate
from ARC, which also sponsored the
rally.
"Most people don't have unity with
their [RSB members] political line,"
Woolhandler commented. She
emphasized that ARC and RSB have
"no organizational ties."
Establishing an RSB chapter at
Stanford is something "we're sure
going to work on," said Anna. RSB
has sold newspapers and set up an
information table at Stanford and "has
gotten a real good response" she said.
A few Stanford students came to
RSB's regional conference in
February, she added.
100 Chapters
RSB currently has chapters at the
state and city college campuses in San
Francisco and San Jose, and at the

University of California at Berkeley.
Anna estimated that there are about
100 chapters on college campuses
across the country.
RSB co-sponsored the rally here
because it sees the struggle here as
"real important" and because the rally
provided an opportunity to "bring out
a lot of lessons," said Anna.
For the past three months, Anna
said, RSB has devoted much of its
efforts to opposing "another
imperialist war of aggression before
we're in the middle of it."
Off ROTC
RSB also has sponsored
demonstrations against Zionism and
worked on Internationa! Women's Day
and International Workers' Day (May
Day) activities, Anna said. The
UC-Berkeley chapter is also working to
get ROTC banned from campus, she
noted.
As in the 19605, students can be
"real force" in society, and RSB is
trying "to link up with the masses of
people to bring about change," Anna
claimed.
Some Stanford radicals are

skeptical of RSB's chances here.
"I don't think RSB has any place at
Stanford," said. Chris another
ARC member.
Gray, who attended RSB's
founding convention in June 1974,
said he and many others are critical of
RSB. "ARC is a broad-based
organization," said Gray, while RSB is
"much more limited."
However, Gray indicated that RSB
and ARC would probably work
together again in the future. "We like
to work with all progressive groups,"
Gray said.
ARC member Don Zweig said, "It
seems like a good idea to have a
national organization |on campus |to
tie in our struggles a little more clearly
with others," but added later that it
was "good for ARC to remain
independent."
Zweig noted that RSB's stand
against all imperialist wars, "including
subjugation of the Arabs by the
Israelis," would create some
controversy within ARC, describing
ARC as "hazy" on that issue.

PROTEST PARLEY—Matt Gutman (left) of the Revolutionary Student Brigade (RSB) pauses for a brief discussion
during a protest march on campus last week. Although RSB members have joined in some activities with the
campus-based Alliance for Radical Change, ARC members say there is no official connection between the two groups.
