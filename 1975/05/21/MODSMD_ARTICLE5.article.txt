# Hemodialyses To Continue With Government Funding
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Patients with chronic kidney failure will be able to
continue receiving hemodialysis treatments at the
Stanford University Hospital hemodialysis center as a
result of a recent action by the federal government.
The center was granted an increase in subsidy
payments after requesting exception from recently
established reimbursement limits of Medicare, says
Paul Gallagher, unit manager of the center.
He adds that the "approval of this request will
reduce the center's total deficit from about $200,000
to approximately $118,330."
Gallagher says that the center plans to file for
another Medicare exception to further reduce the
operating deficit. He says the second exception is
justified because "supply costs have risen, such as
petrochemical derivatives and plastics. The oil crises
thus had a direct, or indirect, effect.
"We are faced with a deficit from 1973 to 1974
that the first request partly paid off. But to operate
at that [ 1973-74] level, the deficit will continue."
Absorbs Deficits •
Gallagher says that Stanford is currently absorbing
part of patient deficits.
He says that the center charges $229 per
treatment, and Medicare now covers approximately
$177 of that cost. Patients must pay the balance if
able.
"Many patients are co-insured via Medi-Cal or
private insurance companies," says Gallagher. "If not,
and they don't have the money, Stanford sets up an
'installment plan' agreement, so they pay gradually."
$1 Million Total
Gallagher estimates that equipment, salaries and
incidental supplies for next year will total $1 million.
While Medicare usually only pays for care for the
elderly, Gallagher says that "Medicare pays [all]
dialysis, as renal disease was written into the law as

being 'chronic, permanent, and debilitating.' "
The center opened in January, and cost
approximately $180,000. It was previously housed in
the Medical Center. The new building currently serves
about 40 patients.
Cleans Blood
Gallagher explains that "dialysis is an artificial
means of cleaning toxins from the blood." Renal
disease is usually hereditary, and results in the
kidney's inability to dense the blood. "Most of our
patients are between the ages of 30 to 45, but the
ages range from 24 to 60," he says.
Most patients receive three treatments weekly,
with each treatment requiring four to six hours.
"Treatments" consist of the patient being
"connected" to a dialysis machine, with a tube
inserted into the arm to take out the toxins. The
blood circulates through the artificial kidney, is
cleansed of toxins, and returned to the patient.
Gallagher says that the patients don't feel "pain"
as such during treatments, but often experience
fatigue. While undergoing treatment, "many sleep,
and some knit or read," says Gallagher.
Waiting For Transplants
Gallagher says that most patients are waiting for
kidney transplants, cheaper in the long run than
dialysis. But they must wait for donors, and the tissue
must be cross-matched.
The goal of the dialysis program, says Gallagher, is
to train people to perform dialysis at home so that
they don't have to come to the center. To do so, they
must be competent, have sufficient self-discipline to
undergo self-treatment regularly and be clinically
healthier than other patients.
Those who are home-trained, says Gallagher, are
often those whose jobs or lifestyles make it very
inconvenient to report to the center for treatments.

While Medicare usually only pays for care for the
elderly, Gallagher says that "Medicare pays [all]
dialysis, as renal disease was written into the law as

being 'chronic, permanent, and debilitating.' "
The center opened in January, and cost
approximately $180,000. It was previously housed in
the Medical Center. The new building currently serves
about 40 patients.
Cleans Blood
Gallagher explains that "dialysis is an artificial
means of cleaning toxins from the blood." Renal
disease is usually hereditary, and results in the
kidney's inability to dense the blood. "Most of our
patients are between the ages of 30 to 45, but the
ages range from 24 to 60," he says.
Most patients receive three treatments weekly,
with each treatment requiring four to six hours.
"Treatments" consist of the patient being
"connected" to a dialysis machine, with a tube
inserted into the arm to take out the toxins. The
blood circulates through the artificial kidney, is
cleansed of toxins, and returned to the patient.
Gallagher says that the patients don't feel "pain"
as such during treatments, but often experience
fatigue. While undergoing treatment, "many sleep,
and some knit or read," says Gallagher.
Waiting For Transplants
Gallagher says that most patients are waiting for
kidney transplants, cheaper in the long run than
dialysis. But they must wait for donors, and the tissue
must be cross-matched.
The goal of the dialysis program, says Gallagher, is
to train people to perform dialysis at home so that
they don't have to come to the center. To do so, they
must be competent, have sufficient self-discipline to
undergo self-treatment regularly and be clinically
healthier than other patients.
Those who are home-trained, says Gallagher, are
often those whose jobs or lifestyles make it very
inconvenient to report to the center for treatments.
Patients with chronic kidney failure will be able to
continue receiving hemodialysis treatments at the
Stanford University Hospital hemodialysis center as a
result of a recent action by the federal government.
The center was granted an increase in subsidy
payments after requesting exception from recently
established reimbursement limits of Medicare, says
Paul Gallagher, unit manager of the center.
He adds that the "approval of this request will
reduce the center's total deficit from about $200,000
to approximately $118,330."
Gallagher says that the center plans to file for
another Medicare exception to further reduce the
operating deficit. He says the second exception is
justified because "supply costs have risen, such as
petrochemical derivatives and plastics. The oil crises
thus had a direct, or indirect, effect.
"We are faced with a deficit from 1973 to 1974
that the first request partly paid off. But to operate
at that [ 1973-74] level, the deficit will continue."
Absorbs Deficits •
Gallagher says that Stanford is currently absorbing
part of patient deficits.
He says that the center charges $229 per
treatment, and Medicare now covers approximately
$177 of that cost. Patients must pay the balance if
able.
"Many patients are co-insured via Medi-Cal or
private insurance companies," says Gallagher. "If not,
and they don't have the money, Stanford sets up an
'installment plan' agreement, so they pay gradually."
$1 Million Total
Gallagher estimates that equipment, salaries and
incidental supplies for next year will total $1 million.
