## Opinions editorial Marxist Econ 
### 
The University's offer of a tenured position to Marxist
economist Don Harris represents a welcome but long
overdue action on the part of the Economics
Department. The decision to hire another Marxist is
primarily the result of continual pressure on the
administration by concerned students, and we must
commend the Economics Department for paying
attention to this student input.
We hope that the Economics Department will
continue this policy of seeking diverse viewpoints in its
faculty and will keep up its search for qualified
exponents of other minority economic viewpoints —
laissez-faire capitalism, for instance — and offer them
positions as well.
