# Crush The Left
## John Pessin

For several years the New
Left has seemed quite moribund.
Now, a small but noteworthy
flurry of protests and marches
reminds us that the New Left is
in fact still with us.
The recent demonstration at
Stanford has been dismissed by
many as a pathetic exercise in
futility and perhaps has made
the decadence of the New Left
obvious to all, but one must still
criticize the weakness of the
administration in refusing to
evict those occupying an
academic building.
By not taking decisive action,
the administration is typical of
many institutions in our society
which fail to act against the
rising tide of disorder, crirpe and
lawlessness.
Why does the New Left hate
America so much? Terrorism of
communist guerrillas is ignored,
but our bombing calls forth an
unending series of
demonstrations.
Prisoners arrested for crimes
like murder and rape become
automatically political prisoners
oppressed by an evil society. But
one may wonder at some point
if there is not a tremendous,
barely concealed self-hatred in
Uie New Left which is merely
projected unto a concept called
"Amerika."
After all, the demonstrators
at Stanford seem to be mostly
middle or upper middle class.
They will most likely move on
to comfortable jobs and arc
certainly not at all oppressed
and downtrodden.
Therefore, they are no more
than parasites living off the
wealth of America while they
whine about an evil society they
are very much a part of. They
too are living off the sweat of
oppressed millions according to
their own Marxian analysis.
Nor have they really inspired
the workers as they claim. A few
years ago, thousands of
infuriated haronats in New York
showed how they felt about the
demonstrators in very clear
terms.
There is no reason why the
contract with the Shah should
be cancelled. His government has
done much to modernize and
stabilize a country in a region of
great instability. Furthermore
Iran is a major ally of America,
and I for one am not reluctant

to consider my country's
interests important.
Since Stanford was
exceptional several years ago in
being willing to cast out a man
like Bruce Franklin while other
college administrations let
revolutionaries run amok, it is
indeed regretable that they
chose to ignore the recent
occupation of Old Union.
If American universities don't
crack down on those who
disrupt, occupy and riot, they
are probably doomed to
increased anarchy in which
spineless administrations cave in
to stupid, unreasonable
demands.
If Stanford is to maintain
itself as a respected and leading
institution of learning, it should
have future occupiers hauled off
to jail and suspended or evicted
from the University.
After a fair warning has been
given, such illegal actions should
be turned over to the police.
Stanford would then be
respected as the first university
to say no to anarchy and fulfill
its responsibilities to learning
and to America.
