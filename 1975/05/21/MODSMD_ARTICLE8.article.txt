# Kent State Leaves Lasting Legacy

Tonight's Third Annual Kent
State-Jackson State Memorial Lecture at 8
p.m. in Memorial Church commemorates
more than a black day out of our own past.
It also should cause us to ponder about the
conditions that led to the awful and
important events of May 1970 and about
their lingering traces today.
For it was five years ago this month that
students at Kent State and at Jackson State
fell victim to the indiscriminate use of fire
power by National Guard and state militia,
violence that a presidential commission
studying the events six months later would
deem unnecessary and unwarranted. And
while all state-authored killing brutalizes
one's sensibilities and generates disrespect
for law, the killing of innocents whose lives
until then were not unlike those of most
American undergraduates should trigger a
particular revulsion on a college campus.
Widespread Protest
The events at Kent, Ohio on the morning
of May 4, 1970, resembled those at most
college campuses at that time. Exasperated
by President Richard Nixon's decision to
launch an "incursion" into Cambodia, war
dissidents at colleges around the country
had moved to organize campus meetings to
prepare a public response.
At Kent State the rally was scheduled
for noon on the college preen. The Ohio
National .Guard, fatigued from controlling a
wildcat labor strike, was summoned to the
Ohio campus to control the rally.

The four students killed that day were
not among the organizers, but had stepped
out to the green merely to observe.
Although some rocks were doubtlessly
hurled at the guardsmen by the crowd of
students, the troopers made no attempt to
discriminate among anyone in the crowd.
The simple fact of being there, of trying
to learn about the events on campus,
apparently sufficed to warrant possible
execution by the state.
Grisly Events
The events a few days later at Jackson
State were no less grisly. There, students in
the supposed safety of a college dorm were
caught in a shower of bullets fired by state
troopers.
What is significant about these events
today at mid-decade, with the depressing
American involvement in the Indochina war
that triggered these events having finally
burnt itself out? At least, it is this: these
events, steeped as they are in grim reality of
the loss of human life, are a reminder of the
crucial importance of engaging in political
action when the times demand it.
It would not be an overstatement to
declare these to be times of activism by a
dedicated few, and general disinterest by
most.
Retreat From Activism
After six years of a deceptive presidency,
10 years of paying for a war in search of a
cause, and t\*o years of a runaway
economy, one would have much reason, as

Voltaire suggests, to cultivate one's own
garden, and leave the problems of this
particular desperate time to someone else.
But so self-oriented an approach is
treacherously deceptive. For the message of
Kent State is that no one, not even the
middle class onlooker at a state university,
can be assured of immunity from the reach
of corrupt and lawless power.
The revelations about political
corruption in the country over the last two
years — including last week's disclosure that
a major oil company was actively involved
in using shareholder dollars to buy the
friendship of sovereign extortionists —
evidence the almost incredible scope of the
power of corruption and the corruption of
power in this decade.
For better or worse, as taxpayers and
consumers, each of us is inexorably bound
up in these matters.
As a consequence, it is necessary to
recognize that self-interest, brigaded with
our individual ideas of decency,compels us
to remain responsive to the political
apparatus, and to respond to it with protest
when events warrant.
Tonight, by remembering those events
through the Memorial Lecture, we not only
memorialize the victims of those tragic
times; we also reaffirm a commitment to
the high degree of vigilence that society
must marshal against the unrestrained use of
state power.
