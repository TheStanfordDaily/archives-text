# Stanford Students Kidnaped In Africa

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Heavily armed persons kidnaped
three Stanford students and a Dutch
researcher from Tanzania's famed
Gombe Stream primate research center
Monday night, it was learned
yesterday.
There has been no word from the
kidnapers, whose identities remain
unknown. According to sketchy
reports from Tanzania, some 40 men
took part in the raid on the facility,
which is located on the eastern shores
of Lake Tanganyika in central-eastern
Africa.
Abducted were:
—Carrie Hunter, 21, a senior in
human biology from Atherton;
—Kenneth Smith, 22, a senior in
human biology behavior from Garden
Grove;
—Barbara Smuts, 24, a graduate
student in neurological and
biobehavioral science from Ann Arbor,
Mich.;
—and Emilie Bergman, a Dutch
researcher.
About 15 other students, including
seven from Stanford, managed to
escape the raiders. Those students have
been evacuated to the nearby town of
Kigoma, and may be headed for the
Tanzanian capital of Dar Es Salaam,
800 miles away. From there, they may
do brought back to the U.S.
Invaded By Boat
According to the Tanzanian
reports, the raiders were uniformed
and said they came from the
neighboring nation of Zaire, which
faces Tanzania across Lake
Tanganyika.
Tanzanian diplomatic and U.S.
State Department officials in
Washington said yesterday afternoon
they still had no firm indication of
who was responsible for the attack.
But television station KPIX in San
Francisco said last night the mother of
one victim told them the State
Department knows who kidnaped the
students. The woman said she had
been asked not to reveal the

organization's name.
The raiders, carrying rifles, pistols
and machine guns, apparently invaded
the remote facility by boat. There is
no land access to the center, and
people and supplies are generally
brought in either by air or by water.
Goodall Escaped
Dr. Jane Goodall, the center's
director and a Stanford professor, was
at the center at the time of the
abduction. At least one report
emanating from Tanzania said Goodall
was the apparent target of the
kidnapers; however, she escaped to the

woods in the confusion of the attack,
and was not harmed. She is apparently
remaining in the Gombe area.
(Goodall's work on primate
research at the center — chiefly
through observation of chimpanzees
and baboons — has been the subject of
several documentary films broadcast
over ABC television.)
The Tanzanian government is
reportedly conducting a land and air
search for the missing students. Two
State Department officials are due in
Kigoma today to observe and aid in
the mission.

Ellen Shippy, a State Department
official in Washington, told the Daily
that the U.S. has been in "close
contact" with the Tanzanian
government about the incident. She
said the department has also been in
contact with the government of Zaire.
'Surprised'
"We can't assume anything right
now," she said. "All we can do is
speculate. There just isn't enough
information."
