# Stanford Students Kidnaped In Africa
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Heavily armed persons kidnaped
three Stanford students and a Dutch
researcher from Tanzania's famed
Gombe Stream primate research center
Monday night, it was learned
yesterday.
There has been no word from the
kidnapers, whose identities remain
unknown. According to sketchy
reports from Tanzania, some 40 men
took part in the raid on the facility,
which is located on the eastern shores
of Lake Tanganyika in central-eastern
Africa.
Abducted were:
—Carrie Hunter, 21, a senior in
human biology from Atherton;
—Kenneth Smith, 22, a senior in
human biology behavior from Garden
Grove;
—Barbara Smuts, 24, a graduate
student in neurological and
biobehavioral science from Ann Arbor,
Mich.;
—and Emilie Bergman, a Dutch
researcher.
About 15 other students, including
seven from Stanford, managed to
escape the raiders. Those students have
been evacuated to the nearby town of
Kigoma, and may be headed for the
Tanzanian capital of Dar Es Salaam,
800 miles away. From there, they may
do brought back to the U.S.
Invaded By Boat
According to the Tanzanian
reports, the raiders were uniformed
and said they came from the
neighboring nation of Zaire, which
faces Tanzania across Lake
Tanganyika.
Tanzanian diplomatic and U.S.
State Department officials in
Washington said yesterday afternoon
they still had no firm indication of
who was responsible for the attack.
But television station KPIX in San
Francisco said last night the mother of
one victim told them the State
Department knows who kidnaped the
students. The woman said she had
been asked not to reveal the

organization's name.
The raiders, carrying rifles, pistols
and machine guns, apparently invaded
the remote facility by boat. There is
no land access to the center, and
people and supplies are generally
brought in either by air or by water.
Goodall Escaped
Dr. Jane Goodall, the center's
director and a Stanford professor, was
at the center at the time of the
abduction. At least one report
emanating from Tanzania said Goodall
was the apparent target of the
kidnapers; however, she escaped to the

woods in the confusion of the attack,
and was not harmed. She is apparently
remaining in the Gombe area.
(Goodall's work on primate
research at the center — chiefly
through observation of chimpanzees
and baboons — has been the subject of
several documentary films broadcast
over ABC television.)
The Tanzanian government is
reportedly conducting a land and air
search for the missing students. Two
State Department officials are due in
Kigoma today to observe and aid in
the mission.

Ellen Shippy, a State Department
official in Washington, told the Daily
that the U.S. has been in "close
contact" with the Tanzanian
government about the incident. She
said the department has also been in
contact with the government of Zaire.
'Surprised'
"We can't assume anything right
now," she said. "All we can do is
speculate. There just isn't enough
information."

politics, expressed some surprise at the
incident. Relations between Tanzania
and Zaire haven't been strained, he
said, and both countries have been
internally stable for the last several
years.
Zaire is the former Belgian Congo;
it last reported serious political
disturbance between 1964 and 1966,
when the so-called Simba movement
led a bloody — and unsuccessful —
attempt to overthrow the central
government.
The Associated Press reported
speculation that the kidnapers might
be part of a guerrilla movement
operating in eastern Zaire against the
government of President Mobutu Sese

Seko.
But Stanford students who
previously served at Gombe said they
had been unaware of any political
tensions in the Tanzania-Zaire border
region.
Julie Johnson, a Stanford graduate
who was at Gombe for 10 months in
1973-74, said such danger was "out of
the realm of anything we ever
considered."
Added David Riss, another former
Gombe student: "I don't think any of
us were ever in a position to be afraid
of anything other than snakes."
As a result, the students said, the
Gombe facility is unarmed. It has one

of the few concentrations of
Americans and Europeans in the
region, the students pointed out, and
thus could make an attractive target
for political kidnapers.
Families Worried
Dr. David Hamburg, a psychiatry
professor here and Stanford's chief
liaison with the Gombe facility, said
that "the Tanzanian government is
doing everything possible, as are the
American and Dutch embassies" in
finding the missing students. The
British government has also taken an
interest in the matter, he said, since
some students at the reserve were
British nationals.
Hamburg has been in contact with

the victims' families, and said they are
holding up "amazingly well." The
families, he said, are "worried as hell,
but they're keeping together."
Hamburg noted that students who
go to Gombe are well-prepared for the
experience: they are chosen in part on
the basis of resourcefulness, and take
courses in the Swahili language as part
of their preparations.
The seven Stanford students now in
Kigoma have been identified as Susan
Loeb, Highland Park, 111.; Michelle
Trudeau, New York City; Phyllis Lee,
Portola Valley; James Baugh, San
Marino, Calif.; Emily Polis, Olympia,
Wash.; Ann Pausey, Oxford, England;
and Craig Packer, Ft. Worth, Tex.

and Zaire haven't been strained, he
said, and both countries have been
internally stable for the last several
years.
Zaire is the former Belgian Congo;
it last reported serious political
disturbance between 1964 and 1966,
when the so-called Simba movement
led a bloody — and unsuccessful —
attempt to overthrow the central
government.
The Associated Press reported
speculation that the kidnapers might
be part of a guerrilla movement
operating in eastern Zaire against the
government of President Mobutu Sese

Seko.
But Stanford students who
previously served at Gombe said they
had been unaware of any political
tensions in the Tanzania-Zaire border
region.
Julie Johnson, a Stanford graduate
who was at Gombe for 10 months in
1973-74, said such danger was "out of
the realm of anything we ever
considered."
Added David Riss, another former
Gombe student: "I don't think any of
us were ever in a position to be afraid
of anything other than snakes."
As a result, the students said, the
Gombe facility is unarmed. It has one

of the few concentrations of
Americans and Europeans in the
region, the students pointed out, and
thus could make an attractive target
for political kidnapers.
Families Worried
Dr. David Hamburg, a psychiatry
professor here and Stanford's chief
liaison with the Gombe facility, said
that "the Tanzanian government is
doing everything possible, as are the
American and Dutch embassies" in
finding the missing students. The
British government has also taken an
interest in the matter, he said, since
some students at the reserve were
British nationals.
Hamburg has been in contact with

the victims' families, and said they are
holding up "amazingly well." The
families, he said, are "worried as hell,
but they're keeping together."
Hamburg noted that students who
go to Gombe are well-prepared for the
experience: they are chosen in part on
the basis of resourcefulness, and take
courses in the Swahili language as part
of their preparations.
The seven Stanford students now in
Kigoma have been identified as Susan
Loeb, Highland Park, 111.; Michelle

Heavily armed persons kidnaped
three Stanford students and a Dutch
researcher from Tanzania's famed
Gombe Stream primate research center
Monday night, it was learned
yesterday.
There has been no word from the
kidnapers, whose identities remain
unknown. According to sketchy
reports from Tanzania, some 40 men
took part in the raid on the facility,
which is located on the eastern shores
of Lake Tanganyika in central-eastern
Africa.
Abducted were:
—Carrie Hunter, 21, a senior in
human biology from Atherton;
—Kenneth Smith, 22, a senior in
human biology behavior from Garden
Grove;
—Barbara Smuts, 24, a graduate
student in neurological and
biobehavioral science from Ann Arbor,
Mich.;
—and Emilie Bergman, a Dutch
researcher.
About 15 other students, including
seven from Stanford, managed to
escape the raiders. Those students have
been evacuated to the nearby town of
Kigoma, and may be headed for the
Tanzanian capital of Dar Es Salaam,
800 miles away. From there, they may
do brought back to the U.S.
Invaded By Boat
According to the Tanzanian
reports, the raiders were uniformed
and said they came from the
neighboring nation of Zaire, which
faces Tanzania across Lake
Tanganyika.
Tanzanian diplomatic and U.S.
State Department officials in
Washington said yesterday afternoon
they still had no firm indication of
who was responsible for the attack.
But television station KPIX in San
Francisco said last night the mother of
one victim told them the State
Department knows who kidnaped the
students. The woman said she had
been asked not to reveal the

organization's name.
The raiders, carrying rifles, pistols
and machine guns, apparently invaded
the remote facility by boat. There is
no land access to the center, and
people and supplies are generally
brought in either by air or by water.
Goodall Escaped
Dr. Jane Goodall, the center's
director and a Stanford professor, was
at the center at the time of the
abduction. At least one report
emanating from Tanzania said Goodall
was the apparent target of the
kidnapers; however, she escaped to the

woods in the confusion of the attack,
and was not harmed. She is apparently
remaining in the Gombe area.
(Goodall's work on primate
research at the center — chiefly
through observation of chimpanzees
and baboons — has been the subject of
several documentary films broadcast
over ABC television.)

holding up "amazingly well." The
families, he said, are "worried as hell,
but they're keeping together."
Hamburg noted that students who
go to Gombe are well-prepared for the
experience: they are chosen in part on
the basis of resourcefulness, and take
courses in the Swahili language as part
of their preparations.

Heavily armed persons kidnaped
three Stanford students and a Dutch
researcher from Tanzania's famed
Gombe Stream primate research center
Monday night, it was learned
yesterday.
There has been no word from the
kidnapers, whose identities remain
unknown. According to sketchy
reports from Tanzania, some 40 men
took part in the raid on the facility,
which is located on the eastern shores
of Lake Tanganyika in central-eastern
Africa.
Abducted were:
—Carrie Hunter, 21, a senior in
human biology from Atherton;
—Kenneth Smith, 22, a senior in
human biology behavior from Garden
Grove;
—Barbara Smuts, 24, a graduate
student in neurological and
biobehavioral science from Ann Arbor,
Mich.;
—and Emilie Bergman, a Dutch
researcher.
About 15 other students, including
seven from Stanford, managed to
escape the raiders. Those students have
been evacuated to the nearby town of
Kigoma, and may be headed for the
Tanzanian capital of Dar Es Salaam,
800 miles away. From there, they may
do brought back to the U.S.
Invaded By Boat
According to the Tanzanian
reports, the raiders were uniformed
and said they came from the
neighboring nation of Zaire, which
faces Tanzania across Lake
Tanganyika.
Tanzanian diplomatic and U.S.
State Department officials in
Washington said yesterday afternoon
they still had no firm indication of
who was responsible for the attack.
But television station KPIX in San
Francisco said last night the mother of
one victim told them the State
Department knows who kidnaped the
students. The woman said she had
been asked not to reveal the

organization's name.
The raiders, carrying rifles, pistols
and machine guns, apparently invaded
the remote facility by boat. There is
no land access to the center, and
people and supplies are generally
brought in either by air or by water.
Goodall Escaped
Dr. Jane Goodall, the center's
director and a Stanford professor, was
at the center at the time of the
abduction. At least one report
emanating from Tanzania said Goodall
was the apparent target of the
kidnapers; however, she escaped to the

woods in the confusion of the attack,
and was not harmed. She is apparently
remaining in the Gombe area.
(Goodall's work on primate
research at the center — chiefly
through observation of chimpanzees
and baboons — has been the subject of
several documentary films broadcast
over ABC television.)
The Tanzanian government is
reportedly conducting a land and air
search for the missing students. Two
State Department officials are due in
Kigoma today to observe and aid in
the mission.

Ellen Shippy, a State Department
official in Washington, told the Daily
that the U.S. has been in "close
contact" with the Tanzanian
government about the incident. She
said the department has also been in
contact with the government of Zaire.
'Surprised'
"We can't assume anything right
now," she said. "All we can do is
speculate. There just isn't enough
information."

incident. Relations between Tanzania
and Zaire haven't been strained, he
said, and both countries have been
internally stable for the last several
years.
Zaire is the former Belgian Congo;
it last reported serious political
disturbance between 1964 and 1966,
when the so-called Simba movement
led a bloody — and unsuccessful —
attempt to overthrow the central
government.
The Associated Press reported
speculation that the kidnapers might
be part of a guerrilla movement
operating in eastern Zaire against the
government of President Mobutu Sese

Seko.
But Stanford students who
previously served at Gombe said they
had been unaware of any political
tensions in the Tanzania-Zaire border
region.
Julie Johnson, a Stanford graduate
who was at Gombe for 10 months in
1973-74, said such danger was "out of
the realm of anything we ever
considered."
Added David Riss, another former
Gombe student: "I don't think any of
us were ever in a position to be afraid
of anything other than snakes."
As a result, the students said, the
Gombe facility is unarmed. It has one

of the few concentrations of
Americans and Europeans in the
region, the students pointed out, and
thus could make an attractive target
for political kidnapers.
Families Worried
Dr. David Hamburg, a psychiatry
professor here and Stanford's chief
liaison with the Gombe facility, said
that "the Tanzanian government is
doing everything possible, as are the
American and Dutch embassies" in
finding the missing students. The
British government has also taken an
interest in the matter, he said, since
some students at the reserve were
British nationals.

the victims' families, and said they are
