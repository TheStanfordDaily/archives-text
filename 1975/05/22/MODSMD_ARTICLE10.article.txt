# Letters--'Mayaguez,' Moynihan, Clarification
## 
### 
Needless Use of Force
Editor:
The U.S. response to the
seizure of the Mayaguez was a
small-scale illustration of the
policies that have kept us
continuously involved in warfare
for the past 25 years.
The Mayaguez was carrying
military supplies, and it sailed
within eight miles of Cambodian
territory. Only a few weeks ago
our latest weapon, the aerosol
fire bomb, was still being
dropped on that ruined country.
The Cambodians are
understandably suspicious after
the torment they endured so
long from the United States.
There is no evidence that
they even received the notes that
the United States tried to send
through China; there is no
information as to what
prompted the seizure. Surely
President Ford could have
waited more than 48 hours
before sending in the bombing
planes.
An act of forbearance would
have meant less risk to the
Mayaguez's crew and might have
saved the lives of those
Cambodians and Americans who
were later killed. But saving lives
was apparently not the concern.
According to the Associated
Press, the Ford Administration
ignored a Cambodian message
announcing release of the
Mayaguez before the marines
attacked, because "Kissinger
wanted a quick and punishing
strike even if the crew was put in
danger."
Afterwards, admiring
congressmen congratulated Ford
for so effectively demonstrating
American strength. If it is a
cause for pride that the world's
most powerful nation rushed
headlong to attack the weakest,
without attempting a peaceful
resolution, then we are seeing
machismo run wild.
Our show of force did
nothing to solve the real
problems we face. The recent

hostility toward Vietnamese
refugees was out of fear of many
Americans for their jobs. Our
cities are going bankrupt; our
environment is deteriorating; we
are afraid to go into the streets
at night.
The real strength of this
nation depends upon whether
we can deal successfully with
these problems. Terrorizing the
rest of the world with our
bloated military power may
provide a distraction, but it is no
solution and in the long run
could bring on disaster.

Boycott Moynihan
Editor:
As graduating seniors, we
support the black community in
its opposition to the choice of
Daniel Patrick Moynihan as
commencement speaker.
Although we view
commencement as an important
activity for graduating students
and their parents, we feel
obliged to boycott the
ceremonies and support the
black community if Moynihan
does speak.
We urge other students to
join us in our protest of
Moynihan as commencement
speaker.

Art Department Gift
Editor:
I would like to correct a
statement made (Daily, May 16)
regarding the approval by the
trustees of a new professorship,
the Christensen Professorship in
Oriental Art.
The article states that the
chair is a "non-incremental"
position. The fact is that
although the professorship will
not be incremental, the funds
provided through Christensen's
generosity will free other funds
which in turn will provide an
incremental junior position in

the Art Department.
The Dean's Office and the
Art Department would
appreciate a correction which
will acknowledge the gift's
importance to the Art
Department. Christensen would
probably appreciate a correct
spelling of his name, as well. His
friends are not likely to
recognize "Chriasteansen," and
such a generous gift deserves
proper identification.

Journalism's Nadir?
Editor:
Never on the Daily's opinion
page have I seen a piece that
bespoke more of ignorance and
elitism than the puerile and
fatuous column by Jim Wascher
(Daily, May 16).
I find it incredible that a
former Daily editor could be so
callous to the oppression and
brutalization of Third World
peoples as to compare the
current wave of student protests
to last year's streaking fad.
If Wascher is representative of
the journalists being "educated"
at a place like Stanford, then I
shudder to reflect on the future
of mass communications in this
country — to say nothing of the
fascist regime in Iran.

Heinous View
By commenting on the
supposed "silliness'' of the
student demonstration on May
13, Jim Wascher in his column
(Daily, May 16) revealed a
predominant and heinous trend
of racist and reactionary thought
that unfortunately typifies a
general attitude among students
here.
I resent his assumptions that
—demonstrations accomplish
little;
—anglo students are out of
place helping their minority

peers fight for financial aid; and
—political activism is a fad
comparable to streaking.
Addressing the first point:
The purpose of the
demonstration was clear to all
those involved and observing.
The Board of Trustees was
presented with specific demands
and once again reminded that
Stanford's top financial
priorities ought to be to all its
students, and that its social
behavior is not beyond reproach.
Secondly, Wascher's
insinuation that anglo activists
are not qualified to actively
support their minority fellows
suggests an alternative response
of selfish, individual isolationism
that stinks of racism.
And, third, he has regretably,
though not uniquely, chosen to
attend Stanford and arrogantly
disregard the institution's
responsibility to society, as well
as his own.
I once naively thought that
such a well-equipped and
prestigious university as
Stanford offered to its students
the opportunities of expanding
one's mind, or broadening one's
conception of the world.
However, it is clear to me now
that neither is the administration
willing to take this educational
risk, nor are students like
Wascher willing to shoulder this
intellectual responsibility.
Thus, we are left in a place
where many young people are
too contented to change their
minds, and their elders are afraid
to.

On 'Zionist Atrocities'
Editor:
On April 23, the Daily
published an opinions column
by Ahmad Abuel-Haija entitled
"Zionists Commit Atrocities." It
was a dishonest attempt to
justify the Palestine Liberation
Organization's atrocities by
citing cruel acts committed by

"Zionists." I say "dishonest,"
because Abuel-Haija only
presented half-truths. One
example will suffice.
Abuel-Haija refers to an
incident which happened back in
1956, when Arab villagers in
Kafr Kassem were shot for
violating a curfew. I was in Israel
at the time (if that is indeed a
prerequisite for knowledge, as
Abuel-Haija claims), and I know
that the officer responsible for
the shooting, Gavriel Dahan —
who, incidentally, had come to
Israel as a refugee from an Arab
country, Morocco — was tried
and sentenced to several years in
prison.
