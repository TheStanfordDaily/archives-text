# Racist Biases
## Sosa, Ortiz

We are insulted and enraged
by Jim Wascher's opinions
column (Daily, May 16). Calling
the rally on May 13 "silly" and
"a waste of time," he said that
"the people who so carefully
orchestrated the protest knew
from the start that nothing
would be accomplished."
Wascher was quite
condescending in presuming that
he knew exactly what the
organizers of the rally had hoped
to accomplish, especially since
he does not even name these
organizations or give their
viewpoint of the rally. When a
person like Wascher calls the
efforts of the Iranian Student
Association, the Revolutionary
Student Brigade and the Alliance
for Radical Change "silly," it is
the epitome of condescension.
The lives and deaths of the
Iranian people and the efforts of
these groups to help those
people are not "silly" matters.
Another thing that angered
me was Wascher's statement that
"not one black, chicano, Native
American, or Asian American
speaker was present at the
Tuesday rallies to offer the
minority perspective on the
impact of this supposed example
of institutional racism." Wascher
then asks, "How could others
presume to speak for them?"
"Others" did not have to
speak for the minorities. We
both spoke at the rally. We are
both chicanos who did give our
perspective on this actual
example of institutional racism.
Wascher, by presuming to
speak up for the minorities in his
article and by his denial of the
fact that there were minority
speakers and participants at the
rally, revealed his own racist
attitudes which dominate his
mind to the point that he does
not even recognize the
minorities' presence.
Of course, Wascher could
have just gotten his facts wrong,
in which case he did not know
what he was talking about. For
Wascher's information, Students
for Equity, composed of Third
World peoples and concerned
whites, did endorse the rally.
Finally, I would like to point
out that one of the reasons the
chicano community passed a
resolution condemning the Daily
is that some of its regular
writers, like Wascher, are
continually attempting to split
the whites from the minority
peoples. In his article Wascher
criticized the whites for their
"me-tooism" and incorrectly
claimed that the whites did not
allow minority representatives to
speak at the rally. He said that
there were historical roots for
minority activists to be reluctant
to cooperate with white radicals.
It was obvious what Wascher
was implying. Why didn't he just
come right out and say, "Let the
minorities fight their own battles
and you whites stay out of it"?
It is absurd and overtly racist to
imply that minorities and whites
cannot work together.
On the contrary, it is only
through united fronts of whites
and minorities that this
University can be turned around
to meet the needs of all
concerned. In view of the near
loss of fee assessments, I think
the Daily should be more
concerned as to what kind of
image it portrays when it gives
regular space to writers who base
their articles on incorrect facts
and false assumptions.

Celso Ortiz, a junior, are
chicanos.)
