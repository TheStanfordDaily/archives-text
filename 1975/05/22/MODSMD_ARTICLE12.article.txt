## Stanford's Modern Dance 'Heroine' Inga Weiss Fosters 'Organic' Movement 
### JANICE BRESSLER 
Welcoming you into her
office with a gracious nod of her
head or leaping deer-like across
the dance floor, Inga Weiss
emanates dignity and control.
The grand dame of the
modern dance program here for
13 years, Weiss has inspired an
admiration in her students and
peers that approaches awe.
"She is beautiful even when
she walks," says Diana Crosby, a
graduate student in dance
education, "Though, of course,
she's not conscious of it.
"Inga is never late," Crosby
whispers, as her teacher glides to
the front of the Roble dance
studio. "Everything she does is
done flawlessly and with
integrity."
Susan Cashion, who also
teaches dance here, calls Weiss
"a master teacher. To everyone
who knows her, Inga has the aura
of a heroine."
The heroine sits in her office,
crossing her long legs at the
ankles. She smoothes a wayward
strand of blond hair off her
forehead and with wide, gray
eyes looks directly at the
interviewer.
Students Come First
"Of course," she says with a
soft German accent, she is
"delighted" to be interviewed.
But, she adds with a slight shrug
of her narrow shoulders, she
must soon get back to her
students.
Weiss speaks of her students
with warm, unreserved affection.
Opening and rounding her arms,
as if to embrace someone, she
says, "My students are, in a way,
my family. I learn as much from
them as they learn from me."
"They are so inquisitive and
enthusiastic. Having no
preconceived idea of technique,
they are willing to explore."

Dance, like any true art, must touch
the audience honestly / not with
devices or sensationalism.'

Exploration of "all the
possibilities of movement" is
something Weiss strives for in
her classes. Elbow resting on the
piano in the dance studio,
watching her students turn and
slide across the floor, Weiss
never tells a student, "That is
incorrect."
'Interesting' Moves
Rather, she uses the
variations of individuals to
demonstrate the range of
possibilities. "That's very
interesting," is a favorite
comment of hers. "That's not
what we're doing, but that's very
interesting."

Each individual's style, Weiss
believes, must be discovered and
fostered. "Dance is something
organic and not a learned
technique." Saying this, she sits
up suddenly and places, not
claps, her hands together.
"Organic," she repeats, half to
herself, "that's important. I
must remember to speak to my
students about that."
"Inga speaks often and
eloquently to us about dance,"
says Allison Potter, an
undergraduate in Weiss's
intermediate dance class. "She's
very articulate really, but she
rarely says much about her own
amazing past. In terms of
professional dance, she's done
everything."
When talking about her
"amazing past," Weiss's voice
slows to an adagio. She speaks
hesitantly, offering only a few
glimpses of her childhood in
Germany and her career as a
professional dancer. The dates
are left out, the chronology
vague.
'Amazing Past'
Weiss, a native of Bavaria,
says she cannot remember a time
when she did not dance. Her
hand pats the head of an
imagined toddler as she says,"I
must have danced since I was
this high."
There were composers and
musicians in her family. Her
father, she recalls, played the
violin.
Weiss remembers her school
days in Germany during World
War II as a time of great stress
and hardship. "If that gruesome
time had any beneficial effects
on me, it was that it
strengthened me."
At a school "much like the
high school of performing arts in
New York City" she studied
dance forms ranging from opera

and classical ballet to gymnastics
and modern dance. "Probably,
the teachers I had in those early
years, whose names I don't even
remember, had as much
influence on me, by helping me
to love dance, as the famous
choreographers and dancers I
studied with later."
Wigman Influence
"Of all my teachers, though,
Mary Wigman had the greatest
impact on me." Mary Wigman,
in Europe, attained a fame and
influence in modern dance
comparable to that of Martha
Graham in this country.
"Wigman was," Weiss recalls, "a

great lady of dance and an
enlightening choreographer."
Weiss was a leading dancer in
the Mary Wigman Dance Group
in Berlin, a soloist in the Dance
Company at the National
Theater in Mannheim, and
performed solo recitals of her
own work in over 80 cities in
Europe.

'She is beautiful even when she
walks....Everything she does is done
flawlessly and with integrity.'

She perferred concert
performances to lavish theatrical
productions. "Concert dancing is
purer, like chamber music," she
says.
After performing for many
years in Europe, Weiss came to
America to teach. She considers
herself "very fortunate" to have
been introduced to American
dance "on the top floor."
With the Greatest
She taught at Connecticut
College at a time when some of
the greatest names in modern
dance were assembled there.
' 'Graham, [ Merce ]
Cunningham, [Jose] Limon,
[Doris] Humphrey, they were
all on the faculty at Connecticut
then. It was a priceless
experience for me and a time of
historic innovation for American
dance."
American dance today, Weiss
feels, "is very exciting.... There
is much being done and explored
by many young companies.
"The danger I see is that too
many young dancers mistake
device for innovation and strain
to be shocking or original.
Dance, like any true art, must
touch the audience honestly, not
with devices or sensationalism."
Weiss believes this use of
sensationalism springs from the
reliance of dancers on customers
for financial support. She
believes that the American
university must assume the
responsibility as patron of the
arts that the national
government takes in Europe.
Dance 'Mushrooming'
Although she feels American
universities have far to go in
realizing this responsibility,
Weiss notes with satisfaction that
dance programs are "springing
up like mushrooms" on
campuses across the country.
Weiss has been instrumental
in building an increasingly
popular dance program here. She
is pleased with the growing
interest in dance but worries
about being able to keep classes
small. "The studio is full from
morning to night," she says with

both pride and concern.
And from morning to night,
Weiss is running between dance
classes and administrative
deskwork. Besides heading the
undergraduate modern dance
program, Weiss is adviser for a
graduate program in
contemporary dance, which she
established single-handedly

through the Education
School.
Jancy Limpert, a student in
the program, says she would not
be in dance "if it weren't for
Inga. Dancing with Inga is a
spiritual experience. Nothing is
pure technique. Everything
comes from deep inside."
"Dance must come from

within you," Weiss often tells
her students. She insists that the
motivation for dance be from
"inner conviction" and not for
visual effect.
"Students come to the dance
studio not to perform but to get
in touch with their bodies and
minds. My students and I share
moments of dance that are
spontaneous and can never be
captured on stage."
Does she miss the stage?
"It has been a long life in
dance," she answers softly. "My
experience on the stage is
priceless, but there is no need to
talk about it too much. You
know, it is only when you stop
performing that you can stop
focusing on yourself and begin
to really look at what other
people are doing." The palms of
her hands, lying on her knee,
turn toward the ceiling and her
face opens in a smile. "I no
longer dance for applause. I am a
teacher now."

be in dance "if it weren't for
Inga. Dancing with Inga is a
spiritual experience. Nothing is
pure technique. Everything
comes from deep inside."
"Dance must come from

within you," Weiss often tells
her students. She insists that the
motivation for dance be from
"inner conviction" and not for
visual effect.
"Students come to the dance
studio not to perform but to get
in touch with their bodies and
minds. My students and I share
moments of dance that are
spontaneous and can never be
captured on stage."
Does she miss the stage?
"It has been a long life in
dance," she answers softly. "My
experience on the stage is
priceless, but there is no need to
talk about it too much. You
know, it is only when you stop
performing that you can stop
focusing on yourself and begin
to really look at what other
people are doing." The palms of
her hands, lying on her knee,
turn toward the ceiling and her
face opens in a smile. "I no
longer dance for applause. I am a

NO GIMMICKS—Inga Weiss (center) believes that dance should be
"organic," and spring from the inner motivation of the dancer.
Here, she dances with students during a Dance Workshop in 1969.
Welcoming you into her
office with a gracious nod of her
head or leaping deer-like across
the dance floor, Inga Weiss
emanates dignity and control.
The grand dame of the
modern dance program here for
13 years, Weiss has inspired an
admiration in her students and
peers that approaches awe.
"She is beautiful even when
she walks," says Diana Crosby, a
graduate student in dance
education, "Though, of course,
she's not conscious of it.
"Inga is never late," Crosby
whispers, as her teacher glides to
the front of the Roble dance
studio. "Everything she does is
done flawlessly and with
integrity."
Susan Cashion, who also
teaches dance here, calls Weiss
"a master teacher. To everyone
who knows her, Inga has the aura
of a heroine."
The heroine sits in her office,
crossing her long legs at the
ankles. She smoothes a wayward
strand of blond hair off her
forehead and with wide, gray
eyes looks directly at the
interviewer.
Students Come First
"Of course," she says with a
soft German accent, she is
"delighted" to be interviewed.
But, she adds with a slight shrug
of her narrow shoulders, she
must soon get back to her
students.
Weiss speaks of her students
with warm, unreserved affection.
Opening and rounding her arms,
as if to embrace someone, she
says, "My students are, in a way,
my family. I learn as much from
them as they learn from me."
"They are so inquisitive and
enthusiastic. Having no
preconceived idea of technique,
they are willing to explore."

Dance, like any true art, must touch
the audience honestly / not with
devices or sensationalism.'

Exploration of "all the
possibilities of movement" is
something Weiss strives for in
her classes. Elbow resting on the
piano in the dance studio,
watching her students turn and
slide across the floor, Weiss
never tells a student, "That is
incorrect."
'Interesting' Moves
Rather, she uses the
variations of individuals to
demonstrate the range of
possibilities. "That's very
interesting," is a favorite
comment of hers. "That's not
what we're doing, but that's very
interesting."

Each individual's style, Weiss
believes, must be discovered and
fostered. "Dance is something
organic and not a learned
technique." Saying this, she sits
up suddenly and places, not
claps, her hands together.
"Organic," she repeats, half to
herself, "that's important. I
must remember to speak to my
students about that."
"Inga speaks often and
eloquently to us about dance,"
says Allison Potter, an
undergraduate in Weiss's
intermediate dance class. "She's
very articulate really, but she
rarely says much about her own
amazing past. In terms of
professional dance, she's done
everything."
When talking about her
"amazing past," Weiss's voice
slows to an adagio. She speaks
hesitantly, offering only a few
glimpses of her childhood in
Germany and her career as a
professional dancer. The dates
are left out, the chronology
vague.
'Amazing Past'
Weiss, a native of Bavaria,
says she cannot remember a time
when she did not dance. Her
hand pats the head of an
imagined toddler as she says,"I
must have danced since I was
this high."
There were composers and
musicians in her family. Her
father, she recalls, played the
violin.
Weiss remembers her school
days in Germany during World
War II as a time of great stress
and hardship. "If that gruesome
time had any beneficial effects
on me, it was that it
strengthened me."
At a school "much like the
high school of performing arts in
New York City" she studied
dance forms ranging from opera

and classical ballet to gymnastics
and modern dance. "Probably,
the teachers I had in those early
years, whose names I don't even
remember, had as much
influence on me, by helping me
to love dance, as the famous
choreographers and dancers I
studied with later."
Wigman Influence
"Of all my teachers, though,
Mary Wigman had the greatest
impact on me." Mary Wigman,
in Europe, attained a fame and
influence in modern dance
comparable to that of Martha
Graham in this country.
"Wigman was," Weiss recalls, "a

great lady of dance and an
enlightening choreographer."
Weiss was a leading dancer in
the Mary Wigman Dance Group
in Berlin, a soloist in the Dance
Company at the National
Theater in Mannheim, and
performed solo recitals of her
own work in over 80 cities in
Europe.

'She is beautiful even when she
walks....Everything she does is done
flawlessly and with integrity.'

She perferred concert
performances to lavish theatrical
productions. "Concert dancing is
purer, like chamber music," she
says.
After performing for many
years in Europe, Weiss came to
America to teach. She considers
herself "very fortunate" to have
been introduced to American
dance "on the top floor."
With the Greatest
She taught at Connecticut
College at a time when some of
the greatest names in modern
dance were assembled there.
' 'Graham, [ Merce ]
Cunningham, [Jose] Limon,
[Doris] Humphrey, they were
all on the faculty at Connecticut
then. It was a priceless
experience for me and a time of
historic innovation for American
dance."
American dance today, Weiss
feels, "is very exciting.... There
is much being done and explored
by many young companies.
"The danger I see is that too
many young dancers mistake
device for innovation and strain
to be shocking or original.
Dance, like any true art, must
touch the audience honestly, not
with devices or sensationalism."
Weiss believes this use of
sensationalism springs from the
reliance of dancers on customers
for financial support. She
believes that the American
university must assume the
responsibility as patron of the
arts that the national
government takes in Europe.
Dance 'Mushrooming'
Although she feels American
universities have far to go in
realizing this responsibility,
Weiss notes with satisfaction that
dance programs are "springing
up like mushrooms" on
campuses across the country.
Weiss has been instrumental
in building an increasingly
popular dance program here. She
is pleased with the growing
interest in dance but worries
about being able to keep classes
small. "The studio is full from
morning to night," she says with

both pride and concern.
And from morning to night,
Weiss is running between dance
classes and administrative
deskwork. Besides heading the
undergraduate modern dance
program, Weiss is adviser for a
graduate program in
contemporary dance, which she
established single-handedly

through the Education
School.
Jancy Limpert, a student in
the program, says she would not
be in dance "if it weren't for
Inga. Dancing with Inga is a
spiritual experience. Nothing is
pure technique. Everything

"The danger I see is that too
many young dancers mistake
device for innovation and strain
to be shocking or original.
Dance, like any true art, must
touch the audience honestly, not
with devices or sensationalism."
Weiss believes this use of
sensationalism springs from the
reliance of dancers on customers
for financial support. She
believes that the American
university must assume the
responsibility as patron of the
arts that the national
government takes in Europe.
Dance 'Mushrooming'
Although she feels American
universities have far to go in
realizing this responsibility,
Weiss notes with satisfaction that
dance programs are "springing
up like mushrooms" on
campuses across the country.
Weiss has been instrumental
in building an increasingly
popular dance program here. She
is pleased with the growing
interest in dance but worries
about being able to keep classes
small. "The studio is full from
morning to night," she says with

both pride and concern.
And from morning to night,
Weiss is running between dance
classes and administrative
deskwork. Besides heading the
undergraduate modern dance
program, Weiss is adviser for a
graduate program in
contemporary dance, which she
established single-handedly

through the Education
School.
Jancy Limpert, a student in
the program, says she would not
be in dance "if it weren't for
Inga. Dancing with Inga is a
spiritual experience. Nothing is
pure technique. Everything
comes from deep inside."
"Dance must come from

within you," Weiss often tells
her students. She insists that the
motivation for dance be from
"inner conviction" and not for
visual effect.
"Students come to the dance
studio not to perform but to get
in touch with their bodies and
minds. My students and I share
moments of dance that are
spontaneous and can never be
captured on stage."
Does she miss the stage?
"It has been a long life in
dance," she answers softly. "My
experience on the stage is
priceless, but there is no need to
talk about it too much. You
know, it is only when you stop
performing that you can stop
focusing on yourself and begin
to really look at what other
people are doing." The palms of
her hands, lying on her knee,
turn toward the ceiling and her
face opens in a smile. "I no
longer dance for applause. I am a

NO GIMMICKS—Inga Weiss (center) believes that dance should be
"organic," and spring from the inner motivation of the dancer.
Here, she dances with students during a Dance Workshop in 1969.
Welcoming you into her
office with a gracious nod of her
head or leaping deer-like across
the dance floor, Inga Weiss
emanates dignity and control.
The grand dame of the
modern dance program here for
13 years, Weiss has inspired an
admiration in her students and
peers that approaches awe.
"She is beautiful even when
she walks," says Diana Crosby, a
graduate student in dance
education, "Though, of course,
she's not conscious of it.
"Inga is never late," Crosby
whispers, as her teacher glides to
the front of the Roble dance
studio. "Everything she does is
done flawlessly and with
integrity."
Susan Cashion, who also
teaches dance here, calls Weiss
"a master teacher. To everyone
who knows her, Inga has the aura
of a heroine."
The heroine sits in her office,
crossing her long legs at the
ankles. She smoothes a wayward
strand of blond hair off her
forehead and with wide, gray
eyes looks directly at the
interviewer.
Students Come First
"Of course," she says with a
soft German accent, she is
"delighted" to be interviewed.
But, she adds with a slight shrug
of her narrow shoulders, she
must soon get back to her
students.
Weiss speaks of her students
with warm, unreserved affection.
Opening and rounding her arms,
as if to embrace someone, she
says, "My students are, in a way,
my family. I learn as much from
them as they learn from me."
"They are so inquisitive and
enthusiastic. Having no
preconceived idea of technique,
they are willing to explore."

Dance, like any true art, must touch
the audience honestly / not with
devices or sensationalism.'

Exploration of "all the
possibilities of movement" is
something Weiss strives for in
her classes. Elbow resting on the
piano in the dance studio,
watching her students turn and
slide across the floor, Weiss
never tells a student, "That is
incorrect."
'Interesting' Moves
Rather, she uses the
variations of individuals to
demonstrate the range of
possibilities. "That's very
interesting," is a favorite
comment of hers. "That's not
what we're doing, but that's very
interesting."

Each individual's style, Weiss
believes, must be discovered and
fostered. "Dance is something
organic and not a learned
technique." Saying this, she sits
up suddenly and places, not
claps, her hands together.
"Organic," she repeats, half to
herself, "that's important. I
must remember to speak to my
students about that."
"Inga speaks often and
eloquently to us about dance,"
says Allison Potter, an
undergraduate in Weiss's
intermediate dance class. "She's
very articulate really, but she
rarely says much about her own
amazing past. In terms of
professional dance, she's done
everything."
When talking about her
"amazing past," Weiss's voice
slows to an adagio. She speaks
hesitantly, offering only a few
glimpses of her childhood in
Germany and her career as a
professional dancer. The dates
are left out, the chronology
vague.
'Amazing Past'
Weiss, a native of Bavaria,
says she cannot remember a time
when she did not dance. Her
hand pats the head of an
imagined toddler as she says,"I
must have danced since I was
this high."
There were composers and
musicians in her family. Her
father, she recalls, played the
violin.
Weiss remembers her school
days in Germany during World
War II as a time of great stress
and hardship. "If that gruesome
time had any beneficial effects
on me, it was that it
strengthened me."
At a school "much like the
high school of performing arts in
New York City" she studied
dance forms ranging from opera

and classical ballet to gymnastics
and modern dance. "Probably,
the teachers I had in those early
years, whose names I don't even
remember, had as much
influence on me, by helping me
to love dance, as the famous
choreographers and dancers I
studied with later."
Wigman Influence
"Of all my teachers, though,
Mary Wigman had the greatest
impact on me." Mary Wigman,
in Europe, attained a fame and
influence in modern dance
comparable to that of Martha
Graham in this country.
"Wigman was," Weiss recalls, "a

great lady of dance and an
enlightening choreographer."
Weiss was a leading dancer in
the Mary Wigman Dance Group
in Berlin, a soloist in the Dance
Company at the National
Theater in Mannheim, and
performed solo recitals of her
own work in over 80 cities in
Europe.

'She is beautiful even when she
walks....Everything she does is done
flawlessly and with integrity.'

She perferred concert
performances to lavish theatrical
productions. "Concert dancing is
purer, like chamber music," she
says.
After performing for many
years in Europe, Weiss came to
America to teach. She considers
herself "very fortunate" to have
been introduced to American
dance "on the top floor."
With the Greatest
She taught at Connecticut
College at a time when some of
the greatest names in modern
dance were assembled there.
' 'Graham, [ Merce ]
Cunningham, [Jose] Limon,
[Doris] Humphrey, they were
all on the faculty at Connecticut
then. It was a priceless
experience for me and a time of
historic innovation for American
dance."
American dance today, Weiss
feels, "is very exciting.... There
is much being done and explored
by many young companies.
"The danger I see is that too
many young dancers mistake
device for innovation and strain
to be shocking or original.
Dance, like any true art, must

"Wigman was," Weiss recalls, "a

great lady of dance and an
enlightening choreographer."
Weiss was a leading dancer in
the Mary Wigman Dance Group
in Berlin, a soloist in the Dance
Company at the National
Theater in Mannheim, and
performed solo recitals of her
own work in over 80 cities in
Europe.

'She is beautiful even when she
walks....Everything she does is done
flawlessly and with integrity.'

She perferred concert
performances to lavish theatrical
productions. "Concert dancing is
purer, like chamber music," she
says.
After performing for many
years in Europe, Weiss came to
America to teach. She considers
herself "very fortunate" to have
been introduced to American
dance "on the top floor."
With the Greatest
She taught at Connecticut
College at a time when some of
the greatest names in modern
dance were assembled there.
' 'Graham, [ Merce ]
Cunningham, [Jose] Limon,
[Doris] Humphrey, they were
all on the faculty at Connecticut
then. It was a priceless
experience for me and a time of
historic innovation for American
dance."
American dance today, Weiss
feels, "is very exciting.... There
is much being done and explored
by many young companies.
"The danger I see is that too
many young dancers mistake
device for innovation and strain
to be shocking or original.
Dance, like any true art, must
touch the audience honestly, not
with devices or sensationalism."
Weiss believes this use of
sensationalism springs from the
reliance of dancers on customers
for financial support. She
believes that the American
university must assume the
responsibility as patron of the
arts that the national
government takes in Europe.
Dance 'Mushrooming'
Although she feels American
universities have far to go in
realizing this responsibility,
Weiss notes with satisfaction that
dance programs are "springing
up like mushrooms" on
campuses across the country.
Weiss has been instrumental
in building an increasingly
popular dance program here. She
is pleased with the growing
interest in dance but worries
about being able to keep classes
small. "The studio is full from
morning to night," she says with

both pride and concern.
And from morning to night,
Weiss is running between dance
classes and administrative
deskwork. Besides heading the
undergraduate modern dance
program, Weiss is adviser for a
graduate program in
contemporary dance, which she
established single-handedly

through the Education
School.
Jancy Limpert, a student in
the program, says she would not
be in dance "if it weren't for
Inga. Dancing with Inga is a
spiritual experience. Nothing is
pure technique. Everything
comes from deep inside."
"Dance must come from

within you," Weiss often tells
her students. She insists that the
motivation for dance be from
"inner conviction" and not for
visual effect.
"Students come to the dance
studio not to perform but to get
in touch with their bodies and
minds. My students and I share
moments of dance that are
spontaneous and can never be
captured on stage."
Does she miss the stage?
"It has been a long life in
dance," she answers softly. "My
experience on the stage is
priceless, but there is no need to
talk about it too much. You
know, it is only when you stop
performing that you can stop
focusing on yourself and begin
to really look at what other
people are doing." The palms of
her hands, lying on her knee,
turn toward the ceiling and her
face opens in a smile. "I no
longer dance for applause. I am a
teacher now."

NO GIMMICKS—Inga Weiss (center) believes that dance should be
"organic," and spring from the inner motivation of the dancer.
Here, she dances with students during a Dance Workshop in 1969.
Welcoming you into her
office with a gracious nod of her
head or leaping deer-like across
the dance floor, Inga Weiss
emanates dignity and control.
The grand dame of the
modern dance program here for
13 years, Weiss has inspired an
admiration in her students and
peers that approaches awe.
"She is beautiful even when
she walks," says Diana Crosby, a
graduate student in dance
education, "Though, of course,
she's not conscious of it.
"Inga is never late," Crosby
whispers, as her teacher glides to
the front of the Roble dance
studio. "Everything she does is
done flawlessly and with
integrity."
Susan Cashion, who also
teaches dance here, calls Weiss
"a master teacher. To everyone
who knows her, Inga has the aura
of a heroine."
The heroine sits in her office,
crossing her long legs at the
ankles. She smoothes a wayward
strand of blond hair off her
forehead and with wide, gray
eyes looks directly at the
interviewer.
Students Come First
"Of course," she says with a
soft German accent, she is
"delighted" to be interviewed.
But, she adds with a slight shrug
of her narrow shoulders, she
must soon get back to her
students.
Weiss speaks of her students
with warm, unreserved affection.
Opening and rounding her arms,
as if to embrace someone, she
says, "My students are, in a way,
my family. I learn as much from
them as they learn from me."
"They are so inquisitive and
enthusiastic. Having no
preconceived idea of technique,
they are willing to explore."

Dance, like any true art, must touch
the audience honestly / not with
devices or sensationalism.'

Exploration of "all the
possibilities of movement" is
something Weiss strives for in
her classes. Elbow resting on the
piano in the dance studio,
watching her students turn and
slide across the floor, Weiss
never tells a student, "That is
incorrect."
'Interesting' Moves
Rather, she uses the
variations of individuals to
demonstrate the range of
possibilities. "That's very
interesting," is a favorite
comment of hers. "That's not
what we're doing, but that's very
interesting."

Each individual's style, Weiss
believes, must be discovered and
fostered. "Dance is something
organic and not a learned
technique." Saying this, she sits
up suddenly and places, not
claps, her hands together.
"Organic," she repeats, half to
herself, "that's important. I
must remember to speak to my
students about that."
"Inga speaks often and
eloquently to us about dance,"
says Allison Potter, an
undergraduate in Weiss's
intermediate dance class. "She's
very articulate really, but she
rarely says much about her own
amazing past. In terms of
professional dance, she's done
everything."
When talking about her
"amazing past," Weiss's voice
slows to an adagio. She speaks
hesitantly, offering only a few
glimpses of her childhood in
Germany and her career as a
professional dancer. The dates
are left out, the chronology
vague.
'Amazing Past'
Weiss, a native of Bavaria,
says she cannot remember a time
when she did not dance. Her
hand pats the head of an
imagined toddler as she says,"I
must have danced since I was
this high."
There were composers and
musicians in her family. Her
father, she recalls, played the
violin.
Weiss remembers her school
days in Germany during World
War II as a time of great stress
and hardship. "If that gruesome
time had any beneficial effects
on me, it was that it
strengthened me."
At a school "much like the
high school of performing arts in
New York City" she studied
dance forms ranging from opera

and classical ballet to gymnastics
and modern dance. "Probably,
the teachers I had in those early
years, whose names I don't even
remember, had as much
influence on me, by helping me
to love dance, as the famous
choreographers and dancers I
studied with later."
Wigman Influence
"Of all my teachers, though,
Mary Wigman had the greatest
impact on me." Mary Wigman,
in Europe, attained a fame and
influence in modern dance
comparable to that of Martha
Graham in this country.
"Wigman was," Weiss recalls, "a

great lady of dance and an
enlightening choreographer."
Weiss was a leading dancer in
the Mary Wigman Dance Group
in Berlin, a soloist in the Dance
