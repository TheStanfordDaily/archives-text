The deGuerre pool complex is a marvelous
addition to the campus. I understand that
classes and team activities have priority use
of the pools, and also that it costs money to
keep the pool open, etc. But as the weather
gets nicer, and the days get longer, why
can't the pool be more accessible for
recreational swimming? What about
swimming in the early evening? Also, what
will the summer hours be? —A.S.
1 would like to know why there are no
hairdryers in the women's section of the de
Guerre pool. Even a coin-operated dryer
would be greatly appreciated. —M.P.
Why is there no Coke machine at the new
pool complex? —H.S.
The present hours for recreational
swimming are pretty flexible, according to
Stu Rowe, aquatics instructor at the pool.
The official hours — from 12 to 2 Monday
through Friday, and 1-5 on Saturday and
Sunday — can be extended, depending on
pool space. For example, the pool is often
open as early as 10 a.m. on MWF and 11 on
TTh. Rowe advised that you simply come
down and try getting in early.
Unfortunately, the evening hours are
pretty much taken. Intramural water polo
practices in the evenings; so do the varsity
water polo and swim teams.
This summer the pool will be open to
faculty, staff and students from 12 to 2. From
2 to 6, the pod will be open to people with
swim cards, which cost $2.50 weekly or $10
for the season. However, if you get to the
pool between 12 and 2 you can stay there
till 6, even if you dor.'t have a swim card.
The absence of hairdryers was an

unfortunate oversight, according to Wes
Ruff, physical education director. No
provisions for dryers were made in the
basic wiring of the facility, which means
that hairdryers would cost $150 apiece at
this point. Ruff also pointed out that the
$150 hairdryers would have to be installed
in both the men's and women's sections —
making them financially unfeasible.
However, the lack of a Coke machine
was a deliberate move, Ruff said. The pool
staff doesn't want to contend with the
problems that soft drinks inevitably bring —
breakage, spills, ants, etc. So the pool will
remain Coke-less and clean.

Why doesn't anyone try to deter or wipe
out the hideous weed growth in otherwise
beautiful Lake Lagunita? Ugly rumors are
around that some clowns in the bio
department insist that the weeds are rare in
North America and should be preserved. Is
that incredibly absurd rationale true? If so,
what measures can friends and I take to rid
unfortunate Lake Lag of those fiendish
plants ourselves? — N.R.B.
The fiendish plants, known colloquially
as "smart weeds" and scientifically as
polygonum are neither rare nor worthy of
preservation, according to Andy Anderson,
director of Plant Services. "They're
considered by the horticulture people as a
very obnoxious kind of weed," he said.
In fact, biology professors from
UC-Davis have journeyed to Stanford to
observe the weeds and suggest control

methods. Last fall the Plant Services
department disced (cut up) the ground in
the dry lakebed several times to try to kill
the rysomes. Obviously, that didn't work
too well.
"I was just up there this afternoon
observing those weeds," said Anderson
"Whatever we used last summer, there's no
point in using it again this summer....
Really, there are more weeds this year4;han
last."
Chemicals that can be used in Lake Lag
are resticted because of the eventual seepage
of the water into the Bay. "At the present
time we know of no means of control that
would not send forbidden chemicals into
the Bay," Anderson said.
However, a new approved product —
casoran — did come out last summer,
according to Anderson. Unfortunately, the
chemical could not be delivered until
January — after the lake was, full.
Consequently, Plant Services will test the
product for the first time this summer on a
small part of the lakebed. Should they
decide to treat the entire bed in the summer
of 1976, it will cost almost $4000.
Do supermarkets put covers on their
freezers at night? —K.P.
No, the design of the freezers makes this
unnecessary, and even impractical,
according to an employee of Purity. The
cold air in the freezers circulates across the
top of the merchandise, holding warm air
out. A cover would simply push warm air in
and interrupt circulation, he said.

casoran — did come out last summer,
according to Anderson. Unfortunately, the
chemical could not be delivered until
January — after the lake was, full.
Consequently, Plant Services will test the
product for the first time this summer on a
small part of the lakebed. Should they
decide to treat the entire bed in the summer
of 1976, it will cost almost $4000.
Do supermarkets put covers on their
freezers at night? —K.P.
No, the design of the freezers makes this
unnecessary, and even impractical,
according to an employee of Purity. The
cold air in the freezers circulates across the
top of the merchandise, holding warm air
out. A cover would simply push warm air in
and interrupt circulation, he said.


The deGuerre pool complex is a marvelous
addition to the campus. I understand that
classes and team activities have priority use
of the pools, and also that it costs money to
keep the pool open, etc. But as the weather
gets nicer, and the days get longer, why
can't the pool be more accessible for
recreational swimming? What about
swimming in the early evening? Also, what
will the summer hours be? —A.S.
1 would like to know why there are no
hairdryers in the women's section of the de
Guerre pool. Even a coin-operated dryer
would be greatly appreciated. —M.P.
Why is there no Coke machine at the new
pool complex? —H.S.
The present hours for recreational
swimming are pretty flexible, according to
Stu Rowe, aquatics instructor at the pool.
The official hours — from 12 to 2 Monday
through Friday, and 1-5 on Saturday and
Sunday — can be extended, depending on
pool space. For example, the pool is often
open as early as 10 a.m. on MWF and 11 on
TTh. Rowe advised that you simply come
down and try getting in early.
Unfortunately, the evening hours are
pretty much taken. Intramural water polo
practices in the evenings; so do the varsity
water polo and swim teams.
This summer the pool will be open to
faculty, staff and students from 12 to 2. From
2 to 6, the pod will be open to people with
swim cards, which cost $2.50 weekly or $10
for the season. However, if you get to the
pool between 12 and 2 you can stay there
till 6, even if you dor.'t have a swim card.
The absence of hairdryers was an

unfortunate oversight, according to Wes
Ruff, physical education director. No
provisions for dryers were made in the
basic wiring of the facility, which means
that hairdryers would cost $150 apiece at
this point. Ruff also pointed out that the
$150 hairdryers would have to be installed
in both the men's and women's sections —
making them financially unfeasible.
However, the lack of a Coke machine
was a deliberate move, Ruff said. The pool
staff doesn't want to contend with the
problems that soft drinks inevitably bring —
breakage, spills, ants, etc. So the pool will
remain Coke-less and clean.

Why doesn't anyone try to deter or wipe
out the hideous weed growth in otherwise
beautiful Lake Lagunita? Ugly rumors are
around that some clowns in the bio
department insist that the weeds are rare in
North America and should be preserved. Is
that incredibly absurd rationale true? If so,
what measures can friends and I take to rid
unfortunate Lake Lag of those fiendish
plants ourselves? — N.R.B.
The fiendish plants, known colloquially
as "smart weeds" and scientifically as
polygonum are neither rare nor worthy of
preservation, according to Andy Anderson,
director of Plant Services. "They're
considered by the horticulture people as a
very obnoxious kind of weed," he said.
In fact, biology professors from
UC-Davis have journeyed to Stanford to
observe the weeds and suggest control

methods. Last fall the Plant Services
department disced (cut up) the ground in
the dry lakebed several times to try to kill
the rysomes. Obviously, that didn't work
too well.
"I was just up there this afternoon
observing those weeds," said Anderson
"Whatever we used last summer, there's no
point in using it again this summer....
Really, there are more weeds this year4;han
last."
Chemicals that can be used in Lake Lag
are resticted because of the eventual seepage
of the water into the Bay. "At the present
time we know of no means of control that
would not send forbidden chemicals into
the Bay," Anderson said.

observe the weeds and suggest control

methods. Last fall the Plant Services
department disced (cut up) the ground in
the dry lakebed several times to try to kill
the rysomes. Obviously, that didn't work
too well.
"I was just up there this afternoon
observing those weeds," said Anderson
"Whatever we used last summer, there's no
point in using it again this summer....
Really, there are more weeds this year4;han
last."
Chemicals that can be used in Lake Lag
are resticted because of the eventual seepage
of the water into the Bay. "At the present
time we know of no means of control that
would not send forbidden chemicals into
the Bay," Anderson said.
However, a new approved product —
casoran — did come out last summer,
according to Anderson. Unfortunately, the
chemical could not be delivered until
January — after the lake was, full.
Consequently, Plant Services will test the
product for the first time this summer on a
small part of the lakebed. Should they
decide to treat the entire bed in the summer
of 1976, it will cost almost $4000.
Do supermarkets put covers on their
freezers at night? —K.P.
No, the design of the freezers makes this
unnecessary, and even impractical,
according to an employee of Purity. The
cold air in the freezers circulates across the
top of the merchandise, holding warm air
out. A cover would simply push warm air in
and interrupt circulation, he said.
