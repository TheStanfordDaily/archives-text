Diplomat Meets With Fafhet Lao
VIENTIANE, Laos — The top U.S. diplomat in Laos
met with two communist Pathet Lao ministers yesterday
night in an attempt to end the student occupation of the
American aid compound and win the release of two
Marines and a civilian caught inside.
"The situation is cooling," said U.S. Charge d'Affaires
Christian Chapman after the meeting. "Negotiations are
still going on. They are going back to see the prime
minister at a cabinet meeting...."
The students told newsmen they had offered to release
the three Americans if they would "surrender" but all
three refused.
SLA Witness: Others Murdered Foster
SACRAMENTO — A Berkeley fruit stand owner
rocked the Marcus Foster murder trial yesterday by saying
Nancy Ling Perry told him she and two other Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) members killed Foster.
Rudolph Henderson, 48, who owns "Fruity Rudy"
mobile food stands, told the Superior Court jury that
Perry confessed about a week after the Nov. 6, 1973,
slaying of the Oakland school superintendent.
Joseph Remiro and Russell Little are on trial in the
case, but Henderson said Perry named two other SLA
members, Willie Wolfe and Donald "Cinque" DeFreeze, as
her partners.
On the last day of defense testimony, Henderson said
at first was a regular customer of his Berkeley stand,
then became an employee, and then his girlfriend. About
a day after Foster was killed, he said, he asked her if she
had been involved.
"She first said 'no' and kind of smiled, but when you
know a person, you know when they don't mean no,"
Henderson testified.
About a week later, he said, he read in a newspaper
that one of the assailants may have been a woman and
told Perry he thought she was the one.
"She said, 'Yeah, it was me,' " the short, slender

witness said in a quiet, matter-of-fact voice, as Remiro and
Little listened from the defense table.
"I told her I thought it was stupid and the two guys
who were with her were stupid. She said Willie was far
from being stupid and Cinq was wise in the ways of the
street."
Ford To Run "Vigorous* Campaign
WASHINGTON — President Ford told Republican
senators yesterday he will run a vigorous campaign 'for the
presidency next year and carry a strong and constructive
program to the people.
Sen. Hugh Scott, (R-Pa.) told newsmen of the
President's intention and predicted Ford would win
election for a four-year term. He also said he does not
expect Ford to have any substantive challenge within the
Republican party and "with a few exceptions, the present
Democratic candidates are a parade of pygmies."
Grocery Costs Rose In April
WASHINGTON — Inflation quickened a bit in April as
sharply higher meat prices drove grocery costs up after
two straight months of decline, the Labor Department
reported yesterday.
The overall rise in consumer prices last month was
six-tenths of one percent after adjustment for normal
seasonal fluctations. Although double the March pace, this
was well below the torrid monthly increases typical during
1974.

Perry confessed about a week after the Nov. 6, 1973,
slaying of the Oakland school superintendent.
Joseph Remiro and Russell Little are on trial in the
case, but Henderson said Perry named two other SLA
members, Willie Wolfe and Donald "Cinque" DeFreeze, as
her partners.
On the last day of defense testimony, Henderson said
at first was a regular customer of his Berkeley stand,
then became an employee, and then his girlfriend. About
a day after Foster was killed, he said, he asked her if she
had been involved.
"She first said 'no' and kind of smiled, but when you
know a person, you know when they don't mean no,"
Henderson testified.
About a week later, he said, he read in a newspaper
that one of the assailants may have been a woman and
told Perry he thought she was the one.
"She said, 'Yeah, it was me,' " the short, slender

witness said in a quiet, matter-of-fact voice, as Remiro and
Little listened from the defense table.
"I told her I thought it was stupid and the two guys
who were with her were stupid. She said Willie was far
from being stupid and Cinq was wise in the ways of the
street."

sharply higher meat prices drove grocery costs up after
two straight months of decline, the Labor Department

The overall rise in consumer prices last month was

seasonal fluctations. Although double the March pace, this
was well below the torrid monthly increases typical during
1974.
