# McCloskey Undecided On Political Future
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
First of Two Parts
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) skirted the issue of his political
future in an interview yesterday saying
there was only a 50-50 chance that he
might run for reelection in 1976.
"I haven't really made that decision
yet," he told the Daily. "Right now I'm
working on energy and law-of-the-sea
legislation and I would like to finish
these two things before this session is
over."
McCloskey said that he didn't
believe he would run for the U.S.
Senate next year. He added that he
had been considering going back into
private law practice at the end of this
term.
The eight-year congressman denied
that his decision would be influenced
by the probable announcement of
former ASSU President David Harris
to run in the Democratic primary for
McCloskey's seat.
"Actually," he laughed, "I would
rather welcome the chance to debate
David Harris again.
Blocking Reagan
However, McCloskey said he would
direct most of his political energies
next year to blocking the Republican
presidential nomination of Ronald
Reagan.
"If Ford decided not to run, there's
a 99 and 44/100 percent chance that
Reagan will get the nomination," he

predicted, adding that "it would be a
disaster for the Republican Party in
California" if that happened.
Noting that George Wallace is the
current Democratic presidential
frontrunner, McCloskey remarked if it
came down to a choice between
Reagan and Wallace, he would
spearhead a third party movement.
"I do not want to see four years of
either the Reagan or Wallace
philosophies governing this country,"
he said. "But a Reagan-Wallace race is a
very real possibility. This is why I'm
supporting Ford."
He defended his hiring last week of
Egil (Bud) Krogh, former head of the
White House "plumbers" unit. Krogh
pleaded guilty in 1973 to the 1971
break-in of the office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
He served four-and-a-half months.
'White Slaver'
McCloskey said he "felt like a white
slaver" for hiring Krogh, because
he was getting "the best lawyer on
Capitol Hill for one-fourth of what he
[Krogh] would make in private
practice."
McCloskey called Krogh "a
beautiful human being with
tremendous abilities." Citing Krogh's
refusal to use national security as a
defense for his actions, McCloskey said
this destroyed the cases of the other
Watergate defendants and contributed
to their convictions.

pleaded guilty in 1973 to the 1971
break-in of the office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
He served four-and-a-half months.
'White Slaver'
McCloskey said he "felt like a white
slaver" for hiring Krogh, because
he was getting "the best lawyer on
Capitol Hill for one-fourth of what he
[Krogh] would make in private
practice."
McCloskey called Krogh "a
beautiful human being with
tremendous abilities." Citing Krogh's
refusal to use national security as a
defense for his actions, McCloskey said
this destroyed the cases of the other
Watergate defendants and contributed
to their convictions.
First of Two Parts
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) skirted the issue of his political
future in an interview yesterday saying
there was only a 50-50 chance that he
might run for reelection in 1976.
"I haven't really made that decision
yet," he told the Daily. "Right now I'm
working on energy and law-of-the-sea
legislation and I would like to finish
these two things before this session is
over."
McCloskey said that he didn't
believe he would run for the U.S.
Senate next year. He added that he
had been considering going back into
private law practice at the end of this
term.
The eight-year congressman denied
that his decision would be influenced
by the probable announcement of
former ASSU President David Harris
to run in the Democratic primary for
McCloskey's seat.
"Actually," he laughed, "I would
rather welcome the chance to debate
David Harris again.
Blocking Reagan
However, McCloskey said he would
direct most of his political energies
next year to blocking the Republican
presidential nomination of Ronald
Reagan.
"If Ford decided not to run, there's
a 99 and 44/100 percent chance that
Reagan will get the nomination," he

predicted, adding that "it would be a
disaster for the Republican Party in
California" if that happened.
Noting that George Wallace is the
current Democratic presidential
frontrunner, McCloskey remarked if it
came down to a choice between
Reagan and Wallace, he would
spearhead a third party movement.
"I do not want to see four years of
either the Reagan or Wallace
philosophies governing this country,"
he said. "But a Reagan-Wallace race is a
very real possibility. This is why I'm
supporting Ford."
He defended his hiring last week of
Egil (Bud) Krogh, former head of the
White House "plumbers" unit. Krogh
pleaded guilty in 1973 to the 1971
break-in of the office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
He served four-and-a-half months.
