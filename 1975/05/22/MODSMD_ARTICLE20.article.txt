UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. -
Diplomats predict that the arrival of
Harvard professor and Stanford
commencement speaker Daniel
Patrick Moynihan as chief U.S.
delegate to the United Nations will
mean livelier debates and an end to the
low profile the United States has
recently maintained in the world
organization.
President Ford yesterday
nominated Moynihan, 48, to replace
former newsman John A. Scali, who
had been the chief American delegate
since 1973.
Moynihan, a Democrat who was an
adviser to President Nixon and then
Nixon's ambassador to India, is
expected to arrive at U.N.
headquarters about July 1. The White
House said Scali is being offered
"another senior foreign policy
position," but Scali said he is also
considering "several opportunities to
return to private life."
"There's no question that
Moynihan will cause some sparks to
fly in the General Assembly, and it
could be a good thing," an Arab
ambassador told a reporter. "Scali was
careful not to offend, and that was a
good thing, too, but there's no
question Moynihan is going to
stimulate the assembly by injecting
some passion into the proceedings.''
Moynihan proposed a new
American attitude at the United
Nations in an article "The United
States in Opposition" in the March

issue of Commentary.
He said it was "a massive failure of
American diplomacy" for the United
States to acquiesce in or fail to
challenge arguments of the new
nations with which it disagreed.
He said new nations should be
treated as equals. That means, he said,
that the United States should go into
vigorous opposition and argue its own
principles "directly, loudly,
forcefully" at international forums.
It is unlikely that Moynihan can
speak out any more forcefully than
Scali did in what turned out to be a
farewell speech to the General
Assembly. In an address last
December, he charged that the
assembly had come under a "tyranny
of the majority" and was adopting
unrealistic resolutions that had no
chance of being carried out.
Moynihan will speak on "The
Future of Higher Education" at
graduation ceremonies on June 15.
