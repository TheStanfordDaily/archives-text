# Unhampered By Somber Economy
## Fund Campaign On Schedule 
### TONY DELLING 
University officials remain
optimistic that the five-year Campaign
for Stanford fundraising program will
achieve its goal of $300 million by the
target date of spring 1977, despite the
somber economic climate in the
United States.
Trustee Richard Guggenheim,
campaign co-chairman, said,
"Considering it's been a tough
economic year, we're doing very well."
He added that the $300 million mark
was still "definitely attainable,"
although he conceded that fundraising
"will be a little tougher in the future."
David Fulton, director of
communications in the General
Secretary's Office, said he felt the
campaign was "on schedule," having
raised so far approximately $190

million. Fulton said he was "optimistic
about the goal being reached in the
next two years. We expect to make
it."
Inaugurated in April, 1972, the
Campaign for Stanford is a
fundraising program over and above
the year-to-year soliciting efforts of
the Annual Fund, a perpetual recipient
of donations to the University.
Construction Funds
Of the $300 million, the campaign
aims to allocate $125 million to
increase the University's endowment,
$92 million to underwrite current
operating expenses and $83 million to
finance construction of new buildings.
Funds raised by the campaign have
made possible the construction of the
new Law School, the Terman
Engineering Center, the Fairchild

Neurosciences Center, and the
deGuerre pools and courts. Other gifts
to the campaign have also supported
over 30 endowed professorships and a
number of scholarship, fellowship and
loan funds.
Although building costs have
skyrocketed since 1972 and the
University's endowment has suffered
because of the stock market decline,
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger "was not
aware" of any plans to alter the target
allocations of the campaign. "If we fall
short of funds, things just won't get
built," said Augsburger.
Vice Provost for Budget and
Planning Raymond Bacchetti also said
he did not know of any plans to
change the objectives of the campaign.
