# Calls U.S. 'Sick, Corrupt'
## Abernathy Demands Justice 
### CHRISTY WISE 
"Almost 200 years have gone by
and we haven't found liberty; we're
still searching for justice," said the Rev.
Ralph Abernathy last night. "America
must get right, America must do right.
We are no longer begging for it, but
demanding it,"he added.
Abernathy, speaking to about 100
people in Memorial Church,
emphasized the need to "build a
lasting memorial to Kent State,
Jackson State, South Carolina State
and countless others who have given
their lives in this struggle."
Building the memorial does not
mean dedicating buildings and
monuments in memory of these
people, said the civil rights leader.
"We've got to right the wrongs in this
sick, corrupt nation of ours and bring
about justice for all people," he stated.
Abernathy replaced Julian Bond in
the third annual Kent State/Jackson
State Memorial Lecture, sponsored
this year by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau. Bond was hospitalized
Monday with kidney trouble.
Abernathy, who co-founded the
Southern Christian Leadership

Conference with Martin
Luther King, Jr., urged that when the
governing body is insensitive to
people's needs, it is "incumbent on the
governed to change the government."
'No Right'
"We have no right to gather in this
church or in any other church to pay
tribute to those who gave their all
unless we are willing to go to Pharoah
Ford and let God's people go," said
Abernathy.
The pastor criticized expenditure of
tax dollars on Vietnam and moon
projects, claiming that "we are worse
off now than in the 19305."
"I used to think a funeral parlor
was the saddest place in the world,"
said Abernathy. "Not any more.
People in the funeral parlor look
happy compared to people in the
grocery store."
Instead of financing former
Vice President Spiro Agnew's tours to
pass out moon rocks, Abernathy
suggested that administration "should
have been in the ghettos, in the cotton
fields or in thfc Bay Area passing out
bread to hungry people."
Killings
Abernathy recalled many instances
of killings and repression he has
encountered in his civil rights struggle,
including the dynamiting of his own
house and personal physical abuse.
Last week he received a post card in
the mail from "Whitey" suggesting
that blacks should be supplied with
money for boats to travel to Africa.
"How are you going to go back to
where you have never been?" asked
Abernathy. "I'm proud of Africa —
the home of my ancestors, but
America is my home."
Until the English, French, German,
Irish and many others are returned to
their countries, and "until the white
man gives America back to the
Indians," said Abernathy, "the black
man is here to stay."
Dan Brenner, founder of the Kent
State/Jackson State Memorial Lecture
series, introduced Abernathy with
descriptions of the killings at Kent,
Ohio and Jackson, Mississippi. He
reminded the audience that "the
concerns of student protests were not
frivolous rites of spring."

demanding it,"he added.
Abernathy, speaking to about 100
people in Memorial Church,
emphasized the need to "build a
lasting memorial to Kent State,
Jackson State, South Carolina State
and countless others who have given
their lives in this struggle."
Building the memorial does not
mean dedicating buildings and
monuments in memory of these
people, said the civil rights leader.
"We've got to right the wrongs in this
sick, corrupt nation of ours and bring
about justice for all people," he stated.
Abernathy replaced Julian Bond in
the third annual Kent State/Jackson
State Memorial Lecture, sponsored
this year by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau. Bond was hospitalized
Monday with kidney trouble.
Abernathy, who co-founded the
Southern Christian Leadership

Conference with Martin
Luther King, Jr., urged that when the
governing body is insensitive to
people's needs, it is "incumbent on the
governed to change the government."
'No Right'
"We have no right to gather in this
church or in any other church to pay
tribute to those who gave their all
unless we are willing to go to Pharoah
Ford and let God's people go," said
Abernathy.
The pastor criticized expenditure of
tax dollars on Vietnam and moon
projects, claiming that "we are worse
off now than in the 19305."
"I used to think a funeral parlor
was the saddest place in the world,"
said Abernathy. "Not any more.
People in the funeral parlor look
happy compared to people in the
grocery store."
Instead of financing former
Vice President Spiro Agnew's tours to
pass out moon rocks, Abernathy
suggested that administration "should
have been in the ghettos, in the cotton
fields or in thfc Bay Area passing out
bread to hungry people."
Killings
Abernathy recalled many instances
of killings and repression he has
encountered in his civil rights struggle,
including the dynamiting of his own
house and personal physical abuse.
Last week he received a post card in
the mail from "Whitey" suggesting
that blacks should be supplied with
money for boats to travel to Africa.
"How are you going to go back to
where you have never been?" asked
Abernathy. "I'm proud of Africa —
the home of my ancestors, but
America is my home."
Until the English, French, German,
Irish and many others are returned to
their countries, and "until the white
man gives America back to the
Indians," said Abernathy, "the black
man is here to stay."
Dan Brenner, founder of the Kent
State/Jackson State Memorial Lecture
series, introduced Abernathy with
descriptions of the killings at Kent,
Ohio and Jackson, Mississippi. He
reminded the audience that "the
concerns of student protests were not
frivolous rites of spring."

"Almost 200 years have gone by

still searching for justice," said the Rev.
Ralph Abernathy last night. "America
must get right, America must do right.
We are no longer begging for it, but
demanding it,"he added.
