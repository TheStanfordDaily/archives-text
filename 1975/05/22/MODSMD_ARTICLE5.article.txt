# Inconspicuous University Press Grosses $2.5 Million Annually
## 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
The Stanford University Press — both printer and
publisher to the University — is, for all practical
purposes, hidden to the student body. But the Press is
too big to be ignored.
Besides the fact that it covers an acre of land, the
Press, according to Director Leon Seltzer, does about
$2,500,000 worth of business annually.
But the non-profit business has suffered in recent
years, according to Seltzer. Expensive printing
machinery, publishing books which can lose
thousands of dollars, advertising, accounting, storage
and shipping costs, and 95 employees all add up to an
enormous overhead.
"The general academic malaise due to economic
constraints, affects scholarly publications," explains
Seltzer.
The Press's main customers — libraries, professors
and graduate students — have all felt the economic
"bite," says Seltzer, and one of the first cutbacks a
university makes is the library.
Since libraries must then cut back the number of
books ordered, says Seltzer, "we systemically have
had to cut back."
Scholarly Books
The Press publishes books of a scholarly nature —
books, says Seltzer, that are "vital to the academic
community" but are not money-makers. Basically, he
says, they are "books by professors for other
professors."
Though he says the Press has "survived these past
six or seven years in pretty good shape," the number
of books published by the Press has dropped from
above 30 a year to 20. (It receives approximately 600
manuscript proposals annually.) The Press, says

Seltzer, hopes within the next 18 months to return to
publishing 35 books per year.
"We reject [books] for reasons other than [only]
intrinsic qualities of a manuscript," says Seltzer.
"There may be books whose area of specialty is of
the sort a university can't handle easily."
Chinese Speciality
One of the Press's strongest areas of interest,
according to Editor Jesse Bell, is China, particularly
in areas like religion, community studies and the
place of women in society. The Press, says Bell, is
"absolutely the top press in the world" for Chinese
anthropology.
Over the past 10 years, approximately 15 percent
of all books published at the Press have been related
to China.
Eleanor Maccoby, chairman of the Psychology
Department, authored The Development of Sex
Differences, which was published by the Press. She
said that although she lost sales by publishing at the
Press "because it doesn't have the same field sales
force as commercial publishers," she said she gained
quality because of its excellent editorial staff.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Michelle Rosaldo, said,
"The fact that we published the book [Women,
Culture, and Society] with the Press had
consequences of strengthening its academic
consequence" while simultaneously sacrificing some
of the book's "political energy."
"The Press has an elitist stance towards material
which can beconstraining,"Rosaldo said. "Because it
is so rigorous, and a bit dictatorial, a lot of people
squirm." But she added, "most people are happy with
the results."

of books published by the Press has dropped from
above 30 a year to 20. (It receives approximately 600
manuscript proposals annually.) The Press, says

Seltzer, hopes within the next 18 months to return to
publishing 35 books per year.
"We reject [books] for reasons other than [only]
intrinsic qualities of a manuscript," says Seltzer.
"There may be books whose area of specialty is of
the sort a university can't handle easily."
Chinese Speciality
One of the Press's strongest areas of interest,
according to Editor Jesse Bell, is China, particularly
in areas like religion, community studies and the
place of women in society. The Press, says Bell, is
"absolutely the top press in the world" for Chinese
anthropology.
Over the past 10 years, approximately 15 percent
of all books published at the Press have been related
to China.
Eleanor Maccoby, chairman of the Psychology
Department, authored The Development of Sex
Differences, which was published by the Press. She
said that although she lost sales by publishing at the
Press "because it doesn't have the same field sales
force as commercial publishers," she said she gained
quality because of its excellent editorial staff.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Michelle Rosaldo, said,
"The fact that we published the book [Women,
Culture, and Society] with the Press had
consequences of strengthening its academic
consequence" while simultaneously sacrificing some
of the book's "political energy."
"The Press has an elitist stance towards material
which can beconstraining,"Rosaldo said. "Because it
is so rigorous, and a bit dictatorial, a lot of people
squirm." But she added, "most people are happy with
the results."

HIS ENVIRONMENT—Head of the Stanford Press, Leon Seltzer, stands amidst the tools of his trade — the presses.
The presses are part of an enormous operation — which includes 95 employees - that takes in almost $2.5 million
annually. The presses print mainly "scholarly" works, but the economic situation has forced publication of many
journals to be postponed.
The Stanford University Press — both printer and
publisher to the University — is, for all practical
purposes, hidden to the student body. But the Press is
too big to be ignored.
Besides the fact that it covers an acre of land, the
Press, according to Director Leon Seltzer, does about
$2,500,000 worth of business annually.
But the non-profit business has suffered in recent
years, according to Seltzer. Expensive printing
machinery, publishing books which can lose
thousands of dollars, advertising, accounting, storage
and shipping costs, and 95 employees all add up to an
enormous overhead.
"The general academic malaise due to economic
constraints, affects scholarly publications," explains
Seltzer.
The Press's main customers — libraries, professors
and graduate students — have all felt the economic
"bite," says Seltzer, and one of the first cutbacks a
university makes is the library.
Since libraries must then cut back the number of
books ordered, says Seltzer, "we systemically have
had to cut back."
Scholarly Books
The Press publishes books of a scholarly nature —
books, says Seltzer, that are "vital to the academic
community" but are not money-makers. Basically, he
says, they are "books by professors for other
professors."
Though he says the Press has "survived these past
six or seven years in pretty good shape," the number
of books published by the Press has dropped from
above 30 a year to 20. (It receives approximately 600
manuscript proposals annually.) The Press, says

Seltzer, hopes within the next 18 months to return to
