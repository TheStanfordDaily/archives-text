## Opinions editorial On Recognition 
### 
It is time that the United States government made it a
policy to recognize all foreign governments that are
clearly established, regardless of whether or not their
actions are compatible with the principles of our
government. The U.S. should, in keeping with this policy,
immediately recognize the new governments of both
South Vietnam and Cambodia.
There are many obvious advantages to recognition:
one fact that became clear during last week's unfortunate
Mayaguez incident is that possibilities for negotiating
disputes are greatly restricted without formal diplomatic
relations. And the opening of consulates abroad need not
imply any kind of sympathy with the foreign
governments; indeed, establishing consulates is an
effective means of explaining U.S. interests, especially in
those countries which have been hostile to us.
Therefore, although we find many of the policies of
the new Khmer Rouge Cambodian government
disconcerting, we urge immediate recognition of the new
government there. This recognition should, if anything,
help to prevent fiascos, such as the Mayaguez incident, in
the future.
The case of the new South Vietnamese government is
even more clear-cut, for this clearly legitimate national
power has officially offered to exchange missions with
the United States. The U.S. should immediately accept
this offer.
