Jerry Irish, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. Although both these
names have been in the news
here lately, it may seem odd to
link them — the former the
religious studies professor who
has been denied tenure, the
latter the newly appointed U.S.
ambassador to the United
3 Nations who has been engaged as
• this year's commencement
speaker.
And yet, there is reflected in
Stanford's diverse treatment of
these men something common
and fundamental to
understanding how decisions
'JJjre made here and how open the
J, tJniversity is to change.
For all the University's
pretensions toward being a
liberal, democratic community,
decisions in the Irish and
Moynihan cases were made
without significant input by
those most affected and most
concerned about those decisions.
In the case of Irish, the
decision to deny him tenure was
made in closed session by the
Appointments and Promotions
(A&P) Committee, without
significant participation by
either the Religious Studies
faculty or interested students,
and without a public report
specifying the reasons for the
committee's decision.
Whatever the rationale of the
/committee's members, their
' absolute secrecy betrayed their
fear and mistrust of the very
community whose educational
quality they were purportedly
enhancing.
No Choice Given
The same is true for the
administration's handling of the
Moynihan case. Here, the crucial
question is not, as some
administrators would have it,
Moynihan's qualities as a
scholar, thinker or provocative
speaker; the crucial issue is the
nature of decision-making at
Stanford. It is specifically
whether those who are
graduating would have
Moynihan address them were
they given the choice.
Of course, they have not been
given the choice.
It does not seem to have
occurred to anyone to poll the
senior class on its preferences.
Rather, as in the case of Irish,
minority fiat reigns supreme.
And so, at the very moment
Stanford students graduate or
receive advanced degrees, they
are treated most like children.
Apparently the democratic
process, which we've learned has
a long way to go in Washington,
D.C., has even farther to go here.
No Real Appeal
Once a decision was made in
each case which offended
significant factions of the
community, what channels were
there for appeal and change? In
the Irish case, an appeal was
referred to the same committee
which made the original
decision, a committee which in
turn went about considering it in
the same way as previously; in
short, the appeal was treated as
no appeal at all, for the
University found the quickest,
most unimaginative way to
ratify its initial decision.

I have a confession. I am
writing this out of more than an
academic interest as to how
decisions are made here. For
several weeks, I've had the
extraordinary and moving
privilege of sitting in on Irish's
course on Christian Ethics.
Having gone to universities in
New Brunswick, N.J., Jerusalem,
Berlin and New York as well as
Stanford, I've encountered a few
good teachers and a handful of
great ones. Irish unmistakably
belongs among the latter.
Poor Stanford: it has so much
wealth, not only material, but
intellectual and creative as well.
But then it sometimes squanders
so much, so that — as in the
handling of the Irish and
Moynihan cases — it betrays a
distressing poverty of
democracy, of imagination and,
ultimately, of self-respect.
