# Cost Probers Should Study Church
## 
### Tim Ferguson 
A University task force Tuesday opened
io public hearing its investigation of the
effect budget cuts must have on services
presently offered to Stanford students.
Geology Prof. Benjamin Page, chairman
of the task force, says it "will be strongly
influenced by what the student body wants.
If you have to pick and choose now that
we re in a financial crunch, that's the only
way to go."
The most rational way of assessing
students' desires, measured against current
levels of operation in discrete areas of
student services, is to perform cost-benefit
analyses in each area. Such a tack, I believe,
will lead the task force straight to the door
of Memorial Church.
Other Questions
Such an assessment could be made
totally apart from consideration of two
other important questions surrounding Mem
Chu:
—is there a place for an essentially
mystical body at a secular research
institution? (A University committee in the
19605, headed by then-History Prof.
Richard Lyman, apparently answered the
question. It decided to recruit academicians to
bolster the then-sleepy church, present
Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly
says.)
—should student services money be used
to finance the /controversial political
activities of the church (such as, in the past
year, support for Food Day and Cesar
Chavez)?
Worth It?
Arguments over those two issues could
go on ad infinitum. But money figures
compared with measures of use are
somewhat harder to debate. Consider:
—monetary support for Mem Chu has
tripled during the last decade;
—the church's programs are serving,
however well, a small core of interested
students.
Operating budget figures for Mem Chu
and the dean of the chapel for 1974-75

show a total allotment of $141,028. Of this,
$66,136 comes from University general
funds, the remaining $74,892 from
endowment income from a gift of more
than $1 million made to the church in the
late 19605.
'Academic Upgrading'
A comparable figure from a decade ago,
this from the 1967 proposed budget, shows
Memorial Church receiving just $47,000.
This was before the "academic upgrading"
recommended by Lyman's committee went
into effect.

The bulk of University expenditures for
1974-75 "religious activities" goes for
salaries and staff benefits — $90,100. This
supports Kelly, Assoc. Dean Ernie Young,
an assistant dean and an intern.
A rather large portion of the budget,
$5000, is slated for "travel." In relation to
the amount spent on salaries, Mem Chu's
budget for travel is roughly equivalent to
that of the admissions office, which must
send representatives across the country
during recruiting times.
Kelly says the travel monies go to bring
visiting preachers from the East Coast and
to send Stanford's staff to conferences,but
that a "considerable" portion of the $5000
will not be spent.
What else does the University get for its
money?
The most visible return is Sunday
worship services, which Kelly says draw 300
to 400. More than half of these churchgoers
are connected with Stanford, Kelly insists,

but Page says attendance figures "cause
some concern" that church functions are
existing mainly for outsiders' benefit.
Page wonders whether the services could
be made self-supporting through collections,
a practice which Kelly says is forbidden by
Jane Stanford's founding grant. Page,
however, points to a "blanket escape
clause" in the grant "where provisions not
in the interest of the University can be
changed with permission of [a] court."
Few Participate
Other Mem Chu services include Kelly's
Bible study and prayer meetings (attended
by somewhat overlapping groups of 15
each, he estimates); seminars on medicine
and Christianity benefiting approximately
15 undergraduates; a biblical studies class
for some 20 students; and occasional
retreats in surrounding areas, in which 20
students took part this year, paying their
own way after Mem Chu organized the
gatherings.
Kelly, in fact, admits that "there is a
hard core of 30 to 40" students avidly
interested in the goings-on of the church.
To me, $141,000 seems a lot to pay for
tHeir perceived spiritual enrichment.
But we should be aware of the
ramifications of any cut. Kelly says a slash
in general funding of the church will bring a
concomitant reduction in endowment
income by instructions of the 1960s grant.
He says a paring back to the support
levels of a decade ago would cause him "to
rethink my position" as dean of the chapel.
He left a tenured full professorship at
McCormick Theological Seminary in
Chicago to accept the post two years ago
with the understanding it would not be a
"penny-ante position."
Thus we can anticipate the argument
that we can't afford to cut Mem Chu's
funding. But I find just the opposite the
case; in a time of stringent cuts on services,
a largely unused, "academically upgraded"
church is a luxury we must do without.
