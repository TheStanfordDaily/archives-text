The heart
of the matter
Finding the "hearl beat" of
your diamond is no trick at all
for the finely engineered
instrument pictured above. It
is the special 10-power
magnifier that professionally
trained jewelers use to
see into the heart of a stone.
The fashioning and
internal markings which might
affect the per carat value of
a diamond are clearly
revealed. We will be happy to
show you the diamond
you select under this
instrument, and explain
details of its value.
