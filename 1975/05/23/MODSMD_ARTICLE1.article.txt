# No Clues On Students' Fate; Kidnapers Remain Unknown

Authorities yesterday still had no
word from the persons who kidnaped
three Stanford students and a Dutch
researcher from Tanzania's Gombe
Stream primate research facility
Monday night.
Unconfirmed reports said
Tanzanian authorities have a suspect in
custody in connection with the case.
But U.S. State Department officials
said they don't know how reliable
those reports are.
There's still no word on the
whereabouts of the victims.
Ten students at the facility who

escaped capture — including seven
from Stanford — yesterday arrived
safely in the Tanzanian capital of Dar
es Salaam, about 800 miles from the
Gombe facility. Seven were then flown
to Nairobi, Kenya. They brought with
them stories of fear and confusion
about the attack by some 30 heavily
armed raiders.
University spokesman Bob Beyers
interviewed several students by
telephone from Nairobi. According to
the students, the kidnapers invaded
the Gombe facility by boat at about
11:30 p.m. Monday, Tanzanian time.
The remote facility is located on the
eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika.
From Zaire?
A University release said
fragmentary evidence indicates the
raiders may have come from the
neighboring Republic of Zaire, which
faces Tanzania across 40 miles of lake.
At least one raider pointed to his
cap and said it had a Zaire emblem.
There has been speculation that the
raiders may have been members of a
guerrilla movement opposed to Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko.
The raiders reportedly first landed
about three miles south of the main
research station, where they beat
several native Tanzanian staff
members. James Baugh, a Stanford
student from San Marino, told Beyers
he fled through the woods to the main
compound while the raiders returned
to their boats and sailed up the lake to
the compound.
Asked For Goodall
The raiders reportedly asked for the
director of the facility — Dr. Jane
Goodall, a Stanford visiting professor

— but not by name. Goodall managed
to escape into the woods during the
confusion, according to Joe
Wainwright, a British tutor at the
center.
Goodall cabled yesterday that she's
remaining in Tanzania with her
husband, who heads the Tanzanian
park service. The Gombe compound
has been at least temporarily closed in
the wake of the incident, and Goodall
is supervising removal of data from the
area.
At the compound, the raiders first
seized Emilie Bergman, a Dutch
national who worked as a researcher at

the center for two years. Kenneth
Stephen Smith, a Stanford senior
from Garden Grove, was captured in
his small house; when Stanford
students Carrie Hunter of Atherton
and Barbara Smuts of Ann Arbor,
Mich., answered his pleas for help,
they too were seized.
Bound On Boat
The kidnapers forced the four onto
a boat, where they were bound.
However, witnesses said they appeared
unharmed. "1 don't think they were
knocked about at all," Wainwright
said.
