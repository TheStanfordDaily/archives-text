# Pro-Abortionists Show Ignorance
## 
### 
Tim Cullinane's column (Daily, May 15)
in support of a "woman's right to choose"
was a masterpiece of illogic and ignorance
regarding the issue of abortion.
Lacking the initial foresight as to the
difficulty of such a task, he sets out to
"examine the arguments of those who are
seeking to remove a woman's right to
choose."
He correctly states that a major
argument of anti-abortionists is the
assertion that a fetus is human. Rather than
argue this on medical grounds, he chooses
to avoid the issue.
First, he states that "our laws supposedly
reflect the beliefs of the population." This
is an arguable generalization given our form
of government.
Second, he cites a study of the medical
professions which reveals that "Catholics,
fundamentalists and ,conservatives all
generally believed that life begins at
conception" and that "other religious
groups and liberals did not hold this view."
Cullinane then concludes that "the belief
that a fetus is human is based more on one's
religious and political tendencies."
Absurd
This iS an absurd association of facts, at
best. The question is as to whether the fetus
is human, not the tenuous relation between
medical opinions of professionals and their
religious or political beliefs.
The following facts can be cited in
support of the conception that the fetus is
not simply an "organ" of the women but

rather a separate individual: the placenta,
amniotic sac, umbilical cord and fetus
develop entirely from the zygote; the
heartbeat begins by the 25th day; brain
waves can be detected at seven weeks; and
at 11 weeks all body systems are
functioning.
The only change at birth is in the infant's
external life support system.
Majority Morality
Cullinane next asserts that "the United
States is based on the tenet that the state
will not prescribe an individual's morality."
This generality I must dispute and he
himself contradicts in previously saying that
"our laws .. . reflect the beliefs of our
population."
A review of U.S. history shows that
through the representational process,
the morality of the majority has been
imposed upon the population as a whole.
Take, for example, slavery laws prior to
1865, Prohibition, sex laws, laws against
murder, rape, theft and other crimes
considered morally wrong by the society,
etc. This is not to say that the imposition of
values is right, it is simply a recognition of
fact.
Not satisfied with blatant illogic, he tries
religious prejudice. He states that "certain
people within the Catholic Church are . . .
trying to force Catholics to support its
views. .and"It is interesting to note that
in 1869, the Catholic Chutch changed its
official stance. For 1800 years, it did not
believe that life began at conception."

It is also interesting to note that during
most of those 1800 years science was not
sufficiently advanced to know or
understand the process of fetal
development.
Call To Action
Cullinane concludes by calling for action
"to hold back the anti-right-of-choice
groups, heavily financed by the Catholic
Church, from sending women back into the
hands of back-room butchers."
First, the Catholic Church does nut
finance pro-life groups, although its
members are free to do so.
Secondly, emotional appeals to man's
humanitarian nature can also be made in
defense of the unborn. Quoting from
columnist Nick Themmesch, "Take that
human life by suction abortion and the
body is torn apart. .. becoming a jumble of
tiny arms and legs. In a D&C abortion, an
instrument slices the body to pieces. Salt
poisoning at nineteen weeks? The saline
solution burns away the outer layer of the
baby's skin. The ultimate is the
hysterotomy abortion... Often, this baby
fights for its life, breathes, moves and even
cries."
In conclusion, I suggest that Cullinane
find a more intelligent, informed and
articulate spokesman for his cause. He
might also take note of the words of Albert
Schweitzer, "If a man loses hisrevercncefor
any part of life, he will soon lose his
reverence for all of life."
