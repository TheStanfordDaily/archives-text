# Multinationals Hinder Third World
## 
### Susan Luttner 
The phrase "foreign investment" implies
that the underdeveloped country is
receiving net input from outside, which can
help it develop. In fact, this expectation
comprises classical notions of the effect of
connections with industrialized nations on
Third World countries.
However, the figures which have become
available in the past 10 years indicate that
underdeveloped nations are not being
developed for their own benefit, but for the
net profit of the investors.
Grants and loans are the "altruistic"
aspects of foreign policy which theoretically
benefit only the receiving country. But in
fact, the power relations created by these
fund sources as they are now handled only
enhance the dichotomy between
"developed" and "underdeveloped"
nations.
The United States, through massive
capital inputs, can maintain ineffective or
corrupt governments in Third World
countries, which enables its multi-national
corporations to operate without local
interference. Many Chileans are not
particulary grateful for the U.S. support of
the junta, which would not have come to
power in the first place without massive
foreign interference.
Slow Development
A side effect of foreign support of
corrupt or archaic governments is the delay
of needed social change, which can retard
the economic development of a country.
When foreign investors actively enter the
economy of a developing nation, they
distort the economy by directing manpower
and resources to products needed by the

industrialized world. Often, the countries
begin to export raw materials or food
products, such as the mining and fruit
industries common in South America.
Investment in these levels of production
lacks the "spin-off" effects of a more
complex economy. That is, the
development of one branch does not create
a higher demand and, therefore, growth in
another branch of the economy. Much
foreign investment merely supports the
mono-economy, which grows more slowly.
Capital Exporting
Foreign investment in natural resources

gives capital-rich countries or companies
claim to production carried on in the Third
World. Through interest payments,
dividends and return on investment to
capitalists, underdeveloped nations can
become net exporters of capital, according
to South American economists Pinto and
Knakal.
Because the multi-national corporations
which own the mines and plantations are
continually expanding, the profits they
make in underdeveloped nations are

siphoned off into other interests, not
re-invested in the local economy.
Obviously, large investment companies
put capital into these developing nations to
make a profit. Underdeveloped nations
offer three advantages to these investors:
weak governments, without adequate
taxation structures and social programs;
cheap labor; and weak local businesses,
which offer little or no competition.
Cheap Labor Exploited
Recently, corporations have discovered
the advantages of moving assembly plants
and some technical businesses to these
countries, where cheap labor abounds.
Again, the effect is to distort the economy
by paying the workers at relatively inflated
wages for production which is not
consumed locally.
If foreign investment were competitive,
Third World countries could conceivably
benefit, by allowing only investment which
contributes to internal growth.
Unfortunately, the investors tend to have
more power than the Third World nations,
and trade agreements usually benefit the
countries importing raw materials. Within
the past 10 years, multi-national
corporations have grown to the point that
their combined sales exceed the gross
national product of every country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
If the trends of the past 20 years
continue, multi-national corporations could
succeed where traditional politics has failed,
bringing the world under one economic
system.

developed for their own benefit, but for the
net profit of the investors.
Grants and loans are the "altruistic"
aspects of foreign policy which theoretically
benefit only the receiving country. But in
fact, the power relations created by these
fund sources as they are now handled only
enhance the dichotomy between
"developed" and "underdeveloped"
nations.
The United States, through massive
capital inputs, can maintain ineffective or
corrupt governments in Third World
countries, which enables its multi-national
corporations to operate without local
interference. Many Chileans are not
particulary grateful for the U.S. support of
the junta, which would not have come to
power in the first place without massive
foreign interference.
Slow Development
A side effect of foreign support of
corrupt or archaic governments is the delay
of needed social change, which can retard
the economic development of a country.
When foreign investors actively enter the
economy of a developing nation, they
distort the economy by directing manpower
and resources to products needed by the

industrialized world. Often, the countries
begin to export raw materials or food
products, such as the mining and fruit
industries common in South America.
Investment in these levels of production
lacks the "spin-off" effects of a more
complex economy. That is, the
development of one branch does not create
a higher demand and, therefore, growth in
another branch of the economy. Much
foreign investment merely supports the
mono-economy, which grows more slowly.
Capital Exporting
Foreign investment in natural resources

gives capital-rich countries or companies
claim to production carried on in the Third
World. Through interest payments,
dividends and return on investment to
capitalists, underdeveloped nations can
become net exporters of capital, according
to South American economists Pinto and
Knakal.
Because the multi-national corporations
which own the mines and plantations are
continually expanding, the profits they
make in underdeveloped nations are

siphoned off into other interests, not
re-invested in the local economy.
Obviously, large investment companies
put capital into these developing nations to
make a profit. Underdeveloped nations
offer three advantages to these investors:
weak governments, without adequate
taxation structures and social programs;
cheap labor; and weak local businesses,
which offer little or no competition.
Cheap Labor Exploited
Recently, corporations have discovered
the advantages of moving assembly plants
and some technical businesses to these
countries, where cheap labor abounds.
Again, the effect is to distort the economy
by paying the workers at relatively inflated
wages for production which is not
consumed locally.
If foreign investment were competitive,
Third World countries could conceivably
benefit, by allowing only investment which
contributes to internal growth.
Unfortunately, the investors tend to have
more power than the Third World nations,
and trade agreements usually benefit the
countries importing raw materials. Within
the past 10 years, multi-national
corporations have grown to the point that
their combined sales exceed the gross
national product of every country except
the United States and the Soviet Union.
If the trends of the past 20 years
continue, multi-national corporations could
succeed where traditional politics has failed,
bringing the world under one economic
system.

the Daily editorial board.)

The phrase "foreign investment" implies
that the underdeveloped country is
receiving net input from outside, which can
help it develop. In fact, this expectation
comprises classical notions of the effect of
connections with industrialized nations on
Third World countries.
However, the figures which have become
available in the past 10 years indicate that
underdeveloped nations are not being
developed for their own benefit, but for the
net profit of the investors.
