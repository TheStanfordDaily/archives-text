# Rosenzweig's Remarks Mirror Moynihan's
## 
### 
Having gone on record
publicly, Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig now stands to be
judged publicly on the Daniel
Moynihan issue, and my
judgment is that he falls short of
the standards he expects of
faculty critics, and rightfully
expected of University officers.

Even though he has stated in
an opinions column that it was
not his purpose to defend any of
Moynihan's views (Daily, April
4), he nevertheless does so in the
same article in his discussions
about welfare systems.
Rosenzweig does not
apologize for the obvious
oversight of inviting to campus a

person who is irritating to
communities of color without
having consulted those very
communities. Therefore,
well-intentioned and respectable
members of the University
community must openly protest
against an individual who does
not deserve to grace the podium
at a kindergarten, not to speak

of a university.
Had the University done as it
should have, both the
University and communities of
color would not have been faced
with these difficulties. The
University should take steps to
insure that these tragedies do
not occur in the future.
Lastly, the standards
Rosenzweig refers to are not
satisfied by the commencement
speaker himself. In his articles
on the subject, Moynihan speaks
very decisively about welfare,
but neither he nor Rosenzweig
analytically attacks the factor
forcing many people to welfare
in the first place — racism in
employment and no jobs.
Taking into consideration
Rosenzweig's quotes (Daily, May
7) regarding disputes at other
institutions, he is making it
clearer why black students, and
others, urged his removal in
1968 as vice provost for
minority affairs.
Rosenzweig's reference to
how disputes are handled at
other institutions was a
diplomatic way of threatening
the black community and
comforting others that SWAT
(Stanford's Ways Against
"Them") is at the ready.
Nowhere in the May 7 article
is Rosenzweig reported to be
concerned about the factors that
brought about the disputes at
other institutions; how the
causative factors were corrected
there; if such factors exist here,
and how they should be
corrected. Instead, to discourage
disturbances at the forthcoming
commencement, Rosenzweig
finds it necessary to remind the
old and threaten the new that
their protests will be arrested by
any means necessary.
In the May 7 article,
Rosenzweig is reported to have

Henry Organ

said that Moynihan was
recommended because "he's
held a number of important
public positions, he's an active
scholar and teacher, he's a
journalist of ideas and he's not
afraid to take on unpopular
issues." So are a lot of Nazis, but
I doubt if Rosenzweig would
have treated their nominations
so aloofly.
Rosenzweig also stated in the
April 4 column that he would be
"willing to wp lt 'er that very few
people at Stanford have any very
clear idea of thecontext in which
the phrase 'benign neglect' was
used." I would suggest that if
they had a clearer idea of what
Moynihan meant, they might
take even more drastic steps.

the phrase 'benign neglect' was
used." I would suggest that if
they had a clearer idea of what
Moynihan meant, they might
take even more drastic steps.
(Henry Organ is a University
associate general secretary.)
Having gone on record
publicly, Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig now stands to be
judged publicly on the Daniel
Moynihan issue, and my
judgment is that he falls short of
the standards he expects of
faculty critics, and rightfully
expected of University officers.

Even though he has stated in
an opinions column that it was
not his purpose to defend any of
Moynihan's views (Daily, April
4), he nevertheless does so in the
same article in his discussions
about welfare systems.
Rosenzweig does not
apologize for the obvious
oversight of inviting to campus a

person who is irritating to
communities of color without
having consulted those very
communities. Therefore,
well-intentioned and respectable
members of the University
community must openly protest
against an individual who does
not deserve to grace the podium
at a kindergarten, not to speak

of a university.
Had the University done as it
should have, both the
University and communities of
color would not have been faced
with these difficulties. The
University should take steps to
insure that these tragedies do
not occur in the future.
Lastly, the standards
Rosenzweig refers to are not
satisfied by the commencement
speaker himself. In his articles
on the subject, Moynihan speaks
very decisively about welfare,
but neither he nor Rosenzweig
analytically attacks the factor
forcing many people to welfare
in the first place — racism in
employment and no jobs.
Taking into consideration
Rosenzweig's quotes (Daily, May
7) regarding disputes at other
institutions, he is making it
clearer why black students, and
others, urged his removal in
1968 as vice provost for
minority affairs.
Rosenzweig's reference to
how disputes are handled at
other institutions was a
diplomatic way of threatening
the black community and
comforting others that SWAT
(Stanford's Ways Against
"Them") is at the ready.
Nowhere in the May 7 article
is Rosenzweig reported to be
concerned about the factors that
brought about the disputes at
other institutions; how the
causative factors were corrected
there; if such factors exist here,
and how they should be
corrected. Instead, to discourage
disturbances at the forthcoming
commencement, Rosenzweig
finds it necessary to remind the
old and threaten the new that
their protests will be arrested by
any means necessary.
In the May 7 article,
Rosenzweig is reported to have

Henry Organ

said that Moynihan was
recommended because "he's
held a number of important
public positions, he's an active
scholar and teacher, he's a
journalist of ideas and he's not
afraid to take on unpopular
issues." So are a lot of Nazis, but
I doubt if Rosenzweig would
have treated their nominations
so aloofly.
Rosenzweig also stated in the
April 4 column that he would be
"willing to wp lt 'er that very few
people at Stanford have any very
clear idea of thecontext in which
the phrase 'benign neglect' was
used." I would suggest that if
they had a clearer idea of what
Moynihan meant, they might
