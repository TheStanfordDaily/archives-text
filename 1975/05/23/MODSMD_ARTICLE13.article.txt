# Oil Glut Facts

Paul Atkinson

Recently, many
commentators have noted the
existence of a "petroleum glut."
Some have argued that, in view
of the evidence supporting the
existence of a glut, governmental
actions have been "economically
destructive" and "serve special
interests."
This opinion can be
reasonable only from a narrow,
libertarian point of view which
ignores the realities of the world
energy situation.
Transient Case
This "petroleum glut" does
indeed exist. However, it can
only continue to exist for a
short period of time. This
situation of excess supply over
demand in the world petroleum
markets has developed as a
response to the unilateral
increases in world oil prices
instigated by the oil producing
countries in 1972.
What is the appropriate
government response in the face
of such a "glut"? I am not
certain that anyone knows for
sure what it is, but I do think
that the libertarians' criticisms
are invalid, as they apparently
ignore the serious situation of
long-term world energy supplies.
In order to develop an
opinion of what government
action (or inaction) should be
taken, it is necessary to examine
a broader, long-term perspective.
First of all, it is necessary to
recognize that the supplies of oil
in the U.S. and the rest of the
world are limited.
Since only a few years ago,
the United States has been
unable to supply its domestic
crude oil requirements from
domestic production and has
had to import more and more of
its own requirements.
Wide Repercussions
In view of the substantial
recent increases in the prices of
world oil, we cannot expect to
continue importing a large
portion of our oil requirements
without serious consequences in
both the international monetary
and the political systems to
which we are so closely tied.
Thus, given that U.S. oil is
presently being produced at the
maximum rate compatible with
the price structure of oil, the
only short-term alternative to
these international repercussions
is to reduce our consumption of
oil (or at least its rate of
increase).
New Energy Sources
Hence, government attempts
to cut back oil imports by one
million barrels per day can be
seen as an attempt to avoid such
repercussions. Over the longer
term, we have another
alternative of developing new
energy sources. However, this
alternative will require both time
and a tremendous investment of
resources before it has much of
an impact on the U.S. energy
situation.
The government goal of
setting a minimum price for
imported oil can thus be seen as
an attempt to enhance the
development of such alternate
energy sources.
This is the context in which
we must view governmental
policies. Thus, it becomes clear
that libertarian arguments,
although reasonable and
acceptable in the short term, fail
to account for the realities of
the longer-term world energy
supply situation.
