# Commencement: The 'Final Stanford Screw'?
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Though graduating seniors may have
thought the protest over commencement
speaker Daniel Patrick Moynihan confusing
enough, yet another graduation controversy
has arisen to mar the June ceremony.
Vice President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig's May 6 announcement that all
departmental ceremonies of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (H&S) will be
combined has sparked the latest protest.
Rosenzweig said the eight separate H&S
ceremonies which sped up the
diploma-awarding process for the past three
commencements would be consolidated into
one. All H&S seniors will receive their degrees
with the school's graduate students in a
marathon 1000-degree session.
The change was instituted to avoid the need
to set up chairs and public address systems
across the campus — at a cost of $10,000 in
labor and equipment rental during a time of
belt-tightening.
Some seniors were miffed not only at the
decision, but the manner in which it was
reached as well. To some, the method was
painfully reminiscent of that which led to
other unpopular acts.
Munificence
In October, the administration notified the
senior class officers that budget cuts would
probably force a change in the commencement
ceremony. But the administration's
munificence with information went
unrewarded, and was short-lived.
Administrators never elaborated on their
plans to the officers, who in turn failed either
to consult with fellow seniors about the
change or check its details with the
administration.
The story continues around late December
or early January, when President Richard
Lyman's staff, the Office of Public Events and
the Registrar's Office — without any student
input — reached a consensus on the change.
Consolidation
Desiring to cut costs while also continuing
both the initial half of the ceremony (with the
commencement speaker and the awarding of
the Gores and Dinkelspiel honors) and the
actual diploma-awarding, the triad opted for
the H&S consolidation.
Public Events Director Thomas Bacchetti
said the change wasn't announced immediately
thereafter because "it didn't seem to be an
announceable decision. No announcements are
made concerning graduation ceremony
changes."
At a meeting of the Committee on Public
Events in April, Bacchetti brought the

ceremony change to the group's attention. The
committee approved the decision but didn't
decide to make it public.
'Administrative Function'
Education Prof. Robert Textor of the
committee said any announcement would have
been "an administrative function [of
Bacchetti's office] and not the committee's."
Textor didn't recall if the panel instructed
Bacchetti to announce the change. .
Junior 800 Bacon, a committee member,
said the decision "wasn't discussed for a
lengthy period of time. I felt it was a
procedural matter that had already been
decided [by Bacchetti] and it sounded like a
good way to save $10,000."
Bacon said Bacchetti didn't explain how the
new ceremony would differ from past years
"until he was asked by a faculty member."
Protests Arose
A month later, Rosenzweig made the
announcement. Protests arose immediately, as
new dissenters joined those already bickering
over the Moynihan selection.
Seniors complained not only of lack of
input, but of the late date on which they
learned of the change. By May, any hope of
raising the needed $10,000 to save the
now-traditional ceremonies had been
precluded.
The University has agreed to a proposal by
class officer Lise Pfeiffer that individual
department chairmen hand out the diplomas in
order to make the process more personal, but
Bacchetti estimated that this revision will add
20 minutes to an already long procession.
Students Angry
So in its aftermath, the latest

commencement controversy has again left
students angry about a decision made without
their knowledge and announced (too late to
allow for recourse) by administrators who
expressed surprise at the reaction it drew.
Some officials, however, are smarting over
the furor. "It's a shame that the information
wasn't earlier announced to students," said
Assoc. Dean of H&S Syndney Burkhart.
But some students are even more pained by
thoughts of their upcoming rites.
One senior, discussing Moynihan's selection
earlier, called it"the final Stanford screw." On
June 15, somewhere in the midst of a
ceremony which began some four hours
before, other seniors — or possibly parents —
will probably come up with yet more
trenchant comments on the whole affair.

indications are that some students won't be smiling after this year's commencement.
