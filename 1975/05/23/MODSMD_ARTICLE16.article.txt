# Frenchman's Terrace Backers Aren't Giving Up
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Plans for Frenchman's Terrace have
suffered so many setbacks that it is almost
surprising that its planners haven't given up by
now.
After undergoing seven years of political,
legal and financial assaults, the proposed
225-unit housing complex sustained another
blow last week when the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
announced that the University's plans for the
project were illegal under Section 236 of the
National Housing Act of 1965.
HUD declared that the University's
insistence on allocating half of the units to its
own employees was illegal.
It also struck down the University's
proposal to allocate 40 percent of the units to
market priced housing, 40 percent to moderate
priced units and 20 percent to low income
residents.
Although Frenchman's Terrace would be
built on University land annexed to Palo Alto
and would be managed by the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition, the federal government
would provide financial support for the
project, so the University must bow to HUD's
interpretation of federal law.
But Robert Augsburger, University vice

president for business and finance, claims that
HUD's latest ruling might be a blessing in
disguise.
According to Augsburger and James Price,
HUD's area director, it is still possible to build
Frenchman's Terrace under Section 8 of the
Community Development Act of 1974.
Augsburger notes that under Section 8, the
University is free to choose its own income
mix, providing that market-priced units don't
exceed 80 percent.
Exception
Although HUD still refuses to grant the
University's request to allocate half of the
units to its own employees, Augsburger claims
that the University might be able to persuade
HUD to make an exception for Stanford.
But Price told the Daily this week that
under Section 8, occupancy restrictions are
clearly illegal.
He said that HUD cannot grant any
exceptions because it is powerless to overrule
an act of Congress.
One official close to the project agreed with
Price, calling Augsbujrger unduly optimistic.
HUD's forthright declaration of the
illegality of the residency requirements
contrasts sharply with its vacillations during
the past year regarding the legality of the

University's income and occupancy
restrictions.
Although Price expressed doubts about the
University's plans in February 1974, HUD
attorneys took the matter under advisement
and studied it until early this month.
"I think that HUD's statements were

ambiguous," Urban Coalition Director Robert
Moulton said Tuesday. "What probably finally
happened is that HUD's regional office wasn't
willing to supply funds for the project."
Augsburger speculated that HUD has been
trying to phase out projects like Frenchman's
Terrace under Section 236 since such projects
often have been shoddy.
Dirk Murphy, Price's assistant, has not yet
commented on the reasons for HUD's decision.
Coalition Willing
Despite its problems, Frenchman's Terrace
cleared at least one hurdle last week when
Moulton announced that the Urban Coalition
is willing to build the project providing that
not more than 40 percent of the units are
allocated to market priced housing.
The good news, however, seems slight
compared to the major problems that still
beset Frenchman's Terrace. But plans for the
project have survived Stanford trustee doubts,
community hostility, Palo Alto City Council
skepticism and even a Nixon moratorium on
its funding since the project was conceived in
1968.
With a record like that, in addition to the
University's persistent support, it is perhaps
still possible for Frenchman's Terrace to
become a reality.

1968.
With a record like that, in addition to the
University's persistent support, it is perhaps
still possible for Frenchman's Terrace to
become a reality.

Plans for Frenchman's Terrace have
suffered so many setbacks that it is almost
surprising that its planners haven't given up by
now.
After undergoing seven years of political,
legal and financial assaults, the proposed
225-unit housing complex sustained another
blow last week when the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
announced that the University's plans for the
project were illegal under Section 236 of the
National Housing Act of 1965.
HUD declared that the University's
insistence on allocating half of the units to its
own employees was illegal.
It also struck down the University's
proposal to allocate 40 percent of the units to
market priced housing, 40 percent to moderate
priced units and 20 percent to low income
residents.
Although Frenchman's Terrace would be
built on University land annexed to Palo Alto
and would be managed by the Mid-Peninsula
Urban Coalition, the federal government
would provide financial support for the
project, so the University must bow to HUD's
interpretation of federal law.
But Robert Augsburger, University vice

president for business and finance, claims that
HUD's latest ruling might be a blessing in
disguise.
According to Augsburger and James Price,
HUD's area director, it is still possible to build
Frenchman's Terrace under Section 8 of the
Community Development Act of 1974.
Augsburger notes that under Section 8, the
University is free to choose its own income
mix, providing that market-priced units don't
exceed 80 percent.
Exception
Although HUD still refuses to grant the
University's request to allocate half of the
units to its own employees, Augsburger claims
that the University might be able to persuade
HUD to make an exception for Stanford.
But Price told the Daily this week that
under Section 8, occupancy restrictions are
clearly illegal.
He said that HUD cannot grant any
exceptions because it is powerless to overrule
an act of Congress.
One official close to the project agreed with
Price, calling Augsbujrger unduly optimistic.
HUD's forthright declaration of the
illegality of the residency requirements
contrasts sharply with its vacillations during
the past year regarding the legality of the

University's income and occupancy
restrictions.
Although Price expressed doubts about the
University's plans in February 1974, HUD
attorneys took the matter under advisement
and studied it until early this month.
"I think that HUD's statements were

ambiguous," Urban Coalition Director Robert
Moulton said Tuesday. "What probably finally
happened is that HUD's regional office wasn't
willing to supply funds for the project."
Augsburger speculated that HUD has been
trying to phase out projects like Frenchman's
Terrace under Section 236 since such projects
often have been shoddy.
Dirk Murphy, Price's assistant, has not yet
commented on the reasons for HUD's decision.
Coalition Willing
Despite its problems, Frenchman's Terrace
cleared at least one hurdle last week when
Moulton announced that the Urban Coalition
is willing to build the project providing that
not more than 40 percent of the units are
allocated to market priced housing.
The good news, however, seems slight
compared to the major problems that still
beset Frenchman's Terrace. But plans for the
project have survived Stanford trustee doubts,
community hostility, Palo Alto City Council
skepticism and even a Nixon moratorium on
its funding since the project was conceived in
1968.
