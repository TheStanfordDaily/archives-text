# Affirmative Action Figures Deceptive, Officials Of Stanford Program Report
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
There's more to "affirmative action" than
hiring the first minority or female applicant
who comes along. Waiting for qualified
applicants to come to the University doesn't
fit the bill.
The fact became obvious this week when
the Affirmative Action Office announced it
had failed to meet its goal of 21 percent

minorities on the University staff. But it made
clear that affirmative action at Stanford was
alive and well.
As Stanford Affirmative Action Officer
Anne Miner defines it, the program "seeks not
some abstract state of 'non-discrimination' but
a more healthy institution where members of
ethnic minorities and women participate at all
levels of work and decision-making."
The University seems to be aiming at this
ideal — in staff affirmative action, at least —
and not doing too bad a job, considering the
circumstances.
A one-yeai increase in minority
employment from 18.6 percent to 19.9
percent doesn't sound too impressive, but as
Joseph Scroggs, deputy director of personnel
and employee relations pointed out, figures are
deceiving.
Considering the budget cutbacks made
everywhere this past year, Scroggs says, the
fact that the University made any progress at
all is significant.
Of course, problems do remain — problems
that differ from department to department
and may take some time to work out.
For example, the crafts, groundskeeping
and laborers divisions of Plant Services employ
very few women, but there are fewer women
in these areas to begin with.
Plant Services seems to be taking steps to

remedy the situation when it can. Out of seve
employees hired since last .July, five we)
women (two of these from minority groups
The business and finance division has a
overabundance of women and minorities i
clerical and office positions, but few at tl"
senior levels.
Robert Beth, affirmative actio
coordinating officer for business and finanei
pointed out that most jobs in his division ai
clerical and office posts and observed th;
there were only 43 senior positions, with
very slow turnover rate.
Recruiting minorities for senior levt
professional jobs is especially difficult becaus
of the immense competition for them. Bet
said that it is difficult for the University t
compete, salary-wise, for qualified employee
Even University alumni often prefer to tak
jobs in industry where "more lucrative
opportunities await them, Beth observed.
Appointment Helps
The recent appointment of Rut
Moghadam as recruitment coordinator wit
special responsibility for obtaining minorit
professional candidates may help alleviat
general recruitment difficulties. Besides aetiv
recruitment, the job will also involve keepin
track of possible applicant sources, to b
tapped as needed.
There remains the question of ovei
discrimination against women and minorities
When Maurine Buma was appointe<
accounting officer over 10 years ago, Scrogg
remembered, many still believed that certaii
jobs, like hers, could not be held by a woman
"The times have changed, fortunately," sail
Scroggs.
In a letter circulated to deans, senio
managers and department officers, Mine
commented, "The conscious intent to exclud>
is relatively rare. What frequently stands u) tb<
way is passivity, complacency, the expectatfoi
of failure or lack of insight into subtle action
that restrict opportunities."
Will 'Pay Off'
Scroggs expressed hope that University
hiring policies cembined with traininj
opportunities and emphasis on promotion wil
"pay off" some day with women and minority
employees rising to senior positions fron
within the University work force.
Unlike some institutions, the University
does not have, a formal, long-range objective
but sets a yearly goal based on a combinatioi
of past results, estimates of the availability ol
applicants and mangers' estimates of the hirinj
their departments will do.
There is no absolute numerical definition ol
the ultimate affirmative action goal. Instead
the objective is merely to have a diverse staff
at all job levels.
Are Stanford officials confident that the
University's program is well-aimed in that
direction? The response of most is
"affirmative."
