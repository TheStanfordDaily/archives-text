## Take Two 'Locust' Is Powerful CINEMA 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
There are not enough
complimentary adjectives in the
English language to describe The
Day of the Locust.
It is not a movie that you can
sit back and watch. You are
inexorably drawn to it and its
characters, whom you can love
and hate and for whom you can
feel sorry, but cannot be
neutral. They won't let you.
The Day of the Locust is so
powerful that it will haunt you
for days afterward. Its images
and characters are as indelible as
India ink.
Nathanael West's novel about
the people of Los Angeles — not
the celebrities, but those who
have come to California because
of the mystique — has been
captured perfectly on the screen.
Every scene, every character,
every setting has been blended
together into a masterpiece.
The Day of the Locust is a
snapshot of how Hollywood
was, how Hollywood is, and how
Hollywood will always be. This

is the best movie about
Hollywood ever made,
surpassing Sunset Boulevard and
A Star Is Born.
Every facet of the magic land
south of the Tehachapis is here
— the eccentrics, the star-gazers,
the would-be actresses, and
those who have come to die in
the sunshine.
It is a rich movie, wealthy in
insights of human beings, their
idiosyncrasies and their volatile
emotions. •

From the first moment we
are introduced to the power that
is within California, both
physically and emotionally. A
new set designer, Tod Hackett
(William Atherton, Goldie
Hawn's husband in The
Sugarland Express), straight out
of Yale, takes a room at the San
Bernardine Arms, a crumbling
apartment building.
His room has a gigantic crack
down one wall, from the
earthquake of 1933, symbolizing
the massive power capable of
being unleashed without a
second's notice in both the land
and the people.
Hackett covers the crack with
sketches for the painting he
hopes to do, The Burning of Los
Angeles. Through his friendships
with neighbors Faye and Harry
Greener, father and daughter
(Karen Black and Burgess
Meredith), and their friends, we
see the people on the outskirts
of the lights and the fame — but
we are actually seeing something
bigger — an entire society

through the eyes of three
people.
One of Locust's strengths
is its representation and vision of
Los Angeles without extraneous
characters confusing the story.
Even at two-and-a-half hours, it
is concise and well-knit.
The most superb
characterization of the film is
Donald Sutherland's Homer
Simpson, who agrees to
subsidize Faye's try for stardom.
Sutherland has been cast

perfectly — he is Homer
Simpson, the dull-witted,
lethargic accountant from
Waynesville.
This is Sutherland's crowning
achievement as an actor. One
can imagine no one else in the
role. Homer's blandness,
timidity, and facelessness are
communicated beautifully.
It is as if Nathanael West had
him in mind as he wrote. It is
Simpson who provides the
prototype for the locusts. When
he erupts into violence at the
spectacular movie premiere, the
"little people" erupt, too, in an
indescribable scene of terror and
thrilling cinematic effects,
culminating the movie perfectly
— it is the conclusion to which
the movie has been leading all
the time.
Through John Schlesinger's
excellent direction, each piece of
the story has been constructed
so that when the riot scene
occurs, we understand the crowd
and what is motivating them.
Between the frenzy of the people
and Hackett's gwn tortured
imagination, we see a study in
frustration vividly and
unforgettably.
Faye is a struggling actress
who plays every scene of her life
as if she is before a camera — she
never stops performing,
tenaciously clinging to dreams of
stardom. She is slightly schizoid
— sometimes she is a mean,
spoiled child; other times a
debonair woman-of-the-world.
She works for a madam
part-time, yet she won't let Tod
take her to bed. In this role
Karen Black is masterful, superb,
and perfect — but those words
don't do her justice. She has far
outdone her excellent work in
The Great Gatsby and Five Easy
Pieces, and this role will earn her
a place on the list of great
actresses.
William Atherton daringly
underplays Tod, barely a step
away from the unemotional and
uncharismatic. But actually this
blandness is Tod Hackett, whose
personality would not set the
world on fire. Atherton is fully
enveloped by Hackett and gives
an impressive performance,
holding his own against the
others.
John Schlesinger, the
director, Jerome Hellman, the
producer, and Waldo Salt, the
screenwriter, who all worked on
Midnight Cowboy (for which
they all won Oscars) have
outdone themselves.
Perhaps the hardest shots to
film, the final riot scenes, are
some of the most stunning ever
put on film. The Day of the
Locust is unforgettable and
should not be missed.
