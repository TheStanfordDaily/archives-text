# Senate Okays Process For Staff Grievances
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
recommended staff member grievance
procedures to President Richard
Lyman, despite protests that
University staff personnel are not
represented on the Senate.
Burton Richter, professor at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), accused senate members of
approving the rules without knowing if
staff members really wanted them.
"It strikes me that it's pretty hard
to draft a grievance procedure when
you don't know what they have
grievances against," Richter argued.
The current system permits
members of the Academic Staff
(Research), which includes regular and
senior research associates, to appeal
grievances only as high as the
Personnel Office, according to
Academic Secretary Eric Hutchinson.
But the new system would permit
all staff members to carry appeals to as
far as Lyman. Similar grievance
procedures for regular faculty
members were approved last week by
the Senate.
Richter Questions
Many of the research associates
work at SLAC, and Richter questioned
whether senators know enough about
them to change their grievance
methods.
"It seems to me that the senate
could do well to find out just what the
staff is, how it is appointed and
promoted," Richter argued. "There
are procedures and regulations set
down for appointment . . . and
promotion that did not exist before."
He said that these regulations had
changed I he makeup of the staff to an
extent (hat the senators "do not know
who are the academic staff."
A Denial
But Human Biology Prof. Colin
Pittendrigh, chairman of the Senate's
Committee on the Professoriate which
drafted the new grievance procedure,
denied that the senate was passing
legislation without representation.
"We are not legislating,"
Pittendrigh said. "If we pass this, it is a
recommendation" to Lyman. Lyman
must formally approve the new plan
before it can take effect.
Lyman criticized Richter's line of

reasoning.
"Unless you have a bill of
particulars | criticizing the plan|, it's
like telling the senate never to take
any action at all unless it knows
everything there is to know |on an
issue J," Lyman said.
Dismissed Argument
Pittendrigh also dismissed Richter's
argument.
"The administration, I think quite
properly, establishes details [of a
grievance procedure]; we establish
general principles," Pittendrigh said.
"Perhaps the details are still being
worked out at the laboratory level.
But I don't think we should hold up a
grievance procedure because of what
is .. . a SLAC problem."
English Prof. W. B. Carnochan
riticized the procedure's "heirarchic
tructure of appeal."
'Reinforces Itself'
"I don't see any way this structure
cannot help but reinforce itself,"
Camochan argued. He added that the
method "would be not helpful" if
current administrators were replaced
by more hostile ones.
In other business, the senate tabled
debate until next year on two
resolutions, which urged continued
financial support for innovative
education and closer faculty
monitoring of budgeting.
Faculty representatives approved
three other resolutions, which urged
careful consideration of long-range
budget matters and exploration of
increased teaching productivity
through televisioned instruction.

"It strikes me that it's pretty hard
to draft a grievance procedure when
you don't know what they have
grievances against," Richter argued.
The current system permits
members of the Academic Staff
(Research), which includes regular and
senior research associates, to appeal
grievances only as high as the
Personnel Office, according to
Academic Secretary Eric Hutchinson.
But the new system would permit
all staff members to carry appeals to as
far as Lyman. Similar grievance
procedures for regular faculty
members were approved last week by
the Senate.
Richter Questions
Many of the research associates
work at SLAC, and Richter questioned
whether senators know enough about
them to change their grievance
methods.
"It seems to me that the senate
could do well to find out just what the
staff is, how it is appointed and
promoted," Richter argued. "There
are procedures and regulations set
down for appointment . . . and
promotion that did not exist before."
He said that these regulations had
changed I he makeup of the staff to an
extent (hat the senators "do not know
who are the academic staff."
A Denial
But Human Biology Prof. Colin
Pittendrigh, chairman of the Senate's
Committee on the Professoriate which
drafted the new grievance procedure,
denied that the senate was passing
legislation without representation.
"We are not legislating,"
Pittendrigh said. "If we pass this, it is a
recommendation" to Lyman. Lyman
must formally approve the new plan
before it can take effect.
Lyman criticized Richter's line of

reasoning.
"Unless you have a bill of
particulars | criticizing the plan|, it's
like telling the senate never to take
any action at all unless it knows
everything there is to know |on an
issue J," Lyman said.
Dismissed Argument
Pittendrigh also dismissed Richter's
argument.
"The administration, I think quite
properly, establishes details [of a
grievance procedure]; we establish
general principles," Pittendrigh said.
"Perhaps the details are still being
worked out at the laboratory level.
But I don't think we should hold up a
grievance procedure because of what
is .. . a SLAC problem."
English Prof. W. B. Carnochan
riticized the procedure's "heirarchic
tructure of appeal."
'Reinforces Itself'
"I don't see any way this structure
cannot help but reinforce itself,"
Camochan argued. He added that the
method "would be not helpful" if
current administrators were replaced
by more hostile ones.
In other business, the senate tabled
debate until next year on two
resolutions, which urged continued
financial support for innovative
education and closer faculty
monitoring of budgeting.
Faculty representatives approved
three other resolutions, which urged
careful consideration of long-range
budget matters and exploration of
increased teaching productivity
through televisioned instruction.
The Faculty Senate yesterday
recommended staff member grievance
procedures to President Richard
Lyman, despite protests that
University staff personnel are not
represented on the Senate.
Burton Richter, professor at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), accused senate members of
approving the rules without knowing if
staff members really wanted them.
