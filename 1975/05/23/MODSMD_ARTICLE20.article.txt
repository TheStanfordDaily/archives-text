# Student Plays
## 
### 
This is the weekend for independent student drama and
musical productions. In addition to The Company's production
of Music Man (featured on page six), the Serra House Players
present The Odd Couple tonight and tomorrow in the Serra
House Lounge at 8 p.m.
In addition, Neil Simon's Plaza Suite will be showing in Soto
Lounge in Wilbur Hall. Performances are tonight, Saturday and
Sunday at 8 p.m.
If time is of no consequence then all three productions are
I worth seeing. But for the discriminating tastes, advanced
| viewings of the rehearsals have revealed that Music Man is a
| must and that the two Neil Simon comedies are very funny but
may require sincere audience appreciation of independent
student productions.
The time and effort devoted by all involved is well shown.
Admission to all performances is free.
The Drama Department's production of Mammy's Town will
also continue through Saturday night in Memorial Auditorium.
