# Symphony Features A Week Of Wagner
## MUSIC 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
The San Francisco Symphony is devoting its concerts this week
to the music of Richard Wagner, the 19th-century German
composer whose symphonies and operas remain an important part
of the concert genre.
In one performance soprano Jessye Norman sang the
"Wesendonck Songs," love songs Wagner composed for the
woman with whom he was having a "spiritual" affair.
Norman was incredible. Her beautiful voice was full of depth
and feeling, and flowed like a clear stream of flawless sound. Her
mellow tone was perfectly suited to the romantic, emotional cries
of the songs, and the audience loved her.
The orchestra as a whole provided good accompaniment, but
individual instrumental solos flawed the performance.
In "Stand Still!" the horns botched a few entrances; the viola
was out of tune in "In the Conservatory;" the cello was weak and
could barely be heard in "The Angel."

Norman also sang the "Love Death" from Wagner's opera,
Tristan and Isolde. In the part of Isolde, she sang even better than
she did in the other songs.
As the orchestra finished the "Prelude" from the opera, she
stood, reached out her arms as if in prayer, and delivered the most
moving and sensitive performance of the evening.
On its own, the orchestra was excellent. It opened with the
Symphony in C Major, a difficult warm-up that gave it no
problems. It played with youth and spirit, with flawless
phrasing, with flawless intonation.
The Symphony is one of Wagner's youthful works, composed in
1832 when he was 19, and reflects the influence of such masters as
Mozart and Beethoven. But in this piece Wagner's own style was
emerging, a style more evident in his later work, Siegfried Idyll.
The Siegfried Idyll is also a testimonial to love, but to happy
married love. It is illustrative of Wagner's happy and satisfied
romantic style, with light melodies in the winds and sensuous string
solos. The orchestra played it with peace and tranquility; a short
but pleasant trumpet solo climaxed the piece.
