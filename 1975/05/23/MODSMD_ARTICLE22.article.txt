# Company Production At Toyon
## "Music Man' Is Smashing 
### DAVID MILLER 
As any experienced stagehand
1 tell you, second dress
learsals of musicals are always
ickluster affairs, with fatigued
nd bored performers dragging
hemselves through their paces.
Apparently no stagehand was
round to clue in the cast of The
lusic Man Tuesday night in
'oyon Hall, however, because
s dress rehearsal showed
lore energy and commitment
han most shows develop in
erformance. With a little more
olishing, The Company's
pening Thursday should prove
o be thoroughly enjoyable.
For the few who have never
een Meredith Willson's smash
lusical, it involves the
dventures of Harold Hill,
ast-talking con-man and
/omanizer, as he works his
lagic on the people of River
)ity, lowa.
Presenting himself as a band
?ader, he sells the townspeople
xpensive instruments and
niforms, intending to slip
[uietly away before anyone
hinks of asking to hear the
•and. At the last moment Hill
neets his Waterloo in the form
>112 Marion Paroo, the local piano
eacher and librarian. Hill's
eduction of her succeeds a little
oo well. But all ends happily, of
ourse.
Doug Bedard breezed through
he part of Harold Hill with
uthority. His voice was strong
n solos and he handled the

difficult "Trouble" patter-song
well. Although none of the parts
showed a great depth of
characterization, Bedard was the
most adept with nuances.
As Marion, Gilda Lorensen's
face seemed to light up in her
solos, which she sang beautifully
with a sweet and unforced tone.
Although she seemed more at
home with her singing than her
acting, she carried herself with
grace throughout.
Simon Sanchez as Marcellus
Washburn, Hill's sidekick,
showed fine comic presence and
timing. He and Bedard worked
together like an experienced
vaudeville team. Their duet,
"The Sadder But Wiser Girl,"
was a high spot in the show.
Roy Holliday is properly
frenetic as Mayor Shinn, and his
outburst at the beginning of Act
11, which leaves the school board
members literally trembling, is
great.
Clark Sterling as Tommy
Djilas, the kid from the other
side of the tracks, turns in a
polished and complete
performance. The barbership
quartet — school board
members, Dan Lorenz, Ed
Firestone, Fred Baily and Daron
Tong — looked good but
teetered in and out of tune.
Marilyn Driver as Mrs. Paroo and
Carolyn Engleking as Mrs. Shinn
were disappointing in roles that
have great comic potential.
The real stars of the show,
however, were the dancers and
the chorus. The dancers were
quite capable, and Janet
Swanberg's choreography
showed them off to good
advantage. It is regrettable that
the dancers had only two places
to really shine — they would
have done wonders for the "76
Trombones" number, for
instance.
The chorus oohed and aahed,

hissed and booed, cheered and
raved, and in general mugged
like crazy through the entire
show. In the "Shipoopi" number
the chorus and the dancers were
able to work together, and the
result was a show-stopper.
Director Rob Christopher
handled his huge cast well, and
his direction showed some
inventive comic touches. It
seems he could have gotten
fuller, more detailed
characterizations out of his
actors, however.
David Thiemann's sets were
simple but attractive, but in a
room not designed for theatrical
performances, scene changes
were long and noisy, slowing
down an otherwise well-paced
show. Thiemann might have
done better in moving further
towards minimal, multi-purpose
set pieces, allowing the costumes
to establish a realistic setting.
Beth Benfield's costumes
were slightly tacky in some cases
(black suit with navy vest, white
pants with brown suit coat and
vest) but adequate, and the
dancers looked downright spiffy
in their outfits.
Whit Goodrich and his
well-drilled 17-piece orchestra
handled Willson's difficult
orchestration with verve and
aplomb. Never did the rehearsal
audience need to fear that a false
note would ruin a good scene.
Synchronization between
orchestra and singers was
occasionally off, but one good

rehearsal could take care of that
problem.
The Music Man will be
presented Thursday, May 22,
through Saturday, May 24, in
the Toy on Hall lounge, by
arrangement with Music Theatre
International, New York, N.Y.
Admission is free — and the
show is well worth the price.
