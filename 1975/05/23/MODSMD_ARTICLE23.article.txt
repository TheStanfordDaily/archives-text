# 'Indians' Lacks Insight
## THEATER 
### JANICE L. ROSS 
In a few days Indians, the
play by Arthur Kopit,will begin
its fourth month of
performances in San Francisco.
This unusually long run is
apparently more a testimony to
the inherent interest of the
subject, Indians, than it is a true
reflection of the play's quality.
On the surface Indians
attempts to chronicle the U.S.
government's exploitation and
eventual massacre of the Plains
Indians. The problem is that the
narration is presented in such a
heavy-handed manner that there
is little room for personal
discovery, insight or empathy.
Instead, as audience, we are
presented with a fait accompli;
there is no mystery, suspense or
drama. The historical facts are

dispassionately reiterated and
the famous characters dryly
impersonated.
Rather than enhancing the
story, Kopit's play within a play
staging has the effect of
undermining the seriousness and
tragedy of the events.
The spectacle of a broken and
defeated Sitting Bull forced to
tour the country with Bill's Wild
West Show appears trite rather
than tragic, and the Indian's
confrontation with the U.S.
senators becomes platitudinous
rather than profound.
Lee Sankowich, who so
successfully directed One Flew
Over The Cuckoo's Nest, seems
to have missed with Indians. The
overall structure is weak. Scenes,
events and episodes flow
together without any clear order
or progression, such that the
minor moments are commingled
with the major, producing an
overall bland and neutral effect.
Another difficulty is the fact
that most of the actors were
forced to assume two or three
roles because, although the cast
was large, the number of
characters was larger.
Unfortunately few if any of the
actors were up to the task; their
portrayals for the most part
sadly lacked conviction and
distinct characterization.
Will Marchetti as Buffalo Bill
and Dan Leegant as Ned
Buntline were the only two
actors who evidenced subtlety
and poetry. Marchetti's final
soliloquy, was the evening's high
point, because here Kopit wisely
dispensed with dramatic
pretense and spoke directly to
the audience.
If there is a lesson to be
learned from Indians it is
perhaps this: history may be
dull but histrionics are even
worse.

characters was larger.
Unfortunately few if any of the
actors were up to the task; their
portrayals for the most part
sadly lacked conviction and
distinct characterization.
Will Marchetti as Buffalo Bill
and Dan Leegant as Ned
Buntline were the only two
actors who evidenced subtlety
and poetry. Marchetti's final
soliloquy, was the evening's high
point, because here Kopit wisely
dispensed with dramatic
pretense and spoke directly to
the audience.
If there is a lesson to be
learned from Indians it is
perhaps this: history may be
dull but histrionics are even
worse.

In a few days Indians, the
play by Arthur Kopit,will begin
its fourth month of
performances in San Francisco.
This unusually long run is
apparently more a testimony to
the inherent interest of the
subject, Indians, than it is a true
reflection of the play's quality.
On the surface Indians
attempts to chronicle the U.S.
government's exploitation and
eventual massacre of the Plains
Indians. The problem is that the
narration is presented in such a
heavy-handed manner that there
is little room for personal
discovery, insight or empathy.
Instead, as audience, we are
presented with a fait accompli;
there is no mystery, suspense or
drama. The historical facts are

dispassionately reiterated and
the famous characters dryly
impersonated.
Rather than enhancing the
story, Kopit's play within a play
staging has the effect of
undermining the seriousness and
tragedy of the events.
The spectacle of a broken and
defeated Sitting Bull forced to
tour the country with Bill's Wild
West Show appears trite rather
than tragic, and the Indian's
confrontation with the U.S.
senators becomes platitudinous
rather than profound.
Lee Sankowich, who so
successfully directed One Flew
Over The Cuckoo's Nest, seems
to have missed with Indians. The
overall structure is weak. Scenes,
events and episodes flow
together without any clear order
or progression, such that the
minor moments are commingled
with the major, producing an
overall bland and neutral effect.
Another difficulty is the fact
that most of the actors were
forced to assume two or three
roles because, although the cast
was large, the number of
characters was larger.
Unfortunately few if any of the
actors were up to the task; their
portrayals for the most part
sadly lacked conviction and
distinct characterization.
Will Marchetti as Buffalo Bill
and Dan Leegant as Ned
Buntline were the only two
actors who evidenced subtlety
and poetry. Marchetti's final
