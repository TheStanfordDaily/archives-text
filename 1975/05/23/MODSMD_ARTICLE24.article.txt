# Potency Of Inaction In Pinter's 'Caretaker'
## 
### JANICE L. ROSS 
Although the dramatist
Harold Pinter certainly isn't a
dancer, at times he has the
distinct sensibility of a
choreographer in his use of
bodies and space.
In the San Francisco Actors
Ensemble's production of The
Caretaker, Pinter's genius for the
potency of inaction is evident.
The three characters in The
Caretaker, Mick, Ashton and
Davies each practice a strict
territorial possessiveness and
exhibit a definite and immutable
posture that is reminiscent of
Martha Graham's early use of
space and gesture.
Thematically the play
concerns two English brothers,
Mick and Ashton — who are
remodeling an old house in
London — and Davies, a drunken
tramp whom Ashton befriends.
Pinter's skill for characterization
through attitude is so acute that
almost before the actors begin to
speak, their roles are firmly
established.
Mick is a mercurial teaser. He
moves quickly and deftly through
the chaos of Ashton's partially
renovated room, occasionally
striking a pensive pose.
Davies is the outsider. He is a
bitter, opportunistic and
foul-smelling old man who
moves with the contracted fear
of someone who expects to be
struck at any moment. He
acknowledges all gifts and
handouts with a perfunctory
"Thanks very much mister, best
of luck mister," and greedily
grabs whatever is offered.
The Caretaker is classic Pinter
in its pervasive atmosphere of
futility and foreboding. Davies
represents the menacing intruder
who threatens to disturb the
quietude and fragile equilibrium
of Ashton and Mick's room, and
ultimately their lives.
Yet just when it appears that
Davis may succeed, Mick
provokes him into revealing his
true querulous and selfish nature
and Davies forfeits his best
opportunity of a lifetime.
Davies and Ashton are both
punished for their excesses;
Davies is expelled from the
house after he repeatedly
suggests that Ashton should be
returned to "the nuthouse."
And ironically Ashton is first
sent to the mental hospital for

electric shock treatment when,
as he explains, "I talked too
much, that was my big mistake."
The play ends with the
traditional absurdist dilemma;
the more the characters try to
change their situation the less
effective they become.
Ultimately they become
completely powerless, incapable
of making even the final gesture
of leaving.
Given the difficulty of staging
and performing Pinter, the San
Francisco Actors Ensemble
(formerly the S.F. Poverty
Theatre) has done an admirable
production. Their small
basement theatre augments the
claustrophobic tension of the
drama without impinging on the
audience's comfort.
Phillip Pruneau's direction is
intelligent and thorough, yet
uninspired. In a Pinter play
every word and every silence
must be made to count, but
Pruneau's direction lets precious
glances and stammered phrases
slip by.
The set too, although
effective as far as it went, should
have been cluttered to the point
of chaos in order to convey
Ashton's compulsive
materialism.
In general the acting was of
high quality. Kirk Ullery as
Davies was brilliant. He captured
the arthritic fatigue and peculiar
mannerisms of an old skid rogue
with remarkable authenticity.
David Skopp as Ashton and Tom
Maguire as Mick are competent
actors also, but they were
definitely outdone by Ullery.
Their major shortcoming was
the fact that they permitted the
audience occasional glimpses of
the actor behind the character.
Once or twice Maguire's cockney
accent unexplainably lapsed into
an Irish brogue or Southern
drawl, and Skopp often seemed
genuinely nervous rather than
lobotomized as he should have
been.
The weaknesses, however, are
minor. The S.F. Actors
Ensemble's production is an
engrossing and enjoyable effort
that contains a bit of the special
magic of both dance and drama.
'The Caretaker"continues through
mid-June on Thursday, Friday
and Saturday at 8:30 p.m. at
The Ensemble Studio Theatre in
San Francisco.
