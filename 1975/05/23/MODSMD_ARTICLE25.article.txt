## Pac-8 Separates North And South 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
There has long been an
unofficial gap in athletic talent
separating the Pac-B's northern
and southern schools.
That gap became official in
golf, tennis and swimming this
week when the Pac-8 eliminated
conference-wide championships
in favor of independent
Northern and Southern Division
competitions.
The Northern Division
consists of Washington,
Washington State, Oregon and
Oregon State. California,
Stanford, USC and UCLA make
up the Southern Division.
Pac-8 Executive Director
Wiles Hallock said the
motivation behind the move was
to save money and "promote
competitive balance in these
three sports."
Little Effect
The decision has little or no
effect on regular-season play
because, with few exceptions,
competition between the Pac-B's
northern and southern schools in
golf, tennis and swimming has
been limited to tournament
play. Continued tournament
participation will be subject to
each individual school's
discretion.
Hallock said round-robin dual
meets will decide future
divisional championships in
swimming and tennis, while each
division will hold a golf
tournament to determine its
champion.
The Pac-8 Council, comprised
of athletic representatives and
directors of the eight conference
schools, unanimously approved
the split in Pullman, Wash, at its
annual spring meeting.
Financial Crunch
Stanford Athletic Director
Joe Ruetz, who attended the
meeting, said: "The northern
schools have suffered rather
severe financial problems and
their competitive posture
vis-a-vis the southern schools has
been severely hampered as a
result. So what we've done is to
separate the schools into more
balanced divisions."
Ruetz added that the new
alignment won't affect
qualifications for the NCAA
championships.

The council also asked its
baseball coaches to consider a
proposal to form separate
baseball leagues in each division
by adding at least two
nonconference teams.
In tennis, the move takes on a
humanitarian note. The northern
schools will no longer have to
spend money to come down
south only to be humiliated by
the southern schools, as
happened last week at the Pac-8
Championships at Stanford.
Lots To Lose
"It costs an awful lot of
money for the four northern
schools to come down and lose
9-0," Stanford tennis Coach
Dick Gould said. "It's not good
for the schools and it's not good
for tennis. It [the Pac-B's
decision] seems like the logical
way to go."
Gould said Oregon has
already decided to drop its
tennis program because of the
economic crunch. Oregon State
is also considering similar action,
said Gould.
"You can't spend money you
don't have," he said.
"Somebody ought to tell the
government that."
Stanford swimming Coach
Jim Gaughran was not available
for comment. Golf Coach Bud
Finger expressed mild
dissatisfaction with the move,
hut doubted its severity.
"I'm sorry to see the move
maae. The northern schools
were coming along."
