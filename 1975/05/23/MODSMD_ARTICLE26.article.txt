# PALO Club Salutes Retiring Coach
## Another Tribute For Howie Dallmar 
### 
By MIKE TOLLIN
They ushered out an era Wednesday night. At
Ricky's Hyatt House, a group of about 200
alums, ex-jocks and fans paid tribute to Howie
Dallmar, Stanford's basketball coach for the past
21 years. In the process, they said farewell to one
of Stanford's most cherished institutions.
The banquet, staged by the PALO club, was
largely an unemotional affair; but then that was
always Dallmar's style. Ex-Stanford Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy, doing his
imitation of Don Rickles as master of ceremonies,
turned it into an comic roastathon.
In 1942, it was told,young Howie led Everett
Dean's Stanford basketballers to an NCAA
championship. After a win over Dartmouth in the
finals, Dallmar, then just a callow sophomore, was
named the tournament's outstanding player.
Dallmar compiled a 264-264 record. He
seemed to be locked in an unending struggle to
overcome the obstacles to building a winning
program at Stanford, and to beat his old nemesis
from the south, John Wooden.
He never managed to win a conference
championship, and in recent years, the
53-year-old Dallmar received a great deal of abuse
from fans who've lobbied for a more volatile
coach.
But through it all, Dallmar reminded the
gracious gentleman. Those who know him still
insist he has as great a knowledge of the game as
anyone, and as Murphy said, "He always had a
smile, always knew how to handle a situation."
Next year there will be a new man at the helm,
and maybe the Cardinals will win more games
under him.
But Dallmar has given Stanford some great
moments — like this year's Maples Miracle — that
we won't soon forget. And regardless of wins and
losses, it is hard to imagine a Stanford basketball
game without the imposing frame of Howard
Dallmar sitting calmly on the bench.
