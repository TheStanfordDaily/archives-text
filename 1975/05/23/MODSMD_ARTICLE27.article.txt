# IM Roundup
## BSU Runs Away With Track Meet 
### PETE BHATIA 
Orlando Mayes won both the
50 and 100 yard dashes last
weekend to lead the Black
Students Union (BSU) to its
second consecutive intramural
track and field championship.
Mayes won the two races in
excellent times of 5.5 (setting a
new IM record) and 10.1.
Hurdler Bill Johnson was also
instrumental in the BSU win
scoring a double victory in the
hurdles for the second

consecutive year.
Johnson won the 70 yard
intermediate hurdles with a
respectable 8.4 and came back
to take the 120 yard low hurdles
in 13.3.
Other BSU winners included
Kimball Smith in the 440 at
52.2 and BSU runners in all
three relay events, the 440, 880
and mile relays.
JRA and Theta Delt tied for
the runner-up spot. Both teams
scored 35 points in the meet, a
far cry from the BSU's 94
points. JRA got winning efforts
from two-miler Andy Martinez
(9:36.0) and long jumper Keith
Nakada (22' 9V2"). For the duck
thieves, Don Boutin was the
only individual winner with a
23.4 clocking in the 220,
although sprinter Shaun Sullivan
was runnerup to Mayes in both
the 50 and 100. Sullivan ran
10.5 in the 100 and 5.6 in the
50. He holds part of the new 50

record after running 5.5 in the
prelims.
The fourth place team spot
was claimed by Los Arcos with
32 meet points, while SAE was
fifth with 24.
The only other meet record
was set by the Delt's Gary
Anderson who launched the
shotput 55 feet even. It broke
the old meet record by over a
foot.
The win was worth 50 IM
points to the BSU, while Theta
Delt and JRA each earned 37'/2.
Los Arcos will earn 30 and SAE
will receive 25.

And speaking of SAE, its
organizers put together a huge
swimming team Wednesday to
swim away (if you'll pardon the
expression) with the IM crown.
And not only were there a lot of
them . . . they were good too.
SAE scored 64 meet points, far
outdistancing second place

finisher Bune, who scored 40.
Other teams in the top five
included Parbar Causeway, the
Melatrons and Theta Delts.

swimming team Wednesday to
swim away (if you'll pardon the
expression) with the IM crown.
And not only were there a lot of
them . . . they were good too.
SAE scored 64 meet points, far
outdistancing second place

finisher Bune, who scored 40.
Other teams in the top five
included Parbar Causeway, the
Melatrons and Theta Delts.
Orlando Mayes won both the
50 and 100 yard dashes last
weekend to lead the Black
Students Union (BSU) to its
second consecutive intramural
track and field championship.
Mayes won the two races in
excellent times of 5.5 (setting a
new IM record) and 10.1.
Hurdler Bill Johnson was also
instrumental in the BSU win
scoring a double victory in the
hurdles for the second

consecutive year.
Johnson won the 70 yard
intermediate hurdles with a
respectable 8.4 and came back
to take the 120 yard low hurdles
in 13.3.
Other BSU winners included
Kimball Smith in the 440 at
52.2 and BSU runners in all
three relay events, the 440, 880
and mile relays.
JRA and Theta Delt tied for
the runner-up spot. Both teams
scored 35 points in the meet, a
far cry from the BSU's 94
points. JRA got winning efforts
from two-miler Andy Martinez
(9:36.0) and long jumper Keith
Nakada (22' 9V2"). For the duck
thieves, Don Boutin was the
only individual winner with a
23.4 clocking in the 220,
although sprinter Shaun Sullivan
was runnerup to Mayes in both
the 50 and 100. Sullivan ran
10.5 in the 100 and 5.6 in the
50. He holds part of the new 50

record after running 5.5 in the
prelims.
The fourth place team spot
was claimed by Los Arcos with
32 meet points, while SAE was
fifth with 24.
The only other meet record
was set by the Delt's Gary
Anderson who launched the
shotput 55 feet even. It broke
the old meet record by over a
foot.
The win was worth 50 IM
points to the BSU, while Theta
Delt and JRA each earned 37'/2.
Los Arcos will earn 30 and SAE
will receive 25.
