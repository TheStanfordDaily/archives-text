# Arizona Governor Says Heritage An Asset
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
"Twenty-five years ago, people
were embarrassed to be Mexican. They
were either 'Spanish' or 'Latin
American.'" But Mexican-born Arizona
Gov. Raul Castro said his nationality is
an asset.
"I could be a good service [to his
people] where John Smith and John
Jones couldn't" by entering the legal
profession, Castro told business and
law students in several sessions here
yesterday. Castro shared his
experiences as a county attorney,
superior court judge and ambassador
to El Salvador and Bolivia.
A naturalized U.S. citizen, Castro
partially attributed his success in
international law to having a sense of
the way law is conducted in Europe
and Latin America. "Pleading is much
more important than courtroom work,
[in both |," he said.
Castro said he thought that Latin
America has been blatantly neglected
by the Ford administration's foreign
policy. "To this day, Ford and
Kissinger haven't visited Latin
America . . . Kissinger is ready to have
his Waterloo with Latin America."
Addressing domestic issues, Castro
said that immigration laws have been
unevenly enforced to exclude
Mexicans and Latin Americans. "There
has always been a deference to

Europeans even though their
occupations may be the same."
In many instances, "the overtone is
that if you're from south of the
border, you're on your last straw" and
will simply be a burden to the
economy, Castro said. Immigrants also
are deterred by the fact that Latin
American governments fear a "brain
drain" by the loss of students who
come to study in the United States
and prefer to stay, Castro maintained.
Questioned about recently arrived
Vietnamese refugees, Castro replied
that "we should worry about people at
home first." Nevertheless, since
"they're here, something has to be
done about it."
As governor of Arizona, Castro has
found that he must balance pressures
on him from the mining industry and
local and federal governments. While
trying to improve the situation of
workers, he must realize that
management has great influence in
Arizona, and"I still have to worry
about getting reelected."
Comparing his present influence on
issues such as immigration to that
which he had as a young immigration
officer, Castro saw his governorship as
giving him an influential base from
which to affect national policy, but
said he felt more effective in his
position 30 years ago.

MINORITY REPRESENTATIVE—Arizona Gov. Raul Castro yesterday
described his Mexican heritage as an asset, speaking to law and business
students here. Castro, who has served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador and
Bolivia, criticized President Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for an
inadequate foreign policy to Latin America.
"Twenty-five years ago, people
were embarrassed to be Mexican. They
were either 'Spanish' or 'Latin
American.'" But Mexican-born Arizona
Gov. Raul Castro said his nationality is
an asset.
"I could be a good service [to his
people] where John Smith and John
Jones couldn't" by entering the legal
profession, Castro told business and
law students in several sessions here
yesterday. Castro shared his
experiences as a county attorney,
superior court judge and ambassador
to El Salvador and Bolivia.
A naturalized U.S. citizen, Castro
partially attributed his success in
international law to having a sense of
the way law is conducted in Europe
and Latin America. "Pleading is much
more important than courtroom work,
[in both |," he said.
Castro said he thought that Latin
America has been blatantly neglected
by the Ford administration's foreign
policy. "To this day, Ford and
Kissinger haven't visited Latin
America . . . Kissinger is ready to have
his Waterloo with Latin America."
Addressing domestic issues, Castro
said that immigration laws have been
unevenly enforced to exclude
Mexicans and Latin Americans. "There
has always been a deference to

Europeans even though their
occupations may be the same."
In many instances, "the overtone is
that if you're from south of the
border, you're on your last straw" and
will simply be a burden to the
economy, Castro said. Immigrants also
are deterred by the fact that Latin
American governments fear a "brain
drain" by the loss of students who
come to study in the United States
and prefer to stay, Castro maintained.
Questioned about recently arrived
Vietnamese refugees, Castro replied
that "we should worry about people at
home first." Nevertheless, since
"they're here, something has to be
done about it."
As governor of Arizona, Castro has
found that he must balance pressures
on him from the mining industry and
local and federal governments. While
trying to improve the situation of
workers, he must realize that
management has great influence in
Arizona, and"I still have to worry
about getting reelected."
Comparing his present influence on
issues such as immigration to that
which he had as a young immigration
officer, Castro saw his governorship as
giving him an influential base from
which to affect national policy, but
said he felt more effective in his
position 30 years ago.
