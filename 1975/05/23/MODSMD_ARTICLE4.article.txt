# McCloskey: Will Student Support Stay?
## 
### KATHY BATTS Last of Two Parts 
While media speculation continues as to the
political future of Rep. Paul McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), the question of his student
support at Stanford remains open and
disputed.
In the 1974 GOP congressional primary,
McCloskey volunteers re-registered 4000 people
as Republicans in the 12th Congressional
District. Of those, 1000 were on this campus.
When the final vote tally was counted last
June, McCloskey had defeated conservative
Republican Gordon Knapp by a little over 800
votes. Most political observers have attributed
each of his narrow primary victories to his
support at Stanford.
But since last March, there seems to be a
"rumbling in the ranks" around the campus
community. McCloskey's vote to give military
aid to the Lon Nol regime in Cambodia, until
the start of the June monsoon rains, met with
vigorous protest here.
"I think that the initial adverse impact of his
[McCloskey's] statement, when ne came back
here to explain his vote, is what will stay with
the students," said junior Mike Lopez, former
summer intern for McCloskey.
'Felt Deceived'
4, 1 think some of his workers from the last
election felt deceived — although I hate to draw

this comparison — much like Nixon's volunteers
felt after Watergate broke."
Although Lopez, a Democrat, quickly added
that he held the highest respect for McCloskey,
he said he felt that, should McCloskey again run
for reelection, he would receive far less student
support.
"There's no way he's going to get 4000
Democrats to switch their registration next
time around," he asserted.
Lose Support
Lopez predicted that McCloskey would lose
a lot of his old support from the antiwar
movement. "All the Joan Baezes and David
Harrises will be in the opposing camp next
time" (former ASSU President David Harris is
expected to run in the 1976 Democratic
congressional primary here).
Junior Chris Gray offered a radical's view of
McCloskey as a "'rational capitalist.' He was
right on Vietnam, but for all the wrong reasons.
He saw it as a stupid war that couldn't be
won."
Gray also predicted that "categorically, he
will not get 1000 students to re-register next
year."
GOP Optimistic
However, Republican students remain
optimistic about McCloskey's student support
here.
Senior Luis Buhler, former president of
Stanford's California Republican League (CRL)

said he thought the congressman will continue
to garner strong student support.
"McCloskey has never been a liberal
stereotype," Buhler said. "He doesn't fit into
the mold. That's what attracts him to students.
"Obviously people won't support him to the
death," he continued. "But the point is, he
doesn't take stands just because he thinks they
will be popular with students."
Egil Krogh
Buhler claimed that McCloskey's recent
hiring of convicted White House "plumber"
Egil (Bud) Krogh was another example of
McCloskey's "willingness to take a stand at his
own political expense," adding that "he's the
only congressman I know who could get away
with hiring Bud Krogh."
Senior Kathy Cunningham, press assistant in
McCloskey's Palo Alto office, said staffers had
received little student reaction to Krogh's
hiring.
Senior Ed Anderson, a Republican
volunteer, said he was surprised at the action.
"It seems inconsistent with his criticism of
corruption in the Nixon administration."
However, he added that he respected
McCloskey for hiring someone on the basis of
merit rather than past mistakes.
Spoke Highly
Lopez said he remembered McCloskey
speaking highly of Krogh last summer. "I( isn't
like he made a 180-degree turnaround," he said.

Freshman Phil Ashey, current CRL
president, attributed McCloskey's action to "his
eccentric character. He does strange things like
that. But I think it shows a lot of political
courage."
Gray said he thought the hiring of Krogh
indicated that McCloskey would not be seeking
reelection.
50-50 Chance
McCloskey told the Daily Wednesday that
there was only a 50-50 chance that he would
attempt to keep his seat next year.
Cunningham asserted that McCloskey would
probably not make any decision until
November. She noted that several people had
talked to the congressman about running for
the U.S. Senate. "So far, none of the other
candidates are his type of Republican," she
said.
"I would personally prefer McCloskey to run
for the Senate," Anderson said. "But he would
have trouble getting past all the neanderthal,
crypto-fascists in our party. I doubt if he could
win the primary."
Stanford Democratic Committee (SDC)
President Doug Winslow disagreed. "He could
definitely win the GOP primary," Winslow, a
sophomore, claimed, "but he couldn't beat
Tunney. Cranston supports him [Tunney|, he's
the incumbent, and there's not enough to
criticize on his past record."

election felt deceived — although I hate to draw

this comparison — much like Nixon's volunteers
felt after Watergate broke."
Although Lopez, a Democrat, quickly added
that he held the highest respect for McCloskey,
he said he felt that, should McCloskey again run
for reelection, he would receive far less student
support.
"There's no way he's going to get 4000
Democrats to switch their registration next
time around," he asserted.
Lose Support
Lopez predicted that McCloskey would lose
a lot of his old support from the antiwar
movement. "All the Joan Baezes and David
Harrises will be in the opposing camp next
time" (former ASSU President David Harris is
expected to run in the 1976 Democratic
congressional primary here).
Junior Chris Gray offered a radical's view of
McCloskey as a "'rational capitalist.' He was
right on Vietnam, but for all the wrong reasons.
He saw it as a stupid war that couldn't be
won."
Gray also predicted that "categorically, he
will not get 1000 students to re-register next
year."
GOP Optimistic
However, Republican students remain
optimistic about McCloskey's student support
here.
Senior Luis Buhler, former president of
Stanford's California Republican League (CRL)

said he thought the congressman will continue
to garner strong student support.
"McCloskey has never been a liberal
stereotype," Buhler said. "He doesn't fit into
the mold. That's what attracts him to students.
"Obviously people won't support him to the
death," he continued. "But the point is, he
doesn't take stands just because he thinks they
will be popular with students."
Egil Krogh
Buhler claimed that McCloskey's recent
hiring of convicted White House "plumber"
Egil (Bud) Krogh was another example of
McCloskey's "willingness to take a stand at his
own political expense," adding that "he's the
only congressman I know who could get away
with hiring Bud Krogh."
Senior Kathy Cunningham, press assistant in
McCloskey's Palo Alto office, said staffers had
received little student reaction to Krogh's
hiring.
Senior Ed Anderson, a Republican
volunteer, said he was surprised at the action.
"It seems inconsistent with his criticism of
corruption in the Nixon administration."
However, he added that he respected
McCloskey for hiring someone on the basis of
merit rather than past mistakes.
Spoke Highly
Lopez said he remembered McCloskey
speaking highly of Krogh last summer. "I( isn't
like he made a 180-degree turnaround," he said.

Freshman Phil Ashey, current CRL
president, attributed McCloskey's action to "his
eccentric character. He does strange things like
that. But I think it shows a lot of political
courage."
Gray said he thought the hiring of Krogh
indicated that McCloskey would not be seeking
reelection.
50-50 Chance
McCloskey told the Daily Wednesday that
there was only a 50-50 chance that he would
attempt to keep his seat next year.
Cunningham asserted that McCloskey would
probably not make any decision until
November. She noted that several people had
talked to the congressman about running for
the U.S. Senate. "So far, none of the other
candidates are his type of Republican," she
said.
"I would personally prefer McCloskey to run
for the Senate," Anderson said. "But he would
have trouble getting past all the neanderthal,
crypto-fascists in our party. I doubt if he could
win the primary."
Stanford Democratic Committee (SDC)
President Doug Winslow disagreed. "He could
definitely win the GOP primary," Winslow, a
sophomore, claimed, "but he couldn't beat
Tunney. Cranston supports him [Tunney|, he's
the incumbent, and there's not enough to
criticize on his past record."
While media speculation continues as to the
political future of Rep. Paul McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), the question of his student
support at Stanford remains open and
disputed.
In the 1974 GOP congressional primary,
McCloskey volunteers re-registered 4000 people
as Republicans in the 12th Congressional
District. Of those, 1000 were on this campus.
When the final vote tally was counted last
June, McCloskey had defeated conservative
Republican Gordon Knapp by a little over 800
votes. Most political observers have attributed
each of his narrow primary victories to his
support at Stanford.
But since last March, there seems to be a
"rumbling in the ranks" around the campus
community. McCloskey's vote to give military
aid to the Lon Nol regime in Cambodia, until
the start of the June monsoon rains, met with
vigorous protest here.
"I think that the initial adverse impact of his
[McCloskey's] statement, when ne came back
here to explain his vote, is what will stay with
the students," said junior Mike Lopez, former
summer intern for McCloskey.

Senior Luis Buhler, former president of
Stanford's California Republican League (CRL)

said he thought the congressman will continue
to garner strong student support.
"McCloskey has never been a liberal
stereotype," Buhler said. "He doesn't fit into
the mold. That's what attracts him to students.
"Obviously people won't support him to the
death," he continued. "But the point is, he
doesn't take stands just because he thinks they
will be popular with students."
Egil Krogh
Buhler claimed that McCloskey's recent
hiring of convicted White House "plumber"
Egil (Bud) Krogh was another example of
McCloskey's "willingness to take a stand at his
own political expense," adding that "he's the
only congressman I know who could get away
with hiring Bud Krogh."
Senior Kathy Cunningham, press assistant in
McCloskey's Palo Alto office, said staffers had
received little student reaction to Krogh's
hiring.
Senior Ed Anderson, a Republican
volunteer, said he was surprised at the action.
"It seems inconsistent with his criticism of
corruption in the Nixon administration."
However, he added that he respected
McCloskey for hiring someone on the basis of
merit rather than past mistakes.
Spoke Highly
Lopez said he remembered McCloskey
speaking highly of Krogh last summer. "I( isn't
like he made a 180-degree turnaround," he said.

Freshman Phil Ashey, current CRL
president, attributed McCloskey's action to "his
eccentric character. He does strange things like
that. But I think it shows a lot of political
courage."
Gray said he thought the hiring of Krogh
indicated that McCloskey would not be seeking
reelection.
50-50 Chance
McCloskey told the Daily Wednesday that
there was only a 50-50 chance that he would
attempt to keep his seat next year.
Cunningham asserted that McCloskey would
probably not make any decision until
November. She noted that several people had
talked to the congressman about running for
the U.S. Senate. "So far, none of the other
candidates are his type of Republican," she
said.
"I would personally prefer McCloskey to run
for the Senate," Anderson said. "But he would
have trouble getting past all the neanderthal,
crypto-fascists in our party. I doubt if he could
win the primary."
Stanford Democratic Committee (SDC)
President Doug Winslow disagreed. "He could
definitely win the GOP primary," Winslow, a
sophomore, claimed, "but he couldn't beat
Tunney. Cranston supports him [Tunney|, he's
the incumbent, and there's not enough to
criticize on his past record."
While media speculation continues as to the
political future of Rep. Paul McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), the question of his student
support at Stanford remains open and
disputed.
In the 1974 GOP congressional primary,
McCloskey volunteers re-registered 4000 people
as Republicans in the 12th Congressional
District. Of those, 1000 were on this campus.
When the final vote tally was counted last
June, McCloskey had defeated conservative
Republican Gordon Knapp by a little over 800
votes. Most political observers have attributed
each of his narrow primary victories to his
support at Stanford.
But since last March, there seems to be a
"rumbling in the ranks" around the campus
community. McCloskey's vote to give military
aid to the Lon Nol regime in Cambodia, until
the start of the June monsoon rains, met with
vigorous protest here.
"I think that the initial adverse impact of his
[McCloskey's] statement, when ne came back
here to explain his vote, is what will stay with
the students," said junior Mike Lopez, former
summer intern for McCloskey.
'Felt Deceived'
4, 1 think some of his workers from the last
election felt deceived — although I hate to draw

this comparison — much like Nixon's volunteers
felt after Watergate broke."
Although Lopez, a Democrat, quickly added
that he held the highest respect for McCloskey,
he said he felt that, should McCloskey again run
for reelection, he would receive far less student
support.
"There's no way he's going to get 4000
Democrats to switch their registration next
time around," he asserted.
Lose Support
Lopez predicted that McCloskey would lose
a lot of his old support from the antiwar
movement. "All the Joan Baezes and David
Harrises will be in the opposing camp next
time" (former ASSU President David Harris is
expected to run in the 1976 Democratic
congressional primary here).
Junior Chris Gray offered a radical's view of
McCloskey as a "'rational capitalist.' He was
right on Vietnam, but for all the wrong reasons.
He saw it as a stupid war that couldn't be
won."
Gray also predicted that "categorically, he
will not get 1000 students to re-register next
year."
GOP Optimistic
However, Republican students remain
optimistic about McCloskey's student support
here.
Senior Luis Buhler, former president of
Stanford's California Republican League (CRL)

said he thought the congressman will continue
to garner strong student support.
"McCloskey has never been a liberal
