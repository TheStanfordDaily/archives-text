# 'Immorality' Or 'Freedom'?
## Iran Contract Challenged 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
There is "no compelling argument
that the [Iran] contract does not fall
within University guidelines,"
maintained Committee on Research
(C-Res) Chairman John Brauman
during an open meeting yesterday.
Several students, and faculty
members challenged the committee's
May 13 decision to allow a contract
between the Engineering and
Communication Departments and
National Iranian Radio and Television.
The speakers explained why they
thought the contract violates existing
guidelines, or suggested changes in the
University research policies.
Vice Provost for Research William

Massy defended the contract on the
grounds of academic freedom and said
that most decisions "are arguable
immoral by somebody else's
standards."
Senior Gerald Koblentz said the
committee is dodging the "moral
responsibility for the research done at
Stanford" by trying to take a neutral
position.
He said academic freedom cannot
be considered outside of a political
context, comparing the Iran contract
with developing a communication
system for Hitler's army. By refusing
to look at social consequences, C-Res
is being "foolishly optimistic" about
the course of history', he said.

Prof. Pierre Noyes of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SCAC)
predicted, "An intimate relationship
between Stanford and the Shah of Iran
is likely to have repercussions for
other members of the University."
He claimed that the committee was
originally set up because social
scientists feared their research would
be hampered if Stanford became
known as a "CIA cover agency."
French Prof. Raymond Giraud read
a letter signed by five professors
expressing "serious doubt among the
faculty" about the contract.
What Is 'Research'?
The letter's authors do not question
the right of the researchers to study
what they want, but "we do question
whether this enterprise can properly
be described as 'research' and whether
Stanford should be lending its name
and resources to assist a despotic and
undemocratic government," Giraud
said.
Brauman replied that he is "a little
hesitant to define what is and isn't
research."
Massy argued that some applied
research at the University is valid,
citing a project to convert solid waste
into usable energy.
He also maintained that the
University need not consider indirect
sociaJ outcomes, as long as researchers
are not involved in actually
implementing programs.
Nuclear Research
Research on nuclear power plants
would not be controversial, he said,
even though the research could some
day be used to build plants which
might be a health hazard.
Sophomore Tom Wainwright said
he was appalled by the University's
refusal to review the social effects as
part of its research guidelines.
He proposed that policies be
expanded to consider social and
environmental impact and to include
some "informed consent"
requirements similar to those used by

social science and medical researchers.
Faculty Statement
Brauman read part of a statement
regarding research adopted by the
Faculty Senate in 1971, which reads,
"The individual scholar should be free
to select the subject matter of his
research, to seek support from any
source for his work and to form his
own findings and conclusions."
He says the University should not
base its support "on speculations
concerning the political or moral
impropriety of the uses which might
be made of its results."
Anthropology and Education Prof.
Robert Textor objected to the
mechanisms for approving what he
called the "little Iran contract " in the

School of Education. Under this
contract students from the Free
University of Iran are here studying
curriculum development
In violation of School of Education
policies, Textor said, the contract was
approved before the faculty had a
chance to review it.
'Not Covert'
Massy replied that the procedure
was "certainly not covert from our
standpoint" and that it had been
considered by a faculty committee.
Graduate student John Pessin,
spoke in favor of the contract, urging
the committee not to "give in to the
complaining and whining of our local
moralists."
Brauman said that C-Res would
consider the recommendations heard
yesterday and eventually would
submit a report to the Faculty Senate.
When he refused to say when this
report would be made, several students
walked out of the meeting.
Brauman encouraged people to
submit their opinions in writing to the
committee so it could evaluate
research policies. Both he and Massy
maintained that they would not
re-evaluate the Iran contract unless the
guidelines were changed.

scientists feared their research would

French Prof. Raymond Giraud read
a letter signed by five professors
expressing "serious doubt among the
faculty" about the contract.

The letter's authors do not question
the right of the researchers to study
what they want, but "we do question
whether this enterprise can properly
be described as 'research' and whether
Stanford should be lending its name
and resources to assist a despotic and
undemocratic government," Giraud
said.
Brauman replied that he is "a little
hesitant to define what is and isn't
research."
Massy argued that some applied
research at the University is valid,
citing a project to convert solid waste
into usable energy.
He also maintained that the
University need not consider indirect
sociaJ outcomes, as long as researchers
are not involved in actually
implementing programs.
Nuclear Research
Research on nuclear power plants
would not be controversial, he said,
even though the research could some
day be used to build plants which
might be a health hazard.
Sophomore Tom Wainwright said
he was appalled by the University's
refusal to review the social effects as
part of its research guidelines.
He proposed that policies be
expanded to consider social and
environmental impact and to include
some "informed consent"
requirements similar to those used by

social science and medical researchers.
Faculty Statement
Brauman read part of a statement
regarding research adopted by the
Faculty Senate in 1971, which reads,
"The individual scholar should be free
to select the subject matter of his
research, to seek support from any
source for his work and to form his
own findings and conclusions."
He says the University should not
base its support "on speculations
concerning the political or moral
impropriety of the uses which might
be made of its results."
Anthropology and Education Prof.
Robert Textor objected to the
mechanisms for approving what he
called the "little Iran contract " in the

School of Education. Under this
contract students from the Free
University of Iran are here studying
curriculum development
In violation of School of Education
policies, Textor said, the contract was
approved before the faculty had a
chance to review it.
'Not Covert'
Massy replied that the procedure
was "certainly not covert from our
standpoint" and that it had been
considered by a faculty committee.
Graduate student John Pessin,
spoke in favor of the contract, urging
the committee not to "give in to the
complaining and whining of our local
moralists."
Brauman said that C-Res would
consider the recommendations heard
yesterday and eventually would
submit a report to the Faculty Senate.
When he refused to say when this
report would be made, several students
walked out of the meeting.
Brauman encouraged people to
submit their opinions in writing to the
committee so it could evaluate
research policies. Both he and Massy
maintained that they would not
re-evaluate the Iran contract unless the
guidelines were changed.
There is "no compelling argument
that the [Iran] contract does not fall
within University guidelines,"
maintained Committee on Research
(C-Res) Chairman John Brauman
during an open meeting yesterday.
Several students, and faculty
members challenged the committee's
May 13 decision to allow a contract
between the Engineering and
Communication Departments and
National Iranian Radio and Television.
The speakers explained why they
thought the contract violates existing
guidelines, or suggested changes in the
University research policies.
Vice Provost for Research William

Massy defended the contract on the
grounds of academic freedom and said
that most decisions "are arguable
immoral by somebody else's
standards."
Senior Gerald Koblentz said the
committee is dodging the "moral
responsibility for the research done at
Stanford" by trying to take a neutral
position.
He said academic freedom cannot
be considered outside of a political
context, comparing the Iran contract
with developing a communication
system for Hitler's army. By refusing
to look at social consequences, C-Res
is being "foolishly optimistic" about
the course of history', he said.

Prof. Pierre Noyes of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SCAC)
predicted, "An intimate relationship
between Stanford and the Shah of Iran
is likely to have repercussions for
other members of the University."
He claimed that the committee was
