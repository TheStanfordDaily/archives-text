# 'Immorality' Or 'Freedom'?
## Iran Contract Challenged 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
There is "no compelling argument
that the [Iran] contract does not fall
within University guidelines,"
maintained Committee on Research
(C-Res) Chairman John Brauman
during an open meeting yesterday.
Several students, and faculty
members challenged the committee's
May 13 decision to allow a contract
between the Engineering and
Communication Departments and
National Iranian Radio and Television.
The speakers explained why they
thought the contract violates existing
guidelines, or suggested changes in the
University research policies.
Vice Provost for Research William

Massy defended the contract on the
grounds of academic freedom and said
that most decisions "are arguable
immoral by somebody else's
standards."
Senior Gerald Koblentz said the
committee is dodging the "moral
responsibility for the research done at
Stanford" by trying to take a neutral
position.
He said academic freedom cannot
be considered outside of a political
context, comparing the Iran contract
with developing a communication
system for Hitler's army. By refusing
to look at social consequences, C-Res
is being "foolishly optimistic" about
the course of history', he said.

Prof. Pierre Noyes of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SCAC)
predicted, "An intimate relationship
between Stanford and the Shah of Iran
is likely to have repercussions for
other members of the University."
He claimed that the committee was
originally set up because social
scientists feared their research would
be hampered if Stanford became
known as a "CIA cover agency."
French Prof. Raymond Giraud read
a letter signed by five professors
expressing "serious doubt among the
faculty" about the contract.
What Is 'Research'?
The letter's authors do not question
the right of the researchers to study
what they want, but "we do question
whether this enterprise can properly
be described as 'research' and whether
Stanford should be lending its name
and resources to assist a despotic and
undemocratic government," Giraud
said.
Brauman replied that he is "a little
hesitant to define what is and isn't
research."
Massy argued that some applied
research at the University is valid,
citing a project to convert solid waste
into usable energy.
He also maintained that the
University need not consider indirect
