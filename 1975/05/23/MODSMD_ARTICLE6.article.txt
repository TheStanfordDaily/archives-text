# Conference On Education Nets Few Solutions
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
As the Conference on Urban
Education draws to a close here today,
participants have identified many
problems, but found few ready
solutions.
The conference, sponsored bv
Stanford's Urban/Rural Leadership
Training Institute (URLTI), began
Sunday and will conclude in a
summary workshop this morning.
About 70 parents and teachers from
10 urban sites across the country
attended.
Speakers included professors from
Howard. Harvard and other
universities, as well as lawyers and
school administrators. Program
Associate Helen Moore commented
outside attendance was unusual for the
URLTI program. "Generally we only
use Stanford staff in working with
problems."
Stanford Education Prof. Alfredo
Casteneda Monday contended that
socialization in schools is "based on
middle class values. Home values are
taught to be counterproductive to the
child's education." He advocated a
"biocognitive approach" to teaching
including non-middle class inputs.
Many speakers dealt with the
significance of IQ tests in urban
education. Howard Linguistics Prof.
Orlando Taylor maintained Monday
night that such tests discriminated
against blacks and urged boycotting
them.
The next night, Howard Journalism
Prof. Samuel Yette took a different
stance: "We black people are expert
excuse makers," he said. "But
performance is necessary now. We
need to get to the place where we're
making the tests."
Others calling for action included
Arthur Thomas, director of the
Bolinga Cultural Center at Wnght
State University in Ohio. He urged
continuing "the black community
struggle of the 19605. Those who have
in some way benefited from it mu t
now prepare the environment for the
children."
Participants also examined the
question of tax support for schools.
Pepperdine Economics Prof. Robert
Singleton favored "statewide
equalization â– of funding, with some
modifications." He saw several
drawbacks, however. "It hurts the
rich, influential people, and thus the
legislature would be pressured against
it."
Singleton also noted that presently
urban schools art 1 spending more per
pupil than rural ones and would stand
to lose money under this system.
Moore stated that many of the
suggestions arising from the
conference have been in the realm of
"alternative programs." This would
include what parents might do in
terms of teaching children at home,"
she said.
