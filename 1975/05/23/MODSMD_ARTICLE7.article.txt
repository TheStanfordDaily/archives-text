## On Farmworkers 
### 
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. has drawn up a proposal that
hould help clear up the protracted battle for
epresentation between the Teamsters and the United
Farm Workers, especially in the case of Gallo wineries.
All parties in the dispute should cooperate with the
Brown plan.
The most important feature of the Brown proposal is
its call for secret-ballot elections, in which the workers
themselves can decide who will represent them. The
results of this vote would be binding.
Since all the disputing forces in the often-bitter fight
have always contended that they have the workers'
problems at heart, they must respect the workers' desires
as expressed through a secret-ballot poll.
The Teamsters' threats to boycott the election are
thus disturbing, since it is certainly time that both unions
and Gallo agree to concentrate on reaching a workable
solution to this dispute. Carrying it on any further can
only hurt the laborers.
