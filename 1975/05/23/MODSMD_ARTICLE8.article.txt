# Coverage Bias
## 
### 
Dan Fiduccia's opinions
column ("Unfair Charge," Daily,
May 19) totally missed the point
of my earlier letter criticizing
the Daily for its minority
coverage.
I spoke of the Daily's neglect
of Stanford ethnics, and still
stand by my statement.
The Daily's minority coverage
is highly subjective and generally
breaks down into three
categories:
—stories on news events too
large to ignore;
—facets of minority life
involving racial strife; and
—culturally quaint activities.
Smug Journalists
Unrest in various ethnic
communities in the '60s caught
an erstwhile smug press
catnapping in total ignorance of
these communities. Since the
immediate' crisis subsided, the
press has again retreated into the
shadows.
This same spotty coverage
plagues the Daily. I do not
equate Stanford with these
communities, but the neglect of
the respective presses remain
comparable. The Daniel
Moynihan issue certainly is a
major news event — but how
aware is the Daily of other issues
of concern to Stanford
minorities? The Daily must
establish a working rapport with
Stanford minority communities
and not only when the scent of
controversy hangs heavy in the
wind.
One step towards this rapport
may be to become more
sensitive to how ethnics are
treated in features.
Stereotypes
How about fewer stories
denying or affirming that there
is or is not racial strife in certain
situations? And for God's sake,
can't there be a non-stereotyped
view of a cultural event? Leave
the oles and the quaint Indian
language at home and get
minority input on what is or is
not considered a stereotype.
I might add that non-coverage
also is a great Daily favorite.
Junipero House just completed a
four-day long symposium on
Asian American identity which
was virtually ignored by the
Daily. Why?
Not all Daily minority
coverage is pure shuck: there
have been stories which have.
oeen fair, sensitive, and probing,
ut I can't understand why such

stories must be so few, or why
the quantity of low-level articles
must abound in such numbers.
Sensitivity also must carry on
to the opinions page, where,
although the Daily certainly
should not tell authors what to
write, it should provide balance.
I felt this balance was also
acutely lacking in last week's
Forum page. While minorities
were very involved in the topic
"Student Movement," not one
columnist was an ethnic.
Fiduccia's retort abounded
with topics which never quite
got full coverage in the Daily.
To me, when there's a rally
purporting to fight minority
financial aids cutbacks (among
other concerns) and few
minorities planned or
participated in the
demonstration while a similar
rally last quarter on this topic
garnered heavy minority
leadership and participation,
that's a story.
Distorted Judgment
When Asian Americans at
UC-Davis are protesting and
Stanford Asian Americans hold a
symposium on the future of
Asian Americans at this
University, I ask why the former
was given greater coverage than
the latter.
When all four major ethnic
communities at Stanford
criticized the selection of
Moynihan as commencement
speaker, I see a myriad of news
and in-depth feature
possibilities. Yet the Daily has
provided nonexistent to barely
adequate coverage of these
issues.
My statement of Daily
neglect still stands.
