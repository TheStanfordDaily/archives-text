# Nine Iranian Graduate Students To Enroll In School Of Education
## 
### KAREN CAESAR 
The Free University of Iran has
initiated and funded a program
bringing nine students to study at the
School of Education here under a
$244,090 contract.
The 16-month program, according
to Education School Dean Arthur
Coladarci is "connected with the
development of the Free University of
Iran," modeled after the British Open
University. The students and faculty
there "work with a lot of utilization of
film and other technologies."

The purpose of the contract, says
Coladarci, is for the students "to
develop competence at the M.A. level
in biology, engineering, math and
chemistry and to translate that into
text materials and film use." The
students then will ultimately "join
professors in those areas throughout
rural areas" of Iran once they return.
The contract, "to my knowledge,"
does not have any connection with the
University's agreement to build a
communications satellite for the
country, says Coladarci.
There is, however, a great deal of
controversy surrounding the origin of
the "Little Iran Contract," as it has
been termed by Anthropology and
Education Prof. Robert Textor.
"It is fair to say that the Little Iran
Contract is controversial within the
School of Education faculty for the
following reasons," said Textor in a
statement to the Faculty Senate
Committee on Research last Thursday :
— "Some faculty members are
concerned that this contract implies
approval of the Free University of
Iran, and, by implication, of the
policies of the Shah's government.
— "Some faculty members are
concerned that normal admissions
standards were apparently less than
fully enforced.
— "Quite a few faculty members
are concerned about the fact that
there was no general faculty
discussion, much less any vote prior to
the signing of the contract. This is
despite the fact that the by-laws of the
School of Education, Article 11,
Section 3, provide that 'all matters of
internal administration in the school

shall be decided in conference or, if
necessary, by vote of those members
of the school who are members of the
Academic Council.' "
Textor reiterated in an interview
last night that "We [the education
faculty] weren't consulted and we
have doubts about the advisability of
signing a contract with a country
where there is reported to be one
secret police investigator for every 500
people of the population.
"Had the education faculty voted,
it would have been an open question
as to whether it [the contract] would
have passed," added Textor.
It is not unfeasible that there be a
connection between the proposed
communications satellite to be
developed by the Communication
Department and Prof. Bruce
Lusignan's electrical engineering class
and the current "Little Iran" contract,
because . quite reasonably they
[the Iranian students] would use the
conduit provided by" the satellite,
according to Textor.
Defining hardware as the
"bare-bones technological way of
pumping out information," and
software as "content," Textor
expressed the possibility that
"Lusignan-assisted hardware would use
software materials developed by
people being trained by the
[Education School] students" once
they return to Iran.
"I'm assuming they wish to have
these materials disseminated
throughout the Iranian Kingdom, and
the Lusignan system is one way of
getting things out."
