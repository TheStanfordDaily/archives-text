# Spouse Enjoys Campus Life

### Kiyoko Matsumura 
A friend of mine from Tokyo
recently said, "There's almost no
public transportation here and since I
can't drive, I'm terribly bored after my
children go to school. I'd like to
occasionally visit the school and help
out but my English is too poor. I used
to kill time watching TV in Japan, but
here I can understand none."
One usually assumes that the life of
a visiting foreign student wife is
boring. There are several reasons why
one might assume this. First of all,
many of us, especially those of us
from Japan have tremendous language
problems. Secondly, most of us are
used to extensive public transportation
systems. The language problem plus
not being to get around seems to limit
our activities.
However, in my case I really don't
mind being stranded in this new
situation. In Japan I was an editor for a
publishing company. I liked my job
but it was often extremely tiring. The
opportunity of coming to Stanford
with my microbiologist husband
presented itself to me as a holiday, or
at least an opportunity to have new
experiences.
Adult Education
Some of my friends here
acquainted me with the courses in
adult education at Foothill College
and the undergraduate division here at
Stanford.
Through the International Center I

learned I could make many friends,
especially through the discussion
groups which meet every three weeks
to talk about things like politics, social
welfare and education.
When these esoteric topics wear
thin, we often find ourselves talking
about things like the marriage
ceremony in Japan or cooking.
Loquaciousness amongst foreign
student wives seems to be an
international trait.
Village Atmosphere
Another reason that makes me feel
free is the atmosphere of Escondido
Village. We are surrounded by the tall
eucalyptus trees and well-cared lawn. I
heard that many plants were
transplanted from other countries.
Eucalyptus came from Australia,
persimmon from Japan and olive from
south Europe. It is amazing they adapt
so well.
One immediately wonders how all
the people, too, adapt so well. Each
foreign student couple comes from a
different part of the world with its
own culture. Americans, too, come
from different parts of America. With
so many differences it can only be
through extreme empathy and the
desire to understand others, that
makes it possible for us to have a
community.
Language is certainly one of the
tools we use to communicate. In
Escondido Village the most common

language is English. Spanish, Flemish,
Philippine, Chinese and Japanese or
mixtures of some are often heard in
our courts. It's both colorful and
amusing to see the mothers exchanging
their recipes with a flourish of hands,
sometimes in a mixture of languages.
No Prejudice
It may seem unusual or unreal that
many Japanese wives like myself have
not met with any traumatic
experiences since we've come to
Stanford.
I myself have yet to encounter
overt prejudice or to see examples of
the racial discrimination I read about
in Japan. Perhaps Escondido Village is
just a colony.
If so, it must be one of the only
international ones where the wisdom
and code to live closely with different
people are piling up.
At any ran-, is this America? I
really don't krudfiy.

own culture. Americans, too, come
from different parts of America. With
so many differences it can only be
through extreme empathy and the
desire to understand others, that
makes it possible for us to have a
community.
Language is certainly one of the
tools we use to communicate. In
Escondido Village the most common

language is English. Spanish, Flemish,
Philippine, Chinese and Japanese or
mixtures of some are often heard in
our courts. It's both colorful and
amusing to see the mothers exchanging
their recipes with a flourish of hands,
sometimes in a mixture of languages.
No Prejudice
It may seem unusual or unreal that
many Japanese wives like myself have
not met with any traumatic
experiences since we've come to
Stanford.
I myself have yet to encounter
overt prejudice or to see examples of
the racial discrimination I read about
in Japan. Perhaps Escondido Village is
just a colony.
If so, it must be one of the only
international ones where the wisdom
and code to live closely with different
people are piling up.
At any ran-, is this America? I
really don't krudfiy.

A friend of mine from Tokyo
recently said, "There's almost no
public transportation here and since I
can't drive, I'm terribly bored after my
children go to school. I'd like to
occasionally visit the school and help
out but my English is too poor. I used
to kill time watching TV in Japan, but
here I can understand none."
One usually assumes that the life of
a visiting foreign student wife is
boring. There are several reasons why
one might assume this. First of all,
many of us, especially those of us
from Japan have tremendous language
problems. Secondly, most of us are
used to extensive public transportation
systems. The language problem plus
not being to get around seems to limit
our activities.
However, in my case I really don't
mind being stranded in this new
situation. In Japan I was an editor for a
publishing company. I liked my job
but it was often extremely tiring. The
opportunity of coming to Stanford
with my microbiologist husband
presented itself to me as a holiday, or
at least an opportunity to have new
experiences.
Adult Education
Some of my friends here
acquainted me with the courses in
adult education at Foothill College
and the undergraduate division here at
Stanford.
Through the International Center I

learned I could make many friends,
especially through the discussion
groups which meet every three weeks
to talk about things like politics, social
welfare and education.
When these esoteric topics wear
thin, we often find ourselves talking
about things like the marriage
ceremony in Japan or cooking.
Loquaciousness amongst foreign
student wives seems to be an
international trait.
Village Atmosphere
Another reason that makes me feel
free is the atmosphere of Escondido
Village. We are surrounded by the tall
eucalyptus trees and well-cared lawn. I
heard that many plants were
transplanted from other countries.
Eucalyptus came from Australia,
persimmon from Japan and olive from
south Europe. It is amazing they adapt
so well.
One immediately wonders how all
the people, too, adapt so well. Each
foreign student couple comes from a
different part of the world with its
own culture. Americans, too, come
from different parts of America. With
so many differences it can only be
through extreme empathy and the
desire to understand others, that
makes it possible for us to have a
