## From Fairbanks To Fellini Palo Alto: A Film Buff's Dream 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
What do you do when you
miss the first run of a movie you
wanted to see? What do you do
when you have the urge to see a
classic like The Big Sleep or It
Happened One Nights What do
you do when foreign films strike
your fancy?
The answer is simple — truck
to downtown Palo Alto, where
the Biograph Theater on
Ramona St., the Festival Cinema
on Hamilton Ave., and the New
Varsity Theater on University
Ave. run movies you may either
have missed or fondly
remember.
Theatres like this are not
unusual — the Mountain View
Theatre is similar to the
Biograph, the Vitaphone in
Saratoga also runs classics, and
there are many in San Francisco.
What is unusual is that three of
them sprouted here in Palo Alto.
The Stanford Theater, also on
University Avenue, used to show
second-run movies but has since
been used only for an occasional
live event. However, it is
interesting to note that the
Stanford and the Varsity are
owned by the same foursome,
while Larry Rockwell, a partner
in the Biograph, is aJso a partner
in the Festival.
Rockwell explains the
reasons behind the opening six
months ago of the Biograph,
which was named for the first
theater that opened in New
York City, in 1894 (for the
trivia freaks, it was also the
theatre outside of which John
Dillinger was killed in 1934). It
specializes in second-run films
that were not, for one reason or

another, warmly received on
their initial release, or movies
that have been in general release
for a long time still having
commercial value (Chinatown,
for example).
Birds And Bees
"We thought it would work
. . . because there are a lot of
films that disappear very
quickly. .. . The film we did
best with was Birds Do It, Bees
Do It, because it had played at
the Menlo, I believe, for only
two or three weeks. It had been
incredibly well-received at the
Film Festival in San Francisco,
had a lot of press — it was
almost a first-run film. It had
had its quote, 'first-run'
appearance at the Menlo, but
they had to drop it because they
were bringing in . . . Godfather
II."
The Festival Cinema is almost
two years old. It replaced the
Academy Cinema, which opened
and closed in a relatively short
time, starved, according to
Rockwell, on a diet of musicals.
The theater was renovated,
sloped for better visibility, and
reopened with a new name
under the management of
Rockwell and Jerome Gary.
"The intention was to
basically show classic movies,"
says Rockwell. "It's something
that I've had experience with in
New York City. I've worked for
various film distributors and I
really love film, and I love the
history of film. And I don't
particularly like modern new
first-run films, with a few
notable exceptions, and it
seemed to me that there's a
market in this area.

"As far as I knew at that
point, nobody had tried it
before. And I knew enough
people around here that liked
movies to think that there were
probably more . . . (people]
who would be more willing to
spend their money seeing
something that they knew than
to go out and spend three dollars
to see something they didn't
know." So Rockwell's hobby
began to double as a career.
Inspiration
The office at the Festival
from which everything is
managed is crammed into a
corner behind the candy
counter, surrounded by a library
of film books. It is overseen by a
parrot named Jo-Jo, who
supplies inspiration. The walls,
like those of the Biograph, are
covered with posters and stills.
The New Varsity Theater and
Restaurant, on the other hand,
more closely resembles your
run-of-the-mill theater, if you
ignore the restaurant tables and
directors' chairs, each with a
star's name on it.
The New Varsity has been
operating under the management
of Tom and Bev Corbin and
Glenn and Judith Lugge for
about one year. The quartet's
original plans for the theatre
included a restaurant, which
opened about five months ago.
According to employee Lynn
Glover, who has worked there
for two-and-a-half years, even
before it was the New Varsity,
"We brought back some of the
movies that didn't get enough
exposure." The New Varsity
shows a wide variety of movies
— foreien films, classics."cult"

films. There is a very good
chance that something you've
missed will turn up at the New
Varsity — anything from Day
For Night to Cabaret to Fellini's
Roma.
Self-Competition
The Stanford once had its
share of classics and second-runs,
but as Glover admitted, "It's
hard to compete with yourself"
(the Festival and Biograph seem
to have a similar problem,
because the Biograph is in the
process of changing hands, not
having lived up to its original
potential).
Glover attributes the quality
in the theater's program to the
time the Corbins and the Lugges
spent constructing their format,
as well as their booker's ability
to follow through with movies
that complement each other
(example: Dr. Strangelove and
Little Murders, black humor
deluxe).
The New Varsity has an easier
time pairing its features because
it has 35mm projectors, and
35mm features are generally
available. The Festival on the
other hand, according to
employee Alan Ligda, has a
more difficult time because it is
only equipped with 16mm
projectors. Getting the movies
they want when they want them
is their biggest problem.
Distributors often want 35
percent of the gross (and if both
do, that's 70 percent, a situation
that quickly ceases to be
profitable) and to have a double
feature of their movies. United
Artists, for example, will not be
thrilled to send a picture that
will be billed with a feature from

Paramount.
Who patronizes these
theaters? Ligda says, "You get
sort of a mixed lot — we get a
lot of college students, we get a
lot of what we euphemistically
call senior citizens, we get a lot
of kids, depending on what we
show. Like we showed the
original Mark of Zorro, with
Douglas Fairbanks — we had so
many kids in there you wouldn't
have believed it, a lot of them
accompanied by their parents or
their grandparents."
Lynn Glover recognizes many
New Varsity customers as
regular patrons. "The clientele in
this theater is a lot better than
when it was a commercial
theater ... I don't know what
the difference is, but they're a
much nicer clientele. They like
this idea — this is new to them —
so they open up and they like
it," she says.
Economy is one big
attraction of these theaters: the
$2 admission prices are
considerably less than what
you'd pay to see a brand-new
release. The New Varsity has an
additional magnet called the
Varsity dollar, given with each
admission and worth a dollar on
the next visit.
Although it may seem
unusual that these theaters
should appear in Palo Alto,
rather than other cities on the
Peninsula, Rockwell offers an
explanation: "I think there are a
lot of aspects involved. One is
the area has a higher-than
average income, and, concurrent
to that, or as a result of that, or
building up to that, a
higher-than-average intelligence
or educational level. That derives
in part from Stanford and in
part from the types of industry
that have somehow gravitated to
this area — electronics,
aerospace, and so on ... I think
the fact that Stanford is here
makes Palo Alto a certain
cultural center, whether it wants
to be or not."
Alan Ligda voices similar
opinions, believing that after 70
years Palo Alto is finally coming
alive as a city, rather than a
suburb.
Box Office Bingo
There are very few stars,
directors, or movies that can be
counted on to definitely draw
customers. Katharine Hepburn,
Humphrey Bogart, and the Marx

Brothers do very well at the
Festival, but so do Orson Welles
and Francois Truffaut.
At the New Varsity, says
Glover, Federico Fellini does
well. She also contends that
everything does well because of
their condensed screening
periods of days instead of a
week like the Biograph and
Festival. This tends to draw the
people in, because if they put
off seeing the movie, it's gone.
Ligda says, "Musicals have
done quite well recently because
of That's Entertainment, which
got a lot of people in to see
them that had never seen a
musical before."
Will the oldies theaters spring
survive when the nostalgia craze
is gone? Both Ligda and
Rockwell think so. Ligda asserts,
"I think [theaters like this) are
here to stay. I don/t think it has
much to do with the nostalgia
thing at all ... I think people
that go see pictures like Bogart
pictures are interested in going
to see good pictures . . . because
they are good pictures. You
don't go and see something like
Beach Blanket Bingo. . . I guess

you could call that nostalgia
today . . . |but] nobody in their
right mind would go across the
street to see a picture like that."
Larry Rockwell obviously
hopes it is not just a fad.
"Film," he says, "is the only
20th century art. Film is
the only art that everyone can
taik about and relate to.
Everyone watches flicks on
television, everyone goes to the
movies on Saturday night.
Everyone has fond memories of
getting in for under 12 until
they were 15 years old.
"Whether the nostalgia craze'
is gone, there will always remain
a certain nostalgia about film
experiences that people have
had. People are encountering an
awareness of the cinema as an
art form as opposed to purely an
entertainment device. And I
think that that realization is
going to keep theaters that show
quality cinema as opposed to
'movies' — it's going to keep us
going. . , . There are still going to
be people that are going to go to
a movie theater because they've
never seen Citizen Kane in a
movie theater."

THREE FOR THE ROAD—This happy trio (guess which one is Elizabeth Taylor) has found a way to
heat the energy crisis — their friend, National Velvet. Local film buffs can beat the high cost of
first-run movie-going by attending Palo Alto "oldies" theaters that feature lower prices, second-run
films and classics.

right mind would go across the
street to see a picture like that."
Larry Rockwell obviously
hopes it is not just a fad.
"Film," he says, "is the only
20th century art. Film is
the only art that everyone can
taik about and relate to.
Everyone watches flicks on
television, everyone goes to the
movies on Saturday night.
Everyone has fond memories of
getting in for under 12 until
they were 15 years old.
"Whether the nostalgia craze'
is gone, there will always remain
a certain nostalgia about film
experiences that people have
had. People are encountering an
awareness of the cinema as an
art form as opposed to purely an
entertainment device. And I
think that that realization is
going to keep theaters that show
quality cinema as opposed to
'movies' — it's going to keep us
going. . , . There are still going to
be people that are going to go to
a movie theater because they've
never seen Citizen Kane in a
movie theater."

THREE FOR THE ROAD—This happy trio (guess which one is Elizabeth Taylor) has found a way to

first-run movie-going by attending Palo Alto "oldies" theaters that feature lower prices, second-run

CHEERS—Clark Gable doesn't seem to be paying much attention
to his drink as he eyes Marilyn Monroe in this scene from "The
Misfits" No one who enjoys old, golden films is a misfit at any of Palo
Alto's three classic movie houses.
What do you do when you
miss the first run of a movie you
wanted to see? What do you do
when you have the urge to see a
classic like The Big Sleep or It
Happened One Nights What do
you do when foreign films strike
your fancy?
The answer is simple — truck
to downtown Palo Alto, where
the Biograph Theater on
Ramona St., the Festival Cinema
on Hamilton Ave., and the New
Varsity Theater on University
Ave. run movies you may either
have missed or fondly
remember.
Theatres like this are not
unusual — the Mountain View
Theatre is similar to the
Biograph, the Vitaphone in
Saratoga also runs classics, and
there are many in San Francisco.
What is unusual is that three of
them sprouted here in Palo Alto.
The Stanford Theater, also on
University Avenue, used to show
second-run movies but has since
been used only for an occasional
live event. However, it is
interesting to note that the
Stanford and the Varsity are
owned by the same foursome,
while Larry Rockwell, a partner
in the Biograph, is aJso a partner
in the Festival.
Rockwell explains the
reasons behind the opening six
months ago of the Biograph,
which was named for the first
theater that opened in New
York City, in 1894 (for the
trivia freaks, it was also the
theatre outside of which John
Dillinger was killed in 1934). It
specializes in second-run films
that were not, for one reason or

another, warmly received on
their initial release, or movies
that have been in general release
for a long time still having
commercial value (Chinatown,
for example).
Birds And Bees
"We thought it would work
. . . because there are a lot of
films that disappear very
quickly. .. . The film we did
best with was Birds Do It, Bees
Do It, because it had played at
the Menlo, I believe, for only
two or three weeks. It had been
incredibly well-received at the
Film Festival in San Francisco,
had a lot of press — it was
almost a first-run film. It had
had its quote, 'first-run'
appearance at the Menlo, but
they had to drop it because they
were bringing in . . . Godfather
II."
The Festival Cinema is almost
two years old. It replaced the
Academy Cinema, which opened
and closed in a relatively short
time, starved, according to
Rockwell, on a diet of musicals.
The theater was renovated,
sloped for better visibility, and
reopened with a new name
under the management of
Rockwell and Jerome Gary.
"The intention was to
basically show classic movies,"
says Rockwell. "It's something
that I've had experience with in
New York City. I've worked for
various film distributors and I
really love film, and I love the
history of film. And I don't
particularly like modern new
first-run films, with a few
notable exceptions, and it
seemed to me that there's a
market in this area.

"As far as I knew at that
point, nobody had tried it
before. And I knew enough
people around here that liked
movies to think that there were
probably more . . . (people]
who would be more willing to
spend their money seeing
something that they knew than
to go out and spend three dollars
to see something they didn't
know." So Rockwell's hobby
began to double as a career.
Inspiration
The office at the Festival
from which everything is
managed is crammed into a
corner behind the candy
counter, surrounded by a library
of film books. It is overseen by a
parrot named Jo-Jo, who
supplies inspiration. The walls,
like those of the Biograph, are
covered with posters and stills.
The New Varsity Theater and
Restaurant, on the other hand,
more closely resembles your
run-of-the-mill theater, if you
ignore the restaurant tables and
directors' chairs, each with a
star's name on it.
The New Varsity has been
operating under the management
of Tom and Bev Corbin and
Glenn and Judith Lugge for
about one year. The quartet's
original plans for the theatre
included a restaurant, which
opened about five months ago.
According to employee Lynn
Glover, who has worked there
for two-and-a-half years, even
before it was the New Varsity,
"We brought back some of the
movies that didn't get enough
exposure." The New Varsity
shows a wide variety of movies
— foreien films, classics."cult"

films. There is a very good
chance that something you've
missed will turn up at the New
Varsity — anything from Day
For Night to Cabaret to Fellini's
Roma.
Self-Competition
The Stanford once had its
share of classics and second-runs,
but as Glover admitted, "It's
hard to compete with yourself"
(the Festival and Biograph seem
to have a similar problem,
because the Biograph is in the
process of changing hands, not
having lived up to its original
potential).
Glover attributes the quality
in the theater's program to the
time the Corbins and the Lugges
spent constructing their format,
as well as their booker's ability
to follow through with movies
that complement each other
(example: Dr. Strangelove and
Little Murders, black humor
deluxe).
The New Varsity has an easier
time pairing its features because
it has 35mm projectors, and
35mm features are generally
available. The Festival on the
other hand, according to
employee Alan Ligda, has a
more difficult time because it is
only equipped with 16mm
projectors. Getting the movies
they want when they want them
is their biggest problem.
Distributors often want 35
percent of the gross (and if both
do, that's 70 percent, a situation
that quickly ceases to be
profitable) and to have a double
feature of their movies. United
Artists, for example, will not be
thrilled to send a picture that
will be billed with a feature from

Paramount.
Who patronizes these
theaters? Ligda says, "You get
sort of a mixed lot — we get a
lot of college students, we get a
lot of what we euphemistically
call senior citizens, we get a lot
of kids, depending on what we
show. Like we showed the
original Mark of Zorro, with
Douglas Fairbanks — we had so
many kids in there you wouldn't
have believed it, a lot of them
accompanied by their parents or
their grandparents."
Lynn Glover recognizes many
New Varsity customers as
regular patrons. "The clientele in
this theater is a lot better than
when it was a commercial
theater ... I don't know what
the difference is, but they're a
much nicer clientele. They like
this idea — this is new to them —
so they open up and they like
it," she says.
Economy is one big
attraction of these theaters: the
$2 admission prices are
considerably less than what
you'd pay to see a brand-new
release. The New Varsity has an
additional magnet called the
Varsity dollar, given with each
admission and worth a dollar on
the next visit.
Although it may seem
unusual that these theaters
should appear in Palo Alto,
rather than other cities on the
Peninsula, Rockwell offers an
explanation: "I think there are a
lot of aspects involved. One is
the area has a higher-than
average income, and, concurrent
to that, or as a result of that, or
building up to that, a
higher-than-average intelligence
or educational level. That derives
in part from Stanford and in
part from the types of industry
that have somehow gravitated to
this area — electronics,
aerospace, and so on ... I think
the fact that Stanford is here
makes Palo Alto a certain
cultural center, whether it wants
to be or not."
Alan Ligda voices similar
opinions, believing that after 70
years Palo Alto is finally coming
alive as a city, rather than a
suburb.
Box Office Bingo
There are very few stars,
directors, or movies that can be
counted on to definitely draw
customers. Katharine Hepburn,
Humphrey Bogart, and the Marx

Brothers do very well at the
Festival, but so do Orson Welles
and Francois Truffaut.
At the New Varsity, says
Glover, Federico Fellini does
well. She also contends that
everything does well because of
their condensed screening
periods of days instead of a
week like the Biograph and
Festival. This tends to draw the
people in, because if they put
off seeing the movie, it's gone.
Ligda says, "Musicals have
done quite well recently because
of That's Entertainment, which
got a lot of people in to see
them that had never seen a
musical before."
Will the oldies theaters spring
survive when the nostalgia craze
is gone? Both Ligda and
Rockwell think so. Ligda asserts,
"I think [theaters like this) are
here to stay. I don/t think it has
much to do with the nostalgia
thing at all ... I think people
that go see pictures like Bogart
pictures are interested in going
to see good pictures . . . because
they are good pictures. You
don't go and see something like
Beach Blanket Bingo. . . I guess

you could call that nostalgia
today . . . |but] nobody in their
right mind would go across the
street to see a picture like that."
Larry Rockwell obviously

cultural center, whether it wants
to be or not."
Alan Ligda voices similar
opinions, believing that after 70
years Palo Alto is finally coming
alive as a city, rather than a
suburb.
Box Office Bingo
There are very few stars,
directors, or movies that can be
counted on to definitely draw
customers. Katharine Hepburn,
Humphrey Bogart, and the Marx

Brothers do very well at the
Festival, but so do Orson Welles
and Francois Truffaut.
At the New Varsity, says
Glover, Federico Fellini does
well. She also contends that
everything does well because of
their condensed screening
periods of days instead of a
week like the Biograph and
Festival. This tends to draw the
people in, because if they put
off seeing the movie, it's gone.
Ligda says, "Musicals have
done quite well recently because
of That's Entertainment, which
got a lot of people in to see
them that had never seen a
musical before."
Will the oldies theaters spring
survive when the nostalgia craze
is gone? Both Ligda and
Rockwell think so. Ligda asserts,
"I think [theaters like this) are
here to stay. I don/t think it has
much to do with the nostalgia
thing at all ... I think people
that go see pictures like Bogart
pictures are interested in going
to see good pictures . . . because
they are good pictures. You
don't go and see something like
Beach Blanket Bingo. . . I guess

you could call that nostalgia
today . . . |but] nobody in their
right mind would go across the
street to see a picture like that."
Larry Rockwell obviously
hopes it is not just a fad.
"Film," he says, "is the only
20th century art. Film is
the only art that everyone can
taik about and relate to.
Everyone watches flicks on
television, everyone goes to the
movies on Saturday night.
Everyone has fond memories of
getting in for under 12 until
they were 15 years old.
"Whether the nostalgia craze'
is gone, there will always remain
a certain nostalgia about film
experiences that people have
had. People are encountering an
awareness of the cinema as an
art form as opposed to purely an
entertainment device. And I
think that that realization is
going to keep theaters that show
quality cinema as opposed to
'movies' — it's going to keep us
going. . , . There are still going to
be people that are going to go to
a movie theater because they've
never seen Citizen Kane in a
movie theater."

THREE FOR THE ROAD—This happy trio (guess which one is Elizabeth Taylor) has found a way to

first-run movie-going by attending Palo Alto "oldies" theaters that feature lower prices, second-run
films and classics.

CHEERS—Clark Gable doesn't seem to be paying much attention
to his drink as he eyes Marilyn Monroe in this scene from "The
Misfits" No one who enjoys old, golden films is a misfit at any of Palo
Alto's three classic movie houses.
What do you do when you
miss the first run of a movie you
wanted to see? What do you do
when you have the urge to see a
classic like The Big Sleep or It
Happened One Nights What do
you do when foreign films strike
your fancy?
The answer is simple — truck
to downtown Palo Alto, where
the Biograph Theater on
Ramona St., the Festival Cinema
on Hamilton Ave., and the New
Varsity Theater on University
Ave. run movies you may either
have missed or fondly
remember.
Theatres like this are not
unusual — the Mountain View
Theatre is similar to the
Biograph, the Vitaphone in
Saratoga also runs classics, and
there are many in San Francisco.
What is unusual is that three of
them sprouted here in Palo Alto.
The Stanford Theater, also on
University Avenue, used to show
second-run movies but has since
been used only for an occasional
live event. However, it is
interesting to note that the
Stanford and the Varsity are
owned by the same foursome,
while Larry Rockwell, a partner
in the Biograph, is aJso a partner
in the Festival.
Rockwell explains the
reasons behind the opening six
months ago of the Biograph,
which was named for the first
theater that opened in New
York City, in 1894 (for the
trivia freaks, it was also the
theatre outside of which John
Dillinger was killed in 1934). It
specializes in second-run films
that were not, for one reason or

another, warmly received on
their initial release, or movies
that have been in general release
for a long time still having
commercial value (Chinatown,
for example).
Birds And Bees
"We thought it would work
. . . because there are a lot of
films that disappear very
quickly. .. . The film we did
best with was Birds Do It, Bees
Do It, because it had played at
the Menlo, I believe, for only
two or three weeks. It had been
incredibly well-received at the
Film Festival in San Francisco,
had a lot of press — it was
almost a first-run film. It had
had its quote, 'first-run'
appearance at the Menlo, but
they had to drop it because they
were bringing in . . . Godfather
II."
The Festival Cinema is almost
two years old. It replaced the
Academy Cinema, which opened
and closed in a relatively short
time, starved, according to
Rockwell, on a diet of musicals.
The theater was renovated,
sloped for better visibility, and
reopened with a new name
under the management of
Rockwell and Jerome Gary.
"The intention was to
basically show classic movies,"
says Rockwell. "It's something
that I've had experience with in
New York City. I've worked for
various film distributors and I
really love film, and I love the
history of film. And I don't
particularly like modern new
first-run films, with a few
notable exceptions, and it
seemed to me that there's a
market in this area.

"As far as I knew at that
point, nobody had tried it
before. And I knew enough
people around here that liked
movies to think that there were
probably more . . . (people]
who would be more willing to
spend their money seeing
something that they knew than
to go out and spend three dollars
to see something they didn't
know." So Rockwell's hobby
began to double as a career.
Inspiration
The office at the Festival
from which everything is
managed is crammed into a
corner behind the candy
counter, surrounded by a library
of film books. It is overseen by a
parrot named Jo-Jo, who
supplies inspiration. The walls,
like those of the Biograph, are
covered with posters and stills.
The New Varsity Theater and
Restaurant, on the other hand,
more closely resembles your
run-of-the-mill theater, if you
ignore the restaurant tables and
directors' chairs, each with a
star's name on it.
The New Varsity has been
operating under the management
of Tom and Bev Corbin and
Glenn and Judith Lugge for
about one year. The quartet's
original plans for the theatre
included a restaurant, which
opened about five months ago.
According to employee Lynn
Glover, who has worked there
for two-and-a-half years, even
before it was the New Varsity,
"We brought back some of the
movies that didn't get enough
exposure." The New Varsity
shows a wide variety of movies
— foreien films, classics."cult"

films. There is a very good
chance that something you've
missed will turn up at the New
Varsity — anything from Day
For Night to Cabaret to Fellini's
Roma.
Self-Competition
The Stanford once had its
share of classics and second-runs,
but as Glover admitted, "It's
hard to compete with yourself"
(the Festival and Biograph seem
to have a similar problem,
because the Biograph is in the
process of changing hands, not
having lived up to its original
potential).
Glover attributes the quality
in the theater's program to the
time the Corbins and the Lugges
spent constructing their format,
as well as their booker's ability
to follow through with movies
that complement each other
(example: Dr. Strangelove and
Little Murders, black humor
deluxe).
The New Varsity has an easier
time pairing its features because
it has 35mm projectors, and
35mm features are generally
available. The Festival on the
other hand, according to
employee Alan Ligda, has a
more difficult time because it is
only equipped with 16mm
projectors. Getting the movies
they want when they want them
is their biggest problem.
Distributors often want 35
percent of the gross (and if both
do, that's 70 percent, a situation
that quickly ceases to be
profitable) and to have a double
feature of their movies. United
Artists, for example, will not be
thrilled to send a picture that
will be billed with a feature from

Paramount.
Who patronizes these
theaters? Ligda says, "You get
sort of a mixed lot — we get a
lot of college students, we get a
lot of what we euphemistically
call senior citizens, we get a lot
of kids, depending on what we
show. Like we showed the
original Mark of Zorro, with
Douglas Fairbanks — we had so
many kids in there you wouldn't
have believed it, a lot of them
accompanied by their parents or
their grandparents."
Lynn Glover recognizes many
New Varsity customers as
regular patrons. "The clientele in
this theater is a lot better than
when it was a commercial
theater ... I don't know what
the difference is, but they're a
much nicer clientele. They like
this idea — this is new to them —
so they open up and they like
it," she says.
Economy is one big
attraction of these theaters: the
$2 admission prices are
considerably less than what
you'd pay to see a brand-new
release. The New Varsity has an
additional magnet called the
Varsity dollar, given with each
admission and worth a dollar on
the next visit.
Although it may seem
unusual that these theaters
should appear in Palo Alto,
rather than other cities on the
Peninsula, Rockwell offers an
explanation: "I think there are a
lot of aspects involved. One is
the area has a higher-than
average income, and, concurrent
to that, or as a result of that, or
building up to that, a
higher-than-average intelligence
or educational level. That derives
in part from Stanford and in
part from the types of industry
that have somehow gravitated to
this area — electronics,
aerospace, and so on ... I think
the fact that Stanford is here
makes Palo Alto a certain
cultural center, whether it wants
to be or not."
Alan Ligda voices similar
opinions, believing that after 70

of kids, depending on what we
show. Like we showed the
original Mark of Zorro, with
Douglas Fairbanks — we had so
many kids in there you wouldn't
have believed it, a lot of them
accompanied by their parents or
their grandparents."
Lynn Glover recognizes many
New Varsity customers as
regular patrons. "The clientele in
this theater is a lot better than
when it was a commercial
theater ... I don't know what
the difference is, but they're a
much nicer clientele. They like
this idea — this is new to them —
so they open up and they like
it," she says.
Economy is one big
attraction of these theaters: the
$2 admission prices are
considerably less than what
you'd pay to see a brand-new
release. The New Varsity has an
additional magnet called the
Varsity dollar, given with each
admission and worth a dollar on
the next visit.
Although it may seem
unusual that these theaters
should appear in Palo Alto,
rather than other cities on the
Peninsula, Rockwell offers an
explanation: "I think there are a
lot of aspects involved. One is
the area has a higher-than
average income, and, concurrent
to that, or as a result of that, or
building up to that, a
higher-than-average intelligence
or educational level. That derives
in part from Stanford and in
part from the types of industry
that have somehow gravitated to
this area — electronics,
aerospace, and so on ... I think
the fact that Stanford is here
makes Palo Alto a certain
cultural center, whether it wants
to be or not."
Alan Ligda voices similar
opinions, believing that after 70
years Palo Alto is finally coming
alive as a city, rather than a
suburb.
Box Office Bingo
There are very few stars,
directors, or movies that can be
counted on to definitely draw
customers. Katharine Hepburn,
Humphrey Bogart, and the Marx

Brothers do very well at the
Festival, but so do Orson Welles
and Francois Truffaut.
At the New Varsity, says
Glover, Federico Fellini does
well. She also contends that
everything does well because of
their condensed screening
periods of days instead of a
week like the Biograph and
Festival. This tends to draw the
people in, because if they put
off seeing the movie, it's gone.
Ligda says, "Musicals have
done quite well recently because
of That's Entertainment, which
got a lot of people in to see
them that had never seen a
musical before."
Will the oldies theaters spring
survive when the nostalgia craze
is gone? Both Ligda and
Rockwell think so. Ligda asserts,
"I think [theaters like this) are
here to stay. I don/t think it has
much to do with the nostalgia
thing at all ... I think people
that go see pictures like Bogart
pictures are interested in going
to see good pictures . . . because
they are good pictures. You
don't go and see something like
Beach Blanket Bingo. . . I guess

you could call that nostalgia
today . . . |but] nobody in their
right mind would go across the
street to see a picture like that."
Larry Rockwell obviously
hopes it is not just a fad.
"Film," he says, "is the only
20th century art. Film is
the only art that everyone can
taik about and relate to.
Everyone watches flicks on
television, everyone goes to the
movies on Saturday night.
Everyone has fond memories of
getting in for under 12 until
they were 15 years old.
"Whether the nostalgia craze'
is gone, there will always remain
a certain nostalgia about film
experiences that people have
had. People are encountering an
awareness of the cinema as an
art form as opposed to purely an
entertainment device. And I
think that that realization is
going to keep theaters that show
quality cinema as opposed to
'movies' — it's going to keep us
going. . , . There are still going to
be people that are going to go to
a movie theater because they've
never seen Citizen Kane in a
movie theater."

CHEERS—Clark Gable doesn't seem to be paying much attention
to his drink as he eyes Marilyn Monroe in this scene from "The
Misfits" No one who enjoys old, golden films is a misfit at any of Palo
Alto's three classic movie houses.
What do you do when you
miss the first run of a movie you
wanted to see? What do you do
when you have the urge to see a
classic like The Big Sleep or It
Happened One Nights What do
you do when foreign films strike
your fancy?
The answer is simple — truck
to downtown Palo Alto, where
the Biograph Theater on
Ramona St., the Festival Cinema
on Hamilton Ave., and the New
Varsity Theater on University
Ave. run movies you may either
have missed or fondly
remember.
Theatres like this are not
unusual — the Mountain View
Theatre is similar to the
Biograph, the Vitaphone in
Saratoga also runs classics, and
there are many in San Francisco.
What is unusual is that three of
them sprouted here in Palo Alto.
The Stanford Theater, also on
University Avenue, used to show
second-run movies but has since
been used only for an occasional
live event. However, it is
interesting to note that the
Stanford and the Varsity are
owned by the same foursome,
while Larry Rockwell, a partner
in the Biograph, is aJso a partner
in the Festival.
Rockwell explains the
reasons behind the opening six
months ago of the Biograph,
which was named for the first
theater that opened in New
York City, in 1894 (for the
trivia freaks, it was also the
theatre outside of which John
Dillinger was killed in 1934). It
specializes in second-run films
that were not, for one reason or

another, warmly received on
their initial release, or movies
that have been in general release
for a long time still having
commercial value (Chinatown,
for example).
Birds And Bees
"We thought it would work
. . . because there are a lot of
films that disappear very
quickly. .. . The film we did
best with was Birds Do It, Bees
Do It, because it had played at
the Menlo, I believe, for only
two or three weeks. It had been
incredibly well-received at the
Film Festival in San Francisco,
had a lot of press — it was
almost a first-run film. It had
had its quote, 'first-run'
appearance at the Menlo, but
they had to drop it because they
were bringing in . . . Godfather
II."
The Festival Cinema is almost
two years old. It replaced the
Academy Cinema, which opened
and closed in a relatively short
time, starved, according to
Rockwell, on a diet of musicals.
The theater was renovated,
sloped for better visibility, and
reopened with a new name
under the management of
Rockwell and Jerome Gary.
"The intention was to
basically show classic movies,"
says Rockwell. "It's something
that I've had experience with in
New York City. I've worked for
various film distributors and I
really love film, and I love the
history of film. And I don't
particularly like modern new
first-run films, with a few
notable exceptions, and it
seemed to me that there's a
market in this area.

"As far as I knew at that
point, nobody had tried it
before. And I knew enough
people around here that liked
movies to think that there were
probably more . . . (people]
who would be more willing to
spend their money seeing
something that they knew than
to go out and spend three dollars
to see something they didn't
know." So Rockwell's hobby
began to double as a career.
Inspiration
The office at the Festival
from which everything is
managed is crammed into a
corner behind the candy
counter, surrounded by a library
of film books. It is overseen by a
parrot named Jo-Jo, who
supplies inspiration. The walls,
like those of the Biograph, are
covered with posters and stills.
The New Varsity Theater and
Restaurant, on the other hand,
more closely resembles your
run-of-the-mill theater, if you
ignore the restaurant tables and
directors' chairs, each with a
star's name on it.
The New Varsity has been
operating under the management
of Tom and Bev Corbin and
Glenn and Judith Lugge for
about one year. The quartet's
original plans for the theatre
included a restaurant, which
opened about five months ago.
According to employee Lynn
Glover, who has worked there
for two-and-a-half years, even
before it was the New Varsity,
"We brought back some of the
movies that didn't get enough
exposure." The New Varsity
shows a wide variety of movies
— foreien films, classics."cult"

films. There is a very good
chance that something you've
missed will turn up at the New
Varsity — anything from Day
For Night to Cabaret to Fellini's
Roma.
Self-Competition
The Stanford once had its
share of classics and second-runs,
but as Glover admitted, "It's
hard to compete with yourself"
(the Festival and Biograph seem
to have a similar problem,
because the Biograph is in the
process of changing hands, not
having lived up to its original
potential).
Glover attributes the quality
in the theater's program to the
time the Corbins and the Lugges
spent constructing their format,
as well as their booker's ability
to follow through with movies
that complement each other
(example: Dr. Strangelove and
Little Murders, black humor
deluxe).
The New Varsity has an easier
time pairing its features because
it has 35mm projectors, and
35mm features are generally
available. The Festival on the
other hand, according to
employee Alan Ligda, has a
more difficult time because it is
only equipped with 16mm
projectors. Getting the movies
they want when they want them
is their biggest problem.
Distributors often want 35
percent of the gross (and if both
do, that's 70 percent, a situation
that quickly ceases to be
profitable) and to have a double
feature of their movies. United
Artists, for example, will not be
thrilled to send a picture that
will be billed with a feature from

Paramount.
Who patronizes these
theaters? Ligda says, "You get
sort of a mixed lot — we get a
lot of college students, we get a
lot of what we euphemistically
call senior citizens, we get a lot
of kids, depending on what we
show. Like we showed the
original Mark of Zorro, with
Douglas Fairbanks — we had so
many kids in there you wouldn't
have believed it, a lot of them
accompanied by their parents or
their grandparents."

The Stanford once had its
share of classics and second-runs,
but as Glover admitted, "It's
hard to compete with yourself"
(the Festival and Biograph seem
to have a similar problem,
because the Biograph is in the
process of changing hands, not
having lived up to its original
potential).
Glover attributes the quality
in the theater's program to the
time the Corbins and the Lugges
spent constructing their format,
as well as their booker's ability
to follow through with movies
that complement each other
(example: Dr. Strangelove and
Little Murders, black humor
deluxe).
The New Varsity has an easier
time pairing its features because
it has 35mm projectors, and
35mm features are generally
available. The Festival on the
other hand, according to
employee Alan Ligda, has a
more difficult time because it is
only equipped with 16mm
projectors. Getting the movies
they want when they want them
is their biggest problem.
Distributors often want 35
percent of the gross (and if both
do, that's 70 percent, a situation
that quickly ceases to be
profitable) and to have a double
feature of their movies. United
Artists, for example, will not be
thrilled to send a picture that
will be billed with a feature from

Paramount.
Who patronizes these
theaters? Ligda says, "You get
sort of a mixed lot — we get a
lot of college students, we get a
lot of what we euphemistically
call senior citizens, we get a lot
of kids, depending on what we
show. Like we showed the
original Mark of Zorro, with
Douglas Fairbanks — we had so
many kids in there you wouldn't
have believed it, a lot of them
accompanied by their parents or
their grandparents."
Lynn Glover recognizes many
New Varsity customers as
regular patrons. "The clientele in
this theater is a lot better than
when it was a commercial
theater ... I don't know what
the difference is, but they're a
much nicer clientele. They like
this idea — this is new to them —
so they open up and they like
it," she says.
Economy is one big
attraction of these theaters: the
$2 admission prices are
considerably less than what
you'd pay to see a brand-new
release. The New Varsity has an
additional magnet called the
Varsity dollar, given with each
admission and worth a dollar on
the next visit.
Although it may seem
unusual that these theaters
should appear in Palo Alto,
rather than other cities on the
Peninsula, Rockwell offers an
explanation: "I think there are a
lot of aspects involved. One is
the area has a higher-than
average income, and, concurrent
to that, or as a result of that, or
building up to that, a
higher-than-average intelligence
or educational level. That derives
in part from Stanford and in
part from the types of industry
that have somehow gravitated to
this area — electronics,
aerospace, and so on ... I think
the fact that Stanford is here
makes Palo Alto a certain
cultural center, whether it wants
to be or not."
Alan Ligda voices similar
opinions, believing that after 70
years Palo Alto is finally coming
alive as a city, rather than a
suburb.
Box Office Bingo
There are very few stars,
directors, or movies that can be
counted on to definitely draw
customers. Katharine Hepburn,
Humphrey Bogart, and the Marx

Brothers do very well at the
Festival, but so do Orson Welles
and Francois Truffaut.
At the New Varsity, says
Glover, Federico Fellini does
well. She also contends that
everything does well because of
their condensed screening
periods of days instead of a
week like the Biograph and
Festival. This tends to draw the
people in, because if they put
off seeing the movie, it's gone.
Ligda says, "Musicals have
done quite well recently because
of That's Entertainment, which
got a lot of people in to see
them that had never seen a
musical before."
Will the oldies theaters spring
survive when the nostalgia craze
is gone? Both Ligda and
Rockwell think so. Ligda asserts,
"I think [theaters like this) are
here to stay. I don/t think it has
much to do with the nostalgia
thing at all ... I think people
that go see pictures like Bogart
pictures are interested in going
to see good pictures . . . because
they are good pictures. You
don't go and see something like
Beach Blanket Bingo. . . I guess

you could call that nostalgia
today . . . |but] nobody in their
right mind would go across the
street to see a picture like that."
Larry Rockwell obviously
hopes it is not just a fad.
"Film," he says, "is the only
20th century art. Film is
the only art that everyone can
taik about and relate to.
Everyone watches flicks on
television, everyone goes to the
movies on Saturday night.
Everyone has fond memories of
getting in for under 12 until
they were 15 years old.
"Whether the nostalgia craze'
is gone, there will always remain
a certain nostalgia about film
experiences that people have
had. People are encountering an
awareness of the cinema as an
art form as opposed to purely an
entertainment device. And I
think that that realization is
going to keep theaters that show
quality cinema as opposed to
'movies' — it's going to keep us
going. . , . There are still going to
be people that are going to go to
a movie theater because they've
never seen Citizen Kane in a
movie theater."

CHEERS—Clark Gable doesn't seem to be paying much attention

Misfits" No one who enjoys old, golden films is a misfit at any of Palo
Alto's three classic movie houses.
What do you do when you
miss the first run of a movie you
wanted to see? What do you do
when you have the urge to see a
classic like The Big Sleep or It
Happened One Nights What do
you do when foreign films strike
your fancy?
The answer is simple — truck
to downtown Palo Alto, where
the Biograph Theater on
Ramona St., the Festival Cinema
on Hamilton Ave., and the New
Varsity Theater on University
Ave. run movies you may either
have missed or fondly
remember.
Theatres like this are not
unusual — the Mountain View
Theatre is similar to the
Biograph, the Vitaphone in
Saratoga also runs classics, and
there are many in San Francisco.
What is unusual is that three of
them sprouted here in Palo Alto.
The Stanford Theater, also on
University Avenue, used to show
second-run movies but has since
been used only for an occasional
live event. However, it is
interesting to note that the
Stanford and the Varsity are
owned by the same foursome,
while Larry Rockwell, a partner
in the Biograph, is aJso a partner
in the Festival.
Rockwell explains the
reasons behind the opening six
months ago of the Biograph,
which was named for the first
theater that opened in New
York City, in 1894 (for the
trivia freaks, it was also the
theatre outside of which John
Dillinger was killed in 1934). It
specializes in second-run films
that were not, for one reason or

another, warmly received on
their initial release, or movies
that have been in general release
for a long time still having
commercial value (Chinatown,
for example).
Birds And Bees
"We thought it would work
. . . because there are a lot of
films that disappear very
quickly. .. . The film we did
best with was Birds Do It, Bees
Do It, because it had played at
the Menlo, I believe, for only
two or three weeks. It had been
incredibly well-received at the
Film Festival in San Francisco,
had a lot of press — it was
almost a first-run film. It had
had its quote, 'first-run'
appearance at the Menlo, but
they had to drop it because they
were bringing in . . . Godfather
II."
The Festival Cinema is almost
two years old. It replaced the
Academy Cinema, which opened
and closed in a relatively short
time, starved, according to
Rockwell, on a diet of musicals.
The theater was renovated,
sloped for better visibility, and
reopened with a new name
under the management of
Rockwell and Jerome Gary.
"The intention was to
basically show classic movies,"
says Rockwell. "It's something
that I've had experience with in
New York City. I've worked for
various film distributors and I
really love film, and I love the
history of film. And I don't
particularly like modern new
first-run films, with a few
notable exceptions, and it
seemed to me that there's a
market in this area.

"As far as I knew at that
point, nobody had tried it
before. And I knew enough
people around here that liked
movies to think that there were
probably more . . . (people]
who would be more willing to
spend their money seeing
something that they knew than
to go out and spend three dollars
to see something they didn't
know." So Rockwell's hobby
began to double as a career.
Inspiration
The office at the Festival
from which everything is
managed is crammed into a
corner behind the candy
counter, surrounded by a library
of film books. It is overseen by a
parrot named Jo-Jo, who
supplies inspiration. The walls,
like those of the Biograph, are
covered with posters and stills.
The New Varsity Theater and
Restaurant, on the other hand,
more closely resembles your
run-of-the-mill theater, if you
ignore the restaurant tables and
directors' chairs, each with a
star's name on it.
The New Varsity has been
operating under the management
of Tom and Bev Corbin and
Glenn and Judith Lugge for
about one year. The quartet's
original plans for the theatre
included a restaurant, which
opened about five months ago.
According to employee Lynn
Glover, who has worked there
for two-and-a-half years, even
before it was the New Varsity,
"We brought back some of the
movies that didn't get enough
exposure." The New Varsity
shows a wide variety of movies
— foreien films, classics."cult"

films. There is a very good
chance that something you've
missed will turn up at the New
Varsity — anything from Day
For Night to Cabaret to Fellini's
Roma.
