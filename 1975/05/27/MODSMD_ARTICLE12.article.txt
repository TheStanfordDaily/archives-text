Who is responsible for that hideous refugee
from the junkyard that is sitting in the
middle of the courtyard of the new law
School? -B.M.
Your characterization of the sculpture
was not appreciated either by Law Professor
John Merryman, in charge of selecting art
for the new law school, or by Albert Elsen,
professor of art history.
"The sculpture is a big, gorgeous thing,"
said Merryman. "People who react
negatively to it . . . well, they'll grow up."
Elsen described it as "a work that has
scale and strength and interest and animates
the space around it."
The creator of the sculpture, entitled
"Four Square (Walkthrough)," is Barbara
Hepworth, a British artist whom Merryman
calls "one of the greatest living sculptors."
It belongs to the Norton Simon foundation,
which has loaned it to the law school for
two years.
The piece is "an excellent example of the
art of simple forms," Elsen said, adding that
"it makes a nice contrast with the law."

If it is illegal to pick California poppies,
how come it's all right to mow them down?
The other day a University bulldozer came
over to the east side Flo Mo parking lot and
bulldozed down a whole section of grass
with poppies and other flowers in it. The
area looks awful now and the flowers are
dead. The obvious question is "why?" /4s
far as I can tell, there was no apparent
purpose, and the action seems to have been
of questionable legality. Why would the
University waste personpower and money
to do such a wasteful act? â€”P.R.
Grounds Manager Andy Anderson said
that the poppies were mowed down for
weed abatement and fire protection. The
University regularly mows areas near
buildings to prevent the grass from getting
high and dry, he said, and "if there are
poppies in those areas that we must mow,
they get mowed down with it."
Anderson added that a lot of dorm
residents complain about the allergic
reaction they have to the poppies.
