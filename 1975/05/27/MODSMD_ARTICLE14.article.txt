# Hilton Claims Russians Attacking Moynihan
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
"We are talking about matters
of life and death. You would
think that these so-called
scholars would be interested . ..
but most of them just don't
listen."
So stated Spanish and
Portugese Prof. Ronald Hilton
yesterday in a speech in the
Meyer Forum Room. Hilton
primarily focused on the lack of
attention the scholars, media,
and University administrators
pay to international affairs.
An example of this
inadequate attention, Hilton
noted, is the campaign the
Russians are waging to discredit
newly-appointed U.S.
Ambassador to the United
Nations (and Stanford
commencement speaker) Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
"We should avoid playing the
Soviet game in this," he said.

"They intend to discredit him
with every possible means."
The Russians only started to
attack Moynihan after one of his
articles was published in
Commentary calling for the
United States to "talk back to
the United Nations." According
to Hilton, Moynihan indicated in
the article that the United States
should not hesitate to state its
views on controversial subjects.
"As soon as that article
appeared, the lights began to go
on all over the place," he said.
The Soviets immediately
contacted their sympathizers at
Harvard to begin a campaign to
villify Moynihan, said Hilton.
Hilton also sharply criticized
American scholars: "I hold that
the universities' faculty are very
largely responsible for tjie plight
of the United States in the
world."
Hilton said that many
scholars lack adequate
information on important
international events
"information vital for the safety
and survival of our country."
These so-called specialists in
international relations
oftentimes are "abominably
ignorant" on such affairs, he
said.
Hilton and others formed the
California Institute of
International Studies to review
political activities in the
Latin-American countries and

the entire "global picture," said
Hilton. The institute decided
that the most "critical issue in
the world today is what the
Soviet Union is up to and the
relationship between the United
States and the Soviet Union,"
Hilton said.
Hilton had equally unkind
words for the press.
The coverage given to events
in Third World countries and in
communist countries such as
Russia and the Eastern bloc
often are "incomplete," he said.
Governments of foreign
countries frequently pay
reporters not to cover certain
stories, Hilton said. This action,
along with the policy of ejecting
anyone reporting unfavorable
information, leads to incomplete
news coverage, he said.
As an example of the
irresponsibility of some
newspapers, Hilton said that
while traveling in Latin America
in the early 19605, he had
accidentally learned of the
training of troops to invade
Cuba troops for the ill-fated
Bay of Pigs operation.
He said that when he
returned to the United States he
"was horrified to find that no
one believed me and no one knew
anything about it. It was looked
upon as being a sort of wild
report." Information of this sort
could, with just a little diligence,
have been verified, said Hilton.
