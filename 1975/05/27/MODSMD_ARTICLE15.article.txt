## Take Two 'W.W.' Commits Suicide; 'Rancho Deluxe' Unfocused 
### 
I Rancho Deluxe, according
I to rustler Jack McKee, is just
| "south of Big Rock Candy
Mountain," and probably a
stone's throw away from the
Land of Oz.
| Rancho Deluxe, the movie,
I is unique if nothing else. It is a
I pleasurable satire on people
I and their foibles, and what
they do to alleviate their
boredom in life.
I Thinking back I realize
Deluxe has very little. What
| makes it entertaining is not its
| plot, but rather its characters,
all of whom are trapped in
some way and are forced by
I their circumstances to inject
some excitement into their
I lives.
Jeff Bridges (inexplicably
| Oscar-nominated for
I Thunderbolt and Lightfoot)
land Sam Waterston
((inexplicably ignored for The
Great Gatsby) played two bored
men who take up rustling for
1 the novelty of it.
"What are we going to do
I with the money?" asks Indian
Cecil Colson (Waterston).
"Hell," answers Jack McKee
(Bridges), "this is just to keep

from falling asleep."
They keep from falling
; asleep in royal fashion —
fholding prize-winning bulls for
ransom in motel rooms and
| entertaining two liberated
| country girls (Maggie Wellman
sand Patty D'Arbanville, whose
1 outlet for frustration is sex,
sex, and more sex) with catered
I orgies yet.
They concentrate on the
cattle of rancher John Brown
(Clifton James, the blustery
J.W. Pepper of Live and Let
Die and The Man With The
| Golden Gun), who is so equally
1 bored that he declares war on
| the rustlers and begins devoting
I his time and money to their
1 capture.
His wife Cora (Elizabeth
Ashley) is equally bored with
Montana, demonstratec
beautifully when she asks,
"John, are you ever sorry we
sold the beauty salons?
Sometimes I miss
Schenectady." And their;,
ranch hands Curt and Burt
(Harry Dean Stanton and
Richard Bright) join Jack and
Cecil for their excitement.
The satire is embodied in
each new situation, as well as

in Henry Beige (Slim Pickens)
— the range detective Brown
hires to capture the rustlers;
and his so-called niece
(Charlene Dallas).
What Rancho Deluxe lacks
is focus as it gives us a
kaleidoscope view of these
characters and their lives. The
subtle satire is deftly handled
by director Frank Perry (Play
It ,4s It Lays, Man On A
Swing).

Oddly enough, its
screenplay by Thomas
McGuane makes it funny and
appealing, and the characters
are well delineated by the time
everything culminates in justice
for all, and Jack and Cecil get
the Rancho Deluxe they've
always wanted.

You know you've really
made it as a superstar when the
parts you play are tailored for
you. Burt Reynolds's character

W.W. Bright in WW. and the
Dixie Dance Kings had to be
written for him. Both W.W.
(which stands for nothing in
particular) and Burt are
curiously attractive, secure and
in control of every situation.
W.W.'s ambition in life is to
avoid having an ambition in
life. He is content to rob the
gas stations of the Southland
Oil System in the halcyon days
of 1957 — an overgrown Tom
Sawyer, footloose and
fancy-free behind the wheel of
his custom 1955 Oldsmobile.
W.W. is as carefree as we
would all like to be, living as he
wants and doing what he wants
zestfully, with an explosive
laugh more infectious than
gonorrhea. Even his vanity
doesn't stop us from liking
him.
W. W. is a satire as well as a
comedy, parodying everything
it admires — from Reynolds to
country-western music to
mm - mat ■ mmojitoo.wmicj

taking potshots at the
conglomerate Southerland Oil
System.
Put on W.W.'s trail by SOS
president Elton 0. Bird (you
can't take a name like that
seriously) is Deacon John
Wesley Core (Art Carney is
totally wasted in the role), the
lawman who believes his soul
will go to hell if he works on
Sunday. Whenever he intones,
thunder rumbles in the

background.
On the run from another
inquisitive policeman, W.W.
meets Dixie (singer Conny Van
Dyke) and the Dance Kings §
(singer Jerry Reed, et al.), a
country-western group, and |
appoints himself their |
manager, using his
million-dollar smile to gain
their trust and send them on I
the road to fame (which
happens to lead past a few SOS |
gas stations).
With the help of
country-western star Bull
Jenkins (Ned Beatty), head of
the Birmingham Brahmas, I
W.W. steers the Dance Kings to J
the stage of the Grand Ole 112
Opry. Deacon Gore is hot on
his tail, though, and is about to
arrest him when midnight 112
Saturday night strikes, and he 1
is forced to let W.W. go free,
confident he will capture him
again.
W.W. drives off laughing
gaily, telling us, "You haven't
heard the last of W.W.!," .
leaving the audience
dumbfounded and totally §
unsatisfied with such a short -
movie.
The elements of a successful 1
motion picture abound. There |
is the charismatic W.W., the |
success story of the deserving
singing group, the love story |
between W.W. and Dixie, and
the evil corporation we're all §
rooting against.
So where does IV. W. fail? By
copping out — not fulfilling its •
initial promise of fun and
parody.
Everything was so good for
a while, and then it began to
lag. When W.W., itching to be
on his way to avoid the
Deacon, says, "Life's getting a
little dull for me," it's getting
just as dull for us.
A slowdown is acceptable if §
a climax is being built. But it is |
as if director John Avildsen
didn't know how to end the
movie. Granted, ending a
movie about a loveable
criminal is difficult, but instead
of exploring more deeply
W.W.'s love affair or the Dance
Kings' rise to success, the |
movie concludes, very
conveniently leaving the door
open for a sequel, when it
easily could have gone on for I
another hour.
I felt cheated that this
fraction of a story was pawned |
off as an entire movie.
It is unfortunate that a
movie with such a superb and
witty beginning should decline
into quicksand. I would have
expected more from Avildsen |
and executive producer Steve |
Shagan, who worked together |
on the excellent Save The Tiger.
I cannot recommend W.W. |
because it did not have the
courage to go on — it
committed suicide before it |
had a chance to fully live out |
its promise.

The satire is embodied in
each new situation, as well as

in Henry Beige (Slim Pickens)
— the range detective Brown
hires to capture the rustlers;
and his so-called niece

What Rancho Deluxe lacks
is focus as it gives us a
kaleidoscope view of these
characters and their lives. The
subtle satire is deftly handled
by director Frank Perry (Play

Oddly enough, its
screenplay by Thomas

are well delineated by the time
everything culminates in justice
for all, and Jack and Cecil get
the Rancho Deluxe they've
always wanted.

You know you've really
made it as a superstar when the
parts you play are tailored for
you. Burt Reynolds's character

W.W. Bright in WW. and the
Dixie Dance Kings had to be
written for him. Both W.W.
(which stands for nothing in
particular) and Burt are
curiously attractive, secure and
in control of every situation.
W.W.'s ambition in life is to
avoid having an ambition in
life. He is content to rob the
gas stations of the Southland
Oil System in the halcyon days
of 1957 — an overgrown Tom
Sawyer, footloose and
fancy-free behind the wheel of
his custom 1955 Oldsmobile.
W.W. is as carefree as we
would all like to be, living as he
wants and doing what he wants
zestfully, with an explosive
laugh more infectious than
gonorrhea. Even his vanity
doesn't stop us from liking
him.
W. W. is a satire as well as a
comedy, parodying everything
it admires — from Reynolds to
country-western music to
mm - mat ■ mmojitoo.wmicj

taking potshots at the
conglomerate Southerland Oil
System.
Put on W.W.'s trail by SOS
president Elton 0. Bird (you
can't take a name like that
seriously) is Deacon John
Wesley Core (Art Carney is
totally wasted in the role), the
lawman who believes his soul
will go to hell if he works on
Sunday. Whenever he intones,
thunder rumbles in the

background.
On the run from another
inquisitive policeman, W.W.
meets Dixie (singer Conny Van
Dyke) and the Dance Kings §
(singer Jerry Reed, et al.), a
country-western group, and |
appoints himself their |
manager, using his
million-dollar smile to gain
their trust and send them on I
the road to fame (which
happens to lead past a few SOS |
gas stations).
With the help of
country-western star Bull
Jenkins (Ned Beatty), head of
the Birmingham Brahmas, I
W.W. steers the Dance Kings to J
the stage of the Grand Ole 112
Opry. Deacon Gore is hot on
his tail, though, and is about to
arrest him when midnight 112
Saturday night strikes, and he 1
is forced to let W.W. go free,
confident he will capture him
again.
W.W. drives off laughing
gaily, telling us, "You haven't
heard the last of W.W.!," .
leaving the audience
dumbfounded and totally §
unsatisfied with such a short -
movie.
The elements of a successful 1
motion picture abound. There |
is the charismatic W.W., the |
success story of the deserving
singing group, the love story |
between W.W. and Dixie, and
the evil corporation we're all §
rooting against.
So where does IV. W. fail? By
copping out — not fulfilling its •
initial promise of fun and
parody.
Everything was so good for
a while, and then it began to
lag. When W.W., itching to be
on his way to avoid the
Deacon, says, "Life's getting a
little dull for me," it's getting
just as dull for us.
A slowdown is acceptable if §
a climax is being built. But it is |
as if director John Avildsen
didn't know how to end the
movie. Granted, ending a
movie about a loveable
criminal is difficult, but instead
of exploring more deeply
W.W.'s love affair or the Dance
Kings' rise to success, the |
movie concludes, very
conveniently leaving the door
open for a sequel, when it
easily could have gone on for I
another hour.
I felt cheated that this
fraction of a story was pawned |
off as an entire movie.
It is unfortunate that a
movie with such a superb and
witty beginning should decline
into quicksand. I would have
expected more from Avildsen |
and executive producer Steve |
Shagan, who worked together |
on the excellent Save The Tiger.
I cannot recommend W.W. |
because it did not have the
courage to go on — it
committed suicide before it |
had a chance to fully live out |
its promise.

just as dull for us.
A slowdown is acceptable if §
a climax is being built. But it is |
as if director John Avildsen
didn't know how to end the
movie. Granted, ending a
movie about a loveable
criminal is difficult, but instead
of exploring more deeply
W.W.'s love affair or the Dance
Kings' rise to success, the |
movie concludes, very
conveniently leaving the door
open for a sequel, when it
easily could have gone on for I
another hour.
I felt cheated that this
fraction of a story was pawned |
off as an entire movie.
It is unfortunate that a
movie with such a superb and
witty beginning should decline
into quicksand. I would have
expected more from Avildsen |
and executive producer Steve |
Shagan, who worked together |
on the excellent Save The Tiger.
I cannot recommend W.W. |
because it did not have the
courage to go on — it
committed suicide before it |
had a chance to fully live out |
its promise.

BAD BOREDOM—Iack McKee (Jeff Bridges) is a modern day
cattle rustler who holds bulls for ransom in order to help
alleviate his boredom in "Rancho Deluxe," a United Artists
release.
I Rancho Deluxe, according
I to rustler Jack McKee, is just
| "south of Big Rock Candy
Mountain," and probably a
stone's throw away from the
Land of Oz.
| Rancho Deluxe, the movie,
I is unique if nothing else. It is a
I pleasurable satire on people
I and their foibles, and what
they do to alleviate their
boredom in life.
I Thinking back I realize
Deluxe has very little. What
| makes it entertaining is not its
| plot, but rather its characters,
all of whom are trapped in
some way and are forced by
I their circumstances to inject
some excitement into their
I lives.
Jeff Bridges (inexplicably
| Oscar-nominated for
I Thunderbolt and Lightfoot)
land Sam Waterston
((inexplicably ignored for The
Great Gatsby) played two bored
men who take up rustling for
1 the novelty of it.
"What are we going to do
I with the money?" asks Indian
Cecil Colson (Waterston).
"Hell," answers Jack McKee
(Bridges), "this is just to keep

from falling asleep."
They keep from falling
; asleep in royal fashion —
fholding prize-winning bulls for
ransom in motel rooms and
| entertaining two liberated
| country girls (Maggie Wellman
sand Patty D'Arbanville, whose
1 outlet for frustration is sex,
sex, and more sex) with catered
I orgies yet.
They concentrate on the
cattle of rancher John Brown
(Clifton James, the blustery
J.W. Pepper of Live and Let
Die and The Man With The
| Golden Gun), who is so equally
1 bored that he declares war on
| the rustlers and begins devoting
I his time and money to their
1 capture.
His wife Cora (Elizabeth
Ashley) is equally bored with
Montana, demonstratec
beautifully when she asks,
"John, are you ever sorry we
sold the beauty salons?
Sometimes I miss
Schenectady." And their;,
ranch hands Curt and Burt
(Harry Dean Stanton and
Richard Bright) join Jack and
Cecil for their excitement.
The satire is embodied in
each new situation, as well as

in Henry Beige (Slim Pickens)
— the range detective Brown
hires to capture the rustlers;
and his so-called niece
(Charlene Dallas).
What Rancho Deluxe lacks
is focus as it gives us a
kaleidoscope view of these
characters and their lives. The
subtle satire is deftly handled
by director Frank Perry (Play
It ,4s It Lays, Man On A
Swing).

Oddly enough, its
screenplay by Thomas
McGuane makes it funny and
appealing, and the characters
are well delineated by the time
everything culminates in justice
for all, and Jack and Cecil get
the Rancho Deluxe they've
always wanted.

You know you've really
made it as a superstar when the
parts you play are tailored for
you. Burt Reynolds's character

W.W. Bright in WW. and the
Dixie Dance Kings had to be
written for him. Both W.W.
(which stands for nothing in
particular) and Burt are
curiously attractive, secure and
in control of every situation.
W.W.'s ambition in life is to
avoid having an ambition in
life. He is content to rob the
gas stations of the Southland
Oil System in the halcyon days
of 1957 — an overgrown Tom
Sawyer, footloose and
fancy-free behind the wheel of
his custom 1955 Oldsmobile.
W.W. is as carefree as we
would all like to be, living as he
wants and doing what he wants
zestfully, with an explosive
laugh more infectious than
gonorrhea. Even his vanity
doesn't stop us from liking
him.

the evil corporation we're all §
rooting against.
So where does IV. W. fail? By
copping out — not fulfilling its •
initial promise of fun and
parody.
Everything was so good for
a while, and then it began to
lag. When W.W., itching to be
on his way to avoid the
Deacon, says, "Life's getting a
little dull for me," it's getting
just as dull for us.
A slowdown is acceptable if §
a climax is being built. But it is |
as if director John Avildsen
didn't know how to end the
movie. Granted, ending a
movie about a loveable
criminal is difficult, but instead
of exploring more deeply
W.W.'s love affair or the Dance
Kings' rise to success, the |
movie concludes, very
conveniently leaving the door
open for a sequel, when it
easily could have gone on for I
another hour.
I felt cheated that this
fraction of a story was pawned |
off as an entire movie.
It is unfortunate that a
movie with such a superb and
witty beginning should decline
into quicksand. I would have
expected more from Avildsen |
and executive producer Steve |
Shagan, who worked together |
on the excellent Save The Tiger.
I cannot recommend W.W. |
because it did not have the
courage to go on — it
committed suicide before it |
had a chance to fully live out |
its promise.

BAD BOREDOM—Iack McKee (Jeff Bridges) is a modern day
cattle rustler who holds bulls for ransom in order to help
alleviate his boredom in "Rancho Deluxe," a United Artists
release.
I Rancho Deluxe, according
I to rustler Jack McKee, is just
| "south of Big Rock Candy
Mountain," and probably a
stone's throw away from the
Land of Oz.
| Rancho Deluxe, the movie,
I is unique if nothing else. It is a
I pleasurable satire on people
I and their foibles, and what
they do to alleviate their
boredom in life.
I Thinking back I realize
Deluxe has very little. What
| makes it entertaining is not its
| plot, but rather its characters,
all of whom are trapped in
some way and are forced by
I their circumstances to inject
some excitement into their
I lives.
Jeff Bridges (inexplicably
| Oscar-nominated for
I Thunderbolt and Lightfoot)
land Sam Waterston
((inexplicably ignored for The
Great Gatsby) played two bored
men who take up rustling for
1 the novelty of it.
"What are we going to do
I with the money?" asks Indian
Cecil Colson (Waterston).
"Hell," answers Jack McKee
(Bridges), "this is just to keep

from falling asleep."
They keep from falling
; asleep in royal fashion —
fholding prize-winning bulls for
ransom in motel rooms and
| entertaining two liberated
| country girls (Maggie Wellman
sand Patty D'Arbanville, whose
1 outlet for frustration is sex,
sex, and more sex) with catered
I orgies yet.
They concentrate on the
cattle of rancher John Brown
(Clifton James, the blustery
J.W. Pepper of Live and Let
Die and The Man With The
| Golden Gun), who is so equally
1 bored that he declares war on
| the rustlers and begins devoting
I his time and money to their
1 capture.
His wife Cora (Elizabeth
Ashley) is equally bored with
Montana, demonstratec
beautifully when she asks,
"John, are you ever sorry we
sold the beauty salons?
Sometimes I miss
Schenectady." And their;,
ranch hands Curt and Burt
(Harry Dean Stanton and
Richard Bright) join Jack and
Cecil for their excitement.
The satire is embodied in
each new situation, as well as

in Henry Beige (Slim Pickens)
— the range detective Brown
hires to capture the rustlers;
and his so-called niece
(Charlene Dallas).
What Rancho Deluxe lacks
is focus as it gives us a
kaleidoscope view of these
characters and their lives. The
subtle satire is deftly handled
by director Frank Perry (Play
It ,4s It Lays, Man On A
Swing).

Oddly enough, its
screenplay by Thomas
McGuane makes it funny and
appealing, and the characters
are well delineated by the time
everything culminates in justice
for all, and Jack and Cecil get
the Rancho Deluxe they've
always wanted.

You know you've really
made it as a superstar when the
parts you play are tailored for
you. Burt Reynolds's character

W.W. Bright in WW. and the
Dixie Dance Kings had to be
written for him. Both W.W.
(which stands for nothing in
particular) and Burt are
curiously attractive, secure and
in control of every situation.
W.W.'s ambition in life is to
avoid having an ambition in
life. He is content to rob the
gas stations of the Southland
Oil System in the halcyon days
of 1957 — an overgrown Tom
Sawyer, footloose and
fancy-free behind the wheel of
his custom 1955 Oldsmobile.
W.W. is as carefree as we
would all like to be, living as he
wants and doing what he wants
zestfully, with an explosive
laugh more infectious than
gonorrhea. Even his vanity
doesn't stop us from liking
him.
W. W. is a satire as well as a
comedy, parodying everything
it admires — from Reynolds to
country-western music to
mm - mat ■ mmojitoo.wmicj

taking potshots at the
conglomerate Southerland Oil
System.
Put on W.W.'s trail by SOS
president Elton 0. Bird (you
can't take a name like that
seriously) is Deacon John
Wesley Core (Art Carney is
totally wasted in the role), the
lawman who believes his soul
will go to hell if he works on
Sunday. Whenever he intones,
thunder rumbles in the

background.
On the run from another
inquisitive policeman, W.W.
meets Dixie (singer Conny Van
Dyke) and the Dance Kings §
(singer Jerry Reed, et al.), a
country-western group, and |
appoints himself their |
manager, using his
million-dollar smile to gain
their trust and send them on I
the road to fame (which
happens to lead past a few SOS |
gas stations).
With the help of
country-western star Bull
Jenkins (Ned Beatty), head of
the Birmingham Brahmas, I
W.W. steers the Dance Kings to J
the stage of the Grand Ole 112
Opry. Deacon Gore is hot on
his tail, though, and is about to
arrest him when midnight 112
Saturday night strikes, and he 1
is forced to let W.W. go free,
confident he will capture him
again.
W.W. drives off laughing
gaily, telling us, "You haven't
heard the last of W.W.!," .
leaving the audience
dumbfounded and totally §
unsatisfied with such a short -
movie.
The elements of a successful 1
motion picture abound. There |
is the charismatic W.W., the |
success story of the deserving
singing group, the love story |
between W.W. and Dixie, and
the evil corporation we're all §
rooting against.
So where does IV. W. fail? By
copping out — not fulfilling its •
initial promise of fun and
parody.
Everything was so good for
a while, and then it began to
lag. When W.W., itching to be
on his way to avoid the
Deacon, says, "Life's getting a
little dull for me," it's getting
just as dull for us.
A slowdown is acceptable if §
a climax is being built. But it is |
as if director John Avildsen

movie. Granted, ending a
movie about a loveable
criminal is difficult, but instead
of exploring more deeply
W.W.'s love affair or the Dance
Kings' rise to success, the |
movie concludes, very
conveniently leaving the door
open for a sequel, when it
easily could have gone on for I
another hour.
