# Once Around The Turntable
## Daring Originality In ABC's 'Lou Reed Live' 
### 
Lou Reed
Lou Reed Live
RCA APLI-0959
The world of Lou Reed is
well known by now: it's a world
of transvestites and pushers,
junkies and whores. Seldom has
a pop musician attempted to
describe such bitterness and
desperation as that which Reed
perceives.
But Lou Reed is a poet, and
his songs never seem overstated.
He sings about the pleasures that
only the inhabitants of the
"Wild Side" can experience, as
well as the miseries. And he has
never sung better than on his
new live album.
Like his superb Rock and
Roll Animal set, Lou Reed Live
was recorded at the Academy of
Music, New York's seedy rock
palace that features such regular
visitors as the Blue Oyster Cult
and the New York Dolls. Reed
and his five-man band are more
than just darlings of the glitter
set, though: they are among the
finest rock groups in the world.
The most outstanding feature
of the record is the
expressiveness of Reed's singing,
the most daringly original in
popular music. Not content to
merely sing the melody, Reed
gets inside his characters and
attempts to show the world as
they would see it.
Reed's voice reflects many
moods: from the desperate
anxiety of a junkie waiting for
his supplier ("He's never early,
he's always late/ One thing you
learn is that you've always got to
wait") to the sneering contempt
of a man who sings:
Vicious
You think that I'm a gay blade

Well why don't you just su>allou>
a razor blade
Oh honey, you're so vicious.
Also here is a tremendous
version of "Walk on the Wild
Side," Reed's famous slice of
New York underground life,
featuring Holly ("plucked her
eyebrows along the way/ Shaved
her legs and then he was a she);
Jackie, who "thought she was
James Dean for a day"; the
Sugar Plum Fairy and several
equally bizarre characters. I
Reed, whose first solo album
bore the name Transformer,
describes a range of love
relationships not often
encountered in rock songs.
There is the embittered person
who sings in "Oh Jim": "You
said that you loved us/ But you
only made love to one of us."
The backup musicians could
not play better. Reed's songs
rock very hard, and the band,
especially guitarists Steve Hunter
and Dick Wagner, lay down a
tight, precise and loud
background reminiscent of some
of the Who's live recordings.
Lou Reed has been making
great music for almost 10 years,
sincy he was a member of the
famous Velvet Underground.
One of the best indications of
his ability is that his songs still
sound bold and fresh, and the
world he describes is still as
fascinating and mysterious as it
seemed when he first wrote
about it.

Lou Reed
Lou Reed Live
RCA APLI-0959
The world of Lou Reed is
well known by now: it's a world
of transvestites and pushers,
junkies and whores. Seldom has
a pop musician attempted to
describe such bitterness and
desperation as that which Reed
perceives.
But Lou Reed is a poet, and
his songs never seem overstated.
He sings about the pleasures that
only the inhabitants of the
"Wild Side" can experience, as
well as the miseries. And he has
never sung better than on his
new live album.
Like his superb Rock and
Roll Animal set, Lou Reed Live
was recorded at the Academy of
Music, New York's seedy rock
palace that features such regular
visitors as the Blue Oyster Cult
and the New York Dolls. Reed
and his five-man band are more
than just darlings of the glitter
set, though: they are among the
finest rock groups in the world.
The most outstanding feature
of the record is the
expressiveness of Reed's singing,
the most daringly original in
popular music. Not content to
merely sing the melody, Reed
gets inside his characters and
attempts to show the world as
they would see it.
Reed's voice reflects many
moods: from the desperate
anxiety of a junkie waiting for
his supplier ("He's never early,
he's always late/ One thing you
learn is that you've always got to
wait") to the sneering contempt
of a man who sings:
Vicious
You think that I'm a gay blade

Well why don't you just su>allou>
