# Graham's Day On The Green
## Chicago, Beach Boys -- A Real Hot One 
### KEVIN SMITH 
OAKLAND — Take a baseball
stadium, a hot, sunny day, more
than 60,000 people and two
groups named Chicago and the
Beach Boys, and what have you
got?
One intoxicatingly pleasant
Saturday in the Park.
Bill Graham's ambitious "Day
on the Green" at the Oakland
Coliseum Saturday couldn't be
called anything but a smashing
success.
The largely youthful crowd
began filing into the stadium at
6:30 a.m. when the gates were
opened, and by 10 a.m. the park
was almost completely filled.
Several hundred people camped
outside the gates overnight so
they could be close to the
action.
The morning went by lazily
as the extraordinarily
well-behaved crowd lounged
around only half-listening to the
two warmup bands that came on
at 10.
Time passed awfully slowly,
but no one seemed to mind very
much.
By the time the Beach Boys
appeared at 1 p.m., however,
people were getting itchy.
Electricity
But as soon as the group
launched the "Sloop John B,"
the electricity began to flow.
Gettin' Around
In their hour-long set, the
Beach Boys moved

back-and-forth from the slow
"Surfer Girl" and "In My
Room" to the more lively
"Catch A Wave" and"I Get
Around," which got a huge
response from the audience.
An encore of "Barbara Ann"
and "Surfin' U.5.A.," and a
promise to return later in the
afternoon set the stage for
Chicago.
After a slow start which left
the crowd a little let down, the
Great Lake Boys hit their stride.
"Just You 'N' Me" and
"Beginnings" put the audience
smiling, and the appropriately
nostalgic "Old Days" coupled
with "(I've Been) Searchin' So
Long" pleased just about
everyone.
Nevertheless, Chicago lacked
a certain excitement and didn't
seem to turn on the crowd as
much as the Beach Boys did,
even though Chicago was
performing better musically.
That difference in enthusiasm
disappeared completely,
however, when both groups
came on together for a stunning
hour-long encore.
The finale was an incredible,
climactic thrill beginning with
"California Girls," moving to
"Saturday in the Park" (which,
mysteriously was sung by Carl
Wilson of the Beach Boys),
exploding into "Fun, Fun, Fun"
and culminating with "Feelin'
Stronger Every Day."
And another two-group
encore of the Rolling Stones'
"Jumpin' Jack Flash" somehow
seemed a perfect ending for a
crazed bunch of Stanford
students dancing frenzily in a big
circle down by the stage.

the electricity began to flow.
Gettin' Around
In their hour-long set, the
Beach Boys moved

back-and-forth from the slow
"Surfer Girl" and "In My
Room" to the more lively
"Catch A Wave" and"I Get
Around," which got a huge
response from the audience.
An encore of "Barbara Ann"
and "Surfin' U.5.A.," and a
promise to return later in the
afternoon set the stage for
Chicago.
After a slow start which left
the crowd a little let down, the
Great Lake Boys hit their stride.
"Just You 'N' Me" and
"Beginnings" put the audience
smiling, and the appropriately
nostalgic "Old Days" coupled
with "(I've Been) Searchin' So
Long" pleased just about
everyone.
Nevertheless, Chicago lacked
a certain excitement and didn't
seem to turn on the crowd as
much as the Beach Boys did,
even though Chicago was
performing better musically.
That difference in enthusiasm
disappeared completely,
however, when both groups
came on together for a stunning
hour-long encore.
The finale was an incredible,
climactic thrill beginning with
"California Girls," moving to
"Saturday in the Park" (which,
mysteriously was sung by Carl
Wilson of the Beach Boys),
exploding into "Fun, Fun, Fun"
and culminating with "Feelin'
Stronger Every Day."
And another two-group
encore of the Rolling Stones'
"Jumpin' Jack Flash" somehow
seemed a perfect ending for a
crazed bunch of Stanford
students dancing frenzily in a big
circle down by the stage.
OAKLAND — Take a baseball
stadium, a hot, sunny day, more
than 60,000 people and two
groups named Chicago and the
Beach Boys, and what have you
got?
One intoxicatingly pleasant
Saturday in the Park.
Bill Graham's ambitious "Day
on the Green" at the Oakland
Coliseum Saturday couldn't be
called anything but a smashing
success.
The largely youthful crowd
began filing into the stadium at
6:30 a.m. when the gates were
opened, and by 10 a.m. the park
was almost completely filled.
Several hundred people camped
outside the gates overnight so
they could be close to the
action.
The morning went by lazily
as the extraordinarily
well-behaved crowd lounged
around only half-listening to the
two warmup bands that came on
at 10.
Time passed awfully slowly,
but no one seemed to mind very
much.
By the time the Beach Boys
appeared at 1 p.m., however,
people were getting itchy.
Electricity
But as soon as the group
launched the "Sloop John B,"
the electricity began to flow.
