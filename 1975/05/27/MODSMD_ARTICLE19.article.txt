Farm Bill Passes In State Senate
SACRAMENTO — The State Senate approved Gov.
Edmund Brown's Jr.'s secret ballot farm labor bill
yesterday.
The 31-7 vote in a special holiday floor session sent the
landmark legislation to the assembly, where backers
predicted quick approval later this week.
Brown hopes to sign the bill by Friday, soon enough to
allow a new state agency to supervise the first secret
elections on California farms in September.
By the provisions of the bill, current contracts would
be voided if the union holding the contract is challenged
and loses a secret ballot election.
The secondary boycotts used by Chavez would be
permitted, but only by a union which had won
recognition by an election.
Harvest time strikes would be allowed. But
jurisdictional strikes between rival unions would be
outlawed.
In other action relating to farmworkers, nine persons,
described as United Farmworkers Union organizers or
sympathizers, were hospitalized today in McAllen, Texas,
after a melon farmer opened fire with an automatic
shotgun south of McAllen, police said.
Military Premier Of Lebanon Resigns
BEIRUT — Volleys of gunfire greeted the resignation
yesterday of Lebanon's first military premier, Brig. Gen.
Noureddin Rifais, sending residents fleeing for cover.
Rifai quit after three days in office because mounting
opposition from left-wing political groups and Moslem
factions failed to halt a week of bloody civil strife in this
small country. So far more than 100 have been killed and
300 wounded.
President Suleiman Franjieh accepted Rifai's
resignation but asked him to stay on in a caretaker
capacity. It was not immediately clear whether the rest of
the cabinet would resign too.
. In the midst of the chaos, Israeli troops staged another
cross-border raid, their second in two days against the
southern Lebanese village of Aita al-Chaab.
Ford To Speak On Energy Tonight
WASHINGTON — Amid indications he will impose a
second $l-a-barrel tax on imported oil, President Ford
said yesterday he will announce decisions about his energy
program this evening.
His statement will be made in a nationwide broadcast
from the presidential Oval Office at 5:30 p.m. PDT.
Ford originally planned to add a dollar a barrel to the
tariff for three successive months, starting in February.
But he put off the two final dollars when Congress started

to act on energy legislation.
Frank Zarb, the federal energy administrator, has said
that another dollar a barrel increase in the oil tariff would
add one to one-and-one-half cents to the cost of a gallon
of gasoline.
U.S. Embassy In Laos Still Occupied
VIENTIANE, Laos — The U.S. Embassy and the
communist -dominated Pathet Lao stepped up their verbal
tug of war yesterday over the student occupation of the
U.S,. aid compound where three Americans have been
locked in for six days.
U.S. Embassy personnel also accelerated the burning of
documents and the embassy's marine guards moved their
pistols and riot gas supplies to safer upstairs storage areas
as anti-American feeling mounted in Vientiane.
Kissinger To Attend Energy Meetings
PARIS — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger arrived
last night for two days of meetings on energy and
economic problems before going to Brussels to join
President Ford at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
summit meeting. Kissinger was accompanied by Treasury
Secretary William Simon and Frank Zarb, federal energy
administrator.
In an airport statement, Kissinger said he and Simon
would be attending meetings of the International Energy
Agency, an oil-sharing group set up by industrialized
nations after the 1973 oil embargo, and the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In a major shift in U.S. economic policy, Kissinger
apparently is ready to support the price of raw materials
to those of industrial products.
It was understood that Kissinger and Simon also intend
to try to revive a preliminary conference of oil-producing
and oil-consuming countries.
Military Takeover In Portugal Urged
LISBON, Portugal — The chief of the army's
peacekeeping forces urged yesterday a full military
takeover of political life in Portugal.
Brig. Gen. Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho declared this was
the only way to overcome disputes between the parties
which he held responsible for an acute government crisis.
The military chief's war declaration on political parties
carne as Common Market foreign ministers meeting in
Dublin authorized a comprehensive aid program to stave
off economic collapse in Portugal — on condition that this
country's institutions are democratic.
Korean Says U.S. Should Remain
SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Dae-jung, the outspoken
critic of the South Korean government and 1971
presidential candidate now under renewed surveillance in
Seoul, said Secretary of State Henry Kissinger should
reverse his policy of putting security first and democracy
second in Korea.
Kim said the 38,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea
should remain here because their presence would induce
North Korea's Chinese and Soviet backers to walk warily
as well as give communist leader Kim 11-sung pause.

night and moming but sunny inland areas through
Wednesday. Lows tonight in the upper 40s to mid 50s.

Ford To Speak On Energy Tonight
WASHINGTON — Amid indications he will impose a
second $l-a-barrel tax on imported oil, President Ford
said yesterday he will announce decisions about his energy
program this evening.
His statement will be made in a nationwide broadcast
from the presidential Oval Office at 5:30 p.m. PDT.
Ford originally planned to add a dollar a barrel to the
tariff for three successive months, starting in February.
But he put off the two final dollars when Congress started

to act on energy legislation.
Frank Zarb, the federal energy administrator, has said
that another dollar a barrel increase in the oil tariff would
add one to one-and-one-half cents to the cost of a gallon
of gasoline.
U.S. Embassy In Laos Still Occupied
VIENTIANE, Laos — The U.S. Embassy and the
communist -dominated Pathet Lao stepped up their verbal
tug of war yesterday over the student occupation of the
U.S,. aid compound where three Americans have been

Kissinger To Attend Energy Meetings
PARIS — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger arrived
last night for two days of meetings on energy and
economic problems before going to Brussels to join
President Ford at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
summit meeting. Kissinger was accompanied by Treasury

administrator.
In an airport statement, Kissinger said he and Simon
would be attending meetings of the International Energy
Agency, an oil-sharing group set up by industrialized
nations after the 1973 oil embargo, and the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.

to those of industrial products.
It was understood that Kissinger and Simon also intend
to try to revive a preliminary conference of oil-producing
and oil-consuming countries.
Military Takeover In Portugal Urged
LISBON, Portugal — The chief of the army's
peacekeeping forces urged yesterday a full military
takeover of political life in Portugal.
Brig. Gen. Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho declared this was
the only way to overcome disputes between the parties
which he held responsible for an acute government crisis.
The military chief's war declaration on political parties
carne as Common Market foreign ministers meeting in
Dublin authorized a comprehensive aid program to stave
off economic collapse in Portugal — on condition that this
country's institutions are democratic.
Korean Says U.S. Should Remain
SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Dae-jung, the outspoken
critic of the South Korean government and 1971
presidential candidate now under renewed surveillance in
Seoul, said Secretary of State Henry Kissinger should
reverse his policy of putting security first and democracy
second in Korea.
Kim said the 38,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea
should remain here because their presence would induce
North Korea's Chinese and Soviet backers to walk warily
as well as give communist leader Kim 11-sung pause.
Today's Weather
Fog and low clouds along the coast extending inland
night and moming but sunny inland areas through

Farm Bill Passes In State Senate
SACRAMENTO — The State Senate approved Gov.
Edmund Brown's Jr.'s secret ballot farm labor bill
yesterday.
The 31-7 vote in a special holiday floor session sent the
landmark legislation to the assembly, where backers
predicted quick approval later this week.
Brown hopes to sign the bill by Friday, soon enough to
allow a new state agency to supervise the first secret
elections on California farms in September.
By the provisions of the bill, current contracts would
be voided if the union holding the contract is challenged
and loses a secret ballot election.
The secondary boycotts used by Chavez would be
permitted, but only by a union which had won
recognition by an election.
Harvest time strikes would be allowed. But
jurisdictional strikes between rival unions would be
outlawed.
In other action relating to farmworkers, nine persons,
described as United Farmworkers Union organizers or
sympathizers, were hospitalized today in McAllen, Texas,
after a melon farmer opened fire with an automatic
shotgun south of McAllen, police said.
Military Premier Of Lebanon Resigns

small country. So far more than 100 have been killed and

last night for two days of meetings on energy and
economic problems before going to Brussels to join
President Ford at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
summit meeting. Kissinger was accompanied by Treasury
Secretary William Simon and Frank Zarb, federal energy
administrator.

would be attending meetings of the International Energy
Agency, an oil-sharing group set up by industrialized
nations after the 1973 oil embargo, and the Organization

to try to revive a preliminary conference of oil-producing
and oil-consuming countries.

SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Dae-jung, the outspoken
critic of the South Korean government and 1971

Seoul, said Secretary of State Henry Kissinger should
reverse his policy of putting security first and democracy
second in Korea.

Farm Bill Passes In State Senate
SACRAMENTO — The State Senate approved Gov.
Edmund Brown's Jr.'s secret ballot farm labor bill
yesterday.
The 31-7 vote in a special holiday floor session sent the
landmark legislation to the assembly, where backers
predicted quick approval later this week.
Brown hopes to sign the bill by Friday, soon enough to
allow a new state agency to supervise the first secret
elections on California farms in September.
By the provisions of the bill, current contracts would
be voided if the union holding the contract is challenged
and loses a secret ballot election.
The secondary boycotts used by Chavez would be
permitted, but only by a union which had won
recognition by an election.
Harvest time strikes would be allowed. But
jurisdictional strikes between rival unions would be
outlawed.
In other action relating to farmworkers, nine persons,
described as United Farmworkers Union organizers or
sympathizers, were hospitalized today in McAllen, Texas,
after a melon farmer opened fire with an automatic
shotgun south of McAllen, police said.
Military Premier Of Lebanon Resigns
BEIRUT — Volleys of gunfire greeted the resignation
yesterday of Lebanon's first military premier, Brig. Gen.
Noureddin Rifais, sending residents fleeing for cover.
Rifai quit after three days in office because mounting
opposition from left-wing political groups and Moslem
factions failed to halt a week of bloody civil strife in this
small country. So far more than 100 have been killed and
300 wounded.
President Suleiman Franjieh accepted Rifai's
resignation but asked him to stay on in a caretaker
capacity. It was not immediately clear whether the rest of
the cabinet would resign too.
. In the midst of the chaos, Israeli troops staged another
cross-border raid, their second in two days against the
southern Lebanese village of Aita al-Chaab.

WASHINGTON — Amid indications he will impose a
second $l-a-barrel tax on imported oil, President Ford
said yesterday he will announce decisions about his energy
program this evening.

from the presidential Oval Office at 5:30 p.m. PDT.
Ford originally planned to add a dollar a barrel to the
tariff for three successive months, starting in February.
But he put off the two final dollars when Congress started

to act on energy legislation.

that another dollar a barrel increase in the oil tariff would
add one to one-and-one-half cents to the cost of a gallon
of gasoline.
