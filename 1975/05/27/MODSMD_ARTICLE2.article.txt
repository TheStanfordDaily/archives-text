# Palo Alto May Cancel Drug Board
## 
### RIV WEBER 
Now that the city election has
passed, Palo Alto City Council
members are considering cancellation
of the Palo Alto Community Drug
Abuse Board (PACDAB) contract.
At a Policy and Procedures
Committee meeting last Tuesday
night, Councilman Stanley Norton
proposed that the city negotiate with
the PACDAB staff, "the Collective,"
and open the contract to bids from
other drug prevention groups.
Collective members attempted to
prove that they had more than
fulfilled their contractual agreement.
They offered statistics which indicated
that the Collective has surpassed its
goals for detoxification, education and
counseling.
Although Collective staff members
maintain that they had well used their
one percent of the city's budget, some
council members have argued that the
political activities of the staff are
grounds for the termination of the
Collective's contract.
One contestant for the contract is
Narcanon, sponsored by the Church of
Scientology in Palo Alto. Narcanon is
requesting $39,000 a year from the
city, based on a per-client basis.
Collective staff members argue that
Narcanon should not receive city
funds because it is religiously oriented.
Ray Hofstetter of the Collective
staff said PACDAB is requesting
$180,000 from the city this year,
which is a $50,000 increase over last
year's funding.
Three newly elected council
members who spoke harshly of
PACDAB will not take part in the
June 2 decision on extension of the
group's contract.
Lame duck Council wo man Enid
Pearson is willing to extend the
contract, she said, "if they're [the
Collective staffers] willing to curtail
their political activities.... They do a
good job."
Donna Taylor, a member of the
Collective staff, said, "We're open for
input and clarification from the
council of what we can and can't do."
But Pearson insisted that "The
Collective knows what we want."
Hofstetter drew a connection
between politics and drug abuse
prevention. "The CIA financed Air
American which flies heroin into the
country," he claimed, adding that the
Collective's political activities are
essential.
