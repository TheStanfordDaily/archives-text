## Why Leave 'The Farm'? 
### KATHY CUNNINGHAM First Of Four Parts 
The common image Stanford people
have of their place is that it's
somewhere near the best of all possible
worlds. It's free and easy, the sun
often shines, the people are hip,
intelligent and interesting, and you're
free to pluck any goodies you will
from this almost unlimited tree.
—A Stanford Education
It took Tom Earth man only one
quarter to decide Stanford was not the
Land of Good and Plenty. When
Christmas break came during his
freshman year, he packed his bags and
told his roommate he wouldn't be
back. Fed up with the academic rat
race, he headed East to "experience
the real world."
Tom bypassed his Nashville home,
disappointing his parents, and drove to
Florida where he wrestled a
jackhammer for several months. But
by spring Tom decided he was ready
to come back. He returned to
Stanford's summer session ready to
confront school and himself.
A growing number of college
students are turning to challenges and
diversions outside academia. A major
study of higher education reported
recently that less than half of those
students who enroll in a university
graduate four years later.
At Stanford, erratic "stop-and-go"
attendance has become increasingly
popular for students looking for a
break from the traditional September
to June, four-year lock-step.
Enrollment figures from the
Registrar's Office show that as many
as 300 Stanford students "stop-out"
each spring.
Only one-third of the student body
follows the fall-winter-spring four-year
sequence, most of the rest breaking
the pattern with summer school
attendance and one-quarter stop-outs.
An average of one-fourth of recent
student bodies has taken at least one
leave of absence before graduation.
Money Problems
Many students leave because of
money problems. Others travel or live
in a foreign country; some find
employment or intern in a field related
to their major.
Some others, like Earth man, leave
to "find themselves" or to recuperate
from "battle fatigue." Their
experiences differ, but most are glad
they left. They agree that learning
with books in classrooms is secondary
to the learning and understanding
gained through experience.
One student, a communications
major interested in politics, decided
not to go to school last spring quarter
when he was offered a paid job as
press assistant in Rep. Paul
McCloskey's (R-Menlo Park) campaign
for re-election. He felt the job was too
good an opportunity to pass up.
'Means More'
"This kind of experience means
much more to me than the normal
classroom education I could be
receiving this quarter," he explained
last spring. "Stanford will always be
there. This kind of opportunity
won't."
Another student left Stanford to

work as a "student consultant" at his
former high school. He handled
personal guidance, drug and college
counseling plus baseball coaching.
"The stop-out surpassed
expectations," he said. "It gave me the
satisfaction of knowing I can do
something, and do it well — that I can
apply theory to practical use."
Many students leave to clarify
direction and personal goals. They say
the constant stream of term papers,
exams and the distraction of
dormitory life competed with their
need to relax and reflect on what they
would do after graduation.
'Manic Depressive'
One student commented that she
was "lost in the manic depressive cycle
of students who have seen nothing of
the real world." She said she needed to
"get [her] head together" about
values, goals and directions.
Other stop-out activities have
included performing in the San
Francisco Symphony, working at an
overseas bank, interning in
Washington, D.C., with the National
Association of Educational
Broadcasters (NAEB), harvesting
Christmas trees and being an
apprentice plumber. Some students
participate in the Volunteers in Asia
program.
Stopping-out, while highly touted
by Stanford students, is a headache for
University program planners who have
been working overtime to solve
Stanford's economic problems. At a
time of heavy cutbacks and dwindling
income, the University prefers to
stabilize tuition income at a high
plateau by maintaining a high
enrollment level.
APO Survey
The Academic Planning Office
(APO) recently surveyed 900 former
stop-outs. According to APO
researcher Pnil Curry, the study was
conducted to determine what
motivates students to leave Stanford
and what they do while they're away.
It will be used to determine, among
other things, whether a stricter policy
for withdrawal is warranted, he said.
It will also measure demand for
curriculum changes such as
credit-granting alternatives to in-class
studies, slackened distribution and
graduation requirements, reduced unit
options and changes in University
financial aid policies. By meeting
student demands, Curry says Stanford
hopes erratic enrollment can be tamed.
Financial concerns or a desire to
minimize borrowing were mentioned
by 44 percent of those who
stopped-out of Stanford in 1972-73,
the survey showed.
Half On Aid
More than half of these students
were on financial aid of some sort.
Many who felt financial hardship lived
at home or enrolled in a less expensive
college and worked during their leave.
Some students expressed
disappointment with their earning
power and employment opportunities
but the savings still made the stop-out
from Stanford worthwhile, they said.
Now, however, students and their
parents appear increasingly concerned
about constant tuition increases.

Students seem less willing to delay
their graduation when fees will only be
higher in a future year.
Only half of the surveyed students
who stopped-out knew before they
left Stanford when they would return.
But most returned after one quarter.
Curry and co-researcher Susan Phillips
noted that there is no evidence of
students falling into a pattern of
repeated leave-taking or an overall
increase in the permanent drop-out
rate for undergraduates.
Lack Of Pattern
This lack of pattern is the heart of
the University's problem. If fixed
enrollment levels could be assured,
budget planners could ignore
stop-outs.
But the University has not been
able to accurately predict enrollment
drops. In the spring of 1973, the
University miscalculated enrollment
by almost two percentage points.
That meant a loss in tuition income
of more than $100,000 in 1972-73. As
non-tuition revenue sources begin to
dwindle during the current recession,
tuition will play a larger role as an
income source, and erratic enrollment
patterns become critical.
Provost William Miller says that
after an erratic period since 1967, the
number of stop-outs has stabilized
within the last year. This year the
University projected that 98 percent
of those students who registered last
fall would return for winter quarter,
and 93 percent for spring quarter.
Students and parents seem increasingly
concerned about finishing school
before another tuition increase, he
said.
The common image Stanford people
have of their place is that it's
somewhere near the best of all possible
worlds. It's free and easy, the sun
often shines, the people are hip,
intelligent and interesting, and you're

stop-outs. According to APO
researcher Pnil Curry, the study was
conducted to determine what
motivates students to leave Stanford
and what they do while they're away.
It will be used to determine, among
other things, whether a stricter policy
for withdrawal is warranted, he said.
It will also measure demand for
curriculum changes such as
credit-granting alternatives to in-class
studies, slackened distribution and
graduation requirements, reduced unit
options and changes in University
financial aid policies. By meeting
student demands, Curry says Stanford
hopes erratic enrollment can be tamed.
Financial concerns or a desire to
minimize borrowing were mentioned
by 44 percent of those who
stopped-out of Stanford in 1972-73,
the survey showed.
Half On Aid
More than half of these students
were on financial aid of some sort.
Many who felt financial hardship lived
at home or enrolled in a less expensive
college and worked during their leave.
Some students expressed
disappointment with their earning
power and employment opportunities
but the savings still made the stop-out
from Stanford worthwhile, they said.
Now, however, students and their
parents appear increasingly concerned
about constant tuition increases.

Students seem less willing to delay
their graduation when fees will only be
higher in a future year.
Only half of the surveyed students
who stopped-out knew before they
left Stanford when they would return.
But most returned after one quarter.
Curry and co-researcher Susan Phillips
noted that there is no evidence of
students falling into a pattern of
repeated leave-taking or an overall
increase in the permanent drop-out
rate for undergraduates.
Lack Of Pattern
This lack of pattern is the heart of
the University's problem. If fixed
enrollment levels could be assured,
budget planners could ignore
stop-outs.
But the University has not been
able to accurately predict enrollment
drops. In the spring of 1973, the
University miscalculated enrollment
by almost two percentage points.
That meant a loss in tuition income
of more than $100,000 in 1972-73. As
non-tuition revenue sources begin to
dwindle during the current recession,
tuition will play a larger role as an
income source, and erratic enrollment
patterns become critical.
Provost William Miller says that
after an erratic period since 1967, the
number of stop-outs has stabilized
within the last year. This year the
University projected that 98 percent
of those students who registered last
fall would return for winter quarter,
and 93 percent for spring quarter.
Students and parents seem increasingly
concerned about finishing school
before another tuition increase, he
said.
The common image Stanford people
have of their place is that it's
somewhere near the best of all possible
worlds. It's free and easy, the sun
often shines, the people are hip,
intelligent and interesting, and you're
free to pluck any goodies you will
from this almost unlimited tree.
—A Stanford Education
It took Tom Earth man only one
quarter to decide Stanford was not the
Land of Good and Plenty. When
Christmas break came during his
freshman year, he packed his bags and
told his roommate he wouldn't be
back. Fed up with the academic rat
race, he headed East to "experience
the real world."
Tom bypassed his Nashville home,
disappointing his parents, and drove to
Florida where he wrestled a
jackhammer for several months. But
by spring Tom decided he was ready
to come back. He returned to
Stanford's summer session ready to
confront school and himself.
A growing number of college
students are turning to challenges and
diversions outside academia. A major
study of higher education reported
recently that less than half of those
students who enroll in a university
graduate four years later.
At Stanford, erratic "stop-and-go"
attendance has become increasingly
popular for students looking for a
break from the traditional September
to June, four-year lock-step.
Enrollment figures from the
Registrar's Office show that as many
as 300 Stanford students "stop-out"
each spring.
Only one-third of the student body
follows the fall-winter-spring four-year
sequence, most of the rest breaking
the pattern with summer school
attendance and one-quarter stop-outs.
An average of one-fourth of recent
student bodies has taken at least one
leave of absence before graduation.
Money Problems
Many students leave because of
money problems. Others travel or live
in a foreign country; some find
employment or intern in a field related
to their major.
Some others, like Earth man, leave
to "find themselves" or to recuperate
from "battle fatigue." Their
experiences differ, but most are glad
they left. They agree that learning
with books in classrooms is secondary
to the learning and understanding
gained through experience.
One student, a communications
major interested in politics, decided
not to go to school last spring quarter
when he was offered a paid job as
press assistant in Rep. Paul
McCloskey's (R-Menlo Park) campaign
for re-election. He felt the job was too
good an opportunity to pass up.
'Means More'
"This kind of experience means
much more to me than the normal
classroom education I could be
receiving this quarter," he explained
last spring. "Stanford will always be
there. This kind of opportunity
won't."
Another student left Stanford to

work as a "student consultant" at his
former high school. He handled
personal guidance, drug and college
counseling plus baseball coaching.
"The stop-out surpassed
expectations," he said. "It gave me the
satisfaction of knowing I can do
something, and do it well — that I can
apply theory to practical use."
Many students leave to clarify
direction and personal goals. They say
the constant stream of term papers,
exams and the distraction of
dormitory life competed with their
need to relax and reflect on what they
would do after graduation.
'Manic Depressive'
One student commented that she
was "lost in the manic depressive cycle
of students who have seen nothing of
the real world." She said she needed to
"get [her] head together" about
values, goals and directions.
Other stop-out activities have
included performing in the San
Francisco Symphony, working at an
overseas bank, interning in
Washington, D.C., with the National
Association of Educational
Broadcasters (NAEB), harvesting
Christmas trees and being an
apprentice plumber. Some students
participate in the Volunteers in Asia
program.
Stopping-out, while highly touted
by Stanford students, is a headache for
University program planners who have
been working overtime to solve
Stanford's economic problems. At a
time of heavy cutbacks and dwindling
income, the University prefers to
stabilize tuition income at a high
plateau by maintaining a high
enrollment level.

student bodies has taken at least one
leave of absence before graduation.
Money Problems
Many students leave because of
money problems. Others travel or live
in a foreign country; some find
employment or intern in a field related
to their major.
Some others, like Earth man, leave
to "find themselves" or to recuperate
from "battle fatigue." Their
experiences differ, but most are glad
they left. They agree that learning
with books in classrooms is secondary
to the learning and understanding
gained through experience.
One student, a communications
major interested in politics, decided
not to go to school last spring quarter
when he was offered a paid job as
press assistant in Rep. Paul
McCloskey's (R-Menlo Park) campaign
for re-election. He felt the job was too
good an opportunity to pass up.
'Means More'
"This kind of experience means
much more to me than the normal
classroom education I could be
receiving this quarter," he explained
last spring. "Stanford will always be
there. This kind of opportunity
won't."
Another student left Stanford to

work as a "student consultant" at his
former high school. He handled
personal guidance, drug and college
counseling plus baseball coaching.
"The stop-out surpassed
expectations," he said. "It gave me the
satisfaction of knowing I can do
something, and do it well — that I can
apply theory to practical use."
Many students leave to clarify
direction and personal goals. They say
the constant stream of term papers,
exams and the distraction of
dormitory life competed with their
need to relax and reflect on what they
would do after graduation.
'Manic Depressive'
One student commented that she
was "lost in the manic depressive cycle
of students who have seen nothing of
the real world." She said she needed to
"get [her] head together" about
values, goals and directions.
Other stop-out activities have
included performing in the San
Francisco Symphony, working at an
overseas bank, interning in
Washington, D.C., with the National
Association of Educational
Broadcasters (NAEB), harvesting
Christmas trees and being an
apprentice plumber. Some students
participate in the Volunteers in Asia
program.
Stopping-out, while highly touted
by Stanford students, is a headache for
University program planners who have
been working overtime to solve
Stanford's economic problems. At a
time of heavy cutbacks and dwindling
income, the University prefers to
stabilize tuition income at a high
plateau by maintaining a high
enrollment level.
APO Survey
The Academic Planning Office
(APO) recently surveyed 900 former
stop-outs. According to APO
researcher Pnil Curry, the study was
conducted to determine what
motivates students to leave Stanford
and what they do while they're away.
It will be used to determine, among
other things, whether a stricter policy
for withdrawal is warranted, he said.
It will also measure demand for
curriculum changes such as
credit-granting alternatives to in-class
studies, slackened distribution and
graduation requirements, reduced unit
options and changes in University
financial aid policies. By meeting
student demands, Curry says Stanford
hopes erratic enrollment can be tamed.
Financial concerns or a desire to
minimize borrowing were mentioned
by 44 percent of those who
stopped-out of Stanford in 1972-73,
the survey showed.
Half On Aid
More than half of these students
were on financial aid of some sort.
Many who felt financial hardship lived
at home or enrolled in a less expensive
college and worked during their leave.
Some students expressed
disappointment with their earning
power and employment opportunities
but the savings still made the stop-out
from Stanford worthwhile, they said.
Now, however, students and their
parents appear increasingly concerned
about constant tuition increases.

Students seem less willing to delay
their graduation when fees will only be
higher in a future year.
Only half of the surveyed students
who stopped-out knew before they
left Stanford when they would return.
But most returned after one quarter.
Curry and co-researcher Susan Phillips
noted that there is no evidence of
students falling into a pattern of
repeated leave-taking or an overall
increase in the permanent drop-out
rate for undergraduates.
Lack Of Pattern
This lack of pattern is the heart of
the University's problem. If fixed
enrollment levels could be assured,
budget planners could ignore
stop-outs.
But the University has not been
able to accurately predict enrollment
drops. In the spring of 1973, the
University miscalculated enrollment
by almost two percentage points.
That meant a loss in tuition income
of more than $100,000 in 1972-73. As
non-tuition revenue sources begin to
dwindle during the current recession,
tuition will play a larger role as an
income source, and erratic enrollment
patterns become critical.
Provost William Miller says that
after an erratic period since 1967, the
number of stop-outs has stabilized
within the last year. This year the
University projected that 98 percent
of those students who registered last
fall would return for winter quarter,
and 93 percent for spring quarter.
Students and parents seem increasingly
concerned about finishing school
before another tuition increase, he
said.
The common image Stanford people
have of their place is that it's
somewhere near the best of all possible
worlds. It's free and easy, the sun
often shines, the people are hip,
intelligent and interesting, and you're
free to pluck any goodies you will
from this almost unlimited tree.
—A Stanford Education
It took Tom Earth man only one
quarter to decide Stanford was not the
Land of Good and Plenty. When
Christmas break came during his
freshman year, he packed his bags and
told his roommate he wouldn't be
back. Fed up with the academic rat
race, he headed East to "experience
the real world."
Tom bypassed his Nashville home,
disappointing his parents, and drove to
Florida where he wrestled a
jackhammer for several months. But
by spring Tom decided he was ready
to come back. He returned to
Stanford's summer session ready to
confront school and himself.
A growing number of college
students are turning to challenges and
diversions outside academia. A major
study of higher education reported
recently that less than half of those
students who enroll in a university
graduate four years later.
At Stanford, erratic "stop-and-go"
attendance has become increasingly
popular for students looking for a
break from the traditional September
to June, four-year lock-step.
Enrollment figures from the
Registrar's Office show that as many
as 300 Stanford students "stop-out"
each spring.
Only one-third of the student body
follows the fall-winter-spring four-year
sequence, most of the rest breaking
the pattern with summer school
attendance and one-quarter stop-outs.
An average of one-fourth of recent
student bodies has taken at least one
leave of absence before graduation.

enrollment levels could be assured,
budget planners could ignore
stop-outs.
But the University has not been
able to accurately predict enrollment
drops. In the spring of 1973, the
University miscalculated enrollment
by almost two percentage points.
That meant a loss in tuition income
of more than $100,000 in 1972-73. As
non-tuition revenue sources begin to
dwindle during the current recession,
tuition will play a larger role as an
income source, and erratic enrollment
patterns become critical.
Provost William Miller says that
after an erratic period since 1967, the
number of stop-outs has stabilized
within the last year. This year the
University projected that 98 percent
of those students who registered last
fall would return for winter quarter,
and 93 percent for spring quarter.
Students and parents seem increasingly
concerned about finishing school
before another tuition increase, he
said.
