# Kidnapers Release One Student; Tanzanians Reject Ransom Bid
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The Tanzanian government
yesterday rejected demands issued by
those who kidnaped three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher from
the Gombe Stream research center last
week, despite a reported threat against
the students' lives.
The demands were contained in a
letter delivered to authorities by
Barbara Smuts, one of the students,
who was freed by the kidnapers
Sunday.
The abductors, identified as
members of Zaire's Popular
Revolution Party movement, a Marxist
guerrilla group, had demanded
$460,000 ransom, arms and
ammunition and the release of two
alleged political prisoners being held in
Tanzania. The guerrillas gave a 60-day
deadline for compliance.
In what was described as the "final
government statement on the matter,"
a Tanzanian spokesman declared:
"Tanzania will not be blackmailed.
Now we must wait."
The guerrillas still hold Stanford
students Kenneth Stephen Smith, 22,

of Garden Grove, and Carrie Hunter,
21, of Atherton. Researcher Emilie
Bergman, 24, of the Netherlands also
is being held.
Held In Village
Smuts, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich.,
told reporters in the Tanzanian capital
of Dares Salaam that she and the
other three hostages were held in a
village in Zaire.
Smuts said the hostages have not
been harmed. "The hostages slept in
mud huts with thatched roofs on beds
of straw and ate local food," she said.
"We were kept warm and dry and
mostly talked to each other."
She did not reveal the location of
the village, which she said was
populated by civilians as well as
heavily armed soldiers from the
Marxist organization.
Left In Jungle
Smuts said her captors took her
from the village Saturday night and
transported her by boat across Lake
Tanganyika to Tanzania. She was left
in the jungle, where she made her way
to the Tanzanian town of Kigoma on
foot.
The Tanzanian spokesman said the
letter Smuts carried warned that the
remaining hostages' lives were still in
danger. He said the letter told
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere
that "the students' lives depend on
Tanzania's response."
There was no immediate guerrilla
response to Tanzania's rejection of the
offer.
Two Prisoners
The two Tanzanian prisoners for
whom freedom was demanded have
been identified as Gabriel Yumbu and
S. Kilinda. The Tanzanian spokesman
said the two had been freed in an
amnesty a month ago, but were
rearrested in the wake of the
kidnaping.
At Stanford, meanwhile, President
Richard Lyman said he has asked
Psychiatry Prof. David Hamburg, the
University's chief liaison with the
Gombe facility, to fly to Tanzania to
act as the University's representative in
the matter.
Hamburg met with Lyman
yesterday morning, but Lyman
declined to reveal the substance of
their conversation. A University
statement issued yesterday afternoon
said that because "the situation is both
delicate and complex ... we have no
further official comments at this
time."

Hamburg has been coordinating the
University's communications with the
State Department, the Tanzanian
government and the kidnaped
students' families. He is expected to
leave for Africa shortly.
Dr. Jane Goodall, the nationally
known primate researcher and director
of the facility, is remaining in the area
as well. Goodall was at the Gombe
compound during the raid last Monday
night, but was not harmed.
Emily Polis, 20, of Olympia, Wash.,
one of the students at the compound
at the time of the kidnaping, returned
to campus yesterday with descriptions
of the raid.
Slept Through Raid
Polis slept through the raid itself,
she said, but when she awoke she ran
into the woods to hide until she was
sure the raiders had left.

Polis praised the bravery of several
native Tanzanian staffers at the center,
who were among the first to confront
the attackers.
"Despite threats to their lives, they
did their best to protect us," she said.
The Tanzanians tried to mislead the
raiders by telling them there was no
director of the facility, and that there
were no Americans or Europeans
there. Several of the Tanzanians were
beaten by the raiders, although none
seriously.
Confirmed Accounts
Polis confirmed previous accounts
of between 30 and 40 heavily armed
invaders at the camp. She also praised
all the governments in the area,
including those of Tanzania and Zaire,
for their aid in the search for the
prisoners.

SMUTS RELEASED — Stanford student Barbara Smuts, 24, was released
Sunday by Zaire's Popular Revolution Party. Smuts brought letters from her
captors and fellow prisoners, but the Tanzanian government yesterday rejected
the ransom demands set forth by the party. Three persons are still captives.

The Popular Revolutionary Army,
apparently responsible for the
abduction, is a little-known Marxist
group operating in the eastern portion
of Zaire (formerly the Republic of the
Congo).
The group is opposed to Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko's Popular
Movement for Revolution, which is
the country's sole official political

party, according to Assoc. Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy.
However, Abernethy — who
specializes in African politics — said he
has "no special insight" into the
group. "I just draw a blank on them."
Smuts said of the group, "Our
captors repeatedly emphasized that
they are not bandits or pirates out for
personal gain, but that they presented
an organized military and political

force.
"They told us that this kidnaping
was not directed against the Dutch or
American people, but instead was
done in order to further their cause,
which is in their words 'the liberation
of all people of the Congo from the
government of President Mobutu and
the establishment of a just and
democratic government for all our
people.'"

Richard Lyman said he has asked
Psychiatry Prof. David Hamburg, the
University's chief liaison with the
Gombe facility, to fly to Tanzania to
act as the University's representative in
the matter.
Hamburg met with Lyman
yesterday morning, but Lyman
declined to reveal the substance of
their conversation. A University
statement issued yesterday afternoon
said that because "the situation is both
delicate and complex ... we have no
further official comments at this
time."

Hamburg has been coordinating the
University's communications with the
State Department, the Tanzanian
government and the kidnaped
students' families. He is expected to
leave for Africa shortly.
Dr. Jane Goodall, the nationally
known primate researcher and director
of the facility, is remaining in the area
as well. Goodall was at the Gombe
compound during the raid last Monday
night, but was not harmed.
Emily Polis, 20, of Olympia, Wash.,
one of the students at the compound
at the time of the kidnaping, returned
to campus yesterday with descriptions
of the raid.
Slept Through Raid
Polis slept through the raid itself,
she said, but when she awoke she ran
into the woods to hide until she was
sure the raiders had left.

Polis praised the bravery of several
native Tanzanian staffers at the center,
who were among the first to confront
the attackers.
"Despite threats to their lives, they
did their best to protect us," she said.
The Tanzanians tried to mislead the
raiders by telling them there was no
director of the facility, and that there
were no Americans or Europeans
there. Several of the Tanzanians were
beaten by the raiders, although none
seriously.
Confirmed Accounts
Polis confirmed previous accounts
of between 30 and 40 heavily armed
invaders at the camp. She also praised
all the governments in the area,
including those of Tanzania and Zaire,
for their aid in the search for the
prisoners.

SMUTS RELEASED — Stanford student Barbara Smuts, 24, was released
Sunday by Zaire's Popular Revolution Party. Smuts brought letters from her
captors and fellow prisoners, but the Tanzanian government yesterday rejected
the ransom demands set forth by the party. Three persons are still captives.

The Popular Revolutionary Army,
apparently responsible for the
abduction, is a little-known Marxist
group operating in the eastern portion
of Zaire (formerly the Republic of the
Congo).
The group is opposed to Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko's Popular
Movement for Revolution, which is
the country's sole official political

party, according to Assoc. Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy.
However, Abernethy — who
specializes in African politics — said he
has "no special insight" into the
group. "I just draw a blank on them."
Smuts said of the group, "Our
captors repeatedly emphasized that
they are not bandits or pirates out for
personal gain, but that they presented
an organized military and political

force.
"They told us that this kidnaping
was not directed against the Dutch or
American people, but instead was
done in order to further their cause,
which is in their words 'the liberation
of all people of the Congo from the
government of President Mobutu and
the establishment of a just and
democratic government for all our
people.'"
The Tanzanian government
yesterday rejected demands issued by
those who kidnaped three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher from
the Gombe Stream research center last
week, despite a reported threat against
the students' lives.
The demands were contained in a
letter delivered to authorities by
Barbara Smuts, one of the students,
who was freed by the kidnapers
Sunday.
The abductors, identified as
members of Zaire's Popular
Revolution Party movement, a Marxist
guerrilla group, had demanded
$460,000 ransom, arms and
ammunition and the release of two
alleged political prisoners being held in
Tanzania. The guerrillas gave a 60-day
deadline for compliance.
In what was described as the "final
government statement on the matter,"
a Tanzanian spokesman declared:
"Tanzania will not be blackmailed.
Now we must wait."
The guerrillas still hold Stanford
students Kenneth Stephen Smith, 22,

of Garden Grove, and Carrie Hunter,
21, of Atherton. Researcher Emilie
Bergman, 24, of the Netherlands also
is being held.
Held In Village
Smuts, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich.,
told reporters in the Tanzanian capital
of Dares Salaam that she and the
other three hostages were held in a
village in Zaire.
Smuts said the hostages have not
been harmed. "The hostages slept in
mud huts with thatched roofs on beds
of straw and ate local food," she said.
"We were kept warm and dry and
mostly talked to each other."
She did not reveal the location of
the village, which she said was
populated by civilians as well as
heavily armed soldiers from the
Marxist organization.
Left In Jungle
Smuts said her captors took her
from the village Saturday night and
transported her by boat across Lake
Tanganyika to Tanzania. She was left
in the jungle, where she made her way
to the Tanzanian town of Kigoma on
foot.
The Tanzanian spokesman said the
letter Smuts carried warned that the
remaining hostages' lives were still in
danger. He said the letter told
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere
that "the students' lives depend on
Tanzania's response."
There was no immediate guerrilla
response to Tanzania's rejection of the
offer.
Two Prisoners
The two Tanzanian prisoners for
whom freedom was demanded have
been identified as Gabriel Yumbu and
S. Kilinda. The Tanzanian spokesman
said the two had been freed in an
amnesty a month ago, but were
rearrested in the wake of the
kidnaping.

Science Prof. David Abernethy.
However, Abernethy — who
specializes in African politics — said he
has "no special insight" into the
group. "I just draw a blank on them."
Smuts said of the group, "Our
captors repeatedly emphasized that
they are not bandits or pirates out for
personal gain, but that they presented
an organized military and political

force.
"They told us that this kidnaping
was not directed against the Dutch or
American people, but instead was
done in order to further their cause,
which is in their words 'the liberation
of all people of the Congo from the
government of President Mobutu and
the establishment of a just and
democratic government for all our
people.'"
The Tanzanian government
yesterday rejected demands issued by
those who kidnaped three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher from
the Gombe Stream research center last
week, despite a reported threat against
the students' lives.
The demands were contained in a
letter delivered to authorities by
Barbara Smuts, one of the students,
who was freed by the kidnapers
Sunday.
The abductors, identified as
members of Zaire's Popular
Revolution Party movement, a Marxist
guerrilla group, had demanded
$460,000 ransom, arms and
ammunition and the release of two
alleged political prisoners being held in
Tanzania. The guerrillas gave a 60-day
deadline for compliance.
In what was described as the "final
government statement on the matter,"
a Tanzanian spokesman declared:
"Tanzania will not be blackmailed.
Now we must wait."
The guerrillas still hold Stanford
students Kenneth Stephen Smith, 22,

of Garden Grove, and Carrie Hunter,
21, of Atherton. Researcher Emilie
Bergman, 24, of the Netherlands also
is being held.
Held In Village
Smuts, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich.,
told reporters in the Tanzanian capital
of Dares Salaam that she and the
other three hostages were held in a
village in Zaire.
Smuts said the hostages have not
been harmed. "The hostages slept in
mud huts with thatched roofs on beds
of straw and ate local food," she said.
"We were kept warm and dry and
mostly talked to each other."
She did not reveal the location of
the village, which she said was
populated by civilians as well as
heavily armed soldiers from the
Marxist organization.
Left In Jungle
Smuts said her captors took her
from the village Saturday night and
transported her by boat across Lake
Tanganyika to Tanzania. She was left
in the jungle, where she made her way
to the Tanzanian town of Kigoma on
foot.
The Tanzanian spokesman said the
letter Smuts carried warned that the
remaining hostages' lives were still in
danger. He said the letter told
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere
that "the students' lives depend on
Tanzania's response."
There was no immediate guerrilla
response to Tanzania's rejection of the
offer.
Two Prisoners
The two Tanzanian prisoners for
whom freedom was demanded have
been identified as Gabriel Yumbu and
S. Kilinda. The Tanzanian spokesman
said the two had been freed in an
amnesty a month ago, but were
rearrested in the wake of the
kidnaping.
At Stanford, meanwhile, President
Richard Lyman said he has asked
Psychiatry Prof. David Hamburg, the
University's chief liaison with the
Gombe facility, to fly to Tanzania to
act as the University's representative in
the matter.
Hamburg met with Lyman
yesterday morning, but Lyman
declined to reveal the substance of
their conversation. A University
statement issued yesterday afternoon
said that because "the situation is both
delicate and complex ... we have no
further official comments at this
time."

Hamburg has been coordinating the
University's communications with the
State Department, the Tanzanian
government and the kidnaped
students' families. He is expected to
leave for Africa shortly.
Dr. Jane Goodall, the nationally
known primate researcher and director
of the facility, is remaining in the area
as well. Goodall was at the Gombe
compound during the raid last Monday
night, but was not harmed.
Emily Polis, 20, of Olympia, Wash.,
one of the students at the compound
at the time of the kidnaping, returned
to campus yesterday with descriptions
of the raid.
Slept Through Raid
Polis slept through the raid itself,
she said, but when she awoke she ran
into the woods to hide until she was
sure the raiders had left.

Polis praised the bravery of several
native Tanzanian staffers at the center,
who were among the first to confront
the attackers.
"Despite threats to their lives, they
did their best to protect us," she said.
The Tanzanians tried to mislead the
raiders by telling them there was no
director of the facility, and that there
were no Americans or Europeans
there. Several of the Tanzanians were
beaten by the raiders, although none
seriously.
Confirmed Accounts
Polis confirmed previous accounts
of between 30 and 40 heavily armed
invaders at the camp. She also praised
all the governments in the area,
including those of Tanzania and Zaire,
for their aid in the search for the
prisoners.
