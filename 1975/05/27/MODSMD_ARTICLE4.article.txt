# Editor Cites Staff Shortage
## 'Review' Likely To Fold 
### JOHN FREED 
The Stanford Review, a semi-annual
magazine which publishes student
papers, may soon cease publication,
according to its editor.
Sharon Clark, Review editor,
warned yesterday that lack of student
staffers could drive the magazine out
of business.
"It'll fold unless — we have to find
out whether there's any support or
not," Clark said.
The Review's purpose has been to
provide information on provocative
topics, Clark noted.
"The object was to publish
undergraduate papers and to increase
the intellectual dialog," Clark
explained. "It was started to heighten
intellectual discussions — [students]
would have more solid foundations
from which to argue or debate."
No Lack Of Papers
The Review has not been hurt,
however, by a lack of student papers,
according to Clark.
"We do get papers from students,"
she said, adding "We get a very low
response from faculty who we send
flyers to for papers. Some faculty
members are real good — they give us
papers."
But student staffing remains a
problem, Financial Manager Jim
Barnes said. "A lot of people who
would be interested work other places,
like for the Daily."
Continued Problems?
"If this is indicative of the
[student] support, we're going to
continue to have problems." Bames
stated. "If we found people on campus
who would be willing to work and if
the community at large showed some
support, then we'd keep going."
If the Review suspends publication,
its Summer 1975 issue will not appear.
Costs
Each edition of the Review costs
between $1500 and $2100 to put out,
according to Barnes.
"As soon as we pay the bills from

this issue, we'll be about $100 in
debt," Barnes said. "But we still have
about $500 coming from the Dean of
Student Affairs' Office." He insisted
that the magazine was not in trouble
financially.
The dean's office promised the
Review a total of $1500 this year,
according to Barnes. The Review also
received $600 from last year's ASSU
Program Fee, $250 from the

Publications Board and $250 from
subscriptions, Barnes said.
The Review will receive no money
next year from the Program Fee even
if it continues in operation. But Clark
seemed more worried over her lack of
staff.
"Unless it [the Review] seems to
be supported by the students, there's
no reason to keep trying to get
money."
