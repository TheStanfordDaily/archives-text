Lounging in his Business School
office, recently elected 1975-76
Faculty Senate Chairman Eugene
Webb says he is looking forward to
what he thinks will be a "fun job," but
admits, "I'm still trying to figure out
what the job is."
He knows that a large part of his
job simply will be representing the
Stanford faculty at various events and
claims that if he accepted all the
invitations he will receive, "It could
take up all my time."
As senate chairman, Webb also will
preside over the meetings of that
body. He sees the issues of budget cuts
and resource allocation as the main
problems that will face the senate next
year.
"The dollars and cents picture
stinks," he said simply, adding, "The
budget has got to be cut, and
someone's going to get hurt."
A full professor at Stanford since
1968, Webb is a self-confessed
"newcomer" to the senate. He is
presently serving the initial half of his
first two-year term as a member.
Webb's predecessor, current Senate
Chairman Gordon Craig, was
enthusiastic about his successor.
"I think it's a marvelous choice,"

Craig said. "He has excellent judgment
and considerable skill in persuasion —
all of the qualities that would make a
good senate chairman."
Although he is currently teaching
on organizational behavior, Webb
considers himself a "social
psychologist — it [the field) really
covers the whole damn world."
Before coming to Stanford, he
pursued his research and teaching
career at such places as the Chicago
Tribune, where he did marketing and
editorial research; the Medill School of
Journalism at Northwestern
University, where he instructed on the
effects of mass media; and the
Institute of Defense Analysis, where
he did research.
Webb is coauthor or coeditor of the
books Unobtrusive Measures,
Organizations of the Future and The
Interview. Currently he is supervising
research on the effects of deadlines on
human and animal behavior.
The 1975-76 Faculty Senate has
also chosen the four steering
committee members for next year.
They are Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Hans
Andersen, Sociology Prof. San ford
Dornbusch, Education Prof. Rosedith
Sitgreaves, and Asst. English Prof.
David Riggs.
