# Hammarskjold Aids Interaction
## 
### Erik van Lunteren 
Hammarskjold House arose out of a
faltering "international corridor" of
Gucalypto house. In winter quarter of
1972 a group of students met with
Cliff Clarke of Bechtel International
Center, and, during a series of
meetings, wrote a proposal for an
International House.
It would be "concerned with the
study of how another culture can be
learned without losing the identity of
one's culture."
Each house member would be able
to "share informally his own culture

with others through social
interactions, and to learn formally
some specific aspects of, or skills from,
another culture." That fall
Hammarskjold House opened,
replacing a defunct fraternity.
Residents Balanced
The house residents comprise a
balance between different types of
people. There are half men and half
women, one-third graduate students
and two-thirds undergraduates and
different world geographical areas are
represented as equally as possible.
The downfall of international
houses at many other universities is
that they tend to be composed of half
graduate foreign males and half
undergraduate American females;
strong efforts are made to ensure that
this does not happen at
Hammarskjold.
In addition, there are a number of
eating associates, so that those who
cannot live at Hammarskjold still have
the opportunity to interact with the
people there.
The house is run on a cooperative
basis, in which everyone does an equal
share of cooking, washing dishes and
keeping the house clean.
This results in more interaction
between house members, and allows
for greater flexibility in accommodating
visitors and special programs.
Many Activities
Structured activities include dinners
from specific countries, slide shows of
residents' home countries and
discussions at sherry hours and dinners
with members of the Stanford
community who have an interest in
international affairs, as well as with
members of the foreign diplomatic
community.
In addition, there is a guest room
for foreign visitors.
More important, however, are the
informal interactions between
residents of different cultural
backgrounds. Being exposed to others'
eating and living habits as well as their
ideas about everyday things is more
enlightening than any structured
lectures can hope to be. Not only do
Americans learn about foreign
cultures, but foreign students learn
about American culture.
Admittedly Hammarskjold House

still has a number of problems. After
an initial period in the beginning of
the year, much of the cultural
emphasis becomes subdued by
ordinary conversation not much
different from that at other living
units.
House members are not always
willing to take the time and initiative
to engage in structured activities.
There is too strong a tendency for the
adoption of American values, possibly
due to the strong pressures outside of
the house for foreigners to acculturate
to American ways of life.
Finally there is not enough
interaction between the house and the
rest of the University, both foreign
and American.
These, however, are all problems
which are being worked on by present
house members.

Hammarskjold is a small, tightly
knit microcosm, with a real group
identity. People are more willing to do
work for the house, because it is more
than a good place to live.
It gives foreign students a place to
live that is their own; here they are
accepted as normal rather than viewed
as curiosities or just "interesting
people," as they often are elsewhere.
It allows Americans and
non-Americans to find out about
different cultures, and to appreciate
and accept the differences between
them.
Finally, a greater sense of world
awareness is developed by the
interactions of the house members
with each other and with people
outside of the house.
It is only through interactions such
as these that personal and group
growth can be achieved.
