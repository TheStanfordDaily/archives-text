Writing about foreign students
proves difficult as one tends to fall
victim to many trite and hackneyed
expressions. At the risk of sounding
hokey and redundant let me proceed:
there are about 1300 (yes, as many as
that) foreign students on campus,
mostly graduates with heavy
concentrations in the engineering and
business schools.
This seems to be a major reason
why a substantial part of the Stanford
community seems to be oblivious of
their activities and vice versa.
Secondly the extracurricular
activities of a large number of us seem
centered around our own national
associations or ethnic groups.
I may be wrong but I noticed while
living in Crothers Memorial that the

various nationalities tended to stick
together whether it was playing
recreational volleyball or ping pong or
even watching television.
The reasons, of course, are many,
varying from the emotional security
offered by one's people in an alien
land, to the ties formed through
participation in the meetings of the
different national associations.
Wasted Opportunities
However, this does lead to a lot of
wasted opportunities. The foreign
students are restricted to a very
cursory and superficial exposure to
American society, one so radically
different from Asian, African and
Latin American; this is indeed a pity.
Some could of course claim that
the media has already done the job,
which may be true as regards America,
but at Stanford there exists a chance
to learn from people from other parts

of the world too.
To cite a personal example, while in
India the only time I came into
contact with South America was when
I studied the continents in high school.
It is only after arriving here last fall
that I have found a fascinating set of
similarities amongst people from areas
diametrically across on the earth.
I-Center
The I-Center tries to do as much as
possible, but by the end of our first
quarter here most of us lose many of
our ties to it as a result of
preoccupation with academics.
Therefore, even when we could, our
inertia prevents us from participating
in anything.
To me it also seems that a lot of the
Americans here are missing an
opportunity too. I doubt if more than
a handful shall later have the chance
to gain insight into foreign cultures
and societies managing to exist
without color TV, McDonald's or
1.T.& T.
Saying this may sound anomalous
in the light of Stanford's reputation
with respect to overseas studies but
maybe not because after all, with due
apologies to my Gaullic friends,
Western Europe is not very different
from the U.S.
Reactions
To illustrate what I said earlier
there are basically only two responses
I have elicited upon introducing
myself as a native of India. One is "Oh
Wow!" from people probably "aware"
of the spiritual heritage and/or
fascinated by the idea of serene, docile
creatures living in the past.
The other is, "Oh," and in the same
breath, "are people there really
starving?"
Of course this is understandable
because I feel that the fascination for
the Eastern world is because it sounds
exotic; quite distant from reality as it
exists here and the problems are
difficult for most people to relate to.
To appreciate the various facets of
these societies, one has to go a little
deeper than what the media with its
obsession for sensationalism provides.
International Association
To facilitate this and obviate some
of the problems and shortcomings
mentioned, there now exists a
rejuvenated International Association
(1.A.). It functions as an umbrella
organization for various groups
working towards this goal and works
in close liasion with, but independent
of, the I-Center.
Our activities are varied and have
included panel discussions, slide
shows, holiday activities, parties,
sports, a radio program on KZSU and
the recent lecture by Frances
Fitzgerald.
The I.A. also provided substantial
help with the Brazilian Carnival which
was a thumping success. Among the
continuing programs we have a
one-to-one languages exchange and
interested people are invited to sign up
at the I-Center.
We are also involved in helping the
I-Center with their "buddy system" in
the orientation program for incoming
foreign students next year.
International Festival
The most exciting is of course the
proposed International Festival
scheduled for October. It is going to
be a week-long affair with the theme
of "Unity in Diversity: A Festival of
International Understanding."
Included shall be cultural shows of
dance and music, food and craft stalls,

films, lectures, panel discussions, feats
and a carnival.
Work on it has started and we need
as much personpower (American and
foreign) as we can get; it is also never
too late for new ideas (there is an
important organizational meeting
tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the I-Center).
Activities like these are not only
very educational; they are a lot of fun

too. From the point of view of
meeting peop e, working together is
the best way of getting to know
someone.
To those who shy away due to fear
of time commitment, I would say that
activities/associations such as the I.A.
are a refreshing change, in fact just the
sort that many look for — those which
hardly ever "get in the way."
