# I-Center Fosters Cultural Exchange
## 
### Lee Zeigler 
Foreign students at Stanford
comprise 10 percent of the total
student body (1251 registered fall
quarter) and over 18 percent of the
graduate student enrollment, yet they
have not been for the most part a
"conspicuous minority" with
verbalized concerns and needs.
Considering that our foreign
student community represents 86
different countries or territories, and
many more cultural variations, this is
not surprising.
Yet there is a common bond: the
fact that the vast majority of our
foreign students face some level of
adjustment to the American scene,

drastic if the newcomer is for the first
time in the U.S. and from a
non-Western culture, or moderate if
coming to Stanford means transferring
from another American institution or
crossing the Canadian border.
Opportunities
To minimize the adjustment and
maximize the U.S. sojourn, the
incoming student from abroad is
presented with a smorgasbord of
opportunities.
He/she is offered a homestay with
an American family for eight days
prior to registration, a week-long
orientation program emanating from
the I-Center which dispenses
information, offers opportunities to
ask questions, and provides a number
of social and educational events
relating to Stanford and the
surrounding community.
The I-Center futhermore can serve
as a base for cross-cultural counseling
and social life throughout the
student's stay, or can be simply a place
where one's papers for extension of
non-immigrant status are processed
once a year.
Cultural Informants
Foreign students receive much
while they are at Stanford, but they
also give a great deal, and enrich all of
our lives in many ways.
Lately foreign students have been
serving as cultural informants in the
orientation of recruits for
Volunteers-in-Asia, and students
signed up for Overseas Studies
programs.
They serve as speakers in our
primary and secondary schools and in
our civic clubs and church
organizations throughout the
Peninsula.
Nationality groups band together to

put on cultural evenings at the
I-Center and in other locations to help
us learn more about the gastronomic,
visual and musical delights of
particular countries (next scheduled
is Pakistan Night on May 30).
Perhaps best of all, some of us are
privileged to develop real friendships
with individuals on a one-to-one basis.
Gathering Place
Unfortunately, since we do not use
Madison Avenue techniques to sell the
l-Center to the broader Stanford
community, many on our campus look
at the locale simply as "a gathering
place for the foreign students."

recruiting students, both foreign and
American, to serve as "buddies" to
new foreign students on an individual
basis beginning in the fall.
Foreign students give Stanford
mixed reviews. For a recent issue of
"Communique" the official newsletter
of the Community Committee for
International Students (the volunteer
body which supports the I-Center in
offering various kinds of community
hospitality and programming), 20
foreign students were asked at random
what they liked most and least about
the University.
Most of the affirmative responses
related to the excellence of academic
instruction and facilities and the
general physical environment of the
University, particularly the climate.
On the negative side, responses
included elitism, the high cost of study
here, impersonal attitudes toward
foreign students, the emphasis on
research rather than teaching ability of
the faculty and pressures resulting
from the keen academic competition
among students.
Isolating
The new foreign student who finds
the campus beautiful finds it equally
isolating.
For one who may have spent the
childhood, adolescence, and university
years surrounded by extended family,
tribal members, and peers as an
integral part of every stage of
development, there must be a double
sense of alienation upon coming to
another country to pursue education,
facing a new environment as well as
isolating living and study arrangements
such as Stanford provides for its
graduate students.
One of the most exciting evidences
of foreign student interaction
throughout the Stanford community
has been in the seminars on issues of
future survival presented by the
International Center over the past
several years.
Issues such as population growth,
food resources, energy, environmental
planning, and decision-making in
national and international policies,
have brought foreign students into
direct exchange and confrontation
with American students and faculty
members across disciplinary lines.
Hopefully, the experiences of these
seminars will help foreign students
prepare for their roles of leadership
when they return to their respective
countries.

planning, and decision-making in
national and international policies,
have brought foreign students into
direct exchange and confrontation
with American students and faculty
members across disciplinary lines.
Hopefully, the experiences of these
seminars will help foreign students
prepare for their roles of leadership
when they return to their respective
countries.

Foreign students at Stanford
comprise 10 percent of the total
student body (1251 registered fall
quarter) and over 18 percent of the
graduate student enrollment, yet they
have not been for the most part a
"conspicuous minority" with
verbalized concerns and needs.
Considering that our foreign
student community represents 86
different countries or territories, and
many more cultural variations, this is
not surprising.
Yet there is a common bond: the
fact that the vast majority of our
foreign students face some level of
adjustment to the American scene,

drastic if the newcomer is for the first
time in the U.S. and from a
non-Western culture, or moderate if
coming to Stanford means transferring
from another American institution or
crossing the Canadian border.
Opportunities
To minimize the adjustment and
maximize the U.S. sojourn, the
incoming student from abroad is
presented with a smorgasbord of
opportunities.
He/she is offered a homestay with
an American family for eight days
prior to registration, a week-long
orientation program emanating from
the I-Center which dispenses
information, offers opportunities to
ask questions, and provides a number
of social and educational events
relating to Stanford and the
surrounding community.
The I-Center futhermore can serve
as a base for cross-cultural counseling
and social life throughout the
student's stay, or can be simply a place
where one's papers for extension of
non-immigrant status are processed
once a year.
Cultural Informants
Foreign students receive much
while they are at Stanford, but they
also give a great deal, and enrich all of
our lives in many ways.
Lately foreign students have been
serving as cultural informants in the
orientation of recruits for
Volunteers-in-Asia, and students
signed up for Overseas Studies
programs.
They serve as speakers in our
primary and secondary schools and in
our civic clubs and church
organizations throughout the
Peninsula.
Nationality groups band together to

put on cultural evenings at the
I-Center and in other locations to help
us learn more about the gastronomic,
visual and musical delights of
particular countries (next scheduled
is Pakistan Night on May 30).
Perhaps best of all, some of us are
privileged to develop real friendships
with individuals on a one-to-one basis.
Gathering Place
Unfortunately, since we do not use
Madison Avenue techniques to sell the
l-Center to the broader Stanford
community, many on our campus look
at the locale simply as "a gathering
place for the foreign students."

Nationality groups band together to "one-to-one orientation" has been

recruiting students, both foreign and
American, to serve as "buddies" to
new foreign students on an individual
basis beginning in the fall.
Foreign students give Stanford
mixed reviews. For a recent issue of
"Communique" the official newsletter
of the Community Committee for
International Students (the volunteer
body which supports the I-Center in
offering various kinds of community
hospitality and programming), 20
foreign students were asked at random
what they liked most and least about
the University.
Most of the affirmative responses
related to the excellence of academic
instruction and facilities and the
general physical environment of the
University, particularly the climate.
On the negative side, responses
included elitism, the high cost of study
here, impersonal attitudes toward
foreign students, the emphasis on
research rather than teaching ability of
the faculty and pressures resulting
from the keen academic competition
among students.
Isolating
The new foreign student who finds
the campus beautiful finds it equally
isolating.
For one who may have spent the
childhood, adolescence, and university
years surrounded by extended family,
tribal members, and peers as an
integral part of every stage of
development, there must be a double
sense of alienation upon coming to
another country to pursue education,
facing a new environment as well as
isolating living and study arrangements
such as Stanford provides for its
graduate students.
One of the most exciting evidences
of foreign student interaction
throughout the Stanford community
has been in the seminars on issues of
future survival presented by the
International Center over the past
several years.
Issues such as population growth,
food resources, energy, environmental
planning, and decision-making in
national and international policies,
have brought foreign students into
direct exchange and confrontation
with American students and faculty
members across disciplinary lines.

another country to pursue education,
facing a new environment as well as
isolating living and study arrangements
such as Stanford provides for its
graduate students.
One of the most exciting evidences
of foreign student interaction
throughout the Stanford community
has been in the seminars on issues of
future survival presented by the
International Center over the past
several years.
Issues such as population growth,
food resources, energy, environmental
planning, and decision-making in
national and international policies,
have brought foreign students into
direct exchange and confrontation
with American students and faculty
members across disciplinary lines.
Hopefully, the experiences of these
seminars will help foreign students
prepare for their roles of leadership
when they return to their respective
countries.

Foreign students at Stanford
comprise 10 percent of the total
student body (1251 registered fall
quarter) and over 18 percent of the
graduate student enrollment, yet they
have not been for the most part a
"conspicuous minority" with
verbalized concerns and needs.
Considering that our foreign
student community represents 86
different countries or territories, and
many more cultural variations, this is
not surprising.
Yet there is a common bond: the
fact that the vast majority of our
foreign students face some level of
adjustment to the American scene,

drastic if the newcomer is for the first
time in the U.S. and from a
non-Western culture, or moderate if
coming to Stanford means transferring
from another American institution or
crossing the Canadian border.
Opportunities
To minimize the adjustment and
maximize the U.S. sojourn, the
incoming student from abroad is
presented with a smorgasbord of
opportunities.
He/she is offered a homestay with
an American family for eight days
prior to registration, a week-long
orientation program emanating from
the I-Center which dispenses
information, offers opportunities to
ask questions, and provides a number
of social and educational events
relating to Stanford and the
surrounding community.
The I-Center futhermore can serve
as a base for cross-cultural counseling
and social life throughout the
student's stay, or can be simply a place
where one's papers for extension of
non-immigrant status are processed
once a year.
Cultural Informants
Foreign students receive much
while they are at Stanford, but they
also give a great deal, and enrich all of
our lives in many ways.
Lately foreign students have been
serving as cultural informants in the
orientation of recruits for
Volunteers-in-Asia, and students
signed up for Overseas Studies
programs.
They serve as speakers in our
primary and secondary schools and in
our civic clubs and church
organizations throughout the
Peninsula.
Nationality groups band together to

put on cultural evenings at the
I-Center and in other locations to help
us learn more about the gastronomic,
visual and musical delights of
particular countries (next scheduled
is Pakistan Night on May 30).
Perhaps best of all, some of us are
privileged to develop real friendships
with individuals on a one-to-one basis.
Gathering Place
Unfortunately, since we do not use
Madison Avenue techniques to sell the
l-Center to the broader Stanford
community, many on our campus look
at the locale simply as "a gathering
place for the foreign students."

Nationality groups band together to "one-to-one orientation" has been

recruiting students, both foreign and
American, to serve as "buddies" to
new foreign students on an individual
basis beginning in the fall.
Foreign students give Stanford
mixed reviews. For a recent issue of
"Communique" the official newsletter
of the Community Committee for
International Students (the volunteer
body which supports the I-Center in
offering various kinds of community
hospitality and programming), 20
foreign students were asked at random
what they liked most and least about
the University.
Most of the affirmative responses
related to the excellence of academic
instruction and facilities and the
general physical environment of the
University, particularly the climate.
On the negative side, responses
included elitism, the high cost of study
here, impersonal attitudes toward
foreign students, the emphasis on
research rather than teaching ability of
the faculty and pressures resulting
from the keen academic competition
among students.
Isolating
The new foreign student who finds
the campus beautiful finds it equally
isolating.
For one who may have spent the
childhood, adolescence, and university
years surrounded by extended family,
tribal members, and peers as an
integral part of every stage of
development, there must be a double
sense of alienation upon coming to
another country to pursue education,
facing a new environment as well as
isolating living and study arrangements
