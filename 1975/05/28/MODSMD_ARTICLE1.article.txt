# Land of Greek monks: No women allowed
## Greece 
### JEFF LANSDALE 
A woman once dccidcd that she wanted
to go ashore at Mt. Athos in Greece. She
knew that females were forbidden there.
As she prepared to jump onto the dock
from the bow of a Greek fishing boat, a
shot was fired. Everyone looked up, and in
a window of a nearby monastery a monk
leaned out with a double-barreled shotgun.
He warned the captain to advise the
woman that the next shot would not be
fired into the air.
There arc no women on Mt. Athos, a
40-mile peninsula of northern Greece to
which orthodox monks from Europe,
Russia and the Middle East have migrated
since 963 A.D. Indeed, women arc not
even allowed to visit the 100 or so
monasteries which dot the coastline of this
holy land.
Ironically, mythology has it that the
Virgin Mary, while sailing from Jerusalem
to Europe, was caught by a storm and
flung onto the shores of Mt. Athos. She
was so amazed by the beauty of the land,
by the aromas of the spices and wild
flowers, and by the blue-grcen sea which
enveloped it that she determined that she
should be the only woman ever to set foot
upon the holy land.
The talc may be a bit far-fetched — it
certainly docs not sound very Christian.
But to this day, not only arc women
forbidden, but there are no female
domestic animals on the peninsula.
Undesirable Temptation
The reason is obvious: the monks do
not want to be tempted by women, and, as
Monk Pavlos of the monastery called
Xiropotamou has said, "We do not want
the mating of the animals to furnish an
outlandish spectacle to souls which detest
all forms of indecency, and arc daily being
purified."
The monasteries of Mt. Athos arc
mammoth stone structures, often rising
straight up from the cliffs, and at times
dangling perilously over the Aegean Sea.
One wonders in awe how the
monasteries have managed to survive the
past 1000 years. They arc inhabited by
men who have dccidcd to renounce lives
within socicty in favor of more spiritually
austere ones.
Seclusion
The monks consider their land to be an
autonomous state. Although officially they
have at different times been annexed by
the Turks and the Greeks, they continue to
live in seclusion, isolated from the strife
and activity of the rest of the world. They
have their own capitol, Karycs, their own
government, and a small, generally inactive
police unit.
There arc no roads leading to the
monasteries from the mainland, and only a
few roads within the peninsula used by a

half dozen trucks to transport logs, spices,
honey, retsina (their wine), ouzo (a
liqueur), and other exports from the
interior to the docks. Greek fishing boats —
kaiques — transport these products to
other parts of the country.
Toward the end of the peninsula the
land itself climbs to a peak of 6000 feet -
this is Mt. Athos, from which the peninsula
takes its name. At the foot of the Holy
Mountain, hermits who could not bear to
live even within the monastic communities
have turned caves eroded by the sea into
their homes.
Trade Food For Wisdom
These hermits say that they depend on
God alone for their food: sometimes
sympathetic fishermen stop and share part
of their morning catch; sometimes
interested explorers climb down to the
caves and exchange food for spiritual
wisdom.
The monasteries used to be crowded
and extremely wealthy. Today, however,
the monks are no longer receiving funds
from the Greek and Russian orthodox
churches, and monasteries which once held
as many as 2000 monks are now occupied
by no more than 20.
It is discouraging, yet still quite
fascinating, to watch a handful of monks
carry on the austere religious practices to
which they have devoted their lives.
They have not joined in search of an
easy and simple livelihood. They are
summoned to church at midnight and at
four in the morning for services which go
on for hours. During the day they farm or
fish, and in the afternoons they are
expected to carry on with their hobbies,
which range from painting icons to writing
books to studying ancient manuscripts.
Suspicious Of Tourists
A man who visits the monasteries must
first secure a pass for 100 drachmas
($3.33), then travel by bus to the edge of
the peninsula. From there he takes a
kaique for about an hour's ride to the
headquarters where the monks will look
him over.
The monks have become suspicious of
tourists and place stringent demands upon
them. Beards must be shaved, and long hair
cut short. If a man has not already taken
these precautions, they will administer the
rites there and then, free of charge, but
rather crudely. Otherwise, he will be
turned away.
Once past the headquarters, he is free to
travel to any monastery. There arc paths
leading from one to the other. As there arc
no machines to disturb the peace, he may
find himself meandering in bliss among
songs of wildlife and delightful fragrances.
The weather gets hot during the

summer, and thus a long hike
makes the hospitality of the
monks seem even more special.
After a tour of the monastery, he
will be invited to dine with the
monks, refreshed first by a shot or
two of ouzo, and then by a feast
of fresh vegetables, seafood and
delicious barreled retsina.
He might dccide to take a nap,
cooled by the shade of a tree and
by the breeze blown in from the
Aegean, before leaving in the late
afternoon for another monastery
to spend the night and partake in
the services at midnight and early
in the morning.
By the way, he must beware of
especially friendly monks — it

seems some have tired along the
celibate path of renunciation.
Any female companion will be
advised to take a kaique trip along
the coast, 300 yards from shore.
The ride will be rewarding because
the view is spectacular.
Any woman who wants to visit
should be warned that the monks
arc not sympathetic to her cause.
A French woman once walked
along the coast, thinking that she
might be able to explore the
monasteries without being caught.
But she was apprehended, and the
monks wanted to hang her as an
example. Only after both the
Greek and French governments
had exerted pressure was she
finally released.
