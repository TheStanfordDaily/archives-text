## Hiking in the Himalayas: Hardly a Sierra-style trek 
### KAREN EGBERT SUE MULLER 
Trekking in the Himalayas is
not like backpacking in the
Sierras, but we didn't know that
until we went. Our California
hiking experience left us
surprisingly unprepared for our
30-day trek to Everest base camp.
The problem was that we had
arrived in Katmandu with
camping equipment, freeze-dried
food, and the expectation of a
California-style hike in the
Himalayas. To our chagrin, we
found ourselves burdened with
local pressure to hire a guide,
cook and porters to accompany
us.
Because the local residents,
called Sherpas, depend on foreign
expeditions and hikers to supply
cash income, we would have
caused resentment among the
people had we stubbornly insisted
on proving our mountaineering
abilities and independence.
As it turned out, we soon saw
the need for such seeming
extravagance. On our own we
would not have known how to
bargain for food and firewood, or
how to find a place to sleep in the

villages or fields.
We appreciated the Sherpas'
aid in easing the physical rigors of
the trip; we had never climbed the
equivalent of three Yosemite Falls
trails in one day, nor suffered
bouts with mild dysentery while
hiking, nor felt the effects of an
altitude of 17,000 feet. We were
glad to be carrying only 15
pounds.
And we found that a guide,
cook and porters weren't the
extravagance we had anticipated:
the guide cost $2 a day, the cook
$1.50 and each porter $1.20.
After hiring a young Sherpa
guide in Katmandu, we flew into
the foothills, thereby avoiding a
hot 10-day hike through the
valley. When we were left on a
grass landing strip at 7000 feet,
we were 100 miles from the
nearest road.
Not A Wilderness
Being so far from the familiar
trappings of Western civilization,
we thought we'd be in mountain
wilderness. Instead, our steep,
narrow trail, which wound up and
down dry stream beds, was the
Sherpas' main highway.
In the 50 miles from our

landing strip village of Jiri to
Everest base camp we hiked
through some 35 villages of small
stone or mud houses surrounded
by stone-walled, terraced fields of
barley and potatoes.
Each day we were passed by
men, women and children going
about their business. Some carried
15-foot logs for house
construction; others were laden
with 60-pound buckets of water;
and others carried produce and
provisions from as far away as
Katmandu to the higher mountain
markets.
Way Stations
In most villages there were
small teahouses where porters and
travelers could warm themselves
by the fire, get something to cat,
and sleep on the dirt floor. The
fare at these huts was cheap and
filling; one rupee (10 cents)
procured a heaping plate of
tsampa, a heavy brown
barley-flour paste, and a mug of
Sherpa tea (a hot drink of tea, salt
and rancid yak butter).
Each day we were awakened at
5:30 by our cook's cheerful
"Good morning!" as she served us
a tray of hot tea and rice porridge.
Who would have thought that a
tray was essential equipment on a
camping trip?
Hiking All Day
After breakfast the porters
struck the tent and we all loaded
our packs. By seven we were on
the trail. Most days we hiked until
11 when we stopped for a
leisurely two-hour lunch.
This was the time for us to
bathe and wash clothes in the
murky glacial streams while our
cook prepared eggs, fried
potatoes, sausage or beans, and
flatbread or pancakes with peanut
butter and honey. In the
afternoons we walked until four
or five, had a light supper, and
were asleep by eight.
