## Living with Soviet students in another world 
### BARBARA BELLAIRE JOHN PHILLIPS 
Russian youths have a name for America. They call
it "Mars."
The idea of America is so alien and far-off to them,
and the prospects of ever visiting it so remote, that
they seem to think of it as another planet.
As former "Martians" who spent four months last
autumn in the U.S.S.R. as exchange students at
Leningrad State University, it seems to us that Russia/-
with its fundamentally different style of life, is also
something of another world for Americans.
Before entering the Soviet Union, we are given a
stern lecture by our group leader. "As you know, the
Soviet authorities have rather severe hang-ups about
certain literature, certain ideas, and certain subjects of
conversation." We are admonished not to take any
literature into the country that the Soviets would
consider provocative: Solzhcnitsyn, even the New York
Times.
We will be living in a regular dormitory with Soviet
roommates, our director informs us. He warns us to
avoid talking about touchy subjects in the dorm. Don't
ask too many questions about the recent bulldozing of
a contemporary art exhibit in Moscow. Never mention
the name of a Russian friend in front of your
roommates - if you do, it will find its way to the KGB
(Soviet secret police).
Phones Are Tapped
Furthermore, don't use the dormitory to call
Russian friends — the lines arc tapped, and the
authorities will know that your friend is meeting with
Americans. That's something many Russians do not
want their authorities to know.
The dormitory is old, but the Russian students who
lived with us arc very nice and helpful. We often feel as
if they arc there to try to keep us from associating with
the "street people" — young Russians who wear their
hair long, smoke marijuana, and listen to Western
records. Russian authorities do not consider them the
best representatives of the Soviet Union, and would
prefer that we not spend time with them.
Nevertheless, several members of our group make
the acquaintance of "street people." A few even take a
chance with the harsh Soviet anti-drug laws and smoke
a few numbers with their Russian hosts, who like to
mix the weed with a little tobacco so the scent will not
be noticeable to passcrsby.
Roommates Are 'Straight'
Our roommates, we quickly discovered, arc
extremely "straight," orthodox young communists.
Although very pleasant to us, and interested in getting
to know Americans, they are inflexible when it comes
to political arguments.

We arc told by them, for instance, that the 1968
Czech invasion was a "liberation." "Oh, yes," one of
our roommates tells us over the tea and black bread
that serves as a nightly snack in the dorm, "the Russian
troops were brought in at the request of the Czech
government. Our tanks were greeted with flowers and
cheers as they rolled through the mountain passes into
Czechoslovakia."
A discussion of Watergate with Soviet students is
equally fascinating. One young Soviet woman cannot
understand why the U.S. did away with such a great
peacemaker as Richard Nixon. She insists that the real
reason he was ousted was that he angered the right
wing in America with his policy of detente. It is gravely
pointed out to us that Nixon had paid a visit to the
U.S.S.R. only two months before his resignation —
wasn't that the real reason he was kicked out?
American Movies
The Russian students do their best to entertain us.
One evening we are taken to sec the premiere showing
of an American film — The New Centurions — at one
of Leningrad's newest movie theaters. We go on the
trolleybus, squeezing on and passing our Kopeck fare
through seven or eight people to the cash box. Soviet
public transit tends to be crowded, but it is fast, and
cheap.
In the theater, the Russians breathlessly follow the
battle between cops and crooks on the streets of Los
Angeles. The English words have been dubbed over
with Russian, some of the more gruesome scenes have
been cut, and one sequence concerning homosexuals
edited out altogether.
Afterwards the audience files out slowly, having
viewed half a dozen shoot-outs and assorted felonious
acts, shaken at the thought that such a dangerous and
lawless society exists only an ocean away.
Oklahoma 'Crude'
Such an impression is reinforced by any other
American film they are allowed to see: The Chase, with
Marlon Brando, for instance, or Oklahoma Crude, with
George C. Scott, a favorite with Russian audiences. In
the latter movie, the translators goofed. Not realizing
that the second word refers to oil, they translated the
title into Russian as "Oklahoma As It Is" — in other
words, crude.
After the movie, we make a half-hearted attempt to
look for some entertainment, but the sidewalks of
Leningrad are generally rolled up at 9 p.m. or so. As far
as the younger generation is concerned, the most
upsetting failure of the Soviet regime is its inability to
provide anything to do once the sun goes down.
The tremendously high rate of alcoholism seems a
direct result of this dearth of activity. Our roommates
in the dorm drink every night, and get drunk at least

once a week. There are more ways of saying "to be
drunk" in the Russian language than in the majority of
other European languages combined.
Farewells Over Vodka
Christmas comes. We celebrate in isolation,
surrounded by a city of four million for whom Dec. 25
is but another work day.
We spend a wild, drunken New Year's Eve with the
Russians. The New Year's holiday is the Soviets'
non-religious answer to Christmas. They exchange gifts,
and the young anxiously wait for "Grandfather Frost"
to arrive.
When we awaken on Jan. 2, there are only three
days left. We frantically make last minute visits to our
Russian friends and final exchanges of gifts. There are
emotional farewells over numerous shot glasses of
vodka.
The night of Jan. 3 is the going away party with our
professors. Scores of toasts are raised between teacher
and student, Russian and American, all of them dealing
with that grand idea that the Russians call dru/hba and
we call friendship.
New Restrictions?
There is another group of 30 American students
studying in Leningrad now, but it's possible that the
Soviet government has moved them from the
dormitory to a hotel where the police can keep a closer
watch' on them. Groups studying at the Leningrad
State University have been the only ones living in
Soviet student dorms rather than hotels.
We don't know how much longer our program will
last, how much longer American students will be
allowed to live and work and eat and sleep side by side
with their Soviet counterparts. We hope it will be for a
long time to come. Just as strongly, we hope for the
day when some of the many Russian friends that we
made will be able to visit us here.
Mars awaits them.

Leningrad are generally rolled up at 9 p.m. or so. As far
as the younger generation is concerned, the most
upsetting failure of the Soviet regime is its inability to
provide anything to do once the sun goes down.
The tremendously high rate of alcoholism seems a
direct result of this dearth of activity. Our roommates
in the dorm drink every night, and get drunk at least

once a week. There are more ways of saying "to be
drunk" in the Russian language than in the majority of
other European languages combined.
Farewells Over Vodka
Christmas comes. We celebrate in isolation,
surrounded by a city of four million for whom Dec. 25
is but another work day.
We spend a wild, drunken New Year's Eve with the
Russians. The New Year's holiday is the Soviets'
non-religious answer to Christmas. They exchange gifts,
and the young anxiously wait for "Grandfather Frost"
to arrive.
When we awaken on Jan. 2, there are only three
days left. We frantically make last minute visits to our
Russian friends and final exchanges of gifts. There are
emotional farewells over numerous shot glasses of
vodka.
The night of Jan. 3 is the going away party with our
professors. Scores of toasts are raised between teacher
and student, Russian and American, all of them dealing
with that grand idea that the Russians call dru/hba and
we call friendship.
New Restrictions?
There is another group of 30 American students
studying in Leningrad now, but it's possible that the
Soviet government has moved them from the
dormitory to a hotel where the police can keep a closer
watch' on them. Groups studying at the Leningrad
State University have been the only ones living in
Soviet student dorms rather than hotels.
We don't know how much longer our program will
last, how much longer American students will be
allowed to live and work and eat and sleep side by side
with their Soviet counterparts. We hope it will be for a
long time to come. Just as strongly, we hope for the
day when some of the many Russian friends that we
made will be able to visit us here.
Mars awaits them.

Russian youths have a name for America. They call
it "Mars."
The idea of America is so alien and far-off to them,
and the prospects of ever visiting it so remote, that
they seem to think of it as another planet.
As former "Martians" who spent four months last
autumn in the U.S.S.R. as exchange students at
Leningrad State University, it seems to us that Russia/-
with its fundamentally different style of life, is also
something of another world for Americans.
Before entering the Soviet Union, we are given a
stern lecture by our group leader. "As you know, the
Soviet authorities have rather severe hang-ups about
certain literature, certain ideas, and certain subjects of
conversation." We are admonished not to take any
literature into the country that the Soviets would
consider provocative: Solzhcnitsyn, even the New York
Times.
We will be living in a regular dormitory with Soviet
roommates, our director informs us. He warns us to
avoid talking about touchy subjects in the dorm. Don't
ask too many questions about the recent bulldozing of
a contemporary art exhibit in Moscow. Never mention
the name of a Russian friend in front of your
roommates - if you do, it will find its way to the KGB
(Soviet secret police).
Phones Are Tapped
Furthermore, don't use the dormitory to call
Russian friends — the lines arc tapped, and the
authorities will know that your friend is meeting with
Americans. That's something many Russians do not
want their authorities to know.
The dormitory is old, but the Russian students who
lived with us arc very nice and helpful. We often feel as
if they arc there to try to keep us from associating with
the "street people" — young Russians who wear their
hair long, smoke marijuana, and listen to Western
records. Russian authorities do not consider them the
best representatives of the Soviet Union, and would
prefer that we not spend time with them.
Nevertheless, several members of our group make
the acquaintance of "street people." A few even take a
chance with the harsh Soviet anti-drug laws and smoke
a few numbers with their Russian hosts, who like to
mix the weed with a little tobacco so the scent will not
be noticeable to passcrsby.
Roommates Are 'Straight'
Our roommates, we quickly discovered, arc
extremely "straight," orthodox young communists.
Although very pleasant to us, and interested in getting
to know Americans, they are inflexible when it comes
to political arguments.

We arc told by them, for instance, that the 1968
Czech invasion was a "liberation." "Oh, yes," one of
our roommates tells us over the tea and black bread
that serves as a nightly snack in the dorm, "the Russian
troops were brought in at the request of the Czech
government. Our tanks were greeted with flowers and
cheers as they rolled through the mountain passes into
Czechoslovakia."
A discussion of Watergate with Soviet students is
equally fascinating. One young Soviet woman cannot
understand why the U.S. did away with such a great
peacemaker as Richard Nixon. She insists that the real
reason he was ousted was that he angered the right
wing in America with his policy of detente. It is gravely
pointed out to us that Nixon had paid a visit to the
U.S.S.R. only two months before his resignation —
wasn't that the real reason he was kicked out?
American Movies
The Russian students do their best to entertain us.
One evening we are taken to sec the premiere showing
of an American film — The New Centurions — at one
of Leningrad's newest movie theaters. We go on the
trolleybus, squeezing on and passing our Kopeck fare
through seven or eight people to the cash box. Soviet
public transit tends to be crowded, but it is fast, and
cheap.
In the theater, the Russians breathlessly follow the
battle between cops and crooks on the streets of Los
Angeles. The English words have been dubbed over
with Russian, some of the more gruesome scenes have
been cut, and one sequence concerning homosexuals
edited out altogether.
Afterwards the audience files out slowly, having
viewed half a dozen shoot-outs and assorted felonious
acts, shaken at the thought that such a dangerous and
lawless society exists only an ocean away.
Oklahoma 'Crude'
Such an impression is reinforced by any other
American film they are allowed to see: The Chase, with
Marlon Brando, for instance, or Oklahoma Crude, with
George C. Scott, a favorite with Russian audiences. In
the latter movie, the translators goofed. Not realizing
that the second word refers to oil, they translated the
title into Russian as "Oklahoma As It Is" — in other
words, crude.
After the movie, we make a half-hearted attempt to
look for some entertainment, but the sidewalks of
Leningrad are generally rolled up at 9 p.m. or so. As far
as the younger generation is concerned, the most

We arc told by them, for instance, that the 1968
Czech invasion was a "liberation." "Oh, yes," one of
our roommates tells us over the tea and black bread
that serves as a nightly snack in the dorm, "the Russian
troops were brought in at the request of the Czech
government. Our tanks were greeted with flowers and
cheers as they rolled through the mountain passes into
Czechoslovakia."
A discussion of Watergate with Soviet students is
equally fascinating. One young Soviet woman cannot
understand why the U.S. did away with such a great
peacemaker as Richard Nixon. She insists that the real
reason he was ousted was that he angered the right
wing in America with his policy of detente. It is gravely
pointed out to us that Nixon had paid a visit to the
U.S.S.R. only two months before his resignation —
wasn't that the real reason he was kicked out?
American Movies
The Russian students do their best to entertain us.
One evening we are taken to sec the premiere showing
of an American film — The New Centurions — at one
of Leningrad's newest movie theaters. We go on the
trolleybus, squeezing on and passing our Kopeck fare
through seven or eight people to the cash box. Soviet
public transit tends to be crowded, but it is fast, and
cheap.
In the theater, the Russians breathlessly follow the
battle between cops and crooks on the streets of Los
Angeles. The English words have been dubbed over
with Russian, some of the more gruesome scenes have
been cut, and one sequence concerning homosexuals
edited out altogether.
Afterwards the audience files out slowly, having
viewed half a dozen shoot-outs and assorted felonious
acts, shaken at the thought that such a dangerous and
lawless society exists only an ocean away.
Oklahoma 'Crude'
Such an impression is reinforced by any other
American film they are allowed to see: The Chase, with
Marlon Brando, for instance, or Oklahoma Crude, with
George C. Scott, a favorite with Russian audiences. In
the latter movie, the translators goofed. Not realizing
that the second word refers to oil, they translated the
title into Russian as "Oklahoma As It Is" — in other
words, crude.
After the movie, we make a half-hearted attempt to
look for some entertainment, but the sidewalks of
Leningrad are generally rolled up at 9 p.m. or so. As far
as the younger generation is concerned, the most
upsetting failure of the Soviet regime is its inability to
provide anything to do once the sun goes down.
The tremendously high rate of alcoholism seems a
direct result of this dearth of activity. Our roommates
in the dorm drink every night, and get drunk at least

once a week. There are more ways of saying "to be
drunk" in the Russian language than in the majority of
other European languages combined.
Farewells Over Vodka
Christmas comes. We celebrate in isolation,
surrounded by a city of four million for whom Dec. 25
is but another work day.
We spend a wild, drunken New Year's Eve with the
Russians. The New Year's holiday is the Soviets'
non-religious answer to Christmas. They exchange gifts,
and the young anxiously wait for "Grandfather Frost"
to arrive.
When we awaken on Jan. 2, there are only three
days left. We frantically make last minute visits to our
Russian friends and final exchanges of gifts. There are
emotional farewells over numerous shot glasses of
vodka.
The night of Jan. 3 is the going away party with our
professors. Scores of toasts are raised between teacher
and student, Russian and American, all of them dealing
with that grand idea that the Russians call dru/hba and
we call friendship.
New Restrictions?
There is another group of 30 American students
studying in Leningrad now, but it's possible that the
Soviet government has moved them from the
dormitory to a hotel where the police can keep a closer
watch' on them. Groups studying at the Leningrad
State University have been the only ones living in
Soviet student dorms rather than hotels.
We don't know how much longer our program will
last, how much longer American students will be
allowed to live and work and eat and sleep side by side
with their Soviet counterparts. We hope it will be for a
long time to come. Just as strongly, we hope for the
day when some of the many Russian friends that we
made will be able to visit us here.
Mars awaits them.

Russian youths have a name for America. They call
it "Mars."
The idea of America is so alien and far-off to them,
and the prospects of ever visiting it so remote, that
they seem to think of it as another planet.
As former "Martians" who spent four months last
autumn in the U.S.S.R. as exchange students at
Leningrad State University, it seems to us that Russia/-
with its fundamentally different style of life, is also
something of another world for Americans.
Before entering the Soviet Union, we are given a
stern lecture by our group leader. "As you know, the
Soviet authorities have rather severe hang-ups about
certain literature, certain ideas, and certain subjects of
conversation." We are admonished not to take any
literature into the country that the Soviets would
consider provocative: Solzhcnitsyn, even the New York
Times.
We will be living in a regular dormitory with Soviet
roommates, our director informs us. He warns us to
avoid talking about touchy subjects in the dorm. Don't
ask too many questions about the recent bulldozing of
a contemporary art exhibit in Moscow. Never mention
the name of a Russian friend in front of your
roommates - if you do, it will find its way to the KGB
(Soviet secret police).
Phones Are Tapped
Furthermore, don't use the dormitory to call
Russian friends — the lines arc tapped, and the
authorities will know that your friend is meeting with
Americans. That's something many Russians do not
want their authorities to know.
The dormitory is old, but the Russian students who
lived with us arc very nice and helpful. We often feel as
if they arc there to try to keep us from associating with
the "street people" — young Russians who wear their
hair long, smoke marijuana, and listen to Western
records. Russian authorities do not consider them the
best representatives of the Soviet Union, and would
prefer that we not spend time with them.
Nevertheless, several members of our group make
the acquaintance of "street people." A few even take a
chance with the harsh Soviet anti-drug laws and smoke
a few numbers with their Russian hosts, who like to
mix the weed with a little tobacco so the scent will not
be noticeable to passcrsby.
Roommates Are 'Straight'
Our roommates, we quickly discovered, arc
extremely "straight," orthodox young communists.
Although very pleasant to us, and interested in getting
to know Americans, they are inflexible when it comes
to political arguments.

We arc told by them, for instance, that the 1968
Czech invasion was a "liberation." "Oh, yes," one of
our roommates tells us over the tea and black bread
