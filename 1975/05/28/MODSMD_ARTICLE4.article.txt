# Posh Paris apartment provides quiet refuge
## 
### RICHARD HALL 
We arrived at Charles De Gaulle
airport on a humid July morning.
And we had no idea of where we
would stay in Paris.
My friend and I checked into a
hotel. And as our room bills
mounted, the apartment
advertisements in the
International Herald Tribune
began to look more and more
attractive.
The hunt for our apartment
began. We declined to use the
services of a temporary rental
agency, because the finding fees
and deposits were high. We called
several phone numbers listed in
the Herald Tribune and found
that most landlords, who usually
spoke fluent English, wanted to
rent for more than five weeks.
One listing, located in a
fashionable arrondissement
(neighborhood), sounded good.
We called. Thirty minutes later we
were on the Rue de Passy. We
soon discovered that it was not
the address of the apartment, but
of the owner's office.
The landlord was a
transplanted Moroccan — short,
dark-skinned, wearing a
tight-fitting shirt and carefully
combed back hair. He ushered us
into his Alfa Romeo and, darting
through Parisian traffic, whisked
us off to the apartment.
We inspected the two
bedrooms, kitchen and bath with
inexperienced eyes. We admired
the heavy ceiling ornamentation,
vaguely reminiscent of plaster of
paris, and gazed out the large
French windows in the three
principal rooms.
But we laughed at the

"pre-whore" dining room table
with its heavy, carved, gold-leafed
legs and matching red-plush
high-backed chairs. They might
have been shipped straight from
the Place Pigalle, the "red-light"
district of Paris.
Our landlord was so casual
about rental arrangements that we
feared that the red lampshades in
the salon might have some sinister
meaning. Within 30 minutes he
rented the place to us, requiring
no deposit and not charging us for
utilities.
But it didn't take us long to
discover that our suspicions were
unfounded and that red
lampshades were merely a
fashionable furniture item in the
neighborhood. The apartment
proved to be very convenient,
except for the peering eyes of the
concierge (the resident caretaker
of the building) who appeared
baffled by our array of American
guests.
We learned of the frustrations
of apartment living as well as of
the joys of Paris. Our oven didn't
work, but we solved the cooking
problem by buying delicious
meats, quiche (a cheese pie), and
salads at the local charcuterie
(delicatessen). Because we lived in
a commercial district, shopping
was no problem.
The neighborhood was quiet,
and although we were in the
center of Paris in the summertime,
we saw few tourists.
And even though we only
stayed five weeks, we weren't
tourists. The shopkeepers began
to know us, and we began to
glimpse what la vie parisienne is
really like.

began to look more and more
attractive.
The hunt for our apartment
began. We declined to use the
services of a temporary rental
agency, because the finding fees
and deposits were high. We called
several phone numbers listed in
the Herald Tribune and found
that most landlords, who usually
spoke fluent English, wanted to
rent for more than five weeks.
One listing, located in a
fashionable arrondissement
(neighborhood), sounded good.
We called. Thirty minutes later we
were on the Rue de Passy. We
soon discovered that it was not
the address of the apartment, but
of the owner's office.
The landlord was a
transplanted Moroccan — short,
dark-skinned, wearing a
tight-fitting shirt and carefully
combed back hair. He ushered us
into his Alfa Romeo and, darting
through Parisian traffic, whisked
us off to the apartment.
We inspected the two
bedrooms, kitchen and bath with
inexperienced eyes. We admired
the heavy ceiling ornamentation,
vaguely reminiscent of plaster of
paris, and gazed out the large
French windows in the three
principal rooms.
But we laughed at the

"pre-whore" dining room table
with its heavy, carved, gold-leafed
legs and matching red-plush
high-backed chairs. They might
have been shipped straight from
the Place Pigalle, the "red-light"
district of Paris.
Our landlord was so casual
about rental arrangements that we
feared that the red lampshades in
the salon might have some sinister
meaning. Within 30 minutes he
rented the place to us, requiring
no deposit and not charging us for
utilities.
But it didn't take us long to
discover that our suspicions were
unfounded and that red
lampshades were merely a
fashionable furniture item in the
neighborhood. The apartment
proved to be very convenient,
except for the peering eyes of the
concierge (the resident caretaker
of the building) who appeared
baffled by our array of American
guests.
We learned of the frustrations
of apartment living as well as of
the joys of Paris. Our oven didn't
work, but we solved the cooking
problem by buying delicious
meats, quiche (a cheese pie), and
salads at the local charcuterie
(delicatessen). Because we lived in
a commercial district, shopping
was no problem.
The neighborhood was quiet,
and although we were in the
center of Paris in the summertime,
we saw few tourists.
And even though we only
stayed five weeks, we weren't
tourists. The shopkeepers began
to know us, and we began to
glimpse what la vie parisienne is
really like.
We arrived at Charles De Gaulle
airport on a humid July morning.
And we had no idea of where we
would stay in Paris.
My friend and I checked into a
hotel. And as our room bills
mounted, the apartment
advertisements in the
International Herald Tribune
began to look more and more
attractive.
