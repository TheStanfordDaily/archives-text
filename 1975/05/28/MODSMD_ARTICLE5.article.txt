## Living in the Latin Quarter: Crepes, crowds and curiosities of the doorstep 
### CHRIS GARWOOD 
If you had spent five
weeks in an apartment in the
fashionable Passy district of
Paris, the names of apartment
designers Hector Guimard
and August Perret might be
the first to spring to your
mind when you think of
France.
But if your lodgings were
located in the bustling Latin
Quarter, the rustling of
crowds and the odors of a
nearby creperie might be the
first things you'd remember.
Apartments in Paris are
neither inexpensive nor easy
to find at any time of year.
But the experiences of these
students indicate that the
hunt is worthwhile.

After two weeks of searching, my friend and I
found a studio apartment in the heart of the Latin
Quarter, perhaps the liveliest district in Paris.
Our apartment was on the Rue de La Harpe
which is just off the Place St. Michel, but closed to
traffic. Where the Rue de la Harpe crosses the Rue
de la Huchette, one finds the core of the colorful
Latin Quarter.
From the apartment on the fifth floor we
looked over the rooftops of the Conciergerie to our
left and the dome of the Pantheon on the right.
Down in the street hundreds of people swarmed -
students, street people and tourists — 24 hours a
day.
On the corner to the left was a patisserie (pastry
shop) which, along with two others on the street,
served 10 or 20 different kinds of crepes. The
crepes were cooked on cast iron plates operated in
small stands along the sidewalks.
The crepes became our tradition: at 10:30 on
Saturday nights when the streets — lined with

Arabic and Chinese restaurants, night clubs and
cinemas — were crowded with people, we would
sneak down and grab a crepe made with butter,
powdered sugar, and a half-cup of Grand Marnier
cognac.
Two blocks away was St. Severain, the oldest
Gothic church on the left bank of the Seine. String
concerts were held there on Sunday afternoons.
Around the corner was the Boulevard St. Michel,
stretching up from the Seine and lined with
bookstores, clothing stores, cafes and newsstands.
The Rue de la Harpe was its own small
neighborhood. We came to know its particular
streets, people and buildings — its character.
Yet we were within walking distance of many
interesting places, and from the nearby Metro
(subway) stop we could journey anywhere in Paris
within 20 minutes.
We paid close to $300 per month for our fully
equipped and carpeted apartment. But while we
lived there during winter quarter Paris was truly at
our doorstep.
