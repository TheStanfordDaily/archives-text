# There's more to the vineyards than grapes
## Pig's blood for breakfast, politics at dinner, and wine... 
### MARK DAVIS 
The alarm rings at 6:15 a.m., soon to be
followed by the tinny sound of a cheap
record player churning out some Breton
accordian music by Georges Cattermole.
By 8 a.m. we'll be out picking grapes in
Bouille-Loretz, France.
The town is situated in the department
of Deux-Sevrcs, about halfway between
Tours and Bordeaux, and everyone who
lives there goes out into the fields during
October to harvest the grapes that will
become a wine called Cabernet d'Anjou.
Eight hours a day, six days a week, I
participated in this combination of
back-breaking work and festivity known as
les vendanges.
Work All Day
The workers come from all over France
and some, like myself, from even farther.
On the farm where I worked there were
about five workers from the town itself.
The farmer and his wife, Monsieur and
Madame Diguet, worked all day - harder
than anyone else. Bastard, a neighbor who
works for the Diguets year round, had
worked in the vineyards for 40 years and is
blessed with a tireless back apparently
made of rubber.
A young couple from next door worked
too; he was a 23-year-old unemployed
mechanic and she, a year younger, was
seven months pregnant with her third
child. An older couple, both over 60,
rounded out the local work contingent.
The family also hired a young village girl
to cook. She was 16 and several months
pregnant, but soon to be married. She told
me that although she was bitter that the
school authorities would not let her finish

high school, she was ready to get married.
Besides, such an age is not young for a
bride in that area.
Vineyard Characters
The out-of-towners were quite a bunch.
Guy, a one-armed Breton and owner of the
record player, personified my stereotype of
an Irishman. Happy-go-lucky and easily
angered, he stole every free instant to hop
on his moby/ette (a small motorcycle) to
go visit his sister who lived in a nearby
community.
Jacques, a chef and truck-driver from
Ardin, exemplified the true French coquin
(part man-of-the-world, part clown). He
had a story for every situation and a knack
for biting double entendres that he always
tempered with an infectious giggle. He
constantly teased the young cook about
her weight problem. He had come for
laughs, he said, and that's what he
supplied.
Honore, unemployed and 60, had spent
five years in a German POW camp and later
drifted around for years doing odd jobs all
over France. He muttered, said very little,
and slept a great deal. A hard worker, he
just seemed pleased to have a month of
good food, wine, and something to do.
Dialect Dilemma
And me, I'd never lived away from a
city and had never worked so hard. Each of
the out-of-town workers spoke a different
dialect and the family spoke yet a fourth.
When they all started spinning talcs at
dinner or in the fields, my college French
and city idioms just couldn't quite cope.
Each morning the tractor would take us
to the fields. Two to a row, wc would start
snipping the bunches of grapes with our
squeaky hand clippers. As the bunches
filled our buckets, wc would dump them
into the large basket carried on the back of
the sturdiest worker, who would then carry
the 150 pounds of grapes to the flat-bed
behind the tractor. He would either dump
them into the flat-bed or pour them into a

sieve fitted over a large barrel.
A worker (sometimes me) would then
force the grapes through the sieve and
thereby separate the grapes from the stems.
We would fill the flat-bed two or three
times a day. When full, it was taken back
to the farm and was emptied into the press
â€” the modern replacement for purple feet.
We interspersed the exhausting work
with gossip and stories about who was to
marry whom, who was going to have a
good crop, whose over-90 grandmother or
grandfather was the most active (they had
all worked in the fields into their 80s), or
what was eaten at the last feast or marriage
banquet.
Food, Wine, Talk
Eating, drinking and talking dominated
our limited leisure time, jacques, Guy,

Honore, and I lived in a small addition to
the farmhouse but ate all of our meals with
the family. The huge and delicious meals
were scenes of relaxation, laughter and
expression of incredibly conservative
political views. Among other things, we ate
rabbit, pig's blood (a lumpy ketchup-like
concoction eaten at breakfast), cow thymus,
pig's ears, and several other unidentified
things that tasted very good.
Oh yes, the wine. Breakfast, lunch, after
work, dinner, and in the fields on hot days
- wine was available at all of these times.
The villagers even added it to their soup. I
avoided it at breakfast as I didn't want to
cut my fingers while working.
The wine was unlimited but nobody got
drunk, except for the last day, because
they all knew that there would always be
more.


'Les Vendanges' provide a harvest of grapes and good cheer
