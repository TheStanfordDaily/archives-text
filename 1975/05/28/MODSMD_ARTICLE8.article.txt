# Hollywood's two-hour transglobal tour
## Universal City 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Last summer I traveled around the
world without ever leaving Los Angeles
A pink and white striped bus with a
fringed su rev-like top was my mode of
transpon:at on. It was more than
accomm* d iting. When charged by run. Wav
trains the bus escaped without a scratcn.
Wher lane slides took us by surprise the
bus <Jrov otf unscathed. And when
crossim. T< Red Sea. we didn't hive any
engine trouble.
Bu ru vorld I saw last summei "om
the hottes' corners of the South Pacific to
the snowv seaports of eastern Russia — v
a peculiar sort. All the trees were petrifie i.
all the oceans seven feet deep all t c
buildings hollow, and - better vet
transglobal tour lasted two hours.
You say impossible?
I sav, "Welcome to Universal Studios.
My name is Betty, and I'll be your
guide. .. .' I must have said it 200 times.
Universal Studios — located in the heart
of Universal City — is the place whe-e
herds of unsuspecting tourists flock to see
movie stars, lights, cameras and, mo e
importantly, action. Instead, in iho pit v
and wnr.e striped buses, they are whizzed

past tired eld movie sets; whirled around
large, heavily guarded sound stages; and
rushed b\ dressing rooms that bear
impressive nameplates.
They are shown t world created
bv tin. greaiest illusionists around movie
maker-. And, t- . Universal Studios tour
guide I felt personally responsible for
tvstroying come of those precious movie
i msions th oeopie so dearh treasure.
It was vho ruined some of the fun
people hav vvher watching Telly Savalas,
as ''Ko|ak, roam his beat the toughest
■•.tree*' of ev- Yorl City I ooinled out
w version of New York Cilv,
'Nev V'tn Street.' wher Savalas • as
susceptible to danger as the television
audience is.
It reallv hurts to show people Marcus
Welbv's house nothing bui a one-sided
wood facade on "Colonial Street" (two
houses dov n from the family home in The
\lunsters).When little children ask me how
Dr. Welby ;eeps his lawn sc nice and fresh,
I must tc' 1 them that it's because it's been
sprav-painted green.
The wild west isn't any better. The
rugged br ck walls on comer saloon? are
nothing bi foam rubber so studio stunt

men don't get a headache when slammed
against them). Rustic dirt roads are merely
camouflages for concrete ones underneath
(so an old mining town may be quickly
transformed into a modern city). And
perhaps most disillusioning is the size of
the buildings themselves — all scaled down
to seven-eighths the size of normal ones in
order to make even a 5-4 cowboy appear
tall, tough and terrifying.

When Ernest Borgnine rolled across the
Pacific Ocean in his sturdy PT boat in
McHule's Navy he was really drifting on
top of a pond in the middle of the studio
christened "McHalc's Ocean" (the pond
once was used as the Mississippi River in
the original version of Showboat).
Touring the world three times a day can
be an exciting cxpericnce, but someday, I'd
like to see the real one.

I must tc' 1 them that it's because it's been
sprav-painted green.

perhaps most disillusioning is the size of

to seven-eighths the size of normal ones in
order to make even a 5-4 cowboy appear
tall, tough and terrifying.

When Ernest Borgnine rolled across the
Pacific Ocean in his sturdy PT boat in

A pink and white striped bus with a
