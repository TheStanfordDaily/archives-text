# Discover an isle where mushrooms are 'magic'
## 
### STEVE HEFTER 
If ever a world could dance and
sing, if ever a world could breathe
an air of simple brilliance, if ever
there could be an island of
enchanting paradise, then Bali is
more than a dream. Bali, one of
some 13,600 islands in the
Indonesian archipelago, is an
island of magical and mystical
wonderment.
Around the skirts of Bali's
volcanoes, rice paddies are
patterned like intricate lace.
Along the coast, the
crescent-shaped beaches are
fringed with coconut palms and
the south sea tides rush over the
bright red coral onto beaches of
powder-white sand.
In essence, Bali can not be told
in words or even described in
pictures — it is an experience
which must be lived. Bali is really
more than just an island; it is a
way of life.
Two million natives live on
Bali, and their daily lives are
interwoven with a happy, natural
religion. Hinduism in Bali is a
mixture of Hinduism and
Buddhism, overlaid with elements
of the islanders' original
nature-worship.
Bali-Hindu worshippers revere
one supreme god who appears in
many manifestations. There arc
gods and goddesses for each
village, each crop and each house.
Faith Customs
Evidence of this faith is seen in
the thatched pagodas built near
every home to frighten away the
evil spirits. Walls arc erected to
thwart evil spirits who cannot
turn corners.
On an island only 80 miles long
and 50 miles wide, there arc over
10,000 temples. These temples
have tall, slender altars, simply
styled or carved ornately and
colored in red and gold. They are
used for daily offerings.
When those who have never
been there think of Bali, they
envision the famous traditional
Balincse dancers with the jeweled
headdresses, wide gold necklaces
and bracelets around wrists and
ankles. These legendary dancers
arc actually tcenaged girls who
perform dances that tell religious
or mystical stories, usually of
simple contests between good and

evil, in which good always
triumphs.
One such dance is the Legone
where princess Rangkesari is
carried off by the bad prince
Lascm, who is eventually killed as
good prevails. The story is acted
out to full-throated gamelan
music, the dancers moving as if
their bodies were boneless.
Spiritual Scene
The dances are performed by
the members of different villages
solely as a spiritual endeavor for
their own appreciation. They are
presented in the evening, when
the streets are silent, save for the
sound of the wind and the waves.
The arts of Bali abound in the
mountain village of Übud; women
bathe nude in mountain streams;
children carry stacks of batik
clothing cn their heads;
woodcarvers chisel away for days
on a religious sculpture of the
barong, a mythical masked lion
who is the guardian of god.
just north of Übud, I saw my
first Balinesc festival. Villagers
paraded through the streets in
outfits of every color, carrying
fruits, flowers and parasols.
There was dancing gamelan
music and a fire. But it wasn't just
any fire, it wasn't just any

celebration; a young man had died
and this was his cremation.
According to Hindu
philosophy, death liberates the
soul, which enters a new life or
becomes reincarnated.
Another Balincse rite is the
tooth-filling ceremony. When
boys and girls reach puberty, their
teeth are filed in order to ward off

the six evil qualities in human
nature — laziness, indifference,
irrcsolutcness, love of wordly
goods, sensual pleasure, love of
luxury and splendor.
While native women with deft
fingers weave and plait coconut
palm leaves into decorations for
offerings, visiting Canadians or
Australians may enjoy mushroom

omelettes in garden restaurants
before a relaxing day by the
beach. The mushrooms, many
claim, are magic — but so is the
island.
As former Indian Prime
Minister Jawahrlal Nehru once
said, "Bali is the morning of the
world." It is a morning which
must be lived.
