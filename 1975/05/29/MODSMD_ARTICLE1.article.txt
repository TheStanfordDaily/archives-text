# Seven In ROTC Off Campus
## 
### ELIZABETH POLLOCK 
Seven Stanford sophomores,
including two women, are preparing to
enroll in the Army ROTC program at
the University of Santa Clara, but they
will not receive academic credit from
Stanford for their work.
President Richard Lyman
announced the students' intention to
the Faculty Senate last Thursday to
allay any suspicions that the
administration is trying to bring back
ROTC secretly, according to Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig.
"In view of those suspicions it
seemed better to announce it
publicly," Rosenzweig said.
He emphasized, "The whole
premise of the thing is that the
students are making individual
decisions." A student wishing to take
ROTC is "no different from a student
going to Santa Clara to take a course
in sociology" for no credit, he
claimed.
After undergoing summer training,
the ROTC students will attend one
hour of class per week and four hours
per month of outdoor drills in skills
such as compass use. ROTC students
are eligible for scholarships and receive
commissions in the Army upon
graduation.
The students' interest was nurtured
by Robert Barker, graduate student in
applied physics, who canvassed the
current sophomore class's interest in
military training in March 1974 and
contacted the 117 students who
indicated interest in taking ROTC
courses.
Barker spent four years in Air
Force ROTC, terming it "an
outstanding program." He claimed that
"the circumstances under which
Stanford ousted ROTC [in the early
19705] were gross."
In a letter to Brig. Gen. Sinclair
Melner, commander of the fourth
ROTC region at Fort Lewis, Wash.,
Lyman wrote, "I am impressed by the
willingness of these students to enter
an ROTC program at no little
inconvenience to themselves."
Lyman also wrote, "Since there is
no University policy here which
restricts the participation of Stanford
students in programs at other
institutions, I am writing to record my
endorsement of the indicated
arrangements."
Although a tripartite agreement
must be reached between Santa Clara,
the Army and Stanford, Rosenzweig
said, "There aren't any administrative
details to be overcome at Stanford." If
the two other parties can agree, the
Stanford students could enroll in basic
training this summer, he added.
Barker, however, claimed "there are
a lot of 'ifs'" still present in the
negotiations. He is seeking to smooth
the reintroduction of the ROTC
option through a Stanford Committee
on ROTC.
Actual reinstatement of ROTC at
Stanford, Rosenzweig said, was "a
long, long way away" because "the
bases on which the faculty acted [to
phase out ROTC]" still exist.

long, long way away" because "the
bases on which the faculty acted [to
phase out ROTC]" still exist.
Seven Stanford sophomores,
including two women, are preparing to
enroll in the Army ROTC program at
the University of Santa Clara, but they
will not receive academic credit from
Stanford for their work.
President Richard Lyman
announced the students' intention to
the Faculty Senate last Thursday to
allay any suspicions that the
administration is trying to bring back
ROTC secretly, according to Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig.
"In view of those suspicions it
seemed better to announce it
publicly," Rosenzweig said.
He emphasized, "The whole
premise of the thing is that the
students are making individual
decisions." A student wishing to take
ROTC is "no different from a student
going to Santa Clara to take a course
in sociology" for no credit, he
claimed.
After undergoing summer training,
the ROTC students will attend one
hour of class per week and four hours
per month of outdoor drills in skills
such as compass use. ROTC students
are eligible for scholarships and receive
commissions in the Army upon
graduation.
The students' interest was nurtured
by Robert Barker, graduate student in
applied physics, who canvassed the
current sophomore class's interest in
military training in March 1974 and
contacted the 117 students who
indicated interest in taking ROTC
courses.
Barker spent four years in Air
Force ROTC, terming it "an
outstanding program." He claimed that
"the circumstances under which
Stanford ousted ROTC [in the early
19705] were gross."
In a letter to Brig. Gen. Sinclair
Melner, commander of the fourth
ROTC region at Fort Lewis, Wash.,
Lyman wrote, "I am impressed by the
willingness of these students to enter
an ROTC program at no little
inconvenience to themselves."
Lyman also wrote, "Since there is
no University policy here which
restricts the participation of Stanford
students in programs at other
institutions, I am writing to record my
endorsement of the indicated
arrangements."
Although a tripartite agreement
must be reached between Santa Clara,
the Army and Stanford, Rosenzweig
said, "There aren't any administrative
details to be overcome at Stanford." If
the two other parties can agree, the
Stanford students could enroll in basic
training this summer, he added.
Barker, however, claimed "there are
a lot of 'ifs'" still present in the
negotiations. He is seeking to smooth
the reintroduction of the ROTC
option through a Stanford Committee
on ROTC.
Actual reinstatement of ROTC at
Stanford, Rosenzweig said, was "a
long, long way away" because "the
bases on which the faculty acted [to
phase out ROTC]" still exist.
