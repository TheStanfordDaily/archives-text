# Debunking Oil Mythology

### 
In his column on the oil situation (Daily, May
23), Paul Atkinson argues that we face a serious
long-term problem in obtaining oil because the
supply of oil is limited and because current prices
may have a destructive impact on the
international monetary system.
First, almost all resources are limited and
scarce. To say that oil is limited in supply is to
say that it shares a quality possessed by all
economic goods. The market is quite capable of
allocating an exhaustible resource like petroleum
between present and future consumption.
Perhaps Atkinson is worried by data he has
seen on known reserves. Such reserves are not all
the oil there is left in the world; they are simply
the shelf inventory of the oil industry.
There are costs to prospecting for oil. All the
discoveries which will eventually be economically
worthwhile have not been made now, any more
than one could say 60 years ago that all the oil
there was had been located.
In 1908, David T. Day, the director of the
petroleum division of the U.S. Geological Survey,
said that there were between 10 and 25 billion
barrels of recoverable oil in the United States. In
1915, petroleum engineer Ralph Arnold forecast
reserves of eight billion barrels, a prediction with
which the U.S. Geological Survey agreed.
Based upon the rates of consumption at that
time, all the oil in the United States would have
been gone in 20 years. Here was a seemingly
serious situation that in reality was not serious at

all, any more than the present oil situation is.
In a recent survey of world oil, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology economist Morris
Adelman noted in fact that new discoveries and
potential production have been keeping abreast of
consumption.
Second, Atkinson is worried about the possible
effects of current oil prices on present world
monetary arrangements. Edward J. Mitchell and
Weitze Eizenga argue persuasively in the June
1974 Economic Quarterly Review that there is no
reason to assume that the oil producing countries
will not act like other countries and business
corporations that have an important interest in
the maintenance of efficient currency markets.
During the summer 1973 change in the relative
values of currencies, the evidence shows that the
oil exporting governments behaved no differently
from the large international corporations and
other large holders of currencies. The various
fears of some commentators about the effects of
petrodollars have proved illusory.
Atkinson's two arguments for the policies
advocated by the Ford Administration and much
of the oil industry do not survive scrutiny. The
Ford program of placing a floor under the price
of oil and cutting oil imports is both
counterproductive and an intrusion on economic
liberty. It will raise prices, diminish the supply of
available oil and foster increased cartellization.

During the summer 1973 change in the relative
values of currencies, the evidence shows that the
oil exporting governments behaved no differently
from the large international corporations and
other large holders of currencies. The various
fears of some commentators about the effects of
petrodollars have proved illusory.
Atkinson's two arguments for the policies
advocated by the Ford Administration and much
of the oil industry do not survive scrutiny. The
Ford program of placing a floor under the price
of oil and cutting oil imports is both
counterproductive and an intrusion on economic
liberty. It will raise prices, diminish the supply of
available oil and foster increased cartellization.

In his column on the oil situation (Daily, May
23), Paul Atkinson argues that we face a serious
long-term problem in obtaining oil because the
supply of oil is limited and because current prices
may have a destructive impact on the
international monetary system.
First, almost all resources are limited and
scarce. To say that oil is limited in supply is to
say that it shares a quality possessed by all
economic goods. The market is quite capable of
allocating an exhaustible resource like petroleum
between present and future consumption.
Perhaps Atkinson is worried by data he has
seen on known reserves. Such reserves are not all
the oil there is left in the world; they are simply
the shelf inventory of the oil industry.
There are costs to prospecting for oil. All the
discoveries which will eventually be economically
worthwhile have not been made now, any more
than one could say 60 years ago that all the oil
there was had been located.
In 1908, David T. Day, the director of the
petroleum division of the U.S. Geological Survey,
said that there were between 10 and 25 billion
barrels of recoverable oil in the United States. In
1915, petroleum engineer Ralph Arnold forecast
reserves of eight billion barrels, a prediction with
which the U.S. Geological Survey agreed.
Based upon the rates of consumption at that
time, all the oil in the United States would have
been gone in 20 years. Here was a seemingly
serious situation that in reality was not serious at

all, any more than the present oil situation is.
In a recent survey of world oil, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology economist Morris
Adelman noted in fact that new discoveries and
potential production have been keeping abreast of
consumption.
Second, Atkinson is worried about the possible
effects of current oil prices on present world
monetary arrangements. Edward J. Mitchell and
Weitze Eizenga argue persuasively in the June
1974 Economic Quarterly Review that there is no
reason to assume that the oil producing countries
will not act like other countries and business
corporations that have an important interest in
the maintenance of efficient currency markets.
