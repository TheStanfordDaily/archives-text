# ARC And The 'White Man's Burden'
## 
### 
This year's still unresolved controversy
over financial aid grants and self-help
requirements for Third World students has
highlighted an interesting and intriguing
aspect of today's "radical" movement.
Since the earliest recommendations by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids (C-UAFA)
that members of minority groups be
required to earn or repay a greater amount
of financial aid during freshman year, a
loosely-knit coalition of campus groups has
quite justifiably demonstrated in
opposition, and has won some, although not
many, concessions.
Concerned minority students formed
Students for Equity (SFE) in an early effort
to protest the changes, and the local white
radical organization, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), quickly jumped on
the minority aid bandwagon.
Although there is nothing necessarily
wrong with white people protesting in
minority causes, well-intentioned white
people have historically hindered or even
destroyed movements for racial solidarity or
rights. This year, ARC could easily have
done the same.
Increasing Doubts
Several members of SFE have expressed
increasing doubts in recent weeks over
ARC's role in the minority aid protest. The
comments have ranged from one chicana's
assertion that "They [ARC members] are
idiots. They just want to protest anything
they can," to a black student's more somber
reflection that "Their hearts are in the right
place, at least."
ARC's role in SFE's original vigil on the
steps of the Old Union left ill feeling among
at least a few SFE members. While there
seems no clear idea as to what went on, at

least one version of the story is that no one
from ARC even knew about the vigil until
it was underway, and that ARC members
joined in wholeheartedly before bothering
to find out what the vigil was about.
One girl claims that an ARC member,
after joining the protest, asked her what
SFE was protesting. Another somewhat
more plausible story is that several ARC
members asked what C-UAFA was.

The point, of course, is not that ARC
had no business joining in the vigil. But in
order to keep a measure of credibility any
radical or revolutionary' organization must
take care to avoid the charge that it favors
protest as an end in itself, regardless of the
cause. Unfortunately, ARC seems to foster
just such feelings — even among those the
organization is trying to help.
But then, that is precisely the excuse
that white liberals — or radicals — have
traditionally given when, acting in what
they consider the best interests of
"oppressed people," they have hopelessly
fouled things up: "We were only trying to
help."
ARC Under Fire
For example, ARC has come under fire
for the organization of the May 13 rally
during the Board of Trustees' meeting.
Some SFE members have privately

complained that although the rally
purported to discuss, among other issues,
minority aid, no minorities were involved in
organization.
This does not, of course, prove overt
racism, any more than the failure of the
Daily to consult the Third World
community before running a special section
on minority problems would prove it.
Nor does that particular failing prove
that the rally was somehow wrong or evil.
One might wonder why ARC members
chose to reintroduce an issue which, as one
SFE member put it, "was already in the
negotiation stage," and only ask for de
facto endorsement of the rally plans. But, as
another SFE member pointed out, "It was
their rally."
Who Controls?
Which, of course, it was. White
individuals and organizations, once to seem
fashionably liberal, more recently to seem
fashionably radical, have consistently taken
minority issues to heart — only to take
them, perhaps use them and ultimately try
to control them.
In these enlightened times, one would
think that the "Great White Father"
concept was passe. But ARC, like other
more or less well-intentioned people before,
has seen fit once again to take up "The
White Man's Burden" — or perhaps, what
we should more accurately label "The White
Movement's Burden."
Because when all is said and done,
despite whatever sympathies for Third
World causes they may have, whites
traditionally have felt, albeit
subconsciously, that they can run the causes
better. And there's a word for that.

more plausible story is that several ARC
members asked what C-UAFA was.

The point, of course, is not that ARC
had no business joining in the vigil. But in
order to keep a measure of credibility any
radical or revolutionary' organization must
take care to avoid the charge that it favors
protest as an end in itself, regardless of the
cause. Unfortunately, ARC seems to foster
just such feelings — even among those the
organization is trying to help.
But then, that is precisely the excuse
that white liberals — or radicals — have
traditionally given when, acting in what
they consider the best interests of
"oppressed people," they have hopelessly
fouled things up: "We were only trying to
help."
ARC Under Fire
For example, ARC has come under fire
for the organization of the May 13 rally
during the Board of Trustees' meeting.
Some SFE members have privately

complained that although the rally
purported to discuss, among other issues,
minority aid, no minorities were involved in
organization.
This does not, of course, prove overt
racism, any more than the failure of the
Daily to consult the Third World
community before running a special section
on minority problems would prove it.
Nor does that particular failing prove
that the rally was somehow wrong or evil.
One might wonder why ARC members
chose to reintroduce an issue which, as one
SFE member put it, "was already in the
negotiation stage," and only ask for de
facto endorsement of the rally plans. But, as
another SFE member pointed out, "It was
their rally."
Who Controls?
Which, of course, it was. White
individuals and organizations, once to seem
fashionably liberal, more recently to seem
fashionably radical, have consistently taken
minority issues to heart — only to take
them, perhaps use them and ultimately try
to control them.
In these enlightened times, one would
think that the "Great White Father"
concept was passe. But ARC, like other
more or less well-intentioned people before,
has seen fit once again to take up "The
White Man's Burden" — or perhaps, what
we should more accurately label "The White
Movement's Burden."
Because when all is said and done,
despite whatever sympathies for Third
World causes they may have, whites
traditionally have felt, albeit
subconsciously, that they can run the causes
better. And there's a word for that.

This year's still unresolved controversy
over financial aid grants and self-help
requirements for Third World students has
highlighted an interesting and intriguing
aspect of today's "radical" movement.
Since the earliest recommendations by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids (C-UAFA)
that members of minority groups be
required to earn or repay a greater amount
of financial aid during freshman year, a
loosely-knit coalition of campus groups has
quite justifiably demonstrated in
opposition, and has won some, although not
many, concessions.
Concerned minority students formed
Students for Equity (SFE) in an early effort
to protest the changes, and the local white
radical organization, the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), quickly jumped on
the minority aid bandwagon.
Although there is nothing necessarily
wrong with white people protesting in
minority causes, well-intentioned white
people have historically hindered or even
destroyed movements for racial solidarity or
rights. This year, ARC could easily have
done the same.
Increasing Doubts
Several members of SFE have expressed
increasing doubts in recent weeks over
ARC's role in the minority aid protest. The
comments have ranged from one chicana's
assertion that "They [ARC members] are
idiots. They just want to protest anything
they can," to a black student's more somber
reflection that "Their hearts are in the right
place, at least."
ARC's role in SFE's original vigil on the
steps of the Old Union left ill feeling among
at least a few SFE members. While there
seems no clear idea as to what went on, at

least one version of the story is that no one
from ARC even knew about the vigil until
it was underway, and that ARC members
joined in wholeheartedly before bothering
to find out what the vigil was about.
One girl claims that an ARC member,
after joining the protest, asked her what
SFE was protesting. Another somewhat
more plausible story is that several ARC
members asked what C-UAFA was.

The point, of course, is not that ARC
had no business joining in the vigil. But in
order to keep a measure of credibility any
