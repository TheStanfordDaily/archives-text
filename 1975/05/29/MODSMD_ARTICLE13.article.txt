# Why We Protest D.P.M.
## 
### 
II Og/efree, et 01. II
Many of the graduating
students take issue with the
selection of Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as our
commencement speaker. We also
feel that the seriousness of our
disagreement with his selection
demands that we voice our
opposition to it.
Those of us who feel a
responsibility to speak out
against Moynihan, and the subtle
racism which he represents, have
decided to protest his
appearance at our graduation
ceremony. Our intent is not to
disrupt his speech, nor to shock
or otherwise disrespect anyone.
We respect Moynihan's "right
of free speech." it is this same
inalienable right which we plan
to exercise through our protest
on graduation day.
Opposition Basis
Our opposition to Moynihan
is based on his record as an
adviser to three presidents.
Through his two most famous
statements on black America,
The Negro Family and the
"Benign Neglect" memorandum,
Moynihan has provided the
rhetoric to justify the racist
attitude that black people are
the cause of the problems that
plague our communities.
To ignore the effects of
slavery, poverty and the
innumerable manifestations of
racism, and to place the blame
on the oppressed, can only lead
us to an incorrect analysis of the
situation. The future of America
depends upon our arriving at a
more truthful insight on the race
question.
Honoring Moynihan
Stanford University, in
choosing Moynihan to speak, has
chosen to honor him. We
strongly question the priorities
of a University that chooses to
align itself with Moynihan, that
is home base for the
white-supremacist crusade of
William Shockley, heavily invests
in multi-national corporations
that continuously exploit Third
World countries and threatens to
eliminate financial aid to its
minority students.
We have therefore decided to
demonstrate our dissatisfaction
with the appearance of
Moynihan, the symbol of racism
veiled in eloquence, at our
commencement. We sincerely
hope that the controversy
generated by his appearance, and
our actions, will aid in the free
exchange of ideas upon which
any free society must depend.
