# The 						Story On Vietnam Humanitarian Aid Votes
## 
### 
There are better things to do
than enter into a political debate
between Daily contributor Herb
Borock and my press secretary,
Bill Johnson. When Borock uses
deliberate misrepresentations
(Daily, May 20), however, as
well as partial quotes
out-of-context, it seems
necessary to reply, if only to
support the integrity of a fine
Stanford student (Johnson), if
not my own.

When I say Borock has
misrepresented the facts, I do so
offering him the fair
opportunity for him to come
forward and defend his position
in this same forum.
In his article, Borock quoted
Johnson's May 16 statement:
"McCloskey offered an
amendment that would prevent
President Ford from using any
military force to evacuate
Vietnamese citizens from South

Vietnam.... His amendment was
rejected and he voted against the
bill."
Then Borock states: "That
statement is not true. McCloskey
offered no such amendment . . .
and voted against the peace
forces on the most important
vote on the bill."
What actually happened? I
did offer an amendment on
April 22, to delete the authority
for military power to evacuate
South Vietnamese.
At page H3133 of the
Congressional Record for April
22, under the title
"Amendments" appears the
following:
"By Mr. McCloskey: At page
2, strike all of line 3 down
through and including line 3 cn
page 3 of the bill."
In effect my amendment
deleted Sections 3 and 4 of the
seven-section bill, those giving
President Ford authority to use
force.
Before my amendment could
be voted upon, it was effectively
superseded by the amendment
of Rep. Chuck Whalen (R-Ohio)
which deleted only Section 3 of
the bill, the section which
exempted the President from the
restrictions of the War Powers
Act as well as from previous
limitations on bombing of both
North and South Vietnam. As a
member of the committee
bringing the bill to the floor,
Whalen was entitled to be
recognized first and he was.
The debate on the
amendment was extensive, and it
ultimately lost by a vote of 262
to 151. It would have been
superfluous to have asked for a
second vote on my own
amendment which went even
further thrrn the Whalen
Amendment. The key argument
of those opposing the

amendment was that President
Ford, unlike his predecessor,
would not use the powers
granted to him. I had argued
against this point earlier in the
day; my full speech (printed at
page H3139) was as follows:
"MR. McCLOSKEY. Mr.
Speaker, 1 will vote for the
humanitarian aid today of $150
million, but there is one part of
this act which I think we should
reconsider. The issue is not one
of seeking to assist refugees. We
owe our best efforts to try to
save as many lives as we can of
those who have relied on us.
"The question is, do we
authorize use of military force? I
want to call the attention of the
Members to the fact that as an
ex-Marine, the gentleman from
Indiana who preceded me in the
well and I were privileged to
fight in Korea. If the Members
should ask me as a Marine
commander or as President of
the United States what was the
minimum use of necessary force
I might use to save one Marine's
life, I would tell them that /
would probably authorize the
use of B-52 bombers and
whatever other military force
might be necessary to save a
Marine of this country
(emphasis added].
"If we put Marines into
combat in Vietnam, we have
delegated to the Commander in
Chief the power to use B-52's, to
use the minimum force
necessary to save Marines and
protect against any Marines
being taken as prisoners of war,
with all that that entails.
"Mr. Speaker, I am glad to
vote for humanitarian aid. I do
not think we should delegate to
the President the ability to again
land Marines on the Asian
continent."
Please note the italicized

Pefe McCloskey

portion which was the sole
excerpt Borock quoted. Borock
manages to convey an
impression exactly opposite to
that I was attempting to argue
on the House floor.
This is a despicable tactic in
any debate.
Borock cites my vote against
the amendment by Rep. Helen
Meyner (D-N.J.) as "the most
important vote on the bill,"
from the standpoint of "the
peace forces." This is absurd.
The Meyner amendment had
nothing to do with the grant of
force. It provided simply that
the humanitarian aid to the
South -Vietnamese refugees
would be administered by the
U.N. or international or private
voluntary agencies.
1 thought the amendment

*

naive as well as foolish. The U.N.
had already refused to become
involved in the evacuation and
there was no chance that any
other international or volunteer
agency was going to send
representatives to Saigon at this
late date.
While it is entirely
appropriate for Borock to make
the political arguments he does
— that I should be retired from
Congress — his mixing of
argument with deliberate
untruths and misleading partial
quotes represents the worst kind
of political hatchet job.
