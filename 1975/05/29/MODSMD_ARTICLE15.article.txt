## It's Called Senior Panic' 
### TERRY ANZUR BETTY GOODWIN 
I'm taking 20 units — five
courses — and I'm trying to get a
j0b.... I feel very pressured. I've
gone through four years of
college and I'm worried that I'm
going to end up in a secretarial
job.
Senior panic means different
things to different seniors.
To one senior "it's the time
when couples have to split up,
time to decide whether it's
serious or whether it's not."
To others it's a time of
leaving friends and traditions
behind. "I eat dinner every night
with the same people. I'll
probably never see most of the
people who sit at my table ever
again," said one senior.
It's also a time of unanswered
questions about life on the
Stanford farm: "I read that the
new basketball coach has signed
three top prospects for next year
and I won't even get to see them
play. Questions about who the
next ASSU presidents are,
whether Mike Cordova will play
quarterback, the housing
situation — they're all tiny

reminders that weVe leaving," a
senior lamented.
Reluctance to leave Stanford
behind has always been a major
component of senior panic. But
this year, seniors are more
apprehensive of the world they
are soon to enter. And they have
reason to fear that the working
world is not willing or able to
absorb their talents.
May Madness
"You panic around May 1
when you have no job offers
whatsoever, no summer job,
nothing," one senior said. "I
hadn't the faintest idea of where
I would be living [after
graduation] how I would
support myself, where I would
put my stuff. I had a feeling I'd
cease to exist in just six weeks."
For some, job offers begin to
trickle in. For others, "the panic
drifts into despair."
And despair is what finally
prompts some to enter the
building they've passed hundreds
of times on the way to the Quad
— the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
There, panicked seniors meet
Margot Baker and ask, "What do

you do here? I understand you
can get me a job."
Baker, director of liberal arts
job placement, says 29 seniors
opened files at the placement
center last week. "By now
they've lost a lot of time.
Ideally, they should come in
early in the year, but if it
happens now it's better than if it
doesn't ever happen at all," she
points out.
Why do some wait so long?
"There has been a lot of news
about how bad the economy is,"
Baker says."And people who
are already predisposed to do
things at the last minute get
paralyzed. They fret a lot, but
they don't know anything
constructive to do about it.
They get a defeatist outlook."
No Skills?
Diane-Louise Wormley,
Baker's assistant, spends a lot of
time calming seniors. Liberal arts
students who fear they have no
skills are classic cases of senior
panic, she says,"and unless they
were economics majors or took
computer science classes, I have
to agree with them."
Many students also fear that

their summer and part-time job
experience won't help them
qualify for interesting work
when they graduate.
"I try to get them to calm
down by accentuating the
positive aspects of what they've
done and talking about their
immediate problems," Wormley
says.
For the student who comes in
early in the academic year, the
initial contact is the beginning of
a five-week counseling process in
which students assess their
interests and goals and learn that
job-hunting is hard work.
The negative reinforcement
of repeated rejection doesn't
make it any easier. Those
dreaded letters have different
names: at CPPC they're "ding
letters," at the law school they're
"bullets," and to at least one
senior they're "fuck-yous."
According to Wormley, the
lucky student finds a job in two
months; the not-so-lucky
"average" students must persist
for about four months.
Under 'Contract'
Because successful job
hunting requires long-term

directed effort, Wormley asks
students to draw up "time
contracts," pledging to spend
specific amounts of time
preparing a resume, arranging for
interviews.
"There's no question of the
advantages of getting known
around the Placement Center,"
she adds. When a former
congressman suddenly decided
to hire several students, he asked
CPPC personnel to recommend
qualified candidates. "We don't
like to do a screening process,
but nine of 10 people we

recommend are people we
know," Wormley says.
But what about the students
who wait until the last minute?
"It means suppressing five weeks
of counseling into two hours,"
Wormley says.
One such last-minute
compression will occur at a
job-hunting clinic scheduled for
Monday, June 2,1 to 5:30 p.m.,
Tresidder 270. "We'll provide an
overview of job hunting and the
mindset of being successful,
brainstorm ways of finding job
leads, hold resume workshops

and mock interviews," Baker
says.
Armed with these skills,
students might be better
prepared to face what one senior
called, "the realization that it's
all coming to an end. For the
first time in 16 years we won't
be taking up our days going to
classes. It's not just a summer
job. This time, you've got to
make it work."

"Bug Me" will appear on page
four of tomorrow's Daily.
