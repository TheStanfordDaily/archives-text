# New Saigon Elite Emerges
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
SAIGON — baggy trousers.
Shirts bleached colorless from
repeated washings.
Skin sallow from jungle
living. Cheeks hollow from
sparse rations.
These strangers came to
Saigon April 30. At first glance
they seemed out of place among
the well-fed citizenry of the city.
But a cocky air of assurance
belied their humble appearance.
They are South Vietnam's
new elite — the conquering
communist soldiers and officials
of the Viet Cong and North
Vietnam.
Here To Stay
They had dwelled in the
backyards of South Vietnam for
a generation. Then they came in
through the front door of
Saigon's Independence Palace,
and they are here to stay.
Watching a dozen women
militia in faded khaki pajamas
walk by his home in single file
one day, a habit they probably
picked up during the war, a
former senior South Vietnamese
Foreign Ministry official said,

"The proletariat are here now.
We are all proletariat now."
He was required to share his
government home with eight
North Vietnamese troops.
The soldiers were "very
deferential to my wife and I" he
said, but were conspiring with
his maid of many years to leave
his employment. "They tell her
that a maid's work is
demeaning," he said. "They
think that under their society
everyone can be free."
Message
The revolutionary message is
being preached to thousands of
maid servants and others because
soldiers have permeated
throughout the big cities of
South Vietnam.
A "cohabitation" policy has
placed military men and officials
in every second or third house in
many blocks of Saigon and other
cities, and it serves three
purposes.
Not only does it solve the
billeting problem, but it is an
effective deterent to rebellion of

any obvious kind. Almost
anywhere you go in Saigon
today there are soldiers, maybe
lazily washing clothes on the
balcony of a former U.S. AID
apartment, playing with a dog in
an alley or riding bicycles.
Propoganda Tool
The presence of these
veterans is an effective
propaganda tool. Street corner
rallies with the newly resident
soldiers are now a common
occurrence in Saigon, with
children and adults clapping to
revolutionary slogans.
The dozens of communist
soldiers and officials this
reporter met in the 25 days he
spent in occupied Saigon
declined alcoholic drinks, even
though many seemed addicted
to smoking. They also seemed
well armed against the
temptations of the flesh, often
comradely holding hands with
each other as they strolled down
the city streets, as did South
Vietnamese soldiers, but never
being seen in any way intimate
with the pretty girls of the city.

Propoganda Tool
The presence of these
veterans is an effective
propaganda tool. Street corner
rallies with the newly resident
soldiers are now a common
occurrence in Saigon, with
children and adults clapping to
revolutionary slogans.
The dozens of communist
soldiers and officials this
reporter met in the 25 days he
spent in occupied Saigon
declined alcoholic drinks, even
though many seemed addicted
to smoking. They also seemed
well armed against the
temptations of the flesh, often
comradely holding hands with
each other as they strolled down
the city streets, as did South
Vietnamese soldiers, but never
being seen in any way intimate
with the pretty girls of the city.
From the Associated Press
SAIGON — baggy trousers.
Shirts bleached colorless from
repeated washings.
Skin sallow from jungle
living. Cheeks hollow from
sparse rations.
These strangers came to
Saigon April 30. At first glance
they seemed out of place among
the well-fed citizenry of the city.
But a cocky air of assurance
belied their humble appearance.
They are South Vietnam's
new elite — the conquering
communist soldiers and officials
of the Viet Cong and North
Vietnam.
Here To Stay
They had dwelled in the
backyards of South Vietnam for
a generation. Then they came in
through the front door of
Saigon's Independence Palace,
and they are here to stay.
Watching a dozen women
militia in faded khaki pajamas
walk by his home in single file
one day, a habit they probably
picked up during the war, a
former senior South Vietnamese
Foreign Ministry official said,

"The proletariat are here now.
We are all proletariat now."
He was required to share his
government home with eight
North Vietnamese troops.
The soldiers were "very
deferential to my wife and I" he
said, but were conspiring with
his maid of many years to leave
his employment. "They tell her
that a maid's work is
demeaning," he said. "They
think that under their society
everyone can be free."
Message
The revolutionary message is
being preached to thousands of
maid servants and others because
soldiers have permeated
throughout the big cities of
South Vietnam.
A "cohabitation" policy has
placed military men and officials
in every second or third house in
many blocks of Saigon and other
cities, and it serves three
purposes.
Not only does it solve the
billeting problem, but it is an
effective deterent to rebellion of

any obvious kind. Almost
anywhere you go in Saigon
today there are soldiers, maybe
lazily washing clothes on the
balcony of a former U.S. AID
apartment, playing with a dog in
an alley or riding bicycles.
