# Budget Cuts Threaten EDP's
## 
### KATHY CUNNINGHAM Third of Four Parts 
In spite of recent calls for
more out-of-the-classroom
curricula to make education
more "relevant," trends at
Stanford seem to be pointing in
the opposite direction. While
some have suggested
para-academic programs as a way
of attracting students
disenchanted with the less
practical aspects of a university
education, belt-tightening
measures have prompted
discussions of phasing out
extra-departmental programs
EDP's such as SWOPSI and
SCIRE.
At the same time, however,
new ideas and recommendations
for credit for experiences and
externships continue to sprout
up like weeds around campus.
"It's a mixed bag at Stanford,"
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Alan Strain explains.
As early as 1971. John Black,
director of research for the
Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs, recommended that the
University develop more field
work or independent programs
away from campus. "Such field
work should carry unit credit
and include appropriate reading,
and/or writing requirements," he
said.
He suggested that programs
like Stanford-in-Washington and
other government internships be
expanded and awarded credit.
Through these programs,
students could graduate in four
years and still take time off to
work, study or travel, But while
Black's proposal for credited
government internships has not
yet been adopted, other projects
have.
Credit for IVA?
Assoc. International Studies
Director Ronald Herring is in the
final stages of developing a plan
for granting credit for the
Volunteers-in-Asia (VIA) program.
He hopes to link the off-campus
activity in Asia to the
preparatory instruction and to
integrate both with academic .

activity when the student
returns.
Presently VIA students
receive partial credit for the
preliminary language instruction,
cross-cultural orientation and
technical direction for the
teaching job they will hold
overseas. Herring says he is
working on an evaluation
process to measure students'
language progress overseas.
He asserts that if VIA
becomes an academic as well as a
living experience, students will
consider preparation more
important, will take their tenure
overseas more seriously and will
probably do a better job. He also
claims that students who would
not ordinarily participate
because of financial pressure to
finish school before another
tuition hike, would be more
inclined to apply to VIA under
his proposal.
Other Models
Asst. Overseas Studies
Director S. Corbin Smith says
the VIA credit-granting model
may be used to set up other
programs, and that Overseas
Studies could eventually include
"VISTA or Peace Corps-like"
programs. Smith says he is

optimistic that students who
want to travel, study or live
abroad on an individual, but
faculty-supervised basis, will
someday be able to receive
credit through the Overseas
Studies program.
Strain, who organized and
now directs Project Synergy, is
working on a plan to give
students credit for working on a
mobile unit helping communities
with city planning and
low-impact technology
development. Now in just the
formative stages, the plan would
be a community-based extension
of the current Synergy project,
he says. It would involve a
link-up with college students
from southern Oregon, but
could accommodate only 10
students at a time.
But at the same time these
new plans are being formulated,
already existing programs which
offer practical,
out-of-the- classroom work may
be phased out or eventually
incorporated into regular
academic departments as a
cost-saving measure.
Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs maintains
that the merger of the most

popular of these EDP's SWOPSI,
with regular academic programs,
will not mark the end of the
program. But defenders of an
"independent" SWOPSI argue
that it will be transformed
beyond recognition if Gibbs's
plan goes through.
Money-Saving Move?
SWOPSI Director Andrew
Parnes questions whether the
move will save
estimating that such a change
would cost the University
$300,000 yearly. Gibbs has said
the University can save $25,000
by making the change. Despite
denials from Gibbs, many charge
that the proposed merger is
motivated by reasons other than
economic.
SWOPSI's sibling, SCIRE,
which Director Alice Supton
says is designed to fill curricular
gaps, also appears threatened by
Stanford's effort to trim $10
million from its $70 million
yearly central operating budget
over the next 10 years.
