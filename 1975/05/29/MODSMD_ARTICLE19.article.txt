# Class Officers Discuss Year
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
In spite of intense protest*
over this year's commencement
speaker and changes in the
commencement ceremony, the
senior class officers feel that
they accomplished quite a oil
and that their experience was
worthwhile.
Senior Class President Lise
Pfeiffer described her mediating
between the administration and
seniors on the commencement
problems as the "most difficult
and frustrating" part of her job.
Pfeiffer said that it was
troublesome and time
consuming "working with the
administration trying to find the
best possible solution" for the
Moynihan protest and the grad
uation ceremony change and
determining why the students are
so upset.
"We [the senior class
officers] are always caught in
the middle. I hope that
criticisms are constructive rather
than picking us apart," she said.
The senior class fund was
about $2100 for this year.
Pfeiffer explained "the money

was spent for the happy hours
($BO to $100 each), printing the
newsletters, publicity signs and
for paint and materials. We also
have to pay for Class Day
entirely. It will cost us about
$500i'rom the fund to pay for
sound equipment and other
expenses. We hope to get seniors
to help set'up the chairs."
The class fund must also pay
out approximately $500 for the
Class of '75 time capsule.
60 Seniors
Pfeiffer stated that this year
she has been the student
member on the Alumni
Executive Board. "One of the
things we did was a
career-exposure program. About
60 seniors visited alumni for half
a day to learn about various
occupations, especially in
business and law.
"1 also gave input on how
students look at the alumni and
what the alumni can do for
you," she said.
Referring to the alumni
association's practice of getting
seniors to join the association by
writing the seniors' parents,
Pfeiffer said that she "suggested
that they write students directly
instead of their parents when
asking them to join."
Pfeiffer discussed this year s
six traditional senior class happy
hours, saying "It was frustrating
when people didn't volunteer to
help organize them."
'No Hassle'
But senior class officer Jim
Dewell, who ran the happy
hours, stated, "There really was
no hassle in running them."
Dewell thought that the most
difficult problem this year was
"the misunderstanding over the
way the commencement speaker
was chosen." Besides that, "it
was all straight forward and fun
getting people to help in
activities," Dewell said.
Pfeiffer said that senior class
officer Susie Schatzman "has
been filling in and also running
the Class Day program (on June
14), which includes a catered
lunch for about 2500 seniors

and parents. This includes
handling the books for this."
The senior class officers have
mailed to seniors three
newsletters concerning happy
hours, suggestions for the
commencement and Class Day
speakers, and graduation
information.
The officers also helped to
sponsor the May 8 teach-in on

the scholarship of
commencement speaker Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
Pfeiffer said that the senior
class rummage sale, scheduled
for this week, "was canceled
because people backec out and
didn't support it." A dance for
seniors was also canceled
because of lack of senior
support.
