# Krogh Recalls White House Days
## Life On Nixon's Team 
### KATHY BATTS Last Of Two Parts 
Except tor four weeks in July ar d
Augusi, 1971, when he was supervising
the break-in at the office of Dr. Lev/is
Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist,
Egil (Bud) Krogh Jr. says he spent
little time with former President
Richard Nixon's political appointees —
with Lite exception of his boss, John
Ehrlichman.
In an interview earlier this week,
Krogh, who will begin work later this
year as a legislative assistant to Rep.
Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), called
Ehrlichman "a very demanding person
to work for." He said Nixon's
domestic affairs adviser insisted that
work be done promptly and
intelligently.
Krogh also had worked for
Ehrlichman's Seattle law firm of
Hullin, Ehrlichman, Roberts and
Hodge for four months after his
graduation from University of
Washington Law School.
"In Washington, [Ehrlichman]
would arrive at the office every
morning at exactly 6:55. We had our
first meeting at 7:30 a.m. He was the
same way at the law firm," Krogh said,
stopping to laugh. "1 think if we had
all arrived a little later and left the
office a little earlier, we wouldn't have
gotten into so much trouble."
Krogh says he hasn't spoken to

Ehrlichman in a year and 10 months.
"Our views on national security were
very different. We assessed what was at
stake differently."
Little Contact
While on the White House's
domestic staff, Krogh says he had little
contact with Nixon. "He was
preoccupied with international
relations. It was hard to get his
attention on domestic affairs."
He says this caused some
resentment among the staff. "I talked
to him somewhat when I was working
on narcotics control. But that's
because it had international
connotations.
"However, for better or worse, he
knew my name."
Praise For Nixon
Krogh did praise some of Nixon's
domestic ideas, such as revenue sharing
and the opening of the highway trust
fund to mass transit.
"But he knew he would be known
for his foreign relations work," he
says. "So he spent the most time on
that."
Krogh assesses Nixon as a man of
great intelligence and a good memory.
"But he never forgave anyone who
crossed him. His desire for revenge and
his passion for secrecy resulted in his
downfall.
"Nixon equated Ellsberg with Alger
Hiss. He saw him as an enemy. He had

a practice of loosely defining people,
labeling them as enemies and traitors.
The irony is that some of us are now
being labeled."
Krogh learned a lot about labeling
when he got out of the Allenwood,
Pa., prison farm last year after serving
four-and-a-half months.
"You try everything you can to
correct a terrible mistake," he says.
"It's hard."
Egalitarian Prison
In prison, he was treated the same
as anyone else, he says. "There's a
completely egalitarian society there.
The guards bend over backwards to
show no favoritism. It doesn't make
any difference if it's white collar or
blue collar crime."
Krogh was placed in a
maximum-security jail in Rockville,
Md. for 10 days before being
transferred to Allenwood. "It was a
good experience. I met a lot of diverse
people accused of diverse crimes —
rape, murder, kidnapping. It gave me a
lot of help in learning to react to
different prisoners. You learn to
understand the code.
"Prisoners really have a passionate
feeling against what they call snitches
— those who sell out to save their own
skin. That's why they couldn't put
John Dean in a regular prison."
