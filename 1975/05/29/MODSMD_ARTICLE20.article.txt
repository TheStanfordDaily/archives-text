WASHINGTON (AP) -
Eighteen percent fewer new
college graduates are being hired
this year, and the job market for
them may not pick up until next
spring, according to a survey
released Tuesday.
The College Placement
Council said responses from 709
employers showed that the
decline was sharpest for
engineers and Ph. D.'s.
Opportunities remain strong
for top students, minorities and
women in high-demand fields,
however, the report said. i
The decrease was the first i
overall general decline in hiring
of college graduates since :
1969-70 and 1970-71, the
council said, although the 18
percent drop was not as severe as
the 27 percent plummet during
the 1970-71 season.
The council, representing
college placement directors and
career planners across the

country, surveyed business,
industry. government, and
non-profit and education
institutions, excluding teaching
positions.
The only employers hiring
more than last year were
petroleum, up four percent;
local and state governments, up
18 percent; and nonprofit and
educational institutions, up
seven percent. The council said
the volume of hirings in those
categories was low, however.
"Judging from their
comments, employers do not
expect appreciable improvement
in hiring until possibly next
spring," the council said.
"Many said there is little
necessity to do much recruiting
because of an available supply of
experienced individuals and
recent college graduates, coupled
with reduced turnover and
internal reallocation of
personnel."
