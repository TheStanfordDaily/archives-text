Hard to believe but
we're finally approaching
the end, and the activities
are becoming limited.
But would we leave you
high and dry (as if you
were the latter)?
Certainly not.
This week's best bet
for the sake of sheer
interest is the KQED
Auction, which begins
Friday at 4 p.m. on
Channel 9 and runs for a
week. The auction will
feature (get this) a day
on the set of "The
Streets of San Francisco"
with the right to be an
extra, dinner for four at
Francis Ford Coppola's
home, a 24 square foot
television screen, the
right to conduct the
Stanford Band and a
variety of other crazy
things.
All proceeds go to
benefit the listener
supported PBS station. If
you see something you
like, just phone in and
bid on it. The process is
so simple, even a
Stanford administrator...
well, you get the idea.
(Just kidding, folks.)
If you prefer watching
show biz in person, try
the Drama Department's
productions of The
Tempest in Memorial
Auditorium and Spring's
Awakening, at the
Nitery, through
Saturday.
On Saturday night in
the Little Theater,
undergraduates Doug
Witkins and Jacque
Honore will direct Late
Expectations and The
Exchange, plays written
by each, respectively.
Admission is free and
we'll guarantee that
you'll get more than you
pay for.
If you haven't had

your fill of comedy and
vulgarity all rolled into
one, try Redd Foxx at
the Circle Star Theater
through Sunday. We'll
warn you that his
language is much more
explicit than Fred
Sanford's.
Just to prove that we
don't always overlook
the culture for the korn,
let us urge you to see The
Stanford Opera Theater
productions of Poulenc's
The Breasts of Tiresias
and Rossini's The
Marriage Broker," in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
through Saturday.
For more contempo
rary music on campus,
the Stanford Wind
Ensemble in its final
concert this year will
play 20th Century
marches and folk songs
Sunday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. This is hot
air that you should listen
to.
Speaking of hot air,
we've been accused in
recent weeks of spouting
off to the point where
we've ignored movies.
Let us redeem ourselves.
Tommy, complete with
four channel sound, is
finally in the area at the
Menlo; Breakout, with
Charles Bronson,is at the
Altos; and Mandigo,
starring the entire "Old
South,"is at the Park.
Finally, for a film that
does, watch "Creature
Feature's" screening of
Night Star, Goddess or
Electra (1964), beginning
at 10 p.m. Saturday on
Channel 2. This film
features "beautiful
zombies and weird
happenings," according
to a press release. Senior
class officers deny that it
has any relation to the
upcoming commence
ment exercises.

happenings," according
to a press release. Senior
class officers deny that it
has any relation to the
upcoming commence
ment exercises.
Hard to believe but
we're finally approaching
the end, and the activities
are becoming limited.
But would we leave you
high and dry (as if you
were the latter)?
Certainly not.
This week's best bet
for the sake of sheer
interest is the KQED
Auction, which begins
Friday at 4 p.m. on
Channel 9 and runs for a
week. The auction will
feature (get this) a day
on the set of "The
Streets of San Francisco"
with the right to be an
extra, dinner for four at
Francis Ford Coppola's
home, a 24 square foot
television screen, the
right to conduct the
Stanford Band and a
variety of other crazy
things.
All proceeds go to
benefit the listener
supported PBS station. If
you see something you
like, just phone in and
bid on it. The process is
so simple, even a
Stanford administrator...
well, you get the idea.
(Just kidding, folks.)
If you prefer watching
show biz in person, try
the Drama Department's
productions of The
Tempest in Memorial
Auditorium and Spring's
Awakening, at the
Nitery, through
Saturday.
On Saturday night in
the Little Theater,
undergraduates Doug
Witkins and Jacque
Honore will direct Late
Expectations and The
Exchange, plays written
by each, respectively.
Admission is free and
we'll guarantee that
you'll get more than you
pay for.
If you haven't had

your fill of comedy and
vulgarity all rolled into
one, try Redd Foxx at
the Circle Star Theater
through Sunday. We'll
warn you that his
language is much more
explicit than Fred
Sanford's.
Just to prove that we
don't always overlook
the culture for the korn,
let us urge you to see The
Stanford Opera Theater
productions of Poulenc's
The Breasts of Tiresias
and Rossini's The
Marriage Broker," in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
through Saturday.
For more contempo
rary music on campus,
the Stanford Wind
Ensemble in its final
concert this year will
play 20th Century
marches and folk songs
Sunday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. This is hot
air that you should listen
to.
Speaking of hot air,
we've been accused in
recent weeks of spouting
off to the point where
we've ignored movies.
Let us redeem ourselves.
Tommy, complete with
four channel sound, is
finally in the area at the
Menlo; Breakout, with
Charles Bronson,is at the
Altos; and Mandigo,
starring the entire "Old
South,"is at the Park.
Finally, for a film that
does, watch "Creature
Feature's" screening of
Night Star, Goddess or
Electra (1964), beginning
at 10 p.m. Saturday on
Channel 2. This film
features "beautiful
zombies and weird
happenings," according
to a press release. Senior
class officers deny that it
has any relation to the
upcoming commence
ment exercises.
