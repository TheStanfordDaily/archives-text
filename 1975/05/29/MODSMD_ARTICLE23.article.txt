Ever since Fender-Rhodes
came out with an electric piano
that was more piano than organ,
keyboard people have been
trying to find a way to make the
electric piano sound like an
instrument rather than a
gimmick.
Well, at least the musicians
among them have.
Bob James is a musician who

plays the electric piano as
though it were an instrument.
And that's not all. He is a jazz
pianist, composer, arranger and
theoretician as well. His two
albums (appropriately entitled
One and Two) are valid proof.
One is the first major album
Bob James has done. He has
played background piano for
Maynard Ferguson, Hubert
Laws, Grover Washington Jr.,
Stanley Turrentine, Hank
Crawford, Ron Carter, Eric Gale,
Johnny Hammond and Gabor
Zsabor (to name a few) and put
out a couple albums on minor
lables. It is a masterful album
that reflects James's desire to
merge jazz and classical music.
Ironically, the most widely
popular cut is the one least
representative of that objective.
James played background for

Roberta Flack in her original of
"Feel Like Making Love" and
liked the song so well he decided
to use the same musicians for an
instrumental on his own album.
The result is a stunningly
beautiful arrangement. And a
fine display of James's own
keyboard talents.
Moussorgsky's "Night On
Bald Mountain" is the most
powerful of the other songs.
Performing a song that could
have been written by a jazz or
pop composer today, James uses
the heavy rhythm of Steve Gadd
on drums to build a complex

integration of several different
kinds of orchestrations and
jazz-rock motifs.
One also contains three James
compositions based upon
classical pieces. The longest,
"Valley of the Shadows," is
totally original and almost
free-form in its final form, but
based upon a carefully
structured composition.
Early this year Two appeared.
It isn't an extension of Jameses
first album. But it is equally
masterful.
Again James rearranged a
popular song — Paul Simon's
"Take Me To The Mardi Gras"-
and enhanced it without

destroying it. And again James
displays his talents as a jazz
arranger and electric pianist. A
second cut, "You're As Right As
Rain," was made in slightly the
same vain as "Feel Like Making
Love."
But in Two, James does not
go to the classical/jazz way as
much as he goes off on his own.
The songs are all sophisticated
and intricate, with blending
harmonies and orchestrations.
One of the cuts, "Farandole,"
is based on a classical piece
(Bizet's "L'Arlesienne Suite No.
2"), but the two original James
compositions show both the
classical influence and his owt,
distinctive touch. "Dream
Journey" is the best of the two,
although it has less pianc
improvisation.
"The Golden Apple" is weird,
but somehow pleasing at t'.ie
same time. If there is a flaw in
Two it is the incorporation of a
vocal cut (and solo) "1 Feel A
Song (In My Heart)." The
arrangement is excellent, but
vocals on albums featuring
instrumental excellence are
distracting in most cases. This is
one of them.
Bob James has put out two
albums, and no two of the songs
are similar. Remarkable? Not
entirely. But one gets the feeling
it will be a long, long time
before this pianist starts
repeating himself.

One and Two) are valid proof.
One is the first major album
Bob James has done. He has
played background piano for
Maynard Ferguson, Hubert
Laws, Grover Washington Jr.,
Stanley Turrentine, Hank
Crawford, Ron Carter, Eric Gale,
Johnny Hammond and Gabor
Zsabor (to name a few) and put
out a couple albums on minor
lables. It is a masterful album
that reflects James's desire to
merge jazz and classical music.
Ironically, the most widely
popular cut is the one least
representative of that objective.
James played background for

Roberta Flack in her original of
"Feel Like Making Love" and
liked the song so well he decided
to use the same musicians for an
instrumental on his own album.
The result is a stunningly
beautiful arrangement. And a
fine display of James's own
keyboard talents.
Moussorgsky's "Night On
Bald Mountain" is the most
powerful of the other songs.
Performing a song that could
have been written by a jazz or
pop composer today, James uses
the heavy rhythm of Steve Gadd
on drums to build a complex

integration of several different
kinds of orchestrations and
jazz-rock motifs.
One also contains three James
compositions based upon
classical pieces. The longest,
"Valley of the Shadows," is
totally original and almost
free-form in its final form, but
based upon a carefully
structured composition.
Early this year Two appeared.
It isn't an extension of Jameses
first album. But it is equally
masterful.
Again James rearranged a
popular song — Paul Simon's
"Take Me To The Mardi Gras"-
and enhanced it without

destroying it. And again James
displays his talents as a jazz
arranger and electric pianist. A
second cut, "You're As Right As
Rain," was made in slightly the
same vain as "Feel Like Making
Love."
But in Two, James does not
go to the classical/jazz way as
much as he goes off on his own.
The songs are all sophisticated
and intricate, with blending
harmonies and orchestrations.
One of the cuts, "Farandole,"
is based on a classical piece
(Bizet's "L'Arlesienne Suite No.
2"), but the two original James
compositions show both the
classical influence and his owt,
distinctive touch. "Dream
Journey" is the best of the two,
although it has less pianc
improvisation.
"The Golden Apple" is weird,
but somehow pleasing at t'.ie
same time. If there is a flaw in
Two it is the incorporation of a
vocal cut (and solo) "1 Feel A
Song (In My Heart)." The
arrangement is excellent, but
vocals on albums featuring
instrumental excellence are
distracting in most cases. This is
one of them.
Bob James has put out two
albums, and no two of the songs
are similar. Remarkable? Not
entirely. But one gets the feeling
it will be a long, long time
before this pianist starts
repeating himself.
