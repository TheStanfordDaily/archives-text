# 'Bullshot Crummond': Carefree
## THEATER 
### JANICE L. ROSS 
Occasionally it's nice to see a
performance that doesn't profess
to have any social, political or
moral message. It's refreshing to
just sit and observe without
worrying, caring or thinking.
Bullshot Crummond, the Low
Moan Spectacular's newest show
at the Hippodrome Theatre in
Sf:; Francisco,is the ideal trifling
farce. Based on the British Bull
Dog Drummond detective
novels, Bullshot is a clever
parody of second-rate detectives

and third-rate spies.
The hero, Captain Hugh
Crummond is, by his own
admission, so dumb that 'if he

solves any cases or wins any
battles it's by sheer luck."
The teutonic villains, Otto
Von Brunno and his mistress
Lenya are the classic
incorrigibles. Powered by greed,
lust, hatred and revenge, they
conspire to steal the good
Professor Fenton's secret
formula and thereby rule the
world.
What transpires in the course
of the play is no mystery, and it
doesn't take a sleuth to realize
how it all will end. But what is

entertaining is the urbane style
and droll humor of the delivery.
Contrary to other modes, in
this theatrical piece the play is
not the thing. The performance
is.
Bullshot works because it is
an original, slick and
intentionally histrionic approach
to effete detective spoofs. By
employing gimmicks culled from
vaudeville, comedy reviews,
silent films, comics and musical
spectaculars, the five
actor-writers have managed to
put together a raillery that,
although lacking the incisive wit
of Noliere or Feyeadeu, is not
wholly without conscience.
On one level Bullshot is pure
kitsch. The simulated airplane
crashes, car chases, sea battles
and falcon fights are clearly
derived from Hollywood circa
1930. And the obvious cliched,
lines like, "Remember the
double-edged sword of fate has
more than one side," or "Dash
it! If you weren't a girl you'd

have made a jolly fellow! " are
accompanied by snatches of
melodramatic mood music
guaranteed to provoke a laugh.
Not only the props, but the
cast too excelled. The Art Deco
set was amazingly versatile with
sliding panels for quick scene
changes and secret
compartments for hasty
disappearances.
In one unforgettable scene,the
heavy-accented Von Brunno,
expertly played by Ron House,
engages in an angry shouting
match and eventually a
knock-down drag-out fight with
a stoop-shouldered little New
York mobster takes place.
This sequence is exceptional
because House plays both
characters, making split-second
costume, posture, makeup and
accent changes by briefly
crossing behind a small screen
onstage. The other four cast
members were equally adroit at
masquerade and hoax,
especially Mark Blankfield who
was credited with seven different
character portrayals ranging
from the professer to Marovitch,
the Hun's half-wit henchman.
No, Bullshot Crummond isn't
serious, profound or even
topical. It doesn't offer any new
insights or reveal any recondite
truths. But what it does do is to
give audiences an enjoyable and
uproarious evening, and this it
does very, very well.
Bullshot Crummond plays at
8:30 p.m. Tuesdays through
Thursdays and at 8 and 10
Fridays and Saturdays, and at
7:30 p.m. Sundays at the
Hippodrome Theatre, 412
Broadway in S.F.
