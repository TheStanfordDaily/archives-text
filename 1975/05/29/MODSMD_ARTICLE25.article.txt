Doctors End Malpractice Strike
SACRAMENTO — California anesthesiologists,
after a month-long boycott over soaring
malpractice insurance rates that triggered
thousands of hospital layoffs, agreed yesterday to
return to work.
Surgeons and other doctors who supported the
strike indicated they would also be back on the
job.
Dr. Seymour Wallace, president of the California
Society of Anesthesiologists, said the physicians
were "returning to work in good faith . .. and will
stay on the job."
The agreement was reached after an insurance
pool was set up to write low-cost malpractice
coverage for the remainder of the year.
The walkout by anesthesiologists began May 1
in Northern California and spread to other parts of
the state after their malpractice insurance expired.
Argonaut Insurance Co., which covered most of
them, raised the rates as much as 400 percent to
more tnan $18,000 because of increased legal
action.
At one point nearly 350 of the state's 2000
anesthesiologists were on strike and some hospitals
closed entire floors and laid off thousands of
workers to cope with reduced patient loads.
Dr. Edward Zalta, a spokesman for boycotting
physicians in the Los Angeles area, said: "I would
say most physicians would return to work."
The agreement is contingent on a San Francisco
meeting tomorrow at which state Insurance
Commissioner Wesley Kinder will decide whether
to set up a pool to make insurance available at
affordable rates.
Defense: SLA Testimony Changed
SACRAMENTO — A defense attorney
compared the Marcus Foster murder trial to the
Sacco-Vanzetti case yesterday and claimed
witnesses had been pressured to change their
statements.
James Jenner, attorney for Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) member Russell Little, said
people who told police they saw blacks running
from the murder scene hedged in their testimony at
the trial.
Little and his codefendant, fellow SLA member
Joseph Remiro, are white.
"Pressure was placed by authorities on people to
make identifications," Jenner told the jury in his
closing argument. "Black became white.
"I think you will see parallels in this case" to
Sacco and Vanzetti, the balding assistant public

defender said.
Sacco and Vanzetti, Italian-born anarchists,
were executed a half century ago after their
controversial conviction in the shooting of a
payroll clerk.
Jenner is scheduled to finish his argument
today, giving the prosecution a chance for a final
rebuttal. The case is expected to go to the jury
tomorrow.
Remiro's attorney, Edward Merrill, told the jury
the prosecution was trying to show a "vague
conspiracy" without direct evidence connecting the
defendants to the cyanide-bullet killing.
"We're talking about guilt byassociation," Merrill
said. "Under our system of justice we don't have
guilt by association."
No prosecution witness could place either
defendant at the scene of the shooting on Nov. 6,
1973. But Alameda County Dist. Atty. Lowell
Jensen said both took part in a conspiracy to kill
Foster.
Merrill, the first defense lawyer to sum up his
case, said he wouldn't dispute police testimony
that a .380 Walther pistol owned by Remiro was
one of the guns that killed Foster.
"All right, that's the gun," the husky lawyer
said, holding it up to the jury.
"But do they say he wielded the gun? That he
bought the gun to kill Dr. Foster? Can they prove
he gave the gun to somebody and said, 'Hey, you,
go kill Dr. Foster?'
"Lending guns back and forth among this group
was common practice. There isn't any evidence or
any proof he used this gun or knew who used this
gun," Merrill said.
Merrill also said there was no proof that Remiro
had ever lived in a Concord house, where Jensen
says Foster's death was plotted.
Ford Reaffirms NATO Support
BRUSSELS, Belgium — President Ford told
America's European allies yesterday that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) remains the
cornerstone of American foreign policy.
Arriving for a North Atlantic summit meeting,
Ford stated, "I have come my NATO
colleagues and the people of Europe that our great
alliance remains strong and to guarantee that
vitality, we must vigorously address the problems
confronting us."
Ford said he also came to tell the allies "that the
United States is convinced that detente with the
East can only proceed on a foundation of strong
and secure alliance defenses, that NATO is the
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and has the

unwavering support of the American public and of
our Congress and that our commitment to this
alliance will not falter."
Ford's trip here was his first to Europe as
president, and a key mission was to steady a North
Atlantic alliance torn by internal troubles and
nervous about America's dependability.
African Nations Form Unit
LAGOS, Nigeria — Fifteen African leaders
signed a treaty yesterday creating the largest single
economic grouping in Africa — the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
The Lagos treaty — the latest by nonsuperpower
nations banding together for their mutual
economic benefit — linked nine French, five
English and one Portuguese-speaking countries with
a combined population of 124 million.
The agreement was signed by presidents and top
ministers of Dahomey, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau,
Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria,
Sierra Leone, Togo, Upper Volta, Mali, Guinea,
Senegal and Ghana.
The leaders said in a communique they hoped
for early ratificiation of the treaty by member
governments "so that the aims and objectives of
the community could be realized without delay."
Kissinger Offers Economic Ties
PARIS — Henry Kissinger offered the
industrialized world a plan yesterday to improve
economic links with underdeveloped countries and
told the rich nations their future stability depends
on it.
"An international system will be stable only as
long as its economic benefits are widely shared and
its arrangements are perceived as just," the U.S.
secretary of state told a ministerial meeting of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). OECD groups 24 major
non-communist industrial nations.
Reaction to the U.S. initiative among the rich
countries was generally favorable. French Foreign
Minister Jean Sauvagnargues said he thought views
within the OECD countries had grown much closer
on the subject.

industrialized world a plan yesterday to improve
economic links with underdeveloped countries and
told the rich nations their future stability depends
on it.
"An international system will be stable only as
long as its economic benefits are widely shared and
its arrangements are perceived as just," the U.S.
secretary of state told a ministerial meeting of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). OECD groups 24 major
non-communist industrial nations.
Reaction to the U.S. initiative among the rich
countries was generally favorable. French Foreign
Minister Jean Sauvagnargues said he thought views
within the OECD countries had grown much closer
on the subject.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with low clouds
along coast beginning tonight. Cooler tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the 50s to low 60s. Highs today in
the 80s to low 90s. Highs tomorrow in the 70s to
low 80s except upper 50s to low 60s along coast.
Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph through tomorrow
afternoon.
Doctors End Malpractice Strike
SACRAMENTO — California anesthesiologists,
after a month-long boycott over soaring
malpractice insurance rates that triggered
thousands of hospital layoffs, agreed yesterday to
return to work.
Surgeons and other doctors who supported the
strike indicated they would also be back on the
job.
Dr. Seymour Wallace, president of the California
Society of Anesthesiologists, said the physicians
were "returning to work in good faith . .. and will
stay on the job."
The agreement was reached after an insurance
pool was set up to write low-cost malpractice
coverage for the remainder of the year.
The walkout by anesthesiologists began May 1
in Northern California and spread to other parts of
the state after their malpractice insurance expired.
Argonaut Insurance Co., which covered most of
them, raised the rates as much as 400 percent to
more tnan $18,000 because of increased legal
action.
At one point nearly 350 of the state's 2000
anesthesiologists were on strike and some hospitals
closed entire floors and laid off thousands of
workers to cope with reduced patient loads.
Dr. Edward Zalta, a spokesman for boycotting
physicians in the Los Angeles area, said: "I would
say most physicians would return to work."
The agreement is contingent on a San Francisco
meeting tomorrow at which state Insurance
Commissioner Wesley Kinder will decide whether
to set up a pool to make insurance available at
affordable rates.
Defense: SLA Testimony Changed
SACRAMENTO — A defense attorney
compared the Marcus Foster murder trial to the
Sacco-Vanzetti case yesterday and claimed
witnesses had been pressured to change their
statements.
James Jenner, attorney for Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) member Russell Little, said
people who told police they saw blacks running
from the murder scene hedged in their testimony at
the trial.
Little and his codefendant, fellow SLA member
Joseph Remiro, are white.
"Pressure was placed by authorities on people to
make identifications," Jenner told the jury in his
closing argument. "Black became white.
"I think you will see parallels in this case" to
Sacco and Vanzetti, the balding assistant public

defender said.
Sacco and Vanzetti, Italian-born anarchists,
were executed a half century ago after their
controversial conviction in the shooting of a
payroll clerk.
Jenner is scheduled to finish his argument
today, giving the prosecution a chance for a final
rebuttal. The case is expected to go to the jury
tomorrow.
Remiro's attorney, Edward Merrill, told the jury
the prosecution was trying to show a "vague
conspiracy" without direct evidence connecting the
defendants to the cyanide-bullet killing.
"We're talking about guilt byassociation," Merrill
said. "Under our system of justice we don't have
guilt by association."
No prosecution witness could place either
defendant at the scene of the shooting on Nov. 6,
1973. But Alameda County Dist. Atty. Lowell
Jensen said both took part in a conspiracy to kill
Foster.
Merrill, the first defense lawyer to sum up his
case, said he wouldn't dispute police testimony
that a .380 Walther pistol owned by Remiro was
one of the guns that killed Foster.
"All right, that's the gun," the husky lawyer
said, holding it up to the jury.
"But do they say he wielded the gun? That he
bought the gun to kill Dr. Foster? Can they prove
he gave the gun to somebody and said, 'Hey, you,
go kill Dr. Foster?'
"Lending guns back and forth among this group
was common practice. There isn't any evidence or
any proof he used this gun or knew who used this
gun," Merrill said.
Merrill also said there was no proof that Remiro
had ever lived in a Concord house, where Jensen
says Foster's death was plotted.
Ford Reaffirms NATO Support
BRUSSELS, Belgium — President Ford told
America's European allies yesterday that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) remains the
cornerstone of American foreign policy.
Arriving for a North Atlantic summit meeting,
Ford stated, "I have come my NATO
colleagues and the people of Europe that our great
alliance remains strong and to guarantee that
vitality, we must vigorously address the problems
confronting us."
Ford said he also came to tell the allies "that the
United States is convinced that detente with the
East can only proceed on a foundation of strong
and secure alliance defenses, that NATO is the
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and has the

unwavering support of the American public and of
our Congress and that our commitment to this
alliance will not falter."
Ford's trip here was his first to Europe as
president, and a key mission was to steady a North
Atlantic alliance torn by internal troubles and
nervous about America's dependability.
African Nations Form Unit
LAGOS, Nigeria — Fifteen African leaders
signed a treaty yesterday creating the largest single
economic grouping in Africa — the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
The Lagos treaty — the latest by nonsuperpower
nations banding together for their mutual
economic benefit — linked nine French, five
English and one Portuguese-speaking countries with
a combined population of 124 million.
The agreement was signed by presidents and top
ministers of Dahomey, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau,
Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria,
Sierra Leone, Togo, Upper Volta, Mali, Guinea,
Senegal and Ghana.
The leaders said in a communique they hoped
for early ratificiation of the treaty by member
governments "so that the aims and objectives of
the community could be realized without delay."

African Nations Form Unit
LAGOS, Nigeria — Fifteen African leaders
signed a treaty yesterday creating the largest single
economic grouping in Africa — the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
The Lagos treaty — the latest by nonsuperpower
nations banding together for their mutual
economic benefit — linked nine French, five
English and one Portuguese-speaking countries with
a combined population of 124 million.
The agreement was signed by presidents and top
ministers of Dahomey, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau,
Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria,
Sierra Leone, Togo, Upper Volta, Mali, Guinea,
Senegal and Ghana.
The leaders said in a communique they hoped
for early ratificiation of the treaty by member
governments "so that the aims and objectives of
the community could be realized without delay."
Kissinger Offers Economic Ties
PARIS — Henry Kissinger offered the
industrialized world a plan yesterday to improve
economic links with underdeveloped countries and
told the rich nations their future stability depends
on it.
"An international system will be stable only as
long as its economic benefits are widely shared and
its arrangements are perceived as just," the U.S.
secretary of state told a ministerial meeting of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). OECD groups 24 major
non-communist industrial nations.
Reaction to the U.S. initiative among the rich
countries was generally favorable. French Foreign
Minister Jean Sauvagnargues said he thought views
within the OECD countries had grown much closer
on the subject.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with low clouds
along coast beginning tonight. Cooler tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the 50s to low 60s. Highs today in

Doctors End Malpractice Strike
SACRAMENTO — California anesthesiologists,
after a month-long boycott over soaring
malpractice insurance rates that triggered
thousands of hospital layoffs, agreed yesterday to
return to work.
Surgeons and other doctors who supported the
strike indicated they would also be back on the
job.
Dr. Seymour Wallace, president of the California
Society of Anesthesiologists, said the physicians
were "returning to work in good faith . .. and will
stay on the job."
The agreement was reached after an insurance
pool was set up to write low-cost malpractice
coverage for the remainder of the year.
The walkout by anesthesiologists began May 1
in Northern California and spread to other parts of
the state after their malpractice insurance expired.
Argonaut Insurance Co., which covered most of
them, raised the rates as much as 400 percent to
more tnan $18,000 because of increased legal
action.
At one point nearly 350 of the state's 2000
anesthesiologists were on strike and some hospitals
closed entire floors and laid off thousands of
workers to cope with reduced patient loads.
Dr. Edward Zalta, a spokesman for boycotting
physicians in the Los Angeles area, said: "I would
say most physicians would return to work."
The agreement is contingent on a San Francisco
meeting tomorrow at which state Insurance
Commissioner Wesley Kinder will decide whether
to set up a pool to make insurance available at
affordable rates.
Defense: SLA Testimony Changed
SACRAMENTO — A defense attorney
compared the Marcus Foster murder trial to the
Sacco-Vanzetti case yesterday and claimed
witnesses had been pressured to change their
statements.
James Jenner, attorney for Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) member Russell Little, said
people who told police they saw blacks running
from the murder scene hedged in their testimony at
the trial.
Little and his codefendant, fellow SLA member
Joseph Remiro, are white.
"Pressure was placed by authorities on people to
make identifications," Jenner told the jury in his
closing argument. "Black became white.
"I think you will see parallels in this case" to
Sacco and Vanzetti, the balding assistant public

defender said.
Sacco and Vanzetti, Italian-born anarchists,
were executed a half century ago after their
controversial conviction in the shooting of a
payroll clerk.
Jenner is scheduled to finish his argument
today, giving the prosecution a chance for a final
rebuttal. The case is expected to go to the jury
tomorrow.
Remiro's attorney, Edward Merrill, told the jury
the prosecution was trying to show a "vague
conspiracy" without direct evidence connecting the
defendants to the cyanide-bullet killing.
"We're talking about guilt byassociation," Merrill
said. "Under our system of justice we don't have
guilt by association."
No prosecution witness could place either
defendant at the scene of the shooting on Nov. 6,
1973. But Alameda County Dist. Atty. Lowell
Jensen said both took part in a conspiracy to kill
Foster.
Merrill, the first defense lawyer to sum up his
case, said he wouldn't dispute police testimony
that a .380 Walther pistol owned by Remiro was
one of the guns that killed Foster.
"All right, that's the gun," the husky lawyer
said, holding it up to the jury.
"But do they say he wielded the gun? That he
bought the gun to kill Dr. Foster? Can they prove
he gave the gun to somebody and said, 'Hey, you,
go kill Dr. Foster?'
"Lending guns back and forth among this group
was common practice. There isn't any evidence or
any proof he used this gun or knew who used this
gun," Merrill said.
Merrill also said there was no proof that Remiro
had ever lived in a Concord house, where Jensen
says Foster's death was plotted.
Ford Reaffirms NATO Support
BRUSSELS, Belgium — President Ford told
America's European allies yesterday that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) remains the
cornerstone of American foreign policy.
Arriving for a North Atlantic summit meeting,
Ford stated, "I have come my NATO
colleagues and the people of Europe that our great
alliance remains strong and to guarantee that
vitality, we must vigorously address the problems
confronting us."
Ford said he also came to tell the allies "that the
United States is convinced that detente with the
East can only proceed on a foundation of strong
and secure alliance defenses, that NATO is the
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and has the

unwavering support of the American public and of
our Congress and that our commitment to this
alliance will not falter."
