prosecution when he pleaded guilty.
The sentence from Judge Gerhard
Gesell was based strictly on his plea,
he says, and not on any bargains for
immunity.
"Once my plea was entered and
imprisonment had been accepted I was
mentally free from tension, fear and
doubt," he claims.
It was still hard for his family, he
says. He and his wife arrived at the
decision together and tried to explain
it to his boys aged five and nine.
"The nine-year-old was teased at
school for awhile," he says. "But his
friends rallied around him and soon
the others stopped giving him a hard
time. I think as they get older, they'll
understand why it happened."
After Krogh was released, he visited
Nixon."He wanted to know what legal
punishment meant," Krogh
remembers. "I told him facing the
legal issue gave me peace of mind."
Krogh was surprised, he says, when

Nixon was pardoned. "1 understand
that it was an act of mercy, but not an
act of justice." He shakes his head,
"But I could never see him in jail
anyway."
"The pardon eliminated his
(Nixon's] need to face the issue of
legal punishment. But the Judiciary
Committee did that for him. They
defined for him what acts were
beyond the reasonable realm of
presidential power.
"He still had to suffer immense
personal punishment. I think he's still
suffering."
The President would have been
better served, he claims, if his men had
been able to stand up to him and say
"no" once in awhile.
"It gets to the point where you
have to be willing to resign. That was
easy for Elliott Richardson to do. He
was older and had a reputation.
"But most of us . .. he tries to
explain, "most of us were just too
young and too inexperienced. We did
what the boss said."
