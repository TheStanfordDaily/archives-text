DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP)
U.S. diplomats said privately
yesterday they were disappointed by
the response of Tanzania and Zaire in
the kidnaping of two Stanford
students and a Dutch woman by
Marxist guerrillas.
U.S. Ambassador Beverly Carter
told newsmen he was concerned over
Tanzania's refusal to accept
responsibility for the release of the
captives. But he said he remained
confident that a way will be found to
free them.
"I am not anticipating failure," said
Carter.
Carter held a news conference
yesterday at which he introduced the
parents of the kidnaped students
recently arrived from the United
States.
Parents Confident
At the news conference, the parents
expressed confidence in actions taken
by Carter specifically, and indicated
they had no plans at present to try to
make individual contact with the
abductors.
The mother of Barbara Smuts —
who was released by the kidnapers last
Sunday — said she did not regret that
her daughter had gone to the Gombe
primate facility in Tanzania.
Carter said Tanzanian officials have
been cooperative. But other U.S.
diplomats complained about Dares
Salaam's attitude in immediately
rejecting the guerrillas ransom
demands for arms, ammunition,
$460 000 and the release of Zaire
political prisoners in Tanzania.
The guerrillas set a deadline of July
18.
Little Help
One diplomat also said Zaire has
offered little help in attempts to
contact members of the Popular
Revolutionary party who eight days
ago kidnaped the three from the
Gombe center.
He said the Zaire government
doesn't want to admit the existence of
the rebels, who oppose President

Mobutu Sese Seko and Zaire's links
with the United States.
Carter said U.S. and Tanzanian
officials were continuing joint efforts
to find ways to communicate with the
rebels, hidden in a mountainous jungle
where the Zaire government exercises
little control.
No Contact
He said there has been no contact
since Sunday, when they released

Smuts, 24, of Ann Arbor Mich., and
no response to an official Dutch and
American appeal to spare the hostages'
lives.
"Until there is communication with
these people, we don't know what will
satisfy them," Carter said.
The hostages are Kenneth Stephen
Smith, 22, of Garden Grove and Carrie
Jane Hunter, 21 of Atherton, both
Stanford University students, and
Emilie Bergman, 24, of Holland.
