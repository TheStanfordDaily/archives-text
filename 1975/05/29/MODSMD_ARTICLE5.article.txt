# Lyman Approves Judicial Plan
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The new campus judicial system will go into effect on
the first day of fall quarter, according to a letter from
President Richard Lyman, ASSU Senate Chairman Janice
Haney told senators last night.
In the letter, Lyman said he approved the change,
okayed by student voters this spring.
In another development, the senate voted 8-1-2 to
accept the proposed budget for the ASSU Course Guide
and to appropriate $2000 to the Guide from ASSU interest
income.
Sen. Kevin McDermott, the only senator voting no,
asked that the money be given only to initiate the project,
and not in unlimited general support, but his suggestion
received no backing from other senators.
Also by an 8-1-2 decision, the senate voted to pay
the resigned editors of the Course Review for the work
they had done. Clifford Schireson and Valerie Tonat will
be paid $275, while Paul Sobotka, who began work in the
fall, will receive $250.
According to Sen. William Hoke, Tonat is the only
former editor who has not turned in her Course Review
materials to the Senate Course Review Commission, but
has promised to have them in by tomorrow. The senate
made payment to Tonat contingent on fulfillment of her
promise.
Salary Money
Money for the salaries will come from a line item in the
ASSU budget, "Salaries Requisitioned." ASSU Financial
Manger Frank Olivieri was uncertain if it was technically
correct to allocate from this item, but said that Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Dale Snape had indicated it would be
permissible.
Contacted after the meeting, Snape explained that the
item had traditionally been set aside for hiring part-time
office staff in the financial manager's office. Technically,

money from the ASSU budget is to be used for ASSU
operations, rather than for programs set up by the ASSU,
Snape noted. He admitted a conflict over the difference
between "operations" and "programs."
A change in the bylaws creating the position of ASSU
Project Manager for the Course Guide was approved 8-0-3.
Junior Lance Friedmann's appointment as project
manager was then approved unanimously.
Three Senators Removed
Two graduate senators and one undergraduate senator
were removed from the senate for missing four meetings
in a row. They were undergraduate Reggie Turner and
graduates Deb Mukherjee and Sandra Dunn.
Junior Mary Ann Toman will take Turner's place for
next week's last senate meeting.
Elections Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald reported a
complaint from members of the Hammer and Coffin slate
that slates headed by Kevin McDermott and Lee
Rosenbaum had spent more than the $200 limit in the
recent Council of Presidents campaign.
No Violation
McDermott's slate proved not in violation, Fitzgerald
said, but difficulties arose in going over the Rosenbaum
slate's reported expenditures. The Rosenbaum slate had
received free copies of campaign material prepared by an
employee at a local Veterans' Hospital and listed their
value at one cent a copy.
According to an official at the hospital, the copies are
3.4 cents apiece, a change which put the Rosenbaum slate
about $20 over the limit.
Fitzgerald said there was no conscious intent to go over
the limit and no action was taken by the senate.
Because a quorum was lost one-and-a-half hours into
the meeting, the senate could no longer vote and
adjourned before discussing several items on the agenda,
including the Nominations Committee report.

that slates headed by Kevin McDermott and Lee
Rosenbaum had spent more than the $200 limit in the
recent Council of Presidents campaign.
No Violation
McDermott's slate proved not in violation, Fitzgerald
said, but difficulties arose in going over the Rosenbaum
slate's reported expenditures. The Rosenbaum slate had
received free copies of campaign material prepared by an
employee at a local Veterans' Hospital and listed their
value at one cent a copy.
According to an official at the hospital, the copies are
3.4 cents apiece, a change which put the Rosenbaum slate
about $20 over the limit.
Fitzgerald said there was no conscious intent to go over
the limit and no action was taken by the senate.
Because a quorum was lost one-and-a-half hours into
the meeting, the senate could no longer vote and
adjourned before discussing several items on the agenda,
including the Nominations Committee report.
The new campus judicial system will go into effect on
the first day of fall quarter, according to a letter from
President Richard Lyman, ASSU Senate Chairman Janice
Haney told senators last night.
In the letter, Lyman said he approved the change,
okayed by student voters this spring.
In another development, the senate voted 8-1-2 to
accept the proposed budget for the ASSU Course Guide
and to appropriate $2000 to the Guide from ASSU interest
income.
Sen. Kevin McDermott, the only senator voting no,
asked that the money be given only to initiate the project,
and not in unlimited general support, but his suggestion
received no backing from other senators.
Also by an 8-1-2 decision, the senate voted to pay
the resigned editors of the Course Review for the work
they had done. Clifford Schireson and Valerie Tonat will
be paid $275, while Paul Sobotka, who began work in the
fall, will receive $250.
According to Sen. William Hoke, Tonat is the only
former editor who has not turned in her Course Review
materials to the Senate Course Review Commission, but
has promised to have them in by tomorrow. The senate
made payment to Tonat contingent on fulfillment of her
promise.
Salary Money
Money for the salaries will come from a line item in the
ASSU budget, "Salaries Requisitioned." ASSU Financial
Manger Frank Olivieri was uncertain if it was technically
correct to allocate from this item, but said that Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Dale Snape had indicated it would be
permissible.
Contacted after the meeting, Snape explained that the
item had traditionally been set aside for hiring part-time
office staff in the financial manager's office. Technically,

money from the ASSU budget is to be used for ASSU
operations, rather than for programs set up by the ASSU,
Snape noted. He admitted a conflict over the difference
between "operations" and "programs."
A change in the bylaws creating the position of ASSU
Project Manager for the Course Guide was approved 8-0-3.
Junior Lance Friedmann's appointment as project
manager was then approved unanimously.
Three Senators Removed
Two graduate senators and one undergraduate senator
were removed from the senate for missing four meetings
in a row. They were undergraduate Reggie Turner and
graduates Deb Mukherjee and Sandra Dunn.
Junior Mary Ann Toman will take Turner's place for
next week's last senate meeting.
Elections Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald reported a
complaint from members of the Hammer and Coffin slate
