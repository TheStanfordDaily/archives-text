# Students Missed Research Talks
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Although the Committee on
Research (C-Res) has met four times
this year, its three student members
have not received regular notices of
meeting times, agendas or minutes.
At least partially as a result, all
three student members have failed to
show up at two of the meetings, and
only one appeared at two others,
including last Thursday's discussion of
the University's Iran contract.
The students have all reported that
they received some information about
C-Res — at least a notice of their
appointment.
Senior Dean Prima said he had
gotten "a few perfunctory mailings"
such as budgets and project lists, but
both he and junior Stephen Carter said
they were not even aware the C-Res
had been meeting.
Junior Bruce Ryhal estimated that
he had heard of half the meetings.
C-Res meetings usually do not deal
with "the most significant issues of the
year," Ryhal added.
All faculty and staff C-Res
members contacted by the Daily
reported that they had heard about
several meetings by Inter
-Departmental (ID) mail or telephone.
'Wasn't Conspiracy'
"It's obviously possible to make it
sound like there was a great
conspiracy, but there really wasn't,"
said Chemistry Prof. John Brauman,
C-Res chairman.
Assistant to the Vice Provost
Patricia Devaney said her office has
been sending out information to all
C-Res members. Letters to faculty and

staff were sent through ID mail, she
added, while student letters were sent
to post office boxes through the Postal
Service.
The latter were "never returned to
us," she said, so she assumed that the
students had received them.
Devaney's secretary', Brenda Pirtle,
confirmed that she used the same
mailing list for all C-Res mailings.
Brauman said that the students
should have gotten the meeting
information, "unless the post office
has a big drain that they pour stuff
down."
Brauman said that the disappearing
mail first came to his attention when
Ryhal came in to find out why he had
not heard about the committee's
public meeting last Thursday. Only
Ryhal of the students attended.
At that time Devaney's office tried
to re-check the student addresses,
Devaney said. "The results were not
that conclusive since they gave housing
units" instead of post office boxes, she
said.
Alienation Not New
Student alienation from the
committee is not solely attributable to
lack of notice, however. Student
members Carter and Prina agreed that
Brauman was unenthusiastic about the
committee at an orientation meeting
at President Richard Lyman's house
last fall.
Prina said that the lack of meeting
announcements did not surprise him
because he "didn't even think the
committee would meet" after talking
with Brauman at the orientation.
Received Notice
Prina received a preliminary
meeting notice this spring, he
reported, but the letter did not say
when the meeting would be held.
When he never received the details, he
called Brauman's office, he said, but
the woman to whom he talked did not
know anything about it. He did not
follow up his request and was never
again contacted about a meeting, he
said.
"I would have been more than
happy to go" to meetings had he
received notice, Prina said.
C-Res staff representative Jane
Chin, who recalled that she had not
noticed students at any meetings after
the first one, said, "1 thought it just
conflicted with their classes."
Brauman reported that attendance
by all C-Res members is "erratic at
best," so the absence of students did
not seem that unusual.
"We were somewhat remiss," he
admitted, "but it just never even
crossed my mind" that the students
did not know about meetings.
"My recollection is that the
students haven't shown up for
anything," said Psychology Prof.
Gordon Bower, adding that this
behavior did not surprise him. He said
that assuming a "nefarious plot" to
exclude students would be "stretching
the situation in a somewhat paranoid
way."

happy to go" to meetings had he
received notice, Prina said.
C-Res staff representative Jane
Chin, who recalled that she had not
noticed students at any meetings after
the first one, said, "1 thought it just
conflicted with their classes."
Brauman reported that attendance
by all C-Res members is "erratic at
best," so the absence of students did
not seem that unusual.
"We were somewhat remiss," he
admitted, "but it just never even
crossed my mind" that the students
did not know about meetings.
"My recollection is that the
students haven't shown up for
anything," said Psychology Prof.
Gordon Bower, adding that this
behavior did not surprise him. He said
that assuming a "nefarious plot" to
exclude students would be "stretching
the situation in a somewhat paranoid
way."
Although the Committee on
Research (C-Res) has met four times
this year, its three student members
have not received regular notices of
meeting times, agendas or minutes.
At least partially as a result, all
three student members have failed to
show up at two of the meetings, and
only one appeared at two others,
including last Thursday's discussion of
the University's Iran contract.
The students have all reported that
they received some information about
C-Res — at least a notice of their
appointment.
Senior Dean Prima said he had
gotten "a few perfunctory mailings"
such as budgets and project lists, but
both he and junior Stephen Carter said
they were not even aware the C-Res
had been meeting.
Junior Bruce Ryhal estimated that
he had heard of half the meetings.
C-Res meetings usually do not deal
with "the most significant issues of the
year," Ryhal added.
All faculty and staff C-Res
members contacted by the Daily
reported that they had heard about
several meetings by Inter
-Departmental (ID) mail or telephone.
'Wasn't Conspiracy'
"It's obviously possible to make it
sound like there was a great
conspiracy, but there really wasn't,"
said Chemistry Prof. John Brauman,
C-Res chairman.
Assistant to the Vice Provost
Patricia Devaney said her office has
been sending out information to all
C-Res members. Letters to faculty and

staff were sent through ID mail, she
added, while student letters were sent
to post office boxes through the Postal
Service.
The latter were "never returned to
us," she said, so she assumed that the
students had received them.
Devaney's secretary', Brenda Pirtle,
confirmed that she used the same
mailing list for all C-Res mailings.
Brauman said that the students
should have gotten the meeting
information, "unless the post office
has a big drain that they pour stuff
down."
Brauman said that the disappearing
mail first came to his attention when
Ryhal came in to find out why he had
not heard about the committee's
public meeting last Thursday. Only
Ryhal of the students attended.
At that time Devaney's office tried
to re-check the student addresses,
Devaney said. "The results were not
that conclusive since they gave housing
units" instead of post office boxes, she
said.
Alienation Not New
Student alienation from the
committee is not solely attributable to
lack of notice, however. Student
members Carter and Prina agreed that
Brauman was unenthusiastic about the
committee at an orientation meeting
at President Richard Lyman's house
last fall.
Prina said that the lack of meeting
announcements did not surprise him
because he "didn't even think the
committee would meet" after talking
with Brauman at the orientation.
Received Notice
Prina received a preliminary
meeting notice this spring, he
reported, but the letter did not say
when the meeting would be held.
When he never received the details, he
called Brauman's office, he said, but
the woman to whom he talked did not
know anything about it. He did not
follow up his request and was never
again contacted about a meeting, he
said.
"I would have been more than
happy to go" to meetings had he
received notice, Prina said.
C-Res staff representative Jane
