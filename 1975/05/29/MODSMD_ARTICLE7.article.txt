# Baraka Blasts U.S., Capitalism
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
"The civil rights days are over,"
Imamu Amiri Baraka (formerly Leßoi
Jones) declared last night. "We passed
that time in the '60s. The movement
now must be to smash the capitalist
system that exploits us, and that can
come about only through violent
revolution."
Calling himself "totally dedicated
to the liberation of black people in
North America," Baraka, chairman of
the "revolutionary nationalist"
Congress of African People, stated that
"it is not only the white people that
oppress us.
"Under the cunning guise of Black
Power has come the growth of a black
petty bourgeoisie, a middle class that
has assumed the classic role of the
bourgeoisie: to govern for the actual
rulers," he said.
Baraka, a native of Newark, N.J.,
has written books of poetry (Preface
to a 20-Volume Suicide Note, Black
Magic Poetry), plays (Dutchman) and
volumes of music criticismf/J/ups
People).
He cited conditions in his place of
birth:
"In Newark, a city of 65 percent
black people and 12 percent Puerto
Ricans, we have wall-to-wall black
bureaucrats with Mercedes-Benzes,
afros, Pierre Cardin suits and
Lincolns," he said. "They're in charge
of oppression in the city that Harpers
magazine called the worst in
America."
Baraka compared Newark's black
mayor, Kenneth Gibson, to Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko. "Black
faces in high places without change
only makes the system more diverse,
an-*? more dangerous," he stated.
He blasted such black legislators as
Reps. Shirley Chisholm and Charles
Rangel (both D-N.Y.). "They tell us
Ford's our friend on the one hand and
our enemy on the other," he said.
"And then they nominate Nelson

Rockefeller, the fiend of Attica, to be
vice president.
"Rockefeller is not a lackey," said
Baraka. "He's a member of the ruling
class. It shows that the ruling class no
longer trusts the simple-minded
lieutenants to govern for them.
"Dr. Strangelove, Henry Kissinger,
used to work for Rockefeller," he said.
"Who do you think Kissinger reports
to now? Stupid Jerry Ford, who can't
chew gum and walk up a stair at the
same time? Ford's not even good for
comic relief."

oppress us.
"Under the cunning guise of Black
Power has come the growth of a black
petty bourgeoisie, a middle class that
has assumed the classic role of the
bourgeoisie: to govern for the actual
rulers," he said.
Baraka, a native of Newark, N.J.,
has written books of poetry (Preface
to a 20-Volume Suicide Note, Black
Magic Poetry), plays (Dutchman) and
volumes of music criticismf/J/ups
People).
He cited conditions in his place of
birth:
"In Newark, a city of 65 percent
black people and 12 percent Puerto
Ricans, we have wall-to-wall black
bureaucrats with Mercedes-Benzes,
afros, Pierre Cardin suits and
Lincolns," he said. "They're in charge
of oppression in the city that Harpers
magazine called the worst in
America."
Baraka compared Newark's black
mayor, Kenneth Gibson, to Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko. "Black
faces in high places without change
only makes the system more diverse,
an-*? more dangerous," he stated.
He blasted such black legislators as
Reps. Shirley Chisholm and Charles
Rangel (both D-N.Y.). "They tell us
Ford's our friend on the one hand and
our enemy on the other," he said.
"And then they nominate Nelson

Rockefeller, the fiend of Attica, to be
vice president.
"Rockefeller is not a lackey," said
Baraka. "He's a member of the ruling
class. It shows that the ruling class no
longer trusts the simple-minded
lieutenants to govern for them.
"Dr. Strangelove, Henry Kissinger,
used to work for Rockefeller," he said.
"Who do you think Kissinger reports
to now? Stupid Jerry Ford, who can't
chew gum and walk up a stair at the
same time? Ford's not even good for
comic relief."
