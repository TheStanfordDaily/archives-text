## On The Terrace 
### 
A long period of legal disputes and bureaucratic
stalling has obstructed plans for Frenchman's Terrace, a
proposed 225-unit housing development that would be
built on University land and managed by the Urban
Coalition. But despite such attempts to stall the proposal,
the University should continue to search for ways of
funding Frenchman's Terrace.
The proposal as it now stands would, if carried out,
help alleviate the serious housing shortage for University
employees, many of whom now must commute long
distances because of a lack of adequate housing in the
Palo Alto-Stanford area. For the use of its land, the
University would receive a substantial amount of money.
And plans for the project call for an income mix, with
provisions that some of the units be allocated to
moderate- and low-income persons.
When University officials originally conceived the
project, they counted on cooperation and funding from
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). Since 1968, when the University first submitted
plans for the project, HUD's actions have represented the
ultimate in foot-dragging. The agency took more than a
year to decide that the University's plans for the project
were illegal under the 1968 National Housing Act. The
University had sought to assign 50 percent of the housing
to University employees and to provide an income mix
which would allocate 40 percent to market value housing,
40 percent to moderate-income housing and 20 percent
to low-income housing.
University officials now believe that the proposed
income mix would be legal under 1974 legislation, but
that the 50 percent minimum for University employees
may still not be legal. Unfortunately, there are doubts
that the University trustees, who must approve any use of
University land, would approve the plan without the
50-50 proposal.
But certainly this project has been stalled long enough.
If funds cannot be found elsewhere, the University
should consider sacrificing the 50-50 requirement so that
it can receive the HUD money. Because of its location,
we feel the Frechmen's Terrace project would attract
enough University employees without a specified
minimum. HUD, now, should act to make up for the time
it has wasted, and the University should continue to
pursue all sources of funding for this proposal.
