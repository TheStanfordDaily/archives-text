Mem Chu Cuts
Editor:
I was surprised to find my
offhand comments to Tim
Ferguson quoted in his May 22
Daily column on Memorial
Church. When Ferguson asked if
Task Force II is studying the
activities of the church, I said
that those activities were
included in a much broader
survey of services to students.
I invited him to an open
forum, sponsored by Task Force
11, to discuss University financial
support of medical services,
cultural events, recreational
activities, career and placement
services, religious activities,
counseling and services to
minorities and other special
interest groups.
In responding to further
questions about Memorial
Church, I did not think I was
being interviewed for a column.
I wish to emphasize that the
church has not been singled out
for special attention, nor has any
other sector of the University.
Deans and directors of many
other sectors can attest to this,
as they have received our
detailed inquiries.
Benjamin M. Page
Professor, Geology
Chairman, Task Force II
Tim Ferguson replies: When
speaking to Prof. Page, I first
made clear that I was a Daily
staffer, and then proceeded to
question him about the activities
of his committee.

He's Not Dead
Editor:
In the May 6 Daily, in the
article "Dixon Visits Sophie's;
Wolf Dies," I informed readers
that the great Chester "Howlin'
Wolf" Burnett had passed away.
I am now happily embarrassed to
report that I was dead wrong;
Wolf Lives!
The original information
given me by Michael
Bloomfield via Charlie
Musselwhite should have been
checked out more thoroughly
before I wrote the obituary.
Upon talking to Muddy Waters
at Sophie's, and phoning
Delmark Records' Bob Koester
in Chicago, I discovered that
Wolf did have a stroke, but has
apparently recovered. Sorry.
