# Tanzanian Prisoners Don't Exist?

### 
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP)
— Diplomats said yesterday that
Tanzania may not have in custody a
dozen political prisoners whose
freedom has been demanded by
Marxist kidnapers holding two
Americans and a Dutch student.
The prisoners named are members
of the Popular Revolutionary party in
neighboring Zaire who were allegedly
arrested in Tanzania. But the
diplomats say the Zairians' names have
disappeared from official Tanzanian
detention records. They speculated
that the detainees may have been
secretly turned over to the Zairian
government of President Mobutu Sese
Seko or met some other fate
The diplomats said Tanzania's
inability to produce the prisoners
could explain its quick rejection of the
demands and its refusal to accept any
obligation to work for the students'
freedom.
Diplomats not directly involved in
the case said they understood U.S.
officials were making gradual progress
with Tanzanian authorities to set up
some system to communicate with the
guerrillas.
The guerrillas did not indicate a
means of communication Sunday,
when they released Smuts, who carried
ransom demands for arms,
ammunition, $460,000 and the release
of Popular Revolutionary leaders held
in Tanzania.
Still held after a May 19 raid on a
baboon research center in Tanzania are
Carrie Hunter, 21, of Atherton,
Kenneth Stephen Smith, 22, of
Garden Grove, and Emilie Bergmann,
25 of Holland.
Meanwhile, Psychiatry Prof. David
Hamburg, the University's official
representative in Tanzania, said after a
meeting with U.S. Ambassador Beverly
Carter, "We are not discouraged.
"I met with the ambassador and his
staff and am very favorably impressed."
Hamburg also met with Barbara
Smuts, whom the rebels released on
Sunday. "She has been ill but is much
better. She has delivered letters from
those still held captive to their
parents," he said.
