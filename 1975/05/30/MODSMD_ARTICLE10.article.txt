# Federal Aid Carries A Price Tag
## 
### Jim Wascher 
I have a great surprise for everyone:
Stanford has big problems. No really, I'm
serious about this, so pay attention, please.
Some of the greatest difficulties which
this University has encountered during my
four years as an' undergraduate here have
arisen because of Stanford's close financial
ties with the Federal government.
Take Title IX, for example. This
three-year-old law states: "No person in the
United States shall, on the basis of sex, be
excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education
program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance." /
Of course, the punishment for violation
of Title IX is withdrawal of the federal
funds in question. Horrors. Stanford, which
prides itself on being the West's best private
institution of higher learning, receives about
10 percent of its annual revenues for
educational purposes from the U.S.
government.
So, as soon as the Department of Health;
Education and Welfare issued its regulations
under Title IX, Stanford rushed to ensure
that all of its programs were in compliance.
The undergraduate housing system was
completely revamped, mainly because of
Title IX (Larry Horton, I know you've
denied this, but I think you've misspoken
yourself).' Because of Title IX, fraternities
were on the verge of elimination before
enough people bitched.
All men's and women's athletic programs
were combined this spring under a common
department, and Title IX was at least
partially responsible for that, too.
Because of the merger, women will
finally be getting a fair shake when athletic
scholarships are passed out. But the women
who now go out for a sport simply for the

recreation (and fun) involved will probably
be driven away by the more intensely
competitive atmosphere which their sports'
new, big-time status will create.

The same is true for male athletes who
go out for junior varsity sports. As the
budget crunch here continues, and it will,
Athletic Department planners will have to
choose between men's JV teams and
women's varsity teams. The law will force
them to eliminate the men's JV programs,
and a lot of people will be cut off from
some great opportunities. All because
Stanford can't afford to lose its Federal
funding. ;
But my point isn't that these changes are
undesirable. I don't really know. What I do
know is that Stanford shouldn't be in the
position of scrambling to toe the line every
time Uncle Sam says "Jump!" If the
University is truly private, it should be able
to answer "no" to that sort of command,
rather than asking "how high?"
Then, of course, there's the Buckley
Amendment, which opened educational
institutions' files on students and former
students to the perusal of those people. One
of the University's lawyers complained that
the law is "almost noxiously burdensome."
It creates a lot of paperwork and

headaches for Stanford's vast
bureaucracy.
Those headaches wouldn't even be a
problem if it weren't for the penalty for
non-compliance with the Buckley
Amendment. And the penalty is a cut-off
of federal funds. Oops, say the lawyers,
we'd better comply.
A couple of years back, a congressman
from New York proposed a law which
would have cut off all federal funds to any
university which had terminated its Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program.
University lobbyists (they say they're
not, but then Nixon said he wasn't a crook)
endeavored mightily to defeat the
legislation. They succeeded. Back then,
Robert Rosenzweig, now vice president for
public affairs, said "many institutions saw
the threat to themselves ultimately" if
Congress exercised this sort of control over
universities' internal affairs.
Although 1 didn't realize it at the time,
Rosenzweig seems to have missed the point.
Congress wouldn't be able to exercise any
sort of control if Stanford didn't accept at
least $lO million annually from the U.S.
Treasury. V
The three laws that I've discussed are
merely indicative of the interference that
Stanford and other "private" universities
must suffer because they need money so
badly.
If Stanford is satisfied with its role as a
pseudo-public institution, that's fine.
Nothing has to change. If it isn't Satisfied,
all of us ought to consider very carefully
how big the price tag on Stanford's
independence should be.

Of course, the punishment for violation
of Title IX is withdrawal of the federal
funds in question. Horrors. Stanford, which
prides itself on being the West's best private
institution of higher learning, receives about
10 percent of its annual revenues for
educational purposes from the U.S.
government.
So, as soon as the Department of Health;
Education and Welfare issued its regulations
under Title IX, Stanford rushed to ensure
that all of its programs were in compliance.
The undergraduate housing system was
completely revamped, mainly because of
Title IX (Larry Horton, I know you've
denied this, but I think you've misspoken
yourself).' Because of Title IX, fraternities
were on the verge of elimination before
enough people bitched.
All men's and women's athletic programs
were combined this spring under a common
department, and Title IX was at least
partially responsible for that, too.
Because of the merger, women will
finally be getting a fair shake when athletic
scholarships are passed out. But the women
who now go out for a sport simply for the

recreation (and fun) involved will probably
be driven away by the more intensely
competitive atmosphere which their sports'
new, big-time status will create.

The same is true for male athletes who
go out for junior varsity sports. As the
budget crunch here continues, and it will,
Athletic Department planners will have to
choose between men's JV teams and
women's varsity teams. The law will force
them to eliminate the men's JV programs,
and a lot of people will be cut off from
some great opportunities. All because
Stanford can't afford to lose its Federal
funding. ;
But my point isn't that these changes are
undesirable. I don't really know. What I do
know is that Stanford shouldn't be in the
position of scrambling to toe the line every
time Uncle Sam says "Jump!" If the
University is truly private, it should be able
to answer "no" to that sort of command,
rather than asking "how high?"
Then, of course, there's the Buckley
Amendment, which opened educational
institutions' files on students and former
students to the perusal of those people. One
of the University's lawyers complained that
the law is "almost noxiously burdensome."
It creates a lot of paperwork and

headaches for Stanford's vast
bureaucracy.
Those headaches wouldn't even be a
problem if it weren't for the penalty for
non-compliance with the Buckley
Amendment. And the penalty is a cut-off
of federal funds. Oops, say the lawyers,
we'd better comply.
A couple of years back, a congressman
from New York proposed a law which
would have cut off all federal funds to any
university which had terminated its Reserve
Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program.
University lobbyists (they say they're
not, but then Nixon said he wasn't a crook)
endeavored mightily to defeat the
legislation. They succeeded. Back then,
Robert Rosenzweig, now vice president for
public affairs, said "many institutions saw
the threat to themselves ultimately" if
Congress exercised this sort of control over
universities' internal affairs.
Although 1 didn't realize it at the time,
Rosenzweig seems to have missed the point.
Congress wouldn't be able to exercise any
sort of control if Stanford didn't accept at
least $lO million annually from the U.S.
Treasury. V
The three laws that I've discussed are
merely indicative of the interference that
Stanford and other "private" universities
must suffer because they need money so
badly.
If Stanford is satisfied with its role as a
pseudo-public institution, that's fine.
Nothing has to change. If it isn't Satisfied,
all of us ought to consider very carefully
how big the price tag on Stanford's
independence should be.

I have a great surprise for everyone:
Stanford has big problems. No really, I'm
serious about this, so pay attention, please.
Some of the greatest difficulties which
this University has encountered during my
four years as an' undergraduate here have
arisen because of Stanford's close financial
ties with the Federal government.
Take Title IX, for example. This
three-year-old law states: "No person in the
United States shall, on the basis of sex, be
excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any education
program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance." /

of Title IX is withdrawal of the federal
