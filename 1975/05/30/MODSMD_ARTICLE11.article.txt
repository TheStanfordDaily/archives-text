# Church Merits Support
## 
### M. Bahmann 
I have two principal
objections to Tim Ferguson's
May 22 column about Memorial
Church and its dean, Robert
Hamerton-Kelly.
Ferguson wonders: "Should
student services money be used
to finance the controversial
political activities of the
church?" He lists as examples
the support for Food Day and
Cesar Chavez this last year.
Had his research been more
thorough, he also would have
mentioned the prophetic call for
Nixon's impeachment raised by
Kelly and supported by a large
majority of his worshipping
congregation in the fall of 1973,
a time when this demand was
still far from being popular.
What is truly objectionable at
this point in Ferguson's
argument is the fact that he
drags an ill-defined concept of
"controversial political
activities" quickly across the
scene. This is irresponsible
journalism. Whenever a religious
community becomes specific
and concrete in an active
support of justice, love, and
feeding the hungry,, it is accused
of engaging in improper
controversial activities.

Daily readers do not accept
this old line of faulty thinking.
The broad support given by
many students to the World
Hunger Appeal this spring, both
through Memorial Church and
through other programs, points
in a different direction.
Many students would want to
see more of an involvement in
contemporary issues of justice
and concrete love on the part of
the religious communities.
On the other hand, Ferguson
provided us with a set of
interesting statistics, helpful to
all of us on campus who are not
acquainted with the inner
running of Memorial Church.
But he failed to address the
deeper issue that is here at stake.
The basic question is what is the
future for Stanford as a
university, as a community of
people held together by some
unifying principle. Only in the
context of such a basic
reflection will the statistics have
any real meaning.
As I watched Ferguson play
the game of numbers with
dollars and people, I had the
strange sensation of being
transferred back to the "body
count" mentality of the
Vietnam war.
