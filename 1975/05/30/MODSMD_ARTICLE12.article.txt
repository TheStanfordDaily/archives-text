Let Moynihan Speak
Editor:
I have been disturbed by
several of the opinions expressed
in the Daily regarding Daniel
Patrick Moynihan as
commencement speaker.
I believe that the graduating
class should have the right to
choose its commencement

speaker. When I graduated from
the University of Rochester, we
had an unpopular speaker
foisted upon us and our protests
did not stop Richard M. Nixon
from speaking at our
commencement.
He spoke on academic
freedom and the responsibility
of an academic community to

hear and consider unpopular
points of view meaning his
own.
In retrospect, it is
unfortunate that Nixon did not
pay closer attention to his own
speech and extend that
responsibility to consider other
viewpoints to himself. However,
regardless of the source, the
point he made is valid: an
academic community does have
a responsibility to consider
unpopular, distasteful and
"irritating" opinions.
Moynihan's work is outside
of my field, and so I make no
judgment on its value. But to
dismiss it because its content is
disagreeable is a form of
anti-intellectualism that an
academic community cannot
afford if it wishes to maintain
any standards of intellectual
honesty and freedom.
It is reasonable to question
the appropriateness of
presenting a controversial point
of view at a commencement
exercise, where there is no

opportunity for question or
debate, but to close the
University to those whom some
of the University community
find "irritating" is to close the
University to question, to debate
and to intellectual growth and
change.

I opened the May 23 Daily and
turned to the entertainment
page to find what the Daily had
written about our show, The
Odd Couple. The box "Student
Plays" started out harmlessly
with a summary of what, when
and where.
Then came the line beginning,
"But for the discriminating
tastes..." According to this
article, Music Man is "a must"

and The Odd Couple and Plaza
Suite are only tolerable, best for
those with a "sincere ... apprec
iation" of dorm shows.
Daily Entertainment Editor
Steve Hefter wrote one line that
panned our show after seeing a
grand total of 25 minutes of Act
I. I think it 'dishonest of him to
shaft any show without seeing
the whole thing and without
stating any reason. I've seen bad
reviews, nonsensical reviews and
irrelevant reviews since I began
working in theatre nine years
ago, but I've never seen
someone screw a show as briefly
and with as little justification as
he did.
I also don't understand why
Music Man was favored with a
complete notice; I walked into
the Daily office a week ago with
a poster and invited Hefter to
come see the show. It would
have been easy to send a critic to
a dress rehearsal in time for
publication.
So, if Hefter continues in the
newspaper business, I hope he

develops a little more editorial
responsibility. And I hope he
learns more about theatre.

Farewell, Rabbi Familant
Editor:
Rabbi Charles Familant will
be retiring this spring from his
position as director of the
Stanford Hiliel Foundation after
10 years. On behalf of the
Jewish students at Stanford, I
would like to thank him for the
efforts and services he has
rendered to and on behalf of the
Jewish students here.
Though we have had many
differences with Familant, we
have always known him as a
friend and one with whom we
could talk. I wish him good luck
in the future, and know that he
will enjoy it, as his best interests
and abilities lie in the fields of
counseling aW teaching.

responsibility to consider other
viewpoints to himself. However,
regardless of the source, the
point he made is valid: an
academic community does have
a responsibility to consider
unpopular, distasteful and
"irritating" opinions.
Moynihan's work is outside
of my field, and so I make no
judgment on its value. But to
dismiss it because its content is
disagreeable is a form of
anti-intellectualism that an
academic community cannot
afford if it wishes to maintain
any standards of intellectual
honesty and freedom.
It is reasonable to question
the appropriateness of
presenting a controversial point
of view at a commencement
exercise, where there is no

opportunity for question or
debate, but to close the
University to those whom some
of the University community
find "irritating" is to close the
University to question, to debate
and to intellectual growth and
change.

I opened the May 23 Daily and
turned to the entertainment
page to find what the Daily had
written about our show, The
Odd Couple. The box "Student
Plays" started out harmlessly
with a summary of what, when
and where.
Then came the line beginning,
"But for the discriminating
tastes..." According to this
article, Music Man is "a must"

and The Odd Couple and Plaza
Suite are only tolerable, best for
those with a "sincere ... apprec
iation" of dorm shows.
Daily Entertainment Editor
Steve Hefter wrote one line that
panned our show after seeing a
grand total of 25 minutes of Act
I. I think it 'dishonest of him to
shaft any show without seeing
the whole thing and without
stating any reason. I've seen bad
reviews, nonsensical reviews and
irrelevant reviews since I began
working in theatre nine years
ago, but I've never seen
someone screw a show as briefly
and with as little justification as
he did.
I also don't understand why
Music Man was favored with a
complete notice; I walked into
the Daily office a week ago with
a poster and invited Hefter to
come see the show. It would
have been easy to send a critic to
a dress rehearsal in time for
publication.
So, if Hefter continues in the
newspaper business, I hope he

develops a little more editorial
responsibility. And I hope he
learns more about theatre.

Farewell, Rabbi Familant
Editor:
Rabbi Charles Familant will
be retiring this spring from his
position as director of the
Stanford Hiliel Foundation after
10 years. On behalf of the
Jewish students at Stanford, I
would like to thank him for the
efforts and services he has
rendered to and on behalf of the
Jewish students here.
Though we have had many
differences with Familant, we
have always known him as a
friend and one with whom we
could talk. I wish him good luck
in the future, and know that he
will enjoy it, as his best interests
and abilities lie in the fields of
counseling aW teaching.

Let Moynihan Speak
Editor:
I have been disturbed by
several of the opinions expressed
in the Daily regarding Daniel
Patrick Moynihan as
commencement speaker.
I believe that the graduating
class should have the right to
choose its commencement

speaker. When I graduated from
the University of Rochester, we
had an unpopular speaker
foisted upon us and our protests
did not stop Richard M. Nixon
from speaking at our
commencement.
He spoke on academic
freedom and the responsibility
of an academic community to

hear and consider unpopular
points of view meaning his
own.
In retrospect, it is
unfortunate that Nixon did not
pay closer attention to his own
speech and extend that
responsibility to consider other
viewpoints to himself. However,
regardless of the source, the
point he made is valid: an
academic community does have
a responsibility to consider
unpopular, distasteful and
"irritating" opinions.
Moynihan's work is outside
of my field, and so I make no
judgment on its value. But to
