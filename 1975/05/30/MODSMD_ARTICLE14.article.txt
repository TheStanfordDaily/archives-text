# University Research: How Critical Is Review?
## 
### DAN WATKISS 
Recent controversy surrounding the Iran
Contract has cast considerable doubt upon the
University's accountability for research
pursued in its name.
Presently the University oversees research
through the Faculty Senate Committee on
Research (C-Res) and the administration Panel
on Human Subjects in Research (P-HSR)
subcommittees on medicine and behavioral
science.
The Iran Contract received only cursory
review from C-Res and none at all from the
panel. The reason lies in a distinction drawn by
administrators between "pure" and "applied"
research. Although this distinction is crucial in
deciding the fate of University sponsored
research, it is poorly defined and
inconsistently invoked.
Both William Massy, vice provost for
research, and Robert Simmons, manager of the
Sponsored Projects Office, maintain that the
Iran contract entails the analysis of
communications systems for that country,
exclusive of implementation, and therefore
does not involve human subjects. In essense
they claim that no one is affected by such
"pure" research.
This argument is dubious. Traditionally,
"pure" research has been defined as
open-ended. This is certainly not the case with
the Iran contract. The contract's "work
statement" includes a precise objective for the
research — the design of a communications and
educational TV system employing already
existing technologies.
Argument Suspect
Massy's argument on "human subjects" is
also suspect. The contract's work statement
explicitly states that the research will seek to
provide for the communications and
educational "needs" of Iran. These "needs"
are unquestionably needs of the Iranian

people.
In a letter to C-Res last week, five faculty
members insisted that the contract "is by no
stretch of the imagination 'pure' research"
because the contract's investigators "have
made it clear that they incorporate moral and
political intentions into their research."
The two lines of argument, that of "pure"
research and that of "human subjects," tend to
place research beyond critical review; if the

research is claimed to be "pure," then there
are no human subjects, and if there are no
human subjects then further review of a
contract is essentially precluded.
"Policy and Procedures" guidelines of the
P-HSR clearly state that the University will
maintain "a committee competent to review
the plans of investigation involving human
subjects." This policy, however, is
self-defeating in that it requires no
"competent" party to determine whether
human subjects exist in the first place.
"We assume that there are no human
subjects when the principal investigator and
the dean of his department say there are
none," claims Simmons. Consequently,
"competent" review of the Iran contract by
the behavioral science panel was bypassed
when the investigator, Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan, and his dean checked
the "no" column beside "human subjects" on
a standard research information form.
This procedure is inadequate because the
investigator and his dean are too intimate with
research to determine objectively its inclusion
of human subjects. It further fails to provide
"competent" review because of the narrow
scope of the investigator's and his dean's
expertise.
Guidelines Apply
Had the Iran contract been reviewed by
P-HSR, substantive restrictions might well have
been encountered because several of the
panel's guidelines apply directly to the
contract.

Those guidelines emphasize that particular
concern is to be taken when dealing with
human subjects "in groups with limited civil
freedoms." The pertinence of this statement is
obvious with regard to Iranians, whose civil
liberties are severely limited under their ruling
Shah's police state.
Also emphasized in the guidelines is a
requirement that the investigator obtain the
"informed consent" of the "people whom he
studies." It is clear that the contract intends to
study the Iranian people, and consequently
that they warrant protection under the

"informed consent" provision.
Obviously it would be impossible for
Lusignan to procure every Iranian's "informed
consent," yet this does not mean that he can
assume it to be given, especially when the
research was contracted by a dictator allegedly
placed on his throne by the CIA.
Inspite of these and other possible points of
review, Massy insists that distinctions be
preserved to exclude some research from
review for financial if no other reasons.
"Though I hate to use the word 'costs,'" he
said, "if you really add up the costs of

reviewing research, those costs are very great.
It's hard to do any more than we're doing,
especially now that the University is facing a
$lO million cutback."
The University, however, receives money
with which to finance the necessary reviews
from the indirect cost fees it charges its clients.
"Indirect costs do include financing for
reviews by the Human Subjects and other
committees," says Barbara Devaney, assistant
to the vice provost for research.
University's Choice
Still, Massy indicates, the University is
faced with a choice between competing
economically for research and preserving
its critical role in society. If the University
takes the former route, the consequences for
its critical social functions could be dire; "even
corporations and governments fund only those
projects which fit their purposes and ideals,"
according to a policy recommendation
submitted by junior Thomas Wainright.
This is a danger faced by many other
American universities, made apparent by a
recent article in which University of Michigan
Economics Prof. Stanley Sheinbaum reveals his
department's complicity with the CIA in
Vietnam.

He writes: "Within the University only the
exceptional faculty member seeks reward and
promotions via scholarship and teaching. The
easier and even more prestigious route is that
of the new-breed professor with his
machine-stamped Ph.D. who orbits the
University's stratosphere of institutions,
projects and contracts. .. The work he
emphasizes is of dubious value — by reason of
his bias against considerations of value."
In response to opposition to the Iran
contract, Massy requested that C-Res review
the contract as well as its own committee
guidelines.
If the contract, in review, is found to
violate policy, the University is allowed under
Article 12 of the Iran Contract guidelines to
terminate the pact at any time. But both
Massy and Simmons say that termination is
"highly unlikely." As Simmons says, "there is
no history of rejecting contracts."

"pure" research has been defined as
open-ended. This is certainly not the case with
the Iran contract. The contract's "work
statement" includes a precise objective for the
research — the design of a communications and
educational TV system employing already
existing technologies.
Argument Suspect
Massy's argument on "human subjects" is
also suspect. The contract's work statement
explicitly states that the research will seek to
provide for the communications and
educational "needs" of Iran. These "needs"
are unquestionably needs of the Iranian

people.
In a letter to C-Res last week, five faculty
members insisted that the contract "is by no
stretch of the imagination 'pure' research"
because the contract's investigators "have
made it clear that they incorporate moral and
political intentions into their research."
The two lines of argument, that of "pure"
research and that of "human subjects," tend to
place research beyond critical review; if the

research is claimed to be "pure," then there
are no human subjects, and if there are no
human subjects then further review of a
contract is essentially precluded.
"Policy and Procedures" guidelines of the
P-HSR clearly state that the University will
maintain "a committee competent to review
the plans of investigation involving human
subjects." This policy, however, is
self-defeating in that it requires no
"competent" party to determine whether
human subjects exist in the first place.
"We assume that there are no human
subjects when the principal investigator and
the dean of his department say there are
none," claims Simmons. Consequently,
"competent" review of the Iran contract by
the behavioral science panel was bypassed
when the investigator, Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan, and his dean checked
the "no" column beside "human subjects" on
a standard research information form.
This procedure is inadequate because the
investigator and his dean are too intimate with
research to determine objectively its inclusion
of human subjects. It further fails to provide
"competent" review because of the narrow
scope of the investigator's and his dean's
expertise.
Guidelines Apply
Had the Iran contract been reviewed by
P-HSR, substantive restrictions might well have
been encountered because several of the
panel's guidelines apply directly to the
contract.

Those guidelines emphasize that particular
concern is to be taken when dealing with
human subjects "in groups with limited civil
freedoms." The pertinence of this statement is
obvious with regard to Iranians, whose civil
liberties are severely limited under their ruling
Shah's police state.
Also emphasized in the guidelines is a
requirement that the investigator obtain the
"informed consent" of the "people whom he
studies." It is clear that the contract intends to
study the Iranian people, and consequently
that they warrant protection under the

"informed consent" provision.
Obviously it would be impossible for
Lusignan to procure every Iranian's "informed
consent," yet this does not mean that he can
assume it to be given, especially when the
research was contracted by a dictator allegedly
placed on his throne by the CIA.
Inspite of these and other possible points of
review, Massy insists that distinctions be
preserved to exclude some research from
review for financial if no other reasons.
"Though I hate to use the word 'costs,'" he
said, "if you really add up the costs of

reviewing research, those costs are very great.
It's hard to do any more than we're doing,
especially now that the University is facing a
$lO million cutback."
The University, however, receives money
with which to finance the necessary reviews
from the indirect cost fees it charges its clients.
"Indirect costs do include financing for
reviews by the Human Subjects and other
committees," says Barbara Devaney, assistant
to the vice provost for research.
University's Choice
Still, Massy indicates, the University is
faced with a choice between competing
economically for research and preserving
its critical role in society. If the University
takes the former route, the consequences for
its critical social functions could be dire; "even
corporations and governments fund only those
projects which fit their purposes and ideals,"
according to a policy recommendation
submitted by junior Thomas Wainright.
This is a danger faced by many other
American universities, made apparent by a
recent article in which University of Michigan
Economics Prof. Stanley Sheinbaum reveals his
department's complicity with the CIA in
Vietnam.

He writes: "Within the University only the
exceptional faculty member seeks reward and
promotions via scholarship and teaching. The
easier and even more prestigious route is that
of the new-breed professor with his
machine-stamped Ph.D. who orbits the
University's stratosphere of institutions,
projects and contracts. .. The work he
emphasizes is of dubious value — by reason of
his bias against considerations of value."
In response to opposition to the Iran
contract, Massy requested that C-Res review
the contract as well as its own committee
guidelines.
If the contract, in review, is found to
violate policy, the University is allowed under
Article 12 of the Iran Contract guidelines to
terminate the pact at any time. But both
Massy and Simmons say that termination is
"highly unlikely." As Simmons says, "there is
no history of rejecting contracts."

Recent controversy surrounding the Iran
Contract has cast considerable doubt upon the

pursued in its name.
Presently the University oversees research

Both William Massy, vice provost for

are no human subjects, and if there are no
human subjects then further review of a
contract is essentially precluded.
"Policy and Procedures" guidelines of the
P-HSR clearly state that the University will
maintain "a committee competent to review
the plans of investigation involving human
subjects." This policy, however, is
self-defeating in that it requires no
"competent" party to determine whether
human subjects exist in the first place.
"We assume that there are no human
subjects when the principal investigator and
the dean of his department say there are
none," claims Simmons. Consequently,
"competent" review of the Iran contract by
the behavioral science panel was bypassed
when the investigator, Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan, and his dean checked
the "no" column beside "human subjects" on
a standard research information form.
This procedure is inadequate because the
investigator and his dean are too intimate with
research to determine objectively its inclusion
of human subjects. It further fails to provide
"competent" review because of the narrow
scope of the investigator's and his dean's
expertise.
Guidelines Apply
Had the Iran contract been reviewed by
P-HSR, substantive restrictions might well have
been encountered because several of the
panel's guidelines apply directly to the
contract.

Those guidelines emphasize that particular
concern is to be taken when dealing with
human subjects "in groups with limited civil
freedoms." The pertinence of this statement is
obvious with regard to Iranians, whose civil
liberties are severely limited under their ruling
Shah's police state.
Also emphasized in the guidelines is a
requirement that the investigator obtain the
"informed consent" of the "people whom he
studies." It is clear that the contract intends to
study the Iranian people, and consequently
that they warrant protection under the

"informed consent" provision.
Obviously it would be impossible for
Lusignan to procure every Iranian's "informed
consent," yet this does not mean that he can
assume it to be given, especially when the
research was contracted by a dictator allegedly
placed on his throne by the CIA.
Inspite of these and other possible points of
review, Massy insists that distinctions be
preserved to exclude some research from
review for financial if no other reasons.
"Though I hate to use the word 'costs,'" he
said, "if you really add up the costs of

reviewing research, those costs are very great.
It's hard to do any more than we're doing,
especially now that the University is facing a
$lO million cutback."
The University, however, receives money
with which to finance the necessary reviews
from the indirect cost fees it charges its clients.
"Indirect costs do include financing for
reviews by the Human Subjects and other
committees," says Barbara Devaney, assistant
to the vice provost for research.
University's Choice
Still, Massy indicates, the University is
faced with a choice between competing
economically for research and preserving
its critical role in society. If the University
takes the former route, the consequences for
its critical social functions could be dire; "even
corporations and governments fund only those
projects which fit their purposes and ideals,"
according to a policy recommendation
submitted by junior Thomas Wainright.
This is a danger faced by many other
American universities, made apparent by a
recent article in which University of Michigan
Economics Prof. Stanley Sheinbaum reveals his
department's complicity with the CIA in
Vietnam.

He writes: "Within the University only the
exceptional faculty member seeks reward and
promotions via scholarship and teaching. The
easier and even more prestigious route is that
of the new-breed professor with his
machine-stamped Ph.D. who orbits the
University's stratosphere of institutions,
projects and contracts. .. The work he
emphasizes is of dubious value — by reason of
his bias against considerations of value."
In response to opposition to the Iran
contract, Massy requested that C-Res review
the contract as well as its own committee
guidelines.
If the contract, in review, is found to
violate policy, the University is allowed under
Article 12 of the Iran Contract guidelines to
terminate the pact at any time. But both
Massy and Simmons say that termination is
"highly unlikely." As Simmons says, "there is
no history of rejecting contracts."

WILLIAM MASSY
Recent controversy surrounding the Iran
Contract has cast considerable doubt upon the
University's accountability for research
pursued in its name.
Presently the University oversees research
through the Faculty Senate Committee on
Research (C-Res) and the administration Panel
on Human Subjects in Research (P-HSR)
subcommittees on medicine and behavioral
science.
The Iran Contract received only cursory
review from C-Res and none at all from the
panel. The reason lies in a distinction drawn by
administrators between "pure" and "applied"
research. Although this distinction is crucial in
deciding the fate of University sponsored
research, it is poorly defined and
inconsistently invoked.
Both William Massy, vice provost for
research, and Robert Simmons, manager of the
Sponsored Projects Office, maintain that the
Iran contract entails the analysis of
communications systems for that country,
exclusive of implementation, and therefore
does not involve human subjects. In essense
they claim that no one is affected by such
"pure" research.
This argument is dubious. Traditionally,
"pure" research has been defined as
open-ended. This is certainly not the case with
the Iran contract. The contract's "work
statement" includes a precise objective for the
research — the design of a communications and
educational TV system employing already
existing technologies.
Argument Suspect
Massy's argument on "human subjects" is
also suspect. The contract's work statement
explicitly states that the research will seek to
provide for the communications and
educational "needs" of Iran. These "needs"
are unquestionably needs of the Iranian

people.
In a letter to C-Res last week, five faculty
members insisted that the contract "is by no
stretch of the imagination 'pure' research"
because the contract's investigators "have
made it clear that they incorporate moral and
political intentions into their research."
The two lines of argument, that of "pure"
research and that of "human subjects," tend to
place research beyond critical review; if the

research is claimed to be "pure," then there
are no human subjects, and if there are no
human subjects then further review of a
contract is essentially precluded.
"Policy and Procedures" guidelines of the
P-HSR clearly state that the University will
