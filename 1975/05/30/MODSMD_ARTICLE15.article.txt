# Journals Die For Lack Of Journalists
## 'Stanford Review' May Join Parade; Are Paid Staffers The Answer? 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Reports this week of the possible folding of
the intellectual Stanford Review brought to
light a problem which faces many campus
publications: lack of staff.
The dearth of necessarily unpaid volunteers
on many publications appears directly
attributable to the fact that few Stanford
students have the time to be an unpaid
volunteer for anything that doesn't net them
some tangible reward.
And let's face it, there's very little tangible
reward in being a nameless, faceless (and unpaid)
editor for some obscure campus publication.
The Stanford Review's troubles came in the
wake of two earlier fatalities in the jungle of
journals: Live Oak, the weekly
feature/newspaper which arose last fall, and
the ASSU Course Review, a yearly class
evaluation report which has been replaced by a
tri-annual Course Guide.
Announcing Live Oak's demise earlier this
quarter, Editor Fred Bierman bewailed
financial and staff deficits. Actually, the latter
may have been caused by the former.
Competing against the Stanford Daily for
staffers, Live Oak could not afford to pay
salaries, while the Daily paid nominally.
The Course Review's finis resulted from an
amalgamation of woes which included political

disputes with some members of the ASSU
Senate but were largely staff/financial-orient-
ed.
Course Review detractors wanted graduate
courses added to the publication, but
then-Editor Valarie Tonat said, "We can't even
find wnters to cover the courses now, since we
ca m^ pay ~ .. , jj j?
The new Course Guide appears headed for
subsidy from the ASSU Publications Board,

mi. n l n j™b Board .
The Pub Board administers a reservoir of
ads which m c rt ' than 15 student
publications top. Bu Board Chairman-elect
Tim Portwood said that, as a general rule,
"Certain [board] members would be
continually suspicious and resentful of paying
money that would go to staffers." He admitted
there was "not a very well-defined policy, per
se" on money for salaries.
Aside from some smaller publications that
are not professionally typeset and thus use
funds to pay students to compose their
columns of type, only the Guide is slated for
salary funding (the Daily gets no Pub Board
subsidy).
Will troubled publications not. affiliated
with some political or social cause from which
to draw workers (such as the Stanford Review

or any successor to Live Oak) turn to the Pub
Board for funding to pay needed staffers? The
answer may depend on whether the money is
there,

If publications urn to the board for help in
ami thus keeping staffers, the reserve
eould last for a considerably shorter penod.

turn. Though some pubhcations now receive

those subsidies.
If cutbacks indeed hit that source, and if
staff-short publications need a financial shot in
the arm, they then will be forced to allay the
"suspicions" of some board members, and hope
that students are willing to continue
bankrolling the whole deal.
