Most heinous crime! The law
school graffiti boards have come
a tumbling down with nary a
whimper of student input.
Sublimation of frustrated
student creativity is not the
answer When and where will the
University erect new boards?
Twenty feet high around the
new faculty Levittown? Around
UGLY? The first 50 feet of
Hoover Tower? Is it possible to
have an ASSU referendum to
pick a site?—M,D.
There'll be a lot of
construction in the near future
but no guaranteed fencing,
according to John Lerry,
manager of construction and
engineering. Lerry said that the
University leaves the question of
fencing up to the contractor,
who has his choice of how to
comply with safety standards.
However, you may be in luck.
Carl Olson and Sons, who built
the law school, are also bidding
on the new chemistry building,
which will be at the corner of
Roth Way and Campus Drive.
And in a year or so there will be
a whole new main library.

Your other suggestions seem
pretty much out of the question.
Hoover Tower and UGLY are
decent-looking buildings and a
20-foot wall is probably not tall
enough to effectively cover the
abominable emeritus housing.

What are the policing powers of
agents of the state Alcoholic
Beverage Control? Can they
require bar patrons to show ID?
If minors are then found to be
drinking, can these agents arrest
them?—R.B.
An investigator for the ABC
said that its agents have peace
officer status in and around
premises licensed to sell
alcoholic beverages.
Consequently, they can ask
drinkers to show their IDs and,
if they refuse, can also arrest
them. However, the investigator
emphasized that ABC agents
don't often "throw people in the
clink." Generally, they simply
issue citations to the recalcitrant
minors.

Can you find out whatever
happened to Tom Lehrer, that

folk singer who was such a big
sensation with "That Was the
Year That Was" about 10 years
ago? He was a professor before
he turned to concerts, and the
last I heard of him he was
teaching math at UC Santa Cruz
— that, however, was an
unsubstantiated rumor—H.B.
Your rumor is hereby
substantiated. Tom Lehrer has
taught at Santa Cruz every
winter quarter since 1972. The
rest of the time he lives in
Cambridge, Mass.
Although he first taught math
at Santa Cruz (actually at Cowell
College at UC Santa Cruz) he has
begun branching out. This year
his courses were "The American
Musical Comedy: 40 Years On"
and "Mathematics and the Social
Sciences." Both had very high
enrollments, according to Sue
Hill, administrative assistant at
Cowell College.
Hill didn't know what Lehrer
does the rest of-the year. "I ask
him all the time what he's doing
in Cambridge, and he smiles and
says 'just bumming around,' "
she said.

require bar patrons to show ID?
If minors are then found to be
drinking, can these agents arrest
them?—R.B.
An investigator for the ABC
said that its agents have peace
officer status in and around
premises licensed to sell
alcoholic beverages.
Consequently, they can ask
drinkers to show their IDs and,
if they refuse, can also arrest
them. However, the investigator
emphasized that ABC agents
don't often "throw people in the
clink." Generally, they simply
issue citations to the recalcitrant
minors.

Can you find out whatever
happened to Tom Lehrer, that

folk singer who was such a big
sensation with "That Was the
Year That Was" about 10 years
ago? He was a professor before
he turned to concerts, and the
last I heard of him he was
teaching math at UC Santa Cruz
— that, however, was an
unsubstantiated rumor—H.B.
Your rumor is hereby
substantiated. Tom Lehrer has
taught at Santa Cruz every
winter quarter since 1972. The
rest of the time he lives in
Cambridge, Mass.
Although he first taught math
at Santa Cruz (actually at Cowell
College at UC Santa Cruz) he has
begun branching out. This year
his courses were "The American
Musical Comedy: 40 Years On"
and "Mathematics and the Social
Sciences." Both had very high
enrollments, according to Sue
Hill, administrative assistant at
Cowell College.
Hill didn't know what Lehrer
does the rest of-the year. "I ask
him all the time what he's doing
in Cambridge, and he smiles and
says 'just bumming around,' "
she said.


Most heinous crime! The law
school graffiti boards have come
a tumbling down with nary a
whimper of student input.
Sublimation of frustrated
student creativity is not the
answer When and where will the
University erect new boards?
Twenty feet high around the
new faculty Levittown? Around
UGLY? The first 50 feet of
Hoover Tower? Is it possible to
have an ASSU referendum to
pick a site?—M,D.
There'll be a lot of
construction in the near future
but no guaranteed fencing,
according to John Lerry,
manager of construction and
engineering. Lerry said that the
University leaves the question of
fencing up to the contractor,
who has his choice of how to
comply with safety standards.
However, you may be in luck.
Carl Olson and Sons, who built
the law school, are also bidding
on the new chemistry building,
which will be at the corner of
Roth Way and Campus Drive.
And in a year or so there will be
a whole new main library.

Your other suggestions seem
pretty much out of the question.
Hoover Tower and UGLY are
decent-looking buildings and a
20-foot wall is probably not tall
enough to effectively cover the
abominable emeritus housing.
