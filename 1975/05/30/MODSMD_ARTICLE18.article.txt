## Take Two Eastwood Flops In 'Eiger Sanction' 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
Every movie needs a director
to keep a firm control over the
production, to oversee it from
its inception to its premiere.
Unfortunately for The Eiger
Sanction, Clint Eastwood,
director and star, seems to have
forgotten he was supposed to be
behind the camera as well as in
front and concentrated on his
performance (if you can call

what Eastwood does acting)
rather than on the overall
quality of the movie. His
carelessness was glaringly
apparent throughout the film.
Everything that happens is
inexplicably convenient. Never
has there been a movie that
takes itself so seriously while

being so contrived.
Characters magically turn up
wherever they are needed to
advance a plot concerned with
Jonathan Hemlock's (Eastwood)
retaliation for the murder of an
American CIA agent, who just
happened to save Hemlock's life
in Korea.
Even though art professor
Hemlock is retired, he takes the
job. He also just happens to have
been a mountain climber before
he turned to the academic life,
and the man he is looking for
just happens to be on an
expedition to climb Eiger
mountain in Switzerland. What a
coincidence!
Hemlock goes off to train at
the Monument Valley ranch of

Ben Bowman (George Kennedy),
an old friend of his. When we
first meet Bowman, it seems like
Eastwood the director said,
"Talk fast, George!," because he
talks a mile-a-minute in that one
scene, after which he talks
normally. I guess aftei roles in
Earthquake and Airport 1975,
he forgot what a good script
was.
Pursuing a very foxy Indian

girl (who takes off her blouse as
incentive) for training, Eastwood
somehow manages not to sweat,
even with a pack on his back,
I think that's preserving his
reputation for being cool a little
too much.
It is a well-known fact that
Eastwood has no acting ability.

He is the personification of
sullenness, and even his
reputation and attraction can
not keep our interest throughout
the long and drawn-out scenes of
him training.
His direction, amazingly, is
worse than his acting. The
screenplay occasionally blurts
out a witty line, but most
lines fail miserably, as does the

movie as a whole: it is trite to
the point of disbelief.
The entire production then
reeks of shoddiness. The fights
are so poorly staged that
they're unintentionally funny.
Hands are poised
mysteriously for what passes as
suspense. Will they push
Eastwood off the mountain? No
such luck.
1 mean, when you're going to
grab someone, you don't wait
for the audience to gasp. Rocks

placed to slide when a climber
steps on them are obvious,
standing out like a sore thumb.
When Eastwood slips and
slides and drops his climbing
gear in trying to save a fellow
climber, he does it in such an
obvious and uncoordinated way
that one wonders how capable
he is at handling both acting and
directing. But there's no need to
wonder very long.
At two hours and 10 minutes,
The Eiger Sanction is way too
long and overpadded with
superfluous characters. What
apparently happened is
Eastwood wanted to make a
movie about mountain climbing
and the beginning was shoddily
constructed so that the climax
would take place on the Eiger
with the assassin.
If it was supposed to be
suspenseful, something went
haywire, because it was very
easy to stop caring about who
the assassin was long before they
ever got to the mountain. This
could have been an excellent
vehicle to discuss the rationale
of men who take their lives into
their own hands simply to
conquer a mountain.
Instead, Eastwood chooses to
ignore the entire mystique of
mountain-climbing and
concentrated on the absurd plot.
The closest we get to
learning about what goes on in
the heads of the climbers is
when a female journalist asks
Ben Bowman, the ground man
for the Eiger expedition, "Mr.
Bowman, in your opinion, do
the men climb mountains to
prove their manhood or to
compensate for their
inferiority? " to which Bowman
replies, "Lady, why don't you
get yourself screwed? It'll do
you a lot of good." That's about
as subtle as the movie gets.
What is ultimately so
misleading and disappointing
about this movie is its
meaninglessness and waste. It is
as unnecessary as Eastwood's job
of retaliation. Eventually it turns
out that Hemlock didn't even
have to climb the mountain to
get the man he was looking for.
He could have killed him at the
beginning and saved us all that
time.

HIS ONLY FAN—Clint Eastwood, star and director of "The Eiger Sanction," pauses on his trek up
Eiger Mountain with George Kennedy to kiss an affectionate cow. After Eastwood's acting and
directing performances in this flick a cow may be all Eastwood has left. Moo moo.
