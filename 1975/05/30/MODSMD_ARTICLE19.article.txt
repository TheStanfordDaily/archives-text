# Once Around The Turntable
## Sunshiny Jazz For Ramsey 
### 
Ramsey Lewis
Sun Goddess
Columbia KC 33194
Sun Goddess has been out for
a while, but since it's spring and
the rays are falling from blue
skies it's time for sunshiny jazz.
And this is it.
Ramsey Lewis has made a
"god-like'' cut with "Sun
Goddess,'' but the album itself
falls short of technical
perfection. Barely.
The title song is a blend of
instrumentation and the vocals
of Earth, Wind and Fire. It's a
song to go with bright warm
days and suntan lotion and
beautiful babes and lying
horizontal and vegetating. It
flows smoothly and (alas) ends
too soon.
The other two cuts on the
first side, Stevie Wonder's
"Living For The City" and
Lewis's "Love Song" are
excellent but not quite equipped

to follow "Sun Goddess" (but
perhaps nothing is).
The flip side is sort of bizarre,
beginning with an odd
jungle-jazz hop-hop entitled
"Jungle Strut" or "Obirin Aiye
MirelleKoso" depending on your
point of view.
It brings to mind Abbott and
Costello Go To The Congo or
Tarzan Meets The Bongo
Salesman and involves a lot of
shouting between the music. But
it's not bad.
Then comes "Hot Dawgit,"
another of the Earth, Wind and
Fire productions, and a
not-as-good-as-the-first-one cut.
"Tambura" and "Gemini
Rising" are the last two cuts on
the flip side, and not exactly

typical of Ramsey Lewis. A little
more complex than the usual
stuff but also not too bad.
Of course, it's difficult to
judge any of the songs after the
title cut has been played.
Perhaps Ramsey would have
been better off doing a longer
"Sun Goddess" or something. As
it is, the album is Herculean, but
not quite a deity. I can't
complain.
