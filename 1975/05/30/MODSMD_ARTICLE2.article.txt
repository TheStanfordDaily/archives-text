## Is Experience For Credit Valid? 
### KATHY CUNNINGHAM 
Last of Four Parts
Though many students claim
benefit from non-textbook,
out-in-the-field . Stanford academic
programs, some administrators
apparently consider the granting of
credit for such activity incongruous
with what a university education
should be.
Opportunities for experiential
learning currently are available
through a tutoring program in the
School of Education, and work at the
Hopkins Marine Statibn, the human
biology primate facility or the
Learning Assistance Center, among
many other programs.
But receiving credit for outside
work seems at variance with what
some administrators feel a university
education should be. Two years ago,
then-Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Doug Davis proposed that students
working with professionals in the field
be, granted 12 to 15 units of credit for
their off-campus work.
Davis is now Dean of Students at
the University of San Francisco, but
current Asst. Dean Mike Closson, who
served on the Davis task force, says the
plan was scrapped because the
Provost's Office wanted to "build in so
many controls or academic
mechanisms that it became contrived."
Miller's Questions
The proposal was approved by the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
in spring 1973, but Provost William
Miller raised questions about the
academic validity of giving students a
full quarter's worth of credit for
non-classroom activities, Closson said.
The controversy centered around
the question of "what's education and
what's academic," Closson continued.
Davis, among others, considered it
good to get out of the University to
get a perspective on one's education
and vocational plans, Closson said.
Others in the University throught
then, and think now, that a Stanford
education shouldn't try to be all things
to all people.

Lyman Subscribes
Both Miller and President Richard
Lyman subscribe to that view. Dean of
Students Affairs James Lyons also is
reluctant to see the University grant
credit for extra-curricular activities.
"Stanford is here to educate

students in a classroom context. t That
doesn't mean that non-classroom
activities are not educational. They
are. But the University should provide
something that's not available
elsewhere," Lyons said.
He warned against a tendency for
the University to become a "glorified,
professional trade school. Outside
activities should complement, rather
than provide a substitute for the
traditional functions of the University
that is, providing a liberal
education."
Publicity
Since the Davis report, Closson said
his efforts have shifted to publicizing
the off-campus options for students
who want to stop-out, instead of

promoting the experiences by setting
up a credit-granting inducement.
Closson's approach is shared by
others in the University who value the
out-of-classroom learning experience.
Just recently, the Dean of Students
Affairs Office, Career Planning and
Placement Center and SCIRE held a
meeting for students who are
considering a stop-out, to explain how
to take a leave of absence and what
others have done during their time
away from Stanford.
But more and more a liberal college
education is being viewed as an
investment that doesn't pay off. As
one student said, "A degree in a majpr
like history or English is the best
prerequisite for unemployment."
