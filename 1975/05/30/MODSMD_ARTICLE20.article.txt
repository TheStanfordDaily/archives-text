## New Orleans Takes Center In First Round Kelley, Trobbe Picked For NBA 
### JIM WASCHER 
The New Orleans Jazz
yesterday selected Stanford
All-American center Rich Kelley
in the first round of the annual
National Basketball Association
(NBA) draft. Kelley was the
seventh player chosen by the
pros.
In the ninth round, the NBA
champion Golden State Warriors
drafted Scott Trobbe, a two-year
starter for the Cards at forward.
Kelley, a senior from Menlo
Park, said yesterday that the
Jazz "had a lot of trouble at
center this season, with five or
six guys going in and out. One
reason I'm really excited about
the Jazz is that I know 111 have
as good a shot as anyone" at the
starting center spot.
Soon after the first round was
completed yesterday, Kelley
received phone calls from
principal team owner Sam
Battistone, general manager Bill
Bertha and coach Butch van
Breda Kolff.
The seven-footer refused to
say how much the Jazz had
offered him, but added that he
and his agents, Lewis Schaffel
and Jerry Davis, were close to an
agreement with the team. "We'll
probably settle within a week,"
Kelley said. "Hopefully, I'll sign
before the ABA drafts" next
month.
L.A. Summer League
Kelley and several other
young New Orleans team
members will play this summer
in a 10-team Los Angeles league
composed entirely of pro
players. Each team in the league
will play three games a week,
Kelley said.
Trobbe said he had known
since spring vacation that the

Warriors would choose him. He
met with the Warriors' head
scout while visiting Honolulu,
and"he told me he was planning
to draft me in the late rounds."
The 6-foot-6 senior from
Tiburon said he would attend
the Warriors' rookie camp this
summer, but pointed out that
"not too many people past the
third or fourth rounds get the
opportunity to play or even to
make the team. The chances are
pretty slim, and I realize that,
but I am still very excited about
it."
Play In Europe
So Trobbe said he planned
"to get over to Europe and

travel around" next year. "If I
get to play and get paid for it,
then that's an opportunity I
can't pass up." Observers say
Trobbe's showing in the draft
will improve his chances for
signing with a European
professional team.
Besides Kelley, three other
Pacific Eight players were among
the first 20 drafted yesterday. In
the first round, the Los Angeles
Lakers picked UCLA's
Ail-American forward Dave
Meyers. He was the second
player chosen in the draft
(North Carolina State's David
Thompson went first, to the
Atlanta Hawks).

The 15th pro pick was USC's
John Lambert, a 6-10 center
drafted by the Cleveland
Cavaliers. Lambert's teammate,
guard Gus Williams, was selected
by the Warriors early in the
second round — and was the
20th player drafted by an NBA
team.
Other Players Drafted
Other players drafted in the
first round were: 3. Morgan
State center Marvin "the Eraser"
Webster, Atlanta; 4. Oklahoma
junior Alvan Adams, Phoenix; 5.
Florida high school star Darryle
Dawkins, Philadelphia. Dawkins
was the first high school player
ever drafted by the NBA.

The remaining first round
selections: 6. Arizona State
guard Lionel Hollins, Portland;
7. Kelley; 8. Louisville forward
Junior Bridgeman, Los Angeles;
9. Jackson State forward Eugene
Short, New York; 10. DePaul
forward Bill Robinzine, New
Orleans. The Jazz immediately
traded Robinzine to Kansas
City-Omaha for second-year
forward Ron Behagen.
Other top choices included:
11. Southern Illinois
forward-center Joe Meriweather,
Houston; 12. University of
Seattle guard Frank Oleynick,
Seattle; 13. Penn forward-guard
Bob Bigelow, KC-Omaha.
