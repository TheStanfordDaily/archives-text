# IM Roundup
## Duck Hunt Set Today 
### Pete Bhatia 
IM's for this academic season
come to a close with the
finals in volleyball, softball,
horseshoes and duck hunting set
for today.
In volleyball, on the A side,
the top-ranked and two-time
defending champion Theta Delts
will meet the Porf I team, a
Theta Delt non-point-counting
team, in the finals. The match
was scheduled for yesterday but
was postponed a day after a
bachelor party for one of the
Theta Delt team members. That
team member has yet to be
found.
The Duckthieves are led by
their two powerful hitters, Willie
Mannon and the Golden State
Warriors' Scott Trobbe. The

setting is handled by George
McPheeters and Jay Tuthill.
Theta Delt earned its way into
today's final by virtue of a tight
16-14, 15-11 win over friendly
rival JRA.
JRA led the first game 14-11,
but three furious rallies tied the
game and paved the way for the
winners. In the second game,
Theta Delt ran up a 9-1 lead,
before they choked, falling
behind 11-9. Again they came
back, though, and squeaked by
by their winning 15-11 margin.
As for Porf, they upset, sort
of, second seeded El Tigre in
the other semi, 14-16, 15-13,
15-7.
In a match as tight as
security around San Clemente, it

was the superior net play and
hitting of Porf'j Tom Duralde
that made the final difference.
The time of the final match is
still under negotiation, but we
can assure you it will start some
time around 5 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion. If you wish to attend,
the starting time will be available
from the IM office after lunch.
In B volleyball, second seeded
Theta Chi will take on eighth seeded
Biz I in the finals, set for 3 p.m.
at Maples. Theta Chi fought its
way into the finals with a
semifinal win over the sixth
seeded Theta Delt B team. Biz I
got there by virtue of defeating
fourth seeded Parbar in the
semis after taking the top seeded
R.C.A.D. team in the quarters.

In those other finals we
mentioned, Otero (one of the
only two houses on campus that
gives horseshoe scholarships)
meets Biz I in the finals. In
Softball A's, Education meets
Biz I (Biz I, you may have
noticed is in a lot of finals this
quarter), while the B final is
between Orgoz (I don't know
what it means either) and Alpha
Delt, which reportedly will be
distributing free spirit-lifting
cigarettes before the game. And
finally in duck-hunting, the
finals will be between Dick
Harter,"a very, very bad man"
(that's a quote from Bo Bo
Brazil) and Mark Barwig, "a real
ducker" (that's a quote from
Stanford basketball starlet Mike

Simons).

We mentioned the swimming
meet last week, won by SAE,
but we weren't abie to run down
the bevy of records set in that
event. For example, the Theta
Delt 100 Freestyle relay team of
Tevino, Kerman, Dow and
Johannsen set a new national IM
record at :43.2. That broke the
previous national mark of :43.3
held by the University of
Michigan (individuals'names are
not listed in National IM
records). Also, Lloyd
Rodenbaugh of Serra tied the
National IM record for the 50
yard breaststroke with a :28.4
clocking.
And that's all for this week,
folks.

Bhatia Wednesday announced
his engagement to Liz Dahl of
Pullman, Wash. Good tuck, you
sucker!)
