# Major Changes In Store For Women's Sports
## 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
The merger of all men's and
women's sports programs here
under a new Department of
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation will have
profound effects upon women's
athletics.
Because of the consolidation,
women will receive athletic
scholarships for the first time.
Athletic Director Joseph H.
Ruetz says that 11 or 12
scholarships will be awarded to
women for the 1975-76
academic year.
Of the 12 scholarships, Ruetz

says half will go to female
i athletes already at Stanford, two
e apiece in women's tennis,
112 swimming and golf. Incoming
1 freshmen will receive the other
e six, also only in the sports of
s tennis, swimming and golf.
Ruetz explains that "it's
, relatively easy to identify talent
c in these three sports since there
. are national and international
. standards and ladder systems
2 that can furnish a guideline."
) He says he believes the
J number of women's athletics
grants will increase to 20 for the
i 1976-77 academic year.

Currently, 140 male athletes
engaged in intercollegiate sports
receive some athletic scholarship
assistance.
The various department heads
must now establish criteria for
granting scholarships to female
athletes. This could be difficult
in sports such as basketball and
fencing.
'A Lot More Research'
As Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli says,"the
coaches will have to do a lot
more research on women
athletes. They'll have to stay in
contact with the people and
coaches associated with high
school programs."
To finance the women's
grants, Ruetz says he will use
department reserves, at least for
the next several years. By this
fall he hopes to have started a
program similar to the
5000-member Stanford Buck
Club.
The Buck Club finances all
men's athletic scholarships and
raised over $500,000 to support
Stanford athletics this year.
New Funding Program
A joint committee composed
of Buck Club and Stanford
Athletic Board members will
meet this summer to decide on
the form of a new funding
program for women's athletics.
It is possible that the committee
will decide to use the Buck Club
to solicit funds for both men's
and women's sports.
Unlike some other
universities, Stanford makes its
Athletic Department raise all
funds for athletic scholarships.
The department then pays the
money to the University.
At USC, for example, the
university chancellor simply
signs a form that waives the
amount of the athlete's
scholarship.
Ruetz says the "most drastic
move of the merger was putting
both the men's and women's
basketball programs under one

head coach. Since basketball is a
major revenue-producing sport,
other schools tend to avoid any
such change in their programs
like they would the plague."
Pamela Strathairn, former
chairman of women's physical
education, associate director of
the new department and
chairman of the physical
education department, says the
"merger will cut down on a lot
of duplication which has existed
in the Stanford sports program."
She added that "most
universities will see the merger as
a model and not something that
will or can necessarily be copied
exactly."
New Post
Strathairn will have the
opportunity to discuss the new
Stanford set-up with other
schools' women's athletic
representatives when she takes
over as president of the Northern
California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference.
Ruetz and Cavalli have a few
plans for women's athletics
themselves. Cavalli expects to
write more features on female
athletes here next year. Last fall,
Ruetz hired a woman, Nancy
Peterson, as assistant sports
information director to assist
Cavalli with publicity on
women's sports.
Ruetz also says that the
women's basketball games will
be held before the men's varsity
home games next season. He
hopes this move will help expose
more people to women's sports.
Another idea is to have a
women's field hockey game
against California scheduled on
the morning of the
Stanford-California football
game.
Ruetz plans to hire a female
athletic trainer in time for next
year.
But, as Cavalli concludes,
"the women's program is
developing gradually now, and it
still could go in any direction."

Ruetz and Cavalli have a few

Ruetz hired a woman, Nancy

Cavalli with publicity on

"the women's program is
developing gradually now, and it
still could go in any direction."

FINALLY, SCHOLARSHIPS—Sophomore swimmer Vicki Hays is another athlete who may benefit in
a big way from the recent merger of all men's and women's sports programs into a new Department
of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation. Under the new set-up, women will receive athletic
scholarships for the first time.
The merger of all men's and
women's sports programs here
under a new Department of
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation will have
profound effects upon women's
athletics.
Because of the consolidation,
women will receive athletic
scholarships for the first time.
Athletic Director Joseph H.
Ruetz says that 11 or 12
scholarships will be awarded to
women for the 1975-76
academic year.
Of the 12 scholarships, Ruetz

says half will go to female
i athletes already at Stanford, two
e apiece in women's tennis,
112 swimming and golf. Incoming
1 freshmen will receive the other
e six, also only in the sports of
s tennis, swimming and golf.
Ruetz explains that "it's
, relatively easy to identify talent
c in these three sports since there
. are national and international
. standards and ladder systems
2 that can furnish a guideline."
) He says he believes the
J number of women's athletics
grants will increase to 20 for the
i 1976-77 academic year.

Currently, 140 male athletes
engaged in intercollegiate sports
receive some athletic scholarship
assistance.
The various department heads
must now establish criteria for
granting scholarships to female
athletes. This could be difficult
in sports such as basketball and
fencing.
'A Lot More Research'
As Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli says,"the
coaches will have to do a lot
more research on women
athletes. They'll have to stay in
contact with the people and
coaches associated with high
school programs."
To finance the women's
grants, Ruetz says he will use
department reserves, at least for
the next several years. By this
fall he hopes to have started a
program similar to the
5000-member Stanford Buck
Club.
The Buck Club finances all
men's athletic scholarships and
raised over $500,000 to support
Stanford athletics this year.
New Funding Program
A joint committee composed
of Buck Club and Stanford
Athletic Board members will
meet this summer to decide on
the form of a new funding
program for women's athletics.
It is possible that the committee
will decide to use the Buck Club
to solicit funds for both men's
and women's sports.
Unlike some other
universities, Stanford makes its
Athletic Department raise all
funds for athletic scholarships.
The department then pays the
money to the University.
At USC, for example, the
university chancellor simply
signs a form that waives the
amount of the athlete's
scholarship.
Ruetz says the "most drastic
move of the merger was putting
both the men's and women's
basketball programs under one

head coach. Since basketball is a
major revenue-producing sport,
other schools tend to avoid any
such change in their programs
like they would the plague."
Pamela Strathairn, former
chairman of women's physical
education, associate director of
the new department and
chairman of the physical
education department, says the
"merger will cut down on a lot
of duplication which has existed
in the Stanford sports program."
She added that "most
universities will see the merger as
a model and not something that
will or can necessarily be copied
exactly."

New Funding Program
A joint committee composed
of Buck Club and Stanford
Athletic Board members will
meet this summer to decide on
the form of a new funding
program for women's athletics.
It is possible that the committee
will decide to use the Buck Club
to solicit funds for both men's
and women's sports.
Unlike some other
universities, Stanford makes its
Athletic Department raise all
funds for athletic scholarships.
The department then pays the
money to the University.
At USC, for example, the
university chancellor simply
signs a form that waives the
amount of the athlete's
scholarship.
Ruetz says the "most drastic
move of the merger was putting
both the men's and women's
basketball programs under one

head coach. Since basketball is a
major revenue-producing sport,
other schools tend to avoid any
such change in their programs
like they would the plague."
Pamela Strathairn, former
chairman of women's physical
education, associate director of
the new department and
chairman of the physical
education department, says the
"merger will cut down on a lot
of duplication which has existed
in the Stanford sports program."
She added that "most
universities will see the merger as
a model and not something that
will or can necessarily be copied
exactly."

Strathairn will have the
opportunity to discuss the new
Stanford set-up with other
schools' women's athletic
representatives when she takes
over as president of the Northern
California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference.
Ruetz and Cavalli have a few
plans for women's athletics
themselves. Cavalli expects to
write more features on female
athletes here next year. Last fall,
Ruetz hired a woman, Nancy
Peterson, as assistant sports
information director to assist
Cavalli with publicity on
women's sports.
Ruetz also says that the
women's basketball games will
be held before the men's varsity
home games next season. He
hopes this move will help expose
more people to women's sports.
Another idea is to have a
women's field hockey game
against California scheduled on
the morning of the
Stanford-California football
game.
Ruetz plans to hire a female
athletic trainer in time for next
year.
But, as Cavalli concludes,
"the women's program is
developing gradually now, and it
still could go in any direction."

FINALLY, SCHOLARSHIPS—Sophomore swimmer Vicki Hays is another athlete who may benefit in
a big way from the recent merger of all men's and women's sports programs into a new Department
of Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation. Under the new set-up, women will receive athletic
scholarships for the first time.
