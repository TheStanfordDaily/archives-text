# Women's Golfers Win NCIAC
## 
### 
The women's golf team
clinched the Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC)
championship last Friday,
winning the year's final
conference match at the
Stanford Golf Course.
Junior Pat Cornett shot an
even par 73 to pace the Cards to
an 18 stroke edge over their
nearest competitor, Santa Clara.
Cornett's score was one off the
course record for women.
Cornett and teammate Pam
Palmieri, also a junior, won first
team All-Conference honors,
placing first and second,
respectively, for both last
Friday's match and the season.
Cornett's four-tournament score
was 297, while Palmieri's was
307. Pam shot an 81 Friday.
The women's championship
came in their first year of

competition in the five-team
conference, which also includes
Santa Clara, UC Davis.
Sacramento State and San Jose
State. The Cards' four-match
team total was 1417 strokes, to
second-place Santa Clara's 1449.
Sophomore Ellen Sale placed
fifth in last Friday's match,
shooting a 95. Finishing ahead
of Sale were San Jose State's
Shirley Hauter (85) and Santa
Clara's Margaret Leonard (88).
Freshman Sue Hoover shot a
112 to complete the Stanford
scoring.
The Cards had a highly
successful season under coach
Carroll Diaz, placing first in five
out of the seven matches they
competed in, and finishing
second in the remaining two.
Stanford won three out of
four NCIAC meets, placing
second last month at UC Davis.

The women won the Sun
Devil Invitational at Arizona
State April 3-5, with Cornett
leading the field individually.
Ten days later, the Cards placed
second at the California
Collegiate Women's
Championship.
Two weeks ago, Stanford
triumphed in the Daisy Duck
Invitational at Cresswell, Ore.
Cornett defeated defending
women's collegiate champion
Mary Budke of Oregon State to
take first place individually at
the match.
Over spring break, Cornett

also won the women's crown in
the San Francisco City Golf
Tournament (the men's title, by
the way, was won by senior
Dave Baskins from the Stanford
men's team).
Diaz says the NCIAC hopes
to expand its golf schedule next
year to at least five, and possibly
six, meets.
She adds that Cornett,
Palmieri and Sale will represent
Stanford at the Association for
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW) tournament
June 16-21 at Tucson, Ariz. The
AIAW is the women's
counterpart of the NCAA.
