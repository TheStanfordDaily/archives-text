# Young Describes Proposal
## New Baseball League? 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
After a nine-year marriage,
Stanford baseball and the Pac-8
will probably be filing divorce
papers this summer.
The Pac-8 Athletic Directors
will meet in August to discuss
ending the present system of a
Northern and Southern
conference within the Pac-8.
Baseball coach Ray Young
strongly advocates the formation
of a California baseball league,
with Stanford, USC, UCLA, Cal,
Santa Clara "and maybe Santa
Barbara." Young feels this shift
would send better teams to the
NCAA district playoffs.
This year, Pac-8 champion
USC, and a wild-card team
chosen by the Pac-B's Athletic
Directors went to the NCAAs.
The directors chose Northern
conference champion
Washington State. Both teams
were eliminated in division
competition last weekend.
"It's just not right," Young
said. He pointed out that
Washington State was 0-5 against
Southern conference schools,
including a 15-5 loss to
Stanford.
"In the four years that the
Pac-8 played a round-robin," he
added, "a Northern division
team made it into the top four
only once."
Young expects that a
California league would
eliminate such problems. "The

advantage is that this way we
don't get a northern team into
the Pac-8 championship, where
even if they lose badly, they get
to go into another district."
He hopes that the second
place team in a California league
would get a wild-card berth in
the Rocky Mountain district of
the NCAA.
This year, the Pac-B's entries
couldn't make it past districts.
In the double elimination
tournaments, Washington State
survived an 18-2 loss to Arizona
State to make it into the Rocky
Mountain finals, but was
eliminated by the Sun Devils on
Sunday, 5-1.
USC, winner of the last five
College World Series, fared even
worse, getting knocked out by
Pepperdine last Saturday.
Pepperdine rallied for four runs
in the top of the ninth, to post a
5-2 win.
Young wasn't too surprised at
this fall from glory, though
"They had a good team this
year," he said, "but so did a lot
of other schools. Their number
one pitcher was beaten in the
first game, which really hurt
them. They had to come back
with John Racanelli against
Pepperdine, and he's not a first
run pitcher."
If the idea of a California
baseball league comes off, it
won't be anything new. The
California Intercollegiate

Baseball Association, founded in
1927, featured primarily the
same teams Young would like to
see in a new league. It operated
until 1967, when Stanford, USC,
UCLA and Cal were brought
into Pac-8 baseball.
"That used to be the best
league in the country," Young
recalled. So it's little wonder
that he'd like to give a California
league another try.

USC, winner of the last five
College World Series, fared even
worse, getting knocked out by
Pepperdine last Saturday.
Pepperdine rallied for four runs
in the top of the ninth, to post a
5-2 win.
Young wasn't too surprised at
this fall from glory, though
"They had a good team this
year," he said, "but so did a lot
of other schools. Their number
one pitcher was beaten in the
first game, which really hurt
them. They had to come back
with John Racanelli against
Pepperdine, and he's not a first
run pitcher."
If the idea of a California
baseball league comes off, it
won't be anything new. The
California Intercollegiate

Baseball Association, founded in
1927, featured primarily the
same teams Young would like to
see in a new league. It operated
until 1967, when Stanford, USC,
UCLA and Cal were brought
into Pac-8 baseball.
"That used to be the best
league in the country," Young
recalled. So it's little wonder
that he'd like to give a California
league another try.
After a nine-year marriage,
Stanford baseball and the Pac-8
will probably be filing divorce
papers this summer.
The Pac-8 Athletic Directors
will meet in August to discuss
ending the present system of a
Northern and Southern
conference within the Pac-8.
Baseball coach Ray Young
strongly advocates the formation
of a California baseball league,
with Stanford, USC, UCLA, Cal,
Santa Clara "and maybe Santa
Barbara." Young feels this shift
would send better teams to the
NCAA district playoffs.
This year, Pac-8 champion
USC, and a wild-card team
chosen by the Pac-B's Athletic
Directors went to the NCAAs.
The directors chose Northern
conference champion
Washington State. Both teams
were eliminated in division
competition last weekend.
"It's just not right," Young
said. He pointed out that
Washington State was 0-5 against
Southern conference schools,
including a 15-5 loss to
Stanford.
"In the four years that the
Pac-8 played a round-robin," he
added, "a Northern division
team made it into the top four
only once."
Young expects that a
California league would
eliminate such problems. "The

advantage is that this way we
don't get a northern team into
the Pac-8 championship, where
even if they lose badly, they get
to go into another district."
He hopes that the second
place team in a California league
would get a wild-card berth in
the Rocky Mountain district of
the NCAA.
This year, the Pac-B's entries
couldn't make it past districts.
In the double elimination
tournaments, Washington State
survived an 18-2 loss to Arizona
State to make it into the Rocky
Mountain finals, but was
eliminated by the Sun Devils on
Sunday, 5-1.
