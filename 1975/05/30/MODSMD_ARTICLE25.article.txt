Ford Vetoes $5.3 Billion Job Bill
WASHINGTON — President Ford yesterday
vetoed a $5.3 billion package designed to fund
job-producing projects across the nation through
1976.
The action of the President, now on a week-long
trip to Europe, was announced at the White House.
In returning the bill to Congress, Ford declared
in a letter that "this bill ... is not an effective
response to the unemployment problem. It would
exacerbate both budgetary and economic pressures
and its chief impact would be felt long after our
current unemployment problems are expected to
subside."
The President noted that the measure
authorized spending of $3.3 billion above his own
budget request, and almost half of the additional
amount would be allocated in fiscal 1976.
Index Indieates End To Reeession
WASHINGTON — The government reported
yesterday that its index designed to anticipate the
economy's future took the biggest jump ever last
month, providing evidence that the recession has
already ended or will end soon.
But while an end to the recession sometime in
the next few months is just what most economists
expect, the index also provided some sign that the
recovery which follows could be a strong one.
It is the strength of the recovery which will
determine whether or how fast unemployment
recedes from levels of nine percent or so. And the
strength of the nation's economic recovery has
been one of the most uncertain factors in economic
projections so far.
Sanford Enters Demoeratie Raee
WASHINGTON — Former North Carolina Gov.
Terry Sanford entered the race for the 1976
Democratic presidential nomination yesterday.
With George Wallace as his first target, Sanford
declared it is his duty to "show the nation that the
South stands for more than the politics of fear."
Sanford is now the president of Duke
University. In a 17-page statement, he pledged to
"reinstate the American Revolution."
Sanford came to power in North Carolina in the
'60s and is regarded as one of the first "New
South" Democrats who abandoned the party's
traditional reliance on segregationist politics in that
region.
S.F. Doetors May Return Alone
LOS ANGELES — Striking San Francisco
doctors plan to return to work Monday but the

situation remained confused yesterday elsewhere in
California.
Undecided anesthesiologists pondered the state
legislature's action to temporarily alleviate the
crisis brought on by soaring malpractice insurance
rates.
"The going back to work is what I would call
temporary relief, but it is not a permanent cure,"
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said in Los Angeles.
CIA 'Covered Up' Plot
WASHINGTON — The CIA and the Justice
Department withheld information about CIA
involvement in attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro
from members of the Warren Commission
investigating President John F. Kennedy's death,
according to knowledgeable sources.
Two former officials of the Central Intelligence
Agency who acknowledged that the Warren
Commission never was told about a 1961 plot on
the Cuban premier's life insisted that no conscious
decision was made to withhold the information.
Instead, they contend it never occurred to
anyone at the CIA that the Kennedy assassination
could have been ordered by Castro in retaliation
for U.S.-sponsored attempts on his life.
The information withheld concerned a 1961
plot against Castro involving contacts between the
CIA and mobsters Sam Giancana and John Roselli.
The existence of that plot has been confirmed
by two high intelligence sources, and several other
news organizations have reported that the
Rockefeller Commission possesses Justice
Department documents, one reportedly written by
former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, which also
confirm the existence of the Giancana-Roselli plot.
The sources describe the plot as having
originated in the Eisenhower administration and
designed to coincide with the 1961 Bay of Pigs
invasion.
Defense Says Foster's Killers Dead
SACRAMENTO — The killers of Marcus Foster
died in a Los Angeles house where six Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) members met their deaths
last May, SLA member Russell Little's lawyer said
yesterday.
"If society needs vindication for the death of
Foster, does not that vindication lie in the rubble
of the Los Angeles house?" said James Jenner in
his closing argument to the jury.
"The pound of flesh has been exacted."
Little and fellow SLA member Joseph Remiro
are accused in the Nov. 6, 1973 cyanide-bullet
slaying of Foster, Oakland's school superintendent,
and the wounding of his top aide, Robert
Blackburn.

The prosecution lacked an eyewitness who
could place either defendant at the scene but has
accused them of taking part in an SLA conspiracy
to kill Foster.
The case goes to the jury today.
