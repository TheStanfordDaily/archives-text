## 
### 
The University was named as a
co-defendant in a defamation suit filed
Tuesday.
Augusto Martins, a former Medical
School research associate, filed the suit
in Superior Court in Palo Alto against
the University and Dr. Zoltan Lucas,
Martins's former supervisor.
The suit alleges that Martins, whose
work here was terminated in June
1974, was defamed in two reports
filed with the National Institute of
Health (NIH). Martins was studying
immunology under a grant from NIH.
Martins, contacted yesterday, had
no comment on the pending action
because he had been unable to confer

with his attorney.
The reports filed in spring 1974
with NIH said Martins made
"disappointingly slow" progress in the
research and did "unsatisfactory"
work, according to the lawsuit.
Martins confirmed that he has been
unable to find work since leaving here.
He says this was because of the
reports, which he claims were false and
malicious.
University attorneys were unaware
of the suit when contacted yesterday.
Lucas, an associate professor of
surgery at the Medical School, could
not be reached for comment.
