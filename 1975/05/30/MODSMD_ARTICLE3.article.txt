# Minority Grad Admissions Rise
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Minority enrollment has stabilized
while women's enrollment has
increased in graduate and professional
schools. Dean of Graduate Studies
Lincoln Moses announced to the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
Students will no longer receive
credit for satisfactory performance on
language placement examinations as a
result of other Faculty Senate action
yesterday.
The 1974-75 graduate minority
enrollment estimate is 591 students,
down two from last year.
However, a large drop in minority
graduate school applicants was offset
by a much higher percentage of

minority applicants admitted.
Forty-nine percent of applicants were
admitted this year, compared to 28
percent last year, according to report
figures.
Though minority admissions to
professional schools rose, those in
graduate schools decreased by a
corresponding amount. Moses saw this
as a trend among minority students.
"The reduction of minority
entrants to academic degree programs
reflects a dramatic decrease (more
than 50 percent) in applications to the
humilities, and a less sharp (30
percent) reduction in the social
sciences.... The reduction is confined
principally to black applicants. We

believe this is a local manifestation of
a national downward trend in black
applications," Moses stated.
Women Increase
The proportion of women rose in
every school, reaching nine-year highs
everywhere except in non-M.D.
programs in medicine, which already
include a majority of women.
Though the proportion of women
receiving Stanford Ph.D.'s (15 percent)
remains below the national average of
18 percent, "this appears to be wholly
a reflection of Stanford's relatively
heavy concentration in engineering
and the sciences," Moses said.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth commended Dean
Moses' affirmative action programs but
worried that less emphasis was being
placed on them, "now that the heat's
off."
'A Frill'
"I think [affirmative action] is
viewed as a frill and that's the
problem," he said.
"Dean Moses used to send around
memoranda asking 'what's your
department doing about minority
enrollment,' and they don't come
around anymore."
Moses answered that he had a
two-man staff "beating the bushes"
for minority applicants.
Language Affected
Though a unanimous senate vote
struck down awarding of degree credit
on the basis of department placement
exams, only language departments will
be affected. Mathematics and science
departments use the tests purely for
placement.
However, the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(C-AAA) recommendations supported

the present policy of awarding
Advanced Placement credit based on
the standard College Entrance
Examination Board tests. Most
departments offer up to 10 units for
scores of four or five.
The C-AAA objected to credit for
department placement exams because
they award college credit for high
school-level work, while the AP
program is supposedly college-level.
Centralized
"The difference is that the
Advanced Placement program is
centralized and is run in close
conference with the universities and
faculty," argued C-AAA Chairman
Alexander Fetter, professor of physics.
Psychology Prof. Albert Hastorf
objected that the AP program still
"makes it possible for a student to
achieve credit by passing these tests
whether or not his high school has an
AP program."
The senate also approved two new
degrees. The Master of Science in
Management will replace the
degree-less Stanford Sloan Program.
The Master of Arts in Humanities will
be awarded to prospective high school
and junior college humanities teachers.
