# Scher Defends Decision
## 'Helen Reddy Was The Best Choice' 
### DAVE SMITH 
"I definitely thought the concert
would sell," says ASSU Special Events
director Danny Scher, defending his
contracting of pop singer Helen Reddy
for a Frost Amphitheater appearance
last weekend.
Poor advance ticket sales forced
cancellation of the concert.
"At the time I had to make a
decision, there were a bunch of people
I could have had," he says. "Helen
Reddy was the best choice." *
But Randy Phillips, who will take
over Scher's ASSU post after Scher
graduates from Stanford Business
School next month, says he thinks the
idea of booking Reddy for a Stanford
concert was a bad one.
"It's not in Danny [Scher] to
schedule a concert that he knows
won't sell, but I don't think he was as
thoughtful or careful in booking this
one as he has been in the past," says
Phillips.
Worked For Graham
Besides serving as Special Events
head, Scher has worked part-time for
rock promoter Bill Graham this spring.
Scher will join Graham's organization
fulltime on June 9.
Phillips says he believes that Scher's
effectiveness in his ASSU position has

been seriously limited by his
involvement outside Stanford.
"There's no getting around it," says
Phillips. "Working with Graham has
definitely cut down the amount of
time Danny has had for his Stanford
job."
Scher denies any such conflict.
"The only problem I have right now is
trying to graduate," he says. "I'm
under contract with the ASSU. I'm
doing my job. We're making money."
Ad Money Lost
Scher says that the only money lost
on the Reddy concert was that spent
on advertising. "We were able to get
out of the contract without paying
anything," he says. "And that, I might
add, is far from the usual situation.
"We lost less on that show than we
made on the two Firesign Theatre
shows this month," Scher adds. "Here
was something that could have made us
just oodles of money, and trying it
cost us less than two shows in
Dinkelspiel made."
Very few seats for the Reddy
concert had been sold by May 18,
when the decision was made to cancel
the show, according to Phillips. "I
wish I could tell you how many were
sold," he says. "But it's not allowed
under the contract. It was a very small

number."
Scher admitted that he expected
most of his audience to come from
outside of Stanford. "That is the way
with all our concerts; most of the
people we attract are not students," he
says. "It would have been a first, an
absolute first, if this concert had been
any other way."
Phillips estimates that no more than
35 percent of the ASSU Special Events
audiences are Stanford students, but
he says he will base his concerts
primarily on their appeal to students
here.
"We're not going to try to cater to
some 35-year-old couple in the South
Bay," he says. "My first responsibility
is to the students.
For Students
"The important thing to remember
is that we're ASSU Special Events. We
exist for the ASSU. We're not Randy
Phillips Productions or Danny Scher
Productions or anything like that."
Scher says he used the same
procedure to choose Helen Reddy as
he has employed to schedule all other
concerts. "I ask everyone I see," he
states. "I look at how the performers
have been doing nationally, I read the
reviews, I estimate how well they can
do locally.
"In the case of Helen Reddy, she
sold out all her shows at the Circle
Star Theater [in San Mateo]. And
she's a very good person to deal with."
Scher claims that Reddy has been
"selling out wherever she has played."
But one knowledgeable source says
that well under 25 percent of the
Reddy tickets had been sold by the
time the Stanford concert was
cancelled.
Scher currently earns one to two
percent of ASSU Special Events
grosses over $5OOO.

sold," he says. "But it's not allowed
under the contract. It was a very small

number."
Scher admitted that he expected
most of his audience to come from
outside of Stanford. "That is the way
with all our concerts; most of the
people we attract are not students," he
says. "It would have been a first, an
absolute first, if this concert had been
any other way."
Phillips estimates that no more than
35 percent of the ASSU Special Events
audiences are Stanford students, but
he says he will base his concerts
primarily on their appeal to students
here.
"We're not going to try to cater to
some 35-year-old couple in the South
Bay," he says. "My first responsibility
is to the students.
For Students
"The important thing to remember
is that we're ASSU Special Events. We
exist for the ASSU. We're not Randy
Phillips Productions or Danny Scher
Productions or anything like that."
Scher says he used the same
procedure to choose Helen Reddy as
he has employed to schedule all other
concerts. "I ask everyone I see," he
states. "I look at how the performers
have been doing nationally, I read the
reviews, I estimate how well they can
do locally.
"In the case of Helen Reddy, she
sold out all her shows at the Circle
Star Theater [in San Mateo]. And
she's a very good person to deal with."
Scher claims that Reddy has been
"selling out wherever she has played."
But one knowledgeable source says
that well under 25 percent of the
Reddy tickets had been sold by the
time the Stanford concert was
cancelled.
Scher currently earns one to two
percent of ASSU Special Events
grosses over $5OOO.

PROMOTER'S CHOICE—Pop singer Helen Reddy was scheduled to perform
on campus last week but ASSU Speial Events Director Danny Scher cancelled
the event when few tickets were sold.
"I definitely thought the concert
would sell," says ASSU Special Events
director Danny Scher, defending his
contracting of pop singer Helen Reddy
for a Frost Amphitheater appearance
last weekend.
Poor advance ticket sales forced
cancellation of the concert.
"At the time I had to make a
decision, there were a bunch of people
I could have had," he says. "Helen
Reddy was the best choice." *
But Randy Phillips, who will take
over Scher's ASSU post after Scher
graduates from Stanford Business
School next month, says he thinks the
idea of booking Reddy for a Stanford
concert was a bad one.
"It's not in Danny [Scher] to
schedule a concert that he knows
won't sell, but I don't think he was as
thoughtful or careful in booking this
one as he has been in the past," says
Phillips.
Worked For Graham
Besides serving as Special Events
head, Scher has worked part-time for
rock promoter Bill Graham this spring.
Scher will join Graham's organization
fulltime on June 9.
Phillips says he believes that Scher's
effectiveness in his ASSU position has

been seriously limited by his
involvement outside Stanford.
"There's no getting around it," says
Phillips. "Working with Graham has
definitely cut down the amount of
time Danny has had for his Stanford
job."
Scher denies any such conflict.
"The only problem I have right now is
trying to graduate," he says. "I'm
under contract with the ASSU. I'm
doing my job. We're making money."
Ad Money Lost
Scher says that the only money lost
on the Reddy concert was that spent
on advertising. "We were able to get
out of the contract without paying
anything," he says. "And that, I might
add, is far from the usual situation.
"We lost less on that show than we
made on the two Firesign Theatre
shows this month," Scher adds. "Here
was something that could have made us
just oodles of money, and trying it
cost us less than two shows in
Dinkelspiel made."
Very few seats for the Reddy
concert had been sold by May 18,
when the decision was made to cancel
the show, according to Phillips. "I
wish I could tell you how many were
sold," he says. "But it's not allowed
under the contract. It was a very small

number."
