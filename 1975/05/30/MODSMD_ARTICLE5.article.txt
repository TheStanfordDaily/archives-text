# HUD Okay Wanted For Terrace Housing
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The University will explore
alternate sources of funding for the
proposed Frenchman's Terrace
housing project if the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) rejects the University's
proposed residency restrictions,
according to Robert Augsburger, vice
president for business and finance.
But HUD officials may yet bow to
the University's insistence upon
reserving half of the units in the
project for University employees,
Augsburger said.
Augsburger explained that the
University would prefer to subsidize
units in the project with federal funds
rather than seek help from the private
sector.

HUD officials claim' that the
allocation of half the units to Stanford
employees is illegal according to
Section 8 of the Urban Community
Development Act of 1974, under

which the project would be built.
Although Frenchman's Terrace
would be constructed on University
land, more than half of the units
would be subsidized by federal funds,
so the University must receive HUD
approval.
Prove Benefit
Augsburger said that because the
University land is a trust asset, in order
for the project to be built it is
necessary for the Board of Trustees to
prove that the project would benefit
the University.
According to Augsburger, only a
formal provision to allocate half the
units to University employees will
assure the Trustees that such a benefit
will accrue to the University.
But James Price, HUD's area
director, told the Daily last week that
his office sees absolutely no way
Section 8 could be interpreted to
permit the occupancy restrictions.
