# Future Of Nuclear Power, Energy Problem Debated
## 
### TONY DELLING 
Asserting that an energy policy is the
"greatest problem Congress is trying to thrash
out," Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
last night heard two groups of panelists debate
the question "Is nuclear power safe?"
The debate before an overflow crowd at
Cubberley Auditorium was sponsored by
McCloskey to help answer his "questions"
about nuclear power and to inform the public
on the issue. McCloskey's new legislative
assistant, Egil "Bud" Krogh, presided over the
discussion.
The group opposing immediate further
construction of nuclear power plants
consisted of Paul Valentine, a Palo Alto
attorney, Dr. Leslie Grimm, a radiology
biologist from Seattle, and Dr. Terry La3h, a
staff scientist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
Those favoring expansion of nuclear plants
included Lynn Wallis, a health physicist for
Genral Electric, Michael Peevey, executive
director of the California Council for
Environmental and Economic Balance, and
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Tom Connolly.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Director
Wolfgang Panofsky served as an independent
commentator.
Lash opened the discussion by attacking
the notion that plutonium was "the fuel of
the future." In laboratory animals, said Lash,
"a millionth of a gram [of plutonium]
produces lung cancer.

"Plutonium may be the most toxic
substance known to man," he added.
Wallis disagreed strongly with Lash, saying
"it is not necessarily true that release of
plutonium compromises health." He noted
that "there are many other kinds of dangerous
materials," citing explosives.
Terrorists »
Also, Wallis claimed that "it is extremely
hard" for a terrorist to break into and
threaten a nuclear plant.
At this point Valentine retorted that
security for nuclear materials is not sufficient.
"The [federal] General Accounting Office has
cracked security systems," said Valentine.
Peevey belittled the fears of many that
terrorists could use stolen plutonium to
construct a bomb for purposes of extortion.
"It's not that simple to create a nuclear bomb.
It took India many years to make a bomb."
Save Fossil Fuels
"We should not use fossil fuels which are
needed in other areas [transportation,
chemical production] when .there are
substitutes" such as nuclear power added
Peevey.
Opponents of immediate expansion
emphasized the problems involved in
disposing the waste created in nuclear
reactors.
Valentine asserted that "17 plants have had
to cut back output because of accumulation
of waste."

staff scientist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
Those favoring expansion of nuclear plants
included Lynn Wallis, a health physicist for
Genral Electric, Michael Peevey, executive
director of the California Council for
Environmental and Economic Balance, and
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Tom Connolly.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Director
Wolfgang Panofsky served as an independent
commentator.
Lash opened the discussion by attacking
the notion that plutonium was "the fuel of
the future." In laboratory animals, said Lash,
"a millionth of a gram [of plutonium]
produces lung cancer.

"Plutonium may be the most toxic
substance known to man," he added.
Wallis disagreed strongly with Lash, saying
"it is not necessarily true that release of
plutonium compromises health." He noted
that "there are many other kinds of dangerous
materials," citing explosives.
Terrorists »
Also, Wallis claimed that "it is extremely
hard" for a terrorist to break into and
threaten a nuclear plant.
At this point Valentine retorted that
security for nuclear materials is not sufficient.
"The [federal] General Accounting Office has
cracked security systems," said Valentine.
Peevey belittled the fears of many that
terrorists could use stolen plutonium to
construct a bomb for purposes of extortion.
"It's not that simple to create a nuclear bomb.
It took India many years to make a bomb."
Save Fossil Fuels
"We should not use fossil fuels which are
needed in other areas [transportation,
chemical production] when .there are
substitutes" such as nuclear power added
Peevey.
Opponents of immediate expansion
emphasized the problems involved in
disposing the waste created in nuclear
reactors.
Valentine asserted that "17 plants have had
to cut back output because of accumulation
of waste."

ENERGY PANELISTS—Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), left, and his new legislative
assistant, Egil Krogh, participate in an energy panel last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
Asserting that an energy policy is the
"greatest problem Congress is trying to thrash
out," Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
last night heard two groups of panelists debate
the question "Is nuclear power safe?"
The debate before an overflow crowd at
Cubberley Auditorium was sponsored by
McCloskey to help answer his "questions"
about nuclear power and to inform the public
on the issue. McCloskey's new legislative
assistant, Egil "Bud" Krogh, presided over the
discussion.
The group opposing immediate further
construction of nuclear power plants
consisted of Paul Valentine, a Palo Alto
attorney, Dr. Leslie Grimm, a radiology
biologist from Seattle, and Dr. Terry La3h, a
staff scientist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
Those favoring expansion of nuclear plants
included Lynn Wallis, a health physicist for
Genral Electric, Michael Peevey, executive
director of the California Council for
Environmental and Economic Balance, and
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Tom Connolly.
