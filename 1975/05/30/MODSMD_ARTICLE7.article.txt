I Commencement II
It may be too late to change plans for this year's
commencement exercises, but we hope that the series of
fiascos that characterized preparations for
commencement will not be repeated.
From the selection of Daniel Patrick Moynihan to the
cancelling of traditional department ceremonies, the
University admistration has made decisions that have
been consistently unpopular with the students, for whose
benefit the exercises exist in the first place. The
administration should have been far more sensitive to
student opinion, and we hope that, if nothing else, the
University officials will show more perception next year.
i Much of the blame must lie with the senior class
officers, supposedly the voice of student opinion in
commencement decisions. Why did they let things get so
out of hand? We hope their successors will be
considerably more earful in soliciting student opinion,
and more effective in seeing that student wishes are
carried out, especially on such issues as the
commencement speaker. There can be no excuse for an
unpopular and unwanted speaker like Moynihan, or for a
miserable commencement, as this year's threatens to be
for graduates.
Open Meetings
The recent demonstration protesting the Engineering
and Communication Departments' contract with Iran
helped bring about one immediate, positive result: the
holding of an open meeting of the University's
Committee on Research.
Such open meetings should be considered by all
University committees pondering controversial policy
decisions. However, we hope that the opening of the
Committee on Research meeting was not merely an
attempt to appease opponents of the Iran contract.
At the open meeting, several students and faculty
members presented arguments against the committee's
decision not to ban the contract. These arguments should
not be dismissed lightly; if they are, then the purpose of
the open meeting will be defeated.
Save The Whales
Despite the imminent threat of extinction for sperm
whales and international accords that call for a
moratorium on whaling, large and highly efficient
whaling fleets continue to operate out of Japan and the
Soviet Union.
Several steps seem necessary in this case: first, that
these two governments agree to abide by international
accords; second, that effective substitutes for sperm oil
be developed so that whaling will never again be
necessary; and third, that, until the Russians and
Japanese stop whaling, Americans consider the boycott
of Japanese and Russian goods that some conservationists
have proposed,


'WE HAVE BEFORE US A MOTION TO RECONSIDER A
VOTE TO TABLE AN APPEAL OF A RULING THAT A
POINT OF ORDER WAS NOT IN ORDER AGAINST A
MOTION TO TABLE ANOTHER POINT OF ORDER
AGAINST A MOTION TO BRING TO A VOTE THE MOTION
TO CALL UP THE RESOLUTION THAT WOULD INSTITUTE
THE RULES CHANGE. I MOVE WE TABLE THE MOTION!'

University officials will show more perception next year.
i Much of the blame must lie with the senior class
officers, supposedly the voice of student opinion in
commencement decisions. Why did they let things get so
out of hand? We hope their successors will be
considerably more earful in soliciting student opinion,
and more effective in seeing that student wishes are
carried out, especially on such issues as the
commencement speaker. There can be no excuse for an
unpopular and unwanted speaker like Moynihan, or for a
miserable commencement, as this year's threatens to be
for graduates.
Open Meetings
The recent demonstration protesting the Engineering
and Communication Departments' contract with Iran
helped bring about one immediate, positive result: the
holding of an open meeting of the University's
Committee on Research.
Such open meetings should be considered by all
University committees pondering controversial policy
decisions. However, we hope that the opening of the
Committee on Research meeting was not merely an
attempt to appease opponents of the Iran contract.
At the open meeting, several students and faculty
members presented arguments against the committee's
decision not to ban the contract. These arguments should
not be dismissed lightly; if they are, then the purpose of
the open meeting will be defeated.
Save The Whales
Despite the imminent threat of extinction for sperm
whales and international accords that call for a
moratorium on whaling, large and highly efficient
whaling fleets continue to operate out of Japan and the
Soviet Union.
Several steps seem necessary in this case: first, that
these two governments agree to abide by international
accords; second, that effective substitutes for sperm oil
be developed so that whaling will never again be
necessary; and third, that, until the Russians and
Japanese stop whaling, Americans consider the boycott
of Japanese and Russian goods that some conservationists
have proposed,


'WE HAVE BEFORE US A MOTION TO RECONSIDER A
VOTE TO TABLE AN APPEAL OF A RULING THAT A
POINT OF ORDER WAS NOT IN ORDER AGAINST A
MOTION TO TABLE ANOTHER POINT OF ORDER
AGAINST A MOTION TO BRING TO A VOTE THE MOTION
TO CALL UP THE RESOLUTION THAT WOULD INSTITUTE
THE RULES CHANGE. I MOVE WE TABLE THE MOTION!'

I Commencement II
It may be too late to change plans for this year's
commencement exercises, but we hope that the series of
fiascos that characterized preparations for
commencement will not be repeated.
From the selection of Daniel Patrick Moynihan to the
cancelling of traditional department ceremonies, the
University admistration has made decisions that have
been consistently unpopular with the students, for whose
benefit the exercises exist in the first place. The
administration should have been far more sensitive to
student opinion, and we hope that, if nothing else, the
University officials will show more perception next year.
