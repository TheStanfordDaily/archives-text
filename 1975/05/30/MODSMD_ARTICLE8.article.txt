# Separate Bio Graduation Vetoed
## 
### Wolf, et al 
As all seniors are now aware, the
University has decided to confer all B.S.
and B.A. degrees in Humanities and
Sciences at a single ceremony.
A number of biology students, including
the Biology Bridge staff, find this
arrangement to be unsatisfactory. We feel
that a ceremony involving 1100 people will
be an impersonal and tedious experience for
graduates and their families
After consulting a number of graduating
seniors in biology, we opted to organize our
own graduation ceremony for seniors in the
Biology Department to follow address by
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
After receiving the encouragement of a
number of faculty members, we proceeded
to make arrangements for the ceremony. We
felt that it was necessary to fully investigate
and solve the logistic problems of arranging
the ceremony in order to optimize our
chances for obtaining permission from the
University.
Having solved these problems, it seemed
that the University would have no valid
reasons for preventing the ceremony,
especially siTice there would be no expense
to the University.
We secured a list of student volunteers to
provide the necessary labor for general
organization and chair setup. We recognized
the possibility that student volunteer labor
might constitute a violation of the
University's contract with United Stanford
Employees union (USE). We consulted with
union spokespersons Jim Berk and Glenda

Jones, who assured us that student labor, in
this case, did not violate the contract.
The relevant clause of the contract is
under section B (2), entitled "Work by
Individuals not in the Bargaining Unit":
"Work regularly and customarily
performed by workers shall not be
performed by individuals not in the
bargaining unit to the extent that it directly
results in a worker's layoff or removal to a
lower classification."
It is clear that student work on our
ceremony did not violate this clause, so we
proceeded to reserve 400 chairs from Abbey
Rentals, to be delivered to the Biology
Department for the graduation ceremony.
We initially considered soliciting donations
from bio students to pay for chair rental,
but several faculty members objected, and it
was agreed that the ceremony should be
financed by the department's gift fund.
The only remaining obstacle to our
departmental graduation is obtaining our
diplomas from the University. After
pleading with the President's office, the
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, the Office of Public Events and
Vice President for Public Affairs Bob
Rosenzweig in University Relations, we
have been refused this request.
They claim that they can't allow biology
to have their own ceremony without
making similar arrangements for the other
"less affluent" departments. The dean's
office claims that it is essential to preserve
the integrity of the School of Humanities

and Sciences (H&S) by holding one
ceremony for all H & S students.
Rosenzweig says to forget it, since he
doesn't believe that the union would ever
allow students to set up chairs.
When we told Rosenzweig that the union
had no objections to student labor in this
case, he said that the union hasn't read their
own contract. We refer Rosenzweig to
section B (2) of the USE contract. In
addition, we resent his attempt to blame the
union for the bureaucratic decision to block
the Biology Department graduation
ceremony.
The argument for an integral ceremony
for all H & S students is absurd- Who cares?
A student graduating in psychology would
probably prefer that the biology graduates
went somewhere else to receive their
degrees in order to shorten the ceremony.
Finally, the cost and difficulty incurred
in arranging ceremonies for the "less
affluent" departments would be minimal,
since these are the smallest departments in
Humanities and Sciences. This would be
especially true if students in these
departments felt strongly enough about
graduation to organize their own
ceremonies.
We can only conclude that the University
has refused to release our diplomas in order
to avoid a change in policy which might
embarrass the commencement speaker.

seniors in biology, we opted to organize our
own graduation ceremony for seniors in the
Biology Department to follow address by
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
After receiving the encouragement of a
number of faculty members, we proceeded
to make arrangements for the ceremony. We
felt that it was necessary to fully investigate
and solve the logistic problems of arranging
the ceremony in order to optimize our
chances for obtaining permission from the
University.
Having solved these problems, it seemed
that the University would have no valid
reasons for preventing the ceremony,
especially siTice there would be no expense
to the University.
We secured a list of student volunteers to
provide the necessary labor for general
organization and chair setup. We recognized
the possibility that student volunteer labor
might constitute a violation of the
University's contract with United Stanford
Employees union (USE). We consulted with
union spokespersons Jim Berk and Glenda

Jones, who assured us that student labor, in
this case, did not violate the contract.
The relevant clause of the contract is
under section B (2), entitled "Work by
Individuals not in the Bargaining Unit":
"Work regularly and customarily
performed by workers shall not be
performed by individuals not in the
bargaining unit to the extent that it directly
results in a worker's layoff or removal to a
lower classification."
It is clear that student work on our
ceremony did not violate this clause, so we
proceeded to reserve 400 chairs from Abbey
Rentals, to be delivered to the Biology
Department for the graduation ceremony.
We initially considered soliciting donations
from bio students to pay for chair rental,
but several faculty members objected, and it
was agreed that the ceremony should be
financed by the department's gift fund.
The only remaining obstacle to our
departmental graduation is obtaining our
diplomas from the University. After
pleading with the President's office, the
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, the Office of Public Events and
Vice President for Public Affairs Bob
Rosenzweig in University Relations, we
have been refused this request.
They claim that they can't allow biology
to have their own ceremony without
making similar arrangements for the other
"less affluent" departments. The dean's
office claims that it is essential to preserve
the integrity of the School of Humanities

and Sciences (H&S) by holding one
ceremony for all H & S students.
Rosenzweig says to forget it, since he
doesn't believe that the union would ever
allow students to set up chairs.
When we told Rosenzweig that the union
had no objections to student labor in this
case, he said that the union hasn't read their
own contract. We refer Rosenzweig to
section B (2) of the USE contract. In
addition, we resent his attempt to blame the
union for the bureaucratic decision to block
the Biology Department graduation
ceremony.
The argument for an integral ceremony
for all H & S students is absurd- Who cares?
A student graduating in psychology would
probably prefer that the biology graduates
went somewhere else to receive their
degrees in order to shorten the ceremony.
Finally, the cost and difficulty incurred
in arranging ceremonies for the "less
affluent" departments would be minimal,
since these are the smallest departments in
Humanities and Sciences. This would be
especially true if students in these
departments felt strongly enough about
graduation to organize their own
ceremonies.
We can only conclude that the University
has refused to release our diplomas in order
to avoid a change in policy which might
embarrass the commencement speaker.

majoring in biology; Dow Woodward is a
professor of biology; Donald Perkel is an

As all seniors are now aware, the
University has decided to confer all B.S.
and B.A. degrees in Humanities and
Sciences at a single ceremony.
A number of biology students, including
the Biology Bridge staff, find this
arrangement to be unsatisfactory. We feel
that a ceremony involving 1100 people will
be an impersonal and tedious experience for
graduates and their families
