# Gibbs Plans To Leave Position As Undergraduate Studies Dean
## 
### JOHN FREED 
James Gibbs, controversial dean of
undergraduate studies here, plans to
step down from that post, Provost
William Miller announced Monday.
Miller said that Gibbs has asked t*
be relieved of administrative duties no
later than Aug. 31, 1976. Gibbs, an
anthropology professor, will devote his
time to teaching and research at
Stanford.
Gibbs became dean of
undergraduate studies in 1970 after
serving as the first director of the
African and Afro-American studies
program here. His resignation as dean
will coincide with the start of a
sabbatical year in 1976-77.
Gibbs was at the center of two
major controversies this year. One
concerned minority aid; the other, the
phasing out of the Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI) and the Student
Center for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE).
Miller said Gibbs had been

pondering the decision for "some
time," long before this year's protests
over Gibbs recommendations.
Wanted To Teach
"He's always said he didn't consider
it [working as dean] something he
wanted to do forever," Miller
explained. "He wanted to teach last
year and found he couldn't find the
time. But now he's found the time."
The timing of the announcement
was unrelated to the protests,
according to Miller.
Gibbs said last night no one
pressured him to resign and campus
protests had nothing to do with it
either. "My decision was made solely
because I wanted to go back to
teaching and research," he told the
Daily.
"I was teaching this quarter for the
first time in four years. It was about
the time I started to teach that I first
spoke to the provost," Gibbs said.
He first spoke to Miller "about
three or four months ago" and made
the final decision "fairly recently,"
Gibbs added.
Chris Gray, a member of the
Alliance for Radical Change who
helped organize some of the protests
over Gibbs's decisions, thought that
Gibbs should have made his
resignation effective immediately,
rather than in 12 months.
"It's a year too long," Gray
commented. "The Dean of
Undergraduate Studies [position] was
set up to be a facilitator for
education , . . and Dean
Gibbs has done just the opposite."
Gibbs's position on financial aid to
minority students came to light in
February when Live Oak exposed the
existence of a document which has
come to be known as the "Gibbs
Memo."
'Better Minority Mix'
In the memo, sent last Nov. 13 to

Financial Aids Director Robert Huff,
Gibbs noted that a proposed alteration
in financial aid policy for minority
students "may have some advantages
which have not been stated
explicitly."
The memo continued: "The
proposed financial aid packaging is
likely to bring us a different [and I
think better] mix of minority
students."
At the same time the memo was
uncovered, Gibbs was under attack for
suggesting budget cutbacks which
would have eliminated SCIRE and the
Undergraduate Writing Program this
month and SWOPSI, Undergraduate
Specials and Urban Studies next year.
SCIRE has since been given a one-year
extension by Miller for "further
study."
Gibbs proposed an Undergraduate
Special Agency (UNGRASPEL) to
function as an umbrella office for
innovative education.
Critics immediately leaped on both
of Gibbs's suggestions culminating in
an all-night vigil held by Students for
Equity of Old Union and Several
rallies mourning the "death of
undergraduate education."
Office Restructuring
Last fall, Gibbs made several
suggestions to Miller for restructuring
the undergraduate studies office,
including everything from possible
abolition of the office to creating a
vice provost for undergraduate
education.
ASSU Vice President Charlotte
Germane said she was worried that
Gibbs's proposed restructuring could
lead to the office being absorbed into
the office of the dean of Humanities
and Sciences (H&S).
"I think if it just goes into H&S
that any control we [students] have
will disappear," Germane said.
She said the office does have

potential for improving undergraduate
education.
"Just because a lot of people say
this dean [Gibbs] hasn't been
responsive to undergraduates doesn't
mean another one won't be," Germane
concluded.
Miller said that he expects to hear
from the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies on Gibbs's
proposals before setting up a search to
replace him.
Gibbs's major job has been to
implement the recommendations of
the 1960 Study of Education at
Stanford. He has supervised more than

GOODBYE GIBBS—Dean of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs announced
earlier this week that he is resigning from his administrative post no later than
Aug. 31, 1976. The dean came under fire this year during student protests over
changes in minority financial aid and the revamping of SWOPSI and SCIRE.
300 course offerings yearly, including
seminars for entering students,
undergraduate specials, SWOPSI and
SCIRE courses, three inter-school
programs and individually designed
undergraduate majors.
The Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (ODUS) also
established the Academic Information
Center and the Learning Assistance
Center during Gibbs's tenure. In
addition, ODUS funded the Stanford
Review, now on the verge of folding,
and Approaching Stanford.
Gibbs has received several awards
for his teaching, including the
Danforth Foundation's prize.
