# A&P Misinterprets Scholarship
## 
### 
There has been much valuable discussion
recently of the present tenure decision
process. But one issue about the
Appointments And Promotions (A & P)
Committee has never received a thorough
airing.
Reliable senior faculty assure me that the
A & P Committee regularly undertakes to
read seriously not only the outside letters
from eminent authorities evaluating the
candidates' research, but also that research
itself.
Why would the committee read this
research unless to judge its merits, however?
And why judge except on a reliable basis?
But how can such reading give a reliable
basis when, as much evidence suggests, the
committee frequently lacks any expertise in
the candidate's area?
The Sole Authority
As urged last quarter, after all, one main
reason the committee consults outside
letters is that the candidate is often the sole
authority at Stanford in his or her field.
Moreover, any committee member from the
candidate's own department quite properly
withdraws when the committee considers
that candidate.
Thus, the A & P Committee frequently
must be reading research in order to judge
its merits, without being able rationally to
base any serious judgment of merit on that

reading at all.
This problem is compounded by the fact
that many areas, at least in the humanities,
take years to master. The A & P Committee,
however, apparently reviews all the dossiers
in a few months — while its members carry
on their other academic duties as well.
A Real Danger
In such circumstances a real danger exists
that A & P members will prefer their own
uninformed, and perhaps unconsciously
prejudiced, opinions to those of the outside
letters. The overall evaluations of the
committee may thus be contaminated by
ignorance and irrationality.
No institutional guarantee now exists in
the tenuring process to prevent this
contamination. Until such a guarantee is
given, the decisions of the A & P Committee
are therefore surely sometimes suspect.
This conclusion is disturbing. If
contaminated evaluations carry weight in
tenure decisions, bad research may be given
a status which good research is denied. The
result will be a de facto Stanford
sponsorship of ignorance. Yet this
university exists, in part, to increase
knowledge.
I consequently urge an end to the A & P
Committee's current practice of reading
research in order to judge that research,
even when it lacks expertise in the

Robert Howell

candidate's field. This practice, incidentally,
apparently touches more humanities than
sciences candidates, unjust though that fact
looks.
Doubts About Merits
To end these reading habits need not
hinder the committee's legitimate actions. If
it doubts that the outside letters state the
true merits of a candidate's research, the
committee can, for example, solicit more
outside letters or interview the candidate's
Stanford and non-Stanford research
colleagues.
The committee also can continue to help
the dean select the strongest of the tenure
candidates.
Ending these reading habits also implies
no doubts about the character of the A & P
Committee members. Nor does it deny that
their desire to learn all that they can about
the candidate's research is justified. It
simply recognizes that the means now used
in attaining that desire may badly
contaminate the committee's evaluations.
Let me note finally that Stanford's
administration denied me tenure. But that
fact is irrelevant here. I will be disappointed
if the response to this essay concerns my
own tenure case rather than my arguments
for an end to current A& P reading
practices.

that A & P members will prefer their own
uninformed, and perhaps unconsciously
prejudiced, opinions to those of the outside
letters. The overall evaluations of the
committee may thus be contaminated by
ignorance and irrationality.
No institutional guarantee now exists in
the tenuring process to prevent this
contamination. Until such a guarantee is
given, the decisions of the A & P Committee
are therefore surely sometimes suspect.
This conclusion is disturbing. If
contaminated evaluations carry weight in
tenure decisions, bad research may be given
a status which good research is denied. The
result will be a de facto Stanford
sponsorship of ignorance. Yet this
university exists, in part, to increase
knowledge.
I consequently urge an end to the A & P
Committee's current practice of reading
research in order to judge that research,
even when it lacks expertise in the

Robert Howell

candidate's field. This practice, incidentally,
apparently touches more humanities than
sciences candidates, unjust though that fact
looks.
Doubts About Merits
To end these reading habits need not
hinder the committee's legitimate actions. If
it doubts that the outside letters state the
true merits of a candidate's research, the
committee can, for example, solicit more
outside letters or interview the candidate's
Stanford and non-Stanford research
colleagues.
The committee also can continue to help
the dean select the strongest of the tenure
candidates.
Ending these reading habits also implies
no doubts about the character of the A & P
Committee members. Nor does it deny that
their desire to learn all that they can about
the candidate's research is justified. It
simply recognizes that the means now used
in attaining that desire may badly
contaminate the committee's evaluations.
Let me note finally that Stanford's
administration denied me tenure. But that
fact is irrelevant here. I will be disappointed
if the response to this essay concerns my
own tenure case rather than my arguments
for an end to current A& P reading
practices.
(Robert Howell is an assistant professor of
philosophy.)
There has been much valuable discussion
recently of the present tenure decision
process. But one issue about the
Appointments And Promotions (A & P)
Committee has never received a thorough
airing.
Reliable senior faculty assure me that the
A & P Committee regularly undertakes to
read seriously not only the outside letters
from eminent authorities evaluating the
candidates' research, but also that research
itself.
Why would the committee read this
research unless to judge its merits, however?
And why judge except on a reliable basis?
But how can such reading give a reliable
basis when, as much evidence suggests, the
committee frequently lacks any expertise in
the candidate's area?
The Sole Authority
As urged last quarter, after all, one main
reason the committee consults outside
letters is that the candidate is often the sole
authority at Stanford in his or her field.
Moreover, any committee member from the
candidate's own department quite properly
withdraws when the committee considers
that candidate.
Thus, the A & P Committee frequently
must be reading research in order to judge
its merits, without being able rationally to
base any serious judgment of merit on that

reading at all.
This problem is compounded by the fact
that many areas, at least in the humanities,
take years to master. The A & P Committee,
however, apparently reviews all the dossiers
in a few months — while its members carry
on their other academic duties as well.
A Real Danger
In such circumstances a real danger exists
that A & P members will prefer their own
uninformed, and perhaps unconsciously
prejudiced, opinions to those of the outside
letters. The overall evaluations of the
committee may thus be contaminated by
ignorance and irrationality.
