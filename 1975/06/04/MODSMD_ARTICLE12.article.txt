# State Creates Medical Dilemma
## 
### 
In the wake of the recent refusal by
many California anesthesiologists to take
part in non-emergency surgery as a protest
against skyrocketing malpractice insurance
rates, a look at public reaction to this
medical "crisis" might be instructive.
Some two weeks ago, the Daily Editorial
Board, characteristically guided by reflexive
"liberalism," encouraged state legislators to
"act." The paper's response was a typical
one in an age when each inconvenience to
society is met with cries to the government
to "do something."
Perhaps we should look at what is
entailed by the government's "doing
something" in this case, and what is being
attempted by the private sector.
The catalyst for the current dispute is
the upping of malpractice insurance
premiums several fold by carriers such as
Argonaut Insurance Co. of Menlo Park. One
Associated Press report said certain doctors
are now faced with rates of $30,000 a year.
The increases were spurred by extremely
high malpractice judgments rendered by
juries in recent years.
Unable to limit the price tag which can
be applied to a human life, state
governments in Florida and New York have
attacked the problem by making it more
difficult to sue a doctor (by shortening the
relevant statute of limitations and
restricting the "informed consent" of
patients requirement to non-emergency
cases).
The states also have set up special
insurance pools, essentially assigning to
government what previously was a function
of private insurance agencies. California
legislators are considering such a system.
Let us analyze this second response by
the politicians.
Assuming that the amount of judgments
awarded are decreased only nominally by
the new legal procedures previously

outlined, how will the new systems balance?
Damage awards will remain at
approximately their present rate. Insurance
premiums, however, will rise far less under
these government schemes than they would
have under continued private coverage,
officials of the states say.
Well, assuming that the private insurance
companies were making but a normal profit,
there would seem to be a much-widened gap
between the incomes and expenditures of
the private and government insurance pools
— one far bigger than the profit margin.

A little economic sense will tell one that
the money to make up the difference must
come from somewhere. And, indeed, it
does.
In New York's case, according to
Newsweek, the rabbit which emerges from
the politicians' hat is "a special state fund to
provide insurance should the new
association [state pool] become insolvent."
Three guesses who pays for the "special
state fund."
California officials apparently are more
select in their plans. According to a wire
report last week, if and when a new state
insurance pool ran out of funds, doctors in
the state would be "assessed" to provide the
balance. I'd be interested to know how the
eventual total bill to doctors could be lower
than the premiums they were paying in the
first place.

Now consider an alternative to
bureaucracy. Newsday reports that a group
of Long Island doctors are forming an
insurance company which would lower
malpractice premiums by simply excluding
bad doctors from coverage.
Before the company will insure a doctor,
he is investigated by the firm and must be
approved by at least two members of the
founding group which supplied the initial
capital for the whole operation.
But, of course, the company must win
approval from the New York State
Insurance Department for a license to sell
coverage.
Warren Ross, editor of Ergo. .. , a
libertarian publication distributed at Boston
area universities, is not optimistic over the
firm's chances. He writes:
".. . For years, the government has been
requiring insurance companies to offer
medical malpractice insurance (and making
it difficult, if not impossible, for insurance
companies to stop selling it once they've
started). The reason the government had to
do this was because it had forced doctors to
carry malpractice insurance and therefore
insurance companies had to be required to
offer it."
Thus, he implies, the New York firm's
chances of running an unencumbered
operation are not good. Nor are they
improved, we might add, by policies of the
doctors' guild, the American Medical
Association, which frowns upon the type of
competitive distinctions between physicians
implied by the new company's mode of
operation.
As a result, the plans of state
governments probably will be the ones to
which the nation turns to avert a
"malpractice crisis," meaning yet more
power will accrue to the worst
malpractitioner of all.

are now faced with rates of $30,000 a year.
The increases were spurred by extremely
high malpractice judgments rendered by
juries in recent years.
Unable to limit the price tag which can
be applied to a human life, state
governments in Florida and New York have
attacked the problem by making it more
difficult to sue a doctor (by shortening the
relevant statute of limitations and
restricting the "informed consent" of
patients requirement to non-emergency
cases).
The states also have set up special
insurance pools, essentially assigning to
government what previously was a function
of private insurance agencies. California
legislators are considering such a system.
Let us analyze this second response by
the politicians.
Assuming that the amount of judgments
awarded are decreased only nominally by
the new legal procedures previously

outlined, how will the new systems balance?
Damage awards will remain at
approximately their present rate. Insurance
premiums, however, will rise far less under
these government schemes than they would
have under continued private coverage,
officials of the states say.
Well, assuming that the private insurance
companies were making but a normal profit,
there would seem to be a much-widened gap
between the incomes and expenditures of
the private and government insurance pools
— one far bigger than the profit margin.

A little economic sense will tell one that
the money to make up the difference must
come from somewhere. And, indeed, it
does.
In New York's case, according to
Newsweek, the rabbit which emerges from
the politicians' hat is "a special state fund to
provide insurance should the new
association [state pool] become insolvent."
Three guesses who pays for the "special
state fund."
California officials apparently are more
select in their plans. According to a wire
report last week, if and when a new state
insurance pool ran out of funds, doctors in
the state would be "assessed" to provide the
balance. I'd be interested to know how the
eventual total bill to doctors could be lower
than the premiums they were paying in the
first place.

Now consider an alternative to
bureaucracy. Newsday reports that a group
of Long Island doctors are forming an
insurance company which would lower
malpractice premiums by simply excluding
bad doctors from coverage.
Before the company will insure a doctor,
he is investigated by the firm and must be
approved by at least two members of the
founding group which supplied the initial
capital for the whole operation.
But, of course, the company must win
approval from the New York State
Insurance Department for a license to sell
coverage.
Warren Ross, editor of Ergo. .. , a
libertarian publication distributed at Boston
area universities, is not optimistic over the
firm's chances. He writes:
".. . For years, the government has been
requiring insurance companies to offer
medical malpractice insurance (and making
it difficult, if not impossible, for insurance
companies to stop selling it once they've
started). The reason the government had to
do this was because it had forced doctors to
carry malpractice insurance and therefore
insurance companies had to be required to
offer it."
Thus, he implies, the New York firm's
chances of running an unencumbered
operation are not good. Nor are they
improved, we might add, by policies of the
doctors' guild, the American Medical
Association, which frowns upon the type of
competitive distinctions between physicians
implied by the new company's mode of
operation.
As a result, the plans of state
governments probably will be the ones to
which the nation turns to avert a
"malpractice crisis," meaning yet more
power will accrue to the worst
malpractitioner of all.

In the wake of the recent refusal by
many California anesthesiologists to take
part in non-emergency surgery as a protest
against skyrocketing malpractice insurance
rates, a look at public reaction to this
medical "crisis" might be instructive.
Some two weeks ago, the Daily Editorial
Board, characteristically guided by reflexive
"liberalism," encouraged state legislators to
"act." The paper's response was a typical
one in an age when each inconvenience to
society is met with cries to the government
to "do something."
Perhaps we should look at what is
entailed by the government's "doing
something" in this case, and what is being
attempted by the private sector.
The catalyst for the current dispute is
the upping of malpractice insurance
premiums several fold by carriers such as
Argonaut Insurance Co. of Menlo Park. One
Associated Press report said certain doctors
are now faced with rates of $30,000 a year.
