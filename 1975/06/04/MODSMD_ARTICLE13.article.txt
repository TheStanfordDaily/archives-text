# Contract Dehumanizes Education
## 
### 
Mostaar, et al

There has been much
controversy centered around the
contract between the Iranian
government and Stanford to
build a telecommunication
satellite. From a technological
standpoint, the satellite can
potentially and will most
probably consolidate and extend
the capabilities of the military
and police to control the
outlying regions of Iran.
Yet, the contract has been
justified by Prof. Alan Parker of
the Communication Department
on the grounds that the satellite
as a means of transfering
information will increase the
flow of information and can
thereby serve as an efficient

educational tool.
But d i sseminating
information in fragmented form,
which is the only possibility
under oppression, divorced from
the totality which gives it
concreteness, leaves the
impression that occurrences and
situations are not interrelated
and thus not part of an historical
process.
This can only serve to
intensify the paralysis
characteristic of an oppressed
population rather than serving
the purpose of education.
Political Education
Education is political. It's
content and methodology both
embraces and springs from the

social context in which it
operates. Man as an
uncompleted human being has
two possibilities — humanization
and dehumanization. While both
are possibilities and history is
replete with examples of both;
humanization alone is man's
ontological vocation.
Not An Island
Because man does not live in
this world alone and because he
does not live apart from the
world, in order to become
educated, he must enter into
dialogical relationships with
others mediated by the world
for the clarification, purification
and affectiveness of his
reflections and actions.
The Iranian government, with
the Shah at its head wielding
absolute power over its people
and answering to no one except
his American "friends," is
indisputably oppressive.
Indisputably because a country
of 30 million people which
incarcerates 30,000 political
prisoners and maintains an
extensive and pervasive secret
police network (one informant
for every 500 persons) can
hardly be termed otherwise.
Our question should be
whether or not an oppressive
regime, in this case Iran, can
initiate and direct a truly
educational program and if it
cannot; how this should affect
the University's adopted course
of action.
Inherent Violence
Historically, the role of
oppression has been to
dehumanize man through the
violence inherent in preventing
him from the free exercise of his
mind and creative powers.
Very basic to oppression is
the oppressor's distrust of the
oppressed. He knows that in the
absence of oppression, the
oppressed will not choose to
serve his interests. He can not
even permit that the oppressed
should trust their own
perceptions. Thus it is through
authoritarianism that the
oppressor seeks to control and
this control is by definition —

dehumanizing.
Obviously, oppression as a
static force stands in
contradiction to the dynamic
force of education.
Consequently, oppression can
not initiate an educational
program it can only indoctrinate
within its system of
antidialogical hierarchical
relationships.
It is in this light that we
strongly condemn the Iranian
contract and all attempts to
keep the Iranian people bound
to their oppressive situation as
objects denied the right to shape
their own history and determine
their own future.
