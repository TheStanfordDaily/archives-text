# Stop Drug Abuse

In recent days, the Collective,
the drug abuse program in Palo
Alto, has come under increasing
attack by the Palo Alto City
Council which has voted not
to renew its funding.
Several present council
members and all of the recently
elected members have attacked
the radical political views of the
'Collective. The latest attack was
directed against a statement
about the removal of orphans
from Vietnam.
The Palo Alto Times, known
for its conservative views, has
refused to print the whole
statement made by the
Collective, using only
inflammatory excerpts in its
articles.
Few people have attacked the
Collective's counseling work. A
$100,000 study commissioned
by Palo Alto said, 'The staff
members are dedicated,
energetic, and self-motivated
people ... 85 percent of the
counseling participants in the
evaluation study reported that
they had been helped 'a lot' or
'some' by the Collective ... 92.3
percent of the participants
reported that the program had
greatly reduced their criminal
activity (primarily illegal drug
use and illegal means of
supporting habits)."
The Collective has been
involved in drug education in
local schools and aided in
preserving and extending heroin
detox facilities on an area and
statewide level. The city staff
stated that the Collective has
attained or bettered all goals set
for it.
Why then is the Collective
now faced with the loss of its
contract? It is because the city
council members don't like the
radical analysis that the
Collective brings to its therapy
programs. The Collective
believes that certain drugs are
brought into this country with
the knowledge and support of
government agencies.
They point out that U.S. drug
companies over-produce millions
of pills of amphetamines and
barbiturates every year because
the theft for illegal sale of much
of these drugs is unimportant
compared to their profits.
They assert that methadone
programs keep people on drugs,
instead of helping them to take
responsibility for their lives and
live without drugs. For this they
have been attacked.
All these facts, and more are
found in the pamphlet "Uncle
Sam the Pusherman," which the
city council has recently
directed the Collective to stop
distributing. Why is the city
council afraid of these facts and
assertions?
As the peer counseling center
on campus, we at the Bridge
unanimously support the
Collective's drug abuse work. We
are unable at the present time to
help the people that the
Collective serves and realize the
Collective's contribution to the
community.
