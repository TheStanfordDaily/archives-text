A 'Fait Accompli'
Editor:
1 appreciate Robert
Rosenzweig's explanation of the
change in seating arrangements
for commencement, but feel
that he misses the thrust of
student criticism and
misinterprets faculty concerns
over the budget.
The Faculty Senate debates
over the budget to which
Rosenzweig refers did indeed
make it a cardinal principle that
academic programs come before
all else. What Rosenzweig omits
is the other major concern of the
facultyj — that they be informed
and consulted in the process of
making budget cuts.
This same concern for
consultation before decisions are
finalized is the basis of student
criticism of the commencement
decision. Rosenzweig concedes
that there should have been
wider debate and assures us that
this is a "lesson learned in time
for a future."
Unfortunately the past
history of mendacities and fait
accomplis by the administration
put the credibility of this
assurance in doubt. Tom
Racchetti's explanation for not
publicizing the change was that
it was a "non-announceable
decision."
While uncertain of the new
bureaucratic categories of
an nounceable versus
unannounceable decisions, I
suspect that Bacchetti is arguing
that it was not important to
announce the change. Despite
our much touted intelligence,
the Public Events Office assumed
that early notification of
the policy change would not be
of concern to seniors — the very
people most affected by
commencement arrangements.
It is this arrogant attitude in
presenting hoi polloi with
another fait accompli, and not
the exigencies of fiscal
reductions, that I object to.

Reply On 'Review'
Editor:
I would like to thank John
Freed for writing the recent
article on the Stanford Review
(Daily, May 27). However, I
would like to make one
correction — the Review was

founded by and has been funded
in large part by the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
not the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
This year the publication has
also received support from the
ASSU Publications Board.
The staff of the Review and I
are very anxious to receive
feedback from undergraduates
and faculty members about the
magazine.

Black And White
Editor:
Stephen Carter raised some
interestirig issues in his
condemnation of the Alliance
for Radical Change (Daily, May
29).
While I find myself in total
agreement with the thrust of his
column, I wonder how far he is
willing to follow his own logic.
The premise would seem to
be that black students can
handle their own problems; they
should not be thought of as the
"white man's burden." But
assume that the supply of
financial aid funding is more or
less fixed, an assumption which
is not unrealistic.
A policy which requires little
or no self-help of minority
students then commensurately
disadvantages equally poor
non-minority recipients, who
receive less aid than they
otherwise might.
If the "white man's burden"
is a racist concept, let us at least
recognize that it has received
black endorsement.

Communists Kill
Editor:
The good news is that we
allow Iranian communists to
demonstrate here with their
faces masked. The bad news is
that they kill people when they
get home.

'Bible' Not Enough
Editor:
It was an old campus joke
that God was once a Stanford
professor, but that he was

denied tenure because he had
published only one book.
But it seems as though no one
is laughing at that joke any
more.

Reply To McCloskey
Editor:
Rep. Paul McCloskey and I
disagree about the meaning of
the debate on, and amendments
to, HR 6096, a bill for
humanitarian and evacuation
assistance.
The Meyner amendment,
which lost on a tie vote and
which McCloskey voted against,
would have provided
humanitarian aid to both sides
through the U.N. and
other international and private
relief agencies. This amendment
was politically important
because without it humanitarian
assistance would be provided
only to the Saigon government
and only through U.S. AID and
the Saigon government's corrupt
Ministry of Social Welfare.
McCloskey says he voted
against the amendment because
the U.N. refused to aid in
evacuation, but the amendment
was not about evacuation. In
fact, to support her amendment,
Representative Meyner noted
that the U.N. was already
providing humanitarian aid in
PRG-controlled territory.
I said that McCloskey did not
offer an amendment that was
voted on and rejected, as Bill
Johnson asserted in the May 15
Daily. McCloskey's excuse does
not alter the truth of my
statement (Daily, May 20).
McCloskey says I quoted him
out of context. The quote I used
was in support of my statement
about McCloskey's reaction to
the Mayaguez affair and, when
viewed in that context, 1 believe
the quote is a fair one.
McCloskey accused me by
implication of attacking
Johnson's integrity. I attacked
only McCloskey's record. Read
my original column (Daily, May
20) and McCloskey's reply
(Daily, May 30) and decide for
yourself who attacked whose
integrity.
