# Memo Reveals Peculiar Plan

That Daniel Moynihan is objectionable
to many members of the University
community is very clear. He is an insult and
he is a tool of the University to put down,
once again, minorities. He serves to make
graduation a real pain.
But there are a couple of other issues
surrounding this year's commencement that
should also be pointed out. The first is the
truly questionable way the decision was
made to hold the ceremonies entirely in
Frost. The second is the outrageously
insensitive way Robert Rosenzweig has
handled this whole situation.
The decision to hold the ceremony in
Frost is almost unanimously opposed by the
senior class.
It assumes that 1100 seniors will stay in
their absolute proper order, that 1100
diplomas will be 'placed in their absolute
proper order, that whoever gives the
diplomas out will not make any mistakes.
It is highly impersonal and the chances
for 1100 people each receiving the right
diploma are equally improbable.
The decision to do it all in Frost was
finally announced a couple of weeks ago â€”
first word of it came from KZSU interview
with Rosenzweig, never a formal
announcement.
We are told that the decision was made
"several months" ago, that there "never has
been a reason to inform" seniors of
ceremony plans.
Yet, three separate pieces of evidence all
point to a more hastily-conceived decision.
The Memo
In a memo of April 16, 1975 from Tom
Bacchetti, director of Public Events, to

Prof. Ben Page and the rest of the Budget
Priorities Task Force on Student Services,
Bacchetti states that the budget for this
year's commencement is $36,400 (to be
spent on setting up and renting chairs,
getting sound equipment, etc.) and that
next year's commencement will only be
budgeted $26,400, a reduction of $10,000.
He verbally reiteracted these figures on
April 29 to the Task Force. Here's the
catch: last year's commencement (with the
departmental diploma-awarding ceremonies)
also cost $36,400. The $10,000 cutback is
reflected in the plan to rent and set up no
chairs.
The $10,000 reduction is supposed to
happen next year, not this year.
Nowhere in the April 16 memo or in his
discussion with the Task Force did
Bacchetti ever mention that he had decided
to also save $10,000 this year.
Uninformed Committee
The Committee on Public Events has the
responsibility to set policy for University
events (including commencement).
Theoretically, all public events must be first
approved by the committee before they can
be carried out.
Yet the committee didn't even hear of
the commencement changes until about
four weeks ago; at the tail end of their
meeting Bacchetti announced the changes.
So nothing was official, at least, until the
end of April.
On the 1975 response cards that all
seniors were asked to fill out, the granting
of diplomas in department ceremonies is
clearly promised:

"YES. I will attend and receive my
diploma at my school or department
ceremony on June 15, 1975." Or:
"NO. I do not plan to attend my school
or department ceremony on June 15,1975.
Please handle my diploma as checked
below."
Outrageous Decision
As a senior. I find all this last-minute
announcing and lack of student input
distressing. And as a minority outraged at
the Moynihan invitation, I can't help but
suggest that the coincidence between the
Daily story announcing the move for an
alternative ceremony and the immediate
follow-up response by the University
announcing a new way to give out diplomas
extremely unfortunate.
Due to time limitations, the only way 1
can receive my diploma publicly is to sit
through the whole thing; I almost have to
listen to Moynihan, and thereby give him
more credibility than he deserves.
The second point is that Rosenzweig has
handled this whole thing dismally.
Rosenzweig is vice-president for
university affairs, somewhat of a
community relations man, yet he seems
determined to offend as many sectors of the
community as he can.
Rosenzweig is paid by Stanford, yet he is
more concerned about not insulting a
Harvard professor than he is about insulting
a significant number of Stanford students,
faculty, and staff.
