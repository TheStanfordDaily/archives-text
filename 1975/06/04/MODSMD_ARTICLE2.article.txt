# Profs Deny Connection With New Iran Deal

### DAN WATKISS 
Iran has signed a contract with the
American company Rockwell
International to set up a
communications intelligence facility in
Iran that would be capable of
monitoring both military and civilian
communications throughout the
Persian Gulf area, U.S. government
officials recently revealed.
Both Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan and Communication
Prof. Edwin Parker, the principal
investigators of the Stanford-Iran
contract, were quick to disassociate
their work from the intelligence work
of Rockwell International.
"I see no connection whatsoever,"
said Parker. "Bruce and I have been
saying all along that our work has no
connection with intelligence and the
military. We have no interest in that
sort of thing."
Commercial System
Lusignan, designer of the Stanford
satellite contracted by the National
Iranian Radio and Television (NIRT),
pointed out that he is working on a
commercial system and not an
intelligence system.
"If Iran wants to use a satellite for
intelligence purposes, it wouldn't use
the one we're working on. Commercial

systems can be jammed by anyone
who doesn't want to be spied on,"
maintained Lusignan. "It just wouldn't
make sense to use the satellite for
intelligence."
Lusignan added that he has
frequently said in the past that Iran
would contract with someone else if it
wanted an intelligence
communications system. "That
someone else is Rockwell," said
Lusignan, "and if anyone wants to
protest it, they should protest
Rockwell."
A New York Times article on the
Rockwell contract said that U.S.
officials are uncertain whom the Shah
will monitor with his forthcoming
intelligence system. The system, the
article said, "could be used by the
Iranian secret police [SAVAK| to help
locate dissidents inside the country
and for other internal security
functions."
Same Functions
These functions provided for in the
Rockwell contract are substantially
those which many contract opponents
here fear the Stanford contract will be
used for in Iran.
Opponents expressed no surprise
when the Rockwell contract was made
known. They did insist, however, that
by seeking to justify the contract in
light of the intelligence system
contracted elsewhere, supporters of
the contract are missing the point.
"It sounds like another technocratic
project which has been undertaken
without regard for its consequences,"
said Gerald Kobleutz, president of the
Stanford Platform. "Perhaps a private
corporation's ignorant indulgence is
more excusable than Stanford's. Then
again, perhaps Rockwell is not
ignorant and is rather happy to further
empower a fascist," he added.

officials are uncertain whom the Shah
will monitor with his forthcoming
intelligence system. The system, the
article said, "could be used by the
Iranian secret police [SAVAK| to help
locate dissidents inside the country
and for other internal security
functions."
Same Functions
These functions provided for in the
Rockwell contract are substantially
those which many contract opponents
here fear the Stanford contract will be
used for in Iran.
Opponents expressed no surprise
when the Rockwell contract was made
known. They did insist, however, that
by seeking to justify the contract in
light of the intelligence system
contracted elsewhere, supporters of
the contract are missing the point.
"It sounds like another technocratic
project which has been undertaken
without regard for its consequences,"
said Gerald Kobleutz, president of the
Stanford Platform. "Perhaps a private
corporation's ignorant indulgence is
more excusable than Stanford's. Then
again, perhaps Rockwell is not
ignorant and is rather happy to further
empower a fascist," he added.
Iran has signed a contract with the
American company Rockwell
International to set up a
communications intelligence facility in
Iran that would be capable of
monitoring both military and civilian
communications throughout the
Persian Gulf area, U.S. government
officials recently revealed.
Both Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan and Communication
Prof. Edwin Parker, the principal
investigators of the Stanford-Iran
contract, were quick to disassociate
their work from the intelligence work
of Rockwell International.
"I see no connection whatsoever,"
said Parker. "Bruce and I have been
saying all along that our work has no
connection with intelligence and the
military. We have no interest in that
sort of thing."
Commercial System
Lusignan, designer of the Stanford
satellite contracted by the National
Iranian Radio and Television (NIRT),
pointed out that he is working on a
commercial system and not an
intelligence system.
"If Iran wants to use a satellite for
intelligence purposes, it wouldn't use
the one we're working on. Commercial

systems can be jammed by anyone
who doesn't want to be spied on,"
maintained Lusignan. "It just wouldn't
make sense to use the satellite for
intelligence."
Lusignan added that he has
frequently said in the past that Iran
would contract with someone else if it
wanted an intelligence
communications system. "That
someone else is Rockwell," said
Lusignan, "and if anyone wants to
protest it, they should protest
Rockwell."
A New York Times article on the
Rockwell contract said that U.S.
officials are uncertain whom the Shah
will monitor with his forthcoming
intelligence system. The system, the
article said, "could be used by the
Iranian secret police [SAVAK| to help
locate dissidents inside the country
and for other internal security
