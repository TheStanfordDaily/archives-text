# Belt-Tightening Or Limb-Chopping?
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Those people so jaded by constant
exposure to the need for cutbacks of
millions and billions and zillions that
they don't think Stanford is really
going to have to begin painful cuts
are . . . wrong.
Only 15 months ago, Stanford
thought that its five-year, $6 million
Budget Adjustment Program would
produce a balanced budget in 1974-75.
But as the stock market went down
and prices went up, that projection
became absurdly optimistic.
While the University's investment
portfolio fared better than most,
Stanford still lost about $2 million in
annual income. Sharply increased
energy costs and higher-than-expected
salary rises (partially because of the
high settlement of last May's strike)
added in to produce a $10.2 million
gap between long-term income and
expenditure projections.
Faced with this crisis, the University
decided in October to embark on a
program to eliminate this gap over a
three-year period. University officials
called it a "belt-tightening." It remains
to be seen whether "limb-chopping"
might be a more apt phrase.

The University cannot make up the
$10.2 million by raising tuition, since it
has already budgeted for tuition hikes
of such proportions as to invite student
mutiny. Next year, for example,
students will shell out $3810, a 12.9
percent jump over this year.
Instead, the gap must be reduced by
transferring expenses to auxiliary
budgets and, more ominously, by
cutting services.
The 1975-76 budget, released in
March, calls for a $4 million cutback,
leaving the University with $6 million
to go. There has been little outcry over
the first $4 million in cuts, mainly
because they were made in relatively
painless ways.
Plant Services
For example, Plant Services was cut
by $430,000. And while this chop will
mean that upkeep on the physical plant
will be kept to a bare minimum, it's
not the kind of cut likely to raise howls
of protest over the decline of the
quality of the institution.
Other major reductions include
$201,000 in administrative data
processing, $172,000 in the President's
and Provost's Office, and $150,000 in
general funds saved by charging the

residence system for residence
counseling. Again, no real storms of
protest . . .
But there will be more problems
over the next two years, during which
the University will have to find a way
to cut $6 million more, or else face a
chronic deficit that would erode the
school's $350 million endowment
fund.
Provost William Miller said in
November that "there are no
foreseeable solutions that will keep the
academic program at its present scale.
No reasonably predictable combination
of income improvement and reduction
in administrative areas only will close"
the gap.
Commission Set Up
In order to help decide what should
be eliminated, the University has set up
a Budget Priorities Advisory
Commission, made up of
administration, faculty and students
The commission and its task forces will
make recommendations on possible
cost-saving reductions.
One likely long-term reduction will
be a general cutback in University
building. Gift income simply can no
longer cover building costs. Thus, in

order to finance construction of a new
library, a chemistry building and
renovation of two buildings in the
Quad, the University will have to go
into debt which will act as a deterrent
to future construction.
But still, much as everyone would
like to avoid it, the major long-term
reduction will have to be in personnel.
In 1975-76, 84 staff and 13 faculty
positions will be eliminated. Larger
faculty and faculty-support reductions
will become necessary in the future.
All of which must in some way
adversely affect the quality of Stanford
education. There's just no way around
it.

millions and billions and zillions that
they don't think Stanford is really
going to have to begin painful cuts
are . . . wrong.
Only 15 months ago, Stanford
thought that its five-year, $6 million
Budget Adjustment Program would
produce a balanced budget in 1974-75.
But as the stock market went down
and prices went up, that projection
became absurdly optimistic.
While the University's investment
portfolio fared better than most,
Stanford still lost about $2 million in
annual income. Sharply increased
energy costs and higher-than-expected
salary rises (partially because of the
high settlement of last May's strike)
added in to produce a $10.2 million
gap between long-term income and
expenditure projections.
Faced with this crisis, the University
decided in October to embark on a
program to eliminate this gap over a
three-year period. University officials
called it a "belt-tightening." It remains
to be seen whether "limb-chopping"
might be a more apt phrase.

The University cannot make up the
$10.2 million by raising tuition, since it
has already budgeted for tuition hikes
of such proportions as to invite student
mutiny. Next year, for example,
students will shell out $3810, a 12.9
percent jump over this year.
Instead, the gap must be reduced by
transferring expenses to auxiliary
budgets and, more ominously, by
cutting services.
The 1975-76 budget, released in
March, calls for a $4 million cutback,
leaving the University with $6 million
to go. There has been little outcry over
the first $4 million in cuts, mainly
because they were made in relatively
painless ways.
Plant Services
For example, Plant Services was cut
by $430,000. And while this chop will
mean that upkeep on the physical plant
will be kept to a bare minimum, it's
not the kind of cut likely to raise howls
of protest over the decline of the
quality of the institution.
Other major reductions include
$201,000 in administrative data
processing, $172,000 in the President's
and Provost's Office, and $150,000 in
general funds saved by charging the

residence system for residence
counseling. Again, no real storms of
protest . . .
But there will be more problems
over the next two years, during which
the University will have to find a way
to cut $6 million more, or else face a
chronic deficit that would erode the
school's $350 million endowment
fund.
Provost William Miller said in
November that "there are no
foreseeable solutions that will keep the
academic program at its present scale.
No reasonably predictable combination
of income improvement and reduction
in administrative areas only will close"
the gap.
Commission Set Up
In order to help decide what should
be eliminated, the University has set up
a Budget Priorities Advisory
Commission, made up of
administration, faculty and students
The commission and its task forces will
make recommendations on possible
cost-saving reductions.
One likely long-term reduction will
be a general cutback in University
building. Gift income simply can no
longer cover building costs. Thus, in

order to finance construction of a new
library, a chemistry building and
renovation of two buildings in the
Quad, the University will have to go
into debt which will act as a deterrent
to future construction.
But still, much as everyone would
like to avoid it, the major long-term
reduction will have to be in personnel.
In 1975-76, 84 staff and 13 faculty
positions will be eliminated. Larger
faculty and faculty-support reductions
will become necessary in the future.
All of which must in some way
adversely affect the quality of Stanford
education. There's just no way around
it.
Those people so jaded by constant
exposure to the need for cutbacks of
millions and billions and zillions that
they don't think Stanford is really
going to have to begin painful cuts
