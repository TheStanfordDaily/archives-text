# ...At Least For A While
## Innovative Education Wins 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Winter quarter had barely begun
when Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs announced his
recommendations that SCIRE be
eliminated this month and that
SWOPSI be phased out next June.
That was taken by many as a sign
that innovative education at Stanford
may be on the way out.
Students reacted immediately to the
cuts Gibbs proposed. A "Death of
Undergraduate Education" rally in
February featured a funeral procession
through the campus complete with
dirges and eulogies.
In addition to the rallies and public
protests against cuts in innovative
education programs, students
distributed petitions calling for the
continuation of SWOPSI and SCIRE.
Position Uncertain
While students were mobilizing to
oppose the proposed cuts, the
administration's position was
uncertain. Gibbs advocated slashing the
budget of his office, but Provost
William Miller rejected the
recommendations in part by allowing
SCIRE to return in September with
approximately half of its current
budget.
In addition, Gibbs proposed setting
up an ad hoc committee to study the
future of innovative programs here.
The 16 member panel will, according
to Gibbs, consider several options
including continuation of the programs
or their integration into an umbrella
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPELI
Gibbs suggested that UNGRASPEL
absorb several programs now operating.
Miller and other high administration
officials did not respond publicly to
Gibbs's idea, however.
Gibbs In Center
It is clear that Gibbs is at the center
of the controversy. Earlier this week,
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his
administrative duties at the office of
undergraduate studies by August 1976.
Student protests against Gibbs's
handling of his job and against the
proposed cuts in innovative education
were instrumental in the
administration's decision to keep
SCIRE in some form for at least one
more year.
Slower Death
Once student reaction to Gibbs's
recommendations had made its impact,
the University sought out budget items
to gut other than innovative programs.
Gibbs's resignation is a signal that
innovative programs, if they die, will at
least die a slower death than was once
expected.
The theory is that SWOPSI and
SCIRE were salvaged as a concession to
those who opposed the denial of tenure

to Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish.
For many students, Irish
represented an alternative to professors
who spend more time researching than
teaching. SWOPSI/SCIRE is also an
alternative. Miller apparently had a
clcar conception of that problem, so he
was willing to compromise on
innovative education by disagreeing
with the Gibbs recommendations and
by giving innovative programs a
temporary reprieve.
In this era of budget slashing,
students and administrators alike will
be forced to compromise. Inflation and
recession have forced both groups to
"bite the bullet."
However, the future of innovative

programs is not totally bleak. The
University has shown it is willing to
gauge student opinion before making
budget plans in this area. And students
have shown they will not allow
innovation in undergraduate education
to die without a fight.
But if students are so intransigent
that they will not accept future
compromises from the administration,
Miller may be obliged to respond,
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
Innovative education is here to stay
for the next few years. The form that it
takes and the changes that are made
will depend on administration
proposals, student reactions to those
proposals and the administration
response.

(UNGRASPELI
Gibbs suggested that UNGRASPEL
absorb several programs now operating.
Miller and other high administration
officials did not respond publicly to
Gibbs's idea, however.
Gibbs In Center
It is clear that Gibbs is at the center
of the controversy. Earlier this week,
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his
administrative duties at the office of
undergraduate studies by August 1976.
Student protests against Gibbs's
handling of his job and against the
proposed cuts in innovative education
were instrumental in the
administration's decision to keep
SCIRE in some form for at least one
more year.
Slower Death
Once student reaction to Gibbs's
recommendations had made its impact,
the University sought out budget items
to gut other than innovative programs.
Gibbs's resignation is a signal that
innovative programs, if they die, will at
least die a slower death than was once
expected.
The theory is that SWOPSI and
SCIRE were salvaged as a concession to
those who opposed the denial of tenure

to Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish.
For many students, Irish
represented an alternative to professors
who spend more time researching than
teaching. SWOPSI/SCIRE is also an
alternative. Miller apparently had a
clcar conception of that problem, so he
was willing to compromise on
innovative education by disagreeing
with the Gibbs recommendations and
by giving innovative programs a
temporary reprieve.
In this era of budget slashing,
students and administrators alike will
be forced to compromise. Inflation and
recession have forced both groups to
"bite the bullet."
However, the future of innovative

programs is not totally bleak. The
University has shown it is willing to
gauge student opinion before making
budget plans in this area. And students
have shown they will not allow
innovation in undergraduate education
to die without a fight.
But if students are so intransigent
that they will not accept future
compromises from the administration,
Miller may be obliged to respond,
"Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
Innovative education is here to stay
for the next few years. The form that it
takes and the changes that are made
will depend on administration
proposals, student reactions to those
proposals and the administration
response.
Winter quarter had barely begun
when Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs announced his
recommendations that SCIRE be
eliminated this month and that
SWOPSI be phased out next June.
That was taken by many as a sign
that innovative education at Stanford
may be on the way out.
Students reacted immediately to the
cuts Gibbs proposed. A "Death of
Undergraduate Education" rally in
February featured a funeral procession
through the campus complete with
dirges and eulogies.
In addition to the rallies and public
protests against cuts in innovative
education programs, students
distributed petitions calling for the
continuation of SWOPSI and SCIRE.
Position Uncertain
While students were mobilizing to
oppose the proposed cuts, the
administration's position was
uncertain. Gibbs advocated slashing the
budget of his office, but Provost
William Miller rejected the
recommendations in part by allowing
SCIRE to return in September with
approximately half of its current
budget.
In addition, Gibbs proposed setting
up an ad hoc committee to study the
future of innovative programs here.
The 16 member panel will, according
to Gibbs, consider several options
including continuation of the programs
or their integration into an umbrella
