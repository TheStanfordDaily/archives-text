# University Attempt To Collect Parking Fee Results In Mess
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
Registration Day of winter quarter
brought a surprise to most student
drivers.
Although the University's previous
parking policy — charging students $10
per year — was suspended for fall
quarter, the policy was reinstituted in
January, when the administration
failed to come up with a new plan.
Students were socked with a $7.50
vehicle registration fee for winter and
spring quarters while faculty and staff
continued to enjoy free parking.
At a glance, the registration fee did
not seem to be any different than it
had been in previous years.
Enforcement had been spotty before —
many students said they had never
bought parking stickers in four years
here and had been cited only a few

times. With fines at only $2 a shot,
most students preferred to risk it.
Fee Challenged
The residents of Escondido Village
changed all of that this year. Led by
Escondido Village Council President
Cathie Colson, the students first
boycotted the fee, then challenged the
University's parking policy in court.
Backed by $3000 in ASSU and
Village funds, Palo Alto attorney Dent
Hand was retained in an effort to have
the parking fee declared
unconstitutional. The suit claimed that
students were charged twice for
parking — through room rents and
through parking fees.
But setbacks plagued the court case
from the beginning. Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge Paul
Gallagher denied in February a

preliminary injunction to prevent
campus police from ticketing student
vehicles without stickers until the suit
was settled.
But as the tickets piled up, so did
the bills. By the end of February, the
$3000 was gone — and a settlement
seemed unlikely. It appeared that the
University had the students over a
barrel.
Although a $1 fee assessment to pay
for legal fees was placed on the spring
quarter ballot by ASSU senators, it was
later rescinded in a compromise
worked out between Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger and the ASSU. If the
assessment had stayed on the ballot
and passed. Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Dale Snape warned that the
University would refuse to collect it.
Compromise
The compromise called for the
University to stop using money
collected as room rent to pay for
parking services and maintenance. It
also allowed students with residence
parking stickers to park in off-campus
permit areas. Rebates were not offered
for any portions of rent used this year
for parking services.
However, off-campus students were
suddenly faced with the threat of
overcrowded parking lots. And all
those students with residence permits
who had been cited earlier for parking
in off-campus zones still had to pay
their parking fines. But the
compromise became policy for the
remainder of the quarter.
Carpenter Report
Peter Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, submitted
a parking report over spring break after
heading a committee which studied the
issue. Recommended fees ranged from
$15 a quarter for conveniently located
parking spaces to $12 a quarter for
residence lot spaces.
The University Committee on Land
and Building Development (C-LBD)
submitted a modified version of the
Carpenter report which was accepted
by President Richard Lyman.
The C-LBD plan set annual parking
fees at $48 for faculty, $40 for staff
and $32 for off-campus students
parking in "convenient" spaces.
On-campus students will be charged $5
per quarter. Remote parking lots and
approximately 200 spaces in the Wilbur
Hall parking lot will be designated as
free parking zones. Registration is
required of all cars used on campus.
This registration is free.
Price Of Triumph
In essence then, the students got
what they asked for — now they are
only being charged once for parking
rather than through both room rent
and fees, as they had claimed in the
class action suit. But triumph has its
price. Next year's fee is double what
this year's was — and room rent isn't
any cheaper.
And what of the $3000 that was
spent last quarter, of which $2000
came from the ASSU? Well, maybe you
can chalk it up to a learning experience
— an expensive one.
