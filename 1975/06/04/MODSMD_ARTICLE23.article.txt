# Iranian Satellite Contract Stirs Debate On Research
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Along with discussions and
demonstrations over the University's
contract with National Iranian Radio
and Television (NIRT) has come the
first questioning in several years of
University research policies.
Under the contract, Electrical
Engineering Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
EE 235 students are designing a
communication satellite for NIRT,
with advice from Prof. Edwin Parker of
the Institute for Communcation
Research (ICR).
Defending the contract, Lusignan

says that the project will actually
benefit the people of Iran, by
improving education and health care.
Leading the protests against the
contract are the Alliance for Radical
Chance (ARC), some of the Iranian
students studying here and a few
sympathetic professors.
More Power
Almost unanimously, these people
claim that the communication system
will give even more power to the Shah
of Iran than he already has. Citing
figures on secret police, political
prisoners and poverty in Iran, the
protesters argue that the University
should not aid an already dictatorial
government.
French Prof. Raymond Giraud and
other faculty members have also
attacked the contract's academic
validity. "What we have here ... is a
contract involving services rendered to
the Iranian government, a job to be
done. This is not research," Giraud
wrote in a recent letter to the
Committee on Research (C-Res).
Committee Statement
The Research Committee at ICR
also recommended that Parker not
accept his role in the contract. A
statement from several members of
ICR concluded, "After careful review
of this contract, the project described
emerges as little more than technical
assistance ... inextricably tied to the
expansionist marketing goals of U.S.
imperialism."
Meanwhile, C-Res Chairman John
Brauman maintains that the contract
falls within University guidelines and,
therefore, is not questionable. C-Res
members are now considering
recommendations of possible policy
changes, Brauman says, but the
contract itself is not being reviewed
again.
Both Brauman and Massy say that
change in research guidelines would be
necessary before a re-evaluation of the
Iran contract could be made.
