# Farewell To The CJP
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Almost four years after the Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP) first came into
existence, it is finally breathing its last.
During a referendum in April
blurred by confusing ballot wording,
the student body approved a plan for a
new Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
by a slim margin of 769 to 635 with
more than 1000 students opting for
"No Choice."
The proposed SJC has also been
approved by the Faculty Senate and by
President Richard Lyman, and will thus
take effect beginning fall quarter.
The SJC, which will hear cases
involving student violations of
Univeristy rules, will have six voting
members including three students and
three faculty members. In addition,
there will be two co-chairmen — a
student who will vote to break ties in
all Honor Code cases and a faculty
member who will vote to break ties in
all other cases.
The current CJP consists of three
students, three faculty members and a
chairman from the Law School who
votes to break ties in all cases.
The CJP was created by Lyman in
1971 as an emergency measure when
the ASSU refused to appoint members

to the existing SJC in protest of the
non-student majority.
Students have been most upset
about the lack of a student majority
deciding student judicial cases and by a
difference in selection procedures for
the panel's student and faculty members.
The new proposal clearly does not
accede to the students' position on
either of the major points. While it
provides a student majority in Honor
Code cases, the main controversy has
never been over Honor Code cases but
rather over disruption cases which still
will be decided by a faculty majority.
Furthermore, the selection procedures
for choosing student and faculty SJC
members, while more equitable than
under the CJP, are by no means
identical.
Supporters of the new plan argue
that this is the best that could be done,
that most of the cases heard by the SJC
will be Honor Code cases anyway, and
that the new plan is a first step toward
showing the University that students
can act responsibly.
Perhaps. But many of the students
who do still remember the origins of
the CJP and the importance of this
debate several years ago feel sold down
the river.
