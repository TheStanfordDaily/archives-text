# Tenure Decisions: [illegible]
## [illegible]blish Or Perish? 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The tired old cliche "publish or
perish" acquired a fresh and sinister
meaning for the University this year
when several highly respected
professors were denied tenure.
At the start of the year, assistant
professors assumed that if their
scholarship won the respect of their
departments they would receive tenure.
By the end of the year, even the most
distinguished untenured faculty
members considered their futures here
uncertain.
Perhaps the oddest aspect of the
rash of professorial firings is the
apparent lack of financial
considerations in the decisions. Given
the University's financial straits, many
people at first suspected that the
University was firing professors in
order to cut expenses.
But when departments were
encouraged to hire highly qualified
replacements for the fired professors,
speculation about the financial motives
quickly evaporated.
This left observers of the tenure
controversy asking why respected
junior scholars were being dismissed.
But, after much speculation, no one
seems to have a definite answer.
Unaware
Perhaps the most popular theory is
that the Appointments and Promotions
(A&P) Committee is unaware of what

constitutes scholarship in particular
fields.
This theory gained credence after
the A&P Committee fired Asst.
Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, the
winner of the 1972 Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching.
Irish became a cause celebre as his
colleagues protested loudly to th<>
administration and his former students
sent an avalanche of letters to the Daily
attesting to his teaching talents.
Irish and his supporters claimed that
the A&P Committee had failed to
mguish between the quantity and
quality of his scholarship.
The month after Irish's dismissal
> announced, it was learned that
ee assistant professors in the Classics
jartment were denied tenure despite
unanimous support of their
lartment. The committee's decision
created an uproar among
■sicists.
The three fired professors charged
t the committee was not aware of
quality of standards in the classics
fession and hence was unable to

make an intelligent appraisal of their
scholarship.
Worst of all, in the opinion of many
untenured professors, is the
committee's refusal to show them the
criticism of their work submitted by
colleagues in their field.
Intense Pressure
One of the worst results of the
tenure controversy is the intense
pressure that has been placed on
professors to publish enough to impress
the committee.
Partly because of this pressure, Asst.
English Prof. Emerson Brown and Asst.
Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern — both
promising scholars, according to their
colleagues — have decided to leave the
University.
And noted Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown considers the
tenure controversy a mai;. factor in his
decision to accept a part-time
appointment in Berkeley.
Most recently, some professors have
speculated that the brutal competition
for tenure, combined with the A&P
Committee's alleged capriciousness,
will make it difficult for Stanford to
continue to attract the nation's most
talented young scholars.
It would be bitterly ironic if this
occurred, since the A&P Committee
has, in the past, denied tenure to so
many in the name of preserving the
University's academic quality.
