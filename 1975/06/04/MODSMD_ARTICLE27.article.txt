# University With Grad
## Grapples Inflation 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
When the Faculty Senate decreed
the return of the D grade a few weeks
ago, it was echoing nationwide concern
over rising college grades.
Since 1960 grade-point averages have
risen about half a letter grade, a study
of 197 institutions by a Michigan State
University administrator found.
Grade inflation, coupled with a
decline on such standardized tests as
the SAT, has become one of tho
hottest topics inside higher education
— and outside.
Even the Wall Street Journal
expressed the concern that grade
inflation and the reasons given for it
"make one worry about the condition
of higher education."
In many cases, talk has turned to
concrete reaction. Some schools have
dropped the hallowed dean's list or
altered its standards. Many Phi Bete
Kappa chapters have raised requirements.
The "crackdown" here — coming at
the recommendation of the Committee
for Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) after a
conscientious year-and-a-half of study
— is actually one of the more hard-line
actions taken.
The C-AAA argued in its report that
even though the D 'shouldprobably not
be much used ... its mere existence
might be an incentive to move the
distribution of grades downward from
the present concentration at the upper
end."
A return of the D would revitalize
the "gentleman's C" and drop grade
averages accordingly. The cumulative
Letter Grade Indicator (similar to
grade-point average) for undergraduate
courses rose from 3.19 in 1968-69 to
3.4 in 1973-74, the report noted.
What the final results of the senate's
action will be can't be known until
next year, when the ruling goes into
effect, but indications are that grade
inflation is easing without the help of
administrative fiat.
For courses most commonly taken
by freshmen and sophomores, the
proportion of A's dropped six percent
between winter quarter last year and
winter quarter this year.
The factors contributing to grade
inflation are numerous. One majors
factor undoubtedly is that grading is
being done more on an absolute scale,
rather than on a curve.
