# Little Interest In Open Files'

itudents who wanted to discover
'v/hat confidential information the
versity was holding about them had
r hopes raised last November by the
kley Amendment.
The amendment, which opened all
ucation records" to students, was
by an enthusiastic response here.
;lve students asked to see their files
h e first day the bill took effect,
jut Sen. James L. Buckley
ns.—N.Y.), author of the bill which
formally known as the Family
cational Rights and Privacy Act of
4, bowed to pressure from higher
cational forces to water down the
)onfidential letters of
imendation written prior to
iary 1, 1975 may be withheld from
ents under revisions approved by
gress.
tudent interest dropped
lediately.
t dropped so much, according to

Asst. Reqistrar Walter Findeisen, that
the University stopped keeping a daily
log of the number of interested
students.
"The number has diminished so
greatly that it's not worth it keeping
records," Findeisen said. "The interest
has really died down. I guess the word
has gotten out that there really aren't
any mysterious documents in there."
Just "a handful" of students have
gone further, pressing for more
information from the University,
according to James Siena, legal adviser
to President Richard Lyman.
"It has provoked surprisingly little
interest," he noted. Siena raised the
point that the students who should
really want access to admissions
information — the ones rejected by the
University — cannot see their files
anyway.
"In a way, it's a crazy piece of
legislation," Siena commented. "The
person who would really want to see
the information is the person who was

denied admission. But only those who
get in can see the information."
Eight persons, including a University
employee, had asked for additional
information as of February 5. The
employee, a self-described "campus
radical" and former student here, asked
for "anything and everything in my file
that might have an impact on my
future career," including campus police
records.
"So far as I know, that case has
been resolved," Siena said. He added
that the University had not released
any confidential information to any
student.
So — after the fury over the original
law died down — the effect on
University policy was negligible. As
Siena explained, "It's been the
long-standing practice of the Registrar's
Office and other University offices to
let people see the great bulk of what's
in their files."

information from the University,
according to James Siena, legal adviser
to President Richard Lyman.
"It has provoked surprisingly little
interest," he noted. Siena raised the
point that the students who should
really want access to admissions
information — the ones rejected by the
University — cannot see their files
anyway.
"In a way, it's a crazy piece of
legislation," Siena commented. "The
person who would really want to see
the information is the person who was

denied admission. But only those who
get in can see the information."
Eight persons, including a University
employee, had asked for additional
information as of February 5. The
employee, a self-described "campus
radical" and former student here, asked
for "anything and everything in my file
that might have an impact on my
future career," including campus police
records.
"So far as I know, that case has
been resolved," Siena said. He added
that the University had not released
any confidential information to any
student.
So — after the fury over the original
law died down — the effect on
University policy was negligible. As
Siena explained, "It's been the
long-standing practice of the Registrar's
Office and other University offices to
let people see the great bulk of what's
in their files."

Asst. Reqistrar Walter Findeisen, that
the University stopped keeping a daily
log of the number of interested
students.
"The number has diminished so
greatly that it's not worth it keeping
records," Findeisen said. "The interest
has really died down. I guess the word
has gotten out that there really aren't
any mysterious documents in there."
