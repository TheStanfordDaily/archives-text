# No Contact Made Yet With Rebels
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
No contact has yet been made with
the Zaire rebels who kidnaped three
Stanford students and a Dutch
national from the Gombe Stream
research center in Tanzania on May
19.
Since the release of one of the
students, Barbara Smuts, on May 26,
State Department and Tanzanian
officials have failed in their persistent
attempts to start negotiations with the
rebels.
The abductors, allegedly members
of a Marxist guerrilla group, have
demanded $460,000 ransom, arms and
ammunition, and the release of two
prisoners held in Tanzania. The rebels
have issued a 60-day deadline for
compliance.
Negotiation Attempts
A new attempt to reach the rebels
was started last weekend by Law Prof.
Peter Steiner of the University of
Michigan.
Early wire reports indicated that
Steiner had gone to the Tanzanian
capital of Burundi to obtain
permission to cross into Zaire to
negotiate with the guerillas.
The most recent reports, however,
indicate that while Steiner has gone to
Burundi to negotiate with the rebels,
he has no intention of going to Zaire.
Risking Capture
Stanford Psychiatry Prof. David
Hamburg, the University's chief liaison
with the Gombe project, explained
that if Steiner crossed into Zaire he
himself would risk capture.
Furthermore, Steiner would
complicate the Zaire government's
position, which has been not to
recognize the rebels.
Finally, Hamburg pointed out that
Steiner might endanger the lives of the
captives by leading Zaire troops to the
rebels.
Unknown Reasons
Steiner's reasons for wanting to
negotiate are unknown, although he is
reported to be an acquaintance of the
Smuts family, which lives in Ann
Arbor, and has taught in Nairobi,
Kenya. He has told newsmen that he
merely wants to help the students.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government
has repeated its refusal to pay ransom
for the captives, although it
emphasizes that it won't interfere with
private payments of ransom.
The University continues to have
no plans to pay ransom.
