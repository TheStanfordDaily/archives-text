# One Housing Inequity Resolved
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The University has revised the
housing system this year after extensive
discussions in committees, dormitories
and fraternities. But as the components
of the new system are implemented,
the issue which prompted the
revamping remains unaddressed.
Students in Alpha Sigma Phi
complained last year that the
University discriminated against
women because fraternities which
housed women were not allowed draw
exempt status. Today,
co-educational "fraternities" are still in

the draw while all-male fraternities are
not.
Yet, the Alpha Sig issue did prompt
the University to end one of its
discriminatory policies — that of access
to on-campus housing.
Before the new system, all-male
fraternity members were the only
students who were assured on-campus
housing during their four years at
Stanford. Other students, including all
female students, were forced to draw
for the available on-campus spaces.
Additional Units
To increase the number of spaces,
the University is presently constructing
an additional 100 units in Florence
Moore — a move that has sparked much
protest from Flo Mo residents,
annoyed at the noise and
inconvenience.
In addition, architectural plans for a
$3.6 million project to build three
50-person Row houses have been
completed this year.
But, after round two of the draw
this year, 680 students desiring
on-campus housing were left
unassigned victims of the shortage.
To make all students share the
housing shortage burden, Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Larry Horton and
the housing subcommittee of the
Committee on Student Services (COSS)
decided no one should be guaranteed
on-campus housing for all four years
here.
Freshman Choice
The new system guarantees entering
freshmen three years of on-campus
housing. They can choose which of
their four years they would prefer to
live off campus.
As a result of this new system, 279
freshmen were denied their request for
on-campus housing next year.
Approximately 94 percent of the
freshman class stated they wished to be
on campus, but the new system allows
spaces for only 75 percent.
Fraternities have also felt the
ramifications of the new system. They
have had to make a "mad rush" for
pledges to satisfy a quota of new
members established by the University.
Joining a frat no longer ensures
on-campus housing. The quota exceeds

the number of members a frat can
possibly house, and thus the
members must live off campus.
According to Norman Robinson,
director of the Row, five fraternities —
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta,
Kappa Alpha, Phi Delta Theta and
Theta Xi — had not fulfilled their
quotas as of May 9. The fraternity
system as a whole fell 22 members
short.
Robinson explained that the frats
would have until the second Friday of
autumn quarter to pledge the needed
members.
If specific frats don't fulfill their
quotas over a period of time, they will
eventually be obligated to join the
draw.
Inequity
Many fraternity men have
complained that the University is "out
to destroy" fraternities with this new
system. However, Horton has asserted
that the purpose of his system is to end

the inequity of the entire housing
structure, not fraternities.
Yet, Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons has declared that the
administration disapproves of what
fraternities consider the essence of
their existence - the right to
subjectively choose their members.
Abolition vs. Extension
Lyons stated he would rather
abolish subjective selectivity across the
board than extend the privilege to
women who were trying to establish
sororities on campus earlier this year.
Charlotte Christman, sorority
organizer, commented that
"enthusiasm for sororities has died"
because of "no positive feedback"
from the University.
The frat men are still working to
maintain their rights, however. At the
ASSU Senate meeting Monday night,
they objected that no fraternity man
was appointed to the COSS housing
subcommittee which will review the
new housing system.
