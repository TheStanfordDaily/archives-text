# Minorities Still Doubtful About Aid Policy Change
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
> For better or for worse, depending
on whether you believe University
administrators or minority students,
the basis for financial aid to low and
middle income students has been
shifted from an ethnic criterion to an
economic criterion.
The policy change, adopted in
February by the Faculty Senate,
requires that blacks, chicanos and
Native Americans provide
approximately 80 percent of the
self-help expectation of non-minority
students.
Self-help is defined as money
provided either by a job during the
academic year or a long-term,
low-interest loan, as opposed to an
outright grant. Under the former plan,
no minority students on financial aid
were required to provide self-help
during their freshman year.
Inducement
The 20 percent advantage extended
to minority students is considered an
inducement similar to the reduced
self-help expectation break currently
extended to other students the
University wishes to attract.
The original proposal, drawn up by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA), only granted this 20
percent ad\Â«antage to middle-income
minority students, but sharp criticism,
including numerous demonstrations,
convinced the Faculty Senate to
extend the special benefits to minority
students from very low income
background.
Debate and criticism of the new aid
package continues, as evidenced by its
status as an issue at last month's mass
demonstration at the Board of Trustees
meeting.
Draft Proposal
Attacks on the change began as
early as November when C-UAFA
issued a draft proposal recommending a
$700 self-help requirement for all
students, regardless of race, during
freshman year.
According to C-UAFA Chairman

Paul Green, the "draft proposal was
intended to draw constructive
criticism," which it succeeded
admirably in doing. Minority students
attacked the plan for lack of minority
student imput and insufficient evidence
to support a change in the system.
The controversy heightened when a
memo written by Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs,
supporting a proposed cut in minority
financial aid because it is "likely to
bring us a different (and I think better)
mix of minority students," became
publicized.
Key Issue
But Gibb's memo quickly took a
back seat to the C-UAFA proposal,
with the key issue being whether the
University has lessened its commitment
to minority students.
That question has still not been
conclusively answered, and probably
won't be until minority application,
acceptance and enrollment figures for
the next few years are known. Even
then, the direct effect of minority aid
on eventual enrollment remains
questionable. Minority students
contend that the new aid policy will
discourage low income minority
students from applying to Stanford.
The administration is trying hard to
convince everyone that its commitment
is still strong. The Faculty Senate
accepted the report with the
understanding that there were no
"implications that the University's
commitment to recruitment of
minorities has diminished."
Response Predicted
Gibb's memo even predicted an
initial response that "will identify the
shift to the new policy as being a
lessening of commitment to minority
students and minority concerns," but
added that "our institutional stance is
such that it soon will be apparent that
overall commitment has not lessened."
Minority students remain
unconvinced, though, and will
undoubtably remain so until they
believe University action replaces
verbal assurances that the commitment
has not decreased.
