# Protests Cloud Graduation Ceremony
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
unday, June 15, is Commencement
This year's graduation ceremony
be different from past ceremonies
)th in the form it will take and in
loud of protests hanging over it.
vie questions as to what
mencement will actually be stem
i two protests which have become
lally indistinguishable: the

selection of Harvard Government Prof,
(and Ambassador-designate to the
United Nations) Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as graduation speaker and
the consolidation of all Humanities and
Sciences (H&S) ceremonies. The
former decision was made with little
student input; the latter was made with
none.
The senior class officers chose

Moynihan by informally polling a few
seniors, and then drawing up a final list
of possible speakers with the assistance
of some administrators. The final list of
candidates for speaker was never
presented to the senior class.
Clamor Of Protest
After Moynihan's selection was
announced in February, the clamor of
protest began. Black graduating
students, joined by anthropology
professors and graduate students,
assailed Moynihan because of his
scholarship and because he had
advocated to the Nixon administration
that a policy of "benign neglect" be
adopted with respect to the problems
of the black community.
The possibility of an alternate
commencement in protest of the
selection was immediately set in the
planning stages, but its future is still
uncertain.
Then on May 6, Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig
announced that all H&S ceremonies
would be combined. Seniors
immediately began to register their
protests with the administration over
this decision.
Rental And Labor Costs
Administrators said the change was
made to save the University
approximately $10,000 in equipment
rental and labor.
Public Events Director Thomas
Bacchetti said he didn't feel it was "an
announceable decision" which should
have been disclosed at that time.
The lateness of the unofficial
Rosenzweig announcement forestalled
any chance of seniors finding alternate
solutions to keep the previous
ceremony intact
The administration has aqreed to
Senior Class President Lise Pfeiffer's
proposal to have department chairmen
hand out the . diplomas at
commencement.
Proposal Refused
However, when biology students

came up with student help, union
approval and funding to provide for a
separate diploma awarding ceremony,
the administration refused to give them
their diplomas for a separate ceremony.
Administrators said they couldn't
"allow biology to have thtir own
ceremony without making similar
arrangements for the other 'less
affluent' departments "
Pfeiffer submitted a proposal earlier
this week for H&S to divide up into
departments for the diploma awarding
ceremony as has been done in the past
three years.

Bacchetti said yesterday that "it's
really too late to change" and that he
felt H&S should be kept together in
any case.
The University has stood firm over
the Moynihan invitation, but some
administrators have had second
thoughts over the ceremony change —
especially over the lateness of the
announcement.
At this point, what might happen on
June 15 is anyone's guess. Yet if more
students had been consulted earlier, the
protest — and the speculation — might
have been unnecessary.
