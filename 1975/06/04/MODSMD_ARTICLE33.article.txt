nationally known primatologist.

After several days of confusion and
uncertainty, the kidnapers released one
of their hostages, Barbara Smuts, a
graduate student here, who brought
with her both an identification of the
raiders and a ransom note.
Marxist Guerillas
The kidnapers: the Popular
Revolutionary Party, a band of Marxist
guerrillas opposed to the regime of
President Mobutu Sese Seko of
neighboring Zaire. Their demands:
money, arms and the release of their
comrades held in various African jails.
At year's end, no one knew if the
drama would have a happy or tragic
ending. Tanzanian officials promptly
rejected all demands, but the U.S. was
reportedly bringing heavy
behind-the-scenes pressure to bear on
the Zaire and Tanzania regimes in an
effort to secure release of the three
remaining hostages — Kenneth (Steve)
Smith of Garden Grove, Carrie Hunter
of Atherton and Emilie Bergman of
Holland.
Stanford sent its own representative
to Tanzania — Psychiatry Prof. David
Hamburg — to try to expedite matters.
But the guerrillas have set a mid July
deadline for compliance with their
demands — and an end to the story
could still be weeks away.

deadline for compliance with their
demands — and an end to the story
could still be weeks away.
