# You May Have Voted... But You Probably Didn't
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
You may have voted in one of the
five ASSU elections during this past
year. But more likely you did not, as
the most any ballot could attract to the
polls was 3325 students (or only 29
percent of the student body).
If the number of candidates was any
indication, though, there was a marked
increase of interest in student
government when compared with the
last few years. Five slates opted for the
Council of Presidents (COP) six for
senior class officers and no fewer than
84 candidates for the 20 positions in
the ASSU Senate.
And there was no lack of fee
assessments either. Nine were on the
spring ballot and two others required a
special election earlier in the year. But
students proved cautions at doling out
money to various groups.
Failure of its fee assessment was one
of the factors leading to the demise of
Live Oak. And on the same ballot,
students voted down a record co-op
proposal, which would have had the
ASSU running the Bookstore's record

department.
Students also refused to fund the
Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) and the NorCal Public Interest
Research Group for next year. Seven
groups fared successfully, though
Daily's three-quarter request and the
Publication Board's two-quarter
assessment each had more than 1300
opposition votes.
In the hard-fought COP race, Lee
Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane pulled
off a surprisingly strong victory in their
run-off against Kevin McDermott,
Bonny Rodden, Andy Leuchter and
Mark Simonian.
The Rosenbaum slate took office
last month, and has begun to work on
fulfilling what it termed its campaign
"premises" including proposals for peer
advising, a women's building, a
SWOPSI course to examine University
financing and tuition, and a
community buying guide.
Finally the students barely approved
a constitutional amendment to make
wording in the ASSU by laws non-sexist.
