## Take Two French Connection II Is Not Sick Sequel 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
The sequel sickness has
overcome Hollywood. Years ago
sequels were made to cash in on
the original's success — to make
quick money — and they were
budgeted with diminishing return?
in mind.
Then, somewhere during the
early part of the '70s, with the
astounding success of the Planet
of the Apes series, Hollywood
began to take sequels seriously.
And when Magnum Force made
even more than Dirty Harry,
everyone sat up and took notice.
Like television spin-offs,
sequels rely on public
familiarity. As the risks in
making profits increase,
box-office favorites improve a
movie's chances of success.
Today, because of the
instability of the industry, we
are in the middle of a sequels
explosion. Funny Lady and The
Godfather, Part 11, are doing
excellent business, while a third
Dirty Harry film, Moving Target,
is due to start filming in San
Francisco. Producers are
approaching Albert Finney to
discuss another portrayal of
Hercule Poirot, and Walking
Tall, Part II is on its way to
release.
The French Connection II is
the sequel to 197 l's Best Picture
of the Year, which shot Gene
Hackman, Roy Scheider, and
William Friedkin to fame.
The French Connection (part
one) was such a great motion
picture that it would seem
difficult to equal it, but its
sequel comes very close.
Popeye Doyle (Hackman)
goes to Marseilles to catch Alain
Charnier (Fernando Rey), who
mysteriously disappeared at the
end of the original. Popeye
creates his special brand of
trouble with his exuberance in a
country where he has no legal
power.
You might want to take an

interpreter because there are no
subtitles, but it works anyway,
making us more sympathetic to
Popeye's difficulties with the
language barrier.
Rotten, no-good Charnier
makes Popeye a heroin addict to
discourage him, and when he
oh-so-fortitudinously quits cold
turkey, it is a little bit too drawn
out and graphic. That and the
excessive blood cause some
squirming, but Popeye's sweet
revenge takes the bitter taste
away.
The movie is everything a
movie should be. It starts slowly
and builds, each scene
snowballing until the perfect
climax to a perfect sequel (that
is, in relation to its predecessor).
Only Gene Hackman could
play Popeye Doyle, and only
Popeye Doyle could get away
with the kinds of stunts he pulls
(one of the best follows his
"Bring water — lots of it" phone
call to his French co-worker just
before he commits arson).
One of the biggest complaints
with his Oscar-winning
performance was that he did
more running than acting.
This is especially true here,
because FCII is a superb
example of the chase genre.
However, when Hackman acts,
he doesn't fool around about it.
I think he is the best actor
working.
The screenplay by Alexander
Jacobs and Robert and Laurie
Dillon allows all of Popeye's
crude charm to shine.
Bernard Bresson is great as
Popeye's French liaison, and
Fernando Rey is beautifully
menacing as the dapper
Charnier, truly a man you love
to hate. The film is directed with
a strong rip by John
Frankenheimer (Seven Days In
May, The Manchurian
Candidate), and once it gets off
the ground, it has a bulldozer
effect.

movie should be. It starts slowly
and builds, each scene
snowballing until the perfect
climax to a perfect sequel (that
is, in relation to its predecessor).
Only Gene Hackman could
play Popeye Doyle, and only
Popeye Doyle could get away
with the kinds of stunts he pulls
(one of the best follows his
"Bring water — lots of it" phone
call to his French co-worker just
before he commits arson).
One of the biggest complaints
with his Oscar-winning
performance was that he did
more running than acting.
This is especially true here,
because FCII is a superb
example of the chase genre.
However, when Hackman acts,
he doesn't fool around about it.
I think he is the best actor
working.
The screenplay by Alexander
Jacobs and Robert and Laurie
Dillon allows all of Popeye's
crude charm to shine.
Bernard Bresson is great as
Popeye's French liaison, and
Fernando Rey is beautifully
menacing as the dapper
Charnier, truly a man you love
to hate. The film is directed with
a strong rip by John
Frankenheimer (Seven Days In
May, The Manchurian
Candidate), and once it gets off
the ground, it has a bulldozer
effect.

A DAY ON THE FARM—BiII Graham wasn't there, nor was
Danny Scher, but the people came out Sunday afternoon to toss
their frisbees and listen to the Sons of Champlin.
The sequel sickness has
overcome Hollywood. Years ago
sequels were made to cash in on
the original's success — to make
quick money — and they were
budgeted with diminishing return?
in mind.
Then, somewhere during the
early part of the '70s, with the
astounding success of the Planet
of the Apes series, Hollywood
began to take sequels seriously.
And when Magnum Force made
even more than Dirty Harry,
everyone sat up and took notice.
Like television spin-offs,
sequels rely on public
familiarity. As the risks in
making profits increase,
box-office favorites improve a
movie's chances of success.
Today, because of the
instability of the industry, we
are in the middle of a sequels
explosion. Funny Lady and The
Godfather, Part 11, are doing
excellent business, while a third
Dirty Harry film, Moving Target,
is due to start filming in San
Francisco. Producers are
approaching Albert Finney to
discuss another portrayal of
Hercule Poirot, and Walking
Tall, Part II is on its way to
release.
The French Connection II is
the sequel to 197 l's Best Picture
of the Year, which shot Gene
Hackman, Roy Scheider, and
William Friedkin to fame.
The French Connection (part
one) was such a great motion
picture that it would seem
difficult to equal it, but its
sequel comes very close.
Popeye Doyle (Hackman)
goes to Marseilles to catch Alain
Charnier (Fernando Rey), who
mysteriously disappeared at the
end of the original. Popeye
creates his special brand of
trouble with his exuberance in a
country where he has no legal
power.
You might want to take an

interpreter because there are no
subtitles, but it works anyway,
making us more sympathetic to
Popeye's difficulties with the
language barrier.
Rotten, no-good Charnier
makes Popeye a heroin addict to
discourage him, and when he
oh-so-fortitudinously quits cold
turkey, it is a little bit too drawn
out and graphic. That and the
excessive blood cause some
squirming, but Popeye's sweet
revenge takes the bitter taste
away.
The movie is everything a
movie should be. It starts slowly
and builds, each scene
snowballing until the perfect
climax to a perfect sequel (that
