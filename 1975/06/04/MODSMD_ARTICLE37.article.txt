# Yearbook Review
## The 						'Quad' Not Up To Par 
### GEORGE POWELL 
The following isn't going to
be all sweetness and light, so
let's get it said right at the top.
The 1975 Quad is a lousy
yearbook. Although I'm sure the
staff put at least $10 worth of
effort into it, it's not worth $10
to any student.
The photography, with a few
exceptions, is poor, and the
photo editing is abysmal. The
copy, what little there is, is
bland and uninspired, and reads
like a last minute story in the
Daily that didn't get enough
editing. The printing job, done
by the Taylor Company, to the
tune of some $18,000, is
nothing to brag about either.
Some technically good color
shots are at the start of the
book, but from there it is
obvious that the pages were put
together in a dusty room by
persons unskilled in pasteup.
Well, let's back off a bit. I
don't enjoy being so negative,
but as a former yearbook editor,
this effort just doesn't measure
up to expectations. It's been the

trend on campuses across the
country for yearbooks to go out
of business, because students
weren't buying them. The Quad
went through a period of
non-existence a couple of years
ago, and even staid midwestern
universities like Nebraska have
seen yearbooks cease
publication.
The question is why? In 10
years of flipping through college
yearbooks, it seems to me that
the larger the school, the
tougher it is to put out a book
that will capture the essence of
that particular year, accurately
portray the diversity of activities
that occur in a large,
multi-faceted university, picture
as many students as possible in
an interesting manner and serve
as a student-produced hard-cover
record of the year's events.
That's a tall order even for
professionals, and this year's
Quad looks like it was produced
by a bunch of eager but
untutored amateurs, who were
learning about Stanford and
yearbooks while they were

meeting deadlines.
From the very start of the
book, it seems the staff had no
clear plan. Open the blue and
purple cover, and what do you
see? Another pseudo-cover on
the front end sheet, which is
reproduced on the back end
sheet as well. Technically, the
introduction's color photos are
most of the good ones in the
book, but the copy that goes
along with them comes straight
out of The Prophet. Gibran
might be okay for a high school
book, but for Stanford he comes
across as somewhere between
jejune and banal.
Then comes Student Life,
which is a compilation of living
group shots. Getting these
photos scheduled, taken and
identified is one of the most
tedious yearbook jobs, and the
'75 Quad shows no great talent
for it. Some groups, like
Columbae House, have a short
write-up, but no group picture.
Most have a group photo, which
is 1) small, 2) out of focus and
3) hard to identify from the
hand-drawn and numbered key.
Moving along, the Faculty
and Administration section is
next. It contains a stilted essay
in hard-to-read bold type, and
many pictures of randomly (I
guess) selected faculty.
Administrators fare even worse,
with statements they authored
being placed so you have to
guess who wrote them. And the
photos are so terrible (Gibbs and
Siena in particular) that 10 years
from now nobody could say for

sure what they looked like.
The Second Dimension, or
graduate school and student
section had a good idea that died
in the execution. Grad students
are pictured, telling something
about their departments and
what projects were being done.
But the pictures are dull, the
copy is incomplete and not all
graduate departments are
covered.
I could go on with the other
sections (Sports, University Life,
etc.), but why bother? The
problems are the same. When
there are blatant typographical
errors on the staff page (p. 305),
it's a good indication that the
rest of the book is far from
perfect. If Stanford is going to
have a yearbook, next year's
staff should work on starting out
with some campus knowledge
and publications professional
ism, instead of trying to pick
them up along the deadline trail.

nothing to brag about either.
Some technically good color
shots are at the start of the
book, but from there it is
obvious that the pages were put
together in a dusty room by
persons unskilled in pasteup.
Well, let's back off a bit. I
don't enjoy being so negative,
but as a former yearbook editor,
this effort just doesn't measure
up to expectations. It's been the

trend on campuses across the
country for yearbooks to go out
of business, because students
weren't buying them. The Quad
went through a period of
non-existence a couple of years
ago, and even staid midwestern
universities like Nebraska have
seen yearbooks cease
publication.
The question is why? In 10
years of flipping through college
yearbooks, it seems to me that
the larger the school, the
tougher it is to put out a book
that will capture the essence of
that particular year, accurately
portray the diversity of activities
that occur in a large,
multi-faceted university, picture
as many students as possible in
an interesting manner and serve
as a student-produced hard-cover
record of the year's events.
That's a tall order even for
professionals, and this year's
Quad looks like it was produced
by a bunch of eager but
untutored amateurs, who were
learning about Stanford and
yearbooks while they were

meeting deadlines.
From the very start of the
book, it seems the staff had no
clear plan. Open the blue and
purple cover, and what do you
see? Another pseudo-cover on
the front end sheet, which is
reproduced on the back end
sheet as well. Technically, the
introduction's color photos are
most of the good ones in the
book, but the copy that goes
along with them comes straight
out of The Prophet. Gibran
might be okay for a high school
book, but for Stanford he comes
across as somewhere between
jejune and banal.
Then comes Student Life,
which is a compilation of living
group shots. Getting these
photos scheduled, taken and
identified is one of the most
tedious yearbook jobs, and the
'75 Quad shows no great talent
for it. Some groups, like
Columbae House, have a short
write-up, but no group picture.
Most have a group photo, which
is 1) small, 2) out of focus and
3) hard to identify from the
hand-drawn and numbered key.
Moving along, the Faculty
and Administration section is
next. It contains a stilted essay
in hard-to-read bold type, and
many pictures of randomly (I
guess) selected faculty.
Administrators fare even worse,
with statements they authored
being placed so you have to
guess who wrote them. And the
photos are so terrible (Gibbs and
Siena in particular) that 10 years
from now nobody could say for

sure what they looked like.
The Second Dimension, or
graduate school and student
section had a good idea that died
in the execution. Grad students
are pictured, telling something
about their departments and
what projects were being done.
But the pictures are dull, the
copy is incomplete and not all
graduate departments are
covered.
I could go on with the other
sections (Sports, University Life,
etc.), but why bother? The
problems are the same. When
there are blatant typographical
errors on the staff page (p. 305),
it's a good indication that the
rest of the book is far from
perfect. If Stanford is going to
have a yearbook, next year's
staff should work on starting out
with some campus knowledge
and publications professional
ism, instead of trying to pick
them up along the deadline trail.
The following isn't going to
be all sweetness and light, so
let's get it said right at the top.
The 1975 Quad is a lousy
yearbook. Although I'm sure the
staff put at least $10 worth of
effort into it, it's not worth $10
to any student.
The photography, with a few
exceptions, is poor, and the
photo editing is abysmal. The
copy, what little there is, is
bland and uninspired, and reads
like a last minute story in the
Daily that didn't get enough
editing. The printing job, done
by the Taylor Company, to the
tune of some $18,000, is
nothing to brag about either.
