# 'Chaparral': As Hilarious As Usual
## BOOKS 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Like some sort of botched-up
Lazarus, the Stanford Chaparral
periodically tries to rise from the
grave. Be warned: it happened
again this week, with its usual
degree of unsuccess.
The funniest thing about this
new issue of the Chappie is the
price: Editor Mike Dornheim
and his fun-loving squad of
Mongoloid editors are charging
50 cents a copy. Actually that's
a pretty good price for an
abortion, which is what you're
paying for.
For your cash you can read
articles on such hilarious
subjects as — now don't get too
excited — William Shockley,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
tourists, and commencement.

For those who have some kind
of bizarre sexual hangup about
Dornheim, the issue is really a
great deal: he's in 22 — count
them, 22 — photos. You can
pant over them for months.
The prose is gracefully styled,
with typical Chaparral aplomb;
the humor is as subtly pungent
as ever. Listen to this clever joke
about Isaac Newton: "That
Newton did not really believe his
own theory is evidenced by the
attribution to him of the famous
'There is no gravity, the earth
sucks.' "
Isn't that simply marvelous?
Don't you wish you could have
thought of that? Don't you wish
someone would pay you 50
cents for filling 32 pages with
equally witty material?

Probably the most brilliant
individual contributor, to the
Chappie is Tom Devine, who
recently amazed and amused us
all with his chuckle-a-minute
campaign for, ASSU president.
Devine's masterpiece is an article
entitled "Thieu in Taiwan"
which is chock-full of hysterical
lines like this one:
"I understand that Mr. Ky
was trying to be a taxi driver in
southern California, but he just
couldn't hack it."
It's jokes like that one that
will someday make Devine a
big-name writer for some journal
of humor like Popular
Mec/fanics.
The Chappie staff is fearless
as usual in cutting to the heart
of Stanford social and political
issues. For instance, there's a
speech by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan on "Negroes." There
are endless jokes about
controversial topics like ritual
murders in Memorial Church.
Even sacred cows like Richard

Nixon catch a few gentle barbs.
Oddly enough, the funniest
thing in the whole issue is a
legitimate advertisement for a
douche kit that is so gross it
sounds like the Chappie, staff
wrote it. If you're foolish
enough to shell out money for

the magazine, you'll find the ad
inside the front cover. You can't
miss it — it's headlined "When
you can't smell the difference
between you and your woman
you're in trouble."
There's another ad inside the
back cover that carries the
unfortunate news that the
Chaparral is even now plotting a
Reg Day issue for next autumn.
Some people just can't leave a
corpse to rest in peace.

Dornheim, the issue is really a
great deal: he's in 22 — count
them, 22 — photos. You can
pant over them for months.
The prose is gracefully styled,
with typical Chaparral aplomb;
the humor is as subtly pungent
as ever. Listen to this clever joke
about Isaac Newton: "That
Newton did not really believe his
own theory is evidenced by the
attribution to him of the famous
'There is no gravity, the earth
sucks.' "
Isn't that simply marvelous?
Don't you wish you could have
thought of that? Don't you wish
someone would pay you 50
cents for filling 32 pages with
equally witty material?

Probably the most brilliant
individual contributor, to the
Chappie is Tom Devine, who
recently amazed and amused us
all with his chuckle-a-minute
campaign for, ASSU president.
Devine's masterpiece is an article
entitled "Thieu in Taiwan"
which is chock-full of hysterical
lines like this one:
"I understand that Mr. Ky
was trying to be a taxi driver in
southern California, but he just
couldn't hack it."
It's jokes like that one that
will someday make Devine a
big-name writer for some journal
of humor like Popular
Mec/fanics.
The Chappie staff is fearless
as usual in cutting to the heart
of Stanford social and political
issues. For instance, there's a
speech by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan on "Negroes." There
are endless jokes about
controversial topics like ritual
murders in Memorial Church.
Even sacred cows like Richard

Nixon catch a few gentle barbs.
Oddly enough, the funniest
thing in the whole issue is a
legitimate advertisement for a
douche kit that is so gross it
sounds like the Chappie, staff
wrote it. If you're foolish
enough to shell out money for

the magazine, you'll find the ad
inside the front cover. You can't
miss it — it's headlined "When
you can't smell the difference
between you and your woman
you're in trouble."
There's another ad inside the
back cover that carries the
unfortunate news that the
Chaparral is even now plotting a
Reg Day issue for next autumn.
Some people just can't leave a
corpse to rest in peace.
Like some sort of botched-up
Lazarus, the Stanford Chaparral
periodically tries to rise from the
grave. Be warned: it happened
again this week, with its usual
degree of unsuccess.
The funniest thing about this
new issue of the Chappie is the
price: Editor Mike Dornheim
and his fun-loving squad of
Mongoloid editors are charging
50 cents a copy. Actually that's
a pretty good price for an
abortion, which is what you're
paying for.
For your cash you can read
articles on such hilarious
subjects as — now don't get too
excited — William Shockley,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
tourists, and commencement.

For those who have some kind
of bizarre sexual hangup about
Dornheim, the issue is really a
great deal: he's in 22 — count
them, 22 — photos. You can
pant over them for months.
