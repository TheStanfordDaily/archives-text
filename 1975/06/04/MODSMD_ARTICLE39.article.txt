### GEORGE DOBBINS 
lo paraphrase Johnny
Carson's "Carnac The
Magnificent" routine, we
have here "the last
column."
I hank you, thank you
lor the cheers, the wild
applause and that rotten
tomato. Indeed, you are not
alone in your joy — after
all, this reviewer is now free
from the shackles of pen
and typewriter — at least
for a while.
And just think, because
I'm a senior, you won't
have to put up with me at
all next year. But bear with
these incessant ramblings
for just a few inches more.
Since this is the last
column, we'll concentrate
on events in the near future,
not just this week, largely
because the future holds
more diversity (no that
line wasn't stolen from
Daniel Moynihan).
But since we now have a
smooth transition, let us
note that the future's most
interesting, if not best, bet
will be Commencement
Day, June 15. Members of
the Winston Churchill Fan
Club recently described the
event by commenting,
"Never have so few done so
much to so many." If yoU
can get there — go. And if
you're a senior, try to stay
awake.
We realize that this week
you have to stay awake for
finals, and we're here to
help (Pacific Telephone,
are you listening?). Two
films particularly merit
your attention. On Sunday,
ASSU Flicks screens the
James Bond (remember
him?) thriller, The Man
With The Golden Gun,
starring Roger Moore ("The
Saint") at 6:30 and 9 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
The film, based on the last
Bond novel that lan
Fleming wrote, features
great chase sequences and
the usual assortment of
gadgets.
For a film that will make
you long for exams, watch

Curse Of The Undead
(1956) where a "vampire
stalks the west," on
Creature Feature Saturday
night at 9:30. Keep in mind
our old pun that vampires
suck blood while this film
simply — well, you know
the rest. But it should be
fun.
Ffere comes the
therapeutic part of the
column where we tell you
what's in store if you
survive the finals. On June
22, in San Jose's Spartan

Stadium, you can see Boz
Scaggs ("We Were Always
Sweethearts") and his
fabulous blues band.
If theater is your forte
(happy graduation, Dan),
Tony Randall and Jack
Klugman will act out their
TV roles in Neil Simon's
original comedy, The Odd
Couple, June 23 through 25
in Flint Center. They are
fabulous and we are sorry
the TV show won't be with
us anymore.
For a show that may be
with us forever (and a story
that definitely will), see
jesus Christ Superstar on
stage at the Orpheum
Theater from June 24
through July 6. Hard to
believe, but it was five years

ago that the rock-opera first
appeared before live
audiences.
Let us not leave out the
best concert on the rock
scene — Bill Graham's "Day
On the Green Number
Two" at the Oakland
Stadium, featuring the
Eagles and Doobie Brothers
on Sunday, June 29. The
San Jose-based Duobies are
fantastic showmen. And
they are one group of rock
performers whose live
performances equal the
quality of their records.
Speaking of records, Marvin
Gaye, a man who's made*
several, will appear at the
Circle Star Theatre June 27
through 29 (we heard this
through the grapevine —
sorry about that).
Finally, let us urge you
to come to Stanford during
the first few days of July to
hear the Preservation HalJ
jazz Band. They will be
here through the Fourth,
when they will put on a
family picnic show in Frost
Amphitheater. We thank
the Office Of Public Events
for annually bringing them
back for more.
The work "thank" is a
good place to bring this
column to a halt. To those
we've slighted, thanks for
putting up with us. To
those, we haven't, well, we
probably weren't trying
hard enough. We'll see what
we can do in the future.
Until then, straight ahead.

through 29 (we heard this
through the grapevine —
sorry about that).
Finally, let us urge you
to come to Stanford during
the first few days of July to
hear the Preservation HalJ
jazz Band. They will be
here through the Fourth,
when they will put on a
family picnic show in Frost
Amphitheater. We thank
the Office Of Public Events
for annually bringing them
back for more.
The work "thank" is a
good place to bring this
column to a halt. To those
we've slighted, thanks for
putting up with us. To
those, we haven't, well, we
probably weren't trying
hard enough. We'll see what
we can do in the future.
Until then, straight ahead.

and band on Sunday, June 8 at
FJ Camino Park.
lo paraphrase Johnny
Carson's "Carnac The
Magnificent" routine, we
have here "the last
column."
I hank you, thank you
lor the cheers, the wild
applause and that rotten
tomato. Indeed, you are not
alone in your joy — after
all, this reviewer is now free
from the shackles of pen
and typewriter — at least
for a while.
And just think, because
I'm a senior, you won't
have to put up with me at
all next year. But bear with
these incessant ramblings
for just a few inches more.
Since this is the last
column, we'll concentrate
on events in the near future,
not just this week, largely
because the future holds
more diversity (no that
line wasn't stolen from
Daniel Moynihan).
But since we now have a
smooth transition, let us
note that the future's most
interesting, if not best, bet
will be Commencement
Day, June 15. Members of
the Winston Churchill Fan
Club recently described the
event by commenting,
"Never have so few done so
much to so many." If yoU
can get there — go. And if
you're a senior, try to stay
awake.
We realize that this week
you have to stay awake for
finals, and we're here to
help (Pacific Telephone,
are you listening?). Two
films particularly merit
your attention. On Sunday,
ASSU Flicks screens the
James Bond (remember
him?) thriller, The Man
With The Golden Gun,
starring Roger Moore ("The
Saint") at 6:30 and 9 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
The film, based on the last
Bond novel that lan
Fleming wrote, features
great chase sequences and
the usual assortment of
gadgets.
For a film that will make
you long for exams, watch

Curse Of The Undead
(1956) where a "vampire
stalks the west," on
Creature Feature Saturday
night at 9:30. Keep in mind
our old pun that vampires
suck blood while this film
simply — well, you know
the rest. But it should be
fun.
Ffere comes the
therapeutic part of the
column where we tell you
what's in store if you
survive the finals. On June
22, in San Jose's Spartan

Stadium, you can see Boz
Scaggs ("We Were Always
Sweethearts") and his
fabulous blues band.
If theater is your forte
(happy graduation, Dan),
Tony Randall and Jack
Klugman will act out their
TV roles in Neil Simon's
original comedy, The Odd
Couple, June 23 through 25
in Flint Center. They are
fabulous and we are sorry
the TV show won't be with
us anymore.
For a show that may be
with us forever (and a story
that definitely will), see
jesus Christ Superstar on
stage at the Orpheum
Theater from June 24
through July 6. Hard to
believe, but it was five years

ago that the rock-opera first
appeared before live
audiences.
Let us not leave out the
best concert on the rock
scene — Bill Graham's "Day
On the Green Number
Two" at the Oakland
Stadium, featuring the
Eagles and Doobie Brothers
on Sunday, June 29. The
San Jose-based Duobies are
fantastic showmen. And
they are one group of rock
performers whose live
performances equal the
quality of their records.
Speaking of records, Marvin
Gaye, a man who's made*
several, will appear at the
Circle Star Theatre June 27
through 29 (we heard this
through the grapevine —
sorry about that).

fabulous and we are sorry
the TV show won't be with
us anymore.
For a show that may be
with us forever (and a story
that definitely will), see
jesus Christ Superstar on
stage at the Orpheum
Theater from June 24
through July 6. Hard to
believe, but it was five years

ago that the rock-opera first
appeared before live
audiences.
Let us not leave out the
best concert on the rock
scene — Bill Graham's "Day
On the Green Number
Two" at the Oakland
Stadium, featuring the
Eagles and Doobie Brothers
on Sunday, June 29. The
San Jose-based Duobies are
fantastic showmen. And
they are one group of rock
performers whose live
performances equal the
quality of their records.
Speaking of records, Marvin
Gaye, a man who's made*
several, will appear at the
Circle Star Theatre June 27
through 29 (we heard this
through the grapevine —
sorry about that).
Finally, let us urge you
to come to Stanford during
the first few days of July to
hear the Preservation HalJ
jazz Band. They will be
here through the Fourth,
when they will put on a
family picnic show in Frost
Amphitheater. We thank
the Office Of Public Events
for annually bringing them
back for more.
The work "thank" is a
good place to bring this
column to a halt. To those
we've slighted, thanks for
putting up with us. To
those, we haven't, well, we
probably weren't trying
hard enough. We'll see what
we can do in the future.
Until then, straight ahead.
