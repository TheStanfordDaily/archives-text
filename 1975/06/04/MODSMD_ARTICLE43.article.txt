HEW: Equality For Women In Sports
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration told the
nation's schools, colleges and universities yesterday that
they must permit women equal opportunity to participate
in athletics.
In making public its new regulations, the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare, with the approval of
President Ford, said equal expenditures are not required
but the "necessary funds" must be made available for
women sports.
Congress has 45 days to veto the new regulations which
become effective July 21 if either the House or Senate
does not disapprove them.
It was understood that a House education
subcommittee, under the chairmanship of James G.
o'llara, D-Mich., would hold public hearings on the new
regulations before the end of the month.
SLA: Jury Asks To Reread Testimony
SACRAMENTO — The jury in the murder trial of two
Symbionese Liberation Army members asked yesterday to
have a second batch of testimony reread.
After sending that request to the court late in its fifth
day of deliberations, the jury of eight women and four
men in the Marcus Foster murder trial retired to its hotel

for the evening.
Court sources said they did not know which testimony
the jury wanted to hear from the two-month trial of
Russell Little and Joseph Remiro. The court was ordered
reconvened today to reread testimony.
Ozzie Nelson Dead At Ajje 69
LOS ANGELES — Ozzie Nelson, whose wholesome
Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet on television and radio
amused a generation of Americans, died yesterdav. He was
69.
Harriet, his wife and partner, was at his bedside.
He had undergone surgery for cancer of the liver eight
months ago. He died in his Hollywood home.
"Ozzie knew he was going to go, and he viewed it
philosophically," a family friend said. "He was working
on another book until the end."
At athletic 170 pounds most of his adult life, Nelson
had thinned to 130 but continued to visit his office until
eight weeks ago.
The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet set records for
longevity, beginning in 1944 on radio and then jumping to
television in 1952, where it ran 14 years.
The Nelsons' sons, Ricky and David, grew up on the
show, and after they married, their wives joined the cast.
The television show finally went off the air in 1966.
"It was getting pretty diffused because of the way the
family had grown," Ozzie said.
They returned to television in 1972 with a syndicated
show, Ozzie's Girls.
