# HEART TRANSPLANT PERFORMED
## 
### 
A 39-year-old Las Vegas, Nev. woman received a
heart transplant yesterday in the second such operation
in two days at Stanford University Hospital, officials
reported.
The unidentified woman was reported in
satisfactory condition, as was a 50-year-old Southern
California man who received a new heart in a five-hour
operation Monday. Both operations were performed by
transplant pioneer Dr. Norman Shumway and his
surgical team.
The woman's surgery brought to 87 the number of
heart transplants at Stanford. Officials said 32 of the
recipients are living, including two persons who
received new hearts in January 1970.
