# The 						'Transition' Moves On
## As The IS Name Changes, TDS Officials Consider Adding A Soda Parlor And A Pub 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The Transition, the fast-food
service which took the place of the
failing Tresidder Memorial Union
(TMU) cafeteria last September, is
here to stay. But while the face may
be familiar, the name will change.
Bob Caselli, TDS food service
director, admitted earlier this week
that the name is not appropriate
anymore, and said that the company
he works for may change the title this
summer.
Under an agreement signed with the
University late last month, the
company TDS Inc., currently operates
the entire Tresidder Food Service,
which includes Encina Commons, the
Transition, the Coffee House,
Tresidder catering services and athletic
team meals.
Caselli said he's not sure many
people think of the TMU fast-food
service as the Transition anyway, and a
change in the title, he said, will
probably have little effect on business.
$50,000 Deficit
Other changes planned for TMU
definitely should affect business,

however, Caselli said, although the
University is still projecting a $50,000
deficit for Tresidder Food Service by
the end of the next fiscal year.
Beginning this summer, the
Transition will be serving hot
breakfast, he said. "If there's a
market," the service will continue next
fall.
"Our projections seem to indicate
that there will be a big enough market
for the service to continue," he added.
TDS also plans to bring "a soda
fountain back into operation in
Tresidder," according to Caselli. The
fountain will sell items like ice cream,
milk shakes and sundaes.
Duplicate Services
Caselli admitted that a soda
fountain might duplicate some services
currently provided by Marcel's pastry
shop, also housed in Tresidder.
TDS plans to continue staying open
until 11 p.m. next fall, a recent change
which has been "financially
successful," according to Caselli.
He said the extra hours of
operation at night are paying for
themselves.
TDS also "plans to start a ball
rolling for an on-campus pub." said
Caselli.
Financial Negotiations
TDS will begin negotiations this
summer for an operating contract with
the University and at the same time
apply for a liquor license, he said.
Caselli expressed confidence that
the University and TDS will come to a
financial agreement for operating the
pub.
However, last summer negotiations
on just such an agreement broke
down.
Caselli said TDS and the University
should reach an agreement this time,
because "TDS is currently contracted
on a different basis" than it was last
year.
Complications
"The disagreement last year was
over whose money, how much of it
and for how long," Caselli said, adding
that he thinks such a problem will not
occur this year.
Roth Caselli and Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Dan Williams declined
to speculate when a pub might open
on campus, because of the possibility
of complications arrising while TDS
applies to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) for
a liquor license.

Once the application is submitted
the 45-day waiting period follows.
During this period a "notice of intent"
to sell beer and wine must be posted
for 30 days. If anyone objects, he can
demand a hearing and such hearings
can drag on for years.
For example, the Faculty Club,
which has a liquor license allowing sale
of hard liquor, spent a year and a half
obtaining ABC approval.
Baskin-Bobbins 'Deferred'
Previous plans for changes in ITVIU
included enlarging Marcel's pastry
shop, and adding a Baskin-Kobbins
franchise, various clothing stores and a
flower shop.
The University still plans to move
and expand Marcel's, but has not
decided on a new site for the
operation, Williams said.
Flans for adding a Baskin Bobbins
franchise have been "deferred,"
because "we think it would be a
duplication of services already
provided," Williams said.


MOVIN' ON -The Transition, Tresidder's fast-food service, has inspired some highly creative language over the past nine
months. Now the operation is changing its name, and maybe management will provide an outlet for all the creativity by
sponsoring a contest to come up with a new name.

Caselli expressed confidence that
the University and TDS will come to a
financial agreement for operating the
pub.
However, last summer negotiations
on just such an agreement broke
down.
Caselli said TDS and the University
should reach an agreement this time,
because "TDS is currently contracted
on a different basis" than it was last
year.
Complications
"The disagreement last year was
over whose money, how much of it
and for how long," Caselli said, adding
that he thinks such a problem will not
occur this year.
Roth Caselli and Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Dan Williams declined
to speculate when a pub might open
on campus, because of the possibility
of complications arrising while TDS
applies to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) for
a liquor license.

Once the application is submitted
the 45-day waiting period follows.
During this period a "notice of intent"
to sell beer and wine must be posted
for 30 days. If anyone objects, he can
demand a hearing and such hearings
can drag on for years.
For example, the Faculty Club,
which has a liquor license allowing sale
of hard liquor, spent a year and a half
obtaining ABC approval.
Baskin-Bobbins 'Deferred'
Previous plans for changes in ITVIU
included enlarging Marcel's pastry
shop, and adding a Baskin-Kobbins
franchise, various clothing stores and a
flower shop.
The University still plans to move
and expand Marcel's, but has not
decided on a new site for the
operation, Williams said.
Flans for adding a Baskin Bobbins
franchise have been "deferred,"
because "we think it would be a
duplication of services already
provided," Williams said.


MOVIN' ON -The Transition, Tresidder's fast-food service, has inspired some highly creative language over the past nine
months. Now the operation is changing its name, and maybe management will provide an outlet for all the creativity by
sponsoring a contest to come up with a new name.
The Transition, the fast-food
service which took the place of the
failing Tresidder Memorial Union
(TMU) cafeteria last September, is
here to stay. But while the face may
be familiar, the name will change.
Bob Caselli, TDS food service
director, admitted earlier this week
that the name is not appropriate
anymore, and said that the company
he works for may change the title this
summer.
Under an agreement signed with the
University late last month, the
company TDS Inc., currently operates
the entire Tresidder Food Service,
which includes Encina Commons, the
Transition, the Coffee House,
Tresidder catering services and athletic
team meals.
Caselli said he's not sure many
people think of the TMU fast-food
service as the Transition anyway, and a
change in the title, he said, will
probably have little effect on business.
$50,000 Deficit
Other changes planned for TMU
definitely should affect business,

however, Caselli said, although the
University is still projecting a $50,000
deficit for Tresidder Food Service by
the end of the next fiscal year.
Beginning this summer, the
Transition will be serving hot
breakfast, he said. "If there's a
market," the service will continue next
fall.
"Our projections seem to indicate
that there will be a big enough market
for the service to continue," he added.
TDS also plans to bring "a soda
fountain back into operation in
Tresidder," according to Caselli. The
fountain will sell items like ice cream,
milk shakes and sundaes.
Duplicate Services
Caselli admitted that a soda
fountain might duplicate some services
currently provided by Marcel's pastry
shop, also housed in Tresidder.
TDS plans to continue staying open
until 11 p.m. next fall, a recent change
which has been "financially
successful," according to Caselli.
He said the extra hours of
operation at night are paying for
themselves.
TDS also "plans to start a ball
rolling for an on-campus pub." said
Caselli.

TDS will begin negotiations this
summer for an operating contract with
the University and at the same time
apply for a liquor license, he said.
