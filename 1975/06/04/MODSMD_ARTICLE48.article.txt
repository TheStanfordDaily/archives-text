# Berlin Villa Plans Axed By Stanford
## 
### ELIZABETH POLLOCK 
The Overseas Studies Office has
withdrawn from its commitment to
rent a villa from the city government
of Berlin next year and Stanford
students attending the Berlin program
will probably stay with families or in
dormitories.
Assoc. Director of Overseas Studies
Don Price said that originally the
architecturally significant villa was
going to be renovated by the city of
Berlin and then rented to Stanford for
its overseas program. The villa plan
originated because "We | the overseas
directors| didn't think it would be
possible to get private rooms for the
students" in Berlin, Price said.
But renovation cost increases and a
change in the city government have
meant that Berlin cannot guarantee
that the 1912 structure, designed by
architect Hermann Muthius, would be
habitable by Jan. 1.
Changes
Because plans for Stanford-in-Berlin
"were predicated on getting the villa."
Price >aid plans were changed when it
became apparent that the villa could
not be readied by winter quarter.
Price added that renovation and
refurnishing of the villa would take at
least nine months and Stanford had
only planned lo rent the villa until
June 1977. "We were rather happy to
get out of the villa contract," he said.
Price said he does not think
negotiations to rent the entire villa will
be resumed. "Within the scope of our
financial planning ... we don't want
to tie ourselves to buildings," he said.
Office Space
However, he continued, "we will
need to rent some space for offices,"
and to rent the first floor of the villa
for that purpose would be "relatively
inexpensive and very desirable."
Presently, Stanford-in-Berlin uses
space at the Frei Universitat in Berlin
for classes.
"We are able to obtain private
Berlin families for the Berlin students"
|to sta> with). Price said, so the villa
is not needed for student housing.
Living with families is "better
programmatically," Price added.
Of the 18 students in Berlin this
quarter, 11 are living with "real Berlin
families"; two are living with
American families in Berlin and are
babysitting in exchange for room and
board, two are in student dorms; and
three are in workers' dorms. The
faculty live in apartments.
Stanford-in-Berlin's attendance was
10 for winter quarter, 18 this spring,
and applications are "approaching 30"
for next year. Price said. Berlin w ill be
the only German campus with a
summer program next year.
