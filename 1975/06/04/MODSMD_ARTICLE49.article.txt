# ASSU Senate Postpones Action On COSS Student Nominations
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Senate voted 10-3
Monday night to accept all nomination
committee recommendations except
those for the Committee on Services
to Students (COSS) Subcommittee on
Residences.
Action on the subcommittee was
tabled.
New ASSU Financial Manager Chris
Cline reported that the price for the
Sunday Flicks will be raised to 75
cents summer quarter.
The senate also approved 12-1 an
ASSU operating budget of $89,687,
for next year, the same as this year's.
Power
Discussion on the nominations
committee report centered at first
around how much power the senate
could exert over the committee. Sen.
Tim Conway expressed fears that the
senate served only as a rubber stamp.
Conway attempted to add a name
to the nominations committee list in
place of another nominee, who,
Vice President Dave Galligan reported,
has refused the position.
Chairman Janice Haney ruled that
the senate could accept or reject the
nominations committee report, but
not change it. Her ruling was accepted
7-5-1.
After further discussion, the senate
decided to consider the COSS
subcommittee on residences separately
and accepted all other nominations.
Sens. Conway, Kevin McDermott
and Vic Petroff objected to the
subcommittee recommendations,
noting that the nominations
committee had been charged to
appoint a fraternity member because
of the prevalence of the fraternity
issue this year.
Sen. Pieter Winsemius expressed
disappointment that no graduate
student had been appointed to the
subcommittee, despite a senate charge
to the nominations committee to do
so.
Galligan, also nominations
committee chairman, replied that no
graduate students had applied for the

position. He also noted that, because
the nominations committee is not a
continuous body, the charge to select
a graduate student and fraternity
member to the subcommittee was not
made clear to the current nominations
committee.
Senators opposing the residence
subcommittee recommendations urged
the senate to reject the
recommendation until a fraternity

member was placed on it. McDermott
argued that if any decisions were made
this summer on residences, the frat
viewpoint would not be represented
with the subcommittee under
discussion, — but the decision would
still be represented as reflecting
student input, because of the two
students on the subcommittee.
John Pierog, nominations
committee member, maintained that

the frats exert enough influence
through the Inter-Fraternity Council
and aluinni. lie suggested that ihe frats
could have a speaking representative
on the subcommittee.
McDermott replied that neither of
those alternatives carried the force of a
voting member and observed that
non-subcommittee members are not
allowed into residence subcommittee
meetings.

Sens. Conway, Kevin McDermott
and Vic Petroff objected to the
subcommittee recommendations,
noting that the nominations
committee had been charged to
appoint a fraternity member because
of the prevalence of the fraternity
issue this year.
Sen. Pieter Winsemius expressed
disappointment that no graduate
student had been appointed to the
subcommittee, despite a senate charge
to the nominations committee to do
so.
Galligan, also nominations
committee chairman, replied that no
graduate students had applied for the

position. He also noted that, because
the nominations committee is not a
continuous body, the charge to select
a graduate student and fraternity
member to the subcommittee was not
made clear to the current nominations
committee.
Senators opposing the residence
subcommittee recommendations urged
the senate to reject the
recommendation until a fraternity

member was placed on it. McDermott
argued that if any decisions were made
this summer on residences, the frat
viewpoint would not be represented
with the subcommittee under
discussion, — but the decision would
still be represented as reflecting
student input, because of the two
students on the subcommittee.

committee member, maintained that

the frats exert enough influence

those alternatives carried the force of a
voting member and observed that
non-subcommittee members are not
allowed into residence subcommittee
meetings.
