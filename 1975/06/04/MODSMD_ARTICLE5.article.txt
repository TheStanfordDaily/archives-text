# Drug Board Denied Funds
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
The Palo Alto City Council Monday
night voted 5-2 not to renew the city's
contract with the Palo Alto
Community Drug Abuse Board
(PACDAB). The four-part motion was
decided after nearly four hours of
public hearing and council debate.
The council's major quarrel with
PACDAB was the political activity of
the Collective (one of PACDAB's
projects) such as use of public facilities
to sponsor a Leninist/Marxist seminar
and distribution of a pamphlet titled
"Uncle Sam the Pusher Man."
Councilman Kirke Comstock

supported the idea of a drug abuse
program but added that, "I cannot
support another extension of
PACDAB .. . There has not been
sensitive dedication to the needs and
concerns of other parts of the
community."
According to Comstock, the
council "should not have to go to the
organization and ask for withdrawal of
the pamphlet."
Compromises
At the start of the meeting,
PACDAB presented a set of
compromises to the council. The
statement specified that the PACDAB
Board of Directors shall approve
drug-related information prior to
public distribution.
"This represents the best effort
thus far of the corporation
[PACDAB] and the staff to address
the concerns of the community and
the council," said Carleen Bedwell,
PACDAB staff liaison to the council.
"If this material is not sufficient,
then we need more guidance from
you," added Bedwell.
"The proposed resolution reaffirms
the Board's responsibility for drug
abuse programs," said PACDAB
Chairman Lincoln Mitchell. "We asked
the staff to draft something they can
agree with in substance and form.
They are committed to this."
Community Support
Thirty-six members of the overflow
crowd addressed the council in
support of PACDAB. These citizens
included doctors, students, elementary
school teachers, nurses, former heroin
addicts, counselors and PACDAB
members. Collective member Carole
Smith presented a petition with 2000
names of people in the community
requesting that PACDAB be funded.
There were no statements opposing
PACDAB's refunding.

"The Collective has offered higher
and more comprehensive service than
any other program in this area," said
Tony Circe, representative for Frank
Sederwhite of the East Palo Alto
Municipal Council.
"The Collective's political beliefs,
do not interfere with their drug abuse
programs and their drug services. Yet
this is the most crucial aspect of these
services," said Smith.
Tragic Mistake
"We do not work at the Collective
for money .. . but because of our
political beliefs, our principles," she
added. "We are dedicated to the
preservation of human life."
Palo Alto psychiatrist John Goletsis
said he had "never heard any
particular drug program supported as
this one here." He emphasized that the
community is at stake. "A negative
vote is a tragic mistake for us. The
Collective doesn't lose. They have
already proved they can do their job."
Councilman John Berwald
expressed doubt that the Collective
would stop its political activities.
"Now you are ready to be more
conciliatory. Now you are ready to
not dabble in one-sided political
beliefs without the approval of the
board ... You agree now to renew the
contract."
Councilwoman Enid Pearson
praised the Collective for living up to
its contractual agreements with the
city. "This is an effective program,"
she said. "We must fund it."
"The fight has just begun," said
Collective member Ray Hofstedter
yesterday. "We will seek funds
elsewhere and continue to put pressure
on the city."
Hofstedter explained that the
"program began in people's homes and
if necessary we will go back to treating
people in Collective members' homes."
