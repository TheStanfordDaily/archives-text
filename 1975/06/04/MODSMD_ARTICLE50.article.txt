# Goheen: Most Troubles Successfully Resolved
## 
### PAIGE CHERNO 
University Ombudsman and
Emeritus Philosophy Prof. John
Goheen claims that at least
three-quarters of the 260 cases he has
dealt with this year "have been
resolved in some satisfactory manner."
The ombudsman exists to "receive,
examine and channel the complaints
and grievances of members of the
Stanford community, and to secure
expedious and impartial redress,"
according to the 1969 report of the
Committee of 15, which proposed the
office.
Goheen says a "very substantial"
number of people who come to him
are students. The "impersonality of
the system" frustrates their own
attempts at changing things, he said.
Petition denials, for example, often
bring students to the ombudsman for
reevaluation. Goheen "tries to make
the total situation more humane, more
human."
Grading
"Unevenness of grading in large
courses is a major problem, and
extremely difficult to deal with."
according to Goheen. Sometimes he
will talk to a specific instructor. "But
it is hard to do anything unless there is
a blatant error, because the
presumption always is that grading has
been fair," he added.

"Very often it is a problem of
someone not knowing where to go,
what to do," Goheen said. Students
can, for example, follow formal
grievance procedures within a
department to complain about a grade.
"But nobody does that," he added.
"A given instance can arouse
interest in much more general issues,"
Goheen stated. One of the
ombudsman's duties is to "act on his
own initiative when he perceives an
inconsistency or an unfairness in the
life of the University," according to
the 1973 revision of the C-15 report.
Food Service
When a student complained to
Goheen about the inadequacy of food
for vegetarians in the dining halls, he
took a general look into the problem,
concluding that an adequate diet is
important. "Vegetarian students
should not have to eat salads every
meal," Goheen remarked.
He said he is "concerned about
making people aware of where
students feel dissatisfied and why,"
adding that solving a problem is often
"simply a matter of bringing attention
to it."
Non-faculty staff members often
approach Goheen when they are
concerned about promotions, and fair
evaluation of their work, he said.

OMBUDSMAN—Ombudsman John Goheen, an emeritus professor of
philosophy, says he has successfully resolved about three-quarters of all
complaints brought to him this year.
"The University has a large
Personnel Department. We bring cases
to them and ask for special attention.
They are usually very cooperative."
The problems Goheen says he
cannot solve usually involve a "rule a
person overlooked or is not conscious
of." Although he will ask for
exceptions, he said he is usually turned
down and told that if a given office
makes one exception, it will have to
make exceptions for everyone.
"I don't believe that's true,"
Goheen said, adding that the cases are
usually unique. "But it is a natural
institutional response."
Student Assistant?
Goheen's fulltime secretary, Sara
Stephenson, is his only staff member.
He is hoping to have a student
assistant joining the staff, if a few
problems can be worked out.

"simply a matter of bringing attention
to it."

OMBUDSMAN—Ombudsman John Goheen, an emeritus professor of
philosophy, says he has successfully resolved about three-quarters of all
complaints brought to him this year.
"The University has a large
Personnel Department. We bring cases
to them and ask for special attention.
They are usually very cooperative."
The problems Goheen says he
cannot solve usually involve a "rule a
person overlooked or is not conscious
of." Although he will ask for
exceptions, he said he is usually turned
down and told that if a given office
makes one exception, it will have to
make exceptions for everyone.
"I don't believe that's true,"
Goheen said, adding that the cases are
usually unique. "But it is a natural
institutional response."
Student Assistant?
Goheen's fulltime secretary, Sara
Stephenson, is his only staff member.
He is hoping to have a student
assistant joining the staff, if a few
problems can be worked out.
University Ombudsman and
Emeritus Philosophy Prof. John
Goheen claims that at least
three-quarters of the 260 cases he has
dealt with this year "have been
resolved in some satisfactory manner."
The ombudsman exists to "receive,
examine and channel the complaints
and grievances of members of the
Stanford community, and to secure
expedious and impartial redress,"
according to the 1969 report of the
Committee of 15, which proposed the
office.
Goheen says a "very substantial"
number of people who come to him
are students. The "impersonality of
the system" frustrates their own
attempts at changing things, he said.
Petition denials, for example, often
bring students to the ombudsman for
reevaluation. Goheen "tries to make
the total situation more humane, more
human."
Grading
"Unevenness of grading in large
courses is a major problem, and
extremely difficult to deal with."
according to Goheen. Sometimes he
will talk to a specific instructor. "But
it is hard to do anything unless there is
a blatant error, because the
presumption always is that grading has
been fair," he added.

"Very often it is a problem of
someone not knowing where to go,
what to do," Goheen said. Students
can, for example, follow formal
grievance procedures within a
department to complain about a grade.
"But nobody does that," he added.
"A given instance can arouse
interest in much more general issues,"
Goheen stated. One of the
ombudsman's duties is to "act on his
own initiative when he perceives an
inconsistency or an unfairness in the
life of the University," according to
the 1973 revision of the C-15 report.
Food Service
When a student complained to
Goheen about the inadequacy of food
for vegetarians in the dining halls, he
took a general look into the problem,
concluding that an adequate diet is
important. "Vegetarian students
should not have to eat salads every
meal," Goheen remarked.
He said he is "concerned about
making people aware of where
students feel dissatisfied and why,"
adding that solving a problem is often
"simply a matter of bringing attention
to it."
Non-faculty staff members often

concerned about promotions, and fair
