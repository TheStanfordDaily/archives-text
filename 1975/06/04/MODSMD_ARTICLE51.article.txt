# Medical Center Doctors Save Nearly 400 Lives Transplanting Heart Valves From Pigs To Humans

Nearly 400 Medical Center
heart patients are alive today
thanks to heart valves
transplanted from pig's hearts.
A three-man team of
surgeons here, consisting of
Asst. Surgery Prof. Edward
Stinson, Asst. Surgery Prof.
Randall Griepp, and Surgery
Prof. Norman Shumway, say
that oight years of research
preceeded the now intensive
use of the valves.
The valves are taken from
the pig's heart, mounted on a
flexible polypropylene (plastic)
base, and coated with Dacron
before implantation, report the
surgeons in a recent article
published in the Annals of
Thoracic Surgery.
The surgeons conclude in
their article that the technique
"provides a technically and
functionally satisfactory valve
substitute," with durability
that may "significantly
exceed" earlier transplant
methods.
The patients have

experienced improved
functioning of their hearts,
doctors say, and often are able
to enjoy more physical
activity. The pig valves cause
patients less general physical
weakness than their mechanical
equivalents.
The eight years of research
were spent experimenting with
various animal . hearts as
potential implants. Pigs hearts
proved the most satisfactory
because they are "similar to
human hearts," say the
doctors. The pigs are
slaughtered at the age
necessary to match the size of
the patient's heart.
The valves are mainly used
in patients suffering from
calcified, rheumatic or
congenital heart problems.
Since 1971, 200 Stanford
patients have received mitral
valve replacements, 126 have
received aortic, and 35 have
received both. The survival rate
has been 98 percent.
The valves are now used
throughout the United States

and abroad, so that a patient
may go "almost anyplace" for
an implant, the doctors say.
But the trio prefers that
patients come here for the
implant, because "we believe
that we do it better."
The pig valves are a great
improvement over mechanical
or homographic valves taken
from dead humans according
to the doctors. Because most
cadavers are adult, surgeons
had difficulty matching the
heart size to the patient's
needs. And mechanical
implants make noise and can
deteriorate in a few years.
The doctors say the pig
valves are noiseless, and so far
there has been only one
mechanical failure. No
deterioration has been
reported. Pig valves also
provide an opportunity for
doctors to diagnose
deterioration early if it occurs,
since small murmers occur in a
deteriorating pig valve.
When mechanical implants
fail, they can result in heart

attacks, leaving patients little
chance for quick surgefy.
There have been few
incidences of throm
beombolism, or blood clots,
with pig valves, which are a
major cause of death with
other transplant methods. With
oLher valves clots sometimes
break off and travel to the
brain, causing strokes.
Usually transplant patients
require anticoagulants, but
they aren't necessary with pig
valves, the surgeons say.
Anticoagulants posed special
disadvantages to the elderly,
who may be fragile or don't
heal well, and are a
disadvantage to the young
since "they get into so many
accidents and bleed a lot," the
doctors report..
A major advantage of using
pigs' valves is there is no tissue
rejection of the valve. This is
because the "valves are
rendered inert - they are no
longer live tissue, and therefore
do not excite an
immunological reaction, the
doctors say. "If the tissue were
alive, the patient's own heart
would reject the implant."
The valves are preserved in a
chemical fixative,
glutaraldehyde, which also kills
the valves, and renders them
less susceptible to
deterioration. Formerly they
were preserved in
formaldehyde, which caused
early deterioration.
The doctors explain that
glutaraldehyde is actually quite
similar to formaldehyde, but
its slight chemical difference
has resulted in a superior
fixative.
Another article co-authored
by the three surgeons reports

that experiments are underway
to extend pig valve methods
using other animal curculatory
system parts in surgery.
The surgeons are
experimenting, for example,
with calf and cow arteries, to
replace diseased human
arteries, or to provide a
connective shunt for dialysis
treatments for those with
kidney failure.
"Pig arteries will encourage
more valve replacement surgery
in the young and very old," say
the doctors, and could become
an important trend in the
future. The increasing
availability of valves by
commercial means has
facilitated valve surgery here
and abroad.

using other animal curculatory
system parts in surgery.
The surgeons are
experimenting, for example,
with calf and cow arteries, to
replace diseased human
arteries, or to provide a
connective shunt for dialysis
treatments for those with
kidney failure.
"Pig arteries will encourage
more valve replacement surgery
in the young and very old," say
the doctors, and could become
an important trend in the
future. The increasing
availability of valves by
commercial means has
facilitated valve surgery here
and abroad.
Nearly 400 Medical Center
heart patients are alive today
thanks to heart valves
transplanted from pig's hearts.
A three-man team of
surgeons here, consisting of
Asst. Surgery Prof. Edward
Stinson, Asst. Surgery Prof.
Randall Griepp, and Surgery
Prof. Norman Shumway, say
that oight years of research
preceeded the now intensive
use of the valves.
The valves are taken from
the pig's heart, mounted on a
flexible polypropylene (plastic)
base, and coated with Dacron
before implantation, report the
surgeons in a recent article
published in the Annals of
Thoracic Surgery.
The surgeons conclude in
their article that the technique
"provides a technically and
functionally satisfactory valve
substitute," with durability
that may "significantly
exceed" earlier transplant
methods.
The patients have

experienced improved
functioning of their hearts,
doctors say, and often are able
to enjoy more physical
activity. The pig valves cause
patients less general physical
weakness than their mechanical
equivalents.
The eight years of research
were spent experimenting with
various animal . hearts as
potential implants. Pigs hearts
proved the most satisfactory
because they are "similar to
human hearts," say the
doctors. The pigs are
slaughtered at the age
necessary to match the size of
the patient's heart.
The valves are mainly used
in patients suffering from
calcified, rheumatic or
congenital heart problems.
Since 1971, 200 Stanford
patients have received mitral
valve replacements, 126 have
received aortic, and 35 have
received both. The survival rate
has been 98 percent.
The valves are now used
throughout the United States

and abroad, so that a patient
may go "almost anyplace" for
an implant, the doctors say.
But the trio prefers that
patients come here for the
implant, because "we believe
that we do it better."
The pig valves are a great
improvement over mechanical
or homographic valves taken
from dead humans according
to the doctors. Because most
cadavers are adult, surgeons
had difficulty matching the
heart size to the patient's
needs. And mechanical
implants make noise and can
deteriorate in a few years.
The doctors say the pig
valves are noiseless, and so far
there has been only one
mechanical failure. No
deterioration has been
reported. Pig valves also
provide an opportunity for
doctors to diagnose
deterioration early if it occurs,
since small murmers occur in a
deteriorating pig valve.
When mechanical implants
fail, they can result in heart

attacks, leaving patients little
chance for quick surgefy.
There have been few
incidences of throm
beombolism, or blood clots,
with pig valves, which are a
major cause of death with
other transplant methods. With
oLher valves clots sometimes
break off and travel to the
brain, causing strokes.
Usually transplant patients
require anticoagulants, but
they aren't necessary with pig
valves, the surgeons say.
Anticoagulants posed special
disadvantages to the elderly,
who may be fragile or don't
heal well, and are a
disadvantage to the young
since "they get into so many
accidents and bleed a lot," the
doctors report..
A major advantage of using
pigs' valves is there is no tissue
rejection of the valve. This is
because the "valves are
rendered inert - they are no
longer live tissue, and therefore
do not excite an
immunological reaction, the
doctors say. "If the tissue were
alive, the patient's own heart
would reject the implant."
The valves are preserved in a
chemical fixative,
glutaraldehyde, which also kills
the valves, and renders them
less susceptible to
deterioration. Formerly they
were preserved in
formaldehyde, which caused
early deterioration.
The doctors explain that
glutaraldehyde is actually quite
similar to formaldehyde, but
its slight chemical difference
has resulted in a superior
fixative.

glutaraldehyde, which also kills
the valves, and renders them
less susceptible to
deterioration. Formerly they
were preserved in
formaldehyde, which caused
early deterioration.
The doctors explain that
glutaraldehyde is actually quite
similar to formaldehyde, but
its slight chemical difference
has resulted in a superior
fixative.
Another article co-authored
by the three surgeons reports

that experiments are underway
to extend pig valve methods
using other animal curculatory
system parts in surgery.
The surgeons are
experimenting, for example,
with calf and cow arteries, to
replace diseased human
arteries, or to provide a
connective shunt for dialysis
treatments for those with
kidney failure.
"Pig arteries will encourage
more valve replacement surgery
in the young and very old," say
the doctors, and could become
an important trend in the
future. The increasing
availability of valves by
commercial means has
facilitated valve surgery here
and abroad.
