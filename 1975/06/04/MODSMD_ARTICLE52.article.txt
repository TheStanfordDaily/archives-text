# Report Recommends Reforms In Undergraduate Counseling
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Each undergraduate department
should formulate an advising policy,
with increased undergraduate
involvement in the advising process the
SCIRE Task Force on Advising
recommended in a preliminary 1 report
released Monday.
The task force, comprised of some
30 students and faculty, presented a
cross-section of student opinion in its
report. The data were collected from a
brief analysis of questionnaires
distributed to 20 percent of the majors
in 10 University departments with the
highest enrollment, and from an open
meeting sponsored to discuss
departmental advising.
The report urges that all University

departments "specify a mechanism by
which each student will be associated
with a faculty member. If the
department does not assign faculty
advisers, each declared major should
be required by the department to
select a regular adviser soon after
declaring a major."
Assignments of advisers or student's
choices of advisers should be "based
on mutuality of interest and suitability
of the advisor to the individual
student," the report says, concluding
that advising works best when students
share some of their adviser's interests.
Whether students choose their advisers
or departments appoint them, the
report says, either students or advisors
should be able to initiate a change in

advisor.
The task force recommends that
students see their departmental
advisors at least once per quarter.
Questionnaires had revealed many
students and their advisers had little
contact.
The task force also urges each
department to prepare a handbook for
majors to provide information about
procedures for declaring a major and
major requirements, based on the
handbook for biology majors currently
in use.
Undergraduates should be involved
as peer advisers in the advising process
to complement faculty-student
contact, the report says. Advantages of
such a system are that students would

find advising more available than with
faculty advisors, and peer advisors
could arrange meetings between
students and faculty members.
Other possibilities mentioned in the
report to increase involvement in peer
advising are to establish a news letter
for students and to encourage students
to form departmental organizations.
The task force's final report will
include two appendices: a summary of
computer data and a detailed
explanation of peer advising programs
that now exist. The preliminary report
was issued "to provide a sort of
working paper to get feedback" on the
advising issue, said SCIRE Director
Alice Supton.

FEEDBACK —SCIRE Director Alice Supton says a task force report
suggesting changes in undergraduate advising was supposed to "provide a sort
of working paper to get feedback."
Each undergraduate department
should formulate an advising policy,
with increased undergraduate
involvement in the advising process the
SCIRE Task Force on Advising
recommended in a preliminary 1 report
released Monday.
The task force, comprised of some
30 students and faculty, presented a
cross-section of student opinion in its
report. The data were collected from a
brief analysis of questionnaires
distributed to 20 percent of the majors
in 10 University departments with the
highest enrollment, and from an open
meeting sponsored to discuss
departmental advising.
The report urges that all University

departments "specify a mechanism by
which each student will be associated
with a faculty member. If the
department does not assign faculty
advisers, each declared major should
be required by the department to
select a regular adviser soon after
declaring a major."
Assignments of advisers or student's
choices of advisers should be "based
on mutuality of interest and suitability
of the advisor to the individual
student," the report says, concluding
that advising works best when students
share some of their adviser's interests.
Whether students choose their advisers
or departments appoint them, the
report says, either students or advisors
should be able to initiate a change in

advisor.
The task force recommends that
students see their departmental
advisors at least once per quarter.
Questionnaires had revealed many
students and their advisers had little
contact.
The task force also urges each
department to prepare a handbook for
majors to provide information about
procedures for declaring a major and
major requirements, based on the
handbook for biology majors currently
in use.
Undergraduates should be involved
as peer advisers in the advising process
to complement faculty-student
contact, the report says. Advantages of
such a system are that students would

find advising more available than with
faculty advisors, and peer advisors
could arrange meetings between
students and faculty members.
Other possibilities mentioned in the
report to increase involvement in peer
advising are to establish a news letter
for students and to encourage students
to form departmental organizations.
The task force's final report will
include two appendices: a summary of
computer data and a detailed
explanation of peer advising programs
that now exist. The preliminary report
was issued "to provide a sort of
working paper to get feedback" on the
advising issue, said SCIRE Director
Alice Supton.
