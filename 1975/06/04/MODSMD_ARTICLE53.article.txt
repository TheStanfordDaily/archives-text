# 'Your Body Stinks!'
## Jokers Send Phony 'Playgirl' Letters 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AF) - "We will
not be able to use your body in our
centerfold," the letter says. "On
the scale of 0 to 10, your body was
\ rated -2."
The letter carries the name
Playgirl at the top and apparently
has been sent to men around the
country.
But a Playgirl magazine
spokesman said last week it is not
responsible for the mailings and
described them as "a very cruel
hoax."
Phil Paladino, public relations
• yx. !£sg3BsBBft <■

director for the women's magazine
whih features photos of nude men,
said Playgirl has received 44
inquiries about the letter — many
from people who think it is
legitimate.
The operation apparently
involves a chain letter type of
mechanics, he said, because the
letters bear postmarks from around
the country and they obviously
were composed on different
typewriters. They show different
logo styles at the top of the page,
different mailing addresses for

Playgirl and are signed with
different names, he said.
But the text is almost identical
on all the letters which Playgirl has
seen in the last few weeks.
After thanking the individual
for sending in his photographs, the
letter goes on to say in part:
"The rating was done by a panel
of women ranging in age from 65 to
75 years old. We tried to have our
panel of women in the
25-to-35-year-old bracket rate you,
but we could not get them to stop
laughing long enough."
