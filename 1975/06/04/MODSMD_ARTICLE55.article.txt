## Joan Marmmarella: Elegant, Flamboyant, Or Both? Italian Style Spices American Background 
### JANET GENDLER 
"I value personal style. I
never was one who believed in
being anonymous," says Joan
McConnell Marmmarella.
Marmmarella could never
hope to be anonymous. With her
long dancer's body, her thick
hair brushed with red, her
theatrical makeup, fashionable
Italian clothing and heaps of
exquisite jewelry she
immediately stands out in an
American crowd.
When in the U.S. she wears at
least one ring on each finger and
seven bracelets; her makeup and
jewelry is more extravagant in
Italy. At times she appears more
Italian than an Italian.
Marmmarella, who is teaching
at Stanford this spring, is an
Italian professor at the Florence
campus. Stan ford-in-Italy
students speculate about her
rings, romanticize about her
marriage with the princely
director of the program,
Giuseppe Marmmarella, discuss
her life as an American abroad,
and argue whether she is
beautiful or ugly. She is
definitely striking.
A Touch of Italy
"She behaves like an Italian
but thinks like an American,"
says Mary Lawrence, who

studied a class on contemporary
Italian women with her. "She
may eat nothing for lunch and
dine at 10 p.m. but when she
discusses politics or the women's
movement you know she is an
American," Lawrence says.
And despite the fact she has
lived in Italy for the last six
years, Marmmarella sees herself
as an American, "an American
living in Italy, but an
American."
"Being a foreigner in another
culture is a privileged position.
You can choose the best of both
cultures, but because I belong to
both worlds, I don't totally
belong to either. I'm split into
two parts, not necessarily equal.
Many of the experiences that are
important to me as well as the
little things about growing up
can't be shared with anyone,"
says Marmmarella.
Being in two worlds is not new
to her. She grew up in a pretty
little New Jersey town where
they still have gas street lamps.
While attending a rigid, highly
academic girls' school, she
studied with Balanchine's School
of American Ballet in New
York City. Strict academics
didn't mix with the arts then
and the high school principal
was upset that Marmmarella's
seemingly respectable mother
would allow her and her sister to
associate with "that element."
On Stage
Marmmarella danced
professionally from the age of
16 to 18. Her younger sister

Teena McConnell now solos with
the New York City Ballet.
Together, they have given ballet
lecture-demonstrations in Italy
and America.
After the rigid structure of
her high school, Marmmarella
sought out the experimental but
highly intellectual college
environment of Sarah Lawrence.
She graduated with a B.A. in
Italian in 1963. The summer
after her freshman year she went
with a friend to the school's six
week program in Florence. She
returned to the program four
years later as assistant to the
director and spent the summers
from 1964 to 1968 in that
position.
At 20, as a master's student
in Italian literature at Columbia,
Marmmarella began teaching
Italian. A professor called her
because he had heard about a
teaching position at Adelphi
College on Long Island.
"I had never intended to teach
and didn't know what to do. I
put on a very conservative basic
black dress and went out to the
first class." After she made it
through that class "in a small
seminar room spilling over with
hostile faces," she was on her
way.
Her speech is so rapid that
one student suggests that her
thinness might be explained by
the speed of her speech. She
stutters a little as she switches
back to English.
"I'm a little more relaxed
speaking Italian," says

Marmmarella as she stretches her
long legs in little ballet
movements by the pool at the
Holiday Inn. "Italian is a more
visual language than English.
"I react differently in Italian.
When my parents visit me in
Italy, it's puzzling for them to
see their daughter speaking
incomprehensibly. I conduct my
personal life in Italian and
always speak Italian with my
husband," she says.
Marmmarella prefers to
describe her husband as a man of
"detached elegance" rather than
an aristocrat. "I'm not the
typical American," she says.
"And he's not the typical
Italian."
In the summer of 1968 a
mutual friend invited them both
to her house, warning Joan
McConnell not to wear a short
skirt because Marmmarella
didn't like "flamboyant
women." Joan was annoyed
with the hostess; she had plenty
of Italian boyfriends and was
violently anti-marriage, but she
wore her longest mini-skirt.
In her best New York bus
driver voice Marmmarella recalls,
"I didn't particularly want to
meet another fat ugly greasy
little wop."
When it turned out that
Marmmarella was neither fat not
ugly nor little, Joan McConnell
decided to flirt with him. "By
the second date I knew he was
going to ask me to marry him
and I knew I was going to
accept." Six weeks later he

proposed.
As she prepares to swim, Joan
McConnell Marminarella says
that her husband didn't really
dislike flamboyance, "he. was
just afraid of it." She takes off
her bracelets one by one, tosses
her straw hat at a bold pigeon,
removes her sunglasses. "I'm not
afraid of being distinct," she
says."From the dancing days on
my mother encouraged me to be
an individual."
She disappears into the water.
Her lips are still red and her
eyelids turquoise when she
surfaces.
