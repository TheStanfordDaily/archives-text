### Midge Fels 
Who has been your most prolific "Bug Me"
correspondent? —T.L.R.
Our most faithful writer is definitely a
mysterious D.E., who lives in San Francisco (or
mails his letters from there, anyway). So far his
probing questions, which arrive several times a
week, have included:
—On the back of my wristwatch is a number:
206098. Under that it says "Nl." Does this mean
anything or should 1 just keep on wearing it?
—Mary is 24 years old. She is twice as old as
Ann was when Mary was as old as Ann is now.
How old is Ann?
—Is there no balm in Ciilead? Is there no
physician there? Is anything being done about
this? Or are we mired too deep in apathy to card,
and
—Why is gaining a point or points in an athletic
contest called "scoring," as though it were a
sexual act?
It's readers like this who make it all

worthwhile.

How did that mental midget Mike Dornheim get
to be editor of the ">Chaparral?" — G.G.
We can't pretend to understand the murky
inner workings of the Chaparral hierarchy, but as
a rule their staffers are Daily wash-outs.
Dornheim used to be a photographer. Frankly, we
don't think you should be so hard on Mike. It's
not his fault that the doctors fouled up and
circumcised his head.

1 just can '/ stand it. I hate my summer job, all my
friends have graduated, /Vn in the throes of
senior panic," and Stanford summers arc
supposed to be hotter than hell. On top of all this,
I won't be able to wake up to my favorite column
"Bug Me " two days a week. What's left in life?
Everything. Contrary to vicious rumor, "Bug
Me" will indeed appear in the summer Daily, and
the first issue is fewer than three weeks away. So
hang on.
