# Stamina Comes From The Heart

Lyle Nelson jogs around the
YMCA gym floor, pausing frequently
to press his fingers against an artery
in his neck, stopping to measure his
pulse against a large clock in a corner
of the room.
A cardiac nurse in shorts and
tennis shoes chats and runs beside
him, past other heart disease patients
who have slowed to a walk, past the
portable defibrillater and a box of
emergency drugs.
Nelson, chairman of the
Communication Department,
had heart surgery two years ago.
Now he runs or cycles in the Palo
Alto Cardiac Therapy Program
operated through the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and the YMCA. Three
days each week, 7 to 8 a.m., he
exercises to develop the strength and
efficiency of his heart muscle.
In three months, "I showed
tremendous improvement," says
57-year-old Nelson. He can now
exercise without worrying that
over-exertion will cause a heart
attack. His pulse rate tells him when
it is time to slow down and give his
heart a rest.
Physical Screening
Before entering the program,
Nelson was carefully screened to
make sure he could handle rigorous
exercise.
As part of a pre-program physical,
he rode a stationary bicycle with
electrocardiogram wires taped to five
places on his chest. As resistance to
pedaling was increased, his heart and
blood pressure were monitored to see
how well he handled the strain.
Nelson takes stress
electrocardiogram tests regularly to
chart his progress for the program's

medical records. After each test he is
given a new pulse rate that is his
"target" while exercising.
Frank Shallenberger, a professor
in the Graduate School of Business,
says that reaching the target pulse
rate is hard work. "It would take
great willpower to exercise like that
on your own for a full hour," he
says.
Shailenberger entered the program
after collapsing from a heart attack
five years ago. He remembers being
late for a meeting in San Francisco,
rushing from the train to catch a bus,
and then. ..
Weeks later he regained
consciousness in a hospital and was
told that a nurse had found him on
the street and saved his life.
Now he must live with the fear of
another heart attack. Although he
sometimes jogs around the house in
the morning, he never pushes himself
"too far" when alone.
'Demoralizing' Experience
A heart attack can be completely
"demoralizing" for busy, successful
men, says Kathy Berra, the cardiac
therapy program's supervising nurse.
Patients worry about their job
security, their marriages and their
ability to do anything active again,
says Berra. "Their worlds fall apart."
She says that improving a
patient's confidence is one of the
most important benefits of cardiac
therapy.
There are financial benefits too.
The $500 annual fee for cardiac
therapy can save patients roughly
$18,000 for surgery, or $40,000 for
hospital bills from a severe heart
attack.
Heart patients also learn
preventive medicine from Palo

Alto's program. They learn to
monitor their own heartbeats and
levels of endurance. They do
calisthenics with physical educator
Steve Totten, and adjust their own
medication for any mild chest pains
that result.
There are over 120 patients in
four exercise groups and they have
the assurance that emergency care is
available in case 'anything goes
wrong. Only one person has suffered
a heart attack on the gym floor since
the program began five years ago.
And he was cared for immediately by
an experienced intensive care nurse
using the program's emergency

equipment.
Being Prepared
The patients themselves knew
how to deal with the emergency
heart attack.
Three times a year they and their
families see The Pulse of Life, a
film on artificial resuscitation and
cardiac massage. Then they practice
the techniques on a dummy. Gauges
of its heart and rib cage show how
effectively heart massage can pump
blood for someone whose heart has
stopped beating.
The cardiac program will include
classes in relaxation, smoking and
diet next fall.

LIFELINE — Exercise is more than just a hobby for these men — they're
working out at the YMCA to t?y to avoid fatal heart attacks.
