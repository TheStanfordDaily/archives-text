# ASSU Travel Advisor
## Helping The Trippers 
### CHRISTY WISE 
When was the last time you sat in
class daydreaming about travelling to
Paris, Nepal or Tahiti?
But you woke up to harsh reality:
the arrangements were too
complicated and too expensive, or you
had three midterms the following
week.
Although nothing can be done
about the midterms short of dropping
out or graduating, there are ways
students are making travel planning
easier.
ASSU Student Travel Advisor
Marcie Axelrad furnishes students with
information about transportation,
accommodations and employment
both within the United States and
abroad.
Her office is located on the second
floor of Bechtel International Center.
Axelrad initiated the ASSU-financed
position a year ago. A library of
publications about work, study and
travel abroad is adjacent to her
office.
Exploring Options
"People are in there all the time —
mostly students," Axelrad said. And
most of them are looking for basic
information. Of the 10 to 20 people
she sees in a day, most give the name
of the place they want to visit and
then ask simply "How?"
"I tell them all the different
options," said Axelrad. "I don't
usually give my own advice. 1 let them
make their own decisions."
Axelrad also operates a referral
service. Every person who comes into
the office is asked to fill out an
information card about places he
has travelled or jobs he has had
People who plan similar undertakings
are then referred to an experienced
person who can offer advice.
Jay Farr, ASSU Travel Service
Manager for next year, drove a
Rover from London to East Africa

two summers ago. Mis biggest problem
was getting information beforehand.
"If you're interested in doing what
we did, the referral service is
invaluable," commented Farr. "I've
had a couple of freshmen come to me
who want to do a similar thing across
Africa into India."
Stop Out, Get Away
Axelrad observed that
travel-minded students "seem to be
stopping out a lot. They are taking
time off school and after school,
taking longer periods of time just to
get away. '
"Although students are still
interested in Europe, there is
increasing interest in Asia and Africa,"
she added. "People want to go to more
places where they won't run into
Americans — places different from the
United States."
Axelrad encourages people "to
settle down for a while and get to
know a place rather than wander
around.
"If a person wants to work overseas
to earn money to travel, they won't
have much money," she said. "If they
want to work for the experience of
being in a foreign country, they should
look into volunteer work," added
Axelrad.
Axelrad has travelled through
Europe and Israel. She is the campus
representative for Student Services
West which allows her to book student
fares on charter flights and ocean
voyages. She also has access to many
publications not available in
bookstores.
According to an informal survey
taken by next year's ASSU Financial
Manager Chris Cline, student response
to the travel advising has been
"overwhelmingly favorable."
"The recommendation was that the
position |of travel advisor] is in fact
valuable and was widely utilized this
year," said Cline.

Axelrad.
Axelrad has travelled through
Europe and Israel. She is the campus
representative for Student Services
West which allows her to book student
fares on charter flights and ocean
voyages. She also has access to many
publications not available in
bookstores.
According to an informal survey
taken by next year's ASSU Financial
Manager Chris Cline, student response
to the travel advising has been
"overwhelmingly favorable."
"The recommendation was that the
position |of travel advisor] is in fact
valuable and was widely utilized this
year," said Cline.
When was the last time you sat in
class daydreaming about travelling to
Paris, Nepal or Tahiti?
But you woke up to harsh reality:
the arrangements were too
complicated and too expensive, or you
had three midterms the following
week.
Although nothing can be done
about the midterms short of dropping
out or graduating, there are ways
students are making travel planning
easier.
ASSU Student Travel Advisor
Marcie Axelrad furnishes students with
information about transportation,
accommodations and employment
both within the United States and
abroad.
Her office is located on the second
floor of Bechtel International Center.
Axelrad initiated the ASSU-financed
position a year ago. A library of
publications about work, study and
travel abroad is adjacent to her
office.
Exploring Options
"People are in there all the time —
mostly students," Axelrad said. And
most of them are looking for basic
information. Of the 10 to 20 people
she sees in a day, most give the name
of the place they want to visit and
then ask simply "How?"
"I tell them all the different
options," said Axelrad. "I don't
usually give my own advice. 1 let them
make their own decisions."
Axelrad also operates a referral
service. Every person who comes into
the office is asked to fill out an
information card about places he
has travelled or jobs he has had
People who plan similar undertakings
are then referred to an experienced
person who can offer advice.
Jay Farr, ASSU Travel Service
Manager for next year, drove a
Rover from London to East Africa

two summers ago. Mis biggest problem
was getting information beforehand.
"If you're interested in doing what
we did, the referral service is
invaluable," commented Farr. "I've
had a couple of freshmen come to me
who want to do a similar thing across
Africa into India."
Stop Out, Get Away
Axelrad observed that
travel-minded students "seem to be
stopping out a lot. They are taking
time off school and after school,
taking longer periods of time just to
get away. '
"Although students are still
interested in Europe, there is
increasing interest in Asia and Africa,"
she added. "People want to go to more
places where they won't run into
Americans — places different from the
United States."
Axelrad encourages people "to
settle down for a while and get to
know a place rather than wander
around.
"If a person wants to work overseas
to earn money to travel, they won't
have much money," she said. "If they
want to work for the experience of
being in a foreign country, they should
look into volunteer work," added
Axelrad.
