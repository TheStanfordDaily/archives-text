## Cardinals Set For NCAA Golf 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
In May 1971, Stanford Golf
Coach Bud Finger was
drooling over a list of golf
recruits that included National
Junior champion ' Aly
Trompas, Northern California
Junior champion Bruce
Robertson and several
other potential stars.
"I was sure we'd have a
crack at the nationals by the
time those kids graduated,"
Finger said.
Four years later, only the
"other potential stars" remain
on the Stanford golf scene.
Robertson lost his amateur
status during his sophomore
year and Trompas was
suspended from the team this
season for disciplinary reasons.
But Finger has not totally
given up hope on the national
championship this year. He
admits that it's probably "a
100-to-l shot," but maintains
that "we can still win it if we
get hot — all we need is the
confidence."
Missed Last Three Cuts
Realistically, the Cards
should finish between 10th
and 20th in the NCAA
tournament, which will be
held June 25-28 at Ohio
State's Scarlet Course.
Stanford has missed the cut at
the last three NCAAs, and this
year the Cards have only
distinguished themselves once
— at their own U.S. Collegiate
Invitational.
For the remainder of the
season, Stanford was a
consistent also-ran, always
threatening but usually
finishing second or third as
San Jose State or
Brigham Young walked off
with the team trophy.
Still, Finger thinks several
factors will be working in
Stanford's favor at the
NCAAs. "We've always played
well on difficult courses, and
Ohio State is a long, tough
course," Finger said. "A team
that hits the ball well has a
better chance in a major
tournament than a team that
just scrapes it around and
scores well on easy courses."
Stanford's NCAA lineup of
seniors Dave Baskins, Conrad
Nilmeier and George Pettinger,
sophomore Jay Johnston and
freshman Mike Peck has been
preparing vigorously for the
tournament. Finger has
required each player to spend
at least an hour every day

chipping and putting at the
practice green.
Short-Game Tuneup
"We need tuning up on our
short game," said Finger, who
has never insisted on specific
amounts of practice time in
the past. "It's gotta save you a
shot a round, and that could
be the difference."
The Cardinal lineup is solid
if not spectacular. Baskins and
Nilmeier, both of whom plan
to turn pro in the near future,
will be climaxing outstanding
collegiate careers. Both are
legitimate contenders for the
individual title.
Pettinger finished third in
last year's Pac-Bs, and
Johnston came within one
shot of capturing the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational this
season.
Peck, who will be
Stanford's contestant in the
long-driving competition prior
to the tournament, may be the
finest Stanford golf prospect
since Tom Watson, now a
$100,000-plus performer each
year on the PGA tour. If he
avoids his occasional tendency
to accumulate costly penalty
strokes, "Mike could tear Ohio

State's course apart," Finger
said.
The top four scores count
toward the team total, and
Finger is confident that
between Bask ins, Nilmeier,
Peck and Johnston, the Cards
will come up with at least
three good scores. The only
question mark is Pettinger,
who has had a disappointing
season while struggling with 23
units winter quarter and 18
this spring.
"Pettinger is the key,"
Finger said. "If he gets his
confidence back and plays well,
we have a chance to win."
Defending champion Wake
Forest, Florida, Brigham
Young, Oklahoma State,
Houston and USC are among
the favorites for the team title,
while defending champion
Curtis Strange of Wake Forest
and U.S. Amateur champion
Jerry Pate of Alabama are
expected to set the individual
pace.
Stanford players enter the
tournament with the following
competitive averages: Baskins,
74.5; Nilmeier, 75.0; Peck,
75.4; Pettinger, 76.5; and
Johnston, 76.8.

ANOTHER WATSON?—Freshman Mike Peck is "as good or a
little better" than touring pro and former Stanford star Tom
Watson was at a similar stage, according to Card Coach Bud
Finger. Peck is one of five Stanford golfers who will compete
in the NCAA Championships June 25-28 at Ohio State.

ANOTHER WATSON?—Freshman Mike Peck is "as good or a
little better" than touring pro and former Stanford star Tom
Watson was at a similar stage, according to Card Coach Bud
Finger. Peck is one of five Stanford golfers who will compete
in the NCAA Championships June 25-28 at Ohio State.
In May 1971, Stanford Golf
Coach Bud Finger was
drooling over a list of golf
recruits that included National
Junior champion ' Aly
Trompas, Northern California
Junior champion Bruce
Robertson and several
other potential stars.
"I was sure we'd have a
crack at the nationals by the
time those kids graduated,"
Finger said.
Four years later, only the
"other potential stars" remain
on the Stanford golf scene.
Robertson lost his amateur
status during his sophomore
year and Trompas was
suspended from the team this
season for disciplinary reasons.
But Finger has not totally
given up hope on the national
championship this year. He
admits that it's probably "a
100-to-l shot," but maintains
that "we can still win it if we
get hot — all we need is the
confidence."
Missed Last Three Cuts
Realistically, the Cards
should finish between 10th
and 20th in the NCAA
tournament, which will be
held June 25-28 at Ohio
State's Scarlet Course.
Stanford has missed the cut at
the last three NCAAs, and this
year the Cards have only
distinguished themselves once
— at their own U.S. Collegiate
Invitational.
For the remainder of the
season, Stanford was a
consistent also-ran, always
threatening but usually
finishing second or third as
San Jose State or
Brigham Young walked off
with the team trophy.
Still, Finger thinks several
factors will be working in
Stanford's favor at the
NCAAs. "We've always played
well on difficult courses, and
Ohio State is a long, tough
course," Finger said. "A team
that hits the ball well has a
better chance in a major
tournament than a team that
just scrapes it around and
scores well on easy courses."
Stanford's NCAA lineup of
seniors Dave Baskins, Conrad
Nilmeier and George Pettinger,
sophomore Jay Johnston and
freshman Mike Peck has been
preparing vigorously for the
tournament. Finger has
required each player to spend
at least an hour every day

chipping and putting at the
practice green.
Short-Game Tuneup
"We need tuning up on our
short game," said Finger, who
has never insisted on specific
amounts of practice time in
the past. "It's gotta save you a
shot a round, and that could
be the difference."
The Cardinal lineup is solid
if not spectacular. Baskins and
Nilmeier, both of whom plan
to turn pro in the near future,
will be climaxing outstanding
collegiate careers. Both are
legitimate contenders for the
individual title.
Pettinger finished third in
last year's Pac-Bs, and
Johnston came within one
shot of capturing the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational this
season.
Peck, who will be
Stanford's contestant in the
long-driving competition prior
to the tournament, may be the
finest Stanford golf prospect
since Tom Watson, now a
$100,000-plus performer each
year on the PGA tour. If he
avoids his occasional tendency
to accumulate costly penalty
strokes, "Mike could tear Ohio

State's course apart," Finger
said.
The top four scores count
toward the team total, and
Finger is confident that
between Bask ins, Nilmeier,
Peck and Johnston, the Cards
will come up with at least
three good scores. The only
question mark is Pettinger,
who has had a disappointing
season while struggling with 23
units winter quarter and 18
this spring.
"Pettinger is the key,"
Finger said. "If he gets his
confidence back and plays well,
we have a chance to win."
Defending champion Wake
Forest, Florida, Brigham
Young, Oklahoma State,
Houston and USC are among
the favorites for the team title,
while defending champion
Curtis Strange of Wake Forest
and U.S. Amateur champion
Jerry Pate of Alabama are
expected to set the individual
pace.
Stanford players enter the
tournament with the following
competitive averages: Baskins,
74.5; Nilmeier, 75.0; Peck,
75.4; Pettinger, 76.5; and
Johnston, 76.8.
