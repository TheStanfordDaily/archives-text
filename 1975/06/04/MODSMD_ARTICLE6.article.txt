# Fight Mars Afternoon At Frost
## 
### CHRIS VALADA 
What was proposed as a pleasant
gathering with live music for Row
House residents at Frost Amphitheater
Sunday afternoon ended with a brawl
touched off by two non-Stanford
gate-crashers.
The late afternoon arrival of three
couples on three motorcycles
prompted an exchange of obscenities
and then blows between a biker's
girlfriend and a non-Stanford woman.
According to new ASSU Special
Events Director Randy Phillips, the
event had been rather hastily planned
by members of Jordan House who
went to the ASSU to seek funding.
"Because Helen Reddy had been
cancelled I decided to go along with
the plan. I thought it would be nice
for the Stanford students despite the
poor planning," Phillips said. But
"there was no real security — there
had not been enough money for
proper security," he explained.
Too Much To Drink
When police were called by Phillips
to break up the fray "there were
people all over the place," said
Director of Police Services Marvin
Herrington.
"There was a fight — but we don't
know what really started it. I think by
that time [after 6 p.m. — the event

had started about noon] things had
dragged on a little too long and there
had probably been too much to
drink," Herrington said, adding that
when the bikers drove into the
amphitheater some people got a little
upset.
"There were reports that there had
been more than just the two women
involved, but we don't know,"he said.
"The woman who was reputedly
assaulted did not give her report then
but came to the station 30 to 40
minutes later with her boyfriend. She
was marked up and angry, but did not
ask for medical attention."
If either party wishes to press
charges, it will be necessary for them
to go to the district attorney,

Herrington added, since the events did
not happen in the presence of the
three deputy sheriffs who answered
Phillips's call for assistance.
Director of Public Events Tom
Bacchetti, who had given the approval
for the use of Frost, said, "It blew my
mind that there were so many people
there." He said he had expected a
much smaller crowd than the 2000 to
4000 people who showed up. "1 had
expected about 500 people from
Stanford, but the outsiders presented a
whole new set of problems."
Phillips said the presence of a
proper security force would have
averted the conflict.
