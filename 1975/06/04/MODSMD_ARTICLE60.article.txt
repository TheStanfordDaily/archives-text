# Cardinal Knowledge
## Cards Could Ace Bruins 
### Ron Beck 
Stanford has as good a chance as any
other school to win next week's NCAA
Tennis Championship at Corpus Christi,
Tex.
Oh no, you're probably saying, there
goes Beck with another one of those stupid
tennis team predictions.
But it's true. The tournament format
may give the Cards a few lucky breaks,
exactly what they'll need to overtake Billy
Martin and the UCLA squad.
Each school will send four singles players
and two doubles pairs to Corpus Christi.
Each individual win in the single elimination
tournament will add a point to the school's
score, as in the Ojai tourney.
Coach Dick Gould has decided to send
defending champ John Whitlinger, two-time
doubles champ Jim Delaney, Ail-American
Nick Saviano and freshman standout Bill
Maze as the singles entrants.
Whitlinger-Delaney . and Saviano-Mark
Mitchell will be the doubles pairs for the
Cards.
The only difference between this year's
Stanford delegation and last year's is the
inclusion of Maze instead of last year's
runner-up to Whitlinger, Chico Hagey.
Gould, as usual, understates his squad's
chances. "We're definitely among the top of
the field." Considering the team's 19-1 dual

match record, its National Team Indoor
Championship and the fact that the Cards
are the two-time defending NCAA champs,
Gould should have reason to believe that
the team is "among the top of the field."
The obvious obstacle to Stanford's
chances is UCLA. The Bruins' top four
players, super-frosh Martin, last year's
top-seeded player Brian Teacher, Ferdi
Taygan and Tom Kreiss are at least as good
as the Stanford quartet.
But in a tournament that lasts as long as
the NCAAs (six days), strange things always
happen. Favorites get knocked off by
unknowns. Teachers get bounced by guys
named Terry Moor and Delaneys lose to
luminaries like Scott Carnahan.
It's bad to depend on luck to win, but
Stanford will need some. After the Pac-8
finals last month, Bruin Coach Glenn
Bassett assessed his team's chances for the
NCAAs. "We're even better as a four-man
team than a six-man team. Our prospects
are awfully good."
Martin will probably be top-seeded,
giving him a relatively easy draw until the
final rounds, but Gould isn't worried.
"Individually, Martin is heavily favored, but
he's not unbeatable," he said. "We have two
players who are capable of winning the
entire tournament in Whitlinger and

Delaney."
YVhitlinger, Delaney and Saviano should
all be seeded, but none of them will be in
the top four. Whitlinger's regular season
record was only 11-7. Delaney, a three-time
Ail-American, has lost only twice this year,
but played in the number four spot for
most of the season.
Saviano made it to the round of 16 in
last year's NCAA tourney, but has been
slowed down this season by injuries. "Nick
isn't quite 100 percent yet, but if he's
healthy, he'll be a definite threat," said
Gould.
Maze will be needed to bring in some
team points, and Gould thinks he can do it.
Gould said that Maze "can beat anyone in
the tournament." Last season, Maze beat
Martin in the finals of the junior nationals.
In doubles, the Cards have proven
point-getters. Whitlinger-Delanev should be
good for a number of points, if not the
championship itself, and Saviano-Mitchell
should be able to improve upon their
two-point showing last year.
With all the talent the Cards have, the
team has a real chance. But there's little
doubt that something strange is going to
have to happen to UCLA for Stanford to be
able to win its third straight NCAA title.

inclusion of Maze instead of last year's
runner-up to Whitlinger, Chico Hagey.
Gould, as usual, understates his squad's
chances. "We're definitely among the top of
the field." Considering the team's 19-1 dual

match record, its National Team Indoor
Championship and the fact that the Cards
are the two-time defending NCAA champs,
Gould should have reason to believe that
the team is "among the top of the field."
The obvious obstacle to Stanford's
chances is UCLA. The Bruins' top four
players, super-frosh Martin, last year's
top-seeded player Brian Teacher, Ferdi
Taygan and Tom Kreiss are at least as good
as the Stanford quartet.
But in a tournament that lasts as long as
the NCAAs (six days), strange things always
happen. Favorites get knocked off by
unknowns. Teachers get bounced by guys
named Terry Moor and Delaneys lose to
luminaries like Scott Carnahan.
It's bad to depend on luck to win, but
Stanford will need some. After the Pac-8
finals last month, Bruin Coach Glenn
Bassett assessed his team's chances for the
NCAAs. "We're even better as a four-man
team than a six-man team. Our prospects
are awfully good."
Martin will probably be top-seeded,
giving him a relatively easy draw until the
final rounds, but Gould isn't worried.
"Individually, Martin is heavily favored, but
he's not unbeatable," he said. "We have two
players who are capable of winning the
entire tournament in Whitlinger and

Delaney."
YVhitlinger, Delaney and Saviano should
all be seeded, but none of them will be in
the top four. Whitlinger's regular season
record was only 11-7. Delaney, a three-time
Ail-American, has lost only twice this year,
but played in the number four spot for
most of the season.
Saviano made it to the round of 16 in
last year's NCAA tourney, but has been
slowed down this season by injuries. "Nick
isn't quite 100 percent yet, but if he's
healthy, he'll be a definite threat," said
Gould.
Maze will be needed to bring in some
team points, and Gould thinks he can do it.
Gould said that Maze "can beat anyone in
the tournament." Last season, Maze beat
Martin in the finals of the junior nationals.
In doubles, the Cards have proven
point-getters. Whitlinger-Delanev should be
good for a number of points, if not the
championship itself, and Saviano-Mitchell
should be able to improve upon their
two-point showing last year.
With all the talent the Cards have, the
team has a real chance. But there's little
doubt that something strange is going to
have to happen to UCLA for Stanford to be
able to win its third straight NCAA title.

Stanford has as good a chance as any
other school to win next week's NCAA
Tennis Championship at Corpus Christi,
Tex.
Oh no, you're probably saying, there
goes Beck with another one of those stupid
tennis team predictions.
But it's true. The tournament format
may give the Cards a few lucky breaks,
exactly what they'll need to overtake Billy
Martin and the UCLA squad.
Each school will send four singles players
and two doubles pairs to Corpus Christi.
Each individual win in the single elimination
tournament will add a point to the school's
score, as in the Ojai tourney.
Coach Dick Gould has decided to send
defending champ John Whitlinger, two-time
doubles champ Jim Delaney, Ail-American
Nick Saviano and freshman standout Bill
Maze as the singles entrants.
Whitlinger-Delaney . and Saviano-Mark
Mitchell will be the doubles pairs for the
Cards.

Stanford delegation and last year's is the
inclusion of Maze instead of last year's
