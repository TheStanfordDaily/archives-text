# Junior Net Star Leaving Retirement
## 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
It might come as a surprise to
the casual Stanford tennis fan
that one member of the
women's team here actually
defeated Chris Evert in the 1969
junior nationals to claim the
number one spot in the 16 age
division. The player is Liza
Pande, and her record as a junior
was, well â€” amazing.
Pande, a sophomore, began
playing tennis at age 11, hacking
around with her friends and
taking lessons at the Foothills
Tennis and Swim Club.
At 14, she started training
seriously, practicing from four to
five hours daily. Then her
success story began.
Pande claimed the Northern
California championships in the
14-, 16-and 18-year-old brackets,
and once even won the Nor Cal
women's title. She defeated
Evert to win the 1969 nationals
at Lake Forest, 111. In 1970, and
again in 1971, she claimed the
number two berth nationally in
the 18-year-old division.
More Titles
In addition to these titles,
Pande also won the 1970
National Women's Hard Court
championship, defeating Chris
Kemrner in the finals. That same
year she won the National

Women's Amateur Grass Court
championship. In 1971, Pande
won the Women's Pennsylvania
Grass Court championships,
turning down $1000 in prize
money in order to retain her
amateur status.
A natural question might be:
what stopped Pande from
running away with as many titles
and dollars as Evert has?
"It's depressing sometimes,"
said Pande. "If I'd kept playing I
might be winning like Chris . . .
we were neck and neck in the
juniors."
Changed Ambitions
When Pande entered
Stanford, it looked as if she was
going to go ahead with her game.
She planned to turn pro, drop
out of school and join the
Virginia Slims. However, her
first Slims tournament in Dallas
changed all that.
"I realized how boring that
lifestyle would have been," said
Pande. "I'd be with the same
women every- week. Peoplewise,
I wouldn't get to meet anybody.
"Also, at that point, I was
getting tired of tennis,' she
added. "Up until then, I had not
experienced other things, only
tennis ... I wanted to do other
things. I needed to get away
from tennis and re-evaluate

everything. I didn't know
whether I was playing for myself,
my parents or my coach. So, I
gave it up."
School Interruption
Pande dropped out of school
for a year and worked in the
Palo Alto area.
"It was hard to adjust after
quitting tennis. 1 felt lost but I
really didn't want to play," she
said.
Last winter and spring, she
studied at Stanford-in-Britain
and gradually began playing
tennis again.
"I played for fun," Pande
said. "I enjoyed it." Back at
Stanford now, Pande has joined
the women's team. "I'm keeping
it low-key to see how much I
like it again, to see if I really like
it. I'm having a good time. I'm
relaxed and avoiding a big

training program."
Trial Period
For Pande, her participation
on the team is a trial period
during which she hopes to
decide whether or not she will
take up the game seriously again,
playing the pro circuit.
"I've got a lot of work to do if 1
take it up seriously again,"
Pande said.
"It's pretty slow coming
back. I've lost a lot of my
timing. I think it's my
experience that is helping me
beat a lot of the girls on the
team right now."
Pande still has time to come
back. She believes women can
play competitively until they
reach 35.
"If I'm going to make my
move though, I'll have to do it
pretty soon."
