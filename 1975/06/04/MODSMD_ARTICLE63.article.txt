# IM Roundup
## Biz Batters Blitz 
### Pete Bhatia 
After sitting on their calculators for six
innings, Biz I A exploded in the late innings last
week to claim the 1975 Intramural softball crown
with a 6-0 semi-romp over a doughty band from
Education. It was a professional job by the
Bizzers, whom Education's excellent pitcher Dave
"The Rave" Mantooth, conceded were "the best
team in IM's."
The game was scoreless through five, and then
Biz pitcher John Hinton drove in a single run for
a 1-0 margin. As Curt Gowdy would say, that
turned out to be all the runs they needed, as
Hinton cruised through the Education order in
the sixth and seventh while his mates salted away
the victory with a five-run explosion in the upper
half of the sixth stanza. Biz batted around in that
inning, as the Education defense, which had been
practically flawless through the playoffs, just
didn't get the breaks they needed.
As for the B division of softball, unseeded and
pleasantly high Alpha Delta Phi took the title
with a win over the top-seeded Psychos.

In other finals last week, Theta Delta Chi
claimed its third consecutive volleyball crown
Friday with a 15-8, 15-13 victory over the third
seeded Porf I team. The top-seeded Theta Delts
more-or-less had an easy time of it, as the Porfs 1
top player, Tom Duralde, had an off day hitting,
while Theta Delts Willie Mannon and David
Bagshaw both had pretty good days. The
all-senior Theta Delt team also included George
McPheeters, Scott Trobbe, Jay Tuthill, Mike
"Pi-Man" Simons and Brian Farrell. Mannon,
Simons, Trobbe and Farrell played on all three
Theta Delt champ teams. In B volleyball, Biz I
claimed the crown, winning in two straight, 15-8,
15-10 over Theta Chi.

And next, the final 1974-75 intramural point
standings were released today and for the fourth
consecutive year, Theta Delta Chi is the
All-University Champion. It is the first time in
Stanford's history that one living group or team
has won the championship four years in a row.
The Theta Delts' final total was 12V 2 points —
something of a comfortable margin over runnerup
Biz 11, which tallied 663 1/6. JRA was third at
630.
The Axe Thieves had to come from 70 points
down going into the spring to earn the title, but
they were able to catch winter leader Biz II by
virtue of extremely balanced and successful spring
participation. Aside from their volleyball and
water polo title teams, they tied for second in the
track meet, took fifth in swimming, reached the
semis in horseshoes and B volleyball, and reached
the quarters in A soft ball, A tennis and in
badminton.

One final note, from a personal viewpoint —
this is my final IM Roundup after two years. I
designed this column to take a light look at the
most important athletic program at Stanford
the one for the student body as a whole. It has
been designed to give that program the publicity
it deserved.
Many times people have taken offense at my
bad jokes, light hearted references and ugly
cliches. But they have all been there for a reason
— to attract your attention to a really important
part of Stanford life. Next year. IMs will have
second priority on this page behind the major
sport of the season. With that in mind. I can only
feel this weekly assemblage of names and dorms
and frats has done some good.

— to attract your attention to a really important
part of Stanford life. Next year. IMs will have
second priority on this page behind the major
sport of the season. With that in mind. I can only
feel this weekly assemblage of names and dorms
and frats has done some good.

After sitting on their calculators for six
innings, Biz I A exploded in the late innings last
week to claim the 1975 Intramural softball crown
with a 6-0 semi-romp over a doughty band from
Education. It was a professional job by the
Bizzers, whom Education's excellent pitcher Dave
"The Rave" Mantooth, conceded were "the best
team in IM's."
The game was scoreless through five, and then
Biz pitcher John Hinton drove in a single run for
a 1-0 margin. As Curt Gowdy would say, that
turned out to be all the runs they needed, as
Hinton cruised through the Education order in
the sixth and seventh while his mates salted away
the victory with a five-run explosion in the upper
half of the sixth stanza. Biz batted around in that
inning, as the Education defense, which had been
practically flawless through the playoffs, just
didn't get the breaks they needed.
As for the B division of softball, unseeded and
pleasantly high Alpha Delta Phi took the title
with a win over the top-seeded Psychos.

In other finals last week, Theta Delta Chi
claimed its third consecutive volleyball crown
Friday with a 15-8, 15-13 victory over the third
seeded Porf I team. The top-seeded Theta Delts
more-or-less had an easy time of it, as the Porfs 1
top player, Tom Duralde, had an off day hitting,
while Theta Delts Willie Mannon and David
Bagshaw both had pretty good days. The
all-senior Theta Delt team also included George
McPheeters, Scott Trobbe, Jay Tuthill, Mike
"Pi-Man" Simons and Brian Farrell. Mannon,
Simons, Trobbe and Farrell played on all three
Theta Delt champ teams. In B volleyball, Biz I
claimed the crown, winning in two straight, 15-8,
15-10 over Theta Chi.

And next, the final 1974-75 intramural point
standings were released today and for the fourth
consecutive year, Theta Delta Chi is the
All-University Champion. It is the first time in
Stanford's history that one living group or team
has won the championship four years in a row.
The Theta Delts' final total was 12V 2 points —
something of a comfortable margin over runnerup
Biz 11, which tallied 663 1/6. JRA was third at
630.
The Axe Thieves had to come from 70 points
down going into the spring to earn the title, but
they were able to catch winter leader Biz II by
virtue of extremely balanced and successful spring
participation. Aside from their volleyball and
water polo title teams, they tied for second in the
track meet, took fifth in swimming, reached the
semis in horseshoes and B volleyball, and reached
the quarters in A soft ball, A tennis and in
badminton.

One final note, from a personal viewpoint —
this is my final IM Roundup after two years. I
designed this column to take a light look at the
most important athletic program at Stanford
the one for the student body as a whole. It has
been designed to give that program the publicity
it deserved.
Many times people have taken offense at my
bad jokes, light hearted references and ugly
cliches. But they have all been there for a reason
— to attract your attention to a really important
part of Stanford life. Next year. IMs will have
second priority on this page behind the major
sport of the season. With that in mind. I can only
