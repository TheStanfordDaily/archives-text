## I Told You So: Bonds Stinks 
### Glenn Garvin 
Isn't it a pity? They're booing
Bobby Bonds in New York.
"I haven't come to bat at
Shea one time yet without
hearing boos," Bonds whined
last week. "One guy even made a
remark about me while I was
playing right field."
Bonds greeted this outrageous
behavior with a typically cool,
mature rejoinder: he turned an
upraised middle finger to the
fan.
That more or less sums up the
sad tale of Bobby Bonds: an
overrated ballplayer who has
never performed up to
expectations — and reacts to
criticism with hostile outbursts
of childish behavior.
What Do You Expect?
Bonds can't understand why
the fans at Shea Stadium are
upset with him. After all, how
much can you humanly expect
from a man who gets paid
$115,000 a year to play
baseball? Yankee fans seem to
feel that for that much money
Bonds should be able to hit over
.232 — a lofty plateau he
reached only this weekend with
an 11-for-20 batting streak.
They also think he ought to
strike out less with men on base.
While Bonds leads the team in
RBI with 33, he also leads in
KNBI (that's runs nut batted in).
In a pair of games the Yankees
lost to Oakland by a total of
three runs, Bonds personally

stranded nine runners.
Bonds left so many men on
base with his strikeouts that
Yankee Manager Bill Virdon
moved him from third to first in
the lineup to avoid having him
break up rallies. That's an odd
solution — moving him from
third to ninth would seem more
appropriate. Or maybe from
third to the bench.
Righty Power
The one thing Bonds has
managed to do for the Yankees
is add some right-handed power
to the lineup: he leads the
American League in home runs
with 11. But just how much is it
worth to carry a man who hits
.220 with 30 home runs, which
is what Bonds will probably
finish the season with?
Much of Bonds' trouble with
the fans stems from the fact that
they remember who used to play
right field. You might remember
him, too: a guy named Bobby
Murcer, who currently performs
before the deserted stands in San
Francisco.
Murcer, despite a mild slump
of late, is batting .295. He's got
31 RBI, just two short of Bonds,
and seven homers — which is not
bad at all. Those are more like
the figures you expect from a
$100,000 ballplayer, and Murcer
doesn't get booed when he
comes to bat.
Of course, he doesn't get
cheered either. Playing for the

Giants is about as lively as
working in the city morgue, even
when they're winning. It's too
bad that a talented man like
Murcer is being wasted in the
Bay Area, instead of playing for
a team that has some fans — like,
say, the Yankees.
Murcer is unfortunately not
the kind of guy who attracts a
lot of press attention. Even
though he's been one of the
most exciting players in baseball
this season — crashing into
fences, stealing homers from the
opposition, knocking the ball all
over the place — you won't find
his name in the Chronicle or
Examiner much.
In fact, they mention him less
often then they mention Bonds,
who's having a crummy year in a
city clear across the continent.
Bonds is the kind of guy who
does get in the papers, even
when he's stinking up the

countryside with his play.
The Fans Know
But while you might be able
to fool the newspapers, the fans
don't get suckered so easily. And
that's why Bonds is hearing boos
in Shea Stadium these days. Of
course, Bonds didn't sucker all
the newspapermen; loyal and
dedicated Pro Prognosis fans
might remember what it said
here last October 30, just after
the Bonds-Murcer trade:
"Not since the Boston Red
Sox sold Babe Ruth to the
Yankees has there been such a
stupid trade .. . The Yankees
got screwed. And when New
Yorkers find out just how badly,
their howls of last week will
sound like the chirping of
crickets compared to the ruckus
they'll raise." Well, they found
out.
It's always nice to be able to
say I told you so.
