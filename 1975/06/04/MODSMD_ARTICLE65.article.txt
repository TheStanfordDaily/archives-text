# Three Spikers In NCAA's
## Cards Need Luck! 
### 
Stanford is sending three
spikers to the NCAA Track and
Field Championships. The
competition starts tomorrow
and runs through Saturday in
Provo, Utah.
The Cardinal delegation
includes junior distance man
Tony Sandoval, frosh long
jumper James Lofton and junior
hurdler John Foster. Matt
Hogsett, another junior hurdler,
qualified for the event but will
be held out due to a sinus
infection.
Hogsett, the 1973 Pac-8
champion, crashed into a hurdle
at this year's league meet and
didn't reach the finals. He has
been plagued with injuries for
the whole last half of the season.
Before Hogsett withdrew, Coach
Payton Jordan predicted that
"he could be right in there" at

the NCAAs.
The Card with the best
chance of placing in the meet
should be Sandoval, running in
the 6-mile. "Sandoval seems to
be at his peak right now," Jordan
said. "The altitude could also be
a factor in his favor. He comes
from altitude (Los Alamos,
N.M.), so Provo should be right
up his alley."
Sandoval placed seventh in
last year's NCAA meet, and
palced second in last month's
Pac-8 championships. A week
after the Pac-B's, Sandoval ran a
4:04.4 mile at the California
relays.
Lofton and Foster barely
qualified for the meet, and are
not considered among the top
contenders. Foster will be
running in the 120 high hurdles,
and Lofton will be participating
in the long jump.
Team favorites for the meet
are Pac-8 champion USC,
national dual-meet champ UCLA
and UTEP.
