# Stanford A Hit With Prep Baseball Recruits; 24 Sign

### PAUL BAUMAN 
Stanford baseball Coach Ray
Young's team compiled a 9-9
record in Pac-8 play this season,
but it looks like his 1975
recruiting record will be no
worse than 21-3.
Twenty-four high school
senior players — 13 pitchers, five
catchers, five infielders and one
outfielder — have returned
letters of intent to play here.
Stanford did not successfully
recruit any pitchers last year.
Young expects to lose at
most three recruits to the pros
after today's draft.
Signing a letter of intent does
not require a player to come to
Stanford, and allows him to turn
pro if he desires. The letter
merely indicates that if he
attends any school, it will be
Stanford.
"For the first time in 10 or
11 years," Young said, "people
were available in quantity and
quality. We felt we had to help
ourselves out in both pitching
and catching in order to come
up with a ball club next year.
Our feeling is that if our pitching
can keep us in games, then well
find a way to win."
Pitchers Frank Pastore, a
righthander from Ontario, and
Robert Irwin, a southpaw from
Lancaster, lead the list of
recruits.
Young calls Pastore a definite
first-round pick in the pro draft
and "one of the top two or three
(pro) prospects in Southern

California."
Young said that Pastore set a
California Interscholastic
Federation record this season by
striking out 16 men in a
seven-inning game. Irwin tied the
record a week later, according to
Young.
Naturally, Pastore and Irwin,
along with infielder Larry
Reynolds from Corvallis, Ore.,
are the most likely of Stanford's
recruits to spurn The Farm and
sign professional contracts.
Even if they do, the Cards
have the- numbers to
compensate. Other top Card
pitching recruits are Bruce Fiala
(Sherman Oaks), Gerry
Komolofske (Portland, Ore.),
and Bill Lemon (Richmond).
"Lemon may be a real
sleeper," Young said. "He was
the most valuable player in his
league and was coming on very

strong. '
All other recruits:
Mark Abbondola (pitcher,
Rancho Cordova), Jerry
Batten berg (pitcher,
Sacramento). Mike Codiroli
(pitcher San Jose), Fat Conlin
(pitcher, Canoga Park), Richard
Hallsted (pitcher, Dana Point),
Brian Harrison (pitcher, Covina),
Ken Stott (pitcher, Mountain
View), Dave Fullerton (pitcher,
Fresno), Gordy Ceresino
(catcher, Sherman Oaks), Brad
Pennington (catcher, Fremont),
John Pyle (catcher, Eugene,
Ore.), Bruce Walters (catcher,
Monterey), Dave Sercu (catcher,
Napa), Bill Anderson (inf., El
Cerrito), Shawn Kirshner (inf.,
Santa Monica), Scott Lawrence
(inf., Fresno), Steve Kosic (inf.,
San Diego), Kurt Osenbaugh
(of., Arcadia).

righthander from Ontario, and
Robert Irwin, a southpaw from
Lancaster, lead the list of
recruits.
Young calls Pastore a definite
first-round pick in the pro draft
and "one of the top two or three
(pro) prospects in Southern

California."
Young said that Pastore set a
California Interscholastic
Federation record this season by
striking out 16 men in a
seven-inning game. Irwin tied the
record a week later, according to
Young.
Naturally, Pastore and Irwin,
along with infielder Larry
Reynolds from Corvallis, Ore.,
are the most likely of Stanford's
recruits to spurn The Farm and
sign professional contracts.
Even if they do, the Cards
have the- numbers to
compensate. Other top Card
pitching recruits are Bruce Fiala
(Sherman Oaks), Gerry
Komolofske (Portland, Ore.),
and Bill Lemon (Richmond).
"Lemon may be a real
sleeper," Young said. "He was
the most valuable player in his
league and was coming on very

strong. '
All other recruits:
Mark Abbondola (pitcher,
Rancho Cordova), Jerry
Batten berg (pitcher,
Sacramento). Mike Codiroli
(pitcher San Jose), Fat Conlin
(pitcher, Canoga Park), Richard
Hallsted (pitcher, Dana Point),
Brian Harrison (pitcher, Covina),
Ken Stott (pitcher, Mountain
View), Dave Fullerton (pitcher,
Fresno), Gordy Ceresino
(catcher, Sherman Oaks), Brad
Pennington (catcher, Fremont),
John Pyle (catcher, Eugene,
Ore.), Bruce Walters (catcher,
Monterey), Dave Sercu (catcher,
Napa), Bill Anderson (inf., El
Cerrito), Shawn Kirshner (inf.,
Santa Monica), Scott Lawrence
(inf., Fresno), Steve Kosic (inf.,
San Diego), Kurt Osenbaugh
(of., Arcadia).
Stanford baseball Coach Ray
Young's team compiled a 9-9
record in Pac-8 play this season,
but it looks like his 1975
recruiting record will be no
worse than 21-3.
Twenty-four high school
senior players — 13 pitchers, five
catchers, five infielders and one
outfielder — have returned
letters of intent to play here.
Stanford did not successfully
recruit any pitchers last year.
Young expects to lose at
most three recruits to the pros
after today's draft.
Signing a letter of intent does
not require a player to come to
Stanford, and allows him to turn
pro if he desires. The letter
merely indicates that if he
attends any school, it will be
Stanford.
"For the first time in 10 or
11 years," Young said, "people
were available in quantity and
quality. We felt we had to help
ourselves out in both pitching
and catching in order to come
up with a ball club next year.
Our feeling is that if our pitching
can keep us in games, then well
find a way to win."
Pitchers Frank Pastore, a
righthander from Ontario, and
Robert Irwin, a southpaw from
Lancaster, lead the list of
recruits.
