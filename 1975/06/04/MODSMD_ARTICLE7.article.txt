# Students' Proposal For County
## 'From Garbage To Energy' 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Yesterday's paper plates and orange peels could be
tomorrow's energy supply for large Santa Clara County
industries if a team of engineers here has its way.
In a report to be submitted to county officials in
early autumn, the students and faculty of Engineering
235 will recommend the construction of a $40 million
plant to convert a sizable portion of the county's
garbage to a natural gas substitute called "syngas."
The conversion takes place through a chemical
decomposition of the garbage triggered by heating —
the process is called "pyrolysis."
The syngas product could guarantee a source of
energy to the burgeoning array of industries crowded
into a small area in northern San Jose.
Reduce Landfill
These industries are now Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) "interruptible" customers whose present
supply of natural gas can be cut off during periods
when demand for energy exceeds the supply, notes
Pete Winokur, a senior in mechanical engineering and a
member of the team.
In 1982, the proposed first year of the plant's
operation, the pyrolysis process could also reduce the
amount of garbage going to landfill by 35 percent,
estimates Dave Evans, another mechanical engineering
senior.
Members of the team emphasize the need for such a
reduction, noting that in a decade there will be no
more room for landfill in Santa Clara County if the
present rate of garbage generation continues.
The engineers' report also calls for the reduction of
garbage going to landfill through use of a large magnet
to separate ferrous metals such as steel cans from the

refuse The separated metal could then be sold at a
profit to local manufacturers.
Management Plan
Santa Clara County officials will read the report
with interest. By next January, they are required under
the requirements of State Senate Bill 5 to draw up a
solid waste management plan which reduces the need
for precious landfill space and provides for recovery of
valuable resources such as energy.
The proposed plant would be located near the San •
Jose intersection of Highways 101 and 17. At that site,
the scores of trucks hauling garbage to the plant would
not have to rumble down small streets in residential
neighborhoods.
"The land is slated to be used for an industrial
development," notes John Mason, a graduate student
in civil engineering. Moreover, the possibility that the
proposed Rincon de los Esteros industrial park will be
built adjacent to this site would mean an increased
number of nearby industrial customers who could
utilize the plant's syngas product without expensive
pipeline costs
The output gas from the pyrolysis process is flexible
enough to produce other forms of energy — methanol,
which could be used as a fuel for cars; methane, which
could be injected into PG&E's transmission lines; and
electricity.
$3.5 Million Profit
Though the plant would cost about $9 million
annually to operate, revenues from the sale of the
syngas and ferrous metals recovered and from a "drop
charge" (which garbage collectors must pay to deposit
the refuse at the plant) are estimated to provide $12.5
million annual revenue, including a $3.5 million profit.
The private operator of the plant would receive a
pre-arranged profit, with any remaining money going
to the public in the form of lower garbage collection
rates.
Tnough the engineers recommend that the
garbage-to-energy plant be privately operated, they
suggest that it be publicly owned. The plant would be
financed through sale by the county of either general
obligation bonds or revenue bonds, notes Bill Lauesen,
a senior in industrial engineering.
The success of the team's ambitious proposal thus
depends heavily on the public. A majority of the
county's voters must approve the sale of revenue
bonds, while two-thirds must approve a sale of general
obligation bonds.

Not everyone believes the public will buy such a
plan. "Good as the idea may be, the voters' temper
today won't produce a two-thirds majority for garbage
power," stated a Palo Alto Times editorial last
Saturday.
But Evans, who took part in the five-month study,
notes that "the proposed system would be competitive
on a cost basis" with present disposal systems because
landfill disposal rates in this county will likely rise
drastically.
As county landfill space is exhausted, citizens will
have to absorb the extra cost of hauling the garbage
longer distances to landfills outside the county, Evans
says.
He also notes that increasingly stringent state
restrictions will make landfilling more costly.

utilize the plant's syngas product without expensive
pipeline costs
The output gas from the pyrolysis process is flexible
enough to produce other forms of energy — methanol,
which could be used as a fuel for cars; methane, which
could be injected into PG&E's transmission lines; and
electricity.
$3.5 Million Profit
Though the plant would cost about $9 million
annually to operate, revenues from the sale of the
syngas and ferrous metals recovered and from a "drop
charge" (which garbage collectors must pay to deposit
the refuse at the plant) are estimated to provide $12.5
million annual revenue, including a $3.5 million profit.
The private operator of the plant would receive a
pre-arranged profit, with any remaining money going
to the public in the form of lower garbage collection
rates.
Tnough the engineers recommend that the
garbage-to-energy plant be privately operated, they
suggest that it be publicly owned. The plant would be
financed through sale by the county of either general
obligation bonds or revenue bonds, notes Bill Lauesen,
a senior in industrial engineering.
The success of the team's ambitious proposal thus
depends heavily on the public. A majority of the
county's voters must approve the sale of revenue
bonds, while two-thirds must approve a sale of general
obligation bonds.

Not everyone believes the public will buy such a
plan. "Good as the idea may be, the voters' temper
today won't produce a two-thirds majority for garbage
power," stated a Palo Alto Times editorial last
Saturday.
But Evans, who took part in the five-month study,
notes that "the proposed system would be competitive
on a cost basis" with present disposal systems because
landfill disposal rates in this county will likely rise
drastically.
As county landfill space is exhausted, citizens will
have to absorb the extra cost of hauling the garbage
longer distances to landfills outside the county, Evans
says.
He also notes that increasingly stringent state
restrictions will make landfilling more costly.
Yesterday's paper plates and orange peels could be
tomorrow's energy supply for large Santa Clara County
industries if a team of engineers here has its way.
In a report to be submitted to county officials in
early autumn, the students and faculty of Engineering
235 will recommend the construction of a $40 million
plant to convert a sizable portion of the county's
garbage to a natural gas substitute called "syngas."
The conversion takes place through a chemical
decomposition of the garbage triggered by heating —
the process is called "pyrolysis."
The syngas product could guarantee a source of
energy to the burgeoning array of industries crowded
into a small area in northern San Jose.
Reduce Landfill
These industries are now Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) "interruptible" customers whose present
supply of natural gas can be cut off during periods
when demand for energy exceeds the supply, notes
Pete Winokur, a senior in mechanical engineering and a
member of the team.
In 1982, the proposed first year of the plant's
operation, the pyrolysis process could also reduce the
amount of garbage going to landfill by 35 percent,
estimates Dave Evans, another mechanical engineering
senior.
Members of the team emphasize the need for such a
reduction, noting that in a decade there will be no
more room for landfill in Santa Clara County if the
present rate of garbage generation continues.
The engineers' report also calls for the reduction of
garbage going to landfill through use of a large magnet
to separate ferrous metals such as steel cans from the

refuse The separated metal could then be sold at a
profit to local manufacturers.
Management Plan
Santa Clara County officials will read the report
with interest. By next January, they are required under
the requirements of State Senate Bill 5 to draw up a
solid waste management plan which reduces the need
for precious landfill space and provides for recovery of
valuable resources such as energy.
The proposed plant would be located near the San •
Jose intersection of Highways 101 and 17. At that site,
the scores of trucks hauling garbage to the plant would
not have to rumble down small streets in residential
neighborhoods.
"The land is slated to be used for an industrial
development," notes John Mason, a graduate student
in civil engineering. Moreover, the possibility that the
proposed Rincon de los Esteros industrial park will be
built adjacent to this site would mean an increased
number of nearby industrial customers who could
utilize the plant's syngas product without expensive
pipeline costs
