# Stanford Daily Opinions
## viewpoint A 						Final Thought 
### 
In September 1971 as the jet lifted off from Philadelphia
International Airport, a surprising feeling of exhiliration came over
me when I realized that I was going to a place where I knew
absolutely no one and was beginning something completely new.
Normally, such flirting with the unknown sends shock waves of
apprehension through my system, but somehow I knew that this
particular adventure would turn out right. It has.
Looking out of the window of my dorm room - a place that I
happily call "home" - I can't restrict myself in this final column
to commenting only on the four months since I've been editor of
the Daily. Rather, all the different parts of my Stanford experience
seem inseparable and I feel they must be considered as a unit. What
is the Stanford experience? Obviously different for everyone, it is
summed up for me by the broadest meaning of the word
"communication."
Somewhat surprisingly, I have found that classes have not been
a major part of my Stanford experience. Classes, of course, are
designed to further the communication of knowledge and
information, but they became much less important than I would
have expected four years ago. While certain classes and professors
stick out in my mind as having given me invaluable information or
having made me think in some new and creative way, the
communication I have received from most classes has only been of
passing interest. The real Stanford experience, at least for me, took
place through situations and events which had very little to do with
classroom learning.
The Stanford Daily is certainly involved with communication in
its most literal sense. For all its faults, the Daily remains an
important channel of communication on this campus, providing
information and conveying ideas to all who care to read it. In some
cases, the ideas that have run have not been well thought out or the
information has been erroneous, but the Daily has never
consciously wavered from the basic goal of dissemination and
stimulation of provocative thoughts. I only regret that more
readers did not personally share their thoughts and ideas about the
Daily itself with me over the past few months.
But even the Daily only plays a peripheral part in the overall
picture of communication on this campus. There are so many
diverse elements in this Univeristy's idea network that it is
impossible to discuss more than a few. My mind again drifts back
to my first year here - to the Bruce Franklin firing, to the mining
of Haiphong Harbor in Vietnam — and the demonstrations that
were peppered throughout that year in protest of these and other
events. That was communication of a different kind, and it swayed
my notions and sympathies in a lot of ways. Some of the ideas
thrown out at that time, while not as attractive to me now as they
once were, opened my eyes and enabled me to see many more sides
to events and issues than I had thought possible.
Finally, the most cherished sources of communication and ideas
have been the brilliant, thoughtful people I have met here. I'm not
talking about intellectual brilliance, but rather the brilliance of
personal communication — of feeling, of caring, of warmth. I can't
deny that my friends and the people in my living groups — from
my great freshman dorm on up — hold an immense sentimental
value for me and that they will stand out more than anything else
when I look back on this place. The Stanford experience has,
indeed, been one of pleasure for me — pleasure which would not
have been possible without the chance to share in the feelings of
those I've known best. If the human aspect of the University can
be kept in perspective, the new thoughts, the new ideas, the new
emotions will flow by themselves.
While I am not looking forward to moving on as much as I was
during that jet ride in 1971, I am not too regretful about leaving.
The four-year span seems just the right amount of time to provide
me with the impetus to take what I've learned here and apply it to
more directional goals. If what I encounter during the rest of my
life is as eye-opening as the Stanford experience has been, I will be
ecstatic. That initial feeling of exhiliration I had back in 1971 -
while disappearing periodically - is still with me even though the
adventure is almost over. It was a good trip.

apprehension through my system, but somehow I knew that this
particular adventure would turn out right. It has.
Looking out of the window of my dorm room - a place that I
happily call "home" - I can't restrict myself in this final column
to commenting only on the four months since I've been editor of
the Daily. Rather, all the different parts of my Stanford experience
seem inseparable and I feel they must be considered as a unit. What
is the Stanford experience? Obviously different for everyone, it is
summed up for me by the broadest meaning of the word
"communication."
Somewhat surprisingly, I have found that classes have not been
a major part of my Stanford experience. Classes, of course, are
designed to further the communication of knowledge and
information, but they became much less important than I would
have expected four years ago. While certain classes and professors
stick out in my mind as having given me invaluable information or
having made me think in some new and creative way, the
communication I have received from most classes has only been of
passing interest. The real Stanford experience, at least for me, took
place through situations and events which had very little to do with
classroom learning.
The Stanford Daily is certainly involved with communication in
its most literal sense. For all its faults, the Daily remains an
important channel of communication on this campus, providing
information and conveying ideas to all who care to read it. In some
cases, the ideas that have run have not been well thought out or the
information has been erroneous, but the Daily has never
consciously wavered from the basic goal of dissemination and
stimulation of provocative thoughts. I only regret that more
readers did not personally share their thoughts and ideas about the
Daily itself with me over the past few months.
But even the Daily only plays a peripheral part in the overall
picture of communication on this campus. There are so many
diverse elements in this Univeristy's idea network that it is
impossible to discuss more than a few. My mind again drifts back
to my first year here - to the Bruce Franklin firing, to the mining
of Haiphong Harbor in Vietnam — and the demonstrations that
were peppered throughout that year in protest of these and other
events. That was communication of a different kind, and it swayed
my notions and sympathies in a lot of ways. Some of the ideas
thrown out at that time, while not as attractive to me now as they
once were, opened my eyes and enabled me to see many more sides
to events and issues than I had thought possible.
Finally, the most cherished sources of communication and ideas
have been the brilliant, thoughtful people I have met here. I'm not
talking about intellectual brilliance, but rather the brilliance of
personal communication — of feeling, of caring, of warmth. I can't
deny that my friends and the people in my living groups — from
my great freshman dorm on up — hold an immense sentimental
value for me and that they will stand out more than anything else
when I look back on this place. The Stanford experience has,
indeed, been one of pleasure for me — pleasure which would not
have been possible without the chance to share in the feelings of
those I've known best. If the human aspect of the University can
be kept in perspective, the new thoughts, the new ideas, the new
emotions will flow by themselves.
While I am not looking forward to moving on as much as I was
during that jet ride in 1971, I am not too regretful about leaving.
The four-year span seems just the right amount of time to provide
me with the impetus to take what I've learned here and apply it to
more directional goals. If what I encounter during the rest of my
life is as eye-opening as the Stanford experience has been, I will be
ecstatic. That initial feeling of exhiliration I had back in 1971 -
while disappearing periodically - is still with me even though the
adventure is almost over. It was a good trip.

In September 1971 as the jet lifted off from Philadelphia
International Airport, a surprising feeling of exhiliration came over
me when I realized that I was going to a place where I knew
absolutely no one and was beginning something completely new.

apprehension through my system, but somehow I knew that this
