# The Class Of 1979: 'Abie, Diverse, Energetic'
## 
### KEA McLAUGHLIN 
The Class of 1979 of 915 men and
595 women was selected from an
applicant pool of 9730, according to
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon.
The class comes from some 900
secondary schools in 47 of the United
States and 17 foreign countries. 14.5
percent of those matriculating are sons
and daughters of alumni and 11
percent have brothers and/or sisters
who attended or are attending
Stanford.
"They arc about as able, diverse
and energetic a freshman class as can
be found in any college or university
in the country," Hargadon said.
"Despite their impressive credentials,

however, they will undoubtedly spend
a few weeks worrying about whether
they can hack it here.
"All of them will find some of the
work, some of the time, difficult. If
the faculty's doing its job, they
should. But if any students fail to hack
it, it won't be because of lack of
ability; rather it will be because of lack
of interest, will or motivation."
In a study of future career choices
by the Class of 1979, it appears that
the premed and prelaw "panic" of the
pragmatic '70s seems to be subsiding,
according to statistics recently released
by the University's Academic
Information Center (AIC).
The shift away from those two

professions, however, does not signal a
return to the humanities and social
science-oriented '60s. The statistics
show that while freshman interest in
law and medicine is on the wane, the
number of students going into science
and engineering is rising.
The most striking change has
occurred among women interested in
engineering, who now make up 7.6
percent of the freshman women. This
compares with 4.8 percent last year,
2.8 percent the previous year and 1.2
percent three years ago.
Robert Hamrdla, director of the
AIC, reports these findings based on a
survey of the preliminary academic
interests of this fall's incoming class:

--28 percent leaning toward the
social sciences, down a percent or two
from last year.
—27 percent favoring a natural
science, math and technology, up
about four percent.
—17 percent indicating a preference
for pre-med, down for the third
straight year.
—14 percent choosing the
humanities, down one percent.
—12 percent expressing a
preference for engineering, reflecting a
sharp gain among women and a slight
increase among men.
—2 percent with no preference,
down from a 4 to 5 percent level the
past two years.
Hamrdla notes that law school
applications dropped about 15 percent
nationally last year.
Nonetheless, Hargadon views the
trend toward practicality as a fairly
permanent one.
"We are seeing an increasing
number of students who see college as
a means to an end rather than an end

in itself — a means to a job rather than
a means of enriching their lives,"
observes Hargadon.
"Students are [more] interested in
getting their money's worth," he adds.
The desire to get more for one's
dollar has certainly not affected the
number of Stanford applications for
admission being filed. The number has
continually crept up for the last
decade. Last year, the number peaked
at about 12,000 (10,000 freshman
applications and 2,000 transfer).
The job of processing the
applications keeps a clerical staff of 12
busy the whole year.
"Choosing a college is a big step for
a young person," says Helen
Kmetovic, head of the admissions
office clerical staff. "I tend to be a
perfectionist and dislike seeing errors
made. A mistake in our office could be
a disaster to a prospective student."
Each application received goes into
a folder (a different colored one for
each year) where the information
waits to be computer coded. If not for
the computers, says Kmetovic, "a
monumental-sized clerical staff"

would be needed.
The application folder contains at
least seven pieces of paper —
supplementary forms, two teacher
references, school reports, test scores
and letters from interested people.
One of the first tasks of the clerical
staff is to evaluate high-school
transcripts according to established
Stanford guidelines.
"Stanford doesn't just take grade
point averages as high schools report
them to us," explains Kmetovic. "We
need to be sure that there is some
common basis upon which to compare
academic credentials.
"High schools have a habit of
renaming courses, particularly English
courses," adds Kmetovic. And grading
systems, of course, are even less
standardized. The contemporary
assortment of H's, E's, S's, P's, G's and
M's would nonplus even the most
patient admission reviewer.
Once an applicant's folder contains
all the required documents, it is sent
to one of the eight directors of
admission who reviews the application
and writes a summary resume.
Both Hargadon and John Bunnell,
associate dean and director of
freshman admissions, personally
review every application. Debra
Dopelm, director of transfer
admissions, reads the applications of
all potential transfers.
Although academic factors are by
far the most important consideration
in examining an application,
extra-curricular activities and
special talents are also weighed.
Hargadon estimates that about
1500 applicants each year have
maintained straight "A's" in high
school, and consequently many highly
qualified students have to be turned
down. Competition among transfers is
just as stiff, Hargadon says.

It is no secret that various
categories of desired students receive
preference at Stanford. Athletes,
musicians and others have traditionally
been admitted above more
academically qualified candidates.
Hargadon admits that applicants
with alumni parents are given
preference, but "only if all other
things are equal."
It is also University policy to admit
minority students on a preferential
basis. About 17 percent of this year's
entering class will be asian american,
black, chicano, or native american.
Hargadon, however, denies the use of
quotas.
Contrary to the belief of some
people, special preference is not given
to potential engineering students.
Stanford, says Hargadon, is the only
university in the nation that forces
engineering applicants to compete
academically with other candidates.
Once the decisions are made the
folders come back to Kmetovic's
office and her staff begins the massive
letter writing job.
The acceptance and rejection letters
take about three months to write, but
aren't dropped into the mail until
April 1.
The next major task for Kmetovic's
staff is to survey those acceptees who
decide to turn Stanford down.
This year, about 900 of the 2400
people accepted told Stanford they
had decided to attend some other
college.
The surveys have shown that a
significant number of liberal-arts
oriented students who reject Stanford
view the University as much stronger
in graduate, professional and science
education. Roughly 45 percent of this
year's class chose either
Harvard/Radcliffe, Yale, Princeton or
MIT.

THE CHOSEN FEW' — Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon stands amid the 12,000 files of applications who sought to
spend their carefree undergraduate days at Stanford. This year's freshman class numbers 1500 out of an applicant pool
of 10,000. The sophomore and junior classes have also been swelled by a 200-strong contingent of transfer students,
chosen from among 2000 applications.
