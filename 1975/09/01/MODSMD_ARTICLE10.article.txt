# CPPC Looks To Future
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Although the worries about entering the job
market are four years away, the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC) can help incoming
students in their "self-assessment" of possible
careers.
That self-assessment, according to CPPC
Director Ralph Keller, requires a careful designing
of a college education "to cause students to think
about what they will do in this world."
Over and above completing the 180 units
required for graduation, students need to
"diversify" to make themselves "whole persons"
in the society, says Keller.
In that way, the CPPC organizes seminars for
all interested students on such subjects as "Career
Options Evolving in the American Culture,"
"Experiential Education for the Undergraduate,"
and "Part-time and Summer Work — A Valuable
Part of Career Planning."
So the career planning aspect has overtaken
the placement element in the CPPC scheme. But
that doesn't mean that placement is ignored.
"Placement is only effective when the student
has made an intelligent decision" on a career, says
Keller. The CPPC, then, is more than just an
employment office for seniors and for those
seeking part-time work — it's a place to reflect,
ponder and think about what you'll do in four
years.
The calendar of career planning programs is
designed to give candidates in all fields the chance
to become more aware of what career options are

open to them and what various career paths are
really about.
All programs are posted in the center, printed
in the Stanford Daily and in the CPPC Newsletter,
which is published quarterly.
Career counseling is available on an individual
basis to discuss career direction and options,
job-hunting and interviewing techniques, specific
employment contacts and anything else related to
career planning and placement.
When the time does arrive when career plans
have been set and the main obstacle in sight is
landing a good job, the placement services aspect
of the center is readily at hand.
Interviews are held on campus by personnel
representatives of several hundred industrial,
government, business and institutional employers
each year. Information about their visits is
announced in each Monday's edition of the Daily.
For part-time jobs off campus, the CPPC is
also the place to go. These jobs can aid the
middle-class student who does not qualify for
financial aid, but still must help subsidize his or
her education.
In addition, files on temporary jobs on campus
which pay less than $50 per quarter are available
at the CPPC. Information on all other on-campus
jobs can be found at the financial aids office.
Information on jobs for those students
interested in "stopping-out," or taking time off
from the academic life, is provided by the CPPC.
Trained peer counselors work with potential
stop-outs in arranging a possible program of work
and/or travel and a return to Stanford.

also the place to go. These jobs can aid the
middle-class student who does not qualify for
financial aid, but still must help subsidize his or
her education.
In addition, files on temporary jobs on campus
which pay less than $50 per quarter are available
at the CPPC. Information on all other on-campus
jobs can be found at the financial aids office.
Information on jobs for those students
interested in "stopping-out," or taking time off
from the academic life, is provided by the CPPC.
Trained peer counselors work with potential
stop-outs in arranging a possible program of work
and/or travel and a return to Stanford.

FRESHMAN FEAST — But it can turn into freshman fat, if you're not careful. Most freshmen,
particularly women, fall into the trap of eating every delicacy the food service has to offer and
regretting it later.
Although the worries about entering the job
market are four years away, the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC) can help incoming
students in their "self-assessment" of possible
careers.
That self-assessment, according to CPPC
Director Ralph Keller, requires a careful designing
of a college education "to cause students to think
about what they will do in this world."
Over and above completing the 180 units
required for graduation, students need to
"diversify" to make themselves "whole persons"
in the society, says Keller.
In that way, the CPPC organizes seminars for
all interested students on such subjects as "Career
Options Evolving in the American Culture,"
"Experiential Education for the Undergraduate,"
and "Part-time and Summer Work — A Valuable
Part of Career Planning."
So the career planning aspect has overtaken
the placement element in the CPPC scheme. But
that doesn't mean that placement is ignored.
"Placement is only effective when the student
has made an intelligent decision" on a career, says
Keller. The CPPC, then, is more than just an
employment office for seniors and for those
seeking part-time work — it's a place to reflect,
ponder and think about what you'll do in four
years.
The calendar of career planning programs is
designed to give candidates in all fields the chance
to become more aware of what career options are

open to them and what various career paths are
really about.
All programs are posted in the center, printed
in the Stanford Daily and in the CPPC Newsletter,
which is published quarterly.
Career counseling is available on an individual
basis to discuss career direction and options,
job-hunting and interviewing techniques, specific
employment contacts and anything else related to
career planning and placement.
When the time does arrive when career plans
have been set and the main obstacle in sight is
landing a good job, the placement services aspect
of the center is readily at hand.
Interviews are held on campus by personnel
representatives of several hundred industrial,
government, business and institutional employers
each year. Information about their visits is
announced in each Monday's edition of the Daily.
For part-time jobs off campus, the CPPC is
also the place to go. These jobs can aid the
middle-class student who does not qualify for
financial aid, but still must help subsidize his or
her education.
In addition, files on temporary jobs on campus
which pay less than $50 per quarter are available
at the CPPC. Information on all other on-campus
