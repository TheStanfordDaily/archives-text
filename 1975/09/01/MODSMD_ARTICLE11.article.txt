# The 						Organization Of The Upper Echelon
## 
### 
The President
Of The
University

William Stone served as
assistant dean of students before
moving to the Inner Quad to
become assistant to the
president in 1971.
Stone's job is "to improve his
[President Lyman's] chances of
getting things done." Stone, for
example, might answer a query
from someone in the University
while Lyman is busy with
something else.
John Goheen is the
University ombudsman. He is
responsible more to the campus
community than to the
president as he attempts to cut
the bureaucratic red tape in
solving problems of individuals
on campus.
Goheen has been a professor
in the Philosophy Department
here since 1950. In 1971, he
received the Dinkelspiel Award
for outstanding service to
undergraduate education.
James Siena, legal adviser to
the president, has been involved
with such cases as the dismissal
of tenured Assoc. English Prof.
H. Bruce Franklin; the Buckley
Amendment, which purportedly
allows students to inspect their
files; and Title IX which makes
illegal any discrimination along
sexual lines.
Siena coordinates the other
lawyers who work in the
University such as the Medical
School and the office of business
and finance.

Vice President for
Development Kenneth
Cuthbertson is in charge of one
of the most important duties of
a university — fund-raising. It is
a fact of life that any private
university is dependent on gift
support.
Cuthbertson has guided the
University two-thirds of the way
through the $300 million
Campaign for Stanford.
Collection of the remainder of
those funds seems almost
assured. Cuthbertson was
student body president here in
1940.

President Lyman went to
Wall Street to pick his vice
president for business and
finance, Robert Augsburger.
Augsburger is in charge of the
"support functions" of the
Univeristy: plant services, police
services, the university press and
management of University land.
With a campus as large as
Stanford's (over 8000 acres) that
can be a very big job.
On Wt.ll Street, Augsburger
was executive vice president of
an investment banking firm
before taking on his position
here in 1971.

The
Vice President
And Provost

Vice President and Provost William Miller is responsible to the
president of the University for administration of the whole
academic program, including the various schools and libraries,
except the Hoover Institution.
He is the second-in-command; he is president of the University
in the absence of Lyman.
Academics is first and foremost the preoccupation of the
provost. All the academic deans report to him as well as the
director of the libraries, the directors of the Food Research
Institute, Overseas Studies, Physical Education and Athletics and
the Health Services.
Miller is a computer expert and professor at SLAC and in the
computer science department. Born in November 1925, Miller
earned a B.S. from Purdue.
He served as associate provost and as vice president for research
before filling his present post vacated by Lyman when the latter
became president.
Miller is now in the midst of a budget-cutting drive that
threatens a number of academic programs. Innovative education
may be on the way out. This past summer, the architecture
program was abolished by order from Miller.

Robert Rosenzweig has
occupied the newly-created
office of Vice President for
Public Affairs since early in the
1974-75 academic year. He is in
charge of governmental and
community relations, public
relations and the University
news service.
Rosenzweig received a Ph.D.
from Yale University in 1956 in
political science. Previous to his
most recent appointment, he
served as vice provost and
adviser to President Lyman.

The job of the University president is analagous to that of a
corporation executive. Stanford President Richard Lyman directs
an institution with assets totalling $760,801,000 in 1974.
Operating expenditures in the same fiscal year amounted to
$231,226,000.
But Lyman's worries go far beyond the financial sphere. He is
given powers by the Board of Trustees to control the educational
part of the University to the extent that he is held responsible for
the course of study and for the good conduct and capacity of the
professors and teachers.
Lyman is Stanford's seventh president. He entered the post in
1970 shortly after Kenneth Pitzer resigned in the wake of campus
revolt. Lyman seemed the first choice for the presidency among
students, faculty and alumni in terms of response by mail.
He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore in 1947 and
went to Harvard to earn an A.M. in 1948 and a Ph.D. in 1954 in
history. An expert in modern British history, Lyman came to
Stanford in 1958 as an associate history professor.
After serving as University provost, Lyman moved up to the
presidents office. Born on Oct. 18, 1923 in Philadelphia, Lyman
lives with his wife, Jing. They have three children.
A September 1970 Daily editorial said, "Lyman is
unquestionably the best man for Stanford of the nine or ten
national frontrunners that the search committees focused
on . . . He is intelligent, articulate, honest and capable."
Lyman has been quoted as saying that he will spend at most 10
yerrs in office. The half-way point is upon us — and upon him.

Secretary to the University
Fred Glover first became
associated with Stanford as an
undergraduate (until his
graduation in 1933) and then as
an administrator since 1946.
He is now the administrative
officer of the Board of Trustees,
coordinating their meeting times
and serving as liaison between
the Board and the University.
He also served as executive
assistant to former University
President J. E. Wallace Sterling.
Cecelia Preciado/Burciaga,
assistant to the president for
chicano affairs, works to
facilitate the increasing
participation of chicanos at
Stanford. She is involved with
faculty hiring and staff
personnel problems.
She arrived here in July 1974
from a staff position in the U.S.
Civil Rights Commission in
Washington.
She graduated from
California State University at
Fullerton in 1967.
Anne Miner is the University
affirmative action officer. A
Radcliffe graduate with
experience in business, research
and academic administration,
she reviews the status of women
at all levels of employment in
the University.
She studies current policies
and recommends changes needed
to eliminate sex discrimination
in employment.

Vice President for Medical
Affairs and Dean of the Medical
School Gayton Rich directs a
segment of the University which
spends close to $40 million each
year on instruction and research.
An expert in endocrinology,
specializing in diseases of the
bone, Rich was associate dean
for research and clinical affairs
at the University of Washington
medical school before coming to
Stanford in 1971.
He earned his M.D. from
Cornell in 1948.
