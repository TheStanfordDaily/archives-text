# ASSU Offers Slew Of Student Services
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Some people say that the ASSU (Associated Students of
Stanford University) has become too large. Those same people
insist that the ASSU has taken on too many responsibilities — that
it suffers from the too-many-irons-in-the-fire syndrome.
But then again, the people who run the ASSU are elected by the
student body each April, so in their campaign statements, they
promise students something in return for their vote.
So it goes with the ASSU. With tuition bills increasing
astronomically, there is a call for an immediate return on that
investment. The ASSU has responded to that call by instituting a
slew of student services.
Almost every student who lives in the East or the Midwest and
who goes to Stanford has used the ASSU Travel Service. The
service provides cut-rate air fares to cities like New York, Chicago
and Washington at vacation time.
Although the lines at the travel service (located in the ASSU
office on the second floor of Tresidder Union) are long, it is
usually worth the wait. An annual spring charter flies to sunny
Honolulu and the demand always exceeds the supply of seats
available.
Lecture Notes
The ASSU Lecture Notes Service was very successful in
1974-75, the first year of its existence. At a cost of $4-$l2 per
quarter, any student can subscribe to any of the classes listed.
Last year's courses included Economics I, Sleep and Dreams,
and many classes required of pre-meds. The mimeographed notes
are taken by someone approved by the instructor who received an
A in the class and who has taken a concentration of courses in that
particular area.
Legal Counseling
Since its inception in October 1973, the ASSU Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) has received over 1400 students seeking legal advice
on a wide variety of cases. In many cases, without the LCO,
students would have been forced to pay for an attorney merely to
get legal advice.
The LCO serves only students, and is entirely funded through
student-levied fee assessments. It is located in the Old Firehouse on
Santa Teresa Street.
ASSU Special Events is the campus promoter of rock music —
certainly a difficult task in a monopolistic market controlled by
the king of them all, Bill Graham. But Special Events has been able
to attract the likes of the Grateful Dead, Stephen Stills, Dave
Mason, Joan Baez and most recently, Eric Clapton.
The line-up for the coming year is not set as yet, but Special
Events Director Randy Phillips says he has been talking with agents
for Neil Young, Bach man-Turner Overdrive and others who will be
on tour.
Smaller Events
Leo Kottke and comedian Robert Klein are noar-definite
possibilities for a showcase of smaller, more intimate events as
opposed to the hard rock variety. Dinkelspiel and Memorial
Auditorium might then replace cumbersome Maples Pavilion as the
campus concert hall.
The ASSU office itself offers a variety of services that are
readily available.
The ride board is for those who seek and those who want to be
sought for jaunts across the country or even to Berkeley. There is
also a courtesy phone for any student's use to make calls within
the Bay Area. A Xerox machine for five cents a copy is in the
lobby.
Refrigerator Rental
The ASSU also offers a refrigerator rental service. The small
refrigerators cost $15 per quarter. A refundable $10 deposit
is also charged. The refrigerators are rented very fast, so if you
want one, you should go to the ASSU office within the first week
of classes.
The ASSU Course Guide, now under new direction after a
change made last spring, provides a quarterly critique of every
course offered for undergraduates with over 15 people. It replaces
the formerly annual Course Review.
The cost of the guide is as yet undetermined, but it will be
available at the Bookstore.
University campuses are considered intellectual centers of any
area, so prominent and frequently provocative speakers have
ventured to The Farm. Last year, the ASSU Speakers' Bureau
brought Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, writer Erica Jong
and San Francisco mayoral candidate Dianne Feinstein, among
others.
There were no speakers scheduled for the fall at press time.

Some people say that the ASSU (Associated Students of
Stanford University) has become too large. Those same people
insist that the ASSU has taken on too many responsibilities — that
it suffers from the too-many-irons-in-the-fire syndrome.
But then again, the people who run the ASSU are elected by the
student body each April, so in their campaign statements, they
promise students something in return for their vote.
So it goes with the ASSU. With tuition bills increasing
astronomically, there is a call for an immediate return on that
investment. The ASSU has responded to that call by instituting a
slew of student services.
Almost every student who lives in the East or the Midwest and
who goes to Stanford has used the ASSU Travel Service. The
service provides cut-rate air fares to cities like New York, Chicago
and Washington at vacation time.
Although the lines at the travel service (located in the ASSU
office on the second floor of Tresidder Union) are long, it is
usually worth the wait. An annual spring charter flies to sunny
Honolulu and the demand always exceeds the supply of seats
available.
Lecture Notes
The ASSU Lecture Notes Service was very successful in
1974-75, the first year of its existence. At a cost of $4-$l2 per
quarter, any student can subscribe to any of the classes listed.
Last year's courses included Economics I, Sleep and Dreams,
and many classes required of pre-meds. The mimeographed notes
are taken by someone approved by the instructor who received an
A in the class and who has taken a concentration of courses in that
particular area.
Legal Counseling
Since its inception in October 1973, the ASSU Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) has received over 1400 students seeking legal advice
on a wide variety of cases. In many cases, without the LCO,
students would have been forced to pay for an attorney merely to
get legal advice.
The LCO serves only students, and is entirely funded through
student-levied fee assessments. It is located in the Old Firehouse on
Santa Teresa Street.
ASSU Special Events is the campus promoter of rock music —
certainly a difficult task in a monopolistic market controlled by
the king of them all, Bill Graham. But Special Events has been able
to attract the likes of the Grateful Dead, Stephen Stills, Dave
Mason, Joan Baez and most recently, Eric Clapton.
The line-up for the coming year is not set as yet, but Special
Events Director Randy Phillips says he has been talking with agents
for Neil Young, Bach man-Turner Overdrive and others who will be
on tour.
Smaller Events
Leo Kottke and comedian Robert Klein are noar-definite
possibilities for a showcase of smaller, more intimate events as
opposed to the hard rock variety. Dinkelspiel and Memorial
Auditorium might then replace cumbersome Maples Pavilion as the
campus concert hall.
The ASSU office itself offers a variety of services that are
readily available.
The ride board is for those who seek and those who want to be
sought for jaunts across the country or even to Berkeley. There is
also a courtesy phone for any student's use to make calls within
the Bay Area. A Xerox machine for five cents a copy is in the
lobby.
Refrigerator Rental
The ASSU also offers a refrigerator rental service. The small
refrigerators cost $15 per quarter. A refundable $10 deposit
is also charged. The refrigerators are rented very fast, so if you
want one, you should go to the ASSU office within the first week
of classes.
The ASSU Course Guide, now under new direction after a
change made last spring, provides a quarterly critique of every
course offered for undergraduates with over 15 people. It replaces
the formerly annual Course Review.
The cost of the guide is as yet undetermined, but it will be
available at the Bookstore.
University campuses are considered intellectual centers of any
area, so prominent and frequently provocative speakers have
ventured to The Farm. Last year, the ASSU Speakers' Bureau
brought Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, writer Erica Jong
and San Francisco mayoral candidate Dianne Feinstein, among
others.
There were no speakers scheduled for the fall at press time.
