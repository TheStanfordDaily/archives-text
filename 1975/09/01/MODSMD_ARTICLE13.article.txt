# Rosenbaum Heads Council Of Presidents
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The ASSU (Associated
Students of Stanford
University) each year elects a
Council of Presidents. This
council directs all facets of
student-directed services
designed for students.
This year's Council of
Presidents (COP) was elected
last April by the student body.
It is composed of: Lee
Rosenbaum, ASSU president,
and three ASSU
vice presidents Josie
Jaramillo, Dave Galligan and
Charlotte Germane. They will
serve in their offices until April
1976.
The "Rosenbaum slate," as
it was termed during the last
election race, emphasized
student involvement and
improved ASSU/student
communication in the
campaign.
According to the
Rosenbaum slate's published
philosophy, the job of the COP
is "to act as a facilitator for
students who want to initiate
student services, help students
cut administrative red tape and
defend student rights."
This fall, the COP is
planning to put out a pamphlet
to include "what ASSU can
do" for students, says
Jaramillo. It will be a guide to
off-campus living while
providing information on
bikes, records, stereos,
groceries and cars.

In addition, the new COP
will sponsor a booklet on the
legal counseling office. It will
include information on
insurance and aid in filling out
legal forms.
Germane's main efforts will
be directed towards a peer
advising program. "Every
entering undergraduate student
should have one faculty or
administrative adviser and one
student adviser," she says.
Germane maintains that
peer advisers should also be
available to students on a
departmental level as is
currently done in human
biology and engineering.
Women's Center
A women's center is also
planned so that women's
organizations can be placed
under one roof. It will be
located at the Bridge, on
Campus Drive, across from
Theta Chi house.
But the ASSU Council of
Presidents does not concern
itself solely with student
services. The COP says it also
hopes to work with the
administration to provide
student input in academia.
The University is now in the
process of cutting $10 million
from its budget, and the COP
says it wants student
involvement in such
decision-making. With the
threat that undergraduate
education might suffer as a
result of the budget slashes,
Germane says the COP "will be

working with [ Provost
William J Miller in his plans to
reorganize ODUS [the Office
of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies]."
Bonfire
The COP stands opposed to
the Bonfire, once an annual
event that preceded the "Big
Game," the football tussle
against Cal.
Germane contends that the
Bonfire "is not ecologically

sound" and that it should be
replaced by another group
activity. "It's a passe idea," she
says. Last year, Germane, who
was then an ASSU senator, was
a leading opponent of the
Bonfire, which went ahead as
scheduled.
The COP, following the
example of the University of
California, says it wants to
push Stanford's Board of
Trustees to appoint a student

member. That proposal has
been met with a definitive
"no" by board members and
administrators in the past.
Lee Rosenbaum is a senior
from Toledo, Ohio; Josie
Jaramillo is a senior from El
Paso, Texas- Dave Galligan is a
senior fro: Tucson, Arizona;
and Charlotte Germane is a
junior from nearby Los Altos
Hills.
