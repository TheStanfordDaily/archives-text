# Dean Of Student Affairs Coordinates Services
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons gives an annual talk
to parents who have left their
son or daughter at Stanford for
their freshman year.
One year, Lyons told the
parents that entering college has
become a time when youths
obtain a symbolic "declaration
of independence" from their
parents. He urged the parents to
respect the decisions of their

sons and daughters and to be
tolerant of a lack of information
from them.
Lyons coordinates the entire
structure of services provided for
students by the University. He
also allocates the human, space
and dollar resources of the
student affairs units and acts as
an advocate of certain student
needs with councils of the
University.
In its budget-cutting program,

the University will withhold this
year thousands of dollars of
support that it has provided in
the past to student
organizations.
But the student affairs office
will continue to operate the
housing system and Tresidder
Memorial Union — two of the
main functions of the office.
Student housing is under the
direction of Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton.
He controls a centralized office
to aid students in choosing and
finding a place to live while at
Stanford, be it in University or
non-University housing.
Horton also directs the
network of faculty residents and
student resident associates.
Those people provide counseling
arfd "words of experience" to
dormitory residents.
The housing draw is
coordinated by Horton's office
and students go there to initiate
any dormitory changes.
Assoc. Dean for Campus
Affairs Dan Williams is the
coordinator of Tresidder Union.
Williams is directly responsible
to Lyons.
In his position, Williams
provides those services and
amenities for students apart
from residences or academia. So
crafts fairs and an annual spring
festival are sanctioned by
Tresidder Union for the benefit
of students.
Lyons, along with

coordinating the activities of
both Horton and Williams, deals
directly with student groups. In
1974, he met with black
students to discuss moving the
black theme house to a smaller
dormitory with a one-to-one
black to white ratio.
Such a change was approved
by the dean, and the black
theme house moved from Roble
Hall to Olivo-Magnolia House in
Lagunita Court.

According to a paper
outlining the common
assumptions of student affairs
here, "We [the student affairs
office] have a basic commitment
to the academic experience.
Students are whole persons. We
believe that there is value in
personalizing the educational
experience. A student grows and
develops 24 hours a day — not
just the three or four he might
be in the classroom."

of students.
Lyons, along with

coordinating the activities of
both Horton and Williams, deals
directly with student groups. In
1974, he met with black
students to discuss moving the
black theme house to a smaller
dormitory with a one-to-one
black to white ratio.
Such a change was approved
by the dean, and the black
theme house moved from Roble
Hall to Olivo-Magnolia House in
Lagunita Court.

According to a paper
outlining the common
assumptions of student affairs
here, "We [the student affairs
office] have a basic commitment
to the academic experience.
Students are whole persons. We
believe that there is value in
personalizing the educational
experience. A student grows and
develops 24 hours a day — not
just the three or four he might
be in the classroom."

Larry Horton
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons gives an annual talk
to parents who have left their
son or daughter at Stanford for
their freshman year.
One year, Lyons told the
parents that entering college has
become a time when youths
obtain a symbolic "declaration
of independence" from their
parents. He urged the parents to
respect the decisions of their

sons and daughters and to be
tolerant of a lack of information
from them.
Lyons coordinates the entire
structure of services provided for
students by the University. He
also allocates the human, space
and dollar resources of the
student affairs units and acts as
an advocate of certain student
needs with councils of the
University.
In its budget-cutting program,

the University will withhold this
year thousands of dollars of
support that it has provided in
the past to student
organizations.
But the student affairs office
will continue to operate the
housing system and Tresidder
Memorial Union — two of the
main functions of the office.
Student housing is under the
direction of Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton.
He controls a centralized office
to aid students in choosing and
finding a place to live while at
Stanford, be it in University or
non-University housing.
Horton also directs the
network of faculty residents and
student resident associates.
Those people provide counseling
arfd "words of experience" to
dormitory residents.
The housing draw is
coordinated by Horton's office
and students go there to initiate
any dormitory changes.
Assoc. Dean for Campus
Affairs Dan Williams is the
coordinator of Tresidder Union.
Williams is directly responsible
to Lyons.
In his position, Williams
provides those services and
amenities for students apart
from residences or academia. So
crafts fairs and an annual spring
festival are sanctioned by
Tresidder Union for the benefit
of students.
