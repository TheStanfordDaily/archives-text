# University In Need Of Student Fund Raisers
## 
### 
A private university like Stanford is in constant search for
money. And as the costs of education increase — with the addition
of lasers, language laboratories and computers — fund raising
becomes a preoccupation.
A large part of education costs is paid through tuition. However,
as any University administrator will hasten to tell you, tuition only
covers about 40 percent of the cost of sending you through
Stanford.
In other words, each student receives an outright grant of
around 60 percent of a Stanford education regardless of need.
But that 60 percent has to come from somewhere and
fund-raisers here say that students can help in the University's drive
to increase endowment and in doing so, maintain the quality of
education.
"I'd like students to be more involved in fund raising," says
Assoc. General Secretary Audrey Berkovitz, who is directly
involved in University fund raising. "Donors would like to know
about the current student body" and they enjoy hearing from
students. „ ,

Berkovitz says that the
Student Development
Committee and the Heritage
Fund are two ways in which
students can get into the
business of fund raising. The
Heritage Fund in particular is
money "solicited from
businesses for scholarship
funds," she says.
Students who initiate
projects, like ARLO (Action
Research Liaison Organization)
solicit funds from foundations
and interested individuals.
Berkovitz and others in the
University's General Secretary's
office are in the midst of a
"Campaign for Stanford" which
is two-thirds of the way toward
its goal of collecting $300
million.
"At Stanford, the quality of
education has changed over the
last 20 years. Stanford was a
good regional school 20 years
ago, now it is one of the best in
the world," says Berkovitz.
But with quality, she adds,
comes the expensive tools of
education that add markedly to
costs. The Campaign for
Stanford and other drives to
increase endowment are
designed to keep tuition bills
from rising even higher.
