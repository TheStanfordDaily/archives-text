# Advisors: The First Faculty Contact
## 
### SUSAN ROSSE 
"We attempt to provide each entering
student with a person from faculty-staff
who can be an educational advocate for the
student," Bob Hamrdla, head of the
Academic Information Center (AIC)
explains as the goal of the advising system
through which most students have their first
faculty contact.
"As an educational aid, academic
advising is aimed at undeclared students
[those with no major], and is met with
varying degrees of success depending on the
commitment and interest of the student and
adviser," Hamrdla says.
Although the advising system is
functioning better each year Hamrdla says
there are still problems.
Students entering as freshmen expect a
high level of knowledge and assistance from
their advisers in outlining and choosing
classes. This expectation is usually
unrealistic because many faculty members

are removed from the main stream of
student life and have limited knowledge of
classes.
Students entering their sophomore year
create another major problem. Many
sophomores tend to think they are familiar
enough with the campus to do without an
adviser, but have not yet declared a major
and received a departmental adviser creating
the "sophomore gap."
The Other Stanford, a SWOPSI report on
the relationship of professors and
undergraduates, is highly critical of both the
level and quality of advising. One of its
recommendations is that "undergraduates
should take more advantage of tutorials,
independent study, directed reading,
directed research and office hours" to get to
know their professors better.
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Mason Yearian and other University
administrators and professors agree that
these working situations can often develop

into more meaningful faculty student
relationships than those between adviser
and advisee, and that many times the latter
can stem from the former.
The advising system is officially under
the director of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies and includes the AIC and the
individual advisers in freshman residences
and undergraduate departments and
programs.
In an effort to provide more flexible and
varied counseling, the AIC and the ASSU
are working together to develop a
peer-counseling program. ASSU Vice
President Charlotte Germane is responsible
for organizing the new program.
As the program is now planned, eight
peer counselors interviewed and selected by
Germane, Yearian, Hamrdla and SCIRE
Director Alice Supton will hold office hours
every afternoon of the week in two
locations — Branner and Stern.
