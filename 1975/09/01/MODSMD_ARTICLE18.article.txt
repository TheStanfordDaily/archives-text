# Transfers' Dilemma
## It's Freshman Year All Over Again 
### KATHY BATTS 
After those first few euphoric
days, when you know you've
been accepted as a transfer
student, the panic sets in.
"Christ, what am I doing? It's
going to be almost as bad as
freshman year again. I don't
know a soul. And what if I don't
get housing?"
These and other thoughts
pass through the minds of some
200-300 transfer students every
summer.
Transfer students are a
unique breed. Older, and
assumed to be "wiser" than
freshmen, in the past they have
been shuffled off to a corner for
a two-hour "orientation," and
then left to their own vices in
trying to survive on The Farm.
This year promises to be
different. Approaching Stanford
has its own transfer brochure.
And the housing situation is
getting better, with transfers
having more priority for
on-campus housing.
Rough
But it still won't be
completely rosy. The first
quarter for any new student is
rough, but it can be especially
hard on a transfer student. The
closeness and empathy of the
freshman dorm is missing.
Isolation is perhaps the biggest
problem to fight.
Househunting is no fun,
especially when one doesn't
know the area well. This is
where the Clearing House can be

a big help. The maps,
information and rental listings
cover the Mid-Peninsula area.
But the best thing about the
Clearing House is the other
people who are also
househunting â€” you can pool
your resources with a roommate.
Understand
It's probably best not to
room with another new student.
That's like the blind leading the
blind. Try to get a returning
student who's been kicked off
campus, or better yet, a
returning student who was once
a transfer a few years back.
They'll understand.
If you must live off campus
for a while, try to get as close to
campus as possible (i.e. the
sooner you start hunting, the

better). If you're just boarding
somewhere or don't feel like
cooking, buy a meal plan in one of
the dorms or eating clubs. It's a
good way to meet people.
Meeting new people on The
Farm can be both fun and
annoying. Everyone wants to
know where you used to go to
school and why you transferred.
Although it can be interesting to
exchange stories about different
colleges, after a while it gets to
be a drag.
People reminisce about
freshman dorms here, and you
start to think that maybe you
missed out on something. And
there's always the obnoxious
smart ass who thinks the only
reason you transferred is because
you were rejected freshman

year. Sneaking in the back door,
they call it.
There are going to be times
those first few weeks when
you're going to wish fervently
that you had stayed where you
were last year. "There, I knew
people. I knew my way around.
The people were normal there "
But the sweet nostalgia soon
passes. After all, you did leave
that other place. There had to be
a reason.
Soon you're going to be in
the swing of things and you
might decide you like it here at
the Country Club. And you're
going to discover it's not near as
bad as freshman year was. After
all, you've been through that
before.
