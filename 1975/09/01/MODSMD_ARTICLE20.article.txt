# Seven University Profs Awarded Nobel Prize

### PHILIP FEDER 
The University has seven Nobel Prize
winners. The Nobel Prize is considered by
many to be the highest honor for an
individual involved in research, writing or
diplomacy.
Emeritus Physics Prof. Felix Bloch shared
the 1952 Nobel Prize in physics with Harvard
Prof. E.M. Purcell. They were lauded for their
studies and discoveries of nuclear induction.
A native of Switzerland and educated in
Europe, Bloch has been at Stanford since
1934.
Bloch, who will be 70 in October, was the
first theoretical physicist at Stanford.
The most recent recipient of a Nobel Prize
from Stanford is Chemistry Prof. Paul Flory,
who won the award last year for his work in

the chemistry and physics of large molecules.
Flory, 65, was cited "for his fundamental
achievements, both theoretical and
experimental, in the physical chemistry of
macromolecules" â€” the substance of modern
plastics and many biological compounds.
In honoring Flory, the Nobel Academy
said, "For nearly 40 years that Flory has been
active as a research scientist, the chemistry of
macromolecules has developed from what,
theoretically speaking, was a primitive
discipline, to the highly advanced science of
today."
Physics Prof. Robert Hofstadter won the
Nobel prize for physics in 1961. Hofstadter,
headed the High Energy Physics
Laboratory until 1974, where he carried out
the research that earned him the Nobel Prize.

He used the billion-volt Mark 111 linear
electron accelerator to bombard atomic nuclei
and thereby obtained the first and most
accurate measurements of the density
distributions of electric charge in nuclei and in
neutrons and protons.
Hofstadter, 60, has been on the faculty
here since 1950.
In 1954 and 1962, Emeritus Chemistry
Prof. Linus Pauling received the Nobel Prizes
for chemistry and for peace, respectively.
Pauling, 74, is widely regarded as a leading
exponent of the theory that large intakes of
Vitamin C can reduce the chances of
contracting the common cold
His research has covered the field of human
suffering, including the causes of genetic
mutation, the transmission of aberrant genes

and possible relationships between body
chemical imbalance and mental illness.
He won the chemistry award for his
research on the nature of the chemical bond
and the second for his work as a "citizen in
the cause of peace."
Arthur Romberg, a biochemistry professor
at the Medical School here, was awarded the
Nobel Prize in medicine in 1959. He was
honored for turning a mixture of inert
chemiclas in a test tube into DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid).
Kornberg, 57, was the first scientist to
manufacture in the laboratory DNA, the
complex material which determines the nature
of offspring for animals, plants, bacteria and
some viruses.
Genetics and Biological Sciences Prof.

Joshua Lederberg, 50, won the Nobel Prize in
medicine in 1958 for his discovery of the
phenomenon of "sexual recombination" in
micro-organisms.
Lederberg found clear-cut evidence that
the cells of bacteria are much like those of
animals and plants and probably have nuclei
containing gene-like units in chromosome-like
groupings, too.
Emeritus Electrical Engineering Prof.
William Shockley won the Nobel Prize in
physics in 1956 for his work in co-inventing
the transistor tube.
Shockley is more well-known for his
controversial theories concerning intelligence.
He has been an advocate of voluntary
sterilization of blacks with inferior
intelligence
