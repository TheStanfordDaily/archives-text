# Women's Center, CROW Provide Help For Women
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
The Women's Center and the
Center for Research on Women
(CROW) are two organizations
at Stanford devoted to serving
women's needs — but the
comparison ends there.
The Women's Center is
located on the third floor of the
Clubhouse, near the Old Union.
It occupies a small, cluttered
office. The files are not yet
organized and are temporarily
stacked on a shelf or scattered
on a beaten couch.
The Center is a student-run
organization that grew out of

the movements of the 60s, and
the fact that it has to make do
with such meager quarters
speaks of a lack of University
recognition.
The Center has a dual
purpose, explains collective
member Barbara Brown. It acts
as a "referral center, a resource
warehouse" where women can
drop in and receive help for any
number of problems. The Center
will make referrals to doctors,
gynecologists, therapists, will set
up consciousness-raising groups,
and will try to assist in any other
wav necessary to a student.

Brown explains that the
Center's files are available so
that women may find their own
information, and students may
also pick up "A Guide for
Stanford Women," on which
Brown and CROW coordinator
Cynthia Davis collaborated.
The other purpose of the
Center is to act as a "clearing
house" for women with specific
interests to get together "and
form their own groups." Brown
explains that Rape Crises, Peer
Counseling at Cowell, and
Stanford Women Athletes were
an outgrowth of the Center.

The Center first started with
the YWCA, and political
differences caused a split. Brown
says that the two are beginning
to get closer together.
The future of the Women's
Center looks somewhat more
optimistic organizationally.
Brown says that in the fall, it
will be open every day, with
regular hours. Brown, who
worked extensively with the
Center as an undergraduate
volunteer, says that the Center
will also have a woman "paid to
work here," named Nancy
Kaible.
In the future, Brown would
like to see "more outgrowths"
of organizations from the
Center, as she feels that this is
one of their most vital functions.
And she emphasizes that the
Center's drop-in facilities are
always welcome to anyone
needing help.
Whereas the Women's Center
is politically oriented, taking an
activist stand, CROW is an
"academic-educational-research"
organization, says coordinator
Cynthia Davis.
Davis compares CROW with
the Women's Center by saying,
"Call the Women's Center for an
abortion — here we do current
research on family planning."
She adds that CROW does make
referrals, but that isn't its main
objective.
"Current research" also
includes work on women in the
labor force, health care
standards, women and the mass
media, biological and
psychological sex differences
and the education of women at
Stanford. Research teams
include various professors from
the University.

CROW also publishes a
newsletter, sponsors lecture
series, seminars and visiting
professors.
CROW began in 1974 after
two years of planning. Davis says
that it now has "a full and
legitimate position within the
University. We have faculty
commitments to establish
educational programs and
research," she continues.
People come to CROW when
they have a research interest and
wish to find out the logistics of
pursuing their interests.
"We have centralized
information on research on men
and women, and people can
come in and find out what is
being done. We have the
resources that can direct and
relate a student to other
courses" and direct students to
the appropriate faculty
members.
"We help to clarify student's
thoughts before they do their
research," she summarizes, and
adds, "We keep in touch with
current trends."
Davis says that "if a student
wants to do a project, wants to
bring a speaker, do a SWOPS I
course, compile an anthology on
undergraduate research, CROW
helps to draft the proposals, and
will help the student get credit."
CROW itself cannot give credit
for projects completed.
Like all new campus
organizations, CROW has
financial worries, but its short
existence has generally been
successful. Its two offices in
Polya Hall near the
communication department are
bright, neat and spacious.

also pick up "A Guide for
Stanford Women," on which
Brown and CROW coordinator
Cynthia Davis collaborated.
The other purpose of the
Center is to act as a "clearing
house" for women with specific
interests to get together "and
form their own groups." Brown
explains that Rape Crises, Peer
Counseling at Cowell, and
Stanford Women Athletes were
an outgrowth of the Center.

The Center first started with
the YWCA, and political
differences caused a split. Brown
says that the two are beginning
to get closer together.
The future of the Women's
Center looks somewhat more
optimistic organizationally.
Brown says that in the fall, it
will be open every day, with
regular hours. Brown, who
worked extensively with the
Center as an undergraduate
volunteer, says that the Center
will also have a woman "paid to
work here," named Nancy
Kaible.
In the future, Brown would
like to see "more outgrowths"
of organizations from the
Center, as she feels that this is
one of their most vital functions.
And she emphasizes that the
Center's drop-in facilities are
always welcome to anyone
needing help.
Whereas the Women's Center
is politically oriented, taking an
activist stand, CROW is an
"academic-educational-research"
organization, says coordinator
Cynthia Davis.
Davis compares CROW with
the Women's Center by saying,
"Call the Women's Center for an
abortion — here we do current
research on family planning."
She adds that CROW does make
referrals, but that isn't its main
objective.
"Current research" also
includes work on women in the
labor force, health care
standards, women and the mass
media, biological and
psychological sex differences
and the education of women at
Stanford. Research teams
include various professors from
the University.

CROW also publishes a
newsletter, sponsors lecture
series, seminars and visiting
professors.
CROW began in 1974 after
two years of planning. Davis says
that it now has "a full and
legitimate position within the
University. We have faculty
commitments to establish
educational programs and
research," she continues.
People come to CROW when
they have a research interest and
wish to find out the logistics of
pursuing their interests.
"We have centralized
information on research on men
and women, and people can
come in and find out what is
being done. We have the
resources that can direct and
relate a student to other
courses" and direct students to
the appropriate faculty
members.
"We help to clarify student's
thoughts before they do their
research," she summarizes, and
adds, "We keep in touch with
current trends."
Davis says that "if a student
wants to do a project, wants to
bring a speaker, do a SWOPS I
course, compile an anthology on
undergraduate research, CROW
helps to draft the proposals, and
will help the student get credit."
CROW itself cannot give credit
for projects completed.
Like all new campus
organizations, CROW has
financial worries, but its short
existence has generally been
successful. Its two offices in
Polya Hall near the
communication department are
bright, neat and spacious.
The Women's Center and the
Center for Research on Women
(CROW) are two organizations
at Stanford devoted to serving
women's needs — but the
comparison ends there.
The Women's Center is
located on the third floor of the
Clubhouse, near the Old Union.
It occupies a small, cluttered
office. The files are not yet
organized and are temporarily
stacked on a shelf or scattered
on a beaten couch.
The Center is a student-run
organization that grew out of

the movements of the 60s, and
the fact that it has to make do
with such meager quarters
speaks of a lack of University
recognition.
The Center has a dual
purpose, explains collective
member Barbara Brown. It acts
as a "referral center, a resource
warehouse" where women can
drop in and receive help for any
number of problems. The Center
will make referrals to doctors,
gynecologists, therapists, will set
up consciousness-raising groups,
and will try to assist in any other
wav necessary to a student.

Brown explains that the
Center's files are available so
that women may find their own
information, and students may
also pick up "A Guide for
Stanford Women," on which
Brown and CROW coordinator
Cynthia Davis collaborated.
