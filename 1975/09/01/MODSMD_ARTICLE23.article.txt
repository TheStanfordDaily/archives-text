# Faculty Members Organized Into Academic Council, Staff
## 
### PHILIP FEDER BRUCE KADDEN 
The instructional staff here is
divided into two major
groupings: the Academic
Council (faculty), comprised of
all assistant, associate, adjunct
and full professors, and the
Academic Staff, comprised of
lecturers, senior lecturers,
research associates and senior
research associates.
The Academic Council
members either have tenured
positions or are eligible for such
positions, with the exception of
the adjunct professor post.
Adjunct professors are judged by
normal tenUre standards of the
tenured faculty with respect
either to teaching or research,
but not both.
All other professors are
judged on both standards —
teaching and research. The

"judging" takes place for most
professors at three stages in their
involvement with the University.
First, when someone applies
for a position on the faculty,
he/she is reviewed on the basis
of past teaching and research
and on future promise in those
areas. If accepted, the initial
appointment is normally at the
level of an assistant professor
and is renewable for up to seven
years.
Second, sometime before
those seven years have elapsed,
the non-tenured faculty member
in question normally is reviewed
by his department, the
University provost and by other
tenure committees with respect
to his/her teaching and research.
Tenured Position
If the individual is not
granted a tenured position, that
person is, in gross terms, fired. If
tenure is granted, however, the
individual holds tenure at
Stanford until retirement.
Third, if the individual is
given tenure as an associate
professor, then after an

indeterminate number of years,
he/she is reviewed for promotion
to full professor status. The time
element involved in granting
such status varies from school to
school.
The Academic Staff was
formed because the University
believes that career teachers or
career researchers have a place in
the University.
Lecturers and senior lecturers
— the teaching staff — and
research associates and senior
research associates — the
research staff — have hiring
procedures similar to those of
the Academic Council.
Lecturers are appointed for
renewable terms of up to five
years and research associates for
three years, after which they are
either fired or promoted to the
respective senior status. The
senior lecturers and senior
research associates enjoy the
security of continuing terms of
appointment so long as
satisfactory performance,
"programmatic needs" and
financial support of the
sponsored research continue.

normal tenUre standards of the
tenured faculty with respect
either to teaching or research,
but not both.
All other professors are
judged on both standards —
teaching and research. The

"judging" takes place for most
professors at three stages in their
involvement with the University.
First, when someone applies
for a position on the faculty,
he/she is reviewed on the basis
of past teaching and research
and on future promise in those
areas. If accepted, the initial
appointment is normally at the
level of an assistant professor
and is renewable for up to seven
years.
Second, sometime before
those seven years have elapsed,
the non-tenured faculty member
in question normally is reviewed
by his department, the
University provost and by other
tenure committees with respect
to his/her teaching and research.
Tenured Position
If the individual is not
granted a tenured position, that
person is, in gross terms, fired. If
tenure is granted, however, the
individual holds tenure at
Stanford until retirement.
Third, if the individual is
given tenure as an associate
professor, then after an

indeterminate number of years,
he/she is reviewed for promotion
to full professor status. The time
element involved in granting
such status varies from school to
school.
The Academic Staff was
formed because the University
believes that career teachers or
career researchers have a place in
the University.
Lecturers and senior lecturers
— the teaching staff — and
research associates and senior
research associates — the
research staff — have hiring
procedures similar to those of
the Academic Council.
Lecturers are appointed for
renewable terms of up to five
years and research associates for
three years, after which they are
either fired or promoted to the
respective senior status. The
senior lecturers and senior
research associates enjoy the
security of continuing terms of
appointment so long as
satisfactory performance,
"programmatic needs" and
financial support of the
sponsored research continue.
