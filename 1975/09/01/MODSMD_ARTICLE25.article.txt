# Stanford: A Family Affair
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Leland Stanford Junior
University was founded out of a
very simple but intense love and
memory of a mother and father
for their son, but its ideals were
so broad as to include the
education of all children and the
desire to teach people to do
something useful with their lives.
Leland Stanford was born in
1824 in Waterliet, New York. He
never received the university
education that was to mean so
much to him for others in the
founding of his university.
Instead, he was educated at
country schools and later
apprenticed himself to a law
firm in Albany. He was admitted
to the New York and Wisconsin
bars.
His future wife, Jane
Lathrop, was bom in Albany,
New York, in 1828. She was the
daughter of moderately
well-to-do parents, and received
the normal private school
education that was fitting for
girls of her day.
The Stanfords were married
in 1850. In 1852, Leland went
alone to San Francisco to begin
his business ventures. Jane
stayed behind in New York until
1855 to care for her ailing
father, to whom she was very
close.

Settled In California
The Stanfords then moved to
Wisconsin, where they lived until
a tragic fire destroyed Leland's
law library. To start a new life,
they moved to Sacramento via
Nicaragua in 1855; Leland's
father had told them that
California was the place to be.
In Sacramento, Leland
purchased his brothers' store,
and then began his political life.
In 1856, he helped to organize
Sacramento's Republican party.
Four years later, he was chosen
as a delegate to the Chicago
convention, where he supported
Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence
with his election in 1861 as
governor of California. As
former Stanford student, and
later president, Ray Lyman
Wilbur writes in his Memoirs, "as
governor of California he had led
in the battle to keep California
in the Union against those who
wanted it to follow the South or
to set it up as a separate
republic." In 1885, he was to be
elected to the United States
Senate.
Stanford museum docent and
chairman of the Stanford Family
Portfolio Peg Haneberg says that
Leland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the
standing armies of Europe were
a waste of time and manpower,"
she says. "He believed that
disputes should be settled by
arbitration."
That same year, 1861,
Stanford and three other men
formed the Central Pacific
Railroad, of which he later was
elected president. Later, a series
of complicated mergers
consolidated several railroads
into the Central Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
to the University libraries, says
that Leland and his three
associates were known as the
"big four."
"He has been characterized
by some historians as a robber
baron," he adds. "If he was
really so despicable he wouldn't
have been liked so much by his
employees."
At first the railroad was
considered to be a risky financial
venture, but it later proved to be
a most lucrative investment, as it
was later to help support the
University. To celebrate the first

transcontinental line, Leland
drove a golden spike in a
ceremony in Promontory, Utah,
in 1869.
Horseplay
Stanford's business
adventures allowed him some
measure of play. In 1870 he
bought his first race horse,
named Occident. He later bred,
trained and raced horses very
successfully; one year his horse
won a world's record. When the
horse died, Kentucky racers
were relieved.
An investment in the
California Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but
only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete. In spite of the low
five-cent fare for riding the cable
cars, the stock eventually made
him an even wealthier man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881 he bought a
vineyard in Vina, Ca., and tried
to make table wine. According
to Haneberg, he invested a lot of

money in it, and made good
brandy, but never got good table
wine.
'Farmer At Heart'
Hansen says that Stanford
was a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
"He was a pioneer of
viticulture," he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina
were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France for champagne, but
they failed and became brandy.
His Weidel Winery at Mission
San Jose still produces
successfully.
Jane had meanwhile made her
husband her career, and the two
were very close. Because of her
husband's many personal and
business interests, she knew
many famous people, traveled
widely, and lived well. And after
her husband's death, she
successfully kept the University
running despite legal and
financial complications with the

estate.
Hansen says that "Jane's
outstanding characteristic was
that she was deeply religious.
Her life centered in her belief in
immortality and Jesus Christ."
Jane supported Catholic
charities, but neither she nor
Leland belonged to any
particular church. At the
University's dedication, both a
rabbi and a bishop officiated at
the ceremony.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
Hansen continues. "She
established kindergartens in
Menlo Park and San Francisco.
She was involved in women's
suffrage, and supported Susan B.
Anthony. She was ahead of her
time."
In his Memoirs Wilbur
describes Jane as "never a
beautiful woman — some
thought she resembled Queen
Victoria in general appearance,
which rather pleased her. She had
a commanding presence and
friendly dignity which only a
great heart, courage and strong
convictions and character can
give."
Up until their 18th year of
marriage, the Stanfords
remained childless. Finally, in
1868 in Sacramento, Leland Jr.
was born. Jane was 40 at the
time of his birth; according to
Stanford Art Museum docent
Glenda Northway, he was her
"previous jewel."
Leland Jr. had everything a
child could want. He was taken
on trips abroad, was educated by
the best tutors. For a while he
attended Heald Business College
in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child, his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved the boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland Jr.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr.
was very intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur writes
that Leland and Jane had a
"happy and dignified home
life," and trained their son in a
"sensible and careful way ... for
responsibility that he would
handle wisely and well their vast
fortune which they thought
would become his..
The joys of parenthood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was
vacationing in Istanbul, Leland
Jr. contracted typhoid fever. He
got worse in Naples and Rome,
and in 1884, died in Florence.
He was 16.
Tremendous Blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an only child
was a tremendous blow. When
Leland Jr. died, his father sank
into a coma from the shock.
In his father's dreams, it is
said that Leland Jr. appeared
and said, "live for humanity."
When he awoke, Leland said,
"California's children shall be
my children." Thus Leland
founded Leland Stanford
Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her
son, established the Leland
Stanford Junior Museum.
Museums were her son's passion
and lifelong dream; the fall he
was 16, he had planned to enter
Harvard and study courses
pertaining to the running of a
museum.

Today, the museum has as
permanent collections pottery,
weavings and sculpture that the
Stanfords brought back from
their many European travels.
And a room devoted entirely to
the Stanford family has the
personal boyhood mementos of
Leland Jr., as well as paintings of
the family. *
Cornerstone Laid
The cornerstone for the new
University was laid on May 14 in
1887 — it would have been
Leland Jr.'s 19th birthday. In a
copper box in the cornerstone,
the Stanfords placed, among
other documents pertaining to
the organization of the
University, a photograph of their
son. The University was to open
four years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble
choosing the site for his
University. Although the
Stanfords had various houses,
Palo Alto was home, so he chose
his Palo Alto Farm.
"The senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "I
particularly liked Mr. Stanford's
idea of what education should
be, that it should be for 'direct
usefulness in life.' He wanted it
to break away from the
tradition-bound classical and
philosophical programs of some
of the older eastern institutions,
and to develop along the more
practical and scientific lines in
which Cornell University, the
Johns Hopkins University and
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering.
Jordan First President
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a

man of courage and initiative,
scientifically trained, who could
see and try new ways of doing
things. Such a man he found in
David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stanford
in 1892, writes of his early
impressions of the physical
expansiveness and vastness of
the University: "We came along
El Camino Real, then a narrow
dirt road. . . We swung up to the
University buildings, which were
then only what we call now the
Inner Quadrangle (Memorial
Church had not yet been built],
"With the buff sandstone

wall, red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were
delightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford was
coed. Girls were housed in Roble
Hall; the men in Encina Hall.
Hansen says that Encina has
been "slowly remodeled" and
now houses offices, the
Economics Department and the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'Favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were
accepted at Stanford; Haneberg
says that Leland "favored"
women. But Jane went along

with her husband's wishes, and
in spite of her misgivings,
women were respected and given
equal rights.
To welcome the women, Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo
Alto home, the site of the
present Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1899, women began
to increase. Jane became
concerned that more women
than men would attend the
University that had been
dedicated to her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited more
than 500 women. "Up until the
early 30's, they were known as
the 'Stanford 500.' It was later
rescinded by the trustees."
No Tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Lelatid believed that all
his "children" should be entitled
to an education. Students were
responsible for paying their own
miscellaneous expenses, and the
University charged $4.50 weekly
for room and board.
Wilbur writes that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina and asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jose company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited
business." The quiet, friendly
chap was Herbert Hoover.
Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new
educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing
organization, with educational
processes in debate at practically
every meeting of the faculty, but
the students themselves were
likewise developing their own
organizations, their athletic
teams, their debating, literary
and musical societies and

fraternities. . .
"A good many ... new
traditions evaporated with one
trial, some lasted a little longer,
a few became a lasting part of
Stanford life. With the trial and
error method there developed
good leadership and some rather
unique and appropriate
customs ... We were starting
from the very beginning."
Stanford's Death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if
the University could survive

financially after Leland's death.
The estate was tied up in court
for some time. Jane, who had a
massive jewelry collection
second only to the queen of
England, established the Jewel
Fund, the money of which was
used to pay for salaries and
books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded
determination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full speed
ahead" to save the University

"When Leland died, the
lawyers advised her to close the
University," Hansen says. "She
refused, saying, 'If the school
closed down I would have
nothing to live for.' The
University became her son; every
energy and dollar mustered went
to the University. It was part of
her Christian zeal."
In 1905, Jane died.
Confusion
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wilbur
and Haneberg concur that death
was caused by a heart attack.
Rumors at the time had it that
she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid. .. "as was
headlined in some of the more
sensational newspapers," writes
Wilbur.
Jane's body was placed, along
with her husband and son, in the
mausoleum, set apart from the
main grounds in a grove of oak
trees.
Another shock was to come
to the University, this time in
the form of the massive 1906
earthquake. The new Outer
Quad, much of the museum, the
library, the gym, arches and
Jane's beloved, recently -built
Memorial Church were badly
damaged. The statue of biologist
Agassiz, located in front of
Jordan Hall, fell headfirst into
the pavement. A student and
fireman were killed.
Wilbur writes that the
University was relieved that Jane
wasn't alive to see the damage,
as that in itself would have killed
her. "It was just a case of
starting all over again."
"Starting all over again"
meant immediately beginning
restoration of the damaged
buildings. Wilbur writes that
President Jordan issued a
statement saying that "the
actual needs of the growing
University" would be first
considered.
No "backward" steps were
taken in repairs, nor were
faculty numbers reduced. For a
while, the University could not
accept any more students; the
year after the quake, students
returned "in greater number
than ever before."
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some
philosophical lessons from the
earthquake, commenting that
'forever man must rise above his
own creations.' " The young
University soon fully recovered.

THE CAMP — These dormitories for less-affluent male students stood on the current site of the
Peterson engineering labs. Originally temporary shacks for construction crews, the University
converted them to cheap student housing during an early housing shortage.
