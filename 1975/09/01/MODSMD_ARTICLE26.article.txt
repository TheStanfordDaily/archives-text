# The
						Campus At A Glance: Places To Know
## 
### 
Everyone will tell you that
the dormitory — usually the
source of good times — is also
a hotbed for microscopic
organisms that invade bodies
and cause communicable
diseases to flourish.
The answer to the problem
is the Cowell Student Health
Center, located on Campus
Drive, behind the Wilbur and
Stern dorms.
During the cold and wet
winter months when cases
of the flu abound, Cowell is
inundated with student
patients from the time it
opens at 9 a.m.
Cowell also offers
extensive birth control and
contraceptive counseling.
Any services at Cowell are
free of charge, except for
common over-the-counter
products and very highly
priced medication.
Call Cowell at 497-4841.
There is someone on duty 24
hours a day.

Memorial Church, located
in the Inner Quad at the
center of the campus, is the
religious hub of the
University. Dean of the
Chapel Robert Hamer
ton-Kelly directs the
non-denominational church.
The church offers Bible
studies, prayer groups,
informal courses, counseling,
workshops and discussions
with visiting preachers and
lecturers.
In the 1974-75 school
year, newsworthy campus
figures chatted and ate "a
frugal lunch" with all
, students who cared to come
to the "MemChu" Lound
Room.
The University Public
Worship, given at 11 a.m.
each Sunday is Protestant. A
small Communion Service
convenes at 7 p.m., except
1 for the first Sunday of each
month (when it is at 11 a.m.)
q and a Roman Catholic Mass is
held at 4 p.m.

Student activity abounds
I at Tresidder Memorial Union,
known simply as "Tresidder."
Vendors on neighboring
White Plaza display their
wares during lunchtime as
I students enjoy the afternoon
sun.
The food at Tresidder
| leaves a bit to be desired. The
I Transition, open daily from
11 a.m. to 7 p.m., serves

greasy hamburgers that are
more expensive than
McDonald's. The Coffee
House next door serves
over-priced delicatessen
sandwiches, which can satisfy
the palate.
Night life at the Coffee
House features exotic
beverages as students play
chess, speak French or talk
politics.

Tresidder also features a
very convenient branch of
Wells Fargo Bank, with an
express window that is open
until 5 p.m. during the week.
There is also a barber shop, a
travel bureau, a computerized
ticket outlet for all Bay Area
events, and a low-priced
bowling alley, including
billiards and pinball
machines.

The J. Henry Meyer
Memorial Library (known as
UGLY), designed primarily
for undergraduates, holds a
collection of over 100,000
volumes and provides seating
space for 1500 people. The
four floors are divided into
eight large reading and service
areas.
The general book
collection is arranged on open

shelves (except for two hour
reserve books kept at the
Loan Desk) throughout the
upper three floors.
The UGLY is not the place
to go for concentrated
studying. At times, talking
and socializing take
precedence over academics.
During finals and dead

week those tension-filled days
when studying usually
commences, musical string
quartets and acrobats have
been known to put on a show
inside the library.
UGLY is open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m.
to midnight and Saturday and
Sunday from 10 a.m. to
midnight.

The Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, more
commonly known as SLAC,
is located on Sand Hill Road,
northwest of the main
campus.
SLAC is a two-mile long
accelerator tube sunk 25 feet
under closely compacted soil.
Inside the tube, atoms are
smashed at very high speeds.
The process of blasting
atomic particles into each
other has led to some
significant discoveries.
A SLAC team last fall was
successful in manufacturing
short-lived particles never
before seen. It was, to many
people, a rare moment in high
energy physics.
Wolfgang Kurt Hermann
Panofsky is director of SLAC,
which is largely supported by
federal funds.

The Hoover Institution On
War, Revolution and Peace is
located at the main landmark
of the University - Hoover
Tower. The structure is 235
feet high, with 23 levels.
At the top of the tower is
a 35-bell carillon, a gift of
thanks to Herbert Hoover
from t:ie Belgian American
Educational Foundation.
The library 7 is open to all
students of college level and
above Monday through
Friday from 8:15 a.m. until
5:30 p.m. and on Saturday
from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. The
library is closed on Sunday.
There are about 150
visiting and resident senior
scholars, research associates,
curators, librarians and
administrative personnel.
Institution fellows include
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
former California Gov.
Ronald Reagan, Seymour
Martin Lipset and many
others.
The Institution remains a
mystery to many students. It
is independent within the
framework of the University,
I and many of its scholars have
I little or no contact with the
| student community.
| Students may take an
| elevator to the top of the
| tower during the day at no
| charge. On a clear day, the
| view of the campus and the
I Bay Area is spectacular.
