# Campus Almanac
## Who, What, When, Where And Why 
### 
Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school is
in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
the University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the 1974-75 year: How
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Budget Blues
As the stock market declines
and prices continue to increase,
Stanford is discovering that it
does not have the money it used
to have. In 1974-75 the
University lost about $2 million
in annual income. Sharply
increased energy costs and
higher-than-expected salary rises
have combined to produce a
$10.2 million gap between
long-term income and
expenditure projections.
The $10 million has to be
slashed from the University's
budget within a three-year
period. And a lot of these
cutbacks are becoming painfully
visible to students.
Tuition is on thjp rise: next
year's bill is $3810, an increase
of $425 over 1974-75.
Innovative education will
suffer extensively. SWOPSI and
SCIRE are scheduled to be
phased out soon, as is the
Program on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs suggested
that an umbrella agency,
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPEL), absorb several
innovative programs now
operating.
Gibbs came under fire for the
proposed cutbacks. Both
students and faculty accused
him of mishandling his office
and his job. A mock funeral was
held to protest the "Death of
Undergraduate Education."
In the midst of all this
controversy, Provost William
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as of August 1976.
Housing System Changes
Back in the winter of 1974,
students living in Alpha Sigma
Phi, a coed "fraternity,"
complained of inequities in the
housing draw — as a coed house,
Alpha Sig is filled through the
draw, while all-male frats enjoy
exempt status. But the

University simply brushed off
the Alpha Sig request, never
envisioning the controversy in
which it was to become
enmeshed nine months later
With the passage of Title IX,
a section of the Federal
Education Amendments Act of
1972, which revokes any federal
funding from organizations
which discriminate on the basis
of sex, Stanford was in trouble.
For most universities, that
regulation has little to do with
their housing policies But
Stanford is not like most
universities. Since the 1940s
there have been no sororities
here, although fraternities
remain active. And all
on-campus housing, except
fraternities, is meted out by
lottery through the annual
housing draw. Hence, although
men had the option of joining a
fraternity where they were
guaranteed on-campus housing
every year they were at
Stanford, women had to be
content with taking their
chances every year with the
draw.
According to Title IX
regulations, this is considered
discriminatory And since
Stanford receives at least 10
percent of its revenues for
educational purposes from the
federal government, something
had to be done, especially in the
wake of a severe housing crunch
at Stanford.
What eventually came of the
controversy was the current
housing plan being put into
effect this fall. Beginning with
the Class of '78, every student is
guaranteed on-campus housing
three out of four years here
(including freshman year).
Students are allowed to pick
either their sophomore, junior or
senior year as the year they wish
to live off campus (going
overseas counts as off-campus if
it is during fall quarter).
For their part, the fraternities
are admitting more members
into their ranks to fulfill quotas
set by the University. The frats
have the choice of either
uncomfortably crowding their
members or of establishing
off-campus annexes.
Perry Murder
Sunday morning, Oct. 13, a
campus security guard routinely
went about unlocking Memorial
Church to prepare for worship
services. Inside, he discovered
the brutally murdered body of
Arlis Perry, 19, newlywed wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce
Perry.
Arlis had gone to pray in the
church late the night before. She
had been strangled, stabbed and
sexually molested with an altar
candle.
The Perry murder was the
fourth in less than two years
that still remain unsolved at
Stanford. Leslie Perlov, a
21-year-old Stanford graduate
and Palo Alto law librarian, was
found strangled to death on Feb.
16, 1973, in the foothills behind
campus. She had been missing
since Feb. 13.
On Sept. 11, 1973, David
Levine, a senior physics major
was brutally stabbed to death
between 1 and 3 a.m on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Janet Taylor, 21, daughter of
former Stanford athletic director
Chuck Taylor, was strangled

while hitchhiking back to her La
Honda home after visiting a
friend on campus.
Investigators have never
linked any of the murders,
although officials have admitted
to certain "similarities" in the
Taylor and Perlov murders.
Bay Area media covered the
bizarre story of the Perry
murder on their front pages,
screaming out the story of a sex
slaying at Stanford. Only a week
later, the 29-year-old wife of a
Stanford employee was
abducted in her own car around
8 p m. at the intersection of Pine
Hill Road and Bowdoin Street.
Her kidnaper forced her to drive
into the foothills near Page Mill
Road, where he molested her
but did not rape her.
The two events had a
predictable effect on the
campus. The number of
students, especially women,
roaming around campus at night
dropped dramatically. Even
now, nearly a year later,
students are leery of walking
around at night alone.
Publish Or Perish?
The tired, old cliche "publish
or perish" acquired a fresh and
sinister meaning for the
University last year when several
highly respected professors were
denied tenure and subsequently
dismissed.
The popular Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, winner
of the 1972 Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching, became
a sort of cause celebre in
January for those who opposed
the way in which tenure
decisions are made here.
The University Appointments
and Promotions (A&P)
Committee became the target of
Irish's supporters' wrath. Provost
William Miller's office was
inundated with mail protesting
the decision.
Although Miller and other

officials agreed that Irish was an
excellent teacher, the
administration maintained that
Irish did not publish enough of
his own work to warrant a
tenured position at Stanford.
Irish and his supporters
claimed that the A&P
Committee had failed to
distinguish between the quantity
and the quality of his
scholarship.
The tentacles of the A&P
Committee's decisions have had
a far-reaching impact already.
Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
resigned as department chairman
last fall to protest the firing of
three professors in his
department. Yale Prof. C John
Harrington broke off plans to
accept an appointment at
Stanford upon hearing of the
committee's decision.
Asst. English Prof. Emerson
Brown and Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern had decided
by the end of last year to leave
the University, although Bern
has now decided to return to
Stanford spring quarter. And
noted Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown has cited
the tenure controversy as a
major factor in his decision to
accept a part-time appointment
at the Pacific School of Religion
in Berkeley this year.
Irish has accepted a tenured
position as head of the religious
studies department at Wichita

State University in Kansas
beginning this fall.
Minority Aid
The University last year
switched its basis for financial
aid to low- and middle-income
students from an ethnic criterion
to an economic criterion
In past years, the University
has met the financial needs of
minority students during their
freshman year. In subsequent
years, the students were
expected to provide at least
$500 in self-help.
The new policy calls for

blacks, chicanos and native
Americans to provide 80 percent
of the self-help expectation of
non-minority students.
Self-help is defined as money
provided either by a job during
the academic year or a
long-term, low interest loan, as
opposed to an outright grant.
The original proposal, drawn
up by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (C-UAFA), called
for a $700 self-help requirement
for all low- and middle-income
students, regardless of race,
during freshman year„
Amid sharp
criticism and several
demonstrations, the proposal
was modified to the current
policy.
The events of the past year
however, have managed to
alienate minority students from
the University Many remain
unconvinced, for all the
University's verbal assurances,
that Stanford's commitment to
the recruitment of minority
students has not diminished — at
least as far as the recruitment of
lower- and middle-income
minorities is concerned
Parking
Until last September,
Stanford's parking fee policy
would not have been considered
controversial. If you were a
student driver, you paid $10 a
year for the privilege of parking
on campus. Faculty and staff
parked for free.
Not all students bought
parking permits though. Some
preferred to take their chances.
With parking fines only $2 a
shot, one had to be ticketed five
times a year to make it worth it.
And that rarely happened.
But all that changed last fall
The University suspended its
parking policy until another
could be devised. Students
parked for free
But by Christmas nothing had
happened, so it was back to the
old fee policy in January.
Students were charged a
prorated fee of $7.50 for two
quarters. In the meantime, Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of studying the parking problem
and suggesting a solution.
Led by Escondido Village
Council President Cathie Colson,
students first boycotted
purchase of the parking stickers
and refused to pay the parking
fine. They then took the
University to court-
Backed by $3000 in ASSU
and Escondido Village Council
funds, Palo Alto attorney Dent
Hand was retained in an effort
to have the parking fee declared
unconstitutional.
Unfortunately, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Gallagher didn't see it the
same way. He denied the

plaintiffs a preliminary
injunction to prevent police
from citing cars without parking
stickers until the suit was
settled.
Carpenter's report was
submitted to the University
during spring break. After
modifications by the University
Committee on Land and
Building Development were
added to the recommendations,
President Lyman accepted the
new fee structure.
The new plan calls for much
higher fees next year than ever
before, in an attempt to
diminish the amount of
automobile traffic on campus.
Annual fees for faculty are $48,
$40 for staff and $32 for
off-campus students. On-campus
students will be charged $5 per
quarter.
Iranian Contract
It's been a while since the
University's research policies
were questioned. But members
of the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), Iranian Stanford
students and some sympathetic
professors managed to lead a
storm of protest here over the
University's contract with
National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT)
The $970,000 contract calls
for Assoc. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Electrical Engineering 235
students to design a
communication satellite design
for NIRT with the advice of
Communication Prof. Edwin
Parker of the Institute for
Communication Research.
Lusignan claims that the
project will benefit the people of
Iran, by improving education
and health care.
On the other hand,
opponents of the contract say
the communication system will
give even more power to the
Shah of Iran. They argue that
the University should not aid in
an already dictatorial
government
Commencement Furor
Commencement is supposed
to be that bittersweet time in
every graduate's life where one
looks fondly back on one's
undergraduate years and forward
to a bright and promising future.
But last year's graduation
ceremony held more bitterness
than anything else for the Class
of '75.
The selection in February of
former Harvard Government
Prof. and current U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as commencement
speaker started a long tirade of
protest. Some students
considered him incredibly boring
and many doubted his
scholarship, claiming Moynihan
was a racist for his advocacy in
the Nixon administration of
"benign neglect" toward the
problems of blacks in America.
But the ceremony went ahead
as scheduled on June 15.
Moynihan spoke and the
departments within Humanities

and Sciences received their
diplomas together.
Approximately 175 seniors
quietly walked out just before
Moynihan began his speech.
They returned when he finished.
Gombe Kidnaping
Last May, another tragedy
rocked the Stanford campus,
although this time the shock
waves were coming from
halfway around the world.
On May 19, three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher
were kidnaped by Marxist
guerrillas from the Gombe
Stream research center in
Tanzania, a Stanford-affiliated
facility directed by Dr. Jane
Goodall, a Stanford professor.
The four were taken across
Lake Tanganyika to Zaire, where
they were held for ransom. One
week later, Barbara Smuts, of
Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the
Stanford students, was released
by her captors, the Popular
Revolutionary Party of Zaire,
carrying ransom demands back
to Tanzanian officials.
Negotiations continued
throughout the month of June
to secure the release of the three
remaining prisoners — Carrie
Hunter, of Atherton, Calif.,
Kenneth Steven Smith, of
Garden Grove, Calif., and Emilie
Bergmann of the Netherlands.
Then on June 28, both
Hunter and Bergmann were set
free, leaving Smith as the lone
captive. Terms of the release
were not discussed with the
press, nor were negotiation plans
for the release of Smith.
Smith was released July 24
for an undisclosed ransom.
University administrators
refused to discuss the terms of
Smith's release in an effort to
protect other students and
faculty working abroad.

to have. In 1974-75 the
University lost about $2 million
in annual income. Sharply
increased energy costs and
higher-than-expected salary rises
have combined to produce a
$10.2 million gap between
long-term income and
expenditure projections.
The $10 million has to be
slashed from the University's
budget within a three-year
period. And a lot of these
cutbacks are becoming painfully
visible to students.
Tuition is on thjp rise: next
year's bill is $3810, an increase
of $425 over 1974-75.
Innovative education will
suffer extensively. SWOPSI and
SCIRE are scheduled to be
phased out soon, as is the
Program on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs suggested
that an umbrella agency,
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPEL), absorb several
innovative programs now
operating.
Gibbs came under fire for the
proposed cutbacks. Both
students and faculty accused
him of mishandling his office
and his job. A mock funeral was
held to protest the "Death of
Undergraduate Education."
In the midst of all this
controversy, Provost William
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as of August 1976.
Housing System Changes
Back in the winter of 1974,
students living in Alpha Sigma
Phi, a coed "fraternity,"
complained of inequities in the
housing draw — as a coed house,
Alpha Sig is filled through the
draw, while all-male frats enjoy
exempt status. But the

University simply brushed off
the Alpha Sig request, never
envisioning the controversy in
which it was to become
enmeshed nine months later
With the passage of Title IX,
a section of the Federal
Education Amendments Act of
1972, which revokes any federal
funding from organizations
which discriminate on the basis
of sex, Stanford was in trouble.
For most universities, that
regulation has little to do with
their housing policies But
Stanford is not like most
universities. Since the 1940s
there have been no sororities
here, although fraternities
remain active. And all
on-campus housing, except
fraternities, is meted out by
lottery through the annual
housing draw. Hence, although
men had the option of joining a
fraternity where they were
guaranteed on-campus housing
every year they were at
Stanford, women had to be
content with taking their
chances every year with the
draw.
According to Title IX
regulations, this is considered
discriminatory And since
Stanford receives at least 10
percent of its revenues for
educational purposes from the
federal government, something
had to be done, especially in the
wake of a severe housing crunch
at Stanford.
What eventually came of the
controversy was the current
housing plan being put into
effect this fall. Beginning with
the Class of '78, every student is
guaranteed on-campus housing
three out of four years here
(including freshman year).
Students are allowed to pick
either their sophomore, junior or
senior year as the year they wish
to live off campus (going
overseas counts as off-campus if
it is during fall quarter).
For their part, the fraternities
are admitting more members
into their ranks to fulfill quotas
set by the University. The frats
have the choice of either
uncomfortably crowding their
members or of establishing
off-campus annexes.
Perry Murder
Sunday morning, Oct. 13, a
campus security guard routinely
went about unlocking Memorial
Church to prepare for worship
services. Inside, he discovered
the brutally murdered body of
Arlis Perry, 19, newlywed wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce
Perry.
Arlis had gone to pray in the
church late the night before. She
had been strangled, stabbed and
sexually molested with an altar
candle.
The Perry murder was the
fourth in less than two years
that still remain unsolved at
Stanford. Leslie Perlov, a
21-year-old Stanford graduate
and Palo Alto law librarian, was
found strangled to death on Feb.
16, 1973, in the foothills behind
campus. She had been missing
since Feb. 13.
On Sept. 11, 1973, David
Levine, a senior physics major
was brutally stabbed to death
between 1 and 3 a.m on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Janet Taylor, 21, daughter of
former Stanford athletic director
Chuck Taylor, was strangled

while hitchhiking back to her La
Honda home after visiting a
friend on campus.
Investigators have never
linked any of the murders,
although officials have admitted
to certain "similarities" in the
Taylor and Perlov murders.
Bay Area media covered the
bizarre story of the Perry
murder on their front pages,
screaming out the story of a sex
slaying at Stanford. Only a week
later, the 29-year-old wife of a
Stanford employee was
abducted in her own car around
8 p m. at the intersection of Pine
Hill Road and Bowdoin Street.
Her kidnaper forced her to drive
into the foothills near Page Mill
Road, where he molested her
but did not rape her.
The two events had a
predictable effect on the
campus. The number of
students, especially women,
roaming around campus at night
dropped dramatically. Even
now, nearly a year later,
students are leery of walking
around at night alone.
Publish Or Perish?
The tired, old cliche "publish
or perish" acquired a fresh and
sinister meaning for the
University last year when several
highly respected professors were
denied tenure and subsequently
dismissed.
The popular Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, winner
of the 1972 Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching, became
a sort of cause celebre in
January for those who opposed
the way in which tenure
decisions are made here.
The University Appointments
and Promotions (A&P)
Committee became the target of
Irish's supporters' wrath. Provost
William Miller's office was
inundated with mail protesting
the decision.
Although Miller and other

officials agreed that Irish was an
excellent teacher, the
administration maintained that
Irish did not publish enough of
his own work to warrant a
tenured position at Stanford.
Irish and his supporters
claimed that the A&P
Committee had failed to
distinguish between the quantity
and the quality of his
scholarship.
The tentacles of the A&P
Committee's decisions have had
a far-reaching impact already.
Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
resigned as department chairman
last fall to protest the firing of
three professors in his
department. Yale Prof. C John
Harrington broke off plans to
accept an appointment at
Stanford upon hearing of the
committee's decision.
Asst. English Prof. Emerson
Brown and Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern had decided
by the end of last year to leave
the University, although Bern
has now decided to return to
Stanford spring quarter. And
noted Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown has cited
the tenure controversy as a
major factor in his decision to
accept a part-time appointment
at the Pacific School of Religion
in Berkeley this year.
Irish has accepted a tenured
position as head of the religious
studies department at Wichita

State University in Kansas
beginning this fall.
Minority Aid
The University last year
switched its basis for financial
aid to low- and middle-income
students from an ethnic criterion
to an economic criterion
In past years, the University
has met the financial needs of
minority students during their
freshman year. In subsequent
years, the students were
expected to provide at least
$500 in self-help.
The new policy calls for

blacks, chicanos and native
Americans to provide 80 percent
of the self-help expectation of
non-minority students.
Self-help is defined as money
provided either by a job during
the academic year or a
long-term, low interest loan, as
opposed to an outright grant.
The original proposal, drawn
up by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (C-UAFA), called
for a $700 self-help requirement
for all low- and middle-income
students, regardless of race,
during freshman year„
Amid sharp
criticism and several
demonstrations, the proposal
was modified to the current
policy.
The events of the past year
however, have managed to
alienate minority students from
the University Many remain
unconvinced, for all the
University's verbal assurances,
that Stanford's commitment to
the recruitment of minority
students has not diminished — at
least as far as the recruitment of
lower- and middle-income
minorities is concerned
Parking
Until last September,
Stanford's parking fee policy
would not have been considered
controversial. If you were a
student driver, you paid $10 a
year for the privilege of parking
on campus. Faculty and staff
parked for free.
Not all students bought
parking permits though. Some
preferred to take their chances.
With parking fines only $2 a
shot, one had to be ticketed five
times a year to make it worth it.
And that rarely happened.
But all that changed last fall
The University suspended its
parking policy until another
could be devised. Students
parked for free
But by Christmas nothing had
happened, so it was back to the
old fee policy in January.
Students were charged a
prorated fee of $7.50 for two
quarters. In the meantime, Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of studying the parking problem
and suggesting a solution.
Led by Escondido Village
Council President Cathie Colson,
students first boycotted
purchase of the parking stickers
and refused to pay the parking
fine. They then took the
University to court-
Backed by $3000 in ASSU
and Escondido Village Council
funds, Palo Alto attorney Dent
Hand was retained in an effort
to have the parking fee declared
unconstitutional.
Unfortunately, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Gallagher didn't see it the
same way. He denied the

plaintiffs a preliminary
injunction to prevent police
from citing cars without parking
stickers until the suit was
settled.
Carpenter's report was
submitted to the University
during spring break. After
modifications by the University
Committee on Land and
Building Development were
added to the recommendations,
President Lyman accepted the
new fee structure.
The new plan calls for much
higher fees next year than ever
before, in an attempt to
diminish the amount of
automobile traffic on campus.
Annual fees for faculty are $48,
$40 for staff and $32 for
off-campus students. On-campus
students will be charged $5 per
quarter.
Iranian Contract
It's been a while since the
University's research policies
were questioned. But members
of the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), Iranian Stanford
students and some sympathetic
professors managed to lead a
storm of protest here over the
University's contract with
National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT)
The $970,000 contract calls
for Assoc. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Electrical Engineering 235
students to design a
communication satellite design
for NIRT with the advice of
Communication Prof. Edwin
Parker of the Institute for
Communication Research.
Lusignan claims that the
project will benefit the people of
Iran, by improving education
and health care.
On the other hand,
opponents of the contract say
the communication system will
give even more power to the
Shah of Iran. They argue that
the University should not aid in
an already dictatorial
government
Commencement Furor
Commencement is supposed
to be that bittersweet time in
every graduate's life where one
looks fondly back on one's
undergraduate years and forward
to a bright and promising future.
But last year's graduation
ceremony held more bitterness
than anything else for the Class
of '75.
The selection in February of
former Harvard Government
Prof. and current U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as commencement
speaker started a long tirade of
protest. Some students
considered him incredibly boring
and many doubted his
scholarship, claiming Moynihan
was a racist for his advocacy in
the Nixon administration of
"benign neglect" toward the
problems of blacks in America.
But the ceremony went ahead
as scheduled on June 15.
Moynihan spoke and the
departments within Humanities

and Sciences received their
diplomas together.
Approximately 175 seniors
quietly walked out just before
Moynihan began his speech.
They returned when he finished.
Gombe Kidnaping
Last May, another tragedy
rocked the Stanford campus,
although this time the shock
waves were coming from
halfway around the world.
On May 19, three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher
were kidnaped by Marxist
guerrillas from the Gombe
Stream research center in
Tanzania, a Stanford-affiliated
facility directed by Dr. Jane
Goodall, a Stanford professor.
The four were taken across
Lake Tanganyika to Zaire, where
they were held for ransom. One
week later, Barbara Smuts, of
Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the
Stanford students, was released
by her captors, the Popular
Revolutionary Party of Zaire,
carrying ransom demands back
to Tanzanian officials.
Negotiations continued
throughout the month of June
to secure the release of the three
remaining prisoners — Carrie
Hunter, of Atherton, Calif.,
Kenneth Steven Smith, of
Garden Grove, Calif., and Emilie
Bergmann of the Netherlands.
Then on June 28, both
Hunter and Bergmann were set
free, leaving Smith as the lone
captive. Terms of the release
were not discussed with the
press, nor were negotiation plans
for the release of Smith.
Smith was released July 24
for an undisclosed ransom.
University administrators
refused to discuss the terms of
Smith's release in an effort to
protect other students and
faculty working abroad.

return this summer from Africa. The two Stanford students were
kidnaped along with Carrie Hunter, also a Stanford student, and
Emilie Bergmann, a Dutch research assistant, by Zaire rebels from
the Gombe Stream research center in Tanzania.
Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school is
in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
the University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the 1974-75 year: How
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.

of $425 over 1974-75.
Innovative education will
suffer extensively. SWOPSI and
SCIRE are scheduled to be
phased out soon, as is the
Program on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs suggested
that an umbrella agency,
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPEL), absorb several
innovative programs now
operating.
Gibbs came under fire for the
proposed cutbacks. Both
students and faculty accused
him of mishandling his office
and his job. A mock funeral was
held to protest the "Death of
Undergraduate Education."
In the midst of all this
controversy, Provost William
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as of August 1976.
Housing System Changes
Back in the winter of 1974,
students living in Alpha Sigma
Phi, a coed "fraternity,"
complained of inequities in the
housing draw — as a coed house,
Alpha Sig is filled through the
draw, while all-male frats enjoy
exempt status. But the

University simply brushed off
the Alpha Sig request, never
envisioning the controversy in
which it was to become
enmeshed nine months later
With the passage of Title IX,
a section of the Federal
Education Amendments Act of
1972, which revokes any federal
funding from organizations
which discriminate on the basis
of sex, Stanford was in trouble.
For most universities, that
regulation has little to do with
their housing policies But
Stanford is not like most
universities. Since the 1940s
there have been no sororities
here, although fraternities
remain active. And all
on-campus housing, except
fraternities, is meted out by
lottery through the annual
housing draw. Hence, although
men had the option of joining a
fraternity where they were
guaranteed on-campus housing
every year they were at
Stanford, women had to be
content with taking their
chances every year with the
draw.
According to Title IX
regulations, this is considered
discriminatory And since
Stanford receives at least 10
percent of its revenues for
educational purposes from the
federal government, something
had to be done, especially in the
wake of a severe housing crunch
at Stanford.
What eventually came of the
controversy was the current
housing plan being put into
effect this fall. Beginning with
the Class of '78, every student is
guaranteed on-campus housing
three out of four years here
(including freshman year).
Students are allowed to pick
either their sophomore, junior or
senior year as the year they wish
to live off campus (going
overseas counts as off-campus if
it is during fall quarter).
For their part, the fraternities
are admitting more members
into their ranks to fulfill quotas
set by the University. The frats
have the choice of either
uncomfortably crowding their
members or of establishing
off-campus annexes.
Perry Murder
Sunday morning, Oct. 13, a
campus security guard routinely
went about unlocking Memorial
Church to prepare for worship
services. Inside, he discovered
the brutally murdered body of
Arlis Perry, 19, newlywed wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce
Perry.
Arlis had gone to pray in the
church late the night before. She
had been strangled, stabbed and
sexually molested with an altar
candle.
The Perry murder was the
fourth in less than two years
that still remain unsolved at
Stanford. Leslie Perlov, a
21-year-old Stanford graduate
and Palo Alto law librarian, was
found strangled to death on Feb.
16, 1973, in the foothills behind
campus. She had been missing
since Feb. 13.
On Sept. 11, 1973, David
Levine, a senior physics major
was brutally stabbed to death
between 1 and 3 a.m on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Janet Taylor, 21, daughter of
former Stanford athletic director
Chuck Taylor, was strangled

while hitchhiking back to her La
Honda home after visiting a
friend on campus.
Investigators have never
linked any of the murders,
although officials have admitted
to certain "similarities" in the
Taylor and Perlov murders.
Bay Area media covered the
bizarre story of the Perry
murder on their front pages,
screaming out the story of a sex
slaying at Stanford. Only a week
later, the 29-year-old wife of a
Stanford employee was
abducted in her own car around
8 p m. at the intersection of Pine
Hill Road and Bowdoin Street.
Her kidnaper forced her to drive
into the foothills near Page Mill
Road, where he molested her
but did not rape her.
The two events had a
predictable effect on the
campus. The number of
students, especially women,
roaming around campus at night
dropped dramatically. Even
now, nearly a year later,
students are leery of walking
around at night alone.
Publish Or Perish?
The tired, old cliche "publish
or perish" acquired a fresh and
sinister meaning for the
University last year when several
highly respected professors were
denied tenure and subsequently
dismissed.
The popular Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, winner
of the 1972 Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching, became
a sort of cause celebre in
January for those who opposed
the way in which tenure
decisions are made here.
The University Appointments
and Promotions (A&P)
Committee became the target of
Irish's supporters' wrath. Provost
William Miller's office was
inundated with mail protesting
the decision.
Although Miller and other

officials agreed that Irish was an
excellent teacher, the
administration maintained that
Irish did not publish enough of
his own work to warrant a
tenured position at Stanford.
Irish and his supporters
claimed that the A&P
Committee had failed to
distinguish between the quantity
and the quality of his
scholarship.
The tentacles of the A&P
Committee's decisions have had
a far-reaching impact already.
Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
resigned as department chairman
last fall to protest the firing of
three professors in his
department. Yale Prof. C John
Harrington broke off plans to
accept an appointment at
Stanford upon hearing of the
committee's decision.
Asst. English Prof. Emerson
Brown and Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern had decided
by the end of last year to leave
the University, although Bern
has now decided to return to
Stanford spring quarter. And
noted Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown has cited
the tenure controversy as a
major factor in his decision to
accept a part-time appointment
at the Pacific School of Religion
in Berkeley this year.
Irish has accepted a tenured
position as head of the religious
studies department at Wichita

State University in Kansas
beginning this fall.
Minority Aid
The University last year
switched its basis for financial
aid to low- and middle-income
students from an ethnic criterion
to an economic criterion
In past years, the University
has met the financial needs of
minority students during their
freshman year. In subsequent
years, the students were
expected to provide at least
$500 in self-help.
The new policy calls for

blacks, chicanos and native
Americans to provide 80 percent
of the self-help expectation of
non-minority students.
Self-help is defined as money
provided either by a job during
the academic year or a
long-term, low interest loan, as
opposed to an outright grant.
The original proposal, drawn
up by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (C-UAFA), called
for a $700 self-help requirement
for all low- and middle-income
students, regardless of race,
during freshman year„
Amid sharp
criticism and several
demonstrations, the proposal
was modified to the current
policy.
The events of the past year
however, have managed to
alienate minority students from
the University Many remain
unconvinced, for all the
University's verbal assurances,
that Stanford's commitment to
the recruitment of minority
students has not diminished — at
least as far as the recruitment of
lower- and middle-income
minorities is concerned
Parking
Until last September,
Stanford's parking fee policy
would not have been considered
controversial. If you were a
student driver, you paid $10 a
year for the privilege of parking
on campus. Faculty and staff
parked for free.
Not all students bought
parking permits though. Some
preferred to take their chances.
With parking fines only $2 a
shot, one had to be ticketed five
times a year to make it worth it.
And that rarely happened.
But all that changed last fall
The University suspended its
parking policy until another
could be devised. Students
parked for free
But by Christmas nothing had
happened, so it was back to the
old fee policy in January.
Students were charged a
prorated fee of $7.50 for two
quarters. In the meantime, Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of studying the parking problem
and suggesting a solution.
Led by Escondido Village
Council President Cathie Colson,
students first boycotted
purchase of the parking stickers
and refused to pay the parking
fine. They then took the
University to court-
Backed by $3000 in ASSU
and Escondido Village Council
funds, Palo Alto attorney Dent
Hand was retained in an effort
to have the parking fee declared
unconstitutional.
Unfortunately, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Gallagher didn't see it the
same way. He denied the

plaintiffs a preliminary
injunction to prevent police
from citing cars without parking
stickers until the suit was
settled.
Carpenter's report was
submitted to the University
during spring break. After
modifications by the University
Committee on Land and
Building Development were
added to the recommendations,
President Lyman accepted the
new fee structure.
The new plan calls for much
higher fees next year than ever
before, in an attempt to
diminish the amount of
automobile traffic on campus.
Annual fees for faculty are $48,
$40 for staff and $32 for
off-campus students. On-campus
students will be charged $5 per
quarter.
Iranian Contract
It's been a while since the
University's research policies
were questioned. But members
of the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), Iranian Stanford
students and some sympathetic
professors managed to lead a
storm of protest here over the
University's contract with
National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT)
The $970,000 contract calls
for Assoc. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Electrical Engineering 235
students to design a
communication satellite design
for NIRT with the advice of
Communication Prof. Edwin
Parker of the Institute for
Communication Research.
Lusignan claims that the
project will benefit the people of
Iran, by improving education
and health care.
On the other hand,
opponents of the contract say
the communication system will
give even more power to the
Shah of Iran. They argue that
the University should not aid in
an already dictatorial
government
Commencement Furor
Commencement is supposed
to be that bittersweet time in
every graduate's life where one
looks fondly back on one's
undergraduate years and forward
to a bright and promising future.
But last year's graduation
ceremony held more bitterness
than anything else for the Class
of '75.
The selection in February of
former Harvard Government
Prof. and current U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as commencement
speaker started a long tirade of
protest. Some students
considered him incredibly boring
and many doubted his
scholarship, claiming Moynihan
was a racist for his advocacy in
the Nixon administration of
"benign neglect" toward the
problems of blacks in America.
But the ceremony went ahead
as scheduled on June 15.
Moynihan spoke and the
departments within Humanities

and Sciences received their
diplomas together.
Approximately 175 seniors
quietly walked out just before
Moynihan began his speech.
They returned when he finished.
Gombe Kidnaping
Last May, another tragedy
rocked the Stanford campus,
although this time the shock
waves were coming from
halfway around the world.
On May 19, three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher
were kidnaped by Marxist
guerrillas from the Gombe
Stream research center in
Tanzania, a Stanford-affiliated
facility directed by Dr. Jane
Goodall, a Stanford professor.
The four were taken across
Lake Tanganyika to Zaire, where
they were held for ransom. One
week later, Barbara Smuts, of
Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the
Stanford students, was released
by her captors, the Popular
Revolutionary Party of Zaire,
carrying ransom demands back
to Tanzanian officials.
Negotiations continued
throughout the month of June
to secure the release of the three
remaining prisoners — Carrie
Hunter, of Atherton, Calif.,
Kenneth Steven Smith, of
Garden Grove, Calif., and Emilie
Bergmann of the Netherlands.
Then on June 28, both
Hunter and Bergmann were set
free, leaving Smith as the lone
captive. Terms of the release
were not discussed with the
press, nor were negotiation plans
for the release of Smith.
Smith was released July 24
for an undisclosed ransom.
University administrators
refused to discuss the terms of
Smith's release in an effort to
protect other students and
faculty working abroad.

HOME AGAIN — Kenneth Steven Smith and Barbara Smuts hold a
press conference at Tresidder Memorial Union shortly after their
return this summer from Africa. The two Stanford students were
kidnaped along with Carrie Hunter, also a Stanford student, and
Emilie Bergmann, a Dutch research assistant, by Zaire rebels from
the Gombe Stream research center in Tanzania.
Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school is
in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
the University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the 1974-75 year: How
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Budget Blues
As the stock market declines
and prices continue to increase,
Stanford is discovering that it
does not have the money it used
to have. In 1974-75 the
University lost about $2 million
in annual income. Sharply
increased energy costs and
higher-than-expected salary rises
have combined to produce a
$10.2 million gap between
long-term income and
expenditure projections.
The $10 million has to be
slashed from the University's
budget within a three-year
period. And a lot of these
cutbacks are becoming painfully
visible to students.
Tuition is on thjp rise: next
year's bill is $3810, an increase
of $425 over 1974-75.
Innovative education will
suffer extensively. SWOPSI and
SCIRE are scheduled to be
phased out soon, as is the
Program on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program. Dean of Undergraduate

that an umbrella agency,
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPEL), absorb several

and his job. A mock funeral was
held to protest the "Death of
Undergraduate Education."
In the midst of all this
controversy, Provost William
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as of August 1976.
Housing System Changes
Back in the winter of 1974,
students living in Alpha Sigma
Phi, a coed "fraternity,"
complained of inequities in the
housing draw — as a coed house,
Alpha Sig is filled through the
draw, while all-male frats enjoy
exempt status. But the

University simply brushed off
the Alpha Sig request, never
envisioning the controversy in
which it was to become
enmeshed nine months later
With the passage of Title IX,
a section of the Federal
Education Amendments Act of
1972, which revokes any federal
funding from organizations
which discriminate on the basis
of sex, Stanford was in trouble.
For most universities, that
regulation has little to do with
their housing policies But
Stanford is not like most
universities. Since the 1940s
there have been no sororities
here, although fraternities
remain active. And all
on-campus housing, except
fraternities, is meted out by
lottery through the annual
housing draw. Hence, although
men had the option of joining a
fraternity where they were
guaranteed on-campus housing
every year they were at
Stanford, women had to be
content with taking their
chances every year with the
draw.
According to Title IX
regulations, this is considered
discriminatory And since
Stanford receives at least 10
percent of its revenues for
educational purposes from the
federal government, something
had to be done, especially in the
wake of a severe housing crunch
at Stanford.
What eventually came of the
controversy was the current
housing plan being put into
effect this fall. Beginning with
the Class of '78, every student is
guaranteed on-campus housing
three out of four years here
(including freshman year).
Students are allowed to pick
either their sophomore, junior or
senior year as the year they wish
to live off campus (going
overseas counts as off-campus if
it is during fall quarter).
For their part, the fraternities
are admitting more members
into their ranks to fulfill quotas
set by the University. The frats
have the choice of either
uncomfortably crowding their
members or of establishing
off-campus annexes.
Perry Murder
Sunday morning, Oct. 13, a
campus security guard routinely
went about unlocking Memorial
Church to prepare for worship
services. Inside, he discovered
the brutally murdered body of
Arlis Perry, 19, newlywed wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce
Perry.
Arlis had gone to pray in the
church late the night before. She
had been strangled, stabbed and
sexually molested with an altar
candle.
The Perry murder was the
fourth in less than two years
that still remain unsolved at
Stanford. Leslie Perlov, a
21-year-old Stanford graduate
and Palo Alto law librarian, was
found strangled to death on Feb.
16, 1973, in the foothills behind
campus. She had been missing
since Feb. 13.
On Sept. 11, 1973, David
Levine, a senior physics major
was brutally stabbed to death
between 1 and 3 a.m on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Janet Taylor, 21, daughter of
former Stanford athletic director
Chuck Taylor, was strangled

while hitchhiking back to her La
Honda home after visiting a
friend on campus.
Investigators have never
linked any of the murders,
although officials have admitted
to certain "similarities" in the
Taylor and Perlov murders.
Bay Area media covered the
bizarre story of the Perry
murder on their front pages,
screaming out the story of a sex
slaying at Stanford. Only a week
later, the 29-year-old wife of a
Stanford employee was
abducted in her own car around
8 p m. at the intersection of Pine
Hill Road and Bowdoin Street.
Her kidnaper forced her to drive
into the foothills near Page Mill
Road, where he molested her
but did not rape her.
The two events had a
predictable effect on the
campus. The number of
students, especially women,
roaming around campus at night
dropped dramatically. Even
now, nearly a year later,
students are leery of walking
around at night alone.
Publish Or Perish?
The tired, old cliche "publish
or perish" acquired a fresh and
sinister meaning for the
University last year when several
highly respected professors were
denied tenure and subsequently
dismissed.
The popular Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, winner
of the 1972 Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching, became
a sort of cause celebre in
January for those who opposed
the way in which tenure
decisions are made here.
The University Appointments
and Promotions (A&P)
Committee became the target of
Irish's supporters' wrath. Provost
William Miller's office was
inundated with mail protesting
the decision.
Although Miller and other

officials agreed that Irish was an
excellent teacher, the
administration maintained that
Irish did not publish enough of
his own work to warrant a
tenured position at Stanford.
Irish and his supporters
claimed that the A&P
Committee had failed to
distinguish between the quantity
and the quality of his
scholarship.
The tentacles of the A&P
Committee's decisions have had
a far-reaching impact already.
Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
resigned as department chairman
last fall to protest the firing of
three professors in his
department. Yale Prof. C John
Harrington broke off plans to
accept an appointment at
Stanford upon hearing of the
committee's decision.
Asst. English Prof. Emerson
Brown and Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern had decided
by the end of last year to leave
the University, although Bern
has now decided to return to
Stanford spring quarter. And
noted Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown has cited
the tenure controversy as a
major factor in his decision to
accept a part-time appointment
at the Pacific School of Religion
in Berkeley this year.
Irish has accepted a tenured
position as head of the religious
studies department at Wichita

State University in Kansas
beginning this fall.
Minority Aid
The University last year
switched its basis for financial
aid to low- and middle-income
students from an ethnic criterion
to an economic criterion
In past years, the University
has met the financial needs of
minority students during their
freshman year. In subsequent
years, the students were
expected to provide at least
$500 in self-help.
The new policy calls for

blacks, chicanos and native
Americans to provide 80 percent
of the self-help expectation of
non-minority students.
Self-help is defined as money
provided either by a job during
the academic year or a
long-term, low interest loan, as
opposed to an outright grant.
The original proposal, drawn
up by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (C-UAFA), called
for a $700 self-help requirement
for all low- and middle-income
students, regardless of race,
during freshman year„
Amid sharp
criticism and several
demonstrations, the proposal
was modified to the current
policy.
The events of the past year
however, have managed to
alienate minority students from
the University Many remain
unconvinced, for all the
University's verbal assurances,
that Stanford's commitment to
the recruitment of minority
students has not diminished — at
least as far as the recruitment of
lower- and middle-income
minorities is concerned
Parking
Until last September,
Stanford's parking fee policy
would not have been considered
controversial. If you were a
student driver, you paid $10 a
year for the privilege of parking
on campus. Faculty and staff
parked for free.
Not all students bought
parking permits though. Some
preferred to take their chances.
With parking fines only $2 a
shot, one had to be ticketed five
times a year to make it worth it.
And that rarely happened.
But all that changed last fall
The University suspended its
parking policy until another
could be devised. Students
parked for free
But by Christmas nothing had
happened, so it was back to the
old fee policy in January.
Students were charged a
prorated fee of $7.50 for two
quarters. In the meantime, Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of studying the parking problem
and suggesting a solution.
Led by Escondido Village
Council President Cathie Colson,
students first boycotted
purchase of the parking stickers
and refused to pay the parking
fine. They then took the
University to court-
Backed by $3000 in ASSU
and Escondido Village Council
funds, Palo Alto attorney Dent
Hand was retained in an effort
to have the parking fee declared
unconstitutional.
Unfortunately, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Gallagher didn't see it the
same way. He denied the

plaintiffs a preliminary
injunction to prevent police
from citing cars without parking
stickers until the suit was
settled.
Carpenter's report was
submitted to the University
during spring break. After
modifications by the University
Committee on Land and
Building Development were
added to the recommendations,
President Lyman accepted the
new fee structure.
The new plan calls for much
higher fees next year than ever
before, in an attempt to
diminish the amount of
automobile traffic on campus.
Annual fees for faculty are $48,
$40 for staff and $32 for
off-campus students. On-campus
students will be charged $5 per
quarter.
Iranian Contract
It's been a while since the
University's research policies
were questioned. But members
of the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), Iranian Stanford
students and some sympathetic
professors managed to lead a
storm of protest here over the
University's contract with
National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT)
The $970,000 contract calls
for Assoc. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Electrical Engineering 235
students to design a
communication satellite design
for NIRT with the advice of
Communication Prof. Edwin
Parker of the Institute for
Communication Research.
Lusignan claims that the
project will benefit the people of
Iran, by improving education
and health care.
On the other hand,
opponents of the contract say
the communication system will
give even more power to the
Shah of Iran. They argue that
the University should not aid in
an already dictatorial
government
Commencement Furor
Commencement is supposed
to be that bittersweet time in
every graduate's life where one
looks fondly back on one's
undergraduate years and forward
to a bright and promising future.
But last year's graduation
ceremony held more bitterness
than anything else for the Class
of '75.
The selection in February of
former Harvard Government
Prof. and current U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as commencement
speaker started a long tirade of
protest. Some students
considered him incredibly boring
and many doubted his
scholarship, claiming Moynihan
was a racist for his advocacy in
the Nixon administration of
"benign neglect" toward the
problems of blacks in America.
But the ceremony went ahead
as scheduled on June 15.
Moynihan spoke and the
departments within Humanities

and Sciences received their
diplomas together.
Approximately 175 seniors
quietly walked out just before
Moynihan began his speech.
They returned when he finished.
Gombe Kidnaping
Last May, another tragedy
rocked the Stanford campus,
although this time the shock
waves were coming from
halfway around the world.
On May 19, three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher
were kidnaped by Marxist
guerrillas from the Gombe
Stream research center in
Tanzania, a Stanford-affiliated
facility directed by Dr. Jane
Goodall, a Stanford professor.
The four were taken across
Lake Tanganyika to Zaire, where
they were held for ransom. One
week later, Barbara Smuts, of
Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the
Stanford students, was released
by her captors, the Popular
Revolutionary Party of Zaire,
carrying ransom demands back
to Tanzanian officials.
Negotiations continued
throughout the month of June
to secure the release of the three
remaining prisoners — Carrie
Hunter, of Atherton, Calif.,
Kenneth Steven Smith, of
Garden Grove, Calif., and Emilie
Bergmann of the Netherlands.
Then on June 28, both
Hunter and Bergmann were set
free, leaving Smith as the lone
captive. Terms of the release
were not discussed with the
press, nor were negotiation plans
for the release of Smith.
Smith was released July 24
for an undisclosed ransom.
University administrators
refused to discuss the terms of
Smith's release in an effort to
protect other students and
faculty working abroad.

HOME AGAIN — Kenneth Steven Smith and Barbara Smuts hold a
press conference at Tresidder Memorial Union shortly after their
return this summer from Africa. The two Stanford students were
kidnaped along with Carrie Hunter, also a Stanford student, and
Emilie Bergmann, a Dutch research assistant, by Zaire rebels from
the Gombe Stream research center in Tanzania.
Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school is
in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
the University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the 1974-75 year: How
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Budget Blues
As the stock market declines
and prices continue to increase,
Stanford is discovering that it
does not have the money it used
to have. In 1974-75 the
University lost about $2 million
in annual income. Sharply
increased energy costs and
higher-than-expected salary rises
have combined to produce a
$10.2 million gap between
long-term income and
expenditure projections.
The $10 million has to be
slashed from the University's
budget within a three-year
period. And a lot of these
cutbacks are becoming painfully
visible to students.
Tuition is on thjp rise: next
year's bill is $3810, an increase
of $425 over 1974-75.
Innovative education will
suffer extensively. SWOPSI and
SCIRE are scheduled to be
phased out soon, as is the
Program on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs suggested
that an umbrella agency,
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPEL), absorb several
innovative programs now
operating.
Gibbs came under fire for the
proposed cutbacks. Both
students and faculty accused
him of mishandling his office
and his job. A mock funeral was
held to protest the "Death of
Undergraduate Education."
In the midst of all this
controversy, Provost William
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as of August 1976.

the Alpha Sig request, never
envisioning the controversy in
which it was to become
enmeshed nine months later
With the passage of Title IX,
a section of the Federal
Education Amendments Act of
1972, which revokes any federal
funding from organizations
which discriminate on the basis
of sex, Stanford was in trouble.
For most universities, that
regulation has little to do with
their housing policies But
Stanford is not like most
universities. Since the 1940s
there have been no sororities
here, although fraternities
remain active. And all
on-campus housing, except
fraternities, is meted out by
lottery through the annual
housing draw. Hence, although
men had the option of joining a
fraternity where they were
guaranteed on-campus housing
every year they were at
Stanford, women had to be
content with taking their
chances every year with the
draw.
According to Title IX
regulations, this is considered
discriminatory And since
Stanford receives at least 10
percent of its revenues for
educational purposes from the
federal government, something
had to be done, especially in the
wake of a severe housing crunch
at Stanford.
What eventually came of the
controversy was the current
housing plan being put into
effect this fall. Beginning with
the Class of '78, every student is
guaranteed on-campus housing
three out of four years here
(including freshman year).
Students are allowed to pick
either their sophomore, junior or
senior year as the year they wish
to live off campus (going
overseas counts as off-campus if
it is during fall quarter).
For their part, the fraternities
are admitting more members
into their ranks to fulfill quotas
set by the University. The frats
have the choice of either
uncomfortably crowding their
members or of establishing
off-campus annexes.
Perry Murder
Sunday morning, Oct. 13, a
campus security guard routinely
went about unlocking Memorial
Church to prepare for worship
services. Inside, he discovered
the brutally murdered body of
Arlis Perry, 19, newlywed wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce
Perry.
Arlis had gone to pray in the
church late the night before. She
had been strangled, stabbed and
sexually molested with an altar
candle.
The Perry murder was the
fourth in less than two years
that still remain unsolved at
Stanford. Leslie Perlov, a
21-year-old Stanford graduate
and Palo Alto law librarian, was
found strangled to death on Feb.
16, 1973, in the foothills behind
campus. She had been missing
since Feb. 13.
On Sept. 11, 1973, David
Levine, a senior physics major
was brutally stabbed to death
between 1 and 3 a.m on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Janet Taylor, 21, daughter of
former Stanford athletic director
Chuck Taylor, was strangled

while hitchhiking back to her La
Honda home after visiting a
friend on campus.
Investigators have never
linked any of the murders,
although officials have admitted
to certain "similarities" in the
Taylor and Perlov murders.
Bay Area media covered the
bizarre story of the Perry
murder on their front pages,
screaming out the story of a sex
slaying at Stanford. Only a week
later, the 29-year-old wife of a
Stanford employee was
abducted in her own car around
8 p m. at the intersection of Pine
Hill Road and Bowdoin Street.
Her kidnaper forced her to drive
into the foothills near Page Mill
Road, where he molested her
but did not rape her.
The two events had a
predictable effect on the
campus. The number of
students, especially women,
roaming around campus at night
dropped dramatically. Even
now, nearly a year later,
students are leery of walking
around at night alone.
Publish Or Perish?
The tired, old cliche "publish
or perish" acquired a fresh and
sinister meaning for the
University last year when several
highly respected professors were
denied tenure and subsequently
dismissed.
The popular Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, winner
of the 1972 Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching, became
a sort of cause celebre in
January for those who opposed
the way in which tenure
decisions are made here.
The University Appointments
and Promotions (A&P)
Committee became the target of
Irish's supporters' wrath. Provost
William Miller's office was
inundated with mail protesting
the decision.
Although Miller and other

officials agreed that Irish was an
excellent teacher, the
administration maintained that
Irish did not publish enough of
his own work to warrant a
tenured position at Stanford.
Irish and his supporters
claimed that the A&P
Committee had failed to
distinguish between the quantity
and the quality of his
scholarship.
The tentacles of the A&P
Committee's decisions have had
a far-reaching impact already.
Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
resigned as department chairman
last fall to protest the firing of
three professors in his
department. Yale Prof. C John
Harrington broke off plans to
accept an appointment at
Stanford upon hearing of the
committee's decision.
Asst. English Prof. Emerson
Brown and Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern had decided
by the end of last year to leave
the University, although Bern
has now decided to return to
Stanford spring quarter. And
noted Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown has cited
the tenure controversy as a
major factor in his decision to
accept a part-time appointment
at the Pacific School of Religion
in Berkeley this year.
Irish has accepted a tenured
position as head of the religious
studies department at Wichita

State University in Kansas
beginning this fall.
Minority Aid
The University last year
switched its basis for financial
aid to low- and middle-income
students from an ethnic criterion
to an economic criterion
In past years, the University
has met the financial needs of
minority students during their
freshman year. In subsequent
years, the students were
expected to provide at least
$500 in self-help.
The new policy calls for

blacks, chicanos and native
Americans to provide 80 percent
of the self-help expectation of
non-minority students.
Self-help is defined as money
provided either by a job during
the academic year or a
long-term, low interest loan, as
opposed to an outright grant.
The original proposal, drawn
up by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (C-UAFA), called
for a $700 self-help requirement
for all low- and middle-income
students, regardless of race,
during freshman year„
Amid sharp
criticism and several
demonstrations, the proposal
was modified to the current
policy.
The events of the past year
however, have managed to
alienate minority students from
the University Many remain
unconvinced, for all the
University's verbal assurances,
that Stanford's commitment to
the recruitment of minority
students has not diminished — at
least as far as the recruitment of
lower- and middle-income
minorities is concerned
Parking
Until last September,
Stanford's parking fee policy
would not have been considered
controversial. If you were a
student driver, you paid $10 a
year for the privilege of parking
on campus. Faculty and staff
parked for free.
Not all students bought
parking permits though. Some
preferred to take their chances.
With parking fines only $2 a
shot, one had to be ticketed five
times a year to make it worth it.
And that rarely happened.
But all that changed last fall
The University suspended its
parking policy until another
could be devised. Students
parked for free
But by Christmas nothing had
happened, so it was back to the
old fee policy in January.
Students were charged a
prorated fee of $7.50 for two
quarters. In the meantime, Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of studying the parking problem
and suggesting a solution.
Led by Escondido Village
Council President Cathie Colson,
students first boycotted
purchase of the parking stickers
and refused to pay the parking
fine. They then took the
University to court-
Backed by $3000 in ASSU
and Escondido Village Council
funds, Palo Alto attorney Dent
Hand was retained in an effort
to have the parking fee declared
unconstitutional.
Unfortunately, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Gallagher didn't see it the
same way. He denied the

plaintiffs a preliminary
injunction to prevent police
from citing cars without parking
stickers until the suit was
settled.
Carpenter's report was
submitted to the University
during spring break. After
modifications by the University
Committee on Land and
Building Development were
added to the recommendations,
President Lyman accepted the
new fee structure.
The new plan calls for much
higher fees next year than ever
before, in an attempt to
diminish the amount of
automobile traffic on campus.
Annual fees for faculty are $48,
$40 for staff and $32 for
off-campus students. On-campus
students will be charged $5 per
quarter.
Iranian Contract
It's been a while since the
University's research policies
were questioned. But members
of the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), Iranian Stanford
students and some sympathetic
professors managed to lead a
storm of protest here over the
University's contract with
National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT)
The $970,000 contract calls
for Assoc. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Electrical Engineering 235
students to design a
communication satellite design
for NIRT with the advice of
Communication Prof. Edwin
Parker of the Institute for
Communication Research.
Lusignan claims that the
project will benefit the people of
Iran, by improving education
and health care.
On the other hand,
opponents of the contract say
the communication system will
give even more power to the
Shah of Iran. They argue that
the University should not aid in
an already dictatorial
government
Commencement Furor
Commencement is supposed
to be that bittersweet time in
every graduate's life where one
looks fondly back on one's
undergraduate years and forward
to a bright and promising future.
But last year's graduation
ceremony held more bitterness
than anything else for the Class
of '75.
The selection in February of
former Harvard Government
Prof. and current U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as commencement
speaker started a long tirade of
protest. Some students
considered him incredibly boring
and many doubted his
scholarship, claiming Moynihan
was a racist for his advocacy in
the Nixon administration of
"benign neglect" toward the
problems of blacks in America.
But the ceremony went ahead
as scheduled on June 15.
Moynihan spoke and the
departments within Humanities

and Sciences received their
diplomas together.
Approximately 175 seniors
quietly walked out just before
Moynihan began his speech.
They returned when he finished.
Gombe Kidnaping
Last May, another tragedy
rocked the Stanford campus,
although this time the shock
waves were coming from
halfway around the world.
On May 19, three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher
were kidnaped by Marxist
guerrillas from the Gombe
Stream research center in
Tanzania, a Stanford-affiliated
facility directed by Dr. Jane
Goodall, a Stanford professor.
The four were taken across
Lake Tanganyika to Zaire, where
they were held for ransom. One
week later, Barbara Smuts, of
Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the
Stanford students, was released
by her captors, the Popular
Revolutionary Party of Zaire,
carrying ransom demands back
to Tanzanian officials.
Negotiations continued
throughout the month of June
to secure the release of the three
remaining prisoners — Carrie
Hunter, of Atherton, Calif.,
Kenneth Steven Smith, of
Garden Grove, Calif., and Emilie
Bergmann of the Netherlands.
Then on June 28, both
Hunter and Bergmann were set
free, leaving Smith as the lone
captive. Terms of the release
were not discussed with the
press, nor were negotiation plans
for the release of Smith.
Smith was released July 24
for an undisclosed ransom.
University administrators
refused to discuss the terms of
Smith's release in an effort to
protect other students and
faculty working abroad.

HOME AGAIN — Kenneth Steven Smith and Barbara Smuts hold a
press conference at Tresidder Memorial Union shortly after their
return this summer from Africa. The two Stanford students were
kidnaped along with Carrie Hunter, also a Stanford student, and
Emilie Bergmann, a Dutch research assistant, by Zaire rebels from
the Gombe Stream research center in Tanzania.
Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school is
in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
the University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the 1974-75 year: How
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Budget Blues
As the stock market declines
and prices continue to increase,
Stanford is discovering that it
does not have the money it used
to have. In 1974-75 the
University lost about $2 million
in annual income. Sharply
increased energy costs and
higher-than-expected salary rises
have combined to produce a
$10.2 million gap between
long-term income and
expenditure projections.
The $10 million has to be
slashed from the University's
budget within a three-year
period. And a lot of these
cutbacks are becoming painfully
visible to students.
Tuition is on thjp rise: next
year's bill is $3810, an increase
of $425 over 1974-75.
Innovative education will
suffer extensively. SWOPSI and
SCIRE are scheduled to be
phased out soon, as is the
Program on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs suggested
that an umbrella agency,
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPEL), absorb several
innovative programs now
operating.
Gibbs came under fire for the
proposed cutbacks. Both
students and faculty accused
him of mishandling his office
and his job. A mock funeral was
held to protest the "Death of
Undergraduate Education."
In the midst of all this
controversy, Provost William
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as of August 1976.
Housing System Changes
Back in the winter of 1974,
students living in Alpha Sigma
Phi, a coed "fraternity,"
complained of inequities in the
housing draw — as a coed house,
Alpha Sig is filled through the
draw, while all-male frats enjoy
exempt status. But the

University simply brushed off
the Alpha Sig request, never
envisioning the controversy in
which it was to become
enmeshed nine months later
With the passage of Title IX,
a section of the Federal
Education Amendments Act of
1972, which revokes any federal
funding from organizations
which discriminate on the basis

on-campus housing, except
fraternities, is meted out by
lottery through the annual
housing draw. Hence, although
men had the option of joining a
fraternity where they were
guaranteed on-campus housing
every year they were at
Stanford, women had to be
content with taking their
chances every year with the
draw.
According to Title IX
regulations, this is considered
discriminatory And since
Stanford receives at least 10
percent of its revenues for
educational purposes from the
federal government, something
had to be done, especially in the
wake of a severe housing crunch
at Stanford.
What eventually came of the
controversy was the current
housing plan being put into
effect this fall. Beginning with
the Class of '78, every student is
guaranteed on-campus housing
three out of four years here
(including freshman year).
Students are allowed to pick
either their sophomore, junior or
senior year as the year they wish
to live off campus (going
overseas counts as off-campus if
it is during fall quarter).
For their part, the fraternities
are admitting more members
into their ranks to fulfill quotas
set by the University. The frats
have the choice of either
uncomfortably crowding their
members or of establishing
off-campus annexes.
Perry Murder
Sunday morning, Oct. 13, a
campus security guard routinely
went about unlocking Memorial
Church to prepare for worship
services. Inside, he discovered
the brutally murdered body of
Arlis Perry, 19, newlywed wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce
Perry.
Arlis had gone to pray in the
church late the night before. She
had been strangled, stabbed and
sexually molested with an altar
candle.
The Perry murder was the
fourth in less than two years
that still remain unsolved at
Stanford. Leslie Perlov, a
21-year-old Stanford graduate
and Palo Alto law librarian, was
found strangled to death on Feb.
16, 1973, in the foothills behind
campus. She had been missing
since Feb. 13.
On Sept. 11, 1973, David
Levine, a senior physics major
was brutally stabbed to death
between 1 and 3 a.m on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Janet Taylor, 21, daughter of
former Stanford athletic director
Chuck Taylor, was strangled

while hitchhiking back to her La
Honda home after visiting a
friend on campus.
Investigators have never
linked any of the murders,
although officials have admitted
to certain "similarities" in the
Taylor and Perlov murders.
Bay Area media covered the
bizarre story of the Perry
murder on their front pages,
screaming out the story of a sex
slaying at Stanford. Only a week
later, the 29-year-old wife of a
Stanford employee was
abducted in her own car around
8 p m. at the intersection of Pine
Hill Road and Bowdoin Street.
Her kidnaper forced her to drive
into the foothills near Page Mill
Road, where he molested her
but did not rape her.
The two events had a
predictable effect on the
campus. The number of
students, especially women,
roaming around campus at night
dropped dramatically. Even
now, nearly a year later,
students are leery of walking
around at night alone.
Publish Or Perish?
The tired, old cliche "publish
or perish" acquired a fresh and
sinister meaning for the
University last year when several
highly respected professors were
denied tenure and subsequently
dismissed.
The popular Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, winner
of the 1972 Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching, became
a sort of cause celebre in
January for those who opposed
the way in which tenure
decisions are made here.
The University Appointments
and Promotions (A&P)
Committee became the target of
Irish's supporters' wrath. Provost
William Miller's office was
inundated with mail protesting
the decision.
Although Miller and other

officials agreed that Irish was an
excellent teacher, the
administration maintained that
Irish did not publish enough of
his own work to warrant a
tenured position at Stanford.
Irish and his supporters
claimed that the A&P
Committee had failed to
distinguish between the quantity
and the quality of his
scholarship.
The tentacles of the A&P
Committee's decisions have had
a far-reaching impact already.
Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
resigned as department chairman
last fall to protest the firing of
three professors in his
department. Yale Prof. C John
Harrington broke off plans to
accept an appointment at
Stanford upon hearing of the
committee's decision.
Asst. English Prof. Emerson
Brown and Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern had decided
by the end of last year to leave
the University, although Bern
has now decided to return to
Stanford spring quarter. And
noted Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown has cited
the tenure controversy as a
major factor in his decision to
accept a part-time appointment
at the Pacific School of Religion
in Berkeley this year.
Irish has accepted a tenured
position as head of the religious
studies department at Wichita

State University in Kansas
beginning this fall.
Minority Aid
The University last year
switched its basis for financial
aid to low- and middle-income
students from an ethnic criterion
to an economic criterion
In past years, the University
has met the financial needs of
minority students during their
freshman year. In subsequent
years, the students were
expected to provide at least
$500 in self-help.
The new policy calls for

blacks, chicanos and native
Americans to provide 80 percent
of the self-help expectation of
non-minority students.
Self-help is defined as money
provided either by a job during
the academic year or a
long-term, low interest loan, as
opposed to an outright grant.
The original proposal, drawn
up by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (C-UAFA), called
for a $700 self-help requirement
for all low- and middle-income
students, regardless of race,
during freshman year„
Amid sharp
criticism and several
demonstrations, the proposal
was modified to the current
policy.
The events of the past year
however, have managed to
alienate minority students from
the University Many remain
unconvinced, for all the
University's verbal assurances,
that Stanford's commitment to
the recruitment of minority
students has not diminished — at
least as far as the recruitment of
lower- and middle-income
minorities is concerned
Parking
Until last September,
Stanford's parking fee policy
would not have been considered
controversial. If you were a
student driver, you paid $10 a
year for the privilege of parking
on campus. Faculty and staff
parked for free.
Not all students bought
parking permits though. Some
preferred to take their chances.
With parking fines only $2 a
shot, one had to be ticketed five
times a year to make it worth it.
And that rarely happened.
But all that changed last fall
The University suspended its
parking policy until another
could be devised. Students
parked for free
But by Christmas nothing had
happened, so it was back to the
old fee policy in January.
Students were charged a
prorated fee of $7.50 for two
quarters. In the meantime, Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of studying the parking problem
and suggesting a solution.
Led by Escondido Village
Council President Cathie Colson,
students first boycotted
purchase of the parking stickers
and refused to pay the parking
fine. They then took the
University to court-
Backed by $3000 in ASSU
and Escondido Village Council
funds, Palo Alto attorney Dent
Hand was retained in an effort
to have the parking fee declared
unconstitutional.
Unfortunately, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Gallagher didn't see it the
same way. He denied the

plaintiffs a preliminary
injunction to prevent police
from citing cars without parking
stickers until the suit was
settled.
Carpenter's report was
submitted to the University
during spring break. After
modifications by the University
Committee on Land and
Building Development were
added to the recommendations,
President Lyman accepted the
new fee structure.
The new plan calls for much
higher fees next year than ever
before, in an attempt to
diminish the amount of
automobile traffic on campus.
Annual fees for faculty are $48,
$40 for staff and $32 for
off-campus students. On-campus
students will be charged $5 per
quarter.
Iranian Contract
It's been a while since the
University's research policies
were questioned. But members
of the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), Iranian Stanford
students and some sympathetic
professors managed to lead a
storm of protest here over the
University's contract with
National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT)
The $970,000 contract calls
for Assoc. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Electrical Engineering 235
students to design a
communication satellite design
for NIRT with the advice of
Communication Prof. Edwin
Parker of the Institute for
Communication Research.
Lusignan claims that the
project will benefit the people of
Iran, by improving education
and health care.
On the other hand,
opponents of the contract say
the communication system will
give even more power to the
Shah of Iran. They argue that
the University should not aid in
an already dictatorial
government
Commencement Furor
Commencement is supposed
to be that bittersweet time in
every graduate's life where one
looks fondly back on one's
undergraduate years and forward
to a bright and promising future.
But last year's graduation
ceremony held more bitterness
than anything else for the Class
of '75.
The selection in February of
former Harvard Government
Prof. and current U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as commencement
speaker started a long tirade of
protest. Some students
considered him incredibly boring
and many doubted his
scholarship, claiming Moynihan
was a racist for his advocacy in
the Nixon administration of
"benign neglect" toward the
problems of blacks in America.
But the ceremony went ahead
as scheduled on June 15.
Moynihan spoke and the
departments within Humanities

and Sciences received their
diplomas together.
Approximately 175 seniors
quietly walked out just before
Moynihan began his speech.
They returned when he finished.
Gombe Kidnaping
Last May, another tragedy
rocked the Stanford campus,
although this time the shock
waves were coming from
halfway around the world.
On May 19, three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher
were kidnaped by Marxist
guerrillas from the Gombe
Stream research center in
Tanzania, a Stanford-affiliated
facility directed by Dr. Jane
Goodall, a Stanford professor.
The four were taken across
Lake Tanganyika to Zaire, where
they were held for ransom. One
week later, Barbara Smuts, of
Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the
Stanford students, was released
by her captors, the Popular
Revolutionary Party of Zaire,
carrying ransom demands back
to Tanzanian officials.
Negotiations continued
throughout the month of June
to secure the release of the three
remaining prisoners — Carrie
Hunter, of Atherton, Calif.,
Kenneth Steven Smith, of
Garden Grove, Calif., and Emilie
Bergmann of the Netherlands.
Then on June 28, both
Hunter and Bergmann were set
free, leaving Smith as the lone
captive. Terms of the release
were not discussed with the
press, nor were negotiation plans
for the release of Smith.
Smith was released July 24
for an undisclosed ransom.
University administrators
refused to discuss the terms of
Smith's release in an effort to
protect other students and
faculty working abroad.

HOME AGAIN — Kenneth Steven Smith and Barbara Smuts hold a
press conference at Tresidder Memorial Union shortly after their
return this summer from Africa. The two Stanford students were
kidnaped along with Carrie Hunter, also a Stanford student, and
Emilie Bergmann, a Dutch research assistant, by Zaire rebels from
the Gombe Stream research center in Tanzania.
Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school is
in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
the University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the 1974-75 year: How
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Budget Blues
As the stock market declines
and prices continue to increase,
Stanford is discovering that it
does not have the money it used
to have. In 1974-75 the
University lost about $2 million
in annual income. Sharply
increased energy costs and
higher-than-expected salary rises
have combined to produce a
$10.2 million gap between
long-term income and
expenditure projections.
The $10 million has to be
slashed from the University's
budget within a three-year
period. And a lot of these
cutbacks are becoming painfully
visible to students.
Tuition is on thjp rise: next
year's bill is $3810, an increase
of $425 over 1974-75.
Innovative education will
suffer extensively. SWOPSI and
SCIRE are scheduled to be
phased out soon, as is the
Program on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs suggested
that an umbrella agency,
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPEL), absorb several
innovative programs now
operating.
Gibbs came under fire for the
proposed cutbacks. Both
students and faculty accused
him of mishandling his office
and his job. A mock funeral was
held to protest the "Death of
Undergraduate Education."
In the midst of all this
controversy, Provost William
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as of August 1976.
Housing System Changes
Back in the winter of 1974,
students living in Alpha Sigma
Phi, a coed "fraternity,"
complained of inequities in the
housing draw — as a coed house,
Alpha Sig is filled through the
draw, while all-male frats enjoy
exempt status. But the

University simply brushed off
the Alpha Sig request, never
envisioning the controversy in
which it was to become
enmeshed nine months later
With the passage of Title IX,
a section of the Federal
Education Amendments Act of
1972, which revokes any federal
funding from organizations
which discriminate on the basis
of sex, Stanford was in trouble.
For most universities, that
regulation has little to do with
their housing policies But
Stanford is not like most
universities. Since the 1940s
there have been no sororities
here, although fraternities
remain active. And all
on-campus housing, except
fraternities, is meted out by
lottery through the annual
housing draw. Hence, although
men had the option of joining a
fraternity where they were
guaranteed on-campus housing
every year they were at

at Stanford.
What eventually came of the
controversy was the current
housing plan being put into
effect this fall. Beginning with
the Class of '78, every student is
guaranteed on-campus housing
three out of four years here
(including freshman year).
Students are allowed to pick
either their sophomore, junior or
senior year as the year they wish
to live off campus (going
overseas counts as off-campus if
it is during fall quarter).
For their part, the fraternities
are admitting more members
into their ranks to fulfill quotas
set by the University. The frats
have the choice of either
uncomfortably crowding their
members or of establishing
off-campus annexes.
Perry Murder
Sunday morning, Oct. 13, a
campus security guard routinely
went about unlocking Memorial
Church to prepare for worship
services. Inside, he discovered
the brutally murdered body of
Arlis Perry, 19, newlywed wife
of Stanford sophomore Bruce
Perry.
Arlis had gone to pray in the
church late the night before. She
had been strangled, stabbed and
sexually molested with an altar
candle.
The Perry murder was the
fourth in less than two years
that still remain unsolved at
Stanford. Leslie Perlov, a
21-year-old Stanford graduate
and Palo Alto law librarian, was
found strangled to death on Feb.
16, 1973, in the foothills behind
campus. She had been missing
since Feb. 13.
On Sept. 11, 1973, David
Levine, a senior physics major
was brutally stabbed to death
between 1 and 3 a.m on a
walkway just east of Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
Janet Taylor, 21, daughter of
former Stanford athletic director
Chuck Taylor, was strangled

while hitchhiking back to her La
Honda home after visiting a
friend on campus.
Investigators have never
linked any of the murders,
although officials have admitted
to certain "similarities" in the
Taylor and Perlov murders.
Bay Area media covered the
bizarre story of the Perry
murder on their front pages,
screaming out the story of a sex
slaying at Stanford. Only a week
later, the 29-year-old wife of a
Stanford employee was
abducted in her own car around
8 p m. at the intersection of Pine
Hill Road and Bowdoin Street.
Her kidnaper forced her to drive
into the foothills near Page Mill
Road, where he molested her
but did not rape her.
The two events had a
predictable effect on the
campus. The number of
students, especially women,
roaming around campus at night
dropped dramatically. Even
now, nearly a year later,
students are leery of walking
around at night alone.
Publish Or Perish?
The tired, old cliche "publish
or perish" acquired a fresh and
sinister meaning for the
University last year when several
highly respected professors were
denied tenure and subsequently
dismissed.
The popular Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish, winner
of the 1972 Gores Award for
Excellence in Teaching, became
a sort of cause celebre in
January for those who opposed
the way in which tenure
decisions are made here.
The University Appointments
and Promotions (A&P)
Committee became the target of
Irish's supporters' wrath. Provost
William Miller's office was
inundated with mail protesting
the decision.
Although Miller and other

officials agreed that Irish was an
excellent teacher, the
administration maintained that
Irish did not publish enough of
his own work to warrant a
tenured position at Stanford.
Irish and his supporters
claimed that the A&P
Committee had failed to
distinguish between the quantity
and the quality of his
scholarship.
The tentacles of the A&P
Committee's decisions have had
a far-reaching impact already.
Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
resigned as department chairman
last fall to protest the firing of
three professors in his
department. Yale Prof. C John
Harrington broke off plans to
accept an appointment at
Stanford upon hearing of the
committee's decision.
Asst. English Prof. Emerson
Brown and Asst. Psychology
Prof. Sandra Bern had decided
by the end of last year to leave
the University, although Bern
has now decided to return to
Stanford spring quarter. And
noted Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown has cited
the tenure controversy as a
major factor in his decision to
accept a part-time appointment
at the Pacific School of Religion
in Berkeley this year.
Irish has accepted a tenured
position as head of the religious
studies department at Wichita

State University in Kansas
beginning this fall.
Minority Aid
The University last year
switched its basis for financial
aid to low- and middle-income
students from an ethnic criterion
to an economic criterion
In past years, the University
has met the financial needs of
minority students during their
freshman year. In subsequent
years, the students were
expected to provide at least
$500 in self-help.
The new policy calls for

blacks, chicanos and native
Americans to provide 80 percent
of the self-help expectation of
non-minority students.
Self-help is defined as money
provided either by a job during
the academic year or a
long-term, low interest loan, as
opposed to an outright grant.
The original proposal, drawn
up by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (C-UAFA), called
for a $700 self-help requirement
for all low- and middle-income
students, regardless of race,
during freshman year„
Amid sharp
criticism and several
demonstrations, the proposal
was modified to the current
policy.
The events of the past year
however, have managed to
alienate minority students from
the University Many remain
unconvinced, for all the
University's verbal assurances,
that Stanford's commitment to
the recruitment of minority
students has not diminished — at
least as far as the recruitment of
lower- and middle-income
minorities is concerned
Parking
Until last September,
Stanford's parking fee policy
would not have been considered
controversial. If you were a
student driver, you paid $10 a
year for the privilege of parking
on campus. Faculty and staff
parked for free.
Not all students bought
parking permits though. Some
preferred to take their chances.
With parking fines only $2 a
shot, one had to be ticketed five
times a year to make it worth it.
And that rarely happened.
But all that changed last fall
The University suspended its
parking policy until another
could be devised. Students
parked for free
But by Christmas nothing had
happened, so it was back to the
old fee policy in January.
Students were charged a
prorated fee of $7.50 for two
quarters. In the meantime, Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of studying the parking problem
and suggesting a solution.
Led by Escondido Village
Council President Cathie Colson,
students first boycotted
purchase of the parking stickers
and refused to pay the parking
fine. They then took the
University to court-
Backed by $3000 in ASSU
and Escondido Village Council
funds, Palo Alto attorney Dent
Hand was retained in an effort
to have the parking fee declared
unconstitutional.
Unfortunately, Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Paul Gallagher didn't see it the
same way. He denied the

plaintiffs a preliminary
injunction to prevent police
from citing cars without parking
stickers until the suit was
settled.
Carpenter's report was
submitted to the University
during spring break. After
modifications by the University
Committee on Land and
Building Development were
added to the recommendations,
President Lyman accepted the
new fee structure.
The new plan calls for much
higher fees next year than ever
before, in an attempt to
diminish the amount of
automobile traffic on campus.
Annual fees for faculty are $48,
$40 for staff and $32 for
off-campus students. On-campus
students will be charged $5 per
quarter.
Iranian Contract
It's been a while since the
University's research policies
were questioned. But members
of the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC), Iranian Stanford
students and some sympathetic
professors managed to lead a
storm of protest here over the
University's contract with
National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT)
The $970,000 contract calls
for Assoc. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Electrical Engineering 235
students to design a
communication satellite design
for NIRT with the advice of
Communication Prof. Edwin
Parker of the Institute for
Communication Research.
Lusignan claims that the
project will benefit the people of
Iran, by improving education
and health care.
On the other hand,
opponents of the contract say
the communication system will
give even more power to the
Shah of Iran. They argue that
the University should not aid in
an already dictatorial
government
Commencement Furor
Commencement is supposed
to be that bittersweet time in
every graduate's life where one
looks fondly back on one's
undergraduate years and forward
to a bright and promising future.
But last year's graduation
ceremony held more bitterness
than anything else for the Class
of '75.
The selection in February of
former Harvard Government
Prof. and current U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as commencement
speaker started a long tirade of
protest. Some students
considered him incredibly boring
and many doubted his
scholarship, claiming Moynihan
was a racist for his advocacy in
the Nixon administration of
"benign neglect" toward the
problems of blacks in America.
But the ceremony went ahead
as scheduled on June 15.
Moynihan spoke and the
departments within Humanities

and Sciences received their
diplomas together.
Approximately 175 seniors
quietly walked out just before
Moynihan began his speech.
They returned when he finished.
Gombe Kidnaping
Last May, another tragedy
rocked the Stanford campus,
although this time the shock
waves were coming from
halfway around the world.
On May 19, three Stanford
students and a Dutch researcher
were kidnaped by Marxist
guerrillas from the Gombe
Stream research center in
Tanzania, a Stanford-affiliated
facility directed by Dr. Jane
Goodall, a Stanford professor.
The four were taken across
Lake Tanganyika to Zaire, where
they were held for ransom. One
week later, Barbara Smuts, of
Ann Arbor, Mich., one of the
Stanford students, was released
by her captors, the Popular
Revolutionary Party of Zaire,
carrying ransom demands back
to Tanzanian officials.
Negotiations continued
throughout the month of June
to secure the release of the three
remaining prisoners — Carrie
Hunter, of Atherton, Calif.,
Kenneth Steven Smith, of
Garden Grove, Calif., and Emilie
Bergmann of the Netherlands.
Then on June 28, both
Hunter and Bergmann were set
free, leaving Smith as the lone
captive. Terms of the release
were not discussed with the
press, nor were negotiation plans
for the release of Smith.
Smith was released July 24
for an undisclosed ransom.
University administrators
refused to discuss the terms of
Smith's release in an effort to
protect other students and
faculty working abroad.

HOME AGAIN — Kenneth Steven Smith and Barbara Smuts hold a
press conference at Tresidder Memorial Union shortly after their
return this summer from Africa. The two Stanford students were
kidnaped along with Carrie Hunter, also a Stanford student, and
Emilie Bergmann, a Dutch research assistant, by Zaire rebels from
the Gombe Stream research center in Tanzania.
Stanford continues to change
each year for students, faculty
and administrators. The school is
in a process of evolving — as
each event takes place, it pulls
the University in one direction,
until something else happens to
upset the balance again.
Herewith is a summary of the
events of the 1974-75 year: How
they affected the campus and
may continue to do so for some
time.
Budget Blues
As the stock market declines
and prices continue to increase,
Stanford is discovering that it
does not have the money it used
to have. In 1974-75 the
University lost about $2 million
in annual income. Sharply
increased energy costs and
higher-than-expected salary rises
have combined to produce a
$10.2 million gap between
long-term income and
expenditure projections.
The $10 million has to be
slashed from the University's
budget within a three-year
period. And a lot of these
cutbacks are becoming painfully
visible to students.
Tuition is on thjp rise: next
year's bill is $3810, an increase
of $425 over 1974-75.
Innovative education will
suffer extensively. SWOPSI and
SCIRE are scheduled to be
phased out soon, as is the
Program on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs suggested
that an umbrella agency,
Undergraduate Special Agency
(UNGRASPEL), absorb several
innovative programs now
operating.
Gibbs came under fire for the
proposed cutbacks. Both
students and faculty accused
him of mishandling his office
and his job. A mock funeral was
held to protest the "Death of
Undergraduate Education."
In the midst of all this
controversy, Provost William
Miller announced that Gibbs had
asked to be relieved of his duties
as of August 1976.
Housing System Changes
Back in the winter of 1974,
students living in Alpha Sigma
Phi, a coed "fraternity,"
complained of inequities in the
housing draw — as a coed house,
Alpha Sig is filled through the
draw, while all-male frats enjoy
exempt status. But the

University simply brushed off
the Alpha Sig request, never
envisioning the controversy in
which it was to become
enmeshed nine months later
With the passage of Title IX,
a section of the Federal
Education Amendments Act of
1972, which revokes any federal
funding from organizations
which discriminate on the basis
of sex, Stanford was in trouble.
For most universities, that
regulation has little to do with
their housing policies But
Stanford is not like most
universities. Since the 1940s
there have been no sororities
here, although fraternities
remain active. And all
on-campus housing, except
fraternities, is meted out by
lottery through the annual
housing draw. Hence, although
men had the option of joining a
fraternity where they were
guaranteed on-campus housing
every year they were at
Stanford, women had to be
content with taking their
chances every year with the
draw.
According to Title IX
regulations, this is considered
discriminatory And since
Stanford receives at least 10
percent of its revenues for
educational purposes from the
federal government, something
had to be done, especially in the
wake of a severe housing crunch
at Stanford.
What eventually came of the
controversy was the current
housing plan being put into
effect this fall. Beginning with
the Class of '78, every student is
guaranteed on-campus housing
three out of four years here
(including freshman year).
Students are allowed to pick
either their sophomore, junior or
senior year as the year they wish
to live off campus (going
overseas counts as off-campus if
it is during fall quarter).
For their part, the fraternities
are admitting more members
into their ranks to fulfill quotas
set by the University. The frats
have the choice of either
uncomfortably crowding their
members or of establishing
off-campus annexes.
