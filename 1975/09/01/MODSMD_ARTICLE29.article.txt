# Sackbut Or Sax—The Choice Is Yours

### MARY INGERSOLL 
Stanford's Music Department
consists of a variety of
ensembles that appeal to the
strict classicist as well as to the
fun-seeker. They all have a
common attraction in that they
offer dual entertainment
opportunities to audiences as
well as participants. And they all
offer academic credit.
One of the largest groups on
campus is the chorale. It will be
irected this year by
newly-appointed Dr. William
Ramsey.
Ramsey's plans for the chorus
include a bicentennial program
of early and contemporary
works, all by American
composers. And Ramsey will
keep the chorale close to its
traditions by planning more
"select" works.
Robert MacKinnon will
continue with his direction of
he glee club. He says that the
60-member group also has an
accompanying 21-piece stage
band. And out of that
60-member group comes a jazz
combo called the "Axidentals."
MacKinnon says that the
groups perform "everything
from 16th century polyphony to
soft rock and jazz." They tour
the West Coast, and this year will
go to San Diego. Their 40
performances a year are all done
in costume, and the programs
ire done from memory.
Early Music Singers
Asst. Music Prof. William
Mahrt directs the Early Music
Singers, which he says is divided
into the different sections to
perform "double choir pieces."
Choice of music ranges from the
late "15th century through the
17th century, from Dufay to
Monteverdi," he says. And styles
range from motets, masses, to
madrigals.
The group has many graduate
tudents, but Mahrt explains
Lhat "we have freshmen who
aren't music majors."
Mahrt also formerly directed
the Renaissance wind band,
which will be taken over by
music lecturer Herb Myers.
Mahrt says that the group is
composed of "six to eight
people who play Renaissance
wind music, and each person
plays a number of instruments,
which include sackbuts,racketts,
cornettos, and occasionally viola
da gambas."
The Renaissance wind band is
usually composed of music
graduates who have started with
other groups, but Mahrt says it is

open to "anyone who is able to
do it."
Symphony and Chamber Music
Asst. Music Prof. Mark Starr,
new last year to Stanford,
directs the symphony orchestra
and chamber orchestra. Jean
Duong-Van, violinist with both
groups, says they are both open
to non-majors, of which there
are "many." She adds that the
groups are "very capable, always
fun and always work."
Starr, she says, is "very
pleasant to audition for — it's
nothing pressing."
Symphony and chamber
orchestra concert schedules for
fall quarter have already been
arranged. The symphony will
perform the music of Copland,
Mozart, Bartok and Schumann
Dec. 5, and the chamber
orchestra will perform the music
of Handel, Brahms and Barber
Nov. 23.
Another chamber music
program is organized by cello
teacher Bonnie Hampton. Music
Administrative Asst. John
Planting says that Hampton
divides the players into several
groups, which are then taken
over by other music faculty. The
groups perform for the

University as do all other music
groups.
Contemporary Music
Mike Andrews will be the
new director of Alea 11, a group
devoted to the performance of
contemporary music. It is open
to anyone interested and able to
play, though mostly majors join.
Adjunct Music Prof. Art
Barnes directs the wind
ensemble, and heads all bands,
which include the studio band,
brass choir and the marching
band.
Barnes says that the wind
ensemble is the "best group
on campus." The brass choir is
composed of "trumpets, etc.,"
and meets twice weekly. The
studio band is run by music
graduate Pat Sperling, and is
similar to a jazz band. Its
performances are "casual but
scheduled," says Barnes.
LSJUMB
The student-organized Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB)
Barnes affectionately calls a
"zoo band." The marching band
follows the football games, and
basketball games, plays at rallies
and concerts. It is managed by
Bill Wick, and Barnes says there

are some spaces available for
new students. Usually the band
organizes a week before school
starts for a "band camp."
One band member says that
"auditions depend on what you
play and what is needed." He
adds that it is very informal, but
he recommends that students get
to the band shack, located across
from the athletic department, as

soon as they arrive on campus,
in order to audition. "If you
don't make it in the fall, try
spring," he says.
He adds that band rehearsals
are very time-consuming,
especially before a game.
All groups will have audition
time and place schedules posted
at the Knoll and Music Annex,
and various places on campus.

late "15th century through the
17th century, from Dufay to
Monteverdi," he says. And styles
range from motets, masses, to
madrigals.
The group has many graduate
tudents, but Mahrt explains
Lhat "we have freshmen who
aren't music majors."
Mahrt also formerly directed
the Renaissance wind band,
which will be taken over by
music lecturer Herb Myers.
Mahrt says that the group is
composed of "six to eight
people who play Renaissance
wind music, and each person
plays a number of instruments,
which include sackbuts,racketts,
cornettos, and occasionally viola
da gambas."
The Renaissance wind band is
usually composed of music
graduates who have started with
other groups, but Mahrt says it is

open to "anyone who is able to
do it."
Symphony and Chamber Music
Asst. Music Prof. Mark Starr,
new last year to Stanford,
directs the symphony orchestra
and chamber orchestra. Jean
Duong-Van, violinist with both
groups, says they are both open
to non-majors, of which there
are "many." She adds that the
groups are "very capable, always
fun and always work."
Starr, she says, is "very
pleasant to audition for — it's
nothing pressing."
Symphony and chamber
orchestra concert schedules for
fall quarter have already been
arranged. The symphony will
perform the music of Copland,
Mozart, Bartok and Schumann
Dec. 5, and the chamber
orchestra will perform the music
of Handel, Brahms and Barber
Nov. 23.
Another chamber music
program is organized by cello
teacher Bonnie Hampton. Music
Administrative Asst. John
Planting says that Hampton
divides the players into several
groups, which are then taken
over by other music faculty. The
groups perform for the

University as do all other music
groups.
Contemporary Music
Mike Andrews will be the
new director of Alea 11, a group
devoted to the performance of
contemporary music. It is open
to anyone interested and able to
play, though mostly majors join.
Adjunct Music Prof. Art
Barnes directs the wind
ensemble, and heads all bands,
which include the studio band,
brass choir and the marching
band.
Barnes says that the wind
ensemble is the "best group
on campus." The brass choir is
composed of "trumpets, etc.,"
and meets twice weekly. The
studio band is run by music
graduate Pat Sperling, and is
similar to a jazz band. Its
performances are "casual but
scheduled," says Barnes.
LSJUMB
The student-organized Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB)
Barnes affectionately calls a
"zoo band." The marching band
follows the football games, and
basketball games, plays at rallies
and concerts. It is managed by
Bill Wick, and Barnes says there

are some spaces available for
new students. Usually the band
organizes a week before school
starts for a "band camp."
One band member says that
"auditions depend on what you
play and what is needed." He
adds that it is very informal, but
he recommends that students get
to the band shack, located across
from the athletic department, as

soon as they arrive on campus,
in order to audition. "If you
don't make it in the fall, try
spring," he says.
He adds that band rehearsals
are very time-consuming,
especially before a game.
All groups will have audition
time and place schedules posted
at the Knoll and Music Annex,
and various places on campus.
Stanford's Music Department
consists of a variety of
ensembles that appeal to the
strict classicist as well as to the
fun-seeker. They all have a
common attraction in that they
offer dual entertainment
opportunities to audiences as
well as participants. And they all
offer academic credit.
One of the largest groups on
campus is the chorale. It will be
irected this year by
newly-appointed Dr. William
Ramsey.
Ramsey's plans for the chorus
include a bicentennial program
of early and contemporary
works, all by American
composers. And Ramsey will
keep the chorale close to its
traditions by planning more
"select" works.
Robert MacKinnon will
continue with his direction of
he glee club. He says that the
60-member group also has an
accompanying 21-piece stage
band. And out of that
60-member group comes a jazz
combo called the "Axidentals."
MacKinnon says that the
groups perform "everything
from 16th century polyphony to
soft rock and jazz." They tour
the West Coast, and this year will
go to San Diego. Their 40
performances a year are all done
in costume, and the programs
ire done from memory.

Dec. 5, and the chamber
orchestra will perform the music
of Handel, Brahms and Barber
Nov. 23.
Another chamber music
program is organized by cello
teacher Bonnie Hampton. Music
Administrative Asst. John
Planting says that Hampton
divides the players into several
groups, which are then taken
over by other music faculty. The
groups perform for the

University as do all other music
groups.
Contemporary Music
Mike Andrews will be the
new director of Alea 11, a group
devoted to the performance of
contemporary music. It is open
to anyone interested and able to
play, though mostly majors join.
Adjunct Music Prof. Art
Barnes directs the wind
ensemble, and heads all bands,
which include the studio band,
brass choir and the marching
band.
Barnes says that the wind
ensemble is the "best group
on campus." The brass choir is
composed of "trumpets, etc.,"
and meets twice weekly. The
studio band is run by music
graduate Pat Sperling, and is
similar to a jazz band. Its
performances are "casual but
scheduled," says Barnes.
LSJUMB
The student-organized Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB)
Barnes affectionately calls a
"zoo band." The marching band
follows the football games, and
basketball games, plays at rallies
and concerts. It is managed by
Bill Wick, and Barnes says there

are some spaces available for
new students. Usually the band
organizes a week before school
starts for a "band camp."
One band member says that
"auditions depend on what you
play and what is needed." He
adds that it is very informal, but
he recommends that students get
to the band shack, located across
from the athletic department, as

soon as they arrive on campus,
in order to audition. "If you
don't make it in the fall, try
spring," he says.
He adds that band rehearsals
are very time-consuming,
especially before a game.
All groups will have audition
time and place schedules posted
at the Knoll and Music Annex,
and various places on campus.
Stanford's Music Department
consists of a variety of
ensembles that appeal to the
strict classicist as well as to the
fun-seeker. They all have a
common attraction in that they
offer dual entertainment
opportunities to audiences as
well as participants. And they all
offer academic credit.
One of the largest groups on
campus is the chorale. It will be
irected this year by
newly-appointed Dr. William
Ramsey.
Ramsey's plans for the chorus
include a bicentennial program
of early and contemporary
works, all by American
composers. And Ramsey will
keep the chorale close to its
traditions by planning more
"select" works.
Robert MacKinnon will
continue with his direction of
he glee club. He says that the
60-member group also has an
accompanying 21-piece stage
band. And out of that
60-member group comes a jazz
combo called the "Axidentals."
MacKinnon says that the
groups perform "everything
from 16th century polyphony to
soft rock and jazz." They tour
the West Coast, and this year will
go to San Diego. Their 40
performances a year are all done
in costume, and the programs
ire done from memory.
Early Music Singers
Asst. Music Prof. William
Mahrt directs the Early Music
Singers, which he says is divided
into the different sections to
perform "double choir pieces."
Choice of music ranges from the
late "15th century through the
17th century, from Dufay to
Monteverdi," he says. And styles
range from motets, masses, to
madrigals.
The group has many graduate
tudents, but Mahrt explains
Lhat "we have freshmen who
aren't music majors."
Mahrt also formerly directed
the Renaissance wind band,
which will be taken over by
music lecturer Herb Myers.
Mahrt says that the group is
composed of "six to eight
people who play Renaissance
wind music, and each person
plays a number of instruments,
which include sackbuts,racketts,
cornettos, and occasionally viola
da gambas."
The Renaissance wind band is
usually composed of music
graduates who have started with
other groups, but Mahrt says it is

open to "anyone who is able to
do it."
Symphony and Chamber Music
Asst. Music Prof. Mark Starr,
new last year to Stanford,
directs the symphony orchestra
and chamber orchestra. Jean
Duong-Van, violinist with both
groups, says they are both open
to non-majors, of which there
are "many." She adds that the
groups are "very capable, always
fun and always work."
Starr, she says, is "very
pleasant to audition for — it's
nothing pressing."
Symphony and chamber
orchestra concert schedules for
fall quarter have already been
arranged. The symphony will
perform the music of Copland,
Mozart, Bartok and Schumann
Dec. 5, and the chamber
orchestra will perform the music
of Handel, Brahms and Barber
Nov. 23.
