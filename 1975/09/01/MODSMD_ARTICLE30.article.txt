# Freshman Choir
## 
### 
The Music Department has
announced that its annual
freshman choir will rehearse
at 10 a.m. Sunday morning,
Sept. 28, in the basement of
Memorial Church. The
performance will take place
during the church service at
11 a.m.
Leonard Rummery, music
TA and assistant conductor
of the chorus, says that the
freshman choir is held only
once a year, before classes
begin, "to welcome and
congratulate the entering
freshmen."
Rummery says that any
freshman is welcome and

urged to attend. There are no
auditions for the choir â€”
anyone is welcome to show
up at the church for rehearsal
and performance.
Vaughn William's "Now
Let Us Piaise Famous Men "
has been tentatively chosen
for the program.
The choir will be
conducted by recently
appointed Dr. William
Ramsey.
Freshmen interested in
auditioning for other musical
organizations may do so at
the posted times during
registration week.
