# Choral Director Appointed
## 
### 
William Ramsey has been appointed as an associate
professor of choral music, the Music Department has
announced.
Ramsey will succeed Prof. Harold C. Schmidt, who recently
retired from the department after 28 years.
He will conduct the freshman choir during registration
week, will teach general undergraduate music classes and also
more specialized classes for majors.
Ramsey was formerly a professor of music at Utah State
University at Logan. Previous to his professorship there, he
was assistant professor of music and chairman of Kentucky
Southern College's Department of Music.
He did undergraduate work at Columbia, and for graduate
work attended the School of Sacred Music at the Union
Theological Seminary', where he was a choral and vocal major.
At the age of 26, in 1963, he received his doctorate from
Columbia University.
Ramsey has studied with many famous choral conductors,
including Robert Shaw, Roger Wagner, Luigi Ricci and Renata
Heredia, and has performed with Leonard Bernstein and Paul
Hindemith.
Ramsey says that he was "very excited to come here — any
change of position causes a bit of anxiety," but he adds that
he left a secure position at Utah "because of Stanford."
"I had no problems accepting [Stanford]," he says.
He is particularly excited about the possibilities of
combining work with the church and Music Department — "a
unique situation on campus," he says."The church is a vital
part of this community."
Ramsey is married and has three children. In his private life
he enjoys macrame, cooking — Italian is his specialty —
backpacking, and "four-wheeling."
