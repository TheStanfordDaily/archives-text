# Sunday Flicks: Movies Are Only Half The Fun
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
Now that you're here, you
should know of our traditions.
One as time-honored as the
Academy Awards is the Sunday
Night flicks, sponsored by
ASSU. This ritual has occurred
every Sunday since 1937 (except
for some World War II years),

making it as old as Robert
Redford. Stanford students,
along with an assortment of Palo
Alto high school students, go
into Memorial Auditorium,
across from Hoover Tower, and
pretend to watch the movie.
Often it is no more than an
excuse to leave one's studying

for a few hours, and it always
refreshes, making one ready to
return to the books — or
Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi's,
Too Pizza Parlor, depending on
how infectious the atmosphere is
and who you run into.
The Flicks, as they are
affectionately referred to,

were the brainchild of Oley
Killingsworth, who still works
here as the communications
supervisor in the Plant Services
Department. fie remembers
some very interesting facts about
the first years of the Flicks,
which should raise some
eyebrows, even among seniors.
Did you know .. . that the
Flicks were originally shown in
the History Corner for a dime?
They are now 75 cents, up from
50 cents last year.
... that when enough money
had been collected for the rental
of the quarter's films, admission
wasn't charged? Today the
Flicks are an extremely
profitable institution upon
which ASSU depends for a hefty
chunk of revenue.
... that there wasn't the
choice or variety that we have
now? In the so-called 'good old
days,' there were many repeats
of the films which were easiest
to get, as well as serials. Those
were the days of block-booking,
when if an organization rented
one Paramount film, it rented
only Paramount films. Thus
many independent films were
shown, according to
Killingsworth.
Difficulties
There were often difficulties
with the Fox Theatre in
downtown Palo Alto (which the
Flicks have outlived). The
managers detested the thought
of lost revenue — after all. the
Flicks were 15 cents less than
the Fox in those days. They made
it impossible for ASSU to get a

film unless a certain period of
time had elapsed since its
engagement at the Fox.
Today, however, we have
anything and everything we
want — almost. On Dec. 9,
1973, X-rated Behind The Green
Door was the scheduled film.
Someone in the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's
office frowned on the idea of
pure Stanford students being
subjected to such filthy and
immoral degradation up there on
the screen and threatened to
arrest the projectionist and
confiscate the film.
The film was one of the 10
most popular on a survey list of
45 films, and the Flicks manager
at that time, Bob Sisson, said he
"would like to show the film
just because of the great
demand for it. But I'll be in
finals that week and I don't
want to be a test case."
So. instead of fighting legal
battles, Sisson replaced the
controversial film with Easy
Rider.
Most of the time, though, the
dramatics are on the screen.
Nevertheless, something happens
to 1500 people left to their own
devices for two hours in the
dark. A mysterious spell enters
and overcomes.
Aerodynamics Experts
Everyone is allowed to be the
aerodv namics expert they
dreamed of being as children, or
the witty comedian from MAD
Magazine inserting unlikely
comments at unlikely times
during the movie. The Flicks are

a time away from the books and
from the entire academic
structure, where, since it is dark
and your identity is safe, anyone
can do — and does — strange
things.
During the sock-hop scene in
American Graffiti, a group of
dancers in 1962 garb climbed
onto the stage and danced,
making it the first
three-dimensional movie in
years.
During Ali MacGraw's death
scene in Love Story — the
perfect movie for the Flicks,
according to Sisson, someone in
the balcony took out a violin
and began playing appropriately
tear-jerking music.
When Ryan O'Neal started
crying in the same movie,
someone else grabbed a mop,
went on stage, and tried to wipe
away his tears.
For Easy Rider, no sooner
had Dennis Hopper and Peter
Fonda roared onto the screen
than three cyclists tore in one
side of Memorial Auditorium
and out the other.
One-upmanship
And of course, the Flicks
wouldn't be the Flicks without
the aforementioned
paper-airplane regattas. The
planes take off from the balcony
and hopefully land on the stage.
More often than not, though,
they nosedive and crash in the
tenth row, usually in some
unsuspecting person's eye.
Applause greets any airplane
that makes it to the stage, and
sighs of disappointment meet

those that crash along the way.
One-upmanship is not
unknown here. Not to he
outdone by the upper classmen,
some freshmen attempted to sail
an inflated toy 747 down to the
stage. It worked almost as well
as the DC-10s.
If a movie is good, it will be
met with rapt attention.
Occasionally some enterprising
person, bored with the affair,
will attempt a wisecrack at
which no one will laugh, and
said person will retreat into
silence with embarrassment,
content with the knowledge that
his identity is unknown.
However, when a movie is
bad, boring, or otherwise
untenable, don't expect to hear
any of it, which is just as well.
The wisecracks from the wits in
the audience are often more
entertaining.
The Flicks will very likely be
here long after we are all gone —
traditions have a habit of doing
things like that. It is a
momentarily stunning idea to
think that our children and
grandchildren will be sitting in
Memorial Auditorium years
from now watching movies with
superstars who aren't yet gleams
in their fathers' eyes.
However, that won't come to
mind when Paul Newman shoots
Robert Redford, or when Jack
Nicholson slaps Faye Dunaway.
That is the intent of the Flicks,
and movies in general - to, for a
few hours, take our minds off
our past, our present, and our
future. They succeed.


FLICK FANS — The Sundav Night Flicks, a University tradition, are as old as Robert Redford. For
75 cents and a Stanford 1.D., you can watch some of the best of Hollywood — or fly paper airplanes,
or whatever else suits vour fancy.

had Dennis Hopper and Peter
Fonda roared onto the screen
than three cyclists tore in one
side of Memorial Auditorium
and out the other.
One-upmanship
And of course, the Flicks
wouldn't be the Flicks without
the aforementioned
paper-airplane regattas. The
planes take off from the balcony
and hopefully land on the stage.
More often than not, though,
they nosedive and crash in the
tenth row, usually in some
unsuspecting person's eye.
Applause greets any airplane
that makes it to the stage, and
sighs of disappointment meet

those that crash along the way.
One-upmanship is not
unknown here. Not to he
outdone by the upper classmen,
some freshmen attempted to sail
an inflated toy 747 down to the
stage. It worked almost as well
as the DC-10s.
If a movie is good, it will be
met with rapt attention.
Occasionally some enterprising
person, bored with the affair,
will attempt a wisecrack at
which no one will laugh, and
said person will retreat into
silence with embarrassment,
content with the knowledge that
his identity is unknown.
However, when a movie is
bad, boring, or otherwise
untenable, don't expect to hear
any of it, which is just as well.
The wisecracks from the wits in
the audience are often more
entertaining.
The Flicks will very likely be
here long after we are all gone —
traditions have a habit of doing
things like that. It is a
momentarily stunning idea to
think that our children and
grandchildren will be sitting in
Memorial Auditorium years
from now watching movies with
superstars who aren't yet gleams
in their fathers' eyes.
However, that won't come to
mind when Paul Newman shoots
Robert Redford, or when Jack
Nicholson slaps Faye Dunaway.
That is the intent of the Flicks,
and movies in general - to, for a
few hours, take our minds off
our past, our present, and our
future. They succeed.


FLICK FANS — The Sundav Night Flicks, a University tradition, are as old as Robert Redford. For
75 cents and a Stanford 1.D., you can watch some of the best of Hollywood — or fly paper airplanes,
or whatever else suits vour fancy.
Now that you're here, you
should know of our traditions.
One as time-honored as the
Academy Awards is the Sunday
Night flicks, sponsored by
ASSU. This ritual has occurred
every Sunday since 1937 (except
for some World War II years),

making it as old as Robert
Redford. Stanford students,
along with an assortment of Palo
Alto high school students, go
into Memorial Auditorium,
across from Hoover Tower, and
pretend to watch the movie.
Often it is no more than an
excuse to leave one's studying

for a few hours, and it always
refreshes, making one ready to
return to the books — or
Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi's,
Too Pizza Parlor, depending on
how infectious the atmosphere is
and who you run into.
The Flicks, as they are
affectionately referred to,

were the brainchild of Oley
Killingsworth, who still works
here as the communications
supervisor in the Plant Services
Department. fie remembers
some very interesting facts about
the first years of the Flicks,
which should raise some
eyebrows, even among seniors.
Did you know .. . that the
Flicks were originally shown in
the History Corner for a dime?
They are now 75 cents, up from
50 cents last year.
... that when enough money
had been collected for the rental
of the quarter's films, admission
wasn't charged? Today the
Flicks are an extremely
profitable institution upon
which ASSU depends for a hefty
chunk of revenue.
... that there wasn't the
choice or variety that we have
now? In the so-called 'good old
days,' there were many repeats
of the films which were easiest
to get, as well as serials. Those
were the days of block-booking,
when if an organization rented
one Paramount film, it rented
only Paramount films. Thus
many independent films were
shown, according to
Killingsworth.
Difficulties
There were often difficulties
with the Fox Theatre in
downtown Palo Alto (which the
Flicks have outlived). The
managers detested the thought
of lost revenue — after all. the
Flicks were 15 cents less than
the Fox in those days. They made
it impossible for ASSU to get a

film unless a certain period of
time had elapsed since its
engagement at the Fox.
Today, however, we have
anything and everything we
want — almost. On Dec. 9,
1973, X-rated Behind The Green
Door was the scheduled film.
Someone in the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's
office frowned on the idea of
pure Stanford students being
subjected to such filthy and
immoral degradation up there on
the screen and threatened to
arrest the projectionist and
confiscate the film.
The film was one of the 10
most popular on a survey list of
45 films, and the Flicks manager
at that time, Bob Sisson, said he
"would like to show the film
just because of the great
demand for it. But I'll be in
finals that week and I don't
want to be a test case."
So. instead of fighting legal
battles, Sisson replaced the
controversial film with Easy
Rider.
Most of the time, though, the
dramatics are on the screen.
Nevertheless, something happens
to 1500 people left to their own
devices for two hours in the
dark. A mysterious spell enters
and overcomes.
Aerodynamics Experts
Everyone is allowed to be the
aerodv namics expert they
dreamed of being as children, or
the witty comedian from MAD
Magazine inserting unlikely
comments at unlikely times
during the movie. The Flicks are

a time away from the books and
from the entire academic
structure, where, since it is dark
and your identity is safe, anyone
can do — and does — strange
things.
During the sock-hop scene in
American Graffiti, a group of
dancers in 1962 garb climbed
onto the stage and danced,
making it the first
three-dimensional movie in
years.
During Ali MacGraw's death
scene in Love Story — the
perfect movie for the Flicks,
according to Sisson, someone in
the balcony took out a violin
and began playing appropriately
tear-jerking music.
When Ryan O'Neal started
crying in the same movie,
someone else grabbed a mop,
went on stage, and tried to wipe
away his tears.
For Easy Rider, no sooner
had Dennis Hopper and Peter
Fonda roared onto the screen
than three cyclists tore in one
side of Memorial Auditorium
and out the other.

film unless a certain period of
time had elapsed since its
engagement at the Fox.
Today, however, we have
anything and everything we
want — almost. On Dec. 9,
1973, X-rated Behind The Green
Door was the scheduled film.
Someone in the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's
office frowned on the idea of
pure Stanford students being
subjected to such filthy and
immoral degradation up there on
the screen and threatened to
arrest the projectionist and
confiscate the film.
The film was one of the 10
most popular on a survey list of
45 films, and the Flicks manager
at that time, Bob Sisson, said he
"would like to show the film
just because of the great
demand for it. But I'll be in
finals that week and I don't
want to be a test case."
So. instead of fighting legal
battles, Sisson replaced the
controversial film with Easy
Rider.
Most of the time, though, the
dramatics are on the screen.
Nevertheless, something happens
to 1500 people left to their own
devices for two hours in the
dark. A mysterious spell enters
and overcomes.
Aerodynamics Experts
Everyone is allowed to be the
aerodv namics expert they
dreamed of being as children, or
the witty comedian from MAD
Magazine inserting unlikely
comments at unlikely times
during the movie. The Flicks are

a time away from the books and
from the entire academic
structure, where, since it is dark
and your identity is safe, anyone
can do — and does — strange
things.
During the sock-hop scene in
American Graffiti, a group of
dancers in 1962 garb climbed
onto the stage and danced,
making it the first
three-dimensional movie in
years.
During Ali MacGraw's death
scene in Love Story — the
perfect movie for the Flicks,
according to Sisson, someone in
the balcony took out a violin
and began playing appropriately
tear-jerking music.
When Ryan O'Neal started
crying in the same movie,
someone else grabbed a mop,
went on stage, and tried to wipe
away his tears.
For Easy Rider, no sooner
had Dennis Hopper and Peter
Fonda roared onto the screen
than three cyclists tore in one
side of Memorial Auditorium
and out the other.
One-upmanship
And of course, the Flicks
wouldn't be the Flicks without
the aforementioned
paper-airplane regattas. The
planes take off from the balcony
and hopefully land on the stage.
More often than not, though,
they nosedive and crash in the
tenth row, usually in some
unsuspecting person's eye.
Applause greets any airplane
that makes it to the stage, and
sighs of disappointment meet

those that crash along the way.
One-upmanship is not
unknown here. Not to he
outdone by the upper classmen,
some freshmen attempted to sail
an inflated toy 747 down to the
stage. It worked almost as well
as the DC-10s.
If a movie is good, it will be
met with rapt attention.
Occasionally some enterprising
person, bored with the affair,
will attempt a wisecrack at
which no one will laugh, and
said person will retreat into
silence with embarrassment,
content with the knowledge that
his identity is unknown.
However, when a movie is
bad, boring, or otherwise
untenable, don't expect to hear
any of it, which is just as well.
The wisecracks from the wits in
the audience are often more
entertaining.
The Flicks will very likely be
here long after we are all gone —
traditions have a habit of doing
things like that. It is a
momentarily stunning idea to
think that our children and
grandchildren will be sitting in
Memorial Auditorium years
from now watching movies with
superstars who aren't yet gleams
in their fathers' eyes.
However, that won't come to
mind when Paul Newman shoots
Robert Redford, or when Jack
Nicholson slaps Faye Dunaway.
That is the intent of the Flicks,
and movies in general - to, for a
few hours, take our minds off
our past, our present, and our
future. They succeed.


FLICK FANS — The Sundav Night Flicks, a University tradition, are as old as Robert Redford. For
75 cents and a Stanford 1.D., you can watch some of the best of Hollywood — or fly paper airplanes,
or whatever else suits vour fancy.
Now that you're here, you
should know of our traditions.
One as time-honored as the
Academy Awards is the Sunday
Night flicks, sponsored by
ASSU. This ritual has occurred
every Sunday since 1937 (except
for some World War II years),

making it as old as Robert
Redford. Stanford students,
along with an assortment of Palo
Alto high school students, go
into Memorial Auditorium,
across from Hoover Tower, and
pretend to watch the movie.
Often it is no more than an
excuse to leave one's studying

for a few hours, and it always
refreshes, making one ready to
return to the books — or
Frankie, Johnny, and Luigi's,
Too Pizza Parlor, depending on
how infectious the atmosphere is
and who you run into.
The Flicks, as they are
affectionately referred to,

were the brainchild of Oley
Killingsworth, who still works
here as the communications
supervisor in the Plant Services
Department. fie remembers
some very interesting facts about
the first years of the Flicks,
which should raise some
eyebrows, even among seniors.
Did you know .. . that the
Flicks were originally shown in
the History Corner for a dime?
They are now 75 cents, up from
50 cents last year.
... that when enough money
had been collected for the rental
of the quarter's films, admission
wasn't charged? Today the
Flicks are an extremely
profitable institution upon
which ASSU depends for a hefty
chunk of revenue.
... that there wasn't the
choice or variety that we have
now? In the so-called 'good old
days,' there were many repeats
of the films which were easiest
to get, as well as serials. Those
were the days of block-booking,
when if an organization rented
one Paramount film, it rented
only Paramount films. Thus
many independent films were
shown, according to
Killingsworth.
Difficulties
There were often difficulties
with the Fox Theatre in
downtown Palo Alto (which the
Flicks have outlived). The
managers detested the thought
of lost revenue — after all. the
Flicks were 15 cents less than
the Fox in those days. They made
it impossible for ASSU to get a

film unless a certain period of
time had elapsed since its
engagement at the Fox.
