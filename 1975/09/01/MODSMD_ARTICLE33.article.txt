# Frost Amphitheater Has Recently Endured Rocky Times
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
With all the places a freshman
must learn to locate, Frost
Memorial Amphitheater could
easily get overlooked in the first
hectic days. First, it's not even
that easy to see, because it was
designed, nearly 40 years ago, to
blend in with the natural
features of the campus.
Second, classes aren't held
there, and commencement,
which does take place there, is
four years away. So what is the
importance of Frost to the
freshman, and where is it
anyway?
Frost Amphitheater is one of
the finest places in the Bay Area
for the presentation of outdoor
events, which in 1975 translates
into a ready-made arena for rock
concerts.
However, the whole music
explosion was something that
was completely unforeseen by
Mr. and Mrs. Howard Frost of
Los Angeles, who donated the
then magnificent sum of
$90,000 in 1936 to construct
the Amphitheater. The structure
is named for their son,
Lawrence, who died in 1935, his
senior year at Stanford.
The money was donated,
along with another $25,000 for
a student loan fund, and
construction was begun in 1936.
By June 1937, Frost was
completed, in time for that
year's commencement exercises.
Frost Today
Today, as then, Frost sits
behind Memorial Auditorium
and the Graduate School of
Business, looking from the

outside like a wooded hill. But
that was the intent of Leslie
Kiler, a landscape architect and
Stanford grad, who designed the
amphitheater.
Kiler wanted to "enrich the
area with a permanent
inspirational atmosphere," and
to that end he spent over
$35,000 for trees of all varieties,
and $40,000 to move 93,000
cubic yards of earth to make the
natural slope that can seat from
eight to 10,000, depending upon
how close together people sit.
Other noteworthy statistics,
which have been forgotten with
the passage of time are the over
one ton of grass seed that it took
to seed the seating area, the 400
cubic yards of mushroom
manure that was combined with
the seed to give the grass a good
healthy start, and the 600 cubic
yards of fresh cow manure that
was added to the many varieties
of trees as they were set out.
Stanford didn't have to buy
cow flop on the open market
eithei, for according to a 1940
news clipping, foothill dairies on
University property provided all
the organic fertilizer needed.
Outdoor Events
But aside from the derivation
of the ground that rock fans and
graduates sit on, just what does
go on in Frost?
Over the years, Frost has
been the scene of many outdoor
events that used to be Stanford
traditions, like the Spring Sing
and on the other end of the
spectrum, rallies and benefits for
various anti-war causes that
proliferated in the late 1960s

and early 19705.
Lately, though, it's been
mostly rock concerts. Although
music has been presented before,
today's offerings are a far cry
from the torchlight concert in
1942, which featured the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra
playing selections from Debussy,
Tschaikovsky and Liszt.
Technically, Frost could be
used for nothing but graduation,
because ever since the summer
of 1970 a "ban" on rock events
has been in effect.
A spokesman in the Office of
Public Events said, however, that
the ban has been modified quite
a bit over the last two years. In
fact, this summer's Eric Clapton
concert was the most successful
outdoor event ever sponsored by
ASSU Special Events, according
to Handy Phillips, special events
chairman.
Top Names
The success of the Clapton
concert, which grossed $60,000,
has insured that more top name
rock acts will be appearing this
fall, Phillips stated. Two dates
already set for outdoor
extravaganzes are Oct. 5 and
Oct. 19, but the groups
appearing haven't been signed at
press time, and so, cannot be
announced.
All the above would be
impossible if the so-called ban
had not been considerably
modified since its institution in
1970. The Office of Special
Events gave three reasons for the
modification of policy: 1) times
have changed — both audiences
and bands; 2) there have been no

serious incidents since rock
music was permitted back in
Frost; 3) the administration,
through the Office of Public
Events, has kept a close if
unobtrusive watch on the types
of groups scheduled into the
amphitheater.
In 1975, then, incoming frosh
can look forward to many
afternoons of rock music capped
off with a graduation four years
or so later. Although it might
not be quite the same now as it
was in 1939, a Stanford

brochure produced that year
summed up the spirit of Frost
Amphitheater as follows:
"Such is the inheritance from
Mr. and Mrs. Howard Frost
which awaits each student who
enters Stanford, and which
dignifies his daily work and will
enrich his latter memories, not
with cultural acquisitions alone,
but with a sentiment and idea
worthy of an educated life." Or
in the parlance of 1975, "Let's
boogie."

CAPS AND GOWNS — Stanford student careers culminate in Frost Amphitheater — but before that,
most students visit Frost for speeches or concerts.

fall attractions. Baez is a local resident.
