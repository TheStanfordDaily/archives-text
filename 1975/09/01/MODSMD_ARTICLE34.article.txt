# Rock: Where To Go
## 
### 
By MICHELE FARRAR
The San Francisco Bay Area
offers a wide variety of places to
listen to good rock music.
Probably the most famous of
these is Bill Graham's
Winterland, located at Post and
Steiner streets in San Francisco.
The most popular rock
groups play at Winterland on the
weekends for $5.50 in advance
at BASS ticket outlets (the most
local outlets are Bullock's at the
Stanford Shopping Center or
Pacific Stereo in Mountain
View) or $6 at the door.
Minors are welcome, and
everyone is searched for bottles
and cans only when passing
through the door.
When packed to absolute
capacity, Winterland can hold up
to 6000 people. Seats line the
sides, back, and upstairs of the
auditorium, but the vast floor
facing the stage is left open for
those who wish to stand. Shows
usually begin at 8 p.m., and the
doors open at 7 p.m.
Oakland Coliseum
The Oakland Coliseum on
Hegenberger Road (off Highway
17) seats about 15,000 people
for rock concerts.
Tickets are usually priced
from $4.50 to $6.50 unless
well-known groups like Led
Zeppelin or Elton John are
performing, when ticket prices
can hit $10. Even the cheapest
seats provide a decent view of
the stage, and the acoustics are
good.
The Cow Palace, located at
Geneva Avenue (off Highway
101) in South San Francisco is
similar to Winterland in its
seating and standing
arrangements, but holds about
10,000 people.
Ticket prices are similar to
the Oakland Coliseum. However,
one's view of the stage from the
inexpensive seats is not as good
here as in the Oakland Coliseum,

the acoustics are inferior, and
the ventilation for those
standing on the floor is
inadequate.
San Jose
The San Jose Center for the
Performing Arts, located at 180
West San Carlos in San Jose, is a
new, ultra-modern theater which
seats about 4000 people. The
seats are comfortable, and the
acoustics are excellent.
The Berkeley Community
Theater at Austin Way and
Grove in Berkeley is similar to
the San Jose Center, but is
slightly older and less plush.
Parking is difficult.
