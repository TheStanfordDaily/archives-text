# City Has Top Jazz Clubs
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
New York has a score of them, Los Angeles
hardly even one, but San Francisco has at least
two good places to hear first-rate jazz almost any
night of any week.
Monday nights the two clubs are usually quiet,
but any other time the Keystone Korner on
Vallejo (near Broadway) and the Great American
Music Hall on O'Farrell feature big names and
good acoustics. And several other City nightclubs
— notably EI Matador, the Orphanage and the
Boarding House — often feature jazz as well.
All these clubs welcome minors (in California,
of course, a minor is anyone under 21), although
at the Keystone those under 21 will have to buy a
$1 coke or apple juice per set. But it's
almost always worth it to hear what the clubs
have to offer.
The Great American, a long hall decorated in
pseudo-Louis XIV style with huge mirrors, marble
pillars and thick red carpet, offers popular jazz
and folk musicians on short — usually one- or
two-night—stands. An early arrival at the club can
get you excellent seats: the closest tables are
almost on top of the stage.
On Top
For those who want to be literally on top, the
club has a balcony. It's probably the only
comparable balcony in the Bay Area, but it still
should be avoided. The floor tables are the best
place to capture the full force of jazz-rockers like
Larry Coryell, Freddie Hubbard and Airto, all of
whom regularly haul their banks of amplifiers
into the Great American.
In jazz, the Great American's promoter's tastes
run to the popular at the expense of
experimenters. That means such diverse but
strong performers as Jean-Luc Ponty, Dizzy
Gillespie, Stanley Turrentine and Oregon, and
also such dubious propositions as Carmen Mcßae
and a whole stream of easy-listening guitarists.
The Great American has country groups, folk
musicians, some soul acts and, about once a
month, Jerry Garcia's current band, for which no
minors are allowed. Shows start at 9 p.m., and
sometimes the club is cleared for the second set,
which starts at 11:30. Popular acts like Van
Morrison or Cobham sell out quickly here;
advance tickets are available from BASS outlets.
Best For Jazz
The Keystone is certainly one of the best
places in the world to hear jazz, and they feature
only jazz. Low ceilings and a very small seating
capacity make it seem as though you're sitting
right on stage. The sound system is sometimes

erratic, but the music almost never is, and such
decor as a huge eye (or is it a sun?) painted
behind the stage and a fine collage of jazz photos
on the bathroom wall provides the necessary
diversion.
Keystone first sets are good; the second sets
are usually spectacular and sometimes last until
two in the morning. The music generally starts
about 10, with a break at about 11:30. But some
shows start on time, and the club is generally
packed, so it's best to get their around 9 for good
seats.
The performers generally make the club, and
the Keystone's mainstays are musicians like
McCoy Tyner (his latest album is recorded there),
Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Miles Davis, Bobby
Hutcherson, Jack DeJohnette and Grover
Washington. Most performers stay for at least a
week, with Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays
sometimes reserved for lesser-known (but
excellent) groups and short visits by people like
Sam Rivers. A must for jazz fans.
El Matador on Broadway books more
night-clubby acts, going in for torch singers and
performers like Milt Jackson and Jimmy Smith.
Minors are welcome. The Boarding House, one of
the Bay Area's best places to see pop and rock
performers (recent visitors: Bob Marley and the
Wailers, the Tubes, Leo Sayer, Barry Manilow and
Melissa Manchester), sometimes features jazz
performers, as does the experimental
rock-oriented Orphanage.
Small Audiences
Because of the small audiences in the Bay
Area, concerts are rare for all but musicians like
John McLaughlin and Chick Corea. Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium, a beautiful concert hall,
hosted concerts by the avant-garde Art Ensemble
of Chicago and Anthony Braxton last season, but
their kind of jazz is as rare in the Bay Area as it is
anywhere except New York or Europe.
Stanford's office of Public Events often
features jazz performers on long national tours.
Performers like the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Band
and Cleo Laine provide traditional but
high-quality concerts for Stanford while they give
free clinics and government-sponsored
performances at local high schools.
Finally, local rock mogul Bill Graham will
sometimes put on a jazz concert in the good-sized
Berkeley Community Theater or San Jose Civic
Auditorium, and when he does it usually bears
watching. Last year's best featured the double bill
of Cobham and Weather Report. Graham concerts
usually sell well.
