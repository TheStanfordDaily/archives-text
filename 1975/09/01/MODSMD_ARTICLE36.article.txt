# Carol Doda's Still Hanging In There
## She Owns A Pair Of The City's Biggest Landmarks 
### STEVE HEFTER 
Three middle-aged men sit
and ogle in the front row. The
room is dark.
Busty barmaids with halter
tops and hot pants shuttle drinks
to the dozen or so spectators
and the three-piece band grinds
out some barroom striptease.
On stage, Carol Doda is
topless. Forty-four inches of the
most famous mammary glands
Mother Nature and men of
science have ever produced are
on display.
The music swells.
Carol strokes the microphone
and slowly brings it to her
glossy-red lips. "Sit back and
relax," she suggests with an
impudent wiggle in her voice,
"anddon't turn the knobs;'cause
it hurts."
Well-trained Dog
For 10 years people have
been coming to San Francisco's
Condor Club to see Carol Doda.
She was America's first topless
dancer and a decade later her

silicone-injected breasts still
perform tricks just like a
well-trained dog.
For five shows, six nights a
week, the famed twosome jerk
and jiggle and bounce in time to
the music. They sway from side
to side along the piano top and
coyly hide behind a peignoir.
After the show, ensconced
in a plush black leather chair in
the basement office of the
Condor, Carol talks about what
it was like the first night. "I felt
shy for a minute and I thought
— 'Can I really go down there
without a top on?' But then I
thought, 'I really don't know
any other way of breaking into
show business.'
"I was very naive, I was only
20 years old at the time and I
was very stupid," she laughs.
"But I just knew that I had the
incentive to do it and the
feeling, you know. I wanted to
do something."
Silicone Injections
Six months after she started

topless, Carol had silicone
injections which built her up
from 34 inches to 44 inches.
"It didn't change me as a
performer," Carol notes, "It just
enhanced the act so to speak. I
find lots of people like to look
at them."
Carol describes her act as
entertainment. "I'm an
entertainer. I'm not a stripper. I
strip in my act, but I also sing
and also dance and also talk to
the audience."
She adds with emphasis, "I
like to make people happy, and
if I can make people happy it
gives me a thrill."
"I'm very aware of what I'm
doing up there. You have to be.
A lot of it's sensual and happy
vibrations," she says smiling.
A Family Show
In recent years, Carol notes
that the show's "become a
family show. More couples,
more families and a lot of long
hairs have come here."
"At one time," she shrugs, "I
thought it was just for
businessmen."
Carol sinks low in her chair.
Her amply endowed frame is
swathed in a temporary
restraining blouse and the
cleavage is well-defined. She
shakes some platinum-blonde
hair from her face and thinks
back on how her career began.
"When I was 12 I thought I

wanted to be a showgirl," she
giggles. "I read this funny book
about Frank Sinatra, and these
showgirls were in this magazine
with him, and that impressed
me.
"I started here [the Condor]
at 17 as a cocktail waitress and
began dancing when I was 20.
But people don't know that,"
she confides, "because you're
not supposed to work in an
alcoholic place under the age of
21:"
Laurels
Today, Carol Doda enjoys the
laurels that come with hard
work. She marches in parades,
poses for nude magazines and
does station breaks and
editorials for Channel 36 in San
Jose.
Television provides Carol
with a change. "I myself don't
feel like being nude on
television," she says."I like to
be diversified. I don't want to be
nude everywhere I go and in
everything I do."
Carol smiles as she looks
ahead to the future. "I'm
preparing for big night clubs in
Las Vegas. I want to sing, dance
and tell jokes. You know, I've
taken voice lessons for eight
years," she concludes.

Though her act may offend
some women's liberationists,
Carol reacts. "I've helped
women's liberation by taking off
my clothes. I mean, they don't
wear bras any more, do they?"
She continues, "Being liberated
is being free in your own mind.
They're free to take their clothes
off.
"Everybody's an individual as
far as I'm concerned."
Rowdy Customer
Carol Doda gets up. She's got
another show in 10 minutes and
has to get ready. As she prepares
to go on stage she talks of a
problem she had the night
before with a rowdy customer.
"This guy comes on stage,"
she explains. "We have panties
on you know, and I wa c in my
act and he came up and kissed
me on my panties. Instead of
freaking out, I just looked at
him and said, 'I'm sorry I had
my pants on!' And then I — he
was really drunk — and then I
said, she rolls her voice, 'That's
what you call a half-assedjob.'"
The band strikes up and the
stage lights go out. Carol Doda
bares her breasts for the second
time this night, the 30th time
this week and about the
15,000 th time in the last 10
years.

A lot of it's sensual and happy
vibrations," she says smiling.
A Family Show
In recent years, Carol notes
that the show's "become a
family show. More couples,
more families and a lot of long
hairs have come here."
"At one time," she shrugs, "I
thought it was just for
businessmen."
Carol sinks low in her chair.
Her amply endowed frame is
swathed in a temporary
restraining blouse and the
cleavage is well-defined. She
shakes some platinum-blonde
hair from her face and thinks
back on how her career began.
"When I was 12 I thought I

wanted to be a showgirl," she
giggles. "I read this funny book
about Frank Sinatra, and these
showgirls were in this magazine
with him, and that impressed
me.
"I started here [the Condor]
at 17 as a cocktail waitress and
began dancing when I was 20.
But people don't know that,"
she confides, "because you're
not supposed to work in an
alcoholic place under the age of
21:"
Laurels
Today, Carol Doda enjoys the
laurels that come with hard
work. She marches in parades,
poses for nude magazines and
does station breaks and
editorials for Channel 36 in San
Jose.
Television provides Carol
with a change. "I myself don't
feel like being nude on
television," she says."I like to
be diversified. I don't want to be
nude everywhere I go and in
everything I do."
Carol smiles as she looks
ahead to the future. "I'm
preparing for big night clubs in
Las Vegas. I want to sing, dance
and tell jokes. You know, I've
taken voice lessons for eight
years," she concludes.

Though her act may offend
some women's liberationists,
Carol reacts. "I've helped
women's liberation by taking off
my clothes. I mean, they don't
wear bras any more, do they?"
She continues, "Being liberated
is being free in your own mind.
They're free to take their clothes
off.
"Everybody's an individual as
far as I'm concerned."
Rowdy Customer
Carol Doda gets up. She's got
another show in 10 minutes and
has to get ready. As she prepares
to go on stage she talks of a
problem she had the night
before with a rowdy customer.
"This guy comes on stage,"
she explains. "We have panties
on you know, and I wa c in my
act and he came up and kissed
me on my panties. Instead of
freaking out, I just looked at
him and said, 'I'm sorry I had
my pants on!' And then I — he
was really drunk — and then I
said, she rolls her voice, 'That's
what you call a half-assedjob.'"
The band strikes up and the
stage lights go out. Carol Doda
bares her breasts for the second
time this night, the 30th time
this week and about the
15,000 th time in the last 10
years.

Three middle-aged men sit
and ogle in the front row. The
room is dark.
Busty barmaids with halter
tops and hot pants shuttle drinks
to the dozen or so spectators
and the three-piece band grinds
out some barroom striptease.
On stage, Carol Doda is
topless. Forty-four inches of the
most famous mammary glands
Mother Nature and men of
science have ever produced are
on display.
The music swells.
Carol strokes the microphone
and slowly brings it to her
glossy-red lips. "Sit back and
relax," she suggests with an
impudent wiggle in her voice,
"anddon't turn the knobs;'cause
it hurts."
Well-trained Dog
For 10 years people have
been coming to San Francisco's
Condor Club to see Carol Doda.
She was America's first topless
dancer and a decade later her

silicone-injected breasts still
perform tricks just like a
well-trained dog.
For five shows, six nights a
week, the famed twosome jerk
and jiggle and bounce in time to
the music. They sway from side
to side along the piano top and
coyly hide behind a peignoir.
After the show, ensconced
in a plush black leather chair in
the basement office of the
Condor, Carol talks about what
it was like the first night. "I felt
shy for a minute and I thought
— 'Can I really go down there
without a top on?' But then I
thought, 'I really don't know
any other way of breaking into
show business.'
"I was very naive, I was only
20 years old at the time and I
was very stupid," she laughs.
"But I just knew that I had the
incentive to do it and the
feeling, you know. I wanted to
do something."
Silicone Injections
Six months after she started

topless, Carol had silicone
injections which built her up
from 34 inches to 44 inches.
"It didn't change me as a
performer," Carol notes, "It just
enhanced the act so to speak. I
find lots of people like to look
at them."
Carol describes her act as
entertainment. "I'm an
entertainer. I'm not a stripper. I
strip in my act, but I also sing
and also dance and also talk to
the audience."
She adds with emphasis, "I
like to make people happy, and
if I can make people happy it
gives me a thrill."

me on my panties. Instead of
freaking out, I just looked at
him and said, 'I'm sorry I had
my pants on!' And then I — he
was really drunk — and then I
said, she rolls her voice, 'That's
what you call a half-assedjob.'"
The band strikes up and the
stage lights go out. Carol Doda
bares her breasts for the second
time this night, the 30th time
this week and about the
15,000 th time in the last 10
years.

Three middle-aged men sit
and ogle in the front row. The
room is dark.
Busty barmaids with halter
tops and hot pants shuttle drinks
to the dozen or so spectators
and the three-piece band grinds
out some barroom striptease.
On stage, Carol Doda is
topless. Forty-four inches of the
most famous mammary glands
Mother Nature and men of
science have ever produced are
on display.
The music swells.
Carol strokes the microphone
and slowly brings it to her
glossy-red lips. "Sit back and
relax," she suggests with an
impudent wiggle in her voice,
"anddon't turn the knobs;'cause
it hurts."
Well-trained Dog
For 10 years people have
been coming to San Francisco's
Condor Club to see Carol Doda.
She was America's first topless
dancer and a decade later her

silicone-injected breasts still
perform tricks just like a
well-trained dog.
For five shows, six nights a
week, the famed twosome jerk
and jiggle and bounce in time to
the music. They sway from side
to side along the piano top and
coyly hide behind a peignoir.
After the show, ensconced
in a plush black leather chair in
the basement office of the
Condor, Carol talks about what
it was like the first night. "I felt
shy for a minute and I thought
— 'Can I really go down there
without a top on?' But then I
thought, 'I really don't know
any other way of breaking into
show business.'
"I was very naive, I was only
20 years old at the time and I
was very stupid," she laughs.
"But I just knew that I had the
incentive to do it and the
feeling, you know. I wanted to
do something."
Silicone Injections
Six months after she started

topless, Carol had silicone
injections which built her up
from 34 inches to 44 inches.
"It didn't change me as a
performer," Carol notes, "It just
enhanced the act so to speak. I
find lots of people like to look
at them."
Carol describes her act as
entertainment. "I'm an
entertainer. I'm not a stripper. I
strip in my act, but I also sing
and also dance and also talk to
the audience."
She adds with emphasis, "I
like to make people happy, and
if I can make people happy it
gives me a thrill."
"I'm very aware of what I'm
doing up there. You have to be.
A lot of it's sensual and happy
vibrations," she says smiling.
A Family Show
In recent years, Carol notes
that the show's "become a
family show. More couples,
more families and a lot of long
hairs have come here."
"At one time," she shrugs, "I
thought it was just for
businessmen."
Carol sinks low in her chair.
Her amply endowed frame is
swathed in a temporary
restraining blouse and the
cleavage is well-defined. She
shakes some platinum-blonde
hair from her face and thinks
back on how her career began.
"When I was 12 I thought I

wanted to be a showgirl," she
giggles. "I read this funny book
about Frank Sinatra, and these
showgirls were in this magazine
with him, and that impressed
me.
"I started here [the Condor]
at 17 as a cocktail waitress and
began dancing when I was 20.
But people don't know that,"
she confides, "because you're
not supposed to work in an
alcoholic place under the age of
21:"
Laurels
Today, Carol Doda enjoys the
laurels that come with hard
work. She marches in parades,
poses for nude magazines and
does station breaks and
editorials for Channel 36 in San
Jose.
Television provides Carol
with a change. "I myself don't
feel like being nude on
television," she says."I like to
be diversified. I don't want to be
nude everywhere I go and in
everything I do."
Carol smiles as she looks
ahead to the future. "I'm
preparing for big night clubs in
Las Vegas. I want to sing, dance
and tell jokes. You know, I've
taken voice lessons for eight
years," she concludes.

Though her act may offend
some women's liberationists,
Carol reacts. "I've helped
women's liberation by taking off
my clothes. I mean, they don't
wear bras any more, do they?"
She continues, "Being liberated
is being free in your own mind.
They're free to take their clothes
off.
"Everybody's an individual as
far as I'm concerned."
Rowdy Customer
Carol Doda gets up. She's got
another show in 10 minutes and
has to get ready. As she prepares
to go on stage she talks of a
problem she had the night
before with a rowdy customer.
"This guy comes on stage,"
she explains. "We have panties
on you know, and I wa c in my
act and he came up and kissed
me on my panties. Instead of
freaking out, I just looked at
him and said, 'I'm sorry I had
my pants on!' And then I — he
