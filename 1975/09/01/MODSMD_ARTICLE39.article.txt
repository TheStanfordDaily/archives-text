# A 						Look At Local Eateries
## 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
Palo Alto and nearby cities
are laden with restaurants, from
cheap fast food to a gourmet's
delight. The ones listed here are
in the reasonably-priced bracket
— those most likely to appeal to
a student on a limited budget.
And the food is usually good at
these establishments.
Chef Chu's is located at the
corner of El Camino and San
Antonio Road. It's often
crowded, but it offers good,
reasonably-priced Mandarin
dishes. Their specialties are
Mongolian Beef and Peking
Duck.
The Florentine Restaurant
and Pizza house, at 118 Castro
Street in Mountain View,
features New York-style pizza
and a variety of Italian food,
including eggplant parmigiana
and cannelloni. Complete
dinners include your choice of
pasta, entree, plus salad and
dessert for about $4.50.
Jose's, at 422 Cambridge
Avenue in Palo Alto, offers
Cuban-style sandwiches and
pizza. The pizza crust is superb
— like thick bread.
La Luna Mexican Cafe is
located at 1137 Chestnut (off
Santa Cruz Avenue) in Menlo
Park. What it lacks in
atmosphere is compensated for
by home-made Mexican food.
Dinner plates average around $3.
Be prepared to pay cash — they
don't accept credit cards.
La Fortuna, at 3180

Middlefield, Redwood City, has
more atmosphere than La Luna,
but has comparable food and
prices.
Maloney's is located at 888
Portola Road in Portola Valley.
It has a secluded, small dining
area. Dinners include a salad bar,
and range from $4.50 (assorted
fish plate) to $7.50 (steak and
lobster). For quality and
atmosphere, Maloney's surpasses
all other steak and salad-bar type
of restaurants in the area.
Ming's is located at 1700
Embarcadero Road in Palo Alto.
It is one of the area's most
famous Chinese restaurants. It is
large and elegant with excellent
food and service. Chinese
Chicken Salad and Ming's Beef
are especially good.
Qui Hing Low, at 134 Castro
Street in Mountain View, offers
formica tables, reasonable prices
and good Chinese food.
Saint Michael's Alley at 800
Emerson Street in Palo Alto is
small and crowded on the
weekends. It offers a variety of
dishes ranging from $4.25 to $7
(except abalone, $9.25). Dishes
include vegetable and shrimp
curry, sauteed scallops, veal
scallopini and Greek chicken.
Pan's Natural Food
Restaurant at 4191 El Camino in
Palo Alto offers medium-priced
organic food, including
vegetarian dishes, a variety of
salads and fish entrees.
The VIP Delicatessen is
located in an obscure corner of

the Embarcadero shopping
center, just before the 101
freeway on-ramps, at 2115 St.
Francis Drive in Palo Alto. VIP
offers some of the best pizza in
the area, plus good deli foods.
The Peking Restaurant, at
3691 El Camino in Palo Alto,
serves an extensive variety of
northern Chinese cuisine. A
good deal are the family dinners,
for $4 per person. But their
buffet lunches are the best deal
in town — $2 per person, and all
you can eat.
The Winery, at 2391 El
Camino and California in Palo
Alto, serves a variety of meat
and fish dishes — their specialties
are combination plates. Prices
are typical of steak houses —
$4.95 and up. The food is
excellent, and your choice of red
or white wine is complimentary
with the meal. A very popular
restaurant with Stanford
students.
The Village Cheese House, at
ten Town & Country Village
Shopping Center on El Camino,
Palo Alto, offers a wide selection
of delicatessen foods — cheese,
good cole slaw, sandwiches. The
sandwiches are a meal in
themselves, cost about $1 and
up, but often have too much
bread.
Celia's Mexican and American
Restaurant, at 423 University in
Palo Alto, has a wide selection
of Mexican dinners and a la carte
items — a typical price for a
dinner is $3.95. They also offer
steaks at $4.95 prices. The
Mexican food is gringo, but it's
good. And the service is very
fast.
