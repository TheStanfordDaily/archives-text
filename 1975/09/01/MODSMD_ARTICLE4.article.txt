## Little Leland's Lexicon Everything Students Need To Know 
### 
ACADEMIC COUNCIL - All
faculty members belong to the
Academic Council which meets
about once each quarter.
ARC — The Alliance for Radical
Change, organized by Stanford
students, is a well-known
left-wing campus group. Many of
its members live in Columbae
House, an independent
dormitory-house.
ASSU SENATE — A student
council elected by all students.
(ASSU stands for Associated
Students of Stanford
University.)
THE AXE — The symbol of
rivalry between Stanford and Cal
(UC-Berkeley). The Big Game
Axe is awarded as a trophy each
year to the winner of Big Game

the Axe from the current owner
during Big Game Week before
the game The last successful
attempt was by a Stanford
contingent in 1973.
AXE COMM — Axe Committee,
or Stanford's rally club. This

group is in charge of placing the
multi-colored stunt cards under
the stadium seats and designing
the choreography of the cards
during halftime, spelling out
messages and pictures to those
sitting on the other side.
BIG GAME — The annual
football game against arch-rival
Cal, the school across the Bay.
The schools first met in 1892,
when Stanford won, 14-0. Team
manager that year was a student
by the name of Herbert Hoover.
The Big Game has now been
played 77 times with Stanford
winning 36 games, Cal
winning 31 and 10 ties.
THE BONFIRE - The annual
pre-game celebration the night
before Big Game. The fire is
burnt in the middle of the dry
lakebed of Lake Lagunita As
the last cinders are extinguished
the student body follows the
Band up to San Francisco where
the students cavort through the
City to Union Square usually
joined by the topless dancers of
North Beach. Bonfire plans were
rained out in both 1972 and
1973, but it burned again in
1974. The Bonfire site is
guarded 24 hours a day
throughout Big Game Week due
to repeated attempts by Cal
students to start the Bonfire a
day or two ahead of time.
BUCKLEY AMENDMENT -
The Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act, sponsored by
Sen. James Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.)
is a 1974 amendment to the
Elementary and Secondary Act

of 1965, which gives students
the right to inspect their
confidential files at school. After
much controversy, the law was

confidentiality of letters of
recommendation. Now a student
may waiver his/her right to
inspect letters of
recommendation, with the
option of establishing a closed
file instead of an open one.

Academic Council. Last year, it

sporting events. They
accompany the Band at all
performances. The term "dollie"

her makeup. In these days of
liberated females, she's still more
interested in getting a marriage
license than a degree.
EL PALO ALTO - The
130-foot redwood tree, after
which the Palo Alto farm was
named. Over 500 years old, the
tree was discovered by the
