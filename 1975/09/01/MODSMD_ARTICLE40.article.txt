# Romantic Dining Spots In S.F.
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The following is a totally subjective guide to the City's
restaurants. The list is obviously incomplete but it does contain
places which I think are particularly fun for college students. Use
these restaurants as a starter but be sure to do some investigating
on your own. Uniqueness, especially in restaurants, is the essence
of San Francisco.
American
Bud's Ice Cream (Castro at 24th Street) — Even though this isn't
a restaurant (there's no place to sit down) what Bud's has to offer
is so great people are literally willing to wait hours for it. Just look
at the line sometime. What Bud's has is creamy, rich homemade ice
cream. Cones 35 to 65 cents.
The Haven (178 Geary Blvd., 65 Lick Place, 558 Sacramento
St.) — More of a lunch spot, this restaurant offers an abundance of
natural foods sandwiches from $1.35 to $2. However, their
avocado and bacon bits sandwich ($1.95) seems to be the favorite.
Try the fresh fruit juice; they squeeze it before your eyes. Hours
vary at different locations. Polk Street branch closed.
The Front Room (823 Clement St., 1500 California St., 1385
9th Ave.) — The fun spot to eat pizza. Watch old movies Monday
through Wednesday nights and indulge on Thursday; it's dime beer
night. Pizzas from $2.25 to $5.45. Also dinners and pasta. Open
seven days a week.
The Magic Pan (Ghirardelli Square-NOT one on Sutter) —
Crepe fans this is for you. You can get two crepes — spinach, crab,
shrimp to name a few — for $2.20. Get a seat by the window and
treat yourself to a view of Alcatraz and the Bay. Open seven days.
Tadich Grill (240 California St.) — Fish is the word here. Ask
for the what's fresh the day you go. Prices range from $4.50 to
$5.50. This is really an oldtime San Francisco restaurant; it's been
around since 1849. Closed Sundays. No reservations and it closes
surprisingly at 8:30 p.m. So rely on your stomach, trained by Food
Service hours, to get you there early.
Upstairs At the Cliff House (Highway 1 and Point Lobos
Avenue) — Treat yourself to one of 40 kinds of omelettes while
watching rolling waves crash on the rocks below. The salads and
omelettes ($2.75 to $5) are displayed with artistic flair. Open seven
days a week. Great for breakfast.
French
The Basque Hotel (15 Romolo Place) — A great place if you're
low on funds and hungry. Right off Broadway, this restaurant is a
perfect place to go before the symphony or A.C.T. because it's not
far from downtown. There's only one menu nightly, but you get
four or five filling courses. The night I was there they served roast
beef, clams with rice, a fresh vegetable, oily French fries, a
delicious homemade soup and an orange for dessert. Closed
Tuesday. Reservations necessary.
Le Beaujolais (2415 Clement St.) — A dark spot with only 12

tables — perfect for a romantic date. The food is good but
expensive. Specialties: veal in champagne sauce ($6.95) and rabbit
($6.75). Closed on Tuesdays.
Le Cyrano (4131 Geary Blvd.) — Not quite as intimate as Le
Beaujolais but the food is better. Also has a separate cocktail area.
Price range: $4.25 to $7.50 for a dinner. The salad and sweetbreads
are particularly tasty. Closed Sunday. Reservations imperative.
Greek
Minerva Cafe (136 Eddy St.) — A great place for dancing
Greek-style with live music. Also lessons are given Monday and
Thursday nights at 7. Price range: $4.25 to $5.25. Specialties:
Stuffed Grape Leaf with tomatoes and beef, lamb or chicken
($4.74). They serve mousaka - egg plant with ground beef for
$4.25. Open seven days a week.
Italian
Eduardo's (2234 Chestnut St.) — Don't expect much
decoration-wise, but if you want good food this is the place to
visit. There's always a long line so get there early. No reservations.
They specialize in pasta ($2.72 to $4) and veal. Entrees
($4.50-$6.50). Closed Sundays and Mondays.
La Bussola (800 Greenwich St.) — This is the place if flowers
influence your lady friend. The food — mostly veal from $3.50 to
$5 - will not make an Italian mama feel she's incompetent.
However, the decor and atmosphere are great for a quiet evening
for two. Wine bottles line the walls and music from the homeland
spills out from the low ceiling. Be prepared for a treat as you're
leaving. Make reservations on weekends. Closed Mondays.
Mexican
La Pinata (1851 Union St.) — Enjoy flautas — corn tortillas with
shredded beef and guacamole — for $2.30. Typical Mexican dishes
from enchiladas to tacos moderately priced. The building is 110
years old; it used to be a ships' chandlery. Closed Monday.
Mamounia (4411 Balboa St.) — Do you like eating with your
hands? Indulge at this fun place where waiters wash your hands
and you sit on the floor to eat your food. They specialize in lamb.
A great place for large groups but make reservations. The prices are
extravagant.
South Vietnamese
Thanh Long Vietnamese Restaurant (4101 Judah St.) — You
have not tasted crab until you try their roast crab ($6.36) cooked
in butter and herbs. It's worth the price. Closed Mondays.
Yugoslavian
Gelco's (1450 Lombard St.) — If you want to be treated like an
eastern European king, this is the place. You are catered to from
the hors d'oeuvres — which are exotic with such tidbits as squid —
to dessert. Maybe the waiter just likes younger people. Specialty:
Rack of Lamb ($9.00). They serve mostly veal from $7 to $9. Try
to be seated downstairs; it's much cozier. Closed Sundays.
Reservations necessary.

seven days a week.
The Magic Pan (Ghirardelli Square-NOT one on Sutter) —
Crepe fans this is for you. You can get two crepes — spinach, crab,
shrimp to name a few — for $2.20. Get a seat by the window and
treat yourself to a view of Alcatraz and the Bay. Open seven days.
Tadich Grill (240 California St.) — Fish is the word here. Ask
for the what's fresh the day you go. Prices range from $4.50 to
$5.50. This is really an oldtime San Francisco restaurant; it's been
around since 1849. Closed Sundays. No reservations and it closes
surprisingly at 8:30 p.m. So rely on your stomach, trained by Food
Service hours, to get you there early.
Upstairs At the Cliff House (Highway 1 and Point Lobos
Avenue) — Treat yourself to one of 40 kinds of omelettes while
watching rolling waves crash on the rocks below. The salads and
omelettes ($2.75 to $5) are displayed with artistic flair. Open seven
days a week. Great for breakfast.
French
The Basque Hotel (15 Romolo Place) — A great place if you're
low on funds and hungry. Right off Broadway, this restaurant is a
perfect place to go before the symphony or A.C.T. because it's not
far from downtown. There's only one menu nightly, but you get
four or five filling courses. The night I was there they served roast
beef, clams with rice, a fresh vegetable, oily French fries, a
delicious homemade soup and an orange for dessert. Closed
Tuesday. Reservations necessary.
Le Beaujolais (2415 Clement St.) — A dark spot with only 12

tables — perfect for a romantic date. The food is good but
expensive. Specialties: veal in champagne sauce ($6.95) and rabbit
($6.75). Closed on Tuesdays.
Le Cyrano (4131 Geary Blvd.) — Not quite as intimate as Le
Beaujolais but the food is better. Also has a separate cocktail area.
Price range: $4.25 to $7.50 for a dinner. The salad and sweetbreads
are particularly tasty. Closed Sunday. Reservations imperative.
Greek
Minerva Cafe (136 Eddy St.) — A great place for dancing
Greek-style with live music. Also lessons are given Monday and
Thursday nights at 7. Price range: $4.25 to $5.25. Specialties:
Stuffed Grape Leaf with tomatoes and beef, lamb or chicken
($4.74). They serve mousaka - egg plant with ground beef for
$4.25. Open seven days a week.
Italian
Eduardo's (2234 Chestnut St.) — Don't expect much
decoration-wise, but if you want good food this is the place to
visit. There's always a long line so get there early. No reservations.
They specialize in pasta ($2.72 to $4) and veal. Entrees
($4.50-$6.50). Closed Sundays and Mondays.
La Bussola (800 Greenwich St.) — This is the place if flowers
influence your lady friend. The food — mostly veal from $3.50 to
$5 - will not make an Italian mama feel she's incompetent.
However, the decor and atmosphere are great for a quiet evening
for two. Wine bottles line the walls and music from the homeland
spills out from the low ceiling. Be prepared for a treat as you're
leaving. Make reservations on weekends. Closed Mondays.
Mexican
La Pinata (1851 Union St.) — Enjoy flautas — corn tortillas with
shredded beef and guacamole — for $2.30. Typical Mexican dishes
from enchiladas to tacos moderately priced. The building is 110
years old; it used to be a ships' chandlery. Closed Monday.
Mamounia (4411 Balboa St.) — Do you like eating with your
hands? Indulge at this fun place where waiters wash your hands
and you sit on the floor to eat your food. They specialize in lamb.
A great place for large groups but make reservations. The prices are
extravagant.
South Vietnamese
Thanh Long Vietnamese Restaurant (4101 Judah St.) — You
have not tasted crab until you try their roast crab ($6.36) cooked
in butter and herbs. It's worth the price. Closed Mondays.
Yugoslavian
Gelco's (1450 Lombard St.) — If you want to be treated like an
eastern European king, this is the place. You are catered to from
the hors d'oeuvres — which are exotic with such tidbits as squid —
to dessert. Maybe the waiter just likes younger people. Specialty:
Rack of Lamb ($9.00). They serve mostly veal from $7 to $9. Try
to be seated downstairs; it's much cozier. Closed Sundays.
Reservations necessary.
The following is a totally subjective guide to the City's
restaurants. The list is obviously incomplete but it does contain
places which I think are particularly fun for college students. Use
these restaurants as a starter but be sure to do some investigating
on your own. Uniqueness, especially in restaurants, is the essence
of San Francisco.
American
Bud's Ice Cream (Castro at 24th Street) — Even though this isn't
a restaurant (there's no place to sit down) what Bud's has to offer
is so great people are literally willing to wait hours for it. Just look
at the line sometime. What Bud's has is creamy, rich homemade ice
cream. Cones 35 to 65 cents.
The Haven (178 Geary Blvd., 65 Lick Place, 558 Sacramento
St.) — More of a lunch spot, this restaurant offers an abundance of
natural foods sandwiches from $1.35 to $2. However, their
avocado and bacon bits sandwich ($1.95) seems to be the favorite.
Try the fresh fruit juice; they squeeze it before your eyes. Hours
vary at different locations. Polk Street branch closed.
The Front Room (823 Clement St., 1500 California St., 1385
9th Ave.) — The fun spot to eat pizza. Watch old movies Monday

far from downtown. There's only one menu nightly, but you get
four or five filling courses. The night I was there they served roast
beef, clams with rice, a fresh vegetable, oily French fries, a
delicious homemade soup and an orange for dessert. Closed
Tuesday. Reservations necessary.
Le Beaujolais (2415 Clement St.) — A dark spot with only 12

tables — perfect for a romantic date. The food is good but
expensive. Specialties: veal in champagne sauce ($6.95) and rabbit
($6.75). Closed on Tuesdays.
Le Cyrano (4131 Geary Blvd.) — Not quite as intimate as Le
Beaujolais but the food is better. Also has a separate cocktail area.
Price range: $4.25 to $7.50 for a dinner. The salad and sweetbreads
are particularly tasty. Closed Sunday. Reservations imperative.
Greek
Minerva Cafe (136 Eddy St.) — A great place for dancing
Greek-style with live music. Also lessons are given Monday and
Thursday nights at 7. Price range: $4.25 to $5.25. Specialties:
Stuffed Grape Leaf with tomatoes and beef, lamb or chicken
($4.74). They serve mousaka - egg plant with ground beef for
$4.25. Open seven days a week.
Italian
Eduardo's (2234 Chestnut St.) — Don't expect much
decoration-wise, but if you want good food this is the place to
visit. There's always a long line so get there early. No reservations.
They specialize in pasta ($2.72 to $4) and veal. Entrees
($4.50-$6.50). Closed Sundays and Mondays.
La Bussola (800 Greenwich St.) — This is the place if flowers
influence your lady friend. The food — mostly veal from $3.50 to
$5 - will not make an Italian mama feel she's incompetent.
However, the decor and atmosphere are great for a quiet evening
for two. Wine bottles line the walls and music from the homeland
spills out from the low ceiling. Be prepared for a treat as you're
leaving. Make reservations on weekends. Closed Mondays.
Mexican
La Pinata (1851 Union St.) — Enjoy flautas — corn tortillas with
shredded beef and guacamole — for $2.30. Typical Mexican dishes
from enchiladas to tacos moderately priced. The building is 110
years old; it used to be a ships' chandlery. Closed Monday.
Mamounia (4411 Balboa St.) — Do you like eating with your
hands? Indulge at this fun place where waiters wash your hands
and you sit on the floor to eat your food. They specialize in lamb.
A great place for large groups but make reservations. The prices are
extravagant.
South Vietnamese
Thanh Long Vietnamese Restaurant (4101 Judah St.) — You
have not tasted crab until you try their roast crab ($6.36) cooked
in butter and herbs. It's worth the price. Closed Mondays.
Yugoslavian
Gelco's (1450 Lombard St.) — If you want to be treated like an
eastern European king, this is the place. You are catered to from
the hors d'oeuvres — which are exotic with such tidbits as squid —
to dessert. Maybe the waiter just likes younger people. Specialty:
Rack of Lamb ($9.00). They serve mostly veal from $7 to $9. Try
to be seated downstairs; it's much cozier. Closed Sundays.
Reservations necessary.
The following is a totally subjective guide to the City's
restaurants. The list is obviously incomplete but it does contain
places which I think are particularly fun for college students. Use
these restaurants as a starter but be sure to do some investigating
on your own. Uniqueness, especially in restaurants, is the essence
of San Francisco.
American
Bud's Ice Cream (Castro at 24th Street) — Even though this isn't
a restaurant (there's no place to sit down) what Bud's has to offer
is so great people are literally willing to wait hours for it. Just look
at the line sometime. What Bud's has is creamy, rich homemade ice
cream. Cones 35 to 65 cents.
The Haven (178 Geary Blvd., 65 Lick Place, 558 Sacramento
St.) — More of a lunch spot, this restaurant offers an abundance of
natural foods sandwiches from $1.35 to $2. However, their
avocado and bacon bits sandwich ($1.95) seems to be the favorite.
Try the fresh fruit juice; they squeeze it before your eyes. Hours
vary at different locations. Polk Street branch closed.
The Front Room (823 Clement St., 1500 California St., 1385
9th Ave.) — The fun spot to eat pizza. Watch old movies Monday
through Wednesday nights and indulge on Thursday; it's dime beer
night. Pizzas from $2.25 to $5.45. Also dinners and pasta. Open
seven days a week.
The Magic Pan (Ghirardelli Square-NOT one on Sutter) —
Crepe fans this is for you. You can get two crepes — spinach, crab,
shrimp to name a few — for $2.20. Get a seat by the window and
treat yourself to a view of Alcatraz and the Bay. Open seven days.
Tadich Grill (240 California St.) — Fish is the word here. Ask
for the what's fresh the day you go. Prices range from $4.50 to
$5.50. This is really an oldtime San Francisco restaurant; it's been
around since 1849. Closed Sundays. No reservations and it closes
surprisingly at 8:30 p.m. So rely on your stomach, trained by Food
Service hours, to get you there early.
Upstairs At the Cliff House (Highway 1 and Point Lobos
Avenue) — Treat yourself to one of 40 kinds of omelettes while
watching rolling waves crash on the rocks below. The salads and
omelettes ($2.75 to $5) are displayed with artistic flair. Open seven
days a week. Great for breakfast.
French
The Basque Hotel (15 Romolo Place) — A great place if you're
