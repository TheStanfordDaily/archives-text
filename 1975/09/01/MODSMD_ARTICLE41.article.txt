# Paly Flicks Show Classic Pix
## Two Downtown Theaters Screen Oldies But Goodies 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
What do you do when you
miss the first run of a movie you
wanted to see? What do you do
when you have the urge to see a
classic like The Big Sleep or It
Happened One Night? What do
you do when foreign films strike
your fancy?
The answer is simple — truck
to downtown Palo Alto, where
the Festival Cinema on Hamilton
Avenue and the New Varsity
Theater on University Avenue
run movies you may either have
missed or fondly remember.
Theaters like this are not
unusual — the Mountain View
Theater shows third-run films,
the Vitaphone in Saratoga runs
classics, and there are many in
San Francisco. What is unusual is
that they both sprouted here in
Palo Alto within one block of
the other.
The Festival Cinema is a little
more than two years old. It
replaced the Academy Cinema,
which opened and closed in a
relatively short time, starved,
according to Festival co-owner
Larry Rockwell, on a diet of
musicals. The theater was
renovated, sloped for better
visibility, and reopened with the
new name under the
management of Rockwell and
Jerome Gary.
Classic Movies
"The intention was to
basically show classic movies,"
says Rockwell. "It's something
that I've had experience with in

New York City. I've worked for
various film distributors and I
really love film, and I love the
history of film. And I don't
particularly like modern new
first-run films with a few notable
exceptions, and it seemed to me
that there's a market in this
area."
"As far as I knew at that
point, nobody had tried it
before. And I knew enough
people around here that liked
movies to think that there were
probably more . . . [people]
who would be more willing to
spend their money seeing
something that they knew than
to go out and spend tnree dollars
to see something they didn't
know." So Rockwell's hobby
began to double as a career.
The office at the Festival is
crammed into a corner behind
the candy counter, surrounded
by a library of film books. It is
overseen by a parrot named
Jo-Jo, who supplies inspiration.
The walls are covered with
posters and stills.
The New Varsity Theater and
Restaurant, on the other hand,
more closely resembles your
run-of-the-mill theater, if you
ignore the restaurant tables and
directors' chairs, each with a
star's name on it.
Wide Variety
The New Varsity has been
operating under the management
of Tom and Bev Corbin and
Glenn and Judith Lutge for
about 16 months. The

quartet's original plans for the
theatre included a restaurant,
which opened about nine
months ago.
According to employee Lynn
Glover, who has worked there
for almost three years, even
before it was the New Varsity,
"We brought back some of the
movies that didn't get enough
exposure." The New Varsity
shows a wide variety of movies
— foreign films, classics, "cult"
films. There is a very good
chance that something you've
missed will turn up at the New
Varsity — anything from Day
Fur Night to Cabaret to Fellini's
Roma.
Glover attributes the quality
in the theater's program to the
time the Corbins and the Lutges
spend constructing their format,
as well as their booker's ability
to follow through with movies
that complement each other
(example: Dr. Strangelove and
Little Murders, black humor
deluxe).
The New Varsity has an easier
time pairing its features because
it has 35 mm projectors, and
35 mm features are generally
available. The Festival, on the
other hand, according to
employee Alan Ligda, has a
more difficult time because it is
only equipped with 16 mm
projectors. Getting the movies
they want when they want them
is their biggest problem.
Mixed Lot
Distributors of 16 mm films

often want 35 percent of the
gross land if both do, that's 70
percent, a situation that quickly
ceases to be profitable) and to
have a double feature of their
movies. United Artists, for
example, will not be thrilled to
send a picture that will be billed
with a feature from Paramount.
Who patronizes these
theaters? Ligda says, "You get
sort of a mixed lot — we get a
lot of college students, we get a
lot of what we euphemistically
call senior citizens, we get a lot
of kids, depending on what we
show. Like we showed the
original Mark of Zorro, with
Douglas Fairbanks — we had so
many kids in there you wouldn't
have believed it, a lot of them
accompanied by their parents, or
their grandparents."
Lynn Glover recognizes many
New Varsity customers as
regular patrons. "The clientele in
this theater is a lot better than
when it was a commercial
theater. . . I don't know what
the difference is, but they're a
much nicer clientele. They like
this idea — this is new to them —
so they open up and they like
it," she says.
Economy is one big
attraction of these theaters: the
$2.50 admission prices ($2 on
weeknights at the
Festival) are considerably less
than what you'd pay to see a
brand-new release. The New
Varsity has an additional magnet

called the Varsity dollar, given
with each admission and worth a
dollar on the next visit.
Cultural Center
Although it may seem
unusual that these theaters
should appear in Palo Alto,
rather than on other cities on
the Peninsula, Rockwell offers
an explanation: "I think there
are a lot of aspects involved. One

is the area has a higher-than
average income, and, concurrent
to that, or as a result of that, a
higher-than-average intelligence
or educational level. That derives
in part from Stanford and in
part from the types of industry
that have somehow gravitated to
this area — electronics,
aerospace, and so on ... I think
the fact that Stanford is here
makes Palo Alto a certain
cultural center, whether it wants
to be or not."
Alan Ligda voices similar
opinions, believing that after 70
years Palo Alto is finally coming
alive as a city, rather than a
suburb.
There are very few stars,
directors, or movies that can be
counted on to definitely draw
customers. Katharine Hepburn,
Humphrey Bogart, and the Marx
Brothers do very well at the
Festival, but so do Orson Welles
and Francois Truffaut.
At the New Varsity, says
Glover, Federico Fellini does
well. She also contends that
everything does well because of
their condensed screening
periods of days instead of a
week like the Festival. This
tends to draw the people in,
because if they put off seeing
the movie, it's gone.
Musicals
Ligda says, "Musicals have
done quite well recently because
of That's Entertainment, which
got a lot of people in to see
them that had never seen a
musical before."
Will the oldies theaters
survive when the nostalgia craze
is gone? Both Ligda and
Rockwell think so. Ligda asserts,
"1 think theaters like this are
here to stay. I don't think it has
much to do with the nostalgia
thing at all ... I think people
that go see pictures like Bogart
pictures are interested in going
to see good pictures . .. because
they are good pictures. You
don't go see something like
Beach Blanket Bingo. . . 1 guess
you could call that nostalgia
today . . . but nobody in their
right mind would go across the
street to see a picture like that."
Larry Rockwell obviously
hopes it is not just a fad.
"Film," he says, "is the only
20th century art. Film is the
only art everyone can talk about

and relate to. Everyone watches
flicks on television, everyone
goes to the movies on Saturday
night. Everyone has fond
memories of getting in for under
12 until they were 15 years old
"Whether the 'nostalgia craze'
is gone, there will always remain
a certain nostalgia about film
experiences that people have
had. People are encountering an
awareness of the cinema as an
art form as opposed to purely an
entertainment device. And 1
think that that realization is
going to keep theaters that show
quality cinema as opposed to
'movies' — it's going to keep us
going. . . There are still going to
be people that are going to go to
a movie theater because they've
never seen Citizen Kane in a
movie theater."
