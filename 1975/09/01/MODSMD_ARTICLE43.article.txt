# Symphony Celebrates Twin Bicentennial
## 
### BLAKE HALLANAN 
Just as San Francisco has
justifiably gained recognition as
one of the great cities of the
world, so too is it admired for its
Symphony Orchestra, one of the
city's major cultural assets. The
Symphony will begin its 64th
season this year, under the
direction of Maestro Seiji
Ozawa, with two world
premieres, a new principal guest
conductor and a variety of
international soloists.
The Symphony, which was
founded in 1911, will highlight
American composers and artists
on virtually every program slated
for the celebration of the Twin
Bicentennial.
In late July of this year,
Maestro Ozawa announced his
resignation as Music Director of
the Symphony at the close of
the 1975-76 season. However, he
will continue to play a strong
role in the musical life of the
orchestra, returning to San
Francisco during the 1976-77
season, when he will serve as
Musical Advisor.
The two world premieres
slated are William Russo's Street
Music, A Blues Concerto, and
Loren Rush's Song and Dance.
Some of the composers
featured for this season are
Aaron Copland, George
Gershwin, Charles Ives, Gerhard
Samuel and Virgil Thomson.
International Composers
The season's programs will
also include works of twelve
international composers who
were attracted to the United
States and lived and worked
here.
Among them were Milhaud,
who taught at Mills College, in
Oakland, Stravinsky, who
eventually lived and composed in
Los Angeles, and Rachmaninoff
and Schoenberg, who both also
settled in Los Angeles.
American soloists making

season series debuts this year
include the members of the
Erick Hawkins Dance Company,
Roberta Alexander, James
Atherton and Shirley Virrett.
Opera House
The symphony's performing
center, the War Memorial Opera
House is located in the heart of
San Francisco. Surrounded by
City Hall and the San Francisco
Museum of Art, the Opera
House was built as a tribute and
memorial to the American
soldiers of World War I.
Financed by public subscription
and a citizen-voted bond issue,
the Opera House was dedicated
in September of 1932, according
to Jo Trogdon, Director of
Public Relations.
The San Francisco Symphony
also features a Symphony
Forum, an organization of
college and university students
who regularly attend concerts on
a reduced-price season ticket
basis. With over 4500
participating members, the
Forum is the largest student
support group of any major
orchestra in the United States.
The Forum is governed by a
Board of Directors consisting of
student representatives, although
financial support is given by the
Symphony Association. This
assistance makes it possible for
Forum members to attend
regular Wednesday evening
Symphony concerts at the Opera
House on a season ticket basis at
special student rates.
The Symphony
representative here is
Richard Simnett, of
Hammarskjold House. Tickets
will also go on sale at Tresidder
on Sept. 29. Students have
the choice of buying a complete
series of 24 Wednesdays or 12
concerts in Series A or B. Bus
service to the Opera House is
also available for an additional
charge.

The San Francisco Symphony
also features a Symphony
Forum, an organization of
college and university students
who regularly attend concerts on
a reduced-price season ticket
basis. With over 4500
participating members, the
Forum is the largest student
support group of any major
orchestra in the United States.
The Forum is governed by a
Board of Directors consisting of
student representatives, although
financial support is given by the
Symphony Association. This
assistance makes it possible for
Forum members to attend
regular Wednesday evening
Symphony concerts at the Opera
House on a season ticket basis at
special student rates.
The Symphony
representative here is
Richard Simnett, of
Hammarskjold House. Tickets
will also go on sale at Tresidder
on Sept. 29. Students have
the choice of buying a complete
series of 24 Wednesdays or 12
concerts in Series A or B. Bus
service to the Opera House is
also available for an additional
charge.
Just as San Francisco has
justifiably gained recognition as
one of the great cities of the
world, so too is it admired for its
Symphony Orchestra, one of the
city's major cultural assets. The
Symphony will begin its 64th
season this year, under the
direction of Maestro Seiji
Ozawa, with two world
premieres, a new principal guest
conductor and a variety of
international soloists.
The Symphony, which was
founded in 1911, will highlight
American composers and artists
on virtually every program slated
for the celebration of the Twin
Bicentennial.
In late July of this year,
Maestro Ozawa announced his
resignation as Music Director of
the Symphony at the close of
the 1975-76 season. However, he
will continue to play a strong
role in the musical life of the
orchestra, returning to San
Francisco during the 1976-77
season, when he will serve as
Musical Advisor.
The two world premieres
slated are William Russo's Street
Music, A Blues Concerto, and
Loren Rush's Song and Dance.
Some of the composers
featured for this season are
Aaron Copland, George
Gershwin, Charles Ives, Gerhard
Samuel and Virgil Thomson.
International Composers
The season's programs will
also include works of twelve
international composers who
were attracted to the United
States and lived and worked
here.
Among them were Milhaud,
who taught at Mills College, in
Oakland, Stravinsky, who
eventually lived and composed in
Los Angeles, and Rachmaninoff
and Schoenberg, who both also
settled in Los Angeles.
American soloists making

season series debuts this year
include the members of the
Erick Hawkins Dance Company,
Roberta Alexander, James
Atherton and Shirley Virrett.
Opera House
The symphony's performing
center, the War Memorial Opera
House is located in the heart of
San Francisco. Surrounded by
City Hall and the San Francisco
Museum of Art, the Opera
House was built as a tribute and
memorial to the American
soldiers of World War I.
Financed by public subscription
and a citizen-voted bond issue,
the Opera House was dedicated
in September of 1932, according
to Jo Trogdon, Director of
Public Relations.
