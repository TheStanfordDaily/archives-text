# Publications Await Student Participation

### KATHY BATTS 
Publications abound on the
Stanford campus. Each year new
ones crop up and a few may fail.
Last year there were 15 campus
publications â€” one has folded.
Students are welcome to work
on all student publications.
The Arena is the conservative
students' newspaper, funded by
the Conservative Student Union.
It publishes twice each quarter.
Campus Report is a
faculty-staff oriented weekly
newspaper. Funded by the
University, it is written by staff
members of the University News
Service.
The Chaparral is the campus
humor magazine. A collection of
satires, its staffers attempt to
produce a product similar to the
National Lampoon, but often
degenerate into tasteless and
obscene material. Funded by the
ASSU Publications Board, it is
published irregularly throughout
the year.
Chicanismo is an independent
publication put out by MECHA,
concerned with Chicano affairs.
Edge is a science fiction
magazine, containing stories,
poems and interviews. It will
enter its second year of
publication this fall.
The Froshbook is a
collection of pictures of all
incoming freshmen, grouped by
dormitories. It is published
annually by the Quad staff.
Here We Go Again, a
newlv-begun alternative
newspaper, is published by the
New Newspaper Collective. It
has only published once so far.
Live Oak, a news-features
weekly began and ended
publication last year. An
alternative campus newspaper,
Live Oak offered in-depth news
and feature articles, almost
magazine style, with one
dominant theme each week.
Partially funded by the ASSU
Publications Board, the paper
lost a fee assessment election last
fall. Staffers cited financial and
staff problems as the cause for
the tabloid's failure. However,
advertising revenues are still left
over, should anyone care to start
it up again.
The Quad is the student
yearbook. Although it ceased

publication in 1972 and 1973, it
returned in 1974, improving
with each year. Staffers work
from fall quarter on, to produce
the book which is issued in May.
The Real News is published
by the Black Students Union,
and deals with black student
affairs.
The Reporter is the Business
School students' publication. It
is published bi-monthly.
Sequoia, the student literary
magazine, is published once per
quarter. Students are encouraged
to submit their poems, artwork
and prose.
The Stanford Daily is the
student newspaper, published
each weekday, except once
during dead week and not at all
during finals and quarter breaks.
Funded through a student fee
assessment, the Daily offers
news, features, entertainment
and sports, plus a Once Around
The Quad section for campus
organization activities and a
pull-out Spectrum, which each
week lists entertainment
possibilities throughout the Bay
Area.
The Stanford Law Review is
published by the Law School.
Issued six times yearly, it is a
scholarly collection of articles
by legal professionals and notes
by law students on various
aspects of the law in our society.
The Stanford Magazine is
published twice a year by the
Alumni Association. A full-color
magazine, it is mailed to alumni
and parents.
The Stanford Observer is a
University-funded newspaper,
mailed out to alumni, parents
and high schools. Copies of the
monthly paper are also available
on campus.
The Stanford Review
publishes outstanding research
papers by undergraduates here.
Any students interested in
working for these publications
should stop by Storke Student
Publications Building, where
most are housed. Anyone
interested in starting up his own
publication should check with
either the ASSU Publications
Board or the Office of the Dean
of Student Affairs.
