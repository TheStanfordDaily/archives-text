# Porno Films Have Come Long Way
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Twenty years ago, if he were lucky, a freshman who wanted to
see one of "those" movies might just get invited to a screening in
some fraternity basement. The "action" featured men in masks
who never took off their socks, an occasional dog sniffing and
snuffling around, and women who "did it."
In the 19605, things had changed a bit, thanks to the likes of
Russ Meyer and his The Immoral Mr. Teas. Curious college
students could venture into the "wrong" side of town to see such
films, which starred large-breasted, unknown, mostly nude women,
who strutted their stuff for the cameras. The action wasn't as
explicit as those classic stag films, but "nudies" were being
commercially exhibited.
So now the silly, scandalous 1970s are here, and most incoming
freshmen are of an age when they can legally see X-rated, erotic or
pornographic films. Erom San Francisco to San Jose, the side of
the Bay where Stanford sits is literally surrounded with
opportunities for X-rated cinema experiences.
Thanks to the likes of Linda Lovelace (Deep Throat), Marilyn
Chambers (Behind the Green Door) and an insatiable curiosity on
the part of the public for pubic extravaganzas, movies with actual
sex acts have come out of the basement and into the world of
cinema.
Erotic Fare
Prices for tickets used to be $4 and $5 two years ago, but
recently prices have stabilized in the $3 to $3.50 range. The Paris
Theater, at 124 University Ave. just across El Camino Real from
the Stanford campus, is the closest hard-core showplace, and does
exhibit the best of recent productions. It's open at noon seven days
a week, so a pomo film fan can attend almost any time of the day.
Moving south along the Peninsula toward San Jose, the theaters
are there, but seldom show anything worth a trip in that direction.
Sunnyvale, to the immediate south, gets its erotic film fare from
the Town & Country Cinema, at 148 South Murphy. And
downtown San Jose's Pussycat II at First and San Salvador is part of
the Pussycat chain of theaters, with cinemas in San Francisco,
Sacramento and Oakland as well as several in Southern California.
However, the widest selection of hard-core films is found in San
Francisco. There for $3.50, or in some cases $2.99 or $1.99, an
adult can see on the screen almost any imaginable sexual act or
fantasy. Some theaters show only the proven money makers, some
hours and hours of straight sexual activity with no plot (called
loops) and others screen the newer, more complex film offerings.
The hard-core film world is also divided into two other broad
categories: male/gay porn films and heterosexual male/female
films. While the heterosexual films may contain some scenes of
female lesbianism, they will never contain any male homosexual
activity. The theaters that show hard core male gay films show
them exclusively. Analyzing the reasons for the complete
segregation of the two types would involve vague socio-economic
sexual theorizing. So suffice to say, the male hard-core movies are
normally shown at the Turk St. Follies, 105 Turk, the Tom-Kat
Theatre at 181 Ellis and the Nob Hill at 729 Bush St.
Male-Female Hardcore
The newest in male/female hardcore can be seen at the O'Farrell
on the corner of Polk and O'Farrell, the Presidio Theatre at
Chestnut near Scott St., or the Screening Room, at 220 Jones.
The Art I Theatre, at 55 Taylor has been showing Deep Throat
and The Devil in Miss Jones for months from 10 a.m. until 1 a.m.,
which might be the place to start to get a historical perspective on
hard-core action.
One theater that mixes live girls with hard-core films is the
Palace at 53 Turk. Recently they have had such luminaries on stage
as Blaze Starr, probably the most famous stripper still working, and
Chesty Morgan, who stands around and shows her 73-inch chest.
There are at least 10 other porno movie palaces in San
Francisco, which show on film the most outrageous and bizarre
sexual practices. Just one look at some should be discouragement
enough from engaging in some of them. However, the fact that
almost any minority sexual practice can now be seen on film by
consenting adults shows how far sexual candor and fantasy have
progressed in 20 years. It's another facet of the Bay Area scene
which any incoming freshman should know exists.
