## Card Grid Fortunes Hang On Air Attack 
### DAVE SMITH 
As Ohio State football is for
four, five or six yards and a
cloud of dust, so Stanford
football — at least in good years
— is for passing.
Great runners have been
scarce at Stanford since Ernie
Nevers took on Notre Dame's
Four Horsemen in the 1925
Rose Bowl, but Stanford's
offense has often been explosive
— and The Farm has sent such
great passers as John Brodie, Jim
Plunkett and Mike Boryla to the
pros.
This year, too, Stanford's
offensive fortunes will depend
largely on its passers and
receivers — and, if nothing else,
they should be doing as much
throwing as anyone on the west
coast. They hope to do some
catching, too.
Quarterbacks Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin, both 6-3
juniors with fine throwing arms,
will split most of the playing
time this season, as they did last
season.
Tenth Leading Passer
Cordova, one of the biggest
and strongest college
quarterbacks in the country at
215 pounds, was an outstanding
linebacker in high school and
runs well. But if all goes well
he'll be spending most of his
time in the pocket, where he was
the nation's tenth leading passer
last year.
He started all but two of the
Cards' games last season, earning
Pac-8 Conference player of the
week honors twice. But while he
was sometimes excellent,
Cordova's play was erratic: He
slumped badly in his last few
games and completed only 43
percent of his passes overall.
At the end of last season
Stanford fans began to clamor
for Benjamin, a smooth passer
who proved that, at least last
season, he was certainly
Stanford's best. In two of the
Cards' most important games
last year, against UCLA and in
the Big Game against Cal,
Benjamin came off the bench
and threw spectacularly.
Quarterback Controversy
Benjamin completed 65
percent of his throws last year,
although he started only one
game. Most of the criticism
directed against Card coach Jack
Christiansen last year was for his
decision to stay with Cordova,
and both quarterbacks should

see a lot of playing time this
season.
Behind them is Jerry
Waldvogel, a senior with two
years' eligibility remaining who
played miraculously well in the
Cards' narrow loss to Michigan
last season.
Chief among the
quarterbacks' targets will be
junior Tony Hill, who hauled in
34 passes last season and is
certainly one of the two or three
best wide receivers in the Pac-8.
His biggest play last year was a
60-yard touch-down catch on a

bomb from Benjamin.
Receiving Corps
Hill will be joined by Bill
Singler, who had a fine year in
1973 and a mediocre one lasi
year. One of the smallest players
on the team, at his best he
resembles ex-Stanford receiver
Randy Vataha.
In contrast to Singler stands
6-8 Mark Hoaglin, a sophomore
who will play some at tight end.
The rest of the offensive line
is big, if somewhat
inexperienced (all five starters
weigh over 240 pounds), but the
backfield may provide a
problem. Ron Inge, a flashy but
often-injured halfback running
from an 1-formation, must
provide the running attack
almost single-handed. Inge, a
junior from Stockton, has the
potential to be Stanford's host
runner in several years, but most
of it is still unrealized.
Inge's backfield mate will be
one of three inexperienced
fullbacks, and for backup is
halfback Sig Ostrom, a good

1974 was an up and down season for Stanford, but it ended
011 one of the happiest moments in Cardinal history.
Senior kicker Mike Langford's (top) 50-yard field goal
seemed to take forever to clear the goalposts. But it did and
California coach Mike White, who looks on from his vantage
point just above the ball, and his team had a good cry over
Stanford's 22-20 Big Game victory.
Junior defensive end Duncan McColl (left) was a big part
of that Big Game victory constantly harassing now-departed
Bear All-American Steve Bartkowski. McColl is a pre-season
Ail-American himself.



Quarterback Mike Cordova (right) had an off day in the Big
Game, but he finished the 1974 season with 1569 yards and
was the second best passer in the conference behind
Bartkowski.
Ron Inge was the second leading rusher in the Big Game
and the junior running back is responsible for Stanford's
I-formation this year. The coaches went to the formation to
give him the ball more. USC coach John McKay, who has
produced several great backs from his I-formation, said after
last year's game with the Cards, "Inge could be a really great
back running from an I-formation." We'll get a chance to find
out this year.
