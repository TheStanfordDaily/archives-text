## Card Grid Fortunes Hang On Air Attack 
### DAVE SMITH 
As Ohio State football is for
four, five or six yards and a
cloud of dust, so Stanford
football — at least in good years
— is for passing.
Great runners have been
scarce at Stanford since Ernie
Nevers took on Notre Dame's
Four Horsemen in the 1925
Rose Bowl, but Stanford's
offense has often been explosive
— and The Farm has sent such
great passers as John Brodie, Jim
Plunkett and Mike Boryla to the
pros.
This year, too, Stanford's
offensive fortunes will depend
largely on its passers and
receivers — and, if nothing else,
they should be doing as much
throwing as anyone on the west
coast. They hope to do some
catching, too.
Quarterbacks Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin, both 6-3
juniors with fine throwing arms,
will split most of the playing
time this season, as they did last
season.
Tenth Leading Passer
Cordova, one of the biggest
and strongest college
quarterbacks in the country at
215 pounds, was an outstanding
linebacker in high school and
runs well. But if all goes well
he'll be spending most of his
time in the pocket, where he was
the nation's tenth leading passer
last year.
He started all but two of the
Cards' games last season, earning
Pac-8 Conference player of the
week honors twice. But while he
was sometimes excellent,
Cordova's play was erratic: He
slumped badly in his last few
games and completed only 43
percent of his passes overall.
At the end of last season
Stanford fans began to clamor
for Benjamin, a smooth passer
who proved that, at least last
season, he was certainly
Stanford's best. In two of the
Cards' most important games
last year, against UCLA and in
the Big Game against Cal,
Benjamin came off the bench
and threw spectacularly.
Quarterback Controversy
Benjamin completed 65
percent of his throws last year,
although he started only one
game. Most of the criticism
directed against Card coach Jack
Christiansen last year was for his
decision to stay with Cordova,
and both quarterbacks should

see a lot of playing time this
season.
Behind them is Jerry
Waldvogel, a senior with two
years' eligibility remaining who
played miraculously well in the
Cards' narrow loss to Michigan
last season.
Chief among the
quarterbacks' targets will be
junior Tony Hill, who hauled in
34 passes last season and is
certainly one of the two or three
best wide receivers in the Pac-8.
His biggest play last year was a
60-yard touch-down catch on a

bomb from Benjamin.
Receiving Corps
Hill will be joined by Bill
Singler, who had a fine year in
1973 and a mediocre one lasi
year. One of the smallest players
on the team, at his best he
resembles ex-Stanford receiver
Randy Vataha.
In contrast to Singler stands
6-8 Mark Hoaglin, a sophomore
who will play some at tight end.
The rest of the offensive line
is big, if somewhat
inexperienced (all five starters
weigh over 240 pounds), but the
backfield may provide a
problem. Ron Inge, a flashy but
often-injured halfback running
from an 1-formation, must
provide the running attack
almost single-handed. Inge, a
junior from Stockton, has the
potential to be Stanford's host
runner in several years, but most
of it is still unrealized.
Inge's backfield mate will be
one of three inexperienced
fullbacks, and for backup is
halfback Sig Ostrom, a good

1974 was an up and down season for Stanford, but it ended
011 one of the happiest moments in Cardinal history.
Senior kicker Mike Langford's (top) 50-yard field goal
seemed to take forever to clear the goalposts. But it did and
California coach Mike White, who looks on from his vantage
point just above the ball, and his team had a good cry over
Stanford's 22-20 Big Game victory.
Junior defensive end Duncan McColl (left) was a big part
of that Big Game victory constantly harassing now-departed
Bear All-American Steve Bartkowski. McColl is a pre-season
Ail-American himself.



Quarterback Mike Cordova (right) had an off day in the Big
Game, but he finished the 1974 season with 1569 yards and
was the second best passer in the conference behind
Bartkowski.
Ron Inge was the second leading rusher in the Big Game
and the junior running back is responsible for Stanford's
I-formation this year. The coaches went to the formation to
give him the ball more. USC coach John McKay, who has
produced several great backs from his I-formation, said after
last year's game with the Cards, "Inge could be a really great
back running from an I-formation." We'll get a chance to find
out this year.
receiver but an unproven rusher.
Clearly Inge will have his hands
full, because without a good
rushing game — the lack of it has
hurt Stanford in the past three
seasons — the Cardinal offense
will be in trouble.
Kicker Mike Langford, who
provided one of the best
moments in Stanford football
when his wobbly 50-yard field
goal with no time remaining won
last year's Big Game, is back this
year as one of the nation's
leading kickers. Tom Lynn, who
tied a Stanford record for a
number of punts last year
(although his average distance
was one of the shortest in the
league) and JC transfer Mike
Michel will share the punting
chores.
Defense
On defense, Stanford will
find out whether a team that
lost its three best defensive
linemen, three of its four best
linebackers, and the star of its
secondary can survive. Junior
defensive end Duncan McColl,
who came on strong at the end
of last year, will anchor the line.
His father, Dr. Bill McColl, was
an ail-American receiver here in
the early 50s.
Geb Church, who played well
last year, is the only returning
starter among the linebackers,

although inside linebacker Dan
Francis played in several games.
The Cards generally play a
"50" defense, with the three
linemen the key to both defense
against the run and pass rushing.
In past seasons the defense has
proved vulnerable to good
rushers like UCLA's Kermit
Johnson and USC's Anthony
Davis (both gone, fortunately),
but against such teams
Christiansen plans to move one
of his four linebackers up to the
line.
Chris, perhaps the greatest
defensive back in National
Football League history, has had
three winning seasons on the
Farm since he replaced John
Ralston in 1972.
A former head coach of the
San Francisco 49ers, he has been
most heavily criticized for his
failure to develop a rushing game

and his frequent bouts of
indecision over the starting
quarterback — and praised for
working with Plunkett, Boryla,
Cordova and Benjamin in
building one of the college
game's best passing attacks.
Key Pac-8 Games
But the key to this season, as
to the last twenty or so, will be a
few key Pac-8 games. In the next
two contests, both at home
against San Jose State and
Army, the Cards must prepare
for seven straight conference
games, starting with UCLA on
Oct. 11 at Stanford.
The Bruins' greatest asset is
their quarterback John Sciarra, a
definite Heisman Trophy
candidate who can run and pass
well — and who broke his leg last
year, The Bruin coaching is
suspect, but UCLA has always
been tough for the Cards;
Stanford has won only two of
the last 12 games (last year's
game ended in a 13-13 tie) with
the L.A. power, a pre season
pick to finish anywhere from
second to fourth, in the league.
The Pac-8 teams are more
even this year than they have
been for many seasons, with all
four northern teams having a
chance to break into the
conference's first division. The
class of the league should

certainly be USC, but after
losing stars Anthony Davis, Pat
Haden and J.K. McKay, the
Trojans will hardly be
unbeatable.
Cal should be one of the best
teams in the conference, with
probably the best running back
(Chuck Muncie) and the best
receiver (Steve Rivera) in the
league. But no matter where the
Cards and Bears stand by Nov.
22, the game will be tightly
played, if not as close as last
year's, when Cal scored a
touchdown with 26 seconds left
— and the Cards came back to
win on Langford's field goal.
What are the Cards' chances?
From now on, they should be
favorites or mild underdogs in
every game but one, the USC
contest. One prestigious
pre-season poll ranked the Cards
11th in the nation. They may
not finish that high, but they
have a good chance to come in
second in the Pac-8, if not to
upset Rose Bowl champs USC.
At any rate, the Cards have
almost always been an exciting
team to watch, at least for fans
who like passing and scoring.
And with such a great passing
tradition tp back them up,
Benjamin of Cordova might just
pass his way into stardom this
year.

Marching Band is able to put on a show at a football game. SMUT makes decisions on which
formations the band will use. Some of the formations are relatively clean and others aren't so clean.
