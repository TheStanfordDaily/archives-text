# Football Ticket Sale Set
## 
### 
Now that the Daily has
gotten you excited about
Stanford football, you'll
probably want to know how you
can see the six home games.
You could try to climb over
the fence, but the Athletic
Department has some of the best
security forces in the conference
— at least when it comes to gate
crashing. Or you could sneak
into the stadium on Friday
afternoon when the Cardinals
are holding their closed workout
and wait in the restroom until
the game starts. The only
problem with this method is that
you'd have to have one hell of a
case of the runs.
There's a much easier way.
You can purchase a student
season ticket. By doing this
you'll be saving yourself $2 and
you'll also avoid the trials of
waiting in line to purchase your
ticket the day of the game.
Here's how you can do it.
After you've finished
registering at Maples Pavilion, on
either Monday Sept. 29 or
Tuesday Sept. 30, go to the
main ticket booth outside the
Pavilion. It will be open from
8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. both
days.

Hand the ticket agent $10
and she'll hand you a student
season ticket booklet.
Remember to bring your
validated Fall Quarter student
body card with you, or you will
not be able to purchase the
book.
As in the past, each student
can purchase only one book. But
married students are allowed to
purchase a season ticket book
for their spouse when the card is
validated as married student.
The student book contains
one ticket for each of the
following home games:
Army — Oct. 4, UCLA — Oct.
11, Washington State — Oct. 25,
Oregon — Nov. 15 and California
— Nov. 22. After registration
ticket books will be sold at the
athletic department.
In order to avoid
disappointment, you should
purchase your ticket for the
USC game, in Los Angeles, when
you buy your season ticket. USC
allots about 2300 tickets for
Stanford students and they
really go fast. You'll be able to
purchase one USC ticket with
your student body card. The
price is $3.50 per ticket. After
registration they'll be sold on
the basis of availability.

main ticket booth outside the
Pavilion. It will be open from
8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. both
days.

Hand the ticket agent $10
and she'll hand you a student
season ticket booklet.
Remember to bring your
validated Fall Quarter student
body card with you, or you will
not be able to purchase the
book.
As in the past, each student
can purchase only one book. But
married students are allowed to
purchase a season ticket book
for their spouse when the card is
validated as married student.
The student book contains
one ticket for each of the
following home games:
Army — Oct. 4, UCLA — Oct.
11, Washington State — Oct. 25,
Oregon — Nov. 15 and California
— Nov. 22. After registration
ticket books will be sold at the
athletic department.
In order to avoid
disappointment, you should
purchase your ticket for the
USC game, in Los Angeles, when
you buy your season ticket. USC
allots about 2300 tickets for
Stanford students and they
really go fast. You'll be able to
purchase one USC ticket with
your student body card. The
price is $3.50 per ticket. After
registration they'll be sold on
the basis of availability.
