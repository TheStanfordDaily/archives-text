# Arriving Fresh At Stanford: It Isn't All That Much Fun
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
(Editor's note: This is a reprint of an article
which appeared in the Daily in September
1971.)
I watched the people stream out of Gate 66
at San Francisco International loaded down
with luggage and children and overnight bags. It
wasn't particularly hard to spot the freshmen:
they looked a little lost, in some cases a little
awed, and a lot of them carried Approaching
Stanford under an arm.
And so I fell into line behind a group of
seven or eight. Some brilliant Daily executive
had decided to send a reporter to the airport to
pretend to be a freshman and ride the pre-reg
committee bus back to Stanford. I am still not
sure, but I think that they were making some
kind of subtle comment on my maturity,
writing, etc. when they picked me.
Anyway, I can tell you being a freshman
isn't much fun. I really didn't enjoy wandering
around the airport, not knowing where the
luggage was going to be coming out and not
knowing where the buses were or anything else.
And I really didn't enjoy putting on a
moronic smile and saying, "Hi, I'm Glenn, I'm
from Albuquerque, New Mexico, I got 1478 on
my SAT."
And I really didn't enjoy feeling stupid and
inadequate when some four-foot dwarf would
tell me what his SAT score was.
Again
Admittedly, I was a freshman once. It wasn't
even too long ago. But I just didn't feel like
doing it again. It's kind of like living through
the Hindenburg crash twice.
But, it was either this or brave the wrath of
the Daily news editor, feature editor and
managing editor. That's as much of a choice as
the poor guy in the Godfather had when they
told him he could put his signature on the
contract or they would put his brains on it.
I was in luck with the particular group of
freshmen I was trying to blend in with. By
coincidence, they were from Albuquerque, my
old home town, and I felt pretty much at ease
talking about high school and what a big shot I
used to be.
I even slipped into talking old New Mexican
slang: "Cadron!" I snarled at some clown who
dropped a suitcase on my foot. Cadron is a
Mexican word with impolite connotations.
Bigger
Mostly the only time I use it around
Stanford is to people who are bigger than me
whom I am afraid to insult in English.
After several hours messing around at the
baggage claim where Continental Airlines
seemed bent on proving their total
incompetence, I wandered on to the bus,
listening to the people around. "This airport is
so big. It's amazing." Yeah, I thought so too,
coming in from Albuquerque for the first time.
"I was looking for the Golden Gate Bridge
when I came in, but I couldn't see it." Yeah, I
did too. No one had ever told me that there
were 20 billion bridges in the Bay Area. And no
one ever told me that the airport was 20 miles

away from San Francisco.
"How can these pre-reg people get anything
done? It all seems so confused." That's one that
my year of education at Stanford hasn't been
able to answer yet. I don't know how they get
anything done. Maybe it's all done with
mirrors.
Now it's time to get on the bus and listen to
the conversations. There weren't too many, and
I can remember why.
Once you get to the bus, everything sort of
hits you: what the hell am I doing here? What's
wrong with me, ever thinking I could go to
Stanford? God, all these people are probably so
smart, and I'm so damn stupid. What am I going
to do? Everyone is going to hate me. They'll all
think I'm dumb.
This kind of thought is not exactly
conducive to conversation. But still, there were
some attempts.
Politicians
There were the two budding politicians
across the aisle from me, who talked about
Boys' State and what good impressions they
both made there. I wish I had the names of
these two gentlemen, because I would like to
predict that within three years they will have
gone far in the ASSU.
There were others. Two girls in the back
bemoaned the fact that all the other female
freshmen were so pretty, how would they ever
get boys? I can think of a lot of funny
comments to inject here, but I don't want 600
freshman girls taking shots at my window, so I
won't.
And there was the boy sitting in front of me,
very shy and very scared, who was away from
home for the first time in his life. And he had
just finished his first plane ride. "My mother
started crying at the airport. This is the first
time I've been away from home for more than
two or three nights and now I won't be home
for three months. I know I'm going to be
homesick."
Comforting
What do you say to something like that?
Yeah, you probably will. Practically everyone
is. But that's not very comforting.
Across the aisle, the conversation had
mercifully turned away from the glory of Boys'
State.
Someone asked, "Is this still San
Francisco?" No, this is Millbrae-Redwood
City-Atherton-Menlo Park or wherever the hell
we are right at the moment. "But when did we
leave San Francisco?" You have to be from
someplace like New Mexico to understand a
question like that, someplace where they don't
build wall-to-wall cities. When you leave a town
in New Mexico, you KNOW you've left it.
And then we made the turn on Galvez and
there was the inevitable question: "Is THAT
Stanford?" and the even more inevitable
answer: "Yes."
Then people start getting off the bus at their
dorms. I felt like yelling, "It will all turn out
more or less right in the end." But I didn't.
That's something you have to learn by yourself.

old home town, and I felt pretty much at ease
talking about high school and what a big shot I
used to be.
I even slipped into talking old New Mexican
slang: "Cadron!" I snarled at some clown who
dropped a suitcase on my foot. Cadron is a
Mexican word with impolite connotations.
Bigger
Mostly the only time I use it around
Stanford is to people who are bigger than me
whom I am afraid to insult in English.
After several hours messing around at the
baggage claim where Continental Airlines
seemed bent on proving their total
incompetence, I wandered on to the bus,
listening to the people around. "This airport is
so big. It's amazing." Yeah, I thought so too,
coming in from Albuquerque for the first time.
"I was looking for the Golden Gate Bridge
when I came in, but I couldn't see it." Yeah, I
did too. No one had ever told me that there
were 20 billion bridges in the Bay Area. And no
one ever told me that the airport was 20 miles

away from San Francisco.
"How can these pre-reg people get anything
done? It all seems so confused." That's one that
my year of education at Stanford hasn't been
able to answer yet. I don't know how they get
anything done. Maybe it's all done with
mirrors.
Now it's time to get on the bus and listen to
the conversations. There weren't too many, and
I can remember why.
Once you get to the bus, everything sort of
hits you: what the hell am I doing here? What's
wrong with me, ever thinking I could go to
Stanford? God, all these people are probably so
smart, and I'm so damn stupid. What am I going
to do? Everyone is going to hate me. They'll all
think I'm dumb.
This kind of thought is not exactly
conducive to conversation. But still, there were
some attempts.
Politicians
There were the two budding politicians
across the aisle from me, who talked about
Boys' State and what good impressions they
both made there. I wish I had the names of
these two gentlemen, because I would like to
predict that within three years they will have
gone far in the ASSU.
There were others. Two girls in the back
bemoaned the fact that all the other female
freshmen were so pretty, how would they ever
get boys? I can think of a lot of funny
comments to inject here, but I don't want 600
freshman girls taking shots at my window, so I
won't.
And there was the boy sitting in front of me,
very shy and very scared, who was away from
home for the first time in his life. And he had
just finished his first plane ride. "My mother
started crying at the airport. This is the first
time I've been away from home for more than
two or three nights and now I won't be home
for three months. I know I'm going to be
homesick."
Comforting
What do you say to something like that?
Yeah, you probably will. Practically everyone
is. But that's not very comforting.
Across the aisle, the conversation had
mercifully turned away from the glory of Boys'
State.
Someone asked, "Is this still San
Francisco?" No, this is Millbrae-Redwood
City-Atherton-Menlo Park or wherever the hell
we are right at the moment. "But when did we
leave San Francisco?" You have to be from
someplace like New Mexico to understand a
question like that, someplace where they don't
build wall-to-wall cities. When you leave a town
in New Mexico, you KNOW you've left it.
And then we made the turn on Galvez and
there was the inevitable question: "Is THAT
Stanford?" and the even more inevitable
answer: "Yes."
Then people start getting off the bus at their
dorms. I felt like yelling, "It will all turn out
more or less right in the end." But I didn't.
That's something you have to learn by yourself.
(Editor's note: This is a reprint of an article
which appeared in the Daily in September
1971.)
I watched the people stream out of Gate 66
at San Francisco International loaded down
with luggage and children and overnight bags. It
wasn't particularly hard to spot the freshmen:
they looked a little lost, in some cases a little
awed, and a lot of them carried Approaching
Stanford under an arm.
And so I fell into line behind a group of
seven or eight. Some brilliant Daily executive
had decided to send a reporter to the airport to
pretend to be a freshman and ride the pre-reg
committee bus back to Stanford. I am still not
sure, but I think that they were making some
kind of subtle comment on my maturity,
writing, etc. when they picked me.
Anyway, I can tell you being a freshman
isn't much fun. I really didn't enjoy wandering
around the airport, not knowing where the
luggage was going to be coming out and not
knowing where the buses were or anything else.
And I really didn't enjoy putting on a
moronic smile and saying, "Hi, I'm Glenn, I'm
from Albuquerque, New Mexico, I got 1478 on
my SAT."
And I really didn't enjoy feeling stupid and
inadequate when some four-foot dwarf would
tell me what his SAT score was.
Again
Admittedly, I was a freshman once. It wasn't
even too long ago. But I just didn't feel like
doing it again. It's kind of like living through
the Hindenburg crash twice.
But, it was either this or brave the wrath of
the Daily news editor, feature editor and
managing editor. That's as much of a choice as
the poor guy in the Godfather had when they
told him he could put his signature on the
contract or they would put his brains on it.

Boys' State and what good impressions they
both made there. I wish I had the names of
these two gentlemen, because I would like to
predict that within three years they will have
gone far in the ASSU.
There were others. Two girls in the back
bemoaned the fact that all the other female
freshmen were so pretty, how would they ever
get boys? I can think of a lot of funny
comments to inject here, but I don't want 600
freshman girls taking shots at my window, so I
won't.
And there was the boy sitting in front of me,
very shy and very scared, who was away from
home for the first time in his life. And he had
just finished his first plane ride. "My mother
started crying at the airport. This is the first
time I've been away from home for more than
two or three nights and now I won't be home
for three months. I know I'm going to be
homesick."
Comforting
What do you say to something like that?
Yeah, you probably will. Practically everyone
is. But that's not very comforting.
Across the aisle, the conversation had
mercifully turned away from the glory of Boys'
State.
Someone asked, "Is this still San
Francisco?" No, this is Millbrae-Redwood
City-Atherton-Menlo Park or wherever the hell
we are right at the moment. "But when did we
leave San Francisco?" You have to be from
someplace like New Mexico to understand a
question like that, someplace where they don't
build wall-to-wall cities. When you leave a town
in New Mexico, you KNOW you've left it.
And then we made the turn on Galvez and
there was the inevitable question: "Is THAT
Stanford?" and the even more inevitable
answer: "Yes."
Then people start getting off the bus at their
dorms. I felt like yelling, "It will all turn out
more or less right in the end." But I didn't.
That's something you have to learn by yourself.
(Editor's note: This is a reprint of an article
which appeared in the Daily in September
1971.)
I watched the people stream out of Gate 66
at San Francisco International loaded down
with luggage and children and overnight bags. It
wasn't particularly hard to spot the freshmen:
they looked a little lost, in some cases a little
awed, and a lot of them carried Approaching
Stanford under an arm.
And so I fell into line behind a group of
seven or eight. Some brilliant Daily executive
had decided to send a reporter to the airport to
pretend to be a freshman and ride the pre-reg
committee bus back to Stanford. I am still not
sure, but I think that they were making some
kind of subtle comment on my maturity,
writing, etc. when they picked me.
Anyway, I can tell you being a freshman
isn't much fun. I really didn't enjoy wandering
around the airport, not knowing where the
luggage was going to be coming out and not
knowing where the buses were or anything else.
And I really didn't enjoy putting on a
moronic smile and saying, "Hi, I'm Glenn, I'm
from Albuquerque, New Mexico, I got 1478 on
my SAT."
And I really didn't enjoy feeling stupid and
inadequate when some four-foot dwarf would
tell me what his SAT score was.
Again
Admittedly, I was a freshman once. It wasn't
even too long ago. But I just didn't feel like
doing it again. It's kind of like living through
the Hindenburg crash twice.
But, it was either this or brave the wrath of
the Daily news editor, feature editor and
managing editor. That's as much of a choice as
the poor guy in the Godfather had when they
told him he could put his signature on the
contract or they would put his brains on it.
I was in luck with the particular group of
freshmen I was trying to blend in with. By
coincidence, they were from Albuquerque, my
old home town, and I felt pretty much at ease
talking about high school and what a big shot I
used to be.
I even slipped into talking old New Mexican
slang: "Cadron!" I snarled at some clown who
dropped a suitcase on my foot. Cadron is a
Mexican word with impolite connotations.
Bigger
Mostly the only time I use it around
Stanford is to people who are bigger than me
whom I am afraid to insult in English.
After several hours messing around at the
baggage claim where Continental Airlines
seemed bent on proving their total
incompetence, I wandered on to the bus,
listening to the people around. "This airport is
so big. It's amazing." Yeah, I thought so too,
coming in from Albuquerque for the first time.
"I was looking for the Golden Gate Bridge
when I came in, but I couldn't see it." Yeah, I
did too. No one had ever told me that there
were 20 billion bridges in the Bay Area. And no
one ever told me that the airport was 20 miles

away from San Francisco.
"How can these pre-reg people get anything
done? It all seems so confused." That's one that
my year of education at Stanford hasn't been
able to answer yet. I don't know how they get
anything done. Maybe it's all done with
mirrors.
Now it's time to get on the bus and listen to
the conversations. There weren't too many, and
I can remember why.
Once you get to the bus, everything sort of
hits you: what the hell am I doing here? What's
wrong with me, ever thinking I could go to
Stanford? God, all these people are probably so
smart, and I'm so damn stupid. What am I going
to do? Everyone is going to hate me. They'll all
think I'm dumb.
This kind of thought is not exactly
conducive to conversation. But still, there were
some attempts.
