## How To Watch The Cards 
### Viae Kershner 
Saturdays fall glorious, ah.
You definitely have to go to a Stanford
football game, and preferably five out of six (one
game, inevitably Oregon, it'll rain and you'll be
miserable). You definitely must go, even if you
aren't a fan. Especially if you aren't a fan. Even
though at times you'll be bored, crowded,
infuriated, sunburned and wishing there was a
john within five minutes reach, it's all worth it.
Somehow.
The psychology of the student section being
what it is, alternately resembling Ohio obnoxious
and Woodstock West, it really doesn't matter if
Stanford a) wins a thriller b) gets clobbered or c)
wins a dull game. (Option c. is the most likely
alternative.) You'll have a memorable time
nonetheless.
Ok, onto the helpful hints section. I hear this
issue is supposed to be loaded with helpful hits
for freshmen â€” disregard them all.
The best thing to do is to get up early
Saturday morning and load a picnic basket with
standard-type fare like fruit, cheese and
well-hidden Coors. If it's well-hidden, you'll be
OK. Make sure it's Coors. Personally, I can't stand
the stuff, but it's definitely the in brew.
For every game except Cal and UCLA, if you
leave by 11, you'll probably get at least a 30-yard
line seat. For Cal and UCLA, make it 9:30. It's
definitely best to have already-bought student
season tickets. They're cheap, and having them
prevents a lot of hassle.
How to get to the Stadium: If you leave during
mid-morning, just follow your ears to the carillon
bells of Hoover Tower. They make a pretty
sound, and it's a nice walk. Once you get to the
Tower, follow the crowd down Serra Street.
When you get to the Stadium, look for one of
our free Daily football issues. I'm not just saying
that because I'm editor of the Daily, though
that's the main reason. The issues are informative
before the game starts, are good seat-covers or
sun-shades during the game, and make nice paper
airplanes afterwards. For free, how can you go
wrong?
Once safely inside (it's best to be high up, even
if you're 10 yards further from the 50) you can
look forward to a period of boredom until about

12:40, when the Stanford band comes marching
in, showing off like a parody of an Eastern
European army.
The band always puts on a great pre-garne
show. They'll play some good ole foot-stomping
Stanford Indian music, the best goddamn
National Anthem this side of Ella Fitzgerald, and
Stanford's two fight songs.
The one song is "Come Join The Band," a
second-rate traditional rouser that always leaves
me wondering why I didn't go to Michigan, but
arouses the bloody-Mary warmed hearts of the
alumni on the shady side of the field.
The other fight song, the students' song, is "All
Right Now." Sometimes the bandleader gets
uppity and doesn't want to play it. If so, throw
the nearest object at his head. The students'
reaction to this song is probably the high point of
the gamp.
Then the game starts. What can you say about
a football game? The first quarter is usually a
good one for Stanford, the second quarter stinks,
the third quarter is a drag, the fourth quarter can
be truly exciting.
Stanford passes a lot, but most students think
the Cards should throw even more. Once you've
seen our running game, you'll know why. Coach
Chris is putting a lot of faith in Ron Inge as a
runner, but well, our offensive line, being small,
has usually been much better at pass blocking.
Oh yeah, quarterbacks. Last year, the fans
loved Guy Benjamin and hated Mike Cordova.
Cordova, a perfectly good dude well in tune with
the average student, knew it and started pressing.
Please be nice to him as well as to Benjamin.
They're both trying.
During the game, you may see some
cheerleaders. They'll be ignored. If something
really exciting happens, the cheering will come
spontaneously.
At the end of the game, two good things to do
are 1) stay in the Stadium and boogy to the band
and 2) go outside and try to mooch some goop
d'exquisite from one of the thousands of
tailgaters.
By now, you probably think I'm crazy. Well,
you have to be a little crazy to properly enjoy a
Stanford football game. Thousands of us are.
