# Grosser Than You See
## An Inside Look Into The Band

a reprint of an article that
appeared in the Daily last
October.)
Consider stopping in at a
Stanford football game. No
matter how bad the carnage on
the field, the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band has
pledged top notch
entertainment.
The halftime show, built
around the theme of getting
ahead in America, is "better
than average for us," leered
Norm Halleen, Band manager.
"A couple of formations, if you
look at them the right way are
pretty gross."
The pre-game show is also
pretty good, Bandsmen said.
Originally it was going to be a

salute to housing, but the Band
decided against a tribute to
Larry Horton, the associate dean
of residential education.
It said HORTON: SUCK ME.
"This has too many letters,"
explained Band librarian Whit
Goodrich. "We don't have that
many guys."
Another idea that was tossed
around was a tribute to the
football team. The formation
was to say WIN ONE, while the
Band played "Someday."
The group of Bandsmen who
devise the halftime and pre-game
shows are known as the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers or
SMUT. The acronym is certainly
appropriate.
"We have to try to get the
show to say something new and
yet be totally insane as a unit,"
Halleen said. "We're not very big
on doing salutes to the new law
school," he added somewhat
superfluously.
Drunk
SMUT operates on three
levels, Halleen said. The first and
most general involves a large
number of bandsmen sitting
around and getting drunk.
"At some meetings we may
not have to do anything but
drink a lot of beer," Halleen
said. "Other times four or five
formations come out just like
that."
The first group comes up
with basic ideas for shows. Then
about a dozen bandsmen work
on cutting the ideas down to a
manageable size. "They twist a
25-letter spellout into six or
seven letters that mean
something," Halleen said. Then
someone actually diagrams the
formations so individual
bandsmen will know where to
stand.
Topicality is important to the
Band, and this fall events have
moved almost too fast for them.
"All of a sudden all the Nixon
formations are no good and we
have to do things with Ford,"
Halleen said.
Justice
"On the way to Penn State
the show was going to be about
America's summer vacation. . .
By the time we got back there
enough stuff had happened that
we could do a show on
American justice's summer
vacation," he said.
Narration for the shows is left

totally up to the Band's
announcer. "He treats the staff
with no mercy," Halleen said.
"Have you seen the press
releases he puts out?.. . They
list all of our names.
"To show how important the
information is, down with all the
names he puts bits of
information like 'The capital of
Arkansas is Little Rock,' stuff
like that."
Tasteful
Good taste and mature
judgement have never exercised
a restraining influence on the
Band. Halftime shows have dealt
with everything from UCLA
running back James McCalister's
grade point average to a "Salute
To Puberty," at last year's
Berkeley game.
The latter, Halleen said,
attracted the most complaints of
any since he joined the Band in
1971. It featured a form
HI, MEN and the Band played
"Break on Through." A later
formation supposedly dealing
with skin problems said NO
PIMP.
A third, Halleen said, showed
"a band grasping a razor, which
looked very much like a guy
beating off." Some alumni
indicated they were
unappreciative.
"They were not so much
appalled by the formations as by
the fact they thought we were
trying to snow them, which we
weren't," Halleen said. "We're
not always subtle."
Not Gross Enough
Sometimes complaints run in
another direction. "Another
show we did, we got a lot of
complaints from the student
body," Halleen said. "They
didn't think it was gross
enough."
Some shows over the years
have been labeled too gross and
will never see the light of day, he
said.
"Even our highly sexual
shows have been to a theme,
albeit little," Halleen said. "We
have to have some way to talk
our way out of it if we get
caught."
Among those shows you'll
never see at halftime:
—a Bible show, which would
open with the song "Along
Comes Mary" and close with
"Hang 'Em High";

—a Middle East show, with a
formation showing what Halleen
describes as a crack in the
Ass-wan Dam";
—a Kennedy show, leading
with a formation of a
half-submerged Volkswagen
while the Band plays "Bridge
over Troubled Waters."
"This [these shows) wouldn't
go on the field," Halleen
hastened to point out.
One show now under
consideration is entitled "Death
of Medicine."
"It's got some bugs in it, so
we're not doing it this week,"
Halleen said. "If we can find a
subtle way to get a wheel chair
onto the field you may see it."
The show, according to
several Bandsmen, includes a
formation on the death of
actress Jane Mansfield, depicted
in an auto accident several years
ago. It shows a car between twc
suggestively-formed hills as the
Band plays "Another Saturday
Night (And I Ain't Got No
Body)."
In another formation the
Band salutes former President
Richard Nixon's health by
spelling CLOT and playing
"Killing Me Softly."
But the Bandsmen point out
that the show isn't in its final
form yet and both numbers may
be out.
To continually design shows
gross enough to satisfy Stanford
students and yet clean enough to
keep Bandsmen enrolled is a
tough job, Halleen insisted.
"The students are always
saying 'come on, come on, you
can do worse than that,' " he
explained. Every week they
wonder 'What are they going to
do besides the same old cock
and balls routine?' We have to
work."
