# Incredibly Diverse
## Pompon Dollies Defy Stereotypes 
### LINDA BUDDENBERG 
(Editor's Note: The author was a
pompon dollie last year.)
"They sure don't look like
any other pompon girls I've ever
seen!"
"Typical dumb blondes . . .
what a bunch of puffheads!"
"I think the tall one is the
linebacker's girlfriend."
"They're obviously all
pre-weds, here for their M.R.S.
degrees."
"How can anyone exploit
themselves like that?"
"Who cares about the
football team? I come here to
watch them and the Band!"
"I'll say one thing — they
sure know how to dance!"
"Those girls have no dancing
talent whatsoever — they're just
down there to look pretty."
"I never knew that bodies
could . . . could . . . could wiggle
like that!"
Traditional Enemies
No one agrees on anything
about the Stanford Dollies.
Traditional enemies to women's
libbers and darlings of the frats,
everything has been said about
this group. Whatever you've
heard about them is probably
true: Dollies have been as

diversified as any other group of
Stanford students.
One thing Dollies are not are
traditional cheerleaders. They're
the only Pacific-8 group which is
not a spirit organization; instead,
they belong to the Band.
Consequently, Dollies have
different functions than spirit
groups from any other school.
Terry Bowman, '74-'75 Dollie
explains, "Alumni and coaches
ask us to lead cheers and appear
at all the athletic events; but
we're not cheerleaders, we're
dancers. We go where the band
goes."
Also unlike other groups,
Dollies can only be Dollies for
one year. "When you practice 50
hours a week in the fall, you can
only take it for one year," says
ex-Dollie Loretta Churchill.
"You burn out after that."
Public Exposure
Even though their tenures last
only a year, continuous public
exposure brings out various
myths about the group. The
Band's tendency to exaggerate
results in some pretty wild tales.
A few such stories have given
Dollies a racy reputation. Years
ago, for instance, the Band used
to "serenade" each Dollie at her

campus residence before games
and one particular Dollie would
dance naked in front of her
Roth House window for the
Band.
Most Dollies, though, break
the traditional stereotype. A
large percentage of them have
gone on to graduate schools,
including the Stanford Law and
Med schools. One of last year's
Dollies has become a Daily
photographer. Another '74-'75
Dollie, Denise Gallardo, entered
and won the Miss Redwood City
pageant.
Love To Dance
With such broad range of
backgrounds, what do these girls
have in common? How and why
do Dollies become Dollies? Most
will answer that they love to
dance. Other factors include the
desire to meet people, the desire
to have an outlet away from the
academic grind, love of the
Band, of boyfriends on the
football team. The most notable
Dolly romance resulted in the
marriage of '72-'73 Dollie Kerry
McGuinn and ex-Stanford star,
Mike Boryla, now
quarterbaeking the Philadelphia
Eagles.
Tryouts are held in February

for the following year. Potential
Dollies learn a traditional
routine, then make up their own
routine, perform for judges, and
are interviewed by the Band.
Supposedly, with this procedure,
the girls have to demonstrate
originality as well as basic
coordination ('74-'75 Dollie
Denise Gallardo remarks, "When
you have to make up about 60
routines all by yourself, you
darn well better have some good
ideas!").
The interview started many,
many years ago in response to a
Southern Dollie who wouldn't
cooperate with the black girls in
her group. The band decided it
needed a screen against
"difficult-to-work-with" girls.
Now the interview mainly
assures that the girls can cope
with the "hang loose" band
style. As Denise told potential
Dollies at tryouts, "If you're at
all sensitive about being
flat-chested or something, forget
Dollies because the Band gives
you a lot of shit about
everything."
Build Reputation
Every year's Dollies build up
their own reputation. While the
general Dollie style could be
called a cross between pompon
and jazz dancing, each group
varies slightly. The '74-'75 group
and the '72-'73 Dollies were
considered more jazzy, while
between those two years, the
Dollies had a more classic,
pompon style. This year's group
looks like it has a good mix of
both styles.
Physically, too, each group is
different. No "typical" Dollie
exists. Ages have ranged from
sophomore to senior, and
heights have gone from tiny to
tall.

Bridgford, Terry Elms, Kathy

Every year's Dollies build up
their own reputation. While the
general Dollie style could be
called a cross between pompon
and jazz dancing, each group
varies slightly. The '74-'75 group
and the '72-'73 Dollies were
considered more jazzy, while
between those two years, the
Dollies had a more classic,
pompon style. This year's group
looks like it has a good mix of
both styles.
Physically, too, each group is
different. No "typical" Dollie
exists. Ages have ranged from
sophomore to senior, and
heights have gone from tiny to
tall.

Bridgford, Terry Elms, Kathy

HELLO DOLLIES—What's this year's crop of Dollies like? Well they're diverse. From left they are
Terry Elms, Toni Hunter, Kathy Cannell, Linda Bridgford and Bonnie McColl. The Dollies make their
home debut at the San Jose State football game on Sept. 27.
(Editor's Note: The author was a
pompon dollie last year.)
"They sure don't look like
any other pompon girls I've ever
seen!"
"Typical dumb blondes . . .
what a bunch of puffheads!"
"I think the tall one is the
linebacker's girlfriend."
"They're obviously all
pre-weds, here for their M.R.S.
degrees."
"How can anyone exploit
themselves like that?"
"Who cares about the
football team? I come here to
watch them and the Band!"
"I'll say one thing — they
sure know how to dance!"
"Those girls have no dancing
talent whatsoever — they're just
down there to look pretty."
"I never knew that bodies
could . . . could . . . could wiggle
like that!"
Traditional Enemies
No one agrees on anything
about the Stanford Dollies.
Traditional enemies to women's
libbers and darlings of the frats,
everything has been said about
this group. Whatever you've
heard about them is probably
true: Dollies have been as

diversified as any other group of
Stanford students.
One thing Dollies are not are
traditional cheerleaders. They're
the only Pacific-8 group which is
not a spirit organization; instead,
they belong to the Band.
Consequently, Dollies have
different functions than spirit
groups from any other school.
Terry Bowman, '74-'75 Dollie
explains, "Alumni and coaches
ask us to lead cheers and appear
at all the athletic events; but
we're not cheerleaders, we're
dancers. We go where the band
goes."
Also unlike other groups,
Dollies can only be Dollies for
one year. "When you practice 50
hours a week in the fall, you can
only take it for one year," says
ex-Dollie Loretta Churchill.
"You burn out after that."
Public Exposure
Even though their tenures last
only a year, continuous public
exposure brings out various
myths about the group. The
Band's tendency to exaggerate
results in some pretty wild tales.
A few such stories have given
Dollies a racy reputation. Years
ago, for instance, the Band used
to "serenade" each Dollie at her

campus residence before games
and one particular Dollie would
dance naked in front of her
Roth House window for the
Band.
Most Dollies, though, break
the traditional stereotype. A
large percentage of them have
gone on to graduate schools,
including the Stanford Law and
Med schools. One of last year's
Dollies has become a Daily
photographer. Another '74-'75
Dollie, Denise Gallardo, entered
and won the Miss Redwood City
pageant.
Love To Dance
With such broad range of
backgrounds, what do these girls
have in common? How and why
do Dollies become Dollies? Most
will answer that they love to
dance. Other factors include the
desire to meet people, the desire
to have an outlet away from the
academic grind, love of the
Band, of boyfriends on the
football team. The most notable
Dolly romance resulted in the
marriage of '72-'73 Dollie Kerry
McGuinn and ex-Stanford star,
Mike Boryla, now
quarterbaeking the Philadelphia
Eagles.
Tryouts are held in February

for the following year. Potential
Dollies learn a traditional
routine, then make up their own
routine, perform for judges, and
are interviewed by the Band.
Supposedly, with this procedure,
the girls have to demonstrate
originality as well as basic
coordination ('74-'75 Dollie
Denise Gallardo remarks, "When
you have to make up about 60
routines all by yourself, you
darn well better have some good
ideas!").
The interview started many,
many years ago in response to a
Southern Dollie who wouldn't
cooperate with the black girls in
her group. The band decided it
needed a screen against
"difficult-to-work-with" girls.
Now the interview mainly
assures that the girls can cope
with the "hang loose" band
style. As Denise told potential
Dollies at tryouts, "If you're at
all sensitive about being
flat-chested or something, forget
Dollies because the Band gives
you a lot of shit about
everything."

Dollies learn a traditional
routine, then make up their own
routine, perform for judges, and
are interviewed by the Band.
Supposedly, with this procedure,
the girls have to demonstrate
originality as well as basic
coordination ('74-'75 Dollie
Denise Gallardo remarks, "When
you have to make up about 60
routines all by yourself, you
darn well better have some good
ideas!").
The interview started many,
many years ago in response to a
Southern Dollie who wouldn't
cooperate with the black girls in
her group. The band decided it
needed a screen against
"difficult-to-work-with" girls.
Now the interview mainly
assures that the girls can cope
with the "hang loose" band
style. As Denise told potential
Dollies at tryouts, "If you're at
all sensitive about being
flat-chested or something, forget
Dollies because the Band gives
you a lot of shit about
everything."
Build Reputation
Every year's Dollies build up
their own reputation. While the
general Dollie style could be
called a cross between pompon
and jazz dancing, each group
varies slightly. The '74-'75 group
and the '72-'73 Dollies were
considered more jazzy, while
between those two years, the
Dollies had a more classic,
pompon style. This year's group
looks like it has a good mix of
both styles.
Physically, too, each group is
different. No "typical" Dollie
exists. Ages have ranged from
sophomore to senior, and
heights have gone from tiny to
tall.

HELLO DOLLIES—What's this year's crop of Dollies like? Well they're diverse. From left they are
Terry Elms, Toni Hunter, Kathy Cannell, Linda Bridgford and Bonnie McColl. The Dollies make their
home debut at the San Jose State football game on Sept. 27.
(Editor's Note: The author was a
pompon dollie last year.)
"They sure don't look like
any other pompon girls I've ever
seen!"
"Typical dumb blondes . . .
what a bunch of puffheads!"
"I think the tall one is the
linebacker's girlfriend."
"They're obviously all
pre-weds, here for their M.R.S.
degrees."
"How can anyone exploit
themselves like that?"
"Who cares about the
football team? I come here to
watch them and the Band!"
"I'll say one thing — they
sure know how to dance!"
"Those girls have no dancing
talent whatsoever — they're just
down there to look pretty."
"I never knew that bodies
could . . . could . . . could wiggle
like that!"
Traditional Enemies
No one agrees on anything
about the Stanford Dollies.
Traditional enemies to women's
libbers and darlings of the frats,
everything has been said about
this group. Whatever you've
heard about them is probably
true: Dollies have been as

diversified as any other group of
Stanford students.
One thing Dollies are not are
traditional cheerleaders. They're
the only Pacific-8 group which is
not a spirit organization; instead,
they belong to the Band.
Consequently, Dollies have
different functions than spirit
groups from any other school.
Terry Bowman, '74-'75 Dollie
explains, "Alumni and coaches
ask us to lead cheers and appear
at all the athletic events; but
we're not cheerleaders, we're
dancers. We go where the band
goes."
Also unlike other groups,
Dollies can only be Dollies for
one year. "When you practice 50
hours a week in the fall, you can
only take it for one year," says
ex-Dollie Loretta Churchill.
"You burn out after that."
Public Exposure
Even though their tenures last
only a year, continuous public
exposure brings out various
myths about the group. The
Band's tendency to exaggerate
results in some pretty wild tales.
A few such stories have given
Dollies a racy reputation. Years
ago, for instance, the Band used
to "serenade" each Dollie at her

campus residence before games
and one particular Dollie would
dance naked in front of her
Roth House window for the
Band.
Most Dollies, though, break
the traditional stereotype. A
large percentage of them have
gone on to graduate schools,
including the Stanford Law and
Med schools. One of last year's
Dollies has become a Daily
photographer. Another '74-'75
Dollie, Denise Gallardo, entered
and won the Miss Redwood City
pageant.
Love To Dance
With such broad range of
backgrounds, what do these girls
have in common? How and why
do Dollies become Dollies? Most
will answer that they love to
dance. Other factors include the
desire to meet people, the desire
to have an outlet away from the
academic grind, love of the
Band, of boyfriends on the
football team. The most notable
Dolly romance resulted in the
marriage of '72-'73 Dollie Kerry
McGuinn and ex-Stanford star,
Mike Boryla, now
quarterbaeking the Philadelphia
Eagles.
