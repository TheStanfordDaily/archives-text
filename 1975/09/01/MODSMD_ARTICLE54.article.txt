# Don't Ignore Card Soccer

### CHRIS BAKER 
The Stanford soccer team
should have a semantics
professor or at least an
economist for a coach.
In the course of just two
months last spring, Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz demoted the
booters from a varsity sport to a
varsity club sport and back
again, saying the latter move was
"purely a question of
semantics." Translation — Ruetz
cut the soccer budget from
$7100 to $4100 for this season.
If all this is confusing to you,
it should be. But one thing
shouldn't be confusing —
Stanford's going to have an
awfully good soccer team this
year.
Coach Fred Priddle, who is
not an economist or a semantics
professor, will have a solid
nucleus of 11 returning
lettermen, the highest number in
Stanford history.
"We should have a fine
season," exclaimed Priddle. The
talent is certainly there to back
up his claim. Fullback

MacTaylor, a two-time All-West
coast Intercollegiate Soccer
League pick, returns to lead the
Cards. Taylor is an experienced
booter; having gained valuable
experience on a team that
toured South America in the
summer of 1974. And they'll be

some pretty impressive company
backing him up.
Senior mid-fielders Marly
Glickfield and Phil Wright, both
second team all-conference picks
last year, will add scoring punch.
Wright led the Cards in scoring,
with eight goals last season.
Bruce Mosbacher, last year's
MVP, returns to the nets this
year. He was an honorable
mention all-conference pick at
goalie last year.
And mid-fielders Robby
Robb and Jim Stokes, both
honorable mention
all-conference picks, return to
give the Cards a solid nucleus.
Stokes and Taylor make up a
sturdy defensive center.
The halfback spot will be
strong with three returning
three-time iettermen. Marty
Glickfield, Robb and Wright
make up the center of the Cards
4-44 attack.
The forward lineup will be
improved by the return of Brian
Bershader, who took last fall
quarter off to study at
California.

TRAILING TAYLOR—Mac Taylor, Stanford's All-League fullback, trails this San Jose State player in
a game last year. Taylor returns to lead the booters again this year.
