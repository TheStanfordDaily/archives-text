# DiBiaso Brings New Style To Card Cagers
## 
### MIKE TOLLIN A dead week dream 
It's basketball season and a
standing room only crowd is
jammed into Maples Pavilion,
chanting "Dee-fense, Dee-fensc."
A Stanford guard (say a
freshman guard named Wolfe)
responds with a steal and leads a
fjerfect fast break that ends in a
bucket. The Cardinals quickly
set up their full-court press,
while the crowd goes bonkers.
And all this at a mid-season
game against Washington State.
Surely, you say, this writer
has gone batty, having pre-finals
delusions. But wait, there's
more.
There's a handsome, young
man parading along the sidelines
under the guise of Stanford's
head basketball coach. He's
screaming, cajoling, grimacing,
cheering, jumping up and down.
His players are fired up — diving
for loose balls, battling for
offensive rebounds, clawing and
scratching on defense. The
reserves are up on their feet,
waving their warmups and
shouting encouragement to their
teammates. If you didn't know
any better, you'd think you
were at a WAC game, or heaven
forbid, McArthur Pit in Eugene.
Absurd? Maybe.
New Brand
But be advised — next winter,
this hallowed University might
just be turned on its ear by a
new brand of Cardinal
basketball. And it's possible that
Stanford fans will finally
discover that basketball really
can be exciting even if you're
not beating UCLA.
For next year, The New

Regime takes over. Dick
Dißiaso, named head basketball
coach here nearly five months
ago, has promised there will be
changes. He's been heard
muttering words such as
enthusiasm, hustle and crowd
participation. True, there's no
talk of championships yet, but
Dißiaso is determined to turn
out an exciting product that will
transform Maples into a
peninsular haven for
pandemonium.
Dißiaso came to Stanford
straight from Notre Dame,
where he worked with head
coach Digger Phelps. He and
Phelps have been confidantes
since the days in Beacon, N.Y.
when they'd send their wives to
the kitchen and ta'k basketball
into the wee hears of the
morning.
'Work Togethei
"It was a natural thing for us
to work together," Dißiaso said
over breakfast. "We've
influenced each other a great
deal and our styles and
philosophies of coaching are
very similar."
Anyone who has seen the
Fighting Irish in the last few
years should have a general idea
of what to expect from the New
Cards. That is in style, not
talent.
"Ideally," Dißiaso said, "I'd
like to press and fast break as
much as possible. But of course

how much of that we do
depends upon the ability of our
players.
'I haven't had a chance yet
to look at last year's game
films," he explained, "but we
have seven returning scholarship
athletes and they must have
been doing something right to
beat UCLA and USC on
successive nights."
Dißiaso is not fooled by the
Maples Miracle, however. He
knows there is a lot to be done
before Stanford is a legitimate
Pac-8 contender, and he is
acutely aware of the obstacles
Stanford presents for recruiting.
But he thinks they can be
overcome.
"I wouldn't have taken the
job and convinced two men
[Asst. Coaches Bob Frederick
and Tom McLaughlin] to join
me if I didn't think it could be
done here," he said. "Stanford
has an awful lot to sell itself on
and I believe we can get some
good players to come here." In
one month, Dißiaso signed three
blue chip recruits, two of whom
[6-foot-2 Wolfe Perry and
6-foot-6V£ George Schader]
should start next year.
The Cards will have just one
starter back from last year's
12-14 squad, and the big guy
from Menlo Park, who was last
seen buying Cannonball
Adderley LPs and trying to find
out what the Mardi Gras really
is, will be tough to replace.
But remember, the Irish were
6-20 the first year Phelps and
Dißiaso were in South Bend, and
people were still telling him
Notre Dame was a football
school, that basketball could
never make it in the land of
Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy.
But attendance steadily grew,
and two years later Notre Dame
was 26-3 and Ara Parseghian was
sending his football recruits to
watch the basketball games.
Admittedly, the odds are
steeper at Stanford, but Dißiaso
seems to relish the challenge.
"Wouldn't it be something if we
could become the first great
academic institution to win a
championship?" he said.
One gets the feeling that if
it's possible, Dißiaso is the man
to do it. He's dynamic, he's
energetic and he makes things
happen.
So hang on folks, basketball
is coming back to Stanford.

offensive rebounds, clawing and
scratching on defense. The
reserves are up on their feet,
waving their warmups and
shouting encouragement to their
teammates. If you didn't know
any better, you'd think you
were at a WAC game, or heaven
forbid, McArthur Pit in Eugene.
Absurd? Maybe.
New Brand
But be advised — next winter,
this hallowed University might
just be turned on its ear by a
new brand of Cardinal
basketball. And it's possible that
Stanford fans will finally
discover that basketball really
can be exciting even if you're
not beating UCLA.
For next year, The New

Regime takes over. Dick
Dißiaso, named head basketball
coach here nearly five months
ago, has promised there will be
changes. He's been heard
muttering words such as
enthusiasm, hustle and crowd
participation. True, there's no
talk of championships yet, but
Dißiaso is determined to turn
out an exciting product that will
transform Maples into a
peninsular haven for
pandemonium.
Dißiaso came to Stanford
straight from Notre Dame,
where he worked with head
coach Digger Phelps. He and
Phelps have been confidantes
since the days in Beacon, N.Y.
when they'd send their wives to
the kitchen and ta'k basketball
into the wee hears of the
morning.
'Work Togethei
"It was a natural thing for us
to work together," Dißiaso said
over breakfast. "We've
influenced each other a great
deal and our styles and
philosophies of coaching are
very similar."
Anyone who has seen the
Fighting Irish in the last few
years should have a general idea
of what to expect from the New
Cards. That is in style, not
talent.
"Ideally," Dißiaso said, "I'd
like to press and fast break as
much as possible. But of course

how much of that we do
depends upon the ability of our
players.
'I haven't had a chance yet
to look at last year's game
films," he explained, "but we
have seven returning scholarship
athletes and they must have
been doing something right to
beat UCLA and USC on
successive nights."
Dißiaso is not fooled by the
Maples Miracle, however. He
knows there is a lot to be done
before Stanford is a legitimate
Pac-8 contender, and he is
acutely aware of the obstacles
Stanford presents for recruiting.
But he thinks they can be
overcome.
"I wouldn't have taken the
job and convinced two men
[Asst. Coaches Bob Frederick
and Tom McLaughlin] to join
me if I didn't think it could be
done here," he said. "Stanford
has an awful lot to sell itself on
and I believe we can get some
good players to come here." In
one month, Dißiaso signed three
blue chip recruits, two of whom
[6-foot-2 Wolfe Perry and
6-foot-6V£ George Schader]
should start next year.
The Cards will have just one
starter back from last year's
12-14 squad, and the big guy
from Menlo Park, who was last
seen buying Cannonball
Adderley LPs and trying to find
out what the Mardi Gras really
is, will be tough to replace.
But remember, the Irish were
6-20 the first year Phelps and
Dißiaso were in South Bend, and
people were still telling him
Notre Dame was a football
school, that basketball could
never make it in the land of
Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy.
But attendance steadily grew,
and two years later Notre Dame
was 26-3 and Ara Parseghian was
sending his football recruits to
watch the basketball games.
Admittedly, the odds are
steeper at Stanford, but Dißiaso
seems to relish the challenge.
"Wouldn't it be something if we
could become the first great
academic institution to win a
championship?" he said.
One gets the feeling that if
it's possible, Dißiaso is the man
to do it. He's dynamic, he's
energetic and he makes things
happen.
So hang on folks, basketball
is coming back to Stanford.
It's basketball season and a
standing room only crowd is
jammed into Maples Pavilion,
chanting "Dee-fense, Dee-fensc."
A Stanford guard (say a
freshman guard named Wolfe)
responds with a steal and leads a
fjerfect fast break that ends in a
bucket. The Cardinals quickly
set up their full-court press,
while the crowd goes bonkers.
And all this at a mid-season
game against Washington State.
Surely, you say, this writer
has gone batty, having pre-finals
delusions. But wait, there's
more.
There's a handsome, young
man parading along the sidelines
under the guise of Stanford's
head basketball coach. He's
screaming, cajoling, grimacing,
cheering, jumping up and down.
His players are fired up — diving

talk of championships yet, but
Dißiaso is determined to turn
out an exciting product that will
transform Maples into a
peninsular haven for
pandemonium.
Dißiaso came to Stanford
straight from Notre Dame,
where he worked with head
coach Digger Phelps. He and
Phelps have been confidantes
since the days in Beacon, N.Y.
when they'd send their wives to
the kitchen and ta'k basketball
into the wee hears of the
morning.
'Work Togethei
"It was a natural thing for us
to work together," Dißiaso said
over breakfast. "We've
influenced each other a great
deal and our styles and
philosophies of coaching are
very similar."
Anyone who has seen the
Fighting Irish in the last few
years should have a general idea
of what to expect from the New
Cards. That is in style, not
talent.
"Ideally," Dißiaso said, "I'd
like to press and fast break as
much as possible. But of course

how much of that we do
depends upon the ability of our
players.
'I haven't had a chance yet
to look at last year's game
films," he explained, "but we
have seven returning scholarship
athletes and they must have
been doing something right to
beat UCLA and USC on
successive nights."
Dißiaso is not fooled by the
Maples Miracle, however. He
knows there is a lot to be done
before Stanford is a legitimate
Pac-8 contender, and he is
acutely aware of the obstacles
Stanford presents for recruiting.
But he thinks they can be
overcome.
"I wouldn't have taken the
job and convinced two men
[Asst. Coaches Bob Frederick
and Tom McLaughlin] to join
me if I didn't think it could be
done here," he said. "Stanford
has an awful lot to sell itself on
and I believe we can get some
good players to come here." In
one month, Dißiaso signed three
blue chip recruits, two of whom
[6-foot-2 Wolfe Perry and
6-foot-6V£ George Schader]
should start next year.
The Cards will have just one
starter back from last year's
12-14 squad, and the big guy
from Menlo Park, who was last
seen buying Cannonball
Adderley LPs and trying to find
out what the Mardi Gras really
is, will be tough to replace.
But remember, the Irish were
6-20 the first year Phelps and
Dißiaso were in South Bend, and
people were still telling him
Notre Dame was a football
school, that basketball could
never make it in the land of
Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy.
But attendance steadily grew,
and two years later Notre Dame
was 26-3 and Ara Parseghian was
sending his football recruits to
watch the basketball games.
Admittedly, the odds are
steeper at Stanford, but Dißiaso
seems to relish the challenge.
"Wouldn't it be something if we
could become the first great
academic institution to win a
championship?" he said.
One gets the feeling that if
it's possible, Dißiaso is the man
to do it. He's dynamic, he's
energetic and he makes things
happen.
So hang on folks, basketball
is coming back to Stanford.
It's basketball season and a
standing room only crowd is
jammed into Maples Pavilion,
chanting "Dee-fense, Dee-fensc."
A Stanford guard (say a
freshman guard named Wolfe)
responds with a steal and leads a
fjerfect fast break that ends in a
bucket. The Cardinals quickly
set up their full-court press,
while the crowd goes bonkers.
And all this at a mid-season
game against Washington State.
Surely, you say, this writer
has gone batty, having pre-finals
delusions. But wait, there's
more.
There's a handsome, young
man parading along the sidelines
under the guise of Stanford's
head basketball coach. He's
screaming, cajoling, grimacing,
cheering, jumping up and down.
His players are fired up — diving
for loose balls, battling for
offensive rebounds, clawing and
scratching on defense. The
reserves are up on their feet,
waving their warmups and
shouting encouragement to their
teammates. If you didn't know
any better, you'd think you
were at a WAC game, or heaven
forbid, McArthur Pit in Eugene.
Absurd? Maybe.
New Brand
But be advised — next winter,
this hallowed University might
just be turned on its ear by a
new brand of Cardinal
basketball. And it's possible that
Stanford fans will finally
discover that basketball really
can be exciting even if you're
not beating UCLA.
For next year, The New

Regime takes over. Dick
Dißiaso, named head basketball
coach here nearly five months
ago, has promised there will be
changes. He's been heard
muttering words such as
enthusiasm, hustle and crowd
participation. True, there's no
talk of championships yet, but
Dißiaso is determined to turn
out an exciting product that will
transform Maples into a
peninsular haven for
pandemonium.
