# Runners Eye Pac-8 Title
## 
### 
If the Stanford cross country
team were in another
conference, then it might have
won the NCAA cross country
crown the last three years. As it
stands now, the Cards are still in
the Pac-8, the toughest cross
country conference in the
nation, and they've finished
fourth the last three years.
But Card mentor Marshall
Clark doesn't let the past bother
him. The veteran coach, who
enters his eighth year on The
Farm, has been there before.
Coming to Stanford in 1968,
Clark met with instant success,
guiding his team to an
undefeated season and a second
place finish in the NCAA
championships. Now Clark looks
to the immediate future, and
what a rosy one it is.
Jack Bellah and Tony
Sandoval, Stanford's all-time
cross country kings, return to
anchor the lungbusters. Sandoval
won the Pac-8 southern division
title last year, clocking a 28:56.6
to rank second on the all-time
Stanford six mile list. Bellah
finished 11th in the Pac-8 cross
country championships last year,

setting a Stanford record of
28:56 (six miles) in the process.
And Roy Kissen, one of the
best high school distancemen in
the nation, will join the duo.
Kissen was a member of the
American junior cross country
team that captured the world
championship in Rabat,
Morocco in March. He was
named Northern California
Runner of the Year in 1974.
Kissen has a best of 29:21.1 in
the six mile and 8:56.2 in the

two mile. Another top recruit is
Jerry Emory of Palo Alto's
Gunn High School. Emory is a
two-time All-Nor Cal cross
country runner. He has a
lifetime best of 9:06.2 in the
two mile run.
But as Clark is quick to point
out, "it takes five men to score
in cross country." Well he'll have
a lot of people to choose from
to round out the squad, but
unfortunately none of them
have times under 30:00.
The most promising of the
bunch is sophomore Stacy
Geiken. Geiken came on strong
at the beginning of last year's
track season before nagging
injuries hampered him. He has a
best of 31:47 in the six mile.
Senior Art Brown has the third
best time on the team (30:02)
and Clark expects him to make
some valuable contributions.
Jeff Parietti was the surprise of
the 1975 Card track team and
Clark is counting on him to
come through with some good
performances. He has a best of
30:05 over six miles.

And Roy Kissen, one of the
best high school distancemen in
the nation, will join the duo.
Kissen was a member of the
American junior cross country
team that captured the world
championship in Rabat,
Morocco in March. He was
named Northern California
Runner of the Year in 1974.
Kissen has a best of 29:21.1 in
the six mile and 8:56.2 in the

two mile. Another top recruit is
Jerry Emory of Palo Alto's
Gunn High School. Emory is a
two-time All-Nor Cal cross
country runner. He has a
lifetime best of 9:06.2 in the
two mile run.
But as Clark is quick to point
out, "it takes five men to score
in cross country." Well he'll have
a lot of people to choose from
to round out the squad, but
unfortunately none of them
have times under 30:00.
The most promising of the
bunch is sophomore Stacy
Geiken. Geiken came on strong
at the beginning of last year's
track season before nagging
injuries hampered him. He has a
best of 31:47 in the six mile.
Senior Art Brown has the third
best time on the team (30:02)
and Clark expects him to make
some valuable contributions.
Jeff Parietti was the surprise of
the 1975 Card track team and
Clark is counting on him to
come through with some good
performances. He has a best of
30:05 over six miles.

SPREAD EAGLE—Center Tim Patterson (55) will have to learn a
new system under new basketball coach Dick Dißiaso. The
6-foot-ll Patterson will be in a starting role this season, after
backing up Rich Kelley for the past three years.
If the Stanford cross country
team were in another
conference, then it might have
won the NCAA cross country
crown the last three years. As it
stands now, the Cards are still in
the Pac-8, the toughest cross
country conference in the
nation, and they've finished
fourth the last three years.
But Card mentor Marshall
Clark doesn't let the past bother
him. The veteran coach, who
enters his eighth year on The
Farm, has been there before.
Coming to Stanford in 1968,
Clark met with instant success,
guiding his team to an
undefeated season and a second
place finish in the NCAA
championships. Now Clark looks
to the immediate future, and
what a rosy one it is.
Jack Bellah and Tony
Sandoval, Stanford's all-time
cross country kings, return to
anchor the lungbusters. Sandoval
won the Pac-8 southern division
title last year, clocking a 28:56.6
to rank second on the all-time
Stanford six mile list. Bellah
finished 11th in the Pac-8 cross
country championships last year,

setting a Stanford record of
28:56 (six miles) in the process.
