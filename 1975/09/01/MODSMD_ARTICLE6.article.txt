# From Jordan To Lyman: Farm To University
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
The most prestigious administrative position at
Stanford is that of president of the University. The
president is in the uniquely powerful position of being
responsible for major decisions, and most of those
decisions are approved by the Board of Trustees.
Stanford's seven presidents, besides occupying
prestigious roles at the University, have been important
men in their own right.
David Starr Jordan, first president of the University,
was appointed by Leland Stanford and served from 1891
until 1913. He was young — 40 — at the time of his
appointment, and had until that time been president of
Indiana University. He was also a world famous
ichthyologist, and, according to University Relations Editor
Peter Allen, his textbook is still in use.
"Jordan set the whole tone for the University," says
Allen. "He established the elective system, the minimum
requirement system, and saw to it that Stanford was a true
University with research and graduate work."
Educationally Undeveloped
Allen says that such a task was difficult in that "the
West was undeveloped educationally" compared to
Eastern institutions.
He was also responsible for choosing the first faculty,
and chose people interested in both teaching and research:
"the standard for succeeding appointments," says Allen.
And as chancellor, the title given to all past Presidents if
they remain with the University, Allen says Jordan was
"an ardent crusader for peace — a humanitarian."
Right Hand Man
John Casper Branner, before succeeding Jordan, had
been his "right hand man," says Chief University Librarian
Ralph Hansen, and was given the presidency when Jordan
retired in 1913.
Allen says that Branner was to be president only until
1915, as he had stipulated that the mandatory retirement
age be honored. He was 63 at the time of his appointment,
and wanted only to be an interim president while the
search went on for another.
Hansen says that Branner's major decision while
President was to "marry" Cooper Medical College in San
Francisco with Stanford. Cooper had become the nucleus
of Stanford University medicine, and its upkeep was
causing the University financial problems — a merger
seemed natural. With the merger, Cooper "died."
Branner came to Stanford as an "imminent geologist,"
says Allen, and had done extensive work in South
America. Today the University has Branner Hall in his

honor.
Longest Tenure
Ray Lyman Wilbur, himself a Stanford graduate in
1895, had the longest tenure of any president, from 1916
to 1929 and then 1933 to 1943. Robert Eckles Swain was
acting president during Wilbur's absence.
Allen says that Wilbur was considered an "austere, but
not humorless man. He could work and listen to people at
the same time," a fact rather disconcerting to office
visitors who didn't know the man's working habits.
At that time, the office of the presidency consisted
only of the president and two secretaries. Allen says that
Wilbur was "quick at making decisions — there was no
need for a large organization."
According to Hansen, Wilbur's major contribution to
the University was the abandonment of Jordan's
departmental system; he created schools instead (i.e. the
School of Humanities and Sciences). Allen adds that
Wilbur "weathered World War I and the Depression, the
displacement of men and the lack of money."
Tuition
Tuition was instated under Wilbur's tenure — the
University had originally been tuition-free. It was small,
but it helped. He also started a formal fundraising
campaign, called the "First Million for Stanford," to
improve faculty salaries.
Wilbur was also a respected and influential physician.
Before accepting the job of president, he was dean of the
Stanford Medical School.
Editors of the Wilbur Memoirs, Edgar Eugene Robinson
and Paul Carroll Edwards write that as president, Wilbur
promoted "high scholastic attainment among students
through the Independent Study Plan, Lower Division
honors, and graduation honors... Growth of research
facilities in departments, in the University libraries,
including the Hoover Library [now the Hoover
Institution], in the Food Research Institute at the
Hopkins Marine Station were encouraged."
Today, Wilbur Hall dormitory is named after him.
Tresidder
Donald Bertrand Tresidder was the University's fourth
president, from 1943 until his sudden death in 1948.
Tresidder had a Stanford M.D. degree, but didn't
practice. He was an aviator, a great outdoorsman, and was
president of the company that ran Yosemite National
Park.
Allen says that "Tresidder's problems were seeing the
University through [WWI] and then rebuilding afterwards.
He had to handle an onslaught of students [after the war J;

the enrollment burgeoned. Many special efforts were
needed to handle the students, and the plant was run down
because of deferred war maintenance."
Hansen adds that during this difficult time, he simply
"held the University together."
Sororities Banned
Allen says that one of the most "traumatic" decisions
that was made during Tresidder's tenure was the ending of
sororities. He explains that it was "traumatic" for alumni,
but "the decision was instigated by sorority women."
Stanford's Tresidder Memorial Union was built in his
memory.
John Ewart Wallace Sterling took over after Tresidder's
death, and stayed with the presidency until 1968.
Transformation
Allen says that Sterling's major contribution was the
transformation of Stanford University "from a good West
Coast school into a first class research institution."
He adds that at the time of Sterling's tenure, "the
government wanted to fund more research, and more
money was available from private funds. Sterling, along
with then-provost [Frederick E.] Terman, made the most
of the opportunity and brought Stanford to today's level
of Harvard, Yale, and MIT."
As an attest to his fundraising abilities, the University
was given $24 million over a five-year period from the
Ford Foundation, on the condition that they match it
three to one. Through "self-help," the University was able
to raise the large sum.
To supplement Stanford's increasing needs for funds,
Sterling announced the $100 million Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era (PACE) drive, with the $25 million Ford
grant as a base. According to a Daily story, PACE,
completed in 1964, "set a new record for private support
in capital campaigns of American universities."
SRI
That same Daily story reported that when Sterling first
took office, Stanford Research Institute (SRI) was over $1
million in debt; as chairman of the SRI board, the
now-independent SRI was soon in the black.
During Sterling's time, faculty recruitments were big,
and because of that Allen says that the University got
many eminent professors: "He concentrated on the
strong departments and made them stronger, rather than
spreading to other fields."
Under Sterling's tenure, the University began its
overseas campuses in France, Italy and Germany.
SLAC
The Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) started under

Sterling's presidency. Allen says that the establishment of
such programs as that and the Medical School has led to
inter-departmental cooperation, creating other programs
such as human biology, heart implant transmitters and
other medically-related research.
Sterling resigned from the presidency at a time when
student activism was on the upswing. During that time he
encountered sit-ins and personal violence, such as a Fire
that destroyed his office.
Sterling is now chancellor and a member of the Board
of Trustees, and is co-chairman of the fundraising
Campaign for Stanford.
Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer replaced Sterling in 19G8, "in
the midst of riots and disruptions," says Allen.
Unprepared
Hansen agrees, saying that "no president was prepared
for the student reactions of the Vietnam war. There was
no precedent to base a plan of action. He got buffered by
it all, and was snowed by radical students and intellectual
gymnastics. He resigned out of frustration" in 1970.
In his letter of resignation to then Board President W.
Parmer Fuller 111, Pitzer stated that "the gulf between the
campus community and society at large has widened ...
pressures tending to distract or disrupt the educational
process have increased ... there is little confidence on
campus about our promised disengagement from the war."
Fuller replied that "among the many changes in
education and in University governance instituted during
his tenure, perhaps the increase in faculty time devoted to
undergraduates and the inclusion of students and faculty
in the decision-making process stand out. The caliber of
appointments he has made to key academic posts also has
been unusually high."
In spite of the campus disturbances, Allen credits Pitzer
with holding the University together. "The only
interference with classes on a mass basis came with
Cambodia. Research and classes had kept going, but the
disrupting activities occupied so much [press] space that it
gave a shut down impression."
ROTC Phased Out
During Pitzer's time, a faculty decision "based on
objections to course content and faculty appointments"
phased out Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), says
Allen.
Pitzer, a distinguished chemist, is now a professor at
UC-Berkeley. For his work in that field he has been
awarded the Priestly Medal, which Allen calls "the next
highest award before the Nobel Prize."
He was succeeded in 1970 by Richard Wall Lyman.

practice. He was an aviator, a great outdoorsman, and was
president of the company that ran Yosemite National
Park.
Allen says that "Tresidder's problems were seeing the
University through [WWI] and then rebuilding afterwards.
He had to handle an onslaught of students [after the war J;

the enrollment burgeoned. Many special efforts were
needed to handle the students, and the plant was run down
because of deferred war maintenance."
Hansen adds that during this difficult time, he simply
"held the University together."
Sororities Banned
Allen says that one of the most "traumatic" decisions
that was made during Tresidder's tenure was the ending of
sororities. He explains that it was "traumatic" for alumni,
but "the decision was instigated by sorority women."
Stanford's Tresidder Memorial Union was built in his
memory.
John Ewart Wallace Sterling took over after Tresidder's
death, and stayed with the presidency until 1968.
Transformation
Allen says that Sterling's major contribution was the
transformation of Stanford University "from a good West
Coast school into a first class research institution."
He adds that at the time of Sterling's tenure, "the
government wanted to fund more research, and more
money was available from private funds. Sterling, along
with then-provost [Frederick E.] Terman, made the most
of the opportunity and brought Stanford to today's level
of Harvard, Yale, and MIT."
As an attest to his fundraising abilities, the University
was given $24 million over a five-year period from the
Ford Foundation, on the condition that they match it
three to one. Through "self-help," the University was able
to raise the large sum.
To supplement Stanford's increasing needs for funds,
Sterling announced the $100 million Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era (PACE) drive, with the $25 million Ford
grant as a base. According to a Daily story, PACE,
completed in 1964, "set a new record for private support
in capital campaigns of American universities."
SRI
That same Daily story reported that when Sterling first
took office, Stanford Research Institute (SRI) was over $1
million in debt; as chairman of the SRI board, the
now-independent SRI was soon in the black.
During Sterling's time, faculty recruitments were big,
and because of that Allen says that the University got
many eminent professors: "He concentrated on the
strong departments and made them stronger, rather than
spreading to other fields."
Under Sterling's tenure, the University began its
overseas campuses in France, Italy and Germany.
SLAC
The Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) started under

Sterling's presidency. Allen says that the establishment of
such programs as that and the Medical School has led to
inter-departmental cooperation, creating other programs
such as human biology, heart implant transmitters and
other medically-related research.
Sterling resigned from the presidency at a time when
student activism was on the upswing. During that time he
encountered sit-ins and personal violence, such as a Fire
that destroyed his office.
Sterling is now chancellor and a member of the Board
of Trustees, and is co-chairman of the fundraising
Campaign for Stanford.
Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer replaced Sterling in 19G8, "in
the midst of riots and disruptions," says Allen.
Unprepared
Hansen agrees, saying that "no president was prepared
for the student reactions of the Vietnam war. There was
no precedent to base a plan of action. He got buffered by
it all, and was snowed by radical students and intellectual
gymnastics. He resigned out of frustration" in 1970.
In his letter of resignation to then Board President W.
Parmer Fuller 111, Pitzer stated that "the gulf between the
campus community and society at large has widened ...
pressures tending to distract or disrupt the educational
process have increased ... there is little confidence on
campus about our promised disengagement from the war."
Fuller replied that "among the many changes in
education and in University governance instituted during
his tenure, perhaps the increase in faculty time devoted to
undergraduates and the inclusion of students and faculty
in the decision-making process stand out. The caliber of
appointments he has made to key academic posts also has
been unusually high."
In spite of the campus disturbances, Allen credits Pitzer
with holding the University together. "The only
interference with classes on a mass basis came with
Cambodia. Research and classes had kept going, but the
disrupting activities occupied so much [press] space that it
gave a shut down impression."
ROTC Phased Out
During Pitzer's time, a faculty decision "based on
objections to course content and faculty appointments"
phased out Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), says
Allen.
Pitzer, a distinguished chemist, is now a professor at
UC-Berkeley. For his work in that field he has been
awarded the Priestly Medal, which Allen calls "the next
highest award before the Nobel Prize."
He was succeeded in 1970 by Richard Wall Lyman.

The most prestigious administrative position at
Stanford is that of president of the University. The
president is in the uniquely powerful position of being
responsible for major decisions, and most of those
decisions are approved by the Board of Trustees.
Stanford's seven presidents, besides occupying
prestigious roles at the University, have been important
men in their own right.
David Starr Jordan, first president of the University,
was appointed by Leland Stanford and served from 1891
until 1913. He was young — 40 — at the time of his
appointment, and had until that time been president of
Indiana University. He was also a world famous
ichthyologist, and, according to University Relations Editor
Peter Allen, his textbook is still in use.
"Jordan set the whole tone for the University," says
Allen. "He established the elective system, the minimum
requirement system, and saw to it that Stanford was a true
University with research and graduate work."
Educationally Undeveloped
Allen says that such a task was difficult in that "the
West was undeveloped educationally" compared to
Eastern institutions.
He was also responsible for choosing the first faculty,
and chose people interested in both teaching and research:
"the standard for succeeding appointments," says Allen.
And as chancellor, the title given to all past Presidents if
they remain with the University, Allen says Jordan was
"an ardent crusader for peace — a humanitarian."
Right Hand Man
John Casper Branner, before succeeding Jordan, had
been his "right hand man," says Chief University Librarian
Ralph Hansen, and was given the presidency when Jordan
retired in 1913.
Allen says that Branner was to be president only until
1915, as he had stipulated that the mandatory retirement
age be honored. He was 63 at the time of his appointment,
and wanted only to be an interim president while the
search went on for another.
Hansen says that Branner's major decision while
President was to "marry" Cooper Medical College in San
Francisco with Stanford. Cooper had become the nucleus
of Stanford University medicine, and its upkeep was
causing the University financial problems — a merger
seemed natural. With the merger, Cooper "died."
Branner came to Stanford as an "imminent geologist,"
says Allen, and had done extensive work in South
America. Today the University has Branner Hall in his

honor.
Longest Tenure
Ray Lyman Wilbur, himself a Stanford graduate in
1895, had the longest tenure of any president, from 1916
to 1929 and then 1933 to 1943. Robert Eckles Swain was
acting president during Wilbur's absence.
Allen says that Wilbur was considered an "austere, but
not humorless man. He could work and listen to people at
the same time," a fact rather disconcerting to office
visitors who didn't know the man's working habits.
At that time, the office of the presidency consisted
only of the president and two secretaries. Allen says that
Wilbur was "quick at making decisions — there was no
need for a large organization."
According to Hansen, Wilbur's major contribution to
the University was the abandonment of Jordan's
departmental system; he created schools instead (i.e. the
School of Humanities and Sciences). Allen adds that
Wilbur "weathered World War I and the Depression, the
displacement of men and the lack of money."
Tuition
Tuition was instated under Wilbur's tenure — the
University had originally been tuition-free. It was small,
but it helped. He also started a formal fundraising
campaign, called the "First Million for Stanford," to
improve faculty salaries.
Wilbur was also a respected and influential physician.
Before accepting the job of president, he was dean of the
Stanford Medical School.
Editors of the Wilbur Memoirs, Edgar Eugene Robinson
and Paul Carroll Edwards write that as president, Wilbur
promoted "high scholastic attainment among students
through the Independent Study Plan, Lower Division
honors, and graduation honors... Growth of research
facilities in departments, in the University libraries,
including the Hoover Library [now the Hoover
Institution], in the Food Research Institute at the
Hopkins Marine Station were encouraged."
Today, Wilbur Hall dormitory is named after him.
Tresidder
Donald Bertrand Tresidder was the University's fourth
president, from 1943 until his sudden death in 1948.
Tresidder had a Stanford M.D. degree, but didn't
practice. He was an aviator, a great outdoorsman, and was
president of the company that ran Yosemite National
Park.
Allen says that "Tresidder's problems were seeing the
University through [WWI] and then rebuilding afterwards.

with holding the University together. "The only
interference with classes on a mass basis came with
Cambodia. Research and classes had kept going, but the
disrupting activities occupied so much [press] space that it
gave a shut down impression."
ROTC Phased Out
During Pitzer's time, a faculty decision "based on
objections to course content and faculty appointments"
phased out Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), says
Allen.
Pitzer, a distinguished chemist, is now a professor at
UC-Berkeley. For his work in that field he has been
awarded the Priestly Medal, which Allen calls "the next
highest award before the Nobel Prize."
He was succeeded in 1970 by Richard Wall Lyman.

The most prestigious administrative position at
Stanford is that of president of the University. The
president is in the uniquely powerful position of being
responsible for major decisions, and most of those
decisions are approved by the Board of Trustees.
Stanford's seven presidents, besides occupying
prestigious roles at the University, have been important
men in their own right.
David Starr Jordan, first president of the University,
was appointed by Leland Stanford and served from 1891
until 1913. He was young — 40 — at the time of his
appointment, and had until that time been president of
Indiana University. He was also a world famous
ichthyologist, and, according to University Relations Editor
Peter Allen, his textbook is still in use.
"Jordan set the whole tone for the University," says
Allen. "He established the elective system, the minimum
requirement system, and saw to it that Stanford was a true
University with research and graduate work."
Educationally Undeveloped
Allen says that such a task was difficult in that "the
West was undeveloped educationally" compared to
Eastern institutions.
He was also responsible for choosing the first faculty,
and chose people interested in both teaching and research:
"the standard for succeeding appointments," says Allen.
And as chancellor, the title given to all past Presidents if
they remain with the University, Allen says Jordan was
"an ardent crusader for peace — a humanitarian."
Right Hand Man
John Casper Branner, before succeeding Jordan, had
been his "right hand man," says Chief University Librarian
Ralph Hansen, and was given the presidency when Jordan
retired in 1913.
Allen says that Branner was to be president only until
1915, as he had stipulated that the mandatory retirement
age be honored. He was 63 at the time of his appointment,
and wanted only to be an interim president while the
search went on for another.
Hansen says that Branner's major decision while
President was to "marry" Cooper Medical College in San
Francisco with Stanford. Cooper had become the nucleus
of Stanford University medicine, and its upkeep was
causing the University financial problems — a merger
seemed natural. With the merger, Cooper "died."
Branner came to Stanford as an "imminent geologist,"
says Allen, and had done extensive work in South
America. Today the University has Branner Hall in his

honor.
Longest Tenure
Ray Lyman Wilbur, himself a Stanford graduate in
1895, had the longest tenure of any president, from 1916
to 1929 and then 1933 to 1943. Robert Eckles Swain was
acting president during Wilbur's absence.
Allen says that Wilbur was considered an "austere, but
not humorless man. He could work and listen to people at
the same time," a fact rather disconcerting to office
visitors who didn't know the man's working habits.
At that time, the office of the presidency consisted
only of the president and two secretaries. Allen says that
Wilbur was "quick at making decisions — there was no
need for a large organization."
According to Hansen, Wilbur's major contribution to
the University was the abandonment of Jordan's
departmental system; he created schools instead (i.e. the
School of Humanities and Sciences). Allen adds that
Wilbur "weathered World War I and the Depression, the
displacement of men and the lack of money."
Tuition
Tuition was instated under Wilbur's tenure — the
University had originally been tuition-free. It was small,
but it helped. He also started a formal fundraising
campaign, called the "First Million for Stanford," to
improve faculty salaries.
Wilbur was also a respected and influential physician.
Before accepting the job of president, he was dean of the
Stanford Medical School.
Editors of the Wilbur Memoirs, Edgar Eugene Robinson
and Paul Carroll Edwards write that as president, Wilbur
promoted "high scholastic attainment among students
through the Independent Study Plan, Lower Division
honors, and graduation honors... Growth of research
facilities in departments, in the University libraries,
including the Hoover Library [now the Hoover
Institution], in the Food Research Institute at the
Hopkins Marine Station were encouraged."
Today, Wilbur Hall dormitory is named after him.
Tresidder
Donald Bertrand Tresidder was the University's fourth
president, from 1943 until his sudden death in 1948.
Tresidder had a Stanford M.D. degree, but didn't
practice. He was an aviator, a great outdoorsman, and was
president of the company that ran Yosemite National
Park.
Allen says that "Tresidder's problems were seeing the
University through [WWI] and then rebuilding afterwards.
He had to handle an onslaught of students [after the war J;

the enrollment burgeoned. Many special efforts were
needed to handle the students, and the plant was run down
because of deferred war maintenance."
Hansen adds that during this difficult time, he simply
"held the University together."
Sororities Banned
Allen says that one of the most "traumatic" decisions
that was made during Tresidder's tenure was the ending of
sororities. He explains that it was "traumatic" for alumni,
but "the decision was instigated by sorority women."
Stanford's Tresidder Memorial Union was built in his
memory.
John Ewart Wallace Sterling took over after Tresidder's
death, and stayed with the presidency until 1968.
Transformation
Allen says that Sterling's major contribution was the
transformation of Stanford University "from a good West
Coast school into a first class research institution."
He adds that at the time of Sterling's tenure, "the
government wanted to fund more research, and more
money was available from private funds. Sterling, along
with then-provost [Frederick E.] Terman, made the most
of the opportunity and brought Stanford to today's level
of Harvard, Yale, and MIT."
As an attest to his fundraising abilities, the University
was given $24 million over a five-year period from the
Ford Foundation, on the condition that they match it
three to one. Through "self-help," the University was able
to raise the large sum.
To supplement Stanford's increasing needs for funds,
Sterling announced the $100 million Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era (PACE) drive, with the $25 million Ford
grant as a base. According to a Daily story, PACE,
completed in 1964, "set a new record for private support
in capital campaigns of American universities."
SRI
That same Daily story reported that when Sterling first
took office, Stanford Research Institute (SRI) was over $1
million in debt; as chairman of the SRI board, the
now-independent SRI was soon in the black.
During Sterling's time, faculty recruitments were big,
and because of that Allen says that the University got
many eminent professors: "He concentrated on the
strong departments and made them stronger, rather than
spreading to other fields."
Under Sterling's tenure, the University began its
overseas campuses in France, Italy and Germany.
SLAC
The Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) started under

Sterling's presidency. Allen says that the establishment of
such programs as that and the Medical School has led to
inter-departmental cooperation, creating other programs
such as human biology, heart implant transmitters and
other medically-related research.
Sterling resigned from the presidency at a time when
student activism was on the upswing. During that time he
encountered sit-ins and personal violence, such as a Fire
that destroyed his office.
Sterling is now chancellor and a member of the Board
of Trustees, and is co-chairman of the fundraising
Campaign for Stanford.
Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer replaced Sterling in 19G8, "in
the midst of riots and disruptions," says Allen.
Unprepared
Hansen agrees, saying that "no president was prepared
for the student reactions of the Vietnam war. There was
no precedent to base a plan of action. He got buffered by
it all, and was snowed by radical students and intellectual
gymnastics. He resigned out of frustration" in 1970.
In his letter of resignation to then Board President W.
Parmer Fuller 111, Pitzer stated that "the gulf between the
campus community and society at large has widened ...
pressures tending to distract or disrupt the educational
process have increased ... there is little confidence on
campus about our promised disengagement from the war."
Fuller replied that "among the many changes in
education and in University governance instituted during
his tenure, perhaps the increase in faculty time devoted to
undergraduates and the inclusion of students and faculty
in the decision-making process stand out. The caliber of
appointments he has made to key academic posts also has
been unusually high."
In spite of the campus disturbances, Allen credits Pitzer
with holding the University together. "The only
interference with classes on a mass basis came with
Cambodia. Research and classes had kept going, but the
disrupting activities occupied so much [press] space that it
gave a shut down impression."

campaign, called the "First Million for Stanford," to
improve faculty salaries.
Wilbur was also a respected and influential physician.
Before accepting the job of president, he was dean of the
Stanford Medical School.
Editors of the Wilbur Memoirs, Edgar Eugene Robinson
and Paul Carroll Edwards write that as president, Wilbur
promoted "high scholastic attainment among students
through the Independent Study Plan, Lower Division
honors, and graduation honors... Growth of research
facilities in departments, in the University libraries,
including the Hoover Library [now the Hoover
Institution], in the Food Research Institute at the
Hopkins Marine Station were encouraged."
Today, Wilbur Hall dormitory is named after him.
Tresidder
Donald Bertrand Tresidder was the University's fourth
president, from 1943 until his sudden death in 1948.
Tresidder had a Stanford M.D. degree, but didn't
practice. He was an aviator, a great outdoorsman, and was
president of the company that ran Yosemite National
Park.
Allen says that "Tresidder's problems were seeing the
University through [WWI] and then rebuilding afterwards.
He had to handle an onslaught of students [after the war J;

the enrollment burgeoned. Many special efforts were
needed to handle the students, and the plant was run down
because of deferred war maintenance."
Hansen adds that during this difficult time, he simply
"held the University together."
Sororities Banned
Allen says that one of the most "traumatic" decisions
that was made during Tresidder's tenure was the ending of
sororities. He explains that it was "traumatic" for alumni,
but "the decision was instigated by sorority women."
Stanford's Tresidder Memorial Union was built in his
memory.
John Ewart Wallace Sterling took over after Tresidder's
death, and stayed with the presidency until 1968.
Transformation
Allen says that Sterling's major contribution was the
transformation of Stanford University "from a good West
Coast school into a first class research institution."
He adds that at the time of Sterling's tenure, "the
government wanted to fund more research, and more
money was available from private funds. Sterling, along
with then-provost [Frederick E.] Terman, made the most
of the opportunity and brought Stanford to today's level
of Harvard, Yale, and MIT."
As an attest to his fundraising abilities, the University
was given $24 million over a five-year period from the
Ford Foundation, on the condition that they match it
three to one. Through "self-help," the University was able
to raise the large sum.
To supplement Stanford's increasing needs for funds,
Sterling announced the $100 million Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era (PACE) drive, with the $25 million Ford
grant as a base. According to a Daily story, PACE,
completed in 1964, "set a new record for private support
in capital campaigns of American universities."
SRI
That same Daily story reported that when Sterling first
took office, Stanford Research Institute (SRI) was over $1
million in debt; as chairman of the SRI board, the
now-independent SRI was soon in the black.
During Sterling's time, faculty recruitments were big,
and because of that Allen says that the University got
many eminent professors: "He concentrated on the
strong departments and made them stronger, rather than
spreading to other fields."
Under Sterling's tenure, the University began its
overseas campuses in France, Italy and Germany.
SLAC
The Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC) started under

Sterling's presidency. Allen says that the establishment of
such programs as that and the Medical School has led to
inter-departmental cooperation, creating other programs
such as human biology, heart implant transmitters and
other medically-related research.
Sterling resigned from the presidency at a time when
student activism was on the upswing. During that time he
encountered sit-ins and personal violence, such as a Fire
that destroyed his office.
Sterling is now chancellor and a member of the Board
of Trustees, and is co-chairman of the fundraising
Campaign for Stanford.
Kenneth Sanborn Pitzer replaced Sterling in 19G8, "in
the midst of riots and disruptions," says Allen.
Unprepared
Hansen agrees, saying that "no president was prepared
for the student reactions of the Vietnam war. There was
no precedent to base a plan of action. He got buffered by
it all, and was snowed by radical students and intellectual
gymnastics. He resigned out of frustration" in 1970.
In his letter of resignation to then Board President W.
Parmer Fuller 111, Pitzer stated that "the gulf between the
campus community and society at large has widened ...
pressures tending to distract or disrupt the educational
process have increased ... there is little confidence on
campus about our promised disengagement from the war."
Fuller replied that "among the many changes in
education and in University governance instituted during
his tenure, perhaps the increase in faculty time devoted to
undergraduates and the inclusion of students and faculty
in the decision-making process stand out. The caliber of
appointments he has made to key academic posts also has
been unusually high."
In spite of the campus disturbances, Allen credits Pitzer
with holding the University together. "The only
interference with classes on a mass basis came with
Cambodia. Research and classes had kept going, but the
disrupting activities occupied so much [press] space that it
gave a shut down impression."
ROTC Phased Out
During Pitzer's time, a faculty decision "based on
objections to course content and faculty appointments"
phased out Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), says
Allen.
Pitzer, a distinguished chemist, is now a professor at
UC-Berkeley. For his work in that field he has been
awarded the Priestly Medal, which Allen calls "the next
highest award before the Nobel Prize."
He was succeeded in 1970 by Richard Wall Lyman.

The most prestigious administrative position at
Stanford is that of president of the University. The
president is in the uniquely powerful position of being
responsible for major decisions, and most of those
decisions are approved by the Board of Trustees.
Stanford's seven presidents, besides occupying
prestigious roles at the University, have been important
men in their own right.
David Starr Jordan, first president of the University,
was appointed by Leland Stanford and served from 1891
until 1913. He was young — 40 — at the time of his
appointment, and had until that time been president of
Indiana University. He was also a world famous
ichthyologist, and, according to University Relations Editor
Peter Allen, his textbook is still in use.
"Jordan set the whole tone for the University," says
Allen. "He established the elective system, the minimum
requirement system, and saw to it that Stanford was a true
University with research and graduate work."
Educationally Undeveloped
Allen says that such a task was difficult in that "the
West was undeveloped educationally" compared to
Eastern institutions.
He was also responsible for choosing the first faculty,
and chose people interested in both teaching and research:
"the standard for succeeding appointments," says Allen.
And as chancellor, the title given to all past Presidents if
they remain with the University, Allen says Jordan was
"an ardent crusader for peace — a humanitarian."
Right Hand Man
John Casper Branner, before succeeding Jordan, had
been his "right hand man," says Chief University Librarian
Ralph Hansen, and was given the presidency when Jordan
retired in 1913.
Allen says that Branner was to be president only until
1915, as he had stipulated that the mandatory retirement
age be honored. He was 63 at the time of his appointment,
and wanted only to be an interim president while the
search went on for another.
Hansen says that Branner's major decision while
President was to "marry" Cooper Medical College in San
Francisco with Stanford. Cooper had become the nucleus
of Stanford University medicine, and its upkeep was
causing the University financial problems — a merger
seemed natural. With the merger, Cooper "died."
Branner came to Stanford as an "imminent geologist,"
says Allen, and had done extensive work in South
America. Today the University has Branner Hall in his

honor.
Longest Tenure
Ray Lyman Wilbur, himself a Stanford graduate in
1895, had the longest tenure of any president, from 1916
to 1929 and then 1933 to 1943. Robert Eckles Swain was
acting president during Wilbur's absence.
Allen says that Wilbur was considered an "austere, but
not humorless man. He could work and listen to people at
the same time," a fact rather disconcerting to office
visitors who didn't know the man's working habits.
At that time, the office of the presidency consisted
only of the president and two secretaries. Allen says that
Wilbur was "quick at making decisions — there was no
need for a large organization."
According to Hansen, Wilbur's major contribution to
the University was the abandonment of Jordan's
departmental system; he created schools instead (i.e. the
School of Humanities and Sciences). Allen adds that
Wilbur "weathered World War I and the Depression, the
displacement of men and the lack of money."
Tuition
Tuition was instated under Wilbur's tenure — the
University had originally been tuition-free. It was small,
but it helped. He also started a formal fundraising
campaign, called the "First Million for Stanford," to
improve faculty salaries.
Wilbur was also a respected and influential physician.
Before accepting the job of president, he was dean of the
Stanford Medical School.
Editors of the Wilbur Memoirs, Edgar Eugene Robinson
and Paul Carroll Edwards write that as president, Wilbur

it all, and was snowed by radical students and intellectual
gymnastics. He resigned out of frustration" in 1970.
In his letter of resignation to then Board President W.
Parmer Fuller 111, Pitzer stated that "the gulf between the
campus community and society at large has widened ...
pressures tending to distract or disrupt the educational
process have increased ... there is little confidence on
campus about our promised disengagement from the war."
Fuller replied that "among the many changes in
education and in University governance instituted during
his tenure, perhaps the increase in faculty time devoted to
undergraduates and the inclusion of students and faculty
in the decision-making process stand out. The caliber of
appointments he has made to key academic posts also has
been unusually high."
In spite of the campus disturbances, Allen credits Pitzer
with holding the University together. "The only
interference with classes on a mass basis came with
Cambodia. Research and classes had kept going, but the
disrupting activities occupied so much [press] space that it
gave a shut down impression."
ROTC Phased Out
During Pitzer's time, a faculty decision "based on
objections to course content and faculty appointments"
phased out Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), says
Allen.
Pitzer, a distinguished chemist, is now a professor at
UC-Berkeley. For his work in that field he has been
awarded the Priestly Medal, which Allen calls "the next
highest award before the Nobel Prize."
He was succeeded in 1970 by Richard Wall Lyman.
