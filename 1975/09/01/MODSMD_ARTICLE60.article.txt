# New Recruits Help Poloists' Fortunes

### CHRIS BAKER 
After turning a two-time
Pac-8 doormat waterpolo team
into a national contender last
year, what do you do for an
encore?
"Win the NCAA water polo
championship," replies
second-year Stanford water
polo coach Art Lambert. If that
sounds a bit lofty, it is, but it

may just come true this season.
Last season Lambert, the
coach of the *68 and '72 U.S.
Olympic water polo squad, took
a Cardinal team that had
finished dead last in the Pac-8
two straight seasons, and guided
it to a sixth place finish in the
NCAA championships. The
Cards finished the season with a
14-11 mark, but that hardly tells
the whole story. Eight of the 11
losses came at the hands of the
top three teams in the nation —
NCAA champ California, UC-
Irvine and UCLA.
Stanford earned its NCAA
berth by running up a five game
win streak in the last two weeks
of the season. One of those wins
was a thrilling double overtime
victory over USC.
But Lambert and the Cards
didn't rest on their laurels. Water
polo is a sport that requires total
team coordination and keeping
the team together in the summer
is essential to this.
With this in mind, Lambert
formed the Stanford Aquatic
Foundation, a non-profit
corporation, designed to
promote water polo competition
under the Stanford banner. The
foundation didn't do too badly
this summer.
With a core of Stanford
players, it finished second to the
Concord Aquatic Foundation in
the AAU National water polo
championships this summer.
And Concord isn't a shabby
outfit. It was founded several
years ago by two-time NCAA
champion water polo coach Pete
Cutino of California. It is
composed primarily of Cutino's
players at Cal.
So if Lambert sounds a bit
enthusiastic, he has a right to be.
Every player from last year
returns to action this year, and
only three of them are seniors.
Stanford has a fine crop of
freshman coming in too. "We
went after 10 top people and we
got eight," said Lambert. There
are five high school
Ail-Americans in the crop.
The Cards' top three scorers
return this season, to provide a
young, yet experienced nucleus.
Sophomore Rick Johnannsen led
the scoring with 24 goals,
followed by juniors Drew
McDonald with 21 and Paul
Clark with 19. Stanford will be
strong in the nets, where goalie
Chris Dorst returns. Dorst was
recently selected to try out for
the 1976 U.S. Olympic team.

After turning a two-time
Pac-8 doormat waterpolo team
into a national contender last
year, what do you do for an
encore?
"Win the NCAA water polo
championship," replies
second-year Stanford water
polo coach Art Lambert. If that
sounds a bit lofty, it is, but it

may just come true this season.
Last season Lambert, the
coach of the *68 and '72 U.S.
Olympic water polo squad, took
a Cardinal team that had
finished dead last in the Pac-8
two straight seasons, and guided
it to a sixth place finish in the
NCAA championships. The
Cards finished the season with a
14-11 mark, but that hardly tells
the whole story. Eight of the 11
losses came at the hands of the
top three teams in the nation —
NCAA champ California, UC-
Irvine and UCLA.
Stanford earned its NCAA
berth by running up a five game
win streak in the last two weeks
of the season. One of those wins
was a thrilling double overtime
victory over USC.
But Lambert and the Cards
didn't rest on their laurels. Water
polo is a sport that requires total
team coordination and keeping
the team together in the summer
is essential to this.
With this in mind, Lambert
formed the Stanford Aquatic
Foundation, a non-profit
corporation, designed to
promote water polo competition
under the Stanford banner. The
foundation didn't do too badly
this summer.
With a core of Stanford
players, it finished second to the
Concord Aquatic Foundation in
the AAU National water polo
championships this summer.
And Concord isn't a shabby
outfit. It was founded several
years ago by two-time NCAA
champion water polo coach Pete
Cutino of California. It is
composed primarily of Cutino's
players at Cal.
So if Lambert sounds a bit
enthusiastic, he has a right to be.
Every player from last year
returns to action this year, and
only three of them are seniors.
Stanford has a fine crop of
freshman coming in too. "We
went after 10 top people and we
got eight," said Lambert. There
are five high school
Ail-Americans in the crop.
The Cards' top three scorers
return this season, to provide a
young, yet experienced nucleus.
Sophomore Rick Johnannsen led
the scoring with 24 goals,
followed by juniors Drew
McDonald with 21 and Paul
Clark with 19. Stanford will be
strong in the nets, where goalie
Chris Dorst returns. Dorst was
recently selected to try out for
the 1976 U.S. Olympic team.
