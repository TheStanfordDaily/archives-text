# Athletic Dept. Merger
## Women Race For Equality 
### 
Women's News Service
The men's and women's
Athletic and Physical Education
Departments will merge this Fall
to form the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (DAPER). Joe
Ruetz, former head of the men's
department will retain the title
of Athletic Director, while Pam
Strathairn, former head of the
women's department will
become Chairman of Physical
Education. But there's a lot
more to the merger than just a
change in titles.
The history of the decision to
merge the two departments, and
increase opportunities for
women to participate in athletics
and recreation at Stanford, has
been a long and involved one. In
1968, "The Study of Education
at Stanford" recommended a
merger of the men's and
women's departments, with the
men's > intercollegiate program
remaining autonomous from the
merged department. By
1972-73, however, this plan was
seen as clearly impractical for
several reasons.
Recent budget cuts, and the
implementation of Title IX of
the Higher Education
Amendments Act of 1972,
forbidding discrimination on the

basis of sex in physical
education and afterschcol
athletics (among other things),
by any educational institution
receiving federal funds, must be
seen as the two major factors in
the development of the present
plan.
Coordinated Effort
Men's and women's
intercollegiate athletics will now
be a part of a coordinated effort
to provide opportunities in
physical education and
recreation for all members of the
Stanford community, while
maximally utilizing teachers,
coaches, other personnel and
facilities.
Probably the most important
change, brought about by the
development of the merger, is
the increased communication
between not only the men's and
women's athletic and physical
education departments, but also
between both departments,
student athletes, the President
and Provost's offices and a host
of other administrators. This is
being accomplished partly
through the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (CAPER).
Up until 1972, when Ruetz
succeeded Chuck Taylor as head
of the Athletic Department,

light years, rather than a mere
mile and a half, might as well
have separated the two
departments. But this was not
unusual, men's and women's
athletic departments have
traditionally been separated
from one another at most
schools.
For the past two years, Ruetz
and Strathairn have been
studying their respective
departments and hashing out
differences in philosophy,
financing and practices, so that
their departments could
successfully merge.
Equal Time
An important change,
brought about by the merger, is
an equalization of teaching and
coaching time spent by DAPER
personnel. This, in a way,
signifies the compromise
between the former priorities of
the two departments. Although
some of the men will remain
full-time coaches, most of them,
rather than devote three-quarters
of their time to coaching and the
remainder to teaching, will split
their time on a 50-50 basis, as
will all the women coaches. Thus
male students will have greater
access to quality physical
education classes and women
students to a high-powered
intercollegiate athletic programs.
The biggest changes will come
in intercollegiate athletics. For
the first time Stanford will offer
athletic grants-in-aid to women.
Twelve grants will be offered in
golf, tennis and swimming.
Currently Stanford offers about
140 grants to men athletes. In
the next couple of years
Stanford will be working to
expand the number of grants to
women as well as improving
means of assessing talented
women prep athletes.
Among the many changes
which will result, such as greater
access to practice facilities,
better training headquarters and
some expansion in travel budgets
for women athletes, the biggest
change will come in coaching.
In swimming, tennis and
basketball a head coach has been
appointed who will be
responsible for both the men's
and women's programs. They
will be assisted by women
coaches who are primarily
responsible for the women's
teams.

being accomplished partly
through the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (CAPER).
Up until 1972, when Ruetz
succeeded Chuck Taylor as head
of the Athletic Department,

light years, rather than a mere
mile and a half, might as well
have separated the two
departments. But this was not
unusual, men's and women's
athletic departments have
traditionally been separated
from one another at most
schools.
For the past two years, Ruetz
and Strathairn have been
studying their respective
departments and hashing out
differences in philosophy,
financing and practices, so that
their departments could
successfully merge.
Equal Time
An important change,
brought about by the merger, is
an equalization of teaching and
coaching time spent by DAPER
personnel. This, in a way,
signifies the compromise
between the former priorities of
the two departments. Although
some of the men will remain
full-time coaches, most of them,
rather than devote three-quarters
of their time to coaching and the
remainder to teaching, will split
their time on a 50-50 basis, as
will all the women coaches. Thus
male students will have greater
access to quality physical
education classes and women
students to a high-powered
intercollegiate athletic programs.
The biggest changes will come
in intercollegiate athletics. For
the first time Stanford will offer
athletic grants-in-aid to women.
Twelve grants will be offered in
golf, tennis and swimming.
Currently Stanford offers about
140 grants to men athletes. In
the next couple of years
Stanford will be working to
expand the number of grants to
women as well as improving
means of assessing talented
women prep athletes.
Among the many changes
which will result, such as greater
access to practice facilities,
better training headquarters and
some expansion in travel budgets
for women athletes, the biggest
change will come in coaching.
In swimming, tennis and
basketball a head coach has been
appointed who will be
responsible for both the men's
and women's programs. They
will be assisted by women
coaches who are primarily
responsible for the women's
teams.

Women's News Service
The men's and women's
Athletic and Physical Education
Departments will merge this Fall
to form the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (DAPER). Joe
Ruetz, former head of the men's
department will retain the title
of Athletic Director, while Pam
Strathairn, former head of the
women's department will
become Chairman of Physical
Education. But there's a lot
more to the merger than just a
change in titles.
The history of the decision to
merge the two departments, and
increase opportunities for
women to participate in athletics
and recreation at Stanford, has
been a long and involved one. In
1968, "The Study of Education
at Stanford" recommended a
merger of the men's and
women's departments, with the
men's > intercollegiate program
remaining autonomous from the
merged department. By
1972-73, however, this plan was
seen as clearly impractical for
several reasons.
Recent budget cuts, and the
implementation of Title IX of
the Higher Education
Amendments Act of 1972,
forbidding discrimination on the

basis of sex in physical
education and afterschcol
athletics (among other things),
by any educational institution
receiving federal funds, must be
seen as the two major factors in
the development of the present
plan.
Coordinated Effort
Men's and women's
intercollegiate athletics will now
be a part of a coordinated effort
to provide opportunities in
physical education and
recreation for all members of the
Stanford community, while
maximally utilizing teachers,
coaches, other personnel and
facilities.
Probably the most important
change, brought about by the
development of the merger, is
the increased communication
between not only the men's and
women's athletic and physical
education departments, but also
between both departments,
student athletes, the President
and Provost's offices and a host
of other administrators. This is
being accomplished partly
through the Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (CAPER).
