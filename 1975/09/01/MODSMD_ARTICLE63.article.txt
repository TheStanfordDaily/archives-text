Head coach Shirley Schoof
will welcome back all but three
of last year's starting 11 on Sept.
21, when the women's field
hockey team begins preparations
for the NCIAC preseason
tournament, Oct. 10-11 at Chico
State.
Schoof, who enters her sixth
season on the Farm, will be
assisted by first year aide Carla
Soracco, a club player.
Annie Killefer, last year's
MVP and leading scorer, returns
to help the Cards improve upon
last year's 5-2-2 mark.
Although the women have
always been fighters, this year
they'll have an added incentive
— the first annual National
Collegiate Field Hockey
Tournament, in Harrisonberg,
Va., during Thanksgiving
vacation.
To gain a tournament berth,
the team must place first or
second in the NCIAC Regional
Tournament, which Stanford
will host on Nov. 14-15. The top
two teams from their leagues

will be invited to the Regionals.
Last year the Cards finished
second in their league, behind
San Jose State.
Humboldt State, Sacramento
State and San Jose State should
provide the women's toughest
league competition. If past
seasons are any indication,
however, the squad should make
it to the Regionals and has a
very good chance to advance to
the Nationals.
The squad's first home
contest will be against Cal State
Hayward on Oct. 15, at 1:30
p.m.
