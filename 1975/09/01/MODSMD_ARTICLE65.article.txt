# Recruits Help Swimmers
## 
### 
Three highly touted
newcomers may hfelp vault the
Stanford women's swimming
team into the top five teams in
the nation this year.
Last year the mermaids went
undefeated in NCIAC league
competition and went on to
capture eighth place in the
Nationals. This year the Cards
are aiming higher.
"I'm really excited about this
year's team," said first year
coach Kathy Baggett. "But I'm
nervous too. I've never coached
so many great swimmers."
Freshman Jill Harshbarger, a
member of the 1972 U.S.
Olympic team, will specialize in
the distance freestyle. "She can
help us cover a lot of things,"
says swimmer Vicki Hays. The
Cards' medley relay team will be
helped by the addition of
newcomer Leslie Crozier.
Crozier is a backstroker.
Rosemary Storm, a breaststroker
from Palo Alto, rounds out the
trio. Storm is also expected to
help Stanford capture the
NCIAC freestyle crown.
The swimmers are loaded
with returning veterans, which is
a reason for the optimism
around deGuerre Pools these
days.
The team's two superstars,

Anne Brodell and Hays, return
to anchor the Cards. Brodell
broke the NCIAC 200 yard
freestyle record last year
(1:58.076). She also set school
records in the 100 free (56.09)
and 100 backstroke (1:04.295).
Hays holds the NCIAC record in
the 100 breaststroke and
the school record in the 200 IM
and 50 freestyle.
Joining Hays and Brodell are
an impressive group of
swimmers. Nan Leuschel, a
member of Stanford's 200
medley relay team, Megan
Edwards, Liz Lambert, Kathy
Keinze, will team up behind the
Cards' two superstars.
Stanford should have little
trouble winning the league, with
an impressive crop like this. The
squad swings into action on Oct.
18 when it travels to Humboldt
to take on Santa Clara and
Humboldt State. The first home
contest will be against California
on Oct. 30 at deGuerre Pools.
"I don't think the league will
be any problem," said Hays.
"But Davis (UC Davis) and San
Jose State have given us
problems in the NCIAC
regionals." Last year Davis edged
out the Cards for the NCIAC
Regional crown. The Spartans
finished third behind Stanford.

RECORD HOLDER—Returning veteran Nan Leushel is one of the
reasons why the women's shimming team is looking forward to a
place among the top five teams in the nation. Leuschel shares the
Stanford school record in 200 free relay with Ann Brodell, Vicki
Hays and Holly Houston.
