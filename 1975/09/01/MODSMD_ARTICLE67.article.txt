The Organization of Stanford
Women Athletes (OSWA) kicks
off its second year with its first
meeting on Sept. 30 at 7:30
p.m. All members of the
Stanford community are invited.
The OSWA was founded last
year as a support group for
women athletes and others
interested in expanding
opport unities for women in
athletics. A primary goal of the
OSWA was to allow athletes to
inform each other of what was,
and was not, happening in
athletics at Stanford. Members
of the six women's
intercollegiate teams and other
women athletes felt a need to
forge a collective voice and
source of energy to support each
other's struggles for equity.
The attendance at the first
few meetings last fall was good
— often in excess of 150.
Although attendance dropped
later in the year, this was

attributed to time demands
upon the women athletes.
Last year OSWA was
instrumental in organizing the
women's crew team and opening
up channels of communication
between women athletes and the
Provost's Office, University
Committees and the men's and
women's Athletic Departments.
Even though many of the
inequities suffered by women
athletes (lack of scholarships,
training headquarters etc.) will
be partly solved by the merger
of the men's and women's
Athletic Departments, this
promises to be a even more
important year for OSWA.
The OSWA would also like to
help the Athletic Department to
further publicize the women's
athletic program and raise
money so that the merged
Department can continue to
expand.
The OSWA could be
instrumental this year, as it was
last, in providing that kind of
support, and helping athletes
gain insight into themselves,
others and some of the
significant issues around them —
Athletic Department Budget and
Title IX and its effects.
The merged Athletic
Department will provide a
framework for the inauguration
of expanded athletic and
recreational activities for
women, and provide a way to
overcome inequities in sports
that already exist.
