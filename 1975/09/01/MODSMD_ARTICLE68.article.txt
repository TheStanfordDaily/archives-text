Quick now. What is a sport
that runs for three quarters. If
you said fencing you're right.
But you probably never even
knew there was a fencing team
at Stanford, did you?
Well there is, and the fencers
even won the NCIAC
championship last year. But why
fencing in a women's league and
not the Pac-8? Well fencing is a
coed sport, which is coached by
a woman (Jean Helliwell). You
figure it out.
But one thing that should be
clear about the fencers is that
they'll be awfully good this year.
Returning is epee fencer Steve
Walt who was first in the
championships last year.
Joining Walt are a good group
of fencers. David Basri placed
first in the novice foil

championships last year and
Helliwell is expecting good
things from him this season.
Russ Ritter was third in the
novice foil competition.
Returning to lead the women
will be Marie Fiatarone. Her
specialty is foil. Joining her will
be newcomer Lorna Mcßae.
Mcßae captured first place in
the women's novice foil
competition last spring.
