# Board Of Trustees: 32 People Having The Last Word
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees is the legal owner of
Stanford University and its assets. It is
custodian of the endowment and of all
properties of the University. It administers the
invested funds, sets the annual budget and
determines policies for the operation and
control of the University.
Many administrators will tell you that the
Board of Trustees does not tell the president
how to run the University. In fact, it usually
goes along with the president's
recommendations.
However, the Board remains an important
body. It hires and fires the president and fixes
the salaries of the president, professors and
teachers. It meets nine times each year either
on campus, in San Francisco or in Los Angeles.
There are 32 members of the Board, eight
of whom are elected by the alumni by secret
ballot:
