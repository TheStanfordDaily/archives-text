State, Washington and

What are Stanford's athletic
teams called?

except the ice hockey team are

hockey team is unofficially
known as the Indians, which was
the name of all Stanford teams
until 1972.
Where do Stanford's major
athletic teams hold their
contests?
The football team plays all its
home games in Stanford
Stadium, the largest privately
owned stadium in the country.
The basketball squad plays its
home games in Roscoe Maples
Pavilion, which has a seating
capacity of 8000. The baseball
team plays its contests in
Sunken Diamond, which is
directly behind the Stadium.
The swimming and water polo
teams hold their meets at
DeGuerre Pools. The track team
uses Stanford Stadium for its
matches. The tennis team uses
the Tennis Stadium for some of
its contests and switches to
Maples for the big matches.
Are Stanford games ever on
radio or television?
All 11 of Stanford's home
football games will be broadcast
on KSFO (560) and KZSU (880
in the dorms). The San Jose
State football game will be
broadcast regionally over the
ABC television network. All of
Stanford's conference basketball

games will be broadcast over
KSFO and all the home contests
will be broadcast over KZSU.
Who are the coaches of
Stanford's major sports?
Jack Christiansen, now
entering his fourth year, is
Stanford's head football coach.
Dick Di√üiaso will be directing
the basketball team for the first
time this year. Ray Young pilots
the baseball team. Dick Gould
directs the tennis squad. 1968
Olympic coach Payton Jordan
coaches the track and field
squad. 1972 Olympic coach Art
Lambert directs the water polo
squad. Jim Gaughran pilots the
swimming and diving team. Joe
DeMeo coaches the wrestlers.
Bud Finger pilots the golf team.
Fred Priddle heads the soccer
team. Marshall Clark pilots the
cross country team.
Can anyone try out for a
Stanford athletic team?
In major sports such as
football, the Cards have had a
higher number of walk-ons than
any other conference school.
But don't expect to be a Jim
Plunkett. You'll probably be
meeting a lot of all-something
high school athletes at Stanford.
Stanford still fields junior varsity
squads though, and walk-ons
have a good chance of making
these squads.
What type of women's
athletic program does Stanford
run?
The women's and men's
athletic departments were
merged this past year. Stanford
fields women's teams in a lot of
sports.
Are there any scholarships for
women athletes?
Yes, Stanford offers a limited
number of athletic scholarships
for women. But don't expect a
full ride. College athletic
departments are experiencing
their worst financial crisis in
history.
Is there any type of

intramural sports program at
Stanford?
Stanford has an intramural
program covering everything
from football to horseshoes.
People interested in forming
teams can get the information
from the intramural office,
which is located in Encina Gym.
Do I have to be on a team to
use Encina Gym and the rest of
the athletic department's
facilities?
No, any registered Stanford
student may use the athletic
department's facilities. The
department offers physical
education classes for all
students, but no more than 12
units of physical education may
be counted towards graduation.
Operating hours for all of
Stanford's recreational facilities
are published elsewhere in this
issue.
