# Baseball, Track Offer Excitement

### CHRIS BAKER 
Tennis isn't the only show on
The Farm in the spring.
Stanford also fields baseball
and track teams which compete
in the Pac-8, a conference that
has won more titles than any
other conference in the two
sports.
Baseball coach Ray Young
may have suffered through a 9-9
league campaign, but his
recruiting record was 23-1.
Twenty-four high school
senior players — 13 pitchers, five
catchers, five infielders and one
outfielder — returned letters of
intent to enroll at Stanford.
Only one got away.
The Cards' biggest hole last
season was in the pitching staff,
which suffered enough sore arms
to keep the trainers busy for a
year. "If Ken Grolle, Mike
Williamson and Jerry Argust had
been healthy," Young said, "we
would have won the Conference

going away."
Young will have some good
newcomers to help him win the
conference. The best of the
group is pitcher Robert Irwin, a
southpaw from Lancaster's
Antelope Valley High School.
Other top pitching recruits
are Bruce Fiala (Sherman Oaks),
Gerry Komolofski (Portland,
Ore.) and Bill Lemon
(Richmond). Young sees Lemon
as a sleeper. "He was the most
valuable player in his league and
was coming on strong."
Stanford's infield was one of
the best in the conference last
year, with shortstop Steve Davis,
a three time All Pac-8 Southern
Division selection, and third
baseman Gary Pitchford, who
joined Davis on the All-Pac-8
Southern Division team.
The infield can only be
stronger, with the addition of
Oregon All-State infielder Larry
Reynolds. Reynolds is the
brother of former University of
Oregon football-baseball star
Don Reynolds. Like his brother,
Larry is also a two-sport athlete,
competing for the junior varsity
football team. Reynolds has
been clocked in 4.7 for 40 yards.
Pro baseball took both of the
Cards' catchers in the draft, but
Young isn't worried. He's got
four of the best prep catchers in
the west. The best of the lot is
Gordy Ceresino, an All-CIF
selection from Notre Dame High
School in Southern California.
He was also a two-time
All-American pick in football.
Ceresino fills in at middle line

backer for the football team.
Track
Payton Jordan's track team
has been the doormat of the
conference for the last three
years, and things don't look
much better in 1976.
The distance corps were one
of the few bright spots last year,
and the lungbusters figure to
shine even more this year.
Stanford's two distance icings
Tony Sandoval and Jack Bellah
return to anchor the squad.
Joining the duo will be Roy
Kissen, one of the top high
school distance prospects in the
country.
Jordan could get some help
from football coach Jack
Christiansen. Among Chris'
football recruits are an
impressive group of tracksters.
The best of the lot is Brad
Slinkard. Slinkard was a 1975
prep Ail-American in track. He
threw the shot 64-10 to place
fourth in the state finals and had
a best of 175 in the discus. Wide
receiver Vince Mulroy will help
Jordan's fine crew of
quarter-milers. Mulroy had a
best of 48.9 in the 440 and ran
on the state's second-place mile
relay team.
Long jumper James Lofton,
another member of the football
team, returns to help the Cards.
Lofton was the California State
High School Long jump
champion in 1974. He had a best
of 25-3 last year.

TENNIS STAR—Now that Cardinal tennis stars Jim Delaney and
John Whitlinger have graduated, much of the burden will be on
Nick Saviano. Saviano was the third seeded player on the squad last
year.
