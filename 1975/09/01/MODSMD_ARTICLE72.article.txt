# Combined Netters Face Budget Cuts
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
The merger of the men's and
women's sports programs here
may bring with it a mixed bag of
blessings for the tennis team,
according to tennis coach Dick
Gould.
"I really don't know too
much about the girl's teams
we've had in the past, although I
had a lot of confidence in
[former women's coach] Curly
Neal," Gould says. "But there's
nothing to compare with the
new program."
He says he is eager about
combining the two teams,
adding that the new program
"opens up new things that the
gals haven't been exposed to,
such as fundraising, which is
both enjoyable and necessary."
Under the rules of the
merger, each men's and women's
varsity team is under the
direction of one coach. Gould is
directing the tennis program,
assisted by Ann Hill, who
replaces Neal. However, Gould
says he will work primarily with
the men's team and Hill will
spend most of her time with the
women.
Neal, the coach who brought
Stanford women's tennis to
national prominence, announced
last spring that she will no longer
coach the team. She will remain
in the department to teach
physical education classes.
Improve Women's Tennis
Hill, a 1971 Stanford
graduate, was a member of the
women's tennis team as an
undergraduate. "I think the
merger is really going to improve
women's tennis here," she says.
Gould, however, claims the
merger has crunched both funds
and space. "We're going to have
budget problems," he says,
adding that although the varsity
team has doubled, the budget
has not.
"We've got twice as many
people taking advantage of the
budget, but we don't have twice
as much money," he notes. "Our
ball budget, for example, only
went up 30 percent."
Because there are only 11
courts in the deGuerre complex,
the combined teams will only
have 22 members — probably 12
men and 10 women, although
Gould says no arbitrary numbers
of men and women have been
decided.
No JV Teams
The merger allows for no
junior varsity teams, except in

football.
"It's really too bad that
there's no JV team," Gould says.
"With tennis especially, you'll
get kids who maybe had a good
high school or national
reputation; but with only 10 or
12 spaces on the team, there's
really no chance for them to
grow in a team position.
"Last summer we had an IBM
printout of 186 freshmen who
were interested in the men's
tennis team," Gould continues.
"Now last year we had 30 men
on the varsity and JV teams."
Chance To Play
"A lot of people went out for
the team just for a chance to
play tennis. There aren't enough
courts to go around."
Gould says he feels his 1975
fourth-place team has a good
chance to recapture the national
title next year.
"It's going to be tougher this
time," he says."The teams to
beat will definitely be UCLA,
USC, Michigan, Miami,
Pepperdine and San Jose State."
Stanford was both the 1973
and 1974 NCAA tennis
champions, and the 1972
runner-up. Their dynasty was
toppled this year as UCLA
claimed the 1975 crown.
Weakened Team
The men's team will be
weakened next year with the
departure of four varsity players.
Seniors Jim Delaney, Chip
Fisher and Tim Noonan have
graduated, while junior John
Whitlinger, 1974 NCAA singles
and doubles champ, has left
school to turn pro.
But Gould says there are two
top freshman coming in this fall,
as well as a few JV members
who will join the varsity team,
making for "at least 10 bonafide
men's players."
Hill says the'women's team
"will be able to maintain a good
tradition" next year. Stanford
placed second in the nationals at
Kalamazoo, Mich, this year,
losing only to Trinity.
Three freshmen coming in
this year — Susan Hagey (sister
of Stanford star Chico Hagey),
Barbara Jordan and Diane
Morrison were among the top 10
juniors nationally. Added to
current stars Lele Forood, Marcy
O'Keefe and Liza Pande, Hill
says the six will make a strong
nucleus, aided by daily, more
structured practices.

who will join the varsity team,
making for "at least 10 bonafide
men's players."
Hill says the'women's team
"will be able to maintain a good
tradition" next year. Stanford
placed second in the nationals at
Kalamazoo, Mich, this year,
losing only to Trinity.
Three freshmen coming in
this year — Susan Hagey (sister
of Stanford star Chico Hagey),
Barbara Jordan and Diane
Morrison were among the top 10
juniors nationally. Added to
current stars Lele Forood, Marcy
O'Keefe and Liza Pande, Hill
says the six will make a strong
nucleus, aided by daily, more
structured practices.
The merger of the men's and
women's sports programs here
may bring with it a mixed bag of
blessings for the tennis team,
according to tennis coach Dick
Gould.
"I really don't know too
much about the girl's teams
we've had in the past, although I
had a lot of confidence in
[former women's coach] Curly
Neal," Gould says. "But there's
nothing to compare with the
new program."
He says he is eager about
combining the two teams,
adding that the new program
"opens up new things that the
gals haven't been exposed to,
such as fundraising, which is
both enjoyable and necessary."
Under the rules of the
merger, each men's and women's
varsity team is under the
direction of one coach. Gould is
directing the tennis program,
assisted by Ann Hill, who
replaces Neal. However, Gould
says he will work primarily with
the men's team and Hill will
spend most of her time with the
women.
Neal, the coach who brought
Stanford women's tennis to
national prominence, announced
last spring that she will no longer
coach the team. She will remain
in the department to teach
physical education classes.
Improve Women's Tennis
Hill, a 1971 Stanford
graduate, was a member of the
women's tennis team as an
undergraduate. "I think the
merger is really going to improve
women's tennis here," she says.
Gould, however, claims the
merger has crunched both funds
and space. "We're going to have
budget problems," he says,
adding that although the varsity
team has doubled, the budget
has not.
"We've got twice as many
people taking advantage of the
budget, but we don't have twice
as much money," he notes. "Our
ball budget, for example, only
went up 30 percent."
Because there are only 11
courts in the deGuerre complex,
the combined teams will only
have 22 members — probably 12
men and 10 women, although
Gould says no arbitrary numbers
of men and women have been
decided.
No JV Teams
The merger allows for no
junior varsity teams, except in

football.
"It's really too bad that
there's no JV team," Gould says.
"With tennis especially, you'll
get kids who maybe had a good
high school or national
reputation; but with only 10 or
12 spaces on the team, there's
really no chance for them to
grow in a team position.
"Last summer we had an IBM
printout of 186 freshmen who
were interested in the men's
tennis team," Gould continues.
"Now last year we had 30 men
on the varsity and JV teams."
Chance To Play
"A lot of people went out for
the team just for a chance to
play tennis. There aren't enough
courts to go around."
Gould says he feels his 1975
fourth-place team has a good
chance to recapture the national
title next year.
"It's going to be tougher this
time," he says."The teams to
beat will definitely be UCLA,
USC, Michigan, Miami,
Pepperdine and San Jose State."
Stanford was both the 1973
and 1974 NCAA tennis
champions, and the 1972
runner-up. Their dynasty was
toppled this year as UCLA
claimed the 1975 crown.
Weakened Team
The men's team will be
weakened next year with the
departure of four varsity players.
Seniors Jim Delaney, Chip
Fisher and Tim Noonan have
graduated, while junior John
Whitlinger, 1974 NCAA singles
and doubles champ, has left
school to turn pro.
But Gould says there are two
top freshman coming in this fall,
as well as a few JV members
who will join the varsity team,
making for "at least 10 bonafide
men's players."

and 1974 NCAA tennis
champions, and the 1972
runner-up. Their dynasty was
toppled this year as UCLA
claimed the 1975 crown.
Weakened Team
The men's team will be
weakened next year with the
departure of four varsity players.
Seniors Jim Delaney, Chip
Fisher and Tim Noonan have
graduated, while junior John
Whitlinger, 1974 NCAA singles
and doubles champ, has left
school to turn pro.
But Gould says there are two
top freshman coming in this fall,
as well as a few JV members
who will join the varsity team,
making for "at least 10 bonafide
men's players."
Hill says the'women's team
"will be able to maintain a good
tradition" next year. Stanford
placed second in the nationals at
Kalamazoo, Mich, this year,
losing only to Trinity.
Three freshmen coming in
this year — Susan Hagey (sister
of Stanford star Chico Hagey),
Barbara Jordan and Diane
Morrison were among the top 10
juniors nationally. Added to
current stars Lele Forood, Marcy
O'Keefe and Liza Pande, Hill
says the six will make a strong
nucleus, aided by daily, more
structured practices.
