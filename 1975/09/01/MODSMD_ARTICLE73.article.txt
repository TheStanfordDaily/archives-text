# Stanford: A Country Club?
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
"It's a great country club"—
Sophomore Scott Mayer, during
last year's freshman orientation.
Although it doesn't charge an
annual membership fee, other
than tuition, Stanford may just
be the greatest country club in
the Bay Area. The recreational
facilities on The Farm rival those
of any club you care to name.
In the morning you can get in
a quick nine holes up at the
Stanford golf course and cool
off with a quick swim at the
deGuerre pools in the afternoon.
There's something for every
taste and new students will
probably want to avail
themselves of The Farm's
recreational facilities before the
academic grind begins. The
following is a list of recreational
facilities available for use by
members of the Stanford
community:
Basketball: Maples Pavilion is
open 11:45 a.m.—1:15 p.m.
Monday through Friday. You
should watch for notices of
closing due to preparation for
basketball games, once the
season begins. The Roble Gym is
also available for basketball.
Check with the Roble Gym
office.
Swimming: The deGuerre
pools, opened in 1973, provide
Stanford with the finest aquatic

facilities on the Peninsula. It is
open from 12-2 p.m. on Monday
through Friday and Saturday
and Sunday from 12-4 p.m.,
except game days. The Roble
pools are also available for
swimming.
Tennis: All tennis courts are
open in the morning until 10
a.m. and after 5 p.m. The Roble
and Encina courts are open all
day Fridays. There are also
tennis courts at Palo Alto High
School and most of the parks in
the Palo Alto area.
Handball/Squash: Signups are
required for the deGuerre
courts, which are open from 11
a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through
Friday, and Saturday and
Sunday from 12 to 5 p.m.
Weightlifting: The Encina
weight room is open Monday
through Friday from 7:30 a.m.
to 3 p.m. It is also open
weekdays from 5 to 6 p.m.
Jogging: Angell Field is
always open for jogging.
Lacrosse: The lacrosse field,
which is in front of deGuerre
pool, is open until 2 p.m. every

day.
Football and Soccer: The
football and soccer fields are not
available and the Roble field is
available by arrangement only.
Softball: The IM softball field
is open every day in the
morning.
Golf: The Stanford golf
course is available to students.
You should call the clubhouse
for student rates and hours.
Student rates are not in effect
weekends. The 18-hole Stanford
course is one of the finest on the
Peninsula.
Hiking: If you don't mind
getting chased off by cows and
getting your knees skinned,
there are many hiking trails in
the Stanford foothills.
Horseback Riding: Check
with the Stanford stables for
rates and hours. There are also a
couple other stables located in
the Stanford area.
Sailing: Lake Lagunita is
available for sailing in the spring.
You could try it now, but you
wouldn't get very far. Searsville
lake is also available for sailing
year round.

JUST PART OF THE SHOW—Many people think Heisman Trophy
winner Jim Plunkett was Stanford's only great athlete. The truth is
that The Farm has produced many great athletes and has a rich
athletic legacy. But he's still a big part of it.
