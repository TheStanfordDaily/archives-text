# From Nevers To Plunkett
## Stanford Athletics: A Rich History 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Ask any local "Son of
Stanford Red" and he'll tell you
that since the immortal football
coach Walter Camp tossed out
the first football on The Farm in
1892, the Cardinals-nee-Indians
have won 469, lost 239 and tied
46 games. He'll also tell you that
Stanford has appeared in 11
Rose Bowl Games, produced 37
All-Americans, 12 members of
the National Football
Foundation Hall of Fame and a
Heisman Trophy Winner —
quarterback Jim Plunkett.
But he'll quickly point out
that success isn't limited to the
football field. Like Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon, the
Stanford athletic department
stresses diversity. And it's
worked. Cardinal athletes have
brought home 14 NCAA team
championships, a host of
individual NCAA crowns and
been to 11 Rose Bowl Games.
In recent years the most
successful sport has been tennis,
where coach Dick Gould's squad
won two NCAA team titles in a
row (1973 and 1974). The Cards
have amassed five singles

championships and 10 doubles
crowns.
Stanford has contributed
numerous players to the ranks of
professional tennis. Although
the NCAA singles crown eluded
him, Roscoe Tanner would have
to rank as Stanford's best player
in the professional ranks. Tanner
is the tenth ranked player in the
world. Following close behind is
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, who won
the doubles crown at Wimbledon
this year and was named most
valuable player of the New York
Sets.
Track
Stanford's track team has
fallen on some hard times of
late, but it has an illustrious
past. The Cards have won three
NCAA team championships,
some 30 individual NCAA
championships and contributed
a lot of tracksters to the
Olympics.
Stanford's Ben Eastman
revolutionized middle-distance
running by breaking the world
records for the quarter and half
miles within a two week period
back in 1932. But most Stanford
track buffs would probably
agree that Bob Mathias is the
Cardinals' greatest track and
field athlete. Mathias is the only
man to win the Olympic
decathlon twice (1948 and
1952). Mathias also starred for
the football team.
Although it has only won one
national title in basketball,
Stanford has had a rich (as in
Kelley) basketball history. The
three time All-Pac-8 center Rich
Kelley, who recently signed a
lucrative professional basketball
contract with the New Orleans
Jazz, is the greatest Cardinal
cage star.
Rewrote Records
The seven foot center
virtually rewrote the Stanford
record book. He passed the
legendary Hank Luisetti, moving
into third place on the all-time
Stanford scoring list and
captured the career rebounding
title.
But Kelley's most important
contribution to Stanford sports
history came in a single
weekend. Kelley scored 52
points and grabbed 28 rebounds
in the "Maples Miracle" — the
Cards' back-to-back wins over
UCLA and USC last January.
Although it may seem that
the Bruin coach John Wooden
revolutionized college

basketball, it was Stanford's
Luisetti who modernized the
game. Luisetti changed
basketball from a two-handed
set-shot game into the modern
version with his running,
jumping one-handed push shot.
Swimming
Stanford swimming teams
have dominated the Pacific
Coast for many years and the
aqua men won a spectacular
victory in the 1967 NCAA
championships.
Swimming coach Jim
Gaughran's brightest star has
been Olympic gold-medalist
John Hencken. The breaststroker
won the NCAA crown for two
straight years.
The sport that has produced
the most NCAA team titles is
golf, where coach Bud Finger's
duffers have brought home six
NCAA team titles. Stanford has
produced its share of
professional golfers too. Tom
Watson became the biggest name
recently, with h is
come-from-behind victory in the
British Open Golf Tournament
this summer.
In baseball the Cards have
won several Pac-8 pennants,
played in the Collegiate World
Series at Omaha twice and
developed seven All-Americans.
Stanford's most famous
contribution to professional
baseball would have to be Cy

Young Award winner Jim
Lonborg of the Philadelphia
Phillies.
In 1967 Lonborg led the
cellar-dwelling Boston Red Sox
to the world series, posting a
22-9 record, striking out 246
batters and easily walking away
with the Cy Young Award.
Football Lore
But getting back to football,
there have been some real glory
days in Stanford history. The
famous "Vow Boys," who
played in three consecutive Hose
Bowls — a feat which had never
been accomplished before —
allowed their opponents just
99 points in 31 games.
The "Vow Boys" led by
halfback Bones Hamilton, got
their nickname by vowing never
to lose to USC and they didn't.
The Clark Shaughnessy
coached "Wow Boys of 1940"
had the most profound effect on
the game of football of any team
in history. Shaughnessy installed
the ancient straight T formation
in college football and won ten
straight games, including a Rose
Bowl victory over Nebraska.
Two years after Shaughnessy
had installed the T formation at
Stanford, virtually every college
and professional team was
running from his formation.
And who could forget John
Ralston, the ice cream eating
coach who motivated his

"Thunderchickens" to two
straight Rose Bowl wins.
Ralston's 1970 and '71 squad
brought The Farm back into the
national spotlight by dethroning
USC from the Pac-8 throne
room.
Plunkett
Plunkett passed for 7544
yards during his career at
Stanford. Mike Boryla. who
turned the Philadelphia Eagles
into a contender last year, holds
down the second place spot on
the Cardinal career passing chart,
with 4082 yards.
Don Bunce never played in
the NFL, but Stanford fans hold
a special place in their hearts for
him. Playing behind Plunkett for
two years, Bunce stepped in to
lead the Cardinals to a 1972
Rose Bowl victory over
Michigan.
Ernie Nevers has been called
the greatest running back ever to
play college football and he may
be. His greatest game came in
the 1925 Rose Bowl against
Notre Dame.
This classic matched Nevers
and Stanford coach Pop Warner
against the Four Horsemen and
Knute Rockne. Although the
Irish won the game, in this last
ride of the Horsemen, Nevers
still managed to gain 114 yards
despite playing on heavily taped
ankles which had been broken
during the regular season.
Ask any local "Son of
Stanford Red" and he'll tell you
that since the immortal football
coach Walter Camp tossed out
the first football on The Farm in
1892, the Cardinals-nee-Indians

won several Pac-8 pennants,
played in the Collegiate World
Series at Omaha twice and
developed seven All-Americans.
Stanford's most famous
contribution to professional
baseball would have to be Cy

Young Award winner Jim
Lonborg of the Philadelphia
Phillies.
In 1967 Lonborg led the
cellar-dwelling Boston Red Sox
to the world series, posting a
22-9 record, striking out 246
batters and easily walking away
with the Cy Young Award.
Football Lore
But getting back to football,
there have been some real glory
days in Stanford history. The
famous "Vow Boys," who
played in three consecutive Hose
Bowls — a feat which had never
been accomplished before —
allowed their opponents just
99 points in 31 games.
The "Vow Boys" led by
halfback Bones Hamilton, got
their nickname by vowing never
to lose to USC and they didn't.
The Clark Shaughnessy
coached "Wow Boys of 1940"
had the most profound effect on
the game of football of any team
in history. Shaughnessy installed
the ancient straight T formation
in college football and won ten
straight games, including a Rose
Bowl victory over Nebraska.
Two years after Shaughnessy
had installed the T formation at
Stanford, virtually every college
and professional team was
running from his formation.
And who could forget John
Ralston, the ice cream eating
coach who motivated his

"Thunderchickens" to two
straight Rose Bowl wins.
Ralston's 1970 and '71 squad
brought The Farm back into the
national spotlight by dethroning
USC from the Pac-8 throne
room.
Plunkett
Plunkett passed for 7544
yards during his career at
Stanford. Mike Boryla. who
turned the Philadelphia Eagles
into a contender last year, holds
down the second place spot on
the Cardinal career passing chart,
with 4082 yards.
Don Bunce never played in
the NFL, but Stanford fans hold
a special place in their hearts for
him. Playing behind Plunkett for
two years, Bunce stepped in to
lead the Cardinals to a 1972
Rose Bowl victory over
Michigan.
Ernie Nevers has been called
the greatest running back ever to
play college football and he may
be. His greatest game came in
the 1925 Rose Bowl against
Notre Dame.
This classic matched Nevers
and Stanford coach Pop Warner
against the Four Horsemen and
Knute Rockne. Although the
Irish won the game, in this last
ride of the Horsemen, Nevers
still managed to gain 114 yards
despite playing on heavily taped
ankles which had been broken
during the regular season.
Ask any local "Son of
Stanford Red" and he'll tell you
that since the immortal football
coach Walter Camp tossed out
the first football on The Farm in
1892, the Cardinals-nee-Indians
have won 469, lost 239 and tied
46 games. He'll also tell you that
Stanford has appeared in 11
Rose Bowl Games, produced 37
All-Americans, 12 members of
the National Football
Foundation Hall of Fame and a
Heisman Trophy Winner —
quarterback Jim Plunkett.
But he'll quickly point out
that success isn't limited to the
football field. Like Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon, the
Stanford athletic department
stresses diversity. And it's
worked. Cardinal athletes have
brought home 14 NCAA team
championships, a host of
individual NCAA crowns and
been to 11 Rose Bowl Games.
In recent years the most
successful sport has been tennis,
where coach Dick Gould's squad
won two NCAA team titles in a
row (1973 and 1974). The Cards
have amassed five singles

championships and 10 doubles
crowns.
Stanford has contributed
numerous players to the ranks of
professional tennis. Although
the NCAA singles crown eluded
him, Roscoe Tanner would have
to rank as Stanford's best player
in the professional ranks. Tanner
is the tenth ranked player in the
world. Following close behind is
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, who won
the doubles crown at Wimbledon
this year and was named most
valuable player of the New York
Sets.
Track
Stanford's track team has
fallen on some hard times of
late, but it has an illustrious
past. The Cards have won three
NCAA team championships,
some 30 individual NCAA
championships and contributed
a lot of tracksters to the
Olympics.
Stanford's Ben Eastman
revolutionized middle-distance
running by breaking the world
records for the quarter and half
miles within a two week period
back in 1932. But most Stanford
track buffs would probably
agree that Bob Mathias is the
Cardinals' greatest track and
field athlete. Mathias is the only
man to win the Olympic
decathlon twice (1948 and
1952). Mathias also starred for
the football team.
Although it has only won one
national title in basketball,
Stanford has had a rich (as in
Kelley) basketball history. The
three time All-Pac-8 center Rich
Kelley, who recently signed a
lucrative professional basketball
contract with the New Orleans
Jazz, is the greatest Cardinal
cage star.
Rewrote Records
The seven foot center
virtually rewrote the Stanford
record book. He passed the
legendary Hank Luisetti, moving
into third place on the all-time
Stanford scoring list and
captured the career rebounding
title.
But Kelley's most important
contribution to Stanford sports
history came in a single
weekend. Kelley scored 52
points and grabbed 28 rebounds
in the "Maples Miracle" — the
Cards' back-to-back wins over
UCLA and USC last January.
Although it may seem that
the Bruin coach John Wooden
revolutionized college

basketball, it was Stanford's
Luisetti who modernized the
game. Luisetti changed
basketball from a two-handed
set-shot game into the modern
version with his running,
jumping one-handed push shot.
Swimming
Stanford swimming teams
have dominated the Pacific
Coast for many years and the
aqua men won a spectacular
victory in the 1967 NCAA
championships.
Swimming coach Jim
Gaughran's brightest star has
been Olympic gold-medalist
John Hencken. The breaststroker
won the NCAA crown for two
straight years.
The sport that has produced
the most NCAA team titles is
golf, where coach Bud Finger's
duffers have brought home six
NCAA team titles. Stanford has
produced its share of
professional golfers too. Tom
Watson became the biggest name
recently, with h is
come-from-behind victory in the
British Open Golf Tournament
this summer.

world. Following close behind is
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, who won
the doubles crown at Wimbledon
this year and was named most
valuable player of the New York
Sets.
Track
Stanford's track team has
fallen on some hard times of
late, but it has an illustrious
past. The Cards have won three
NCAA team championships,
some 30 individual NCAA
championships and contributed
a lot of tracksters to the
Olympics.
Stanford's Ben Eastman
revolutionized middle-distance
running by breaking the world
records for the quarter and half
miles within a two week period
back in 1932. But most Stanford
track buffs would probably
agree that Bob Mathias is the
Cardinals' greatest track and
field athlete. Mathias is the only
man to win the Olympic
decathlon twice (1948 and
1952). Mathias also starred for
the football team.
Although it has only won one
national title in basketball,
Stanford has had a rich (as in
Kelley) basketball history. The
three time All-Pac-8 center Rich
Kelley, who recently signed a
lucrative professional basketball
contract with the New Orleans
Jazz, is the greatest Cardinal
cage star.
Rewrote Records
The seven foot center
virtually rewrote the Stanford
record book. He passed the
legendary Hank Luisetti, moving
into third place on the all-time
Stanford scoring list and
captured the career rebounding
title.
But Kelley's most important
contribution to Stanford sports
history came in a single
weekend. Kelley scored 52
points and grabbed 28 rebounds
in the "Maples Miracle" — the
Cards' back-to-back wins over
UCLA and USC last January.
Although it may seem that
the Bruin coach John Wooden
revolutionized college

basketball, it was Stanford's
Luisetti who modernized the
game. Luisetti changed
basketball from a two-handed
set-shot game into the modern
version with his running,
jumping one-handed push shot.
Swimming
Stanford swimming teams
have dominated the Pacific
Coast for many years and the
aqua men won a spectacular
victory in the 1967 NCAA
championships.
Swimming coach Jim
Gaughran's brightest star has
been Olympic gold-medalist
John Hencken. The breaststroker
won the NCAA crown for two
straight years.
The sport that has produced
the most NCAA team titles is
golf, where coach Bud Finger's
duffers have brought home six
NCAA team titles. Stanford has
produced its share of
professional golfers too. Tom
Watson became the biggest name
recently, with h is
come-from-behind victory in the
British Open Golf Tournament
this summer.
In baseball the Cards have
won several Pac-8 pennants,
played in the Collegiate World
Series at Omaha twice and
developed seven All-Americans.
Stanford's most famous
contribution to professional
baseball would have to be Cy

Young Award winner Jim
Lonborg of the Philadelphia
Phillies.
In 1967 Lonborg led the
cellar-dwelling Boston Red Sox
to the world series, posting a
22-9 record, striking out 246
batters and easily walking away
with the Cy Young Award.
Football Lore
But getting back to football,
there have been some real glory
days in Stanford history. The
famous "Vow Boys," who
played in three consecutive Hose
Bowls — a feat which had never
been accomplished before —
allowed their opponents just
99 points in 31 games.
The "Vow Boys" led by
halfback Bones Hamilton, got
their nickname by vowing never
to lose to USC and they didn't.
The Clark Shaughnessy
coached "Wow Boys of 1940"
had the most profound effect on
the game of football of any team
in history. Shaughnessy installed
the ancient straight T formation
in college football and won ten
straight games, including a Rose
Bowl victory over Nebraska.
Two years after Shaughnessy
had installed the T formation at
Stanford, virtually every college
and professional team was
running from his formation.
And who could forget John
Ralston, the ice cream eating
coach who motivated his

"Thunderchickens" to two
straight Rose Bowl wins.
Ralston's 1970 and '71 squad
brought The Farm back into the
national spotlight by dethroning
USC from the Pac-8 throne
room.
Plunkett
Plunkett passed for 7544
yards during his career at
Stanford. Mike Boryla. who
turned the Philadelphia Eagles
into a contender last year, holds
down the second place spot on
the Cardinal career passing chart,
with 4082 yards.
Don Bunce never played in
the NFL, but Stanford fans hold
a special place in their hearts for
him. Playing behind Plunkett for
two years, Bunce stepped in to
lead the Cardinals to a 1972
Rose Bowl victory over
Michigan.
Ernie Nevers has been called
the greatest running back ever to
play college football and he may
be. His greatest game came in
the 1925 Rose Bowl against
Notre Dame.
This classic matched Nevers
and Stanford coach Pop Warner
against the Four Horsemen and
Knute Rockne. Although the
Irish won the game, in this last
ride of the Horsemen, Nevers
still managed to gain 114 yards
despite playing on heavily taped
ankles which had been broken
during the regular season.
Ask any local "Son of
Stanford Red" and he'll tell you
that since the immortal football
coach Walter Camp tossed out
the first football on The Farm in
1892, the Cardinals-nee-Indians
have won 469, lost 239 and tied
46 games. He'll also tell you that
Stanford has appeared in 11
Rose Bowl Games, produced 37
All-Americans, 12 members of
the National Football
Foundation Hall of Fame and a
Heisman Trophy Winner —
quarterback Jim Plunkett.
But he'll quickly point out
that success isn't limited to the
football field. Like Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon, the
Stanford athletic department
stresses diversity. And it's
worked. Cardinal athletes have
brought home 14 NCAA team
championships, a host of
individual NCAA crowns and
been to 11 Rose Bowl Games.
In recent years the most
successful sport has been tennis,
where coach Dick Gould's squad
won two NCAA team titles in a
row (1973 and 1974). The Cards
have amassed five singles

championships and 10 doubles
crowns.
Stanford has contributed
numerous players to the ranks of
professional tennis. Although
the NCAA singles crown eluded
him, Roscoe Tanner would have
to rank as Stanford's best player
in the professional ranks. Tanner
is the tenth ranked player in the
world. Following close behind is
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, who won
the doubles crown at Wimbledon
this year and was named most

"Thunderchickens" to two
straight Rose Bowl wins.
Ralston's 1970 and '71 squad
brought The Farm back into the
national spotlight by dethroning
USC from the Pac-8 throne
room.
Plunkett
Plunkett passed for 7544
yards during his career at
Stanford. Mike Boryla. who
turned the Philadelphia Eagles
into a contender last year, holds
down the second place spot on
the Cardinal career passing chart,
with 4082 yards.
Don Bunce never played in
the NFL, but Stanford fans hold
a special place in their hearts for
him. Playing behind Plunkett for
two years, Bunce stepped in to
lead the Cardinals to a 1972
Rose Bowl victory over
Michigan.
Ernie Nevers has been called
the greatest running back ever to
play college football and he may
be. His greatest game came in
the 1925 Rose Bowl against
Notre Dame.
This classic matched Nevers
and Stanford coach Pop Warner
against the Four Horsemen and
Knute Rockne. Although the
Irish won the game, in this last
ride of the Horsemen, Nevers
still managed to gain 114 yards
despite playing on heavily taped
ankles which had been broken
during the regular season.
