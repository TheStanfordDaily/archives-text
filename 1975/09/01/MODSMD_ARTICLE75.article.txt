# IM's Are For Everyone
## 
### 
You don't have to be a Mike Cordova or Tim
Patterson to participate in athletics at Stanford.
Most of the 2000 students that participate in the
intramural program certainly aren't Cordova or
Patterson-types, but they have just as much fun.
Intramural teams are organized through living
groups, eating clubs, graduate schools and social
organizations. All IM sports are coed and this year
there will be an all-women's IM program. Teams
are grouped in divisions, which are in turn divided
into leagues. Each team must select a manager,
who represents his squad at all intramural
meetings and is responsible for seeing that team
members are notified of games.
The first meeting for team managers will be
Thursday, Oct. 2 at 4 p.m. in Encina Gym.
Activities this fall will include touch football,
cross country, basketball free throws, golf, tennis
doubles and two-player volleyball.
Most sports are organized into divisions, which
are in turn divided into leagues. Bowling will use a
league format and players will be assigned
handicaps. The other sports will be single
elimination tournaments, with the exception of

the one-day wrestling and cross country events.
There's something for every taste among the
25 intramural sports that will be offered. Here's a
partial listing of sports which have been offered in
the past: Basketball, basketball free throws, a bike
race, badminton, bowling, a canoe race,
cross country, golf, gymnastics, handball,
horseshoes, pocket billiards, squash, soccer,
Softball, swimming and diving, table tennis, tennis
(singles and doubles), toucn football, track and
field, volleyball (two and six player), water polo,
weight lifting, and wrestling.
Some groups, such as the four-time intramural
champion Theta Dtlts, live and die with
intramurals. But that's not the way it has to be.
Your team can be as competitive as it chooses.
But no one is going to spot you walking in
White Plaza and sign you up for their team. You
have to make the effort to get involved in IM
sports. If you make the effort you may feel like
this IM basketball player did alter last year:
"Our team probably would have done better if
we had forfeited all our games ... at least we
would have lost all our games 2-0. But it was the
best team I've ever played on, and the first."
