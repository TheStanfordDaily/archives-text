# Alumni Association Boasts 40,000 Paying Members
## 
### 
Directly behind Tresidder
Memorial Union and across
the street from the Old
Firehouse is Bowman Alumni
House, modern headquarters
of the independent Stanford
Alumni Association.
Founded "to promote the
interests of Stanford
University and to maintain a
mutually beneficial
relationship between the
University and its alumni,"
the Association now has
40,000 dues-paying members.
More than half of all living
Stanford graduates belong.
The Association provides a
variety of facilities and
programs for alumni and
friends of the University.
Delia van Heyst, associate

director and director of
publications, is responsible
for three successful
publications The Stanford
Magazine, the Alumni
Almanac section of the
University's Observer, and the
award-winning Portable
Stanford reading series.
Sierra Camp
The Association owns and
operates the Stanford Sierra
Camp at Fallen Leaf Lake
and operates the Stanford
Alpine Chalet at Alpine
Meadows near Lake Tahoe,
both of which are directed by
Franklin Hildreth.
It conducts travel/study
tours here and abroad,
supports some 60 local
Stanford clubs throughout

the world, stages the annual
Campus Conference, assists
with the annual Los Angeles
Conference, and aids
Stanford classes with their
reunions.
It has been putting
increased emphasis on
educational offerings for
alumni. Its annual 10-day
Summer Alumni College on
campus has achieved national
recognition. Through its
"Day College" program, the
Association carries some of
the intellectual substance of
the University to alumni in
cities from New York to San
Diego.
'Assist Students'
"But while our first
concern must be with alumni,

we are eager to assist current
students in any way we can,"
Newell said.
Bowman houses the
student-operated
Sta nf or d-in-Govern men t
program, an activity designed
to find internships in local,
state and federal government
offices for current students.
Working in cooperation
with the Career Planning and
Placement Center, the
Association arranges for
meetings between
knowledgeable alumni and
students seeking career
guidance.
Needs
The "SAA Quarter
Course," originally designed
to meet the needs of spouses

of graduate students, has
been expanded to encourage
others to attend as well.
The Stanford Sierra Camp
provides employment each
summer for 40 students who
constitute the Camp's staff â€”
"and its greatest asset,"
according to Hildreth.
"We serve as a bridge
between the alumni and
students, for alumni get a lot
of personal satisfaction out of
lending a hand to students -
and so does the staff at
Bowman," he added.
Membership in the
Association is open to present
and former Stanford
students. Both Annual and
Life Memberships are offered.
