# Famished Frosh Fight Fat
## 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Each year thousands of unsuspecting
coeds meet with the same treacherous fate:
they get fat — not too fat (at the most 15 or
20 pounds over weight), but just fat enough
so that all their favorite pants from high
school and all the new clothes they bought
for college no longer fit.
Most are away from home for the first
time and dealing with a weight problem
alone can be very hard. A lot of girls refuse
to admit they've gained, making excuses
instead.
Says Phyllis F., now a senior at Yale
University: "I kept convincing myself that
the reason my pants wouldn't zip was not
because I had put on weight, but because I
had inadvertently shrunk them in the
dryer."
The end result is the same — a year of
wearing stretch pants with elasticized waist
bands; full, gathered skirts; and long,
camouflaging tunics — but the causes are
many.
Starchburgers
The most likely cause is dormitory food,
so notoriously high in starch. If the
dormitory food is exciting, tantalizing and
exotic, you'll eat it, enjoy it, and have some
more. You'll also get fat.
"It was like eating at an expensive
restaurant every day,"says Becky S. from
Mills College. "We were just inundated with
food we couldn't always have at home —
french fries, tacos, lasagna — you could eat
as much as you wanted and there was no
one there to say you couldn't."
On the other hand, if the dormitory food
is unappealing, you'll just push it around on
your plate. Inevitably, hunger pangs will
strike, so you'll hop in the car with some
friends and go to Jack's for a late night
hamburger and chocolate shake, or to the
downtown donut joint for three old
fashioneds smothered in chocolate glaze.
For a quick snack you can settle a
growling stomach with a Hershey bar from
the candy machine down the hall. But, in
any case, you'll get fat.
If the food service doesn't get the best of
you, your emotions most likely will. The
social and academic pressures of that first
year of college can be a strain on anyone.
Dr. Albert Stunkard, a psychiatrist at
Stanford, explains; "Stress will lead you to
exaggerate your tendencies — for some
people that means eating more, for others
it's eating less."
Says Alison C., a sophomore at Stanford
who gained seven pounds in the first three
months of school last year, "I didn't smoke
or drink, so if I was mad or happy or bored
or depressed, I'd want to eat. And around
school, I was either mad or happy or bored
or depressed."
Obsession
Emotional eating is nothing new, but at
college, eating can turn into an
all-consuming activity. "My roommate and I
decided that we were either thinking about
or eating food 75 percent of the time," adds
Alison.
Nancy F., a senior at the University of
California at Santa Cruz, remembers when

she was home on vacation her freshman
year. "I began describing a certain dessert I
had eaten to my mother. She interrupted
me and said, 'You may not know it Nancy,
but you're actually glowing.' My eyes had
lit up and I had a huge smile on my face like
a Cheshire cat.
"I knew then that eating had become a
substitute for things that were missing from
my college life. All of my friends had paired
up with boys, and I hadn't."
Love
Love, or lack of it, is an enemy to the
calorie-conscious female, but general
depression is the true foe. "I would get
really depressed and say 'what the hell,' "
recalls Heidi H., a junior at Stanford.
"I'd buy a large package of Oreos and eat
the whole thing. If someone had the nerve
to ask for one, I'd give one away but then
I'd feel deprived."
Heidi adds that when her depressions got
worse, she would make "concoctions" like
peanut butter on a stale tortilla or crumbs
of cereal over ice cream. "When that
happens," she says, "you know food is no
longer just a pleasure. It's a madness."
When food was around, Heidi says she'd
eat it, j.it later feel guilty about what she
had consumed. "One evening," she says,"I
went out for dinner and had pizza, garlic
bread and a handful of mints as I left the
restaurant. I figured I just blew it, so I
might as well really blow it. I went to the
candy machine in the dorm and bought apair
of Hostess Twinkies. Then I decided to
make an evening of it, and at midnight I
bought another pair, then another, and by
the end of the evening I had consumed eight
cupcakes.
"I was very careful that night not to eat
anything with chocolate in it so I wouldn't
get pimples, so I finished up with a package
of six cheese crackers filled with peanut
butter. I knew I was making myself sick,
but I figured I'd make myself even sicker."
Entertainment
To break up the monotony of going to
class or sitting in the library - the same daily
routine — food also can serve as a source of
entertainment. Eating is an activity that
anyone from any part of the country and
from any background can take part in.
"After we had sufficiently stuffed
ourselves at Sunday dinner, the big
excitement for a group of girls was to gather
around the posted menu listing the week's
meals, and to discuss what the good days
were going to be," says Becky.
One of the most enjoyable activities for a
group of people with nothing to do on a
Saturday night is to go out and eat. Debbie
K., a senior at UCLA, recalls, "One night a
bunch of uswent outon our bicycles and we
just did Westwood. First we went to a pizza
parlor, then to an ice cream parlor, and we
finished up at the pie shop. It was fun, but
it was like we were all trying to gross each
other out."
The lifestyle at college means studying
more and doing less physical activity. You
eat a meal and sit in class. Eat a meal and sit
in the library. Eat a meal and go to bed.
Plus, a physical education class may not be

required, as it was in high school. What does
it all add up to? Secretary spread.
Diet Time
Eventually almost every college woman
— no matter how or why she put on weight
freshman year — gets a good look at herself
in the mirror and decides to put herself on a
diet.
"I'll never forget the shock I suffered
one day. I was lying on my bed in my
underwear. I sat up and turned towards the
mirror behind the door and suddenly caught
a glimpse of myself," shudders Elizabeth. "I
saw folds of fat along my side. That's when
I knew I had overdone it."
But the diets freshman women attempt
usually fail. Stunkard explains, "If one of
the things that happens to you when you're
under pressure [to diet] is that you eat
more, then you're in real trouble."
It's a vicious circle. Dieting puts you in a
quandary because you don't want to give up
what you enjoy doing most — what you do
with your friends on a Saturday night, or
what you depend upon after a long night of
studying.
Crash Diets
To make the pain of dieting last for
shortest amount of time possible, most
people elect some form of crash diet. So, on
Sunday night, the night before the diet is
scheduled to begin, you have a feast. (Even
if on Tuesday you decide to begin a diet, it
won't start until Monday — diets always
begin on Monday.)
Says Heidi, "It's like someone who
knows she's going to be executed. You try
to live it up as much as you can
beforehand."
Growing Pains
Freshman fat - like pimples and puberty
— may just be another of the growing pains
one has to suffer. The uncertainty of a
sudden change in habitat, the struggle to
meet new friends and the pressures that
accompany a residential college life afflict
everyone.
Some fledgling intellectuals want to
drown those sorrows and pains, and they
find that eating can provide that needed
outlet.
But sophomore year might promise not
to be as emotion-ridden. Many girls are able
to shed their tunics and stretch pants. They
find the food on campus dull, unexciting
and inedible. They begin to see yesterday's
greasy hamburgers in today's starchy
casserole. The repertoire of once delectable
dishes has been exhausted. The thrill is
gone.
And they look at the frosh — stuffing
themselves with stale cookies, soggy
strawberry pies and wilted salads. They see
a little bit of themselves as they were the
year before. Being a sophomore is being
somebody. You know it all. You've
experienced it all and no longer need to
say Lewis Carroll's words:
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
"Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath
And all of us are fat/"
