"The outstanding aspect of the building
of the new law school has been the
extraordinary generosity of individuals,
some not lawyers, which made it possible
to build something on this scale,"
commented Professor John Merryman,
chairman of the physical plant committee
for the new law school.
Two hundred individuals, foundations,
and corporations, three-fourths of the
individuals alumni of Stanford Law School,
contributed $9.9 million for the
construction of the new facility. Another
$2 million was contributed by Stanford
University from its PACE Fund effort.
Two multi-million dollar contributions
provided nearly one-half of the total
construction costs. One such contribution
came from the Estate of Lucie Stern,
widow of an heir to the Levi Strauss
garment business.
In tribute to the memory of Lucie
Stern, Stanford Law School has designated
all scholarship assistance from the general
unrestricted funds of the Law School as
Lucie Stern Scholarships.
The other multi-million dollar
contribution came from the family of
Henry Crown, in memory of Robert
Crown. The administrative building has
been named the Robert Crown Library and
the entire complex Crown Quadrangle in
appreciation of the Crown family's
generosity.
The Kresge Foundation, a professional
fund for higher education building support
founded by the Kresge dime-store family,
and Frederick I. Richman, '28, each gave
over $1 million for the new law school.
The auditorium and classroom building
respectively bear their names.
