# STUDENT NOTES
## Lost in the Shuffle: Transfers Introduce Selves to Stanford 
### Robin Johansen 
Some things get lost in the shuffle, and
this year's transfer students may be the
prime example. They total fourteen, nine
of them actual transfers into the second
year class, and five non-matriculating
students students who will finish at
Stanford but receive their degrees
elsewhere.
A recent Journal interview with nine of
these students revealed that literally
nothing special had been done for them,
and in fact they had, on occasion, been
denied the equal protection of Stanford's
administrative law.
According to George Lee, a
non-matriculating student from the
University of Pennsylvania: "We were told
to register like everyone else, and I stood in
line like everyone else for an hour. When I
finally reached the desk, I was told we
were supposed to register somewhere else."
That "somewhere else" was the old
Union, according to another "non-matric"
who waited two hours only to find she was
unknown over there. Apparently the law
school had neglected to tell them she was
coming.
Last Priority
Mistakes will be made, of course,
particularly in the confusion of a new
building with new procedures. But one
policy that is no mistake and
understandably troublesome to the
non-matriculating student is that of "last
priority" for writing courses. The policy,
according to Michelle Rubin, "is the same
at all the schools in the area. They say
since they're not giving us the degree, they
want to give their own students first
priority."
While most felt that it made some sense,
it did raise problems for students like
Wanda McNeil, who needed a professional
responsibility course to graduate and had
to make her own arrangements for directed
research.
Registration hassles were not reserved
for the non-matriculating students alone.
Some transfers had no permits to register, a
fact they learned only after they, too, had
stood in line for an hour.
And while they did have mailboxes and
lockers, unlike the non-matrics, you may

find the alphabetizing somewhat odd. They
are not where they're supposed to be.
Even worse, the non-matrics' name
strips on the mailboxes are done in black.
The overwhelming consensus was that
the major problem was not registration
after all, every one of us is a veteran of that
sort of thing but a general vacuum of
information about what to expect.
Thud!
Dean Keogh confirmed that "nothing
special is done for the transfers. They are
simply dropped into the rest of the student
body as full-fledged Stanford students."
Similarly Emalie Ortega noted that the
Law Association made no social provisions
for transfers. In fact, they were not
included in the Association's one mailing
over the summer.
Unfortunately, many seem to have
landed with a thud and are only just now
getting their bearings. David Andrews
pulled up in his U-Haul with a badly
infected arm and was told he must spend
four days in the hospital, which he did, but
with virtually no knowledge of medical
programs available at the University.
George Lee is commuting from San
Francisco because he is unable to find a
place to live. Others are wondering what all
this business of "Celebration" is about or
how other students knew the assignments
before the first day of class.
And all thought a library tour would be
a great idea. Allan Salzman, a transfer from
the University of Toronto, took the
initiative to sit in on a legal bibliography
class to familiarize himself with American
reporting systems, but others were not sure
that would help (nor was Allan).
They all agreed, however, that they
would like to be informed of orientation
activities, to be able to decide whether to
attend or not.
It became increasingly clear as we talked
that the introductory function was terribly
important, that an attempt was made to fill
it for others who were new, but that these
people just fell between the cracks. (That
the performance of this function was left
to the Law Journal is nothing short of
scandalous.)
Happy Here
The new students were by no means all
sour grapes. "I hope you didn't get the
wrong idea from the discussion," Michelle
Rubin said afterward. "I'm really very
happy to be here."
Others had positive things to say as well.
They found the professors quite accessible
and impressive, "although there seem to be
an awful lot of visiting professors," said
one.
The group differed in assessing
Stanford's famous "non-Socratic"
technique. Some felt it made for more
discussion and less tension, some not.
Wanda McNeil, from Vanderbilt, noted
that "no matter what else you may think
of it, it does act as a leveller. Everybody is
forced to get it. As far as creating

friendship among a class of people, it's
effective; as a teaching tool, it's not so
great."
But David Andrews, from Duke,
thought the Socratic method made the
atmosphere there much more competitive,
if less boring: "Professors here start their
planned lecture and go through it. It gets a
little slow."
Richard Trutanic, from Hastings,
disagreed: "We had to have written briefs
for some of our classes and be ready to
stand up and read them. Some seemed to
go on forever."
Trutanic, found a major difference in
orientation between the two schools: "The
whole curriculum is much more bar
oriented at Hastings. The emphasis is on
learning the law of the case, and required
courses continue into the second year with
Evidence, Corporations, and Conflicts."
As for the students here, they are
"friendlier than in Albany," "younger than
at Hastings," "brighter than at Santa
Clara." That last was believed at least
partly responsible for Stanford's informal
atmosphere people seem less worried
about understanding what's going on in
class, according to David Ifshin. Others put
the emphasis on "seem" and wondered if it
were really so. We told them to ask again
around exams.
Friendly, If Young
The age differential was corroborated
by students from Hastings and Santa Clara.
Sharon Wagner, from Hastings, said, "We
had people from 22 to 57 in our class, and
every age in between."
High tuition may be a factor, they
thought: people who are older may be
reluctant to fall back on their parents again
and so go to a less expensive school like
Hastings or-Boalt.
Are we friendly? Yes individually,
they thought, but the lack of a lounge or
other planned activities made it hard.
One said, "I had a simple question
about an assignment last night, but I
couldn't think of anyone I could call. I
didn't have any phone numbers and knew
very few names." But most were optimistic
that would change when things got
underway and the law lounge opened.
As for the universal bugaboo hours
for the new building this group seems no
different than anyone else: resentful. While
most confessed that they would not often
use the library past midnight, it was the
thought that it was unavailable in a crisis
that counted.
Chuck Theisen said that students at
the University of Arizona were given keys
to the library if they needed to be there
after midnight. The University of
Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt do the same,
according to George Lee and Wanda
McNeil.
Others were not so upset about library
hours as the fact that class and seminar

rooms would be unavilable for evening
study. Some just need a quiet place to
work alone, they said, although all agreed
with Sharon Wagner that the new library is
"a great place to study."
Comity
Reasons for transfering here were as
varied as the group itself some because a
spouse took a new job, some because it was
a chance to go to a better school, and at
least one because "I just wanted to be in
California."
According to Dean Keogh,
non-matriculating students are admitted
for "compelling personal reasons and
institutional comity both."
As for transfer students, they are
admitted as space is available, although
transfers this year slightly outnumber those
who left the present second year class. (Six
will not return and six are on leave for the
year.)
The discrepancy, says the Dean, is
"because we have the facilities and faculty
to handle a few more. It is a very slight
increase [in the first and second year
classes both]. It is not of a size that we go
around saying we are getting that much
bigger."
The application process is essentially the
same for transfers as for first year
applicants, only a little harder, says Keogh.
The most basic difference is that it is a
two-step process the applicant must be
invited to submit an application. Here's
how it works:
The Law School received some two
hundred letters of inquiry last year about
transfers. The number is slowly increasing,
"We tell them what the situation is like,"
says Keogh. "Then we invite a preliminary
letter, and if it has enough information, we
screen on the basis of that. We only invite
transcripts from those we think so far as
we can tell will be competitive."
Credit Confusion
This year that group totalled sixty-five,
from which nine were admitted.
Are there problems transfering credits?
"They seldom occur. Sometimes they have
to take first year courses. Most typically it
has to do with constitutional law or some
aspect of the writing program."
One aspect of credit transfer has the
students baffled: their previous credits
don't officially "vest," as one put it, until
they have completed a year at Stanford.
Several said they had inquired as to credit
problems but "couldn't get a straight
answer" and were told to wait until the
end of the year.
"What do I do if there's a problem
then?" asked one. "It'll be a little late." No
one seemed to know.
If there's one problem facing all the
transfers, it's that no one seems to know
or, if they do, they haven't bothered to
tell. All seem glad to be here, optimistic
about the year ahead, but forced to go it on
their own. It wouldn't take much to give
them a little help.
Some things get lost in the shuffle, and
this year's transfer students may be the
prime example. They total fourteen, nine
of them actual transfers into the second
year class, and five non-matriculating
students students who will finish at

are not where they're supposed to be.
Even worse, the non-matrics' name
strips on the mailboxes are done in black.
The overwhelming consensus was that
the major problem was not registration
after all, every one of us is a veteran of that
sort of thing but a general vacuum of
information about what to expect.
Thud!
Dean Keogh confirmed that "nothing
special is done for the transfers. They are
simply dropped into the rest of the student
body as full-fledged Stanford students."
Similarly Emalie Ortega noted that the
Law Association made no social provisions
for transfers. In fact, they were not
included in the Association's one mailing
over the summer.
Unfortunately, many seem to have
landed with a thud and are only just now
getting their bearings. David Andrews
pulled up in his U-Haul with a badly
infected arm and was told he must spend
four days in the hospital, which he did, but
with virtually no knowledge of medical
programs available at the University.
George Lee is commuting from San
Francisco because he is unable to find a
place to live. Others are wondering what all
this business of "Celebration" is about or
how other students knew the assignments
before the first day of class.
And all thought a library tour would be
a great idea. Allan Salzman, a transfer from
the University of Toronto, took the
initiative to sit in on a legal bibliography
class to familiarize himself with American
reporting systems, but others were not sure
that would help (nor was Allan).
They all agreed, however, that they
would like to be informed of orientation
activities, to be able to decide whether to
attend or not.
It became increasingly clear as we talked
that the introductory function was terribly
important, that an attempt was made to fill
it for others who were new, but that these
people just fell between the cracks. (That
the performance of this function was left
to the Law Journal is nothing short of
scandalous.)
Happy Here
The new students were by no means all
sour grapes. "I hope you didn't get the
wrong idea from the discussion," Michelle
Rubin said afterward. "I'm really very
happy to be here."
Others had positive things to say as well.
They found the professors quite accessible
and impressive, "although there seem to be
an awful lot of visiting professors," said
one.
The group differed in assessing
Stanford's famous "non-Socratic"
technique. Some felt it made for more
discussion and less tension, some not.
Wanda McNeil, from Vanderbilt, noted
that "no matter what else you may think
of it, it does act as a leveller. Everybody is
forced to get it. As far as creating

friendship among a class of people, it's
effective; as a teaching tool, it's not so
great."
But David Andrews, from Duke,
thought the Socratic method made the
atmosphere there much more competitive,
if less boring: "Professors here start their
planned lecture and go through it. It gets a
little slow."
Richard Trutanic, from Hastings,
disagreed: "We had to have written briefs
for some of our classes and be ready to
stand up and read them. Some seemed to
go on forever."
Trutanic, found a major difference in
orientation between the two schools: "The
whole curriculum is much more bar
oriented at Hastings. The emphasis is on
learning the law of the case, and required
courses continue into the second year with
Evidence, Corporations, and Conflicts."
As for the students here, they are
"friendlier than in Albany," "younger than
at Hastings," "brighter than at Santa
Clara." That last was believed at least
partly responsible for Stanford's informal
atmosphere people seem less worried
about understanding what's going on in
class, according to David Ifshin. Others put
the emphasis on "seem" and wondered if it
were really so. We told them to ask again
around exams.
Friendly, If Young
The age differential was corroborated
by students from Hastings and Santa Clara.
Sharon Wagner, from Hastings, said, "We
had people from 22 to 57 in our class, and
every age in between."
High tuition may be a factor, they
thought: people who are older may be
reluctant to fall back on their parents again
and so go to a less expensive school like
Hastings or-Boalt.
Are we friendly? Yes individually,
they thought, but the lack of a lounge or
other planned activities made it hard.
One said, "I had a simple question
about an assignment last night, but I
couldn't think of anyone I could call. I
didn't have any phone numbers and knew
very few names." But most were optimistic
that would change when things got
underway and the law lounge opened.
As for the universal bugaboo hours
for the new building this group seems no
different than anyone else: resentful. While
most confessed that they would not often
use the library past midnight, it was the
thought that it was unavailable in a crisis
that counted.
Chuck Theisen said that students at
the University of Arizona were given keys
to the library if they needed to be there
after midnight. The University of
Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt do the same,
according to George Lee and Wanda
McNeil.
Others were not so upset about library
hours as the fact that class and seminar

rooms would be unavilable for evening
study. Some just need a quiet place to
work alone, they said, although all agreed
with Sharon Wagner that the new library is
"a great place to study."
Comity
Reasons for transfering here were as
varied as the group itself some because a
spouse took a new job, some because it was
a chance to go to a better school, and at
least one because "I just wanted to be in
California."
According to Dean Keogh,
non-matriculating students are admitted
for "compelling personal reasons and
institutional comity both."
As for transfer students, they are
admitted as space is available, although
transfers this year slightly outnumber those
who left the present second year class. (Six
will not return and six are on leave for the
year.)
The discrepancy, says the Dean, is
"because we have the facilities and faculty
to handle a few more. It is a very slight
increase [in the first and second year
classes both]. It is not of a size that we go
around saying we are getting that much
bigger."
The application process is essentially the
same for transfers as for first year
applicants, only a little harder, says Keogh.
The most basic difference is that it is a
two-step process the applicant must be
invited to submit an application. Here's
how it works:
The Law School received some two
hundred letters of inquiry last year about
transfers. The number is slowly increasing,
"We tell them what the situation is like,"
says Keogh. "Then we invite a preliminary
letter, and if it has enough information, we
screen on the basis of that. We only invite
transcripts from those we think so far as
we can tell will be competitive."
Credit Confusion
This year that group totalled sixty-five,
from which nine were admitted.
Are there problems transfering credits?
"They seldom occur. Sometimes they have
to take first year courses. Most typically it
has to do with constitutional law or some
aspect of the writing program."
One aspect of credit transfer has the
students baffled: their previous credits
don't officially "vest," as one put it, until
they have completed a year at Stanford.
Several said they had inquired as to credit
problems but "couldn't get a straight
answer" and were told to wait until the
end of the year.
"What do I do if there's a problem
then?" asked one. "It'll be a little late." No
one seemed to know.
If there's one problem facing all the
transfers, it's that no one seems to know
or, if they do, they haven't bothered to
tell. All seem glad to be here, optimistic
about the year ahead, but forced to go it on
their own. It wouldn't take much to give
them a little help.
Some things get lost in the shuffle, and
this year's transfer students may be the
prime example. They total fourteen, nine
of them actual transfers into the second
year class, and five non-matriculating
students students who will finish at
Stanford but receive their degrees
elsewhere.
A recent Journal interview with nine of
these students revealed that literally
nothing special had been done for them,
and in fact they had, on occasion, been
denied the equal protection of Stanford's
administrative law.
According to George Lee, a
non-matriculating student from the
University of Pennsylvania: "We were told
to register like everyone else, and I stood in
line like everyone else for an hour. When I
finally reached the desk, I was told we
were supposed to register somewhere else."
That "somewhere else" was the old
Union, according to another "non-matric"
who waited two hours only to find she was
unknown over there. Apparently the law
school had neglected to tell them she was
coming.
Last Priority
Mistakes will be made, of course,
particularly in the confusion of a new
building with new procedures. But one
policy that is no mistake and
understandably troublesome to the
non-matriculating student is that of "last
priority" for writing courses. The policy,
according to Michelle Rubin, "is the same
at all the schools in the area. They say
since they're not giving us the degree, they
want to give their own students first
priority."
While most felt that it made some sense,
it did raise problems for students like
Wanda McNeil, who needed a professional
responsibility course to graduate and had
to make her own arrangements for directed
research.
Registration hassles were not reserved
for the non-matriculating students alone.
Some transfers had no permits to register, a
fact they learned only after they, too, had
stood in line for an hour.
And while they did have mailboxes and
lockers, unlike the non-matrics, you may

find the alphabetizing somewhat odd. They
are not where they're supposed to be.
Even worse, the non-matrics' name
strips on the mailboxes are done in black.

wrong idea from the discussion," Michelle
Rubin said afterward. "I'm really very
happy to be here."
Others had positive things to say as well.
They found the professors quite accessible
and impressive, "although there seem to be
an awful lot of visiting professors," said
one.
The group differed in assessing
Stanford's famous "non-Socratic"
technique. Some felt it made for more
discussion and less tension, some not.
Wanda McNeil, from Vanderbilt, noted
that "no matter what else you may think
of it, it does act as a leveller. Everybody is
forced to get it. As far as creating

friendship among a class of people, it's
effective; as a teaching tool, it's not so
great."
But David Andrews, from Duke,
thought the Socratic method made the
atmosphere there much more competitive,
if less boring: "Professors here start their
planned lecture and go through it. It gets a
little slow."
Richard Trutanic, from Hastings,
disagreed: "We had to have written briefs
for some of our classes and be ready to
stand up and read them. Some seemed to
go on forever."
Trutanic, found a major difference in
orientation between the two schools: "The
whole curriculum is much more bar
oriented at Hastings. The emphasis is on
learning the law of the case, and required
courses continue into the second year with
Evidence, Corporations, and Conflicts."
As for the students here, they are
"friendlier than in Albany," "younger than
at Hastings," "brighter than at Santa
Clara." That last was believed at least
partly responsible for Stanford's informal
atmosphere people seem less worried
about understanding what's going on in
class, according to David Ifshin. Others put
the emphasis on "seem" and wondered if it
were really so. We told them to ask again
around exams.
Friendly, If Young
The age differential was corroborated
by students from Hastings and Santa Clara.
Sharon Wagner, from Hastings, said, "We
had people from 22 to 57 in our class, and
every age in between."
High tuition may be a factor, they
thought: people who are older may be
reluctant to fall back on their parents again
and so go to a less expensive school like
Hastings or-Boalt.
Are we friendly? Yes individually,
they thought, but the lack of a lounge or
other planned activities made it hard.
One said, "I had a simple question
about an assignment last night, but I
couldn't think of anyone I could call. I
didn't have any phone numbers and knew
very few names." But most were optimistic
that would change when things got
underway and the law lounge opened.
As for the universal bugaboo hours
for the new building this group seems no
different than anyone else: resentful. While
most confessed that they would not often
use the library past midnight, it was the
thought that it was unavailable in a crisis
that counted.
Chuck Theisen said that students at
the University of Arizona were given keys
to the library if they needed to be there
after midnight. The University of
Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt do the same,
according to George Lee and Wanda
McNeil.
Others were not so upset about library
hours as the fact that class and seminar

rooms would be unavilable for evening
study. Some just need a quiet place to
work alone, they said, although all agreed
with Sharon Wagner that the new library is
"a great place to study."
Comity
Reasons for transfering here were as
varied as the group itself some because a
spouse took a new job, some because it was
a chance to go to a better school, and at
least one because "I just wanted to be in
California."
According to Dean Keogh,
non-matriculating students are admitted
for "compelling personal reasons and
institutional comity both."
As for transfer students, they are
admitted as space is available, although
transfers this year slightly outnumber those
who left the present second year class. (Six
will not return and six are on leave for the
year.)
The discrepancy, says the Dean, is
"because we have the facilities and faculty
to handle a few more. It is a very slight
increase [in the first and second year
classes both]. It is not of a size that we go
around saying we are getting that much
bigger."
The application process is essentially the
same for transfers as for first year
applicants, only a little harder, says Keogh.
The most basic difference is that it is a
two-step process the applicant must be
invited to submit an application. Here's
how it works:
The Law School received some two
hundred letters of inquiry last year about
transfers. The number is slowly increasing,
"We tell them what the situation is like,"
says Keogh. "Then we invite a preliminary
letter, and if it has enough information, we
screen on the basis of that. We only invite
transcripts from those we think so far as
we can tell will be competitive."
Credit Confusion
This year that group totalled sixty-five,
from which nine were admitted.
Are there problems transfering credits?
"They seldom occur. Sometimes they have
to take first year courses. Most typically it
has to do with constitutional law or some
aspect of the writing program."
One aspect of credit transfer has the
students baffled: their previous credits
don't officially "vest," as one put it, until
they have completed a year at Stanford.
Several said they had inquired as to credit
problems but "couldn't get a straight
answer" and were told to wait until the
end of the year.
"What do I do if there's a problem
then?" asked one. "It'll be a little late." No
one seemed to know.
If there's one problem facing all the
transfers, it's that no one seems to know
or, if they do, they haven't bothered to
tell. All seem glad to be here, optimistic
about the year ahead, but forced to go it on
their own. It wouldn't take much to give
them a little help.
Some things get lost in the shuffle, and
this year's transfer students may be the
prime example. They total fourteen, nine
of them actual transfers into the second
year class, and five non-matriculating
students students who will finish at
Stanford but receive their degrees
elsewhere.
A recent Journal interview with nine of
these students revealed that literally
nothing special had been done for them,
and in fact they had, on occasion, been
denied the equal protection of Stanford's
administrative law.
According to George Lee, a
non-matriculating student from the
University of Pennsylvania: "We were told
to register like everyone else, and I stood in
line like everyone else for an hour. When I
finally reached the desk, I was told we
were supposed to register somewhere else."
That "somewhere else" was the old
Union, according to another "non-matric"
who waited two hours only to find she was
unknown over there. Apparently the law
school had neglected to tell them she was
coming.
Last Priority
Mistakes will be made, of course,
particularly in the confusion of a new
building with new procedures. But one
policy that is no mistake and
understandably troublesome to the
non-matriculating student is that of "last
priority" for writing courses. The policy,
according to Michelle Rubin, "is the same
at all the schools in the area. They say
since they're not giving us the degree, they
want to give their own students first
priority."
While most felt that it made some sense,
it did raise problems for students like
Wanda McNeil, who needed a professional
responsibility course to graduate and had
to make her own arrangements for directed
research.
Registration hassles were not reserved
for the non-matriculating students alone.
Some transfers had no permits to register, a
fact they learned only after they, too, had
stood in line for an hour.
And while they did have mailboxes and
lockers, unlike the non-matrics, you may

find the alphabetizing somewhat odd. They
are not where they're supposed to be.
Even worse, the non-matrics' name
strips on the mailboxes are done in black.
The overwhelming consensus was that
the major problem was not registration
after all, every one of us is a veteran of that
sort of thing but a general vacuum of
information about what to expect.
Thud!
Dean Keogh confirmed that "nothing
special is done for the transfers. They are
simply dropped into the rest of the student
body as full-fledged Stanford students."
Similarly Emalie Ortega noted that the
Law Association made no social provisions
for transfers. In fact, they were not
included in the Association's one mailing
over the summer.
Unfortunately, many seem to have
landed with a thud and are only just now
getting their bearings. David Andrews
pulled up in his U-Haul with a badly
infected arm and was told he must spend
four days in the hospital, which he did, but
with virtually no knowledge of medical
programs available at the University.
George Lee is commuting from San
Francisco because he is unable to find a
place to live. Others are wondering what all
this business of "Celebration" is about or
how other students knew the assignments
before the first day of class.
And all thought a library tour would be
a great idea. Allan Salzman, a transfer from
the University of Toronto, took the
initiative to sit in on a legal bibliography
class to familiarize himself with American
reporting systems, but others were not sure
that would help (nor was Allan).
They all agreed, however, that they
would like to be informed of orientation
activities, to be able to decide whether to
attend or not.
It became increasingly clear as we talked
that the introductory function was terribly
important, that an attempt was made to fill
it for others who were new, but that these
people just fell between the cracks. (That
the performance of this function was left
to the Law Journal is nothing short of
scandalous.)

had people from 22 to 57 in our class, and
every age in between."
High tuition may be a factor, they
thought: people who are older may be
reluctant to fall back on their parents again
and so go to a less expensive school like
Hastings or-Boalt.
Are we friendly? Yes individually,
they thought, but the lack of a lounge or
other planned activities made it hard.
One said, "I had a simple question
about an assignment last night, but I
couldn't think of anyone I could call. I
didn't have any phone numbers and knew
very few names." But most were optimistic
that would change when things got
underway and the law lounge opened.
As for the universal bugaboo hours
for the new building this group seems no
different than anyone else: resentful. While
most confessed that they would not often
use the library past midnight, it was the
thought that it was unavailable in a crisis
that counted.
Chuck Theisen said that students at
the University of Arizona were given keys
to the library if they needed to be there
after midnight. The University of
Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt do the same,
according to George Lee and Wanda
McNeil.
Others were not so upset about library
hours as the fact that class and seminar

rooms would be unavilable for evening
study. Some just need a quiet place to
work alone, they said, although all agreed
with Sharon Wagner that the new library is
"a great place to study."
Comity
Reasons for transfering here were as
varied as the group itself some because a
spouse took a new job, some because it was
a chance to go to a better school, and at
least one because "I just wanted to be in
California."
According to Dean Keogh,
non-matriculating students are admitted
for "compelling personal reasons and
institutional comity both."
As for transfer students, they are
admitted as space is available, although
transfers this year slightly outnumber those
who left the present second year class. (Six
will not return and six are on leave for the
year.)
The discrepancy, says the Dean, is
"because we have the facilities and faculty
to handle a few more. It is a very slight
increase [in the first and second year
classes both]. It is not of a size that we go
around saying we are getting that much
bigger."
The application process is essentially the
same for transfers as for first year
applicants, only a little harder, says Keogh.
The most basic difference is that it is a
two-step process the applicant must be
invited to submit an application. Here's
how it works:
The Law School received some two
hundred letters of inquiry last year about
transfers. The number is slowly increasing,
"We tell them what the situation is like,"
says Keogh. "Then we invite a preliminary
letter, and if it has enough information, we
screen on the basis of that. We only invite
transcripts from those we think so far as
we can tell will be competitive."
Credit Confusion
This year that group totalled sixty-five,
from which nine were admitted.
Are there problems transfering credits?
"They seldom occur. Sometimes they have
to take first year courses. Most typically it
has to do with constitutional law or some
aspect of the writing program."
One aspect of credit transfer has the
students baffled: their previous credits
don't officially "vest," as one put it, until
they have completed a year at Stanford.
Several said they had inquired as to credit
problems but "couldn't get a straight
answer" and were told to wait until the
end of the year.
"What do I do if there's a problem
then?" asked one. "It'll be a little late." No
one seemed to know.
If there's one problem facing all the
transfers, it's that no one seems to know
or, if they do, they haven't bothered to
tell. All seem glad to be here, optimistic
about the year ahead, but forced to go it on
their own. It wouldn't take much to give
them a little help.
Some things get lost in the shuffle, and
this year's transfer students may be the
prime example. They total fourteen, nine
of them actual transfers into the second
year class, and five non-matriculating
students students who will finish at
Stanford but receive their degrees
elsewhere.
A recent Journal interview with nine of
these students revealed that literally
nothing special had been done for them,
and in fact they had, on occasion, been
denied the equal protection of Stanford's
administrative law.
According to George Lee, a
non-matriculating student from the
University of Pennsylvania: "We were told
to register like everyone else, and I stood in
line like everyone else for an hour. When I
finally reached the desk, I was told we
were supposed to register somewhere else."
That "somewhere else" was the old
Union, according to another "non-matric"
who waited two hours only to find she was
unknown over there. Apparently the law
school had neglected to tell them she was
coming.
Last Priority
Mistakes will be made, of course,
particularly in the confusion of a new
building with new procedures. But one
policy that is no mistake and
understandably troublesome to the
non-matriculating student is that of "last
priority" for writing courses. The policy,
according to Michelle Rubin, "is the same
at all the schools in the area. They say
since they're not giving us the degree, they
want to give their own students first
priority."
While most felt that it made some sense,
it did raise problems for students like
Wanda McNeil, who needed a professional
responsibility course to graduate and had
to make her own arrangements for directed
research.
Registration hassles were not reserved
for the non-matriculating students alone.
Some transfers had no permits to register, a
fact they learned only after they, too, had
stood in line for an hour.
And while they did have mailboxes and
lockers, unlike the non-matrics, you may

find the alphabetizing somewhat odd. They
are not where they're supposed to be.
Even worse, the non-matrics' name
strips on the mailboxes are done in black.
The overwhelming consensus was that
the major problem was not registration
after all, every one of us is a veteran of that
sort of thing but a general vacuum of
information about what to expect.
Thud!
Dean Keogh confirmed that "nothing
special is done for the transfers. They are
simply dropped into the rest of the student
body as full-fledged Stanford students."
Similarly Emalie Ortega noted that the
Law Association made no social provisions
for transfers. In fact, they were not
included in the Association's one mailing
over the summer.
Unfortunately, many seem to have
landed with a thud and are only just now
getting their bearings. David Andrews
pulled up in his U-Haul with a badly
infected arm and was told he must spend
four days in the hospital, which he did, but
with virtually no knowledge of medical
programs available at the University.
George Lee is commuting from San
Francisco because he is unable to find a
place to live. Others are wondering what all
this business of "Celebration" is about or
how other students knew the assignments
before the first day of class.
And all thought a library tour would be
a great idea. Allan Salzman, a transfer from
the University of Toronto, took the
initiative to sit in on a legal bibliography
class to familiarize himself with American
reporting systems, but others were not sure
that would help (nor was Allan).
They all agreed, however, that they
would like to be informed of orientation
activities, to be able to decide whether to
attend or not.
It became increasingly clear as we talked
that the introductory function was terribly
important, that an attempt was made to fill
it for others who were new, but that these
people just fell between the cracks. (That
the performance of this function was left
to the Law Journal is nothing short of
scandalous.)
Happy Here
The new students were by no means all
sour grapes. "I hope you didn't get the
wrong idea from the discussion," Michelle
Rubin said afterward. "I'm really very
happy to be here."
Others had positive things to say as well.
They found the professors quite accessible
and impressive, "although there seem to be
an awful lot of visiting professors," said
one.
The group differed in assessing
Stanford's famous "non-Socratic"
technique. Some felt it made for more
discussion and less tension, some not.
Wanda McNeil, from Vanderbilt, noted
that "no matter what else you may think
of it, it does act as a leveller. Everybody is
forced to get it. As far as creating

friendship among a class of people, it's
effective; as a teaching tool, it's not so
great."
But David Andrews, from Duke,
thought the Socratic method made the
atmosphere there much more competitive,
if less boring: "Professors here start their
planned lecture and go through it. It gets a
little slow."
Richard Trutanic, from Hastings,
disagreed: "We had to have written briefs
for some of our classes and be ready to
stand up and read them. Some seemed to
go on forever."
Trutanic, found a major difference in
orientation between the two schools: "The
whole curriculum is much more bar
oriented at Hastings. The emphasis is on
learning the law of the case, and required
courses continue into the second year with
Evidence, Corporations, and Conflicts."
As for the students here, they are
"friendlier than in Albany," "younger than
at Hastings," "brighter than at Santa
Clara." That last was believed at least
partly responsible for Stanford's informal
atmosphere people seem less worried
about understanding what's going on in
class, according to David Ifshin. Others put
the emphasis on "seem" and wondered if it
were really so. We told them to ask again
around exams.
Friendly, If Young
The age differential was corroborated
by students from Hastings and Santa Clara.
Sharon Wagner, from Hastings, said, "We
had people from 22 to 57 in our class, and
every age in between."

thought: people who are older may be

year.)
The discrepancy, says the Dean, is
"because we have the facilities and faculty
to handle a few more. It is a very slight
increase [in the first and second year
classes both]. It is not of a size that we go
around saying we are getting that much
bigger."
The application process is essentially the
same for transfers as for first year
applicants, only a little harder, says Keogh.
The most basic difference is that it is a
two-step process the applicant must be
invited to submit an application. Here's
how it works:
The Law School received some two
hundred letters of inquiry last year about
transfers. The number is slowly increasing,
"We tell them what the situation is like,"
says Keogh. "Then we invite a preliminary
letter, and if it has enough information, we
screen on the basis of that. We only invite
transcripts from those we think so far as
we can tell will be competitive."
Credit Confusion
This year that group totalled sixty-five,
from which nine were admitted.
Are there problems transfering credits?
"They seldom occur. Sometimes they have
to take first year courses. Most typically it
has to do with constitutional law or some
aspect of the writing program."
One aspect of credit transfer has the
students baffled: their previous credits
don't officially "vest," as one put it, until
they have completed a year at Stanford.
Several said they had inquired as to credit
problems but "couldn't get a straight
answer" and were told to wait until the
end of the year.
"What do I do if there's a problem
then?" asked one. "It'll be a little late." No
one seemed to know.
If there's one problem facing all the
transfers, it's that no one seems to know
or, if they do, they haven't bothered to
tell. All seem glad to be here, optimistic
about the year ahead, but forced to go it on
their own. It wouldn't take much to give
them a little help.
Some things get lost in the shuffle, and
this year's transfer students may be the
prime example. They total fourteen, nine
of them actual transfers into the second
year class, and five non-matriculating
students students who will finish at
Stanford but receive their degrees
elsewhere.
A recent Journal interview with nine of
these students revealed that literally
nothing special had been done for them,
and in fact they had, on occasion, been
denied the equal protection of Stanford's
administrative law.
According to George Lee, a
non-matriculating student from the
University of Pennsylvania: "We were told
to register like everyone else, and I stood in
line like everyone else for an hour. When I
finally reached the desk, I was told we
were supposed to register somewhere else."
That "somewhere else" was the old
Union, according to another "non-matric"
who waited two hours only to find she was
unknown over there. Apparently the law
school had neglected to tell them she was
coming.
Last Priority
Mistakes will be made, of course,
particularly in the confusion of a new
building with new procedures. But one
policy that is no mistake and
understandably troublesome to the
non-matriculating student is that of "last
priority" for writing courses. The policy,
according to Michelle Rubin, "is the same
at all the schools in the area. They say
since they're not giving us the degree, they
want to give their own students first
priority."
While most felt that it made some sense,
it did raise problems for students like
Wanda McNeil, who needed a professional
responsibility course to graduate and had
to make her own arrangements for directed
research.
Registration hassles were not reserved
for the non-matriculating students alone.
Some transfers had no permits to register, a
fact they learned only after they, too, had
stood in line for an hour.
And while they did have mailboxes and
lockers, unlike the non-matrics, you may

find the alphabetizing somewhat odd. They
are not where they're supposed to be.
Even worse, the non-matrics' name
strips on the mailboxes are done in black.
The overwhelming consensus was that
the major problem was not registration
after all, every one of us is a veteran of that
sort of thing but a general vacuum of
information about what to expect.
Thud!
Dean Keogh confirmed that "nothing
special is done for the transfers. They are
simply dropped into the rest of the student
body as full-fledged Stanford students."
Similarly Emalie Ortega noted that the
Law Association made no social provisions
for transfers. In fact, they were not
included in the Association's one mailing
over the summer.
Unfortunately, many seem to have
landed with a thud and are only just now
getting their bearings. David Andrews
pulled up in his U-Haul with a badly
infected arm and was told he must spend
four days in the hospital, which he did, but
with virtually no knowledge of medical
programs available at the University.
George Lee is commuting from San
Francisco because he is unable to find a
place to live. Others are wondering what all
this business of "Celebration" is about or
how other students knew the assignments
before the first day of class.
And all thought a library tour would be
a great idea. Allan Salzman, a transfer from
the University of Toronto, took the
initiative to sit in on a legal bibliography
class to familiarize himself with American
reporting systems, but others were not sure
that would help (nor was Allan).
They all agreed, however, that they
would like to be informed of orientation
activities, to be able to decide whether to
attend or not.
It became increasingly clear as we talked
that the introductory function was terribly
important, that an attempt was made to fill
it for others who were new, but that these
people just fell between the cracks. (That
the performance of this function was left
to the Law Journal is nothing short of
scandalous.)
Happy Here
The new students were by no means all
sour grapes. "I hope you didn't get the
wrong idea from the discussion," Michelle
Rubin said afterward. "I'm really very
happy to be here."
Others had positive things to say as well.
They found the professors quite accessible
and impressive, "although there seem to be
an awful lot of visiting professors," said
one.
The group differed in assessing
Stanford's famous "non-Socratic"
technique. Some felt it made for more
discussion and less tension, some not.
Wanda McNeil, from Vanderbilt, noted
that "no matter what else you may think
of it, it does act as a leveller. Everybody is
forced to get it. As far as creating

friendship among a class of people, it's
effective; as a teaching tool, it's not so
great."
But David Andrews, from Duke,
thought the Socratic method made the
atmosphere there much more competitive,
if less boring: "Professors here start their
planned lecture and go through it. It gets a
little slow."
Richard Trutanic, from Hastings,
disagreed: "We had to have written briefs
for some of our classes and be ready to
stand up and read them. Some seemed to
go on forever."
Trutanic, found a major difference in
orientation between the two schools: "The
whole curriculum is much more bar
oriented at Hastings. The emphasis is on
learning the law of the case, and required
courses continue into the second year with
Evidence, Corporations, and Conflicts."
As for the students here, they are
"friendlier than in Albany," "younger than
at Hastings," "brighter than at Santa
Clara." That last was believed at least
partly responsible for Stanford's informal
atmosphere people seem less worried
about understanding what's going on in
class, according to David Ifshin. Others put
the emphasis on "seem" and wondered if it
were really so. We told them to ask again
around exams.
Friendly, If Young
The age differential was corroborated
by students from Hastings and Santa Clara.
Sharon Wagner, from Hastings, said, "We
had people from 22 to 57 in our class, and
every age in between."
High tuition may be a factor, they
thought: people who are older may be
reluctant to fall back on their parents again
and so go to a less expensive school like
Hastings or-Boalt.
Are we friendly? Yes individually,
they thought, but the lack of a lounge or
other planned activities made it hard.
One said, "I had a simple question
about an assignment last night, but I
couldn't think of anyone I could call. I
didn't have any phone numbers and knew
very few names." But most were optimistic
that would change when things got
underway and the law lounge opened.
As for the universal bugaboo hours
for the new building this group seems no
different than anyone else: resentful. While
most confessed that they would not often
use the library past midnight, it was the
thought that it was unavailable in a crisis
that counted.
Chuck Theisen said that students at
the University of Arizona were given keys
to the library if they needed to be there
after midnight. The University of
Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt do the same,
according to George Lee and Wanda
McNeil.
Others were not so upset about library
hours as the fact that class and seminar

rooms would be unavilable for evening
study. Some just need a quiet place to
work alone, they said, although all agreed
with Sharon Wagner that the new library is
"a great place to study."
Comity
Reasons for transfering here were as
varied as the group itself some because a
spouse took a new job, some because it was
a chance to go to a better school, and at
least one because "I just wanted to be in
California."
According to Dean Keogh,
non-matriculating students are admitted
for "compelling personal reasons and
institutional comity both."
As for transfer students, they are
admitted as space is available, although
transfers this year slightly outnumber those
who left the present second year class. (Six
will not return and six are on leave for the
year.)
The discrepancy, says the Dean, is
"because we have the facilities and faculty
to handle a few more. It is a very slight
increase [in the first and second year
classes both]. It is not of a size that we go
around saying we are getting that much
bigger."
The application process is essentially the
same for transfers as for first year
applicants, only a little harder, says Keogh.
