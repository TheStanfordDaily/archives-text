### Placement Committee 
The Placement Office, ensconced in
their new first floor offices on the east side
of Crown Library, has been busy over the
summer communicating with prospective
employers, readying the interviewing
rooms and trying to streamline the
placement operation.
Annually, representatives from over 250
law firms, government agencies,
corporations, legal aid offices and public
interest organizations come on campus to
interview first and second year students for
summer employment and third year
students for permanent positions.
Most of the on-campus interviewing
takes place during the months of October,
November and December; this year the
"interviewing season" begins on Monday,
October 6.
Placement Committee
This fall, the placement office is
fortunate in having an active student

placement committee appointed by the Law
association. The purpose of this committee
is to act as a liaison between the students
and the placement office and to assist in
developing programs and co-ordinating
activities for the students.
The members of this committee are Jim
Andrews, Willie Bogan, Nancy Griffin, Lela
Harris, Jonathan Kempner, Janet
Montgomery, Sally O'Dowd, Kerry
Stoebner and Gerry Whitt. They invite
your comments and suggestions concerning
the placement operation.
It is hoped that the students will think
of the committee as their representatives
and act accordingly.
'Strategy'
The Placement Committee will sponser
a "strategy session" for second and third
year students on Tuesday, September 30
for the purpose of sharing students'
accumulated and sometimes painfully won
wisdom of the job finding process.
The committee is also planning a series
of meetings to familiarize interested

students with certain cities in which
Stanford law students commonly find
permanent or summer jobs. These meetings
will cover San Francisco, Los Angeles, New
York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago,
Denver and Seattle/Portland.
First-year Placement
In late October the Placement office
will hold a special meeting for first year
students. While fewer law-related jobs are
available for first year students than for
upperclass men and women, the Placement
Office hopes to play a more active role in
helping first year students identify those
jobs such as work for professors or
volunteer positions with public interest
groups.
The career search process can be
overwhelming, thus the Placement Office
stands ready to assist you in preparing your
resume, identifying career goals and
appropriate job search patterns,
interviewing techniques and locating useful
information sources.

Stoebner and Gerry Whitt. They invite
your comments and suggestions concerning
the placement operation.
It is hoped that the students will think
of the committee as their representatives
and act accordingly.
'Strategy'
The Placement Committee will sponser
a "strategy session" for second and third
year students on Tuesday, September 30
for the purpose of sharing students'
accumulated and sometimes painfully won
wisdom of the job finding process.
The committee is also planning a series
of meetings to familiarize interested

students with certain cities in which
Stanford law students commonly find
permanent or summer jobs. These meetings
will cover San Francisco, Los Angeles, New
York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago,
Denver and Seattle/Portland.
First-year Placement
In late October the Placement office
will hold a special meeting for first year
students. While fewer law-related jobs are
available for first year students than for
upperclass men and women, the Placement
Office hopes to play a more active role in
helping first year students identify those
jobs such as work for professors or
volunteer positions with public interest
groups.
The career search process can be
overwhelming, thus the Placement Office
stands ready to assist you in preparing your
resume, identifying career goals and
appropriate job search patterns,
interviewing techniques and locating useful
information sources.
