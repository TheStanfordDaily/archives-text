## The 						New Buildings and Beyond 
### 
The planning and construction of the
new law school have taken over a decade.
Those efforts culminate with this
weekend's Celebration.
As Dean Thomas Ehrlich noted,
Stanford Law School finally has a physical
plant to match the quality of its faculty
and students, and, we should add, its
alumni, staff, and administration. There is
much to celebrate.
But, to paraphrase the Bicentennial
theme to which this Celebration is partially
devoted, we must not simply honor past
accomplishments; there is much yet to be
done.
Fortunately, the new law school
provides an atmosphere conducive to the
work ahead of maintaining and enhancing
the Law School's dedication to the highest
quality legal education.
The classrooms are now of sufficient
size, number and appointment to permit a
most diverse, flexible and comfortable legal
education. And the library and faculty
offices are large enough to accommodate
the needs of students and faculty.
However, the new building and the
increase of fifty in the size of the student
body over the next three years impose two
special responsibilities:
—The Law School has achieved a high
degree of educational quality,
characterized by an open and informal
atmosphere which has been most
conducive to learning and teaching; that
quality must not be stretched too thin or
bent out of shape to fill the expanded
facilities.
—For the past several years, efforts to
enhance educational quality have
concentrated on constructing these
buildings. It is time now to turn to the
other, more subjective and perhaps more
difficult, if no less important, problems of
the school which could not receive the
attention they deserved during that
construction.
Toward the accomplishment of these
goals and in the spirit of this weekend's
dedication, we suggest several areas of
concern to which Stanford students,
faculty, administration, staff, and alumni
must now direct their energies.
FACULTY-STUDENT CONTACT
Stanford's major accomplishment has
been the maintenance of a high degree of
academic achievement in an informal
atmosphere of interaction and association
between students and faculty; as much can
be learned by students from faculty (and
vice versa) outside of the classroom as in it.
The new physical design of the Law
School attempts to encourage interaction.
Despite its benefits, a larger building,
especially one segmented into library,
classroom and faculty areas, fosters an
unconscious sense of isolation and
separation.
Primarily, security measures such as
closing off faculty areas at 6:30 p.m.
should be changed to emphasize free
faculty-student access while members of
both groups are in the building,even if this
would result in some property loss.
While everyone agrees that people
should come first at Stanford Law School,
those people who have encountered locked

doors intended to protect offices and
artwork may get a different sense of those
priorities.
Artwork, of course, is a welcome
addition to the facilities, but this is a law
school after all, not a museum.
As important as the physical attributes
of the building are the attitudes of its
occupants.
Therefore, faculty members are
encouraged to break up those potentially
forbidding corridors by keeping their doors
open as often as possible. And students are
especially encouraged to walk through the
open doors; and to keep a foot in the
closed ones.
STUDENT-STUDENT CONTACT
In addition to free access of students to
faculty (and vice versa), the old building
and the old student body size caused a
high degree of student interaction at all
times of the day.
The design of the new library while
spacious, conspires against such
interaction. When the lounge is closed, few
places exist where groups of students may
chat informally or study together without
disturbing others around them. Some or all
classrooms should remain open at night to
alleviate this problem.
Moreover, some student organizations
are threatened with financial problems
because of the loss of summer revenue
from the lounge, upon which the groups
depend for funds.
Perhaps a student organization
endowment fund should be established to
replace the faculty support of these
organizations which was removed a few
years back.
THE LIBRARY
Now that the library has expanded
quarters, it is time to expand its collection.
While library officials rightly stress quality
over quantity, they are the first to admit
that the collection is still insufficient to
meet the total research needs of its
students and faculty.
The present acquisition pace adds only a
relatively few volumes a year beyond
updating existing sets. Surely the millions
of dollars that went into building the
facility should not be wasted because of a
lack of the other necessary tools of legal
scholarship.
FACULTY HIRING
Beyond the problems of adapting the
new facilities to the Law School's
educational needs, are the more difficult,
ongoing problems of maintaining the most
diverse and exciting faculty and study
body possible.
For the past several years, Stanford Law
School has relied heavily upon large
numbers of visiting faculty members to
meet its teaching responsibilities 11 tin.,
year compard to a permanent faculty of
39, of whom several are on leave.
While this exposes students and faculty
to a greater diversity of academic contact
than a small faculty can otherwise provide,
it has drawbacks:
—Having no permanent faculty member
in such important areas as Corporations,
deters continuity. For example,
student-faculty projects in those fields are
limited to nine months, or less.

—Some faculty members this year must
teach the same class twice to first year
students.
' —Ongoing student-faculty ties which
first-year small sections are designed to
encourage can only continue for a year
when visiting professors teach these classes.
Ideally, the permanent faculty should
cover all major areas of jurisprudence, with
a visiting program to augment it and
replace its members on leave.
ADMISSIONS
The student body expansion should be
accompanied by a continued, even
increased, commitment to represent as
many facets of American culture as
possible. That minority enrollment has
decreased for the past two years, for
example, is suggestive of improvements yet
to be made; women and older people also
seem underrepresented.
Efforts should continue to attract to
Stanford members of these and other
groups who could add to the diversity of
interests and viewpoints that contribute to
an exciting and fulfilling legal education.
The scholarship fund of the Law School
could be increased to enhance the
possibility of achieving a diverse student
body.
THE FIRST-YEAR PROGRAM
The Law School's first-year program
must live up to the goal of establishing a
firm legal base. For example, the writing
program should be designed to assure that
students receive the attention they find
necessary to carry out this important
aspect of the first-year process attention
which has been lacking in many instances
in the past.
In addition other noticeable trends in

this year's first-year program suggest areas
of concern.
For instance, the large number of small
sections in those courses with the least
amount of class time and units is an
unfortunate trend toward reducing the
time during which students are exposed to
the intensive learning process which only a
small class can offer.
Moreover, it is alarming to note that
small sections are increasing in size.
PLACEMENT
For second and third-year students,
emphasis switches from getting into and
through law school to what happens
thereafter.
Some students find the large firms and
government agencies which are available
for personal contact through the placement
office insufficient to meet their career
goals.
While the Placement Office attempts to
maintain contacts with other segments of
the legal profession, the emphasis remains
upon those offices which can pay their
own expenses to Palo Alto.
Perhaps Stanford should look into
proposals being utilized elsewhere for
helping to fund visits to the Law School by
members of other, less affluent branches of
the legal profession.
The importance of these problems
varies, though each has significant impact
upon the legal education available at
Stanford. And we do not mean to suggest
that these areas of concern are not already
the subjects of long and hard thought by
members of the Law School community.
'We only direct attention to these
problems because this is a time when we,
the members of that community, should
begin assessing, and considering ways to
shape, the future of Stanford Law School
on the occasion of the dedication of these
buildings which are an important and
permanent part of that future.

new law school have taken over a decade.

the members of that community, should
begin assessing, and considering ways to
shape, the future of Stanford Law School
on the occasion of the dedication of these
buildings which are an important and
permanent part of that future.
The planning and construction of the
new law school have taken over a decade.
Those efforts culminate with this
weekend's Celebration.
As Dean Thomas Ehrlich noted,
Stanford Law School finally has a physical
plant to match the quality of its faculty
and students, and, we should add, its
alumni, staff, and administration. There is
much to celebrate.
But, to paraphrase the Bicentennial
theme to which this Celebration is partially
devoted, we must not simply honor past
accomplishments; there is much yet to be
done.
Fortunately, the new law school
provides an atmosphere conducive to the
work ahead of maintaining and enhancing
the Law School's dedication to the highest
quality legal education.
The classrooms are now of sufficient
size, number and appointment to permit a
most diverse, flexible and comfortable legal
education. And the library and faculty
offices are large enough to accommodate
the needs of students and faculty.
However, the new building and the
increase of fifty in the size of the student
body over the next three years impose two
special responsibilities:
—The Law School has achieved a high
degree of educational quality,
characterized by an open and informal
atmosphere which has been most
conducive to learning and teaching; that
quality must not be stretched too thin or
bent out of shape to fill the expanded
facilities.
—For the past several years, efforts to
enhance educational quality have
concentrated on constructing these
buildings. It is time now to turn to the
other, more subjective and perhaps more
difficult, if no less important, problems of
the school which could not receive the
attention they deserved during that
construction.
Toward the accomplishment of these
goals and in the spirit of this weekend's
dedication, we suggest several areas of
concern to which Stanford students,
faculty, administration, staff, and alumni
must now direct their energies.
FACULTY-STUDENT CONTACT
Stanford's major accomplishment has
been the maintenance of a high degree of
academic achievement in an informal
atmosphere of interaction and association
between students and faculty; as much can
be learned by students from faculty (and
vice versa) outside of the classroom as in it.
The new physical design of the Law
School attempts to encourage interaction.
Despite its benefits, a larger building,
especially one segmented into library,
classroom and faculty areas, fosters an
unconscious sense of isolation and
separation.
Primarily, security measures such as
closing off faculty areas at 6:30 p.m.
should be changed to emphasize free
faculty-student access while members of
both groups are in the building,even if this
would result in some property loss.
While everyone agrees that people
should come first at Stanford Law School,
those people who have encountered locked

doors intended to protect offices and
artwork may get a different sense of those
priorities.
Artwork, of course, is a welcome
addition to the facilities, but this is a law
school after all, not a museum.
As important as the physical attributes
of the building are the attitudes of its
occupants.
Therefore, faculty members are
encouraged to break up those potentially
forbidding corridors by keeping their doors
open as often as possible. And students are
especially encouraged to walk through the
open doors; and to keep a foot in the
closed ones.
STUDENT-STUDENT CONTACT
In addition to free access of students to
faculty (and vice versa), the old building
and the old student body size caused a
high degree of student interaction at all
times of the day.
The design of the new library while
spacious, conspires against such
interaction. When the lounge is closed, few
places exist where groups of students may
chat informally or study together without
disturbing others around them. Some or all
classrooms should remain open at night to
alleviate this problem.
Moreover, some student organizations
are threatened with financial problems
because of the loss of summer revenue
from the lounge, upon which the groups
depend for funds.
Perhaps a student organization
endowment fund should be established to
replace the faculty support of these
organizations which was removed a few
years back.
THE LIBRARY
Now that the library has expanded
quarters, it is time to expand its collection.
While library officials rightly stress quality
over quantity, they are the first to admit
that the collection is still insufficient to
meet the total research needs of its
students and faculty.
The present acquisition pace adds only a
relatively few volumes a year beyond
updating existing sets. Surely the millions
of dollars that went into building the
facility should not be wasted because of a
lack of the other necessary tools of legal
scholarship.
FACULTY HIRING
Beyond the problems of adapting the
new facilities to the Law School's
educational needs, are the more difficult,
ongoing problems of maintaining the most
diverse and exciting faculty and study
body possible.
For the past several years, Stanford Law
School has relied heavily upon large
numbers of visiting faculty members to
meet its teaching responsibilities 11 tin.,
year compard to a permanent faculty of
39, of whom several are on leave.
While this exposes students and faculty
to a greater diversity of academic contact
than a small faculty can otherwise provide,
it has drawbacks:
—Having no permanent faculty member
in such important areas as Corporations,
deters continuity. For example,
student-faculty projects in those fields are
limited to nine months, or less.

—Some faculty members this year must
teach the same class twice to first year
students.
' —Ongoing student-faculty ties which
first-year small sections are designed to
encourage can only continue for a year
when visiting professors teach these classes.
Ideally, the permanent faculty should
cover all major areas of jurisprudence, with
a visiting program to augment it and
replace its members on leave.
ADMISSIONS
The student body expansion should be
accompanied by a continued, even
increased, commitment to represent as
many facets of American culture as
possible. That minority enrollment has
decreased for the past two years, for
example, is suggestive of improvements yet
to be made; women and older people also
seem underrepresented.
Efforts should continue to attract to
Stanford members of these and other
groups who could add to the diversity of
interests and viewpoints that contribute to
an exciting and fulfilling legal education.
The scholarship fund of the Law School
could be increased to enhance the
possibility of achieving a diverse student
body.
THE FIRST-YEAR PROGRAM
The Law School's first-year program
must live up to the goal of establishing a
firm legal base. For example, the writing
program should be designed to assure that
students receive the attention they find
necessary to carry out this important
aspect of the first-year process attention
which has been lacking in many instances
in the past.
In addition other noticeable trends in

this year's first-year program suggest areas
of concern.
For instance, the large number of small
sections in those courses with the least
amount of class time and units is an
unfortunate trend toward reducing the
time during which students are exposed to
the intensive learning process which only a
small class can offer.
Moreover, it is alarming to note that
small sections are increasing in size.
PLACEMENT
For second and third-year students,
emphasis switches from getting into and
through law school to what happens
thereafter.
Some students find the large firms and
government agencies which are available
for personal contact through the placement
office insufficient to meet their career
goals.
While the Placement Office attempts to
maintain contacts with other segments of
the legal profession, the emphasis remains
upon those offices which can pay their
own expenses to Palo Alto.
Perhaps Stanford should look into
proposals being utilized elsewhere for
helping to fund visits to the Law School by
members of other, less affluent branches of
the legal profession.
The importance of these problems
varies, though each has significant impact
upon the legal education available at
Stanford. And we do not mean to suggest
that these areas of concern are not already
the subjects of long and hard thought by
members of the Law School community.
'We only direct attention to these
problems because this is a time when we,
the members of that community, should
begin assessing, and considering ways to

Stanford. And we do not mean to suggest
that these areas of concern are not already
the subjects of long and hard thought by
members of the Law School community.
'We only direct attention to these
problems because this is a time when we,
the members of that community, should
begin assessing, and considering ways to
shape, the future of Stanford Law School
on the occasion of the dedication of these
buildings which are an important and
permanent part of that future.
The planning and construction of the
new law school have taken over a decade.
Those efforts culminate with this
weekend's Celebration.
As Dean Thomas Ehrlich noted,
Stanford Law School finally has a physical
plant to match the quality of its faculty
and students, and, we should add, its
alumni, staff, and administration. There is
much to celebrate.
But, to paraphrase the Bicentennial
theme to which this Celebration is partially
devoted, we must not simply honor past
accomplishments; there is much yet to be
done.
Fortunately, the new law school
provides an atmosphere conducive to the
work ahead of maintaining and enhancing
the Law School's dedication to the highest
quality legal education.
The classrooms are now of sufficient
size, number and appointment to permit a
most diverse, flexible and comfortable legal
education. And the library and faculty
offices are large enough to accommodate
the needs of students and faculty.
However, the new building and the
increase of fifty in the size of the student
body over the next three years impose two
special responsibilities:
—The Law School has achieved a high
degree of educational quality,
characterized by an open and informal
atmosphere which has been most
conducive to learning and teaching; that
quality must not be stretched too thin or
bent out of shape to fill the expanded
facilities.
—For the past several years, efforts to
enhance educational quality have
concentrated on constructing these
buildings. It is time now to turn to the
other, more subjective and perhaps more
difficult, if no less important, problems of
the school which could not receive the
attention they deserved during that
construction.
Toward the accomplishment of these
goals and in the spirit of this weekend's
dedication, we suggest several areas of
concern to which Stanford students,
faculty, administration, staff, and alumni
must now direct their energies.
FACULTY-STUDENT CONTACT
Stanford's major accomplishment has
been the maintenance of a high degree of
academic achievement in an informal
atmosphere of interaction and association
between students and faculty; as much can
be learned by students from faculty (and
vice versa) outside of the classroom as in it.
The new physical design of the Law
School attempts to encourage interaction.
Despite its benefits, a larger building,
especially one segmented into library,
classroom and faculty areas, fosters an
unconscious sense of isolation and
separation.
Primarily, security measures such as
closing off faculty areas at 6:30 p.m.
should be changed to emphasize free
faculty-student access while members of
both groups are in the building,even if this
would result in some property loss.
While everyone agrees that people
should come first at Stanford Law School,
those people who have encountered locked

doors intended to protect offices and
artwork may get a different sense of those
priorities.
Artwork, of course, is a welcome
addition to the facilities, but this is a law
school after all, not a museum.
As important as the physical attributes
of the building are the attitudes of its
occupants.
Therefore, faculty members are
encouraged to break up those potentially
forbidding corridors by keeping their doors
open as often as possible. And students are
especially encouraged to walk through the
open doors; and to keep a foot in the
closed ones.
STUDENT-STUDENT CONTACT
In addition to free access of students to
faculty (and vice versa), the old building
and the old student body size caused a
high degree of student interaction at all
times of the day.
The design of the new library while
spacious, conspires against such
interaction. When the lounge is closed, few
places exist where groups of students may
chat informally or study together without
disturbing others around them. Some or all
classrooms should remain open at night to
alleviate this problem.
Moreover, some student organizations
are threatened with financial problems
because of the loss of summer revenue
from the lounge, upon which the groups
depend for funds.
Perhaps a student organization
endowment fund should be established to
replace the faculty support of these
organizations which was removed a few
years back.
THE LIBRARY
Now that the library has expanded
quarters, it is time to expand its collection.
While library officials rightly stress quality
over quantity, they are the first to admit
that the collection is still insufficient to
meet the total research needs of its
students and faculty.
The present acquisition pace adds only a
relatively few volumes a year beyond
updating existing sets. Surely the millions
of dollars that went into building the
facility should not be wasted because of a
lack of the other necessary tools of legal
scholarship.
FACULTY HIRING
Beyond the problems of adapting the
new facilities to the Law School's
educational needs, are the more difficult,
ongoing problems of maintaining the most
diverse and exciting faculty and study
body possible.
For the past several years, Stanford Law
School has relied heavily upon large
numbers of visiting faculty members to
meet its teaching responsibilities 11 tin.,
year compard to a permanent faculty of
39, of whom several are on leave.
While this exposes students and faculty
to a greater diversity of academic contact
than a small faculty can otherwise provide,
it has drawbacks:
—Having no permanent faculty member
in such important areas as Corporations,
deters continuity. For example,
student-faculty projects in those fields are
limited to nine months, or less.

—Some faculty members this year must
teach the same class twice to first year
students.
' —Ongoing student-faculty ties which
first-year small sections are designed to
encourage can only continue for a year
when visiting professors teach these classes.
Ideally, the permanent faculty should
cover all major areas of jurisprudence, with
a visiting program to augment it and
replace its members on leave.
ADMISSIONS
The student body expansion should be
accompanied by a continued, even
increased, commitment to represent as
many facets of American culture as
possible. That minority enrollment has
decreased for the past two years, for
example, is suggestive of improvements yet
to be made; women and older people also
seem underrepresented.
Efforts should continue to attract to
Stanford members of these and other
groups who could add to the diversity of
interests and viewpoints that contribute to
an exciting and fulfilling legal education.
The scholarship fund of the Law School
could be increased to enhance the
possibility of achieving a diverse student
body.
THE FIRST-YEAR PROGRAM
The Law School's first-year program
must live up to the goal of establishing a
firm legal base. For example, the writing
program should be designed to assure that
students receive the attention they find
necessary to carry out this important
aspect of the first-year process attention
which has been lacking in many instances
in the past.
In addition other noticeable trends in

this year's first-year program suggest areas
of concern.
For instance, the large number of small
sections in those courses with the least
amount of class time and units is an
unfortunate trend toward reducing the
time during which students are exposed to
the intensive learning process which only a
small class can offer.
Moreover, it is alarming to note that
small sections are increasing in size.
PLACEMENT
For second and third-year students,
emphasis switches from getting into and
through law school to what happens
thereafter.
Some students find the large firms and
government agencies which are available
for personal contact through the placement
office insufficient to meet their career
goals.
While the Placement Office attempts to
maintain contacts with other segments of
the legal profession, the emphasis remains
upon those offices which can pay their
own expenses to Palo Alto.
Perhaps Stanford should look into
proposals being utilized elsewhere for
helping to fund visits to the Law School by
members of other, less affluent branches of
the legal profession.
The importance of these problems
varies, though each has significant impact
upon the legal education available at
Stanford. And we do not mean to suggest
that these areas of concern are not already
the subjects of long and hard thought by
members of the Law School community.
'We only direct attention to these

helping to fund visits to the Law School by
members of other, less affluent branches of
the legal profession.
The importance of these problems
varies, though each has significant impact
upon the legal education available at
Stanford. And we do not mean to suggest
that these areas of concern are not already
the subjects of long and hard thought by
members of the Law School community.
'We only direct attention to these
problems because this is a time when we,
the members of that community, should
begin assessing, and considering ways to
shape, the future of Stanford Law School
on the occasion of the dedication of these
buildings which are an important and
permanent part of that future.
The planning and construction of the
new law school have taken over a decade.
Those efforts culminate with this
weekend's Celebration.
As Dean Thomas Ehrlich noted,
Stanford Law School finally has a physical
plant to match the quality of its faculty
and students, and, we should add, its
alumni, staff, and administration. There is
much to celebrate.
But, to paraphrase the Bicentennial
theme to which this Celebration is partially
devoted, we must not simply honor past
accomplishments; there is much yet to be
done.
Fortunately, the new law school
provides an atmosphere conducive to the
work ahead of maintaining and enhancing
the Law School's dedication to the highest
quality legal education.
The classrooms are now of sufficient
size, number and appointment to permit a
most diverse, flexible and comfortable legal
education. And the library and faculty
offices are large enough to accommodate
the needs of students and faculty.
However, the new building and the
increase of fifty in the size of the student
body over the next three years impose two
special responsibilities:
—The Law School has achieved a high
degree of educational quality,
characterized by an open and informal
atmosphere which has been most
conducive to learning and teaching; that
quality must not be stretched too thin or
bent out of shape to fill the expanded
facilities.
—For the past several years, efforts to
enhance educational quality have
concentrated on constructing these
buildings. It is time now to turn to the
other, more subjective and perhaps more
difficult, if no less important, problems of
the school which could not receive the
attention they deserved during that
construction.
Toward the accomplishment of these
goals and in the spirit of this weekend's
dedication, we suggest several areas of
concern to which Stanford students,
faculty, administration, staff, and alumni
must now direct their energies.
FACULTY-STUDENT CONTACT
Stanford's major accomplishment has
been the maintenance of a high degree of
academic achievement in an informal
atmosphere of interaction and association
between students and faculty; as much can
be learned by students from faculty (and
vice versa) outside of the classroom as in it.
The new physical design of the Law
School attempts to encourage interaction.
Despite its benefits, a larger building,
especially one segmented into library,
classroom and faculty areas, fosters an
unconscious sense of isolation and
separation.
Primarily, security measures such as
closing off faculty areas at 6:30 p.m.
should be changed to emphasize free
faculty-student access while members of
both groups are in the building,even if this
would result in some property loss.
While everyone agrees that people
should come first at Stanford Law School,
those people who have encountered locked

doors intended to protect offices and
artwork may get a different sense of those
priorities.
Artwork, of course, is a welcome
addition to the facilities, but this is a law
school after all, not a museum.
As important as the physical attributes
of the building are the attitudes of its
occupants.
Therefore, faculty members are
encouraged to break up those potentially
forbidding corridors by keeping their doors
open as often as possible. And students are
especially encouraged to walk through the
open doors; and to keep a foot in the
closed ones.
STUDENT-STUDENT CONTACT
In addition to free access of students to
faculty (and vice versa), the old building
and the old student body size caused a
high degree of student interaction at all
times of the day.
The design of the new library while
spacious, conspires against such
interaction. When the lounge is closed, few
places exist where groups of students may
chat informally or study together without
disturbing others around them. Some or all
classrooms should remain open at night to
alleviate this problem.
Moreover, some student organizations
are threatened with financial problems
because of the loss of summer revenue
from the lounge, upon which the groups
depend for funds.
Perhaps a student organization
endowment fund should be established to
replace the faculty support of these
organizations which was removed a few
years back.
THE LIBRARY
Now that the library has expanded
quarters, it is time to expand its collection.
While library officials rightly stress quality
over quantity, they are the first to admit
that the collection is still insufficient to
meet the total research needs of its
students and faculty.
The present acquisition pace adds only a
relatively few volumes a year beyond
updating existing sets. Surely the millions
of dollars that went into building the
facility should not be wasted because of a
lack of the other necessary tools of legal
scholarship.
FACULTY HIRING
Beyond the problems of adapting the
new facilities to the Law School's
educational needs, are the more difficult,
ongoing problems of maintaining the most
diverse and exciting faculty and study
body possible.
For the past several years, Stanford Law
School has relied heavily upon large
numbers of visiting faculty members to
meet its teaching responsibilities 11 tin.,
year compard to a permanent faculty of
39, of whom several are on leave.
While this exposes students and faculty
to a greater diversity of academic contact
than a small faculty can otherwise provide,
it has drawbacks:
—Having no permanent faculty member
in such important areas as Corporations,
deters continuity. For example,
student-faculty projects in those fields are
limited to nine months, or less.

—Some faculty members this year must
teach the same class twice to first year
students.
' —Ongoing student-faculty ties which
first-year small sections are designed to
encourage can only continue for a year
when visiting professors teach these classes.
Ideally, the permanent faculty should
cover all major areas of jurisprudence, with
a visiting program to augment it and
replace its members on leave.
ADMISSIONS
The student body expansion should be
accompanied by a continued, even
increased, commitment to represent as
many facets of American culture as
possible. That minority enrollment has
decreased for the past two years, for
example, is suggestive of improvements yet
to be made; women and older people also
seem underrepresented.
Efforts should continue to attract to
Stanford members of these and other
groups who could add to the diversity of
interests and viewpoints that contribute to
an exciting and fulfilling legal education.
The scholarship fund of the Law School
could be increased to enhance the
possibility of achieving a diverse student
body.
THE FIRST-YEAR PROGRAM
The Law School's first-year program
must live up to the goal of establishing a
firm legal base. For example, the writing
program should be designed to assure that
students receive the attention they find
necessary to carry out this important
aspect of the first-year process attention
which has been lacking in many instances
in the past.
In addition other noticeable trends in

this year's first-year program suggest areas
of concern.
For instance, the large number of small
sections in those courses with the least
amount of class time and units is an
unfortunate trend toward reducing the
time during which students are exposed to
the intensive learning process which only a
small class can offer.
Moreover, it is alarming to note that
small sections are increasing in size.
PLACEMENT
For second and third-year students,
emphasis switches from getting into and
through law school to what happens
thereafter.
Some students find the large firms and
government agencies which are available
for personal contact through the placement
office insufficient to meet their career
goals.
While the Placement Office attempts to
maintain contacts with other segments of
the legal profession, the emphasis remains
upon those offices which can pay their
own expenses to Palo Alto.
Perhaps Stanford should look into
proposals being utilized elsewhere for
helping to fund visits to the Law School by
members of other, less affluent branches of
the legal profession.
The importance of these problems
varies, though each has significant impact
upon the legal education available at
Stanford. And we do not mean to suggest
that these areas of concern are not already
the subjects of long and hard thought by
