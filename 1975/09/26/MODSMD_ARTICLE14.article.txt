This dedication issue of the Stanford
Law Journal is our most ambitions effort
ever. Yet, the future of the Journal is in
serious doubt.
The obstacles we face are the usual
problems of inadequate funds and a
shortage of staff.
Funding
The Journal receives no money from the
Law School since we are not considered to
contribute to the "legal education" of
students. Consequently, all our operating
funds must come from other sources.
A four-page issue of the Journal costs
$250 to print, an eight-page issue $325. We
are able to account for only a portion of
these expenses, give our present sources of
income.
In the past, the Journal has depended a
great extent upon financing from the Law
Association. However, due to the late
opening of the law lounge and a general
cutback on expenditures by the Law
Association, this source has been depleted.
We have also relied upon advertising as a
source of revenue. But even if one-fourth
of our space were devoted to advertising,
only a portion of the total cost of
publication would be covered.
To meet our goal of continuity of
communication through bi-weekly
publication, it ,is essential that we find new
revenue sources. With that in mind, we are
beginning a sponsorship-subscription
campaign.
Our normal subscription rate is $7. This
amoung barely covers the cost of postage
and handling.
We are therefore offering a special
dedication subscription rate of $25 to all
alumni and friends of the Law School who
are concerned about the future of the
Journal. For $5O we offer an added bonus:
we will send you two copies of each issue
at no extra cost. {lf anyone wishes to
contribute $250 or $325, we will name the
issue in your honor and send you ten
copies and an autographed picture of Dean
Ehrlich.)
For your convenience, a subscription
coupon can be found elsewhere on this

page. Bring your coupon to our office in
Room 43. We'll be around all day Friday.
Staffing
There have been many contributors to
this special issue of the Journal , primarily
out of sympathy for the editor. However,
we need volunteers who are willing to work
for the paper on a regular or irregular basis.
Absolutely no previous experience in
journalism is required (or even desirable
since the bulk of the editorial staff has
none). If you have an idea about something
you think the Journal should cover
(besides the "book" mural in the library
basement), let us know; we'll probably
even assign it to you.
If you have no ideas, come by anyway
because we have plenty. And if you have
no ideas and do not care to hear ours,
come by and do some typing, layout, or
photography for us.
This offer is not limited to students. We
would like to see faculty, administration,
staff, and alumni play a greater role in this
publication. We therefore solicit your
journalistic contributions as well.
The Journal hopes to live up to your
commitments of time and money by
realizing the following objectives:
• Primarily, to promote the exchange of
ideas among all members of the Stanford
Law School community.
• To be an initiator of ideas; not only to
bring problems to the attention of the
community but to propose solutions.
• To discuss decisions and policies of
the Law School, and in particular to
monitor the six critical areas of concern
outlined in the adjacent editorial.
• Finally, but certainly not least
important, to inform you of what is
happening at the Law School, in the
surrounding areas, and in the legal
community; and to entertain.
We believe that the survival of the
Journal is important to continuing the high
quality of Stanford Law School. But only
with the help of all who care about the
Law School the students, faculty, staff,
administration, and friends can we'
realize our objectives.

we will send you two copies of each issue
at no extra cost. {lf anyone wishes to
contribute $250 or $325, we will name the
issue in your honor and send you ten
copies and an autographed picture of Dean
Ehrlich.)
For your convenience, a subscription
coupon can be found elsewhere on this

Staffing
There have been many contributors to
this special issue of the Journal , primarily
out of sympathy for the editor. However,
we need volunteers who are willing to work
for the paper on a regular or irregular basis.
Absolutely no previous experience in
journalism is required (or even desirable
since the bulk of the editorial staff has
none). If you have an idea about something
you think the Journal should cover
(besides the "book" mural in the library
basement), let us know; we'll probably
even assign it to you.
If you have no ideas, come by anyway
because we have plenty. And if you have
no ideas and do not care to hear ours,
come by and do some typing, layout, or
photography for us.
This offer is not limited to students. We
would like to see faculty, administration,
staff, and alumni play a greater role in this
publication. We therefore solicit your
journalistic contributions as well.
The Journal hopes to live up to your
commitments of time and money by
realizing the following objectives:
• Primarily, to promote the exchange of
ideas among all members of the Stanford
Law School community.
• To be an initiator of ideas; not only to
bring problems to the attention of the
community but to propose solutions.
• To discuss decisions and policies of
the Law School, and in particular to
monitor the six critical areas of concern
outlined in the adjacent editorial.
• Finally, but certainly not least
important, to inform you of what is
happening at the Law School, in the
surrounding areas, and in the legal
community; and to entertain.
We believe that the survival of the
Journal is important to continuing the high
quality of Stanford Law School. But only
with the help of all who care about the
Law School the students, faculty, staff,
administration, and friends can we'
realize our objectives.
This dedication issue of the Stanford
Law Journal is our most ambitions effort
ever. Yet, the future of the Journal is in
serious doubt.
The obstacles we face are the usual
problems of inadequate funds and a
shortage of staff.
Funding
The Journal receives no money from the
Law School since we are not considered to
contribute to the "legal education" of
students. Consequently, all our operating
funds must come from other sources.
A four-page issue of the Journal costs
$250 to print, an eight-page issue $325. We
are able to account for only a portion of
these expenses, give our present sources of
income.
In the past, the Journal has depended a
great extent upon financing from the Law
Association. However, due to the late
opening of the law lounge and a general
cutback on expenditures by the Law
Association, this source has been depleted.
We have also relied upon advertising as a
source of revenue. But even if one-fourth
of our space were devoted to advertising,
only a portion of the total cost of
publication would be covered.
To meet our goal of continuity of
communication through bi-weekly
publication, it ,is essential that we find new
revenue sources. With that in mind, we are
beginning a sponsorship-subscription
campaign.
Our normal subscription rate is $7. This
amoung barely covers the cost of postage
and handling.
We are therefore offering a special
dedication subscription rate of $25 to all
alumni and friends of the Law School who
are concerned about the future of the
Journal. For $5O we offer an added bonus:
we will send you two copies of each issue
at no extra cost. {lf anyone wishes to
contribute $250 or $325, we will name the
issue in your honor and send you ten
copies and an autographed picture of Dean
Ehrlich.)
