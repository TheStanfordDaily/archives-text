This issue of the Stanford Law Journal
is designed partly as the students welcome
to and memento for alumni and friends of
the Law School who are in Palo Alto for
Celebration.
In addition, as our first major issue of
the year, it in part seeks to introduce or
reintroduce the students to each other and
to Palo Alto and the Bay Area.
But for the most part, this newspaper is
designed by its readers. The balance (or
lack of it) of opinions and interests
represented depends upon the suggestions
and writing of people not on our staff.
While primarily this conforms to views
of interested students, the Journal wants to
hear from alumni, administrators, faculty,
staff and friends of the law school.
So if anyone feels that his or her views
on the new facilities (or on the best place
to eat chili in Palo Alto) are not
represented, it is not by our design, but by
your failure to bring them to us.
Come and see us down in Basement
Room 43. We'll print almost anything.
