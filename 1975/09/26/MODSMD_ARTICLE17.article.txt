## Celebrating Conservativism? 
### Casey McKeever, Carl Carlson, Larry Moss 
The opening of the new Stanford Law
School has occasioned a "Celebration" in
which the entire faculty, staff and student
body are expected to share the
administration's paroxysms of jubilation.
The enterprise has assumed such sublime
proportions that the American system's
most quintessential representative has
dedicated the complex. Disturbing as the
President's appearance may be, it is not an
event out of harmony with the primary
premises of Stanford Law School.
To many of us the celebration and new
school represent a vulgar display of wasted
resources, misplaced priorities, and elitist
exclusivism. We are unable to join the
enthusiasm of those who so fervently
identify with the new edifice. Disrespectful
though it may be, we dissent.
Ford's People
Gerald Ford undoubtedly felt quite at
home dedicating the new school. These are,
after all, his people.
Even though many here are amused or
revolted by him, and would never support
him or his "policies," the overwhelming
majority of students, faculty and
administrators occupy presitigious
positions within the established system and
perform valuable services for it.
While few believe the present state of
affairs is perfect, efforts at improvement
are directed towards making the existing
social, political and economic structure
function more smoothly and (in the great
tradition of Anglo-American law) more
"reasonably."
At no time are the fundamental
motivating forces propelling society
challenged. In this sense, Ford and
establishment critics have much in
common; all want the system to "work
better."

This is not to say that reformists
functioning within the established order
are evil, immoral, ignorant or corrupt. Most
are decent and intelligent persons.
But the immense impetus towards
participation (intellectually,
occupationally, socially) in the mainstream
is nearly irresistible.
Intrinsicly Unjust
It is our belief that intrinsic elements
operating within the present system
prevent the achievement of a genuinely
humane and just society.
These elements (the profit motive,
competitiveness, elitism, sexist
role-playing, racism) are precisely the sorts
of interests served by Stanford Law School
through the provision of man- and
woman-power for the most privileged and
powerful units of society.
One need only browse through the
descriptions of firms interviewing job
applicants here in order to perceive the
interests to which the school caters. The
homogeneity of commercial and corporate
practices is indeed stunning.
(Those seeking non-traditional or public
interest practices who must resort to the
pathetically dated files in the Placement
Office should not be surprised when
resumes and applications are returned to
sender; many offices move or are
discontinued after submitting notices of
potential openings; little effort is made to
update the hies.)
None can seriously dispute the reality of
corporate/commercial domination of the
job placement process.
Inescapable
But it could hardly be otherwise. The
system needs lawyers; they perform vital
functions for a society whose principal
business, as Calvin Coolidge once said, is
business.
(This remains true even with the

enormous expansion of governmental
bureaucracies; they, too serve the
fundamental purpose of stabilizing the
system and are generally extremely
receptive to the influences of the interests
they ostensibly regulate.)
Stanford Law School services these
needs, and performs the task efficiently.
Students are absorbed into the hypnotic
technicalities of narrow bodies of law
designed to reinforce that which is.
The realities of law school are such that
it is not easy to find the time or capacity
(so thoroughly does the process narrow
one's intellectual attention) for perspective
on the whole.
The recent policy of the law school
administration prohibiting full recognition
of new student organizations exemplifies
the role law students and lawyers are
expected to play.
There are, it is said, too many
organizations as it is; such associations
were fine when only the law review, law
association, moot court, and other
"established" groups were active.
But the proliferation of organizations in
the past several years (for minority racial
groups, women, etc.) has, so the argument
rims, diverted law students from the
primary thrust of a proper legal education,
i.e., the training and socialization of
lawyers to perform traditional legal
functions.
Students' time should be more confined
to receiving mainstream jurisprudential
dogma, and less energy should be spent on
activities extraneous to such duties.
As a result of this approach to legal
education, 12 million dollars can be spent
for a new law school complex, but $5OO
cannot be spared for an Asian Law
Association or a Stanford chapter of the
National Lawyers Guild.
Conservatism Celebrated
The new law school and the appearance
of Gerald Ford symbolize the power of the
legal profession and the conservative nature
of its role in American society.
The development of resources so vitally
needed to meet the needs of disadvantaged
segments of the population is neglected at
the expense of a multimillion dollar
showpiece.
Ford's warm reception typifies the
comraderie of the privileged and the
essential agreement upon the goals of a
proper legal education. The surface glitter
should not obscure the realities of Stanford
Law School's place in the corporate
system.
(McKeever, Carlson and Moss are 3d-year
students and members of the National
Lawyers Guild.)
