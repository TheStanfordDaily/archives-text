# A 						Dissent

### Publius II 
These are some impressions of the new
law school: The walls, carpets and
corridors are gray; more than once a
student has described the buildings as
sterile.
One student mistook the wall-hanging in
the first floor center of the library building
for a bulletin board. Another student,
upon seeing the locker room, shouted
"Where's the pool?" Yet another only
half-facetiously described the padding in
the library elevator as one of the new
school's works of art.
The new law school in some ways
improved upon the old. Offices are larger,
library books no longer need be hidden,
rooms no longer need be converted
frantically into interviewing spaces. The
school finally has a decent auditorium and

court room.
Yet the library is disappointing.
Shepard s are set apart from the Reporters,
so the researcher must shuttle between
them to check on cases. There are no large
tables at which to study, save in the
basement, so students must huddle in
carrels. Finally, a person trying to work
late at night or on Saturday, just at night
finds himself evicted from the premises.
In the old building, the back door
always at least was wedged open by the
latest discard from (or addition to) the
advance sheets. Red hots always could
obtain access. The openness of the old
building even spawned a new time zone,
L.E.T. (Logan Exam Time) whereby during
exams Ben Logan would study there from
4 in the afternoon until 6 the next
morning.
Not so in the new buildings. Half of the
doors are locked even during the day.

Those hot dogs who later in the term will
need to spend late evenings memorizing the
U.C.C. will be unable to do so at the law
school.
But access to the buildings is not the
only problem of the new law school. A
greater problem is the isolation the school
breeds.
Students are isolated from other
students because there is no place where
they naturally congregate; even the new front
courtyard has no benches on which people
can sit.
More than one student has been amazed
at the number of old faces he has yet to
see. Perhaps the opening of the lounge will
help, but no one is counting on it.
Students are isolated from the faculty
even more than from each other. It is
striking that the faculty offices ring the
library instead of the classrooms. Separate
lounges for faculty and students also will

decrease the amount of faculty-student
interaction.
The larger fear is that lack of access and
increased isolation will cause the school to
grow more formal. The red tape seems
more plentiful in the new buildings. Rules
are conspicuous and omnipresent. Is it just
imagination or are the doors to professors'
offices closed more often?
If anything in the past made Stanford a
unique law school, it was the informal
atmosphere which prevailed. Access to the
building was great, professors were easy to
approach, students were non-competitive
in their work. If the new surroundings
dissipate that atmosphere, they will have
wrought more" harm than good.
(Publius II is not James Madison or
Alexander Hamilton. It is, however, a
third-year student with an ear to the
student body and a yellow streak down his
back.)
