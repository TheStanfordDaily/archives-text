The Robert Crown Library, above, typifies the unimaginative and regimented
aspects of the law school complex. With its profusion of box-like offices and carrels,
long and unadorned hallways, and awkward dependence on elevators and stairways,
the intellectual focal point of the school is deprived of much of its sense of
community.
This is in marked contrast to the adjacent classroom building, below, whose
curvilinear classrooms and central stairway contribute to a comfortable, harmonious
academic environment.
