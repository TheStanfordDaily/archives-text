# Crown Quadrangle: A
## Architectural Appraisal 
### 
The Robert Crown Library, above, typifies the unimaginative and regimented
aspects of the law school complex. With its profusion of box-like offices and carrels,
long and unadorned hallways, and awkward dependence on elevators and stairways,
the intellectual focal point of the school is deprived of much of its sense of
community.
This is in marked contrast to the adjacent classroom building, below, whose
curvilinear classrooms and central stairway contribute to a comfortable, harmonious
academic environment.

Perhaps the most unusual feature of the Crown Quadrangle is that it is most
impressive when viewed from the rear. From this vantage point, particularly from
within the Arthur Cooley Courtyard, the awesomeness of the front is successfully
tempered through a variety of devices: more extensive landscaping, a diminished and
more irregular building scale, greater visibility and texture in the roof design, and
welcome departures from the ever-present ochre-colored masonry, notably through the
use of wooden beams and red brick.
