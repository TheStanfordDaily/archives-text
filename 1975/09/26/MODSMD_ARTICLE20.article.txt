## The
						Galloping Glutton Chile Addict Gets a Fix on Area Offerings 
### Lage Andersen 
As a service to those with sensitive and
cultivated palates, I singlehandedly tested
the chili in six area restaurants. In fact, I
tried five of the six chili's within a space of
three days, an act certainly indicative of an
unbalanced mind and possibly a self
destructive one.
But I survived, and my wife, Modell,
who accompanied me faithfully and ate
other things, has likewise suffered no ill
effects. Just lately, however, she has
developed an unreasonable fear of elevators
and other enclosed places, refusing to go in
them, especially when I am with her.
I am dealing with what should properly
be called chili con carne. I am aware of the
existence of other kinds of chili, but am
only on a first name basis with the one that
has meat and beans in a broth of tomatoes,
onion, chili powder, red pepper and what
not, and is called "chili" by those of us
who don't know any better.
IHOP Maturity
I eat a lot of chili and I'm not real
discriminating about it, either. I'm fearless
maybe a little bit reckless. I once
ordered chili in an International House of
Pancakes in Indianapolis, a decision
ill-advised at the least, and maybe even
suicidal. It tasted like seasoned wall-paper
paste.
(Nowadays when I go to an IHOP, I eat
pancakes. I consider that a sign of personal
growth and maturity as well as sound
medical practice.)
I realize that there are many people who
don't eat much chili, some of them with
perfectly normal tastebuds. Modell does
not like chili. For a long while I was
convinced her palate had been covered
with Teflon at birth, but an ear, nose and
throat man from Chicago, after exhaustive
tests, assured me that such was not the
case.
My outlook on that subject has also
matured. I no longer consider it my burden
to convince her that chili is the world's
most sublime and delicious food. When I
make a batch at home, she doesn't eat any
of it. I don't have to fight her off in order
to get my fair share, which I figure is much
bigger than her fair share. I can sit back,
contented and secure, feeling like a
millionaire who pays no income tax.
Keep in mind while perusing the ratings
that follow that the grades I would give to
various chilis are like the grades given to
Stanford undergraduates: somewhat
inflated.
The reason that I am unlikely to label
something inedible or lousy is not only
because I find chili ambrosial, but also
because I happily find almost everything
quite edible, except maybe popsicle sticks
and coffee cups, which I haven't found a
way to efficiently digest yet, and
mayonnaise, which I simply detest.
Palate Paranoia
I don't eat in restaurants a whole lot
and there is good reason for this. Modell is,
within her range, a superior cook. So why
should I take a chance on what some
stranger is doing to food I'm about to eat?
When out to eat, I brood a lot while
WSn-iiig to be served, over what the cook is
doing. I worry a little about cholesterol
and monosodium glutamate and saturated
fat, as well as atherosclerosis, hypertension
and maybe a peptic ulcer or two, but those
are the risks you take if you plan on eating
something that tastes good.
What really haunts me is that out there
in the kitchen where I can't see him,
somebody is grabbing a frozen prepared
item or worse yet, opening a can, and is
about to send out, to me, something which
can legally be called chili only because the
FDA has such lax standards.
On top of it all, those bandits will
charge me five times what they bought it
for, the differential being accounted for in
the specialized training you need to pop a

little frozen plastic bag into boiling water
or operate an electric can opener.
I have bad dreams about that.
Fortunately, the chili joint is one of the
last bastions of homemade, non-assembly
line food. As if to emphasis this fact, good
chili is usually served in places with a
whole lot of atmosphere, places that I
would call unpretentious and homey and
my wife would call crummy and dirty.
I haven't figured it out yet, except
maybe that plaster flaking from the ceiling
or the chili left over from the day before

adds some special flavor to the cauldron on
the stove. The best chili in the area is
served in two places both cast in this mold
the Dutch Goose, and Art's Chili Bowl.
The Goose
The legendary Dutch Goose serves the
best chili around. Late at night when Tax
merges imperceptibly with Evidence, and
I begin to consider the materiality and
admissibility of certain business
deductions, my thoughts turn naturally to
chili and The Goose.
The Goose has atmosphere, some of the
thickest in town, including a carpet of
peanut shells that are pleasantly crunchy
underfoot. The chili is meaty, the beef in
chunks and shreds rather than ground.
I rate shredded or chunky meat chili a
plus on the basis of more interesting
texture; it gives you something to get your
teeth into. The seasoning at the Goose
ranges from mild to ferocious.
The night after the Civil Procedure final
last January, the chili was memorably
fierce. The guy behind the counter said it
was hot, so if they ever warn you, pay
attention. The first bite cleared up the
sinus problem I had suffered with all
through finals.
Usually the chili at the Goose has zest
to it. I rate heat in chili partly on the flow
it stimulates from the tear ducts and partly
on the time it takes me to recover the
power of speech. Unlike the guys on the
old Rolaids commercials, I like that
burning sensation.
I think the chili is 80 cents a bowl.
When the chili madness is upon me I turn
over my money willingly. Anyway, I think
they give me change from a dollar; I don't
really care. The Dutch Goose is at the
corner of Alameda de las Pulgas and Avy in
Menlo Park.
Art's
My sentimental favorite is Art's Chili
Bowl, not only because it is a genuine chili
joint which traffics mainly in chili and in
other things only as a sideline, but because
a trip to Art's is an experience we all need.
Art's chili is excellent ($1.05 a bowl),
almost as good as the Goose chili, with
plenty of ground meat.
I did have some overly greasy chili there
once, but I don't think it's the general rule.
It's mild as it is served, so sissies can eat
there, but for fire fans there is a bowl of
red pepper flakes on the counter.
The atmosphere at Art's is unparalleled.

In one corner sits an old T.V. set, opposite
that a stuffed chair that Art sits in a lot.
You eat at picnic tables. There are
newspapers strewn about.
The walls are adorned with Hamm's and
Coor's signs, the kind with outdoor scenes
that light up. There's a poster that reads
"Save on Gas Eat Art's Chili."
In the same vein some artist has
creatively altered the sign on the side of
the building by adding a letter to "Art's."
Art used to have a sign that said "Please
Speak 99 Times Louder" because he
doesn't hear well at all.
In fact, he has to shout in order to hear
what he is saying himself. Art is a senior
citizen, probably older than most
California Redwood trees.
Go to Art's and drink it in. It's a
neighborhood place where people come in
because they're fond of Art and don't
mind eccentric service. Art's is at 1407 El
Camino in Mountain View; that's between
Bailey Avenue and Castro Street. Art is
open till around 9 p.m. every night, but try
to get there so you don't keep him up past
nine. He gets tired because he gets up
before 6 a.m. to make his chili.
Estrelleta
Estrelleta is a family run establishment
which serves several kinds of chili,
including red and green chili con carne and
chili con queso. The red chili con carne was
very good, the meatiest by far of the chili's
I've tried, with chunks and shreds of beef.
It was pretty mild, but on each table is a
bowl of hot sauce that should be kept in an
asbestos container. Add it to taste and
you're in business. I tasted a slight sourness
to the Estrelleta chili, which I did not
enjoy, so I rate it a little below the Goose
and Art's.
At $1.75, including tortilla chips, it was
the most expensive of the chilis, but the
amount of meat justifies the price.
Transition and Kettle
The Transition at Tresidder and the
Soup Kettle at Stanford Shopping Center
serve undistinguished chili. The Transition
product is so tame that except for the
beans it is virtually indistinguishable from
spaghetti sauce.
At 65 cents it is very reasonable, but
don't forget to add in the cost of your
labor in carrying cayenne and red pepper
around with you to make it interesting
enough to bother with.
The chili at the Soup Kettle suffers
from the same underseasoning as
Tresidder's, but you pay $1 for a bowl.
They have Tabasco sauce to liven it up,
but I don't care for the vinegar taste that
you get with Tabasco. The atmosphere at
both places is similar, kind of aseptic,
adding no flavor at all.
Marie Callender's?
I thought the IHOP chili had taught me
a lesson, but I purposely went to Marie
Callender's Pie House to sample their
product. That's like dropping into a CIA
party to sample the punch.
I wasn't thinking clearly. Then again, I
think I have inherited this penchant for
waling into gastronomic mine fields from
my father. He exhibits this tendency when
he buys a car. He has owned, since our
1952 Ford fell apart in the winter of 1966,
a succession of three Mercury Comets, a
1960, a 1962, and the 1965 he now drives,
which, I figure, is more or less the ultimate
in asking for trouble.
I didn't have any trouble eating the
chili, but neither would anyone else with
the culinary discretion of a goat. The menu
read "Chili with Beans," so they didn't
actually lead me to believe there was going
to be any meat in it. But at $1.30 a bowl,
served with cornbread, I figured I was
entitled. There was some meat in it, the
kind you see in cheap canned beef soup,
little shreds floating in the broth.
As if to emphasize its meatlessness,
Callender's chili is absolutely brimming

with not just one, but two kinds of beans,
the usual red beans, plus big kidney beans.
I have heard rumors that the cook is a
former racing enthusiast who has inhaled
too many exhaust fumes.
He now spends his days zealously
searching for the chili formula to generate
the compression ratio he needs to win the
big one at Indy on a scooter.
I do have a few kind words for
Calender's. The place is fairly pleasant, the
service is quick, and the pie is OK if you
can't make your own. But stay away from
the chili.
And on the Side...
As a well known social arbiter, I am
constantly besieged by people who want to
know what is proper to drink when eating
chili. The "in" beverage as far as I am
concerned is definitely the chocolate
milkshake, but such friends as I have tell
me that this is disgusting and possibly
illegal in some states. (One can partake of
this exotic combination at the Peninsula
Creamery in Palo Alto. I haven't been there
since last year, but the chili was pretty
good, as I remember it.)
For those who lack the sophistication
required to understand the subtlety and
blending of flavors in the chili and
chocolate milkshake combination, I suggest
you drink beer with your chili. Art's, The
Goose, and Estelleta all serve a variety of
beer. Significantly, Marie Callender's, the
Transition, and The Soup Kettle do not.
The best thing about beer is that after a
spoonful of some really hot chili, a swig of
beer tastes stingingly cool, and it seems as
if the beer is washing away the effects of
hot pepper.
Wrongo! Soon you find that it's just
spreading it out, like water on a gasoline
fire. Then, as your eyes well up with tears,
and last summer's sunburn returns to your
cheeks, you clear your throat a few times
and, in a noise resembling human speech,
you croak, "Boy, that's good chili!"
