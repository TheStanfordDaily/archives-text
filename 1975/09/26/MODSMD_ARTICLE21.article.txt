### From the Kitchens of Betty Cracker 
Lemon Delight (a light, fluffy and
inexpensive dessert)
1. dissolve 1 small size package lemon jello
in IV2 cups boiling water + V2 cup lemon
juice. Chill for 1 hr.
2. whip one can of evaporated milk
(chilled) and gradually add 2 cups sugar.
Whip until fairly stiff.
3. crush 14 graham crackers into fine
crumbs with rolling pin.
4. spread half of crumbs on bottom of
9x13 cake pan; mix the jello and milk
mixtures together and pour on top of
crumbs; top with remainder of crumbs.
Chill until set.
5. variations:
make lime delight substituting lime for
lemon ingredients.
put in a circular dish
use for ammo at food fights
1. V2 cup lemon juice is about right,
though more or less to taste is
permissable; however, total liquid
should not exceed 2 cups.
2. Those familiar with the historical
origins of grahams may prefer to use
vanilla wafer crumbs.
