## Faculty Revue Getman on Local Movie Scene 
### Julius G. Getman 
There are several films worth seeing
currently playing in the Palo Alto area.
One of the best is Woody Allen's Love and
Death which lives up to its excellent
reviews.
The film as the title implies
parodies the great Russian novels of the
19th century, features Allen as a Russian
nobelman trying to come to grips with
love, sex, death and morality through a
series of major personal and national crises.
Through them all Allen exhibits a
wonderously inappropriate sanity which
places him at odds with most of the rest
of the world. This is the best of Aliens
films. It is visually satisfying and the
personality of his protaganist has
deepened. He is less of a schlemiel and
more likeable than usual.
(It is difficult to dislike a character who
when told by a woman with whom he has
an affair that he is a great lover responds
modestly "well I practice a lot when I am
alone.") The slapstick scenes are filmed
with a style and pace reminiscent of the
Marx Brothers at their best.
Paltry Panther
The Return of the Pink Panther which
has also been widely praised is
disappointing. The problem is not with
Peter Sellers who is splendid as the
marvelously inept Inspector Clouzot.
The opening scene, in which Clouzot
argues about the technical legal problems of
a permit with an organ grinder while a
nearby bank is being robbed is in the best
tradition of the. original Pink Panther and
Shot in the Dark.
Unfortunately, the film ultimately
degenerates into a series of repetitive
slapstick incidents. A disastrous decision
was made to have Clouzot wasting his time
in a hotel in the Alps while the main action
of the film is taking place somewhere in
the Middle East.
Music, Not Moralizing
Also currently available in Palo Alto is
Robert Altman's highly acclaimed
Nashville. It is not as good as some of the
original reviews claimed but it is better
than its recent detractors have argued.
The movie is at its best in exploring the

complex world of country music. The
characters run a garnet recognizable to
anyone who is moderately knowledgeable
about such music.
Ronny Blakee playing a woman singer
obviously modeled after Loretta Lynn does
a splendid job. Her singing, like Loretta's,
makes you feel that she has lived through
every hackneyed phrase she is singing
about.
Karen Black does a good job of creating
a character half relying on talent, half on
sex in the manner of Lynn Anderson.
There are other recognizable characters
such as Charlie Pride and a male singer,
combining aspects of Johnny Cash and
Tom T. Hall.
Some of the best scenes feature the
interchange between the lead singers and
the backup musicians. The backup
musicians really get into it when Blakee is
singing but just go through the motions
when a basically non-talented phony
played by Henry Gibson is on.
As is true in country music the backup
musicians are uniformly first rate, although
there is nothing comparable to the quality
of the Area Code 615 groups. The musical
scenes could have been even better if
outstanding backup players like Charlie
McCoy or Ken Buttry had been featured.
The film also offers a series of finely
honed vignettes about the different ways in
which people relate to each other sexually.
In general male-female relations are
handled with sensitivity and insight.
The film is not guilty of snobbery as has
sometimes been charged. For example, the
least appealing character in the movie is a
pseudo-intellectual from the BBC. Potshots
are taken at rock groups, Hollywood actors
and California.
Despite its virtues the film is
overburdened with deep meaning. Altman
was not satisfied with making a good film
about country music and human
relationships. He wanted to tell us
something profound about the American
political system and the violence and
hypocracy which exist in it. Altman has
little to add as a political thinker and his
efforts to lecture the audience were
insulting.

Mitchum Re-make
I heartily recommend Fairwell My
Lovely which is a much better film than its
reviews suggest. It features a splendid
acting performance by Robert Mitchum.
This is the film Mitchum has been hinting
for some time that he would someday do.
Unlike Nashville there is no pretense at
profundity; just a first class, semi-violent
mystery story in the manner of films made
in the 40's. Yet on occasion, it makes one
empathize with the' hero who is a decent
person in an ugly violent world bound and
hindered by a scheme of values he doesn't
quite accept yet cannot shake. This is done
unobtrusively in a manner reminiscent of
Noel Coward's Private Lives.
Oldies, But...
There are also several revivals which are
well worth seeing. If you missed it you
should see Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore which has some moments which
are extremely touching and funny. The
relationship between Ellen Burstyn and her
son is particularly well handled. It
convincingly portrays the difficulties of
developing a satisfactory relationship
between a parent and a hip pre-teenager.

Showing together with Alice is They
Shoot Horses Don't They which is an
extraordinarily good film which can be
enjoyed on many different levels.
Mel Brooks Young Frankenstein was
somewhat overpraised but it is a good film.
Co-author Gene Wilder is excellent as the
heir of Dr. Frankenstein. Madeline Kahn
and Clair Leachman are very good, though
the picture is almost stolen by Marty
Feldman who is wonderfully funny as the
hunchback Igore.
For those too young to remember it
Grapes of Wrath is currently playing and
should be seen. You may find the political
philosophy less than profound. But it is a
powerful well-acted, well-directed,
sometimes moving film which recreates the
mood and feeling of the depression.
Finally, if you act quickly you can see
some filmed plays which were part of the
original AFT film series. By far the best of
these is Oliver's superb version of Chekov's
Three Sisters. It is the finest film rendition
of a play I have ever seen. The acting is
superb and the camera is used very
effectively.
If none of these are appealing thee is
always Hawkins v. Mcgee.
