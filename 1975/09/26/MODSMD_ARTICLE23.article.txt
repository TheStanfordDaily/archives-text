# Guide to "Restaurants"

### 
(Editor's Note: The Crother's Gourmand
Society, now disbanded, recommends (or
recommends avoiding) the following
culinary experiences for the discriminating
diner who 's got an hour or less.)
Nice Atmosphere and
good food ($5-$10)
CHUCK'S CELLER. Breasts and thighs
galore! Beautiful jocks and dollies serve
high class meals including Julio's Sunday
fried chicken special at a bargain price of
$3.75. (All dinners include salad bar and
soup.) Chuck's specialty, however, is
steaks. (El Camino, Los Altos)
NEW VARSITY: THEATRE
RESTAURANT. Have a seafood crepe with
your popcorn. With a $5 purchase at this
dining room in the theater lobby, you
receive one free admission to that evening's
performance. (University Ave.)
CHEF CHU'S. The cost of food is a
Great Wall to your dining pleasure. For
reasonably good Mandarin food, Chef
Chu's is the place to go. Given the
relatively skimpy portions of food, Chef
Chu's is overpriced. (El Camino, Los Altos)
WINERY. You've seen hundreds like it
before and it is no better or worse than the
other steak, salad bar and free wine joints
around the country. The cocktail lounge
features decent live music nightly. (El
Camino, Palo Alto)
GHENGIS KHAN. For a novel and
active meal, broil your own beef, seafood,
or pork on a charcoal broiler in the middle
qf each table. (Dinners include fried rice,
bean sprouts and teriyaki sauce.) (Alma
St., Los Altos)
No Atmosphere and well,
Food ($2-$5)
MBJ RANCH. Lyndon's little brother,
Mike, broils a fine steer. Tasty budget
steaks, burgers and fish and chips.
(Ramona St., P.A.)
SERGIO'S. Almost Italian; Almost
Mexican; Almost good. (University Ave.)
UNIVERSITY ROUNDTABLE. If
you're lucky, you might see John Kaplan.
Ask him why he likes the pizza!
(University Ave.)
RUDOLFO'S. If you've enjoyed your
neighbor's slides of Europe, you'll love the
Rudolfo brother's day-glo vistas of all the
old favorites. Dinners include minestrone
soup, salad, garlic bread, and dessert. Large
portions and langorous meals, but some
contend that The Florentine on Castro St.
or VlP's on Embarcadero, are better. (El
Camino, P.A.)
FRANKIE, JOHNNY'S and LUIGI'S
TOO. The only thing longer than the name
is the wait. Be prepared to wait 30-45
minutes before being seated. The pizza is

delightful. (El Camino past San Antonio
Rd.)
GEORGE'S. Is it worth going four miles
for dorm food? If your answer is yes, be
sure to try this quaint steakhouse
decorated in "early diner." (Walnut St.,
Menlo Pk.)
KIRK'S. Grills you burgers, burns your
pocketbook, and smokes your lungs. A
poorly ventilated charcoal grill and high
prices hinder one's enjoyment of an
excellent hamburger. (California St., P.A.)
Negative atmosphere and
arguable food (sl-$3)
STANFORD BARN. A new slant on
Continental food. You may discover that
many of the Italian, American, Mexican
and Chinese meals are almost
indistinguishable from one another. The
Stanford Barn may provide a reasonable
alternative to many of the fast food chains
in the area. (Stanford Shopping Center)
KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN. The
Colonel does his thing across the street
from ex-Mayor Sher's favorite massage
parlor. (El Camino, P.A.)
H. SALT ESQUIRE. Or, across the
street, you can lube your innards here. (El
Camino, P.A.)
JACK-IN-THE-BOX. Or, across the
street, you can watch Jack engage in
practically tortious activities 24 hours a
day. (El Camino, P.A.)
ARBY'S. Soybean farmer's delight! (El
Camino, Menlo Pk.)
THE STANFORD HOSPITAL
CAFETERIA. Help is near... For
institutional food, the hospital is often as
good as the dorm and the price is usually
over a dollar less.
ENCINA TRESSIDER. Assault with
intent to commit mayhem. Rumor has it
that it won't be long before you can have
beer with your burger at Tresidder.
COFFEEHOUSE. Grand Larceny. Good
sandwiches, coffee, and sodas at inflated
prices.
Intoxicating atmosphere
and burgers
DUTCH GOOSE, OASIS, and ZOT'S
(Alpine Beer Garden). These are the three
traditional Stanford watering holes. If you
are under age, Zot's is your best bet. There
is no hope of even getting in at the Oasis if
you are under age or have a questionable
ID. The burgers are excellent at all three
spots.
(The Crothers Gourmand Society,
responsible for the preceding ratings,
includes John Reed, Fred Brunetti, Mike
Shepard, Carl Siegal, David Golay, Doug
Fant, and a host of other growling
stomachs.)
