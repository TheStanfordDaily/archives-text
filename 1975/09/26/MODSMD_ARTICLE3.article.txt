# The 						New Buildings: A Step Forward
## 
### Stephen Samuels 
A new era dawns upon Stanford Law
School with the dedication of its new
complex of buildings on Friday, September
26.
The $11.9 million facility, 11 years in
the planning and construction, provides the
school with three times the square footage
it had in the old building. For the first
time, Stanford Law School has a facility
designed especially for its needs.
History
The need for a new law school became
apparent in the early 19605, when it was
realized that the several year old annex
would not answer the expanding physical

needs of the school. A study of the
possibility of expansion into the old
business school was undertaken but soon
shelved as inadequate.
Upon the initiative of the then Dean
Bayless Manning, "Agenda for Legal
Education" was established, a campaign to
obtain new library, student scholarship,
faculty, research and building endowments.
A program design for the new school
was undertaken in 1965, with input from
faculty, students and staff. In 1968 the
working drawings were completed, with a
working budget for the new building of $9
million.
However, to begin construction it was

necessary to have in the bank funds equal
to the entire estimated cost of the new
buildings. Plans for the new law school had
to be terminated for lack of money.
In 1971, Dean Thomas Ehrlich, with the
assistance of Asst. Dean Gary Bayer, took
on the raising of the required funds as his
priority function. Finally, thanks to
multi-million dollar contributions from the
Lucie Stern Trust and the Robert Crown
family, the necessary revenue was
committed.
Ground-breaking for the new complex
took place in August of 1972. However,
the projected completion date of Sept. 1,
1974 could not be met because of
inclement weather at the crucial
ground-digging and foundation stage and
strikes by construction workers.
The move into the new facilities finally
took place in the late spring of 1975.
Commencement ceremonies in the Arthur
E. Cooley courtyard (for the class of 197 5)
were the first official activity at the new
school.
Mid-'6os Building
The final design of the new law school is
basically the same as the 1968 plan, with
minor revisions changing the interior of the
library and providing more storage space.
Because ground-breaking occurred
before the energy crisis, no major
structural changes could be made in the
basic design. As a result, the facility is
energy inefficient, with a high candle
power and a dependence upon air

conditioning. Partly as a consequence of
this, library hours are being limited.
Additionally, the buildings were
designed at a time when security was of
little concern. Administrators are now
finding it difficult to secure the facility
with its forty exterior doors and
complexity of stairways and corridors,
short of locking stairways, corridors and
entrances.
Associate Dean Joseph Leininger noted,
"this is a mid-'6os building. It is a good
deal more elaborate than we would build
now, but we were bound to the plans."
Still the new facility has been met with
widespread enthusiasm.
Leininger termed the facility "a very
substantial step forward in the emergence
of Stanford Law School as one of the top
institutions in the country because it not
only corrects deficiencies but its style and
appointment are quite unique."
Dean Thomas Ehrlich was equally
enthusiastic. "I think the new buildings are
great. I'm very excited about them. For the
first time I think we have facilities that
match the quality of the students and
faculty. Before, we had a second-rate plant.
Now we have a superb plant, as good as or
better than any one in the country."
Excitement Justified
The excitement over the new complex is
justified. The four buildings that now
comprise Stanford Law School are
unparalleled in excellence and beauty for
an institution of its type.
Each of the four units of Crown
Quadrangle is designed to perform a
distinct educational function. The largest
of the buildings, is the Robert Crown
Library, which houses the School's library
and offices.
For the first time, the law school's
library has adequate space to display its
entire collection of books and to seat the
entire student body at one time. Moreover,
it is probably one of the most pleasant law
libraries in the country, according to
Librarian Myron Jacobstein.
Faculty offices, the largest on campus,
are also an exercise in comfort. Each office
is furnished with a comfortable sofa and
chairs. Additionally, every office has a
large plate glass window looking out on the
Stanford campus.
The main foyer of the administration
building was designed to be a central hub
through which students, faculty and staff
would pass and meet. "The notion of
faculty and students moving through
common areas is working well," Dean
Ehrlich noted.


The above are early conceptions of the new Law School-to-be drawn by former
Dean Manning during the early planning stages.
The second largest building is F.I.R.
Hall, named after Frederick I. Richman,
which contains six classrooms, four
seminar rooms, two conference rooms, and
the moot court room.
The air conditioned, carpeted, and
multi-color-striped classrooms have met
with almost universal acclaim. The special
horseshoe design allows for smaller rooms,
better acoustics, and inter-student
visibility. (Another advantage of the
design, as some first-year students are
quickly learning in Socratic classes is that
by sitting at the end of the horseshoe they
are actually behind the professor and are
unlikely to be called upon.)

An innovation of the classroom building
is the post-mortem rooms, where
professors can meet with students after
class without hindering access to the
classroom. It is not known whether any
professor has actually used one of these
rooms yet. This might be due to the rooms'
unfortunate name. "No one died in any of
my classes," one faculty member noted.
The moot court room is more richly
outfitted than most actual court rooms,
despite its basement location.
An added feature of the classroom
building is the no-smoking regulation
throughout.
Lounge
Connecting the administration and
classroom buildings is the James Irvine
Gallery, containing faculty and student

meeting rooms and lounges.
Comprising most of the ground floor of
the gallery is the elaborately furnished
"49'er" lounge, supervised this year by
second year student Howard Parelskin and
managed by Kristan Van Kirk, a food
technology major at Canada College.
The lounge, donated by the class of '49,
is designed upon the basis of fast-food
cafeterias in San Francisco. It will provide
basically the same services as last year at
comparable prices but more efficiently and
with better equipment.
"As you know, last year the lounge was
a zoo. There was no space," noted Erika
Kaltenbach, manager of office services.
"The original plans for the new lounge
set aside a smaller serving area than the old
lounge, but it was professionally designed
to meet health codes and for maximum
efficiency," Kaltenbach commented.
"Let's call it space efficient," said
Parelskin.
"The lounge can be a really important
place for students and faculty to meet and
converse," Parelskin noted.
Proceeds from the lounge go to the Law
Association, which in turn funds many of
the student organizations.
Audio-Visual
Kresge Auditorium, the fourth building
of the complex, accommodates 600
persons, more than the total student and
faculty population of the law school.
The auditorium, along with classrooms
280 and 290 and the moot court room,
have full, self-contained, sound systems.
In addition, there is an audio-visual
system in the basement whereby signals
from the library, classrooms, or moot court
room can be piped directly into other

classrooms or the moot court room. Or,
the signals can be videotaped and relayed
at a later time over television monitors.
Architects for the new law school were
Skidmore, Owens and Merrill. The chief
designer was Michael Bolton. John Bowles
and Associates were the interior
decorators.
Now that the law school is finally
housed in its new facilities, the faculty and
administration believe that it faces a new
challenge to avoid complacency.
Dedication is viewed as the dawning of a
new era, not the end of an old one.
"We now have the space to do whatever
we have the wisdom and imagination to
do," according to Dean Ehrlich. "We need
more faculty, more scholarships, endowed
student organizations. To develop
curriculum in new ways and maintain
scholarship is our most important
priority."


Professor Moffatt Hancock took a more historical approach furnishing his office with
pieces found around the University.


Professor Paul Brest's office shows the
modernistic bent taken by some faculty
members in designing their offices.
