# 1000 Visitors Expected
## Seminars, Skits Spark "Celebration" 
### 
(For a list of the activities, times and places,
see the schedule at the beginning of this
issue.)
The opening of Crown Quadrangle, the
new Law School facilities, is "an event
worthy of Celebration," according to the
literature sent to about 6,000 alumni and
"friends of Stanford Law School," inviting
them to Palo Alto this weekend.
The office of Gary Bayer, assistant dean
for alumni affairs, has designed the
Celebration program particularly with
those people in mind to coincide with the
dedication of the new buildings. Some 500
to 1,000 people are expected to attend.
Celebration is "primarily an alumni
affair," according to Bayer, although its
activities should have wider appeal and
include basically student affairs like Friday
night's dance.
In addition, Celebration is "away of
saying thanks to those who contributed
funds to the new Law School." Special
activities for major donors will be held
Thursday.
Bayer noted that Celebration is not the
usual dedication of a new law school."The
"traditional dedication is to have the
contractor hand over the buildings to the
Dean who gives it to the Board of
Directors," according to the assistant dean.
Presidents and Future Judges
Instead, Celebration coincides with 20
class reunions and was designed to have
maximum alumni participation possible.
According to Bayer, "We wanted our
alumni to feel that this is still their law
school, even though it continues to
change."
The emphasis will therefore be on a
celebration of Stanford Law School's
tradition and history, as well as the new
buildings. In this vein, Celebration is an

official Bicentennial activity.
In particular, a pictorial history of the
Law School will be on display. In addition,
people who contributed to that history,
including former deans and professors will
be honored.
Similarly, the opening of the new school
was not designed, like some, as an
important jurisprudential event to which
the deans of all the law schools gather to

hear speeches by eminent jurists.
Except for alumni and former faculty,
no law school deans were invited. And
while United States Supreme Court Chief
Justice Warren Burger and Justice William
Rehnquist (a Stanford graduate) were
invited, as well as Justice Donald Wright of
the California Supreme Court (none of
whom could attend), the decision was
made to have President Gerald Ford
headline the dedication, if possible.
Most of the dignitaries who participate
in the dedication, therefore, are Stanford
alumni or special friends of the School.
Those people include Senator Frank
Church, Congressman Paul McCloskey who
joined President Ford last weekend,
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Carla Hills, Special
Presidential Assistant Rod Hills, and Judge
Shirley Hufstedler of the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals. (Thus, while no
current male member of the Supreme
Court will attend, the guest list may
include one or two future
female members.)
Ambitious Program
"Celebration is the most ambitious
alumni program we've ever put on," noted
Bayer.
That program includes 18 "Celebration
Seminars," three held during six different
hours on Friday and Saturday. These
events, most of which will be directed by
faculty, stress Bicentennial themes,
education in action, new directions in the
law, as well as panel discussions with an
eye toward alumni participation.
Students and the public are invited as
well.
In a lighter vein, the alumni and visitors
are invited to an entertainment revue at
which students and the musical comedy
duo of (Dean Joseph) Leininger and
(Professor Moffatt) Hancock (no, that isn't
the name of a stuffy New York law firm)
will perform on Friday at 12:30 in Kresge
Auditorium.
After the actual dedication ceremonies
Friday afternoon (at which Dean Ehrlich
has promised to keep his remarks short), an
evening of entertainment will commence
with a champagne reception and continue

with the Celebration Banquet at which
Gilbert and Sullivan's "Trail by Jury," will
be performed.
Saturday afternoon, after a morning of
Celebration seminars, will be devoted to
athletic events including the Stanford-San
Jose football game as well as
student-alumni tennis, softball, volleyball
and golf.
That night, 20 reunions will be held for
members of classes ending in 0,1, 5 and 6.
In addition to the ceremonies, the
buildings themselves will be celebrated in a
book.
The costs of Celebration will largely be
defrayed by the alumni registration and
money raised specifically for this purpose.
The food was all paid for with non-law
school funds and the wine which will be
served at the banquet was donated by local
wineries.
Students, Too
The alumni emphasis has not precluded
student participation on Celebration. Not
only will students serve as guides to, and
participants in, many of the events, but
also student organization offices will
be open all day Friday for alumni visits.
In addition, largely as a result of the
efforts of an eight-person student
committee which worked with Bayer, a
"semi-semi-formal" dance will be held
Friday night at the Palo Alto Hills Country
Club.
And of special interest to students, of
course, was the cancelling of classes Friday
and the admonition to faculty to avoid
weekend reading assignments (a rule with
great educational value in itself given the
supreme faculty efforts at narrow
construction, distinguishing of peculiar fact
situations theirs and law making at the
interstices.)
Nevertheless, as Bayer noted, the "aim
is to have enough different things to do at
all times to appeal to everybody."
