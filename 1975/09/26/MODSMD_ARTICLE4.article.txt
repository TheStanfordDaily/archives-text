The opening of Crown Quadrangle, the
new Law School facilities, is "an event
worthy of Celebration," according to the
literature sent to about 6,000 alumni and
"friends of Stanford Law School," inviting
them to Palo Alto this weekend.
The office of Gary Bayer, assistant dean
for alumni affairs, has designed the
Celebration program particularly with
those people in mind to coincide with the
dedication of the new buildings. Some 500
to 1,000 people are expected to attend.
Celebration is "primarily an alumni
affair," according to Bayer, although its
activities should have wider appeal and
include basically student affairs like Friday
night's dance.
In addition, Celebration is "away of
saying thanks to those who contributed
funds to the new Law School." Special
activities for major donors will be held
Thursday.
Bayer noted that Celebration is not the
usual dedication of a new law school."The
"traditional dedication is to have the
contractor hand over the buildings to the
Dean who gives it to the Board of
Directors," according to the assistant dean.

Instead, Celebration coincides with 20
class reunions and was designed to have
maximum alumni participation possible.
According to Bayer, "We wanted our
alumni to feel that this is still their law
school, even though it continues to
change."
The emphasis will therefore be on a
celebration of Stanford Law School's
tradition and history, as well as the new
buildings. In this vein, Celebration is an

official Bicentennial activity.
In particular, a pictorial history of the
Law School will be on display. In addition,
people who contributed to that history,
including former deans and professors will
be honored.
Similarly, the opening of the new school
was not designed, like some, as an
important jurisprudential event to which
the deans of all the law schools gather to

hear speeches by eminent jurists.
Except for alumni and former faculty,
no law school deans were invited. And
while United States Supreme Court Chief
Justice Warren Burger and Justice William
Rehnquist (a Stanford graduate) were
invited, as well as Justice Donald Wright of
the California Supreme Court (none of
whom could attend), the decision was
