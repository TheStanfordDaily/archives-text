# Ford Faces Protest as Dedication Begins
## 
### 
Ignoring the distant chanting of
demonstrators, President Gerald Ford
sounded a probable campaign theme of
"individual independence" from big
government in a speech to a large gathering
in front of the Arthur E. Cooley Courtyard
last Sunday.
Ford's speech, peppered with jokes
about his alma mater's 19-19 tie with the
Stanford football team, was received
politely but not enthusiastically by the
crowd of 8000. The speech was the first
official event in dedication ceremonies for
the new law school.
Stanford University President Richard
Lyman introduced Ford, who sat on a
podium with Lyman, Dean Thomas Ehrlich
and Waller Taylor, Chairman of the Law
School Board of Visitors and a personal
friend of Ford's.
"I see the great challenge of our next
hundred years as the advancement of
individual independence of specific steps
to safeguard the identity of each and every
American from the pressures of
conformity," Ford said.
"The pressures close in upon us from
many quarters massive government,
massive management, massive labor,

massive education, massive
communication, and massive acquisition of
information," the President continued.
"To meet this challenge, we still need a
positive and passionate commitment to
law, to learning, and to liberty. Here at
Stanford," he concluded, "you have all

three."
Demonstration
Ford's remarks were challenged by the
chants of several hundred protestors. The
demonstrators moved to a location
between Meyer Library and the Education
Building after holding a rally in White
Plaza.
The protest was organized by the People
Not Profits Coalition composed of the
Alliance for Radical Change, the Winter
Soldier Organization, the National
Lawyer's Guild, the Law School Civil
Rights Research Council and the Women's
International League for Peace and
Freedom.
Tim Cullinane, press spokesperson for
the Coalition, explained the purpose of the
rally as a protest against President Ford's
domestic and foreign policies.
One speaker, Lenny Siegel of the Pacific
Studies Center in Palo Alto, viewed Ford's
visit to the law school as especially
appropriate since "the people at Stanford
Law School stand for the same interests as
Ford."
The only reported incident involving
demonstrators and police was the alleged
