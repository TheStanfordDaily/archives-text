# Ford Faces Protest as Dedication Begins
## 
### 
Ignoring the distant chanting of
demonstrators, President Gerald Ford
sounded a probable campaign theme of
"individual independence" from big
government in a speech to a large gathering
in front of the Arthur E. Cooley Courtyard
last Sunday.
Ford's speech, peppered with jokes
about his alma mater's 19-19 tie with the
Stanford football team, was received
politely but not enthusiastically by the
crowd of 8000. The speech was the first
official event in dedication ceremonies for
the new law school.
Stanford University President Richard
Lyman introduced Ford, who sat on a
podium with Lyman, Dean Thomas Ehrlich
and Waller Taylor, Chairman of the Law
School Board of Visitors and a personal
friend of Ford's.
"I see the great challenge of our next
hundred years as the advancement of
individual independence of specific steps
to safeguard the identity of each and every
American from the pressures of
conformity," Ford said.
"The pressures close in upon us from
many quarters massive government,
massive management, massive labor,

massive education, massive
communication, and massive acquisition of
information," the President continued.
"To meet this challenge, we still need a
positive and passionate commitment to
law, to learning, and to liberty. Here at
Stanford," he concluded, "you have all

three."
Demonstration
Ford's remarks were challenged by the
chants of several hundred protestors. The
demonstrators moved to a location
between Meyer Library and the Education
Building after holding a rally in White
Plaza.
The protest was organized by the People
Not Profits Coalition composed of the
Alliance for Radical Change, the Winter
Soldier Organization, the National
Lawyer's Guild, the Law School Civil
Rights Research Council and the Women's
International League for Peace and
Freedom.
Tim Cullinane, press spokesperson for
the Coalition, explained the purpose of the
rally as a protest against President Ford's
domestic and foreign policies.
One speaker, Lenny Siegel of the Pacific
Studies Center in Palo Alto, viewed Ford's
visit to the law school as especially
appropriate since "the people at Stanford
Law School stand for the same interests as
Ford."
The only reported incident involving
demonstrators and police was the alleged


President Gerald Ford
confiscation of ten banners by thirty
officers of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office outside Columbae House Sunday
morning.
Ford later commented that he was not
disturbed by the hecklers. "I was only
speaking to the people who were
listening," he said. One White House source
noted that the demonstration was mild
compared to others Ford has faced.
Student Meeting
After delivery of his prepared remarks,
Ford met with twenty-four law school
students heads of the eighteen student
organizations and six first-year students
chosen at random in an "informal"
question-and-answer session.
According to a White House source, this
was the first meeting of its kind in which
Ford has participated since becoming
President.
The twenty-minute meeting covered
several topics ranging from busing to
women Supreme Court justices to the SLA.
In what was termed by one student a
"respectful" atmosphere with "some good
questions, but very general answers," Ford
refused to rule out the possibility that the
United States might participate in the
overthrow of a foreign government in the
future.
In answer to other questions, Ford
maintained that current federal aid is
sufficient to handle the problems of the
cities and that effective alternatives to
busing exist to achieve equal education.
Ford also said his administration has no
intention "to assist any Middle Eastern
countries in developing nuclear capability
or expertise."
When asked why American society
breeds such groups as the SLA, President
Ford, smoking his pipe, turned the
question back to the students for their
opinions. One student conjectured that
such groups might arise partially as a result
of alienation against a legal system which
fails to provide adequate legal services to
some segments of society.
Ford answered by noting that his
administration has appropriated "slightly
more" to legal aid than the last
administration. And, voicing a theme to
which he returned as he closed the session,

the President suggested that communities
and lawyers might benefit if graduates
from law school avoid large metropolitan
law firms and return to their hometowns to
start their own offices, as he did.
Petition
Despite the apparent festiveness of the
occasion, prompted by the large crowd and
the Cubberly High School Cougars Band
playing such tunes as "Hail to the Spirit of
Liberty," "Don't Rain on My Parade,"
and, as the motorcade approached, the
theme from Patton , Ford's visit was not
without controversy.
A petition protesting Ford
administration policies on the economy,
energy, the environment, military
spending, and the world hunger crisis was
signed by 217 Stanford Law School
students, representing 44 percent of the
student body.
The petition declared, "we are united in
the belief that your administration has
ignored or exacerbated our most pressing
national problems. Deep dissatisfaction
with your policies lies beneath the calm
and dignity of the occasion."
Sponsored by the Law Students Civil
Rights Research Council (LSCRRC) the
petition was handed to Ford by third-yar
student Larry Moss during the President's
meeting with students. Ford said that he
would read the petition carefully.
When asked why more students did not
sign the admittedly moderate statement,
LSCRRC member Casey McKeever cited a
lack of time, circulation difficulties (one
copy of the petition was apparently lost)
and "a pervasive feeling that signing the
petition entailed substantial risks of
retaliation from both the law school
administration and the government."
McKeever cited some examples of the
latter including the refusal of one student
organization head to sign despite his
agreement with the petition allegedly
because he feared a loss of administration
funds for his group.
Some students and faculty voiced
dissatisfaction with the selection of
President Ford as the featured dedication
speaker instead of, for example, an
eminent jurist.
Emalie Ortega, President of the Law
Association, indicated that if she had been
contacted about the possibility of inviting
Ford to Stanford she would have told the

planners that "law students would be more
pleased with a jurist of national
prominence."
"There were many students who did not
want the quiet and dignity of Celebration
to serve as tacit support of the President,"
said Ortega who indicated that she had
signed the Ford petition.
Professor Paul Brest voiced a similar
concern. "Had it been left to me, I would
not have thought the President would be a
particularly appropriate person to dedicate
a law school," Brest noted.
Brest emphasized that his dissatisfaction
was not with Gerald Ford as an individual.
"Someone more directly related to the
legal profession than a President would
have been more appropriate. Then again, I
guess queens go around dedicating things,"
he added.
Dean Thomas Ehrlich indicated that

Ford's office was precisely the reason he
was invited.
There was also some concern over the
apparent politicization of the Ford visit.
Although officially billed as a Presidential
speech, massive efforts were undertaken by
the Ford advance team to insure a large,
favorable turnout.
' The Ford team sent 3000 to 6000
invitations to local members of the Rotary
and Kiwanis clubs, the Chamber of
Commerce and known supporters of the
Republican Party. Upon hearing this,
Ehrlich arranged for additional invitations
to be distributed to Democratic groups and
others.
Normally the local organizers of
"nonpolitical" events handle the
invitations to functions attended by the
President.
"I don't think it was wise for them to
give invitations to any political
organization, including Republicans. Once
they did, we invited a lot of others,
including Democrats," Ehrlich explained.
"I certainly didn't want any implication
that this is a political event. The Law
School can't take a political stand on any
person or issue," the Dean continued.

Still, it is clear that School officials were
desirous of a large turnout. "We're
interested in seeing big crowds so Stanford
won't be embarrassed," said Lloyd
Lowrey, chairman of the Aiumni Fund.
There was even talk among some
members of the faculty about staying away
from the Ford speech because of its
politic ization.
Seating
Another problem facing law school
officials was the seating arrangement for
the Presidential speech.
Original plans called for the seating of
250 dignitaries, including faculty, trustees,
deans, local officials, and friends of the law
school. "These are the people who, for one
reason or another, are very important to
the School," explained Lowry.
"Next important to the Law School are
its students and staff," Lowrey continued,
and these were to be given a preferred
standing area behind the dignitaries.
Behind the students, but in front of the
general public, alumni were to be given a
reserved standing area.
As the number of dignitaries increased
from 250 to 325 and it became clear that
the press would require considerable space,
the standing area for students and staff was
pushed farther back and into a more
confined area.
Noting the situation, Dean Ehrlich asked
that additional seating be set up for
students, staff, and alumni, to the side of
and behind the dignitaries. "We tried to
give as much preference as possible to
students, considering all the other factors,"
Ehrlich commented.
Those who arrived at the speech early
appreciated the new seating arrangement.
But some students, staff and alumni had to
be turned away from the seating area and
others never knew it was available.
Ehrlich indicated that the opportunity
for student leaders to meet with Ford
compensated for the lack of priority
seating for students. "I think the most
important thing is to have students talk to
the President and let each of them hear
what's on the other's mind," Ehrlich said.
Ehrlich also insisted that the invitees of
the Ford advance team be treated like the
rest of the general public, rather than given
preferred standing or seating, as implied by
the special invitations.
-S.S.

We need a commitment to
law, learning and liberty. At
Stanford you have all three.'
