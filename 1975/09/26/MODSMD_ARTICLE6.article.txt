# Expanded Library Provides New Services
## 
### 
In tenns of numbers of books, Stanford
Law library may still fall towards the
bottom of the top 20, but according to
librarian J. Myron Jacobstein, it is "one of
the most pleasant libraries in the country."
Jacobstein, a national leader in the field
of legal bibliography and library science,
voices that opinion on the basis of visits to
most law school libraries in this country
built since 1950.
Jacobstein and Assistant Librarian in
charge of cataloguing Eosalee M. Long,
listed the following attributes as
improvements over the old library
facilities:
Spacious Setting
•There is now adequate space to house
the entire collection on open shelves
arranged in a "logical manner." This
compares to the old library where many
volumes were kept in a locked, unheated,
poorly lit and dusty annex.
•Just behind the main desk is an open
reserve room where the "most used" books
are kept, including hornbooks, CEB books
and others. This eliminates the necessity in
the old facility to charge out such books
from the desk. These open reserve books
may be used in the library for four hours at
a time.
•No longer will students have to sit two
and three (at a time) to a carrel. According
to Jacobstein the new library can
"comfortably seat 500 students, 350 in
carrels of special law school-oriented
design."
•Each area of the stacks representing a
particular field of legal study (say tax or
legal history) is surrounded by carrels or
chairs so that there is easy study access to
them.
•The library now meets and exceeds
standards as to seating and book capacity
set by the Association of American Law
Schools. This leads library officials to
expect an increased use of the facilities by
students, many of whom avoided the old
facilities.
"Now that students can see what we
actually have, they'll be much more likely
to use it," noted Assistant librarian Long.
Special Services
•There will now be a professional
librarian at the reference desk from Bto 10
on weekdays and during all hours on

Saturday. Previously such a librarian
worked only from 8 to 5 on weekdays.
•Adjacent to the open reserve room is a
microfilm and microform reading room
which allows access to briefs before the
Supreme Court, legislative history,
newspapers and out of print books.
While there were microfilm facilities
nominally available in the old building, one
had to use them while seated in the

hallway between the old law lounge, the
Pepsi machine and the women's restroom
— hardly ideal library conditions.
•The library now has a copy machine in
the open reserve room. Although it appears
to have a similar break-down frequency as
the copier in the old building, at least it is
in the library instead of one floor below in
the middle of a hallway.
Library officials noted a willingness to
install another machine as well, if there is
need for it. At present the lack of a
changer is the major drawback to the
copying facilities, although some change is
available at the desk.

•A table will hopefully arrive soon where
all legal indexes will be gathered so that the
initial research stage can be a one-step
affair.

•Two conference rooms on the first floor
are available for informal group meetings.
A key is available at the main desk. These
are the only spaces available during the
evening hours where students may gather
for study meetings and group sessions.
•Not directly related to the new building,
the library is expanding bibliographical
facilities available to students by tying into
computerized cataloguing systems available
elsewhere in the University.
•A new rare book room, enclosed in glass
will be opened soon where many old books
discovered during the move as well as a
copy of every volume written by members
of the Stanford Law Faculty will be
displayed.
In addition, a sixteenth century table
and a 100-inch clock grace the room, the
latter a result of the donor's move into an
apartment with 96-inch ceilings.
Set-Up
The library design incorporated
substantial input from Jacobstein and his
staff after the overall design of the building
was set.
"The theory is that the first and the
third floors are restricted to law student
use," according to Jacobstein.

There the bulk of and the most
comfortable carrels are located, leaving the
second floor areas with its collection of the
major legal reference books, statutes,
reporters and other well-used books for use
by all members of the University as well as
the local legal community.
This, of course, creates a potential
problem. As one second-year transfer
student remarked after a long but fruitless
search, "There's no reading room."
The carrels in the second floor area are
smaller and fewer in number than
elsewhere so that it is hardest to utilize the
most-used books near their shelf spaces.
The Library staff hopes to minimize this
problem created by the law student versus
general public design by allowing free use
of all books everywhere in the library with
a large reshelving staff.
(In addition, copies of all California
reporters and codes as well as United States
reports and codes may be found on every
floor at the end of the books shelved
there.)
Shelving
Each floor has a table near the stairs
where in-library use "bookmarks" should
be filled out.
"Our main desire is just that we know
where the books are at all times," noted
Jacobstein. "So long as we can find them,
the students are free to use them wherever
and as long as they need them anywhere in
the library."
The library has a staff member whose
sole responsibility is to supervise
reshelving, and Jacobstein noted that the
library goal is to have books completely
reshelved every two hours.
"The reshelving personnel," Long noted,
"will monitor carrels to see if books are
checked out." These personnel are
authorized to remove any book which is
not checked out or has been kept beyond
the check-out period from a carrel.
Schedule
If students have a consistent complaint
about the new library, it is that the hours
are too short, compared to the twenty-four
hour access available to the reading rooms

last year.
Jacobstein is quick to point out,
however, that the library is open "104"
(sic, it's only 101) hours a week, which is
as long or longer than at any other law
school library in the country.
"We lost convenience, but have to take
the energy crisis under consideration." In
fact, the librarian believes that University
officials would have insisted on reduced
hours anyway, given their complaints
about the energy use of the old library
which were significantly smaller than those
of the new one.
Staffing and security problems also
contributed to the decision to have shorter
hours. These latter problems, some
students suggest, could be avoided by
giving students keys to the library.
"If there is really a student demand,
we'll consider longer hours during exams,"
Jacobstein noted.
Security: The 5% Solution
The security system in the library
consists mainly of confining access to and
from the library to the second floor
entrance. (Contrary to the rumor, those
doors marked emergency exit are hooked
up to alarms as well as the lighting panel at
the main desk.)
In addition an electric eye will notify
library personnel at the main desk of
persons entering and leaving the open
reserve room, so that use of books from
that area can be controlled.
(On the other hand, the rumors that
books wrongly sneaked through the
electric eye will ring alarms at the desk
and/or at various law enforcement agencies
around the country are false, although
fingerprints may still be taken of anyone
caught with Prosser on Torts down his or
her pants.)
Actually the library staff has a definite
policy of maintaining "open and
accessible" facilities, according to
Jacobstein. "Ninety-five percent security is
our goal. It worked in the old building, so
why not here," he asked.
While stop-and-frisk is standard
operating procedure at some law libraries,
Long noted, "the more obstacles you put
up, the more people will try to get around
them."
In sum, Long noted, "its really amazing
how few books we lose — permanently.
They disappear for a time and then show
up."

Still Insufficient
Despite the current optimisim about the
new facilities, the library is still a potential
weak spot at the law school. Stanford's law
library ranks only nineteenth in number of
volumes with 227,740 as of late August
However, this may be misleading, given
the low utility, for example, of the nearly
complete set of Persian and Siamese law
books which make up some of Harvards IV2
million volumes.
"If Yale School suddenly closed ("a
boon to legal education") and gave away
their collection," Jacobstein quipped,
"there are only 40,000 volumes I'd want to
complete our collection."
Stressing quality over quantity, the
library staff still admits that those 40,000
volumes at least are needed to support the
research and writing of faculty and
students.
Over the past years, there has been an
increase of 9500 volumes per year.
"The Dean [Ehrlich] and I are keenly
aware of this problem," Jacobstein noted.
"Our goal is an increase of 12,000 books
per year."
Noting some validity to the direct
correlation between the size of the law
library and the rating of law schools,
Jacobstein 1 remains committed to
upgrading the quality of Crown Law
Library's collection while concentrating
much less on its quantity.
"In my considered opinion, we do not
need a million and a half books," he said.

need for it. At present the lack of a

copying facilities, although some change is
available at the desk.

Set-Up
The library design incorporated
substantial input from Jacobstein and his
staff after the overall design of the building
was set.
"The theory is that the first and the
third floors are restricted to law student
use," according to Jacobstein.

There the bulk of and the most
comfortable carrels are located, leaving the
second floor areas with its collection of the
major legal reference books, statutes,
reporters and other well-used books for use
by all members of the University as well as
the local legal community.
This, of course, creates a potential
problem. As one second-year transfer
student remarked after a long but fruitless
search, "There's no reading room."
The carrels in the second floor area are
smaller and fewer in number than
elsewhere so that it is hardest to utilize the
most-used books near their shelf spaces.
The Library staff hopes to minimize this
problem created by the law student versus
general public design by allowing free use
of all books everywhere in the library with
a large reshelving staff.
(In addition, copies of all California
reporters and codes as well as United States
reports and codes may be found on every
floor at the end of the books shelved
there.)
Shelving
Each floor has a table near the stairs
where in-library use "bookmarks" should
be filled out.
"Our main desire is just that we know
where the books are at all times," noted
Jacobstein. "So long as we can find them,
the students are free to use them wherever
and as long as they need them anywhere in
the library."
The library has a staff member whose
sole responsibility is to supervise
reshelving, and Jacobstein noted that the
library goal is to have books completely
reshelved every two hours.
"The reshelving personnel," Long noted,
"will monitor carrels to see if books are
checked out." These personnel are
authorized to remove any book which is
not checked out or has been kept beyond
the check-out period from a carrel.
Schedule
If students have a consistent complaint
about the new library, it is that the hours
are too short, compared to the twenty-four
hour access available to the reading rooms

last year.
Jacobstein is quick to point out,
however, that the library is open "104"
(sic, it's only 101) hours a week, which is
as long or longer than at any other law
school library in the country.
"We lost convenience, but have to take
the energy crisis under consideration." In
fact, the librarian believes that University
officials would have insisted on reduced
hours anyway, given their complaints
about the energy use of the old library
which were significantly smaller than those
of the new one.
Staffing and security problems also
contributed to the decision to have shorter
hours. These latter problems, some
students suggest, could be avoided by
giving students keys to the library.
"If there is really a student demand,
we'll consider longer hours during exams,"
Jacobstein noted.
Security: The 5% Solution
The security system in the library
consists mainly of confining access to and
from the library to the second floor
entrance. (Contrary to the rumor, those
doors marked emergency exit are hooked
up to alarms as well as the lighting panel at
the main desk.)
In addition an electric eye will notify
library personnel at the main desk of
persons entering and leaving the open
reserve room, so that use of books from
that area can be controlled.
(On the other hand, the rumors that
books wrongly sneaked through the
electric eye will ring alarms at the desk
and/or at various law enforcement agencies
around the country are false, although
fingerprints may still be taken of anyone
caught with Prosser on Torts down his or
her pants.)
Actually the library staff has a definite
policy of maintaining "open and
accessible" facilities, according to
Jacobstein. "Ninety-five percent security is
our goal. It worked in the old building, so
why not here," he asked.
While stop-and-frisk is standard
operating procedure at some law libraries,
Long noted, "the more obstacles you put
up, the more people will try to get around
them."
In sum, Long noted, "its really amazing
how few books we lose — permanently.
They disappear for a time and then show
up."

Still Insufficient
Despite the current optimisim about the
new facilities, the library is still a potential
weak spot at the law school. Stanford's law
library ranks only nineteenth in number of
volumes with 227,740 as of late August
However, this may be misleading, given
the low utility, for example, of the nearly
complete set of Persian and Siamese law
books which make up some of Harvards IV2
million volumes.
"If Yale School suddenly closed ("a
boon to legal education") and gave away
their collection," Jacobstein quipped,
"there are only 40,000 volumes I'd want to
complete our collection."
Stressing quality over quantity, the
library staff still admits that those 40,000
volumes at least are needed to support the
research and writing of faculty and
students.
Over the past years, there has been an
increase of 9500 volumes per year.
"The Dean [Ehrlich] and I are keenly
aware of this problem," Jacobstein noted.
"Our goal is an increase of 12,000 books
per year."
Noting some validity to the direct
correlation between the size of the law
library and the rating of law schools,
Jacobstein 1 remains committed to
upgrading the quality of Crown Law
Library's collection while concentrating
much less on its quantity.
"In my considered opinion, we do not
need a million and a half books," he said.

Librarian Myron Jacobstein
In tenns of numbers of books, Stanford
Law library may still fall towards the
bottom of the top 20, but according to
librarian J. Myron Jacobstein, it is "one of
the most pleasant libraries in the country."
Jacobstein, a national leader in the field
of legal bibliography and library science,
voices that opinion on the basis of visits to
most law school libraries in this country
built since 1950.
Jacobstein and Assistant Librarian in
charge of cataloguing Eosalee M. Long,
listed the following attributes as
improvements over the old library
facilities:
Spacious Setting
•There is now adequate space to house
the entire collection on open shelves
arranged in a "logical manner." This
compares to the old library where many
volumes were kept in a locked, unheated,
poorly lit and dusty annex.
•Just behind the main desk is an open
reserve room where the "most used" books
are kept, including hornbooks, CEB books
and others. This eliminates the necessity in
the old facility to charge out such books
from the desk. These open reserve books
may be used in the library for four hours at
a time.
•No longer will students have to sit two
and three (at a time) to a carrel. According
to Jacobstein the new library can
"comfortably seat 500 students, 350 in
carrels of special law school-oriented
design."
•Each area of the stacks representing a
particular field of legal study (say tax or
legal history) is surrounded by carrels or
chairs so that there is easy study access to
them.
•The library now meets and exceeds
standards as to seating and book capacity
set by the Association of American Law
Schools. This leads library officials to
expect an increased use of the facilities by
students, many of whom avoided the old
facilities.
"Now that students can see what we
actually have, they'll be much more likely
to use it," noted Assistant librarian Long.
Special Services
•There will now be a professional
librarian at the reference desk from Bto 10
on weekdays and during all hours on

Saturday. Previously such a librarian
worked only from 8 to 5 on weekdays.
•Adjacent to the open reserve room is a
microfilm and microform reading room
which allows access to briefs before the
Supreme Court, legislative history,
newspapers and out of print books.
While there were microfilm facilities
nominally available in the old building, one
had to use them while seated in the

hallway between the old law lounge, the
Pepsi machine and the women's restroom
— hardly ideal library conditions.
•The library now has a copy machine in
the open reserve room. Although it appears
to have a similar break-down frequency as
the copier in the old building, at least it is
in the library instead of one floor below in
the middle of a hallway.
Library officials noted a willingness to
install another machine as well, if there is
need for it. At present the lack of a
changer is the major drawback to the
copying facilities, although some change is
available at the desk.

"will monitor carrels to see if books are
checked out." These personnel are
authorized to remove any book which is
not checked out or has been kept beyond
the check-out period from a carrel.
Schedule
If students have a consistent complaint
about the new library, it is that the hours
are too short, compared to the twenty-four
hour access available to the reading rooms

last year.
Jacobstein is quick to point out,
however, that the library is open "104"
(sic, it's only 101) hours a week, which is
as long or longer than at any other law
school library in the country.
"We lost convenience, but have to take
the energy crisis under consideration." In
fact, the librarian believes that University
officials would have insisted on reduced
hours anyway, given their complaints
about the energy use of the old library
which were significantly smaller than those
of the new one.
Staffing and security problems also
contributed to the decision to have shorter
hours. These latter problems, some
students suggest, could be avoided by
giving students keys to the library.
"If there is really a student demand,
we'll consider longer hours during exams,"
Jacobstein noted.
Security: The 5% Solution
The security system in the library
consists mainly of confining access to and
from the library to the second floor
entrance. (Contrary to the rumor, those
doors marked emergency exit are hooked
up to alarms as well as the lighting panel at
the main desk.)
In addition an electric eye will notify
library personnel at the main desk of
persons entering and leaving the open
reserve room, so that use of books from
that area can be controlled.
(On the other hand, the rumors that
books wrongly sneaked through the
electric eye will ring alarms at the desk
and/or at various law enforcement agencies
around the country are false, although
fingerprints may still be taken of anyone
caught with Prosser on Torts down his or
her pants.)
Actually the library staff has a definite
policy of maintaining "open and
accessible" facilities, according to
Jacobstein. "Ninety-five percent security is
our goal. It worked in the old building, so
why not here," he asked.
While stop-and-frisk is standard
operating procedure at some law libraries,
Long noted, "the more obstacles you put
up, the more people will try to get around
them."
In sum, Long noted, "its really amazing
how few books we lose — permanently.
They disappear for a time and then show
up."

Still Insufficient
Despite the current optimisim about the
new facilities, the library is still a potential
weak spot at the law school. Stanford's law
library ranks only nineteenth in number of
volumes with 227,740 as of late August
However, this may be misleading, given
the low utility, for example, of the nearly
complete set of Persian and Siamese law
books which make up some of Harvards IV2
million volumes.
"If Yale School suddenly closed ("a
boon to legal education") and gave away
their collection," Jacobstein quipped,
"there are only 40,000 volumes I'd want to
complete our collection."
Stressing quality over quantity, the
library staff still admits that those 40,000
volumes at least are needed to support the
research and writing of faculty and
students.
Over the past years, there has been an
increase of 9500 volumes per year.
"The Dean [Ehrlich] and I are keenly
aware of this problem," Jacobstein noted.
"Our goal is an increase of 12,000 books
per year."
Noting some validity to the direct
correlation between the size of the law
library and the rating of law schools,
Jacobstein 1 remains committed to
upgrading the quality of Crown Law
Library's collection while concentrating
much less on its quantity.
"In my considered opinion, we do not
need a million and a half books," he said.

Librarian Myron Jacobstein
In tenns of numbers of books, Stanford
Law library may still fall towards the
bottom of the top 20, but according to
librarian J. Myron Jacobstein, it is "one of
the most pleasant libraries in the country."
Jacobstein, a national leader in the field
of legal bibliography and library science,
voices that opinion on the basis of visits to
most law school libraries in this country
built since 1950.
Jacobstein and Assistant Librarian in
charge of cataloguing Eosalee M. Long,
listed the following attributes as
improvements over the old library
facilities:
Spacious Setting
•There is now adequate space to house
the entire collection on open shelves
arranged in a "logical manner." This
compares to the old library where many
volumes were kept in a locked, unheated,
poorly lit and dusty annex.
•Just behind the main desk is an open
reserve room where the "most used" books
are kept, including hornbooks, CEB books
and others. This eliminates the necessity in
the old facility to charge out such books
from the desk. These open reserve books
may be used in the library for four hours at
a time.
•No longer will students have to sit two
and three (at a time) to a carrel. According
to Jacobstein the new library can
"comfortably seat 500 students, 350 in
carrels of special law school-oriented
design."
•Each area of the stacks representing a
particular field of legal study (say tax or
legal history) is surrounded by carrels or
chairs so that there is easy study access to
them.
•The library now meets and exceeds
standards as to seating and book capacity
set by the Association of American Law
Schools. This leads library officials to
expect an increased use of the facilities by
students, many of whom avoided the old
facilities.
"Now that students can see what we
actually have, they'll be much more likely
to use it," noted Assistant librarian Long.
Special Services
•There will now be a professional
librarian at the reference desk from Bto 10
on weekdays and during all hours on

Saturday. Previously such a librarian
worked only from 8 to 5 on weekdays.
•Adjacent to the open reserve room is a
microfilm and microform reading room
which allows access to briefs before the
Supreme Court, legislative history,
newspapers and out of print books.
While there were microfilm facilities
nominally available in the old building, one
had to use them while seated in the

hallway between the old law lounge, the
Pepsi machine and the women's restroom
— hardly ideal library conditions.
•The library now has a copy machine in
the open reserve room. Although it appears
to have a similar break-down frequency as
the copier in the old building, at least it is
in the library instead of one floor below in
the middle of a hallway.
Library officials noted a willingness to
install another machine as well, if there is
need for it. At present the lack of a
changer is the major drawback to the
copying facilities, although some change is
available at the desk.

•A table will hopefully arrive soon where
all legal indexes will be gathered so that the
initial research stage can be a one-step
affair.

•Two conference rooms on the first floor
are available for informal group meetings.
A key is available at the main desk. These
are the only spaces available during the
evening hours where students may gather
for study meetings and group sessions.
•Not directly related to the new building,
the library is expanding bibliographical
facilities available to students by tying into
computerized cataloguing systems available
elsewhere in the University.
•A new rare book room, enclosed in glass
will be opened soon where many old books
discovered during the move as well as a
copy of every volume written by members
of the Stanford Law Faculty will be
displayed.
In addition, a sixteenth century table
and a 100-inch clock grace the room, the
latter a result of the donor's move into an
apartment with 96-inch ceilings.
Set-Up
The library design incorporated
substantial input from Jacobstein and his
staff after the overall design of the building
was set.
"The theory is that the first and the
third floors are restricted to law student
use," according to Jacobstein.

There the bulk of and the most
comfortable carrels are located, leaving the
second floor areas with its collection of the
major legal reference books, statutes,
reporters and other well-used books for use
by all members of the University as well as
the local legal community.
This, of course, creates a potential
problem. As one second-year transfer
student remarked after a long but fruitless
search, "There's no reading room."
The carrels in the second floor area are
smaller and fewer in number than
elsewhere so that it is hardest to utilize the
most-used books near their shelf spaces.
The Library staff hopes to minimize this
problem created by the law student versus
general public design by allowing free use
of all books everywhere in the library with
a large reshelving staff.
(In addition, copies of all California
reporters and codes as well as United States
reports and codes may be found on every
floor at the end of the books shelved
there.)
Shelving
Each floor has a table near the stairs
where in-library use "bookmarks" should
be filled out.
"Our main desire is just that we know
where the books are at all times," noted
Jacobstein. "So long as we can find them,
the students are free to use them wherever
and as long as they need them anywhere in
the library."
The library has a staff member whose
sole responsibility is to supervise
reshelving, and Jacobstein noted that the
library goal is to have books completely
reshelved every two hours.
"The reshelving personnel," Long noted,
"will monitor carrels to see if books are
checked out." These personnel are
authorized to remove any book which is
not checked out or has been kept beyond
the check-out period from a carrel.

books which make up some of Harvards IV2
million volumes.
"If Yale School suddenly closed ("a
boon to legal education") and gave away
their collection," Jacobstein quipped,
"there are only 40,000 volumes I'd want to
complete our collection."
Stressing quality over quantity, the
library staff still admits that those 40,000
volumes at least are needed to support the
research and writing of faculty and
students.
Over the past years, there has been an
increase of 9500 volumes per year.
"The Dean [Ehrlich] and I are keenly
aware of this problem," Jacobstein noted.
"Our goal is an increase of 12,000 books
per year."
Noting some validity to the direct
correlation between the size of the law
library and the rating of law schools,
Jacobstein 1 remains committed to
upgrading the quality of Crown Law
Library's collection while concentrating
much less on its quantity.
"In my considered opinion, we do not
need a million and a half books," he said.

Librarian Myron Jacobstein
In tenns of numbers of books, Stanford
Law library may still fall towards the
bottom of the top 20, but according to
librarian J. Myron Jacobstein, it is "one of
the most pleasant libraries in the country."
Jacobstein, a national leader in the field
of legal bibliography and library science,
voices that opinion on the basis of visits to
most law school libraries in this country
built since 1950.
Jacobstein and Assistant Librarian in
charge of cataloguing Eosalee M. Long,
listed the following attributes as
improvements over the old library
facilities:
Spacious Setting
•There is now adequate space to house
the entire collection on open shelves
arranged in a "logical manner." This
compares to the old library where many
volumes were kept in a locked, unheated,
poorly lit and dusty annex.
•Just behind the main desk is an open
reserve room where the "most used" books
are kept, including hornbooks, CEB books
and others. This eliminates the necessity in
the old facility to charge out such books
from the desk. These open reserve books
may be used in the library for four hours at
a time.
•No longer will students have to sit two
and three (at a time) to a carrel. According
to Jacobstein the new library can
"comfortably seat 500 students, 350 in
carrels of special law school-oriented
design."
•Each area of the stacks representing a
particular field of legal study (say tax or
legal history) is surrounded by carrels or
chairs so that there is easy study access to
them.
•The library now meets and exceeds
standards as to seating and book capacity
set by the Association of American Law
Schools. This leads library officials to
expect an increased use of the facilities by
students, many of whom avoided the old
facilities.
"Now that students can see what we
actually have, they'll be much more likely
to use it," noted Assistant librarian Long.
Special Services
•There will now be a professional
librarian at the reference desk from Bto 10
on weekdays and during all hours on

Saturday. Previously such a librarian
worked only from 8 to 5 on weekdays.
•Adjacent to the open reserve room is a
microfilm and microform reading room
which allows access to briefs before the
Supreme Court, legislative history,
newspapers and out of print books.
While there were microfilm facilities
nominally available in the old building, one
had to use them while seated in the

hallway between the old law lounge, the
Pepsi machine and the women's restroom
— hardly ideal library conditions.
•The library now has a copy machine in
the open reserve room. Although it appears
to have a similar break-down frequency as
the copier in the old building, at least it is
in the library instead of one floor below in
the middle of a hallway.
Library officials noted a willingness to
install another machine as well, if there is
need for it. At present the lack of a
changer is the major drawback to the
copying facilities, although some change is
available at the desk.

•A table will hopefully arrive soon where
all legal indexes will be gathered so that the
initial research stage can be a one-step
affair.

•Two conference rooms on the first floor
are available for informal group meetings.
A key is available at the main desk. These
are the only spaces available during the
evening hours where students may gather
for study meetings and group sessions.
•Not directly related to the new building,
the library is expanding bibliographical
facilities available to students by tying into
computerized cataloguing systems available
elsewhere in the University.
•A new rare book room, enclosed in glass
will be opened soon where many old books
discovered during the move as well as a
copy of every volume written by members
of the Stanford Law Faculty will be
displayed.
In addition, a sixteenth century table
and a 100-inch clock grace the room, the
latter a result of the donor's move into an
apartment with 96-inch ceilings.
Set-Up
The library design incorporated
substantial input from Jacobstein and his
staff after the overall design of the building
was set.
"The theory is that the first and the
third floors are restricted to law student
use," according to Jacobstein.

There the bulk of and the most
comfortable carrels are located, leaving the
second floor areas with its collection of the
major legal reference books, statutes,
reporters and other well-used books for use
by all members of the University as well as
the local legal community.
This, of course, creates a potential
problem. As one second-year transfer
student remarked after a long but fruitless
search, "There's no reading room."
The carrels in the second floor area are
smaller and fewer in number than
elsewhere so that it is hardest to utilize the
most-used books near their shelf spaces.
The Library staff hopes to minimize this
problem created by the law student versus
general public design by allowing free use
of all books everywhere in the library with
a large reshelving staff.
(In addition, copies of all California
reporters and codes as well as United States
reports and codes may be found on every
floor at the end of the books shelved
there.)
Shelving
Each floor has a table near the stairs
where in-library use "bookmarks" should
be filled out.
"Our main desire is just that we know
where the books are at all times," noted
Jacobstein. "So long as we can find them,
the students are free to use them wherever
and as long as they need them anywhere in
the library."
The library has a staff member whose
sole responsibility is to supervise
reshelving, and Jacobstein noted that the
library goal is to have books completely
reshelved every two hours.
"The reshelving personnel," Long noted,
"will monitor carrels to see if books are
checked out." These personnel are
authorized to remove any book which is
not checked out or has been kept beyond
the check-out period from a carrel.
Schedule
If students have a consistent complaint
about the new library, it is that the hours
are too short, compared to the twenty-four
hour access available to the reading rooms

last year.
Jacobstein is quick to point out,
however, that the library is open "104"
(sic, it's only 101) hours a week, which is
as long or longer than at any other law
school library in the country.
"We lost convenience, but have to take
the energy crisis under consideration." In
fact, the librarian believes that University
officials would have insisted on reduced
hours anyway, given their complaints
about the energy use of the old library
which were significantly smaller than those
of the new one.
Staffing and security problems also
contributed to the decision to have shorter
hours. These latter problems, some
students suggest, could be avoided by
giving students keys to the library.
"If there is really a student demand,
we'll consider longer hours during exams,"
Jacobstein noted.
Security: The 5% Solution
The security system in the library
consists mainly of confining access to and
from the library to the second floor
entrance. (Contrary to the rumor, those
doors marked emergency exit are hooked
up to alarms as well as the lighting panel at
the main desk.)
In addition an electric eye will notify
library personnel at the main desk of
persons entering and leaving the open
reserve room, so that use of books from
that area can be controlled.
(On the other hand, the rumors that
books wrongly sneaked through the
electric eye will ring alarms at the desk
and/or at various law enforcement agencies
around the country are false, although
fingerprints may still be taken of anyone
caught with Prosser on Torts down his or
her pants.)
Actually the library staff has a definite
policy of maintaining "open and
accessible" facilities, according to
Jacobstein. "Ninety-five percent security is
our goal. It worked in the old building, so
why not here," he asked.
While stop-and-frisk is standard
operating procedure at some law libraries,
Long noted, "the more obstacles you put
up, the more people will try to get around
them."
In sum, Long noted, "its really amazing
how few books we lose — permanently.
They disappear for a time and then show
up."

Still Insufficient
Despite the current optimisim about the
new facilities, the library is still a potential
weak spot at the law school. Stanford's law
library ranks only nineteenth in number of
volumes with 227,740 as of late August
However, this may be misleading, given
the low utility, for example, of the nearly
complete set of Persian and Siamese law
books which make up some of Harvards IV2
million volumes.
"If Yale School suddenly closed ("a
boon to legal education") and gave away

expect an increased use of the facilities by
students, many of whom avoided the old
facilities.
"Now that students can see what we
actually have, they'll be much more likely
to use it," noted Assistant librarian Long.
Special Services
•There will now be a professional
librarian at the reference desk from Bto 10
on weekdays and during all hours on

Saturday. Previously such a librarian
worked only from 8 to 5 on weekdays.
•Adjacent to the open reserve room is a
microfilm and microform reading room
which allows access to briefs before the
Supreme Court, legislative history,
newspapers and out of print books.
While there were microfilm facilities
nominally available in the old building, one
had to use them while seated in the

hallway between the old law lounge, the
Pepsi machine and the women's restroom
— hardly ideal library conditions.
•The library now has a copy machine in
the open reserve room. Although it appears
to have a similar break-down frequency as
the copier in the old building, at least it is
in the library instead of one floor below in
the middle of a hallway.
Library officials noted a willingness to
install another machine as well, if there is
need for it. At present the lack of a
changer is the major drawback to the
copying facilities, although some change is
available at the desk.

•A table will hopefully arrive soon where
all legal indexes will be gathered so that the
initial research stage can be a one-step
affair.

•Two conference rooms on the first floor
are available for informal group meetings.
A key is available at the main desk. These
are the only spaces available during the
evening hours where students may gather
for study meetings and group sessions.
•Not directly related to the new building,
the library is expanding bibliographical
facilities available to students by tying into
computerized cataloguing systems available
elsewhere in the University.
•A new rare book room, enclosed in glass
will be opened soon where many old books
discovered during the move as well as a
copy of every volume written by members
of the Stanford Law Faculty will be
displayed.
In addition, a sixteenth century table
and a 100-inch clock grace the room, the
latter a result of the donor's move into an
apartment with 96-inch ceilings.
Set-Up
The library design incorporated
substantial input from Jacobstein and his
staff after the overall design of the building
was set.
"The theory is that the first and the
third floors are restricted to law student
use," according to Jacobstein.

There the bulk of and the most
comfortable carrels are located, leaving the
second floor areas with its collection of the
major legal reference books, statutes,
reporters and other well-used books for use
by all members of the University as well as
the local legal community.
This, of course, creates a potential
problem. As one second-year transfer
student remarked after a long but fruitless
search, "There's no reading room."
The carrels in the second floor area are
smaller and fewer in number than
elsewhere so that it is hardest to utilize the
most-used books near their shelf spaces.
The Library staff hopes to minimize this
problem created by the law student versus
general public design by allowing free use
of all books everywhere in the library with
a large reshelving staff.
(In addition, copies of all California
reporters and codes as well as United States
reports and codes may be found on every
floor at the end of the books shelved
there.)
Shelving
Each floor has a table near the stairs
where in-library use "bookmarks" should
be filled out.
"Our main desire is just that we know
where the books are at all times," noted
Jacobstein. "So long as we can find them,
the students are free to use them wherever
and as long as they need them anywhere in
the library."
The library has a staff member whose
sole responsibility is to supervise
reshelving, and Jacobstein noted that the
library goal is to have books completely
reshelved every two hours.
"The reshelving personnel," Long noted,
"will monitor carrels to see if books are
checked out." These personnel are
authorized to remove any book which is
not checked out or has been kept beyond
the check-out period from a carrel.
Schedule
If students have a consistent complaint
about the new library, it is that the hours
are too short, compared to the twenty-four
hour access available to the reading rooms

last year.
Jacobstein is quick to point out,
however, that the library is open "104"
(sic, it's only 101) hours a week, which is
as long or longer than at any other law
school library in the country.
"We lost convenience, but have to take
the energy crisis under consideration." In
fact, the librarian believes that University
officials would have insisted on reduced
hours anyway, given their complaints
about the energy use of the old library
which were significantly smaller than those
of the new one.
Staffing and security problems also
contributed to the decision to have shorter
hours. These latter problems, some
students suggest, could be avoided by
giving students keys to the library.
"If there is really a student demand,
we'll consider longer hours during exams,"
Jacobstein noted.
Security: The 5% Solution
The security system in the library
consists mainly of confining access to and
from the library to the second floor
entrance. (Contrary to the rumor, those
doors marked emergency exit are hooked
up to alarms as well as the lighting panel at
the main desk.)
In addition an electric eye will notify
library personnel at the main desk of
persons entering and leaving the open
reserve room, so that use of books from
that area can be controlled.
(On the other hand, the rumors that
books wrongly sneaked through the
electric eye will ring alarms at the desk
and/or at various law enforcement agencies
around the country are false, although
fingerprints may still be taken of anyone
caught with Prosser on Torts down his or
her pants.)
Actually the library staff has a definite
policy of maintaining "open and
accessible" facilities, according to
Jacobstein. "Ninety-five percent security is
our goal. It worked in the old building, so
why not here," he asked.
While stop-and-frisk is standard
operating procedure at some law libraries,
Long noted, "the more obstacles you put
up, the more people will try to get around
them."
In sum, Long noted, "its really amazing
how few books we lose — permanently.
They disappear for a time and then show
up."

Still Insufficient
Despite the current optimisim about the
new facilities, the library is still a potential
weak spot at the law school. Stanford's law
library ranks only nineteenth in number of
volumes with 227,740 as of late August
However, this may be misleading, given
the low utility, for example, of the nearly
complete set of Persian and Siamese law
books which make up some of Harvards IV2
million volumes.
"If Yale School suddenly closed ("a
boon to legal education") and gave away
their collection," Jacobstein quipped,
"there are only 40,000 volumes I'd want to
complete our collection."
Stressing quality over quantity, the
library staff still admits that those 40,000
volumes at least are needed to support the
research and writing of faculty and
students.
Over the past years, there has been an
increase of 9500 volumes per year.
"The Dean [Ehrlich] and I are keenly
aware of this problem," Jacobstein noted.
"Our goal is an increase of 12,000 books
per year."
Noting some validity to the direct
correlation between the size of the law
library and the rating of law schools,
Jacobstein 1 remains committed to
upgrading the quality of Crown Law
Library's collection while concentrating
much less on its quantity.
"In my considered opinion, we do not
need a million and a half books," he said.
