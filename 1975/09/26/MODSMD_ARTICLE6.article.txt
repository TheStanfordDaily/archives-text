# Expanded Library Provides New Services

In tenns of numbers of books, Stanford
Law library may still fall towards the
bottom of the top 20, but according to
librarian J. Myron Jacobstein, it is "one of
the most pleasant libraries in the country."
Jacobstein, a national leader in the field
of legal bibliography and library science,
voices that opinion on the basis of visits to
most law school libraries in this country
built since 1950.
Jacobstein and Assistant Librarian in
charge of cataloguing Eosalee M. Long,
listed the following attributes as
improvements over the old library
facilities:
Spacious Setting
•There is now adequate space to house
the entire collection on open shelves
arranged in a "logical manner." This
compares to the old library where many
volumes were kept in a locked, unheated,
poorly lit and dusty annex.
•Just behind the main desk is an open
reserve room where the "most used" books
are kept, including hornbooks, CEB books
and others. This eliminates the necessity in
the old facility to charge out such books
from the desk. These open reserve books
may be used in the library for four hours at
a time.
•No longer will students have to sit two
and three (at a time) to a carrel. According
to Jacobstein the new library can
"comfortably seat 500 students, 350 in
carrels of special law school-oriented
design."
•Each area of the stacks representing a
particular field of legal study (say tax or
legal history) is surrounded by carrels or
chairs so that there is easy study access to
them.
•The library now meets and exceeds
standards as to seating and book capacity
set by the Association of American Law
Schools. This leads library officials to
expect an increased use of the facilities by
students, many of whom avoided the old
facilities.
"Now that students can see what we
actually have, they'll be much more likely
to use it," noted Assistant librarian Long.
Special Services
•There will now be a professional
librarian at the reference desk from Bto 10
on weekdays and during all hours on

Saturday. Previously such a librarian
worked only from 8 to 5 on weekdays.
•Adjacent to the open reserve room is a
microfilm and microform reading room
which allows access to briefs before the
Supreme Court, legislative history,
newspapers and out of print books.
While there were microfilm facilities
nominally available in the old building, one
had to use them while seated in the
