# Artwork Adds Variety to New Facilities
## 
### 
"Good art enriches the lives of the
people who experience it, often in subtle
ways. There is no reason why the insides of
the law school should be visually narrow
and confining."
Thus did Professor John Merryman
explain the philosophy behind efforts to
obtain and display distinguished art in the
law school. Merryman, chairman since
1964 of the physical plant committee for
the new school, has personally spent many
hours in acquiring the law school's art
collection.
The three sculptures, six paintings, and
thirty-one lithographs presently on display
in the new buildings are all gifts or loans to
the school, the Law School's only
expenditures having been for freight,
hanging, and related items.
Four pieces, the Robert Motherwell oil
and collage in the main lobby, the Ludwig
Sander painting in Dean Ehrlich's outer
office, the San Francis silkscreen print in
the Herbert Packer Faculty Reading Room,
and the Carla Lavatelli sculpture in the
Crocker Garden are permanent. All the
remaining pieces are on loan.
The largest number of works is on loan
from Gemini G.E.L. of Los Angeles, the
most important of the few shops in the
U.S. where leading artists work with master
printers to make fine prints. Gemini prints
are in limited editions, from as few as eight
or 10 up to 125.
When Gemini produces a lithograph, it
retains the first three copies for use in
travelling exhibitions. Normally Gemini
only lends such prints for a period of three
months, but the thirty pieces on display at
the law school will remain here two years.

In Celebration
Merryman refused to single out any of
the art as his personal favorites, but certain
of the pieces stand out. The sculpture in
the front courtyard, entitled Four Square,
was created by Dame Barbara Hepworth of
England and is on loan from the Norton
Simon Foundation for two years.
The sculpture on display was formerly
the centerpiece at the U.C.L.A. sculpture
garden. It is one of only four castings from
the original mold. Hepworth, awarded the
tile Dame of the British Empire because of
her distinguished work as a sculptress, died
in a fire in her studio in Cornwall just one
week after her sculpture was installed at
the Law School.

The Motherwell oil and collage in the
main foyer, entitled "In Celebration," was
commissioned by Richard Lang, J.D. '29,
to commemorate completion of the new
law school buildings.
Robert Motherwell, acclaimed by art

critic Frank O'Hare as "one of the leading
figures in the greatest revolution in modern
art since cubism, abstract expressionism,"
graduated from Stanford with an A.B. in
philosophy in 1936.
The piece directly across from the
Motherwell, entitled Bood, is polyester
paint on fiberglas by Tom Holland. Its
subtlety and overall composition furnish an
interesting contrast to the bold color and
imagery of the Motherwell oil and collage,
according to Merryman.
The Holland Painting is one of four lent
to the Law School by Nicholas Wilder, a
respected art dealer in Los Angeles. Wilder,
a Stanford undergraduate, attended the
Law School for a short time.
Distinguished Art
Merryman said that the Law School was
discriminating in deciding what pieces of
art would be displayed. A number of offers
of art were declined, according to
Merryman.
"There is enough bad and uninteresting
artwork around without bringing it to the
Law School. What we've tried to hang is
work that is distinguished. These are
splendid buildings. It would be a shame to
paste the walls with schlock art,"
Merryman explained.
He continued, "Where you spend your
time has an effect on the way you act and
who you are. We are lucky to live with
quality architecture and art."
The presence of such valuable art in the
law school naturally raises the question of
security for prevention of theft and
vandalism.
Merryman maintained that there is no
relationship between the art and tight
security measures in the law school
buildings. "The presence of art in the
buildings should enhance, not restrict or
distort the life of the school. We'll pack up
the art and send it back if it ever impairs
the running of the law school," Merryman
noted.
Merryman emphasized that these piece
of art are not marketable since each one is
numbered or is unique.
Future Plans
There are no plans for adding to the law
school's art collection at the present time.
However, Merryman would eventually like
to see more vacant walls filled with
artwork.
"I hope the habit of having good things
on the walls will continue," Merryman said
when asked what would happen after the
pieces are sent back to their owners. For
this purpose a small fund is being
accumulated through the sale of the
Motherwell Celebration prints.
The policy of not making expenditures
for purchasing artwork will continue,
however, with money from the fund being
used to pay costs associated with receiving
and displaying pieces either donated or
loaned to the school.
Finally, Merryman was asked to
comment upon a rather unique
architectural feature of the law school
holes spaced regularly along the concrete
walls of the new buildings. Merryman was
not certain what the purpose of the holes
is, whether for acoustics, aesthetics, or
stress, but he did find that "it's more
interesting to have them than not." —S.S.

obtain and display distinguished art in the
law school. Merryman, chairman since
1964 of the physical plant committee for
the new school, has personally spent many
hours in acquiring the law school's art
collection.
The three sculptures, six paintings, and
thirty-one lithographs presently on display
in the new buildings are all gifts or loans to
the school, the Law School's only
expenditures having been for freight,
hanging, and related items.
Four pieces, the Robert Motherwell oil
and collage in the main lobby, the Ludwig
Sander painting in Dean Ehrlich's outer
office, the San Francis silkscreen print in
the Herbert Packer Faculty Reading Room,
and the Carla Lavatelli sculpture in the
Crocker Garden are permanent. All the
remaining pieces are on loan.
The largest number of works is on loan
from Gemini G.E.L. of Los Angeles, the
most important of the few shops in the
U.S. where leading artists work with master
printers to make fine prints. Gemini prints
are in limited editions, from as few as eight
or 10 up to 125.
When Gemini produces a lithograph, it
retains the first three copies for use in
travelling exhibitions. Normally Gemini
only lends such prints for a period of three
months, but the thirty pieces on display at
the law school will remain here two years.

In Celebration
Merryman refused to single out any of
the art as his personal favorites, but certain
of the pieces stand out. The sculpture in
the front courtyard, entitled Four Square,
was created by Dame Barbara Hepworth of
England and is on loan from the Norton
Simon Foundation for two years.
The sculpture on display was formerly
the centerpiece at the U.C.L.A. sculpture
garden. It is one of only four castings from
the original mold. Hepworth, awarded the
tile Dame of the British Empire because of
her distinguished work as a sculptress, died
in a fire in her studio in Cornwall just one
week after her sculpture was installed at
the Law School.

The Motherwell oil and collage in the
main foyer, entitled "In Celebration," was
commissioned by Richard Lang, J.D. '29,
to commemorate completion of the new
law school buildings.
Robert Motherwell, acclaimed by art

critic Frank O'Hare as "one of the leading
figures in the greatest revolution in modern
art since cubism, abstract expressionism,"
graduated from Stanford with an A.B. in
philosophy in 1936.
The piece directly across from the
Motherwell, entitled Bood, is polyester
paint on fiberglas by Tom Holland. Its
subtlety and overall composition furnish an
interesting contrast to the bold color and
imagery of the Motherwell oil and collage,
according to Merryman.
The Holland Painting is one of four lent
to the Law School by Nicholas Wilder, a
respected art dealer in Los Angeles. Wilder,
a Stanford undergraduate, attended the
Law School for a short time.
Distinguished Art
Merryman said that the Law School was
discriminating in deciding what pieces of
art would be displayed. A number of offers
of art were declined, according to
Merryman.
"There is enough bad and uninteresting
artwork around without bringing it to the
Law School. What we've tried to hang is
work that is distinguished. These are
splendid buildings. It would be a shame to
paste the walls with schlock art,"
Merryman explained.
He continued, "Where you spend your
time has an effect on the way you act and
who you are. We are lucky to live with
quality architecture and art."
The presence of such valuable art in the
law school naturally raises the question of
security for prevention of theft and
vandalism.
Merryman maintained that there is no
relationship between the art and tight
security measures in the law school
buildings. "The presence of art in the
buildings should enhance, not restrict or
distort the life of the school. We'll pack up
the art and send it back if it ever impairs
the running of the law school," Merryman
noted.
Merryman emphasized that these piece
of art are not marketable since each one is
numbered or is unique.
Future Plans
There are no plans for adding to the law
school's art collection at the present time.
However, Merryman would eventually like
to see more vacant walls filled with
artwork.
"I hope the habit of having good things
on the walls will continue," Merryman said
when asked what would happen after the
pieces are sent back to their owners. For
this purpose a small fund is being
accumulated through the sale of the
Motherwell Celebration prints.
The policy of not making expenditures
for purchasing artwork will continue,
however, with money from the fund being
used to pay costs associated with receiving
and displaying pieces either donated or
loaned to the school.
Finally, Merryman was asked to
comment upon a rather unique
architectural feature of the law school
holes spaced regularly along the concrete
walls of the new buildings. Merryman was
not certain what the purpose of the holes
is, whether for acoustics, aesthetics, or
stress, but he did find that "it's more
interesting to have them than not." —S.S.

"Good art enriches the lives of the
people who experience it, often in subtle
ways. There is no reason why the insides of
the law school should be visually narrow
and confining."

thirty-one lithographs presently on display
in the new buildings are all gifts or loans to
the school, the Law School's only
expenditures having been for freight,
hanging, and related items.
Four pieces, the Robert Motherwell oil
and collage in the main lobby, the Ludwig
Sander painting in Dean Ehrlich's outer
office, the San Francis silkscreen print in
the Herbert Packer Faculty Reading Room,
and the Carla Lavatelli sculpture in the
Crocker Garden are permanent. All the
remaining pieces are on loan.
The largest number of works is on loan
from Gemini G.E.L. of Los Angeles, the
most important of the few shops in the
U.S. where leading artists work with master
printers to make fine prints. Gemini prints
are in limited editions, from as few as eight
or 10 up to 125.
When Gemini produces a lithograph, it
retains the first three copies for use in
travelling exhibitions. Normally Gemini
only lends such prints for a period of three
months, but the thirty pieces on display at
the law school will remain here two years.

In Celebration
Merryman refused to single out any of
the art as his personal favorites, but certain
of the pieces stand out. The sculpture in
the front courtyard, entitled Four Square,
was created by Dame Barbara Hepworth of
England and is on loan from the Norton
Simon Foundation for two years.
The sculpture on display was formerly
the centerpiece at the U.C.L.A. sculpture
garden. It is one of only four castings from
the original mold. Hepworth, awarded the
tile Dame of the British Empire because of
her distinguished work as a sculptress, died
in a fire in her studio in Cornwall just one
week after her sculpture was installed at
the Law School.

The Motherwell oil and collage in the
main foyer, entitled "In Celebration," was
commissioned by Richard Lang, J.D. '29,
to commemorate completion of the new
law school buildings.
Robert Motherwell, acclaimed by art

critic Frank O'Hare as "one of the leading
figures in the greatest revolution in modern
art since cubism, abstract expressionism,"
graduated from Stanford with an A.B. in
philosophy in 1936.
The piece directly across from the
Motherwell, entitled Bood, is polyester
paint on fiberglas by Tom Holland. Its
subtlety and overall composition furnish an
interesting contrast to the bold color and
imagery of the Motherwell oil and collage,
according to Merryman.
The Holland Painting is one of four lent
to the Law School by Nicholas Wilder, a
respected art dealer in Los Angeles. Wilder,
a Stanford undergraduate, attended the
Law School for a short time.
Distinguished Art
Merryman said that the Law School was
discriminating in deciding what pieces of
art would be displayed. A number of offers
of art were declined, according to
Merryman.
"There is enough bad and uninteresting
artwork around without bringing it to the
Law School. What we've tried to hang is
work that is distinguished. These are
splendid buildings. It would be a shame to
paste the walls with schlock art,"
Merryman explained.
He continued, "Where you spend your
time has an effect on the way you act and
who you are. We are lucky to live with
quality architecture and art."
The presence of such valuable art in the
law school naturally raises the question of
security for prevention of theft and
vandalism.
Merryman maintained that there is no
relationship between the art and tight
security measures in the law school
buildings. "The presence of art in the
buildings should enhance, not restrict or
distort the life of the school. We'll pack up
the art and send it back if it ever impairs
the running of the law school," Merryman
noted.
Merryman emphasized that these piece
of art are not marketable since each one is
numbered or is unique.
Future Plans
There are no plans for adding to the law
school's art collection at the present time.
However, Merryman would eventually like
to see more vacant walls filled with
artwork.
"I hope the habit of having good things
on the walls will continue," Merryman said
when asked what would happen after the
pieces are sent back to their owners. For
this purpose a small fund is being
accumulated through the sale of the
Motherwell Celebration prints.
The policy of not making expenditures
for purchasing artwork will continue,
however, with money from the fund being
used to pay costs associated with receiving
and displaying pieces either donated or
loaned to the school.
Finally, Merryman was asked to
comment upon a rather unique
architectural feature of the law school
holes spaced regularly along the concrete
walls of the new buildings. Merryman was
not certain what the purpose of the holes
is, whether for acoustics, aesthetics, or
stress, but he did find that "it's more
interesting to have them than not." —S.S.

"Good art enriches the lives of the
people who experience it, often in subtle
ways. There is no reason why the insides of
the law school should be visually narrow
and confining."
Thus did Professor John Merryman
explain the philosophy behind efforts to
obtain and display distinguished art in the
law school. Merryman, chairman since
1964 of the physical plant committee for
the new school, has personally spent many
hours in acquiring the law school's art
collection.
