# Old Law School: Appearance, Attitude Alter
## 
### 
K anyone should happen to grow
nostalgic for the old law school, it is my
advice that she/he not visit it, for the
resulting culture shock would be
untreatable.

The main building, except for the
library and the annex, is now occupied by
the political science department. They have
made substantial changes in the physical
lay-out of the building, altering it almost

beyond recognition.
For example, the main reading room on
the third floor has been converted into
eight separate faculty offices, with a large
secretarial area in the center. The federal
reading room is now the Victor J. West
Library, housing the department's
collection of books. And the old Vrooman
Room has undergone a name change it is
now called the Graham Stuart Lounge.
The second floor now houses the Arms
Control program of the Political Science
Department. Actually, it is a legs control
program as well, because two sides of the
floor's corridors have been closed off to
allow for student offices, requiring use of
the annex hallway to get from one side of
the second floor to the other.
Basement
The basement has also undergone
substantial changes. The old mimeo room
has been carpeted and partitioned,
reproducing 13 student offices. The room
which housed the library's oversized books
and state reports has been carpeted and
converted into eight student offices. Two
additional faculty offices have been
constructed in the entrance to the law
review offices.
Plans call for the conversion of the old
locker area into a laboratory for
computational purposes.

wall, which allows two more faculty
offices. The remaining part of the lounge
will be reserved for use by political science
graduate students.
The entire building has been repainted
and its lighting upgraded.
'Neurotic' Lawyers
The members of the political science
department are finding it somewhat
difficult to adjust to a building long
identified as a legal institution. One
professor said, "This building was designed
for lawyers and their neurotic needs.
Closed and formal spaces attribute
themselves to the kind of needs lawyers
have, not the kind we have."
Political science was formerly housed in
four separate buildings on campus.
Although the department was split up in
this manner, the people in each building
formed close-knit groups. "Now from four
separate places where we could have casual
intimacy we have moved into this
impersonal vertical building," an
administrator said.
Students who had become accustomed
to comfortable offices in Building 20 are
finding it "hard to be enthusiastic about
the mimeo room all chopped up." And
faculty members are finding amusing the
wash basins and hanging spaces for
umbrellas and three-piece suits which are

located in each office.
Most disturbing to the members of the
department are the remnants of the law
school signs on the outside of the building.
Even though the letters have been removed
from the exterior, the words "School of
Law" can still be read on the sandstone.
In addition, the same words appear
mysteriously on the double plate glass
above the front door. Construction
workers say they can see no way of
removing this glass since the walls were
evidently built around it. Thus, "the ghost
of the law school still stalks," as one
administrator put it.
Still, the department is optimistic about
its new quarters, especially since it is all in
one location for the first time, and looks
forward to the beginning of instruction in
early October.
Annex
The old law school annex now houses
the history department, while the history
corner undergoes remodeling. Nancy Ray,
department administrative assistant,
expects the stay to be at least three years,
especially in view of the fact that it will be
one year before plans for the remodeling
are even drawn.
Adjustment for the history department
has been even more difficult than for
political science. History is moving from
expansive quarters, including sixteen-foot
high ceilings, to the cramped conditions of
the annex, where there is no space for
graduate student offices or even for all the
professors' books. "If we clap up and down
instead of sideways, we can make it," one
administrator said.
So why is history moving into the
annex? "This was the only space available
where we could be together without being
scattered all over the place," explained
Ray.
The most distressing aspect of this
musical buidlings game to members of the
history department is the loss of the law
lounge. "We may not miss the lawyers but
we're sure going to miss their lounge," Ray
said.
The remodeling of history corner is
going to put an added burden on the old
law school's classrooms. History corner had
more classroom space than any other
building on campus. This loss of space will
have to be absorbed by the result of the
university, especially the old law school.
Thus, the provost is assigning all
classrooms, the ground floor of the annex,
and the old Lang Room for general use by
the university.
A political science spokesperson found
this situation fascinating. "When you think
about it it's rather interesting. This old
building has never had hordes of
undergraduates swarming through it."
Entombed Library
The old law library is being used for
storage and the housing of old books so
called dead stacks by the main Stanford
Library. The door leading into the library
will remain locked and inaccessible to the
public. A more appropriate fate for the old
library could not be found.
