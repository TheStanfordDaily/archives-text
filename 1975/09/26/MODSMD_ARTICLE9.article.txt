## Fitting Old Informality into New Spaces 
### Jim Liebman 
"Every new building has problems,"
noted Erika Kaltenbach, Maintenance
Supervisor of the Law School who directed
the move into the new building. "This
building has problems. Is that news?"

For anyone who has sweated (or
shivered) through classes, encountered a
locked door, choked on the smoke in the
bathrooms, gotten locked in a stairwell, or
searched fruitlessly for a professor's office,
that is indeed news.
When asked about the new facilities,
most of the occupants preface their
comments with general priase. (Singled out
by many for that praise, in fact, is Erika,
who directed what library and
administration officials believe was a
remarkably smooth transition.)
The subsequent voicing of complaints
often refers to minor, if annoying
exceptions to people's views of the
building.
Maintaining the Flow
Nonetheless, the overall building design
has also imposed constraints which some
believe raise important questions of
educational philosophy and the future of
legal education at Stanford.
"For all its inadequacies," noted
Professor Gerald Gunther, "the old
building made this the most informal law
school in the country with constant
student-faculty and faculty-faculty contact
and an all day and night flow of students
throughout."
Some students and faculty members
worry that the new physical environment
and rules to preserve it could destroy that
informality and reproduce attitudes
prevalent at other law schools where
students avoid approaching faculty unless
they have pressing, focused problems
capable of short answers. And even then,
appointments are essential.
"This big a plant," another added, "has
inevitable problems."
Professor Paul Brest agreed. He felt the
building presents some architectural
problems which "we can't fix
mechanically, so we'll have to find ways to
do it socially."
Design Drawbacks
Law Association President Emalie
Ortega concurred: "If the administration
wants to establish a sense of community,
given the architecturally imposed
drawbacks, we're going to have to work
that much harder."
Some of those "drawbacks," of course,
were actually necessary features of a larger
building with unfortunate side effects.
However, Dean Thomas Ehrlich noted,
"there are, of course, a few things I wish
we could do over again." And, he added,
"we have to work to insure the intimacy
we had before."
Assistant Dean Leininger, whose
administrative duties include overseeing the
security of the building described the basic
though understandable problem:
"This is a mid-sixties building." Working
plans for it went to the architect,
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in 1968,
long before such quaint phrases as "oil
crisis" or "energy czar" had risen to
prominence. And Dean Leininger noted,
security considerations were not much of a

problem then, although "a wave of thefts"
hit the entire campus, including the law
school, 'ast year.
Of particular note as design problems
are:
—The large, thus potentially less
personal size.
—The segmentation of the building into
student and faculty, plus classroom areas
each of which can be closed off from the
others.
—The long, forbidding, sometimes
dead-end faculty corridors, some without
any direct access to student areas like the
library.
—The lack of many windows in the
library and of openable windows
everywhere, making the building wholly air
conditioning-dependent.
—Such minor problems with major
consequence, as locks which are so difficult
to work that individual offices are left
unlocked necessitating locking whole areas
of the building to protect them.
—Some students feel the "sterile"
classrooms with the large spaces between
students may engender a more competitive
atmosphere there.
—ln addition, the mail boxes were
originally too small (a "big goof," now
fixed at no law school expense according
to Leininger); the moot court bench was
originally built for "eight foot giants" of
jurisprudence; and the now remodeled and
bricked inner courtyard was originally
designed to mimic the Tuileries Garden in
Paris with a gravel sunk in clay
ground-cover, which turned oui to be a
"giant gravel pit," in Dean Ehrlich's words.
To illustrate some of the problems,
Professor Brest noted, "there is no reason
for students to be up here on the third
floor except to specifically see faculty, yet
it's fun to have students just stop in
occasionally to break up our work." And
Dean Leininger spent several minutes
illustrating the difficulty of locking his
door, eventually giving up the effort.
These design problems were not all
unanticipated, of course. Both Ehrlich and
Leininger, for instance, noted that the
building was designed to overcome the
impersonal aspects of its large size and
segmentation, by funneling people from all
sides through the foyer and into the lounge
and inner courtyard.
The "mixing" this was supposed to
foster was not fully realized until the
lounge opened two weeks after students
returned to the law school this fall.
Remedial physical measures and a lot of
encouragement to people are also being
used to mitigate the design problems.
For example, locks will be changed to a
self-locking brand. And faculty windows,
will be made openable though to use them
without air conditioning loss, faculty will
have to close their doors.
Open Door Policy
As the latter indicates all problems
cannot be solved without creating more.
An open door policy was singled out by
several professors as necessary to encourage
student-faculty (and faculty-faculty)
contact, and to break up the unfriendly

corridors.
"Faculty must let students know they're
welcome all of the time," noted Brest who
felt confident that the tradition of students
seeing faculty could overcome the
problem.
(In that tradition, second year student
Howard Parelskin, who is supervising the
lounge resisted selling food in the faculty
lounge, so that faculty would have to
venture down to the student lounge once
in a while.)
In the same vein Professor Gunther said
the faculty is "counting heavily on second
and third year students used to the old
operation" to maintain the old atmosphere
and resist security measures which hamper
it.
"But," he added "it's not good to say
it'll work out ultimately, and leave it at
that. We don't want to settle into
unattractive patterns. Now should be the
maximum period of flexibility."
Security
A major complaint, however, has been
the tight security measures established
during the summer to prevent that flexibility.
"When I'm locked out of part of it at 5
o'clock," noted one student, "I don't feel
like it's my law school."
Dean Leininger and Professor John
Henry Merry man, the faculty member most
intimately involved with the construction
and decoration of the new building, both
noted that many of the security measures
which were causing problems were
developed during the summer when very
few students and faculty were on campus,
leaving it "highly vulnerable" to thieves
and vandals.
Because of this, the faculty areas were
sealed off at 5:30 p.m. This hampered
faculty contact with each other and
faculty-student communications after that
time.
Similarly the locking of the entire
building at midnight and the sealing off of
classrooms in the late afternoon has
diminished the utility of the building to
student organizations and informal groups.
As Professor Brest noted of the midnight
closing: "There is not a person on this
faculty who didn't spend many nights
working to 2:30 or even 4 in the morning
at the Law Review or some like
organization. Those activities are
substantially important educational
experiences," he added, which suffer with
shorter hours.
According to Leininger all of these
policies are currently under review as are
suggestions to keep the faculty areas open
as late as the library, as well as keeping
some or all classrooms open at night, at
least by appointment.
(However, since some of the art work
was loaned to the law school only after its
owners were told of those summer security
provisions, it is unclear how much
flexibility is possible in changing them, so
long as the artwork remains.)
Faculty, Student Input
Part of the problem, some faculty
members felt, was the unilateral nature of

Pit" into the Crocker Garden (inner

many security decisions. "There was no
faculty input. We'd find out about the new
rules from a memo, or worse, by running
into a locked door," one professor noted.
Now the faculty Library Committee,
headed by Professor Paul Goldstein, will be
consulted on security matters. As for
student consultation, there has been "none
yet," according to Leininger, noting the
absence of students during the summer.
"We'll get some," he added.
The need for a security system is
admitted by all. As Leininger noted, "it's a
brand new building with rich
appointments. Of course we're concerned."
Which of those "appointments" are the
main impetus, however, is unclear. As for
the artwork, Merry man remarked, "the
presence of art in the building is not
related in any manner to the running of the
building and the tightening of security. We
can't allow this to happen. We'll return the
art first."
Nonetheless, Leininger felt that the art
work is "part of our security concerns."
Some have questioned the priorities
which would place prints or other material
objects over the needs of the buildings
inhabitants. As Law Association Treasurer,
Marsha Simms noted, "it would be sad if
the students got the feeling that the school
is catering to the alumni more than
students, and doing things to assure them
they spent their money for good reason."
First Amendment
The question of priorities is one
characterized by surface agreement with
Dean Ehrlich that "the purpose of the
building is people."
But Professor Gunther noted that while
"on principle everybody is for education as
against material objects, it is in the
application of the balance where there is
disagreement."
GuntheFs position on the a matter at least,
is clear (if somewhat at odds with his view
of Constitutional Law): "My balancing
requires that security measures must meet
strict scrutiny and have a high justifiction
before they can inhibit the human flow."
"Maximum exchange among human
beings should be the First Amendment of
the Law School," he added, finally unable
to hold back a smile.
Leininger also spoke in terms of a
balance, noting that there must be a
"compromise, to provide an easy access as

possible while still protecting things."
Ultimately, of course, some degree of
physical deterioration and property loss is
inevitable; the question remains just how
much can be tolerated.
As Professor Merryman said, "they are
extraordinary buildings very beautiful,
very fine. I hope we live up to them. They
shouldn't be taken for granted. A lot of
effort, time, money, and talent have gone
into them."
This understandable protectiveness of
the new facility was also voiced by a
member of the staff who commented:
"The building is like a baby: no matter
what's good or bad about it, you love it
because, by God, it's yours!
High School
An understandable and generally
followed measure to protect property
the no smoking restrictions in the
classrooms is having its effects. The
restrooms are beginning to resemble high
school facilities as people use them for a
between class smoke.
On the same, more mundane level, the
air conditioning has had people bringing
sweat shirts for one class only to find that
their next classroom is without the same,
reaching temperatures well into the
eighties.
Apparently the classroom schedule was
not immediately given to the people at the
central University physical plant which
controls the air conditioning by computer.
In fact, some staff members haven taken
to bringing heaters into their offices to
overcome the air conditioning.
Activist Stand
All in all most people agree with Dean
Ehrlich that the new building's problems
are "correctable." All additionally agree
with Merryman that the improvements and
adjustments will take a while, and with his
warning against "romanticizing" the old
building in the meantime.
"It takes time for a building to acquire
meaning to the people inside it. The human
dynamics will take time to emerge,"
Merryman said.
However, there is much support for an
activist approach to regulating the new
environment so that it does not regulate us.
As Professor Gunther noted, "of course
we can't move the old building into the
new, but we have to be damn careful in the
process of moving into the new place that
we don't sell our educational soul for too
many restrictions."

Professor John Henry Merryman relaxes in his office. As chairman of the physical
plant committee since 1964, he contributed much to the design, planning and
decoration of the new law school of which he is justifiably proud.
