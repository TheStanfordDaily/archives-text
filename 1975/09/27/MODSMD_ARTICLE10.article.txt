# ...but Cordova takes command of the offense

### MIKE TOLLIN 
Pittsburgh, State College, Berea
and finally Ann Arbor. If TWA
ever tried to assemble such a
travel package they'd likely end
up using their 747s for dive
bombers. Yet when the Stanford
footballers returned last weekend
from their trip to these forbidden
locales, there was a
disproportionate number of smiles
on their faces.
What happened is that the
Cardinals managed to tear
themselves from these tourist
attractions long enough to play
some football. On their first go at
it in State College, Pennsylvania,
the Cards didn't fare so well.
Running into some inhospitable
hosts, aptly dubbed the Nittany
Lions, Stanford was embarassed
34-14.
But this Saturday past, in Ann
Arbor, the Cards came back with
a vengeance. Against the
second-ranked, supposedly
invincible Michigan Wolverines,
the Cards played as if the
Wolverines were their travel
agents. On a day when even the
sun couldn't decide whether to be
in or out, the two teams battled
back and forth with an intensity
usually reserved for post-season
affairs.
Appropriately enough, the
final gun sounded with neither
team ahead. The 19-19 tie, while
obviously inconclusive, did prove
one thing to Stanford Head Coach
Jack Christiansen. "This shows
that when we're ready mentally
and physically, we can play with
anybody in the country," he
declared.
And it might even have given
starving quarterback Mike
Cordova a much needed shot of
confidence. At least somebody
noticed his performance. Sports
Illustrated, which last year
ridiculed him for throwing balls
into the turf (".. .he has thrown
so many passes into the ground at
Stanford Stadium that fans are
calling him 'Cor-Divit'"),named
the junior signal-caller national
offensive player of the week.
Okay, so what's so great about
a tie, you say? After all, everyone
knows a tie is like hugging your
mother (or something like that).
It's just that in this case

Stanford's mother was a little
better-looking than Michigan's.
Consider a few facts:
—Stanford was coming off a
very shabby performance at Penn
State in which the offense turned
the ball over six times and the
defense exhibited more holes than
a five-year-old pair of socks.
—Michigan had dominated
supposedly tough Wisconsin the
week before in a 23-6 laugher on
the losers' home turf. And
tailback Gordie Bell, who gained
210 yards against the Badgers,
threatened to gain a mile against
the supposedly porous,
inexperienced Stanford defense.
—Stanford's starting fullback,
Dave Tenn, broke his arm in the
Penn State game and probably
was lost for the season.
—Michigan was playing in front
of 92,000 screaming partisans,
hadn't lost in 35 home games and
was rated a 21-point favorite over
the visitors.
Despite all this, Stanford very
nearly came home a winner. If
Mike Langford hadn't missed a
first quarter extra point and if
Mike Cordova had been able to
lead the offense in from first and

goal at the Michigan four in the
last minute of the game... But
considering Langford booted two
clutch field goals in the fourth
quarter and Cordova was
masterful most of the game (24
completions in 44 attempts for
290 yards and two TDs), blame
shouldn't be harsh.
Stanford actually got a few
breaks of its own (a couple of
fumble recoveries and a deflected
pass TD) and somehow a tie
seemed the most just result.
The two head coaches
post-game comments conveyed
their teams' moods. Michigan
mentor Bo Schembechler, denied
his 100 th career coaching victory,
grumbled, "A tie is like a loss."
And Stanford's Christiansen
chirped, "I feel like I'm coming
home a winner."
Chris' crew also came home
feeling a bit travel-weary. The trip
was a taxing one, especially the
five days spent in Berea, Ohio,
where the most exciting activity
was counting one's mosquito
bites.
"I know the players weren't
too happy about it," explained
Chris, "but since we had to be

back for the Michigan game
anyway, it made sense to stay
back east after playing Penn State.
"Baldwin-Wallace College [in
Berea] had the facilities we
needed, including artificial turf, so
we stayed there. I must admit that
there was really nothing for the
players to do there — no girls or
anything — but then maybe that's
why they played so well at
Michigan."
The Stanford contingent
returned to California Saturday
night and observers are trying to
determine what to expect next
from the topsyturvy crew. Coach
Chris said his team "came of age"
at Michigan, but as he knows "one
game does not make a season."
Was the Michigan game a fluke or
in one week did Stanford turn
itself from a pushover to a
national power?
At Michigan, Stanford
appeared to have reached an
emotional level that will be
difficult to sustain for an entire
season. But then, the Cards don't
have to play Michigan every week.
The Cards played smart football
in Ann Arbor — thanks largely to
some great preparation by the

coaches — and there is enough
talent on this team to at least
make a run for the roses.
Looking ahead, Cordova, who's
leading the nation in passing and
total offense, finally seems ready
to live up to his promise. And if
he can become a bit more
consistent, he may yet be able to
silence his huge assemblage of
critics.
Whichever quarterback is in
there can count on having an
All-American-caliber end to throw
to. Tony Hill, who's first in the
country with 14 catches, and was
named co-Pac-8 offensive player
of the week, sparkled on the road
trip and must be considered a
threat at all times.
The Card's running game has
yet to get going, but in
Christiansen's scheme of things
it's little more than a decoy for
Cordova's aerial circus.
Sophomore John Finley looked
good in replacing Tenn, though,
and with veteran Ron Inge coming
out of the I formation, the Cards'
running attack could be effective
at times.
As for the defense — it's
anybody's guess at this point.
"Hecker's Deckers" have played
like schlzos so far. Against Penn
State they were trampled by Joe
Paterno's fleet of backs, but in
Michigan they came up with
almost all the big plays and
contained Michigan's option play
just as it's done on the
blackboard. Duncan McColl, Geb
Church and Gerald Wilson, named
Pac-8 defensive player of the
week, played superbly, and with
so many young players on the
starting unit, the "Deckers" can
only get better.
In short then, you'd better give
this team a chance. Wins over San
Jose State and Army seem likely,
and at least a 5-2 Pac-8 record
looks within reach. Now that may
not get the Cards to Pasadena, but
with Pac-8 teams eligible for oiher
bowls this year, a 7-3-1 mark
(including that impressive tie with
Michigan) should attract some
kind of bowl bid.
Like maybe a Stanford-
Michigan rematch in a
Runnerup-to-the-Rose Bowl-Bowl.
