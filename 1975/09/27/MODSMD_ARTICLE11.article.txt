# All in all, more of the same
## This year, however, there's more than roses 
### DAN PYNE 
All in all, this Pacific-Eight season won't be
much different from last season, or, for that
matter, the season before that. And, all in all, it
probably would have been pretty boring for
everyone except maybe John McKay were it not
for the new rule allowing more than one Pac-8 team
to participate in post-season bowl games.
To put it quite bluntly, the University of
Southern California is destined to tiptoe to the
Rose Bowl once again, as it has done for seven of
the last nine years. But that new rule means that
Stanford, UCLA, and maybe Cal could be in the
bidding for some sort of post-season action (i.e. the
Fiesta Bowl or perhaps a guest appearance on the
Bob Hope' Christmas special).
This still doesn't leave much for the bottom half
of the conference, better known as "The Northern
Schools," for which participation in the Pac-8 is
more a masochistic fixation than anything else. It
has been suggested that Washington has a slim shot
at the Grantland Rice Bowl, but only if 72 percent
of all other Division I colleges are placed on
probation or pick up a plague.
And so it goes.
While the Trojans may not win the Rose Bowl
this season, it's going to be awfully hard to keep
them out. Already 2-0 and ranked third nationally,
McKay's machine is listed a 21-point favorite over
Purdue this weekend. Quarterback Vince Evans is
taking over for Haden quite effectively, and
tailback Ricky Bell has already broken the USC
single-game rushing record. The defense is
predictably formidable.
"We're a year away from greatness," says
McKay, "but the Trojans will survive in '75." This
is, of course, the same man who, when asked if he
objected to the same team appearing in the Rose
Bowl year after year, replied, "Well, yes I do. I
don't think Ohio State should come every year."
Just down the road in the city of fallen angels,
and just down the national rankings as well, UCLA
is hoping to come back from a 6-3-2 "off-year."

What stands in their way is defense.
The Bruin offense is led by quarterback John
Sciarra, who is termed "thepremiere quarterback in
the nation" and "a really good college passer" and
some other nice things by second-year head coach
Dick Vermeil. And it is a good offense — racking up
71 points in two games.
But the defense lost 10 starters and will be
hardpressed to stand up under some of the more
potent offensive attacks in the conference. The
only returning starter is linebacker Dale Curry, who
was the second leading tackier on the team last
year.
Steve Bartkowski isn't at Cal anymore, and his
absence leaves a big hole in the Bears' game plan.
Without Bart, Cal can neither score as effectively
nor keep opponents from gaining possession of the
ball, both of which are necessary if the Golden
Bears are planning to win anything this year.
And thus far they haven't. Losses to Colorado
and West Virginia have left Cal at 0-2, and although
both opponents are nationally recognized football
powers, Cal showed weaknesses not conducive to
winning.
Washington leads the ranks of the hapless
Northern Four, with an experienced but not
necessarily talented squad. Nontheless the Huskies
are favored to beat Navy (you remember them) this
weekend, and with luck the Dogs could give the
upper four conference teams some trouble. Most
promising is 245-pound fullback Robin Earl.
Both Oregon State and Washington State are
also experienced, and matched up so evenly that, if
this were another conference, they might have some
pretty exciting moments. The Cougars, 2-9 last
year, will be looking for anything and everything to
continue their presently undefeated status, while
the Beavers — "much stronger," according to head
coach Dee Andros — have among returning vets
tight end Dave Brown and linebacker Bob Horn.
And then there's Oregon.
After two opening losses the Ducks may very
well be looking forward to the basketball season.
All in all, this Pacific-Eight season won't be
much different from last season, or, for that

probably would have been pretty boring for
everyone except maybe John McKay were it not
for the new rule allowing more than one Pac-8 team
to participate in post-season bowl games.
To put it quite bluntly, the University of
Southern California is destined to tiptoe to the
Rose Bowl once again, as it has done for seven of
the last nine years. But that new rule means that
Stanford, UCLA, and maybe Cal could be in the
bidding for some sort of post-season action (i.e. the
Fiesta Bowl or perhaps a guest appearance on the
Bob Hope' Christmas special).
This still doesn't leave much for the bottom half
of the conference, better known as "The Northern
Schools," for which participation in the Pac-8 is
more a masochistic fixation than anything else. It
has been suggested that Washington has a slim shot
at the Grantland Rice Bowl, but only if 72 percent
of all other Division I colleges are placed on
probation or pick up a plague.
And so it goes.
While the Trojans may not win the Rose Bowl
this season, it's going to be awfully hard to keep
them out. Already 2-0 and ranked third nationally,
McKay's machine is listed a 21-point favorite over
Purdue this weekend. Quarterback Vince Evans is
taking over for Haden quite effectively, and
tailback Ricky Bell has already broken the USC
single-game rushing record. The defense is
predictably formidable.
"We're a year away from greatness," says
McKay, "but the Trojans will survive in '75." This
is, of course, the same man who, when asked if he
objected to the same team appearing in the Rose
Bowl year after year, replied, "Well, yes I do. I
don't think Ohio State should come every year."
Just down the road in the city of fallen angels,
and just down the national rankings as well, UCLA
is hoping to come back from a 6-3-2 "off-year."

What stands in their way is defense.
The Bruin offense is led by quarterback John
Sciarra, who is termed "thepremiere quarterback in
the nation" and "a really good college passer" and
some other nice things by second-year head coach
Dick Vermeil. And it is a good offense — racking up
71 points in two games.
But the defense lost 10 starters and will be
hardpressed to stand up under some of the more
potent offensive attacks in the conference. The
only returning starter is linebacker Dale Curry, who
was the second leading tackier on the team last
year.
Steve Bartkowski isn't at Cal anymore, and his
absence leaves a big hole in the Bears' game plan.
Without Bart, Cal can neither score as effectively
nor keep opponents from gaining possession of the
ball, both of which are necessary if the Golden
Bears are planning to win anything this year.
And thus far they haven't. Losses to Colorado
and West Virginia have left Cal at 0-2, and although
both opponents are nationally recognized football
powers, Cal showed weaknesses not conducive to
winning.
Washington leads the ranks of the hapless
Northern Four, with an experienced but not
necessarily talented squad. Nontheless the Huskies
are favored to beat Navy (you remember them) this
weekend, and with luck the Dogs could give the
upper four conference teams some trouble. Most
promising is 245-pound fullback Robin Earl.
Both Oregon State and Washington State are
also experienced, and matched up so evenly that, if
this were another conference, they might have some
pretty exciting moments. The Cougars, 2-9 last
year, will be looking for anything and everything to
continue their presently undefeated status, while
the Beavers — "much stronger," according to head
coach Dee Andros — have among returning vets
tight end Dave Brown and linebacker Bob Horn.
And then there's Oregon.
After two opening losses the Ducks may very
well be looking forward to the basketball season.
All in all, this Pacific-Eight season won't be
much different from last season, or, for that
matter, the season before that. And, all in all, it
probably would have been pretty boring for
everyone except maybe John McKay were it not
for the new rule allowing more than one Pac-8 team
