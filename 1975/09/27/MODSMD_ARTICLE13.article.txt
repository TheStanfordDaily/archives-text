# Spartans not fretting over PCAA woes
## 
### TIM W. FERGUSON 
Long-audible grumblings from
San Diego State about its
confinement in the relative
small-time of the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association (PCAA)
evolved this summer into a course
of action.
The school told the league it
wants out — for football, anyway
— if the National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA)
forms a "super conference" for
football, an action many expect.
But San Jose State Athletic
Director John Caine claims he
isn't too concerned. And he says
there's not much he can do
anyway.
"We're just waiting and
watching how things are going,"
he says.
"Things" means the push for a
new set-up which would allow
three or four score of NCAA
Division I (major conferences and
independents) schools to escape
many of the restrictions recently
enacted to aid financially pressed
institutions.
Super conference members
presumably could have larger
recruiting budgets, pay for more
athletic scholarships and take
more than the currently allowed
48 players on road trips.
San Diego State, long aching

for the big time, fears that
membership in the PCAA will
keep it from inclusion in any
super conference, and thus dash
its hopes of becoming a national
power.
So the Aztecs asked out, on the
condition that the NCAA
reorganizes. Caine thinks that's a
big "if."
Reorganization "might not
even be brought to the floor" at
the NCAA's January convention
in St. Louis, he says. Also, the
NCAA's television committee has
recommended extension of the
current ABC contract for two
years — indicating no change to
accomodate a super conference,
Caine maintains. He calls that "an
impressive bit of news."
Even if reorganization pans out,
and San Diego State says goodbye
to the local-yokuls, Caine won't
regard it as losing an arm and a
leg.
"I think San Jose State is the
most prestigious football program
in the PCAA," he says. "It's San
Jose State that plays three Pacific
Eight teams — not San Diego
State."
Although the Aztecs'
conditional withdrawal request
only concerned football, Caine
says that in the past, one-sport
dropouts have been made all-sport
dropouts at the league's behest.

"There's precedence that would
require San Diego State to drop
out [entirely] . . . That's
precedent — we get very
pragmatic at times, however."
The issue will arise at the

PCAA's winter meeting in
December, Came anticipates.
No matter what happens to its
conference rival, San Jose State
will continue to play a
"balanced-type schedule," mixing

"three or four" major power
opponents with its PCAA games,
according to Caine.
But super conference status?
"We'd have to know a lot more
about it," Caine says.
