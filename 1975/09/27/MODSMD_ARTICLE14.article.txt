# Watson brings tour home
## 
### 
Now that Tom Watson has
found his niche (not to mention a
few hundred thousand dollars) on
the professional golf tour, he's
coming back to assist the program
which gave him his boost.
Watson and a score of his
associates on the Professional
Golfers Association (PGA) circuit
are scheduled to compete in the
first annual Stanford Pro-Am golf
tournament Oct. 6 at the Stanford
Golf Course.
For Watson — who won the
1975 British Open with a
dramatic putt on the 18th green —
it will be a return to the course
and gallery which witnessed his
drive for All-American status in
1974.
And he isn't coming home
alone.
Also competing in the Pro-Am
will be a couple of past PGA
champions, San Franciscans Bob
Rosberg and Bob Lunn; this year's
United States Open runner-up,
John Mahaffey, and Los Angeles
Open champ Pat Fitzsimons.
Rounding out the field will be a
number of Northern California
pros including Bob Wynn, Ron
Cerrudo, Dick Lotz and George
Johnson, along with David Glenz,
Bill Rogers and Gary McCord.
Even former USC standout Rod
Funseth has agreed to play.
The tournament was organized
by Watson and a group calling
itself the "Friends of Stanford
Golf." They hope to raise money

for scholarships and other items
needed for the maintenance of
Stanford's collegiate golf program.
Each one of the touring pros

will be matched with a foursome
of amateurs — including many
current members of the Stanford
golf squad — during the
tournament.
