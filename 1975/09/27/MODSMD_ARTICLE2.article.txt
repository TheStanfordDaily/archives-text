# Road life wasn't so bad
## ...but nationally-ranked Stanford has yet to win 
### CHRIS BAKER 
For Jack Christiansen's Stanford Cardinals, last
Saturday's 19-19 tic with third-ranked Michigan
was a lot more passionate than kissing your sister.
The deadlock catapulted Stanford into the 18th
position in the Associated Press football poll.
But the Cards, with an 0-1-1 mark, hold the
tenuous distinction of being the only nationally
ranked team that has yet to win a game. And if that
first win doesn't come today, then Stanford will
drop from sight faster than you can say Alabama
(Right, Bear Bryant?).
Can the Cards pull another emotional
performance out of the hat for San Jose State? If
Christiansen's pre-game statements are any
indication, then you and a regional television
audience are in for an exciting afternoon.
Chris has been sounding like a broken recording
of Knute Rockne. "Our kids played with more
emotion against Michigan than they had in the
opener against Penn State," he said. "They have to
play every game just as emotionally as they did
Saturday.
"We can't afford to have any kind of letdown
against San Jose State," he continued 'TheyYe an
excellent team." The Spartan defense has posted
back-to-back shutouts for the first time since 1955
and San Jose State is currently riding a six-game
win streak, its longest in 20 years.

nation's leading passer with 501 yards, might come
down with a strange ailment called Wilson

Faumuina Now, don't go running for a medical
dictionary. Faumuina can be found in the Spartan
roster. The 6-foot-5 defensive tackle anchors a
tough San Jose State defensive line and he has
spent more time in opponents' backfields than
most quarterbacks.
Still, the San Jose State defensive backs will
have their work cut out for them against the Cards.
Stanford has the nation's leading receiver in Tony
Hill, to go along with the nation's leading passer.
"Christiansen lavished praise on the Spartan
defense. They're very tough defensively," Hill
said. "They have two very good tackles who put a
lot of pressure on the passer. Their secondary has
good speed and their linebackers are outstanding,
particularly Carl Ekern." Spartan linebackers Ekern
and Vance Topps have registered 36 tackles this
year.
But the San Jose State offense has been having
its problems this year. Quarterback Roger Proffitt
has not been able to effectively replace graduated
quarterback Craig Kimball. He doesn't like to talk
about it, either. Last week Proffitt completed just
two out of 14 attempts, with two interceptions, for
a San Jose State record low of three yards.
Spartan mentor Darryl Rogers, who last week
posted his first win over a Pacific-Eight school since
coming to San Jose, knows that his squad can't
display the same type of offensive performance
today.

"Stanford had a great game in
holding third-ranked Michigan to
a 19-19 tie. Our defense is going
to have to have another super
performance against the
Cardinals," Rogers said. And, it
goes without saying, our offensive
unit will have to get untracked for
us to stay in the game."
Last year an obscure
third-string tailback named Walt
Robinson helped the Spartans
gain a 21-21 tie against the Cards
late in the fourth quarter. San

Jose will be hard pressed to get 21
points this year.
Although the big names may
be gone from the Stanford
defense, it was able to effectively
contain Michigan's offensive
drives deep in Cardinal territory.
Safety Gerald Wilson, this
week's Pac-8 defensive player of
the week — almost
single-handedly — stopped three
Michigan drives by making
unassisted fourth down tackles on
the Wolverines' All-American
candidate Gordon Bell, deep in
Stanford territory.

Stanford will need that kind of
performance today to stop the
Spartans. But can the Cards get up
emotionally for San Jose State?
Well, maybe. Being on television
should help. It's a kick to impress
Mom and Dad on the tube.
That's a good omen too.
The last time the San Jose
State-Stanford game was televised,
a young quarterback named Jim
Plunkett opened his Stanford
career with a 68-20 win over San
Jose State. That is Stanford's
biggest winning margin over San
Jose State.

Faumuina Now, don't go running for a medical
dictionary. Faumuina can be found in the Spartan
roster. The 6-foot-5 defensive tackle anchors a
tough San Jose State defensive line and he has
spent more time in opponents' backfields than
most quarterbacks.
Still, the San Jose State defensive backs will
have their work cut out for them against the Cards.
Stanford has the nation's leading receiver in Tony
Hill, to go along with the nation's leading passer.
"Christiansen lavished praise on the Spartan
defense. They're very tough defensively," Hill
said. "They have two very good tackles who put a
lot of pressure on the passer. Their secondary has
good speed and their linebackers are outstanding,
particularly Carl Ekern." Spartan linebackers Ekern
and Vance Topps have registered 36 tackles this
year.
But the San Jose State offense has been having
its problems this year. Quarterback Roger Proffitt
has not been able to effectively replace graduated
quarterback Craig Kimball. He doesn't like to talk
about it, either. Last week Proffitt completed just
two out of 14 attempts, with two interceptions, for
a San Jose State record low of three yards.
Spartan mentor Darryl Rogers, who last week
posted his first win over a Pacific-Eight school since
coming to San Jose, knows that his squad can't
display the same type of offensive performance
today.

"Stanford had a great game in
holding third-ranked Michigan to
a 19-19 tie. Our defense is going
to have to have another super
performance against the
Cardinals," Rogers said. And, it
goes without saying, our offensive
unit will have to get untracked for
us to stay in the game."
Last year an obscure
third-string tailback named Walt
Robinson helped the Spartans
gain a 21-21 tie against the Cards
late in the fourth quarter. San

Jose will be hard pressed to get 21
points this year.
Although the big names may
be gone from the Stanford
defense, it was able to effectively
contain Michigan's offensive
drives deep in Cardinal territory.
Safety Gerald Wilson, this
week's Pac-8 defensive player of
the week — almost
single-handedly — stopped three
Michigan drives by making
unassisted fourth down tackles on
the Wolverines' All-American
candidate Gordon Bell, deep in
Stanford territory.

Stanford will need that kind of
performance today to stop the
Spartans. But can the Cards get up
emotionally for San Jose State?
Well, maybe. Being on television
should help. It's a kick to impress
Mom and Dad on the tube.
That's a good omen too.
The last time the San Jose
State-Stanford game was televised,
a young quarterback named Jim
Plunkett opened his Stanford
career with a 68-20 win over San
Jose State. That is Stanford's
biggest winning margin over San
Jose State.
For Jack Christiansen's Stanford Cardinals, last
Saturday's 19-19 tic with third-ranked Michigan
was a lot more passionate than kissing your sister.
The deadlock catapulted Stanford into the 18th
position in the Associated Press football poll.
But the Cards, with an 0-1-1 mark, hold the
tenuous distinction of being the only nationally
ranked team that has yet to win a game. And if that
first win doesn't come today, then Stanford will
drop from sight faster than you can say Alabama
(Right, Bear Bryant?).
Can the Cards pull another emotional
performance out of the hat for San Jose State? If
Christiansen's pre-game statements are any
indication, then you and a regional television
audience are in for an exciting afternoon.
Chris has been sounding like a broken recording
of Knute Rockne. "Our kids played with more
emotion against Michigan than they had in the
opener against Penn State," he said. "They have to
play every game just as emotionally as they did
Saturday.
"We can't afford to have any kind of letdown
against San Jose State," he continued 'TheyYe an
excellent team." The Spartan defense has posted
back-to-back shutouts for the first time since 1955
and San Jose State is currently riding a six-game
win streak, its longest in 20 years.
