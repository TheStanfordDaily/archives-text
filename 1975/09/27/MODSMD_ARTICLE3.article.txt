# Incomparably snubbed, but Bandsmen hard to keep quiet
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
There's only one Incomparable
marching band.
It shouldn't be hard for fans at
any game this season to tell which
of the bands on the field fits the
above description.
One band will be dressed like
toy soldiers. The Incomparables
dress with class.
One band will be marching like
military cadets. The
Incomparables move with more
class.
One band will be playing music
you r grandmother listens to. The
Incomparables play with class.
To most in attendence. the
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior Marching Band (LSJUMB)
needs no introduction Its antics
on and off the field have earned it
a reputation and popularity
unequaled anywhere.
And although the subtle
grossness will continue this year

on the Farm, many of the
characters who bring you today's
performance will be different.
About 50 raw recruits will join
the so-called old farts for today's
regionally televised fanfare. Band
manager Bill Wick said he was
pleased with this year's rookies
during their rehearsals at last
week's band camp.
Veteran bandsman Ken Rock
encouragingly added that "as long
as they keep blowing, they'll be
okay."
Wick expects a superior
performance from the Band this
afternoon, noting that television is
always an incentive for the Band
to let it all hang out.
Though he did not disclose
details of today's halftime show,
Wick said that it was chosen from
quite a few viable ideas, thanks to
the ingenuity of the Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers (SMUT).
While today's show is the debut

for eager freshmen, many of the
old-timers warmed up with the
annual Eastern trip, invading
College Park, Pa. and
Ann Arbor, Michigan with the
football team. Neither town may
ever be the same.
At Penn State, the band
responded to the Nittany Lion
Band's Bicentennial Salute with a
Centennial Salute (1876 was a very
good year).
But the highlight of the trip,
according to several old farts, was
their trip to the nation's capital
between the games.
The Band rallied outside the
office of Stanford alumna Carla
Hills, secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, and also on
the Capitol steps and in Lafayette
Park across from the White House.
Later that evening a group of
bandsmen ran into Susan Ford at
Winston's Bar in Washington. One
member asked her to dance, but

she refused. There is a rumor that
another asked her if she'd approve
of her mother's having an
extra-marital affair.
To top it off, "one of the secret
service guys was a Cal weanie"
Wick noted.
Another highlight occured
when the band's hats failed to
arrive before the trip. According
to Wick, Hal Mickelson, "an old
fart band announcer" scouted
around for hats and finally managed
one of the biggest bargains of the
century.
For $10, he purchased 100
white hats with red trim from the
Penn State Diner, which Wick
described as the "sleaziest greasy
spoon place in town." (Other
Band members attested to this by
trying the food and barely making
it out of bed for the game.)
Still though, newness will be

the key this afternoon. "The Band
changes every year," Wick
insisted. "Different people do
things differently."
Five of those different people
will be the new Dollies, as much
a part of the band as the tubas
and bass drums but much better
shaped.
If you're expecting traditional
songleaders, forget it. The Dollies
differ from that stereotype about
as much as the Band differs from
all others.
Dancing to the Band's music
this year will be Dollies Terry
Elms, Toni Hunter, Kathy
Cannell, Linda Bridgford and
Bonnie McColl (sister of defensive
stand-out Duncan).
So there will be new and there
will be old today. But you can
always be sure that there will be
class. Stanford class.
