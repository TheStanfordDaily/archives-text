# Cards' woman trainer wrapping pro
## 
### 
It's 2 p.m. in the Stanford
football training room, and as is
usual, there are three training
tables set up for the players to get
their ankles taped.
Over on the right is old pro
trainer Dave Blanchard, one of the
best in the nation.
In the center is his young
assistant, Stan Scott.
And on the left, is the newest
assistant, one Sherry Kosek.
Sherry Kosek?
It's somewhat unusual to see a
woman in a football training
room, hitherto reserved as a
masculine sanctuary. So unusual,
in fact, that Kosek is probably the
only woman in the U.S. who
regularly helps to train men's
teams.
The subject of
women-in-the-locker-room has
long been a favorite joke, at least
in the fraternal society of
sportswriters. But Kosek doesn't
seem to have any problems.
"I think that the training room
is a place where there is a great deal
of professionalism," she says, in
explaining why male athletes
don't act any differently when
she's around, other than to be
certain to slip on a pair of shorts.
Blanchard agrees, saying that
he's never heard any complaints
about her presence in the training
room. The veteran trainer says
that this is likely because she is
extremely professional. In fact, he
rates her "number one among all
women trainers," and among the
best trainers of eitlier sex, in the
country.
Kosek's road to the top in
athletic training has not been an
easy one. As among the first
women who specialized in
physical therapy for athletes, she
found it hard to get a job in her
chosen profession upon
graduation from the Mayo Clinic's
School of Physical Therapy in
1970.
After long letter-writing
sessions, she found an opening at
the University of Washington for a
physical therapist at the student
health center who could double as
an athletic trainer for women.
While at Washington, she broke
the training room barrier during
Christmas therapy programs for
both men and women.
This summer, with an opening
at Stanford because of the
merger of the men's and women's
athletic departments, Blanchard
hired Kosek as a full-time trainer.
She now works at the Roble
Gym in the morning as head
trainer for Stanford's growing

women's sports programs.
She notes that "times have
changed" since she began training
women in 1970. "Five years ago,
girls didn't do any physical
conditioning during the summer.
Now they do. Hopefully, this will
lead to fewer injuries."
After a lunchbreak so short it

hardly deserves the name, Kosek
comes over to the men's training
quarters to begin the daily ritual
of taping, padding and putting on
protective wrapping.
While she admits that the hours
on the practice field are often
dull, Kosek is not in the least
bored with her job. "You learn all

the time in this profession," she
says. "It's really very exciting."
She says she'll be happy "staying
at the same kind of job,"
throughout her career.
When Kosek started, she was
the only woman trainer certified
by the National Athletic Trainers

Association. Now there are 20,
some of whom learned under
Kosek at Washington.
And by the time her career is
over around the year 2010, she
may be remembered as "mother
of her profession." Or something
like that.
