# She gives great tape jobs...

OK, so some of the boys in the
locker room have had to clean up
their act a little. It's a small price
to pay for a good trainer. Even if
the trainer's a female.
And Sherry Kosek is a good
trainer.
She's professional, has
impressive credentials and is
candid about her role in the
university's athletic program. The
photographs on this page illustrate
an average day's work for the new
addition to the Stanford athletic
program.
The football players have no
complaints about the work she
does, either.
Nor does her presence
embarrass any of them. All they
have had to do is clean up their
act a little.
