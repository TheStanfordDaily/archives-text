The results of Stanford's recent
road trip were indeed mixed. At
Penn State, the dub suffered
through the usual first game blues
and was tagged with a 34-14
defeat.
Mike Cordova (lower right),
starting quarterback, carried a
reminder of the fierce Nittany
Lion defensive unit on his left arm
and was forced to retire from the
game ea. ly.


But the Cardinals put it
together in Ann Arbor the next
weekend versus the Michigan
Wolverines. Tony Hill dazzled a
crowd of over 90,000 with eight
catches, including a 25-yarder
(above left) for an important first
down.
And a young defense rose to
the occasion to put a stop to a
number of Michigan threats deep
in Cardinal territoro. Freshmen
like Jack Moller (85) and Bruce
Barker (84), a sophomore
(center), provided a number of
heroics while stopping the
Wolverines.
The team is beginning to gel.
