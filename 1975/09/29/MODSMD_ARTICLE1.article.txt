# Prof here examining Patty Hearst
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
Patricia Hearst is undergoing
psychiatric examination by Assoc.
Psychiatry Prof. Donald Lunde, one of
three analysts assigned to the case by a
federal judge last week.
Lunde has been involved in
numerous other court cases, including
the trials of three mass murderers, and
has written several articles on the use
of psychiatric testimony in court.
Hearst has spoken to Lunde, but he
is under court injunction to refrain
from discussing the case. He has been
unavailable for comment.
The defense
Defense attorneys announced last
week that they would argue that
Hearst was brainwashed and insane
during the time she was a fugitive.
During that time she allegedly
committed criminal acts, including
bank robbery and illegal use of
firearms.
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver J.
Carter decided not to rule on Hearst's
request for release on bail until after
she had been examined by a
psychiatrist.
Recently promoted to senior
attending physician and clinical
associate professor of psychiatry,
Lunde is also co-operating assistant
professor of psychiatry at the law
school. He was on sabbatical from the
Medical Center last year while he
taught in the law school and worked
on the development of a program in
law and psychiatry. This year he is
leading a clinical seminar entitled
"Trial of the Mentally Distressed
Criminal Defendant."
Lunde is court consultant
Lunde has served as a psychiatric
consultant to California superior
courts and as a consultant to both
district attorneys and public defenders
of several nearby counties.
He was a consultant in the Santa
Cruz mass murder trials of John Linley
Frazier, Herbert Mullin, Edmund
