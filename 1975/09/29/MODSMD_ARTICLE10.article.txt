# Solzhenitzyn challenges youth
## 
### 
Traveling in Europe this
summer, my wife and I
everywhere (except in old-timey
southern Ireland) noted the
jaded look of the young. The
lithe adolescents paraded
through the streets of Lucca in
the evening passeggiata with
bored expressions. Back in
California, we read in Art
Hoppe's column how sorry he
feels for his children, and all the
children, who no longer believe.
Hoppe thinks he knows the

reason: An overwhelming fate in
the form of corrupt, power-mad
governments and the ugly war in
Vietnam pulled the rug of faith
from under our sons and
daughters just as they were
approaching the crisis of
initiation into adulthood.
In strict opposition to this
commonly held view, Aleksandr
Solzhenitzyn accuses the
American youth of failing to rise
to a challenge in Vietnam as part
of a long-range struggle for

liberty; they refused "to bear
the pain and anguish of a
far-away war." He sees this
failure as an aspect of the
general Munich spirit — or, let's
face it, moral cowardice — which
is characteristic of our whole
era.
Here's a dilemma: few of the
educated will agree with him on
this point and yet few will deny
something like awe for this pure
sacrificial and brilliantly
prophetic figure. Raymond Aron
evidently experienced this
contradiction in his "Reply to
Solzhenitzyn" (Encounter,
September 1975) where he
praises him to the skies while
defending the "intellectuals of
the West [who] declined to see
absolute evil in the austere and
merciless regime of the North."
In other words, when it came
to the moment of truth, Aron
and the West generally could see
merit in existential
consciousness — mental
toughness, extreme realism — on
the Communist side, not on the
side of culture and freedom....
Youth Betrayed
This self-justifying double
standard, compounding with bad
faith the failure of nerve, could
account in large part for the
jaded look of the young and the
concomitant confusion of the
elders.
But the failure need not be
pinned down specifically to
Vietnam, even if that was
ultimately an impossible war
for the sensitive. If that deep
trial was rejected, then there had
to be an equally profound
substitute.
Some, like David Harris,
sensed this and sought
compensatory sacrifice in a jail
sentence. But on the whole at
this precise juncture the youth
merely drifted into
irresponsibility while the older
generation abdicated and
spiritually betrayed their
children, who can properly be
called "the abandoned
generation."
Realism Lost
In the United States, the
youth were fulsomely praised by
the grownups — I recall one
floridly liberal name screaming
"I'm one hundred and ten
percent on their side" — egged
on by power-hungry outsider
types. They were lied to about
life ("affluent society" indeed!)
and the true price of survival on
this planet.
In place of a realistic
perspective which saw Vietnam
as one of a series of ghastly
ordeals characteristic of
civilization (World Wars I and II
being obvious examples and far

worse) they were encouraged to
get "hung up" on this one Now
event and to feel terribly sorry
for themselves because the
police clubbed a few provocative
demonstrators.
Kent State was, of course, a
tragic affair, but even it was
blown up out of all proportion,
given the escalating
circumstances of mass violence
threatening anarchy, and again
the young were bolstered in
undue self-importance.
Everything was made easy for
them on the surface,
guaranteeing sheer anguish
underneath: from pushover
authorities and faculties through
cinch grading systems and loose
programs to flattering starting
salaries — and an overall flight
from form and civilized behavior
which has taken most of the
meaning out of cultyre,
education, sex and existence
itself. In short, they were
spoiled.
Solzhenitzyn can be wrong —
on detente, for example (pure
principles do not preclude
co-existent operational
principles of diplomacy, just as
church and state can, and had
better, co-exist)—but, currently,
as a deep moral guide to the
perplexed youth he can scarcely
be topped. A true humanist, we
could use him at Stanford.
