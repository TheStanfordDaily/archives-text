# Useless degree

Let all naive Stanford
students beware! The real world
awaits you with open fangs. As
an example of the ironies that
you will encounter when
graduating and finally leaving
the protection of your Alma
Mater, let me relate my present
dubious situation.
I get that coveted Bachelor's
degree and run full tilt to San
Francisco and make my way to
the financial district to look for
The Job. And, you guessed it, I
can't find that Ideal Job (you
know, up on the 20th floor, big
desk, decisions to make, vital
research to do).
I can't even find a job where I
don't need typing skills. Yup,
I'm a woman and what else is
new?
So I finally land a "training"
job with a securities firm. After
all the education I got from
Stanford, I now have to bust ass
for a lousy $575 a month to
get re-educated about the reality
of business as well as making a
nine to five broken record
become My Life.
Culture Shock
So finding myself in culture
shock, I decide that I want to
keep my ears to the ground
looking for that Ideal Job
(which by the way, ladies, is like
looking for Prince Charming,
which, if you've had your
consciousness raised, you will
know is the trap and
never-ending Tragedy Queen's
ticket to forever blue).
And what do I find! While
I'm struggling to keep myself in
nylon stockings, the Career,
Planning and Placement Center
wants to charge me $20 for
sending me the bulletin!
Now, you might not see the
outrage in this. Yes, I know the
Center provides an important
service, but....
My dad kindly put down the
bread to procure me a
membership as a Stanford
Alumnus — that ran a couple
hundred bucks. The degree itself
ran a couple thousand bucks and
now I'm being asked to fork out
$20 more for a service which I
think should be free.
'Useless' Degree
What is it, a "useless" degree
— and they're asking me to pay
for more!
So, clean-eared, bushy-tailed,
delightfully wholesome bunch of
folks, learn a lesson:
The old maxim, "Don't bite
the hand that feeds" no longer
applies. Rather, remember that
even Stanford isn't immune
from the economic crunch, and
you will feel it once you're out
of school.
Be good Scouts, and Be
Prepared, and as always — "Eat,
Drink and Be Merry, for
Tomorrow "

hundred bucks. The degree itself
ran a couple thousand bucks and
now I'm being asked to fork out
$20 more for a service which I
think should be free.
'Useless' Degree
What is it, a "useless" degree
— and they're asking me to pay
for more!
So, clean-eared, bushy-tailed,
delightfully wholesome bunch of
folks, learn a lesson:
The old maxim, "Don't bite
the hand that feeds" no longer
applies. Rather, remember that
even Stanford isn't immune
from the economic crunch, and
you will feel it once you're out
of school.
Be good Scouts, and Be
Prepared, and as always — "Eat,
Drink and Be Merry, for
Tomorrow "

Let all naive Stanford
students beware! The real world
awaits you with open fangs. As
an example of the ironies that
you will encounter when
graduating and finally leaving
the protection of your Alma
Mater, let me relate my present
dubious situation.
I get that coveted Bachelor's
degree and run full tilt to San
Francisco and make my way to
the financial district to look for
The Job. And, you guessed it, I
can't find that Ideal Job (you
know, up on the 20th floor, big
desk, decisions to make, vital
research to do).
I can't even find a job where I
don't need typing skills. Yup,
I'm a woman and what else is
new?
So I finally land a "training"
job with a securities firm. After
all the education I got from
Stanford, I now have to bust ass
for a lousy $575 a month to
get re-educated about the reality
of business as well as making a
nine to five broken record
become My Life.
Culture Shock
So finding myself in culture
shock, I decide that I want to
keep my ears to the ground
looking for that Ideal Job
(which by the way, ladies, is like
looking for Prince Charming,
which, if you've had your
consciousness raised, you will
know is the trap and
never-ending Tragedy Queen's
ticket to forever blue).
And what do I find! While
I'm struggling to keep myself in
nylon stockings, the Career,
Planning and Placement Center
wants to charge me $20 for
sending me the bulletin!
Now, you might not see the
outrage in this. Yes, I know the
Center provides an important
service, but....
My dad kindly put down the
bread to procure me a
membership as a Stanford
Alumnus — that ran a couple
hundred bucks. The degree itself
ran a couple thousand bucks and
now I'm being asked to fork out
$20 more for a service which I
think should be free.
