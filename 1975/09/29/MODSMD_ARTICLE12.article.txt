# Parking ripoffs
## 
### 
As an employee of Stanford,
I was recently given the choice
of parking in a lot located at an
inconvenient distance from my
work, or paying $40. Because I
cannot readily afford $40, I
reluctantly began parking in a
distant lot. Today, on my third
day of using this lot, I returned
to my car to find that both
headlights had been carefully
dismantled and removed. This
had been done between 7:30
a.m. and 5:30 p.m. in broad
daylight.
The cost of replacing the
headlight assemblies is in excess
of $100, and I cannot legally
drive the car without them. This
latter fact was told me by the
Stanford police, who also
described — by way of consoling
me — a wide variety of
automobile thefts and
dismantlings that have occurred
on the same lot recently.

David Edwards

They explained that financial
shortages and insufficient
manpower made effective
patroling of the parking lot,
particularly the more distant
ones, impossible, and that I
should count myself lucky that
my engine was still in place.
It is merely callous and
cynical to charge employees
exorbitant fees for convenient
parking at the place of their
employment. But it becomes
outrageous if the remote parking
lots of the "G" category are
allowed to remain open-air
warehouses for whatever thieves
happen to need spare
automobile parts. If this
continues, I hope and believe
that the Stanford community
will not tolerate it.
