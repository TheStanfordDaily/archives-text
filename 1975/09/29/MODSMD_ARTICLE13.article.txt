# Pick a bank... any bank
## Opening an account: check possibilities first 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
One of a student's first tasks
upon arriving on campus will be
to open a checking or savings
account at a local bank. It's a
good idea to at least open a
checking account right away —
most local merchants prefer, or
even require, checks from local
or in-state banks.
Most students, especially
those who live on campus, open
accounts at the Tresidder branch
of Wells Fargo Bank. The
location is convenient and the
bank offers services comparable
to some other banks in the area.
But to students who live off
campus, or who have easy
mobility, or who do a lot of
shopping at the various shopping
centers in the area, Wells Fargo
may not be the best bet.
The Bank of Tokyo's closest
branch is on El Camino in Palo
Alto; the statewide bank is in
the process of merging and will
soon be the First California
Bank.
They offer two checking
plans, neither of. which is
specifically geared to students.
The first is a "pay-by-check"
plan, for accounts with small
balances, and the charge is 13
cents per check. But most
depositers use the other plan:
keep a balance above $200 and
there's no service charge. Free
checks come with this plan, but
neither offers overdraft
protection.
Mastercharge is available, but
it's hard to get unless parents are
backing you financially.
Loan guidelines
Wayne Doiguchi, loan officer
at Tokyo, explains that their
guidelines for giving loans are
those set by the federal
government and are those that
most banks adhere to: a
customer must be a California
resident, a U.S. Citizen, can not
be a freshman and can not be
over 26 years of age. Interest is
seven percent per annum, and
undergraduates may borrow a

maximum of $2000, graduates
$3500. Their own requirements
say that you must deposit with
them one year prior to the loan.
And like all banks, Tokyo
pays five percent interest on
savings.
Bank of America has many
offices neighboring Stanford —
the closest branch is in the
Stanford Shopping Center. Their
student checking plan costs $1
per month with no minimum
balance, and in the summer it's
free. They have about 1400
Stanford student depositees.
It's also fairly easy to get a
Bankamericard. You must be 18,
a sophomore or above, have a
permanent address, $150 a
month income from daddy or
wherever and be a U.S. citizen.
Your Bankamericard can also
give you instant cash — $200 is
the limit. Bank of America
offers overdraft protection to
Bankamericard holders only.
Only the shopping center
branch participates in a student
loan program.
Bank of California
The Bank of California also
has many offices — the closest
are in Town and Country Village
and on Santa Cruz Avenue in
Menlo Park. The Page Mill office
does not handle student
accounts.
Their checking accounts for
students cost $1 a month;
there's no minimum balance or
service charges in the summer.
Kathy King Gibson, new
accounts representative, says
that there are no special
provisions with student plans —
because "students have no
credit," she explains.
She says that the bank only
has about 50 student accounts,
as "they're a new thing." She
adds that an alternate checking
plan that some students prefer
costs 15 cents per check.
Loans are a problem there —
in fact, you can't get a new one,
but you can renew an old one.
Gibson explains that the bank is

trying to phase out loans as
"many students go into
bankruptcy after they
graduate," and the bank loses.
Getting a Mastercharge here is
difficult too — "because most
students aren't working," she
says.
Camino
Camino California Bank is an
independent, statewide bank; its
nearest office is at the corner of
El Camino and California
Avenue.
They offer no student loans
or credit. Their checking
accounts cost nothing if you
keep a $100 balance, and if not,
cost $1 a month and eight cents
per check. There are no special
student services.
Security Pacific's closest
branches are at University
Avenue and Palo Alto Square.
Administrative assistant Joanne
Tobin says that the bank is the
second largest in the state and is
a national bank. Their student
checking plans depend on the
number of checks you write —
either 20 cents per check or $2 a
month, with no minimum
balance.
Getting a Mastercharge is
fairly easy — earn $150 a month
and keep a good pay record. The
Mastercharge acts as a check
guarantee card and gives up to
$100 ready reserve money.
They also offer federally
insured loans, for which you
must show some self-supporting
income to qualify.
Barclay's, in Mountain View
and Portola Valley, is a
California corporation and is
state chartered. They offer no
student loans, but waive service
charges for student checking
accounts — you pay to print the
checks. No credit cards are
available — to anyone.
United California Bank on
University Avenue has affiliated
banks in other states. Their
checking plan costs 60 cents per
month plus ten cents per check.
If you write less than ten checks

per month, the alternate plan
costs 15 cents per check.
Easy Mastercharge
Loans are only available to
grad students or those who've
had a previous loan says loan
officer Bill Chronert.
Mastercharge is available "if you
qualify." Chronert says the bank
has many student checking
accounts but few credit
accounts.
The Chartered Bank of
London, on El Camino in Los
Altos, is an international bank
with offices in the states and
Europe. They offer special
checking accounts to grad
students only — no service
charge with a $100 balance. If

the account is in good standing,
overdraft protection is offered.
Crocker has several Palo
Alto branches, one in the
Stanford shopping center, one in
Menlo Park and in England.
Loans are available if you've had
an account with them one year.
They offer two student
checking plans — $6 and $9
accounts. For $6 you get free
checks, unlimited check writing
and a quarterly statement. For
$9 you get the same but with a
monthly statement. And the
summer's free. If you have a
$2000 savings account, your
checking account is completely
free.
Mastercharge is available if

you can show some income and
is only offered to Stanford
students.
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo accounts costs $1
a month with no minimum
balance. Plain checks with no
address are free. There's no
overdraft protection. But with a
Mastercharge the bank will
deposit $50 in your account to
cover an overdraft from a $300
account.
Teller Joan Philips says if
you're not a junior or senior,
you're "not likely" to get a
Mastercharge, but you can get
credit of $100 to cover your
account.
Wells Fargo offers loans for

which you should go to the
financial aids office to see if you
qualify — a standard procedure
at many of the banks. Asst.
Financial Aids Director Ken
Kaufman says the application
for a Wells Fargo loan should be
completed 60 days after
registration.
Kaufman says that when
applying for loans at financial
aids office, it doesn't matter
where you bank — Wells Fargo
isn't given preference.
Bank representatives agree
that they like doing business
with students. As Gibson of
Bank of California puts it, "We
like students. They're reliable."
So take your pick.

which you should go to the

qualify — a standard procedure
at many of the banks. Asst.

for a Wells Fargo loan should be
completed 60 days after
registration.

CHECKING IT OUT—Students line up at Tresidder's branch of Wells Fargo Bank, waiting patiently (?) to open checking accounts. Wells
Fargo offers services comparable to other banks in the area, and is conveniently located for on-campus students, but it's worth it to check
out other banking possibilities.
One of a student's first tasks
upon arriving on campus will be
to open a checking or savings
account at a local bank. It's a
good idea to at least open a
checking account right away —
most local merchants prefer, or
even require, checks from local
or in-state banks.
Most students, especially
those who live on campus, open
accounts at the Tresidder branch
of Wells Fargo Bank. The
location is convenient and the
bank offers services comparable
to some other banks in the area.
But to students who live off
campus, or who have easy
mobility, or who do a lot of
shopping at the various shopping
centers in the area, Wells Fargo
may not be the best bet.
The Bank of Tokyo's closest
branch is on El Camino in Palo
Alto; the statewide bank is in
the process of merging and will
soon be the First California
Bank.
They offer two checking
plans, neither of. which is
specifically geared to students.
The first is a "pay-by-check"
plan, for accounts with small
balances, and the charge is 13
cents per check. But most
depositers use the other plan:
keep a balance above $200 and
there's no service charge. Free
checks come with this plan, but
neither offers overdraft
protection.
Mastercharge is available, but
it's hard to get unless parents are
backing you financially.
Loan guidelines
Wayne Doiguchi, loan officer
at Tokyo, explains that their
guidelines for giving loans are
those set by the federal
government and are those that
most banks adhere to: a
customer must be a California
resident, a U.S. Citizen, can not
be a freshman and can not be
over 26 years of age. Interest is
seven percent per annum, and
undergraduates may borrow a

maximum of $2000, graduates
$3500. Their own requirements
say that you must deposit with
them one year prior to the loan.
And like all banks, Tokyo
pays five percent interest on
savings.
Bank of America has many
offices neighboring Stanford —
the closest branch is in the
Stanford Shopping Center. Their
student checking plan costs $1
per month with no minimum
balance, and in the summer it's
free. They have about 1400
Stanford student depositees.
It's also fairly easy to get a
Bankamericard. You must be 18,
a sophomore or above, have a
permanent address, $150 a
month income from daddy or
wherever and be a U.S. citizen.
Your Bankamericard can also
give you instant cash — $200 is
the limit. Bank of America
offers overdraft protection to
Bankamericard holders only.
Only the shopping center
branch participates in a student
loan program.
Bank of California
The Bank of California also
has many offices — the closest
are in Town and Country Village
and on Santa Cruz Avenue in
Menlo Park. The Page Mill office
does not handle student
accounts.
Their checking accounts for
students cost $1 a month;
there's no minimum balance or
service charges in the summer.
Kathy King Gibson, new
accounts representative, says
that there are no special
provisions with student plans —
because "students have no
credit," she explains.
She says that the bank only
has about 50 student accounts,
as "they're a new thing." She
adds that an alternate checking
plan that some students prefer
costs 15 cents per check.
Loans are a problem there —
in fact, you can't get a new one,
but you can renew an old one.
Gibson explains that the bank is

trying to phase out loans as
"many students go into
bankruptcy after they
graduate," and the bank loses.
Getting a Mastercharge here is
difficult too — "because most
students aren't working," she
says.

Administrative assistant Joanne
Tobin says that the bank is the
second largest in the state and is
a national bank. Their student
checking plans depend on the
number of checks you write —
either 20 cents per check or $2 a
month, with no minimum
balance.
Getting a Mastercharge is
fairly easy — earn $150 a month
and keep a good pay record. The
Mastercharge acts as a check
guarantee card and gives up to
$100 ready reserve money.
They also offer federally
insured loans, for which you
must show some self-supporting
income to qualify.
Barclay's, in Mountain View
and Portola Valley, is a
California corporation and is
state chartered. They offer no
student loans, but waive service

available — to anyone.
United California Bank on
University Avenue has affiliated
banks in other states. Their
checking plan costs 60 cents per
month plus ten cents per check.
If you write less than ten checks

per month, the alternate plan
costs 15 cents per check.

The Chartered Bank of

overdraft protection is offered.

is only offered to Stanford
students.
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo accounts costs $1
a month with no minimum
balance. Plain checks with no
address are free. There's no
overdraft protection. But with a
Mastercharge the bank will
deposit $50 in your account to
cover an overdraft from a $300
account.
Teller Joan Philips says if
you're not a junior or senior,
you're "not likely" to get a
Mastercharge, but you can get
credit of $100 to cover your
account.

summer's free. If you have a
$2000 savings account, your
checking account is completely
free.
Mastercharge is available if

you can show some income and
is only offered to Stanford
students.
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo accounts costs $1
a month with no minimum
balance. Plain checks with no
address are free. There's no
overdraft protection. But with a
Mastercharge the bank will
deposit $50 in your account to
cover an overdraft from a $300
account.
Teller Joan Philips says if
you're not a junior or senior,
you're "not likely" to get a
Mastercharge, but you can get
credit of $100 to cover your
account.
Wells Fargo offers loans for

which you should go to the
financial aids office to see if you
qualify — a standard procedure
at many of the banks. Asst.
Financial Aids Director Ken
Kaufman says the application
for a Wells Fargo loan should be
completed 60 days after
registration.
Kaufman says that when

CHECKING IT OUT—Students line up at Tresidder's branch of Wells Fargo Bank, waiting patiently (?) to open checking accounts. Wells
Fargo offers services comparable to other banks in the area, and is conveniently located for on-campus students, but it's worth it to check
out other banking possibilities.
One of a student's first tasks
upon arriving on campus will be
to open a checking or savings
account at a local bank. It's a
good idea to at least open a
checking account right away —
most local merchants prefer, or
even require, checks from local
or in-state banks.
Most students, especially
those who live on campus, open
accounts at the Tresidder branch
of Wells Fargo Bank. The
location is convenient and the
bank offers services comparable
to some other banks in the area.
But to students who live off
campus, or who have easy
mobility, or who do a lot of
shopping at the various shopping
centers in the area, Wells Fargo
may not be the best bet.
The Bank of Tokyo's closest
branch is on El Camino in Palo
Alto; the statewide bank is in
the process of merging and will
soon be the First California
Bank.
They offer two checking
plans, neither of. which is
specifically geared to students.
The first is a "pay-by-check"
plan, for accounts with small
balances, and the charge is 13
cents per check. But most
depositers use the other plan:
keep a balance above $200 and
there's no service charge. Free
checks come with this plan, but
neither offers overdraft
protection.
Mastercharge is available, but
it's hard to get unless parents are
backing you financially.
Loan guidelines
Wayne Doiguchi, loan officer
at Tokyo, explains that their
guidelines for giving loans are
those set by the federal
government and are those that
most banks adhere to: a
customer must be a California
resident, a U.S. Citizen, can not
be a freshman and can not be
over 26 years of age. Interest is
seven percent per annum, and
undergraduates may borrow a

maximum of $2000, graduates
$3500. Their own requirements
say that you must deposit with
them one year prior to the loan.
And like all banks, Tokyo
pays five percent interest on
savings.
Bank of America has many
offices neighboring Stanford —
the closest branch is in the
Stanford Shopping Center. Their
student checking plan costs $1
per month with no minimum
balance, and in the summer it's
free. They have about 1400
Stanford student depositees.
It's also fairly easy to get a
Bankamericard. You must be 18,
a sophomore or above, have a
permanent address, $150 a
month income from daddy or
wherever and be a U.S. citizen.
Your Bankamericard can also
give you instant cash — $200 is
the limit. Bank of America
offers overdraft protection to
Bankamericard holders only.
Only the shopping center
branch participates in a student
loan program.
Bank of California
The Bank of California also
has many offices — the closest
are in Town and Country Village
and on Santa Cruz Avenue in
Menlo Park. The Page Mill office
does not handle student
accounts.
Their checking accounts for
students cost $1 a month;
there's no minimum balance or
service charges in the summer.
Kathy King Gibson, new
accounts representative, says
that there are no special
provisions with student plans —
because "students have no
credit," she explains.
She says that the bank only
has about 50 student accounts,
as "they're a new thing." She
adds that an alternate checking
plan that some students prefer
costs 15 cents per check.
Loans are a problem there —
in fact, you can't get a new one,
but you can renew an old one.
Gibson explains that the bank is

trying to phase out loans as
"many students go into
bankruptcy after they
graduate," and the bank loses.
Getting a Mastercharge here is
difficult too — "because most
students aren't working," she
says.

Administrative assistant Joanne
Tobin says that the bank is the
second largest in the state and is
a national bank. Their student
checking plans depend on the
number of checks you write —
either 20 cents per check or $2 a
month, with no minimum
balance.
Getting a Mastercharge is
fairly easy — earn $150 a month
and keep a good pay record. The
Mastercharge acts as a check
guarantee card and gives up to
$100 ready reserve money.
They also offer federally
insured loans, for which you
must show some self-supporting
income to qualify.
Barclay's, in Mountain View
and Portola Valley, is a
California corporation and is
state chartered. They offer no
student loans, but waive service
charges for student checking
accounts — you pay to print the
checks. No credit cards are
available — to anyone.
United California Bank on
University Avenue has affiliated
banks in other states. Their
checking plan costs 60 cents per
month plus ten cents per check.
If you write less than ten checks

per month, the alternate plan
costs 15 cents per check.
Easy Mastercharge
Loans are only available to
grad students or those who've
had a previous loan says loan
officer Bill Chronert.
Mastercharge is available "if you

has many student checking
accounts but few credit
accounts.
The Chartered Bank of
London, on El Camino in Los
Altos, is an international bank
with offices in the states and
Europe. They offer special
checking accounts to grad
students only — no service
charge with a $100 balance. If

the account is in good standing,
overdraft protection is offered.
Crocker has several Palo
Alto branches, one in the
Stanford shopping center, one in
Menlo Park and in England.
Loans are available if you've had
an account with them one year.
They offer two student

accounts. For $6 you get free

has many student checking
accounts but few credit
accounts.
The Chartered Bank of
London, on El Camino in Los
Altos, is an international bank
with offices in the states and
Europe. They offer special
checking accounts to grad
students only — no service
charge with a $100 balance. If

the account is in good standing,
overdraft protection is offered.
Crocker has several Palo
Alto branches, one in the
Stanford shopping center, one in
Menlo Park and in England.
Loans are available if you've had
an account with them one year.
They offer two student
checking plans — $6 and $9
accounts. For $6 you get free
checks, unlimited check writing
and a quarterly statement. For
$9 you get the same but with a
monthly statement. And the
summer's free. If you have a
$2000 savings account, your
checking account is completely
free.
Mastercharge is available if

you can show some income and
is only offered to Stanford
students.
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo accounts costs $1
a month with no minimum
balance. Plain checks with no
address are free. There's no
overdraft protection. But with a
Mastercharge the bank will
deposit $50 in your account to
cover an overdraft from a $300
account.
Teller Joan Philips says if
you're not a junior or senior,
you're "not likely" to get a
Mastercharge, but you can get
credit of $100 to cover your
account.
Wells Fargo offers loans for

which you should go to the
financial aids office to see if you
qualify — a standard procedure
at many of the banks. Asst.
Financial Aids Director Ken
Kaufman says the application
for a Wells Fargo loan should be
completed 60 days after
registration.
Kaufman says that when
applying for loans at financial
aids office, it doesn't matter
where you bank — Wells Fargo
isn't given preference.
Bank representatives agree
that they like doing business
with students. As Gibson of
Bank of California puts it, "We
like students. They're reliable."
So take your pick.


CHECKING IT OUT—Students line up at Tresidder's branch of Wells Fargo Bank, waiting patiently (?) to open checking accounts. Wells
Fargo offers services comparable to other banks in the area, and is conveniently located for on-campus students, but it's worth it to check
out other banking possibilities.
One of a student's first tasks
upon arriving on campus will be
to open a checking or savings
account at a local bank. It's a
good idea to at least open a
checking account right away —
most local merchants prefer, or
even require, checks from local
or in-state banks.
Most students, especially
those who live on campus, open
accounts at the Tresidder branch
of Wells Fargo Bank. The
location is convenient and the
bank offers services comparable
to some other banks in the area.
But to students who live off
campus, or who have easy
mobility, or who do a lot of
shopping at the various shopping
centers in the area, Wells Fargo
may not be the best bet.
The Bank of Tokyo's closest
branch is on El Camino in Palo
Alto; the statewide bank is in
the process of merging and will
soon be the First California
Bank.
They offer two checking
plans, neither of. which is
specifically geared to students.
The first is a "pay-by-check"
plan, for accounts with small
balances, and the charge is 13
cents per check. But most
depositers use the other plan:
keep a balance above $200 and
there's no service charge. Free
checks come with this plan, but
neither offers overdraft
protection.
Mastercharge is available, but
it's hard to get unless parents are
backing you financially.
Loan guidelines
Wayne Doiguchi, loan officer
at Tokyo, explains that their
guidelines for giving loans are
those set by the federal
government and are those that
most banks adhere to: a
customer must be a California
resident, a U.S. Citizen, can not
be a freshman and can not be
over 26 years of age. Interest is
seven percent per annum, and
undergraduates may borrow a

maximum of $2000, graduates
$3500. Their own requirements
say that you must deposit with
them one year prior to the loan.
And like all banks, Tokyo
pays five percent interest on
savings.
Bank of America has many
offices neighboring Stanford —
the closest branch is in the
Stanford Shopping Center. Their
student checking plan costs $1
per month with no minimum
balance, and in the summer it's
free. They have about 1400
Stanford student depositees.
It's also fairly easy to get a
Bankamericard. You must be 18,
a sophomore or above, have a
permanent address, $150 a
month income from daddy or
wherever and be a U.S. citizen.
Your Bankamericard can also
give you instant cash — $200 is
the limit. Bank of America
offers overdraft protection to
Bankamericard holders only.
Only the shopping center
branch participates in a student
loan program.
Bank of California
The Bank of California also
has many offices — the closest
are in Town and Country Village
and on Santa Cruz Avenue in
Menlo Park. The Page Mill office
does not handle student
accounts.
Their checking accounts for
students cost $1 a month;
there's no minimum balance or
service charges in the summer.
Kathy King Gibson, new
accounts representative, says
that there are no special
provisions with student plans —
because "students have no
credit," she explains.
She says that the bank only
has about 50 student accounts,
as "they're a new thing." She
adds that an alternate checking
plan that some students prefer
costs 15 cents per check.
Loans are a problem there —
in fact, you can't get a new one,
but you can renew an old one.
Gibson explains that the bank is

trying to phase out loans as
"many students go into
bankruptcy after they
graduate," and the bank loses.
Getting a Mastercharge here is
difficult too — "because most
students aren't working," she
says.
Camino
Camino California Bank is an
independent, statewide bank; its
nearest office is at the corner of
El Camino and California
Avenue.
They offer no student loans
or credit. Their checking
accounts cost nothing if you
keep a $100 balance, and if not,
cost $1 a month and eight cents
per check. There are no special
student services.
Security Pacific's closest
branches are at University
Avenue and Palo Alto Square.
Administrative assistant Joanne
Tobin says that the bank is the
second largest in the state and is
a national bank. Their student
checking plans depend on the
number of checks you write —
either 20 cents per check or $2 a
month, with no minimum
balance.
Getting a Mastercharge is
fairly easy — earn $150 a month
and keep a good pay record. The
Mastercharge acts as a check
guarantee card and gives up to
$100 ready reserve money.
They also offer federally
insured loans, for which you
must show some self-supporting
income to qualify.
Barclay's, in Mountain View
and Portola Valley, is a
California corporation and is
state chartered. They offer no
student loans, but waive service
charges for student checking
accounts — you pay to print the
checks. No credit cards are
available — to anyone.
United California Bank on
University Avenue has affiliated
banks in other states. Their
checking plan costs 60 cents per
month plus ten cents per check.
If you write less than ten checks

per month, the alternate plan
costs 15 cents per check.
Easy Mastercharge

grad students or those who've
had a previous loan says loan
