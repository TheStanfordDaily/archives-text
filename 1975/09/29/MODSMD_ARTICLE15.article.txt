# SWOPSI students pool resources helping at CAR
## 'Fireball on the deck' hugs, applauds kids, volunteers 
### KATHY BATTS 
A blind, deaf and retarded
youngster stands apprehensively
at the edge of a nine foot deep
swimming pool. Two young men
stand on either side of the boy.
Suddenly they grab him and toss
him gently into the-water where
another man waits, just in case.
The boy surfaces laughing. A
gray-haired woman rushes over,
applauding. "Good job," she
cries.
The woman is Betty Wright,
director of the swim program at
the Community Association for
the Retarded (CAR) in Palo
Alto. She is also the teacher of a
SWOPSI class at the pool.
Begun last winter, the class
was repeated in the spring. This
year's course proposal was
submitted to the SWOPSI board
Friday. Approval is expected by
the end of this week.
Entitled "Experienced-based
Study of the Meaning of Being
Handicapped," SWOPSI students
go through three 2-hour training
sessions and then spend one
hour each week in lecture and
four hours per week at the CAR
pool, working with handicapped
children.
Each session with a child lasts
one hour. Half the time is spent
working on swimming strokes
with the children, half is spent in

playing music and games. There
is also a short "diving time" in
which the children are
"persuaded" to either jump or
dive into the deep end.
Relaxing
"Water seems to do a lot to
relax the kids," says Jean
Maguire, a volunteer in the
spring SWOPSI class. "It makes
things easier for them and gives
them more confidence."
It doesn't take a special
person to volunteer at CAR.
Anyone with a spare hour who is
reasonably safe in deep water
may help out there. But it does
take a very special person to run
things. And Wright does it with
her own special brand of finesse.
Wright has been teaching
handicapped children to swim
since she was 13. At 14, she
designed the 86-degree CAR
pool, long before it became a
reality. She opened the pool at
CAR seven years ago.
Her office looks out on the
deck so l she can watch the
activity in the pool. Two
bulletin boards are covered with
pictures and newspaper
clippings, many of Stanford stars
Duncan McColl, Tom Lynn,
Drew Palin and Doc Blanchard.
All have been volunteers for her.
She smiles at her clippings. "I
don't even like football," she

laughs. "But they're so gentle
with these kids here."
Giggles . . . and tears
At poolside, a volunteer talks
to a little girl who has just
jumped into the deep end.
"Next time you can dive by
yourself." The girl giggles.
Another volunteer comforts
her tearful charge. "Cry for me,"
she says. "Let me see you cry as
hard as you can." The tears soon
subside.
"The SWOPSI kids last year
were just great," Wright says.
"Out of 188 volunteers, 44 were
from SWOPSI."

Her class seemed to think she
was pretty great, too. In a class
letter to her, they said "we will ,
never forget that fireball on the
deck hugging, screeching,
applauding, smooching and
loving."
Frustrations
"These [handicapped] kids
are full of frustrations," Wright
says. "Swimming is one thing
they can do fairly well."
"The water is a great
neutralizing medium," Maguire
adds. "Here no one's an
exception."
"There's nothing so great as
watching a kid make his first
crossing of the pool by himself."
Larry Cox, a staff member says.
Cox warns however, that the
program may not be for
everyone. "I knew one girl who
i came away depressed every time
j she was here. She couldn't
handle handicapped people.
"You run the whole gamut of
ages and handicaps here."
Abilities matched
Cox adds that the staff is

aware of both the volunteers'
and the students' abilities,
, matching teacher and pupil
appropriately.
A green sheet is prepared for
each child, with weekly progress
reports. Volunteers arrive a few
minutes before each session to
review their pupil for the day. It
helps to know if a young girl
likes to touch her teacher, but
doesn't like to be touched
herself. Or perhaps a difficult
boy won't seem to do what the
volunteer wants, until he thinks
he's not being watched.
"The SWOPSI group really
opened up doors for me,"
Maguire says."It was a chance
to get away from Stanford for
awhile.
"Everything at Stanford
always seems to be first person.
Sometimes I don't know who
benefits the most from this —
me or the kids."
Wright thinks it's the kids.
"Everything is sensory with
these kids," she says. "Once
they get a taste of this, they're
quite drunk with it."

to get away from Stanford for
awhile.
"Everything at Stanford
always seems to be first person.
Sometimes I don't know who
benefits the most from this —
me or the kids."
Wright thinks it's the kids.
"Everything is sensory with
these kids," she says. "Once
they get a taste of this, they're
quite drunk with it."

'FIREBALL' — CAR Director Betty Wright shares a laugh with staff member Sue Dueker. Popular
with staffers and voluntters alike, Wright opened up the pool seven years ago. She drew up the designs
for it when she was 14 years old.
A blind, deaf and retarded
youngster stands apprehensively
at the edge of a nine foot deep
swimming pool. Two young men
stand on either side of the boy.
Suddenly they grab him and toss
him gently into the-water where
another man waits, just in case.
The boy surfaces laughing. A
gray-haired woman rushes over,
applauding. "Good job," she
cries.
The woman is Betty Wright,
director of the swim program at
the Community Association for
the Retarded (CAR) in Palo
Alto. She is also the teacher of a
SWOPSI class at the pool.
Begun last winter, the class
was repeated in the spring. This
year's course proposal was
submitted to the SWOPSI board
Friday. Approval is expected by
the end of this week.
Entitled "Experienced-based
Study of the Meaning of Being
Handicapped," SWOPSI students
go through three 2-hour training
sessions and then spend one
hour each week in lecture and
four hours per week at the CAR
pool, working with handicapped
children.
Each session with a child lasts
one hour. Half the time is spent
working on swimming strokes
with the children, half is spent in

playing music and games. There
is also a short "diving time" in
which the children are
"persuaded" to either jump or
dive into the deep end.
Relaxing
"Water seems to do a lot to
relax the kids," says Jean
Maguire, a volunteer in the
spring SWOPSI class. "It makes
things easier for them and gives
them more confidence."
It doesn't take a special
person to volunteer at CAR.
Anyone with a spare hour who is
reasonably safe in deep water
may help out there. But it does
take a very special person to run
things. And Wright does it with
her own special brand of finesse.
Wright has been teaching
handicapped children to swim
since she was 13. At 14, she
designed the 86-degree CAR
pool, long before it became a
reality. She opened the pool at
CAR seven years ago.
Her office looks out on the
deck so l she can watch the
activity in the pool. Two
bulletin boards are covered with
pictures and newspaper
clippings, many of Stanford stars
Duncan McColl, Tom Lynn,
Drew Palin and Doc Blanchard.
All have been volunteers for her.
She smiles at her clippings. "I
don't even like football," she

laughs. "But they're so gentle
with these kids here."
Giggles . . . and tears
At poolside, a volunteer talks
to a little girl who has just
jumped into the deep end.
"Next time you can dive by
yourself." The girl giggles.
Another volunteer comforts
her tearful charge. "Cry for me,"
she says. "Let me see you cry as
hard as you can." The tears soon
subside.
"The SWOPSI kids last year
were just great," Wright says.
"Out of 188 volunteers, 44 were
from SWOPSI."

Her class seemed to think she
was pretty great, too. In a class
letter to her, they said "we will ,
never forget that fireball on the
deck hugging, screeching,
applauding, smooching and
loving."
Frustrations
"These [handicapped] kids
are full of frustrations," Wright
says. "Swimming is one thing
they can do fairly well."
"The water is a great
neutralizing medium," Maguire
adds. "Here no one's an
exception."
"There's nothing so great as
watching a kid make his first
crossing of the pool by himself."
Larry Cox, a staff member says.
Cox warns however, that the
program may not be for
everyone. "I knew one girl who
i came away depressed every time
j she was here. She couldn't
handle handicapped people.
"You run the whole gamut of
ages and handicaps here."
Abilities matched
Cox adds that the staff is

aware of both the volunteers'
and the students' abilities,
, matching teacher and pupil
appropriately.
A green sheet is prepared for
each child, with weekly progress
reports. Volunteers arrive a few
minutes before each session to
review their pupil for the day. It
helps to know if a young girl
likes to touch her teacher, but
doesn't like to be touched
herself. Or perhaps a difficult
boy won't seem to do what the
volunteer wants, until he thinks
he's not being watched.
"The SWOPSI group really
opened up doors for me,"
Maguire says."It was a chance
to get away from Stanford for
awhile.
"Everything at Stanford
always seems to be first person.
Sometimes I don't know who
benefits the most from this —

"You run the whole gamut of
ages and handicaps here."
Abilities matched
Cox adds that the staff is

aware of both the volunteers'
and the students' abilities,
, matching teacher and pupil
appropriately.
A green sheet is prepared for
each child, with weekly progress
reports. Volunteers arrive a few
minutes before each session to
review their pupil for the day. It
helps to know if a young girl
likes to touch her teacher, but
doesn't like to be touched
herself. Or perhaps a difficult
boy won't seem to do what the
volunteer wants, until he thinks
he's not being watched.
"The SWOPSI group really
opened up doors for me,"
Maguire says."It was a chance
to get away from Stanford for
awhile.
"Everything at Stanford
always seems to be first person.
Sometimes I don't know who
benefits the most from this —
me or the kids."
Wright thinks it's the kids.
"Everything is sensory with
these kids," she says. "Once
they get a taste of this, they're
quite drunk with it."

'FIREBALL' — CAR Director Betty Wright shares a laugh with staff member Sue Dueker. Popular
with staffers and voluntters alike, Wright opened up the pool seven years ago. She drew up the designs
for it when she was 14 years old.
A blind, deaf and retarded
youngster stands apprehensively
at the edge of a nine foot deep
swimming pool. Two young men
stand on either side of the boy.
Suddenly they grab him and toss
him gently into the-water where
another man waits, just in case.
The boy surfaces laughing. A
gray-haired woman rushes over,
applauding. "Good job," she
cries.
The woman is Betty Wright,
director of the swim program at
the Community Association for
the Retarded (CAR) in Palo
Alto. She is also the teacher of a
SWOPSI class at the pool.
Begun last winter, the class
was repeated in the spring. This
year's course proposal was
submitted to the SWOPSI board
Friday. Approval is expected by
the end of this week.
Entitled "Experienced-based
Study of the Meaning of Being
Handicapped," SWOPSI students
go through three 2-hour training
sessions and then spend one
hour each week in lecture and
four hours per week at the CAR
pool, working with handicapped
children.
Each session with a child lasts
one hour. Half the time is spent
working on swimming strokes
with the children, half is spent in

playing music and games. There
is also a short "diving time" in
which the children are
"persuaded" to either jump or
dive into the deep end.
Relaxing
"Water seems to do a lot to
relax the kids," says Jean
Maguire, a volunteer in the
spring SWOPSI class. "It makes
things easier for them and gives
them more confidence."
It doesn't take a special
person to volunteer at CAR.
Anyone with a spare hour who is
reasonably safe in deep water
may help out there. But it does
take a very special person to run
things. And Wright does it with
her own special brand of finesse.
Wright has been teaching
handicapped children to swim
since she was 13. At 14, she
designed the 86-degree CAR
pool, long before it became a
reality. She opened the pool at
CAR seven years ago.
Her office looks out on the
deck so l she can watch the
activity in the pool. Two
bulletin boards are covered with
pictures and newspaper
clippings, many of Stanford stars
Duncan McColl, Tom Lynn,
Drew Palin and Doc Blanchard.
All have been volunteers for her.
She smiles at her clippings. "I
don't even like football," she

laughs. "But they're so gentle
with these kids here."
Giggles . . . and tears
At poolside, a volunteer talks
to a little girl who has just
jumped into the deep end.
"Next time you can dive by
yourself." The girl giggles.
Another volunteer comforts
her tearful charge. "Cry for me,"
she says. "Let me see you cry as
hard as you can." The tears soon
subside.
"The SWOPSI kids last year
were just great," Wright says.
"Out of 188 volunteers, 44 were
from SWOPSI."

Her class seemed to think she
was pretty great, too. In a class
letter to her, they said "we will ,
never forget that fireball on the
deck hugging, screeching,
applauding, smooching and
loving."
Frustrations
"These [handicapped] kids
are full of frustrations," Wright
says. "Swimming is one thing
they can do fairly well."
"The water is a great
neutralizing medium," Maguire
adds. "Here no one's an
exception."
"There's nothing so great as
watching a kid make his first
crossing of the pool by himself."
Larry Cox, a staff member says.
Cox warns however, that the
program may not be for
everyone. "I knew one girl who
i came away depressed every time
j she was here. She couldn't
handle handicapped people.
"You run the whole gamut of
ages and handicaps here."
