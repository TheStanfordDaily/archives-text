# Officials say Gombe too dangerous
## Guerillas finally release kidnap victims 
### JANICE BRESSLER 
The University will no longer send
students to the Gombe Stream Research
Center in Tanzania, from which three
Stanford students and a Dutch research
assistant were kidnaped in May.
Released unharmed over the summer, all
four captives support the decision to close
the center to students.
Carrie Hunter, one of the kidnaped
students, said she felt it would be "unwise"
for any white person to work at the Gombe
facility. "The kidnapers looked on the
kidnaping as a business transaction, and
since it worked once they are likely to try it
again."
Although no students remain at the
center, it is still operating with Tanzanian
staffers doing the work formerly performed
by students.
Goodall
Dr. Jane Goodall, head of the center and
world authority on primate behavior, is
uncertain whether she will return to the
Gombe center, although she will continue
her research — both analysis of existing data
and further field work.
She will lecture here this quarter as she
has done in the past.
Hunter and the three other captives —
Barbara Smuts, Stephen Smith and Emilie
Bergmann — were seized by guerrillas of the
Popular Revolutionary Party (PRP) of
eastern Zaire on the night of May 19.
Smuts was released six days later with
demands for ransom, arms and the release
of political prisoners allegedly held in
Tanzania. Hunter and Bergmann were
released on June 28. Following the payment
of an undisclosed amount of ransom to the

kidnapers. Smith was freed on July
25 — 67 days after his capture.
Hamburg said the terms on which the
students were released remain secret by
mutual agreement with the PRP.
Newsweek report
Newsweek's report in its Sept. 1 issue,
that the University was involved in the
payment of a $400,000 ransom, was denied
later by University Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
Private individuals paid the ransom,
according to the University News Service.
In a press conference on campus
following the kidnaping, Smith, Smuts and
Hamburg thanked those whose "unceasing
efforts" helped free the students. All three
praised the "remarkable coordination and
leadership" of U.S. Ambassador to
Tanzania, W. Beverly Carter.
Possible demotion
The New York Times later reported that
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger might
demote Carter for his role in freeing the
captives. Carter's scheduled appointment as
ambassador to Denmark, the Times said,
had been withdrawn. Kissinger told
reporters that State Department policy
forbids negotiating with terrorists or paying
random.
Smith told the San Francisco Examiner
he and the other captives would do what
they could "to persuade anyone we can that
the ambassador did an incredible job against
terrible odds."
Kissinger afterwards promised at a
meeting with members of the Congressional
Black Caucus, who had questioned
Kissinger's action, that "nothing will be
done to impede his (Carter's) career."

In a telephone interview with the
University News Service, Smith attributed
the kidnaping to the PRP's desire for
international publicity. The rebel group was
"not known at all" before the abduction, he
said.
"Although our time in Africa both
before and during our captivity, has made
us much more aware of the problems facing
African people today," Smuts said, "we do
not feel that kidnaping is ever justified."
Adapt or die
Hunter, in an interview, said having
studied chimps was helpful during captivity.
"We recognized that those who don't adapt,
don't survive. That sort of perspective was
very important to us."
Throughout the kidnaping the captives
were concerned that they might be harmed,
but they said after their release they had
been treated well.
"We were kept comfortably," said
Smith. "The beds weren't eiderdown
mattresses, but they were adequate. The
food was good — chicken, fish, rice and
dishes based on kasava. Once in a while we
had coffee, kind of as a present. During the
last week I was especially well treated," he
remarked.
Asked what helped most during
captivity, Smith said, "The combination of
people was really important. We were very
supportive of each other. We worked to
cheer each other up. There was always
somebody in high spirits."
A reunion of all four captives is
scheduled for some time this month on
campus. None of the students plan to return
to Africa in the near future but all are still
interested in studying animal behavior.
