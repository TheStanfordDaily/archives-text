# Our coach Chris needs a quarterback too!

### 
First-year Stanford Thunderturkey
coach Chris Baker has a problem that
only you can solve. It's not unlike the
predicament of another coach Chris.
He has to find a quarterback for the
Daily's four-time Southern Division
champion touch football team. He's
looked at two candidates so far, but he's

waiting until Oct. 11 when the Daily
opens defense of its Pac-8 football crown
against the UCLA Daily Bruin.
But Chris has a more important prob
lem. In order for the Daily to have a foot
ball team there has to be a Daily. And in
order to put out a newspaper we need
reporters. Our opponents demand that

each player be a member of the staff. Last
year, UCLA's Daily Bruin took one look at
Chris and asked how many by-lines he'd
had in the paper.
No previous journalism experience is
