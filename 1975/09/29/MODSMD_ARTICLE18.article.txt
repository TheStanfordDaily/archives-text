# 'Course Guide' just OK, 'Masks' mystifies
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Every new school year brings
scores of "new" or "improved"
publications from every segment
of the University community.
This year's crop includes two
worthy of particular mention:
the ASSU Course Guide and
Masks: Politics, The Arts, 8r
Technology.
The Course Guide, latest in a
series of ASSU publications in
tended to assist students in
selecting courses, will undoub
tedly appeal to the wider audi
ence. Years ago, in response to
student demand for something
other than Courses and Degrees
to aid in evaluating and choos
ing courses, the administration
began providing Course
Abstracts,
The ASSU cast about for sev
eral years in search of a useful
method of measuring student
reaction to courses. Since then,
students have produced several
generations of "improved"
Course Reviews, one Guerilla,
and now, the Course Guide.
Unfortunately, although the
Guide will certainly prove valu
able in learning how other stu
dents have responded to courses
and will aid in course selection,
it can not honestly be called
either "new" or "improved."
True it will publish three edi
tions a year, one for each
quarter's courses, and will try to
provide some input about new
courses as well as old.
But the mistakes made by
former Review editors have been
continued by the Guide's Lance
Friedmann. Quality and length
of reviews vary widely.
And the statistical ratings,
mostly on a scale of 0 to 4 (not
unlike a grade point average),
remain confusing. For example.
History Prof. Frederick Bowser
received a 3.05 rating for en

thusiasm in teaching his History
176 course. Since the average
score for instructors on that
question was 3.69, does that
mean Bowser's enthusiasm is
low, even though a value of "3"
supposedly corresponds to
"good"? The management's at
tempts to eliminate these prob
lems in the introduction fails.
The questionnaire has not
been significantly altered. Al
though a statistician pointed out
to the editors of the Review three
years ago that an even number of
possible responses would yield
more meaningful results than an
odd one (because people tend to
pick the middle choice), the odd
number persists for all ques
tions.
But despite these flaws, prop
erly used, the Guide should re
main a valuable if tricky weapon
in each student's arsenal as he
girds himself for the academic
wars.

Musks is the long-promised,
and to some extent, long
awaited journal of "politics, the
arts and technology," promoted
almost single-handedly by Alan
VVarhaftig for two years.
Certainly the most physically
appealing of the new publica
tions, printed on high-quality
glossy paper and attractively il
lustrated, Masks purports to be a
forum for "the elite intellectual"
revolutionary. With an impres
sive list of contributors and as
sociates, Musks goes a long way
toward fulfilling that purpose.
But the first issue, although
well written and compelling,
falls short of reaching that goal.
A painfully obvious problem for
the journal becomes evident
from a glance at the title page:
VVarhaftig authored or co
authored four of the eight arti
cles and artistic critiques in the

first issue.
The reader waits in vain for an
article from one of the impres
sive list of names under "Friends
and Associates." Only English
Prof. John Felstiner from that list
contributed to the first issue, and
his "In Translation," a fascinat-

The prose quality is generally
high, although the authors,
especially Felstiner and VVarhaf
tig occasionally allow their
self-professed intellectualism to
get the better of them, and the
prose becomes pretentious. In
general, however, this problem

is not serious, and in George
Beckford's economic analysis of
"The Anglophone Caribbean," it
is not even noticeable.
The publication, already in fi
nancial trouble, plans ai least
two more issues, a sampling of
critiques of the first issue, and a

third issue much like the first.
Masks is a good idea not yet gone
wrong, but not necessarily gone
right, either. So although it
could provide a much-needed
dialogue, the journal must im
prove in the areas indicated in
order to survive.

courses as well as old.
But the mistakes made by
former Review editors have been
continued by the Guide's Lance
Friedmann. Quality and length
of reviews vary widely.
And the statistical ratings,
mostly on a scale of 0 to 4 (not
unlike a grade point average),
remain confusing. For example.
History Prof. Frederick Bowser
received a 3.05 rating for en

thusiasm in teaching his History
176 course. Since the average
score for instructors on that
question was 3.69, does that
mean Bowser's enthusiasm is
low, even though a value of "3"
supposedly corresponds to
"good"? The management's at
tempts to eliminate these prob
lems in the introduction fails.
The questionnaire has not
been significantly altered. Al
though a statistician pointed out
to the editors of the Review three
years ago that an even number of
possible responses would yield
more meaningful results than an
odd one (because people tend to
pick the middle choice), the odd
number persists for all ques
tions.
But despite these flaws, prop
erly used, the Guide should re
main a valuable if tricky weapon
in each student's arsenal as he
girds himself for the academic
wars.

Musks is the long-promised,
and to some extent, long
awaited journal of "politics, the
arts and technology," promoted
almost single-handedly by Alan
VVarhaftig for two years.
Certainly the most physically
appealing of the new publica
tions, printed on high-quality
glossy paper and attractively il
lustrated, Masks purports to be a
forum for "the elite intellectual"
revolutionary. With an impres
sive list of contributors and as
sociates, Musks goes a long way
toward fulfilling that purpose.
But the first issue, although
well written and compelling,
falls short of reaching that goal.
A painfully obvious problem for
the journal becomes evident
from a glance at the title page:
VVarhaftig authored or co
authored four of the eight arti
cles and artistic critiques in the

first issue.
The reader waits in vain for an
article from one of the impres
sive list of names under "Friends
and Associates." Only English
Prof. John Felstiner from that list
contributed to the first issue, and
his "In Translation," a fascinat-

The prose quality is generally
high, although the authors,
especially Felstiner and VVarhaf
tig occasionally allow their
self-professed intellectualism to
get the better of them, and the
prose becomes pretentious. In
general, however, this problem

is not serious, and in George
Beckford's economic analysis of
"The Anglophone Caribbean," it
is not even noticeable.
The publication, already in fi
nancial trouble, plans ai least
two more issues, a sampling of
critiques of the first issue, and a

third issue much like the first.
Masks is a good idea not yet gone
wrong, but not necessarily gone
right, either. So although it
could provide a much-needed
dialogue, the journal must im
prove in the areas indicated in
order to survive.
Every new school year brings
scores of "new" or "improved"
publications from every segment
of the University community.
This year's crop includes two
worthy of particular mention:
the ASSU Course Guide and
Masks: Politics, The Arts, 8r
Technology.
The Course Guide, latest in a
series of ASSU publications in
tended to assist students in
selecting courses, will undoub
tedly appeal to the wider audi
ence. Years ago, in response to
student demand for something
other than Courses and Degrees
to aid in evaluating and choos
ing courses, the administration
began providing Course
Abstracts,
The ASSU cast about for sev
eral years in search of a useful
method of measuring student
reaction to courses. Since then,
students have produced several
generations of "improved"
Course Reviews, one Guerilla,
and now, the Course Guide.
Unfortunately, although the
Guide will certainly prove valu
able in learning how other stu
dents have responded to courses
and will aid in course selection,
it can not honestly be called
either "new" or "improved."
True it will publish three edi
tions a year, one for each
quarter's courses, and will try to
provide some input about new
