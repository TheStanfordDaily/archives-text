# Cronkite: public impatient for change
## 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
Walter Cronkite said yesterday that modern
man must break out of his "chamber of horrors"
and overhaul law, government and commerce
throughout the world.
Cronkite said there is a cry for change.
"Impatience is growing from Boston to
Bangladesh. Perhaps some of what Abbie
Hoffman and Spiro Agnew said may have been
worth listening to," he noted.
The United States has the strength and unity
to meet the challenge, he said, telling the student
audience, "This is your revolution."
Cronkite urged students to look to the
American Revolution, to the power of the ideas
that conceived it, for "the fundamentals of your
revolution."
"Common and unselfish effort'
"Common and unselfish effort are the
principles that made this country great," he said.
Cronkite directed students to "do your job
well here, and you'll be ready for leadership. I
envy you the glorious experience ahead."
In response to a question from the audience,
Cronkite said Senate Bill (5.8.) 1 poses
"heinous threats" to the freedom of speech and
press. "Every journalist quakes in terror over the
possibility that it could become law."
S.B. 1
S. B. 1 would allow the government to
install wiretapes for up to 48 hours without a
court order. It would also subject journalists to
criminal penalties if they possess or publish the
contents of any government report without
official permission, or if they publish any
statement "likely to create general panic or
serious disruption."
The bill, if it becomes law, would also subject
present or former government employees to
penalties if they give the news media any
classified information without approval from

their superiors.
A second questioner asked if Cronkite sees the
United States government as essentially
"government by crisis." Cronkite commented
that this may be true, given the communication
explosion which makes it difficult to focus on an
issue until it reaches the crisis point.
'NRA rules by terror'
Cronkite said he is "baffled" by the National
Rifle Association's (NRA) lobbying power. When
asked how the NRA can hold Congress in
abeyance, Cronkite said, "The NRA rules by
terror." He said there are "bad examples" where
Congressmen lost elections while backing gun
control.

One member of the audience questioned the
news coverage of Lynette Fromme, wondering if
information regarding a fifth-grade teacher was
relevant to the case. Cronkite replied that no
event can be over-reported, but it can be
overplayed.
When asked about his feeling regarding the
CBS practice of paying for interviews such as the
H.R. Haldeman interview with Mike Wallace,
Cronkite stated that networks should not be
permitted to buy a front-page news story.
He alluded to Nixon's autobiography, saying
that withholding information from the American
people while serving them and then selling it to
them afterward was "despicable."

'NRA rules by terror'
Cronkite said he is "baffled" by the National
Rifle Association's (NRA) lobbying power. When
asked how the NRA can hold Congress in
abeyance, Cronkite said, "The NRA rules by
terror." He said there are "bad examples" where
Congressmen lost elections while backing gun
control.

One member of the audience questioned the
news coverage of Lynette Fromme, wondering if
information regarding a fifth-grade teacher was
relevant to the case. Cronkite replied that no
event can be over-reported, but it can be
overplayed.
When asked about his feeling regarding the
CBS practice of paying for interviews such as the
H.R. Haldeman interview with Mike Wallace,
Cronkite stated that networks should not be
permitted to buy a front-page news story.
He alluded to Nixon's autobiography, saying
that withholding information from the American
people while serving them and then selling it to
them afterward was "despicable."

THE WAY IT IS—CBS newscaster Walter Cronkite acknowledges a standing ovation following his
speech yesterday at Memorial Auditorium. A packed house heard Cronkite speak on The
Challenge Ahead."
Walter Cronkite said yesterday that modern
man must break out of his "chamber of horrors"
and overhaul law, government and commerce
throughout the world.
Cronkite said there is a cry for change.
"Impatience is growing from Boston to
Bangladesh. Perhaps some of what Abbie
Hoffman and Spiro Agnew said may have been
worth listening to," he noted.
The United States has the strength and unity
to meet the challenge, he said, telling the student
audience, "This is your revolution."
Cronkite urged students to look to the
American Revolution, to the power of the ideas
that conceived it, for "the fundamentals of your
revolution."
"Common and unselfish effort'
"Common and unselfish effort are the
principles that made this country great," he said.
Cronkite directed students to "do your job
well here, and you'll be ready for leadership. I
envy you the glorious experience ahead."
In response to a question from the audience,
Cronkite said Senate Bill (5.8.) 1 poses
"heinous threats" to the freedom of speech and
press. "Every journalist quakes in terror over the
possibility that it could become law."
S.B. 1
S. B. 1 would allow the government to
install wiretapes for up to 48 hours without a
court order. It would also subject journalists to
criminal penalties if they possess or publish the
contents of any government report without
official permission, or if they publish any
statement "likely to create general panic or
serious disruption."
The bill, if it becomes law, would also subject
present or former government employees to
penalties if they give the news media any
classified information without approval from

their superiors.
A second questioner asked if Cronkite sees the
United States government as essentially
"government by crisis." Cronkite commented
that this may be true, given the communication
explosion which makes it difficult to focus on an
issue until it reaches the crisis point.
