# Students asked for funds
## ASSU rebuilds boathouse 
### BILL MacDOUGALL 
The ASSU Financial Manager's Office is trying
to keep the Lagunita Boathouse afloat.
Students are circulating petitions today and
tomorrow to get a $1 fee assessment for the
boathouse on the Oct. 15 and 16 ASSU Senate
election ballot.
The money would be used to finance
improvements to the boathouse, ASSU Financial
Manager Chris Cline said.
"We would like to make the boathouse live up
to its potential," he remarked.
Two Stages
Cline plans to renovate the boathouse in two
stages — improvements of existing facilities and
construction of new facilities.
This summer Cline used $30,000, collected
equally from the Provost's Office and ASSU
reserves, to begin correcting the 29 safety code
violations which caused the condemnation of the
boathouse in 1969.
The fee assessment money would be used to
pay for new facilities.
Summer work
Cline said public locker rooms and showers
were built this summer. The work is almost
finished he claimed; only some finishing work
outside remains incomplete.
The second phase of improvements would
include wooden floats for sunbathing extending
from the boathouse, new sand for the beach,
barbecue pits and possibly a sand volleyball court.
Cline said the improvements would be built
almost completely with paid student labor. Palo
Alto contractor David French, who has organized

similar projects with unskilled labor, would be
hired for the renovation.
Cline added that because construction
experience would not be required, the job would
provide a "learning experience" for the student
workers.
The Financial Manager's Office needs to
collect 1100 signatures to be included on the
ballot. If the measure passes, work would begin
immediately and would be completed in two or
three weeks.
Executive Assistant to the Provost Edward
Shaw said that his office would be willing to
advance the ASSU money for the project until
the assessment is collected spring quarter. The fee
assessment would be included in spring
registration fees.
'Permanent lake'
The ASSU had considered over the summer
making Lake Lagunita a permanent lake, but
tabled the idea due to the high cost of such a
proposal.
Shaw said his office would be studying the
idea this quarter, adding that he would "like to
do it tomorrow for aesthetic and recreational
reasons."
But, he added, "the dilemma is again money."
He estimated the project would cost "several
hundred of thousands of dollars."
Shaw did not feel he could justify such an
expense "in days when we're reducing funds for
scholarships" and academic programs.
Shaw added that passage of the fee assessment
would be a "major signal to University planners"
as to what students "think of the lake in general."

to keep the Lagunita Boathouse afloat.
Students are circulating petitions today and
tomorrow to get a $1 fee assessment for the
boathouse on the Oct. 15 and 16 ASSU Senate
election ballot.
The money would be used to finance
improvements to the boathouse, ASSU Financial
Manager Chris Cline said.
"We would like to make the boathouse live up
to its potential," he remarked.
Two Stages
Cline plans to renovate the boathouse in two
stages — improvements of existing facilities and
construction of new facilities.
This summer Cline used $30,000, collected
equally from the Provost's Office and ASSU
reserves, to begin correcting the 29 safety code
violations which caused the condemnation of the
boathouse in 1969.
The fee assessment money would be used to
pay for new facilities.
Summer work
Cline said public locker rooms and showers
were built this summer. The work is almost
finished he claimed; only some finishing work
outside remains incomplete.
The second phase of improvements would
include wooden floats for sunbathing extending
from the boathouse, new sand for the beach,
barbecue pits and possibly a sand volleyball court.
Cline said the improvements would be built
almost completely with paid student labor. Palo
Alto contractor David French, who has organized

similar projects with unskilled labor, would be
hired for the renovation.
Cline added that because construction
experience would not be required, the job would
provide a "learning experience" for the student
workers.
The Financial Manager's Office needs to
collect 1100 signatures to be included on the
ballot. If the measure passes, work would begin
immediately and would be completed in two or
three weeks.
Executive Assistant to the Provost Edward
Shaw said that his office would be willing to
advance the ASSU money for the project until
the assessment is collected spring quarter. The fee
assessment would be included in spring
registration fees.
'Permanent lake'
The ASSU had considered over the summer
making Lake Lagunita a permanent lake, but
tabled the idea due to the high cost of such a
proposal.
Shaw said his office would be studying the
idea this quarter, adding that he would "like to
do it tomorrow for aesthetic and recreational
reasons."
But, he added, "the dilemma is again money."
He estimated the project would cost "several
hundred of thousands of dollars."
Shaw did not feel he could justify such an
expense "in days when we're reducing funds for
scholarships" and academic programs.
Shaw added that passage of the fee assessment
would be a "major signal to University planners"
as to what students "think of the lake in general."
