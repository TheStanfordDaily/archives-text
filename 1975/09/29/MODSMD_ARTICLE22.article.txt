# Ford plan sparks controversy
## 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
In his speech at the Law
School, President Ford talked at
length about the new Privacy
Act which went into effect last
week.
The Stanford community
held divergent views on the act
which prohibits the collection of
information regarding an
individual's exercise of his First
Amendment rights. It specifies
that personal files should be
"accurate, relevant, timely,
complete."
The federal government, it
states, must reveal the
whereabouts of all data systems
with identifiable personal
information. Everyone has the
right to read his own file and to
make corrections or
amendments.
In addition to these
provisions the law calls for the
establishment of an independent
privacy commission with a two
year mandate to monitor the
operation of the law and to
investigate additional privacy
rules.
"Ford's Right of Privacy Act?
It'll be ineffective," said one
student demonstrator. "For
Ford, it's public relations. It's in
his interest to see that the
Privacy Commission doesn't get
the important information. And
then of course the staff will be
under political pressure from the
White House for its funding and
directors. Besides, it's
historically true that
investigative commissions are
corrupted by the bodies they
investigate."
A Stanford law professor
said: "That [the act] is an
overbroad and unduly cynical
view of how government works.
All information is not in the
White House. The Privacy Act
pertains to routine files,
information like taxes,
scholarships and welfare, not
just national security."
Rep. Paul McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) was impressed
with the content and theme of
Ford's address. He felt that it
was "a scholarly discussion of
the law and its history" and that
it was an "inspiration to me, the
theme of an individual's right to
do his own thing, protected
from pressures to make him less
of an individual — it's an
exciting theme. The restoration
of the dignity of the individual
and freedom from restraints."
Both the Freedom of
Information Act and the Right
of Privacy act came out of a
house sub-committee headed by
McCloskey. He believes them to

be two of the most
important bills passed by
Congress this year.
McCloskey emphasized that
the Act is experimental. "We
don't know yet what the
bureaucratic experience will be
in implementing the law. We
need to observe the bugs. We
don't yet know the cost."
McCloskey mentioned that
one of the provisions of the bilL,
that government officials are
now liable for injuring private
citizens in the course of doing
their jobs, is an important
milestone.
As for the commission, "It's
very important who is
appointed. It's very important
that Congress oversee that sort
of thing."

"Ford's on the right tiack,"
said Law Prof. Gerald Gunther.
"The issue is a matter of
concern. I can applaud the
President here where I can't on
some of his other policies."
Gunther expressed concern
over the possibility of cost
acting as a deterrent.
"The privacy law afects
individuals instead of interest
groups," said Gunther. Large
interest groups would be able to
pay for file additions or
deletions, while individuals may
find it difficult to foot the bill.
Gunther suggested a system
similar to that used in filing
petitions to appeal in the courts.
An individual might obtain an
affidavit declaring his inability
to pay for the service, in which
case the government assumes
responsibility for the cost.
Gunther also mentioned that
the law would probably be
subject to "some broad national
security exceptions."

Dave Moskowitz, a
demonstration organizer, said,
"The speech was a lot of
politics. The FBI kept harrassing
me, following me around the
city, trying to intimidate me in a
subtle way. How can you talk
about privacy when the FBI
agents were harrassing me?
"The ruling class control
depends on snooping," he
added. Moskowitz believes that
the cost of obtaining and
changing files will be high. "The
Freedom of Information Act is
not free at all."
Moskowitz said that there is
"no way the bureaucratic
commission can enforce a law.
The government is so vast that
no one can keep up with what's
going on."
