# Police empty Columbae

Demonstrators, making
banners in Columbae House on
Sept. 21, the day President
Ford spoke on campus, were
frisked, told to leave the house
and had one of their banners
confiscated for security
reasons, according to students
and Santa Clara County Sheriff
Department Lieutenant Ken
Hart.
Tom Wainwright, a student
living in Columbae, said he and
a friend had gone to Columbae
to pick up some banners. As
they were passing some Santa
Clara County sheriff deputies, *
the deputies told them to stop,
took their banners, put the
banners in Columbae and
ordered the demonstrators to
leave the house.
According to Wainwright,
the deputies then entered
Columbae and frisked the two
men who were inside. They did
not frisk a woman who was
also in the house because they
did not have a female officer,
Wainwright said.
"They told us the house did
not open until the 25th and
they threatened to prosecute
us for burglary," Wainwright
said. They also confiscated one
of the banners.
Had to be cleared
Hart confirmed that the
incident took place. He
explained that "all houses in
the immediate perimeter of the
President's route had to be

cleared and there were people
in Columbae."
Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton was
notified to clear the students
out of the building after the
deputies discovered them.
However, Horton said no
students were in Columbae by
the time he arrived.
No one contacted knew
who authorized the deputies'
evacuation demand. Stanford
Police Capt. Walter Konar, in
charge of intelligence and the
Secret Service for Ford's

speech, speculated that the
deputies probably authorized
themselves.
Hart explained that he had
been informed that none of the
residences were to be open
until Sept. 25, and he thought
the people were inside
Columbae illegally.
'Hazy' date
Horton said that technically
the houses were not open until
Sept. 22, however, "the exact
opening date is always hazy."
Hart could not explain why
the banner was confiscated.
"It's hard to say. I really don't

know why it was confiscated,"
he said. Considering the
deputies' assumption of the
opening date of Columbae,
they probably took it as a
"possible item of evidence"
thai the demonstrators had no
right to be in the house, Hart
suggested.
Konar said he did not know
how a banner could be used as
evidence of trespassing.
Konar remarked that the
deputies were probably
overreacting to their
assignment to protect the
President.
They had been told to be
aware of suspicious persons. In
fact, the security forces at the
speech had been given the
description of Sara Jane
Moore, the woman who shot at
Ford the next day in San
Francisco, Capt. William
O'Connor of the San Francisco
Police Department confirmed
Friday.
Gary Thorne, the Resident
Assistant ( RA ) in Columbae,
told the Daily that clothes in
the house had been rummaged
through and a door latch had
been broken to open a locked
door during the evacuation
period.
Neither Konar nor Hart had
heard of or could justify a
search of the house. The
University will pay to repair
the latch, according to
University Housing Asst.
Manager Chester Choy.

BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING - Security men eye the Stanford
audience during the Ford speech. They were easily distinguished
from the crowd in their suits and ties and a pin on the coat lapel or
breast pocket.
