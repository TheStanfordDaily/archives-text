# Housing ready for occupancy

The Florence Moore
residence hall room additions
and the Pearce-Mitchell emeriti
housing complex are ready for
occupancy, according to Faculty
Housing Director Robert
Summers and Assoc. Dean for
Student Affairs Larry Horton.
Located on Campus Drive
between Mayfield Avenue and
Salvatierra Street, the 82 units
to house faculty members and

their families are "90 percent
complete," according to
Summers' office. Landscaping
and other finishing touches will
probably continue through most
of October.
The 100 new rooms in
Florence Moore Hall, costing
$1.3 million, were completed
this summer for student
occupancy. The rooms are
furnished with a short shag
carpet, outlets for a television
antenna and a new fan and

heating system.
The construction of the new
rooms in Florence Moore caused
inconveniences for last year's
residents of the dormitory.
Students complained of
excessive noise early in the
morning as well as exhaust
fumes from trucks and other
motorized equipment during
construction of the new units.
Residents of the new Flo Mo
rooms were generally pleased
with the arrangement. "I think it
[the new room] is great," said
Chuck Evans. "It's the best place
in the whole damn school.
Everything is new — it's just like
home."
Lucy Corral "really liked"
her new room, but thought that
it was "kind of small." In her
words, it was "a definite
improvement over Wilbur
[Hall]."
Freshman Barbara Anscher
said, "It's great as compared to
what I had expected. This is so
large and so cheerful."
In addition, three new Row
Houses, which will house
approximately 50 students

each, are being built across the
street from the Beta Theta Pi
and Bacon Houses on Campus
Drive.
Two of the houses will be
named the Robert Moore
houses. The third house is as yet
unnamed, Horton said. The
houses are scheduled to be
completed one year from now.
The emeriti housing
condominiums, Summers said,
are on sale for between $30,000
and $70,000. Forty-two of the
units have been sold, with none
of the official paper work on the
sales complete. Most private
developers, according to
Summers, would not expect to
have half of their units sold by
the time of completion.
The housing project is
available only to faculty and
staff eligible to buy single family
homes on campus who do not
have children under the age of
18 living with them.
The project is aimed at
freeing on-campus housing for
faculty and staff with children
while retaining senior and
emeriti faculty on the campus.
