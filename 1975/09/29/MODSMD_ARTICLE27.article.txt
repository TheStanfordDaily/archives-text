# 300 students remain on housing wait lists
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
There are still 300 people on
fall quarter waiting lists for
on-campus housing, Sue
Espinosa, director of single
student housing assignments,
reported this weekend.
Of those who participated in
last spring's housing draw, 108
women and 192 men have
neither been assigned nor
removed their names from the
waiting list. Assignments have
been made for 33 men and 31
women since Sept. 1. Those
assignments are valid until 5
p.m. Monday.
Espinosa said that new
housing assignments will be
made daily beginning tomorrow
through Oct. 10. People assigned
during those days must confirm
their assignment by 5 p.m. of
the day they're assigned or risk
losing $10 of their deposit and
being placed at the bottom of
the list.
She added that students also
have the choice to either defer
their status until another quarter
or to drop from the list and lose
nothing.
The fall quarter waiting list
expires at 5 p.m. tomorrow.
Espinosa said students must
notify the housing office of their
intent to remain on the list past
that date.
Clearinghouse coordinator
Dave Babbitz said Saturday that
nearly 940 students have come
through the Clearinghouse as of
Friday. This is down about 400
from last year.

Babbitz said he thought the
decrease was due to the new
guaranteed housing plan.
"I expect that a good
majority of people have found
housing, judging from the few
people we have looking this
weekend," Babbitz said. "But
we really won't know until after
registration."
Babbitz said the annual house
hunt had been calmer this year
than in the past. He attributed
this to dealing mainly with
graduate students, "who are
used to being in new areas.
"We had very few transfers
this year, too," he added. "Most
of them got on-campus
housing."
Espinosa estimated that 195
transfers were offered housing —
all that requested it. She said
this was the first year that all
transfers that asked were offered
housing fall quarter.
"There were less transfers this
year," she said. "Usually there
are twice as many. Next year's
policy is to guarantee housing to
all first-year transfers."

Babbitz said he thought the
decrease was due to the new
guaranteed housing plan.
"I expect that a good
majority of people have found
housing, judging from the few
people we have looking this
weekend," Babbitz said. "But
we really won't know until after
registration."
Babbitz said the annual house
hunt had been calmer this year
than in the past. He attributed
this to dealing mainly with
graduate students, "who are
used to being in new areas.
"We had very few transfers
this year, too," he added. "Most
of them got on-campus
housing."
Espinosa estimated that 195
transfers were offered housing —
all that requested it. She said
this was the first year that all
transfers that asked were offered
housing fall quarter.
"There were less transfers this
year," she said. "Usually there
are twice as many. Next year's
policy is to guarantee housing to
all first-year transfers."
