New SLA link to robbery
SAN FRANCISCO — Authorities say Patricia Hearst
registered under an alias at a college in Sacramento a few
weeks before a series of crimes there that may be linked
to the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA).
Hearst registered at Sacramento City College last Jan.
31 under the name Sue Hendricks, the Sacramento Bee
quoted investigators as confirming.
William and Emily Harris, her SLA traveling
companions, signed up the same day under the aliases
Steve Broudy and Suzanne Lanphear, the newspaper said.
Student ID cards under false names bearing the
Harrises' photographs reportedly were found in the San
Francisco house where they were living when arrested on
Sept. 18.
Meanwhile, famed defense attorney F. Lee Bailey said
yesterday he believes his newest client can get a fair tria 1
in San Francisco. But he said he is upset that a jailhouse
conversation between Hearst and a friend was taped and
made public by authorities.
And although he wouldn't comment on Hearst's
mental state or his expected defense, Bailey said he does
not expect the 21-year-old newspaper heiress to plead
insanity.
"A change of venue won't help. Like the Jack Ruby
and Sirhan Sirhan cases, the East Coast knows as much
about this case as the West Coast."
As for the tape recorded conversation, Bailey said he
suspects that U.S. Atty. James Browning might have used
political pull to have the Sept. 20 meeting bugged. Hearst
was heard telling a childhood friend, Patricia Tobinj that
her politics had changed "from way back when" and
describing herself as a "revolutionary feminist."
Spanish executions protested
MADRID — Parmilitary police opened fire on
protesters in the northern Basque town of Algorta
yesterday as the executions of five anti-government
terrorists threw Spain into crisis.
Six persons were reported wounded in the Basque
town, incluidng an elderly woman shot in the leg.
The Spanish government began recalling ambassadors
from a Europe outraged by the executions.
From Scandanavia to Greece, and even in Spain itself,
tens of thousands of Europeans staged demonstrations,
and in some cases resorted to violence, to vent their
opposition to the rigid rule of Gen. Francisco Franco.
The influential Roman Catholic newspaper Ya, in one
of its strongest and most direct editorials in many years,
demanded "profound and radical transformations in the
present political system ... at all levels." It said delay
would be "suicidal."
OPEC raises oil prices
VIENNA — Iran claimed a victory yesterday over Saudi
Arabia as members of the 13-nation oil cartel headed

home after a tumultuous ministerial conference that
raised crude oil prices by 10 percent.
The increase, effective Wednesday, was a compromise
reached after four long days of haggling between Saudi Oil
Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani and a group of
countries led by Iranian Oil Minister Jamshid Amouzegar.
Some of the countries initially wanted increases as high as
35 percent.
China praised the 10 percent price increase by oil
exporting nations as a victory against "superpower
intimidation" by the United States and the Soviet Union.
President Ford said the price hike woulfl worsen
worldwide inflation. U.S. Energy Administrator Frank
Zarb said the move was "outrageous." There has been no
official Soviet comment.
Israeli pound devalued
JERUSALEM — Israel devalued its currency by 10
percent yesterday, causing consternation among Israelis
over their economic future and criticism by some that the
devaluation should have been greater.
After an all-night cabinet session, the government
announced it had devalued the Israeli pound for the fifth
time in less than a year and raised gasoline prices by 22
percent and the sales tax on a wide variety of goods by 10
percent.
The devaluation means the Israeli pound is now worth
seven to the dollar against 4.20 in November 1974, and
that Israelis will be paying more for imported goods.
Hoffa search discontinued
WATERFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. - Investigators
called off a search for the body of former Teamsters
president James Hoffa yesterday, saying they hoped for
more precise information from an underworld informant
who said Hoffa had been buried in a swampy field here.
Squads of state policemen, using a mechanical digger,
two-and-a-half hours yesterday morning digging at a
half-dozen locations in the 20-acre field and an adjacent
wooded area before the operation was halted. They had
been digging for more than 24 hours without success.
The search began Friday night after the Senate
Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington passed on
a tip from an unnamed underworld source who said
Hoffa's body could be found in the field owned by the
Waterford school district.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but fog and low clouds
along the coast extending inland locally this morning. A
little warmer. Lows tonight in the low 50s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 60s along the coast to mid 70s
inland areas. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons and

Israeli pound devalued
JERUSALEM — Israel devalued its currency by 10
percent yesterday, causing consternation among Israelis
over their economic future and criticism by some that the
devaluation should have been greater.
After an all-night cabinet session, the government
announced it had devalued the Israeli pound for the fifth
time in less than a year and raised gasoline prices by 22
percent and the sales tax on a wide variety of goods by 10
percent.
The devaluation means the Israeli pound is now worth
seven to the dollar against 4.20 in November 1974, and
that Israelis will be paying more for imported goods.
Hoffa search discontinued
WATERFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. - Investigators
called off a search for the body of former Teamsters
president James Hoffa yesterday, saying they hoped for
more precise information from an underworld informant
who said Hoffa had been buried in a swampy field here.
Squads of state policemen, using a mechanical digger,
two-and-a-half hours yesterday morning digging at a
half-dozen locations in the 20-acre field and an adjacent
wooded area before the operation was halted. They had
been digging for more than 24 hours without success.
The search began Friday night after the Senate
Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington passed on
a tip from an unnamed underworld source who said
Hoffa's body could be found in the field owned by the
Waterford school district.

New SLA link to robbery
SAN FRANCISCO — Authorities say Patricia Hearst
registered under an alias at a college in Sacramento a few
weeks before a series of crimes there that may be linked
to the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA).
Hearst registered at Sacramento City College last Jan.
31 under the name Sue Hendricks, the Sacramento Bee
quoted investigators as confirming.
William and Emily Harris, her SLA traveling
companions, signed up the same day under the aliases
Steve Broudy and Suzanne Lanphear, the newspaper said.
Student ID cards under false names bearing the
Harrises' photographs reportedly were found in the San
Francisco house where they were living when arrested on
Sept. 18.
Meanwhile, famed defense attorney F. Lee Bailey said
yesterday he believes his newest client can get a fair tria 1
in San Francisco. But he said he is upset that a jailhouse
conversation between Hearst and a friend was taped and
made public by authorities.
And although he wouldn't comment on Hearst's
mental state or his expected defense, Bailey said he does
not expect the 21-year-old newspaper heiress to plead
insanity.
"A change of venue won't help. Like the Jack Ruby
and Sirhan Sirhan cases, the East Coast knows as much
about this case as the West Coast."
As for the tape recorded conversation, Bailey said he
suspects that U.S. Atty. James Browning might have used
political pull to have the Sept. 20 meeting bugged. Hearst
was heard telling a childhood friend, Patricia Tobinj that
her politics had changed "from way back when" and
describing herself as a "revolutionary feminist."
Spanish executions protested
MADRID — Parmilitary police opened fire on
protesters in the northern Basque town of Algorta
yesterday as the executions of five anti-government
terrorists threw Spain into crisis.
Six persons were reported wounded in the Basque
town, incluidng an elderly woman shot in the leg.
The Spanish government began recalling ambassadors
from a Europe outraged by the executions.
From Scandanavia to Greece, and even in Spain itself,
tens of thousands of Europeans staged demonstrations,
and in some cases resorted to violence, to vent their
opposition to the rigid rule of Gen. Francisco Franco.
The influential Roman Catholic newspaper Ya, in one
of its strongest and most direct editorials in many years,
demanded "profound and radical transformations in the
present political system ... at all levels." It said delay
would be "suicidal."
OPEC raises oil prices
VIENNA — Iran claimed a victory yesterday over Saudi
Arabia as members of the 13-nation oil cartel headed

home after a tumultuous ministerial conference that
raised crude oil prices by 10 percent.
The increase, effective Wednesday, was a compromise
reached after four long days of haggling between Saudi Oil
Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani and a group of
countries led by Iranian Oil Minister Jamshid Amouzegar.
Some of the countries initially wanted increases as high as
35 percent.
China praised the 10 percent price increase by oil
exporting nations as a victory against "superpower
intimidation" by the United States and the Soviet Union.
President Ford said the price hike woulfl worsen
