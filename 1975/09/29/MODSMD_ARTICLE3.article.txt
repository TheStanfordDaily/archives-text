# 300 people protest Ford's speech
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
A crowd of nearly 300 people
calling themselves The People, Not
Profits Coalition demonstrated during
President Ford's speech at the new law
school, protesting Ford
Administration policies.
Campus groups with varying
political leanings took part in the
demonstration, according to Seth
Foldy, a spokesman for the coalition.
Foldy is a member of the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), a left-wing
campus organization.
In a press release issued before the
rally, the coalition said, "We see
continued high unemployment, a
government spending freeze on all but
the military budget, inflation rapidly
whittling away at fixed incomes and
workers paychecks, prospects for
higher fuel prices and rising food costs
while foodstuffs are withheld from the
market, sold overseas and outright
destroyed."
Alternative viewpoints
A spokesman for ARC said, "We
demonstrated to show our
disagreement with Ford's policies and
to let others know our points of
disagreement. These alternative
viewpoints have been inadequately
presented."
The demonstrators heckled Ford
during the entire 20-minute speech.
Shouts of "Who elected you?", "Hey,
hey what do you say, let's expose the
CIA," and "Ford is a puppet"
attracted the attention of many who
came to see the President.
Ron Moskowitz, a rally
organizer admitted that some of
the vocabulary and noise made by the
demonstrators was "unnecessary."

Law Prof. Gerald Gunther said, "I
am in sympathy with demonstration
and even heckling in communicating
ideas. However, I would hope that
people have the First Amendment rights
of the speaker and the audience in
mind, otherwise it is detestable from a
civil rights point of view."
'Mindlessness'
James Siena, legal adviser to
University President Richard Lyman,
was distressed by, "the mindlessness of
it all. . . people chanting 'bullshit'
when they couldn't even hear what
was being said. They seemed to be
there to aggravate people, not to
acquaint the audience with their
grievances."
"If the demonstrators had btN'n
listening to what the President was
saying, they would have cheered
instead of heckled," commented one
faculty member, an outspoken critic
of the Ford Administration who stood
amid the protesters and general public,
more than 50 yards from the platform.
Lyman felt that the demonstrators
were not interested in "hearing
anything from anyone ... sheer
mindlessness."
A rally preceded Ford's speech in
White Plaza. University plant services
provided the public address system
and accompanying microphones.
Stanford trains 'corporate lawyers'
Lenny Siegel, a campus radical in
the early '70s, spoke at the pre-speech
rally. He said the Stanford Law School
"trains people to be corporate
lawyers."
Siegel blamed the school's
professors, including "[Dean Thomas]
Ehrlich who came from the State
Department and [Howard] Williams,

an authority on oil and gas legislation
who supports the decontrol of oil
prices."
He also said that the school's
Crown Quadrangle is named after the
man who headed General Dynamics,
one of the biggest war contractors."
Calling Ford the "architect of
policies that promote imperialism,"
Siegel said that Ford and Kissinger are
as corrupt as the Nixon
Administration.
No violence
There was no attempt by law
enforcement officials to stop or to
quiet the demonstrators. When the
demonstrators marched from White
Pla?:a to the law school, the police did
not deter them. There were no
tricidents of violence.
When the heckling began, several
people yelled to the demonstrators to
be quiet. The speech could not be
heard over the protesters' chants.

Picket signs held by the
demonstrators ranged from "Strip
mine Grand Rapids" to "Fidel is an
honest lawyer."
Immediately following the speech,
Ford was handed a petition which was
signed by more than 200 law students
protesting his Administration's
policies. "We feel compelled to convey
our distress at the direction your
Presidency has taken," the petition
said.
"As individuals we hold differing
economic and political philosophies,
but we are united in the belief that
your Administration has ignored or
exacerbated our most pressing national
problems."
The petition specifically objected
to the Administration's economic
policies, domestic oil price controls,
strip-mining, excessive military
spending and the world hunger crisis.

strip-mining, excessive military
spending and the world hunger crisis.

A MESSAGE FOR FORD—Radical groups from throughout the Bay Area gathered at Stanford Sunday, Sept. 21, to
protest at President Ford's dedication of the new law school. A myriad of banners — including one calling for an end to
the Franco regime in Spain — greeted the chief executive.
A crowd of nearly 300 people
calling themselves The People, Not
Profits Coalition demonstrated during
President Ford's speech at the new law
school, protesting Ford
Administration policies.
Campus groups with varying
political leanings took part in the
demonstration, according to Seth
Foldy, a spokesman for the coalition.
Foldy is a member of the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARC), a left-wing
campus organization.
In a press release issued before the
rally, the coalition said, "We see
continued high unemployment, a
government spending freeze on all but
the military budget, inflation rapidly
whittling away at fixed incomes and
workers paychecks, prospects for
higher fuel prices and rising food costs
while foodstuffs are withheld from the
market, sold overseas and outright
destroyed."
Alternative viewpoints
A spokesman for ARC said, "We
demonstrated to show our
disagreement with Ford's policies and
to let others know our points of
disagreement. These alternative
viewpoints have been inadequately
presented."
The demonstrators heckled Ford
during the entire 20-minute speech.
Shouts of "Who elected you?", "Hey,
hey what do you say, let's expose the
CIA," and "Ford is a puppet"
attracted the attention of many who
came to see the President.
Ron Moskowitz, a rally
organizer admitted that some of
the vocabulary and noise made by the
demonstrators was "unnecessary."

Law Prof. Gerald Gunther said, "I
am in sympathy with demonstration
and even heckling in communicating
ideas. However, I would hope that
people have the First Amendment rights
of the speaker and the audience in
mind, otherwise it is detestable from a
civil rights point of view."
'Mindlessness'
James Siena, legal adviser to
University President Richard Lyman,
was distressed by, "the mindlessness of
it all. . . people chanting 'bullshit'
when they couldn't even hear what
was being said. They seemed to be
there to aggravate people, not to
acquaint the audience with their
grievances."
"If the demonstrators had btN'n
listening to what the President was
saying, they would have cheered
instead of heckled," commented one
faculty member, an outspoken critic
of the Ford Administration who stood
amid the protesters and general public,
more than 50 yards from the platform.
Lyman felt that the demonstrators
were not interested in "hearing
anything from anyone ... sheer
mindlessness."
A rally preceded Ford's speech in
White Plaza. University plant services
provided the public address system
and accompanying microphones.
Stanford trains 'corporate lawyers'
Lenny Siegel, a campus radical in
the early '70s, spoke at the pre-speech
rally. He said the Stanford Law School
"trains people to be corporate
lawyers."
Siegel blamed the school's
professors, including "[Dean Thomas]
Ehrlich who came from the State
Department and [Howard] Williams,

an authority on oil and gas legislation
who supports the decontrol of oil
prices."
He also said that the school's
Crown Quadrangle is named after the
man who headed General Dynamics,
one of the biggest war contractors."
Calling Ford the "architect of
policies that promote imperialism,"
Siegel said that Ford and Kissinger are
as corrupt as the Nixon
Administration.
No violence
There was no attempt by law
enforcement officials to stop or to
quiet the demonstrators. When the
demonstrators marched from White
Pla?:a to the law school, the police did
not deter them. There were no
tricidents of violence.
When the heckling began, several
people yelled to the demonstrators to
be quiet. The speech could not be
heard over the protesters' chants.

Picket signs held by the
demonstrators ranged from "Strip
mine Grand Rapids" to "Fidel is an
honest lawyer."
Immediately following the speech,
Ford was handed a petition which was
signed by more than 200 law students
protesting his Administration's
policies. "We feel compelled to convey
our distress at the direction your
Presidency has taken," the petition
said.
"As individuals we hold differing
economic and political philosophies,
but we are united in the belief that
your Administration has ignored or
exacerbated our most pressing national
problems."
The petition specifically objected
to the Administration's economic
policies, domestic oil price controls,
strip-mining, excessive military
spending and the world hunger crisis.

our distress at the direction your
Presidency has taken," the petition
said.
"As individuals we hold differing
economic and political philosophies,
but we are united in the belief that
your Administration has ignored or
exacerbated our most pressing national
problems."
The petition specifically objected
to the Administration's economic
policies, domestic oil price controls,
strip-mining, excessive military
spending and the world hunger crisis.
