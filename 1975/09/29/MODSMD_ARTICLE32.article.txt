# Ford gives plain talk
## President speaks amidst stringent security 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Flanked by his constant companions,
the secret service, and protected from a
distance by lines of security forces, the
nation's least private person addressed
10,000 people here last week on each
citizen's right to privacy.
President Gerald Ford charged the
Federal government with the
responsibility of protecting each
citizen's right to privacy at the
dedication of the law school's new
facilities. He defined the right as "the
right to keep one's individual identity
inviolate â€” or in plain talk, the right to
do things or to do your own thing."
Ford told the polite but
unenthusiastic crowd that "one of the
worst offenders is the Federal
Government itself."
Much of the audience interrupted
with applause both then and when he
added, "I don't mean improper or illegal
invasions of people's privacy or
Constitutional rights by Federal
agencies or individual officials, which
nobody condones and which I
absolutely will not tolerate as long as I
am President of the United States."
He said he meant "threats to
privacy which have resulted from laws
duly enacted by past Congresses for
very laudable purposes having wide
public support and appeal. Many of
these laws, with today's technology,
cumulatively threaten to strip the
individual of his privacy or her privacy
and reduce him to a faceless set of digits
in a monstrous network of computers."
The President placed the blame for
increased Federal invasions of privacy
largely with the growth of social welfare
programs in the United States.
"Certainly we cannot scuttle
worthwhile programs which provide

essential help for the helpless and the
deserving citizen," Ford said. "Yet we
must protect every individual from
excessive and unnecessary intrusions by
a Big Brother bureaucracy."
One step in the government
protection Ford advocates, he said, is
the Privacy Act of 1974, which went
into effect two days ago. The act
embodies many recommendations from
the Committee on Privacy which Ford
chaired. It requires that government
files on individuals be accurate and
places restrictions on their use.
It also gives each individual the right
to read and correct or add to
information in his or her data files. Ford
said. The act also sets up a Privacy
Commission "with a two year mandate
to monitor the operation of the law and
investigate additional privacy issues," he
added.
"Two hundred years of American
independence," Ford told his audience,
"have gained for all of us an
unprecedented measure of political and
economic stability and success." He
called advancement of individual
independence the "great challenge of
our next hundred years."
Earlier in his speech Ford referred to
Stanford's 19-19 tie with Michigan.
"When it comes to equality, you just
can't be any more equal than that game
with Michigan." The audience laughed
briefly and politely, as the President
added, "19 to 19! Well, what better
place than a law school to celebrate a
hung jury." Ford was an All-American
offensive lineman at Michigan.
Ford made no reference to the
sizeable group of demonstrators, who
kept up a volley of hoots, jeers and
rhythmic chants during the speech.
