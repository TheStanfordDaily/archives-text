# President Lyman looks at his five years
## 
### 
(Five years ago last Wednesday, Richard W.
Lyman became Stanford's seventh President.
This past summer, Daily editor Viae Kershner
interviewed Lyman about his first five years in
office, his views on education at Stanford and
his plans for the future.
Kershner reports, "/ had interviewed
Lyman several times previously, and during
those discussions, which were generally
confined to specific policies about which the
University was being assailed, I thought he was
somewhat aloof and also a man who didn't say
anything profound.
"After interviewing him this summer,
however, I changed my opinion. Lyman has
obviously thought a good deal about the larger
issues facing Stanford, and speaks lucidly and
convincingly. I also now think that his obvious
difficulty in communicating with students is
more because he is basically reserved than
because he looks down on them. ")
Daily—What do you think about the decline
in student radicalism in the last five years? Is it
a trend that you foresaw when you took the
job?
Lyman—To answer the last part of the
question first, no, and I doubt very many
people did. We were being told then with some
confidence by radical leaders that if we
thought we had trouble in 1969-70 we ought
to wait until 1970-71 and see how much worse
it could be.
I think most people I knew then took the
possibility seriously and were quite surprised
at the rapidity with which the Movement,
so-called, declined and particularly with which
serious threats to the University's capacity to
keep running disappeared, and you'll
remember, in the spring of 1970 there was a
serious effort to close universities down and a
good many either closed down or said they
were closed down and were almost so, or kept
running but weren't really and in 1970-71 that
just didn't happen.
Well, of course here we had a more gradual
diminution than in most places. There was
more excite men£ here in the succeeding two
years than there was at many campuses.
D—This spring, there seemed to be an
upswing in student interest in issues, though
there were no riots. Is this going to be a
cyclical phenomenon or is this more a normal
level of interest?
L—That's very hard to say. That involves
the capacity to predict and I'm not confident
I've got any more of that now than I had in
1970 or in 1965 or at any other date. I'm not
sure how much of a real change there was this
past year. There certainly was a series of events
in various universities that was reminiscent of
what had happened and which the media
seized upon as being very reminiscent.
Almost without exception, these events
involved in some way the fears of ethnic
minority groups that they were being or were
about to be disadvantaged partly as an
outgrowth of budgetary problems of the
institutions concerned and partly because of
a decline in reformist zeal, let's say, on the
part of the entire society with respect to their
problems.
In each case, there was a tendency for
alliances to be formed between the ethnic
minorities involved and some of the white
students on campus. It isn't clear that in very
many places, indeed, in any place except
Brown University, there was a widespead
coalition that involved a lot of students and
created a total change in atmosphere.
Will this sort of thing persist? I don't know.
I have said all along — people inside the
University and especially outside the
University have asked me about the sudden
seeming decline in student activism — I've said,
"yeah,but I don't think we've heard the last of
protest from minority groups because all of
their problems are not solved." I see nationally
reason for them to feel pretty frustrated and I
think we'll see expressions of that.
D—lt seems that over the last five years the
University has been involved in a number of
decisions against a number of its constituent
interest groups. . .
L— It tends to be the name of the game. It's
very hard to do anything that doesn't offend
somebody.
D—One of those was the "offing" of the
Indian mascot that offended some alumni and
I still hear a lot about.
L— So do I.
D—l know Stanford was once a regional
institution. I was wondering if there was some
conflict between trying to be a major center of
learning and this background.
L—l think there is and I think it exists in
relation to all of the leading private
Universities and maybe some of the public
things. Certainly one can find some very
similar reactions — without, perhaps, as
specific a target as the Indian symbol — at
Harvard, Princeton, Yale and so on.

We were being told by radical
leaders that if we thought we had
trouble in 1969-70, we ought to wait
until 1970-71.

I think there is an understandable
resentment of the highly competitive academic
atmosphere at institutions which were more
relaxed in an earlier era. Sometimes it's
combined with resentment if children or
friends' children don't get admission, although
I've run into alumni who couldn't be more
understanding of this.
Whether it's more acute here than in other
places I don't know; the indications wouldn't
suggest that to me. The Indian decision has
created more bad feeling, longer-lasting bad
feeling, than I anticipated.
I don't think they ever understood what in
the world it was all about. There was a
persistent myth that somehow I had been
confronted with an angry surge of Indian
students saying I had to get rid of the Indian
symbol and in a moment of panic or terror or
something, trying to avoid trouble, that's what
I did.
Instead, I did something much more
dangerous maybe, I got persuaded that there
was justice in the argument that no matter
what you did to "clean up" use of the symbol
— make it dignified, cut out the cartoon
targets of fun and so on — you would end up
with a representation of the Indian which was

wildly irrelevant to the problems of the
Indians of America.
To the extent that people could think of
Indians as either noble figures on horseback or
funnly little fellows you made cartoons about,
they weren't facing the real problems.
D-What about all the fraternity alumni
who last year told the University that saving
their fraternity was the most important thing
the University had to do. Doesn't that fit in
with the pattern of the Indian problem?
L—l think the problem as perceived by a
University President is bound to be "why do
so many people look only at their particular
little thing, why can't more people look at the
overall picture?" But on the other hand, that's
one of the most interesting things abut the
position, I think.
One is constantly trying to explain to
somebody what somebody else's view of the
University is or to explain to somebody why,
while their particular point is a valid one, seen
by itself, it is overridden by some other set of
considerations.
D—Do you feel you can make decisions, or
that there are different forces conflicting, and
you have to find the best balance?
L— I think that opinion nowadays has
recognized and perhaps over-recognized the
importance of organized forces being brought
to bear on decision-makers. Decision-makers
obviously can't and don't overlook interest
groups and forces brought to bear.
Quite often, however, there is a kind of a
cancelling out effect which leads the
decision-maker freer to make a decision that
doesn't represent simply a compromise.
D—One year ago, the University economic
problems really magnified intensely. How did
this problem come about? Wasn't the stock
market collapse anticipated or was it a
combination of that and wage and energy
increases or what?
L—A variety of things happened. The
inflation rate heated up quite rapidly and the
stock market fall did hurt us with respect to
the yield-and-gain pool of the endowment, but
I don't think there was much that was
peculiarly local to Stanford. At the same time
our capacity to analyze the situation
improved. We discovered that it is very easy to
be in what looks like balance one year but still
have a bad situation in terms of long-term
dynamics.
D—Do you ever take a stand that would pit
you against the world on a budget cutting
decision ?

To the extent that people think of
Indians as noble figures on horse
back or funny little fellows, they
aren't facing the problems of In
dians.

L-That would be very unlikely, because it
would suggest that my world wasn't
functioning right or I wasn't and there ought
to be a parting of the ways one way or the
other. If you participate in the process, and
don't just sweep in every three months out of
the blue, it's less likely to happen.
D—lt seems that whenever there's an issue in
the University, you have to know about it. . .
L—One of the reasons that's true is because
of people like you, of course. If I didn't have
to deal with the media at all, there would be a
lot I wouldn't need to know about. That's one
of the problems, obviously, you can't know
everything that's going on by a country mile
and I've often pointed to the obvious fact that
a President literally does not understand most
of what the faculty is doing.
A fair amount of Presidential time goes into
trying to keep reasonably informed. Trying to
decide how to ration one's time is really a very
difficult continuing problem
Some days you find you're doing things
that are mostiy ceremonial and some days
you're doing things that are substantive and
still other days, you're doing things that are
solitary like working on a speech or catching
up on your reading. So there's a great deal of
variety.
D—Getting back to your role as University
president, is the adding to knowledge that this
University does channeled into certain
directions because of finances and because of
faculty entrenchment, and not what really
ought to be learned?
L—lt's probably safe to say that in no
university taken by itself is the scope of
research truly balanced and closely
approximating what you'd like to see done. If
you took the whole higher educational system,
together, and asked that question, the answer
might be a little closer to satisfactory, but if
you want to stick within a particular
institution, obviously there are a great many
particular forces and traditions and
developments of its history that affect what is
done.
I'm not sure that one would really want a
university to try to achive complete balance at
the expense of doing the best at whatever it's
best equipped to do.
D—But if every individual unit thinks this
way, how do you know the whole system is
doing its job?
L—Well, you don't know that. The subject
gets looked at by people who are trying to
look at the whole system. I think legitimate
questions can be raised and have been raised
about the balance say, between hard sciences
and technology on the one side and so-called
soft social sciences and humanities on the
other. Those questions aren't simple and can't
be solved by just equating dollars.
I think among the chief concerns today that
you hear about people who are worrying about
this is that through good old traditional
American stress on getting things resolved as
quickly as possible, we are in a period of
over-emphasizing applied research at the
expense of fundamental research with results
that cannot be anticipated.
I'm not saying by that that applied research
and development is unimportant, but simply
that universities can be drawn into too much of
that just by following the dollars and not
paying enough attention to comparative
advantage. There are other kinds of
institutions that can do applied research
problably better than we can.
D—There is some worry, especially among

students, that as Stanford moves on, it
becomes divided in two parts. Some of the
technical departments and professional schools
keep getting better and better while the
humanities and social science departments
stagnate. Do you see any problem here?
L—There has been a problem at Stanford in
the simple sense that by most of the measures,
the University has overall had greater eminence
in the sciences and professional schools. On
the other hand, as it has been pointed out ad
nauseum, it is the departments in the
humanities and social sciences that scored the
greatest relative advances over the last couple
of decades in the same ratings that we're
talking about.
But I think there is something of a problem.
Partly, it's a national problem in morale on the
part of humanists and some of the social
scientists. There is a greater problem for
humanists today* in defining their task than
there is for scientists. Perhaps there always has
been, but the dilemma is more acute now.
There is a good deal of feeling on the
part of humanists that much humanistic
research is slavishly imitative of scientific
research in superficial ways; that somehow the
criterion of success is to be as science-like as
possible, whereas the humanities really ought
to be concerned with values and other things
that cannot be studied scientifically.

It would be hard to spy on faculty to
see who's performing and who isn't
without producing a nice tittle
academic police state.

D—Doesn't the University have a problem
with a tenured bureaucracy; that is, professors
who are going nowhere in their research ?
L—l suppose the best antidote to the
everpresent possibility of professors going to
seed after they receive tenure, is a lively
intellectual atmosphere around them so that
the liveliest departments are likeliest to stay
liveliest and remain interesting places.
People are likely to stay hard-working out
of self-respect, out of intellectual curiosity,
out of stimulus for the students and colleagues
they have, rather than out of fear that if they
don't stay lively they will lose their jobs. It
would be very hard to lose your job just for
ceasing to be a very interesting student of your
particular subject.
It's true that universities are very lightly
managed, that is, that university
administrations don't spy on faculty and try to
figure out who's performing and who is resting
on his or her reputation. It would be pretty
hard to do that without producing a nice little
academic police state, which would only
succeed in killing off the initiative of those
who were demonstrating it.
The tenure system is under pressure that it
hasn't been for a very long time because it's
obvious that we're having a terrible time
finding positions for young scholars as they
emerge with a Ph.D. and also in keeping a
steady flow of people going through the
institution so you have the balance of younger
faculty to offset older faculty.
D—Could you compare students now, when
you went to school and any time in between?
Are there changes in the way students look at
the world? Well, suppose someone came
into your office today and said "I'm coming
here as an undergraduate, I've had a general
education, I want to go out and help the
world." Are there differences in the way
students approach that or perhaps in the
advice you would give?
L—l think there are. Any generalization
about students ought to be prefaced by saying
that it isn't true because in every era there are
so many varieties of students. But I think there
are more students now than there were a half
dozen years ago whose view seems to be that
the only way that they can expect to "'help the
world" is through some rather particular
venture of their own such as enterihg a
profession, a line of work, rather than going
out with the explicit notion that everything
they do is directed toward saving the world in
sort of a cosmic, overall, Gestalt way.
These things go in waves. I have a feeling
that back in the late '40s when I was
graduating from college there was something
a little more closely approaching the balance
you see now than in the '50s — that is, a
balance between a career and saving the world.
It seems to me that in the late'4os, there was a
fair amount of concern with politics and the
state of society and so forth; rather more than
people noticed in the mid-50s.
Now I think that students are perhaps
unfairly accused of having forgotten all about
the condition of the world and becoming
totally pre-occupied with their own individual
futures. It doesn't seem to me that's what I
encounter in talking to students. Ido encounter
a great deal of pessimism about their individual
capacity to influence the world for good.
D—You made a speech a year-and-a-half ago
that said that students should be "generalists
that is, get a more general education as an
undergraduate. But how can that be if there is
such intense competition for graduate schools?
L—Well, in the first place, I'm not sure that
students always have an accurate perception of
what graduate schools and graduate
departments are looking for when they look
over the application, and a student may
overestimate the extent to which a graduate
school is going to look at only what seems
most relevant to that school's discipline.
It isn't clear to me that law schools don't
value a capacity for a student to put together a
sensible liberal arts program as much as
anything else. What I was trying to argue was
that too much pre-occupation with the
immediate next step may get in the way of
sensible choices.
If there is one thing we can say fairly
clearly about people's careers now, it is that
barring world catastrophe, most people are
going to find more changes taking place in
their careers than would have been
characteristic 30 years ago, so that preparation
for the careers that are now available, and too
much accent on that at the expense of basic
knowledge, may turn out not to be productive
even in terms of a successful career, let alone
what it does to the capacity to lead and
appreciate life.

D—Let's go back to undergraduate
admissions. Is there a possibility that the type
of students that are coming to Stanford, even
if they are very well selected out of the
applicant pool, are basically A students from
upper-middle class, professionally oriented
homes, and coming from this background,
there isn't much the University can do to
change them?
L—One of the best things to do is to get to
the people who say they want to be pre-meds
and test that conviction and see if it was based
on more than inherited tradition or a
glamorized picture of the profession and
suggest that there are other things one can do
with similar skills.
I think that we do perform rather
differently now than we did 10 or 15 years
ago. No doubt, a disproportionally high
number of the best students in terms of
academic record come from middle-class
backgrounds or higher and professional
backgrounds. But you can further the
disproportion by recruiting energetically only
in schools that are populated by such people.
There's been a major change during Fred
Hargadon's administration in the admissions
office in our patterns of recruitment. Whereas
there used to be quite intense recruiting at a
limited number of schools there is now much
less intense, much more widespread recruiting.
So that to the extent that there is out there a
population of very talented students from
other than the upper-middle class, they are
being reached better now than they were
before.
D—Getting into your personal experience as
President, has your personal life been affected?
L—Oh sure, although the most critical
change occurred in 1966-67 when I became
provost. That was a bigger change, even, than
moving from provost to president. Sure, there
is difficulty of finding time for private life.
You find it very difficult to do things in a
casual, unplanned way.
We have continual discussions with our
children about this because from their point of
view, we are far too planned, and programmed,
and they would like to be more casual about
when you do what than we can afford to be.
They're all grown up and very
understanding of this, but it still does
represent a major cost of having such a
position. We try to combat this in many ways,
and I'm pleased with the extent to which we
still know each other in our family.
D—Do you like having to travel and give
fundraising speeches?
L—lt varies; I like giving successful speeches
and loathe giving unsuccessful ones. I've had a
lot of travel, and I'm anxious not to make any
major trips for awhile.
D—When you became President, you said
you'd stay no longer than 10 years, and then
you recently hinted that you wouldn't even
stay that long. I realize you 're not going to say
exactly when you will resign, but what will
determine your decision ?
L—Even that's hard to predict, I suppose.
One would like to think that what would
determine that would be one's feelings about
the job and one's answers to questions such as
"Do you think you're really accomplishing
anything?," "Do you think the institution
would be better off with a fresh start?"

By temperment, I may do better
defending than anything else. I
never imagined I was going to rival
the greatest educational thinkers.

D—Do you ever sit in here and daydream,
"three years from now, or five years from
now, I'd like to be doing something else?"
L—l don't have anything clearly in mind.
I'm quite convinced my interests and instincts
are more academic than anything else... As
much as I daydream about anything, I
daydream about the pleasures of being able to
stick to one subject long enough to be able to
write a book about it.
D—Could you still say fairly confidently
that 1980 is the last year that you'll be
President?
L—l would think that that's about as
reasonable a statement now as it was five years
ago. And then it was stated in terms of a
maximum.
D—How do you feel about fundraising? Do
you sometimes feel like the Doonesbury satire
of Kingman Brewster, when he tells alumni "/
see in your faces honesty and integrity" and
means "I see in your faces dollars."?
L—That's a fair pun, I would say. I think
one doesn't — why do I keep saying one, why
don't I just say I— I don't find myself telling
people things I don't believe. I guess I
sometimes find myself not saying things that I
might say — in some other setting, and that's
one of those things that makes fundraising and
that whole diplomatic effort unattractive.
D—You have to ask yourself periodically
"what have I accomplished?" and "Why is the
University better because I've been President
or why has it avoided collapse ?"
L—After my first year in office, the Daily
picked up on my view that what I'd been
engaged in was pretty mcuh defensive, rather
than breaking new ground I guess, although the
nature of the defense and the nature of forces
against which one was defending has changed
from time to time, I have a feeling that that
has been a characteristic.
D—lt's been a defensive ere 7
/—Yeah, principally, although it may also
be that by temperament and so on I'm more
likely to do well at that than at something else.
I have never imagined that I was going to rival
the greatest original thinkers on educational
topics. I certainly have always wished that I
was in a position other than having to
contemplate cutting back rather than adding.
There have been many places where just a little
more in the way of additional resources would
have been wonderful.
D—What would you like to be remembered
for in institutional histories?
L—l will probably be pictured as having
taken over at a moment when the place
seemed to be, seemed to be, I stress,
disintegrating in chaos and anarchy, and may
or may not have played a significant role in
bringing it out of that.
