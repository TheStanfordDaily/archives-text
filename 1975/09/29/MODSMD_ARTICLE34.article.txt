Ford awards scientists
Three Stanford scientists were awarded the
National Medal of Science by President Ford
in ceremonies held in the White House last
month.
Emeritus Chemistry Prof. Paul Flory,
Emeritus Applied Physics Prof. Rudolf
Kompfner and Emeritus Chemistry Prof. Linus
Pauling are among the recipients of the
nation's most prestigious award for
distinguished contributions to the sciences,
mathematics and engineering.
Pauling, a two-time Nobel Prize winner, was
denied the National Medal of Science twice
during the former administrations presumably
because of his criticism of U.S. foreign and
nuclear policy.
Ten scientists were honored in the White
House ceremonies. One of them is former
Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer, now a
professor at UC-Berkeley.
Flory received the medal in recognition of
his work in the "theories and understanding of
polymeric substances, or large organic
molecules," he said.
Last year, Flory received the Nobel Prize in
chemistry.
Kompfner received the medal for his
invention of the traveling wave tube, which is
used as a transmission system for satellites,
space crafts and rockets. He is currently
director of research for Bell Telephone
Laboratories, Inc.
The awards are based on recommendations
by a special 13-member advisory group.
Architecture dept. razed
Provost William Miller this summer
announced the phasing out of the University's
architecture program "as soon as practicable,"
probably after 1976-77, in a letter to 62
current architecture majors.
The decision was made, Miller wrote, as
part of the University's "budget reduction
program" which proposes to slash $10 million
of expenses over a three year period.
Expenditures for the current program total
about $36,000 per academic year. This
funding will continue for at least two years.
Students currently majoring in architecture
will be able to complete their studies here.
Assoc. Architecture Prof. Robert
Mittlestadt, who heads the current program,
said he objected to the University's handling of
the abolishment of the architecture program.
If he had been given some warning that
architecture would be eliminated, Mittlestadt
said, he "might have done something on an ad
hoc basis."
Beer on campus by winter?
Beer may be served on campus as early as
winter quarter, but wine sales are definitely
out at the proposed pub in Tresidder Union.
The go-ahead on beer sales may come as
soon as Oct. 15, according to Bob Caselli,
director of food services here for TDS Inc., the
private company which operates the Transition
and the Coffee House.
TDS applied for a liquor license over the
summer, and now the major obstacle to

approval of the license is a complaint
reportedly filed by a student here protesting
on-campus beer sales, Caselli said. The
complaint must be considered by the state
Alcoholic Beverage Control board (ABC)
before that group issues any beer license.
"Normally, the ABC would have a decision
within about two weeks [Oct. 4]," Caselli
said. "It has not gone normally at this point.
As I understand it, we have had a complaint by
a student on campus. It may slow things down,
but I don't see any legal implications."
TDS refused to release the name of the
student.
The ABC could decide to dismiss the
protestor it could schedule a hearing on the
matter.
"If there is a hearing, it could delay things
a week or two," Caselli said. "I would hazard a
guess that about the 15th of October we will
have a final disposition."
TDS had hoped for a ruling on its original
beer-and-wine application by mid-September.
Groups trying to get a liquor license must post
notice for one month, after which the ABC
normally takes about two weeks to make a
final ruling.
In mid-August, nearly three weeks into the
posting period, the ABC notified Caselli that
wine sales would violate state statutes limiting
the alcoholic content of beverages sold at
educational institutions. As a result, TDS
resubmitted its application on Aug. 19 — this
time requesting beer sales only.
"The ABC indicates it [the new
application] is going pretty smoothly, except
for the protest," Caselli noted.
The University is currently discussing
location and financing of the pub with TDS,
Caselli said. Preliminary plans would place the
pub in what is now the games room at
Tresidder.
If this plan is implemented, the pinball
machines would be moved into an area near
the bowling alleys, and the billiard tables
would probably be eliminated.
"TDS and Stanford are in the process of
determining facts and figures. We would like to
see this 'ideally' around Christmas time and
start winter quarter with the pub. That's
assuming no structural or financial problems
— it assumes smooth sailing," Caselli said.
If the license is approved, students and
faculty will aid in design of the tavern. The
menu and hours would be decided after the
ABC makes a ruling.
Lipset new Hoover fellow
Seymour Martin Lipset, an internationally
renowned scholar in political science and
sociology, joined the Hoover Institution staff
as a senior fellow this past summer.
Lipset will spend two-thirds of his time as
senior fellow at the institution, one-sixth as a
political science professor and one-sixth as a
sociology professor.
Since 1966, he has been a professor of
government and social relations at Harvard and
a member of the executive committee of the
Center for International Affairs there.
He was also a sociology professor at the
University of California at Berkeley from
1956-66 where he directed the Institute of
International Studies from 1962-66.
As a social commentator, Lipset is
considered to be part of the "New

Conservatives" — a IP" 0 "? of liberals who
shifted to the right in reaction the radical
movements of the 19605.
Lipset has written or edited more than a
dozen books on political movements and
political sociology. He has written extensively
on student activism during the '60s.
In addition, he has done empirical research
on the academic world's choice in the 1972
presidential election.
New trustees elected
The University trustees elected two new
members to five-year board terms this past
summer and re-elected former Stanford
History Prof. Otis Pease.
The new members are Flora Hewlett, wife
of former trustee William Hewlett, and Alan
Weeden, a New York investment banker.
Industrialist William Hewlett, president of
Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard Company,
resigned from the Board of Trustees last year
in "an effort to cut down on outside
activities," he said.
Mrs. Hewlett, a graduate of the University
of California at Berkeley, is an elder in the
United Prebyterian Church. She also serves as a
trustee for the San Francisco Theological
Seminary and is an executive committee
member of the World Affairs Council of
Northern California.
All five Hewlett children have attended
Stanford.
Weeden, a 1945 Stanford graduate, has
served as president of Weeden & Co., a New
York investment banking firm, since 1967. He
was originally elected to the Board of Trustees
in 1970 by alumni and has been off the board
for a year.
Pease, a Yale University graduate, taught
here from 1956-66 and held the endowed Coe
professorship chair of American history.
Strikes hit P.A., Santa Clara
Santa Clara County and Palo Alto
employees went on strike during the summer
and Stanford firemen threatened to do the
same before negotiations with the University
ended with a contract agreement.
Stanford firefighters had threatened to
strike when a 30-day federal mediation period
had expired.
The firefighters' union won an increase in
disability benefits and a 15 percent pay raise
retroactive to last July 1 and an additional 8.5
percent pay hike effective Aug. 1,1976.

Palo Alto's first municipal strike in the city's
history came to a close after 22 days. The
employees received a seven and 'one-half
percent wage hike in August and will received
another two percent hike beginning Jan. 1 and
a six percent raise next July.
After striking for 16 days, county workers
received a seven percent pay raise in August
and will receive another four percent hike plus
a cost-of-living compensation next July.
City employees were originally demanding a
13 percent salary hike while county workers
wanted a 12.5 wage hike.
$200 million raised here
Stanford's five-year $300 million campaign
reached the $200 million mark over the
summer, and President Richard Lyman expects
the remaining $100 million should be
successfully raised.
Lyman attributed the success of the
campaign to "a tremendous effort by many
people." He praised the fundraisers who
"haven't allowed their enthusiasm to be
dampened" despite the country's economic
recession.
The money has provided 37 endowed
professorships, a new law school building,
Medical Center additions and athletic facilities,
according to Lyman. However, the University
is still searching for funding for a new library
and more endowed professorships.
SWOPSI receives grant
The Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) received a $19,000
grant from the National Institute of Social
Sciences (NISS) to study experimental
education programs.
SWOPSI Director Andrew Parnes said the
money will not be used to keep SWOPSI
operating after 1975-76. "But I think that the
grant should be helpful in keeping SWOPSI
around," he added.
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate Studies B.
Michael Closson said he hopes that the NISS
grant "will prove that people in SWOPSI are
concerned about improving the program
format and it probably will increase SWOPSI
support."
Parnes said the NISS program will define
"what workshop experience is like, and if the

program is not continued, it will at least
provide workshop information."
During fall and winter quarters, two
workshops will be set up and a handbook will
be written to analyze the workshops'
organization, methods and purpose.
In the spring, the handbook, slides and
videotapes will be used to conduct a seminar
on experimental teaching techniques.
Shopping center to expand
The Board of Trustees voted in June to
allocate $250,000 for plans to expand and
modernize the Stanford Shopping Center.
Additional buildings and landscaping
changes are planned for the open space
between Macy's and Bullock's. The buildings
will be built on existing parking lot space.
The University's preliminary concepts call
for one new major tenant— a "specialty anchor
tenant" — to be added to the center and
several smaller shops on 200,000 square feet of
land.
Vice President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger estimated that

construction could begin as soon as February.
He said the project would cost $8 to $10
million, "to be taken from the University's
pool of endowment funds."
This figure would exceed the original $6
million outlay which the University made
when the center was built in the early 19505.
The center annually provides nearly $1
million in rental revenue to the University and
even more in property tax revenue to Palo
Alto.
Profs appointed to govt, posts
Two University professors, one from the
Law School and one from the Business School,
have been appointed to posts in the state and
federal governments respectively.
Assoc. Law Prof. Martin Glick was
nominated to become California's
Employment Development Director by Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr.

Click, 35, a Democrat who once served as
statewide director of the California Rural
Legal Assistance (CIILA), replaces James
Lorenz Jr. in the $37,212-a-year post.
James Van Home, 39, associate dean and
professor of finance at the Graduate School of
Business, has been appointed deputy assistant
secretary of the Treasury for economic policy.
Sandra Bern to retain post
Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern, who
last spring announced her resignation, decided
to retain her position in ttie department.
In a Daily article last May, she is quoted as
saying that Stanford's "intense" performance
and research pressures were the reason for her
resignation.
She will fulfill a one-semester commitment
as visiting scholar to Mills College beginning
next fall, and then will return to Stanford
spring quarter.
Bern has decided to stay, she said, because
"certain decisions we can't role-play, and can't
foresee their effect. 1 realized that it wasn't the
right decision now to leave."
History Corner offices moved
Offices in the History Corner were relocated
this summer for rehabilitation of the
70-year-old corner of the Main Quad.
The History Department is now located ithe
old Law School Annex in the Quad, vacated
due to construction of the new law school
buildings. The Spanish and Portuguese
Department, also previously housed in the
History Corner, will be temporarily located at
Mariposa House on Salvatierra Street.
Stanford's eventual goal, according to
Edward Shaw, executive assistant to the
provost, is to move as many of the Humanities
and Sciences (Hand S) departments as possible
to the Quad.
Thus, the Political Science Department will
move next year into the old Law School
proper. When reconstruction of the History
Corner is complete, one or more Hand S
departments will take its place in the Law
Annex.
New bus route to campus
A new Santa Clara County bus line was
added this past summer to complement Route
50's service to Stanford.
The new route 24 will service Palm Drive
and the tip of the Quad via El Camino Real,
Page Mill Road and Foothill Expressway.
Route 50 includes stops in East Palo Alto, the
Stanford Shopping Center, the Medical Center
and the Quad.
Plans to establish an arterial bus route
around campus have essentially fallen through,
however.
Last year former ASSU Vice President
Quinn Mayer studied the possibility of
extending the existing Santa Clara County
Transit District bus routes to include Stanford
if the 90-bus Dial-A-Ride service failed.
A study he did last year showed that
two-thirds of the students here would pay 25
cents a ride for bus service that comes within a
block of their residence.
However, when Dial-A-Ride folded in May,
no students or members of the new Council of
Presidents or the Administration followed up
on the plan, according to Jim Pott, transit
director.
All the Dial-A-Ride buses have since been
redeployed to other routes, Pott said.

BUS SERVICE — The Santa Clara County Transit District announced this summer that it was
expanding its service from the campus to areas adjacent to Stanford. New route 24 will service
Palm Drive and the tip of the Quad via El Camino Real, Page Mill Road and Foothill
Expressway.
