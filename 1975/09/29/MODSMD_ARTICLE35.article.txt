## Spartans surprise ineffective Cards 
### DAVE SMITH 
"Michigan and San Jose State
don't sound like they're in the
same league," admitted Stanford
Football Coach Jack
Christiansen on Saturday. "But
they just might be."
If the two teams'
performances against the
Cardinals are the standard for
comparison, though, maybe
Coach Chris is wrong. San Jose
State certainly looked a lot
better.
By the time the Spartans had
dumped Stanford by a
deceptively close 36-34
Saturday, Cardinal fans set at
ease by Stanford's 19-19 tie of
powerful Michigan the week
before had several good reasons
to start fidgeting again.
And those who thought the
quarterback shuffle was passe at
the Farm had to be surprised

when starter Mike Cordova, who
came into the game as the
nation's total offense leader and
Sports Illustrated player of the
week, lasted only one half and
looked — well, as Christiansen
put it, "Mike Cordova didn't
throw the ball well."
Not too great
That was not a harsh
judgement. In 16 attempts
Cordova unloaded one dandy, a
35-yard sideline pass to Tony
Hill that set up the Cards' only
first-half score. He completed
five other passes for a total of 27
yards. And that was about it.
Meanwhile, San Jose State's
seemingly unstoppable passing
attack got rolling in the second
quarter, with a quarterback who
heaved so many accurate bombs
that it looked as if he ought to
be a serious threat to take over
Cordova's total offense lead

himself.
In fact, it was only Roger
Proffitt, who had thrown for an
all-time Spartan low of three
yards in the previous week's 5-0
San Jose win over anemic
Oregon.
"The coach told me he'd
stick with me," said Proffitt
after the game. "He said he
hoped I'd bounce back." It was
quite a rebound.
First quarter defense
In the first quarter the
Cardinal defense sagged at times,
but a few strong plays (three
successful blitzes by linebackers
Geb Church and Rich Merlo, a
long field goal try partially
blocked by Jeff Barton) kept
San Jose State scoreless while
the Cordova-led Cards could
manage only one first down.
But when with one minute
left in the quarter, Stanford's
Mike Michel fumbled the snap
and got off his worst punt — it
didn't even make the line of
scrimmage — of a very bad day,
Stanford's defense had its cue to
fall apart. When the half ended,
the Cards were behind by 23
points.
All five of San Jose's
second-quarter scores were set
up by plays that will provide

more than mild embarassment to
Cardinal defensive backs
reviewing the game films this
week. The Spartans' superb
flanker, Gary Maddocks, got
behind freshman Savann
Thompson, one of two new
starters in the secondary, to
make a lunging grab of a 51-yard
bomb to the one yard-line just
before the first San Jose
touchdown.

29 yards. On the next play the
Spartans scored again.
Christiansen, a form&r
defensive back himself, was
philosophical after the contest.
"I don't know how in the hell
the ball kept getting through

there," he said. "It could be that
their receivers were just making
great catches. Then again, it
could be that our pass defense
was absolutely terrible."
Even so, the Cards might have
won the game had they
somehow been able to come up

with an unusual specialist: an
onside kicker. Stanford tried
three onside kickoffs in the
second half, and the failure of all
three didn't help the Cards'
comeback battle any.
Neither did most of the third
