## Spartans surprise ineffective Cards 
### DAVE SMITH 
"Michigan and San Jose State
don't sound like they're in the
same league," admitted Stanford
Football Coach Jack
Christiansen on Saturday. "But
they just might be."
If the two teams'
performances against the
Cardinals are the standard for
comparison, though, maybe
Coach Chris is wrong. San Jose
State certainly looked a lot
better.
By the time the Spartans had
dumped Stanford by a
deceptively close 36-34
Saturday, Cardinal fans set at
ease by Stanford's 19-19 tie of
powerful Michigan the week
before had several good reasons
to start fidgeting again.
And those who thought the
quarterback shuffle was passe at
the Farm had to be surprised

when starter Mike Cordova, who
came into the game as the
nation's total offense leader and
Sports Illustrated player of the
week, lasted only one half and
looked — well, as Christiansen
put it, "Mike Cordova didn't
throw the ball well."
Not too great
That was not a harsh
judgement. In 16 attempts
Cordova unloaded one dandy, a
35-yard sideline pass to Tony
Hill that set up the Cards' only
first-half score. He completed
five other passes for a total of 27
yards. And that was about it.
Meanwhile, San Jose State's
seemingly unstoppable passing
attack got rolling in the second
quarter, with a quarterback who
heaved so many accurate bombs
that it looked as if he ought to
be a serious threat to take over
Cordova's total offense lead

himself.
In fact, it was only Roger
Proffitt, who had thrown for an
all-time Spartan low of three
yards in the previous week's 5-0
San Jose win over anemic
Oregon.
"The coach told me he'd
stick with me," said Proffitt
after the game. "He said he
hoped I'd bounce back." It was
quite a rebound.
First quarter defense
In the first quarter the
Cardinal defense sagged at times,
but a few strong plays (three
successful blitzes by linebackers
Geb Church and Rich Merlo, a
long field goal try partially
blocked by Jeff Barton) kept
San Jose State scoreless while
the Cordova-led Cards could
manage only one first down.
But when with one minute
left in the quarter, Stanford's
Mike Michel fumbled the snap
and got off his worst punt — it
didn't even make the line of
scrimmage — of a very bad day,
Stanford's defense had its cue to
fall apart. When the half ended,
the Cards were behind by 23
points.
All five of San Jose's
second-quarter scores were set
up by plays that will provide

more than mild embarassment to
Cardinal defensive backs
reviewing the game films this
week. The Spartans' superb
flanker, Gary Maddocks, got
behind freshman Savann
Thompson, one of two new
starters in the secondary, to
make a lunging grab of a 51-yard
bomb to the one yard-line just
before the first San Jose
touchdown.

29 yards. On the next play the
Spartans scored again.
Christiansen, a form&r
defensive back himself, was
philosophical after the contest.
"I don't know how in the hell
the ball kept getting through

there," he said. "It could be that
their receivers were just making
great catches. Then again, it
could be that our pass defense
was absolutely terrible."
Even so, the Cards might have
won the game had they
somehow been able to come up

with an unusual specialist: an
onside kicker. Stanford tried
three onside kickoffs in the
second half, and the failure of all
three didn't help the Cards'
comeback battle any.
Neither did most of the third
quarter. There were a few bright
spots, including some tough
running by fullback Don
Stevenson, a juggling
interception by safety Gerald
Wilson, and two successive
15-yard penalties against the
Spartans that set up a safety,
Wilson blocking a punt just
beyond teammate Jeff Barton's
reach and out of the end zone.
But the new quarterback,
Guy Benjamin, had his
customary bad first series (two
of his first three passes were
almost intercepted), and at the
end of the quarter the Cards had
made up only two points of
their huge halftime deficit.
Then sophomore fullback

John Finley, who had been
listed as "doubtful" for the
game because of an injured wrist
and infected tonsils, carried the
ball three plays in a row, gaining
33 yards and scoring his first
varsity touchdown.
For the next 11 minutes the
Cards were stymied again, but it
wasn't as if the offense didn't
try. Christiansen even ordered
two flea-flicker plays that
worked for a total of 3 yards.
One of them saw Tony Hill, a
star quarterback in high school,
return as a passer, but tight end
Ted Pappas couldn't quite hang
on to Hill's throw.
When the Stanford defense
suffered a small collapse and San
Jose State's Lou Rodriguez
punched a 29-yard field goal
with less than three minutes left
to play, the game surely looked
out of reach. And it was, but
just barely.
Time for ten
Stanford had time for ten
more plays, and they were all
Guy Benjamin passes. Six were
complete, two resulted in long
pass-interference penalties
against the Spartans. And in two
minutes and five seconds, the
Cardinals had 15 points that
looked almost impossibly easy,
with Benjamin's throws to Hill,
Bill Singler and Dave Strong
smooth and beautifully timed.
Unfortunately, the Cards
were still two points behind
when they had to kick off to
San Jose with only 31 seconds
left. With the remaining
Stanford fans shouting for a
repeat of the final-second field
goal that won last year's Big
Game, Michel dribbled the
kickoff, some Stanford players
fell on it — but the ball traveled
less than the necessary ten yards,
San Jose took possession, and
the Cards were powerless to

keep the clock from running
out.
After the game, Christiansen
announced that he would stay
with Cordova as the starter for
next week's home contest
against Army. "If the starter
plays the way he did today, the
change might come a little
sooner next time," he said.
For the road
But there was little question
which Stanford quarterback
looked better on Saturday. And
since Cordova seems to save his
best games for the road, local
fans seem to have a definite
Banjamin bias. As one fan put it
a little bluntly, "Everyone
knows that Guy Benjamin's the
better quarterback."
Benjamin might have earned a
few more fans if he hadn't
waited quite so long to unleash
his best passes. "Sure, it takes a
while to warm up and get
adjusted to your receivers,"
mused Benjamin in the locker
room, "but wouldn't it be great
if we could just throw out the
first part and play a two-minute
game?"
Or maybe the Stanford
coaches would be content if
they could get their team to play
as if it were a two-minute game.
Cardinal notes: Benjamin's
game totals brought his season
record to 19 completions in 30
attempts; Cordova is 47 of
98 Tony Hill retained his
national receiving lead; his six
catches included four on the last
two touchdown drives.
"We were too close to the
hash marks," said Benjamin,
commenting on the failure of
the Cards' razzle-dazzle plays,
"but 1 hope you'll be seeing
more of those this
season.".. San Jose's Proffitt
was named offensive player of
the game.
