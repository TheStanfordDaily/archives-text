Another bomb
After Stanford's touchdown,
Spartan running back Rick Kane
got open for 33 yards. That set
up a field goal. On the next
series, a pass-interference call
against safety Rich Waters was
followed by a scoring lob from
Proffitt to Maurice Hill, while
four defenders, clustered in
front of Hill, reached for the ball
like a gang of exuberant but
sadly arthritic seals.
Despite tight double-cover
age, Maddocks made a fabulous
catch for a 39-yard touchdown,
and after Cordova threw an
interception at the Card 36,
Maddocks got away for another
