# Despite no wins, trip wasn't all bad

ANN ARBOR, Mich. -
Sandwich a week in Berea, Ohio
between games against two of
the nation's top-ten ranked
teams, and you can understand
why pre season prospects looked
grim for Stanford's unranked
football squad.
Berea, Ohio????
The Cards' schedule called for
consecutive away games, first
against Penn State and then
Michigan, so to avoid excess
traveling the coaching staff
decided to keep the team East
between games.
"I know the players weren't
too happy about it,"

commented Head Coach Jack
Christiansen, "but since we had
to be back for the Michigan
game anyway, it made sense to
stay back East after playing
Penn State."
Early start
After a full day of traveling,
the Cards opened the season
against a well-prepared Penn
State team. Even though the
Cards ended up on the short side
of the final 34-14 score, they
managed to stay close
throughout the first half.
Stanford kept right up with
the Nittany Lions, and trailed by
only seven at the half, 21-14.
The Cards scored all of their

points in the second quarter on
two impressive drives
coordinated by quarterback
Mike Cordova.
Any hopes of a second-half
comeback were lost after
fullback Don Stevenson fumbled
the ball away on the Cards'
first-offensive play. Penn State
drove the ball in right away for a
touchdown, and later added two
field goals.
Big offense
After the game, Penn State's
Head Coach Joe Paterno
credited Stanford's offensive
play: "Stanford, in the first half,
was superb. I don't think
anybody could play better
offense than they did .. .in the
first half. If they had kept it up
in the second half, it would have
been a very tough game."
After the game, the Cards
headed for Baldwin-Wallace
College in Berea for the week's
practices. "Baldwin-Wallace
College had the facilities we
needed, including artificial turf,
so we stayed there," explained
Chris, "I must admit there was
really nothing for the players to
do there â€” no girls or anything."
So the Cards spent the week
shoring up the defense in
preparation for Michigan's
Wolverines. And it looked like
an impossible task.
Tough opposition
While Stanford was playing
Penn State, the Wolverines were
busy running right through
Wisconsin, 23-6. Tailback Gordie
Bell gained over 200 yards for
Michigan, and the Stanford line
looked like it might not ever be
able to stop him.
The coaches instituted a
defense especially created to
stop Michigan's option offense,
and it worked well. Card safety
Gerald Wilson was all over Bell
