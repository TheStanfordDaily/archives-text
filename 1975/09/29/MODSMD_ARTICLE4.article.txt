# Employes wage parking battle
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Stanford faculty and staff are
utilizing a lawsuit and a boycott to
combat the University's new parking
registration system.
The system, which became effective
on Sept. 16, requires all faculty, staff
and students to register their vehicles.
Faculty may purchase a "Reserve"
permit for $48 per year and staff may
purchase a "Staff" permit for $40 per
year. Faculty and staff may also
request a free "General" "G" permit.
On-campus students may purchase
a permit for $15 per year and
off-campus students can purchase a
permit for convenient parking for $32.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include
United Stanford Employees (USE),
Stanford firefighters, and faculty and
staff. Parkers without registration
permits are charged with violating a
California Vehicle Code section which
they claim is unconstitutional because
it gives arbitrary authority to the
Stanford Board of Trustees. They also
argue that this authority has no

guidelines and that the parking fee is a
tax which the University has no right
to levy.
'A different status'
USE Pres. Jim Berk, one of the
plaintiffs in the suit, said "students
were excluded from this suit because
the faculty and staff have a different
status — they are on the job. A job
entails a contract and collective
bargaining. The University believes it is
its right to charge unilaterally a
parking fee. We're not prepared to
suffer a reduction in pay to work
here."
Stanford Commuters Rebel Against
Pay Parking (SCRAP) is conducting a
boycott against the parking system.
SCRAP supporters include Stanford
firefighters, residents, interns and
surgeons, nurses and others.
SCRAP has urged supporters who
are ticketed to bring their tickets to
the USE office near the eating clubs or
to the Medical Center student lounge
from 12 to 1 p.m. SCRAP has also
advised staff as to means of
individually defending the tickets.
Two weeks ago, faculty and staff
members parked only in the free
"General" lots; last week, they shifted
to the "Reserve" lots and ticketing
began.
Some 3600 out of 4800 faculty and
staff members have requested "G"
permits, but there are only about 3000
free parking spaces.
The shortage of "G" spaces is
particularly acute at the Medical
Center, where all the "G" lots are full,
forcing people to park illegally in lots
for which they don't have the proper
permit or in "no parking" areas. Berk
terms this "entrapment by the
University."
'G' lots are inconvenient
The "G" lots are further away from
the campus structures than the
"Reserve" lots. Besides the
inconvenience of walking, commuters
claim there is insufficient security at
some of these lots.
For example, one resident, returned
to his car near the Medical Center one
evening and found the headlights
