on almost every play, stopping
Bell so effectively that Wilson
was awarded Pac-8 Defensive
Player of the Week honors.
Cordova played one of his
best games ever in leading the
Cards to a near upset and a
19-19 tie. Cordova completed 24
of 44 for 290 yards and two
touchdowns, good enough to be
selected Sports Illustrated's
offensive player of the week.
Flanker Tony Hill played his
second All-American caliber
game in a row, grabbing eight
passes for 126 yards and a
touchdown, making him the
nation's top receiver statistically,
and the Pac-B's co-Offensive
Player of the Week.
Cordova asserts that all the
individual honors given to the
team show that "the Michigan
game was really a team effort,
not any one individual's effort."
Stanford had at least three
possible chances to change the
outcome of the game in its
favor. Mike Langford missed the
first PAT, Safety Rich Waters
was beaten in a prevent defense
situation for Michigan's first
score on the last play of the first
half and Cordova had a first and
goal situation on the four-yard
line with less than a minute to
play.
But despite the missed
opportunities, the game was

clearly a success from Stanford's
viewpoint. Langford kicked two
clutch field goals in the final
minutes of the game. Cordova
led the team masterfully and the
whole defense, "Hecker's
Deckers," played almost
flawlessly all afternoon.
Chris summed it up quite
simply. "We're coming home
winners."

Every time USC plays in the
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum,
it seems to set at least one new
record — and Saturday was no
exception. Trojan Coach John
McKay became the winningest
coach in Pacific Eight history, as
his third-ranked Trojans
outlasted Purdue 19-6. The win
gave McKay a 16-year record of
122-36-8. The old mark of
121-36-13 was held by Trojan
mentor Howard Harding Jones.
He set his mark from
1925-1940.
The Boilermakers didn't go
down without a fight, though.
Purdue dominated a scoreless
first half, holding the Trojans to
a meager 68-yard rushing total.
But the 90-degree heat and
the new NCAA rule limiting
visiting teams to 48 players
combined to wear down Coach
Alex Agase's Boilermakers.
Purdue held USC tailback Ricky
Bell to just 89 yards, and gave
up only 159 total yards on the
ground to the awesome Trojans.
Bell had rushed for over 200
yards in each of the Trojans first
two games.
Up in scenic Pullman, Wash.,
California asserted itself as a
Pac-8 title contender with a
33-21 win over Washington
State.
Chris: take note
Coach Mike White replaced
starting quarterback Fred Besana
late in the second quarter with
JC transfer Joe Roth and the

move led to California's biggest
offensive show of the year. Bear
tailback Chuck Muncie rushed
for over 100 yards for the third
straight time this season. He
finished the game with 142
yards.
After giving up 28 points to
Tennessee last week, the UCLA
defense was suspect. This week
it's been convicted. Lowly Air
Force rallied for 17 third quarter
points to hand the tenth-ranked
Bruins a 20-20 tie.
The inspired Falcons came
alive in the second half when
kicker Dave Lawson booted a
58-yard field goal early in the
third quarter.
Then the Falcons went wild.
Roverback Ray Wild intercepted
a John Sciarra pass on the next
series and ran unmolested into
the endzone to knot the score at
13-13. The Bruins came back
with a 14 play 80-yard drive, but
Air Force retaliated with the
final scoring drive of the game to
leave the game deadlocked.
Up in Seattle, the James Gang
squeaked out a 14-13 win over
previously unbeaten Navy. The
Navy always plays to win, but it
cost them the game yesterday.
The Midshipmen elected to go
for the two-point conversion
after scoring their final
touchdown with 1:08 left in the
game. But the Huskies' A 1
Burlson batted down Navy
quarterback John Kurowski's
two-point conversion attempt
and coach Don James got his
first win of the year. Burlson
also scored on a 61-yard
interception in the third period.
Gophers go duck-hunting
In Eugene they're probably
wishing basketball season lasted
nine months of the year. The
Ducks had a chance not to lose
their third game of the year after
scoring early in the final period
to tie Minnesota 7-7. But the
Golden Gophers converted a
fourth and five situation at the
Oregon 34 and went on to score
a 37-yard field goal with one
minute remaining.
Oregon State put it all on the
line for USC last week and came
away with a 24-7 loss. This week
the Beavers had little offense
and came away from Kansas
with a 20-0 loss.

Gophers go duck-hunting
In Eugene they're probably
wishing basketball season lasted
nine months of the year. The
Ducks had a chance not to lose
their third game of the year after
scoring early in the final period
to tie Minnesota 7-7. But the
Golden Gophers converted a
fourth and five situation at the
Oregon 34 and went on to score
a 37-yard field goal with one

Oregon State put it all on the
line for USC last week and came
away with a 24-7 loss. This week
the Beavers had little offense

with a 20-0 loss.

Bell so effectively that Wilson
was awarded Pac-8 Defensive
Player of the Week honors.
Cordova played one of his
best games ever in leading the
Cards to a near upset and a
19-19 tie. Cordova completed 24
of 44 for 290 yards and two
touchdowns, good enough to be
selected Sports Illustrated's
offensive player of the week.
Flanker Tony Hill played his
second All-American caliber
game in a row, grabbing eight
passes for 126 yards and a
touchdown, making him the
nation's top receiver statistically,
and the Pac-B's co-Offensive
Player of the Week.
Cordova asserts that all the
individual honors given to the
team show that "the Michigan
game was really a team effort,
not any one individual's effort."
Stanford had at least three
possible chances to change the
outcome of the game in its
favor. Mike Langford missed the
first PAT, Safety Rich Waters
was beaten in a prevent defense
situation for Michigan's first
score on the last play of the first
half and Cordova had a first and
goal situation on the four-yard
line with less than a minute to
play.
But despite the missed
opportunities, the game was

clearly a success from Stanford's
viewpoint. Langford kicked two
clutch field goals in the final
minutes of the game. Cordova
led the team masterfully and the
whole defense, "Hecker's
Deckers," played almost
flawlessly all afternoon.

it seems to set at least one new

gave McKay a 16-year record of
122-36-8. The old mark of
121-36-13 was held by Trojan
mentor Howard Harding Jones.
He set his mark from
1925-1940.

Purdue dominated a scoreless
first half, holding the Trojans to

outlasted Purdue 19-6. The win
gave McKay a 16-year record of
122-36-8. The old mark of
121-36-13 was held by Trojan
mentor Howard Harding Jones.
He set his mark from
1925-1940.
The Boilermakers didn't go
down without a fight, though.
Purdue dominated a scoreless
first half, holding the Trojans to
a meager 68-yard rushing total.
But the 90-degree heat and
the new NCAA rule limiting
visiting teams to 48 players
combined to wear down Coach
Alex Agase's Boilermakers.
Purdue held USC tailback Ricky
Bell to just 89 yards, and gave
up only 159 total yards on the
ground to the awesome Trojans.
Bell had rushed for over 200
yards in each of the Trojans first
two games.
Up in scenic Pullman, Wash.,
California asserted itself as a
Pac-8 title contender with a
33-21 win over Washington
State.
Chris: take note
Coach Mike White replaced
starting quarterback Fred Besana
late in the second quarter with
JC transfer Joe Roth and the

move led to California's biggest
offensive show of the year. Bear
tailback Chuck Muncie rushed
for over 100 yards for the third
straight time this season. He
finished the game with 142
yards.
After giving up 28 points to
Tennessee last week, the UCLA
defense was suspect. This week
it's been convicted. Lowly Air
Force rallied for 17 third quarter
points to hand the tenth-ranked
Bruins a 20-20 tie.
The inspired Falcons came
alive in the second half when
kicker Dave Lawson booted a
58-yard field goal early in the
third quarter.
Then the Falcons went wild.
Roverback Ray Wild intercepted
a John Sciarra pass on the next
series and ran unmolested into
the endzone to knot the score at
13-13. The Bruins came back
with a 14 play 80-yard drive, but
Air Force retaliated with the
final scoring drive of the game to
leave the game deadlocked.
Up in Seattle, the James Gang
squeaked out a 14-13 win over
previously unbeaten Navy. The
Navy always plays to win, but it
cost them the game yesterday.
The Midshipmen elected to go
for the two-point conversion
after scoring their final
touchdown with 1:08 left in the
game. But the Huskies' A 1
Burlson batted down Navy
quarterback John Kurowski's
two-point conversion attempt
and coach Don James got his
first win of the year. Burlson
also scored on a 61-yard
interception in the third period.
Gophers go duck-hunting
In Eugene they're probably
wishing basketball season lasted
nine months of the year. The
Ducks had a chance not to lose
their third game of the year after
scoring early in the final period
to tie Minnesota 7-7. But the
Golden Gophers converted a
fourth and five situation at the
Oregon 34 and went on to score
a 37-yard field goal with one
minute remaining.
Oregon State put it all on the
line for USC last week and came
away with a 24-7 loss. This week
the Beavers had little offense
and came away from Kansas
with a 20-0 loss.

two-game road trip. Cordova is shown here in Stanford's 34-14
opening loss to Penn State.
on almost every play, stopping
Bell so effectively that Wilson
was awarded Pac-8 Defensive
Player of the Week honors.
Cordova played one of his
best games ever in leading the
Cards to a near upset and a
19-19 tie. Cordova completed 24
of 44 for 290 yards and two
touchdowns, good enough to be
selected Sports Illustrated's
offensive player of the week.
Flanker Tony Hill played his
second All-American caliber
game in a row, grabbing eight
passes for 126 yards and a
touchdown, making him the
nation's top receiver statistically,
and the Pac-B's co-Offensive
Player of the Week.
Cordova asserts that all the
individual honors given to the
team show that "the Michigan
game was really a team effort,
not any one individual's effort."
Stanford had at least three
possible chances to change the
outcome of the game in its
favor. Mike Langford missed the
first PAT, Safety Rich Waters
was beaten in a prevent defense
situation for Michigan's first
score on the last play of the first
half and Cordova had a first and
goal situation on the four-yard
line with less than a minute to
play.
But despite the missed
opportunities, the game was

clearly a success from Stanford's
viewpoint. Langford kicked two
clutch field goals in the final
minutes of the game. Cordova
led the team masterfully and the
whole defense, "Hecker's
Deckers," played almost
flawlessly all afternoon.
Chris summed it up quite
simply. "We're coming home
winners."

Every time USC plays in the
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum,
it seems to set at least one new
record — and Saturday was no
exception. Trojan Coach John
McKay became the winningest
coach in Pacific Eight history, as
his third-ranked Trojans
outlasted Purdue 19-6. The win
gave McKay a 16-year record of
122-36-8. The old mark of
