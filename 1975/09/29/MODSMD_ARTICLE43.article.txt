# Watson leads Pro-Am golf field
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
What Tom Watson is doing on
the Stanford Golf Course next
Monday may help the
University's golf programs
produce another Tom Watson.
The first annual Stanford
Pro-Am golf tournament will
bring at least 18 golfers from the
PGA tour to the course where
Watson starred as an
All-American in his collegiate
days.
The Friends of Stanford Golf,
organizers of the event, hope it
will provide Stanford's golf
programs with money for
scholarships.
"What happened was Title IX
[the controversial federal
requirement that schools fund
men's and women's athletic
programs equally or lose federal

funding |," said Bud Finger,
Stanford's golf coach. "They
gave the boys' scholarships to
the girls and this year the boys
will have none."
That decision prompted the
Friends to organize the
tournament, Finger said. "They
believe that golf is the most
outstanding sport at Stanford, in
view of its six national
championships," he said. "The
tournament is a cooperative
effort to keep it that way."
Finger and Richard Harris,
who played golf for Stanford in
the 19605, wrote a letter to
Watson in May, asking his
cooperation. But Watson, who
snagged an 18th-green victory in
the 1975 British Open and
recently won the Byron Nelson
Classic, didn't need to be

reminded of his Stanford roots.
"He beat us to the punch,"
Finger said. "Before we got the
letter off, he volunteered his
help." Watson's wife and
manager, Linda, has helped line
up pros for the. tournament.
Included in the field are PGA
tour winners John Mahaffey,
Bob Wynn, Bob Rossberg,
Buddy Allen, and Pat
Fitzsimons, winner of the Los
Angeles Open. Former San Jose
State standout Ron Cerrudo and
USC alumnus Rod Funseth,
along with Bob Zender, Bill
Rogers, Gary McCord, Jim
Weichers, left-handed Sam
Adams, Chuck Courtney, Dick
Lotz, George Johnson, Buddy
Allen and, of course, Watson, fill
out the pro roster, Finger said
Sunday.
Top money-winner Johnny
Miller will decide today whether
he can attend the tournament,
Finger said.
Each pro will tee off in one
of 21 fivesomes, with amateurs
who pay $250 to enter the
tournament and members of this
year's Stanford golf team. Dave

Baskins, a Stanford golfer last
year who since has turned pro, is
the second alternate for the
remaining three pro spots,
Finger said.
The first prize of $500 isn't
exactly top dollar in big-money
professional golf. "Many of the
pros are coming as a favor to
Stanford, or to Watson," Finger
said. And many of them never
played on the Stanford course,
which ranks as one of the
world's finest, Finger added.
But no corners are being cut
to ensure that there will be a
second annual Stanford tourney.
Prize giveaways are to include
four 24-karat solid gold putters
donated by Wells Fargo Bank,
dinners at Ming's restaurant and
weekends at Rickey's Hyatt
House, where the visiting pros
will stay.
"We just want to make
everybody happy and make sure
that it's an annual event," Finger
said. Student gallery tickets are
on sale at the golf course pro
shop for $2.

That decision prompted the
Friends to organize the
tournament, Finger said. "They
believe that golf is the most
outstanding sport at Stanford, in
view of its six national
championships," he said. "The
tournament is a cooperative
effort to keep it that way."
Finger and Richard Harris,
who played golf for Stanford in
the 19605, wrote a letter to
Watson in May, asking his
cooperation. But Watson, who
snagged an 18th-green victory in
the 1975 British Open and
recently won the Byron Nelson
Classic, didn't need to be

reminded of his Stanford roots.
"He beat us to the punch,"
Finger said. "Before we got the
letter off, he volunteered his
help." Watson's wife and
manager, Linda, has helped line
up pros for the. tournament.
Included in the field are PGA
tour winners John Mahaffey,
Bob Wynn, Bob Rossberg,
Buddy Allen, and Pat
Fitzsimons, winner of the Los
Angeles Open. Former San Jose
State standout Ron Cerrudo and
USC alumnus Rod Funseth,
along with Bob Zender, Bill
Rogers, Gary McCord, Jim
Weichers, left-handed Sam
Adams, Chuck Courtney, Dick
Lotz, George Johnson, Buddy
Allen and, of course, Watson, fill
out the pro roster, Finger said
Sunday.
Top money-winner Johnny
Miller will decide today whether
he can attend the tournament,
Finger said.
Each pro will tee off in one
of 21 fivesomes, with amateurs
who pay $250 to enter the
tournament and members of this
year's Stanford golf team. Dave

Baskins, a Stanford golfer last
year who since has turned pro, is
the second alternate for the
remaining three pro spots,
Finger said.
The first prize of $500 isn't
exactly top dollar in big-money
professional golf. "Many of the
pros are coming as a favor to
Stanford, or to Watson," Finger
said. And many of them never
played on the Stanford course,
which ranks as one of the
world's finest, Finger added.
But no corners are being cut
to ensure that there will be a
second annual Stanford tourney.
Prize giveaways are to include
four 24-karat solid gold putters
donated by Wells Fargo Bank,
dinners at Ming's restaurant and
weekends at Rickey's Hyatt
House, where the visiting pros
will stay.
"We just want to make
everybody happy and make sure
that it's an annual event," Finger
said. Student gallery tickets are
on sale at the golf course pro
shop for $2.

BACK TO BACK GOLF—Alumnus Tom Watson, winner of this
year's British Open and World Series of Golf, will return to
Stanford Oct. 6 to play in the first Stanford Pro-Am tournament.
The tournament is designed to help raise money for men's golf
scholarships.
What Tom Watson is doing on
the Stanford Golf Course next
Monday may help the
University's golf programs
produce another Tom Watson.
The first annual Stanford
Pro-Am golf tournament will
bring at least 18 golfers from the
PGA tour to the course where
Watson starred as an
All-American in his collegiate
days.
The Friends of Stanford Golf,
organizers of the event, hope it
will provide Stanford's golf
programs with money for
scholarships.
"What happened was Title IX
[the controversial federal
requirement that schools fund
men's and women's athletic
programs equally or lose federal

funding |," said Bud Finger,
Stanford's golf coach. "They
gave the boys' scholarships to
the girls and this year the boys
will have none."
That decision prompted the
Friends to organize the
tournament, Finger said. "They

outstanding sport at Stanford, in
