Gary Maddocks (22) leaps high
in front of Paul Skrabo (26)
to pull in a pass
from San Jose quarterback
Roger Proffitt.

Spartan tailback Marv Stewart (44) eludes the Cardinal's Jeff Barton (49) as teammates Rudy Berglund (62)
and Tim Toews (64) clear a path through the Stanford defense. Duncan McColl (77) and Mike Wilkinson (91)
were defending. San Jose was able to run against the Cards
for good yardage in a number of crucial fourth down situations.


Under just about any circumstances, losing is disgusting. But
when you lose to a school like San Jose State, which isn't even
considered a "major college" by NCAA standards, it's downright
embarrassing.
And Stanford had to lose to them on regional television, to
boot.
Make no mistake, the Spartans looked good. Real good.
Quarterback Roger Proffitt, who could barely complete a handoff
(much less a pass) last week against Oregon, literally tore the
Stanford defensive secondary apart.
And Wilson Fauinuima proved he nught very well be one of the
best defensive linemen on the coast. This studly Samoan wreaked
havoc on the Stanford offence throughout the contest (right, Guy-
Ben jamin?).
OK, Stanford came back after being down 30-7 at the half, but
the defeat was still embarrassing. All day, Spartan coaches and
players ridiculed "Pacific Eight pride." And after Saturday, the
Pac-8 Cards had little to be proud of.


Fullback John Finlay (20) crashes in for a fourth quarter touchdown, but Wilson Faumuina (74)
stops another Card drive by sacking Guy Benjamin (below). Rick Kane (right) runs for a short gain
in the first quarter and is stopped by Savann Thompson (33).
