# SCIENTOLOGY:
## AN OPEN LETTER TO S.I. HAYAKAWA & THE S.F. EXAMINER 
### 
AS MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLO
GY we are appalled at the publication (1/18/75) of a
defamatory editorial on Scientology by Mr S. I.
Hayakawa without subsequent publication of any of the
many replies to that editorial sent to the Examiner from
Scientologists.
Over the years, many articles critical of Scientology
have appeared in the media, while supporters of the
church have rarely been able to get their views aired.
Since the early 50's, the American Medical Association,
the American Psychiatric Association and the World
Federation of Mental Health have conducted cam
paigns. both overt and covert, to discredit and outlaw
Scientology. The details of this campaign are available
in the book The Hidden Story of Scientology written by
(non-Scientologist) Omar Garrison.
Why should these groups single out Scientology for
attack? The answer is that Scientology is more of a

threat to them than are other churches, and this tor
several reasons:
(1) Scientology's pastoral counselling techniques are
effective in a way that neither psychiatric treatment nor
other religious therapies are, in that results are
uniformly and predictably good.
(2) Scientology is actively engaged in stamping out
psychiatric abuses such as indiscriminate use of
electroconvulsive "therapy" and psychosurgery (see
FREEDOM, the journal of the Church of Scientology).
(3) Scientology is the largest religion involved in
spihtual/mental healing, now comprising many millions
of members. The number of Scientologists with practi
cal knowledge of its pastoral counselling techniques is
far greater than the number of psychiatrists.
(4) Scientology is the fastest-growing religion in the
world.
The result of this campaign has been that we can
learn almost nothing about Scientology or Dianetics

through the mass media. It appears that at one time in
the past, "Authorities" encouraged the publication of
some derogatory articles, and ovety uninformed writer
since then has become a link i r a closed but expanding
chain of ignorant "Authorities," each one citing the
opinions of others as "fact," and none taking the trouble
to examine first hand the subject they condemn with
such vitriol.
People need accurate information about Scientology.
It can no longer be considered an "obscure cult" but
must be classed as one of the world's major religions,
in the best tradition of those spiritual disciplines that
have sought to free individuals from suffering and bring
them to a state of spiritual enlightenment. For that
reason, we are taking it upon ourselves to reprint
significant portions of Mr. Hayakawa's article, "Dianet
ics: Escape from responsibility," together with three
letters in response to it that the Examiner did not print.

some derogatory articles, and ovety uninformed writer
since then has become a link i r a closed but expanding
chain of ignorant "Authorities," each one citing the
opinions of others as "fact," and none taking the trouble
to examine first hand the subject they condemn with
such vitriol.
People need accurate information about Scientology.
It can no longer be considered an "obscure cult" but
must be classed as one of the world's major religions,
in the best tradition of those spiritual disciplines that
have sought to free individuals from suffering and bring
them to a state of spiritual enlightenment. For that
reason, we are taking it upon ourselves to reprint
significant portions of Mr. Hayakawa's article, "Dianet
ics: Escape from responsibility," together with three
letters in response to it that the Examiner did not print.
AS MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLO
GY we are appalled at the publication (1/18/75) of a
defamatory editorial on Scientology by Mr S. I.
Hayakawa without subsequent publication of any of the
many replies to that editorial sent to the Examiner from
Scientologists.
Over the years, many articles critical of Scientology
have appeared in the media, while supporters of the
church have rarely been able to get their views aired.
Since the early 50's, the American Medical Association,
the American Psychiatric Association and the World
Federation of Mental Health have conducted cam
paigns. both overt and covert, to discredit and outlaw
Scientology. The details of this campaign are available
in the book The Hidden Story of Scientology written by
(non-Scientologist) Omar Garrison.
Why should these groups single out Scientology for
attack? The answer is that Scientology is more of a

threat to them than are other churches, and this tor
several reasons:
(1) Scientology's pastoral counselling techniques are
effective in a way that neither psychiatric treatment nor
other religious therapies are, in that results are
uniformly and predictably good.
(2) Scientology is actively engaged in stamping out
psychiatric abuses such as indiscriminate use of
electroconvulsive "therapy" and psychosurgery (see
FREEDOM, the journal of the Church of Scientology).
(3) Scientology is the largest religion involved in
spihtual/mental healing, now comprising many millions
of members. The number of Scientologists with practi
cal knowledge of its pastoral counselling techniques is
far greater than the number of psychiatrists.
(4) Scientology is the fastest-growing religion in the
world.
The result of this campaign has been that we can
learn almost nothing about Scientology or Dianetics

through the mass media. It appears that at one time in
the past, "Authorities" encouraged the publication of
some derogatory articles, and ovety uninformed writer
since then has become a link i r a closed but expanding
chain of ignorant "Authorities," each one citing the
opinions of others as "fact," and none taking the trouble
to examine first hand the subject they condemn with
such vitriol.
