Dianetics: Escape from responsibility
"One obvious attraction of Scientology to those
whom it attracts is its claim that 'the single source
of mental derangement is discovered and demon
strated . . by dianetics,' and that 'it contains a
therapeutic technique by which can be treated all
inorganic mental ills and all organic psychosomatic
ills, with assurance of complete cure.' (p. 6)
"The foregoing is quoted from the former
science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, who wrote
Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,'
the bible of the Church of Scientology.
"All our psychological problems, Hubbard
claims, are caused by what he calls engrams,
which are "not memories, but cellular levei
recordings of emotional or physical pain.
"When these engrams are restimulated' by
sights or sounds or sensations associated with the
original or painful experience, the intelligent part of
the human mind (the analyzer,' which is a perfect
computer') gets shut off, says Hubbard, and a robot
like reactive mind' takes over.
"So the is a central idea in Hubbard's
system. What is the scientific status of this
concept? The term is defined in J. H. Masser
man's 'Principles of Dynamic Psychiatry' (1946) as
The supposed neural pathway or trace left in the
nervous system by every sensorimotor experience.'
The American Heritage Dictionary defines it as a
protoplasmic alteration hypothesized to occur... to
account for memory.' The engram is a supposition,
a hypothesis.
"All the powers that Hubbard attributes to the
engram — to record the past and disrupt the
present — are the product of his science fiction
imagination.
"And what an imagination it is: Hubbard says
we not only acquire engrams of the kind he
describes throughout life, but we started getting
(them) long before we were born. His crudely
obscene account of life in the womb reveals a
deep hatred and distrust of women . . .
"Despite its preposterous theories, the Church
of Scientology seems to be thriving It claims 3.2
million members in the United States and abroad.
"Why is it popular? The reason seems clear. It
is the most perfect copout offered by any
psychological theory It enables the believer to
say. If I am stupid or neurotic or confused, if I
can't get along with people, if my life is a mess,
it's all because of engrams acquired when I was
unconscious and before I was born. So don't
blame me. It's not my fault! IT'S NOT MY
FAULT!!!
"A comforting thought indeed, if you can
believe it."

Dear Professor Hayakawa,
LET ME START BY ACKNOWLEDGING A
DEBT of long standing. My early discovery of
(your book) Language, Thought and Action had an
excellent effect on my subsequent career in
philosophy I still regard the fundamentals of
semantics not as clever debating points for a
beginning class in English, but as principles of a
true philosophy of science . . .
So I am a little disturbed by your column . . .
which seems to take a polemical attitude, rather
than one of objective observation. Your key point
against Hubbard seems to be the doubtful
scientific status of J. H Masserman's "engram." In
contrast, Hubbard's own (more recent) definition of
the term depends on the hypothesis of a section
of the human mind that "thinks in pictures,'' by
mechanisms of associative memory. An "engram"
is then a mental picture of a past incident
("memory'' has not quite the right connotations)
containing pain and unconsciousness. Hubbard
chose the word "engram" for this technical
concept at a time (1950) when he was speculating
that storage of such mental pictures might occur
chemically in the human body. (None of Hubbard's
psychological theories . . . depends on a particular
physical storage method for these pictures.)
Hubbard's claims for his psychology of mental
pictures are curiously operational, and objectively
testable; in this respect he differs from most
theorists of human psyche . . . Hubbard's
philosophy of science is distinctly phenomenologi
cal, in the best traditions of Edmund Husserl in
Europe, and philosophical Buddhism in Asia.
Personally, I have not found Scientology to
provide a psychological copout. In fact, Hubbard
claims that ALL mental problems, and ALL
problems in life, originate with a denial of
responsibility! The required therapy is thus a
gentle but accelerating encouragement of the
subject to re-own his own mind, and be fully
responsible for all its contents and activities.
In short, I am guessing that were you to
investigate Hubbard and Scientology more com
pletely, with that perfect scientific skepticism which
is so rare, even among those who are supposedly
trained in it, you would find much to agree with I
find it ironic that one who has so much in common
with Hubbard should ridicule him publicly; even
more so that a master of semantics should quote
a 25-year old speculation out of context and use
A s definition of B's technical term as an argument
against B's theory!
If you and I must agree to disagree (as civilized
men will, rather than hate each other) then let it
be amicably Hubbard has publicly admired "cocky
little Hayakawa." Could you af least do him the
courtesy of taking him seriously?
Yours truly,
Lewis E. Randall

Dear Dr. Hayakawa
YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE you
should have received a letter from Mr. Lewis
Randall . . Lewis is an old friend of mine, a
classmate at Harvard ('64), and was the first
person to introduce me to the admittedly unlikely
sounding school of thought based on the work of
Mr. Hubbard, "the former science fiction writer."
Like Mr. Randall, I am a person who has felt
and come to appreciate your own influence in my
life: I received my Master's in Early Childhood
Education at San Francisco State during your
tenure there I wish that I could tell you honestly
. . . that I respected you and your actions there at
the time, I cannot. My own awareness of . . .
personal responsibility was sufficiently dim in
those days that in fact I condemned you. That to
have done so was wrong, and a reflection not on
your actions but upon my own irresponsibility, was
an insight which I came upon only, in fact, after a
considerable degree of exposure to Scientology.
I have long since come to applaud your
courage and the high sense of personal ethics
which you demonstrated at San Francisco State.
Again like Mr. Randall, I find myself wholly unable
to applaud the quality of your efforts on the
subject of Mr. Hubbard. I suspect that you would
dismiss out of hand any Article about yourself
which contained reference to "the former bed
wetter, S. I Hayakawa." Certainly I would tend to do
so. Why, then, the appearance of the argument ad
hominem in your own article? In castigating Hub
bard entirely in the absence of evidence based on
your own experience, you assume the guise of the
myriad hacks who have done the same before you.
By virtue both of your work and your convictions,
your place is not among them. The guise fits you ill.
I realize that the pressures inherent in writing
for a deadline may have seemed to preclude the
possibility of genuine investigation into the subject
of Scientology — of the sort that would normally
be required by yourself, of yourself, as a matter of
principle. Nonetheless (and I confess that I quote
Hubbard), "the environment starts to control the
individual the moment he rationalizes away his
inherent full responsibility." In allowing the pressure
of a deadline to affect your better judgment, it
seems clear to me that you have not acted in this
matter as responsibly as you might have.
I would welcome the opportunity to present to
you in person a somewhat different viewpoint on
Hubbard/Dianetics/Scientology than the one you
hold at present You and I met briefly one evening
same time ago . . . and my recollection of that
occasion leads me to suspect that we would both
enjoy making each other's reacquaintance. In any
case, I am
Respectfully yours,
Gerald D. French

Dear Mr Hayakawa,
AS A PSYCHIATRIST AND A SCIENTOLO
GIST, I have had a unique opportunity to observe
and compare the effects of traditional psychother
apies and Scientologic techniques, in my own
hands and in those of others. Scientology and
Dianetic techniques work better and faster than
any other techniques I have observed in relieving
human suffering and increasing ability without
creating either a sense of dependency on the
therapist or a tendency to copout and blame
others for one's troubles. If you talk to a person
who has . . . (received Scientology counselling),
you will observe a highly responsible and causa
tive individual.
I would like to deal further with the issue of the
psychotherapeutic copout. Any theory that at
tempts to explain human behavior by means of
fixed mechanical laws of cause and effect has the
potential liability of becoming a copout such as
you describe. Freud thought that all aspects of
mental behavior were completely determined by
childhood experiences; the behaviorist believes
that all behavior is the inevitable result of present
external stimuli acting on patterns established by
past conditioning. So why single out Scientology for
vituperation in this respect?
In fact, Scientology, since the early '50 s, has
stressed the fact that each person is entirely
responsible for his own condition in life. Present
day misfortunes are brought on oneself in an effort
to justify past harmful acts against others. No
explanation of personal misfortune in terms of
implacable outside forces would ever satisfy a
present-day Scientologist. A reflection of this
philosophy is the fact that in modern Dianetics,
equal weight is given to the . . . (examination of
incidents in which) an individual has caused
others to have painful experiences,
Contained in the idea of complete personal
responsibility is the assumption that an individual
has the power to change the conditions of his life,
in spite of apparent social, physical, or mechanical
impediments to doing so. If this power exists, then
a person must in some way be an unmoved
mover, with the ability to transcend any mere
mechanical cause-and-effect forces of existence.
Such an unmoved mover could only be described
as a non-mechanical or non-material entity, or, in
other words, as a spiritual being. It is for this
reason and not to appear mysterious or to hide
under the mantle of religiosity that Scientology
describes itself as a religion. It js. a religion, in the
tradition of all spiritual disciplines whose intention
is to eliminate human suffering, both physical and
mental, and to restore to individuals their full
freedom and native abilities.
(It) is the mark of a truly responsible person —
which I believe you basically to be. — that when he
finds new data, he alters his point of view to
accommodate the data. I urge you to investigate
Scientology more fully. Talk to a few Scientologists.
Perhaps read a few of the more recent Scientology
publications. If you do this, you will, I think, find that
there is a great deal of agreement between your
views and those of Mr Hubbard.

Yours truly,
Frank A Gerbode 111, M.D

What is true for you is
what you have observed
for yourself. And when
you lose that you have
lost everything.
