THE WORLD WE INHABIT TODAY IS AN
INSANE ASYLUM. Crime, marital discord, drug
addiction, oppressive taxation, and economic
disintegration are prominent aspects of everyday
life The cause of this insanity and destructiveness
is not to be found in political institutions, in poor
nutrition, or in the capitalist or communist econom
ic systems. It is mental aberration in individuals
that causes the world's difficulties.
Psychiatry and psychology have failed our
trust in their ability to solve the problem of mental
aberration. Indeed, coincident with the increased
influence of psychiatric and psychological thought
has come an increase in the world's insanity.
Many current drug problems, for instance, are
iatrogenic (physician-caused). Heroin, methedrine,
LSD and other harmful drugs were made available
by the medical and psychiatric professions — a
gift to mankind of questionable value No psychia
trist would administer a drug if a patient's problem
could be handled by real psychotherapy The
widespread use of drugs in psychiatric practice is
an admission of defeat.

Scientologists are taking up the responsibility
that psychiatrists and psychologists have dropped
Scientology's chief aim is to make the world a
safe and sane place in which to live, with
maximum freedom for each individual It is based
on the premise that every person is basically
good
Only unconscious mental aberrations can cause
a person to act destructively As long as an
individual is unaware of these aberrative forces,
he cannot control them; they control him. In
becoming aware of his own mental aberrations, a
person recognizes himself as their cause. With
this recognition of personal responsibility comes
the ability to take command It can be observed
that a person who is thus in full control of his own
life naturally acts to promote survival and well
being for himself, his family and friends, and any
group he belongs, to, including mankind.
Scientology offers more than a mere promise of
personal freedom It offers (1) a rational and
comprehensive philosophical and psychological
theory, and (2) a well-organized and predictably
workable set of counselling techniques. The end
result is freedom from personal suffering and a

high state of spiritual awareness. These tech
niques have been researched and refined over a
27-year period and thdy work. Scientology, de
monstrably, delivers what it promises
Scientology does require faith or belief of its
adherents. In fact, it is made clear that a person
should remain skeptical unless he has personally
observed and experienced the truth of any theory.
He should never take the word of any authority,
including Hubbard; rather, each person is consid
ered the authority in his own universe His views
should be based on the certainty of personal
observation.
Many people pay lip service to the idea of
freedom, but do not trust human nature enough to
tolerate freedom for others. Despite self-serving
euphemisms, they would rather have others
controlled by social conditioning, drugs, or intimi
dation. This is the psychiatnc viewpoint. Yet each
wants freedom for himself. A true friend to man
values the freedom of others no less than his own.
One can only allow others to be free if he realizes
they are basically good — that they will use their
freedom responsibly.
This is the viewpoint of Scientology
