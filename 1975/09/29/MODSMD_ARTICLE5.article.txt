# Phone Center creates savings
## Pac Tel lowers installation fee 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Phone installation charges to
students have been cut in half this year
because of a new connector system
introduced by Pacific Telephone.
Last year students had to pay $24
for servicemen to activate phones
pre-installed in their rooms. This year,
a Phone Center is renting phones to
students for $12 plus a $5 deposit,
refundable when the phone is

The Phone Center consists of three
trailers stocked with telephone
equipment. They are parked at the
corner of Campus Drive and
Escondido Road, staffed by ten Pacific
Telephone agents, and will be open
from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. every day
until Oct. 10.
Students install phones
Alan Cummings, manager of
student housing, explained that
students living in dormitories can
"select a phone, take it to their room
and plug it into a modular connector
already in the wall." A dial tone will
be available within 24 hours, once
adjustments have been made in the
central office.
Pacific Telephone had been
considering introducing modular
connectors on the campus for several
years. According to Alan Garrett,
manager of Pacific Telephone's Palo
Alto office, the decision to go ahead
this year was made because of "a shift
in priorities" for the use of investment
capital, and because the University of
Southern California "had elected to
proceed" with a similar plan.
"We hope to cut costs this way,"
Garrett explained. Pacific Telephone
calculated that last year each
installation cost the company $57,
largely in office work. Garrett said the
figure for company installation may be
even higher now.
"We have 27 different processes to
go through before you can get a dial
tone," he explained.
System should cut costs
Garrett had no estimates of how
much costs would be cut with the new
system, but said "nationwide cost
studies" show that Phone Centers can
be profitable.
The wall connectors have yet to be
installed in all on-campus housing.
Diane Melvin, a Pacific Telephone
representative, pointed out that the
new tariff for modular connectors was
only approved in late August.
"We didn't have time to do the
fraternities and row houses," she said,
"especially since they have more
varied wiring."
Non-dorm students must wait
All on-campus students not living in
dorms will pay the same rates, but
must wait up to four days for a

serviceman to install the wall
connector.
Non-dorm installations may be a
financial drain on Pacific Telephone
this year, but Garrett said "hopefully
we'll make up the money in the next
few years.
"We'll save money on repair costs.
Instead of replacing a whole set, we
can unplug a part and put in a new
one," he noted.
Garrett noted that "because of our
tariff system, the jack, not the phone,
carries the number. If a phone holder
switches rooms, he could keep the
same number for an additional $12."
All models are available
The Phone Center offers the full
Pacific Telephone line of phones.
"We've been trying to offer a full line
of services for three years," Garrett
declared, "and this year we've finally
arrived."
Various touch-tone models are
available for an additional monthly
charge. Cummings noted that the
Phone Center also sells design lines, like
old-fashioned or executive telephones.
"Eventually we plan to have
modular connectors in all on-campus
housing," Cummings stated. "We
should have all undergraduate housing
done by next year. The turnover in
Escondido Village is slower, so that
might take longer."
However, Garrett stated that the
new system is on trial until June, at
which point Pacific Telephone could
switch back to the previous method of
company installations.
Vacation rate mix-up
Last spring several students tried to
circumvent high installation costs by
placing their phones on vacation rate
over the summer. Pacific Telephone
disconnected several of these phones,
explaining to the phone holders that
since they did not have legal access to
their rooms during summer vacation,
they could not put their phones on
vacation rate.
Garrett said this was a mistake.
"The representative wasn't aware that
these phones were on vacation rate.
We will have them reinstated."
He said, however, that "in the
future, only those students who are
paying for their rooms, and have keys
to them, will be allowed to use the
vacation rate."
