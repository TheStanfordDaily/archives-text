## The 						new era 
### 
The changes in the Daily's nameplate, headlines and bodytype
which you may have noticed in today's paper are only cosmetic
ones. But they draw attention to what I hope is a real change in the
operation of this newspaper.
This past year has not been a good one for this paper. In the last
12 months, the Daily's reserves have been all but wiped out by an
estimated loss of $35,000. Even with the generous contributions of
the students and University, another year financially managed in
the same way as was 1974-75 would bankrupt us.
Just as seriously, our editorial product has been widely assailed
as dull, misleading and inaccurate, with some justification. The
Daily's reputation as one of the country's best college newspapers
has been all but wiped out.
Thus, we have been making a lot of changes, and we're going to
make some more.
On the business side, we had a badly needed audit so that our
financial reports and projections were no longer candidates for a
class in fantasy. We introduced an austerity program. And we also
began actively seeking new ways to earn advertising and circulation
dollars. The first such effort was last week's new-student
orientation issue.
We're also making a commitment to more and better cartoons
(two on the features page alone), so that you're less likely to fall
asleep while reading the paper. We'll also have more intramural and
women's sports coverage, twice-monthly special issues,
staff-written coverage of national politics and weekly columns
dealing with Stanford's most-talked-about pastime. Guess.
Perhaps most excitingly of all, in 11 days we will introduce a
new tabloid section, Spectrum, which will have as its theme,
"places to see, things to do around the Bay Area." We think
Spectrum will be better than that pink thing.
Thus far, I have not mentioned our most important department
- news. A general reconstruction of our lapsed "beat" system
should produce more complete and accurate coverage, since
reporters will better know what they're writing about. I am
pessimistic, however, that our front page will immediately become
the place for an abundance of beneath-the-surface reports.
We simply do not have nearly enough trained reporters to cover
this campus as well as could be done. Thus, one of our key goals is
the recruitment and training of those with the potential to become
excellent journalists.
If you're interested, come join us. If not, you can still
contribute to our effort by suggesting stories and offering
constructive criticism. If you think thai an article is misleading, or
that the paper is dull, call or come in, say so, and make some
suggestions.
I'll be around nearly every weekday afternoon. Or, if you like,
we'll have some Dailyperson come over and talk with any living
group or organization.
Our job is to inform and entertain you. This year, with your
help, we can do a much better job of it.
