# Gay lib books isolated by library here
## 
### 
While in the main library
stacks I came across Don Teal's
book, The Gay Militants, and I
was somewhat surprised to find
in the card pocket, a card with
the instruction "Shelve in
sensitive area." The book had
been misshelved, but why, I
wonder, does a book that
chronicles the first two years of
the gay liberation movement
need to be locked away?
Curious, I looked up some
other books under the
classification "Gay liberation
movement" in the card catalog
and found that three books,

including The Sociology of
Homosexual Liberation by Laud
Humphreys were also in locked
stacks. The Humphreys book
was classified as "Gay liberation
movement — U.S. History," so
even historical works are locked
up.
I have read all three, and
none could be considered "sex
books," so this compulsion to
lock up books dealing in any
way with homosexuality
bothered me.
Anti-Gay Policy
This does not appear to be
some generalized discriminatory

policy of limiting access to
books on civil rights movements,
but rather limited to books
dealing with gay power and gay
civil rights.
I have known for some time
that the main library routinely
placed in locked stacks books
dealing with the psychological
aspects of homosexuality, and I
also wish to register my strong
objection to this practice. Last
year when a representative of
the Gay People's Union sought
to change this policy, he was
told, after having been given the
usual bureaucratic runa round
and having to wait several
months for a reply, that there
were two reasons for this policy.
The first was "if they weren't
locked away they would be
stolen or vandalized," and the
second, "many of these books
are duplicated in Meyer library,
and there they are in the open
stacks." It seems to me that the
second justification entirely
invalidates the first, unless
Meyer library regularly finds
that these books are stolen or
vandalized, which was not
claimed.
Weigh The Odds
The prevention of theft is not
by itself adequate reason for
locking up a book unless it can
be shown that the resulting
inconvenience to the library's
users is so slight and the
probable rate of theft so high
that no other solution is
plausible. The latter has not
been shown, but it is the former
that particularly concerns me.
From childhood, we are
taught that to have feeling of
affection for, and indeed sexual
interest in, members of our own
sex is to be sick, crazy, sinful
and immoral. It is no wonder
then that when an individual
first begins to experience
attraction for members of his
own sex, he is confused and

Richard Thomas

frightened and his own
self-image sometimes suffers a
severe devaluation. He too is
taught to hate and fear the
homosexual, and that is not
changed even when it becomes
himself that he hates.
Needless Hassle
Imagine yourself to be that
individual, who is too afraid
even to see a counselor, but who
decides to attempt to find out
more about what he is feeling
and goes to your library. He
discovers he has to write down
the names of the books he wants
and give them to a person he's
never met. He sees this as
revealing a very personal part of
himself about which he is still
quite uncomfortable, and he will
probably give up rather than
leave written evidence of his
homosexuality.
I feel this barrier to
information is inexcusable. It is
just for this reason that the
books in Meyer library on
homosexuality are seldom
checked out but often read
surreptitiously in the library.
During an afternoon, the shelf
may be nearly empty, but by
closing time it has filled up
again.
These books contain the
information that will allow him
to learn more about himself, to
begin the rebuilding of the self
that an oppressive and ignorant
society has so systematically
destroyed. To casually justify
locking up books to prevent
their theft without considering
how it may prevent another
human being from securing a
sense of self-acceptance and
self-worth both angers and
saddens me, and I hope that this
policy will be reconsidered with
a greater degree of seriousness
than it received last year.

months for a reply, that there
were two reasons for this policy.
The first was "if they weren't
locked away they would be
stolen or vandalized," and the
second, "many of these books
are duplicated in Meyer library,
and there they are in the open
stacks." It seems to me that the
second justification entirely
invalidates the first, unless
Meyer library regularly finds
that these books are stolen or
vandalized, which was not
claimed.
Weigh The Odds
The prevention of theft is not
by itself adequate reason for
locking up a book unless it can
be shown that the resulting
inconvenience to the library's
users is so slight and the
probable rate of theft so high
that no other solution is
plausible. The latter has not
been shown, but it is the former
that particularly concerns me.
From childhood, we are
taught that to have feeling of
affection for, and indeed sexual
interest in, members of our own
sex is to be sick, crazy, sinful
and immoral. It is no wonder
then that when an individual
first begins to experience
attraction for members of his
own sex, he is confused and

Richard Thomas

frightened and his own
self-image sometimes suffers a
severe devaluation. He too is
taught to hate and fear the
homosexual, and that is not
changed even when it becomes
himself that he hates.
Needless Hassle
Imagine yourself to be that
individual, who is too afraid
even to see a counselor, but who
decides to attempt to find out
more about what he is feeling
and goes to your library. He
discovers he has to write down
the names of the books he wants
and give them to a person he's
never met. He sees this as
revealing a very personal part of
himself about which he is still
quite uncomfortable, and he will
probably give up rather than
leave written evidence of his
homosexuality.
I feel this barrier to
information is inexcusable. It is
just for this reason that the
books in Meyer library on
homosexuality are seldom
checked out but often read
surreptitiously in the library.
During an afternoon, the shelf
may be nearly empty, but by
closing time it has filled up
again.
These books contain the
information that will allow him
to learn more about himself, to
begin the rebuilding of the self
that an oppressive and ignorant
society has so systematically
destroyed. To casually justify
locking up books to prevent
their theft without considering
how it may prevent another
human being from securing a
sense of self-acceptance and
self-worth both angers and
saddens me, and I hope that this
policy will be reconsidered with
a greater degree of seriousness
than it received last year.

While in the main library
stacks I came across Don Teal's
book, The Gay Militants, and I
was somewhat surprised to find
in the card pocket, a card with
the instruction "Shelve in
sensitive area." The book had
been misshelved, but why, I
wonder, does a book that
chronicles the first two years of
the gay liberation movement
need to be locked away?
Curious, I looked up some
other books under the
classification "Gay liberation
movement" in the card catalog
and found that three books,

including The Sociology of
Homosexual Liberation by Laud
Humphreys were also in locked
stacks. The Humphreys book
was classified as "Gay liberation
movement — U.S. History," so
even historical works are locked
up.
I have read all three, and
none could be considered "sex
books," so this compulsion to
lock up books dealing in any
way with homosexuality
bothered me.
Anti-Gay Policy
This does not appear to be
some generalized discriminatory

policy of limiting access to
books on civil rights movements,
but rather limited to books
dealing with gay power and gay
civil rights.
I have known for some time
that the main library routinely
placed in locked stacks books
dealing with the psychological
aspects of homosexuality, and I
also wish to register my strong
objection to this practice. Last
year when a representative of
the Gay People's Union sought
to change this policy, he was
told, after having been given the
usual bureaucratic runa round
and having to wait several
months for a reply, that there
were two reasons for this policy.
The first was "if they weren't
locked away they would be
stolen or vandalized," and the
