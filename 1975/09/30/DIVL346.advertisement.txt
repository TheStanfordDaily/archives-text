John Sexton's LSAT Preparation Center is supervised in California by Joe Angland, a 1975
honors graduate of the Harvard Law School. Mr. Angland, who currently works for the
California Supreme Court, captured first prize in Harvard's writing competition and was
named the outstanding oral advocate in the moot court competition. Mr. Angland, while a

LSAT course.
