# Walter Cronkite: the same in person as on the tube
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Walter Cronkite shakes hands and
cheerily says "good to see you." And
even though he's just said the same
thing to a dozen well-wishers he just
couldn't pass by, you just can't help
believing he means it.
As the car rolls away from
Memorial Auditorium, where Cronkite
has just spoken, he immediately begins
talking as a (what else?) father. "You
know my son [now a freshman at
Brown] came out and looked at
Stanford last year. I didn't push
Stanford . . . That's a long way from
home, you know, all the way across
the country."
And right there you know that the
fatherly, kindly, trustworthy image
Cronkite projects on a TV screen
epitomizes the man himself. He looks
a bit younger and healthier in the flesh,
and sounds less forceful than on TV,
but basically, he's the same man.
According to polls, Cronkite is the
most trusted man in America. It's
perhaps reassuring to know that he

wishes he weren't.
"I'm not an expert on anything, for
goodness sakes. Most newsmen are
generalists, and I'm the generalist of
them all. I'm appalled to find ad lib
comments that I've made get out and
are printed as if the word has come
down from an oracle.
"It's perfectly ridiculous. The
responsibility is rather frightening. I'll
go to the grave not knowing how to
keep my mouth shut."
After saying that, Cronkite
proceeds to answer every question
bluntly. While he goes off the record
to make specific criticisms of other TV
news programs, he generally minces
few words when talking about the
creeping evils he sees in television and
print journalism today.
He lambastes "pretty-boy
newscasters" and the happy-talk
format of many local stations which is
"show business, not news."
His greatest criticism of TV news is
not, however, directed at any person,
but at the system. "We are

overburdened with responsibility. We
cannot possibly discharge the job that
has been assigned to us. We cannot be
the single source of information for
the majority of the American people.
You can't do that in 24 minutes a
day."
Cronkite would prefer TV news to
run longer. "Ah, yes, it would be a
quantum improvement if we had an
hour. But the local stations don't
think very highly of it so that's why
we don't have it."
But while rather wistfully
criticizing the system, Cronkite
defends TV journalism against its
attackers. He bluntly says that Fred
Friendly's indictment of CBS News,
the book Due To Circumstances
Beyond Our Control, "was written in
some bitterness and haste and was not
completely well thought out."
That book attacked TV news as
unable to completely report what's
going on because of the pressures on
the networks to make money. While
admitting that's partly true, Cronkite

said that if ratings were totally
ignored, no one would watch what
newsmen had to say.
But while making such serious
criticisms, Cronkite saves his only
expletive — one suitable for a
59-year-old man — for a rather minor,
and fatherly, complaint.
"Oh my God!," he says in response
to a question about the illiteracy of
young journalists. "1 just can't
understand how people cannot spell."
Cronkite also offers some fatherly
advice for young journalists, to whom,
in large measure, he entrusts the
world.
"There's no question that the best
foundation is in print. I would like to
see every young journalist get a job
with a small newspaper, to get in
somewhere where you get a chance to
cover beats, understand how news is
gathered.
"A year or two of press service
work is also a good idea, because
you're going to deal with that press
