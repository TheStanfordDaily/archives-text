# Weapon sales won't buy peace
## 
### 
Coming from an
Administration that asked us to
forgive Richard Nixon, prop up
the doomed Thieu regime and
remain sanguine about an eight
percent unemployment rate, the
latest Ford-Kissinger policy on
the Middle East probably
shouldn't surprise anyone.
But the idea that supplying
bellicose nations with weapons
will promote peace is odd logic
even by their standards.
In order to persuade Israel to
approve the Sinai disengagement
agreement, the Administration
promised weeks ago to ask
Congress to give that nation $1.8
billion in arms.
So it was nearly inevitable
that last Friday, after Egypt

requested military equipment,
the Administration announced it
would consider asking Congress
to lavish armaments on Egypt.
The Administration's
apparent policy is — to begin
with — impractical. Considering
the strength of the pro-Israeli
lobby in Washington, it is likely
that Congress will vote to aid
Israel but will deny military help
to Egypt. Indeed, Congress may
reject the proposed $700 million
in economic aid for Egypt.
Israeli wrath
The nation's pro-Arab lobby,
representing most of this
nation's surprisingly large (two
million member) Arab
community, has emerged in
force since the Yom Kippur War.
But it still seems highly unlikely
that many congressmen will risk
incurring the wrath of Israel's
numerous diehard supporters by
voting to give arrjju, to Egypt.
Weapon sales such as those
advocated by the Administration
can only encourage further
military escalation and prepare
the Arabs and the Israelis for
another war.
Fear of missiles
Finally, the results of the
Administration's attempts to
buy peace by selling arms
already are becoming apparent.
Egyptian officials on Friday
criticized Kissinger for not
telling them during negotiations
that he had promised Israel
Pershing missiles.
The Egyptians are
understandably apprehensive
about the missiles, since their
firing range of 450 miles puts
them within firing distance of
Cairo and the Aswan Dam.
If the Administration wants
to weaken Soviet influence in
the Arab nations, its current
policies are an odd way of
achieving this goal.
But the current promises of
arms sales — together with the
placement of American
technicians in the Sinai area —
will serve to delay any future

war at least for another couple
of years.
Without congressional
approval, the Administration can
sell only $25 million in arms to
Egypt — a paltry amount
compared to the sum Congress is
likely to give Israel. Even it'
Congress were to vote to aid
Egypt, it is doubtful if the
amount would even approach
that given Israel.
Peace disregarded
The Administration showed a
callous disregard for achieving a
lasting peace settlement by
basing the Middle East peace
settlement on a political
unlikelihood such as
congressional aid to Israel and
Egypt.
But even if Congress were to
approve arms sales to Egypt and
Israel, the Administration's
policy hardly would encourage a
permanent peace settlement.
Israel and Egypt's requests
for arms seems to be a tacit
acknowledgement that they
intend to fight another war.
The argument that they need
the weapons to protect
themselves from aggression by
their foes is invalid. Since both
sides enjoy considerable military
strengths and suffer from certain
military disadvantages, an
approximate balance of power
already exists.
But selling arms to the Middle
East will probably delay the
next conflict until after the
1976 U.S. election. And this is
perhaps the Administration's
only concern. Following the
dismal example of Lyndon

Johnson in 1964 and 1968 and
Nixon in 1972 on Vietnam
policy, the Ford Administration
seems willing to create an
illusion of peace in order to win
votes.
The probable lack of
American military involvement
in the Middle East next year under
any situation would seem to
make such a deception
unnecessary. But the
Administration seems so
concerned with showing the
voters that it can bring peace to
the Middle East that it is willing
to lay the groundwork for
another war.

Egypt — a paltry amount
compared to the sum Congress is
likely to give Israel. Even it'
Congress were to vote to aid
Egypt, it is doubtful if the
amount would even approach
that given Israel.
Peace disregarded
The Administration showed a
callous disregard for achieving a
lasting peace settlement by
basing the Middle East peace
settlement on a political
unlikelihood such as
congressional aid to Israel and
Egypt.
But even if Congress were to
approve arms sales to Egypt and
Israel, the Administration's
policy hardly would encourage a
permanent peace settlement.
Israel and Egypt's requests
for arms seems to be a tacit
acknowledgement that they
intend to fight another war.
The argument that they need
the weapons to protect
themselves from aggression by
their foes is invalid. Since both
sides enjoy considerable military
strengths and suffer from certain
military disadvantages, an
approximate balance of power
already exists.
But selling arms to the Middle
East will probably delay the
next conflict until after the
1976 U.S. election. And this is
perhaps the Administration's
only concern. Following the
dismal example of Lyndon

Johnson in 1964 and 1968 and
Nixon in 1972 on Vietnam
policy, the Ford Administration
seems willing to create an
illusion of peace in order to win

Coming from an
Administration that asked us to
forgive Richard Nixon, prop up
the doomed Thieu regime and
remain sanguine about an eight
percent unemployment rate, the
latest Ford-Kissinger policy on
the Middle East probably
shouldn't surprise anyone.
But the idea that supplying
bellicose nations with weapons
will promote peace is odd logic
even by their standards.
In order to persuade Israel to
approve the Sinai disengagement
agreement, the Administration
promised weeks ago to ask
Congress to give that nation $1.8
billion in arms.
So it was nearly inevitable
that last Friday, after Egypt

requested military equipment,
the Administration announced it
would consider asking Congress
to lavish armaments on Egypt.
The Administration's
apparent policy is — to begin
with — impractical. Considering
the strength of the pro-Israeli
lobby in Washington, it is likely
that Congress will vote to aid
Israel but will deny military help
to Egypt. Indeed, Congress may
reject the proposed $700 million
in economic aid for Egypt.
Israeli wrath
The nation's pro-Arab lobby,
representing most of this
nation's surprisingly large (two
million member) Arab
community, has emerged in
force since the Yom Kippur War.
But it still seems highly unlikely
that many congressmen will risk
incurring the wrath of Israel's
numerous diehard supporters by
voting to give arrjju, to Egypt.
Weapon sales such as those
advocated by the Administration
can only encourage further
military escalation and prepare
the Arabs and the Israelis for
another war.
Fear of missiles
Finally, the results of the
Administration's attempts to
buy peace by selling arms
already are becoming apparent.
Egyptian officials on Friday
criticized Kissinger for not
telling them during negotiations
that he had promised Israel
Pershing missiles.
The Egyptians are
understandably apprehensive
about the missiles, since their
firing range of 450 miles puts
them within firing distance of
Cairo and the Aswan Dam.
If the Administration wants
to weaken Soviet influence in
the Arab nations, its current
policies are an odd way of
achieving this goal.
But the current promises of
arms sales — together with the
placement of American
technicians in the Sinai area —
will serve to delay any future

war at least for another couple
of years.
Without congressional
approval, the Administration can
sell only $25 million in arms to
Egypt — a paltry amount
compared to the sum Congress is
likely to give Israel. Even it'
Congress were to vote to aid
