The Aug. 15 Daily published
an article regarding Santa Clara
County bus service to and into
the Stanford campus. A Santa
Clara County Transit official is
quoted as saying: "neither the
ASSU nor University
administrators contacted the
transit district," and "that no
one from Stanford asked to have
service extended to the
University. . .
Those statements are not
validated by fact.
After several verbal requests
(without responses), to lower
echelon Transit employees in
late December, I wrote to
Howard Campen, executive
officer of the Transit District, on
Jan. 20.
I recommended five
improvements in bus service
which would better serve the
Stanford community. Those
suggestions would have provided
significantly improved service
for employes, increased bus
usage to and into the campus,
and cost little additional money.
In fact, the increased
passenger load would have more
than covered any increase in
costs. I finally received a reply
to my letter three months later
from Robert Scott, deputy
director for transit operations,
stating he was "sympathetic
with your interest and concern,"
but added that there would be
no improvements contemplated.
For transit officials to state
or imply that Stanford people
have not been interested, nor
communicated that interest, is
to play the typical bureaucratic
game of "laying low" in hopes
that problems will just go away.
Santa Clara Transit could
provide efficient, economical,
fuel-saving transportation to
thousands of residents in this
area, if only the officials would
have open public hearings, listen
to their patrons and act on
reasonable suggestions.
We don't want their
sympathy — we need their
action.
