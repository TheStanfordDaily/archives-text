## Norton's political chemistry Conserve, but develop too 
### KATHY BATTS 
Palo Alto Mayor Stanley Norton says he is a cross
between pro-development and conservation, a mixture
some area political pundits might find unique.
"I find there is a correlation between the pro-developers
and the conservationists," Norton says."I like to think
that I make a distinction between the foothills and the
flatlands."
Norton explains his approach to planning as that of
green belts surrounding developed urban areas. He speaks
of his "pure delusion in my ideas for the foothills," yet he
claims he is not gung-ho about developing the flatlands.
Norton's "pure delusion" with the foothills involved
him and the council in a zoning controversy over the
foothills and open space.
"Everyone assumes that the foothills will be
developed," Norton says."The question is how."
In 1969 the city retained the San Francisco planning
firm of Livingston and Blaney to prepare a report on the
planning of the foothills. The report came back showing it
would be less costly to the city to buy the foothills and
declare the area open space, than to provide city
services to the privately developed hills.

"When we put it to the voters in dollars and cents,
everyone agreed to the move," he says. "Both the
conservationists and the developers want lower taxes."
But not everyone agreed. Several major lawsuits
involving developers resulted from that zoning ordinance.
Palo Alto has won two of them in trial court.

"I look at each development on its own merits," he
says. "If a project is badly designed, bulky or may cause
heavy traffic problems, I won't approve it."
Norton began his one-year term July 7, succeeding
previous mayor and Stanford Law Prof. Byron Sher. A
former planning commissioner, he was elected in 1969,
and reelected in 1973. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor in
1971.
Although Norton did not run in the 1975 council race,
it was hotly contested between the "residentialist" and

"pro-development" factions. Observers have placed the
new council at a 7-2 advantage for development.
Norton, however, says he doesn't think there is a great
deal of difference between this council and the old 5-4
"residentialist" council.
"Labels are very misleading," he says. "It's not really
clear who are the residentialists and who are their antithesis.
I think the council will divide as each issue comes up, not
along preconceived partisan lines."
Norton puts the Stanford-Palo Alto "town-gown"
relationship on two levels. The University staff and city
staff are involved in an on-going liaison committee, which
he says, handles the formal problems between the two
entities.
He also sees a less formal, student-faculty relationship
with the city. Stanford students intern in various city
departments, although, Norton admits, this has never really
been formalized.
"Perhaps the best example of this level is Byron Sher,"
he says. "Here you've got a city councilman who is also a
member of the Stanford community. It gives the council a
