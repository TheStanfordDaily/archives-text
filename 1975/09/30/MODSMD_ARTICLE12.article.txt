## Norton's political chemistry Conserve, but develop too 
### KATHY BATTS 
Palo Alto Mayor Stanley Norton says he is a cross
between pro-development and conservation, a mixture
some area political pundits might find unique.
"I find there is a correlation between the pro-developers
and the conservationists," Norton says."I like to think
that I make a distinction between the foothills and the
flatlands."
Norton explains his approach to planning as that of
green belts surrounding developed urban areas. He speaks
of his "pure delusion in my ideas for the foothills," yet he
claims he is not gung-ho about developing the flatlands.
Norton's "pure delusion" with the foothills involved
him and the council in a zoning controversy over the
foothills and open space.
"Everyone assumes that the foothills will be
developed," Norton says."The question is how."
In 1969 the city retained the San Francisco planning
firm of Livingston and Blaney to prepare a report on the
planning of the foothills. The report came back showing it
would be less costly to the city to buy the foothills and
declare the area open space, than to provide city
services to the privately developed hills.

"When we put it to the voters in dollars and cents,
everyone agreed to the move," he says. "Both the
conservationists and the developers want lower taxes."
But not everyone agreed. Several major lawsuits
involving developers resulted from that zoning ordinance.
Palo Alto has won two of them in trial court.

"I look at each development on its own merits," he
says. "If a project is badly designed, bulky or may cause
heavy traffic problems, I won't approve it."
Norton began his one-year term July 7, succeeding
previous mayor and Stanford Law Prof. Byron Sher. A
former planning commissioner, he was elected in 1969,
and reelected in 1973. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor in
1971.
Although Norton did not run in the 1975 council race,
it was hotly contested between the "residentialist" and

"pro-development" factions. Observers have placed the
new council at a 7-2 advantage for development.
Norton, however, says he doesn't think there is a great
deal of difference between this council and the old 5-4
"residentialist" council.
"Labels are very misleading," he says. "It's not really
clear who are the residentialists and who are their antithesis.
I think the council will divide as each issue comes up, not
along preconceived partisan lines."
Norton puts the Stanford-Palo Alto "town-gown"
relationship on two levels. The University staff and city
staff are involved in an on-going liaison committee, which
he says, handles the formal problems between the two
entities.
He also sees a less formal, student-faculty relationship
with the city. Stanford students intern in various city
departments, although, Norton admits, this has never really
been formalized.
"Perhaps the best example of this level is Byron Sher,"
he says. "Here you've got a city councilman who is also a
member of the Stanford community. It gives the council a

different outlook at times."
Norton says that ties between
Stanford and Palo Alto were
much greater in the past.
"There's not much dialogue
on a continuing basis," he notes,
"Only when there's a problem to
be solved."
The mayor says there is no
real power struggle going on
between Palo Alto and the
University.
"The city has the power, not

Stanford," he adds. "Oh I don't
think the city uses that power
arbitrarily. We have a working
relationship with the University

— we listen and try to
accomodate its legitimate
concerns."
Norton admits that the city
has no power over the academic
campus. There was "a slight
effort a few years back to annex
the campus" he adds. The
council wanted to have more
control over land use and
development of the academic
campus with regard to traffic
control.
Norton, who graduated from
Stanford Law School after
attending here as an
undergraduate, didn't favor the
annexation proposal.
"I'd been at the campus for
seven years and had an idea of
how things worked here," he
says. "Most councilmen don't. I
know it is important to Stanford
to be independent. There's a
sense of pride in that
independence."
The compromise that was
reached left Palo Alto with the
option to annex three sections

of the campus (near the stadium,
the hospital and the hill behind
Junipero Serra Blvd.) should any
development be proposed there.

'It's very much
an honorary title'

"In those places, substantial
development might have an
effect on Palo Alto," he
explains. "But the city has no
business deciding if the
University should have a new
law school or a new library."
But Norton feels that Palo
Alto should have a say in the
development of Stanford lands
within the Palo Alto city limits.
"I think the new council
surprised a few people by giving
the shopping center plans a cool
reception. We're going to look at
it very critically before it goes
through."
A former editor of Chaixirral,
Norton still retains ties with the
campus. A member of the
Hammer and Coffin Society,
Norton last year fought against
the ASSU Publications Board's
denial of funds to the 1974-75
Chaparral.
As mayor, Norton sees few
changes during his term.
"Actually, there are only a
handful of cities with elected
mayors who have power," he
laughs. "The transition has been

a smooth one and that's what I
was after.
"It's very much an honorary
title," he says."I can make
appointments, call special
meetings and make rulings on
matters of procedure.
Although talkative
councilmen may find their
verbosity cut off when assuming
the moderating duties of mayor,
Norton says he should have no
problem with procedural
distractions.
"I've never been one who
talks a lot at council meetings. It
won't be much of a change for
me.
"I will still participate in
the council meetings," he adds.
"A lot depends on if you've
done your homework or not
before the meetings, rather than
how much you talk during the
meetings."

Norton says there will be few
reversals this next year.
"I have no big plans. There
are a lot of creative people on
the council. We can come up
with plenty of ideas, but I have
no plans to embark on an
entirely new course."
