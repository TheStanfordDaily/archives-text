Well, this time Stanford lias really gone too far. I
returned from my summer vacation with high
hopes for this place. After all, the new law school
is finally finished, the chemistry building has
undergone a dramatic metamorphosis from a
dream to a hole in the ground and the Beta house
miraculously has some vestiges of landscaping.
Noting the changes, I drove happily up Campus
Drive, and prepared to park in the UGLY lot.
You can imagine my surprise and undiluted
disgust when I saw the new parking machine!
Fifty cents to park in the UGLY parking lot?
Fifty cents for the privilege of not getting raped
on your way to the library? Fifty cents to ruin
your axle driving through an area which most
closely resembles the surface of the moon? Well,
anyway, here's my question. Is this infernal
machine going to be running 24 hours or just
during the day? Frankly, I shall be tempted to
drive straight through if that fragile wooden bar is
still down at 3 a.m. —G.L.G.
Luckily, you will not have to fight temptation
every time you come face to face (or car to bar)
with that frail barrier. The parking machine will
be in operation from only 8 to 5 on weekdays.
On weekends and after-hours, you can park in the
UGLY parking lot scot-free. What a steal!

Last year the Daily published an article about a
class for people who knew nothing of car
mechanics, but wished to learn. I can't find any
mention of this course in 'Courses and Degrees.'
Is the course still being offered, and if so by
whom and when? —S.T.T.
Unfortunately your question didn't mention
your sex, which makes a big difference here.
Women who want to improve their mechanical
skills have a course all cut out for them. It's
offered through the YWCA, and is called "Ms.
Mechanics." The class starts Tuesday, Oct. 7, and
runs for eight sessions. The cost is $10.
The YWCA rather sexistly assumes that all
men are mechanical experts, since the
organization wants no males "dominating the
class." About the only class we could find for
men (and women) is an "intensive seminar" in car
tune-ups at the Briarpatch Auto Coop. The course
requires no prior experience with cars and costs
$17 for eight three-hour sessions. The previous
course ends Oct. 8 — and a new one will start if
there's demand. Call or stop by the Briarpatch.

How did the tradition of putting pimiento in
green olives get started? — L.H.
The search for the answer to this not terribly
pressing question was not an easy one. It started
with a visit to the Main Library reference room
where we checked all sources on olives and
pimientos — both traditional encyclopedias and
cooking encyclopedias. No luck. After that, our
staff called the Stanford Food Research Institute,
where a researcher suggested that we contact Dr.
Reese Vaughn at the University of California at
Davis. Vaughn, although a specialist on olives, had
no answer. He recommended that we write to Dr.
A. Garrido Fernandez at the Institute de La Grasa
y Sus Derivados (Institute of Oil and Its
Derivatives ) in Seville, Spain. And so we did —
last May.
And the answer has just arrived! Dr. A Garrido
Fernandez confessed that he is merely a specialist
on black olives, and therefore had to pass the
question on to Dr. Rodriguez de la Borbolla, the
head of a research group that works on the
"commercial, industrial, historical and public
relations aspect" of green olives.
Unfortunately, no one knows how or when the
tradition got started according to Dr. Rodriguez
de la Borbolla. However, he is sure that pimiento
olive-stuffing began in Seville more than 100
years ago, since the first references to the
tradition are around that time.
Sorry that we couldn't get a more complete
response, but you can't say we didn't try. Once
again, "Bug Me" ferrets out the answers for its
devoted readers — this time 6000 miles and a
major ocean away.
