# Many jobs remain unfilled despite employment crisis
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Through
out the recession, with its ac
companying high unemploy
ment rate, there have been recur
ring reports from employers of
job openings they have been un
able to fill.
A survey by the National Fed
eration of Independent Busi
ness, for example, showed
thousands of small- and
medium-size businesses seeking
vainly for workers at the very
peak of unemployment.
Various reasons are provided
to explain the situation: They
prefer to collect benefits, they
decline to take certain jobs be
cause they expect to be recalled
by their previous employer, the
jobs are inconvenient geog
raphically.
Some frustrated employers
suggest another reason: Workers
today, they say. don't want just
any job to help them through
hard times; they want the ideal
job or they won't work at all.
Whatever the reason, the
phenomenon continues. The
Bureau of National Affairs, a pri
vate research and publishing
concern, found in a survey just
published that shortages of

workers continued to be re
ported.
The bureau surveyed the emp
loyment situation of a selected
list of 200 companies, and found
that:
"Office positions, particularly
secretaries and stenographers,
are difficult to fill in eight per
cent of the companies, and shor
tages of technical and profes
sional persons are noted by 28
percent.
"In the latter category, the ma
jority of jobs mentioned are in
engineering, with a few com
panies listing electronic data
processing programmers or
analysts."
Respondents from the health
care industry reported scarcities
at all technical and professional
levels, the bureau said.
Some geographical differ
ences were reported. Production
jobs seemed to be more difficult
to fill in the north-central states,
office jobs in the West, and tech
nical and professional jobs in the
South.
Observers on tin; labor scene
believe that the level of help
wanted advertising in the

nation's newspapers provides .1
good indication of strength or
weakness in job markets in tin
immediate future.
Earlier this year, for example,
an index of job advertising main
tained by the Conference Board,
showed steady increases,
foretelling the drop in unemp
loyment from a high of 9.2 per
cent to August's H. 4.
But, just as the job markets
were improving in August so
was the help-wanted index tai
ling, for the first time in live
months. The volume of ads It'll
in eight of nine regions meas
ured. The increase, a small one.
was in the east-north-central reg
ion.
What does it mean? In the
opinion of Kenneth Goldstein,
associate economist for (lit 1
board, a private organization
that attempts to keep a non
partisan view, it means that
further improvement in the emp
loyment situation, "if any. may
be modest in the next few
months."
The index, which is based in
1967 figures equaling 100, stood
at H2 in August, 32 points below
its level of just one year ago.
