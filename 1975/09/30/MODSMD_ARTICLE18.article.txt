# Groucho celebrates 85th
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-"Did
you know that I'll be 85 years
old on Oct. 2? Isn't that
amazing?"
Of course, Groucho. And it's
cause for celebration that
Groucho Marx is alive and fairly
well and living in accustomed
luxury in the Trousdale Estates.
The birthday will be observed
Oct. 12 with a star-filled
luncheon in his honor by the
Friends of the Library at the
University of Southern
California.
"I've written six books, and I
never finished public school," he
comments wonderingly.
Curiously, his immense
contributions to American
humor have never been rewarded
with an honorary degree from
any university. Bob Hope has
31.
A visit to Groucho is always a
delight, and he was in good form
at a prebirthday lunch at his
home.
It some ways he exhibits his
ample years. No more the loping
walk. His steps are deliberate, his

frame stooped. The words don't
come with the same rattling
speed — nor as scathingly.
But he is still Groucho.
"I no longer smoke, drink or
make love," he remarked,
expletive deleted. "I gave up
cigars five years ago, figuring
that I was too old to smoke.
"No drinking hasn't bothered
me; I was only a one-drink man
anyway. As far as making love,
age took care of that."
He sat down to a hearty
lunch accompanied by applo
cider. "I read in the New York
Times that it was good for old
people."
As he sliced the chicken
breast, he mused, "My mother
was a lousy cook. My father was
a great cook. But he was a lousy
tailor."
Groucho had a coughing
spell, and the ever-present Erin
Fleming asked if he had taken
his cough medicine. Twice, he
replied.
Fleming, an attractive
brunette with a sharp mind, has
been guardian of the Marx

legend for several years. She
watches his health, makes deals
for books, merchandise
licensing, TV reruns, etc.,
collecting a 15 percent fee as
manager.
Her only complaint is that
she would like to get married,
and Groucho keeps scaring off
her potential suitors.
"My quiz show went on
Channel 5 here as a 13-week
experiment, and now it's the
most popular program on an
independent station," Groucho
remarked proudly.
Indeed, rerelease of the
1951-1961 You Bet Your Life
series has caused a new wave of
Grouchomania.
Even though the films are in
black-and-white, the Marxian
dialogue retains its color, and
You Bet Your Life is now
appearing on 44 channels,
including the top 18 markets.
Groucho himself has been
watching the reruns every night
and the afternoon showings as
well.
He goes to sleep when the
shows are over at 11:30 and rises
promptly at 6. After bathing and
shaving, he returns to bed for
breakfast and reading the news;
he still follows politics avidly
and admires California's young
Gov. Edmund Brown — "I think
he'll be president some day."
Groucho spends a busy
morning with mail and other
matters, takes a walk before
lunch.
Nowadays he rarely joins the
fabled comedians' roundtable at
Hillcrest Country Club, the

ranks of comedians having
grown thinner. He lunches at
home at 1 p.m. sharp, watches
reruns of his show and Jack
Benny's: "A fine man, and a
great comedian."
After a late-day rest, Groucho
dines with friends or goes to a
movie. He enjoys the films of
Mel Brooks and Woody Allen,
both of whom he considers
"brilliant."
Refusing to live in the past,
Groucho spends time with such
admirers as Bill Cosby and
Marvin Hamlisch. But there is no
mistaking the photo gallery and
Groucho points to photos of A 1
Jolson, Jack Benny, Edward G.
Robinson, Harry Ruby and
especially his late brother Harpo,
"a wonderful man."
Groucho talked of meeting
another old friend, Charlie
Chaplin, when Chaplin was here
for his honorary Oscar last year.
"You know the advice he gave
me? He said, 'Keep Cool,' " said
Groucho. "No, he said, 'Keep
warm,' " Erin corrected.
"So what's the difference?"
