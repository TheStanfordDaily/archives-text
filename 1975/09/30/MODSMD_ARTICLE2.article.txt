# Goheen critiques Honor Code
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
The Honor Code must undergo a
"total reassessment," according to
University Ombudsman John D.
Goheen.
Citing an emphasis on grades and
the intense competition for admission
into graduate schools as some of the
reasons for student dishonesty,
Goheen said "there is sufficient
evidence of a need for careful inquiry"
into the Code.
"An honor code functions as long
as people want to be honest with
themselves; this is [another] reason
why the Honor Code doesn't work,"
said Goheen.
The "point of departure" for an
investigation, he said, is that "students
find a B grade disastrous." He also
places blame on professional schools,
which "put a premium on A's.
"The emphasis on grades diverts the
purpose of education away from its
true ends. A few years ago no one
worried so much about a B."
The economic situation is also
partially responsible for the
breakdown of the honor system, as
"more people want to go to graduate
school, more people are looking for
jobs" and need to find professions that
will support a livelihood.
Goheen also finds fault with the
present grading situation. "The letter
grade often doesn't reflect the
capacity of an individual in a given
course — they may have qualities of a
different category."
He added that course evaluations
need to be of a more personal nature
— "a personal appraisal." He
recognizes the problem it would create
of putting more time pressure on
already-burdened faculty, but said that
"it might have a profound effect on
the Honor Code, or on simple
standards of honesty."
Goheen said he doesn't believe that
the atmosphere of classes and exams
create a climate of cheating rather,
the pressures are "external." He a!su
said that the present system of not
allowing professors to proctor exams
should be retained, because "if
students want to cheat, they'll find a
way."
The suggestion of a reassessment of
the Honor Code has met with varied
reactions, he explained. There is
currently under consideration the
appointment of a committee to
investigate the Code.
As ombudsman, Goheen often
receives complaints of Code violations,
but he said that serious complaints or
accusations go to the president's
office.
Goheen is not altogether opposed
to eliminating grades. Fie relates one
incident in which a senior graduated
last year without a single letter grade
on her record. She took all her courses
pass/N.C. — and was accepted at the
medical school of her choice.
"That's the direction I'd like to see
things head," said Goheen.

"The emphasis on grades diverts the
purpose of education away from its
true ends. A few years ago no one
worried so much about a B."
The economic situation is also
partially responsible for the
breakdown of the honor system, as
"more people want to go to graduate
school, more people are looking for
jobs" and need to find professions that
will support a livelihood.
Goheen also finds fault with the
present grading situation. "The letter
grade often doesn't reflect the
capacity of an individual in a given
course — they may have qualities of a
different category."
He added that course evaluations
need to be of a more personal nature
— "a personal appraisal." He
recognizes the problem it would create
of putting more time pressure on
already-burdened faculty, but said that
"it might have a profound effect on
the Honor Code, or on simple
standards of honesty."
Goheen said he doesn't believe that
the atmosphere of classes and exams
create a climate of cheating rather,
the pressures are "external." He a!su
said that the present system of not
allowing professors to proctor exams
should be retained, because "if
students want to cheat, they'll find a
way."
The suggestion of a reassessment of
the Honor Code has met with varied
reactions, he explained. There is
currently under consideration the
appointment of a committee to
investigate the Code.
As ombudsman, Goheen often
receives complaints of Code violations,
but he said that serious complaints or
accusations go to the president's
office.
Goheen is not altogether opposed
to eliminating grades. Fie relates one
incident in which a senior graduated
last year without a single letter grade
on her record. She took all her courses
pass/N.C. — and was accepted at the
medical school of her choice.
"That's the direction I'd like to see
things head," said Goheen.
The Honor Code must undergo a
"total reassessment," according to
University Ombudsman John D.
Goheen.
Citing an emphasis on grades and
the intense competition for admission
into graduate schools as some of the
reasons for student dishonesty,
Goheen said "there is sufficient
evidence of a need for careful inquiry"
into the Code.
"An honor code functions as long
as people want to be honest with
themselves; this is [another] reason
why the Honor Code doesn't work,"
said Goheen.
The "point of departure" for an
investigation, he said, is that "students
find a B grade disastrous." He also
places blame on professional schools,
which "put a premium on A's.

purpose of education away from its
