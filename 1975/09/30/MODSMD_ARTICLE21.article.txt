# How to survive life off campus or how to win the rat-race game
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Two or three years of
relatively secure and inexpensive
living in the elite sophistication
of beautiful Stern Hall can leave
a student woefully unprepared
for drawing 4995 in the housing

draw, and a subsequent
ignominious banishment to the
off-campus Siberia,
affectionately known as Una Sig
House.
Even freshmen and
sophomores, who plan far in
advance to live off campus,could
use guidance when the time
finally comes. To many
students, the ever present threat
of life off campus, dealing with a
management even less responsive
than Stanford's, remains a terror
around a dark corner.
But even without using the
obvious cliche, we can laud
SCIRE's latest published effort,
A Guide to Off-Campus Living,
subtitled How To Win The
Off-Campus Living Game.
The pamphlet basically
compiles a list of all the things
which the student house- or
apartment-hunter, in his or her
fear, frenzy or fury, could
overlook; a few more obvious
tips are thrown in to boot.
A housing guide, indicating
general areas where students
might search, will never replace
— in fact, doesn't really augment
— the Clearinghouse (also known
as the Horton Hilton), but the
Guide does provide useful legal
information for tenants. (Do
you know what recourse you
have when the landlord takes 13
days to tell you he doesn't have

time to fix your broken toilet?
The booklet does.)
The Guide gives advice on
how to get started — what a
well-stocked kitchen needs, for
example — useful information to
the neophyte. But even
journeyman apartment dwellers
can use the tips on furniture
construction. After all, when
$145 won't get more than an
unfurnished studio, the resident
has to add something.
Una Sig residents from all
over the area can find shopping
centers near their homes in the
Guide, as long as they do not
assume the map so helpfully
provided is drawn to scale. Food
tips (when does the Palo Alto
Times run food special ads? The
booklet tells.) abound as well.
The pamphlet is by no means
perfect — it could go into more
detail on almost everything —
but is an excellent effort on a
limited budget, in fact, about
the only drawback is price; it
sells for fifty cents. For students
unwillingly forced off campus
(and who, this year, were in
many cases accidentally billed
$200 rent anyway), this may
seem a slap in the face.
Yet with the expense of living
off campus now, and with the
time and money to be saved by
using the guide, it's probably
worth every penny.

detail on almost everything —
but is an excellent effort on a
limited budget, in fact, about
the only drawback is price; it
sells for fifty cents. For students
unwillingly forced off campus
(and who, this year, were in
many cases accidentally billed
$200 rent anyway), this may
seem a slap in the face.

Two or three years of
relatively secure and inexpensive
living in the elite sophistication
of beautiful Stern Hall can leave
a student woefully unprepared
for drawing 4995 in the housing

draw, and a subsequent
ignominious banishment to the
off-campus Siberia,
affectionately known as Una Sig
House.
Even freshmen and
sophomores, who plan far in
advance to live off campus,could
use guidance when the time
finally comes. To many
students, the ever present threat
of life off campus, dealing with a
management even less responsive
than Stanford's, remains a terror
around a dark corner.
But even without using the
obvious cliche, we can laud
SCIRE's latest published effort,
A Guide to Off-Campus Living,
subtitled How To Win The
Off-Campus Living Game.
The pamphlet basically
compiles a list of all the things
which the student house- or
apartment-hunter, in his or her
fear, frenzy or fury, could
overlook; a few more obvious
tips are thrown in to boot.
A housing guide, indicating
general areas where students
might search, will never replace
— in fact, doesn't really augment
— the Clearinghouse (also known
as the Horton Hilton), but the
Guide does provide useful legal
information for tenants. (Do
you know what recourse you
have when the landlord takes 13
days to tell you he doesn't have

time to fix your broken toilet?
The booklet does.)
The Guide gives advice on
how to get started — what a
well-stocked kitchen needs, for
example — useful information to
the neophyte. But even
journeyman apartment dwellers
can use the tips on furniture
construction. After all, when
$145 won't get more than an
unfurnished studio, the resident
has to add something.
Una Sig residents from all
over the area can find shopping
centers near their homes in the
Guide, as long as they do not
assume the map so helpfully
provided is drawn to scale. Food
tips (when does the Palo Alto
Times run food special ads? The
booklet tells.) abound as well.
