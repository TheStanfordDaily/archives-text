## Cunningham reads in 'Stanford' style 
### DANA GIOIA 
J.V. Cunningham Reading at Stanford (The
Stanford Program for Recordings in Sound,
$6.00)
J.V. Cunningham is probably the most
famous living poet that Stanford has produced.
He was a student of Ivor Winters, the mentor
of so many Stanford poets, and his clear,
traditional poems expressing a distinctly
modern sensibility speak in what many critics
would identify as the "Stanford" style.
Cunningham, like Winters, feels that good
poetry concentrates on those levels of
experience which can be shared. Poems should
have both an intellectual and emotional
integrity. The poet should operate within the
bounds of language and tradition to create an
enduring statement about human experience.
The new album from the Stanford Program
for Recordings in Sound gives readers a rare
chance to hear Cunningham read his own
poems T ~<? album is very attractively
with a striking jacket designed by
Sally Stillman. The liner notes are not the
second-rate tribute one usually finds on the
back of such records. Instead, there is a
thoughtfully-written miniature essay by
Prof. Ken Fields of the English
Department. And, most importantly, the
recorded sound is crisp and flawless.
Anyone who really loves poetry loves to
hear it read aloud. There is a level of meaning
in every good poem that only an oral rendition
can reveal. Many intelligent people will fall
asleep while trying to read Milton, but I have
never met anyone who has listened to a
successful dramatic reading of Paradise Lost
without great enthusiasm.
Contemporary literary study is so
completely tyrannised by the written word that

most readers have almost forgotten literature's
nearly absolute dependence on the spoken
language. Our century is certainly the first to
have done so. In Victorian England Dickens'
novels were read aloud to groups of listeners,
and the illiterate working class crowds that
attended public readings for a penny never saw
the pages.
It is singularly ironic that in an age so
dependent on spoken communication — via
radio, phonograph, television and telephone —
that the literary arts would have shrunk away
from the aural dimensions of their own
medium. Books — even books of poetry — are
read silently, usually when people are alone.
Both the social and aural qualities of the
literary experience have almost vanished. The
basic act behind all literature — one person
speaking to another — has become so tenuous
that it is almost non-existent.
At Stanford literature is regaining a little
lost ground with an impressive series of
recordings of contemporary authors reading
their own work. The Cunningham recording
might well be the finest of this series. In this
reading the poet gives a wonderful
cross-section of his work. He reads nearly all of
his major poems. He covers every aspect of his
career (except as a translator) with generous
selections.
Cunningham is a poet of limited range, but
within this area he works with nearly perfect
results. Very few modern poets can surpass
Cunningham's love poems, which capture both
intellectual and emotional dimensions of the
experience. His famous poem, "To My Wife,"
is a wonderfully simple and direct statement of
love reaching maturity. The poem's end
provides a powerful sample of Cunningham's
style:

So love by love we come at last,
As through the exclusions of a rhyme.
Or the exactions of a past
To the simplicity of time.
The antiquity of grace, where yet
IVe live in terror and delight
With love as quiet as regret
And love lil;e anger in the night.
But Cunningham has his crustier moments
as this recording makes abundantly clear. The
second side of the album begins with a series
of epigrams that the author titles "a little
trash." These brilliant and devasting miniatures
are mostly too obscene to quote here, but one
of the cleaner (albeit mysogynistic) ones
should give an idea of Cunningham's
considerable skill as a comic poet:
I married in my youth a wife.
She was my own, my very first.
She gave the best years of her life.
I hope nobody gets the worst.
As long as poets have written, the epigram
has been one of the true tests of poetic skill
and imagination. Even Plato, who as every
schoolboy knows would have banished poets
from his republic, wrote epigrams in his day.
Cunningham is certainly the most
accomplished and versatile epigrammatist
writing today. His choice of clarity and
conciseness in his poetic style obviously
contributes to his success in this delightful
genre.
The album concludes with Cunningham's
greatest work, a sequence of love poems
entitled "To What Strangers, What Welcome."
This sequence, which tells the story of a
journey across the country after the break-up
of a marriage, is certainly one of the most

moving and accessible major efforts by an
American poet for many years. And
Cunningham's deliberate reading of this work
brings out its full emotional potential.
Cunningham reads his poetry in an
impressively formal manner. His slow, dry
voice carefully pronounces each individual
word and phrase with the same craftsmanlike
attention with which he writes. Every word
makes a full impact even at the first hearing.
Cunningham's style of delivery is absolutely
consistent with his style of writing.
Cunningham has two distinctive voices. One
is the cynical voice of his comic epigrams. The
other is the quiet voice of his serious poems.
This side of Cunningham speaks about loss —
usually the loss of love and youth. His serious
poems capture the quiet pain of growing old
and losing youth's illusions for the wisdom of
maturity. This pain is one of the themes of
great poetry, and no poet since Yeats has done
it better than Cunningham.


THE STANFORD STYLE-Poet J.V.
Cunningham has recorded some of his best
poetry for The Stanford Program for
Recordings in Sound. He is, according to critic
Dana (Jioia, "the most accomplished and
versatile epigrammatist writing today."
