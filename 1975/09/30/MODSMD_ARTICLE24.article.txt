# Newcomer runs down 'Gone in 60 seconds'

### HOWARD BALDWIN 
At least once in everyone's
life sitting in a movie theatre
watching a mediocre film that
sounded good in the advert ising,
there comes the thought, "1
could do better than this!" It
had to happen sometime, I
suppose.
Someone who had simply
gotten tired of movies like Night
Moves and The Drowning 8001,
someone who was bursting with
ambition, someone who was rich
and eccentric, someone who was
self-confident (or is it
egotistical?) enough to actually
believe that he could turn out a
film thai would succeed where
professionals who spent their
lives perfecting their craft had
failed, has finally surfaced.
And by a fluke of fate —
his film, which would be more at
home in his own junkyard, is a
su -ess, because of one gimmick
that draws the violent and
bloodthirsty in faster than a
good uame of rollerball.
This man, H.B. (Toby)
Halicki, is a very rich and
ambitious man. He was one of
13 children when he left home
at age 15. He won car shows
with a customized Buick. With
the prize money, he invested in
real estate at age 17, increasing
his fortune.
At 21 he was operating his
own auto salvaging business (a
politeword for junkyard), called
the H.B. Halicki Mercantile
Company and Junkyard, turning
it into a financial empire
through long hours of hard
work. Halicki is the American
Success Story personified.
Today he is a 34-year-old
man who decided with his
knowledge of cars that he could
write a film about an auto theft
ring, the highlight of which
would be several car chases, the
final one lasting 40 minutes
through the streets of Los
Angeles.
As if this weren't enough, this
Tasmanian devil also decided he
could produce, direcl, star, do
the stunt work ind distribute
Gone In Sixly Seconds. If you
leave your car, locked or not,
one minute is all it takes for a
trained car thief to steal it.
However, Halicki pointed out
in a recent interview in San
Francisco that only 8 pe*cent of
all thefts are by professional car
thieves. The other 92 percent
come about due to tiegl gence on
the owner's part. In this way,
the film is educational In every
other way, it is a travesty.
Halicki insists, "l'\e got a
right to be in this indusiryas well
as anyone else." That's
debatable. To survive in this
industry, one needs talent.
Halicki has none.
Where there is no talent, a
bluff will do. Halicki's bluff is
his gimmick of several car
chases, especially the final one.
Because of this. Gone In
Sixty Seconds is making millions
of dollars. Halicki is distributing
the film in a radically different
way, something both George C.
Scott (.4 Savage Is Loose) and

Tom Laughlin (Billy Jack) have
tried themselves and failed.
The studios are obviously
disturbed about this maverick
whose success will inspire others
to threaten the studios'
monopoly.
Halicki is obsessed with his
distribution techniques that are
netting him a fortune for a film
that is far from worth it. He
talks animatedly about his
struggles with studios and
conglomerate theater chains, a
paranoiac tone creeping into his
speech as he explains his
sabotaging advertising man, who,
while Halicki was at Cannes,
re-routed advertising funds so
that the film would get less
exposure and then bomb.
Thus, the film was failing in
the cities the ad man was
covering. Halicki is sure that the
man was paid to monkeywrench
the operation.
He estimated that had the
man not been caught and fired
and security tightened, the
Mercantile and Junkyard
Company would have gone
bankrupt, and, as it was, lost
close to one million dollars.
He boasts of his success over
better films. At times across the
country Gone In Sixty Seconds,
amazingly enough, has
outgrossed Murder On The
Orient Express, The Towering
Inferno, Earthquake, The Man
With The Golden Gun and
Frecbic and the Bean.
It was once said of chase
films that they eventually will be
reformed to the point that there
won't be any plot, just cars
chasing each other. While Gone
In Sixty Seconds hasn't quite
reached that point, it is close.
The entire film is just an excuse
for car chases.
Maindrian Pace (Halicki) is an
insurance investigator for —
ready for this? — Chase
Research, doubling as the head
of an elaborate ring of car
thieves. They create havoc in the
streets trying to fill an order —
to get 48 expensive cars to a
warehouse on the San Pedro
docks for delivery to Argentina.
Each car Pace has been
ordered to steal has a girl's name
as part of their code.
His gang leads a charmed life.
Everything is unbelievably easy
and convenient for them. The
tactics they employ are so
unlikely and stupid that they
simply can not be taken
seriously, though Halicki has
pretentiously tried to make
them so.
The only car that keeps on
causing trouble is Eleanor, who
in real life is a 546,000
customized 1973 Mustang Mach
1, specially reinforced for the
chase.
For being so supposedly rare,
she certainly turns up in the
most convenient places at the
most convenient times. Pace
steals one, but finds it provident
to put it back. He steals a
second, only to find out that it
is uninsured, and he
returns it. As he drives
off with a third, a disgruntled
employee puts the police on his

trail.
Eleanor is completely
demolished but still running as
Pace, passing a car wash, notices
an identical Mustang, wherein
comes the funniest line in the
movie — he drives up to switch
cars and the clerk says, "Sir,
what happened to your car?"
Pace replies, "Well, you know
these parking lot attendants."
He is once again off and
running, his order complete. If
this is such a rare car, how come
it keeps turning up whenever it's
needed? Suspension of disbelief
is one accomplishment, but
suspension of reality is another.
Why is Gone In Sixty
Seconds a success? Because of its
gimmick. Not because of any
quality or talent on the part of
Halicki and his friends. It is a
true fluke.
The only thing Halicki did to
an established drawing technique
(the car chase was the first thing
that distinguished The French
Connection, not its acting) was
lengthen it. It is no different
from any other car chase, except
that it's drawn out more.
Anyone who had seen as many
movies as Halicki, with enough
money, could turn out a film as
good. Halicki is being praised
because he has turned something
out totally new to the business,
without any previous training.
Boy, does it show!
A lack of quality pervades the
entire movie, especially in the
"performances." Halicki seems
proud of the fact that he used
no professional actors in his
movie, which is nothing to be
proud of, unless you enjoy
seeing self-conscious and clumsy
junkmen bumble their way
through scenes.
It does not make the movie
seem any more realistic. If
anything, it makes it look more
shoddily constructed than it
already is.
Halicki used voice-overs
extensively, so that the action
on screen would distract from
the listlessness of the actors.
The few imaginative and
humorous moments that appear
are quickly ruined by Halicki's
lack of writing talent. At one
point, a security guard is
pursuing Pace, who is in a tow
truck pulling a Dodge. The
guard's dog is barking and
scrambling all over the car. The
guard says, "Damn it, dog, shut
up!", and it's funny, but
Halicki's writing is so
unimaginative that the guard
simply repeats the same thing
over and over, and it ceases
being funny.
Similarly, when one has an
over-abundance of cars smashing
into each other, it ceases being
exciting and quickly becomes
tedious.
The statistics of the chase are
impressive — it took seven
months to film, cost $250,000,
and destroyed 93 cars
(surpassing Freebie and the
Bean's record of 74).
Incidentally, all the cars
demolished ended up at Halicki's
junkyard, so he prospered all the
way around.

It is also the worst car chase
that has ever been filmed. It
would have been easy for
anyone to film a 40-minute car
chase but there are reasons why
it hasn't ever been done by any
competent filmmaker.
Just as caviar becomes
nauseating if eaten in excess, the
chase becomes overdone. It's
like watching a demolition derby
on ABC's Wide World of Sports.
There is shot after shot of cars
rolling over, or ramming each

other, or smashing into parked
cars.
Eventually the chase takes on
the appearance of a Keystone
Kops fiasco, even reaching and
surpassing the stupidity of
1974's The Sugarland Express.
The editing of Gone In Sixty
Seconds is uniformly atrocious.
Cars that have been dented
miraculously appear repaired
moments later. One shot of
Halicki about to hit a police car
will cut to him speeding away,

far away from the same police
car.
The entire chase is edited
with a haphazard sloppiness that
is all too noticeable, making the
movie too flimsy and shoddy for
enjoyment. That this
conglomeration o,f smash-ups
catering to a public that gets its
thrills seeing sandwiched steel
can be hailed as the most
exciting chase ever filmed is
absurd.

It does not say much for the
American people who have been
spending money like mad to see
this drivel. It does not speak well
of the movie industry's future,
either. If we allow mediocrity
like Gone In Sixty Seconds to
survive, it will flourish, and we
will soon be awash in our own
pollution. As long as we tolerate
such garbage, it will be around,
and soon the cinema will be as
useless and thought-provoking as
television.

READY FOR THE JUNKYARD—Super hyphenate writer-producer-director-actor-stunt man Toby Halicki takes Eleanor, one of the
"Last of the Mustangs,"over a rigged and contrived jump in the extremely amateurish "Gone In Sixty Seconds."
At least once in everyone's
life sitting in a movie theatre
watching a mediocre film that
sounded good in the advert ising,
there comes the thought, "1
could do better than this!" It
had to happen sometime, I
suppose.
Someone who had simply
gotten tired of movies like Night
Moves and The Drowning 8001,
someone who was bursting with
ambition, someone who was rich
and eccentric, someone who was
self-confident (or is it
egotistical?) enough to actually
believe that he could turn out a
film thai would succeed where
professionals who spent their
lives perfecting their craft had
failed, has finally surfaced.
And by a fluke of fate —
his film, which would be more at
home in his own junkyard, is a
su -ess, because of one gimmick
that draws the violent and
bloodthirsty in faster than a
good uame of rollerball.
This man, H.B. (Toby)
Halicki, is a very rich and
ambitious man. He was one of
13 children when he left home
at age 15. He won car shows
with a customized Buick. With
the prize money, he invested in
real estate at age 17, increasing
his fortune.
At 21 he was operating his
own auto salvaging business (a
politeword for junkyard), called
the H.B. Halicki Mercantile
Company and Junkyard, turning
it into a financial empire
through long hours of hard
work. Halicki is the American
Success Story personified.
Today he is a 34-year-old
man who decided with his
knowledge of cars that he could
write a film about an auto theft
ring, the highlight of which
would be several car chases, the
final one lasting 40 minutes
through the streets of Los
Angeles.
As if this weren't enough, this
Tasmanian devil also decided he
could produce, direcl, star, do
the stunt work ind distribute
Gone In Sixly Seconds. If you
leave your car, locked or not,
one minute is all it takes for a
trained car thief to steal it.
However, Halicki pointed out
in a recent interview in San
Francisco that only 8 pe*cent of
all thefts are by professional car
thieves. The other 92 percent
come about due to tiegl gence on
the owner's part. In this way,
the film is educational In every
other way, it is a travesty.
Halicki insists, "l'\e got a
right to be in this indusiryas well
as anyone else." That's
debatable. To survive in this
industry, one needs talent.
Halicki has none.
Where there is no talent, a
bluff will do. Halicki's bluff is
his gimmick of several car
chases, especially the final one.
Because of this. Gone In
Sixty Seconds is making millions
of dollars. Halicki is distributing
the film in a radically different
way, something both George C.
Scott (.4 Savage Is Loose) and

Tom Laughlin (Billy Jack) have
tried themselves and failed.
The studios are obviously
disturbed about this maverick
whose success will inspire others
to threaten the studios'
monopoly.
Halicki is obsessed with his
distribution techniques that are
netting him a fortune for a film
that is far from worth it. He
talks animatedly about his
struggles with studios and
conglomerate theater chains, a
paranoiac tone creeping into his
speech as he explains his
sabotaging advertising man, who,
while Halicki was at Cannes,
re-routed advertising funds so
that the film would get less
exposure and then bomb.
Thus, the film was failing in
the cities the ad man was
covering. Halicki is sure that the
man was paid to monkeywrench
the operation.
He estimated that had the
man not been caught and fired
and security tightened, the
Mercantile and Junkyard
Company would have gone
bankrupt, and, as it was, lost
close to one million dollars.
He boasts of his success over
better films. At times across the
country Gone In Sixty Seconds,
amazingly enough, has
outgrossed Murder On The
Orient Express, The Towering
Inferno, Earthquake, The Man
With The Golden Gun and
Frecbic and the Bean.
It was once said of chase
films that they eventually will be
reformed to the point that there
won't be any plot, just cars
chasing each other. While Gone
In Sixty Seconds hasn't quite
reached that point, it is close.
The entire film is just an excuse
for car chases.
Maindrian Pace (Halicki) is an
insurance investigator for —
ready for this? — Chase
Research, doubling as the head
of an elaborate ring of car
thieves. They create havoc in the
streets trying to fill an order —
to get 48 expensive cars to a
warehouse on the San Pedro
docks for delivery to Argentina.
Each car Pace has been
ordered to steal has a girl's name
as part of their code.
His gang leads a charmed life.
Everything is unbelievably easy
and convenient for them. The
tactics they employ are so
unlikely and stupid that they
simply can not be taken
seriously, though Halicki has
pretentiously tried to make
them so.
The only car that keeps on
causing trouble is Eleanor, who
in real life is a 546,000
customized 1973 Mustang Mach
1, specially reinforced for the
chase.
For being so supposedly rare,
she certainly turns up in the
most convenient places at the
most convenient times. Pace
steals one, but finds it provident
to put it back. He steals a
second, only to find out that it
is uninsured, and he
returns it. As he drives
off with a third, a disgruntled
employee puts the police on his

trail.
Eleanor is completely
demolished but still running as
Pace, passing a car wash, notices
an identical Mustang, wherein
comes the funniest line in the
movie — he drives up to switch
cars and the clerk says, "Sir,
what happened to your car?"
Pace replies, "Well, you know
these parking lot attendants."
He is once again off and
running, his order complete. If
this is such a rare car, how come
it keeps turning up whenever it's
needed? Suspension of disbelief
is one accomplishment, but
suspension of reality is another.
Why is Gone In Sixty
Seconds a success? Because of its
gimmick. Not because of any
quality or talent on the part of
Halicki and his friends. It is a
true fluke.
The only thing Halicki did to
an established drawing technique
(the car chase was the first thing
that distinguished The French
Connection, not its acting) was
lengthen it. It is no different
from any other car chase, except
that it's drawn out more.
Anyone who had seen as many
movies as Halicki, with enough
money, could turn out a film as
good. Halicki is being praised
because he has turned something
out totally new to the business,
without any previous training.
Boy, does it show!
A lack of quality pervades the
entire movie, especially in the
"performances." Halicki seems
proud of the fact that he used
no professional actors in his
movie, which is nothing to be
proud of, unless you enjoy
seeing self-conscious and clumsy
junkmen bumble their way
through scenes.
It does not make the movie
seem any more realistic. If
anything, it makes it look more
shoddily constructed than it
already is.
Halicki used voice-overs
extensively, so that the action
on screen would distract from
the listlessness of the actors.
The few imaginative and
humorous moments that appear
are quickly ruined by Halicki's
lack of writing talent. At one
point, a security guard is
pursuing Pace, who is in a tow
truck pulling a Dodge. The
guard's dog is barking and
scrambling all over the car. The
guard says, "Damn it, dog, shut
up!", and it's funny, but
Halicki's writing is so
unimaginative that the guard
simply repeats the same thing
over and over, and it ceases
being funny.
Similarly, when one has an
over-abundance of cars smashing
into each other, it ceases being
exciting and quickly becomes
tedious.
The statistics of the chase are
impressive — it took seven
months to film, cost $250,000,
and destroyed 93 cars
(surpassing Freebie and the
Bean's record of 74).
Incidentally, all the cars
demolished ended up at Halicki's
junkyard, so he prospered all the
way around.

It is also the worst car chase
that has ever been filmed. It
would have been easy for
anyone to film a 40-minute car
chase but there are reasons why
it hasn't ever been done by any
competent filmmaker.
Just as caviar becomes
nauseating if eaten in excess, the
chase becomes overdone. It's
like watching a demolition derby
on ABC's Wide World of Sports.
There is shot after shot of cars
rolling over, or ramming each

other, or smashing into parked
cars.
Eventually the chase takes on
the appearance of a Keystone
Kops fiasco, even reaching and
surpassing the stupidity of
1974's The Sugarland Express.
The editing of Gone In Sixty
Seconds is uniformly atrocious.
Cars that have been dented
miraculously appear repaired
moments later. One shot of
Halicki about to hit a police car
will cut to him speeding away,

far away from the same police
car.
The entire chase is edited
with a haphazard sloppiness that
is all too noticeable, making the
movie too flimsy and shoddy for
enjoyment. That this
conglomeration o,f smash-ups
catering to a public that gets its
thrills seeing sandwiched steel
can be hailed as the most
exciting chase ever filmed is
absurd.

It does not say much for the
American people who have been
spending money like mad to see
this drivel. It does not speak well
of the movie industry's future,
either. If we allow mediocrity
like Gone In Sixty Seconds to
survive, it will flourish, and we
will soon be awash in our own
pollution. As long as we tolerate
such garbage, it will be around,
and soon the cinema will be as
useless and thought-provoking as
television.

conglomeration o,f smash-ups
catering to a public that gets its
thrills seeing sandwiched steel
can be hailed as the most
exciting chase ever filmed is
absurd.

It does not say much for the
American people who have been
spending money like mad to see
this drivel. It does not speak well
of the movie industry's future,
either. If we allow mediocrity
like Gone In Sixty Seconds to
survive, it will flourish, and we
will soon be awash in our own
pollution. As long as we tolerate
such garbage, it will be around,
and soon the cinema will be as
useless and thought-provoking as
television.

READY FOR THE JUNKYARD—Super hyphenate writer-producer-director-actor-stunt man Toby Halicki takes Eleanor, one of the
"Last of the Mustangs,"over a rigged and contrived jump in the extremely amateurish "Gone In Sixty Seconds."
At least once in everyone's
life sitting in a movie theatre
watching a mediocre film that
sounded good in the advert ising,
there comes the thought, "1
could do better than this!" It
had to happen sometime, I
suppose.
Someone who had simply
gotten tired of movies like Night
Moves and The Drowning 8001,
someone who was bursting with
ambition, someone who was rich
and eccentric, someone who was
self-confident (or is it
egotistical?) enough to actually
believe that he could turn out a
film thai would succeed where
professionals who spent their
lives perfecting their craft had
failed, has finally surfaced.
And by a fluke of fate —
his film, which would be more at
home in his own junkyard, is a
su -ess, because of one gimmick
that draws the violent and
bloodthirsty in faster than a
good uame of rollerball.
This man, H.B. (Toby)
Halicki, is a very rich and
ambitious man. He was one of
13 children when he left home
at age 15. He won car shows
with a customized Buick. With
the prize money, he invested in
real estate at age 17, increasing
his fortune.
At 21 he was operating his
own auto salvaging business (a
politeword for junkyard), called
the H.B. Halicki Mercantile
Company and Junkyard, turning
it into a financial empire
through long hours of hard
work. Halicki is the American
Success Story personified.
Today he is a 34-year-old
man who decided with his
knowledge of cars that he could
write a film about an auto theft
ring, the highlight of which
would be several car chases, the
final one lasting 40 minutes
through the streets of Los
Angeles.
As if this weren't enough, this
Tasmanian devil also decided he
could produce, direcl, star, do
the stunt work ind distribute
Gone In Sixly Seconds. If you
leave your car, locked or not,
one minute is all it takes for a
trained car thief to steal it.
However, Halicki pointed out
in a recent interview in San
Francisco that only 8 pe*cent of
all thefts are by professional car
thieves. The other 92 percent
come about due to tiegl gence on
the owner's part. In this way,
the film is educational In every
other way, it is a travesty.
Halicki insists, "l'\e got a
right to be in this indusiryas well
as anyone else." That's
debatable. To survive in this
industry, one needs talent.
Halicki has none.
Where there is no talent, a
bluff will do. Halicki's bluff is
his gimmick of several car
chases, especially the final one.
Because of this. Gone In
Sixty Seconds is making millions
of dollars. Halicki is distributing
the film in a radically different
way, something both George C.
Scott (.4 Savage Is Loose) and

Tom Laughlin (Billy Jack) have
tried themselves and failed.
The studios are obviously
disturbed about this maverick
whose success will inspire others
to threaten the studios'
monopoly.
Halicki is obsessed with his
distribution techniques that are
netting him a fortune for a film
that is far from worth it. He
talks animatedly about his
struggles with studios and
conglomerate theater chains, a
paranoiac tone creeping into his
speech as he explains his
sabotaging advertising man, who,
while Halicki was at Cannes,
re-routed advertising funds so
that the film would get less
exposure and then bomb.
Thus, the film was failing in
the cities the ad man was
covering. Halicki is sure that the
man was paid to monkeywrench
the operation.
He estimated that had the
man not been caught and fired
and security tightened, the
Mercantile and Junkyard
Company would have gone
bankrupt, and, as it was, lost
close to one million dollars.
He boasts of his success over
better films. At times across the
country Gone In Sixty Seconds,
amazingly enough, has
outgrossed Murder On The
Orient Express, The Towering
Inferno, Earthquake, The Man
With The Golden Gun and
Frecbic and the Bean.
It was once said of chase
films that they eventually will be
reformed to the point that there
won't be any plot, just cars
chasing each other. While Gone
In Sixty Seconds hasn't quite
reached that point, it is close.
The entire film is just an excuse
for car chases.
Maindrian Pace (Halicki) is an
insurance investigator for —
ready for this? — Chase
Research, doubling as the head
of an elaborate ring of car
thieves. They create havoc in the
streets trying to fill an order —
to get 48 expensive cars to a
warehouse on the San Pedro
docks for delivery to Argentina.
Each car Pace has been
ordered to steal has a girl's name
as part of their code.
His gang leads a charmed life.
Everything is unbelievably easy
and convenient for them. The
tactics they employ are so
unlikely and stupid that they
simply can not be taken
seriously, though Halicki has
pretentiously tried to make
them so.
The only car that keeps on
causing trouble is Eleanor, who
in real life is a 546,000
customized 1973 Mustang Mach
1, specially reinforced for the
chase.
For being so supposedly rare,
she certainly turns up in the
most convenient places at the
most convenient times. Pace
steals one, but finds it provident
to put it back. He steals a
second, only to find out that it
is uninsured, and he
returns it. As he drives
off with a third, a disgruntled
employee puts the police on his

trail.
Eleanor is completely
demolished but still running as
Pace, passing a car wash, notices
an identical Mustang, wherein
comes the funniest line in the
movie — he drives up to switch
cars and the clerk says, "Sir,
what happened to your car?"
Pace replies, "Well, you know
these parking lot attendants."
He is once again off and
running, his order complete. If
this is such a rare car, how come
it keeps turning up whenever it's
needed? Suspension of disbelief
is one accomplishment, but
suspension of reality is another.
Why is Gone In Sixty
Seconds a success? Because of its
gimmick. Not because of any
quality or talent on the part of
Halicki and his friends. It is a
true fluke.
The only thing Halicki did to
an established drawing technique
(the car chase was the first thing
that distinguished The French
Connection, not its acting) was
lengthen it. It is no different
from any other car chase, except
that it's drawn out more.
Anyone who had seen as many
movies as Halicki, with enough
money, could turn out a film as
good. Halicki is being praised
because he has turned something
out totally new to the business,
without any previous training.
Boy, does it show!
A lack of quality pervades the
entire movie, especially in the
"performances." Halicki seems
proud of the fact that he used
no professional actors in his
movie, which is nothing to be
proud of, unless you enjoy
seeing self-conscious and clumsy
junkmen bumble their way
through scenes.
It does not make the movie
seem any more realistic. If
anything, it makes it look more
shoddily constructed than it
already is.
Halicki used voice-overs
extensively, so that the action
on screen would distract from
the listlessness of the actors.
The few imaginative and
humorous moments that appear
are quickly ruined by Halicki's
lack of writing talent. At one
point, a security guard is
pursuing Pace, who is in a tow
truck pulling a Dodge. The
guard's dog is barking and
scrambling all over the car. The
guard says, "Damn it, dog, shut
up!", and it's funny, but
Halicki's writing is so
unimaginative that the guard
simply repeats the same thing
over and over, and it ceases
being funny.
Similarly, when one has an
over-abundance of cars smashing
into each other, it ceases being
exciting and quickly becomes
tedious.
The statistics of the chase are
impressive — it took seven
months to film, cost $250,000,
and destroyed 93 cars
(surpassing Freebie and the
Bean's record of 74).
Incidentally, all the cars
demolished ended up at Halicki's
junkyard, so he prospered all the
way around.

It is also the worst car chase
that has ever been filmed. It
would have been easy for
anyone to film a 40-minute car
chase but there are reasons why
it hasn't ever been done by any
competent filmmaker.
Just as caviar becomes
nauseating if eaten in excess, the
chase becomes overdone. It's
like watching a demolition derby
on ABC's Wide World of Sports.
There is shot after shot of cars
rolling over, or ramming each

other, or smashing into parked
cars.
Eventually the chase takes on
the appearance of a Keystone
Kops fiasco, even reaching and
surpassing the stupidity of
1974's The Sugarland Express.
The editing of Gone In Sixty
Seconds is uniformly atrocious.
Cars that have been dented
miraculously appear repaired
moments later. One shot of
Halicki about to hit a police car
will cut to him speeding away,

far away from the same police
car.
The entire chase is edited
with a haphazard sloppiness that
is all too noticeable, making the
movie too flimsy and shoddy for
enjoyment. That this
conglomeration o,f smash-ups
catering to a public that gets its
thrills seeing sandwiched steel
can be hailed as the most
exciting chase ever filmed is
absurd.

It does not say much for the

The editing of Gone In Sixty
Seconds is uniformly atrocious.
Cars that have been dented
miraculously appear repaired
moments later. One shot of
Halicki about to hit a police car
will cut to him speeding away,

far away from the same police
car.
The entire chase is edited
with a haphazard sloppiness that
is all too noticeable, making the
movie too flimsy and shoddy for
enjoyment. That this
conglomeration o,f smash-ups
catering to a public that gets its
thrills seeing sandwiched steel
can be hailed as the most
exciting chase ever filmed is
absurd.

It does not say much for the
American people who have been
spending money like mad to see
this drivel. It does not speak well
of the movie industry's future,
either. If we allow mediocrity
like Gone In Sixty Seconds to
survive, it will flourish, and we
will soon be awash in our own
pollution. As long as we tolerate
such garbage, it will be around,
and soon the cinema will be as
useless and thought-provoking as
television.

READY FOR THE JUNKYARD—Super hyphenate writer-producer-director-actor-stunt man Toby Halicki takes Eleanor, one of the
"Last of the Mustangs,"over a rigged and contrived jump in the extremely amateurish "Gone In Sixty Seconds."
At least once in everyone's
life sitting in a movie theatre
watching a mediocre film that
sounded good in the advert ising,
there comes the thought, "1
could do better than this!" It
had to happen sometime, I
suppose.
Someone who had simply
gotten tired of movies like Night
Moves and The Drowning 8001,
someone who was bursting with
ambition, someone who was rich
and eccentric, someone who was
self-confident (or is it
egotistical?) enough to actually
believe that he could turn out a
film thai would succeed where
professionals who spent their
lives perfecting their craft had
failed, has finally surfaced.
And by a fluke of fate —
his film, which would be more at
home in his own junkyard, is a
su -ess, because of one gimmick
that draws the violent and
bloodthirsty in faster than a
good uame of rollerball.
This man, H.B. (Toby)
Halicki, is a very rich and
ambitious man. He was one of
13 children when he left home
at age 15. He won car shows
with a customized Buick. With
the prize money, he invested in
real estate at age 17, increasing
his fortune.
At 21 he was operating his
own auto salvaging business (a
politeword for junkyard), called
the H.B. Halicki Mercantile
Company and Junkyard, turning
it into a financial empire
through long hours of hard
work. Halicki is the American
Success Story personified.
Today he is a 34-year-old
man who decided with his
knowledge of cars that he could
write a film about an auto theft
ring, the highlight of which
would be several car chases, the
final one lasting 40 minutes
through the streets of Los
Angeles.
As if this weren't enough, this
Tasmanian devil also decided he
could produce, direcl, star, do
the stunt work ind distribute
Gone In Sixly Seconds. If you
leave your car, locked or not,
one minute is all it takes for a
trained car thief to steal it.
However, Halicki pointed out
in a recent interview in San
Francisco that only 8 pe*cent of
all thefts are by professional car
thieves. The other 92 percent
come about due to tiegl gence on
the owner's part. In this way,
the film is educational In every
other way, it is a travesty.
Halicki insists, "l'\e got a
right to be in this indusiryas well
as anyone else." That's
debatable. To survive in this
industry, one needs talent.
Halicki has none.
Where there is no talent, a
bluff will do. Halicki's bluff is
his gimmick of several car
chases, especially the final one.
Because of this. Gone In
Sixty Seconds is making millions
of dollars. Halicki is distributing
the film in a radically different
way, something both George C.
Scott (.4 Savage Is Loose) and

Tom Laughlin (Billy Jack) have
tried themselves and failed.
The studios are obviously
disturbed about this maverick
whose success will inspire others
to threaten the studios'
monopoly.
Halicki is obsessed with his
distribution techniques that are
netting him a fortune for a film
that is far from worth it. He
talks animatedly about his
struggles with studios and
conglomerate theater chains, a
paranoiac tone creeping into his
speech as he explains his
sabotaging advertising man, who,
while Halicki was at Cannes,
re-routed advertising funds so
that the film would get less
exposure and then bomb.
Thus, the film was failing in
the cities the ad man was
covering. Halicki is sure that the
man was paid to monkeywrench
the operation.
He estimated that had the
man not been caught and fired
and security tightened, the
Mercantile and Junkyard
Company would have gone
bankrupt, and, as it was, lost
close to one million dollars.
He boasts of his success over
better films. At times across the
country Gone In Sixty Seconds,
amazingly enough, has
outgrossed Murder On The
Orient Express, The Towering
Inferno, Earthquake, The Man
With The Golden Gun and
Frecbic and the Bean.
It was once said of chase
films that they eventually will be
reformed to the point that there
won't be any plot, just cars
chasing each other. While Gone
In Sixty Seconds hasn't quite
reached that point, it is close.
The entire film is just an excuse
for car chases.
Maindrian Pace (Halicki) is an
insurance investigator for —
ready for this? — Chase
Research, doubling as the head
of an elaborate ring of car
thieves. They create havoc in the
streets trying to fill an order —
to get 48 expensive cars to a
warehouse on the San Pedro
docks for delivery to Argentina.
Each car Pace has been
ordered to steal has a girl's name
as part of their code.
His gang leads a charmed life.
Everything is unbelievably easy
and convenient for them. The
tactics they employ are so
unlikely and stupid that they
simply can not be taken
seriously, though Halicki has
pretentiously tried to make
them so.
The only car that keeps on
causing trouble is Eleanor, who
in real life is a 546,000
customized 1973 Mustang Mach
1, specially reinforced for the
chase.
For being so supposedly rare,
she certainly turns up in the
most convenient places at the
most convenient times. Pace
steals one, but finds it provident
to put it back. He steals a
second, only to find out that it
is uninsured, and he
returns it. As he drives
off with a third, a disgruntled
employee puts the police on his

trail.
Eleanor is completely
demolished but still running as
Pace, passing a car wash, notices
an identical Mustang, wherein
comes the funniest line in the
movie — he drives up to switch
cars and the clerk says, "Sir,
what happened to your car?"
Pace replies, "Well, you know
these parking lot attendants."
He is once again off and
running, his order complete. If
this is such a rare car, how come
it keeps turning up whenever it's
needed? Suspension of disbelief
is one accomplishment, but
suspension of reality is another.
Why is Gone In Sixty
Seconds a success? Because of its
gimmick. Not because of any
quality or talent on the part of
Halicki and his friends. It is a
true fluke.
The only thing Halicki did to
an established drawing technique
(the car chase was the first thing
that distinguished The French
Connection, not its acting) was
lengthen it. It is no different
from any other car chase, except
that it's drawn out more.
Anyone who had seen as many
movies as Halicki, with enough
money, could turn out a film as
good. Halicki is being praised
because he has turned something
out totally new to the business,
without any previous training.
Boy, does it show!
A lack of quality pervades the
entire movie, especially in the
"performances." Halicki seems
proud of the fact that he used
no professional actors in his
movie, which is nothing to be
proud of, unless you enjoy
seeing self-conscious and clumsy
junkmen bumble their way
through scenes.
It does not make the movie
seem any more realistic. If
anything, it makes it look more
shoddily constructed than it
already is.
Halicki used voice-overs
extensively, so that the action
on screen would distract from
the listlessness of the actors.
The few imaginative and
humorous moments that appear
are quickly ruined by Halicki's
lack of writing talent. At one
point, a security guard is
pursuing Pace, who is in a tow
truck pulling a Dodge. The
guard's dog is barking and
scrambling all over the car. The
guard says, "Damn it, dog, shut
up!", and it's funny, but
Halicki's writing is so
unimaginative that the guard
simply repeats the same thing
over and over, and it ceases
being funny.
Similarly, when one has an
over-abundance of cars smashing
into each other, it ceases being
exciting and quickly becomes
tedious.
The statistics of the chase are
impressive — it took seven
months to film, cost $250,000,
and destroyed 93 cars
(surpassing Freebie and the
Bean's record of 74).
Incidentally, all the cars
demolished ended up at Halicki's
junkyard, so he prospered all the
way around.

It is also the worst car chase
that has ever been filmed. It
would have been easy for
anyone to film a 40-minute car
chase but there are reasons why
it hasn't ever been done by any
competent filmmaker.
Just as caviar becomes
nauseating if eaten in excess, the
chase becomes overdone. It's
like watching a demolition derby
on ABC's Wide World of Sports.
There is shot after shot of cars
rolling over, or ramming each

other, or smashing into parked
cars.
Eventually the chase takes on
the appearance of a Keystone
Kops fiasco, even reaching and
surpassing the stupidity of
1974's The Sugarland Express.
The editing of Gone In Sixty
Seconds is uniformly atrocious.
Cars that have been dented
miraculously appear repaired

nauseating if eaten in excess, the
chase becomes overdone. It's
like watching a demolition derby
on ABC's Wide World of Sports.
There is shot after shot of cars
rolling over, or ramming each

other, or smashing into parked
cars.
Eventually the chase takes on
the appearance of a Keystone
Kops fiasco, even reaching and
surpassing the stupidity of
1974's The Sugarland Express.
The editing of Gone In Sixty
Seconds is uniformly atrocious.
Cars that have been dented
miraculously appear repaired
moments later. One shot of
Halicki about to hit a police car
will cut to him speeding away,

far away from the same police
car.
The entire chase is edited
with a haphazard sloppiness that
is all too noticeable, making the
movie too flimsy and shoddy for
enjoyment. That this
conglomeration o,f smash-ups
catering to a public that gets its
thrills seeing sandwiched steel
can be hailed as the most
exciting chase ever filmed is
absurd.

It does not say much for the
American people who have been
spending money like mad to see
this drivel. It does not speak well
of the movie industry's future,
either. If we allow mediocrity
like Gone In Sixty Seconds to
survive, it will flourish, and we
will soon be awash in our own
pollution. As long as we tolerate
such garbage, it will be around,
and soon the cinema will be as
useless and thought-provoking as
television.

READY FOR THE JUNKYARD—Super hyphenate writer-producer-director-actor-stunt man Toby Halicki takes Eleanor, one of the
"Last of the Mustangs,"over a rigged and contrived jump in the extremely amateurish "Gone In Sixty Seconds."
At least once in everyone's
life sitting in a movie theatre
watching a mediocre film that
sounded good in the advert ising,
there comes the thought, "1
could do better than this!" It
had to happen sometime, I
suppose.
Someone who had simply
gotten tired of movies like Night
Moves and The Drowning 8001,
someone who was bursting with
ambition, someone who was rich
and eccentric, someone who was
self-confident (or is it
egotistical?) enough to actually
believe that he could turn out a
film thai would succeed where
professionals who spent their
lives perfecting their craft had
failed, has finally surfaced.
And by a fluke of fate —
his film, which would be more at
home in his own junkyard, is a
su -ess, because of one gimmick
that draws the violent and
bloodthirsty in faster than a
good uame of rollerball.
This man, H.B. (Toby)
Halicki, is a very rich and
ambitious man. He was one of
13 children when he left home
at age 15. He won car shows
with a customized Buick. With
the prize money, he invested in
real estate at age 17, increasing
his fortune.
At 21 he was operating his
own auto salvaging business (a
politeword for junkyard), called
the H.B. Halicki Mercantile
Company and Junkyard, turning
it into a financial empire
through long hours of hard
work. Halicki is the American
Success Story personified.
Today he is a 34-year-old
man who decided with his
knowledge of cars that he could
write a film about an auto theft
ring, the highlight of which
would be several car chases, the
final one lasting 40 minutes
through the streets of Los
Angeles.
As if this weren't enough, this
Tasmanian devil also decided he
could produce, direcl, star, do
the stunt work ind distribute
Gone In Sixly Seconds. If you
leave your car, locked or not,
one minute is all it takes for a
trained car thief to steal it.
However, Halicki pointed out
in a recent interview in San
Francisco that only 8 pe*cent of
all thefts are by professional car
thieves. The other 92 percent
come about due to tiegl gence on
the owner's part. In this way,
the film is educational In every
other way, it is a travesty.
Halicki insists, "l'\e got a
right to be in this indusiryas well
as anyone else." That's
debatable. To survive in this
industry, one needs talent.
Halicki has none.
Where there is no talent, a
bluff will do. Halicki's bluff is
his gimmick of several car
chases, especially the final one.
Because of this. Gone In
Sixty Seconds is making millions
of dollars. Halicki is distributing
the film in a radically different
way, something both George C.
Scott (.4 Savage Is Loose) and

Tom Laughlin (Billy Jack) have
tried themselves and failed.
The studios are obviously
disturbed about this maverick
whose success will inspire others
to threaten the studios'
monopoly.
Halicki is obsessed with his
distribution techniques that are
netting him a fortune for a film
that is far from worth it. He
talks animatedly about his
struggles with studios and
conglomerate theater chains, a
paranoiac tone creeping into his
speech as he explains his
sabotaging advertising man, who,
while Halicki was at Cannes,
re-routed advertising funds so
that the film would get less
exposure and then bomb.
Thus, the film was failing in
the cities the ad man was
covering. Halicki is sure that the
man was paid to monkeywrench
the operation.
He estimated that had the
man not been caught and fired
and security tightened, the
Mercantile and Junkyard
Company would have gone
bankrupt, and, as it was, lost
close to one million dollars.
He boasts of his success over
better films. At times across the
country Gone In Sixty Seconds,
amazingly enough, has
outgrossed Murder On The
Orient Express, The Towering
Inferno, Earthquake, The Man
With The Golden Gun and
Frecbic and the Bean.
It was once said of chase
films that they eventually will be
reformed to the point that there
won't be any plot, just cars
chasing each other. While Gone
In Sixty Seconds hasn't quite
reached that point, it is close.
The entire film is just an excuse
for car chases.
Maindrian Pace (Halicki) is an
insurance investigator for —
ready for this? — Chase
Research, doubling as the head
of an elaborate ring of car
thieves. They create havoc in the
streets trying to fill an order —
to get 48 expensive cars to a
warehouse on the San Pedro
docks for delivery to Argentina.
Each car Pace has been
ordered to steal has a girl's name
as part of their code.
His gang leads a charmed life.
Everything is unbelievably easy
and convenient for them. The
tactics they employ are so
unlikely and stupid that they
simply can not be taken
seriously, though Halicki has
pretentiously tried to make
them so.
The only car that keeps on
causing trouble is Eleanor, who
in real life is a 546,000
customized 1973 Mustang Mach
1, specially reinforced for the
chase.
For being so supposedly rare,
she certainly turns up in the
most convenient places at the
most convenient times. Pace
steals one, but finds it provident
to put it back. He steals a
second, only to find out that it
is uninsured, and he
returns it. As he drives
off with a third, a disgruntled
employee puts the police on his

trail.
Eleanor is completely
demolished but still running as
Pace, passing a car wash, notices
an identical Mustang, wherein
comes the funniest line in the
movie — he drives up to switch
cars and the clerk says, "Sir,
what happened to your car?"
Pace replies, "Well, you know
these parking lot attendants."
He is once again off and
running, his order complete. If
this is such a rare car, how come
it keeps turning up whenever it's
needed? Suspension of disbelief
is one accomplishment, but
suspension of reality is another.
Why is Gone In Sixty
Seconds a success? Because of its
gimmick. Not because of any
quality or talent on the part of
Halicki and his friends. It is a
true fluke.
The only thing Halicki did to
an established drawing technique
(the car chase was the first thing
that distinguished The French
Connection, not its acting) was
lengthen it. It is no different
from any other car chase, except
that it's drawn out more.
Anyone who had seen as many
movies as Halicki, with enough
money, could turn out a film as
good. Halicki is being praised
because he has turned something
out totally new to the business,
without any previous training.
Boy, does it show!
A lack of quality pervades the
entire movie, especially in the
"performances." Halicki seems
proud of the fact that he used
no professional actors in his
movie, which is nothing to be
proud of, unless you enjoy
seeing self-conscious and clumsy
junkmen bumble their way
through scenes.
It does not make the movie
seem any more realistic. If
anything, it makes it look more
shoddily constructed than it
already is.
Halicki used voice-overs
extensively, so that the action
on screen would distract from
the listlessness of the actors.
The few imaginative and
humorous moments that appear
are quickly ruined by Halicki's
lack of writing talent. At one
point, a security guard is
pursuing Pace, who is in a tow
truck pulling a Dodge. The
guard's dog is barking and
scrambling all over the car. The
guard says, "Damn it, dog, shut
up!", and it's funny, but
Halicki's writing is so
unimaginative that the guard
simply repeats the same thing
over and over, and it ceases
being funny.
Similarly, when one has an
over-abundance of cars smashing
into each other, it ceases being
exciting and quickly becomes
tedious.
The statistics of the chase are
impressive — it took seven
months to film, cost $250,000,
and destroyed 93 cars
(surpassing Freebie and the
Bean's record of 74).
Incidentally, all the cars
demolished ended up at Halicki's
junkyard, so he prospered all the
way around.

It is also the worst car chase
that has ever been filmed. It
would have been easy for
anyone to film a 40-minute car
chase but there are reasons why
it hasn't ever been done by any
competent filmmaker.
Just as caviar becomes
nauseating if eaten in excess, the
chase becomes overdone. It's
like watching a demolition derby
on ABC's Wide World of Sports.
There is shot after shot of cars
rolling over, or ramming each
