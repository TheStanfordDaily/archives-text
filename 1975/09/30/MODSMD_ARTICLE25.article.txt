# MGM brings back good old days

Hollywood senses that it has
been distributing substandard
material recently and, like the
comfortable, nostalgic place
Hollywood is, instead of taking
steps to increase motion picture

quality, it has taken the easy
way out towards a solution.
The newest trend to snowball
is the Musical Re-Release. It
started with That's
Entertainment, which became an
immediate success.

Enterprising minds at
Columbia Pictures, inspired by a
resurgence of A 1 Jolson's
popularity, re-released The
Jolson Story, a 1946 musical
starring Larry Parks (whose
career was later destroyed during
the McCarthy era).
Not to be outdone,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has
reached into the depths of its
vaults and magically come out
with completely new prints of
1952's Singin' In The Rain.
Singin' In The Rain is a
worthwhile experience for two
important reasons. Primarily, it's
a terrific movie. It's a love story
set against the most turbulent
time in Hollywood's history —
the transition from silents to
talkies, when careers were
created and destroyed with the
wink of an eye. No other
innovation caused so much
turmoil.
The songs, especially "Singin'
In The Rain" and "Make'Em
Laugh," are masterpieces of
lyrics and choreography. The
story, unlike so many of today's
so-called blockbusters, is
delightful, complete with a
Snow White, a Prince Oarmin*;
and Wicked Witn
modernized, of course.
Secondarily, for a child
brought up on Sky King. Bullitt
and A Woman Under Tl e
Influence, it provides
transportation into the past.
Cliched as it is, they do not
make movies like this anymore.

because Americans' tastes have
changed. Singin' In The Rain
shows how it used to be. It is
fascinating to watch what our
parents used to see at the movies
for 25 cents, before inflation
and Ingmar Bergman. It is a true
anachronism.
Gene Kelly co-directed with
Stanley Donen, and stars as
1927's most romantic personage,
Don Lockwood. He is perfect,
blending together the right
amount of charm, comedy,
buffoonery and dignity.
His sidekick Cosmo is played
by Donald O'Connor, singing
and dancing excellently, with
extremely mobile features and
feet. His "Make 'Em Laugh"
number is a high point of the
picture.
In her screen debut (this was
23 years ago, remember) is a
surprisingly young Debbie
Reynolds, playing Lockwood's
protege, Kathv Selden.
Singin' In The Rain is an
entertaining, educational history
lesson, showing how they used
to make movies in two eras
simultaneously. It gives us 1927,
when no one was quite sure
what he was doing, and
1952 when they knew exactly
what they were doing. It has no
more pretentions than to
entertain for two hours. It is a
distinct improvement over many
of today's movies.
(Singin' In The Rain is now
playing at Cinema 150 in Santa
Clara )
