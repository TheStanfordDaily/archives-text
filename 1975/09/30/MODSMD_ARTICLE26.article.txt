Sodom and Gomorrah. The words are
enough to raise the hackles on a
fundamentalist preacher, or scare the pants
off a youngster in an all-boys school.
Soaom has become more than the name of
an ancient city — more like a Mecca in
reverse, with many forbidden connotations.
So leave it to the Mitchell Brothers, Artie
and Jim, those kingpins of San Francisco
high-grade hardcore movies, to give to the
world Sodom andGomurruh— The Last Seven
Days.
This first hardcore spectacular plays it
mostly for laughs, making light of sodomy,
circumcision and Jehovah, in no particular
order. It also has fun with everything in
between, from science fiction movies to
John Wayne.
The ultimate question, though, is — Was
it worth $600,000 and twelve months' time,
or, closer to home, is it worth $3.50 a piece
for a movie with a few good laughs that
appeal to one's prurient interest?
Well, here's a fact or two about just what
goes on in the movie. Those who faint easily
or are offended by sexual explicitness are
advised to go and watch the family hour on
television and read no further.
Now, to the meat (ho ho) of this review,
since all the prudes have stopped reading.
The porn firsts for Sodom and Gomorrahare
the seven-foot giant who can actually fellate
himself; the longest cucumber ever used as a
dildo; the largest and longest orgy scene;
and the first time a chimp has spoken with
the voice of John Wayne (perhaps that's
more sacrilegious than pornographic).
All the foregoing is worked into a plot
that just barely makes sense. Basically, two
astronauts from another galaxy arrive in

orbit over Sodom about the same time as
Lot and his wife and daughter decide to
take up residence in Sodom.
In Sodom, Bera, the king, has conceived
of a novel way of population control, which
outlaws regular sexual intercourse as
contrary to the laws of Anu.
Bera points this backward way of doing
things out to Lot, who grudgingly accepts
it. The astronauts, however, don't, and in
between comedy, orgies and revelations,
Sodom meets its inevitable end.
So much for the plot. The biggest
unanswered question is just what does this
movie offer for $600,000 that makes it the
most expensive of all porn films? The acting
is good, the film quality is fine and the
costumes are authentic.
But the town of Sodom looks like a
cheap tent city, and the editing process,
which took nine months according to
publicity materials, is choppy and
confusing.
But here's the real reason for the
costliness of the film. Lot's daughter was
portrayed by Deborah Brast, and another
actress, Giovanina. Brast, it seems, just
walked off the set, causing a restructuring
of the film's plot, making her less central
and much reshooting.
Lest the casual hardcore fan think all
porn actors and actresses are that
temperamental such is not the case. Ken
Turner, who plays seven-foot Fluti, the
auto-fellator and one-man Sodom police
force, is a genial 42-year-old who once was a
merchant seaman.
Tyler Reynolds, who portrays the human
astronaut, was a a football player at the
University of Colorado. Jacquie Brody,
Lot's wife, is a graduate of UC Berkeley and

a USF law school dropout.
Even the players with lesser roles look
like they're having a good time, and the
genial, let's-do-it-for-laughs quality comes
across through almost all of Sodom and
Gomorrah's 90-minute running time.
The one serious "message" that the
Mitchell brothers wanted to get across, is
unfortunately largely lost in the plethora of
comedy and couplings. Sodom was
destroyed, the brothers maintain, not for its
sexual excesses, but for its hypocrisy.
The punishments for "crimes against
Anu," i.e., sexual intercourse in the usual
way, were disgusting and horrible, but
occupy only a few seconds of screen time.
Such a dark and morbid subject would
have been out of synch with the tone of the
rest of the film, so Sodom and Gomorrah
has become a $600,000 comedy melodrama
about a town that everyone knew would get
it in the end.
