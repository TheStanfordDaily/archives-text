Organizers of a Campus Green
tropical plant exhibit and sale are
inviting students to step into a garden
of earthly delights today through
Saturday at the Women's Clubhouse
and Tresidder Union front patio.
More than 4,000 plants will be
displayed, including ferns, crotons,
palms, schefflera, philodendron and
dracena. Sponsors also say that many
different sizes of plants, ranging from
terrarium varieties to decorator house
plants, will be available.
