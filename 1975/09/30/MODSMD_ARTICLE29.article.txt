House demands information
WASHINGTON — The Select House Intelligence
Committee lined up yesterday in favor of taking its fight
for secret information to the full House.
"I do think it is time Congress took a stand," said
Chairman Otis Pike (D-N.Y.). "And it is time Congress
said we need these pieces of information."
Among the issues is whether the committee could have
the names of secret agents which it requests.
All six Democrats present at a committee meeting
declared their support for a resolution by which the full
House would brand defiance of committee subpoenas "a
grave matter requiring appropriate enforcement."
Pike has said the enforcement could be contempt of
Congress citations against possibly Central Intelligence
Director William Colby or Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger. All three Republicans present at a morning
meeting urged more negotiations to work out a
compromise with Ford and avoid the constitutional
confrontation over access to information.
U.S.-Spanish relations to continue
MADRID, Spain — The government of Gen. Francisco
Franco, defying international protests over the execution
of five terrorists, will place Spain's two top guerrillas on
trial for their lives within a few days, defense legal sources
said yesterday.
President Ford, through a spokesman in Washington,
expressed regret at the "cycle of violence" in Spain. But
White House spokesman Ron Nessen said there were no
plans to join the dozen or more governments that have
recalled their ambassadors to Spain.
UFW organizing upheld
WASHINGTON - Justice William O. Douglas
yesterday let stand a lower court order permitting union
organizers to enter California farm fields to talk to
workers.
The justice denied a stay sought by two California
agricultural firms of a three-judge federal court's decision
allowing a restraining order against such activity to expire.
Six United Farm Workers (UFW) organizers were

arrested yesterday for trespassing on the Pandol ranch,
operated by Jack Pandol, a member of the state Board of
Food and Agriculture.
Meanwhile, the latest Associated Press tally of
election results shows the Teamsters winning at 77
ranches covering 9100 workers and the UFW at 68
ranches covering 9500 workers.
Mental hospitals: 'Medieval'
WASHINGTON — A former mental patient whose legal
pleas resulted in a landmark Supreme Court decision said
yesterday that medieval conditions continue to exist in
some public mental hospitals.
Kenneth Donaldson said that at the Florida State
Hospital in Chattahoochee, where he was held for 15
years, doctors failed to identify the mentally ill,
medication was distributed indiscriminantly and patients
were beaten by attendants.
Donaldson testified before the Senate subcommittee
on aging, which is examing the needs and treatment of
elderly patients in mental health facilities.
—"My doctor for 10 years, who for a two-year period
was the only doctor of 1,300 men, was licensed by the
state only as an obstetrician.
—"Medication was given indiscriminately by doctors to
patients who sometimes were not seen by a doctor for
months, even years.
"Senior citizens continue to be beaten up,
overmedicated, and unjustly restrained in the back wards
of state hospitals all over the country," Donaldson said.
"Hospital officials say that these medieval conditions no
longer exist, but the continuing line of reports from
patients tells otherwise."
