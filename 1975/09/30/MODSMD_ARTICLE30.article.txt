# Rabbi seeks to unify Jews
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Rabbi Mark Cartun sees himself as a "catalyst" in
organizing the Jewish community here in his new position
as Hillel director.
"I will try to catalyze events — whether gastronomic,
religious, cultural or educational," he said. "I see that as
the role of the modern rabbi."
Cartun, 26, was ordained last June after studying at the
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. He speaks through a
thick red beard about his plans for the University's Jewish
community.
He said he applied to work here because "I wanted to
be in a place with a large active Jewish congregation. I
liked this Hillel the best."
The notion of a Jewish theme house on campus appeals
to Cartun. "If Jews are interested in organizing a theme
house, I'll help them out," he said. "With any minority
group there exists concepts of embracing a heritage or
amalgamating it into the culture. You have to strike a
balance between the two."
'Simchas Torah'
Cartun began work as Hillel director this summer, and
he has already conducted a "Simchas Torah" celebration
on the day before registration. "Simchas Torah" is the
day where one reading of the Torah is completed and
another is begun.
"Now it ['Simchas Torah'] is the day that Soviet Jews
have chosen to come out of the woodwork to protest," he
says. "So Soviet Jews congregate around the synagogues.
'Simchas Torah' has become a symbol of solidarity with
Soviet Jewry."
Apart from observance of Jewish holidays, Cartun will

continue to hold regular lox and bagel brunches. He also
plans a new addition to Jewish activities — a Sunday night
delicatessen — "Where eating will be the main attraction,"
he says.
Cartun said his style differs from that of his
predecessor, Rabbi Charles Familant. "Familant is
excellent as a counselor, but I am better as a community
organizer and educator," Cartun explained.
'Different' year
Cartun insists that "things will be different this year
because I'm a different person [than Familant]. I want to
involve Stanford Hillel in the whole Bay Area Jewish
community. I'll be looking for students and faculty to
work in community boards."
But Cartun does not intend to confine himself to
community boards and get-togethers. He will also teach
courses out of the Hillel.
One priority, he said, is to teach biblical Hebrew (as
opposed to modern Hebrew). In addition, he will teach an
introductory course in Talmud, the body of Jewish civil
and canonical law.
The study of Jewish-Christian dialogue or polemics is a
major concern of Cartun's. "I've studied 200 years of
these polemics and neither the Jews nor the Christians
have ever listened to the other," he said.
Cartun says he is a "liberal" Jew — one who seeks to
interpret and change certain aspects of Judaism.
"I'm a reform Jew theologically, but I love symbolism
and ritual in life, so I'm more prone to ritualism than
most reform Jews," he said. "I call myself liberal because
there is no contradiction in terms."

organizer and educator," Cartun explained.
'Different' year
Cartun insists that "things will be different this year
because I'm a different person [than Familant]. I want to
involve Stanford Hillel in the whole Bay Area Jewish
community. I'll be looking for students and faculty to
work in community boards."
But Cartun does not intend to confine himself to
community boards and get-togethers. He will also teach
courses out of the Hillel.
One priority, he said, is to teach biblical Hebrew (as
opposed to modern Hebrew). In addition, he will teach an
introductory course in Talmud, the body of Jewish civil
and canonical law.
The study of Jewish-Christian dialogue or polemics is a
major concern of Cartun's. "I've studied 200 years of
these polemics and neither the Jews nor the Christians
have ever listened to the other," he said.
Cartun says he is a "liberal" Jew — one who seeks to
interpret and change certain aspects of Judaism.
"I'm a reform Jew theologically, but I love symbolism
and ritual in life, so I'm more prone to ritualism than
most reform Jews," he said. "I call myself liberal because
there is no contradiction in terms."
Rabbi Mark Cartun sees himself as a "catalyst" in
organizing the Jewish community here in his new position
as Hillel director.
"I will try to catalyze events — whether gastronomic,
religious, cultural or educational," he said. "I see that as
the role of the modern rabbi."
Cartun, 26, was ordained last June after studying at the
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. He speaks through a
thick red beard about his plans for the University's Jewish
community.
He said he applied to work here because "I wanted to
be in a place with a large active Jewish congregation. I
liked this Hillel the best."
The notion of a Jewish theme house on campus appeals
to Cartun. "If Jews are interested in organizing a theme
house, I'll help them out," he said. "With any minority
group there exists concepts of embracing a heritage or
amalgamating it into the culture. You have to strike a
balance between the two."
'Simchas Torah'
Cartun began work as Hillel director this summer, and
he has already conducted a "Simchas Torah" celebration
on the day before registration. "Simchas Torah" is the
day where one reading of the Torah is completed and
another is begun.
"Now it ['Simchas Torah'] is the day that Soviet Jews
have chosen to come out of the woodwork to protest," he
says. "So Soviet Jews congregate around the synagogues.
'Simchas Torah' has become a symbol of solidarity with
Soviet Jewry."
Apart from observance of Jewish holidays, Cartun will

continue to hold regular lox and bagel brunches. He also
plans a new addition to Jewish activities — a Sunday night
delicatessen — "Where eating will be the main attraction,"
he says.
Cartun said his style differs from that of his
predecessor, Rabbi Charles Familant. "Familant is
excellent as a counselor, but I am better as a community
organizer and educator," Cartun explained.
