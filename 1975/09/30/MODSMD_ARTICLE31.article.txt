Sweezy speech
Paul Sweezy, noted radical
economist, will speak on the state of
the economy at De Anza College on
Wednesday, Oct. 1, at 8 p.m.
Successful fund drive
Stanford's Professional Journalism
Fellowship program has "gone over
the top" in its $2 million endowment
drive, Lyle M. Nelson, chairman of the
Department of Communication, has
announced.
A $50,000 grant from the Knight
Newspaper Foundation,
supplementing an earlier gift in the
same amount from that group, pushed
a five-year funding campaign over the
$1 million mark. This earned an
equivalent amount from a Ford
Foundation matching grant.
The Stanford program, begun 10
years ago on an experimental basis by
a Ford grant, has thus far provided
fellowships for 201 mid-career
journalists to study for varying periods
of time up to a year here.

Praise for School of Education
Stanford's educational counseling
program was rated in the highest
category — "strong programs" —
among the top 11 graduate schools in
the U.S., in a study recently reported
in the Journal of Counseling
Psychology.
Corrections
Due to incorrect information given
to the Daily from Bank of America,
there was an error in yesterday's
banking story. Bank of America does
offer overdraft protection, up to $100,
to freshmen, upperclassmen and
foreign students, and a Bankamericard
is not necessary for this service.
The man on the left in the picture
labeled "Big Brother Is Watching" on
page nine of yesterday's Daily is not a
security agent. He is Gary Bayer,
assistant dean of developmental law in
the General Secretary's Office.
