# ASSU lowers refrigerator prices
## 
### 
The ASSU has reduced its
refrigerator rental prices, Special
Assistant to the Financial Manager
Tom Fitzgerald announced yesterday.
The new rates, effective yesterday,
are $13.00 per quarter or $35.00 per
year. These new prices are retroactive
and apply to all refrigerators which
have already been rented for either fall
quarter or the entire year.
A private firm is offering
refrigerator rentals at $14.50 per
quarter or $39.00 per year. The ASSU
prices were $15.00 per quarter or
$40.00 per year. Fitzgerals said the
ASSU reduced prices because "the
ASSU's purpose is to serve the
students and we want to give them the
lowest prices around."
The ASSU will soon announce a
date when students can pick up their
rebates. Students can also receive their
rebates when they return their
refrigerators and pick up their $10
damage deposits.
