# University opposes parks plan
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The University opposes the Palo
Alto Planning Commission's proposal
to use Stanford lands as park sites,
according to Robert Augsburger, vice
president for business and finance.
In the first draft of the city's
Comprehensive Plan, the commission
suggested using six land parcels for
future park sites: three in the
Industrial Park, one at Campus Drive
and Bowdoin in the central campus,
Peter Coutts Hill, and Matadero Creek,
at the southeast corner of Page Mill
Road and Foothill Expressway.
Naphtali Knox, Palo Alto planning
director said yesterday the city may
need University land "because we have
no where else to go to find enough
contiguous acres for a park."
In a Sept. 10 letter to the
Commission, Augsburger said that
"Stanford's land policy places primary
emphasis on holding the University's
vacant property open for future
academic needs, and specifically asks
the University's neighbors to refrain
from considering use of the property
for their own requirements.
"In doing so, the University is
foregoing income from these lands,
while continuing to pay taxes, so that
Stanford can retain its natural
amenities and its ability to meet the
educational needs of coming
generations."
Augsburger said the University
would actively oppose the use of any
of the parcels as parks.
Land condemned?
University officials are not certain
whether Palo Alto would have
the authority to condemn the lands
and use them for parks said
Augsburger.
"It is not really clear where Palo
Alto's jurisdiction is," Augsburger
said. "Some of the lands have been
annexed to the city but others haven't.
There is particularly large amount of
doubt about the latter."
Although the draft called five of
the six potential park sites "poorly
located," it said that the Matadero
Creek site "could be developed into an
excellent district park."
But Knox said that even the
Matadero site might not be tapped by
Palo Alto for a park.
"My hunch is that city residents
will want small, scattered

neighborhood parks not on Stanford
land rather than the larger district
parks that would have to be built on
University land."
Unlike neighborhood parks, district
parks contain libraries and tennis
courts, he said.
According to Knox, however, the
city might want to build one more
district park in order to serve westside
residents.
He said that the city's three existing
district parks, Rinconada, Mitchell and
Greer, all are located on the east side.

Knox said he doubted if Palo Alto's
decision to use University land for
parks would create a major conflict
between Stanford and Palo Alto.
"Twenty acres out of the
University's 8000 aren't an awful lot
of land," Knox said. "The University
could give up the land and still have a
lot left."
But Augsburger yesterday said that
all University land should be exempt
from annexation by Palo Alto "since
we are a special, unique case. Our land
is not used for commercial or

profit-making purposes."
Knox acknowledged that the
University's fear about losing lands
that might later be needed for
academic purposes is a legitimate
concern.
"The University has a good point,"
he said. "If it can make a strong case
against using the lands for parks, we
will consider revising the
comprehensive plan to omit proposals
for parks on Stanford land."

generations."
Augsburger said the University
would actively oppose the use of any
of the parcels as parks.
Land condemned?
University officials are not certain
whether Palo Alto would have
the authority to condemn the lands
and use them for parks said
Augsburger.
"It is not really clear where Palo
Alto's jurisdiction is," Augsburger
said. "Some of the lands have been
annexed to the city but others haven't.
There is particularly large amount of
doubt about the latter."
Although the draft called five of
the six potential park sites "poorly
located," it said that the Matadero
Creek site "could be developed into an
excellent district park."
But Knox said that even the
Matadero site might not be tapped by
Palo Alto for a park.
"My hunch is that city residents
will want small, scattered

neighborhood parks not on Stanford
land rather than the larger district
parks that would have to be built on
University land."
Unlike neighborhood parks, district
parks contain libraries and tennis
courts, he said.
According to Knox, however, the
city might want to build one more
district park in order to serve westside
residents.
He said that the city's three existing
district parks, Rinconada, Mitchell and
Greer, all are located on the east side.

Knox said he doubted if Palo Alto's
decision to use University land for
parks would create a major conflict
between Stanford and Palo Alto.
"Twenty acres out of the
University's 8000 aren't an awful lot
of land," Knox said. "The University
could give up the land and still have a
lot left."
But Augsburger yesterday said that
all University land should be exempt
from annexation by Palo Alto "since
we are a special, unique case. Our land
is not used for commercial or

profit-making purposes."
Knox acknowledged that the
University's fear about losing lands
that might later be needed for
academic purposes is a legitimate
concern.
"The University has a good point,"
he said. "If it can make a strong case
against using the lands for parks, we
will consider revising the
comprehensive plan to omit proposals
for parks on Stanford land."

The University opposes the Palo
Alto Planning Commission's proposal
to use Stanford lands as park sites,
according to Robert Augsburger, vice
president for business and finance.
In the first draft of the city's
Comprehensive Plan, the commission
suggested using six land parcels for
future park sites: three in the
Industrial Park, one at Campus Drive
and Bowdoin in the central campus,
Peter Coutts Hill, and Matadero Creek,
at the southeast corner of Page Mill
Road and Foothill Expressway.
Naphtali Knox, Palo Alto planning
director said yesterday the city may
need University land "because we have
no where else to go to find enough
contiguous acres for a park."
In a Sept. 10 letter to the
Commission, Augsburger said that
"Stanford's land policy places primary
emphasis on holding the University's
vacant property open for future
academic needs, and specifically asks
the University's neighbors to refrain
from considering use of the property
for their own requirements.
"In doing so, the University is
foregoing income from these lands,
while continuing to pay taxes, so that
Stanford can retain its natural
amenities and its ability to meet the
educational needs of coming
generations."
Augsburger said the University
would actively oppose the use of any
of the parcels as parks.
