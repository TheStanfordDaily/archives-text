# Jack Scott:
## 'Patty refused flight' 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Fugitive Patricia Hearst drove
cross-country with Jack Scott, who
said he was willing to take her home,
but she refused, Rolling Stone
magazine reported yesterday,
according to the Associated Press.
"I want to go where my friends
are," the 21-year-old heiress was
quoted as saying in a copyrighted story
about her underground life since her
kidnaping by the Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) in February
1974.
The magazine said Scott, a radical
critic of the sports establishment,
stopped the car and said to her: "I
want you to know that I'm willing to
drive you anywhere you want to go.
You don't have to go to Pennsylvania.
I'll take you anywhere."
She shrank from him and "was
ready to bolt if he turned the car
toward Hillsborough," her family's
home the story said.
The writers, Howard Kohn and
David Weir, said it was based on three

unidentified sources who talked to
Hearst and helped her.
The Hearst portrayed in the
magazine article conflicts with the
Hearst who claimed she was
"brainwashed by the SLA" in her
affidavit to the U.S. District Judge
Oliver J. Carter, many news sources
content)
Sources also questioned the tone of
her affidavit, when U.S. Attorney
James Browning released the transcript
of a conversation in the San Mateo
County Jail between Hearst and
Patricia Tobin, a senior here.
In the conversation, Hearst termed
herself a "revolutionary feminist."
Asked whether she wanted to come
home, Hearst remarked, "Well, what I
want to do is ... I don't want to have
the bail thing where I'm a prisoner in
my parents' home which is possible,
but ... "
Commenting on whether the taped
conversation could affect the trial,
Assoc.Political Science Prof. Jonathan

Casper said, "I don't think so."
He added that "logically it sounds
like it could be damaging; however,
prospective jurors could be asked
whether or not they had heard the
tape in order to eliminate any possible
bias."
Law Prof. John Kaplan said he
found nothing inconsistent in Hearst's
affidavit and the taped conversation.
"To my mind, none of it is
inconsistent," he said. "She changed
her politics â€” big deal. She could have
changed from a conservative
Republican to a liberal Democrat."
Kaplan said the major issue in the
case would be the legality of taping
the conversation in the first place.
Both professors agreed that the
taping of the conversation and using it
as evidence to determine Hearst's
sanity was legal.
"[Taping conversations] is a
common practice. In at least half of
the jails I have visited there's been a
sign saying conversations are being
taped," Casper remarked. "They have
an obligation to notify the prisoner,
however," he added.
Political Science Prof. Robert Horn
remarked, "Conversations between
prisoners have been used as evidence
hundreds and hundreds of times."
Once a person is incarcerated, he
revokes his constitutional rights under
the law, they all said.
Tobin refused to comment on what
she thought of the taping of her
conversation. "I've been harrassed by
the press," she complained.
She claimed that she had not
spoken to any newsmen yet "the press
has been putting words in my mouth,"
by misquoting her in stories.
She said only the press had been
bothering her.
