# Off-campus center moves to Old Union
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Off-campus students can sip sherry, trade stories about the leases they
almost signed or find out about the programs offered by the Off-Campus
Student Center tomorrow when the Center opens its new location with a
sherry hour at 3 p.m.
The Center, started last spring in Tresidder, moved to the first floor of
the Old Union Clubhouse this summer. "The primary reason for moving
the Center was to put all student activities in one location in Tresidder. We
needed the space," Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams
explained.
But Williams said he believes the shift will also help the Center. "We
hustled up the Tresidder location last spring, knowing that it was less than
ideal. There's more space in the clubhouse, and it's more conducive to the
students."
"We will be providing social services of all kinds," Off-Campus Student
Center Coordinator Liane Collins said. "This would include parties,
potluck dinners — we also hope to sponsor a couple of intramural teams.
This would be comparable to the kinds of activities a dorm would offer."
"We'll also have community outreach services," she said. "This would
include things like cooking classes and information on the best places to go
for entertainment."
Off-campus students may leave their belongings in lockers at the center.
"We only have a limited number," Collins said. "If they prove successful,
we may get more.
"We'll be continuing to function as a lounge. There'll be a refrigerator
to store lunches, and the first few weeks we'll be providing hot soup at
noontime. We'll also be subscribing to a couple of newspapers and
magazines," she added.
Funding for the Center comes from the Tresidder Student Affairs
Budgeti Williams said the Center will be receiving $500 carried over from
last year's budget, as well as a salary for the student coordinator.
"Like any other group, the level of operations depends on the ability of
members to generate money themselves," he said.
Collins said she expects the Center to be active this year.
"Last year we started up near the end of the year, when people were
already involved in things. But this year we're reaching a whole new crop
of people who've never lived off-campus before," she said.
"The important thing is that people realize that the Off-Campus Center
isn't there to provide stuff for students," she added. "Hopefully this will
be a student organization, with student task-forces working on things."

HOME AWAY FROM HOME—Off-campus students now have a place where
they may eat, drink, and be merry. The center, located in the Old Union
Clubhouse, will also provide social services that are comparable to dorm
entertainment offerings. It'll even provide lockers where students may store
belongings.

the Old Union Clubhouse this summer. "The primary reason for moving
the Center was to put all student activities in one location in Tresidder. We
needed the space," Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams
explained.
But Williams said he believes the shift will also help the Center. "We
hustled up the Tresidder location last spring, knowing that it was less than
ideal. There's more space in the clubhouse, and it's more conducive to the
students."
"We will be providing social services of all kinds," Off-Campus Student
Center Coordinator Liane Collins said. "This would include parties,
potluck dinners — we also hope to sponsor a couple of intramural teams.
This would be comparable to the kinds of activities a dorm would offer."
"We'll also have community outreach services," she said. "This would
include things like cooking classes and information on the best places to go
for entertainment."
Off-campus students may leave their belongings in lockers at the center.
"We only have a limited number," Collins said. "If they prove successful,
we may get more.
"We'll be continuing to function as a lounge. There'll be a refrigerator
to store lunches, and the first few weeks we'll be providing hot soup at
noontime. We'll also be subscribing to a couple of newspapers and
magazines," she added.
Funding for the Center comes from the Tresidder Student Affairs
Budgeti Williams said the Center will be receiving $500 carried over from
last year's budget, as well as a salary for the student coordinator.
"Like any other group, the level of operations depends on the ability of
members to generate money themselves," he said.
Collins said she expects the Center to be active this year.
"Last year we started up near the end of the year, when people were
already involved in things. But this year we're reaching a whole new crop
of people who've never lived off-campus before," she said.
"The important thing is that people realize that the Off-Campus Center
isn't there to provide stuff for students," she added. "Hopefully this will
be a student organization, with student task-forces working on things."

HOME AWAY FROM HOME—Off-campus students now have a place where
they may eat, drink, and be merry. The center, located in the Old Union
Clubhouse, will also provide social services that are comparable to dorm
entertainment offerings. It'll even provide lockers where students may store
belongings.
Off-campus students can sip sherry, trade stories about the leases they
almost signed or find out about the programs offered by the Off-Campus
Student Center tomorrow when the Center opens its new location with a
sherry hour at 3 p.m.
The Center, started last spring in Tresidder, moved to the first floor of
