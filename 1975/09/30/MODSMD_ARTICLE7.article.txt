# Senior activities
## 
### 
Welcome back, seniors. We've
survived until now, so the last
year should be no sweat. As we
all know, the Senior Class
officers of the recent past have
played a rather minor role
limited mostly to planning
happy hours and
commencement activities (so
we're told).
However, the potential exists
for the officers to work out
some really worthwhile service
activities and a variety of social
events (in addition to happy
hours). It is this potential for
which we campaigned last spring
and would like to achieve this
year.
Over the summer, we began
work on this fall's activities. We
spent a great deal of time on
campus working with
administrators to try and find a
satisfactory commencement
procedure and speaker selection.
Fall activities
Our first activity will be to
sponsor a joint Stanford-UCLA
pre-football game party open to
all students. The Incomparable
LSJUMB will be on hand.
Remember our proposed
Alumni Contact Service (ACS)?
You don't, huh? Anyway, we've
added the faculty into the
program, and thus ACS has
become FACS. Three FACS
programs have been scheduled.
FACS is designed to present
an interdisciplinary program
followed by an informal sherry
hour to promote
student -faculty-alumni,
interaction and discussion of
possible career opportunities.
The first program will
combine engineering, biology
and philosophy; the second,
economics, political science and
sociology; the third, foreign
languages, music and drama.
Of course the quarter
wouldn't be complete without a
happy hour. We've scheduled a
Zot's pre-dead week happy hour
for Dec. 5.
Communication
To facilitate communication,
we plan to have one residence

Spevak, et. al.

representative in each residence
where seniors live. Also, we plan
to put out several newsletters
per quarter. The newsletter
board will be colorfully
prominent in your residence.
And also we have received a desk
in the ASSU Loft. Seniors may
stop by any time with
suggestions, comments or
criticisms. We need input so we
can plan activities wanted by
seniors.
Commencement
Last spring we proposed a
three-step process for choosing
the commencement speaker. The
third step provided for a student
vote to determine the speaker.
Upon presentation to the
administration we received a
definite "no."
Alternate methods proposed
by the administration over the
summer are very similar to the
selection procedure in years past
and we find them unacceptable.
We are continuing to meet with
administrators Robert
Rosenzweig and William Stone.
Hopefully, they will accept our
proposal.
On this matter we really need
senior opinions. How do seniors
think the speaker should be
chosen? Let's tell the
administration how the students
feel before it's too late, as it was
last spring.
We are also working on
returning to departmental
ceremonies for Humanities and
Sciences. The only constraint
here is financial and we are
examining possible changes in
hopes of cutting some costs.
Here things look very favorable.
We hope seniors will return
the commencement speaker
suggestion slips which are in the
first newsletter. Seniors who
would like to be a residence
representative should contact us.
We need more reps. We hope
seniors will find their class
activities worthwhile and fun.

Fiatarone, Greg Smith and Eric
Strandbcrg are this years Senior
Class Officers.)

year.
Over the summer, we began
work on this fall's activities. We
spent a great deal of time on
campus working with
administrators to try and find a
satisfactory commencement
procedure and speaker selection.
Fall activities
Our first activity will be to
sponsor a joint Stanford-UCLA
pre-football game party open to
all students. The Incomparable
LSJUMB will be on hand.
Remember our proposed
Alumni Contact Service (ACS)?
You don't, huh? Anyway, we've
added the faculty into the
program, and thus ACS has
become FACS. Three FACS
programs have been scheduled.
FACS is designed to present
an interdisciplinary program
followed by an informal sherry
hour to promote
student -faculty-alumni,
interaction and discussion of
possible career opportunities.
The first program will
combine engineering, biology
and philosophy; the second,
economics, political science and
sociology; the third, foreign
languages, music and drama.
Of course the quarter
wouldn't be complete without a
happy hour. We've scheduled a
Zot's pre-dead week happy hour
for Dec. 5.
Communication
To facilitate communication,
we plan to have one residence

Spevak, et. al.

representative in each residence
where seniors live. Also, we plan
to put out several newsletters
per quarter. The newsletter
board will be colorfully
prominent in your residence.
And also we have received a desk
in the ASSU Loft. Seniors may
stop by any time with
suggestions, comments or
criticisms. We need input so we
can plan activities wanted by
seniors.
Commencement
Last spring we proposed a
three-step process for choosing
the commencement speaker. The
third step provided for a student
vote to determine the speaker.
Upon presentation to the
administration we received a
definite "no."
Alternate methods proposed
by the administration over the
summer are very similar to the
selection procedure in years past
and we find them unacceptable.
We are continuing to meet with
administrators Robert
Rosenzweig and William Stone.
Hopefully, they will accept our
proposal.
On this matter we really need
senior opinions. How do seniors
think the speaker should be
chosen? Let's tell the
administration how the students
feel before it's too late, as it was
last spring.
We are also working on
returning to departmental
ceremonies for Humanities and
Sciences. The only constraint
here is financial and we are
examining possible changes in
hopes of cutting some costs.
Here things look very favorable.
We hope seniors will return
the commencement speaker
suggestion slips which are in the
first newsletter. Seniors who
would like to be a residence
representative should contact us.
We need more reps. We hope
seniors will find their class
activities worthwhile and fun.
("Weird Walt" Spevak, Marie
Fiatarone, Greg Smith and Eric
Strandbcrg are this years Senior
Class Officers.)
Welcome back, seniors. We've
survived until now, so the last
year should be no sweat. As we
all know, the Senior Class
officers of the recent past have
played a rather minor role
limited mostly to planning
happy hours and
commencement activities (so
we're told).
However, the potential exists
for the officers to work out
some really worthwhile service
activities and a variety of social
events (in addition to happy
hours). It is this potential for
which we campaigned last spring
and would like to achieve this
year.
