# Reform social security

It is time for all good
economists to begin worrying
about the solvency of the Social
Security system.
The Social Security system
is simply a transferring of money
from one generation to another.
Basically, our generation will
pay a percentage of our income
into the system and benefits will
be received by the older
generation. In like manner, our
generation will receive benefits
from the generation being born
today.
At present, revenue is raised
through an 11.7 percent tax
levied on a maximum of
$14,100 annual earnings which
is split evenly between
employers and employes. This
money is then delegated to some
30 million people qualifying for
retirement and survivor benefits
and to disabled workers and
health insurance.
This system has sustained
itself on the assumption that the
population will continue rising

and that each new generation
will be able to supply more than
sufficient revenue to cover the
less populous older generation.
This seems fine until one
realizes that births are predicted
to decline from the present 1.9
children per child-bearing female
to 1.6 children in the years
ahead.
What this means for those of
us who will be of retirement age
in 40 years is that there will be
less revenue to pay for what
should be higher benefits. But
under the present structure these
benefits will never be realized
and those paying the taxes now
will ultimately be the losers.
That is unless some changes are
examined and instituted.
One change to reduce the
rampant increase in benefits is
to increase future payments to
those working in proportion to a
rise in the individual's earnings
rather than in a general price
level rise.

Revenue should also be
increased by infusing the system
with general tax revenues. Up to
now, the retirement and
disability payments have been
almost entirely financed by the
taxes on employers and
employes. This has been a
burden on the lower-income
worker, and by adding general
revenue to the system, total
revenue would rise without
necessitating a rise in the payroll
tax.
General revenue financing
may be the only way to sustain
the system, much to the
discontent of conservatives.
With general revenue
financing, a reduction in the
increase in benefits by allotting
increases based on wage rates
rather than prices and including
capital income in the tax, the
Social Security system's future
looks a lot brighter.
