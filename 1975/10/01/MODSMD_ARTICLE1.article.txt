## Patty scrutinized for 'abnormalities' 
### STEVE HEFTER 
Patricia Hearst underwent physical
and neurological examinations at
Stanford's Medical Center yesterday
and Monday as part of a series of
court-ordered tests.
Hearst completed over seven hours
of testing here at about 12:30
yesterday afternoon.
She appeared frail and dazed but,
while driving away from the hospital,
she cracked a brief smile to Daily
reporters.
According to Medical Center
spokesman Spyros Andreopoulos,
yesterday's tests completed Hearst's
examinations at Stanford.
Andreopoulos said Hearst began
examinations here Monday when she
was under observation from 1 to 4
p.m.
He said she returned at about 8
a.m. yesterday, accompanied by one
of her lawyers, John Knutsen, for
further physical and neurological
exams.
The examinations, according to
Andreopoulos, included an
electroencephalogram test to

determine if any abnormalities were
present in the central nervous system.
Hearst was also given a complete
physical examination, including chest
x-rays.
Andreopoulos noted, however, that
according to Knutsen, a scheduled
psychiatric test was not administered.
"The psychiatric exams can be
done elsewhere," Andreopoulos noted.
"The neurological exams were done
here because the needed equipment is
available and because of Dr. [Donald]
Lunde's association with the case."
Lunde, a Stanford associate
psychiatry professor, is one of three
psychiatrists appointed to examine
Hearst. But according to Paul
Hofmann, Stanford Hospital
administrative director, Lunde was not
one of the doctors examining Hearst
yesterday.
According to Hofmann and
Andreopoulos, the doctors examining
Hearst were Clinical Assoc. Prof.
William Fowkes, a specialist in internal
medicine, and Assoc. Neurology Prof.
Barry Tharp. Neither doctor would
comment on the case.

According to the Associated Press,
the results of the examinations will
not be presented in court until next
Tuesday.
Security at the Medical Center was
provided by federal marshals and
hospital police who requested that the
press stay out of patient care areas.
Many hospital staff members and
patients waited up to two hours to see
Hearst.
The hospital's main concern,
according to Hofmann, was not to
disturb usual hospital care.
In the meantime, Hearst's lawyers
revealed for the first time that the
newspaper heiress is not cooperating in
her defense.
The Associated Press reported last
night that a specialist in legal
psychiatry said Hearst might well find
the court-ordered mental examinations
unnerving, since they are designed to
expose her underlying feelings.
Lawyers Terence Hallinan and
Knutson said Patty is "vacillating in
her attitude toward her parents and
lawyers," and is impatient with
discussions of her legal case.
