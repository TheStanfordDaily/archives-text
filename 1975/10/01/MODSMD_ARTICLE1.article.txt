## Patty scrutinized for 'abnormalities' 
### STEVE HEFTER 
Patricia Hearst underwent physical
and neurological examinations at
Stanford's Medical Center yesterday
and Monday as part of a series of
court-ordered tests.
Hearst completed over seven hours
of testing here at about 12:30
yesterday afternoon.
She appeared frail and dazed but,
while driving away from the hospital,
she cracked a brief smile to Daily
reporters.
According to Medical Center
spokesman Spyros Andreopoulos,
yesterday's tests completed Hearst's
examinations at Stanford.
Andreopoulos said Hearst began
examinations here Monday when she
was under observation from 1 to 4
p.m.
He said she returned at about 8
a.m. yesterday, accompanied by one
of her lawyers, John Knutsen, for
further physical and neurological
exams.
The examinations, according to
Andreopoulos, included an
electroencephalogram test to

determine if any abnormalities were
present in the central nervous system.
Hearst was also given a complete
physical examination, including chest
x-rays.
Andreopoulos noted, however, that
according to Knutsen, a scheduled
psychiatric test was not administered.
"The psychiatric exams can be
done elsewhere," Andreopoulos noted.
"The neurological exams were done
here because the needed equipment is
available and because of Dr. [Donald]
Lunde's association with the case."
Lunde, a Stanford associate
psychiatry professor, is one of three
psychiatrists appointed to examine
Hearst. But according to Paul
Hofmann, Stanford Hospital
administrative director, Lunde was not
one of the doctors examining Hearst
yesterday.
According to Hofmann and
Andreopoulos, the doctors examining
Hearst were Clinical Assoc. Prof.
William Fowkes, a specialist in internal
medicine, and Assoc. Neurology Prof.
Barry Tharp. Neither doctor would
comment on the case.

According to the Associated Press,
the results of the examinations will
not be presented in court until next
Tuesday.
Security at the Medical Center was
provided by federal marshals and
hospital police who requested that the
press stay out of patient care areas.
Many hospital staff members and
patients waited up to two hours to see
Hearst.
The hospital's main concern,
according to Hofmann, was not to
disturb usual hospital care.
In the meantime, Hearst's lawyers
revealed for the first time that the
newspaper heiress is not cooperating in
her defense.
The Associated Press reported last
night that a specialist in legal
psychiatry said Hearst might well find
the court-ordered mental examinations
unnerving, since they are designed to
expose her underlying feelings.
Lawyers Terence Hallinan and
Knutson said Patty is "vacillating in
her attitude toward her parents and
lawyers," and is impatient with
discussions of her legal case.
She breaks into tears if asked about
her adventures with the Symbionese
Liberation Army and refuses to discuss
her underground life, the attorneys
said in a statement filed with U.S.
District Court Judge Oliver J. Carter.
In the document, labeled "a
preliminary statement of our concept
of Patty Hearst's mental and
emotional condition," the attorneys
also said they believe Hearst may be
on the verge of "a nervous
breakdown."
Her lawyers said in their statement
that during jailhouse discussions,
Hearst "appeared disorganized, flat
and listless in her account and
vacillating in her attitude toward her
parents and lawyers involved in the
case.
No idea
"She seemed to have no idea of the
gravity of her position and listened
with obvious impatience to any
discussion of the proceedings to be
taken in it," they said.
"She would sometimes sit for
several minutes staring straight ahead,
ignoring questions that were put to
her, even when they were repeated
several times," the lawyers reported.
At a brief in-chambers meeting, F.
Lee Bailey, who is taking over as
Hearst's chief attorney, was
introduced to Carter.
Dr. Michael Coburn, who
specializes in legal psychiatry, said the
tests Patty is taking are "designed to
uncover underlying conflicts, to get
beneath the conscious levels.
Texts expose feelings
"The projective tests expose one to
his or her own feelings, more or less,
and could be productive of a lot of
discomfort or potential
decomposition," said Coburn. He
studied under Dr. Seymour Pollock,
director of the Institute of Psychiatry
and Law at USC and one of the

psychiatrists appointed to examine
Patty.
Hallinan had said earlier that a
"really heavy afternoon" of testing
over the weekend "took a terrible
toll" on Hearst and made doctors
fearful she might attempt suicide if
left in jail. He asked Judge Carter to
let her be moved to a hospital.
Hallinan said one of the rooms at
the jail where Hearst was interviewed
by a psychologist contained a
television camera.
Coburn said the presence of such a
camera during psychological testing
could be very destructive. "You don't
undress when the door's open," he
said. "A psychological interview is like
being undressed."
No defense attorney was present
for the earlier tests, but one of Patty's
attorneys was with her yesterday "to
tell her it is okay to go ahead with the
physical, because she had some
apprehension yesterday," a federal
marshal said.

present in the central nervous system.
Hearst was also given a complete
physical examination, including chest
x-rays.
Andreopoulos noted, however, that
according to Knutsen, a scheduled
psychiatric test was not administered.
"The psychiatric exams can be
done elsewhere," Andreopoulos noted.
"The neurological exams were done
here because the needed equipment is
available and because of Dr. [Donald]
Lunde's association with the case."
Lunde, a Stanford associate
psychiatry professor, is one of three
psychiatrists appointed to examine
Hearst. But according to Paul
Hofmann, Stanford Hospital
administrative director, Lunde was not
one of the doctors examining Hearst
yesterday.
According to Hofmann and
Andreopoulos, the doctors examining
Hearst were Clinical Assoc. Prof.
William Fowkes, a specialist in internal
medicine, and Assoc. Neurology Prof.
Barry Tharp. Neither doctor would
comment on the case.

According to the Associated Press,
the results of the examinations will
not be presented in court until next
Tuesday.
Security at the Medical Center was
provided by federal marshals and
hospital police who requested that the
press stay out of patient care areas.
Many hospital staff members and
patients waited up to two hours to see
Hearst.
The hospital's main concern,
according to Hofmann, was not to
disturb usual hospital care.
In the meantime, Hearst's lawyers
revealed for the first time that the
newspaper heiress is not cooperating in
her defense.
The Associated Press reported last
night that a specialist in legal
psychiatry said Hearst might well find
the court-ordered mental examinations
unnerving, since they are designed to
expose her underlying feelings.
Lawyers Terence Hallinan and
Knutson said Patty is "vacillating in
her attitude toward her parents and
lawyers," and is impatient with
discussions of her legal case.
She breaks into tears if asked about
her adventures with the Symbionese
Liberation Army and refuses to discuss
her underground life, the attorneys
said in a statement filed with U.S.
District Court Judge Oliver J. Carter.
In the document, labeled "a
preliminary statement of our concept
of Patty Hearst's mental and
emotional condition," the attorneys
also said they believe Hearst may be
on the verge of "a nervous
breakdown."
Her lawyers said in their statement
that during jailhouse discussions,
Hearst "appeared disorganized, flat
and listless in her account and
vacillating in her attitude toward her
parents and lawyers involved in the
case.
No idea
"She seemed to have no idea of the
gravity of her position and listened
with obvious impatience to any
discussion of the proceedings to be
taken in it," they said.
"She would sometimes sit for
several minutes staring straight ahead,
ignoring questions that were put to
her, even when they were repeated
several times," the lawyers reported.
At a brief in-chambers meeting, F.
Lee Bailey, who is taking over as
Hearst's chief attorney, was
introduced to Carter.
Dr. Michael Coburn, who
specializes in legal psychiatry, said the
tests Patty is taking are "designed to
uncover underlying conflicts, to get
beneath the conscious levels.
Texts expose feelings
"The projective tests expose one to
his or her own feelings, more or less,
and could be productive of a lot of
discomfort or potential
decomposition," said Coburn. He
studied under Dr. Seymour Pollock,
director of the Institute of Psychiatry
and Law at USC and one of the

psychiatrists appointed to examine
Patty.
Hallinan had said earlier that a
"really heavy afternoon" of testing
over the weekend "took a terrible
toll" on Hearst and made doctors
fearful she might attempt suicide if
left in jail. He asked Judge Carter to
let her be moved to a hospital.
Hallinan said one of the rooms at
the jail where Hearst was interviewed
by a psychologist contained a
television camera.
Coburn said the presence of such a
camera during psychological testing
could be very destructive. "You don't
undress when the door's open," he
said. "A psychological interview is like
being undressed."
No defense attorney was present
for the earlier tests, but one of Patty's
attorneys was with her yesterday "to
tell her it is okay to go ahead with the
physical, because she had some
apprehension yesterday," a federal
marshal said.
Patricia Hearst underwent physical
and neurological examinations at
Stanford's Medical Center yesterday
and Monday as part of a series of
court-ordered tests.
Hearst completed over seven hours
of testing here at about 12:30
yesterday afternoon.
She appeared frail and dazed but,
while driving away from the hospital,
she cracked a brief smile to Daily
reporters.
According to Medical Center
spokesman Spyros Andreopoulos,
yesterday's tests completed Hearst's
examinations at Stanford.
Andreopoulos said Hearst began
examinations here Monday when she
was under observation from 1 to 4
p.m.
He said she returned at about 8
a.m. yesterday, accompanied by one
of her lawyers, John Knutsen, for
further physical and neurological
exams.

the results of the examinations will
not be presented in court until next
Tuesday.
Security at the Medical Center was
provided by federal marshals and
hospital police who requested that the
press stay out of patient care areas.
Many hospital staff members and
patients waited up to two hours to see
Hearst.
The hospital's main concern,
according to Hofmann, was not to
disturb usual hospital care.
In the meantime, Hearst's lawyers
revealed for the first time that the
newspaper heiress is not cooperating in
her defense.
The Associated Press reported last
night that a specialist in legal
psychiatry said Hearst might well find
the court-ordered mental examinations
unnerving, since they are designed to
expose her underlying feelings.
Lawyers Terence Hallinan and
Knutson said Patty is "vacillating in
her attitude toward her parents and
lawyers," and is impatient with
discussions of her legal case.
She breaks into tears if asked about
her adventures with the Symbionese
Liberation Army and refuses to discuss
her underground life, the attorneys
said in a statement filed with U.S.
District Court Judge Oliver J. Carter.
In the document, labeled "a
preliminary statement of our concept
of Patty Hearst's mental and
emotional condition," the attorneys
also said they believe Hearst may be
on the verge of "a nervous
breakdown."
Her lawyers said in their statement
that during jailhouse discussions,
Hearst "appeared disorganized, flat
and listless in her account and
vacillating in her attitude toward her
parents and lawyers involved in the
case.
No idea
"She seemed to have no idea of the
gravity of her position and listened
with obvious impatience to any
discussion of the proceedings to be
taken in it," they said.
"She would sometimes sit for
several minutes staring straight ahead,
ignoring questions that were put to
her, even when they were repeated
several times," the lawyers reported.
At a brief in-chambers meeting, F.
Lee Bailey, who is taking over as
Hearst's chief attorney, was
introduced to Carter.
Dr. Michael Coburn, who
specializes in legal psychiatry, said the
tests Patty is taking are "designed to
uncover underlying conflicts, to get
beneath the conscious levels.
Texts expose feelings
"The projective tests expose one to
his or her own feelings, more or less,
and could be productive of a lot of
discomfort or potential
decomposition," said Coburn. He
studied under Dr. Seymour Pollock,
director of the Institute of Psychiatry
and Law at USC and one of the

psychiatrists appointed to examine
Patty.
Hallinan had said earlier that a
"really heavy afternoon" of testing
over the weekend "took a terrible
toll" on Hearst and made doctors
fearful she might attempt suicide if
left in jail. He asked Judge Carter to
let her be moved to a hospital.
Hallinan said one of the rooms at
the jail where Hearst was interviewed
by a psychologist contained a
television camera.
Coburn said the presence of such a
camera during psychological testing
could be very destructive. "You don't
undress when the door's open," he
said. "A psychological interview is like
being undressed."
No defense attorney was present
for the earlier tests, but one of Patty's
attorneys was with her yesterday "to
tell her it is okay to go ahead with the
physical, because she had some
apprehension yesterday," a federal
marshal said.
Patricia Hearst underwent physical
and neurological examinations at
Stanford's Medical Center yesterday
and Monday as part of a series of
court-ordered tests.
Hearst completed over seven hours
of testing here at about 12:30
yesterday afternoon.
She appeared frail and dazed but,
while driving away from the hospital,
she cracked a brief smile to Daily
reporters.
According to Medical Center
spokesman Spyros Andreopoulos,
yesterday's tests completed Hearst's
examinations at Stanford.
Andreopoulos said Hearst began
examinations here Monday when she
was under observation from 1 to 4
p.m.
He said she returned at about 8
a.m. yesterday, accompanied by one
of her lawyers, John Knutsen, for
further physical and neurological
exams.
The examinations, according to
Andreopoulos, included an
electroencephalogram test to

determine if any abnormalities were
present in the central nervous system.
Hearst was also given a complete
physical examination, including chest
x-rays.
Andreopoulos noted, however, that
according to Knutsen, a scheduled
psychiatric test was not administered.
"The psychiatric exams can be
done elsewhere," Andreopoulos noted.
"The neurological exams were done
here because the needed equipment is
available and because of Dr. [Donald]
Lunde's association with the case."
Lunde, a Stanford associate
psychiatry professor, is one of three
psychiatrists appointed to examine
Hearst. But according to Paul
Hofmann, Stanford Hospital
administrative director, Lunde was not
one of the doctors examining Hearst
yesterday.
According to Hofmann and
Andreopoulos, the doctors examining
Hearst were Clinical Assoc. Prof.
William Fowkes, a specialist in internal
medicine, and Assoc. Neurology Prof.
Barry Tharp. Neither doctor would
comment on the case.
