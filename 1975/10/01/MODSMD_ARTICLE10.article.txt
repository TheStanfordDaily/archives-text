# Non-smokers of the world, unite!

### Terry Anzur 
Warning: The Surgeon
General has determined that
cigarette smoking is dangerous
to your health.
And in Minnesota, it also may
be dangerous to your wallet.
Under the 1975 Minnesota
Clean Indoor Air Act, passed in
May, a smoker who lights up in
the wrong place can be fined up
to $100. No one has been
arrested under the law yet,
authorities say, but where

there's smoke there usually is
trouble.
Although other states have
antismoking laws, the Minnesota
statute is said to be the toughest.
It is notable for its sweeping
recognition of a non-smoker's
right to breath smoke-free air in
"any enclosed, indoor area used
by the general public." That
includes retail stores, offices,
public transportation,
educational facilities, hospitals,

nursing homes, auditoriums,
arenas, meeting rooms and
restaurants.
Just as a crime suspect
theoretically is presumed
innocent until proven guilty,
these areas are presumed to be
no-smoking zones unless they
legally can be designated
otherwise.
The law provides such
exceptions for bars, and private
work areas and meeting rooms.
The exceptions, some people
say, also are loopholes.
A bar, for example, may be
designated in its entirety as a
smoking area, under the
Minnesota law. Restaurants,
however, are required to provide
separate seating for smokers and
non-smokers and make all
reasonable efforts to keep
non-smoking customers from
breathing stray second-hand
smoke. Some restaurants have
shirked this requirement by
hoisting their wine and liquor
licenses and calling themselves
bars.
Leaders of the Minnesota
Association for Non-Smokers
Rights, which helped push the
measure through the Legislature,
have urged hearings and
amendments on such
ambiguities. If the loophole is
closed, restaurant proprietors
may be forced to follow the
letter of the law, but not its
spirit. One restauranteur
reportedly vowed to comply by
"setting two chairs outside for
non-smokers."
If you're waiting for
California to pass such a law,
don't hold your breath. George
Thacher, an attorney for the city
of Palo Alto, says that a state
antismoking law doesn't exist. A
municipality, left to its
own devices, does nothing. And as
Â° r esult, smoking habits seem to
have overrun any non-smokers'
rights that may exist.
Partially in response to the
demands of anti-smoking groups,
Palo Alto recently passed a

smoking ordinance which
prohibits smoking in theaters
(hut not in theater lobbies), in
elevators and in public meetings
where public business is being
discussed, Thacher said.
The penalty for a first
infraction is $50, $100 for a
second offense and $250 for a
third offense within a year.
While this may bring city politics
out of the smoke-filled room, it
leaves non-smokers in most
situations out of luck.

If unwanted smoke gets in
your eyes, you might clear the
air by telling the source of the
fumes about some of the
findings of Dr. Jesse Steinfeld,
former U.S. surgeon general.
According to his research, high
carbon-monoxide levels in
smoke-filled rooms and cars may
"lead to serious impairment of
health in non-smokers with
certain heart or lung
conditions."
He also noted that many of
the 20 million Americans with
allergies and a large number of
nonallergic non-smokers suffer
headaches, eye irritation, nasal
symptons, coughing and
wheezing after exposure to
tobacco smoke. Another study
showed that respiratory ailments
occur twice as often among
children of smokers.
If your presentation doesn't
work, you could escape to the
nearest elevator, movie theater
or city council meeting. Or you
could move to Minnesota.
