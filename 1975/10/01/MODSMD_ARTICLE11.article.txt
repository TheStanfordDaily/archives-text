## A 						chip off the old Douglas 'Streets' Inspector Keller has it made 
### GRANT WINTHROP 
"Hold it right there, Eddie!
Drop the gun. Don't do it,
Eddie!" shouts the young
plainclothes police officer
crouched behind a battered
pick-up truck. His Smith and
Wesson .38 caliber police special
is aimed at an armed man fleeing
down the sidewalk.
Eddie, a modishly dressed
black man, runs on, ignoring the
policeman's orders. Without a
flinch, the cop squeezes off two
shots, dropping Eddie to the
sidewalk, where he writhes in
pain under the warm autumn
sun in San Francisco.
Cautiously, the policeman
emerges from behind the truck
and approaches the fallen
fugitive. He reaches down and
picks up Eddie's gun, as a black
and white squad car, lights
flashing, arrives on the scene.
"O.K. Print it!" shouts a

voice from somewhere behind
the maze of lights, sound
equipment, cameras and other
apparatus that has been
marshalled outside the St.
Francis Yacht Club, to record
on film the apprehension of
Eddie by Inspector Steve Keller
of the San Francisco Police
Department.
Inspector Keller exists only
while the cameras are rolling. In
reality, the handsome, boyish
face and the trim. Ivy League
suits belong to Michael Douglas,
co-star of the popular ABC
television series, The Streets of
San Francisco.
Best dressed cop
Probably the best dressed cop
on television, Douglas looks
more like a young lawyer or
stock broker than an actor. He
admits that, in spite of the
influence of his famous father,
Kirk Douglas, he never

considered becoming an actor
until his second year at the
University of California at Santa
Barbara. And even then, his
interest in acting was only
casual.
"I was supposed to go to
Yale,"says Douglas, "but after
four years at Choate, the idea of
California sun and beautiful girls
in bikinis seemed more attractive
than Ivy covered halls."
Douglas' acting career
blossomed during his last two
years in college. After
graduation he moved back to
New York to study drama and
to appear in several
off-Broadway productions. His
theater activity soon led him to
television guest-star roles and,
three years ago, to a permanent
job on Streets.
"Acting is a lot more work
and a lot less glamorous than
people think," says Douglas,

who doesn't hide his disgust
after doing the same scene over
and over again all morning. "I'll
be glad when the shooting
season is over."
Douglas is pandid about the
quality of most prime-time TV
shows, including his own.
'Streets' limiting
"I enjoy doing Streets," says
Douglas. "The money is good,
and it's good recognition. But I
don't want it to go forever. It's
kind of limiting. I mean, when
you have to crank out 40 shows
a year, how good can it be?"
But Douglas thinks Streets is
a cut or two above the average
cops and robbers TV show. He
attributes this to his co-star, Karl
Maiden, the veteran actor who
portrays Lt. Mike Stone.
Maiden is cast in a father
relationship to Douglas, and this
relationship exists off-camera as
well.
"At first, we were not sure
how to play the relationship
between Lt. Stone and Inspector
Keller," says Assoc. Producer
Ken Swor. "But Mike and Karl
developed this relationship
off-camera and we try to go with
it on-camera, too. Mike didn't
have a lot of experience when
the show started out, but he's
come a long way, and he's
learned fast."
Informal atmosphere
Success as a TV star has not
affected Douglas. He is friendly,
relaxed and casual, and tends to
play down his celebrity status.
The atmosphere on the set of
Streets is informal, if hectic, and
Douglas contributes to it by

clowning around with the crew
and other actors between takes.
Robert Feero, a struggling
Bay Area actor who sometimes
works as an extra on the show
says, "Michael has success
written all over him. I mean, he's
got a famous father, he's got
money and he's got it made as
far as acting goes. But he's a
great guy — he always has time
for every one. Hell, I'm jealous
of him, but I like him."
Douglas does not like to talk
about his work on Streets for

long. Though he won't admit it in
so many words, he is bored by
the series, especially near the
end of the shooting season. He
says his real interest lies in his
current project — producing the
film of Ken Kesey's One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest, for
which Douglas owns the screen
rights.
"It's really going to be good,"
says Douglas of the film. "We've
got Jack Nicholson playing
McMurphy, and a great
supporting cast. I'll be going full

time with it as soon as we're
through up here."
A voice calling, "Michael
Douglas, Michael Douglas on the
set, please," cuts Douglas of fin
his enthusiastic discussion of his
film. For the next hour he will
go through the motions of
arresting one of Eddie's
colleagues in crime — a two
minute scene by the time it gets
on the air. It's one of those
times when Michael Douglas
would rather be behind the
camera than in front of it.

and over again all morning. "I'll
be glad when the shooting
season is over."
Douglas is pandid about the
quality of most prime-time TV
shows, including his own.
'Streets' limiting
"I enjoy doing Streets," says
Douglas. "The money is good,
and it's good recognition. But I
don't want it to go forever. It's
kind of limiting. I mean, when
you have to crank out 40 shows
a year, how good can it be?"
But Douglas thinks Streets is
a cut or two above the average
cops and robbers TV show. He
attributes this to his co-star, Karl
Maiden, the veteran actor who
portrays Lt. Mike Stone.
Maiden is cast in a father
relationship to Douglas, and this
relationship exists off-camera as
well.
"At first, we were not sure
how to play the relationship
between Lt. Stone and Inspector
Keller," says Assoc. Producer
Ken Swor. "But Mike and Karl
developed this relationship
off-camera and we try to go with
it on-camera, too. Mike didn't
have a lot of experience when
the show started out, but he's
come a long way, and he's
learned fast."
Informal atmosphere
Success as a TV star has not
affected Douglas. He is friendly,
relaxed and casual, and tends to
play down his celebrity status.
The atmosphere on the set of
Streets is informal, if hectic, and
Douglas contributes to it by

clowning around with the crew
and other actors between takes.
Robert Feero, a struggling
Bay Area actor who sometimes
works as an extra on the show
says, "Michael has success
written all over him. I mean, he's
got a famous father, he's got
money and he's got it made as
far as acting goes. But he's a
great guy — he always has time
for every one. Hell, I'm jealous
of him, but I like him."
Douglas does not like to talk
about his work on Streets for

long. Though he won't admit it in
so many words, he is bored by
the series, especially near the
end of the shooting season. He
says his real interest lies in his
current project — producing the
film of Ken Kesey's One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest, for
which Douglas owns the screen
rights.
"It's really going to be good,"
says Douglas of the film. "We've
got Jack Nicholson playing
McMurphy, and a great
supporting cast. I'll be going full

time with it as soon as we're
through up here."
A voice calling, "Michael
Douglas, Michael Douglas on the
set, please," cuts Douglas of fin
his enthusiastic discussion of his
film. For the next hour he will
go through the motions of
arresting one of Eddie's
colleagues in crime — a two
minute scene by the time it gets
on the air. It's one of those
times when Michael Douglas
would rather be behind the
camera than in front of it.

OFF THE STREETS—Co-stars Michael Douglas and Karl Maiden pause between shooting scenes for
ABC's Streets of San Francisco. Douglas, son of actor Kirk Douglas, actually never considered
becoming an actor until his second year of college. Now he's involved in one of ABC's most successful
programs and has plans to produce a film of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.
"Hold it right there, Eddie!
Drop the gun. Don't do it,
Eddie!" shouts the young
plainclothes police officer
crouched behind a battered
pick-up truck. His Smith and
Wesson .38 caliber police special
is aimed at an armed man fleeing
down the sidewalk.
Eddie, a modishly dressed
black man, runs on, ignoring the
policeman's orders. Without a
flinch, the cop squeezes off two
shots, dropping Eddie to the
sidewalk, where he writhes in
pain under the warm autumn
sun in San Francisco.
Cautiously, the policeman
emerges from behind the truck
and approaches the fallen
fugitive. He reaches down and
picks up Eddie's gun, as a black
and white squad car, lights
flashing, arrives on the scene.
"O.K. Print it!" shouts a

voice from somewhere behind
the maze of lights, sound
equipment, cameras and other
apparatus that has been
marshalled outside the St.
Francis Yacht Club, to record
on film the apprehension of
Eddie by Inspector Steve Keller
of the San Francisco Police
Department.
Inspector Keller exists only
while the cameras are rolling. In
reality, the handsome, boyish
face and the trim. Ivy League
suits belong to Michael Douglas,
co-star of the popular ABC
television series, The Streets of
San Francisco.
Best dressed cop
Probably the best dressed cop
on television, Douglas looks
more like a young lawyer or
stock broker than an actor. He
admits that, in spite of the
influence of his famous father,
Kirk Douglas, he never

considered becoming an actor
until his second year at the
University of California at Santa
Barbara. And even then, his
interest in acting was only
casual.
"I was supposed to go to
Yale,"says Douglas, "but after
four years at Choate, the idea of
California sun and beautiful girls
in bikinis seemed more attractive
than Ivy covered halls."
Douglas' acting career
blossomed during his last two
years in college. After
graduation he moved back to
New York to study drama and
to appear in several
off-Broadway productions. His
theater activity soon led him to
television guest-star roles and,
three years ago, to a permanent
job on Streets.
"Acting is a lot more work
and a lot less glamorous than
people think," says Douglas,

got Jack Nicholson playing
McMurphy, and a great
supporting cast. I'll be going full

time with it as soon as we're

A voice calling, "Michael
Douglas, Michael Douglas on the
set, please," cuts Douglas of fin
his enthusiastic discussion of his
film. For the next hour he will
go through the motions of
arresting one of Eddie's
colleagues in crime — a two
minute scene by the time it gets

times when Michael Douglas
would rather be behind the

OFF THE STREETS—Co-stars Michael Douglas and Karl Maiden pause between shooting scenes for
ABC's Streets of San Francisco. Douglas, son of actor Kirk Douglas, actually never considered
becoming an actor until his second year of college. Now he's involved in one of ABC's most successful
programs and has plans to produce a film of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.
"Hold it right there, Eddie!
Drop the gun. Don't do it,
Eddie!" shouts the young
plainclothes police officer
crouched behind a battered
pick-up truck. His Smith and
Wesson .38 caliber police special
is aimed at an armed man fleeing
down the sidewalk.
Eddie, a modishly dressed
black man, runs on, ignoring the
policeman's orders. Without a
flinch, the cop squeezes off two
shots, dropping Eddie to the
sidewalk, where he writhes in
pain under the warm autumn
sun in San Francisco.
Cautiously, the policeman
emerges from behind the truck
and approaches the fallen
fugitive. He reaches down and
picks up Eddie's gun, as a black
and white squad car, lights
flashing, arrives on the scene.
"O.K. Print it!" shouts a

voice from somewhere behind
the maze of lights, sound
equipment, cameras and other
apparatus that has been
marshalled outside the St.
Francis Yacht Club, to record
on film the apprehension of
Eddie by Inspector Steve Keller
of the San Francisco Police
Department.
Inspector Keller exists only
while the cameras are rolling. In
reality, the handsome, boyish
face and the trim. Ivy League
suits belong to Michael Douglas,
co-star of the popular ABC
television series, The Streets of
San Francisco.
Best dressed cop
Probably the best dressed cop
on television, Douglas looks
more like a young lawyer or
stock broker than an actor. He
admits that, in spite of the
influence of his famous father,
Kirk Douglas, he never

considered becoming an actor
until his second year at the
University of California at Santa
Barbara. And even then, his
interest in acting was only
casual.
"I was supposed to go to
Yale,"says Douglas, "but after
four years at Choate, the idea of
California sun and beautiful girls
in bikinis seemed more attractive
than Ivy covered halls."
Douglas' acting career
blossomed during his last two
years in college. After
graduation he moved back to
New York to study drama and
to appear in several
off-Broadway productions. His
theater activity soon led him to
television guest-star roles and,
three years ago, to a permanent
job on Streets.
"Acting is a lot more work
and a lot less glamorous than
people think," says Douglas,

who doesn't hide his disgust
after doing the same scene over
and over again all morning. "I'll
be glad when the shooting
season is over."
Douglas is pandid about the
quality of most prime-time TV
shows, including his own.
'Streets' limiting
"I enjoy doing Streets," says
Douglas. "The money is good,
and it's good recognition. But I
don't want it to go forever. It's
kind of limiting. I mean, when
you have to crank out 40 shows
a year, how good can it be?"
But Douglas thinks Streets is
a cut or two above the average
cops and robbers TV show. He
attributes this to his co-star, Karl
Maiden, the veteran actor who
portrays Lt. Mike Stone.
Maiden is cast in a father
relationship to Douglas, and this
relationship exists off-camera as
well.
"At first, we were not sure
how to play the relationship
between Lt. Stone and Inspector
Keller," says Assoc. Producer
Ken Swor. "But Mike and Karl
developed this relationship
off-camera and we try to go with
it on-camera, too. Mike didn't
have a lot of experience when
the show started out, but he's
come a long way, and he's
learned fast."
Informal atmosphere
Success as a TV star has not
affected Douglas. He is friendly,
relaxed and casual, and tends to
play down his celebrity status.
The atmosphere on the set of
Streets is informal, if hectic, and
Douglas contributes to it by

clowning around with the crew
and other actors between takes.
Robert Feero, a struggling
Bay Area actor who sometimes
works as an extra on the show
says, "Michael has success
written all over him. I mean, he's
got a famous father, he's got
money and he's got it made as
far as acting goes. But he's a
great guy — he always has time
for every one. Hell, I'm jealous
of him, but I like him."
Douglas does not like to talk
about his work on Streets for

long. Though he won't admit it in
so many words, he is bored by
the series, especially near the
end of the shooting season. He
says his real interest lies in his
current project — producing the
film of Ken Kesey's One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest, for
which Douglas owns the screen
rights.
"It's really going to be good,"
says Douglas of the film. "We've
got Jack Nicholson playing
McMurphy, and a great
supporting cast. I'll be going full

time with it as soon as we're
