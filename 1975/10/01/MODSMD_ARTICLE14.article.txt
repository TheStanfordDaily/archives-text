## Conception or contraception?

Is it possible to get birth control information on
campus without my parents knowing about it?
Have no fear, there is an abundance of
information and advice available, which will cause
no strain on either your finances or your social
reputation.
The first place to look, for the most general,
basic information, is a small green booklet
distributed to all new students, called People
Should Feel Good. A paperback called Human
Sexuality is available in the Bookstore for about
$2, and it discusses all aspects of birth control in
detail.
If what you need is help from a doctor,
examinations and advice are free at Cowell. Peer
Counseling, also at Cowell, provides a forum for
discussing your questions or problems with
trained student volunteers. For routine
examinations and services you can see a nurse
practitioner.
According to Dr. A.P. Gelpi, Cowell dispenses
no non-prescription birth control devices, but
contraceptive counseling is offered. If a student

decides she wants the Pill, she is examined and
provided with a month's supply. After a
follow-up check, prescriptions are available for
longer time periods.
Over-the-counter birth control devices will
have to be purchased off campus, although you
can get any advice you need from Cowell.
All of this is confidential. Only the doctor will
know, and all records arc kept locked up. Neither
your folks nor the University have any access to
them, unless your records are subpoenaed. And it
doesn't matter if you're still sweet "sixteen.
