# Local elm trees: disease feared
## 
### LAURA KENNEDY 
Plant Services will inspect all
elm trees on campus for Dutch
elm disease, according to Andy
Anderson, grounds and custo
dial manager of Plant Services.
The discovery of an infected
tree in Palo Alto prompted the
campus inspection and an in
spection ofall elms within a mile
radius of the diseased tree.
Over 100 American elms, the
trees most susceptible to the dis
ease. line Salvatierra, Alvarado,
Lasuen and other campus
streets. Even more Chinese elms,
such as those in the Tresidder
parking lot, dot the campus, but
the disease is less likely to affect
them.
Symptoms
Plant Services will look for
obvious symptoms, such as dead
or withering branches at the top
of the tree. But only a county or

state agricultural laboratory can
make a definite diagnosis, An
derson said.
If a tree in fact has the disease,
Plant Services will remove in
fected branches or the entire
tree, including the root system,
he said. The procedure could
cost more than $500 per tree.
Annual checks
Plant Services is also experi
menting with injecting healthy
elms in the new Pearce Mitchell
Housing Project to prevent the
disease. In future years, all elms
will be checked annually for the
disease, Anderson said.
Campus home owners who
have elms on their property can
call the Grounds Department at
497-22H1 for a free inspection.
Owners in doubt about the type
of elm should bring a small
branch with leaves to the de
partment at 315 Bonair Siding.
