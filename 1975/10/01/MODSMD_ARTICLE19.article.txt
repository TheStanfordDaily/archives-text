# Ford dedicates new Hoover FBI building
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AFJ — Presi
dent Ford got his G-man badge
yesterday as he dedicated the
new $126 million FBI headquar
ters named for the late J. Edgar
Hoover, who once called the
building a monstrosity.
"Mr. President, we've been
looking you over and you appear
to be good agent material," FBI
Director Glarence Kelley told
Ford in the front yard of the
building.
Some 1fi()(J dignitaries and in
vited guests gathered at the
structure officially designated
the J. Edgar Hoover Building to
hear the President say the dedi
cation of FBI men and women

"will be a monument even more
enduring than this imposing
building."
The massive structure on
Pennsylvania Avenue occupies
a full city block about halfway
between the White House and
the Gapitol.
Hoover reportedly disliked
the design so intensely that he
hoped the building would not be
named for him.
'Rule of law'
In his dedication address,
Ford called for "renewed com
mitment to the rule of law in
America and to the legal system
that perpetuates freedom and
justice."
Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi and
Kelley joined Ford in praising
Hoover's legacy.
Ford revealed that he, like
thousands of other youths in the
Hoover era, dreamed of being an
FBI agent. He confided this am
bition after Kelley presented him

with an FBI agent badge
mounted on a plaque.
13 years
The dedication ceremony,
complete with the U.S. Marine
Band playing the "J. Edgar
Hoover March," marked the end
of 13 years of planning, con
struction and cost overruns.
Hoover once complained that
"the ancient Egyptians wereable
to build their pyramids in far less
time than it is taking to erect our
new building," a comment Kel
ley recalled as he expressed re
lief that the work was done.
Many of the FBl's operations
previously were housed in the
Justice Department building a
cross Pennsylvania Avenue, but
other offices were in eight build
ings scattered around the city.
Beginning today, the public
gets the chance to appraise the
new structure inside and out.
That's when the popular FBI
tour moves.

WASHINGTON (AFJ — Presi
dent Ford got his G-man badge
yesterday as he dedicated the
new $126 million FBI headquar
ters named for the late J. Edgar
Hoover, who once called the
building a monstrosity.
"Mr. President, we've been
looking you over and you appear
to be good agent material," FBI
Director Glarence Kelley told
Ford in the front yard of the
building.
Some 1fi()(J dignitaries and in
vited guests gathered at the
structure officially designated
the J. Edgar Hoover Building to
hear the President say the dedi
cation of FBI men and women

"will be a monument even more
enduring than this imposing
building."
The massive structure on
Pennsylvania Avenue occupies
a full city block about halfway
between the White House and
the Gapitol.
Hoover reportedly disliked
the design so intensely that he
hoped the building would not be
named for him.
'Rule of law'
In his dedication address,
Ford called for "renewed com
mitment to the rule of law in
America and to the legal system
that perpetuates freedom and
justice."
Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi and
Kelley joined Ford in praising
Hoover's legacy.
Ford revealed that he, like
thousands of other youths in the
Hoover era, dreamed of being an
FBI agent. He confided this am
bition after Kelley presented him

with an FBI agent badge
mounted on a plaque.
13 years
The dedication ceremony,
complete with the U.S. Marine
Band playing the "J. Edgar
Hoover March," marked the end
of 13 years of planning, con
struction and cost overruns.
Hoover once complained that
"the ancient Egyptians wereable
to build their pyramids in far less
time than it is taking to erect our
new building," a comment Kel
ley recalled as he expressed re
lief that the work was done.
Many of the FBl's operations
previously were housed in the
Justice Department building a
cross Pennsylvania Avenue, but
other offices were in eight build
ings scattered around the city.
Beginning today, the public
gets the chance to appraise the
new structure inside and out.
That's when the popular FBI
tour moves.
