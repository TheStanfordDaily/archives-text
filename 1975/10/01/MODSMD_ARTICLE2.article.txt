# KZSU power boost fought
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
KFJC radio, operated by Foothill
College, yesterday filed a letter of
objection with the FCC against
KZSU's proposed power boost.
KZSU submitted an application for
the power increase in May 1975,
asking that its effective power be
raised from 40 watts to 500 watts. The
KZSU application stated that the
proposed increase would result in
approximately eight square miles of
interference — most of it on Stanford
land.
"The nature of the objection is
mainly because of interference," said
Gary Fazekas, program director for
KFJC. The station's management
decided to protest the increase late
Monday night.
The lateness of KFJC's reply was
attributed to the fact that KZSU never
legally informed KFJC of the power
increase application, said Rocky Allen,
KFJC's director of public
relations. Such negligence is a violation
of FCC guidelines, Allen said.
Met requirements
However, KZSU Station Manager
Sandy Feldman maintained that "we
complied with all legal requirements."
He said the only legal requirements
were to broadcast notice of the
proposed change a number of times
each day and to make a detailed note
of these broadcasts in the program log.
"Besides, they [KFJC] knew of our
intention," said Feldman. "It was no
secret. We are not at all at fault."
Fazekas said that he had called
Washington yesterday to check the
status of the application, and was told
that it would "be at least November"
before the FCC finally reviewed it.
Feldman questioned that date,
saying KZSU's contact is expected to
give a progress report on Oct. 13. He
added, "It is unlikely that the FCC
would tell KFJC more than KZSU. We
haven't heard that it will take that
much time."
Original request
KZSU had originally sought KFJC's
approval of the Stanford station's
power boost request, said Feldman.
KZSU even offered to pay an
engineering firm to draft all necessary
forms, if both stations would waive
objections of interference, said
Feldman. This would allow both to
increase power.
However, KFJC's Stuart Roe,
former faculty advisor of the station,
"refused our offer," said Feldman.
Had he agreed, it would have been
"reasonable" to assume the FCC
would grant the power increase,
Feldman added.
Fazekas stated that until recently

most of the KFJC staff "believed that
we would still file jointly." He said he
was not aware that KFJC had earlier
refused KZSU's offer.
Roe could not be reached for
comment.
"We decided to go ahead without
KFJC and file the best estimate
Hammett and Edison [the engineering
firm hired by KZSU] could come up
with," said Feldman.
New overtures
KFJC has made new overtures to

KZSU to file a joint petition.
However, Feldman said KZSU's
position "is going to be to wait till the
[current] application is
processed ... It would be a waste of
time [to refile with KFJC] after we've
gone so far," said Feldman.
If the request is not passed, "we
will try to work out something with
KFJC," added Feldman.
Both KZSU and KFJC have some
of the equipment necessary to
implement power boosts.

KZSU's proposed power boost.
KZSU submitted an application for
the power increase in May 1975,
asking that its effective power be
raised from 40 watts to 500 watts. The
KZSU application stated that the
proposed increase would result in
approximately eight square miles of
interference — most of it on Stanford
land.
"The nature of the objection is
mainly because of interference," said
Gary Fazekas, program director for
KFJC. The station's management
decided to protest the increase late
Monday night.
The lateness of KFJC's reply was
attributed to the fact that KZSU never
legally informed KFJC of the power
increase application, said Rocky Allen,
KFJC's director of public
relations. Such negligence is a violation
of FCC guidelines, Allen said.
Met requirements
However, KZSU Station Manager
Sandy Feldman maintained that "we
complied with all legal requirements."
He said the only legal requirements
were to broadcast notice of the
proposed change a number of times
each day and to make a detailed note
of these broadcasts in the program log.
"Besides, they [KFJC] knew of our
intention," said Feldman. "It was no
secret. We are not at all at fault."
Fazekas said that he had called
Washington yesterday to check the
status of the application, and was told
that it would "be at least November"
before the FCC finally reviewed it.
Feldman questioned that date,
saying KZSU's contact is expected to
give a progress report on Oct. 13. He
added, "It is unlikely that the FCC
would tell KFJC more than KZSU. We
haven't heard that it will take that
much time."
Original request
KZSU had originally sought KFJC's
approval of the Stanford station's
power boost request, said Feldman.
KZSU even offered to pay an
engineering firm to draft all necessary
forms, if both stations would waive
objections of interference, said
Feldman. This would allow both to
increase power.
However, KFJC's Stuart Roe,
former faculty advisor of the station,
"refused our offer," said Feldman.
Had he agreed, it would have been
"reasonable" to assume the FCC
would grant the power increase,
Feldman added.
Fazekas stated that until recently

most of the KFJC staff "believed that
we would still file jointly." He said he
was not aware that KFJC had earlier
refused KZSU's offer.
Roe could not be reached for
comment.
"We decided to go ahead without
KFJC and file the best estimate
Hammett and Edison [the engineering
firm hired by KZSU] could come up
with," said Feldman.
New overtures
KFJC has made new overtures to

KZSU to file a joint petition.
However, Feldman said KZSU's
position "is going to be to wait till the
[current] application is
processed ... It would be a waste of
time [to refile with KFJC] after we've
gone so far," said Feldman.
If the request is not passed, "we
will try to work out something with
KFJC," added Feldman.
Both KZSU and KFJC have some
of the equipment necessary to
implement power boosts.
