# Firms dispute fluorocarbon harms
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — The
fluorocarbon industry con
tended yesterday that new evi
dence casts serious doubts on
charges that fluorocarbon-based
aerosol sprays can deplete the
ozone layer and eventually in
crease the incidence of skin
cancer.
The industry said the evi
dence suggests the theoretical
impact on ozone — the protec
tive layer in the stratosphere that
reduces the ultraviolet radiation
that can cause skin cancer — was
substantially overstated, and
that any effects there may be in
consequential.
Some scientists have sug
gested that fluorocarbons —
used as propellants in some
aerosol cans, as refrigerants and
in other ways — tind their way
into the stratosphere. Once there
they act chemically to deplete
the ozone.
'Shortcomings'
Dr. James P. Lodge Jr., science
adviser to the industry, said

there are "shortcomings and un
certainties" to the theory and
that "it would be utterly against
American tradition to lynch
them (fluorocarbons) while the
evidence is still coming in."
A leading proponent of the
ozone depletion theory, Dr. F.
Sherwood Rowland of the Uni
versity of California at Irvine, re
plied in a telephone interview
that the latest calculations sup
port the theory.
"We know that a ban is inevit
able; the question is merely
when," he said.
New organization
The industry statement was
issued by a new organization
called the Council on Atmos
pheric Sciences, formed to rep
resent fluorocarbon producers,

aerosol component v« ndors,
air-conditioning and
tion firms and others.Jfle coun

Rowland-has estimated that a
one percent depletion in the
ozone layer could cause 10.000
new cases of skin cancer in this
country. A government spokes
man has said that 50 percent of
the fluorocarbons in the United
States are used as propellant in
cans of deodorant, antiperspir
ant, hair spray or other personal

grooming products. Most shav
ing lather cans do not use
fluorocarbons.
'Cause for serious concern'
A special federal task force
said last June that "there seems
to be legitimate cause for serious
concern" over use of the propel
lants. but added that considera
tion of a ban should wait a year
until completion of further study
by the National Academy of Sii
ence. This could come next

NEW YORK (AP) — The
fluorocarbon industry con
tended yesterday that new evi
dence casts serious doubts on
charges that fluorocarbon-based
aerosol sprays can deplete the
ozone layer and eventually in
crease the incidence of skin
cancer.
The industry said the evi
dence suggests the theoretical
impact on ozone — the protec
tive layer in the stratosphere that
reduces the ultraviolet radiation
that can cause skin cancer — was
substantially overstated, and
that any effects there may be in
consequential.
Some scientists have sug
gested that fluorocarbons —
used as propellants in some
aerosol cans, as refrigerants and
in other ways — tind their way
into the stratosphere. Once there
they act chemically to deplete
the ozone.
'Shortcomings'
Dr. James P. Lodge Jr., science
adviser to the industry, said

there are "shortcomings and un
certainties" to the theory and
that "it would be utterly against
American tradition to lynch
them (fluorocarbons) while the
evidence is still coming in."
A leading proponent of the
ozone depletion theory, Dr. F.
Sherwood Rowland of the Uni
versity of California at Irvine, re
plied in a telephone interview
that the latest calculations sup
port the theory.
"We know that a ban is inevit
able; the question is merely
when," he said.
