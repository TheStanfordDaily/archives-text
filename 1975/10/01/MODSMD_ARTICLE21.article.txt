# Silent Summer Scenes
## ...A Glacier Park pictorial by Dean Hartley 
### 

A small nameless island nestled in the backwaters
of Lake St. Mary is highlighted by the snow-capped
peaks of the Rockies.


The Rocky Mountains stretching out majestically in the distance,
the camera lens catches the simmering beauty of a Montana
morning.


A stand of birch and aspen create a natural barrier
from the harshness of a hot noonday sun.
