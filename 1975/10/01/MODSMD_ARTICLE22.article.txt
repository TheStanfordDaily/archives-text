The incomparable Stanford Band's between-game entertainment
on its recent trip back East spread to our nation's capital, where
the group was lauded by one of the University's most illustrious
alumnae, but snubbed by probably the nation's most eligible
female.
Rallying outside the office of Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Carla Hills, the Band was greeted by the 1955
graduate with an honorary citation of merit and a kiss, greatfully
accepted by Drum Major Steven Ritchie.
After playing two more concerts at the Capitol and Lafayette
Park across from the White House, the Band relaxed at Winston's
Bar, only to run into Susan Ford and her Secret Service entourage
(her mother has more to worry about than she thinks).
When a band member asked the recently hired Washington Post
photographer to dance, she declined, probably rememberirtg the
childhood advice not to talk to strange strangers.
So the incomparable Band left its traditional mark on yet
another city: good music, many empty beer glasses and probably a
few less signs.

and then leads the band on the steps of the Capitol Building (below) for visitors and news media.

organized 1891!" Stripped to the waist, an LSJUMB 'old fart' (a senior bandsman) leads the group
in cheer. The White House serves as a backdrop.
