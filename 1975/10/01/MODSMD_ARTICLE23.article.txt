## All soccer starters return Baldaccini takes over 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Could this be the year for
Stanford soccer to become more
than just the number two fall
sport?
The first real test will come in
the season opener at USC
Saturday, but the early
indications look very good. All
of last year's lettermen are
returning. That's right, all. Three
regulars who missed last season
will be back. Also, Bert
Baldaccini, last year's assistant
coach, will be assuming
on-the-field coaching duties.
Flayers are near unanimous in
their respect for Baldaccini's
coaching. "There's probably no
one in the country who knows
more soccer than Bert," forward
Phil Wright declared. Halfback
Glenn Cristofori noted, "Bert's

been working with us a lot on
strategy. We're no longer playing
kick-and-run."
Last year's head coach, Fred
Priddle, will supervise the soccer
program, but he says,"the
lineups and substitutions will be
up to Bert."
Baldaccini played four years
of varsity soccer for San Jose
State as an undergraduate. "I
was an Ail-American candidate
my senior year," he recalled,
"and 1 played on the Junior
Olympic team. But these things
aren't that important. I never
took soccer so seriously."
He says this year's team is
"the best Stanford team I've
ever seen, and that includes the
years that 1 played against
Stanford."
The team faces financial

problems, though. Last year, the
Athletic Department reduced
soccer from varsity to club sport
status, and cut the sport's
budget accordingly. Later soccer
was restored to the varisty level,
but without any budget increase.
By forming a Booster Club,
Priddle has made up most of the
difference. "We're reaching
alumni; just generally friends of
Stanford soccer," Ptiddle says.
There are no soccer players
on athletic scholarships,
however. Baldaccini says several
players from the East Coast did
not start practice until a week
ago because they were
financially compelled to fly the
cheaper Stanford charter.
Baldaccini says he may be
handicapped by those late starts
and the fact that "all the state
schools have been playing soccer
for a month and a half. They've
already had six or seven games."
But when Stanford action
gets underway, Baldaccini
expects to start veteran Bruce
Mosbacher in goal, Mac Taylor
(who made last year's
all-conference first team) and
Jim Stokes at center fullback,
Jim Melamed and Rick Morrow
at wingback, Marty Glickfeld,
(whom Baldaccini calls "the
most explosive player on the
team"), Robby Robb and Bob
Geiger at halfback, and Wright,
Skip Pfeiffer and Brian
Bershader at forward.
Priddle's attention is focused
on a major game, though. On
Nov. 8, the Cards will take on
Cal in Stanford Stadium. In
addition to the game, there will
be what Priddle calls "a kiddie
clinic" in the morning, where
Stanford players will
demonstrate soccer skills to local
grade school talent.
Priddle is hopeful the event
will draw 15,000 to 20,000 —
"enough to get the Stadium
again" for soccer use.

MAN IN THE RACK—Stanford's ace goalie Bruce Mosbacher is one
of the reasons Card soccer should bo better. Mosbacher was
named MVP by his teammates last season after his first year on
varsity.

MAN IN THE RACK—Stanford's ace goalie Bruce Mosbacher is one
of the reasons Card soccer should bo better. Mosbacher was
named MVP by his teammates last season after his first year on
varsity.
Could this be the year for
Stanford soccer to become more
than just the number two fall
sport?
The first real test will come in
the season opener at USC
Saturday, but the early
indications look very good. All
of last year's lettermen are
returning. That's right, all. Three
regulars who missed last season
will be back. Also, Bert
Baldaccini, last year's assistant
coach, will be assuming
on-the-field coaching duties.
Flayers are near unanimous in
their respect for Baldaccini's
coaching. "There's probably no
one in the country who knows
more soccer than Bert," forward
Phil Wright declared. Halfback
Glenn Cristofori noted, "Bert's

been working with us a lot on
strategy. We're no longer playing
kick-and-run."
Last year's head coach, Fred
Priddle, will supervise the soccer
program, but he says,"the
lineups and substitutions will be
up to Bert."
Baldaccini played four years
of varsity soccer for San Jose
State as an undergraduate. "I
was an Ail-American candidate
my senior year," he recalled,
"and 1 played on the Junior
Olympic team. But these things
aren't that important. I never
took soccer so seriously."
He says this year's team is
"the best Stanford team I've
ever seen, and that includes the
years that 1 played against
Stanford."
The team faces financial

problems, though. Last year, the
Athletic Department reduced
soccer from varsity to club sport
status, and cut the sport's
budget accordingly. Later soccer
was restored to the varisty level,
but without any budget increase.
By forming a Booster Club,
Priddle has made up most of the
difference. "We're reaching
alumni; just generally friends of
Stanford soccer," Ptiddle says.
There are no soccer players
on athletic scholarships,
however. Baldaccini says several
players from the East Coast did
not start practice until a week
ago because they were
financially compelled to fly the
cheaper Stanford charter.
Baldaccini says he may be
handicapped by those late starts
and the fact that "all the state
schools have been playing soccer
for a month and a half. They've
already had six or seven games."
But when Stanford action
gets underway, Baldaccini
expects to start veteran Bruce
Mosbacher in goal, Mac Taylor
(who made last year's
all-conference first team) and
Jim Stokes at center fullback,
Jim Melamed and Rick Morrow
at wingback, Marty Glickfeld,
(whom Baldaccini calls "the
most explosive player on the
team"), Robby Robb and Bob
Geiger at halfback, and Wright,
Skip Pfeiffer and Brian
Bershader at forward.
Priddle's attention is focused
on a major game, though. On
Nov. 8, the Cards will take on
Cal in Stanford Stadium. In
addition to the game, there will
be what Priddle calls "a kiddie
clinic" in the morning, where
Stanford players will
demonstrate soccer skills to local
grade school talent.
Priddle is hopeful the event
will draw 15,000 to 20,000 —
"enough to get the Stadium
again" for soccer use.
