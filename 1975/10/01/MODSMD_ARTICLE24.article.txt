Nine Stanford students
have become the University's
first recipients of women's
athletic scholarships, Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz
announced yesterday.
"It's become obvious that

women athletes at Stanford,"
said Ruetz. "Our standards
for awarding scholarships are
the same as for the men —
talent compared to their
peers on a national basis."
The new scholarships are
all in individual sports:
tennis, swimming and golf.
Ruetz said the program
would be expanded to other
sports, such as basketball and
field hockey, when it became
easier to easier to identify the
best performers in sports that
currently have weak high
school programs.
Ruetz, whose office now
directs both men's and
women's sports, said that
Athletic Department reserves
will fund the new
scholarships until a gift
program can be developed.
The nine scholarship
recipients are as follows:
Swimming
Anne Brodell, sophomore,
Newton Square, Pa.

Ann Coffey, freshman,
Carmichael.
Jo Harsh barger, freshman,
Bellevue, Wash.
Vickie Hays, junior,
