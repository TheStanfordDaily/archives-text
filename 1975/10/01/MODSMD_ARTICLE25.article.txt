# Cal's White has faster hook
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
An unusual thing happened at
the Northern California Football
Writers' Luncheon. A Bay Area
coach practically had to beg
reporters to ask him about his
team's quarterback situation.
No, it wasn't Stanford's Jack
Christiansen, who looked
particularly peeved when the
question came up during his talk
about the Cards. "One week
you're naming a guy offensive
Player of the Week, and the next
week you want me to start
somebody else," said Chris,
wearily repeating that Mike
Cordova will start Saturday
against Army.
But Christiansen's Cal
counterpart, Mike White, looked
almost hurt when no one
inquired about the Bear starter
this week. It seems White is

quicker with
the hook than Chris: his new
starter against San Jose State
will be Joe Roth, who relieved
Fred Besana in Cal's
come-from-behind win last
week.
Ain't no justice
"He was six for seven, but I
pulled him right out," said
White, musing over his yanking
of Besana. Chris wasn't quite so
exuberant. "Gosh, some of these
writers," he said."They might as
well just take the stuff they
wrote last year and reprint it."
Meanwhile, Chris had to
prepare for an Army team that
threatened to double-cover both
Cardinal wide receivers, putting
more pressure on a running game
that has been a big
disappointment so far. And
Army Coach Homer Smith,

whose team scored 98 points in
its first two games but was shut
out the last time it played,
sounded somewhat cocky in
quotes relayed from West Point.
While it wasn't immediately
clear what Smith, a former
Stanford assistant coach, meant,
he seemed to be saying that the
Cards would have a better team
if he were in charge.
Smith's problem
But that doesn't mean that
Smith is without quarterback
problems of his own. In the first
three games, the Cadet mentor
used Scott Gillogly in running
situations and Leamon Hall as a
passer. ("At least that way we'd
know what they're going to
call," joked Christiansen.)
That system worked fine in
Army's first two games, both
huge victories, but last week Hall

completed only three of 14
passes. Smith's apparent solution
— it sounds a bit odd — was to
elevate Hall to the full-time
quarterback role, and move
Gillogly to wide receiver.
Perhaps Smith thinks he can
pass against the Cards, whose
defensive backfield showed a
few holes during the disastrous
second quarter of last weekend's
loss. But Christiansen says he'll
stick with all four starters in last
game's secondary, including
freshman Savann Thompson and
junior transfer Mike Michel.
Replacement reasoning
"Savann's a little bigger, a
little faster, a little quicker than
anyone else we have in the
position" of cornerback, said
Christiansen, explaining why
Thompson has replaced Paul
Skrabo, last year's interception

leader for the Cards.
"He's a strong tackier, and he
did a good job in practice and in
the Michigan game,"
Christiansen added, "and except
for a couple of plays on
Saturday, he played pretty well.
All he needs now is experience."
Thompson is one inch and 25
pounds bigger than Skrabo.
Christiansen singled out
Michel, who also handles punts
and kickoffs, for his speed and
strength despite his small (5-11)
size. "He was a J.C.
Ail-American last year," said
Chris. "And we definitely need
someone who can stay with the
receivers.
Judged by speed
"We have everyone's times in
the 40 (yard dash]," Chris
continued. "So it's not as if we
don't know who's faster."
Michel started last week in place
of last year's safety, Jeff
Siemens.
Christiansen described the
touchdown lob from San Jose
State's Roger Proffitt to Maurice
Hill that caught all four Stanford
defenders flatfooted as "a sick
duck.
"It's a sinking feeling when
you see one of those go over
your head," said Chris, who
played safety in the pros. "I can
tell you from experience."
As if apologizing for his
defense wasn't bad enough, the
coach had to listen while a
straight-faced Darryl Rodgers
of San Jose State described three
of his star players, Wilson
Faumuina, Kim Bokamper and
Gary Maddocks, as "doubtful"
for the Spartans' Saturday
matchup with Cal.
"Don't believe any of that
bull," stormed Christiansen.
"Faumuina and Bokamper
carried me off the field last
weekend, and Maddocks strained
a little too hard in the
warmups."
