## Stengel's charm remains 
### Dan Pyne 
A eulogy for Casey Stengel. It
isn't easy.
It isn't easy to recount in a
short or long column the life
statistics of a man who is as
much a part of baseball as the
glove itself.
"It's impossible to sum up

what he's been to baseball,"
Angel general manager Harry
Dalton said. "He popularized
our game with so many people"
Charles Dillon Stengel's
baseball legacy spans 56 years,
including 37 as a manager — 25
of those in the major leagues. He

is the only man who wore the
uniform of all four New York
teams (Giants, Dodgers, Mets
and Yankees).
'Big Apple' manager
He led the Yankees of the
fifties to brilliant seasons, and he
led the early Mets for four
seasons, last-place years during
which the club set records for
defeats but still outdrew the
Yanks, (who'd dropped him
because he was seventy). From
1949 to 1960 he directed the
Yankees to 10 American League
pennants and seven World Series
crowns, five of them in
succession. The record may
never be equalled.
It was the recordbook
statistics that propelled him into
the Hall of Fame at
Cooperstown,N.Y.
It was his personality that
made him Mr. Baseball, the "Old
Perfesser," for millions of
baseball fans over the decades
and across the country.
He faced the game differently

than most; he met it with
humor.
Famous hat trick
It was Casey who, when
managing Brooklyn, took off his
hat on the field, allowing a
swallow to fly off his head.
When Eddie Kranepool was
20, someone asked Stengel
what he thought of the young
firstbaseman. "In ten years he
has a good chance of being
30," Casey replied.
Once, at Boston, Casey and
the Braves were ahead and it
started raining. Stengel pointed
to the darkening sky and said
the game should be called. He
was ignored until he pulled a
flashlight from a pocket and
began signalling his bullpen with
it. He was ejected.
All-out exhibition
Occasionally, to protest an
unpire's decision, Casey would
feign a faint, and lie flat-out on
the grass, arms spread. But once
when he tried it, umpire Beans
Reardon did the same thing.

"When I peeked outta one eye,"
Casey said, "and saw Reardon
lying on the ground too, I knew
I was licked. So I got up and
walked away."
Of a young pitcher who had a
tendency to skip the ball across
the plate Casey commented,
"he's got the best 55-foot curve
ball I've ever seen."
Of umpires, Casey once said
in a shouting, desk-pounding
sililoquey, "Those umpires!
They take years off a guy's life,
believe me. I don't know what
keeps me going, honest I don't.
They'll be the death of me yet."
They weren't. Cancer was.
The "Old Perfesser" is dead,
but he is not gone. He sticks in
the back of my mind,
hawk-nosed and wrinkle-faced,
peering out from beneath
battered cap with a sardonic
grump. He was, as'others have
said, one of a kind.
And still is.
