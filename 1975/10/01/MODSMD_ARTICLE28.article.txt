# Ali stops Frazier

Muhammad All stopped Joe
Frazier's strength-sapping
body attack, pounding
Frazier's head lopsided with
powerful blows that stopped
the challenger after the 14th
round here this morning to
retain his world heavyweight
championship.
It was a war and Ali fired
the most accurate and telling
shots as he pounded and
pounded rights and lefts to
Frazier's head in the 13th and
14th rounds that closed the
challenger's eyes and had him
reeling.
After Frazier groped to his
corner after the 14th, trainer
Eddie Futch signalled to
referee Eddie Padilla Jr. that
the game challenger could not
continue. And the fight was
stopped.
At the end, Frazier's face
was a mask of lumps. His eyes
looked like glass and they
were nearly swollen shut. The
31-year-old man simply was
finished.
But for a time it looked as
if Smokin' Joe might become

the third man in history to
regain the heavyweight
championship.
From the fifth to the 11th
rounds, Frazier had the best
of it, jolting Ali with lefts and
rights to the body and
occasional bombs to the
head.
Ali desperately tried to
find a solution to the
relentless pursuit of the man
he lost to in the first of their
three fights. But Frazier kept
charging.
Then, with his title
seemingly slipping away, Ali,
who has risen so many times
in his spectacular and
controversial career, went for
Frazier's head. And it
worked.
At the opening of the 12th
round, the 33-year-old
champion, who had looked
every bit his age in the six
previous rounds, drilled six
shots to Frazier's head. Then,
after Frazier drove him into
the ropes, Ali ripped eight
more clean shots to Frazier's
head and Joe was on his way
to his last hurrah.
