Secret Service: no warning
WASHINGTON — The Secret Service denied
that a San Francisco police detective had warned
the agency that Sara Jane Moore might pose 'a
threat to President Ford,and said instead that the
detective described the woman as "no problem."
Asst. Secret Service Director James Burke also
disclosed in congressional testimony that Moore
contacted the Secret Service three times on the day
she allegedly took a shot at Ford last week, but was
never put through to agents who knew her.
Each time she called the agency's San Francisco
field office, she asked for two agents who had
interviewed her the previous night. Each time she
was told they were not in the office, Burke said.
Burke challenged a statement attributed to
police Inspector Jack O'Shea. O'Shea was quoted
by his superiors as telling the Secret Service, in a
conversation about Moore, "this gal could be
another Squeaky Fromme," a reference to the

young woman who allegedly pointed a gun at Ford
in Sacramento on Sept. 5. O'Shea later confirmed
that quote.
Burke said O'Shea told agents "you have no
problem," when they asked about Moore. O'Shea is
scheduled to appear before the committee
today.
Burke, testifying at a hearing of the Senate
subcommittees, said agents did not learn of
Moore's three phone calls until after she was
arrested.
Treasury Secretary William E. Simon,
meanwhile, told the panel that the Secret Service
had been tipped to 320 threats of varying
credibility during the first 20 days of September,
about triple the usual number.
Simon wondered aloud if the nation's news
media aren't partially to blame for the escalation.
"There is a very fine line between the responsibility
of the press and glamorizing these incidents," he
said.
Security for Ford tightened
WASHINGTON — Security was stepped up for
President Ford's trip to Chicago yesterday, his first
public appearance outside of Washington since an
attempt on his life eight days earlier.
Ford's schedule for his two-day trip to Chicago
and then to Omaha, Neb., today featured carefully
controlled appearances before screened audiences
and an unusual overnight location at a suburban
Chicago hotel. An array of protective measures was
planned, including travel in a closed limousine,
unannounced routes, use of electronic detectors
and extra police.
Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, federal officials
testified that threats against the President have
tripled since a woman pointed a pistol at him Sept.
5 in Sacramento. They also disclosed that a former
mental patient offered an undercover agent
$25,000 to kill President Ford earlier this month.
Rex Davis, director of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, told a Senate subcommittee
the man was from Belleville, 111., and was detained
and returned to a mental institution. The offer was

made at a tavern in Belleville two days before Ford
spoke in St. Louis on Sept. 12.
Meanwhile, in Chicago, police arrested a woman
carrying a gun last night outside the Conrad Hilton
Hotel 12 minutes before President Ford's arrival by
motorcade, but the Secret Service said it had
nothing to do with Ford's visit.
Unrest continues in Spain
MADRID, Spain — Premier Carlos Arias Navarro
bitterly attacked Western nations last night for
"hypocritical and intolerable" interference in
Spanish affairs and appealed to Spaniards to remain
cool in the crisis.
The premier spoke on nationwide television
amid growing tension in Spain and continuing
protests abroad over the government's execution
last weekend of five guerrillas convicted of killing
police.
Earlier in the day, another policeman died of
wounds inflicted by terrorists, bringing to 19 the
number of officers killed in political violence since
January 1974. The victim was one of two
policemen wounded Monday in a $600,000
robbery at a government office in Barcelona
blamed on Basque separation guerrillas.
Viet refugees to return home
WASHINGTON — The administration has
decided to permit 1 541 Vietnamese refugees to
board a Vietnamese ship in Guam's harbor and sail
for home to an uncertain fate.
Describing the situation as "a human dilemma,"
Julia Taft, director of the U.S. inter-agency task
force on Indochinese refugees, said yesterday many
had fled "in panic" or under duress and now
wanted to be reunited with their families.
Today's weather
