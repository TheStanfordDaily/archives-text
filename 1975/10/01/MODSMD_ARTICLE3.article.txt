# Church pledges full CIA disclosure

### MARK FUNK LAURA KENNEDY 
A detailed report of illegal Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) activities —
including findings on political
assassinations and a possible Mafia link
— will be made public following
completion of the current Senate
investigation into the intelligence
gathering agency, Sen. Frank Church
(D-Ida.)said here yesterday.
Church, who chairs the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence
Activities, said the group's study into
allegations that the CIA might have
been 'involved in assasination plots in
Africa and Latin America "has been
the most sordid chapter in the
investigation to date."
The senator made the remarks
during a question and answer session
attended by 200 people in the law
school's Kresge Auditorium.
Setting standards
One student asked Church whom he
felt should ultimately set the standards
under which the United States'
intelligence forces work.
The Stanford Law School graduate
said those standards should "be set by
policymakers and not by the agencies
themselves."
He pointed out that none of the
alleged assassination plots had been
carried out against leaders of nations
which could "truly be considered
threats to our national security."
"All our assassination attempts were
against the little leaders who could not
start wars or endanger our security,"
Church added, "not Joe Stalin."
When asked if he thought the
committee was engaged in "titillating
the American people," instead of
starting to write legislation to prevent
a recurrence of CIA abuses, Church
said he felt exposing illegal activities of
the CIA and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) was necessary to
prevent a "threat to the underlying
liberties of Americans."

He used Chile as an example of a
country where CIA abuses of power
caused massive internal upheaval and
alluded to the role of multi-national
corporations in international politics.
"ITT did offer money to the CIA,
but the CIA refused to accept it.
Instead, it presented its own 'course of
action' to the corporations to disrupt
Chile's economy."
Church said that did not mean that
the regime of the late Salvador Allende
was good, "but we had no business
intervening in Chilean affairs. Chile
was no threat to the United States."
Church has been mentioned in
some circles as a possible presidential
candidate. He said, however, that he

would not consider a run for the White
House "at least until the committee
finishes its investigation." Church said
he felt it unwise to "politicize" the
committee by running for the White
House.
Running?
But he did not rule out a candidacy
after the investigation runs its course.
"You know what they are saying out
in Kansas City," Church said, referring
to the site of the 1976 Republican
nominating convention. "There are
eight candidates running for the
Democratic presidential nomination,
and all eight are tied for eighth place."
Church also lashed out at
multi-national corporations during his

hour-long talk. "Ford Motor's yearly
output is as great as Austria's Gross
National Product," he said, illustrating
the massive financial empires which
have grown up over international
boundaries since World War 11.
"Why should the U.S. subsidize
insurance for large corporations
against nationalization of property?"
Church asked. "Tax laws make it more
profitable for corporations to invest
abroad. Multi-national corporations
are involved in the 'Latin
Americanization' of the U.S. by
draining out resourses of developed
countries [by building new industry
where tax laws are easiest and labor
cheap] for their own benefit..."
