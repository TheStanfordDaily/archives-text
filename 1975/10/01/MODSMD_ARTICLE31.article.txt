# REPORT OF THE OMBUDSMAN, 1974-75
## Cultivate Flexibility Coordinate Residential Programs Review the Honor Code 
### 
From the Charge to the Ombudsman:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the inter
ests and rights of members of the Stanford community from
injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency,
from unnecessary delay and complication in administration
of university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with university activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and griev
ances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress. .. .
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputation
for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful concern for the
welfare of all members of the university community and for
the well-being of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries
into the issues involved, and makes recommendations for
suitable action. His investigative powers include access, on a
confidential basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obliged to meet with him
promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion and private or
public criticism...."
As is evident, the charge imposes a heavy responsibility on
the individual acting as Ombudsman. This in two respects:
the interpretation of the charge and the exercise of judgment
in implementing it.
In one respect the charge is very explicit: the Ombudsman
has no authority to enforce a solution to a problem or to
decide a dispute. His effectiveness lies entirely in the area of
persuasion or in "reason."
Mediation as a third party is a typical role which the
Ombudsman plays. He opens up the issues involved and helps
the participants in a dispute to see each other's position as
clearly as possible. A resolution may naturally occur within
this process itself with little more than listening and clarify
ing the issues.
This would, however, be an ideal case, for the Ombuds
man has often to move away from the neutral, mediating
position towards the advocacy of one or another solution to
the problem. It is here that he finds himself in a delicate and
difficult position; his solution may not be acceptable, how
ever "reasonable" it may seem to him. Fortunately not all
the problems which come to his attention are of this nature.
One of the most significant functions of this office, as has
been suggested, is that it can often perform a service by
simply listening. That is, it is a place where an individual or a
group can discuss any educational or institutional issue
without any sense of constraint.
This may in itself be a partial solution for the person or
persons involved. For the Ombudsman this is an important
source in aiding him to sense where institutional problems
exist which might not otherwise be perceived. The perspec
tive from this office can and often does succeed in focusing
attention on matters which need recognition and special
consideration.
Range of Problems
The extent of problems and issues coming to the Ombuds
man's attention is large, involving almost every aspect of the
University's functions. The degree of complexity of issues is
equally variable, ranging from simple requests as to where to
go and what to do, to cases involving lengthy enquiries,
telephone calls, and interviews.
Problems and issues take on a still further dimension
when whole groups are represented by an individual spokes
man. The conclusion must be that the Ombudsman, with
such a varied range of questions before him, should seek to
learn as much as is possible of the intricacies of the Univer
sity's organization and procedures.
By the very nature of his duties the Ombudsman is
peculiarly aware of the "other Stanford." It is problems,
discontents, and criticisms which come to his attention. This
image of the University is only sometimes modified by
expressions of satisfaction or praise for whatever aspect of
the University may be under discussion.
There is, however, one underlying positive assumption:
that something can be better than it is, that the institution is
not unresponsive to improvement. Indeed, there are frequent
ly positive and constructive proposals made by an individual
or a group coming initially to complain or present a problem.
The following observations, reflecting some of these prob
lems, will suggest, when appropriate, recommendations for
improvement or change.

Cultivating Flexibility j
A constantly recurring complaint on the part of students,
both undergraduate and graduate, as well as nonfaculty
personnel, is the lack of response to problems by

some office or person. The charge is frequently expressed in
terms of the "impersonality" of the institution: that it is
bureaucratic and unresponsive, that rules and regulations do
not take into account the special needs of individuals.
Again and again this office is confronted with the claim
that to make an exception to some rule, no matter how
unique the case may be, will establish a precedent. Despite
this attitude and its obvious legitimacy, there is considerable
and commendable flexibility throughout the University in
responding to appeals for special consideration of individual
problems. Yet there is need for a constant reminder that
flexibility is to be cultivated, and that the exceptional case is
to be recognized.
Residential Programs
As is generally conceded, a primary responsibility of the
University is the undergraduate's intellectual and personal
well-being. Moving, as the University is, towards a largely
residential institution, the living conditions of students be
come a central concern.
Coupled with the emphasis of house educational programs
("residential education"), the residence takes on an increa
singly important role with regard to the undergraduate's
entire experience at Stanford. The houses, therefore, require
the close concern of the faculty and the various services
which supply the houses. The faculty, the housing offices,
and the food service constitute three separate "powers"
which sometimes do not form a desirable unity.
This shows in various ways. Association with a student
residence and concern for the residential system as a whole is
viewed by many faculty involved in undergraduate teaching
as an insignificant part of their responsibility. (This is, of
course, closely related to the continuing difficulties in the
advising system.)
It is also the case that the separation of the housing
offices and their personnel as a distinct operation from the
food service and its personnel creates, on occasion, a situa
tion which is viewed by students as a failure in coordination,
whereas the two should be highly integrated.
The personnel in these operations sometimes view their
positions as entirely unrelated to the educational program
when, in fact, they are very important in creating an
atmosphere conducive to students' intellectual pursuits and
general well-being.
Honor Code Reassessment
A more fundamental problem, and one far more destruc
tive of students' intellectual well-being, is the intense compe
tition induced by the present economic and social situation.
Law and Medicine, particularly, are attracting very large
numbers of students, many more than these professional
schools can accommodate. The resulting competition for
admission to a professional school is intense.
This leads to two results with which this office has been
concerned. One is the questioning by students of the grading
in large classes with many instructors or assistants involved.
Unevenness in grading, which might have been accepted as a
natural consequence of large classes with multiple instructors,
new appears as a matter of major importance. Under the
present pressing circumstances in which the grade is often
regarded as more important than the subject matter, the
difference between a B+ or an A- can be viewed as ruinous.
The other apparent derivative, closely related to the same
circumstances of pressure and competition, is the breakdown
of ordinary standards of honesty. The actual extent of
violation of the Honor Code by students is unknown.
However, information coming to this office indicates a
considerable disregard of the Honor Code.
Among other things the Code provides that students take
"an active part" in reporting violations. But it is not clear
that this provision has ever been very widely accepted or that
students should be expccted to carry it out. In general, it
may be unrealistic to expect the Honor Code to work well
when competition of such pecuhar intensity exists. Recently
reported cases of faculty proctoring examinations (a failure
on their part to observe the Code) further suggests that
confidence in the present system has seriously eroded. Cer
tainly a reassessment of the whole Honor Code, and its
relevance to this point in time, is now desirable.
The preceding discussion of the Honor Code is largely a
result of conversations with individuals who have come to
this office to discuss alleged Honor Code violations. The
Ombudsman's office serves in this capacity as a place where
individuals may discuss informally the nature of some pre
sumed violation and weigh the question whether or not to
seek redress through fcymal action. (The formal procedure is
to take the charge of dishonest conduct directly to the
President's office.)
Students have also at their disposal a formal grievance
procedure covering other academic and institutional prob

lems or complaints. This is rarely, if ever, used and matters
which would theoretically go that route, come to this office
in search of a less formal manner of resolution. It is with
some satisfaction that this office can be useful as a partial
alternative to formal procedures which, valuable as they may
be in principle, appear to students long and difficult.
Interdepartmental Ph.D.'s.
One special problem, which concerns graduate students
alone, has been brought to the attention of this office by
both students and faculty. This relates to the student who
plans to pursue an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. To do
this he must apply to a regular department. This would seem
to imply that he intends to do graduate work in that
department, whereas he actually has other plans. Must he
dissimulate his real intention in order to enter graduate
school? Or would a given department be sure to accept him
as a candidate for graduate work if the department knew his
real intention?
The problem is further complicated by the limited depart
mental funds for support of graduate students. Accepting a
student with an interdepartmental program in mind would, in
most cases, amount to committing departmental funds for
extra-departmental purposes. This matter should be re
examined, and the means found to permit graduate students
to enter directly into interdepartmental programs.
Faculty Concerns
Faculty grievances in the formal sense are not the concern
of this office. However, requests for advice and information
concerning grievance procedures and related matters do
involve this office in the problems which untenured assistant
professors face in the present climate of financial contrac
tion.
It is a common phenomenon across the country that
assistant professors, reaching the critical point of reappoint
ment beyond seven years, are not reappointed. At Stanford
where the proportion of tenured faculty is unusually high,
financial pressures against reappointment with tenure must
necessarily be especially severe. It appears to this office that
younger faculty and lecturers should be more fully aware of
the financial factors affecting their positions.

Personnel
A large and important part of the university's work is
carried by nonacademic personnel. Many problems concern
ing working conditions and qualifications for advancement
have been brought to this office. These matters have been
referred to the Office of Personnel with the relevant informa
tion and requests for as early attention as possible to the
problems involved. To varied and often complicated matters
the Office of Personnel has responded rapidly and in most
cases with effectiveness.
The accompanying statistical table shows a marked de
cline from fall quarter to spring quarter in the number of
complaints brought to its attention. The limitations on what
the Personnel Office can accomplish, however, are considera
ble, and there will continue to be some inequities in job
classification and other conditions of employment among
this very large number of people (approximately 6000).
Perhaps one of the more innovative suggestions which has
come to this office concerns the desire of some nonfaculty
personnel to attend classes for regular academic credit. Under
certain circumstances course attendance is permitted, but
credit towards a degree is not. It would seem reasonable to
extend the present rules to allow nonfaculty personnel the
privilege of taking courses for credit. This would, of course,
entail problems concerning admission procedure and individ
ual qualifications; but, nevertheless, the suggestion is worthy
of serious consideration.
In conclusion, this office wishes to express its sincere
appreciation for help and cooperation from many persons
and offices of the University. These are times of stress for
many individuals, to say nothing of the University as an
institution and of society at large. Under such circumstances,
enquiries from this office may seem to add to the stress
when, in fact, the intent is quite the contrary.
Sensitive as this office has to be to problems and difficul
ties of the University, its positive purpose is to make things
better. Since this is not always easy to accomplish, special
thanks and appreciation are due to all who have helped.

A constantly recurring complaint on the part of students,
both undergraduate and graduate, as well as nonfaculty
personnel, is the lack of response to problems by

some office or person. The charge is frequently expressed in
terms of the "impersonality" of the institution: that it is
bureaucratic and unresponsive, that rules and regulations do
not take into account the special needs of individuals.
Again and again this office is confronted with the claim
that to make an exception to some rule, no matter how
unique the case may be, will establish a precedent. Despite
this attitude and its obvious legitimacy, there is considerable
and commendable flexibility throughout the University in
responding to appeals for special consideration of individual
problems. Yet there is need for a constant reminder that
flexibility is to be cultivated, and that the exceptional case is
to be recognized.
Residential Programs
As is generally conceded, a primary responsibility of the
University is the undergraduate's intellectual and personal
well-being. Moving, as the University is, towards a largely
residential institution, the living conditions of students be
come a central concern.
Coupled with the emphasis of house educational programs
("residential education"), the residence takes on an increa
singly important role with regard to the undergraduate's
entire experience at Stanford. The houses, therefore, require
the close concern of the faculty and the various services
which supply the houses. The faculty, the housing offices,
and the food service constitute three separate "powers"
which sometimes do not form a desirable unity.
This shows in various ways. Association with a student
residence and concern for the residential system as a whole is
viewed by many faculty involved in undergraduate teaching
as an insignificant part of their responsibility. (This is, of
course, closely related to the continuing difficulties in the
advising system.)
It is also the case that the separation of the housing
offices and their personnel as a distinct operation from the
food service and its personnel creates, on occasion, a situa
tion which is viewed by students as a failure in coordination,
whereas the two should be highly integrated.
The personnel in these operations sometimes view their
positions as entirely unrelated to the educational program
when, in fact, they are very important in creating an
atmosphere conducive to students' intellectual pursuits and
general well-being.
Honor Code Reassessment
A more fundamental problem, and one far more destruc
tive of students' intellectual well-being, is the intense compe
tition induced by the present economic and social situation.
Law and Medicine, particularly, are attracting very large
numbers of students, many more than these professional
schools can accommodate. The resulting competition for
admission to a professional school is intense.
This leads to two results with which this office has been
concerned. One is the questioning by students of the grading
in large classes with many instructors or assistants involved.
Unevenness in grading, which might have been accepted as a
natural consequence of large classes with multiple instructors,
new appears as a matter of major importance. Under the
present pressing circumstances in which the grade is often
regarded as more important than the subject matter, the
difference between a B+ or an A- can be viewed as ruinous.
The other apparent derivative, closely related to the same
circumstances of pressure and competition, is the breakdown
of ordinary standards of honesty. The actual extent of
violation of the Honor Code by students is unknown.
However, information coming to this office indicates a
considerable disregard of the Honor Code.
Among other things the Code provides that students take
"an active part" in reporting violations. But it is not clear
that this provision has ever been very widely accepted or that
students should be expccted to carry it out. In general, it
may be unrealistic to expect the Honor Code to work well
when competition of such pecuhar intensity exists. Recently
reported cases of faculty proctoring examinations (a failure
on their part to observe the Code) further suggests that
confidence in the present system has seriously eroded. Cer
tainly a reassessment of the whole Honor Code, and its
relevance to this point in time, is now desirable.
The preceding discussion of the Honor Code is largely a
result of conversations with individuals who have come to
this office to discuss alleged Honor Code violations. The
Ombudsman's office serves in this capacity as a place where
individuals may discuss informally the nature of some pre
sumed violation and weigh the question whether or not to
seek redress through fcymal action. (The formal procedure is
to take the charge of dishonest conduct directly to the
President's office.)
Students have also at their disposal a formal grievance
procedure covering other academic and institutional prob

lems or complaints. This is rarely, if ever, used and matters
which would theoretically go that route, come to this office
in search of a less formal manner of resolution. It is with
some satisfaction that this office can be useful as a partial
alternative to formal procedures which, valuable as they may
be in principle, appear to students long and difficult.
Interdepartmental Ph.D.'s.
One special problem, which concerns graduate students
alone, has been brought to the attention of this office by
both students and faculty. This relates to the student who
plans to pursue an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. To do
this he must apply to a regular department. This would seem
to imply that he intends to do graduate work in that
department, whereas he actually has other plans. Must he
dissimulate his real intention in order to enter graduate
school? Or would a given department be sure to accept him
as a candidate for graduate work if the department knew his
real intention?
The problem is further complicated by the limited depart
mental funds for support of graduate students. Accepting a
student with an interdepartmental program in mind would, in
most cases, amount to committing departmental funds for
extra-departmental purposes. This matter should be re
examined, and the means found to permit graduate students
to enter directly into interdepartmental programs.
Faculty Concerns
Faculty grievances in the formal sense are not the concern
of this office. However, requests for advice and information
concerning grievance procedures and related matters do
involve this office in the problems which untenured assistant
professors face in the present climate of financial contrac
tion.
It is a common phenomenon across the country that
assistant professors, reaching the critical point of reappoint
ment beyond seven years, are not reappointed. At Stanford
where the proportion of tenured faculty is unusually high,
financial pressures against reappointment with tenure must
necessarily be especially severe. It appears to this office that
younger faculty and lecturers should be more fully aware of
the financial factors affecting their positions.

Personnel
A large and important part of the university's work is
carried by nonacademic personnel. Many problems concern
ing working conditions and qualifications for advancement
have been brought to this office. These matters have been
referred to the Office of Personnel with the relevant informa
tion and requests for as early attention as possible to the
problems involved. To varied and often complicated matters
the Office of Personnel has responded rapidly and in most
cases with effectiveness.
The accompanying statistical table shows a marked de
cline from fall quarter to spring quarter in the number of
complaints brought to its attention. The limitations on what
the Personnel Office can accomplish, however, are considera
ble, and there will continue to be some inequities in job
classification and other conditions of employment among
this very large number of people (approximately 6000).
Perhaps one of the more innovative suggestions which has
come to this office concerns the desire of some nonfaculty
personnel to attend classes for regular academic credit. Under
certain circumstances course attendance is permitted, but
credit towards a degree is not. It would seem reasonable to
extend the present rules to allow nonfaculty personnel the
privilege of taking courses for credit. This would, of course,
entail problems concerning admission procedure and individ
ual qualifications; but, nevertheless, the suggestion is worthy
of serious consideration.
In conclusion, this office wishes to express its sincere
appreciation for help and cooperation from many persons
and offices of the University. These are times of stress for
many individuals, to say nothing of the University as an
institution and of society at large. Under such circumstances,
enquiries from this office may seem to add to the stress
when, in fact, the intent is quite the contrary.
Sensitive as this office has to be to problems and difficul
ties of the University, its positive purpose is to make things
better. Since this is not always easy to accomplish, special
thanks and appreciation are due to all who have helped.
John D. Goheen
Ombudsman
Sara G. Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
From the Charge to the Ombudsman:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the inter
ests and rights of members of the Stanford community from
injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency,
from unnecessary delay and complication in administration
of university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with university activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and griev
ances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress. .. .
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputation
for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful concern for the
welfare of all members of the university community and for
the well-being of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries
into the issues involved, and makes recommendations for
suitable action. His investigative powers include access, on a
confidential basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obliged to meet with him
promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion and private or
public criticism...."
As is evident, the charge imposes a heavy responsibility on
the individual acting as Ombudsman. This in two respects:
the interpretation of the charge and the exercise of judgment
in implementing it.
In one respect the charge is very explicit: the Ombudsman
has no authority to enforce a solution to a problem or to
decide a dispute. His effectiveness lies entirely in the area of
persuasion or in "reason."
Mediation as a third party is a typical role which the
Ombudsman plays. He opens up the issues involved and helps
the participants in a dispute to see each other's position as
clearly as possible. A resolution may naturally occur within
this process itself with little more than listening and clarify
ing the issues.
This would, however, be an ideal case, for the Ombuds
man has often to move away from the neutral, mediating
position towards the advocacy of one or another solution to
the problem. It is here that he finds himself in a delicate and
difficult position; his solution may not be acceptable, how
ever "reasonable" it may seem to him. Fortunately not all
the problems which come to his attention are of this nature.
One of the most significant functions of this office, as has
been suggested, is that it can often perform a service by
simply listening. That is, it is a place where an individual or a
group can discuss any educational or institutional issue
without any sense of constraint.
This may in itself be a partial solution for the person or
persons involved. For the Ombudsman this is an important
source in aiding him to sense where institutional problems
exist which might not otherwise be perceived. The perspec
tive from this office can and often does succeed in focusing
attention on matters which need recognition and special
consideration.
Range of Problems
The extent of problems and issues coming to the Ombuds
man's attention is large, involving almost every aspect of the
University's functions. The degree of complexity of issues is
equally variable, ranging from simple requests as to where to
go and what to do, to cases involving lengthy enquiries,
telephone calls, and interviews.
Problems and issues take on a still further dimension
when whole groups are represented by an individual spokes
man. The conclusion must be that the Ombudsman, with
such a varied range of questions before him, should seek to
learn as much as is possible of the intricacies of the Univer
sity's organization and procedures.
By the very nature of his duties the Ombudsman is
peculiarly aware of the "other Stanford." It is problems,
discontents, and criticisms which come to his attention. This
image of the University is only sometimes modified by
expressions of satisfaction or praise for whatever aspect of
the University may be under discussion.
There is, however, one underlying positive assumption:
that something can be better than it is, that the institution is
not unresponsive to improvement. Indeed, there are frequent
ly positive and constructive proposals made by an individual
or a group coming initially to complain or present a problem.
The following observations, reflecting some of these prob
lems, will suggest, when appropriate, recommendations for
improvement or change.

seek redress through fcymal action. (The formal procedure is
to take the charge of dishonest conduct directly to the
President's office.)
Students have also at their disposal a formal grievance
procedure covering other academic and institutional prob

lems or complaints. This is rarely, if ever, used and matters
which would theoretically go that route, come to this office
in search of a less formal manner of resolution. It is with
some satisfaction that this office can be useful as a partial
alternative to formal procedures which, valuable as they may
be in principle, appear to students long and difficult.
Interdepartmental Ph.D.'s.
One special problem, which concerns graduate students
alone, has been brought to the attention of this office by
both students and faculty. This relates to the student who
plans to pursue an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. To do
this he must apply to a regular department. This would seem
to imply that he intends to do graduate work in that
department, whereas he actually has other plans. Must he
dissimulate his real intention in order to enter graduate
school? Or would a given department be sure to accept him
as a candidate for graduate work if the department knew his
real intention?
The problem is further complicated by the limited depart
mental funds for support of graduate students. Accepting a
student with an interdepartmental program in mind would, in
most cases, amount to committing departmental funds for
extra-departmental purposes. This matter should be re
examined, and the means found to permit graduate students
to enter directly into interdepartmental programs.
Faculty Concerns
Faculty grievances in the formal sense are not the concern
of this office. However, requests for advice and information
concerning grievance procedures and related matters do
involve this office in the problems which untenured assistant
professors face in the present climate of financial contrac
tion.
It is a common phenomenon across the country that
assistant professors, reaching the critical point of reappoint
ment beyond seven years, are not reappointed. At Stanford
where the proportion of tenured faculty is unusually high,
financial pressures against reappointment with tenure must
necessarily be especially severe. It appears to this office that
younger faculty and lecturers should be more fully aware of
the financial factors affecting their positions.

Personnel
A large and important part of the university's work is
carried by nonacademic personnel. Many problems concern
ing working conditions and qualifications for advancement
have been brought to this office. These matters have been
referred to the Office of Personnel with the relevant informa
tion and requests for as early attention as possible to the
problems involved. To varied and often complicated matters
the Office of Personnel has responded rapidly and in most
cases with effectiveness.
The accompanying statistical table shows a marked de
cline from fall quarter to spring quarter in the number of
complaints brought to its attention. The limitations on what
the Personnel Office can accomplish, however, are considera
ble, and there will continue to be some inequities in job
classification and other conditions of employment among
this very large number of people (approximately 6000).
Perhaps one of the more innovative suggestions which has
come to this office concerns the desire of some nonfaculty
personnel to attend classes for regular academic credit. Under
certain circumstances course attendance is permitted, but
credit towards a degree is not. It would seem reasonable to
extend the present rules to allow nonfaculty personnel the
privilege of taking courses for credit. This would, of course,
entail problems concerning admission procedure and individ
ual qualifications; but, nevertheless, the suggestion is worthy
of serious consideration.
In conclusion, this office wishes to express its sincere
appreciation for help and cooperation from many persons
and offices of the University. These are times of stress for
many individuals, to say nothing of the University as an
institution and of society at large. Under such circumstances,
enquiries from this office may seem to add to the stress
when, in fact, the intent is quite the contrary.
Sensitive as this office has to be to problems and difficul
ties of the University, its positive purpose is to make things
better. Since this is not always easy to accomplish, special
thanks and appreciation are due to all who have helped.
John D. Goheen
Ombudsman
Sara G. Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
From the Charge to the Ombudsman:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the inter
ests and rights of members of the Stanford community from
injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency,
from unnecessary delay and complication in administration
of university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with university activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and griev
ances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress. .. .
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputation
for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful concern for the
welfare of all members of the university community and for
the well-being of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries
into the issues involved, and makes recommendations for
suitable action. His investigative powers include access, on a
confidential basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obliged to meet with him
promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion and private or
public criticism...."
As is evident, the charge imposes a heavy responsibility on
the individual acting as Ombudsman. This in two respects:
the interpretation of the charge and the exercise of judgment
in implementing it.
In one respect the charge is very explicit: the Ombudsman
has no authority to enforce a solution to a problem or to
decide a dispute. His effectiveness lies entirely in the area of
persuasion or in "reason."
Mediation as a third party is a typical role which the
Ombudsman plays. He opens up the issues involved and helps
the participants in a dispute to see each other's position as
clearly as possible. A resolution may naturally occur within
this process itself with little more than listening and clarify
ing the issues.
This would, however, be an ideal case, for the Ombuds
man has often to move away from the neutral, mediating
position towards the advocacy of one or another solution to
the problem. It is here that he finds himself in a delicate and
difficult position; his solution may not be acceptable, how
ever "reasonable" it may seem to him. Fortunately not all
the problems which come to his attention are of this nature.
One of the most significant functions of this office, as has
been suggested, is that it can often perform a service by
simply listening. That is, it is a place where an individual or a
group can discuss any educational or institutional issue
without any sense of constraint.
This may in itself be a partial solution for the person or
persons involved. For the Ombudsman this is an important
source in aiding him to sense where institutional problems
exist which might not otherwise be perceived. The perspec
tive from this office can and often does succeed in focusing
attention on matters which need recognition and special
consideration.
Range of Problems
The extent of problems and issues coming to the Ombuds
man's attention is large, involving almost every aspect of the
University's functions. The degree of complexity of issues is
equally variable, ranging from simple requests as to where to
go and what to do, to cases involving lengthy enquiries,
telephone calls, and interviews.
Problems and issues take on a still further dimension
when whole groups are represented by an individual spokes
man. The conclusion must be that the Ombudsman, with
such a varied range of questions before him, should seek to
learn as much as is possible of the intricacies of the Univer
sity's organization and procedures.
By the very nature of his duties the Ombudsman is
peculiarly aware of the "other Stanford." It is problems,
discontents, and criticisms which come to his attention. This
image of the University is only sometimes modified by
expressions of satisfaction or praise for whatever aspect of
the University may be under discussion.
There is, however, one underlying positive assumption:
that something can be better than it is, that the institution is
not unresponsive to improvement. Indeed, there are frequent
ly positive and constructive proposals made by an individual
or a group coming initially to complain or present a problem.
The following observations, reflecting some of these prob
lems, will suggest, when appropriate, recommendations for
improvement or change.
4
Cultivating Flexibility j
A constantly recurring complaint on the part of students,
both undergraduate and graduate, as well as nonfaculty
personnel, is the lack of response to problems by

some office or person. The charge is frequently expressed in
terms of the "impersonality" of the institution: that it is
bureaucratic and unresponsive, that rules and regulations do
not take into account the special needs of individuals.
Again and again this office is confronted with the claim
that to make an exception to some rule, no matter how
unique the case may be, will establish a precedent. Despite
this attitude and its obvious legitimacy, there is considerable
and commendable flexibility throughout the University in
responding to appeals for special consideration of individual
problems. Yet there is need for a constant reminder that
flexibility is to be cultivated, and that the exceptional case is
to be recognized.
Residential Programs
As is generally conceded, a primary responsibility of the
University is the undergraduate's intellectual and personal
well-being. Moving, as the University is, towards a largely
residential institution, the living conditions of students be
come a central concern.
Coupled with the emphasis of house educational programs
("residential education"), the residence takes on an increa
singly important role with regard to the undergraduate's
entire experience at Stanford. The houses, therefore, require
the close concern of the faculty and the various services
which supply the houses. The faculty, the housing offices,
and the food service constitute three separate "powers"
which sometimes do not form a desirable unity.
This shows in various ways. Association with a student
residence and concern for the residential system as a whole is
viewed by many faculty involved in undergraduate teaching
as an insignificant part of their responsibility. (This is, of
course, closely related to the continuing difficulties in the
advising system.)
It is also the case that the separation of the housing
offices and their personnel as a distinct operation from the
food service and its personnel creates, on occasion, a situa
tion which is viewed by students as a failure in coordination,
whereas the two should be highly integrated.
The personnel in these operations sometimes view their
positions as entirely unrelated to the educational program
when, in fact, they are very important in creating an
atmosphere conducive to students' intellectual pursuits and
general well-being.
Honor Code Reassessment
A more fundamental problem, and one far more destruc
tive of students' intellectual well-being, is the intense compe
tition induced by the present economic and social situation.
Law and Medicine, particularly, are attracting very large
numbers of students, many more than these professional
schools can accommodate. The resulting competition for
admission to a professional school is intense.
This leads to two results with which this office has been
concerned. One is the questioning by students of the grading
in large classes with many instructors or assistants involved.
Unevenness in grading, which might have been accepted as a
natural consequence of large classes with multiple instructors,
new appears as a matter of major importance. Under the
present pressing circumstances in which the grade is often
regarded as more important than the subject matter, the
difference between a B+ or an A- can be viewed as ruinous.
The other apparent derivative, closely related to the same
circumstances of pressure and competition, is the breakdown
of ordinary standards of honesty. The actual extent of
violation of the Honor Code by students is unknown.
However, information coming to this office indicates a
considerable disregard of the Honor Code.
Among other things the Code provides that students take
"an active part" in reporting violations. But it is not clear
that this provision has ever been very widely accepted or that
students should be expccted to carry it out. In general, it
may be unrealistic to expect the Honor Code to work well
when competition of such pecuhar intensity exists. Recently
reported cases of faculty proctoring examinations (a failure
on their part to observe the Code) further suggests that
confidence in the present system has seriously eroded. Cer
tainly a reassessment of the whole Honor Code, and its
relevance to this point in time, is now desirable.
The preceding discussion of the Honor Code is largely a
result of conversations with individuals who have come to
this office to discuss alleged Honor Code violations. The
Ombudsman's office serves in this capacity as a place where
individuals may discuss informally the nature of some pre
sumed violation and weigh the question whether or not to
seek redress through fcymal action. (The formal procedure is
to take the charge of dishonest conduct directly to the
President's office.)
Students have also at their disposal a formal grievance
procedure covering other academic and institutional prob

lems or complaints. This is rarely, if ever, used and matters

in search of a less formal manner of resolution. It is with

Personnel
A large and important part of the university's work is
carried by nonacademic personnel. Many problems concern
ing working conditions and qualifications for advancement
have been brought to this office. These matters have been
referred to the Office of Personnel with the relevant informa
tion and requests for as early attention as possible to the
problems involved. To varied and often complicated matters
the Office of Personnel has responded rapidly and in most
cases with effectiveness.
The accompanying statistical table shows a marked de
cline from fall quarter to spring quarter in the number of
complaints brought to its attention. The limitations on what
the Personnel Office can accomplish, however, are considera
ble, and there will continue to be some inequities in job
classification and other conditions of employment among
this very large number of people (approximately 6000).
Perhaps one of the more innovative suggestions which has
come to this office concerns the desire of some nonfaculty
personnel to attend classes for regular academic credit. Under
certain circumstances course attendance is permitted, but
credit towards a degree is not. It would seem reasonable to
extend the present rules to allow nonfaculty personnel the
privilege of taking courses for credit. This would, of course,
entail problems concerning admission procedure and individ
ual qualifications; but, nevertheless, the suggestion is worthy
of serious consideration.
In conclusion, this office wishes to express its sincere
appreciation for help and cooperation from many persons
and offices of the University. These are times of stress for
many individuals, to say nothing of the University as an
institution and of society at large. Under such circumstances,
enquiries from this office may seem to add to the stress
when, in fact, the intent is quite the contrary.
Sensitive as this office has to be to problems and difficul
ties of the University, its positive purpose is to make things
better. Since this is not always easy to accomplish, special
thanks and appreciation are due to all who have helped.
John D. Goheen
Ombudsman
Sara G. Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
From the Charge to the Ombudsman:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the inter
ests and rights of members of the Stanford community from
injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency,
from unnecessary delay and complication in administration
of university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with university activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and griev
ances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress. .. .
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputation
for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful concern for the
welfare of all members of the university community and for
the well-being of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries
into the issues involved, and makes recommendations for
suitable action. His investigative powers include access, on a
confidential basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obliged to meet with him
promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion and private or
public criticism...."
As is evident, the charge imposes a heavy responsibility on
the individual acting as Ombudsman. This in two respects:
the interpretation of the charge and the exercise of judgment
in implementing it.
In one respect the charge is very explicit: the Ombudsman
has no authority to enforce a solution to a problem or to
decide a dispute. His effectiveness lies entirely in the area of
persuasion or in "reason."
Mediation as a third party is a typical role which the
Ombudsman plays. He opens up the issues involved and helps
the participants in a dispute to see each other's position as
clearly as possible. A resolution may naturally occur within
this process itself with little more than listening and clarify
ing the issues.
This would, however, be an ideal case, for the Ombuds
man has often to move away from the neutral, mediating
position towards the advocacy of one or another solution to
the problem. It is here that he finds himself in a delicate and
difficult position; his solution may not be acceptable, how
ever "reasonable" it may seem to him. Fortunately not all
the problems which come to his attention are of this nature.
One of the most significant functions of this office, as has
been suggested, is that it can often perform a service by
simply listening. That is, it is a place where an individual or a
group can discuss any educational or institutional issue
without any sense of constraint.
This may in itself be a partial solution for the person or
persons involved. For the Ombudsman this is an important
source in aiding him to sense where institutional problems
exist which might not otherwise be perceived. The perspec
tive from this office can and often does succeed in focusing
attention on matters which need recognition and special
consideration.
Range of Problems
The extent of problems and issues coming to the Ombuds
man's attention is large, involving almost every aspect of the
University's functions. The degree of complexity of issues is
equally variable, ranging from simple requests as to where to
go and what to do, to cases involving lengthy enquiries,
telephone calls, and interviews.
Problems and issues take on a still further dimension
when whole groups are represented by an individual spokes
man. The conclusion must be that the Ombudsman, with
such a varied range of questions before him, should seek to
learn as much as is possible of the intricacies of the Univer
sity's organization and procedures.
By the very nature of his duties the Ombudsman is
peculiarly aware of the "other Stanford." It is problems,
discontents, and criticisms which come to his attention. This
image of the University is only sometimes modified by
expressions of satisfaction or praise for whatever aspect of
the University may be under discussion.
There is, however, one underlying positive assumption:
that something can be better than it is, that the institution is
not unresponsive to improvement. Indeed, there are frequent
ly positive and constructive proposals made by an individual
or a group coming initially to complain or present a problem.
The following observations, reflecting some of these prob
lems, will suggest, when appropriate, recommendations for
improvement or change.
4
Cultivating Flexibility j
A constantly recurring complaint on the part of students,
both undergraduate and graduate, as well as nonfaculty
personnel, is the lack of response to problems by

some office or person. The charge is frequently expressed in
terms of the "impersonality" of the institution: that it is
bureaucratic and unresponsive, that rules and regulations do
not take into account the special needs of individuals.
Again and again this office is confronted with the claim
that to make an exception to some rule, no matter how
unique the case may be, will establish a precedent. Despite
this attitude and its obvious legitimacy, there is considerable
and commendable flexibility throughout the University in
responding to appeals for special consideration of individual
problems. Yet there is need for a constant reminder that
flexibility is to be cultivated, and that the exceptional case is
to be recognized.
Residential Programs
As is generally conceded, a primary responsibility of the
University is the undergraduate's intellectual and personal
well-being. Moving, as the University is, towards a largely
residential institution, the living conditions of students be
come a central concern.
Coupled with the emphasis of house educational programs
("residential education"), the residence takes on an increa
singly important role with regard to the undergraduate's
entire experience at Stanford. The houses, therefore, require
the close concern of the faculty and the various services
which supply the houses. The faculty, the housing offices,
and the food service constitute three separate "powers"
which sometimes do not form a desirable unity.
This shows in various ways. Association with a student
residence and concern for the residential system as a whole is
viewed by many faculty involved in undergraduate teaching
as an insignificant part of their responsibility. (This is, of
course, closely related to the continuing difficulties in the
advising system.)
It is also the case that the separation of the housing
offices and their personnel as a distinct operation from the
food service and its personnel creates, on occasion, a situa
tion which is viewed by students as a failure in coordination,
whereas the two should be highly integrated.
The personnel in these operations sometimes view their
positions as entirely unrelated to the educational program
when, in fact, they are very important in creating an
atmosphere conducive to students' intellectual pursuits and
general well-being.
Honor Code Reassessment
A more fundamental problem, and one far more destruc
tive of students' intellectual well-being, is the intense compe
tition induced by the present economic and social situation.
Law and Medicine, particularly, are attracting very large
numbers of students, many more than these professional
schools can accommodate. The resulting competition for
admission to a professional school is intense.
This leads to two results with which this office has been
concerned. One is the questioning by students of the grading
in large classes with many instructors or assistants involved.
Unevenness in grading, which might have been accepted as a
natural consequence of large classes with multiple instructors,
new appears as a matter of major importance. Under the
present pressing circumstances in which the grade is often
regarded as more important than the subject matter, the
difference between a B+ or an A- can be viewed as ruinous.
The other apparent derivative, closely related to the same
circumstances of pressure and competition, is the breakdown
of ordinary standards of honesty. The actual extent of
violation of the Honor Code by students is unknown.
However, information coming to this office indicates a
considerable disregard of the Honor Code.
Among other things the Code provides that students take
"an active part" in reporting violations. But it is not clear
that this provision has ever been very widely accepted or that
students should be expccted to carry it out. In general, it
may be unrealistic to expect the Honor Code to work well
when competition of such pecuhar intensity exists. Recently
reported cases of faculty proctoring examinations (a failure
on their part to observe the Code) further suggests that
confidence in the present system has seriously eroded. Cer
tainly a reassessment of the whole Honor Code, and its
relevance to this point in time, is now desirable.
The preceding discussion of the Honor Code is largely a
result of conversations with individuals who have come to
this office to discuss alleged Honor Code violations. The
Ombudsman's office serves in this capacity as a place where
individuals may discuss informally the nature of some pre
sumed violation and weigh the question whether or not to
seek redress through fcymal action. (The formal procedure is
to take the charge of dishonest conduct directly to the
President's office.)
Students have also at their disposal a formal grievance
procedure covering other academic and institutional prob

lems or complaints. This is rarely, if ever, used and matters
which would theoretically go that route, come to this office
in search of a less formal manner of resolution. It is with
some satisfaction that this office can be useful as a partial
alternative to formal procedures which, valuable as they may
be in principle, appear to students long and difficult.
Interdepartmental Ph.D.'s.
One special problem, which concerns graduate students
alone, has been brought to the attention of this office by
both students and faculty. This relates to the student who
plans to pursue an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. To do
this he must apply to a regular department. This would seem
to imply that he intends to do graduate work in that
department, whereas he actually has other plans. Must he
dissimulate his real intention in order to enter graduate
school? Or would a given department be sure to accept him
as a candidate for graduate work if the department knew his
real intention?
The problem is further complicated by the limited depart
mental funds for support of graduate students. Accepting a
student with an interdepartmental program in mind would, in
most cases, amount to committing departmental funds for
extra-departmental purposes. This matter should be re
examined, and the means found to permit graduate students
to enter directly into interdepartmental programs.
Faculty Concerns
Faculty grievances in the formal sense are not the concern
of this office. However, requests for advice and information
concerning grievance procedures and related matters do
involve this office in the problems which untenured assistant
professors face in the present climate of financial contrac
tion.
It is a common phenomenon across the country that
assistant professors, reaching the critical point of reappoint
ment beyond seven years, are not reappointed. At Stanford
where the proportion of tenured faculty is unusually high,
financial pressures against reappointment with tenure must
necessarily be especially severe. It appears to this office that
younger faculty and lecturers should be more fully aware of
the financial factors affecting their positions.

This would, however, be an ideal case, for the Ombuds
man has often to move away from the neutral, mediating
position towards the advocacy of one or another solution to
the problem. It is here that he finds himself in a delicate and
difficult position; his solution may not be acceptable, how
ever "reasonable" it may seem to him. Fortunately not all
the problems which come to his attention are of this nature.
One of the most significant functions of this office, as has
been suggested, is that it can often perform a service by
simply listening. That is, it is a place where an individual or a
group can discuss any educational or institutional issue
without any sense of constraint.
This may in itself be a partial solution for the person or
persons involved. For the Ombudsman this is an important
source in aiding him to sense where institutional problems
exist which might not otherwise be perceived. The perspec
tive from this office can and often does succeed in focusing
attention on matters which need recognition and special
consideration.
Range of Problems
The extent of problems and issues coming to the Ombuds
man's attention is large, involving almost every aspect of the
University's functions. The degree of complexity of issues is
equally variable, ranging from simple requests as to where to
go and what to do, to cases involving lengthy enquiries,
telephone calls, and interviews.
Problems and issues take on a still further dimension
when whole groups are represented by an individual spokes
man. The conclusion must be that the Ombudsman, with
such a varied range of questions before him, should seek to
learn as much as is possible of the intricacies of the Univer
sity's organization and procedures.
By the very nature of his duties the Ombudsman is
peculiarly aware of the "other Stanford." It is problems,
discontents, and criticisms which come to his attention. This
image of the University is only sometimes modified by
expressions of satisfaction or praise for whatever aspect of
the University may be under discussion.
There is, however, one underlying positive assumption:
that something can be better than it is, that the institution is
not unresponsive to improvement. Indeed, there are frequent
ly positive and constructive proposals made by an individual
or a group coming initially to complain or present a problem.
The following observations, reflecting some of these prob
lems, will suggest, when appropriate, recommendations for
improvement or change.

Cultivating Flexibility j
A constantly recurring complaint on the part of students,
both undergraduate and graduate, as well as nonfaculty
personnel, is the lack of response to problems by

some office or person. The charge is frequently expressed in
terms of the "impersonality" of the institution: that it is
bureaucratic and unresponsive, that rules and regulations do
not take into account the special needs of individuals.
Again and again this office is confronted with the claim
that to make an exception to some rule, no matter how
unique the case may be, will establish a precedent. Despite
this attitude and its obvious legitimacy, there is considerable
and commendable flexibility throughout the University in
responding to appeals for special consideration of individual
problems. Yet there is need for a constant reminder that
flexibility is to be cultivated, and that the exceptional case is
to be recognized.
Residential Programs
As is generally conceded, a primary responsibility of the
University is the undergraduate's intellectual and personal
well-being. Moving, as the University is, towards a largely
residential institution, the living conditions of students be
come a central concern.
Coupled with the emphasis of house educational programs
("residential education"), the residence takes on an increa
singly important role with regard to the undergraduate's
entire experience at Stanford. The houses, therefore, require
the close concern of the faculty and the various services
which supply the houses. The faculty, the housing offices,
and the food service constitute three separate "powers"
which sometimes do not form a desirable unity.
This shows in various ways. Association with a student
residence and concern for the residential system as a whole is
viewed by many faculty involved in undergraduate teaching
as an insignificant part of their responsibility. (This is, of
course, closely related to the continuing difficulties in the
advising system.)
It is also the case that the separation of the housing
offices and their personnel as a distinct operation from the
food service and its personnel creates, on occasion, a situa
tion which is viewed by students as a failure in coordination,
whereas the two should be highly integrated.
The personnel in these operations sometimes view their
positions as entirely unrelated to the educational program
when, in fact, they are very important in creating an
atmosphere conducive to students' intellectual pursuits and
general well-being.
Honor Code Reassessment
A more fundamental problem, and one far more destruc
tive of students' intellectual well-being, is the intense compe
tition induced by the present economic and social situation.
Law and Medicine, particularly, are attracting very large
numbers of students, many more than these professional
schools can accommodate. The resulting competition for
admission to a professional school is intense.
This leads to two results with which this office has been
concerned. One is the questioning by students of the grading
in large classes with many instructors or assistants involved.
Unevenness in grading, which might have been accepted as a
natural consequence of large classes with multiple instructors,
new appears as a matter of major importance. Under the
present pressing circumstances in which the grade is often
regarded as more important than the subject matter, the
difference between a B+ or an A- can be viewed as ruinous.
The other apparent derivative, closely related to the same
circumstances of pressure and competition, is the breakdown
of ordinary standards of honesty. The actual extent of
violation of the Honor Code by students is unknown.
However, information coming to this office indicates a
considerable disregard of the Honor Code.
Among other things the Code provides that students take
"an active part" in reporting violations. But it is not clear
that this provision has ever been very widely accepted or that
students should be expccted to carry it out. In general, it
may be unrealistic to expect the Honor Code to work well
when competition of such pecuhar intensity exists. Recently
reported cases of faculty proctoring examinations (a failure
on their part to observe the Code) further suggests that
confidence in the present system has seriously eroded. Cer
tainly a reassessment of the whole Honor Code, and its
relevance to this point in time, is now desirable.
The preceding discussion of the Honor Code is largely a
result of conversations with individuals who have come to
this office to discuss alleged Honor Code violations. The
Ombudsman's office serves in this capacity as a place where
individuals may discuss informally the nature of some pre
sumed violation and weigh the question whether or not to
seek redress through fcymal action. (The formal procedure is
to take the charge of dishonest conduct directly to the
President's office.)
Students have also at their disposal a formal grievance
procedure covering other academic and institutional prob

lems or complaints. This is rarely, if ever, used and matters
which would theoretically go that route, come to this office
in search of a less formal manner of resolution. It is with
some satisfaction that this office can be useful as a partial
alternative to formal procedures which, valuable as they may
be in principle, appear to students long and difficult.
Interdepartmental Ph.D.'s.
One special problem, which concerns graduate students
alone, has been brought to the attention of this office by
both students and faculty. This relates to the student who
plans to pursue an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. To do
this he must apply to a regular department. This would seem
to imply that he intends to do graduate work in that
department, whereas he actually has other plans. Must he
dissimulate his real intention in order to enter graduate
school? Or would a given department be sure to accept him
as a candidate for graduate work if the department knew his
real intention?
The problem is further complicated by the limited depart
mental funds for support of graduate students. Accepting a
student with an interdepartmental program in mind would, in
most cases, amount to committing departmental funds for
extra-departmental purposes. This matter should be re
examined, and the means found to permit graduate students
to enter directly into interdepartmental programs.
Faculty Concerns
Faculty grievances in the formal sense are not the concern
of this office. However, requests for advice and information
concerning grievance procedures and related matters do
involve this office in the problems which untenured assistant
professors face in the present climate of financial contrac
tion.
It is a common phenomenon across the country that
assistant professors, reaching the critical point of reappoint
ment beyond seven years, are not reappointed. At Stanford
where the proportion of tenured faculty is unusually high,
financial pressures against reappointment with tenure must
necessarily be especially severe. It appears to this office that
younger faculty and lecturers should be more fully aware of
the financial factors affecting their positions.

Personnel
A large and important part of the university's work is
carried by nonacademic personnel. Many problems concern
ing working conditions and qualifications for advancement
have been brought to this office. These matters have been
referred to the Office of Personnel with the relevant informa
tion and requests for as early attention as possible to the
problems involved. To varied and often complicated matters
the Office of Personnel has responded rapidly and in most
cases with effectiveness.
The accompanying statistical table shows a marked de
cline from fall quarter to spring quarter in the number of
complaints brought to its attention. The limitations on what
the Personnel Office can accomplish, however, are considera
ble, and there will continue to be some inequities in job
classification and other conditions of employment among
this very large number of people (approximately 6000).
Perhaps one of the more innovative suggestions which has
come to this office concerns the desire of some nonfaculty
personnel to attend classes for regular academic credit. Under
certain circumstances course attendance is permitted, but
credit towards a degree is not. It would seem reasonable to
extend the present rules to allow nonfaculty personnel the
privilege of taking courses for credit. This would, of course,
entail problems concerning admission procedure and individ
ual qualifications; but, nevertheless, the suggestion is worthy
of serious consideration.
In conclusion, this office wishes to express its sincere
appreciation for help and cooperation from many persons
and offices of the University. These are times of stress for
many individuals, to say nothing of the University as an
institution and of society at large. Under such circumstances,
enquiries from this office may seem to add to the stress
when, in fact, the intent is quite the contrary.
Sensitive as this office has to be to problems and difficul
ties of the University, its positive purpose is to make things
better. Since this is not always easy to accomplish, special
thanks and appreciation are due to all who have helped.
John D. Goheen
Ombudsman
Sara G. Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
From the Charge to the Ombudsman:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the inter
ests and rights of members of the Stanford community from
injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency,
from unnecessary delay and complication in administration
of university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with university activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and griev
ances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress. .. .
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputation
for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful concern for the
welfare of all members of the university community and for
the well-being of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries
into the issues involved, and makes recommendations for
suitable action. His investigative powers include access, on a
confidential basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obliged to meet with him
promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion and private or
public criticism...."
As is evident, the charge imposes a heavy responsibility on
the individual acting as Ombudsman. This in two respects:
the interpretation of the charge and the exercise of judgment
in implementing it.
In one respect the charge is very explicit: the Ombudsman
has no authority to enforce a solution to a problem or to
decide a dispute. His effectiveness lies entirely in the area of
persuasion or in "reason."
Mediation as a third party is a typical role which the
Ombudsman plays. He opens up the issues involved and helps
the participants in a dispute to see each other's position as
clearly as possible. A resolution may naturally occur within
this process itself with little more than listening and clarify
ing the issues.
This would, however, be an ideal case, for the Ombuds
man has often to move away from the neutral, mediating

tion which is viewed by students as a failure in coordination,
whereas the two should be highly integrated.
The personnel in these operations sometimes view their
positions as entirely unrelated to the educational program
when, in fact, they are very important in creating an
atmosphere conducive to students' intellectual pursuits and
general well-being.
Honor Code Reassessment
A more fundamental problem, and one far more destruc
tive of students' intellectual well-being, is the intense compe
tition induced by the present economic and social situation.
Law and Medicine, particularly, are attracting very large
numbers of students, many more than these professional
schools can accommodate. The resulting competition for
admission to a professional school is intense.
This leads to two results with which this office has been
concerned. One is the questioning by students of the grading
in large classes with many instructors or assistants involved.
Unevenness in grading, which might have been accepted as a
natural consequence of large classes with multiple instructors,
new appears as a matter of major importance. Under the
present pressing circumstances in which the grade is often
regarded as more important than the subject matter, the
difference between a B+ or an A- can be viewed as ruinous.
The other apparent derivative, closely related to the same
circumstances of pressure and competition, is the breakdown
of ordinary standards of honesty. The actual extent of
violation of the Honor Code by students is unknown.
However, information coming to this office indicates a
considerable disregard of the Honor Code.
Among other things the Code provides that students take
"an active part" in reporting violations. But it is not clear
that this provision has ever been very widely accepted or that
students should be expccted to carry it out. In general, it
may be unrealistic to expect the Honor Code to work well
when competition of such pecuhar intensity exists. Recently
reported cases of faculty proctoring examinations (a failure
on their part to observe the Code) further suggests that
confidence in the present system has seriously eroded. Cer
tainly a reassessment of the whole Honor Code, and its
relevance to this point in time, is now desirable.
The preceding discussion of the Honor Code is largely a
result of conversations with individuals who have come to
this office to discuss alleged Honor Code violations. The
Ombudsman's office serves in this capacity as a place where
individuals may discuss informally the nature of some pre
sumed violation and weigh the question whether or not to
seek redress through fcymal action. (The formal procedure is
to take the charge of dishonest conduct directly to the
President's office.)
Students have also at their disposal a formal grievance
procedure covering other academic and institutional prob

lems or complaints. This is rarely, if ever, used and matters
which would theoretically go that route, come to this office
in search of a less formal manner of resolution. It is with
some satisfaction that this office can be useful as a partial
alternative to formal procedures which, valuable as they may
be in principle, appear to students long and difficult.
Interdepartmental Ph.D.'s.
One special problem, which concerns graduate students
alone, has been brought to the attention of this office by
both students and faculty. This relates to the student who
plans to pursue an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. To do
this he must apply to a regular department. This would seem
to imply that he intends to do graduate work in that
department, whereas he actually has other plans. Must he
dissimulate his real intention in order to enter graduate
school? Or would a given department be sure to accept him
as a candidate for graduate work if the department knew his
real intention?
The problem is further complicated by the limited depart
mental funds for support of graduate students. Accepting a
student with an interdepartmental program in mind would, in
most cases, amount to committing departmental funds for
extra-departmental purposes. This matter should be re
examined, and the means found to permit graduate students
to enter directly into interdepartmental programs.
Faculty Concerns
Faculty grievances in the formal sense are not the concern
of this office. However, requests for advice and information
concerning grievance procedures and related matters do
involve this office in the problems which untenured assistant
professors face in the present climate of financial contrac
tion.
It is a common phenomenon across the country that
assistant professors, reaching the critical point of reappoint
ment beyond seven years, are not reappointed. At Stanford
where the proportion of tenured faculty is unusually high,
financial pressures against reappointment with tenure must
necessarily be especially severe. It appears to this office that
younger faculty and lecturers should be more fully aware of
the financial factors affecting their positions.

Personnel
A large and important part of the university's work is
carried by nonacademic personnel. Many problems concern
ing working conditions and qualifications for advancement
have been brought to this office. These matters have been
referred to the Office of Personnel with the relevant informa
tion and requests for as early attention as possible to the
problems involved. To varied and often complicated matters
the Office of Personnel has responded rapidly and in most
cases with effectiveness.
The accompanying statistical table shows a marked de
cline from fall quarter to spring quarter in the number of
complaints brought to its attention. The limitations on what
the Personnel Office can accomplish, however, are considera
ble, and there will continue to be some inequities in job
classification and other conditions of employment among
this very large number of people (approximately 6000).
Perhaps one of the more innovative suggestions which has
come to this office concerns the desire of some nonfaculty
personnel to attend classes for regular academic credit. Under
certain circumstances course attendance is permitted, but
credit towards a degree is not. It would seem reasonable to
extend the present rules to allow nonfaculty personnel the
privilege of taking courses for credit. This would, of course,
entail problems concerning admission procedure and individ
ual qualifications; but, nevertheless, the suggestion is worthy
of serious consideration.
In conclusion, this office wishes to express its sincere
appreciation for help and cooperation from many persons
and offices of the University. These are times of stress for
many individuals, to say nothing of the University as an
institution and of society at large. Under such circumstances,
enquiries from this office may seem to add to the stress
when, in fact, the intent is quite the contrary.
Sensitive as this office has to be to problems and difficul
ties of the University, its positive purpose is to make things
better. Since this is not always easy to accomplish, special
thanks and appreciation are due to all who have helped.
John D. Goheen
Ombudsman
Sara G. Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
From the Charge to the Ombudsman:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the inter
ests and rights of members of the Stanford community from
injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency,
from unnecessary delay and complication in administration
of university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with university activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and griev
ances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress. .. .
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputation
for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful concern for the
welfare of all members of the university community and for
the well-being of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries
into the issues involved, and makes recommendations for
suitable action. His investigative powers include access, on a
confidential basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obliged to meet with him
promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion and private or
public criticism...."
As is evident, the charge imposes a heavy responsibility on
the individual acting as Ombudsman. This in two respects:
the interpretation of the charge and the exercise of judgment
in implementing it.
In one respect the charge is very explicit: the Ombudsman
has no authority to enforce a solution to a problem or to
decide a dispute. His effectiveness lies entirely in the area of
persuasion or in "reason."
Mediation as a third party is a typical role which the
Ombudsman plays. He opens up the issues involved and helps
the participants in a dispute to see each other's position as
clearly as possible. A resolution may naturally occur within
this process itself with little more than listening and clarify
ing the issues.
This would, however, be an ideal case, for the Ombuds
man has often to move away from the neutral, mediating
position towards the advocacy of one or another solution to
the problem. It is here that he finds himself in a delicate and
difficult position; his solution may not be acceptable, how
ever "reasonable" it may seem to him. Fortunately not all
the problems which come to his attention are of this nature.
One of the most significant functions of this office, as has
been suggested, is that it can often perform a service by
simply listening. That is, it is a place where an individual or a
group can discuss any educational or institutional issue
without any sense of constraint.
This may in itself be a partial solution for the person or
persons involved. For the Ombudsman this is an important
source in aiding him to sense where institutional problems
exist which might not otherwise be perceived. The perspec
tive from this office can and often does succeed in focusing
attention on matters which need recognition and special
consideration.
Range of Problems
The extent of problems and issues coming to the Ombuds
man's attention is large, involving almost every aspect of the
University's functions. The degree of complexity of issues is
equally variable, ranging from simple requests as to where to
go and what to do, to cases involving lengthy enquiries,
telephone calls, and interviews.
Problems and issues take on a still further dimension
when whole groups are represented by an individual spokes
man. The conclusion must be that the Ombudsman, with
such a varied range of questions before him, should seek to
learn as much as is possible of the intricacies of the Univer
sity's organization and procedures.
By the very nature of his duties the Ombudsman is
peculiarly aware of the "other Stanford." It is problems,
discontents, and criticisms which come to his attention. This
image of the University is only sometimes modified by
expressions of satisfaction or praise for whatever aspect of
the University may be under discussion.
There is, however, one underlying positive assumption:
that something can be better than it is, that the institution is
not unresponsive to improvement. Indeed, there are frequent
ly positive and constructive proposals made by an individual
or a group coming initially to complain or present a problem.
The following observations, reflecting some of these prob
lems, will suggest, when appropriate, recommendations for
improvement or change.
4
Cultivating Flexibility j
A constantly recurring complaint on the part of students,
both undergraduate and graduate, as well as nonfaculty
personnel, is the lack of response to problems by

some office or person. The charge is frequently expressed in
terms of the "impersonality" of the institution: that it is
bureaucratic and unresponsive, that rules and regulations do
not take into account the special needs of individuals.
Again and again this office is confronted with the claim
that to make an exception to some rule, no matter how
unique the case may be, will establish a precedent. Despite
this attitude and its obvious legitimacy, there is considerable
and commendable flexibility throughout the University in
responding to appeals for special consideration of individual
problems. Yet there is need for a constant reminder that
flexibility is to be cultivated, and that the exceptional case is
to be recognized.
Residential Programs
As is generally conceded, a primary responsibility of the
University is the undergraduate's intellectual and personal
well-being. Moving, as the University is, towards a largely
residential institution, the living conditions of students be
come a central concern.
Coupled with the emphasis of house educational programs
("residential education"), the residence takes on an increa
singly important role with regard to the undergraduate's
entire experience at Stanford. The houses, therefore, require
the close concern of the faculty and the various services
which supply the houses. The faculty, the housing offices,
and the food service constitute three separate "powers"
which sometimes do not form a desirable unity.
This shows in various ways. Association with a student
residence and concern for the residential system as a whole is
viewed by many faculty involved in undergraduate teaching
as an insignificant part of their responsibility. (This is, of
course, closely related to the continuing difficulties in the
advising system.)
It is also the case that the separation of the housing
offices and their personnel as a distinct operation from the
food service and its personnel creates, on occasion, a situa
tion which is viewed by students as a failure in coordination,
whereas the two should be highly integrated.
The personnel in these operations sometimes view their
positions as entirely unrelated to the educational program
when, in fact, they are very important in creating an

It is a common phenomenon across the country that
assistant professors, reaching the critical point of reappoint
ment beyond seven years, are not reappointed. At Stanford
where the proportion of tenured faculty is unusually high,
financial pressures against reappointment with tenure must
necessarily be especially severe. It appears to this office that
younger faculty and lecturers should be more fully aware of
the financial factors affecting their positions.

Personnel
A large and important part of the university's work is
carried by nonacademic personnel. Many problems concern
ing working conditions and qualifications for advancement
have been brought to this office. These matters have been
referred to the Office of Personnel with the relevant informa
tion and requests for as early attention as possible to the
problems involved. To varied and often complicated matters
the Office of Personnel has responded rapidly and in most
cases with effectiveness.
The accompanying statistical table shows a marked de
cline from fall quarter to spring quarter in the number of
complaints brought to its attention. The limitations on what
the Personnel Office can accomplish, however, are considera
ble, and there will continue to be some inequities in job
classification and other conditions of employment among
this very large number of people (approximately 6000).
Perhaps one of the more innovative suggestions which has
come to this office concerns the desire of some nonfaculty
personnel to attend classes for regular academic credit. Under
certain circumstances course attendance is permitted, but
credit towards a degree is not. It would seem reasonable to
extend the present rules to allow nonfaculty personnel the
privilege of taking courses for credit. This would, of course,
entail problems concerning admission procedure and individ
ual qualifications; but, nevertheless, the suggestion is worthy
of serious consideration.
In conclusion, this office wishes to express its sincere
appreciation for help and cooperation from many persons
and offices of the University. These are times of stress for
many individuals, to say nothing of the University as an
institution and of society at large. Under such circumstances,
enquiries from this office may seem to add to the stress
when, in fact, the intent is quite the contrary.
Sensitive as this office has to be to problems and difficul
ties of the University, its positive purpose is to make things
better. Since this is not always easy to accomplish, special
thanks and appreciation are due to all who have helped.
John D. Goheen
Ombudsman
Sara G. Stephenson
Secretary-Assistant
From the Charge to the Ombudsman:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's task is to protect the inter
ests and rights of members of the Stanford community from
injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross inefficiency,
from unnecessary delay and complication in administration
of university rules and regulations, and from inconsistency,
unfairness, unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with university activities. The Ombudsman exists
to receive, examine, and channel the complaints and griev
ances of members of the Stanford community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial redress. .. .
"Power. The Ombudsman's power rests on his reputation
for fairness, objectivity, tact, and respectful concern for the
welfare of all members of the university community and for
the well-being of the university.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues inquiries
into the issues involved, and makes recommendations for
suitable action. His investigative powers include access, on a
confidential basis, to all official university records. He may
request an audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obliged to meet with him
promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion and private or
public criticism...."
As is evident, the charge imposes a heavy responsibility on
the individual acting as Ombudsman. This in two respects:
the interpretation of the charge and the exercise of judgment
in implementing it.
In one respect the charge is very explicit: the Ombudsman
has no authority to enforce a solution to a problem or to
decide a dispute. His effectiveness lies entirely in the area of
persuasion or in "reason."
Mediation as a third party is a typical role which the
Ombudsman plays. He opens up the issues involved and helps
the participants in a dispute to see each other's position as
clearly as possible. A resolution may naturally occur within
this process itself with little more than listening and clarify
ing the issues.
This would, however, be an ideal case, for the Ombuds
man has often to move away from the neutral, mediating
position towards the advocacy of one or another solution to
the problem. It is here that he finds himself in a delicate and
difficult position; his solution may not be acceptable, how
ever "reasonable" it may seem to him. Fortunately not all
the problems which come to his attention are of this nature.
One of the most significant functions of this office, as has
been suggested, is that it can often perform a service by
simply listening. That is, it is a place where an individual or a
group can discuss any educational or institutional issue
without any sense of constraint.
This may in itself be a partial solution for the person or
persons involved. For the Ombudsman this is an important
source in aiding him to sense where institutional problems
exist which might not otherwise be perceived. The perspec
tive from this office can and often does succeed in focusing
attention on matters which need recognition and special
consideration.
Range of Problems
The extent of problems and issues coming to the Ombuds
man's attention is large, involving almost every aspect of the
University's functions. The degree of complexity of issues is
equally variable, ranging from simple requests as to where to
go and what to do, to cases involving lengthy enquiries,
telephone calls, and interviews.
Problems and issues take on a still further dimension
when whole groups are represented by an individual spokes
man. The conclusion must be that the Ombudsman, with
such a varied range of questions before him, should seek to
learn as much as is possible of the intricacies of the Univer
sity's organization and procedures.
By the very nature of his duties the Ombudsman is
peculiarly aware of the "other Stanford." It is problems,
discontents, and criticisms which come to his attention. This
image of the University is only sometimes modified by
expressions of satisfaction or praise for whatever aspect of
the University may be under discussion.
There is, however, one underlying positive assumption:
that something can be better than it is, that the institution is
not unresponsive to improvement. Indeed, there are frequent
ly positive and constructive proposals made by an individual
or a group coming initially to complain or present a problem.
The following observations, reflecting some of these prob
lems, will suggest, when appropriate, recommendations for
improvement or change.
4
Cultivating Flexibility j
A constantly recurring complaint on the part of students,
both undergraduate and graduate, as well as nonfaculty
personnel, is the lack of response to problems by

some office or person. The charge is frequently expressed in
terms of the "impersonality" of the institution: that it is
bureaucratic and unresponsive, that rules and regulations do
not take into account the special needs of individuals.
Again and again this office is confronted with the claim
that to make an exception to some rule, no matter how
unique the case may be, will establish a precedent. Despite
this attitude and its obvious legitimacy, there is considerable
and commendable flexibility throughout the University in
responding to appeals for special consideration of individual
problems. Yet there is need for a constant reminder that
flexibility is to be cultivated, and that the exceptional case is
to be recognized.
Residential Programs
As is generally conceded, a primary responsibility of the
University is the undergraduate's intellectual and personal
well-being. Moving, as the University is, towards a largely
residential institution, the living conditions of students be
come a central concern.
Coupled with the emphasis of house educational programs
("residential education"), the residence takes on an increa
singly important role with regard to the undergraduate's
entire experience at Stanford. The houses, therefore, require
the close concern of the faculty and the various services
which supply the houses. The faculty, the housing offices,
and the food service constitute three separate "powers"
which sometimes do not form a desirable unity.
This shows in various ways. Association with a student
residence and concern for the residential system as a whole is
viewed by many faculty involved in undergraduate teaching
as an insignificant part of their responsibility. (This is, of
course, closely related to the continuing difficulties in the
advising system.)
It is also the case that the separation of the housing
offices and their personnel as a distinct operation from the
food service and its personnel creates, on occasion, a situa
tion which is viewed by students as a failure in coordination,
whereas the two should be highly integrated.
The personnel in these operations sometimes view their
positions as entirely unrelated to the educational program
when, in fact, they are very important in creating an
atmosphere conducive to students' intellectual pursuits and
general well-being.
Honor Code Reassessment
A more fundamental problem, and one far more destruc
tive of students' intellectual well-being, is the intense compe
tition induced by the present economic and social situation.
Law and Medicine, particularly, are attracting very large
numbers of students, many more than these professional
schools can accommodate. The resulting competition for
admission to a professional school is intense.
This leads to two results with which this office has been
concerned. One is the questioning by students of the grading
in large classes with many instructors or assistants involved.
Unevenness in grading, which might have been accepted as a
natural consequence of large classes with multiple instructors,
new appears as a matter of major importance. Under the
present pressing circumstances in which the grade is often
regarded as more important than the subject matter, the
difference between a B+ or an A- can be viewed as ruinous.
The other apparent derivative, closely related to the same
circumstances of pressure and competition, is the breakdown
of ordinary standards of honesty. The actual extent of
violation of the Honor Code by students is unknown.
However, information coming to this office indicates a
considerable disregard of the Honor Code.
Among other things the Code provides that students take
"an active part" in reporting violations. But it is not clear
that this provision has ever been very widely accepted or that
students should be expccted to carry it out. In general, it
may be unrealistic to expect the Honor Code to work well
when competition of such pecuhar intensity exists. Recently
reported cases of faculty proctoring examinations (a failure
on their part to observe the Code) further suggests that
confidence in the present system has seriously eroded. Cer
tainly a reassessment of the whole Honor Code, and its
relevance to this point in time, is now desirable.
The preceding discussion of the Honor Code is largely a
result of conversations with individuals who have come to
this office to discuss alleged Honor Code violations. The
Ombudsman's office serves in this capacity as a place where
individuals may discuss informally the nature of some pre
sumed violation and weigh the question whether or not to
seek redress through fcymal action. (The formal procedure is
to take the charge of dishonest conduct directly to the
President's office.)
Students have also at their disposal a formal grievance
procedure covering other academic and institutional prob

lems or complaints. This is rarely, if ever, used and matters
which would theoretically go that route, come to this office
in search of a less formal manner of resolution. It is with
some satisfaction that this office can be useful as a partial
alternative to formal procedures which, valuable as they may
be in principle, appear to students long and difficult.
Interdepartmental Ph.D.'s.
One special problem, which concerns graduate students
alone, has been brought to the attention of this office by
both students and faculty. This relates to the student who
plans to pursue an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. To do
this he must apply to a regular department. This would seem
to imply that he intends to do graduate work in that
department, whereas he actually has other plans. Must he
dissimulate his real intention in order to enter graduate
school? Or would a given department be sure to accept him
as a candidate for graduate work if the department knew his
real intention?
The problem is further complicated by the limited depart
mental funds for support of graduate students. Accepting a
student with an interdepartmental program in mind would, in
most cases, amount to committing departmental funds for
extra-departmental purposes. This matter should be re
examined, and the means found to permit graduate students
to enter directly into interdepartmental programs.
Faculty Concerns
Faculty grievances in the formal sense are not the concern
of this office. However, requests for advice and information
concerning grievance procedures and related matters do
involve this office in the problems which untenured assistant
professors face in the present climate of financial contrac
tion.
It is a common phenomenon across the country that
assistant professors, reaching the critical point of reappoint
ment beyond seven years, are not reappointed. At Stanford
where the proportion of tenured faculty is unusually high,
financial pressures against reappointment with tenure must
necessarily be especially severe. It appears to this office that
younger faculty and lecturers should be more fully aware of
the financial factors affecting their positions.
