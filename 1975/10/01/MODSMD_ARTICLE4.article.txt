# Computer muffs PTRs

Surmounting bureaucratic obstacles
and the vagaries of a fickle computer,
about 12,500 students registered
smoothly here Monday and Tuesday.
Returning students usually
accepted the computer's whims
philosophically, according to Maples
Pavilion clerks, but many newcomers
seemed baffled by the registration
procedure.
Freshmen were further confused by
ar> omission on their Permits To
Register (PTR). Because of a clerical
error, the computer failed to print the
choice of meal plans available, leaving
the board section blank.
Bugs in the computer program were
apparently responsible for two other
errors, according to Asst. Registrar
Edna Nigh.
The computer goofed
The computer randomly billed
about 600 students $200 for their
off-campus housing. It also randomly
demanded board plans from some
students who will not be using the
University Food Service. Students in
Toyon Hall, for example, pay the
eating clubs directly.

All errors had been noted by rridmoming
Monday, but clerks in Maples still had
to revise the defective PTR's by hand.
Many registration workers said
students this year seemed more
befuddled by registration than usual.
"I've never had so many stupid
questions," one exclaimed. "I wish
they'd just read the Time Schedule
and the signs."
Jobs and loans were missing
Students often misunderstand their
financial aids packages, according to
Betty Frischmann of the Controller's
Office. After promises of jobs and
loans, many freshmen panicked when
neither appeared on their bill.
Resident assistants and recently
appointed teaching assistants
encountered the same problem
because their grant cards had not been
prepared.
And students on fellowships from
foreign countries often found that
their graduate awards had not yet
arrived at Stanford.
In all cases, distraught students
could simply defer payment without
incurring a late fee, Frischmann said.

Frosh could not arrange loans
Bewildered freshmen were also
worried when they could not arrange
federally insured student loans over
the summer, according to Mary
Roberts, assistant director of financial
aids.
Many banks have stopped offering
loans to freshmen because of low
interest, long repayment time and high
freshman dropout rates, she said.
Local banks still support the
federally insured loan program,
Roberts noted. Students who pay their
deferred bills with the loan check will
not incur a late fee, despite the
two-month loan processing time.

to revise the defective PTR's by hand.
Many registration workers said
students this year seemed more
befuddled by registration than usual.
"I've never had so many stupid
questions," one exclaimed. "I wish
they'd just read the Time Schedule
and the signs."
Jobs and loans were missing
Students often misunderstand their
financial aids packages, according to
Betty Frischmann of the Controller's
Office. After promises of jobs and
loans, many freshmen panicked when
neither appeared on their bill.
Resident assistants and recently
appointed teaching assistants
encountered the same problem
because their grant cards had not been
prepared.
And students on fellowships from
foreign countries often found that
their graduate awards had not yet
arrived at Stanford.
In all cases, distraught students
could simply defer payment without
incurring a late fee, Frischmann said.

Frosh could not arrange loans
Bewildered freshmen were also
worried when they could not arrange
federally insured student loans over
the summer, according to Mary
Roberts, assistant director of financial
aids.
Many banks have stopped offering
loans to freshmen because of low
interest, long repayment time and high
freshman dropout rates, she said.
Local banks still support the
federally insured loan program,
Roberts noted. Students who pay their
deferred bills with the loan check will
not incur a late fee, despite the
two-month loan processing time.
Surmounting bureaucratic obstacles
and the vagaries of a fickle computer,
about 12,500 students registered
smoothly here Monday and Tuesday.
Returning students usually
accepted the computer's whims
philosophically, according to Maples
Pavilion clerks, but many newcomers
seemed baffled by the registration
procedure.
Freshmen were further confused by
ar> omission on their Permits To
Register (PTR). Because of a clerical
error, the computer failed to print the
choice of meal plans available, leaving
the board section blank.
Bugs in the computer program were
apparently responsible for two other
errors, according to Asst. Registrar
Edna Nigh.
The computer goofed
The computer randomly billed
about 600 students $200 for their
off-campus housing. It also randomly
demanded board plans from some
students who will not be using the
University Food Service. Students in
Toyon Hall, for example, pay the
eating clubs directly.

All errors had been noted by rridmoming
Monday, but clerks in Maples still had
to revise the defective PTR's by hand.
