# 13 percent crime rise reported

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
nation's crime rate rose 13 percent
during the first half of the year
compared with the same period a year
ago, the FBI reported yesterday.
The rate was markedly less than the
increase reported for each succeeding
quarter for nearly two years. But Atty.
Gen. Edward Levi said, "We can claim
no great solace in the fact that the rate
in the rise of serious crime has lessened
somewhat. Crime remains an
enormous national problem and
current levels are, and must be, seen as
unacceptable."
Increase breakdown
Broken down into three-month
periods, the FBI statistics showed an
18 percent surge for January,
February and March but only an eight
percent increase for April, May and
June.
That's the first time in 21 months
that the quarterly increase has slowed
to less than the double-digit level.
The FBI Uniform Crime Reports
are based on the number of murders,
rapes, robberies, burglaries, assaults,
larcenies and motor vehicle thefts
reported to more than 8,000 state and
local policies agencies. The statistical
report suggests no explanations for the
fluctuations.
Actual number?
In all cases, the percentage of
change is computed by measuring the
volume of reported crime against the
volume for the same period a year
earlier. Other studies indicate that
actual crime may be two to three
times higher than reported crime.
The new report showed increases in
all seven crime categories, in all
sections of the country, in cities of all
sizes and rural and suburban areas as
well.
But the 13 percent jump for the
six-month period was noticeably less
than the 17 percent increase for the
full year of 1974.
Trend started in '73
The current trend of crime
increases began in the last three
months of 1973 when the rate rose 16
percent compared with the final
quarter of 1972. In every calendar
quarter since, the increase has been in
double digits until dropping to eight
percent this spring. The latest report
showed six-month increases of four
percent each for murder, rape and
vehicle theft; 17 percent for robbery,
nine percent for assault, and 14
percent each for burglary and larceny.
The report said that over-all, crime
rose 12 percent in cities over 25,000 in
population, 14 to 15 percent in
smaller towns, 14 percent in the
suburbs and 15 percent in rural areas.
By region, the figures showed
increases of 13 percent in northeastern
states, 12 percent in north central
states, 16 percent in the South, and
ten percent in the West.
