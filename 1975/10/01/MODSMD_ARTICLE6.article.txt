# Bring back proctoring
## 
### 
While watching the local news
on television recently, I
happened to encounter a special
report which implied a rather
disturbing point: In general,
Stanford students are cheaters.
The circumstances which
prompted such a story to merit
prime-time television were not
stated, but it undoubtedly led a
large number of viewers to
question their faith in the
reputation of the University.
The report, which was shot
on location here, featured a
short interview with John
Goheen, University ombudsman.
He attributed the increasing
incidence of cheating at the
undergraduate level in recent
years primarily to the intense
competition for admission to
graduate and, in particular,
professional schools.
The apparently serious nature
of this problem at Stanford
carries with it a number of
implications which are not to be
taken lightly.
First of all, one cannot help
but ponder the authenticity of
the fine high school records
which enabled several thousand
individuals to earn their
prestigious positions as Stanford
undergraduates.
Evaluation clouded
Secondly, the situation poses
a problem to graduate and
professional school admissions
committees in attempting to
accurately evaluate and compare
applicants. In addition, its
detrimental effects upon the
image of the University are not
likely to help the average
Stanford graduate in his quest
for employment on the outside.

Finally, and perhaps most
importantly, it not only lowers
the esteem of students for each
other, but also taints the image
which the individual has of
himself.
In light of this, it is clear that
the rampant cheating situation
at Stanford should be corrected
immediately. It is important to
realize that the problem is
certainly not unique to
Stanford; nevertheless, other
institutions have more
effectively dealt with it than we
have here.
The honors system currently
in use here is obviously
inadequate and tends to
encourage cheating simply
through the ease with which it
may be violated. Although every
student is required to sign the
Honor Code prior to an
examination, it might well be
said that never has so much
meant so little to so few.
In addition, the success of the
honors system is based upon the
rather idealistic assumption that
students will faithfully report
observed instances of cheating.
Unrealistic view
First, it is unrealistic to
expect a student to monitor his
classmates while simultaneously
working on his own
examination.
Second, I can testify from
experience that observed
violations of the code tend to go
unreported. I have observed
numerous instances of cheating
during my three years at
Stanford,yet have not reported a
single one: It is simply not in my
nature (nor, in my opinion, in

David Sartoris

that of the average student) to
go around telling on others.
Since the severe competition
for places in graduate and
professional schools is not likely
to change in the near future, the
University should actively
consider workable alternatives to
the present system. Increased
emphasis on the moral wrongness
of cheating would do little to
salvage the honor system, since
most cheaters probably derive
no pride from their actions.
Instead, most undoubtedly
feel extremely guilty about their
behavior, yet persist since it is
relatively easy to get away with
and easy to forget under the
present system.
Proctors needed
Only reinstatement of a more
strict, traditional proctor system
will effectively alleviate the
problem. Such action would, of
course, seem to many to be an
admission of mistrust of
the integrity of the student body
on the part of the University; a
return to discipline, so to speak.
However, is it not better to
clean up the mess and admit that
it once existed than to sweep it
under the rug where it is not
obvious but still persists?
The present honor system
resulted from student objection
to a more rigid one which
existed some years ago.
Nevertheless, I feel at this
time that the University need
not expect significant student
objection to a return to a more
strict proctor system. Honest
students can only benefit from
such a change, and students
prone to cheating might
welcome removal of the
omnipresent temptation
afforded by the present system.

While watching the local news
on television recently, I
happened to encounter a special
report which implied a rather
disturbing point: In general,
Stanford students are cheaters.
The circumstances which
prompted such a story to merit
prime-time television were not
stated, but it undoubtedly led a
large number of viewers to
question their faith in the
reputation of the University.
The report, which was shot
on location here, featured a
short interview with John
Goheen, University ombudsman.
He attributed the increasing
incidence of cheating at the
undergraduate level in recent
years primarily to the intense
competition for admission to
graduate and, in particular,
professional schools.
The apparently serious nature
of this problem at Stanford
carries with it a number of
implications which are not to be
taken lightly.
First of all, one cannot help
but ponder the authenticity of
the fine high school records
which enabled several thousand
individuals to earn their
prestigious positions as Stanford
undergraduates.
Evaluation clouded
Secondly, the situation poses
a problem to graduate and
professional school admissions
committees in attempting to
accurately evaluate and compare
applicants. In addition, its
detrimental effects upon the
image of the University are not
likely to help the average
Stanford graduate in his quest
for employment on the outside.

Finally, and perhaps most
importantly, it not only lowers
the esteem of students for each
other, but also taints the image
which the individual has of
himself.
In light of this, it is clear that
the rampant cheating situation
at Stanford should be corrected
immediately. It is important to
realize that the problem is
certainly not unique to
Stanford; nevertheless, other
institutions have more
effectively dealt with it than we
have here.
The honors system currently
in use here is obviously
inadequate and tends to
encourage cheating simply
through the ease with which it
may be violated. Although every
student is required to sign the
Honor Code prior to an
examination, it might well be
said that never has so much
meant so little to so few.
In addition, the success of the
honors system is based upon the
rather idealistic assumption that
students will faithfully report
observed instances of cheating.
Unrealistic view
First, it is unrealistic to
expect a student to monitor his
classmates while simultaneously
working on his own
examination.
Second, I can testify from
experience that observed
violations of the code tend to go
unreported. I have observed
numerous instances of cheating
during my three years at
Stanford,yet have not reported a
single one: It is simply not in my
nature (nor, in my opinion, in

David Sartoris

that of the average student) to
go around telling on others.
Since the severe competition
for places in graduate and
professional schools is not likely
to change in the near future, the
University should actively
consider workable alternatives to
the present system. Increased
emphasis on the moral wrongness
of cheating would do little to
salvage the honor system, since
most cheaters probably derive
no pride from their actions.
