# Book policy needs review

A letter from Richard Thomas (Daily, Sept.
29), community relations officer of the Gay
People's Union, has alleged barriers to free access
to writings on homosexuality in the Main Library.
I have been assured by David Weber, chairman
of the University Library Council, that the
principles of free inquiry stated in the 1972
document, "Intellectual Freedom and the
Stanford University Libraries," are fully
operative.
These principles anticipated and make specific
with reference to the library the principles set
forth in the 1974 Statement on Academic
Freedom, particularly the first two sentences of
the preamble: "Stanford University's
functions of teaching, learning, research, and
scholarship depend upon an atmosphere in which
freedom of inquiry, thought, expression,
publication and peaceable assembly are given the
fullest protection. Expression of the widest range
of viewpoints should be encouraged, free from
institutional orthodoxy and from internal or
external coercion."
No Utopia
Were men and women gods and goddesses, the
University's libraries could allow anybody to use
any book at any time and every book would be
returned before the next user wanted it. In the
real world, however, certain restrictions must be
placed on the circulation of holdings that are
likely to be under great demand or, because of
their rarity or value or current interest, to be
pilfered.
While the libraries quite properly hold as
confidential the records of circulation, the
principles of free inquiry imply openness of the
inquirer about his or her subject of investigation.

William Clebsch II

The identification of holdings that merit
special protection and restricted circulation
because they are rare materials, reference
materials, or materials under exceptionally heavy
demand for academic reasons is fairly routine.
Much less confident judgments can be made as to
identifying materials that are deemed likely to be
pilfered because of special interest, whatever the
nature of that interest.
Inquiry prompted
Prompted by Thomas's letter, I am request.ng
that theCommittee on Libraries be informed at an
early meeting of the types of subject matter in
this last category that are placed under restricted
circulation. The committee should review the
restrictive policies in this category as they operate
in the Main Library and in each of the coordinate
libraries.
This review should include not only the
guidelines under which current acquisitions in this
category are restricted as to circulation, but also
past practices, this last with a view to the possible
formulation of a policy on removing restrictions
from certain materials that may have commanded
high degrees of interest in the past but no longer
are of sufficient interest to warrant fear of theft.
I have every confidence that the University
Library Council and the staffs of the Main
Coordinate Libraries are implementing the
principles of intellectual freedom and open
inquiry. My only concern is that we periodically
review and update those ranges of subject mat*"-
whose materials are restricted as to sh' g
and/or circulation by virtue of a necessarily
delicate judgment as to likelihood of theft.
(William Clebsch is chairman of the Committee
on Libraries.)
