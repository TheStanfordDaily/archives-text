George C. Scott
and William Devane in
Fear Onliial
Xerox is proud to present a major television special
starring George C. Scott and William Devane. "Fear On Trial" is
the gripping dramatization of tile true story of John Henry Faulk,
a CBS broadcaster who was unable to find work because a group
of self-appointed arbiters questioned his beliefs and his patriotism.
In the 1950s and early 19605, the hysteria of Communist
witch-hunts, defamation and blacklisting drove teachers from
their jobs, forced ministers from their churches and put
performers and writers out of work.
"Fear On Trial" is the story of one man who chose to
fight back.
Tonight on the CBS-TV Network. vrnnv
9 :00 pm. Channel 5 AIKUa
