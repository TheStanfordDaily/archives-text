# Grad studies dean identifies problems
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
W.B. Carnochan, newly appointed
dean of graduate studies, said that the
University must "assess how many
students it is reasonable to admit" to
its graduate programs, in view of the
national oversupply of Ph.D's.
"The future of graduate education
over the next 10 years — especially in
a field where jobs are short," is the
most pressing problem he faces,
Carnochan said.
"It isn't clear that even if there is
some cutting down [nationwide]
whether it is right for Stanford to cut
down on its graduate programs,"
added Carnochan.
Whether to weigh financial need as
a factor in providing aid to graduate
students is his second major problem,
said Carnochan. The amount of aid a
graduate student currently receives is a
set stipend.
Carnochan intends to work with
the Graduate Student Council and the
Committee on Graduate Studies on
these problems.
Former chairman of the English
Department, from 1971-1973,
Carnochan holds three degrees from
Harvard. He came here as an instructor
in 1960.
Carnochan succeeds Statistics
Prof. Lincoln Moses. As dean,
Moses headed the Association of
Graduate Schools of the Association
of American Universities last year. He
plans to return to teaching and
research.
The graduate dean's office is
planned to be enlarged "over the
course of the next year," said
Carnochan. "The exact shape of the
merger is still to be decided."

Carnochan has served as chairman
of the honors program and head of
undergraduate studies in the English
Department. He also has been an
elected representative to the Faculty
Senate and has served as a member of
the Budget Priorities Advisory
Committee.
Carnochan recently finished work
on a book, with the help of a
University grant. His book, Lemuel
Gulliver's Mirror for Man, explores
some of Swift's best-known satire.
Carnochan's field of expertise is
18th century English literature.


OVER THF. RAINBOW—W. B. Camochan, the new dean of graduate studies,
said that the most pressing problem facing him is the future of graduate
stud'i-s.
