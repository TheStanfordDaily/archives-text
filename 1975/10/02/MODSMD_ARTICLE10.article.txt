# But what do conservatives stand for?
## 
### Tim W. Ferguson 
With the visit to Stanford
tomorrow of renowned
conservative William Buckley
serving as a catalyst, scholars on
both ends of the political
spectrum would do well to ask
just what are the affirmative
aspects of ideological
conservatism.
Buckley is known for his
eloquent aimings at the foibles
of modern liberalism, and indeed
most of his conservative
brethren spend a good portion
of their time lambasting the
other side. Little, however, is
heard of the principles
conservatism stands for — why.
Libertarian Edith Efron
examines these questions in the
October issue of The
Alternative. Her conclusions
should not give heart to the
conservatives.
Her research into conservative
philosophical writings found

them to end with "perorations on
Society woven around such
concepts as God, Authority,
Order, Tradition, Duty,
Patriotism, and so on. Never
were these Platonic abstractions
derived in any rational way; they
were just asserted as self-evident
truths."
In short, she writes,
conservative ideology "appeared
to be an implacable dedication
to the status quo dressed up as
metaphysics."
Statists shun freedom
Despite the cries of modern
conservatives over the
individual's plight vis a vis big
government, Efron finds their
philosophy inherently
anti-individual, with reverence
for the "primacy of the organic
community."
She continues, "What kind of
philosophy was this, I wondered,
that cannot grasp the primacy of
the individual mind, its right to
self-assertion, to thought, to
value judgments, to self-interest
— its right to flout tradition, if
that tradition is fatuous or
irrational, its right to repudiate
authority, if that authority is
imbecile or immoral, its right to
destroy order, if that order is
unjust or malignant?"
Efron claims that according
to conservative author James
Burnham, conservatives "believe
such ideas as these: man is often
irrational; reason, science, and
education, accordingly, cannot
solve many or most human
problems; certain races, in
particular, are presently less
educable than others: .. . the
social cohesion of [the] organic
community is far more
important than free thought,
free speech, free academic
inquiry, and free dissent, which
threaten its stability. ..

"Indeed, Burnham granted
that liberals perceive such ideas
as 'fascist.' But that is not a silly
perception: there is a
fascist-Hegelian strain in
conservative thought, just as
there is a socialist-Marxist strain
in liberal thought."
What, then, is "affirmative"
conservatism? To Efron it "is
the same 'affirmative'
metaphysics and social

philosophy that has underlain all
theocracies since the days of the
cave man. .. When I examined
this 'affirmative' social theology
carefully, I discovered that it is
organized to combat one
central evil — the individual and
his unfettered mind."
Work ethic kept
The conservative remains true
to individual freedom in only
one area: economics. But he
derives this belief not from an
underlying devotion to
individual liberty, Efron
maintains, but from religious
origins. "For most conservatives,
support for the Horatio Alger,
free enterprise tradition is really
a vestige of Calvinism," Efron
says.
Thus not based on principles
of individual liberty, many
conservatives' inclinations
toward economic
self-betterment know no bounds
on infringment on the liberty of
others. Writes Efron:
"Conservatives have paid
desperate penalties for the core

contradiction at the heart of
their philosophy, and for the
mystical epistemology which
renders its principles impotent.
One of these penalties is the
political disaster called
Watergate. For the tragic truth —
the many honest and morally
distinguished conservatives
notwithstanding — is that
Watergate is a
conservative phenomenon."
Base deteriorates
•And it is one which has led to
further disintegration of the
already-evaporating ideological
base for conservatism, a decay
which has paralleled remarkably
the downfall of organized
religion in the United States.
It is this atrophy which has
forced conservatives to stoop
from the intellectual heights of a
Robert Taft in 1952 to the
depths of anti-ideology trade
unionism and demagoguery in
the person of a George Wallace a
generation later.
Sadly, some intelligent young
conservatives, such as those from
Stanford who will dine with
Buckley tomorrow night, fail to
perceive the hollowness of their
philosophical foundation. For
them, Efron has this advice:
"If they want a future at all,
young conservatives must take
their own libertarian tradition
seriously. When they do, they
will extricate themselves from
their presently untenable
position — that of blindly
conserving authority, tradition,
and order in a state moving fast
toward socialism. They will
become radicals, intent on a
drastic reformation of their
society."

irrational, its right to repudiate
authority, if that authority is
imbecile or immoral, its right to
destroy order, if that order is
unjust or malignant?"
Efron claims that according
to conservative author James
Burnham, conservatives "believe
such ideas as these: man is often
irrational; reason, science, and
education, accordingly, cannot
solve many or most human
problems; certain races, in
particular, are presently less
educable than others: .. . the
social cohesion of [the] organic
community is far more
important than free thought,
free speech, free academic
inquiry, and free dissent, which
threaten its stability. ..

"Indeed, Burnham granted
that liberals perceive such ideas
as 'fascist.' But that is not a silly
perception: there is a
fascist-Hegelian strain in
conservative thought, just as
there is a socialist-Marxist strain
in liberal thought."
What, then, is "affirmative"
conservatism? To Efron it "is
the same 'affirmative'
metaphysics and social

philosophy that has underlain all
theocracies since the days of the
cave man. .. When I examined
this 'affirmative' social theology
carefully, I discovered that it is
organized to combat one
central evil — the individual and
his unfettered mind."
Work ethic kept
The conservative remains true
to individual freedom in only
one area: economics. But he
derives this belief not from an
underlying devotion to
individual liberty, Efron
maintains, but from religious
origins. "For most conservatives,
support for the Horatio Alger,
free enterprise tradition is really
a vestige of Calvinism," Efron
says.
Thus not based on principles
of individual liberty, many
conservatives' inclinations
toward economic
self-betterment know no bounds
on infringment on the liberty of
others. Writes Efron:
"Conservatives have paid
desperate penalties for the core

contradiction at the heart of
their philosophy, and for the
mystical epistemology which
renders its principles impotent.
One of these penalties is the
political disaster called
Watergate. For the tragic truth —
the many honest and morally
distinguished conservatives
notwithstanding — is that
Watergate is a
conservative phenomenon."
Base deteriorates
•And it is one which has led to
further disintegration of the
already-evaporating ideological
base for conservatism, a decay
which has paralleled remarkably
the downfall of organized
religion in the United States.
It is this atrophy which has
forced conservatives to stoop
from the intellectual heights of a
Robert Taft in 1952 to the
depths of anti-ideology trade
unionism and demagoguery in
the person of a George Wallace a
generation later.
Sadly, some intelligent young
conservatives, such as those from
Stanford who will dine with
Buckley tomorrow night, fail to
perceive the hollowness of their
philosophical foundation. For
them, Efron has this advice:
"If they want a future at all,
young conservatives must take
their own libertarian tradition
seriously. When they do, they
will extricate themselves from
their presently untenable
position — that of blindly
conserving authority, tradition,
and order in a state moving fast
toward socialism. They will
become radicals, intent on a
drastic reformation of their
society."

With the visit to Stanford
tomorrow of renowned
conservative William Buckley
serving as a catalyst, scholars on
both ends of the political
spectrum would do well to ask
just what are the affirmative
aspects of ideological
conservatism.
Buckley is known for his
eloquent aimings at the foibles
of modern liberalism, and indeed
most of his conservative
brethren spend a good portion
of their time lambasting the
other side. Little, however, is
heard of the principles
conservatism stands for — why.
Libertarian Edith Efron
examines these questions in the
October issue of The
Alternative. Her conclusions
should not give heart to the
conservatives.
Her research into conservative
philosophical writings found

them to end with "perorations on
Society woven around such
concepts as God, Authority,
Order, Tradition, Duty,
Patriotism, and so on. Never
were these Platonic abstractions
derived in any rational way; they
were just asserted as self-evident
truths."
In short, she writes,
conservative ideology "appeared
to be an implacable dedication
to the status quo dressed up as
metaphysics."
Statists shun freedom
Despite the cries of modern
conservatives over the
individual's plight vis a vis big
government, Efron finds their
philosophy inherently
anti-individual, with reverence
for the "primacy of the organic
community."
She continues, "What kind of
philosophy was this, I wondered,
that cannot grasp the primacy of
the individual mind, its right to
self-assertion, to thought, to
value judgments, to self-interest
— its right to flout tradition, if
that tradition is fatuous or
irrational, its right to repudiate
authority, if that authority is
imbecile or immoral, its right to
destroy order, if that order is
unjust or malignant?"

a vestige of Calvinism," Efron
says.
Thus not based on principles
of individual liberty, many
conservatives' inclinations
toward economic
self-betterment know no bounds
on infringment on the liberty of
others. Writes Efron:
"Conservatives have paid
desperate penalties for the core

contradiction at the heart of
their philosophy, and for the
mystical epistemology which
renders its principles impotent.
One of these penalties is the
political disaster called
Watergate. For the tragic truth —
the many honest and morally
distinguished conservatives
notwithstanding — is that
Watergate is a
conservative phenomenon."
Base deteriorates
•And it is one which has led to
further disintegration of the
already-evaporating ideological
base for conservatism, a decay
which has paralleled remarkably
the downfall of organized
religion in the United States.
It is this atrophy which has
forced conservatives to stoop
from the intellectual heights of a
Robert Taft in 1952 to the
depths of anti-ideology trade
unionism and demagoguery in
the person of a George Wallace a
generation later.
Sadly, some intelligent young
conservatives, such as those from
Stanford who will dine with
Buckley tomorrow night, fail to
perceive the hollowness of their
philosophical foundation. For
them, Efron has this advice:
"If they want a future at all,
young conservatives must take
their own libertarian tradition
seriously. When they do, they
will extricate themselves from
their presently untenable
position — that of blindly
conserving authority, tradition,
and order in a state moving fast
toward socialism. They will
become radicals, intent on a
drastic reformation of their
society."

With the visit to Stanford
tomorrow of renowned
conservative William Buckley
serving as a catalyst, scholars on
both ends of the political
spectrum would do well to ask
just what are the affirmative
aspects of ideological
conservatism.
Buckley is known for his
eloquent aimings at the foibles
of modern liberalism, and indeed
most of his conservative
brethren spend a good portion
of their time lambasting the
other side. Little, however, is
heard of the principles
conservatism stands for — why.
Libertarian Edith Efron
examines these questions in the
October issue of The
Alternative. Her conclusions
should not give heart to the
conservatives.
Her research into conservative
philosophical writings found

them to end with "perorations on
Society woven around such
concepts as God, Authority,
Order, Tradition, Duty,
Patriotism, and so on. Never
were these Platonic abstractions
derived in any rational way; they
were just asserted as self-evident
truths."
In short, she writes,
conservative ideology "appeared
to be an implacable dedication
to the status quo dressed up as
metaphysics."
Statists shun freedom
Despite the cries of modern
conservatives over the
individual's plight vis a vis big
government, Efron finds their
philosophy inherently
anti-individual, with reverence
for the "primacy of the organic
community."
She continues, "What kind of
philosophy was this, I wondered,
that cannot grasp the primacy of
the individual mind, its right to
self-assertion, to thought, to
value judgments, to self-interest
— its right to flout tradition, if
that tradition is fatuous or
irrational, its right to repudiate
authority, if that authority is
imbecile or immoral, its right to
destroy order, if that order is
unjust or malignant?"
Efron claims that according
to conservative author James
Burnham, conservatives "believe
such ideas as these: man is often
irrational; reason, science, and
education, accordingly, cannot
solve many or most human
problems; certain races, in
particular, are presently less
educable than others: .. . the
social cohesion of [the] organic
community is far more
important than free thought,
free speech, free academic
inquiry, and free dissent, which
threaten its stability. ..

"Indeed, Burnham granted
that liberals perceive such ideas
as 'fascist.' But that is not a silly
perception: there is a
fascist-Hegelian strain in
conservative thought, just as
there is a socialist-Marxist strain
in liberal thought."
What, then, is "affirmative"
conservatism? To Efron it "is
the same 'affirmative'
metaphysics and social

philosophy that has underlain all
theocracies since the days of the
cave man. .. When I examined
this 'affirmative' social theology
carefully, I discovered that it is
organized to combat one
central evil — the individual and
his unfettered mind."
Work ethic kept
The conservative remains true
to individual freedom in only
one area: economics. But he
derives this belief not from an
underlying devotion to
individual liberty, Efron
maintains, but from religious
origins. "For most conservatives,
support for the Horatio Alger,
free enterprise tradition is really
a vestige of Calvinism," Efron
says.
Thus not based on principles
