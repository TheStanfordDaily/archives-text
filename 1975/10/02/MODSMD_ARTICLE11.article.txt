Fads and fakery

Editor:
I am glad to see that in the
same issue of the Daily (Sept.
29), in which it announces a new
editorial direction for the Daily,
it seems to have instituted a
humor page. 1 refer, of course,
to the full-page advertisement by
the scientologists.
Daily readers might like to
know that a very good
explanation of Scientology,
dianetics and engrains is
available in a chapter (on Ron
Hubbard and dianetics) in
Martin Gardner's Fads and
Fallacies in the Name of Science
(Dover Publications). Gardner is
the well-known editor of the
Mathematical Games section of
Scientific American .
I breathlessly await other
full-page advertisements from
the flat-earth people and the
astrologers.

Ford too liberal?
Editor:
Hurrah and a loud cry of joy
for the students who
''protested" Gerald Ford at his
Sept. 21 appearance at the
Stanford Law School dedication.
It is time to speak out and to
give Ford what he deserves — a
confrontation, or a swift kick
out of office — the presidency.
I'm glad to see that the
students at the University of
Pennsylvania also protested the
absurd antics of Gerald Ford.
I am a conservative-type
protestor, but I'm always glad
when anyone — even liberals —
criticizes Ford.

Only humans err
I protest the inaccuracy of
the headline "Computer muffs
PTRs" which appeared on the
front page of the Oct. 1 Daily. It
is clear that one or more humans
made the errors and that the
computer performed exactly as
it was instructed.
Blaming the errors on the
computer is like blaming a
megaphone for cussing because
the person operating it used
obscene language.
