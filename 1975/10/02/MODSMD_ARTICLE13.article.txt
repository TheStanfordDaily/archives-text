# Clergy must join mundane life
## 
### 
Maurice Cardinal Feltin,
former Archbishop of Paris, died
early this week. His obituary
probably would not have caught
my attention more than any
other except that the New York
Times headline said he had "led
worker-priests."
Interested to discover what
that exactly meant, I read
further and found that Felton
and other French cardinals had
adopted the livelihood of the
working class during the

mid-1940s through mid 19505.
Donning overalls rather than
traditional cassocks, these priests
chose to live the life of a worker,
attempting to share and
understand more clearly the
problems of these laborers.
This unique attempt to deal
with everyday life probably
would have gone unnoticed
because of its trifling size (it
never involved more than 100
priests), but it posed certain
ecclesiastical problems within

the Roman Catholic Church.
These problems led to
suppression of the movement in
1954, focusing discussion on the
central issue of the relation
between the clergyman and the
layman, or more generally, the
role of the Roman Church in the
mundane world.
This same problem remains
today, perhaps increased because
of the complexities of modern
life induced by technological
change. Then there's inflation,
recession, busing'and increased
crime rates with which we must
cope.
Just as most students at the
Stanford Country Club can
easily forget the problems of the
real world, members of the
clergy may find it difficult to
relate to these problems in a
religious context.
In Feltin's day it was the
working class's drifting from
religion that inspired his efforts.
But now it is the need for
religion to remain relevant in an
every-changing society.
Religion cannot survive if it
fails to address issues that affect
the everyday lives of people.
If one is a victim of
unemployment or racism, if one
is bothered by killings or
starvation, then one's religion
must respond to these situations
if it is to have any meaning at
all.
And it must respond with
more than requiring faith or a

Bruce Kadden

"turn the other cheek"
philosophy. Many people are
getting too damn tired of
turning the other cheek, only to
receive another blow.
Of course it is not necessary
for today's clergyman to get
assembly-line jobs or other
blue-collar employment as Feltin
did. They were responding to a
particularly severe alienation of
the working class from the
Roman Church.
It is also not necessary to
completely abandon rituals or
corrupt the religion to the
extent that it is no longer
consistent with the scriptures
and fundamental principles on
which it is based.
History has shown that there
is plenty of room for evolution
and occasionally revolution
within each religion.
Certainly Feltin's efforts can
be considered an attempt to
expand the accepted methods
linking the clergy to the
mundane world in order to
better understand its problems.
Continued creative efforts are
necessary in order to assure that
clergymen remain in touch with
the problems which afflict the
average person. Religion has
played a significant role through
the years, but will only continue
to play an important role if it
remains meaningful.

mundane world.
This same problem remains
today, perhaps increased because
of the complexities of modern
life induced by technological
change. Then there's inflation,
recession, busing'and increased
crime rates with which we must
cope.
Just as most students at the
Stanford Country Club can
easily forget the problems of the
real world, members of the
clergy may find it difficult to
relate to these problems in a
religious context.
In Feltin's day it was the
working class's drifting from
religion that inspired his efforts.
But now it is the need for
religion to remain relevant in an
every-changing society.
Religion cannot survive if it
fails to address issues that affect
the everyday lives of people.
If one is a victim of
unemployment or racism, if one
is bothered by killings or
starvation, then one's religion
must respond to these situations
if it is to have any meaning at
all.
And it must respond with
more than requiring faith or a

"turn the other cheek"
philosophy. Many people are
getting too damn tired of
turning the other cheek, only to
receive another blow.
Of course it is not necessary
for today's clergyman to get
assembly-line jobs or other
blue-collar employment as Feltin
did. They were responding to a
particularly severe alienation of
the working class from the
Roman Church.
It is also not necessary to
completely abandon rituals or
corrupt the religion to the
extent that it is no longer
consistent with the scriptures
and fundamental principles on
which it is based.
History has shown that there
is plenty of room for evolution
and occasionally revolution
within each religion.
Certainly Feltin's efforts can
be considered an attempt to
expand the accepted methods
linking the clergy to the
mundane world in order to
better understand its problems.
Continued creative efforts are
necessary in order to assure that
clergymen remain in touch with
the problems which afflict the
average person. Religion has
played a significant role through
the years, but will only continue
to play an important role if it
remains meaningful.

Maurice Cardinal Feltin,
former Archbishop of Paris, died
early this week. His obituary
probably would not have caught
my attention more than any
other except that the New York
Times headline said he had "led
worker-priests."
Interested to discover what
that exactly meant, I read
further and found that Felton
and other French cardinals had
adopted the livelihood of the
working class during the

mid-1940s through mid 19505.
Donning overalls rather than
traditional cassocks, these priests
chose to live the life of a worker,
attempting to share and
understand more clearly the
problems of these laborers.
This unique attempt to deal
with everyday life probably
would have gone unnoticed
because of its trifling size (it
never involved more than 100
priests), but it posed certain
ecclesiastical problems within

the Roman Catholic Church.
These problems led to
suppression of the movement in
1954, focusing discussion on the
central issue of the relation
between the clergyman and the
layman, or more generally, the
role of the Roman Church in the
mundane world.
