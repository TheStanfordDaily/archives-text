## Lag kitchen is 'Roy's Boys Club' 
### PETER WINIK 
The sign inthedishroom reads, "Roy's Boys'Club: Cleanliness Is
Next To Godliness." For Roy Dominguez, the colorful and eccen
tric potwasher for the Lagunita Food Service, the students he works
with are his "boys."
Dominguez sees himself as the self-appointed sage of the
Lagunita kitchen. "I have given good advice, and the students have
taken advantage of it, and they've done pretty good with it,"he
cryptically explains.
"I advise them on how to look for work," he continued. "Some
times they come to me and ask, 'what can I do?' I've sent them to
look in different places."
Hasher Jim Gibson says,"He doesn't talk a lot unless you ask him
something. Then, he'll always have an answer." He admits, how
ever, that Dominguez's answers "often don't make much sense."
"I told him I was interested in journalism," Gibson adds, "and he
told me he had helped a lot of students into journalism. Then he
told me, 'if you're smart, you can do anything,' and by the time he
was done he was telling me how he had almost overthrown Gen.
Franco in Spain."
Vivid imagination
Dominguez is a man with a vivid imagination, which combined
with his 52 years of life's experiences make him a formidible story
teller.
He has stories which date back to his experiences before he was
born, in a small Texas town. Dominguez claims a church stands
there in honor of he and his mother.
"Before I was born, my mother was dragged by a bull," he
explains. "She was about to give birth to me when she was dragged
around. The administration (he doesn't say which 'administra
tion') found out about this and built a church in our honor at the
sight of my birth."
The deeply-etched lines in Dominguez's face, the thick gray hair
and the toughened hands indicate that he has led a hard but active
life.
When he talks of "The War," his eyes narrow and his voice drops.
The presence of a plate of metal in his skull lends credibility to at
least some of his tales.
War tales
As he drowns the food on his tray with a generous amount of
tabasco sauce, he tells how he was woundecf.
"It was a barrage of artillery that got us about ten miles from
Paris. I had to sit in a hospital in Germany for two months after I was
wounded. They didn't put the plate in until way after I had been
returned to the States."
Dominquez pulls up his left sleeve, revealing a long scar on his
left wrist which he says he received in North Africa. "I got it in
a bayonet fight with the Germans," he explains.
He interrupts his tales for a moment to get some more food. When

he is out of earshot a cook warns, "You better watch out tor Koy.
He's quite a liar.
He s a character, but you've got to take him with a grain of salt."
German trapper
In North Africa, Dominguez says he was a staff sergeant in com
mand of nine men. "We had to go into a town to clean it out of
Germans. 1 think I got about 30 of them myself," he recalls.
"We also captured some Germans while we were
there . . . altogether we got 500 of them. For this." he explains, "1
was decorated with the Silver Star."
Dominguez's days as the master German trapper of the United
States Third Infantry Division did not end in North Africa. While
fighting in Sicily he says, "We captured what I understood to be
a whole division of Germans."
After he left the Army, Dominguez became a carpenter and went
into business with his two brothers, but quit when "the doctor told
me to quit working and to relax."
"I have to be doing something ... I like to be active," he says,
explaining why he "came out of retirement" to work at Stanford
nine years ago.
Lively dishroom
Dominguez livens up the dishroom at times, joking and talking
with the other workers.
"Hey Kathy," he yells to a late hasher on a Sunday morning.
"How come you're late?" He turns to a nearby male hasher and
muses, "She was probably with her boyfriend, and got stuck to the
sheets." This soon branched out into a more general and more
perverted conversation.
"He communicates with the other workers the best through sing
ing," Gibson says. "He's often singing some kind of song, and a few
that we know we sing along with."
"I sing football songs, Spanish songs, Italian songs, and even
some German songs," Dominguez says.
Dominguez best remembers working with Jim Plunkett, when
the quarterback was an All-American at Stanford. He especially
recalls one "garbage fight" they had.
'A lot of fun'
"We had a lot of fun then," he says. "After he left that night, the
whole place was covered with food, from floor to ceiling.
"Plunkett and I used to joke around a lot. . . you know, talk about
the games and all."
In his 10 years at Stanford, Dominguez has worked with hun
dreds ol students. "Most of the hashers have been very
intelligent . . . They all said I worked pretty good," he modestly
admits, "and that I treated them the right way "
Dominguez says many of his former co-workers are still in con
tact with him. "I hear from quite a few in different states. They write
me asking me to come live with them. Someday," he says,"I might
take one of them up."

He s a character, but you've got to take him with a grain of salt."
German trapper
In North Africa, Dominguez says he was a staff sergeant in com
mand of nine men. "We had to go into a town to clean it out of
Germans. 1 think I got about 30 of them myself," he recalls.
"We also captured some Germans while we were
there . . . altogether we got 500 of them. For this." he explains, "1
was decorated with the Silver Star."
Dominguez's days as the master German trapper of the United
States Third Infantry Division did not end in North Africa. While
fighting in Sicily he says, "We captured what I understood to be
a whole division of Germans."
After he left the Army, Dominguez became a carpenter and went
into business with his two brothers, but quit when "the doctor told
me to quit working and to relax."
"I have to be doing something ... I like to be active," he says,
explaining why he "came out of retirement" to work at Stanford
nine years ago.
Lively dishroom
Dominguez livens up the dishroom at times, joking and talking
with the other workers.
"Hey Kathy," he yells to a late hasher on a Sunday morning.
"How come you're late?" He turns to a nearby male hasher and
muses, "She was probably with her boyfriend, and got stuck to the
sheets." This soon branched out into a more general and more
perverted conversation.
"He communicates with the other workers the best through sing
ing," Gibson says. "He's often singing some kind of song, and a few
that we know we sing along with."
"I sing football songs, Spanish songs, Italian songs, and even
some German songs," Dominguez says.
Dominguez best remembers working with Jim Plunkett, when
the quarterback was an All-American at Stanford. He especially
recalls one "garbage fight" they had.
'A lot of fun'
"We had a lot of fun then," he says. "After he left that night, the
whole place was covered with food, from floor to ceiling.
"Plunkett and I used to joke around a lot. . . you know, talk about
the games and all."
In his 10 years at Stanford, Dominguez has worked with hun
dreds ol students. "Most of the hashers have been very
intelligent . . . They all said I worked pretty good," he modestly
admits, "and that I treated them the right way "
Dominguez says many of his former co-workers are still in con
tact with him. "I hear from quite a few in different states. They write
me asking me to come live with them. Someday," he says,"I might
take one of them up."

LOVE SONG — Woody Allen
embraces Diane Keaton as he
pledges his undying love to her
in this scene from the movie
Love and Death. The soundtrack
of the movie was by Prokofiev.
Selections were taken from
"Alexander Nevsky" for the war
scene and "Classical Sym
phony" for the ballroom and
opera scenes. For further de
tails, see today's "Bug Me."
The sign inthedishroom reads, "Roy's Boys'Club: Cleanliness Is
Next To Godliness." For Roy Dominguez, the colorful and eccen
tric potwasher for the Lagunita Food Service, the students he works
with are his "boys."
Dominguez sees himself as the self-appointed sage of the
Lagunita kitchen. "I have given good advice, and the students have
taken advantage of it, and they've done pretty good with it,"he
cryptically explains.
"I advise them on how to look for work," he continued. "Some
times they come to me and ask, 'what can I do?' I've sent them to
look in different places."
Hasher Jim Gibson says,"He doesn't talk a lot unless you ask him
something. Then, he'll always have an answer." He admits, how
ever, that Dominguez's answers "often don't make much sense."
"I told him I was interested in journalism," Gibson adds, "and he
told me he had helped a lot of students into journalism. Then he
told me, 'if you're smart, you can do anything,' and by the time he
was done he was telling me how he had almost overthrown Gen.
Franco in Spain."
Vivid imagination
Dominguez is a man with a vivid imagination, which combined
with his 52 years of life's experiences make him a formidible story
teller.
He has stories which date back to his experiences before he was
born, in a small Texas town. Dominguez claims a church stands
there in honor of he and his mother.
"Before I was born, my mother was dragged by a bull," he
explains. "She was about to give birth to me when she was dragged
around. The administration (he doesn't say which 'administra
tion') found out about this and built a church in our honor at the
sight of my birth."
The deeply-etched lines in Dominguez's face, the thick gray hair
and the toughened hands indicate that he has led a hard but active
life.
When he talks of "The War," his eyes narrow and his voice drops.
The presence of a plate of metal in his skull lends credibility to at
least some of his tales.
War tales
As he drowns the food on his tray with a generous amount of
tabasco sauce, he tells how he was woundecf.
"It was a barrage of artillery that got us about ten miles from
Paris. I had to sit in a hospital in Germany for two months after I was
wounded. They didn't put the plate in until way after I had been
returned to the States."
Dominquez pulls up his left sleeve, revealing a long scar on his
left wrist which he says he received in North Africa. "I got it in
a bayonet fight with the Germans," he explains.
He interrupts his tales for a moment to get some more food. When

he is out of earshot a cook warns, "You better watch out tor Koy.
He's quite a liar.
He s a character, but you've got to take him with a grain of salt."

The sign inthedishroom reads, "Roy's Boys'Club: Cleanliness Is
Next To Godliness." For Roy Dominguez, the colorful and eccen
tric potwasher for the Lagunita Food Service, the students he works
with are his "boys."
Dominguez sees himself as the self-appointed sage of the
Lagunita kitchen. "I have given good advice, and the students have
taken advantage of it, and they've done pretty good with it,"he
cryptically explains.
"I advise them on how to look for work," he continued. "Some
times they come to me and ask, 'what can I do?' I've sent them to
look in different places."
Hasher Jim Gibson says,"He doesn't talk a lot unless you ask him
something. Then, he'll always have an answer." He admits, how
ever, that Dominguez's answers "often don't make much sense."
"I told him I was interested in journalism," Gibson adds, "and he
told me he had helped a lot of students into journalism. Then he
told me, 'if you're smart, you can do anything,' and by the time he
was done he was telling me how he had almost overthrown Gen.
Franco in Spain."
Vivid imagination
Dominguez is a man with a vivid imagination, which combined
with his 52 years of life's experiences make him a formidible story
teller.
He has stories which date back to his experiences before he was
born, in a small Texas town. Dominguez claims a church stands
there in honor of he and his mother.
"Before I was born, my mother was dragged by a bull," he
explains. "She was about to give birth to me when she was dragged
around. The administration (he doesn't say which 'administra
tion') found out about this and built a church in our honor at the
sight of my birth."
The deeply-etched lines in Dominguez's face, the thick gray hair
and the toughened hands indicate that he has led a hard but active
life.
When he talks of "The War," his eyes narrow and his voice drops.
The presence of a plate of metal in his skull lends credibility to at
least some of his tales.
War tales
As he drowns the food on his tray with a generous amount of
tabasco sauce, he tells how he was woundecf.
"It was a barrage of artillery that got us about ten miles from
Paris. I had to sit in a hospital in Germany for two months after I was
wounded. They didn't put the plate in until way after I had been
returned to the States."
Dominquez pulls up his left sleeve, revealing a long scar on his
left wrist which he says he received in North Africa. "I got it in
a bayonet fight with the Germans," he explains.
He interrupts his tales for a moment to get some more food. When

he is out of earshot a cook warns, "You better watch out tor Koy.
He's quite a liar.
He s a character, but you've got to take him with a grain of salt."
German trapper
In North Africa, Dominguez says he was a staff sergeant in com
mand of nine men. "We had to go into a town to clean it out of
Germans. 1 think I got about 30 of them myself," he recalls.
"We also captured some Germans while we were
there . . . altogether we got 500 of them. For this." he explains, "1
was decorated with the Silver Star."
Dominguez's days as the master German trapper of the United
States Third Infantry Division did not end in North Africa. While
fighting in Sicily he says, "We captured what I understood to be
a whole division of Germans."
After he left the Army, Dominguez became a carpenter and went
into business with his two brothers, but quit when "the doctor told
me to quit working and to relax."
"I have to be doing something ... I like to be active," he says,
explaining why he "came out of retirement" to work at Stanford
nine years ago.
Lively dishroom
Dominguez livens up the dishroom at times, joking and talking
with the other workers.
"Hey Kathy," he yells to a late hasher on a Sunday morning.
"How come you're late?" He turns to a nearby male hasher and
muses, "She was probably with her boyfriend, and got stuck to the
sheets." This soon branched out into a more general and more
perverted conversation.
"He communicates with the other workers the best through sing
ing," Gibson says. "He's often singing some kind of song, and a few
that we know we sing along with."
"I sing football songs, Spanish songs, Italian songs, and even
some German songs," Dominguez says.
Dominguez best remembers working with Jim Plunkett, when
the quarterback was an All-American at Stanford. He especially
recalls one "garbage fight" they had.
'A lot of fun'
"We had a lot of fun then," he says. "After he left that night, the
whole place was covered with food, from floor to ceiling.
"Plunkett and I used to joke around a lot. . . you know, talk about
the games and all."
In his 10 years at Stanford, Dominguez has worked with hun
dreds ol students. "Most of the hashers have been very
intelligent . . . They all said I worked pretty good," he modestly
admits, "and that I treated them the right way "
Dominguez says many of his former co-workers are still in con
tact with him. "I hear from quite a few in different states. They write
me asking me to come live with them. Someday," he says,"I might
take one of them up."
