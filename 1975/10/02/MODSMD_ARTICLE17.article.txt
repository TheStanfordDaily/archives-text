The music in the rnovie 'Love and Death' was by Prokofiev. Could
you find out exactly what works of Prokofiev were used? The music
is beautiful. -M.R.
The score contained parts from two different works by Prokofiev
— "Alexander Nevsky" and"The Classical Symphony." Specifi
cally, the war scene was accompanied by a section from "Nevsky"
called "Battle on the Ice." "The Classical Symphony" came in
during the ballroom scenes and the opera.

Whot is that song thut the Band plays over and over at football
games? It was played every time we scored a point. -F.R.
The song is called "Come Join the Band," and the non-obscene
lyrics (consult the Stanford Band for any others) go like this:
Come join the band
And give a cheer for Stanford red.
Throughout the land,
Our banners waving overhead.
Stanford for you,
Our loyal comrades brave and true.
With might and main, sing this refrain,
Forever and forever, Stanford red.
Next time you're at a game, stand up and sing it lustily. With that
kind of spirit we might even beat the big ones — like San Jose State.

I am good-looking and I dress well and I use the right kinds of
deodorant and aftershave and mouthwash, and I have read and
even memorized books about how to pick up girls, and I go to a
singles bar and start talking ivith a girl, doing everything right, and
after just a few minutes she realizes what an asshole I am, and it's
all over. What am I doing wrong? -D.E.
I wouldn't know about things like that. However, there is now a
specialist in these affairs on the Daily staff. Dave Ansley, who
writes the brand new and highly stimulating sex column called
"Under Covers" can lay out what you need to know. Hope you
make out better with him.
