# Hoover carillon: in a dark musty corner it makes such a clatter but out in White Plaza it's the music that matters
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Almost to the top of Hoover
Tower is a dark, musty room
filled with yellowed
uncatalogued papers and dusty
boxes of books. The carillon sits
upon a wooden pedestal in the
middle of the room, seemingly
incongruous with the rest of the
clutter.
The carillon looks like a
simplified, almost crude version
of the piano, with its wooden
keyboard and footpedals. Metal
wires connect the carillon to a
set of 35 caged bells on the floor
above.
If the instrument appears
simple and crude, the sound it
produces is the antithesis. A
three-octave range and manual
volume control make the bells
ring out at lunchtime,
afternoons, weddings, special
occassions or whenever a
carillonneur wants to play, with
any type of music ranging from
original carillon compositions to
early folk to popular rock.
Little known
Senior Joan Ferguson, a
University carillonneur, says that
most people don't even know
that the carillon is played by
"human beings."
Ferguson began studying the
carillon about a year and a half
ago with fellow carillonneur and
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Angell.
Angell says that there are

approximately 200 registered
members in the Guild of
Carillonneurs in North America,
and there are about 160 manual
cast bells in North America, 15
to 20 in Canada. Guild members
often compose original music for
the carillon; otherwise they play
arrangements of music for other
instruments.
Time chimes
As an instrument, the carillon
has a rather unusual history.
Angell explains that the bells
"go back to Christ's time," and
were used to tell the time of
day.
"In the 12th century people
learned to cast single bells that
sounded good, and then the
Germans learned to hang bells to
swing and ring and blend sound.
In the Netherlands, they were
cast to create polyphony
112 multiplicity of sounds]."
He adds that the art was lost
in the 19th century, then revived
in the 20th. Ferguson says that
in World War 11, bells were often
melted down to make tanks.
Gift of appreciation
Hoover's bells have a unique
history in themselves. Angell
says that they were originally cast
in Belgium for the 1939 New
York World's Fair, and at the
end of the fair, were given to
Stanford for the Hoover
Institution "in appreciation for the
rehabilitative work of Herbert
Hoover after World War I — he
helped rebuild Western Europe."
Playing the carilion takes a
lot of coordination, dexterity
and, if the piece is fast, is quite a
physical workout. The player
sits on a bench with hands in
front of the keyboard and feet
on the "pedals." The levers of
the keyboard are played "with
the fleshy part of the hand,"
says Ferguson — the player
makes a relaxed fist and hits the
appropriate lever. The feet are
moving around at the same time,
hitting the appropriate pedals.
Meanwhile wires and levers
pull the bell clappers against the
bells, which remain stationary,
and — voila! Beautiful music.
But the music is only
beautiful if you're anywhere but

in that dark musty room, for the
carillon makes a terrible clatter
as the wires pull the levers and
clappers.
Although Ferguson is a
relative novice at the carillon,
she says she doesn't get nervous
playing and knowing that all
those people are listening for
miles. Nor do visitors — who are
welcome to visit the carillon
room and bother the
carillonneurs with questions —
make her nervous.
She admits to occasional
mistakes, but when that
happens, as any musician knows,
it's "best to cover up and keep
going."
Music lovers
Neither Ferguson, Angell or
the other University carilloneurs
get paid for playing — Ferguson
does it because she loves music,
particularly Renaissance and
Baroque.
She also plays the
harpsichord and recorder, and

recently, with friends, built a
self-hammered dulcimer. During
the school year she tries to play
about four times a week, and has
received academic credit for it as
an independent study.
Ferguson hopes to graduate

after fall quarter, and then
would like to go to carillon
school abroad (yes, there are
such things).
"Anyway," she grins, "it's a
good excuse to go to Europe."

an accomplished carilloneur. Her favorite music is from the early periods, but other carillonneurs play
arrangements of rock music.

of the piano, with its wooden
keyboard and footpedals. Metal
wires connect the carillon to a
set of 35 caged bells on the floor
above.
If the instrument appears
simple and crude, the sound it
produces is the antithesis. A
three-octave range and manual
volume control make the bells
ring out at lunchtime,
afternoons, weddings, special
occassions or whenever a
carillonneur wants to play, with
any type of music ranging from
original carillon compositions to
early folk to popular rock.
Little known
Senior Joan Ferguson, a
University carillonneur, says that
most people don't even know
that the carillon is played by
"human beings."
Ferguson began studying the
carillon about a year and a half
ago with fellow carillonneur and
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Angell.
Angell says that there are

approximately 200 registered
members in the Guild of
Carillonneurs in North America,
and there are about 160 manual
cast bells in North America, 15
to 20 in Canada. Guild members
often compose original music for
the carillon; otherwise they play
arrangements of music for other
instruments.
Time chimes
As an instrument, the carillon
has a rather unusual history.
Angell explains that the bells
"go back to Christ's time," and
were used to tell the time of
day.
"In the 12th century people
learned to cast single bells that
sounded good, and then the
Germans learned to hang bells to
swing and ring and blend sound.
In the Netherlands, they were
cast to create polyphony
112 multiplicity of sounds]."
He adds that the art was lost
in the 19th century, then revived
in the 20th. Ferguson says that
in World War 11, bells were often
melted down to make tanks.
Gift of appreciation
Hoover's bells have a unique
history in themselves. Angell
says that they were originally cast
in Belgium for the 1939 New
York World's Fair, and at the
end of the fair, were given to
Stanford for the Hoover
Institution "in appreciation for the
rehabilitative work of Herbert
Hoover after World War I — he
helped rebuild Western Europe."
Playing the carilion takes a
lot of coordination, dexterity
and, if the piece is fast, is quite a
physical workout. The player
sits on a bench with hands in
front of the keyboard and feet
on the "pedals." The levers of
the keyboard are played "with
the fleshy part of the hand,"
says Ferguson — the player
makes a relaxed fist and hits the
appropriate lever. The feet are
moving around at the same time,
hitting the appropriate pedals.
Meanwhile wires and levers
pull the bell clappers against the
bells, which remain stationary,
and — voila! Beautiful music.
But the music is only
beautiful if you're anywhere but

in that dark musty room, for the
carillon makes a terrible clatter
as the wires pull the levers and
clappers.
Although Ferguson is a
relative novice at the carillon,
she says she doesn't get nervous
playing and knowing that all
those people are listening for
miles. Nor do visitors — who are
welcome to visit the carillon
room and bother the
carillonneurs with questions —
make her nervous.
She admits to occasional
mistakes, but when that
happens, as any musician knows,
it's "best to cover up and keep
going."
Music lovers
Neither Ferguson, Angell or
the other University carilloneurs
get paid for playing — Ferguson
does it because she loves music,
particularly Renaissance and
Baroque.
She also plays the
harpsichord and recorder, and

recently, with friends, built a
self-hammered dulcimer. During
the school year she tries to play
about four times a week, and has
received academic credit for it as
an independent study.
Ferguson hopes to graduate

after fall quarter, and then
would like to go to carillon
school abroad (yes, there are
such things).
"Anyway," she grins, "it's a
good excuse to go to Europe."

any type of music ranging from
original carillon compositions to
early folk to popular rock.
Little known
Senior Joan Ferguson, a
University carillonneur, says that
most people don't even know
that the carillon is played by
"human beings."
Ferguson began studying the
carillon about a year and a half
ago with fellow carillonneur and
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Angell.
Angell says that there are

approximately 200 registered
members in the Guild of
Carillonneurs in North America,
and there are about 160 manual
cast bells in North America, 15
to 20 in Canada. Guild members
often compose original music for
the carillon; otherwise they play
arrangements of music for other
instruments.
Time chimes
As an instrument, the carillon
has a rather unusual history.
Angell explains that the bells
"go back to Christ's time," and
were used to tell the time of
day.
"In the 12th century people
learned to cast single bells that
sounded good, and then the
Germans learned to hang bells to
swing and ring and blend sound.
In the Netherlands, they were
cast to create polyphony
112 multiplicity of sounds]."
He adds that the art was lost
in the 19th century, then revived
in the 20th. Ferguson says that
in World War 11, bells were often
melted down to make tanks.
Gift of appreciation
Hoover's bells have a unique
history in themselves. Angell
says that they were originally cast
in Belgium for the 1939 New
York World's Fair, and at the
end of the fair, were given to
Stanford for the Hoover
Institution "in appreciation for the
rehabilitative work of Herbert
Hoover after World War I — he
helped rebuild Western Europe."
Playing the carilion takes a
lot of coordination, dexterity
and, if the piece is fast, is quite a
physical workout. The player
sits on a bench with hands in
front of the keyboard and feet
on the "pedals." The levers of
the keyboard are played "with
the fleshy part of the hand,"
says Ferguson — the player
makes a relaxed fist and hits the
appropriate lever. The feet are
moving around at the same time,
hitting the appropriate pedals.
Meanwhile wires and levers
pull the bell clappers against the
bells, which remain stationary,
and — voila! Beautiful music.
But the music is only
beautiful if you're anywhere but

in that dark musty room, for the
carillon makes a terrible clatter
as the wires pull the levers and
clappers.
Although Ferguson is a
relative novice at the carillon,
she says she doesn't get nervous
playing and knowing that all
those people are listening for
miles. Nor do visitors — who are
welcome to visit the carillon
room and bother the
carillonneurs with questions —
make her nervous.
She admits to occasional
mistakes, but when that
happens, as any musician knows,
it's "best to cover up and keep
going."
Music lovers
Neither Ferguson, Angell or
the other University carilloneurs
get paid for playing — Ferguson
does it because she loves music,
particularly Renaissance and
Baroque.
She also plays the
harpsichord and recorder, and

recently, with friends, built a
self-hammered dulcimer. During
the school year she tries to play
about four times a week, and has
received academic credit for it as
an independent study.
Ferguson hopes to graduate

after fall quarter, and then
would like to go to carillon
school abroad (yes, there are
such things).
"Anyway," she grins, "it's a
good excuse to go to Europe."

CLATTERING CLAPPERS—As Joan Ferguson plays the carillon
keyboard, wires and levers pull the bell clappers on the floor above.


MUSIC LOVER—Ferguson has been playing the carillon only a year and half, but already she's
an accomplished carilloneur. Her favorite music is from the early periods, but other carillonneurs play
arrangements of rock music.

RING-A-DING-DlNG—Hoover's bells are located almost at the tip
of the tower, and are caged within an extensive metal framework.
If one is standing right beside the bells, as visitors may do if they
wish, the sound if deafening, but anywhere else on campus, its
music to the ears.
Almost to the top of Hoover
Tower is a dark, musty room
filled with yellowed
uncatalogued papers and dusty
boxes of books. The carillon sits
upon a wooden pedestal in the
middle of the room, seemingly
incongruous with the rest of the
clutter.
The carillon looks like a
simplified, almost crude version
of the piano, with its wooden
keyboard and footpedals. Metal
wires connect the carillon to a
set of 35 caged bells on the floor
above.
If the instrument appears
simple and crude, the sound it
produces is the antithesis. A
three-octave range and manual
volume control make the bells
ring out at lunchtime,
afternoons, weddings, special
occassions or whenever a
carillonneur wants to play, with
any type of music ranging from
original carillon compositions to
early folk to popular rock.
