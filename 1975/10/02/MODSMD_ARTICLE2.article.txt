# Fee for Lake put on ballot
## 
### 
A proposed $1 fee assessment to
improve Lagunita Boathouse will be
placed on this month's ASSU Senate
election ballot. Over 1200 students
signed petitions of support for the
assessment at registration last Monday.
Financial manager Chris Cline, who
has been coordinating the project,
explained that the $10,000 raised by
the fee would be used to provide
sunbathing floats, beach sand,
barbeque pits, and possibly a sand
volleyball court. All of these
improvements would be in addition to
the structural renovation of the
boathouse which will bring the facility
in line with 29 safety codes.
The cost of the renovation, about
$40,000 is being shared by the
University and the ASSU, with
$15,000 coming from ASSU reserves,
$15,000 from the Provost's office, and
the balance from the proposed fee
assessment.
Although the added fee would not
be collected until Spring quarter, work
will begin immediately if the proposal
is approved; students would be
employed for a majority of the
construction work.
"I don't really care if the
assessment passes, but if the students
want it, then it's fine," commented
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum.
He added that the idea of the
election is "to prove if the students
want to spend $10,000." Rosenbaum
says he'll vote for the measure and
that "it's not a bad idea; the only
question in my mind is whether it is
really worth the money."
