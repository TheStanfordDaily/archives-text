# Government reports upsurge in number of marijuana users

WASHINGTON (AP) —
Youths experimenting with
marijuana at an earlier age are
contributing to an alarming up
swing in the nation's drug abuse
problem, the government re
ported Wednesday.
Dr. Robert L. DuPont, director
of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, told reporters he was
quite alarmed about the growing
use of marijuana among young
people.
He speculated that use was in
creasing because marijuana is
more readily available now and
because of the "contagious
phenomena" that challenges
nonusers to follow their friends'
example.
The institute released four
new surveys costing $2.2 mill
ion that indicated:
— Marijuana use among

12-to-17-year-olds almost dou
bled between 1972 and 1974.
— Fifty-five percent of the
three million high school
seniors in the class of 1975 ex
perimented with illegal drugs,
and two-thirds thought mari
juana use should be legal or only
a minor violation.
— About 300,000 of the 19
million young men aged 20 to 30
years used heroin within the last
year, another one to two million
used other illegal drugs and
seven million smoked mari
juana.
DuPont, who once acknow
ledged that he tried marijuana
himself out of ignorance of pos

sible health consequences, said
criminal penalties are not the
answer and he supports the
growing trend among states to
decriminalize marijuana use.
"Putting people in prison is
not a good idea," he said.
DuPont said, however, that
"the steady increase in the use of
licit and illicit substances is of
great concern to us.
"It is apparently inevitable
that young people are going to
experiment with cigarettes, al
cohol and marijuana, and that
this experience will lead too
many young people to a regular
pattern of undesirable use of
these drugs."

On the bright side. DuPont
told a news conference, the ma
jority of those who experiment
with drugs either stop or only
use them occasionally, and the
number of "hard core" heroin
addicts has apparently
stabilized at about 400,000 per
sons.
University of Michigan re
searchers who surveyed a ran
dom sampling of 16,000 seniors
in 130 high schools last spring
found that 55 percent had ex
perimented with illegal drugs,
45 percent had tried them within
the previous year and 31 percent
within the previous month.
