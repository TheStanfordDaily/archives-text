# Emphasis on "cultural pluralism"
## Education school begins new program 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
The Education School is
initiating a master's program this
fall designed to encourage
cultural differences in school
children and take into account
varying learning styles.
Dubbed "cultural pluralism,"
the program is intended to
attract seasoned teachers and
administrators from heavily

ethnic districts, according to
program head Prof. Alfredo
Castaneda.
Most courses will be offered
in the afternoon, evening or
summer, to enable working
instructors to fit the programs
into their schedules, Castaneda
said.
The program takes an
interdisciplinary approach to the

subject, focusing on the theme:
"social foundation with an
emphasis on cultural pluralism."
Core instructors are
Castaneda, Education and
History Prof. David Tyack, and
Asst. Education Profs. James
Deslonde and Arthur Pacheco.
'Externing'
Students will "extern" in Bay
Area schools with multicultural
programs, analyzing sex roles
and prohibitions.
Education Dean Arthur
Coladarci hopes to farm students
out to area schools bearing a
multi-cultural stamp of success
so students may contribute their
skills to the schools while
gaining field experience, and
possibly receiving compensation
to offset tuition costs as well.
It might seem that teachers
from minority districts already
know how to foster appreciation
for cultural variances, "and we
don't doubt that many of them
are far beyond us," said
Coladarci. On the other hand,
"some of them have the right
instincts, but they can't
formalize or implement them in
dealing with kids," he said.
Program coordinators
expressed hopes that the
program will prove beneficial
both to educators enrolled at the
University and those who are
not.
New Information
Castaneda said that the
master's degree program will
"put together new information

on differences among ethnic
groups in learning modes so
schools can see the needed
changes in teacher training,
curriculum development and
motivational strategies."
Graduates will act as resource
people when they return to their
communities.
The program will attack what
Coladarci and Castaneda call the
deplorable desire for
"homogenization" in society,
reflected in attempts to educate
children in a uniform manner.
Tyack, who has just
completed a book on the
subject, calls this desire the "one
best system" idea and attributes
the notion to ethnocentrism.

"It was a tremendous task to
make 35 million people into one
nation, but we went past what
was necessary as a common
denominator," Tyack said.
"Essentially, by adhering to
the main culture's traditions and
methods, we taught minority
groups to be ashamed of
themselves, and that doesn't
help motivation."
Pacheco said that "the
horrible statistics on minority
achievement" are an ultimate
result of the "one best system"
idea.
Castaneda noted that studies
have shown that children of
different backgrounds acquire
different learning styles at home
that may account for academic
lags.
For example, several years
ago, a comparison study was
made on the methods used by
Anglo-American and
Mexican-American mothers in
teaching their children how to
use an educational toy.
Different methods
Anglo-American mothers
generally encouraged their
children to figure the toy out for
themselves while
Mexican-American mothers
encouraged imitation.
Because the prevailing
philosophy of educators in the
past decade has been that it is
better for a child to learn by
himself, Mexican-American
children brought up under the
imitation method faced a

distinct disadvantage upon
entering the Anglo-American
system, Castaneda said.
When Mexican-American
children, used to the imitation
method used at home, did not
respond to the prevailing system,
schools "misinterpreted that
behavior," classifying the
children as "too dependent" and
claiming that they couldn't
initiate activities, Castaneda
stated.
"It's an example of unequal
educational opportunity," he
said.
Ideally, in Tyack's view,
children should be taught to use
all possible learning styles, and
be aware of when they are

operating under one or another.
"They may find they need
them later," Tyack said. "We all
know the way we interact in an
elite educational institution
doesn't go when we're working
in a cannery."
