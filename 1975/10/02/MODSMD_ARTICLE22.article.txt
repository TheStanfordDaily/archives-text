# SF inspector testifies: Secret Service goofed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
San Francisco police inspector
said yesterday he offered the
Secret Service pictures of Sara
Jane Moore for surveillance two
days before her apparent
attempt to assassinate President
Ford, but the agency never
picked up the photographs.
Inspector Jack O'Shea said he
offered six enlargements of
Moore's driver's license
identification photo to the
Secret Service on Saturday,
Sept. 20. The agency said the
pictures would be picked up the
following morning, O'Shea said.
Asked if they were ever
picked up, he replied, "No sir."
Shea testified at a hearing of
the Senate subcommittee on
Treasury, Postal Service and
general government
appropriations, which is

investigating the Secret Service
following two assassination
attempts on Ford within 17
days.
Two stories
The inspector also disputed a
Secret Service version of a
conversation that took place on
Sunday night, the eve of the
shooting attempt, between a
Secret Service agent and himself.
Secret Service officials said
Tuesday that their agent asked
O'Shea if they had a problem
with Moore and that
O'Shea replied that they did not.
The conversation took place
while agents Gary Yauger and
Martin Haskell were interviewing
Moore in connection with Ford's
visit to the San Francisco area.
The Secret Service agents
interviewed the woman after
being informed of her aborted

plans to attend a rally at
Stanford University protesting
Ford's visit to the campus earlier
that day.
O'Shea said that Moore called
him to express fears about the
interview and that he instructed
her to tell the truth about her
plans to visit the campus.
Yauger then called him back
and asked, "is there anything
else," O'Shea said. "I said 'no.' "
Moore told O'Shea on
Saturday that she might ask the
inspector to have her arrested
because she was armed and
planned to go to the Stanford
rally, O'Shea said.
Called FBI
O'Shea then contacted the
FBI and informed them that
Mrs. Moore was armed and
might attend the rally. O'Shea
then was contacted by the
Secret Service about Moore.
He said he told the Secret
Service, the FBI and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms that Moore might be
another Squeaky Frornme, a
reference to the young woman
who is accused of attempting to
assassinate Ford in Sacramento
Sept. 5.
"I believe 1 mentioned that to
all three," O'Shea said.
O'Shea said that in his
dealings with Moore, he felt
"she had a need for publicity,
she had a need to be accepted."
He said he knew she had

written articles for underground
publications in the San
Francsico Bay area, but that in
nine months of dealings he had
met her once.
One contact
The subcommittee also was
told today that the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
for whom Mrs. Moore acted as
an informant, had only one
contact with her, and that was
on the day before she was
charged with attempting to

assassinate Ford.
Hex D. Davis, director of the
bureau, said his agency was put
in touch with Moore
through Inspector O'Shea,
Moore then accompanied agent
Charles W. Galyan on Sunday
Sept. 21, to a meeting with a
man involved in a gun
investigation.
On Tuesday, Assistant Secret
Service Director James T. Burke
told the subcommittee that
Moore made five telephone calls

to law enforcement agencies on
the day she allegedly shot at
Ford. She called the San
Francisco field office of the
Secret Service three times and
the FBI and San Francisco
police once each Burke said.
Each time she called the
Secret Service, she asked for
agents Yauger and Hakell, who
had interviewed her the night
before, and each time she was
told they were not in the office,
Burke said.

O'Shea replied that they did not.
The conversation took place
while agents Gary Yauger and
Martin Haskell were interviewing
Moore in connection with Ford's
visit to the San Francisco area.
The Secret Service agents
interviewed the woman after
being informed of her aborted

plans to attend a rally at
Stanford University protesting
Ford's visit to the campus earlier
that day.
O'Shea said that Moore called
him to express fears about the
interview and that he instructed
her to tell the truth about her
plans to visit the campus.
Yauger then called him back
and asked, "is there anything
else," O'Shea said. "I said 'no.' "
Moore told O'Shea on
Saturday that she might ask the
inspector to have her arrested
because she was armed and
planned to go to the Stanford
rally, O'Shea said.
Called FBI
O'Shea then contacted the
FBI and informed them that
Mrs. Moore was armed and
might attend the rally. O'Shea
then was contacted by the
Secret Service about Moore.
He said he told the Secret
Service, the FBI and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms that Moore might be
another Squeaky Frornme, a
reference to the young woman
who is accused of attempting to
assassinate Ford in Sacramento
Sept. 5.
"I believe 1 mentioned that to
all three," O'Shea said.
O'Shea said that in his
dealings with Moore, he felt
"she had a need for publicity,
she had a need to be accepted."
He said he knew she had

written articles for underground
publications in the San
Francsico Bay area, but that in
nine months of dealings he had
met her once.
One contact
The subcommittee also was
told today that the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
for whom Mrs. Moore acted as
an informant, had only one
contact with her, and that was
on the day before she was
charged with attempting to

assassinate Ford.
Hex D. Davis, director of the
bureau, said his agency was put
in touch with Moore
through Inspector O'Shea,
Moore then accompanied agent
Charles W. Galyan on Sunday
Sept. 21, to a meeting with a
man involved in a gun
investigation.
On Tuesday, Assistant Secret
Service Director James T. Burke
told the subcommittee that
Moore made five telephone calls

to law enforcement agencies on
the day she allegedly shot at
Ford. She called the San
Francisco field office of the
Secret Service three times and
the FBI and San Francisco
police once each Burke said.
Each time she called the
Secret Service, she asked for
agents Yauger and Hakell, who
had interviewed her the night
before, and each time she was
told they were not in the office,
Burke said.

READY FOR TROUBLE—Security agents lined the sides of the follow-up oar during the President's
Stanford visit, ready to leap into the crowd at the first sign of trouble. According to a San Francisco
police inspector, agents were told about Sara Jane Moore, but failed to pick up the ID photos he had
prepared for them.
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
San Francisco police inspector
said yesterday he offered the
Secret Service pictures of Sara
Jane Moore for surveillance two
days before her apparent

Ford, but the agency never

another Squeaky Frornme, a
reference to the young woman
who is accused of attempting to
assassinate Ford in Sacramento
Sept. 5.
"I believe 1 mentioned that to
all three," O'Shea said.
O'Shea said that in his
dealings with Moore, he felt
"she had a need for publicity,
she had a need to be accepted."
He said he knew she had

written articles for underground
publications in the San
Francsico Bay area, but that in
nine months of dealings he had
met her once.
One contact
The subcommittee also was
told today that the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
for whom Mrs. Moore acted as
an informant, had only one
contact with her, and that was
on the day before she was
charged with attempting to

assassinate Ford.
Hex D. Davis, director of the
bureau, said his agency was put
in touch with Moore
through Inspector O'Shea,
Moore then accompanied agent
Charles W. Galyan on Sunday
Sept. 21, to a meeting with a
man involved in a gun
investigation.
On Tuesday, Assistant Secret
Service Director James T. Burke
told the subcommittee that
Moore made five telephone calls

to law enforcement agencies on
the day she allegedly shot at
Ford. She called the San
Francisco field office of the
Secret Service three times and
the FBI and San Francisco
police once each Burke said.
Each time she called the
Secret Service, she asked for
agents Yauger and Hakell, who
had interviewed her the night
before, and each time she was
told they were not in the office,
Burke said.
