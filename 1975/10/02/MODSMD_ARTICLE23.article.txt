SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
Oliver Sipple, the ex-Marine
credited with deflecting an
assassin's gun away from
President Ford, filed a $15
million invasion of privacy suit
Tuesday against news media for
reporting that he was
homosexual.
Sipple's lawsuit said that
through news reports, "his
brothers and his sisters learned
for the first time of his
homosexual sexual orientation,
and accordingly and
consequentially abandoned the
plaintiff."
In addition, the suit said, he
"was exposed to contempt and
ridicule, causing him great
mental anguish, embarrassment
and humiliation."
The suit named seven
newspapers and their parent
companies as well as 50
unnamed "Does" identified only
as publishers of a newspaper,
magazine or news service.
The only writer specifically
named as a defendant was San
Francisco Chronicle columnist
Herb Caen who first alluded to
Sipple's gay politics in his daily
column.
Newspapers named were the
Los Angeles Times, The Chicago
Sun-Times, The Denver Post,
tSan Antonio Express and the
Indianapolis Star.
Sipple asked for $5 million in
damages and $10 million in
punitive and exemplary
damages.
The Times and Chronicle had
no immediate comment.
