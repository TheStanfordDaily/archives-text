Sometime in the past some
innovative publicist in the film
industry decided that publishing
accounts of a movie's
conception and production was
potentially profitable. The only
problem was guessing whether or
not a movie was going to be (1)
released, or (2) successful
enough that people would want
to know what went on behind
the scenes.
One way around those
problems is an ex post facto
account of the filming, so that
no work is wasted if the movie is
a flop. Such as it was with
publicist Nicholas Meyer's TTie
Love Story Story.
And now, what we've all been
waiting for! — as if the endless
articles on every person who
helped with the production from
the director to Martha's
Vineyard's bit players weren't
enough — is Carl Gottlieb's The
Jaws Log, an account of the
filming of the phenomenally
successful movie that didn't
always have the aura of success
around it.
There are few better qualified
than Carl Gottlieb to write a
chronicle like The Jaws Log. He
revised author Peter Benchley's
original script (and improved it
immensely) and played publisher
Larry Meadows in the film. He
writes in a comfortable, relaxed
way, breaking all the rules about
conversing with the reader.
He surpasses Meyer in that he
writes like a novelist rather than
a journalist, aware of the
characters and situations he's

dealing with. His voice is not
dry, but instead human. His
style puts the book a notch
above the books that have come
before.
What comes out is a personal,
entertaining guided tour through
the rudiments of filmmaking by
the man who was there
practically every step of the
way. It is extremely informative,
telling about producers'
connections at publishing
companies that inform them of
an unpublished book that glows
with success; producers Dick
Zanuck'sand Richard Brown's
The Sting belief that sharks
could be trained to perform on
camera like dolphins; and how,
when they were convinced
otherwise, creating something

that had never been constructed
before — like a rubber killer
shark — was not as simple as it
sounded.
Also here are pieces of trivia
that fit perfectly into
conversations. The tiger shark in
the film thought to be the killer
had to be flown on ice from
Florida, becoming more and
more putrid as filming
continued, until it was almost
unbearable. And — the tidbit
that really produces fear —
Charlton Heston originally
wanted to play Chief Martin
Brody, Roy Scheider's role.
What a disaster that would have
been — the shark and Charlton
could have had a staredown to
see who was more
expressionless.
Gottlieb often reverts to

metaphors related specifically to
the film — "The first day went
swimmingly" — among other
atrocious puns. And although he
sometimes plugs Universal
Studios a little heavily, with
constant references to Airport
1975, Earthquake, and The
Hindenburg, on the whole The
Jaws Log is fascinating reading.

If you're one of those people who notices
every element of a motion picture, then you were
aware of how much the film Jaws was enhanced
by its excellent soundtrack. From the opening
moments of the movie, the pulsating bass strings
tug at your insides, telling of impending doom.
More than any other recent movie, I believe,
Jaws was made a complete cinematic experience
by John Williams' music. Without it, the movie
would be sadly lacking. With substandard music,
it would not be as terrifying.
The Soundtrack from Jaws (from MCA
Records, parent company of Universal Studios)
not only contains the murky strains of the
underwater sequences, those played on AM radio
that send shivers up the spine.
It also contains some excellent strains
reminiscent of classical music (what early film
soundtracks often relied upon) written by-
Williams that evoke visions of heroism and
memorable scenes from the film.
Williams was the man behind the music for
many recent blockbusters, among them The
Towering Inferno, Cinderella Liberty, The Paper
Chase, and The Sugarland Express. But in no
movie has the music added so much to the overall
effect of the film.
To quote director Steve Spielberg's jacket
notes — "The soundtrack is a stunning symphonic
achievement and a great leap ahead in the
revitalization of film music as a foreground
component for the total motion picture
experience."
This, of course, is one-half publicity jargon,
but it is 100% true, and Spielberg's words can not
be improved upon.

Just as Spielberg's dazzling cinematic touches
make the celluloid vibrate with originality,
Williams' unique touches create new ways for
effects. In the band "Chrissie's Death," for
instance, under the first attack, a clanging
hammer provides a chilling and oceanic
noise.Similarly, the band "Night Search," music
from the terrifying scene that may be the scariest
of the whole show, contains an off-pitch whining
of wind instruments that bring back memories
and accent the scene perfectly.
The music reminiscent of ocean voyages of
yesteryear ("Out To Sea" and "Sea Attack
Number One") are stirring as well as stunning.
Visions of dynamic sailors braving a world
unknown, beset by dangers, come with the notes.
It is a rare pleasure to listen to and remember.
It is not only the scoring of the shark attack
sequences that make the album so excellent.
Williams' treatment of the tourists arriving at
Amity on July 4th, "Promenade (Tourists On The
Menu)" (perhaps the best title for any piece of
music), is a jaunty piece reeking of the quality so
often lacking from film music.
"Promenade," like all the other bands, adds to
the film without being obtrusive, and yet makes
for enjoyable listening without lacking substance,
which is so often the case with other motion
picture soundtracks.
The soundtrack from Jaws is unlike any other
you've ever heard. It will bring back memories.
Whether you can live with them or not is the
question. The pulsating, haunting strings and
piano notes are enough to scare anyone with their
ominous tones and evocation of scenes from the
film. It is not a record to be listened to alone.

Sometime in the past some
innovative publicist in the film
industry decided that publishing
accounts of a movie's
conception and production was
potentially profitable. The only
problem was guessing whether or
not a movie was going to be (1)
released, or (2) successful
enough that people would want
to know what went on behind
the scenes.
One way around those
problems is an ex post facto
account of the filming, so that
no work is wasted if the movie is
a flop. Such as it was with
publicist Nicholas Meyer's TTie
Love Story Story.
And now, what we've all been
waiting for! — as if the endless
articles on every person who
helped with the production from
the director to Martha's
Vineyard's bit players weren't
enough — is Carl Gottlieb's The
Jaws Log, an account of the
filming of the phenomenally
successful movie that didn't
always have the aura of success
around it.
There are few better qualified
than Carl Gottlieb to write a
chronicle like The Jaws Log. He
revised author Peter Benchley's
original script (and improved it
immensely) and played publisher
Larry Meadows in the film. He
writes in a comfortable, relaxed
way, breaking all the rules about
conversing with the reader.
He surpasses Meyer in that he
writes like a novelist rather than
a journalist, aware of the
characters and situations he's

dealing with. His voice is not
dry, but instead human. His
style puts the book a notch
above the books that have come
before.
What comes out is a personal,
entertaining guided tour through
the rudiments of filmmaking by
the man who was there
practically every step of the
way. It is extremely informative,
telling about producers'
connections at publishing
companies that inform them of
an unpublished book that glows
with success; producers Dick
Zanuck'sand Richard Brown's
The Sting belief that sharks
could be trained to perform on
camera like dolphins; and how,
when they were convinced
otherwise, creating something

that had never been constructed
before — like a rubber killer
shark — was not as simple as it
sounded.
Also here are pieces of trivia
that fit perfectly into
conversations. The tiger shark in
the film thought to be the killer
had to be flown on ice from
Florida, becoming more and
more putrid as filming
continued, until it was almost
unbearable. And — the tidbit
that really produces fear —
Charlton Heston originally
wanted to play Chief Martin
Brody, Roy Scheider's role.
What a disaster that would have
been — the shark and Charlton
could have had a staredown to
see who was more
expressionless.
Gottlieb often reverts to

metaphors related specifically to
the film — "The first day went
swimmingly" — among other
atrocious puns. And although he
sometimes plugs Universal
Studios a little heavily, with
constant references to Airport
1975, Earthquake, and The
Hindenburg, on the whole The
Jaws Log is fascinating reading.

If you're one of those people who notices
every element of a motion picture, then you were
aware of how much the film Jaws was enhanced
by its excellent soundtrack. From the opening
moments of the movie, the pulsating bass strings
tug at your insides, telling of impending doom.
More than any other recent movie, I believe,
Jaws was made a complete cinematic experience
by John Williams' music. Without it, the movie
would be sadly lacking. With substandard music,
it would not be as terrifying.
The Soundtrack from Jaws (from MCA
Records, parent company of Universal Studios)
not only contains the murky strains of the
underwater sequences, those played on AM radio
that send shivers up the spine.
It also contains some excellent strains
reminiscent of classical music (what early film
soundtracks often relied upon) written by-
Williams that evoke visions of heroism and
memorable scenes from the film.
Williams was the man behind the music for
many recent blockbusters, among them The
Towering Inferno, Cinderella Liberty, The Paper
Chase, and The Sugarland Express. But in no
movie has the music added so much to the overall
effect of the film.
To quote director Steve Spielberg's jacket
notes — "The soundtrack is a stunning symphonic
achievement and a great leap ahead in the
revitalization of film music as a foreground
component for the total motion picture
experience."
This, of course, is one-half publicity jargon,
but it is 100% true, and Spielberg's words can not
be improved upon.

Just as Spielberg's dazzling cinematic touches
make the celluloid vibrate with originality,
Williams' unique touches create new ways for
effects. In the band "Chrissie's Death," for
instance, under the first attack, a clanging
hammer provides a chilling and oceanic
noise.Similarly, the band "Night Search," music
from the terrifying scene that may be the scariest
of the whole show, contains an off-pitch whining
of wind instruments that bring back memories
and accent the scene perfectly.
The music reminiscent of ocean voyages of
yesteryear ("Out To Sea" and "Sea Attack
Number One") are stirring as well as stunning.
Visions of dynamic sailors braving a world
unknown, beset by dangers, come with the notes.
It is a rare pleasure to listen to and remember.
It is not only the scoring of the shark attack
sequences that make the album so excellent.
Williams' treatment of the tourists arriving at
Amity on July 4th, "Promenade (Tourists On The
Menu)" (perhaps the best title for any piece of
music), is a jaunty piece reeking of the quality so
often lacking from film music.
"Promenade," like all the other bands, adds to
the film without being obtrusive, and yet makes
for enjoyable listening without lacking substance,
which is so often the case with other motion
picture soundtracks.
The soundtrack from Jaws is unlike any other
you've ever heard. It will bring back memories.
Whether you can live with them or not is the
question. The pulsating, haunting strings and

Menu)" (perhaps the best title for any piece of
music), is a jaunty piece reeking of the quality so
often lacking from film music.
"Promenade," like all the other bands, adds to
the film without being obtrusive, and yet makes
for enjoyable listening without lacking substance,
which is so often the case with other motion
picture soundtracks.
The soundtrack from Jaws is unlike any other
you've ever heard. It will bring back memories.
Whether you can live with them or not is the
question. The pulsating, haunting strings and
piano notes are enough to scare anyone with their
ominous tones and evocation of scenes from the
film. It is not a record to be listened to alone.

Sometime in the past some
innovative publicist in the film
industry decided that publishing
accounts of a movie's
conception and production was
potentially profitable. The only
problem was guessing whether or
not a movie was going to be (1)
released, or (2) successful
enough that people would want
to know what went on behind
the scenes.
One way around those
problems is an ex post facto
account of the filming, so that
no work is wasted if the movie is
a flop. Such as it was with
publicist Nicholas Meyer's TTie
Love Story Story.
And now, what we've all been
waiting for! — as if the endless
articles on every person who
helped with the production from
the director to Martha's
Vineyard's bit players weren't
enough — is Carl Gottlieb's The
Jaws Log, an account of the
filming of the phenomenally
successful movie that didn't
always have the aura of success
around it.
There are few better qualified
than Carl Gottlieb to write a
chronicle like The Jaws Log. He
revised author Peter Benchley's
original script (and improved it
immensely) and played publisher
Larry Meadows in the film. He
writes in a comfortable, relaxed
way, breaking all the rules about
conversing with the reader.
He surpasses Meyer in that he
writes like a novelist rather than
a journalist, aware of the
characters and situations he's

dealing with. His voice is not
dry, but instead human. His
style puts the book a notch
above the books that have come
before.
What comes out is a personal,
entertaining guided tour through
the rudiments of filmmaking by
the man who was there
practically every step of the
way. It is extremely informative,
telling about producers'
connections at publishing
companies that inform them of
an unpublished book that glows
with success; producers Dick
Zanuck'sand Richard Brown's
The Sting belief that sharks
could be trained to perform on
camera like dolphins; and how,
when they were convinced
otherwise, creating something

that had never been constructed
before — like a rubber killer
shark — was not as simple as it
sounded.
Also here are pieces of trivia
that fit perfectly into
conversations. The tiger shark in
the film thought to be the killer
had to be flown on ice from
Florida, becoming more and
more putrid as filming
continued, until it was almost
unbearable. And — the tidbit
that really produces fear —
Charlton Heston originally
wanted to play Chief Martin
Brody, Roy Scheider's role.
What a disaster that would have
been — the shark and Charlton
could have had a staredown to
see who was more
expressionless.
Gottlieb often reverts to

metaphors related specifically to
the film — "The first day went
swimmingly" — among other
atrocious puns. And although he
sometimes plugs Universal
Studios a little heavily, with
constant references to Airport
1975, Earthquake, and The
Hindenburg, on the whole The
Jaws Log is fascinating reading.

If you're one of those people who notices
every element of a motion picture, then you were
aware of how much the film Jaws was enhanced
by its excellent soundtrack. From the opening
moments of the movie, the pulsating bass strings
tug at your insides, telling of impending doom.
More than any other recent movie, I believe,
Jaws was made a complete cinematic experience
by John Williams' music. Without it, the movie
would be sadly lacking. With substandard music,
it would not be as terrifying.
The Soundtrack from Jaws (from MCA
Records, parent company of Universal Studios)
not only contains the murky strains of the
underwater sequences, those played on AM radio
that send shivers up the spine.
It also contains some excellent strains
reminiscent of classical music (what early film
soundtracks often relied upon) written by-
Williams that evoke visions of heroism and
memorable scenes from the film.
Williams was the man behind the music for
many recent blockbusters, among them The
Towering Inferno, Cinderella Liberty, The Paper
Chase, and The Sugarland Express. But in no
movie has the music added so much to the overall
effect of the film.
To quote director Steve Spielberg's jacket
notes — "The soundtrack is a stunning symphonic
achievement and a great leap ahead in the
revitalization of film music as a foreground
component for the total motion picture
experience."
This, of course, is one-half publicity jargon,
but it is 100% true, and Spielberg's words can not
be improved upon.

Just as Spielberg's dazzling cinematic touches
make the celluloid vibrate with originality,
Williams' unique touches create new ways for
effects. In the band "Chrissie's Death," for
instance, under the first attack, a clanging
hammer provides a chilling and oceanic
noise.Similarly, the band "Night Search," music
from the terrifying scene that may be the scariest
of the whole show, contains an off-pitch whining
of wind instruments that bring back memories
and accent the scene perfectly.
The music reminiscent of ocean voyages of
yesteryear ("Out To Sea" and "Sea Attack
Number One") are stirring as well as stunning.
Visions of dynamic sailors braving a world
unknown, beset by dangers, come with the notes.
It is a rare pleasure to listen to and remember.
It is not only the scoring of the shark attack
sequences that make the album so excellent.
Williams' treatment of the tourists arriving at
Amity on July 4th, "Promenade (Tourists On The

The music reminiscent of ocean voyages of
yesteryear ("Out To Sea" and "Sea Attack
Number One") are stirring as well as stunning.
Visions of dynamic sailors braving a world
unknown, beset by dangers, come with the notes.
It is a rare pleasure to listen to and remember.
It is not only the scoring of the shark attack
sequences that make the album so excellent.
Williams' treatment of the tourists arriving at
Amity on July 4th, "Promenade (Tourists On The
Menu)" (perhaps the best title for any piece of
music), is a jaunty piece reeking of the quality so
often lacking from film music.
"Promenade," like all the other bands, adds to
the film without being obtrusive, and yet makes
for enjoyable listening without lacking substance,
which is so often the case with other motion
picture soundtracks.
The soundtrack from Jaws is unlike any other
you've ever heard. It will bring back memories.
Whether you can live with them or not is the
question. The pulsating, haunting strings and
piano notes are enough to scare anyone with their
ominous tones and evocation of scenes from the
film. It is not a record to be listened to alone.
