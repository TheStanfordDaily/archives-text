# Yunkers â€“ a 'cool' expressionist
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
Hans Hofmann, one of the
fathers of Abstract-Expression
ism, once observed that "Every
creative act requires elimination
and simplification." The works
of Adja Yunkers, currently on
view at the Smith Anderson
Gallery, 200 Homer St.,
represent a masterful distillation
of these two processes.
Hofmann and some of the
better known Abstract-Expres
sionist painters were concerned

with eliminating representational
forms and traditional methods
of depiction from their
paintings. Working within this
same ethic, Yunkers extends this
process, producing works of an
even more austere and
stripped-down nature.
By stressing controlled
brushwork and monochromatic,
earth-toned canvases, Yunkers
achieves a uniquely 'cool' style
of Abstract-Expressionism.
Rather than emphasizing wild

splashes and bold colors,
Yunkers' canvases concentrate
on stubby, stucco-like
backgrounds broken by sparse
patches of smooth paint. Several
of these paintings like "Ikon I"
are hauntingly architectural.
With their strange tactile depth
and muddy hues they are like
hurriedly patched walls,
mingling a sense of personal
history with the simple passage
of time.
By extending his works

beyond the traditional realm of
mere two dimensional depiction,
Yunkers imbues his pictorial
space with new meaning. Instead
of representing the tangible,
these paintings with their
peculiar rendering of space and
sense of past activity serve as
illusionistic reminders.
In several of his larger
paintings and prints, Yunkers
redefines the pictorial space by
encapsulating the painting
proper within an informally
painted band. This has the effect
of focusing our attention and
underlining the work's
separateness from all else.
These works are like the text
of a foreign letter; temptingly
readable, and yet teasingly
private.
(The Adja Yunkers Exhibit
continues through the month at
the Smith-Anderson Gallery.
Hours are 12-4 Tuesday through
Saturday.)
