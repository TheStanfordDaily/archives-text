# 'Fear' is only in title
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
Every so often there comes a
movie that is so poorly put to
gether that one wonders how
professional the people both in
front of the camera and behind it
really were.
If one looks closely and criti
cally, as a reviewer is supposed
to, one sees tiny holes in the
superstructure that pile upon
one another as the movie prog
resses until all these chinks are
glaringly apparent even to the
child's eye.
loumey Into Fear is one such
movie. One likes to think that it
wasn't originally so bad — that
once upon a time, the story was
attractive and riveting and made
sense.
Director Daniel Mann seems to
have been drunk when lie was
filming Journey Into Fear. Or
perhaps some enterprising per
son went after the movie with a
scissors in the dark of night.
Whatever the method, the end
result is the choppiest movie I've
seen in a long time. Occasionally
in the best of movies a shot will
not match with the one preced
ing it. I lowever this turkey is al
most a constant string of mis
matched shots.
Such haphazard editing
makes for great confusion, as one
never really knows where each
character is in relation to the
others.
This is especially necessary in
a thriller (?) such as this where
the element of of surprise, for
both the characters and the au
dudience, is extremely useful in
generating the correct mood of
suspense.
Thus, this movie is never re
ally suspenseful and usually is

just plain boring.
Rarely have L seen such fine
actors wasted in such an Edsel of
a production. They are all drawn
down by the substandard mater
ial and look simply horrible.
Truthfully , 1 have seen better
television productions.
The "all-male" cast includes
Sam Waterston, whose acting
talent was so evident in The
Great Gatsby and Ran cho
Deluxe. He stumbles through
this movie with a listlessness
reminiscent of a man who has
accidentally stepped onto the
wrong set, but decides to stay to
make the movie anyway.
Shelley Winters is almost as
bad as she was in The Sex
Symbol.
Lan McShane (The Last of
Sheila) gets to be villainous and
menacing, but has very few, if
any. lines. The same is true for
Zero Mostel, Joseph Wiseman,

Stanley Holloway, and Vincent
Price.
The story, taken from an old
Eric Ambler novel, was moder
nized slightly to include the
Arabs and their oil, the Arabs
and their terrorists, and the
Arabs and their dastardly way of
mistreating the world.
It concerns Waterston's at
tempts to get to the United States
from Turkey with a secret vital to
his employer, Bainhridge Oil.
Apparently this secret, which
we never learn about, and thus
never understand what makes it
so important to the Arabs, will be
a new innovation in the oil busi
ness.
It is, in short, the old, old story
about the man who doesn't know
who to trust and doesn't know
where to run. I know where
Waterston should have run — to
the next set at the studio. Maybe
he would have stumbled into a
better movie.

mistreating the world.
It concerns Waterston's at
tempts to get to the United States
from Turkey with a secret vital to
his employer, Bainhridge Oil.
Apparently this secret, which
we never learn about, and thus
never understand what makes it
so important to the Arabs, will be
a new innovation in the oil busi
ness.
It is, in short, the old, old story
about the man who doesn't know
who to trust and doesn't know
where to run. I know where
Waterston should have run — to
the next set at the studio. Maybe
he would have stumbled into a
better movie.
Every so often there comes a
movie that is so poorly put to
gether that one wonders how
professional the people both in
front of the camera and behind it
really were.
If one looks closely and criti
cally, as a reviewer is supposed
to, one sees tiny holes in the
superstructure that pile upon
one another as the movie prog
resses until all these chinks are
glaringly apparent even to the
child's eye.
loumey Into Fear is one such
movie. One likes to think that it
wasn't originally so bad — that
once upon a time, the story was
attractive and riveting and made
sense.
Director Daniel Mann seems to
have been drunk when lie was
filming Journey Into Fear. Or
perhaps some enterprising per
son went after the movie with a
scissors in the dark of night.
Whatever the method, the end
result is the choppiest movie I've
seen in a long time. Occasionally
in the best of movies a shot will
not match with the one preced
ing it. I lowever this turkey is al
most a constant string of mis
matched shots.
Such haphazard editing
makes for great confusion, as one
never really knows where each
character is in relation to the
others.
This is especially necessary in
a thriller (?) such as this where
the element of of surprise, for
both the characters and the au
dudience, is extremely useful in
generating the correct mood of
suspense.
Thus, this movie is never re
ally suspenseful and usually is

just plain boring.
Rarely have L seen such fine
actors wasted in such an Edsel of
a production. They are all drawn
down by the substandard mater
ial and look simply horrible.
Truthfully , 1 have seen better
television productions.
The "all-male" cast includes
Sam Waterston, whose acting
talent was so evident in The
Great Gatsby and Ran cho
Deluxe. He stumbles through
this movie with a listlessness
reminiscent of a man who has
accidentally stepped onto the
wrong set, but decides to stay to
make the movie anyway.
Shelley Winters is almost as
bad as she was in The Sex
Symbol.
Lan McShane (The Last of
Sheila) gets to be villainous and
menacing, but has very few, if
any. lines. The same is true for
Zero Mostel, Joseph Wiseman,

Stanley Holloway, and Vincent
Price.
The story, taken from an old
Eric Ambler novel, was moder
nized slightly to include the
Arabs and their oil, the Arabs
and their terrorists, and the
Arabs and their dastardly way of
mistreating the world.
