Hearst linked to bank robbery
SAN FRANCISCO — Authorities have identified
Patricia Hearst as the person who rented a garage
used to store one of two getaway cars used in a
bank robbery in which a woman was killed, the San
Francisco Chronicle said today.
Three men and a woman held up the Crocker
National Bank branch April 21 in the Sacramento
suburb of Carmichael, escaping with $15,000 after
killing a mother of four with a shotgun blast. The
U.S. attorney's office had said earlier that they
were investigating the possibility that Miss Hearst
and her traveling companions were involved in the
robbery.
The Chronicle said federal agents were
convinced that Hearst was the young woman
who rented an apartment garage in which the
robbers stored a 1967 Pontiac Firebird.
The apartment manager became suspicious after
the woman gave him a false address and called
police, the paper said.
Officers then put the garage under surveillance.
The car was removed from the garage the day of
the robbery and was later found abandoned a few
blocks from the bank.
Earlier yesterday federal prosecutors said
Hearst and her companions could face new, more
serious charges.
In addition to the Carmichael murder and
robbery, authorities have been investigating
possible links between the SLA and numerous
terrorist bombings and a Sacramento savings and
loan holdup in February.
Also today, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported
that the break leading to the capture of Patty
Hearst came because the FBI checked the mail
addressed to the father of Stephen and Kathy
Soliah.
Natural gas controls upheld
WASHINGTON - A Republican effort to
remove federal controls from the price of
domestically-produced natural gas was rejected by
the Senate yesterday.
The vote against a proposal by Sen. Paul P'annin
(R-Ariz.) indicated Republicans and gas-state
senators may have the strength to win a more
gradual removal of price controls, as advocated by
the Ford administration.
The gradual phase-out of controls would mean
higher prices, but the increase would not be so
sharp as under the Fannin amendment.
The Ford administration contends that higher
prices are necessary to reverse the decline in the
natural-gas production.

Lower federal raises granted
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday killed
an 8.66 percent pay raise for members of Congress,
federal employes and others, thus upholding the
five percent increase recommended by President
Ford.
The raise, which went into effect immediately,
affects senators and representatives, federal judges,
the vice president, Cabinet members, top
government officials, federal white collar workers
and military personnel.
The cost of the five percent raise is estimated at
$2.3 billion, compared with the $3.9 billion cost of
the defeated larger increase. Ford had said the
higher raise was inflationary.
Nixon supporter pleads guilty
WASHINGTON — Armand Hammer, one of the
wealthiest oil men in America, pleaded guilty
yesterday to illegally concealing $54,000 in
contributions to the 1972 re-election campaign of
former President Richard Nixon.
Hammer, 77, also acknowledged an extensive
attempt to cover-up the source of the cash after the
contributions were investigated by the Senate
Watergate Committee in 1973.
Chief U.S. District Judge William B. Jones Jr.
freed Hammer with no bond and said he would set
a sentencing date later.
Arab pilots to train in U.S.
WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia will pay for a
major new six-year program to train about 1300 of
its technicians and pilots in the United States, the
Air Force said yesterday.
The program, due to begin late this month at
Lackland Air Force Base, Tex., will cost the Saudis
between $90 million and $100 million, the Air
Force said.
The new training program is one of the most
extensive of its kind in a growing U.S. relationship
with Arab and other Middle East arms customers.
Farm unions demand results
FRESNO — The rival United Farm Workers
(UFW) and Teamsters unions demanded yesterday
that the state certify representation election results
faster so they can negotiate contracts with growers.
The Teamsters have won elections at 77 ranches
covering 9100 workers and the UFW 71 elections
covering 9800 workers in the first month of voting
under California's new secret ballot law.
But only seven elections had been certified as of
yesterday because complaints were filed by the

losing union or growers in most other cases.
Strike stops Post publication
WASHINGTON — The Washington Post said
yesterday it is suspending publication temporarily
after a pressmen's strike, an early morning fire and
vandalism in the pressroom which the Post termed
"malicious mischief."
Late yesterday, scuffling that led to about 20
arrests broke out as the picketing pressmen tried to
prevent men they said were strikebreakers from
entering the newspaper's building.
A statement issued by the newspaper said none
of its presses could be operated because of damages
such as cut operating reels, broken and stripped
conveyor wires and damaged drive mechanisms
where tools, rags, beverage cans or other objects
had been inserted.
The statement attributed all the damage to
malicious mischief, adding, "it appears to have
been executied by people who had pre-planned and
synchornized their actions."
Today's weather
Coastal low clouds extending inland this
morning then becoming patchy tonight and
tomorrow. Otherwise mostly fair inland areas
through today. Increasing cloudiness tonight then
partly cloudy tomorrow. Little temperature
change. Lows tonight in the 50s. Highs both days
in the 60s to mid 70s.

Hearst linked to bank robbery
SAN FRANCISCO — Authorities have identified
Patricia Hearst as the person who rented a garage
used to store one of two getaway cars used in a
bank robbery in which a woman was killed, the San
Francisco Chronicle said today.
Three men and a woman held up the Crocker
National Bank branch April 21 in the Sacramento
suburb of Carmichael, escaping with $15,000 after
killing a mother of four with a shotgun blast. The
U.S. attorney's office had said earlier that they
were investigating the possibility that Miss Hearst
and her traveling companions were involved in the
robbery.
The Chronicle said federal agents were
convinced that Hearst was the young woman
who rented an apartment garage in which the
robbers stored a 1967 Pontiac Firebird.
The apartment manager became suspicious after
the woman gave him a false address and called
police, the paper said.
Officers then put the garage under surveillance.
The car was removed from the garage the day of
the robbery and was later found abandoned a few
blocks from the bank.
Earlier yesterday federal prosecutors said
Hearst and her companions could face new, more
serious charges.
In addition to the Carmichael murder and
robbery, authorities have been investigating
possible links between the SLA and numerous
terrorist bombings and a Sacramento savings and
loan holdup in February.
Also today, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported
that the break leading to the capture of Patty
Hearst came because the FBI checked the mail
addressed to the father of Stephen and Kathy
Soliah.
Natural gas controls upheld
WASHINGTON - A Republican effort to
remove federal controls from the price of
domestically-produced natural gas was rejected by
the Senate yesterday.
The vote against a proposal by Sen. Paul P'annin
(R-Ariz.) indicated Republicans and gas-state
senators may have the strength to win a more
gradual removal of price controls, as advocated by
the Ford administration.
The gradual phase-out of controls would mean
higher prices, but the increase would not be so
sharp as under the Fannin amendment.
The Ford administration contends that higher
prices are necessary to reverse the decline in the
natural-gas production.

Lower federal raises granted
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday killed
an 8.66 percent pay raise for members of Congress,
federal employes and others, thus upholding the
five percent increase recommended by President
Ford.
The raise, which went into effect immediately,
affects senators and representatives, federal judges,
the vice president, Cabinet members, top
government officials, federal white collar workers
and military personnel.
The cost of the five percent raise is estimated at
$2.3 billion, compared with the $3.9 billion cost of
the defeated larger increase. Ford had said the
higher raise was inflationary.
Nixon supporter pleads guilty
WASHINGTON — Armand Hammer, one of the
wealthiest oil men in America, pleaded guilty
yesterday to illegally concealing $54,000 in
contributions to the 1972 re-election campaign of
former President Richard Nixon.
Hammer, 77, also acknowledged an extensive
attempt to cover-up the source of the cash after the
contributions were investigated by the Senate
Watergate Committee in 1973.
Chief U.S. District Judge William B. Jones Jr.
freed Hammer with no bond and said he would set
a sentencing date later.
Arab pilots to train in U.S.
WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia will pay for a
major new six-year program to train about 1300 of
its technicians and pilots in the United States, the
Air Force said yesterday.
The program, due to begin late this month at
Lackland Air Force Base, Tex., will cost the Saudis
between $90 million and $100 million, the Air
Force said.
The new training program is one of the most
extensive of its kind in a growing U.S. relationship
with Arab and other Middle East arms customers.
Farm unions demand results
FRESNO — The rival United Farm Workers
(UFW) and Teamsters unions demanded yesterday
that the state certify representation election results
faster so they can negotiate contracts with growers.
The Teamsters have won elections at 77 ranches
covering 9100 workers and the UFW 71 elections
covering 9800 workers in the first month of voting
under California's new secret ballot law.
But only seven elections had been certified as of
yesterday because complaints were filed by the

losing union or growers in most other cases.
Strike stops Post publication
WASHINGTON — The Washington Post said
yesterday it is suspending publication temporarily
after a pressmen's strike, an early morning fire and
vandalism in the pressroom which the Post termed
"malicious mischief."
Late yesterday, scuffling that led to about 20
arrests broke out as the picketing pressmen tried to
prevent men they said were strikebreakers from
entering the newspaper's building.
A statement issued by the newspaper said none
of its presses could be operated because of damages
such as cut operating reels, broken and stripped
conveyor wires and damaged drive mechanisms
where tools, rags, beverage cans or other objects
had been inserted.
The statement attributed all the damage to
malicious mischief, adding, "it appears to have
been executied by people who had pre-planned and
synchornized their actions."

Hearst linked to bank robbery
SAN FRANCISCO — Authorities have identified
Patricia Hearst as the person who rented a garage
used to store one of two getaway cars used in a
bank robbery in which a woman was killed, the San
Francisco Chronicle said today.
Three men and a woman held up the Crocker
National Bank branch April 21 in the Sacramento
suburb of Carmichael, escaping with $15,000 after
killing a mother of four with a shotgun blast. The
U.S. attorney's office had said earlier that they
were investigating the possibility that Miss Hearst
and her traveling companions were involved in the
robbery.
The Chronicle said federal agents were
convinced that Hearst was the young woman
who rented an apartment garage in which the
robbers stored a 1967 Pontiac Firebird.
The apartment manager became suspicious after
the woman gave him a false address and called
police, the paper said.
Officers then put the garage under surveillance.
The car was removed from the garage the day of
the robbery and was later found abandoned a few
blocks from the bank.
Earlier yesterday federal prosecutors said
Hearst and her companions could face new, more
serious charges.
In addition to the Carmichael murder and
robbery, authorities have been investigating
possible links between the SLA and numerous
terrorist bombings and a Sacramento savings and
loan holdup in February.
Also today, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported
that the break leading to the capture of Patty
Hearst came because the FBI checked the mail
addressed to the father of Stephen and Kathy
Soliah.
Natural gas controls upheld
WASHINGTON - A Republican effort to
remove federal controls from the price of
domestically-produced natural gas was rejected by
the Senate yesterday.
The vote against a proposal by Sen. Paul P'annin
(R-Ariz.) indicated Republicans and gas-state
senators may have the strength to win a more
gradual removal of price controls, as advocated by
the Ford administration.
The gradual phase-out of controls would mean
higher prices, but the increase would not be so
sharp as under the Fannin amendment.
The Ford administration contends that higher
prices are necessary to reverse the decline in the
natural-gas production.

Lower federal raises granted
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday killed
an 8.66 percent pay raise for members of Congress,
federal employes and others, thus upholding the
five percent increase recommended by President
Ford.
The raise, which went into effect immediately,
affects senators and representatives, federal judges,
the vice president, Cabinet members, top
government officials, federal white collar workers
and military personnel.
The cost of the five percent raise is estimated at
$2.3 billion, compared with the $3.9 billion cost of
the defeated larger increase. Ford had said the
higher raise was inflationary.
Nixon supporter pleads guilty
WASHINGTON — Armand Hammer, one of the
wealthiest oil men in America, pleaded guilty
yesterday to illegally concealing $54,000 in
contributions to the 1972 re-election campaign of
former President Richard Nixon.
Hammer, 77, also acknowledged an extensive
attempt to cover-up the source of the cash after the
contributions were investigated by the Senate
Watergate Committee in 1973.
Chief U.S. District Judge William B. Jones Jr.
freed Hammer with no bond and said he would set
a sentencing date later.
Arab pilots to train in U.S.
WASHINGTON — Saudi Arabia will pay for a
major new six-year program to train about 1300 of
its technicians and pilots in the United States, the
Air Force said yesterday.
The program, due to begin late this month at
Lackland Air Force Base, Tex., will cost the Saudis
between $90 million and $100 million, the Air
Force said.
The new training program is one of the most
extensive of its kind in a growing U.S. relationship
with Arab and other Middle East arms customers.
Farm unions demand results
FRESNO — The rival United Farm Workers
(UFW) and Teamsters unions demanded yesterday
that the state certify representation election results
faster so they can negotiate contracts with growers.
The Teamsters have won elections at 77 ranches
covering 9100 workers and the UFW 71 elections
covering 9800 workers in the first month of voting
under California's new secret ballot law.
But only seven elections had been certified as of
yesterday because complaints were filed by the

losing union or growers in most other cases.
Strike stops Post publication
WASHINGTON — The Washington Post said
yesterday it is suspending publication temporarily
after a pressmen's strike, an early morning fire and
vandalism in the pressroom which the Post termed
"malicious mischief."
Late yesterday, scuffling that led to about 20
arrests broke out as the picketing pressmen tried to
prevent men they said were strikebreakers from
entering the newspaper's building.
A statement issued by the newspaper said none
of its presses could be operated because of damages
such as cut operating reels, broken and stripped
conveyor wires and damaged drive mechanisms
where tools, rags, beverage cans or other objects
had been inserted.
The statement attributed all the damage to
malicious mischief, adding, "it appears to have
been executied by people who had pre-planned and
synchornized their actions."
