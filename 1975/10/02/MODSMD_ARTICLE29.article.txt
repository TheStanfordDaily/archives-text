# Hearst hustled out
## 
### 
Patty Hearst was prematurely whisked from
Stanford Hospital Tuesday because of a report,
since shown to be false, that a group of Black
Muslims actively sought the hospital's floor plans.
Psychiatric testing of Hearst was called off
because of the report, according to Paul Hofman,
director of hospital administration.
"We are considering conducting psychiatric
examinations during the afternoon," Hofman said.
"But as a precautionary measure, we did conclude
the [physical and neurological] examinations as
quickly as possible in the morning."
Hofman said the rumor originated from an
anonymous phone call received by the FBI. Federal
marshals informed Hofman of the report at 11 a.m.
Tuesday.
"We did receive that information [Tuesday]
morning. It has been since verified to be untrue,"
Hofman related.
