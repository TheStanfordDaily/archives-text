# Five projects underway
## Campus turns hard-hat 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Heavy construction on campus is proceeding apace.
Indeed, the entire academic reserve could be mistaken for
a hard hat area, with five major projects in progress, two
just completed, and four more approved by the Board of
Trustees.
Why the building boom here, in the face of a
nationwide depression in the construction industry?
Former Stanford planner Harry Sanders identifies one
cogent reason for haste: the University must suffer a
twelve percent increase in construction costs for each year
it delays a project.
Also, administrators admit that Stanford has devoted
most of its uncommitted money for the past twenty years
to attracting a top-flight faculty. Now it must build places
to house the new talent.
Low-priority projects
Finally, some relatively low-priority projects, like the
Hoover Memorial Building and specialized Medical Center
research facilities, obtain funds from wealthy potential
donors or the federal government.
Congress appropriated $7 million to add a third
building to the Hoover Institution complex, contingent on
$7 million in matching funds from Stanford. The building
itself will cost about nine million, with the remaining five
million for endowment.
The Lymphoma Virology laboratory on Governor's
Lane, a $1.1 million building to be dedicated later this
month, was also financed primarily by the federal
government.
Current projects
The five major projects now under construction are:
—The Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building, a $9.5
million project begun this summer. Most of the chemistry
department, including undergraduate classes, will be
moved to the new building.
—The Terman Engineering Building, a $9.2 million,
six-story wood-frame structure next to the Women's Gym.
Excavation began just weeks ago.
—The Sherman Neurosciences Center, a structural steel
building on the west side of the medical center. This $9.7

million facility will house the departments of anatomy
and physiology, now located in antiquated quarters near
the museum.
—The Applied Physics Building, an $860,000 project
now nearing completion.
—Phase I of the planned hospital expansion, a $12.6
million project to add core services, intensive care beds,
and operating rooms to the Medical Center.
Projects essential
University administrators insist that three planned
projects — expansion of the Main Library and renovations
of Buildings 200 (History Corner) and 460 (physiology, to
become computer science) — are essential. However, they
admit to serious trouble raising money for these three,
which lack the appeal of Hoover or medical research
laboratories.
Executive Asst. to the Provost Ed Shaw says the University
has pledges or gifts for less than half of the $20 million
library and about half of the $9 million physiology
renovation. Virtually no funds have been committed to
the $10 million history corner renovation.
Money for departments in the School of Humanities
and Sciences has always been scarce, Shaw says, but it has
become virtually nonexistent since federal funds were cut
back. He noted that almost all new academic buildings,
such as the Business School, the Education Research
Building, Psychology Corner and Math Corner, received
federal funds.
No new funds
The University has not discovered a source to replace
the federal money, withdrawn by Republican
administrations, Shaw says.
Stanford responded by borrowing money to finance
new construction for the first time in its history. The
California Educational Facilities Authority, established by
the legislature, lets universities issue tax-exempt bonds to
finance construction.
The new policy will demand $1 million per year from
the operating budget, to service the bonds, but will allow
the University to proceed now with some new buildings.

HARD HAT PARTY—The recently completed Law School was part of the flurry of building projects begun by the
Planning Department in an effort to outrace rapidly rising construction costs, and to house the faculty members lured
to the University in recent years.

Money for departments in the School of Humanities
and Sciences has always been scarce, Shaw says, but it has
become virtually nonexistent since federal funds were cut
back. He noted that almost all new academic buildings,
such as the Business School, the Education Research
Building, Psychology Corner and Math Corner, received
federal funds.
No new funds
The University has not discovered a source to replace
the federal money, withdrawn by Republican
administrations, Shaw says.
Stanford responded by borrowing money to finance
new construction for the first time in its history. The
California Educational Facilities Authority, established by
the legislature, lets universities issue tax-exempt bonds to
finance construction.
The new policy will demand $1 million per year from
the operating budget, to service the bonds, but will allow
the University to proceed now with some new buildings.

HARD HAT PARTY—The recently completed Law School was part of the flurry of building projects begun by the
Planning Department in an effort to outrace rapidly rising construction costs, and to house the faculty members lured
to the University in recent years.
Heavy construction on campus is proceeding apace.
Indeed, the entire academic reserve could be mistaken for
a hard hat area, with five major projects in progress, two
just completed, and four more approved by the Board of
Trustees.
Why the building boom here, in the face of a
nationwide depression in the construction industry?
Former Stanford planner Harry Sanders identifies one
cogent reason for haste: the University must suffer a
twelve percent increase in construction costs for each year
it delays a project.
Also, administrators admit that Stanford has devoted
most of its uncommitted money for the past twenty years
to attracting a top-flight faculty. Now it must build places
to house the new talent.
Low-priority projects
Finally, some relatively low-priority projects, like the
Hoover Memorial Building and specialized Medical Center
research facilities, obtain funds from wealthy potential
donors or the federal government.
Congress appropriated $7 million to add a third
building to the Hoover Institution complex, contingent on
$7 million in matching funds from Stanford. The building
itself will cost about nine million, with the remaining five
million for endowment.
The Lymphoma Virology laboratory on Governor's
Lane, a $1.1 million building to be dedicated later this
month, was also financed primarily by the federal
government.
Current projects
The five major projects now under construction are:
—The Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building, a $9.5
million project begun this summer. Most of the chemistry
department, including undergraduate classes, will be
moved to the new building.
—The Terman Engineering Building, a $9.2 million,
six-story wood-frame structure next to the Women's Gym.
Excavation began just weeks ago.
—The Sherman Neurosciences Center, a structural steel
building on the west side of the medical center. This $9.7

million facility will house the departments of anatomy
and physiology, now located in antiquated quarters near
the museum.
—The Applied Physics Building, an $860,000 project
now nearing completion.
—Phase I of the planned hospital expansion, a $12.6
million project to add core services, intensive care beds,
and operating rooms to the Medical Center.
Projects essential
University administrators insist that three planned
projects — expansion of the Main Library and renovations
of Buildings 200 (History Corner) and 460 (physiology, to
become computer science) — are essential. However, they
admit to serious trouble raising money for these three,
which lack the appeal of Hoover or medical research
laboratories.
Executive Asst. to the Provost Ed Shaw says the University
has pledges or gifts for less than half of the $20 million
library and about half of the $9 million physiology
renovation. Virtually no funds have been committed to
the $10 million history corner renovation.
