# Hospital suspends 50 doctors with no malpractice insurance
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Approximately 50 community
physicians were suspended yesterday
from practicing at Stanford Hospital
because they are not covered by
medical malpractice insurance.
The suspended doctors will not be
able to admit patients to the hospital
or conduct any surgery.
Dr. Robert Alway, the medical
director of the hospital,who informed
the doctors of their suspensions, said
the doctors "are suspended until such
time as they have adequate
malpractice insurance."
Truck Insurance Company insures a
group policy for the California
Hospital Association (CHA). Stanford
receives its coverage through this
policy.
Higher premiums
Alway stated that the suspensions
were made because the hospital was
informed by its insurance company
that uninsured doctors were not to
practice at the hospital or the hospital
would have to pay about $400,000
more in malpractice premiums for two
months. The hospital's insurance rate
is currently about $2.4 million.
"If we were to pay 20 percent
more, then the insurance company
wouldn't fuss about doctors being
uninsured from Nov. 1 to Jan. 1. We
were being asked to support the
insurance companies during these
months, and we don't know what
would happen after Jan. 1," Alway
explained.
This program of raising the
hospital's rates to allow uninsured
physicians to use their facilities was set
up for small hospitals but could apply
to Stanford, according to Alway. This
alternative wasn't accepted here
because "We would have to ask the
public to pay increased room rates for
the doctors who wouldn't purchase

insurance," said Alway.
Alway has not yet received any
complaints from the suspended
physicians. He doesn't feel that the
suspensions are very important.
"Thirty of those suspended are
psychiatrists who don't admit patients.
Some are older doctors who haven't
been admitting in a while and don't
need the hospital. Five are general
surgeons who haven't operated since
December of 1973."
Alway believes that most will
probably withdraw. "For the older
doctors, their income would be less
than their premiums."
Any doctor who is suspended can
request a hearing at the hospital.
Doctors sue
One doctor who purchased
malpractice insurance to avoid
suspension is Carl Brunsting, M.D.

Brunsting is one of fifteen physians
who are suing Stanford Hospital,
Truck Insurance Company, and the
CHA for the right to practice at the
hospital without medical malpractice
insurance.
Brunsting noted that Stanford is
one of the few hospitals siding with
the insurance carrier. "The others are
siding with their staffs," Brunsting
said.
But Alway commented, "I'm sure
there are other hospitals that have
suspended doctors."
Santa Clara Superior Court Judge
John Brenner denied the doctors'
request for an injunction last Friday
which would have allowed them to
practice at the hospital without
malpractice insurance.
Brenner said that in his opinion,
because the hospital would lose its
liability insurance coverage if the

uninsured physicians used the
hospital, the hospital would "thereby
be placed in a position where it could
not safely continue its normal
operations."
Theodore Carlstrom, attorney for
the physicians, said, "We are
evaluating the situation right now. We
will proceed in some fashion out we
don't know how."
Said Brunsting, "I chose to pay this
blackmail money, but we will go
ahead. We want a doctor to work if he
is qualified but doesn't have insurance
and wants to risk it."
At a meeting of about 200 of the
hospital's community physicians, the
doctors voted unanimously to support
the suit. The Santa Clara County
Medical Association and the California
Medical Association's House of Delegates
have also supported the suit.
