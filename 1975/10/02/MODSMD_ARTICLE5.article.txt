# Berk running unopposed in USE election next week
## 
### CHARLIE HALL 
Jim Berk, the often controversial
president of the United Stanford
Employees (USE) is unopposed in
next Wednesday's annual election for
that office.
His one candidacy contrasts to last
year's voting, when opponent Keith
Stothers accused Berk of "running a
dictatorship."
Berk attributes the lack of
opposition in this year's election to
greater harmony within the union.
"We held a number of unity caucuses
this year to determine our programs
before talking about candidates. There

didn't seem to be a great deal of
disagreement over our programs," he
says, claiming that these sessions have
reduced friction in this year's
campaign.
But not all agree that Berk's
unopposed election is due to any
healing of last year's disagreements.
"Nobody had the initiative," says
Stothers, a plant services worker, who
since last year's election has been given
supervisor's status and thus is ineligible
to run for the post.
One reason for the lack of
opposition, Stothers argues, is that the
USE president receives no salary,
making the position a financial
burden. Berk currently receives a
full-time salary as the union's
organizer, and would continue to hold
that job even if unseated as president.
Indeed, Stothers notes that one
potential candidate, Bill Reynolds, a
Hansen Labs technician, dropped out

of the running because of the financial
drawbacks. "Bill would have won,"
Stothers maintains, "but he still has
his wife and kids" to think of.
Stothers further maintains that
Berk's operating methods have
changed little since last year's eleciton.
"He's a dictator from the word, 'go.'
He has to run the show, "and if he
didn't run the show, I think he'd try
to tear it down."
Bad reports
Stothers claims Berk has threatened
to give bad reports to University
management on workers who
vigorously oppose union policy.
Berk belittles charges that he is
dictatorial. "I don't have the power to
be a dictator," he scoffs, adding that
Stothers' charges are "personal," and
not based on reality.

consecutive term as USE's president,

THE LONELY RUNNER—Jim Berk, current president of the United Stanford
Employes (USE), is the sole candidate for that office in approaching elections.
Despite criticism that he is 'a dictator,' Berk attributes his unopposed
candidacy to more agreement within the union.
Berk has already started making plans
for the coming year. The union's main
goal, he says, is "to cash in on the
successes of USE. The University now
fears us, whereas before they were
merely annoyed."
The union's primary action at the
moment is an appeal to the National
Labor Relations Board (NLKB), over
last April's union representation
election at the hospital. Accusing the
hospital management of pressuring
workers and smearing USE, Berk says,
"We have the NLRB cold turkey,"
claiming that the local board is stalling
a decision by referring the appeal to its
Washington headquarters.
Next year
Berk is also concentrating on next
year's contract negotiations, when the
settlement reached after the 1974 USE
strike expires. "A strike is very likely,"
he says. He complains that the
University is, "if anything, more
obdurate" than before the 1974 strike.
A central issue in the negotiations
will concern the size of the employe
force that USE will be allowed to
represent. Berk claims that by
reclassifying some workers as either
professional employes or supervisors,
neither of which are subject to union
representation, the University has cut
his union's bargaining unit from a high
of 1600 employes to 1350.
In addition to seeking a larger
jurisdiction for the union, Berk is
calling on the University for
"improvement" in USE's cost-of-living
allowance and in employees' medical
and dental plans. If the University fails
to respond to his demands, he
predicts, a walkout next year will be
"almost inevitable."

Next year
Berk is also concentrating on next
year's contract negotiations, when the
settlement reached after the 1974 USE
strike expires. "A strike is very likely,"
he says. He complains that the
University is, "if anything, more
obdurate" than before the 1974 strike.
A central issue in the negotiations
will concern the size of the employe
force that USE will be allowed to
represent. Berk claims that by
reclassifying some workers as either
professional employes or supervisors,
neither of which are subject to union
representation, the University has cut
his union's bargaining unit from a high
of 1600 employes to 1350.
In addition to seeking a larger
jurisdiction for the union, Berk is
calling on the University for
"improvement" in USE's cost-of-living
allowance and in employees' medical
and dental plans. If the University fails
to respond to his demands, he
predicts, a walkout next year will be
"almost inevitable."
Jim Berk, the often controversial
president of the United Stanford
Employees (USE) is unopposed in
next Wednesday's annual election for
that office.
His one candidacy contrasts to last
year's voting, when opponent Keith
Stothers accused Berk of "running a
dictatorship."
Berk attributes the lack of
opposition in this year's election to
greater harmony within the union.
"We held a number of unity caucuses
this year to determine our programs
before talking about candidates. There

didn't seem to be a great deal of
disagreement over our programs," he
says, claiming that these sessions have
reduced friction in this year's
campaign.
But not all agree that Berk's
unopposed election is due to any
healing of last year's disagreements.
"Nobody had the initiative," says
Stothers, a plant services worker, who
since last year's election has been given
supervisor's status and thus is ineligible
to run for the post.
One reason for the lack of
opposition, Stothers argues, is that the
USE president receives no salary,
making the position a financial
burden. Berk currently receives a
full-time salary as the union's
organizer, and would continue to hold
that job even if unseated as president.
Indeed, Stothers notes that one
potential candidate, Bill Reynolds, a
Hansen Labs technician, dropped out

of the running because of the financial
drawbacks. "Bill would have won,"
Stothers maintains, "but he still has
his wife and kids" to think of.
Stothers further maintains that
Berk's operating methods have
changed little since last year's eleciton.
"He's a dictator from the word, 'go.'
He has to run the show, "and if he
didn't run the show, I think he'd try
to tear it down."
Bad reports
Stothers claims Berk has threatened
to give bad reports to University
management on workers who
vigorously oppose union policy.
Berk belittles charges that he is
dictatorial. "I don't have the power to
be a dictator," he scoffs, adding that
Stothers' charges are "personal," and
not based on reality.
Ensured of election to a third
consecutive term as USE's president,

THE LONELY RUNNER—Jim Berk, current president of the United Stanford
Employes (USE), is the sole candidate for that office in approaching elections.
Despite criticism that he is 'a dictator,' Berk attributes his unopposed
candidacy to more agreement within the union.
Berk has already started making plans
for the coming year. The union's main
goal, he says, is "to cash in on the
successes of USE. The University now
fears us, whereas before they were
merely annoyed."
The union's primary action at the
moment is an appeal to the National
Labor Relations Board (NLKB), over
last April's union representation
election at the hospital. Accusing the
hospital management of pressuring
workers and smearing USE, Berk says,
"We have the NLRB cold turkey,"
claiming that the local board is stalling
a decision by referring the appeal to its
Washington headquarters.
