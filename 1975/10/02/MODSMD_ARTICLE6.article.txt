# Hearst defense faces new federal evidence
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Federal
prosecutors said Wednesday that
Patricia Hearst and her radical
traveling companions face the
possibility of new, more serious
charges.
"I can't be specific, but there is a
very definite possibility of federal and
state charges," said U.S. Atty. James
L. Browning following a summit
meeting of top level government
prosecutors he hosted yesterday.
The meeting also included U.S.
Atty. Dwayne Keyes of Sacramento,
California Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger
and district attorneys from San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Sacramento
and Alameda counties.
They discussed the massive
evidence obtained through searches of
the San Francisco houses where the
newspaper heiress and her SLA
companions William and Emily Harris
were arrested Sept. 18.
Robert L. Stevenson of the U.S.
attorney's office said the prosecutors
met to "coordinate and exchange
information on the Patricia Hearst case
and on other cases of concern to
them." He declined to specify which
other cases he referred to.
Miss Hearst currently faces federal

bank robbery charges in San
Francisco. She and Symbionese
Liberation Army members William and
Emily Harris also are charged on
numerous state felony counts in Los
Angeles.
In addition, SLA members have
been linked to numerous terrorist
bombings and to a Sacramento savings
and loan holdup and a bank robbery in
nearby Carmichael, in which a woman
was killed.
Keyes told reporters the FBI was
investigating the robberies, which
occurred earlier this year, and said
evidence shows Patty and the Harrises
were in the area at the time.
Asked whether authorities might
file murder charges against Miss Hearst
or the Harrises for the bank robbery,
Keyes said, "If we found sufficient
evidence, yes. If not, no."
Browning said the San Francisco
district attorney's office "might
present more evidence to the grand
jury and that might result in charges."
Asked whether those charges might
be more serious than ones now
pending against Patty and the Harrises,
Browning replied, "Yes."
