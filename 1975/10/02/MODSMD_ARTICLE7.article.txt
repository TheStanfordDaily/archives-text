# Support Harris
## 
### 
Almost 10 years have passed
since David Harris was student
body president at Stanford. He
was a 20-year-old former Boy of
the Year from Fresno whose
personal morality led him to
refuse both a student deferment
and an induction order during
the Vietnam war. His public
stand against the war brought
him a 20-month stretch in
federal prisons.
Now Harris is running for
Congress in the 12th district, an
area bounded by Santa Clara and
Redwood City. The district
includes Stanford.
Harris must appeal to a large
and diverse constituency. His
opponent is Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), a
formidable campaigner with his
own history of opposition to the
Vietnam War and to Richard
Nixon.
Harris believes he can win. He
thinks that voters are fed up
with a government that bypasses
the public interest in favor of
corporate demands. He wants to
help build "a government that
serves the people, that addresses
their needs and treats the quality
of their lives as the nation's most
important interest."
Harris' platform calls for "an
economic reconstruction that
would put all of America's
people to work."
Specific proposals include
cutting the military budget and
putting the savings to work in
critical domestic areas like mass
transit, health care and
environmental protection;
challenging monopoly control of
the American economy;
decentralizing political and
economic institutions; and
balancing the budget by calling
on rich corporations and
individuals to shoulder a fair
share of the tax burden.
Recognizing that the 12th
district is particularly dependent
on military spending, Harris
advocates an alternative
employment program which
would put Americans to work
making their country a better
place to live in.
As Harris is challenging the
assumptions of political
orthodoxy, his eventual
opponent, McCloskey, is
throwing down the banner of

Robert Garcia

dissent within the Republican
party.
Once known as a maverick,
McCloskey is now voting to
uphold Gerald Ford's vetoes and
campaigning for the election
of Richard Nixon's hand-picked
successor.
McCloskey's 1975 record
includes votes to send money to
the corrupt, doomed Lon Nol
regime in Cambodia, to support
Ford's veto of an emergency
jobs bill and to oppose the
establishment of a consumer
protecting agency.
Harris has made no such
flip-flop. He has believed in
democracy ever since it was
explained to him in public
school. He sees his campaign for
Congress as one more chapter in
a life-long struggle to make
democracy work. Harris never
faltered in his opposition to the
Vietnam war, and he still
opposes the commitment of
American lives and money to
repressive foreign governments.
Stanford will play a key role
in Harris' election bid. There are
12,000 eligible student voters at
Stanford, in a district where the
incumbent won his last primary
by about 800 votes. Stanford
students have supported
McCloskey in the past, but they
are likely to notice when a
"maverick" applies for
membership in the conservative
establishment.
Harris needs more from
Stanford students than their
votes. He cannot rely on big
contributions to finance an
expensive media campaign. He
needs time and money from
many individuals to make his
people-to-people campaign
successful. He needs this kind of
help from Stanford students.
Ten years ago David Harris
came before Stanford students
seeking support for social
change. Since then he has
demonstrated his determination
to help make this country a
better place to live.
Now he is back, asking
another generation of students to
join him. He has proven himself
worthy of continued support.

includes Stanford.
Harris must appeal to a large
and diverse constituency. His
opponent is Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), a
formidable campaigner with his
own history of opposition to the
Vietnam War and to Richard
Nixon.
Harris believes he can win. He
thinks that voters are fed up
with a government that bypasses
the public interest in favor of
corporate demands. He wants to
help build "a government that
serves the people, that addresses
their needs and treats the quality
of their lives as the nation's most
important interest."
Harris' platform calls for "an
economic reconstruction that
would put all of America's
people to work."
Specific proposals include
cutting the military budget and
putting the savings to work in
critical domestic areas like mass
transit, health care and
environmental protection;
challenging monopoly control of
the American economy;
decentralizing political and
economic institutions; and
balancing the budget by calling
on rich corporations and
individuals to shoulder a fair
share of the tax burden.
Recognizing that the 12th
district is particularly dependent
on military spending, Harris
advocates an alternative
employment program which
would put Americans to work
making their country a better
place to live in.
As Harris is challenging the
assumptions of political
orthodoxy, his eventual
opponent, McCloskey, is
throwing down the banner of

Robert Garcia

dissent within the Republican
party.
Once known as a maverick,
McCloskey is now voting to
uphold Gerald Ford's vetoes and
campaigning for the election
of Richard Nixon's hand-picked
successor.
McCloskey's 1975 record
includes votes to send money to
the corrupt, doomed Lon Nol
regime in Cambodia, to support
Ford's veto of an emergency
jobs bill and to oppose the
establishment of a consumer
protecting agency.
Harris has made no such
flip-flop. He has believed in
democracy ever since it was
explained to him in public
school. He sees his campaign for
Congress as one more chapter in
a life-long struggle to make
democracy work. Harris never
faltered in his opposition to the
Vietnam war, and he still
opposes the commitment of
American lives and money to
repressive foreign governments.
Stanford will play a key role
in Harris' election bid. There are
12,000 eligible student voters at
Stanford, in a district where the
incumbent won his last primary
by about 800 votes. Stanford
students have supported
McCloskey in the past, but they
are likely to notice when a
"maverick" applies for
membership in the conservative
establishment.
Harris needs more from
Stanford students than their
votes. He cannot rely on big
contributions to finance an
expensive media campaign. He
needs time and money from
many individuals to make his
people-to-people campaign
successful. He needs this kind of
help from Stanford students.
Ten years ago David Harris
came before Stanford students
seeking support for social
change. Since then he has
demonstrated his determination
to help make this country a
better place to live.
Now he is back, asking
another generation of students to
join him. He has proven himself
worthy of continued support.

Almost 10 years have passed
since David Harris was student
body president at Stanford. He
was a 20-year-old former Boy of
the Year from Fresno whose
personal morality led him to
refuse both a student deferment
and an induction order during
the Vietnam war. His public
stand against the war brought
him a 20-month stretch in
federal prisons.
Now Harris is running for
Congress in the 12th district, an
area bounded by Santa Clara and
Redwood City. The district
includes Stanford.
