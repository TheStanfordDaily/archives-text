# Student-staff advice needed

### 
The most common criticism I
hear of the Stanford employes'
parking revolution is implied in
the question "Why doesn't
Stanford have the right to
charge its students and
employees to park on its own
land?"
This question, not so
incidently, is asked most
frequently by administrators,
employes who don't drive and
students who haven't been told
they also have to pay to park on
campus.
One answer is in the law suit
brought by the employes against
the Board of Trustees et al.
Specifically, the suit alleges
that:
' 'The parking fees
provided for in the parking
policy ... constitute a tax,
and their collection
constitutes an assertion of
power by the defendants
beyond and in excess of that
delegated to them in Vehicle
Code 21113, and for that
reason is unconstitutional and
invalid."
The basis of the legal action is
that Stanford is, in effect, a local
government and that the

imposition of the parking fee
without the consent of the
community amounts to
"taxation without
representation."
The moral issue
More important than the legal
basis of the rebellion, however,
is the moral issue raised by the
manner in which the pay parking
plan was instituted. Input from
the community was largely
unsolicited and ignored when
proffered.
The rationale for the
imposition of the tax was not
clearly stated or supported by
the administration, and debate
on the issues was not
encouraged.
What is clear is that the
board or its financial advisors,
viewed the levy as a means of
raising money to help the
University in a time of financial
difficulty.
We have seen this modus
operandi before. Last year, the
University administration
contracted with the government
of Iran to build an
"educational" satellite-complex.
The possibility that the system
might be used to further

Roger Hardy

political repression in that
country was disturbing, not only
to a number of Iranian
students, but to a significant
number of faculty,
staff and politically conscious
students.
The protests raised by these
members of the community
were ignored and, in fact, the
contract was a fait accompli,
unilaterally concluded by the
administration for financial
reasons before the deal was
publicized.
Commencement messes
Again last year, graduating
seniors were made aware of a
substantial change in the
traditional commencement
exercise. To save money, the
commencement ceremony was
to be a mass undergraduate
affair, held in Frost Amphitheater
with an endless progression of
graduating seniors receiving
diplomas in assembly-line
fashion.
No input was solicited from
those most affected by the
decision. No indication was
given in advance that this move
from individual school
ceremonies was contemplated.
No alteration of policy was
effected by the cry of protest
that followed the announcement
of the move.
It would be refreshing to see
a metamorphosis in the manner
in which policy is generated at
Stanford. This is not to imply
that the function of University
administration should be
delegated to the other sectors of
the community, but rather that
those who control the
decision-making process here
begin to consult with those
whose lives are affected by their
policies.
It is conceivable that, with
staff, faculty and student input,
the problems of campus parking
and the others mentioned above
could be resolved as
"community" issues and that
the resultant decisions would
not cause the destructive
bitterness and resentment which
are being generated by present
administrative techniques.
We await the day when
dialogue and democracy do not
die at the campus gate.

traditional commencement
exercise. To save money, the
commencement ceremony was
to be a mass undergraduate
affair, held in Frost Amphitheater
with an endless progression of
graduating seniors receiving
diplomas in assembly-line
fashion.
No input was solicited from
those most affected by the
decision. No indication was
given in advance that this move
from individual school
ceremonies was contemplated.
No alteration of policy was
effected by the cry of protest
that followed the announcement
of the move.
It would be refreshing to see
a metamorphosis in the manner
in which policy is generated at
Stanford. This is not to imply
that the function of University
administration should be
delegated to the other sectors of
the community, but rather that
those who control the
decision-making process here
begin to consult with those
whose lives are affected by their
policies.
It is conceivable that, with
staff, faculty and student input,
the problems of campus parking
and the others mentioned above
could be resolved as
"community" issues and that
the resultant decisions would
not cause the destructive
bitterness and resentment which
are being generated by present
administrative techniques.
We await the day when
dialogue and democracy do not
die at the campus gate.

The most common criticism I
hear of the Stanford employes'
parking revolution is implied in
the question "Why doesn't
Stanford have the right to
charge its students and
employees to park on its own
land?"
This question, not so
incidently, is asked most
frequently by administrators,
employes who don't drive and
students who haven't been told
they also have to pay to park on
campus.
One answer is in the law suit
brought by the employes against
the Board of Trustees et al.
Specifically, the suit alleges
that:
' 'The parking fees
provided for in the parking
policy ... constitute a tax,
and their collection
constitutes an assertion of
power by the defendants
beyond and in excess of that
delegated to them in Vehicle
Code 21113, and for that
reason is unconstitutional and
invalid."
The basis of the legal action is
that Stanford is, in effect, a local
government and that the

imposition of the parking fee
without the consent of the
community amounts to
"taxation without
representation."
The moral issue
More important than the legal
basis of the rebellion, however,
is the moral issue raised by the
manner in which the pay parking
plan was instituted. Input from
the community was largely
unsolicited and ignored when
proffered.
The rationale for the
imposition of the tax was not
clearly stated or supported by
the administration, and debate
on the issues was not
encouraged.
What is clear is that the
board or its financial advisors,
viewed the levy as a means of
raising money to help the
University in a time of financial
difficulty.
We have seen this modus
operandi before. Last year, the
University administration
contracted with the government
of Iran to build an
"educational" satellite-complex.
The possibility that the system
might be used to further

Roger Hardy

political repression in that
country was disturbing, not only
to a number of Iranian
students, but to a significant
number of faculty,
staff and politically conscious
students.
The protests raised by these
members of the community
were ignored and, in fact, the
contract was a fait accompli,
unilaterally concluded by the
administration for financial
reasons before the deal was
publicized.
