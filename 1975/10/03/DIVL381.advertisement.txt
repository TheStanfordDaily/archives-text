has been transferred to the screen in splendidly vibrant form comes
through with amazing impact, vitality and excitement. .It's a wonder
fully rewarding two hours.. Stanley Eichelbaum S F Examiner
"JAMES WHITMORE brings to life, brilliantly, the 33rd President of the
United States, Harry S Truman, in 'Give 'Em Hell, HarryWhitmore's
TVuman is larger than life; a man you cannot help but admire and respect
for his directness and honesty." johnstaiiey s 112 chron.cie
"SUPERIOR LIVING DOCUMENT that is as engrossing as the stage
production - the filmed performance is strengthened by close-ups that
magnify every gesture, make every seat a rinqside seat. Whitmore makes
us notice the traits in Truman worth noticing. Much of the technical
credit for the quality of the finished product must go to Sargent's ef
fective THEATROVISION process."- u a Times
"It captivates and even moves first-rate stage performance.. .The script
is beautifully articulated and balanced - a portrait that is stirring as well
as amusing - by the end Whitmore is 'The Man'." n v Times
"Get out and get to 'GIVE 'EM HELL, HARRY!' Two hours,unforget

"Lo and behold, JAMES WHITMORE'S'GIVE 'EM HELL, HARRY I '
has been transferred to the screen in splendidly vibrant form comes
through with amazing impact, vitality and excitement. .It's a wonder
fully rewarding two hours.. Stanley Eichelbaum S F Examiner
"JAMES WHITMORE brings to life, brilliantly, the 33rd President of the
United States, Harry S Truman, in 'Give 'Em Hell, HarryWhitmore's
TVuman is larger than life; a man you cannot help but admire and respect
for his directness and honesty." johnstaiiey s 112 chron.cie
"SUPERIOR LIVING DOCUMENT that is as engrossing as the stage
production - the filmed performance is strengthened by close-ups that
magnify every gesture, make every seat a rinqside seat. Whitmore makes
us notice the traits in Truman worth noticing. Much of the technical
credit for the quality of the finished product must go to Sargent's ef
fective THEATROVISION process."- u a Times
"It captivates and even moves first-rate stage performance.. .The script
is beautifully articulated and balanced - a portrait that is stirring as well
as amusing - by the end Whitmore is 'The Man'." n v Times
"Get out and get to 'GIVE 'EM HELL, HARRY!' Two hours,unforget
able hours, of Harry S Truman giving hell to everybody • an immaculate
performance by James Whitmore blistering, courageous, funny and
right on'"- GeneShalit NBC TV "
