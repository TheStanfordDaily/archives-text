# Drop Architecture
## Senate approves phase-out 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
An administrative consensus that
the Architecture Department here
could "not sustain itself without
extensive additional financing"
provided the impetus for the phasing
out of that program, Provost William
F. Miller told yesterday's meeting of
the Faculty Senate.
Miller, who made the final decision
"as part of the budget equilibrium"
after receiving the normal input from
committees and other sources, listed
four criteria which were used in the
examination of that program and
others:
—academic importance of the
program;
—student interest in the program,
now and in the future;
—degree of excellence of the
program, current and
potential; and
—ability of the University to finance
the program.
In tne case of the Architecture
Department, he said, the first two
criteria were unquestioned. However,
the others were in doubt, largely
because the department lacked a
graduate division.
'A special case'
He added later that his decision
does not mean every undergraduate
department needs a graduate division,
but called architecture a special case,
since it has a "professional thrust" and
architecture classes are seldom taken
as general courses.
"We are not reflecting on the
quality of either the faculty or the
students in the program, however,"
Miller added.
To accomodate those students who
have already declared architecture
majors, he said, a two year "phase
out" program will go into effect,
directed by Assoc. Architecture Prof.
Robert J. Mittelstadt.
When asked later about the possible
effectiveness of such a "phase out"
program, Miller said he felt there was
enough enthusiasm on the part of both
students and faculty to carry it
through.
Non-matriculated students
Miller also included an
announcement relating to past Senate
action, which revealed that
post-doctoral scholars will now be
enrolled as non-matriculated students.
A Senate action last spring had
declared such scholars "excluded from
the Professoriate," since they were still
"in a learning situation."
President Richard T. Lyman,
speaking earlier, commented on an
opinion column in yesterday's Daily
which protested the administration's
disinterest in outside input when
making parking decisions. Lyman
disagreed with that view, and cited a
list of eight public meetings held last
year, questionnaires distributed to a
variety of sources and sundry
committee reports.
"It calls into question the value of
the committee system if this kind of
thing happens," he said.
Speaking on other topics, he stated
that five Stanford students have
applied to the available ROTC
program at the University of Santa
Clara, and that the Department of

Defense has abandoned its former ban
on sending servicemen for advanced
training to universities which no longer
have ROTC.
While presenting the annual report
from the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA),
Asst. History Prof. Alasdair MacPhail
remarked that a pass grade would now
be considered as a "D" or better, since
"D" grades have been reinstated,
effective this quarter.
The Senate discussed at length the
portion of the C-AAA report which
dealt with recommendations on
faculty evaluation. It suggested in part
that department chairmen would have
to talk to each department member
once a year.
