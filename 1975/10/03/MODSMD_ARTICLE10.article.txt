On Social Security
Editor:
While I find that my own
Social Security tax is 5.85
percent and not the 11.7 percent
that Steve Hefter quotes in his
column (Daily, Sept. 30), I
understand that increases have
already been passed.
The inherent characteristics
of this system, based on today's
wages, are such that rises are
unavoidable if the recipients of
Social Security payments are to
be reasonably well taken care of.
Besides scrapping the present
Social Security tax scheme and
financing payments out of
general revenues, consideration
should be given to releasing
individuals (via a tax break) if
they subscribe to some sufficient
alternative pension system.
This would take some persons
out of the system, lessening the
strain on it, while generating
funds for very badly needed
capital investment.

Among the many active
political groups on campus, the
Stanford College Republicans
(CRs) occupy an inconspicuous
place. Yet they have been
moderately successful at
involving students in the

political process.
The key to the organization is
activism. The CRs' main goal is
to take advantage of our input
into the Republican party and to
involve as many as possible in
the political process. Most
students are unaware of
the political machinery which
quietly determines the course of

our lives. The job is to open up
that machinery, clean it out and
inject some fresh ideas into it.
This year the group hopes to
investigate proposed legislation
concerning coastal development,
curbs on bureaucracy and
political reform. phi| Ashey
