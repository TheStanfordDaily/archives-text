# Palestine still key to crisis
##

The United States has been
trying, at least apparently, to
bring peace to the Middle East
since 1967. After eight years of
negotiations and one war, the
Israelis vacated a few miles of
the Sinai. If this is a right way to
reach peace in that area, I
wonder how long it will take to
achieve this goal?
In his column (Daily, Sept.
30), William Ross says that
supplying the Middle East
(particularly Israel) with huge
amounts of weapons will never
"buy" peace, but will delay an
expected war for about two
years. Ross also says that by
asking for arms, both Israel and
Egypt intend to fight another
war. We thus deduce that the
United States helps to make
another war by supplying that
area with more arms, then....
Who wants peace?
All the Middle East countries
claim that they want peace, but
each has its own definition for
peace. The Arab countries will
accept peace if they retain the
land they lost in 1967 war and if
the Palestinian problem is
solved. The Israelis (probably)
will accept peace if they get
"safe borders" and sufficient
power to remain superior to
their enemies.
We completely agree with the
points mentioned in Ross's
article about the last peace
agreement. However, suppose
that both the Arabs' and the
Israelis' conditions were satisfied
(by some means), then what
about the Palestinians?
We doubt that the Palestinian
problem can be solved by the
negotiations with Anwar Sadat
in Cairo or with any other Arab
leader. Therefore, we would like
to emphasize here that the
Palestinian problem can never be
solved without discussing that
with the Palestinians themselves,
represented by the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO).
Root of the problem
The Palestinian problem is
the core of the whole debate in
the Middle East, and we feel that
no peace can be settled by
ignoring the Palestinians. If a
peace is to be achieved in that
area, then it is better first to
consider, or to think of, the
solution of the main problem
rather than the side problems of
the Middle East conflict. Hence,
no lasting peace could ever be
achieved as long as Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger is not
convinced to accept the idea of
negotiating with the Palestinians.
When everybody speaks
about peace, he thinks
immediately about the future of
the "State of Israel" before
suggesting any solution for the
problem. We wonder why
nobody ever thought about the
presence of 3.5 millions of the
Palestinians, most of whom have
passports, but without country.
They have been homeless
without personality, without
integrity, for 27 years.
When somebody hates his
( life, he may commit suicide. But
if he has a principle he may
instead become what people call
"a terrorist" because he is
desperate of everything.
We believe that the U.S.
government has the key for a
solution in the Middle East and
can achieve a fair peace in that
area if it wants. We hope that
the United States will plan for a
more serious intention for peace.
But until then, we don't think
that the present peace missions
will bring a lasting peace to that
area; they are just making a
"temporary" cease-fire.
