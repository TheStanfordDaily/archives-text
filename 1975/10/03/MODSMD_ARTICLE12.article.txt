# Hearst intrigue grows
## The 						mystery isn't solved yet 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
The Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA)
was never really big news.
Patty Hearst was. And is. ,
For over a year and a half, people who
cared little about the death of six SLA
members in a shootout with authorities,
speculated about Patricia Hearst.
Had she really joined the SLA? Was she
brainwashed? Drugged? Perhaps dead? News
waxed and waned, and what the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) proudly called
its greatest search ever continually led up blind
alleys.
No matter, the television watchers said over
their morning cornflakes. When Patty claimed
to have joined the SLA, hadn't Steven Weed,
her sometime fiancee, said she was
brainwashed? Hadn't her parents intimated the
same? Wouldn't they be in a position to know?
Of course, said the cornflake eaters, as the
FBI eagerly pounced on yet another
unsuspecting secretary bearing a vague
resemblance to the nondescript fugitive.
Anyway, soon they'd catch her, and the whole
story would come out. Or so the argument
went.
Doubts survive capture
In late September, as the whole world
knows, the first part of that prediction came
true. They caught her. But the second part
proved more elusive — it may be some time
until the entire story comes out.
The initial arrest went off more peacefully
than many had expected. Tania, as she called
herself for awhile, put up no resistance, which
led many to speculate over dinner that her
"conversion" had, in fact, been something less
than wholehearted.
But Hearst threw a monkeywrench into the
works when she listed her occupation as
"urban guerilla." Moreover, at the time of her
arrest, she was alone in a room with Wendy
Yoshimura, another fugitive.
Unless people such as her mother (who
begged newsmen to refer to the capture as a
"rescue") were prepared to argue that
Yoshimura had held Patty captive, the
"involuntary conversion theory" would

become hard to substantiate, even on the
morning commuter train.
As, in fact, it did.
But Hearst money can buy many things,
and it bought Patty an expensive battery of
lawyers, who (with her assistance, presumably)
immediately prepared a lengthy affidavit,
claiming she had been brainwashed, drugged
and remained in a state of mental confusion.
Change of occupation
The affidavit claimed Patty had been locked
in a closet for nine weeks and forced to take part
in a bank robbery against her will. The lawyers
presented this to a judge who had denied bail,
as he was somewhat hesitant about turning
loose a professed "urban guerilla" — even
though she had since modified that statement
to read "unemployed."
In any case, the affidavit contained several
gaping holes. It failed to explain why Tania,
alone in a parked van, had apparently fired an
automatic weapon to cover the escape of her
comrades Teko and Yolanda (William and
Emily Harris) from a sporting goods store. Or
why she had called herself an "urban guerilla."
Or any number of other inconsistencies. And
there were immediately stinging, if predictable,
charges that the affidavit had been
manufactured long before her captive — all
denied, of course.
Then Rolling Stone magazine took careful
aim at the statement, with the first part of a
copyrighted "Inside Story" this week.
Although that story did not dispute much of
the substance of the affidavit (which,
according to Hearst attorney Terrence
Hallinan, "speaks for itself,") it filled in some
of the aforementioned holes.
The more things change. . .
According to the Stone article, whether
voluntary or not, Patricia Campbell Hearst's
conversion from a spacy, vaguely liberal,
spoiled heiress, into Tania, a spacy, vaguely
revolutionary, spoiled fugitive, was most
certainly sincere.
She did not want to return to her parents,
the article said — she turned down a chance to
do iust that. Her love for slain SLA member
Cujo (William Wolfe) was sincere, her pain at

his death powerful.
The Stone article portrays Tania as a
somewhat bewildered but certainly sincere
radical, prepared for an indefinite stay
underground, but always ready to use a gun, in
self-defense, or to "off a pig." This is hardly
compatible with the affidavit's picture of a
drugged and duped kidnap victim, unsure of
herself and her status.
If at next week's hearing Patty Hearst is
declared competent to stand trial, the
cornflake-munching public may finally get its
wish and hear the full story; if not, the truth
will remain hidden — but then, there's a lot of
that going around.
