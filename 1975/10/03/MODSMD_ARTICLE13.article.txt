# After architecture is cut
## Which program will get the ax next? 
### PHILIP FEDER 
In quiet, unobtrusive style, Provost William
Miller announced in July that the architecture
program here would be phased out after this
academic year.
The decision was made, Miller wrote to the
62 architecture majors, because of his "feeling
that the program is inherently unstable in
concept. A stable and excellent undergraduate
program implies a significant graduate
program."
Miller's decision may hold wide-ranging
implications for Stanford students. At a time
when budget reduction has the highest priority
in administrators' minds, programs such as
architecture are bound to be slashed.
In his letter, Miller also said: "Without solid
graduate and research feedback, the
undergraduate program will tend to erode in its
attractiveness to faculty, its intellectual vigor
and its quality relative to other Stanford
programs."
Thrown on the dump
The implication is that an undergraduate
program without a significant graduate
program to back it up is not worth supporting
in this University.

And the architecture program is not bereft
of members who have pushed for such a
graduate division in the past. Assoc.
Architecture Prof. Robert Mittlestadt, who
heads the program, proposed a graduate
program to Miller. That proposal was rejected,
again for budgetary reasons.
It appears that the University had to decide
on one of three routes with respect to the
architecture program. First, it could have
enlarged the program to include a graduate
division, but at great cost. Second, it could have left
the program as it stood, with a miniscule
budget of about $35,000 per year. However,
the University took the third alternative of
abolishing the program altogether.
Cost slashing policy
The first alternative was rejected because of
the budgetary concerns. The University is in
the midst of a huge budget reduction program
that intends to cut $10 million from operating
expenses over a three-year period.
In addition, in the eyes of many here,
including Engineering Dean William Kays, it is
difficult for any school in the West to compete
with UC Berkeley in architecture.
"Professors here [at Stanford] complain

that Berkeley's architecture school is too
large," Kays said last summer.
One wonders whether the University has
just given up on the architecture program here
and decided that it would be absurd to upstage
Berkeley on this one.
Lack of understanding
In Mittlestadt's eyes, the University "has
never understood architecture" â€” both in
terms of the study of the discipline and in
relation to its practical applications. If that is
the case, then the University is depriving able
architecture students of an alternative to
Berkeley.
To be sure, it was quite simple for the
University to phase out architecture. It has two
untenured faculty positions, one of which is
filled by offering several visiting lecturers an
honorarium.
The University, then, could cut out
architecture without worrying about finding a
place for tenured faculty members.
But the decision does signal that other
programs, which either don't have a large
amount of financial support or don't have
many tenured faculty members, are in trouble.
