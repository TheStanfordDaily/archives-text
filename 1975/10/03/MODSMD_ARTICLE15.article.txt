## 'Revolution' hits firefighters But 'it's just a job' 
### DAVE ANSLEY 
Firemen at Stanford have
ceased to exist; they are no more.
Oh, sure, you can still hear the
wailing sirens in the middle of
the night, and watch shiny red
firetrucks go careening down
Campus Drive occasionally, but
those aren't firemen driving. Nor
are they manning the hoses. And
next time the cat you snuck into
your dorm gets stuck in a tree,
you can't call a fireman.
From now on, the public ser
vants under those yellow hats
and heavy black coats are to be
known as firefighters.

The revolution has reached
the Stanford Fire Department
and the old-fashioned sexist
term, no longer applies. Linda
Bammann, one of 14 students
employed by the department,
has just completed a month of
full-time training. She began her
regular duties Wednesday as
Stanford's first female firefigh
ter.
"Regular duties" means being
in the fire station every other
night (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.), prepared
to go dashing off at a moment's
notice into the darkness to any
emergency in the Stanford area.

Typical emergencies are usually
false alarms, but the crews are
ready to rescue people, put out
car fires and battle structural
blazes.
Bammann hasn't yet been in
contact with an actual fire (pol
lution laws don't even allow
training fires), but says "we've
rehearsed all the procedures and
I'm not worried." Neither are her
co-workers.
Not too strenuous
Dan Wood, another new
firefighter, says, "Linda does
just as much work as everybody
else." She says that the training
period was nothing too strenu
ous and she has been running
and lifting weights to keep in
shape.
Bammann doesn't see her pos
ition as having anything to do
with Women's Lib, though. "It's
just a job — if I couldn't do it, I
wouldn't be here."
She says she hasn't encoun
tered any serious objections
from anyone either. "Just some
jokes and razzing from my
friends. But nobody's upset
about it."
Student firefighters, who sup
plement the regular salaried
force, receive the job as a form of
financial aid. Bammann and her
five fellow rookies — Wood, Jim
Noonan, Doug Nanni, Dave
Ramies and Miles White — were
chosen from a group of about 25
applicants last spring, which in
cluded two other women. Selec
tion was made after a series of

interviews.
Starting pay is $225 a month
and the students are provided
with free rooms in the station.
The rooms are doubles, but
Bammann gets "a very nice, big
room, all to myself." Although a
kitchen is available in the sta
tion, she says she'll probably
join an eating club or the food
service.
Rest deal
"It's a great job, and it's help
ing quite a bit financially,"
Bammann notes. "It teaches me a
lot and it helps me get through
school. I couldn't ask for a better
deal."
A sophomore, Bammann does
not expect her studies or social
life to be hampered by her job.
She only has to be at the station
every other night, "so as long as I
can study here, I'm OK." If she
has any night classes, she can
swap duties with another
firefighter for an hour or two.
"There aren't that many night
runs anyway, so it shouldn't af
fect my homework," she adds.
Unusual jobs seem to be
Bammann's forte. Last year, she
applied for a summer job paint
ing the Mackinaw Bridge bet
ween northern and southern
Michigan. She wasn't success
ful, but she was hired as a ship's
hostess onboard a passenger
cargo ship which circumnavi
gated South America.
Bammann doesn't plan a
career as a firefighter, but she
adds, "you never know."

Firemen at Stanford have
ceased to exist; they are no more.
Oh, sure, you can still hear the
wailing sirens in the middle of
the night, and watch shiny red
firetrucks go careening down
Campus Drive occasionally, but
those aren't firemen driving. Nor
are they manning the hoses. And
next time the cat you snuck into
your dorm gets stuck in a tree,
you can't call a fireman.
From now on, the public ser
vants under those yellow hats
and heavy black coats are to be
known as firefighters.

The revolution has reached
the Stanford Fire Department
and the old-fashioned sexist
term, no longer applies. Linda
Bammann, one of 14 students
employed by the department,
has just completed a month of
full-time training. She began her
regular duties Wednesday as
Stanford's first female firefigh
ter.
"Regular duties" means being
in the fire station every other
night (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.), prepared
to go dashing off at a moment's
notice into the darkness to any
emergency in the Stanford area.

Typical emergencies are usually
false alarms, but the crews are
ready to rescue people, put out
car fires and battle structural
blazes.
Bammann hasn't yet been in
contact with an actual fire (pol
lution laws don't even allow
training fires), but says "we've
rehearsed all the procedures and
I'm not worried." Neither are her
co-workers.
Not too strenuous
Dan Wood, another new
firefighter, says, "Linda does
just as much work as everybody
else." She says that the training
period was nothing too strenu
ous and she has been running
and lifting weights to keep in
shape.
Bammann doesn't see her pos
ition as having anything to do
with Women's Lib, though. "It's
just a job — if I couldn't do it, I
wouldn't be here."
She says she hasn't encoun
tered any serious objections
from anyone either. "Just some
jokes and razzing from my
friends. But nobody's upset
about it."
Student firefighters, who sup
plement the regular salaried
force, receive the job as a form of
financial aid. Bammann and her
five fellow rookies — Wood, Jim
Noonan, Doug Nanni, Dave
Ramies and Miles White — were
chosen from a group of about 25
applicants last spring, which in
cluded two other women. Selec
tion was made after a series of

interviews.
Starting pay is $225 a month
and the students are provided
with free rooms in the station.
The rooms are doubles, but
Bammann gets "a very nice, big
room, all to myself." Although a
kitchen is available in the sta
tion, she says she'll probably
join an eating club or the food
service.
Rest deal
"It's a great job, and it's help
ing quite a bit financially,"
