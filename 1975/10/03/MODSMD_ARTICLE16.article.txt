## UT head under fire 
### KATHY BATTS 
University of Texas President Lorene Rogers has already made
history once this year — she's the first woman to be appointed
president of a major state university. By the end of this month, if the
faculty and students have their way, she may also have the shortest
term on record at the school.
Rogers, a 61-year-old biochemist was appointed to the post Sept.
12, on a 5-3 vote of the university's board of regents. Lady Bird
Johnson, the only woman regent, voted against the appointment.
The campus community has been raising an outcry since school
opened last month. Since Rogers was rejected as a presidential
choice four times by a student-faculty advisory panel, some faculty
members and students have begun a series of protest rallies and
other activities aimed at forcing Rogers to resign.
Over 1000 students turned up for a rally last week, where stu
dents shouted "This is war!" A similar rally held the week before
was attended by over 4000 students.
Professors have accused Rogers of living in "an isolated, insu
lated, ivory-domed tower." Her fourth-floor office is locked and
heavily-guarded.
Although Rogers denies charges made against her, the Texas
faculty contends that she, along with other university adminis
trators, maintains an "enemies list" of liberal and vocal professors
who have been denied tenure and pay increases.
Rogers claims that last year, as interim president, she cut pay
increases for 78 professors because of budgetary problems, not
because of their politics. Seven professors have filed suit against
her, claiming their First Amendment rights were violated when
Rogers reduced salary increases recommended for each of the
seven by their deans and department chairmen.
Rogers' opponents are also claiming they were denied a say in
picking the new president. Although the advisory panel rejected
her, the presidential selection committee — made up of regents,
university officials, a faculty member, a student and a former stu
dent — submitted her name anyway, along with three others, for
final selection.
Rogers said last week that she had not particularly wanted the job
when Stephen Spurr was dismissed last year and she was ap
pointed as interim president. Although protests were loud then,
even from campus feminists, she said she had thought the protests
would die down. Instead they have increased. Now that her ap
pointment ife official, however, she said resignation is out of the
question.
Two committees within the Texas House of Representatives are
now looking into the university administration and the process of
Rogers' appointment.
