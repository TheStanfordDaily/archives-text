## 'Wild,' early winter predicted 
### 
DUBLIN, N.H. (AP) - The
184 th edition of the Old
Farmer's Almanac, out yester
day, predicts an early winter and
a drought next summer.
Abe Weatherwise, a
pseudonym for the magazine's
weather researchers, says the
winter "will start out wild and
then settle down to being mild
through January."
Skiers in the Rockies,
Apalachians and New England
will be "jumping for joy," Abe
says, but others may be less
grateful as a blizzard sweeps ac
ross the Great Plains in late Feb
ruary, bringing new snow as far
as New England.
In the summer, farmers in the
Midwest and West will suffer
"serious drought and frequent
duststorms." Weatherwise pre

diets. "The abnormally hot
summer in the wheat and corn
belts should be of concern to all
.farmers - and consumers."
Although the almanac's fore
casts have yet to be taken seri
ously by professional
meteorologists, publisher C.
Robertson Trowbridge insists
the techniques - a use of various
"cycles of nature" plus a close
study of the moon and sun — are
legitimate.
"When the order of the uni
verse is becoming more appar
ent, to have something as big as
the weather happen just
haphazardly is not true," he
says."The concept that men can
predict the weather is true."
The astrological charts and
elaborate weather tables that
form the basis for the forecasts
have been an almanac feature
since the first edition in 1792.
Trowbridge says the general
predictions are virtually always
correct, and the almanac claims
an over-all accuracy rate of 75 to
HO percent.
Last year, the almanac pre
dicted that winter 1974-75
would be colder than normal,
and that this past summer would
be especially warm.
The almanac, the country's

oldest continuouspublication.is
assembled today in an 18th cen
tury house and two connecting
barns in this small New Hamp
shire town not far from the Mas
sachusetts border.
In addition to the forecasts, it
is packed full of trivia, planting
tables, farm animal gestation
period charts, zodiac secrets, re
cipes and advertsing.

Trowbridge, who is also a state
senator, says he expects to sell
about 3.5 million copies this
year at 75 cents apiece, com
pared with 900.000 a decade
ago.
He attributes the increase to
improved distribution, the re
cent interest in space, nostalgia
and the "return to nature" trend.

cent interest in space, nostalgia
and the "return to nature" trend.
DUBLIN, N.H. (AP) - The
184 th edition of the Old
Farmer's Almanac, out yester
day, predicts an early winter and
a drought next summer.
Abe Weatherwise, a
pseudonym for the magazine's
weather researchers, says the
winter "will start out wild and
then settle down to being mild
through January."
Skiers in the Rockies,
Apalachians and New England
will be "jumping for joy," Abe
says, but others may be less
grateful as a blizzard sweeps ac
ross the Great Plains in late Feb
ruary, bringing new snow as far
as New England.
In the summer, farmers in the
Midwest and West will suffer
"serious drought and frequent
duststorms." Weatherwise pre

diets. "The abnormally hot
summer in the wheat and corn
belts should be of concern to all
.farmers - and consumers."
Although the almanac's fore
casts have yet to be taken seri
ously by professional
meteorologists, publisher C.
Robertson Trowbridge insists
the techniques - a use of various
"cycles of nature" plus a close
study of the moon and sun — are
legitimate.
"When the order of the uni
verse is becoming more appar
ent, to have something as big as
the weather happen just
haphazardly is not true," he
says."The concept that men can
predict the weather is true."
The astrological charts and
elaborate weather tables that
form the basis for the forecasts
have been an almanac feature
since the first edition in 1792.
Trowbridge says the general
predictions are virtually always
correct, and the almanac claims
an over-all accuracy rate of 75 to
HO percent.
Last year, the almanac pre
dicted that winter 1974-75
would be colder than normal,
and that this past summer would
be especially warm.
The almanac, the country's

oldest continuouspublication.is
assembled today in an 18th cen
tury house and two connecting
barns in this small New Hamp
shire town not far from the Mas
sachusetts border.
In addition to the forecasts, it
is packed full of trivia, planting
tables, farm animal gestation
period charts, zodiac secrets, re
cipes and advertsing.

Trowbridge, who is also a state
senator, says he expects to sell
about 3.5 million copies this
year at 75 cents apiece, com
pared with 900.000 a decade
ago.
He attributes the increase to
improved distribution, the re
cent interest in space, nostalgia
and the "return to nature" trend.
