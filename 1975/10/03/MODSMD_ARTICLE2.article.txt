# Phone Center closes early
## 
### JACK VAUGHN 
Because of lower demand for new
phones than anticipated, Pacific
Telephone's new Phone Center trailer
will close its doors at 4:30 today,
according to local Pacific Telephone
manager Alan Garrett.
Garrett announced that people
wishing service after that time must
call the business office downtown.
"We made the decision to close
[the center] early, after requests for
new phones dwindled from an average
of 375 per day to 50 per day by
Wednesday," Garrett said.
Garrett added that he is considering
opening the center earlier next year
and keeping it open only until the first
day of classes. This year, he "had
guessed on about 2300 requests out of
3400 potential phone users. As it turns
out, we have taken only 1850 orders."
Dorm residents generally praised
the modularized installation procedure
instituted this year, which allowed
students to pick up their phones from
the Phone Center trailer and install
them themselves. Students expressed
enthusiasm for the novelty of walking
away from the trailer with a receiver
set in hand, and for the reduction in
installation costs resulting from the
new method.
"I like the idea," said one
sophomore in Wilbur Hall. "It's worth
putting it in myself to save $12."
While applauding the new system's
concept, several students complained
of delays in getting the phones to

work. "It took 72 hours for the phone
to be put into service," a Toyon
resident reported. "My roommate had
to go back four times to get it into
action," she said.
Garrett explained the problems in
activating the phones were due both to
volume and a greater variety of phone
options.
"We have processed over 1700
orders in five days," Garrett stated.
"These kind of problems occur when
you offer so many unpredictable
options, such as message unit versus
flat rate service and Touch Tone vs.
dial-type service."
Students opting for Touch Tone
phones seemed to have had the
greatest difficulty. "Three or four
people on my hall have had to call
about their Touch Tones," an RA in
Toyon said. Once service calls wore
made, however, the students reports
repairs were completed quickly.
The trouble with Touch Tone
phones, Garrett said, resulted from the
complex color-coding required in
wiring for the Touch Tone system to
operate. The company did not have
sufficient time, he explained, to
"check each line for Touch Tone
compatibility." As a result, "we had to
send an installer to 15 dorms" to
assure compatibility, he said.
Fraternities and independent
houses, Garrett said, are getting the
modular system room by room.
"There are different wiring problems
in each room" in these residences, he
noted,so each installation this year will

include a conversion to the modular
system.
In future years, these houses will
receive their phones as dorm residents
do now, he said. Some Row students
complained of having to arrange to
have their rooms available for phone
servicemen's visits.

BEING CUT OFF — The phone company will close down its Phone Center on
campus after today. A lower demand for phones than expected occasioned the
early departure.
