FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) -
A former college professor has
pleaded gulty to reduced charges
of conspiracy in the "love
experiment" abduction of a
Purdue University coed.
Thomas R. Lippert, 25, was
to go on trial in U.S. District
Court here on kidnaping charges
Wednesday. Instead he pleaded
guilty to two conspiracy charges.
Lippert was a professor at
Southwest State College in
Marshall, Minn., when he
kidnaped Susan Cochran, 20, a
Purdue coed from Little Falls,
N.J., in November 1974,
according to court testimony.
With the aid of a
coffin-shaped black box, he

attempted to make Cochran fall
in love with him while she was
being held in the basement of
Lippert's home in Marshall,
authorities said.
"It is a strange looking
contraption," U.S. Atty. John
R. Wilks said. "The bottom is
lined with 1400 nail heads wired
to a fence charger like farmers
use on barbed wire fences."
According to the original
kidnap indictment, Cochran was
forced to lay in the box wearing
night clothes and was subjected
to electrical shocks.
Three weeks after the
abduction, FBI agents found
Cochran unharmed.
Lippert, twice married, was
an assistant professor of business
administration at Southwest
State College at the time of the
kidnaping.
