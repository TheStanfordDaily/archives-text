# Candidates getting extra benefits from Secret Service protection
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Democratic presidential cam
paigners are gaining valuable
political fringe benefits along
with their new Secret Service
protection although the agency
says its men won't "participate
in the politics of the candi
dates."
Campaign aides say the Secret
Service can't avoid helping a
candidate when it sets out to
guard him.
Agents are deploying to guard
four candidates now or in the
near future, with more to be co
vered later.
In the process, the government
will help finance the candidates'
campaign travels and take over
much of the advance work that is

essential to a presidential candi
date.
Tricolor booklet
The Secret Service has issued
an eight-page, red. white and
blue booklet describing what it
will and won't do as it seeks "to
insure a safe environment for
your candidate."
The Secret Service refuses to
say how many agents are as
signed to a candidate on grounds
that would breach security. But a
Democratic campaign aide said
as many as 20 were assigned to
each candidate at the height of
the 1972 presidential primary
season.
Another said he had been told
that about 12 would be traveling
with his candidate.
Stringent campaign spending
limits have curtailed the use of
chartered airplanes by the can
didates this year, but with the
Secret Service aboard, that may
change.
Turboprop
For example, Rep. Morris K.
Udall may switch from small
planes to a faster, more comfort
able, 20-seat turboprop when he
uses chartered flights. Secret
Service agents are expected to
occupy up to 12 seats, meaning
the government would pay more
than half the charter expense.
Government advance work is
an even bigger boon to the can
didate. According to the Secret
Service brochure a day or two
before a candidate visits a city,
an agent will go there to check
out and coordinate security ar
rangements.
"Other advance arrangements
are made, including logistics,
coordination of press identifica
tion and the designation of
emergency sites," the booklet
says.
A Democratic politician put it
in plain language:
"The logistics of moving the

candidate around suddenly are
in their (the Secret Service
men's) hands, and they do a
first-class job." he said. "That's a
big advantage."
This allows the candidates'
advance men to concentrate on
political tasks and not the detail
work of mapping routes and
other logistics.
The Democrats due for protec
tion now or soon are Alabama
Gov. George C. Wallace, Udall,
Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas
and former Gov. Jimmy Garter of
Georgia.
Sen. Henry M. Jackson of

Washington hasn't yet decided
when he wants the Secret Ser
vice to join him. and former
North Carolina Gov. Terry San
ford has declined protection.
The 1976 campaign is the
third in which the Secret Service
has guarded candidates, a prac
tice begun on June 6. 1968, the
day Sen. Robert F. Kennedy died
of an assassin's bullets in Los
Angeles.
The Secret Service booklet
says that in 1968, the agency pro
tected 11 candidates who made
700 separate campaign appear
ances.

the government would pay more
than half the charter expense.
Government advance work is
an even bigger boon to the can
didate. According to the Secret
Service brochure a day or two
before a candidate visits a city,
an agent will go there to check
out and coordinate security ar
rangements.
"Other advance arrangements
are made, including logistics,
coordination of press identifica
tion and the designation of
emergency sites," the booklet
says.
A Democratic politician put it
in plain language:
"The logistics of moving the

candidate around suddenly are
in their (the Secret Service
men's) hands, and they do a
first-class job." he said. "That's a
big advantage."
This allows the candidates'
advance men to concentrate on
political tasks and not the detail
work of mapping routes and
other logistics.
The Democrats due for protec
tion now or soon are Alabama
Gov. George C. Wallace, Udall,
Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas
and former Gov. Jimmy Garter of
Georgia.
Sen. Henry M. Jackson of

Washington hasn't yet decided
when he wants the Secret Ser
vice to join him. and former
North Carolina Gov. Terry San
ford has declined protection.
The 1976 campaign is the
third in which the Secret Service
has guarded candidates, a prac

Angeles.

WASHINGTON (AP) —
Democratic presidential cam
paigners are gaining valuable
political fringe benefits along
with their new Secret Service
protection although the agency
says its men won't "participate
in the politics of the candi
dates."
Campaign aides say the Secret
Service can't avoid helping a
candidate when it sets out to
guard him.
Agents are deploying to guard
four candidates now or in the
near future, with more to be co
vered later.
In the process, the government
will help finance the candidates'
campaign travels and take over
much of the advance work that is

essential to a presidential candi
date.
Tricolor booklet
The Secret Service has issued
an eight-page, red. white and
blue booklet describing what it
will and won't do as it seeks "to
insure a safe environment for
your candidate."
The Secret Service refuses to
say how many agents are as
signed to a candidate on grounds
that would breach security. But a
Democratic campaign aide said
as many as 20 were assigned to
each candidate at the height of
the 1972 presidential primary
season.
Another said he had been told
that about 12 would be traveling
with his candidate.
Stringent campaign spending
limits have curtailed the use of
chartered airplanes by the can
didates this year, but with the
Secret Service aboard, that may
change.
Turboprop
For example, Rep. Morris K.
Udall may switch from small
planes to a faster, more comfort
able, 20-seat turboprop when he
uses chartered flights. Secret
Service agents are expected to
occupy up to 12 seats, meaning
the government would pay more
than half the charter expense.
