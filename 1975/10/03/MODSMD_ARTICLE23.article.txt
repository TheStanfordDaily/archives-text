# State court voids no arrest order

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The
state Court of Appeal has over
turned most of a lower court
order limiting the enforcement
of prostitution laws in Oakland.
The lower court had ordered
Oakland police to stop dis
criminating against women in
making prostitution arrests.
The appeals court upheld
Tuesday the section of the in
junction that ended the practice
of putting women arrested on
prostitution charges in quaran
tine, unless men arrested for the
same misdemeanor are subject to
the same restrictions.
The injunction came after
three women claimed in
Alameda County Superior Court
that methods of enforcing the
prostitution law discriminated
against women on the basis of
sex alone.
The court issued a preliminary
injunction restricting the
methods by which the law could
be enforced. It prevented offi
cials from enforcing the prostitu

tion law by any method sys
tematically resulting in a greater
likelihood of the arrest of women
than men: engaging in activity or
scheme encouraging solicita
tion; subjecting women to full
custodial arrest on a basis not
applied to men in the same type
of offense, and imposing the
quarantine restriction on
women.
The law enforcement officials
asked the state appeal court for a
writ to prevent enforcement of
the injunction.
The appellate court noted that
there had been no ruling on the
constitutionality of the law it
self. It said only that it was in
valid as applied.
It agreed, however, that the
manner which the women had
been quarantined denied them
equal protection.
