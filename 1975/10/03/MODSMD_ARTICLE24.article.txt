NEW YORK (AP) — A new
virus-hunting drug shows prom
ise of knocking out a virus that
causes both blindness and a
heretofore incurable venereal
disease, a Harvard scientist said
Monday.
The virus is Herpes simplex,
also the cause of "cold sores"
and fever blisters.
When Herpes Type One in
fects eyes, it can cause blindness
by damaging the cornea or win
dow of the eye.
Herpes Type Two is a leading
cause of venereal disease, espe
cially painful in women and
threatening death or damage to
their babies who may become in
fected during birth. It's been cal
led incurable in the sense that no
drug has been able to penetrate
deeply enough into body tissues
where the virus "hides" between
attacks or outbreaks.
The new drug can penetrate
deeply into tissues and in rabbits
has proved very effective against
Herpes infections on the eyes
and genitals said Dr. Deborah
Pavan Langston, 35»
The new drug is named
ARA-AMP and was developed
by Dr. Langston and biochemists
of Parke-Davis Co. in Detroit.
