# Entertainment
## Bringing culture to Stanford is their job 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
An office on campus that is
little known and yet affects all
of our entertainment
opportunities is the Office Of
Public Events, hidden next to
the Commons, behind Encina
Hall.
From this office comes the
coordination of campus events
that are not normally found in
the community, and that we
might not have the chance to see
without going all the way to San
Francisco.
The people at Public Events
— Director Tom Bacchetti,
Assoc. Director Lynn Bonde,
and Audience Development
Coordinator Shirley Kelley —
work, to use an overworked
cliche, to "enrich our lives
culturally."
Bacchetti explains their
function in more detail. "We
work in five particular areas, all
of which have to do with the
general type of public events.
"First is administration of
University policy as it pertains to
events that are open to the
public. In that context we have
responsibility for scheduling of
space for events anybody wants
to put on, with the exception of
events that are put on by the
athletic department and events
that are resident-based — if they
take place in the dormitory."
Their work encompasses
lectures film series, concerts, and
organizational meetings by such
varied university-related groups
as administrative offices,
departments, schools or
registered student organizations.
They also work with student
organizations, helping them put
on events. Bacchetti says, "We
work with them and try and
provide them with some advice
and counsel as to how to get
things on, where they can get
necessary publicity, assistance,
how they get their technical
support together, and all that
kind of stuff."
The Office of Public Events is
also responsible for the
management of public
ceremonies, i.e. Founder's Day,
the Baccalaureate and
Commencement.
Commencement alone takes
about six months of their time.
The last six weeks of the
quarter alone are devoted
exclusively to coordinating
activities for that day. According
to Assoc. Director Bonde,
"It's like planning somebody
else's wedding — or a war,
depending on which day you ask
us."
The lecture committee wants
to "bring very fine scholars" to
the campus, hopefully to deliver
speeches pertaining to the
research they have done. The
recent Walter Cronkite lecture
was part of that series.
Organizations wishing to
bring lecturers to the campus,
says Bonde, can apply to Public
Events for financial assistance.
Last year they donated funds to
Women's Day International Fair;
a visit by Ousmane Sembene, an
African filmmaker; and Wally
Soyenka. "The money is not
great," says Bonde "but
sometimes it makes the
difference between having a
speaker and not."

In the performing arts aspect
of the Public Events Office, are
the upcoming concerts for Sour
Cream and the LA Four. The
office has been bringing to
Stanford "touring professional
artists and attractions that
people wouldn't normally have a
chance to see otherwise" for
seven years, says Bacchetti.
"It's fairly eclectic in terms
of kinds of things that we do
from recorder music, which is
the first thing coming up, to
jazz, to modern dance. We don't
get into pop-rock programming
because that's more or less the
domain of ASSU Special
Events.
"We're also working to
develop different kinds of
non-performance things to go
along with it — residency
activities, essentially —
mini-concerts in the dormitories
by visiting artists so that
students can meet them
informally outside of the
performance environment."
Bacchetti introduced the

"Student Introductory Plan"
three years ago. One free
admission to one event is given
to each new student — transfer!
or freshman —as part of a
dormitory group.
Following is the Office Of
Public Events' performing arts
schedule for fall quarter.
The famed Dutch recorder
trio Sour Cream will be in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Tuesday
Oct. 14 at 8 p.m.
LA Four, a jazz group, is
scheduled for 8 p.m., Oct. 24, in
Memorial Auditorium followed
by Hartford Ballet Oct. 30, 31,
Memorial Auditorium 8 p.m.,
and the Contemporary Chamber
Ensemble, Nov. 7, Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, 8 p.m.
The Guarneri Quartet will
perform in Dinkelspiel Nov. 11,
and 14 at 8 p.m. and 16 at 2:30
p.m. Ron Thomas, cellist, will
perform on Nov. 21 in Tresidder
Lounge at 8 p.m.; and Paco De
Lucia, flamenco guitarist on
Dec. 5 in Memorial Auditorium
at 8 p.m.

Sour Cream recorder artists
are Frans Brueggen, Walter van
Hauwe and Kees Boeke. Their
concert music ranges from the
Renaissance to the avant-garde.
According to the Cleveland Plain
Dealer, they are a group of
"three young non-conformists
.. . actually professors of music
at conservatories in Holland. . .
They look like a rock group and
play like angels."
The LA Four concert will
feature Laurendo Almeida on the
guitar, Ray Brown on the bass,
Shelly Manne on the drums and
Bud Shank on the sax. They
have been described as
"incredible ... unbelievable ...
sensational ... truly a sound to
be heard ... and an experience
to be remembered."
More information concerning
these events may be obtained at
the Office of Public Events.

about six months of their time.
The last six weeks of the
quarter alone are devoted
exclusively to coordinating
activities for that day. According
to Assoc. Director Bonde,
"It's like planning somebody
else's wedding — or a war,
depending on which day you ask
us."
The lecture committee wants
to "bring very fine scholars" to
the campus, hopefully to deliver
speeches pertaining to the
research they have done. The
recent Walter Cronkite lecture
was part of that series.
Organizations wishing to
bring lecturers to the campus,
says Bonde, can apply to Public
Events for financial assistance.
Last year they donated funds to
Women's Day International Fair;
a visit by Ousmane Sembene, an
African filmmaker; and Wally
Soyenka. "The money is not
great," says Bonde "but
sometimes it makes the
difference between having a
speaker and not."

In the performing arts aspect
of the Public Events Office, are
the upcoming concerts for Sour
Cream and the LA Four. The
office has been bringing to
Stanford "touring professional
artists and attractions that
people wouldn't normally have a
chance to see otherwise" for
seven years, says Bacchetti.
"It's fairly eclectic in terms
of kinds of things that we do
from recorder music, which is
the first thing coming up, to
jazz, to modern dance. We don't
get into pop-rock programming
because that's more or less the
domain of ASSU Special
Events.
"We're also working to
develop different kinds of
non-performance things to go
along with it — residency
activities, essentially —
mini-concerts in the dormitories
by visiting artists so that
students can meet them
informally outside of the
performance environment."
Bacchetti introduced the

"Student Introductory Plan"
three years ago. One free
admission to one event is given
to each new student — transfer!
or freshman —as part of a
dormitory group.
Following is the Office Of
Public Events' performing arts
schedule for fall quarter.
The famed Dutch recorder
trio Sour Cream will be in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Tuesday
Oct. 14 at 8 p.m.
LA Four, a jazz group, is
scheduled for 8 p.m., Oct. 24, in
Memorial Auditorium followed
by Hartford Ballet Oct. 30, 31,
Memorial Auditorium 8 p.m.,
and the Contemporary Chamber
Ensemble, Nov. 7, Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, 8 p.m.
The Guarneri Quartet will
perform in Dinkelspiel Nov. 11,
and 14 at 8 p.m. and 16 at 2:30
p.m. Ron Thomas, cellist, will
perform on Nov. 21 in Tresidder
Lounge at 8 p.m.; and Paco De
Lucia, flamenco guitarist on
Dec. 5 in Memorial Auditorium
at 8 p.m.

Sour Cream recorder artists
are Frans Brueggen, Walter van
Hauwe and Kees Boeke. Their
concert music ranges from the
Renaissance to the avant-garde.
According to the Cleveland Plain
Dealer, they are a group of
"three young non-conformists
.. . actually professors of music
at conservatories in Holland. . .
They look like a rock group and
play like angels."
The LA Four concert will
feature Laurendo Almeida on the
guitar, Ray Brown on the bass,
Shelly Manne on the drums and
Bud Shank on the sax. They
have been described as
"incredible ... unbelievable ...
sensational ... truly a sound to
be heard ... and an experience
to be remembered."
More information concerning
these events may be obtained at
the Office of Public Events.

An office on campus that is
little known and yet affects all
of our entertainment
opportunities is the Office Of
Public Events, hidden next to
the Commons, behind Encina
Hall.
From this office comes the
coordination of campus events
that are not normally found in
the community, and that we

without going all the way to San
Francisco.
The people at Public Events

work, to use an overworked
cliche, to "enrich our lives
culturally."
Bacchetti explains their
function in more detail. "We
work in five particular areas, all
of which have to do with the
general type of public events.
"First is administration of
University policy as it pertains to
events that are open to the
public. In that context we have
responsibility for scheduling of
space for events anybody wants
to put on, with the exception of
events that are put on by the
athletic department and events
that are resident-based — if they
take place in the dormitory."
Their work encompasses
lectures film series, concerts, and
organizational meetings by such
varied university-related groups
as administrative offices,
departments, schools or
registered student organizations.
They also work with student
organizations, helping them put
on events. Bacchetti says, "We
work with them and try and
provide them with some advice
and counsel as to how to get
things on, where they can get
necessary publicity, assistance,
how they get their technical
support together, and all that
kind of stuff."

trio Sour Cream will be in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Tuesday
Oct. 14 at 8 p.m.
LA Four, a jazz group, is

at conservatories in Holland. . .
They look like a rock group and
play like angels."

feature Laurendo Almeida on the
guitar, Ray Brown on the bass,
Shelly Manne on the drums and
Bud Shank on the sax. They
have been described as
"incredible ... unbelievable ...

THE DANCING LAWYER—Les Williams, talented dancer with
many years experience behind him, is teaching a course this quarter
on black dances that came out of the 30's and 40's, and were
popular among whites, too.


COMING OCT. 24-The LAFour,better known (left to right) as Laurendo Almeida, Shelly Manne, Ray
Brown, and Bud Shank will be performing in Memorial Auditorium. The show is sponsored by the
Office Of Public Events.
An office on campus that is
little known and yet affects all
of our entertainment
opportunities is the Office Of
Public Events, hidden next to
the Commons, behind Encina
Hall.
From this office comes the
coordination of campus events
that are not normally found in
the community, and that we
might not have the chance to see
without going all the way to San
Francisco.
The people at Public Events
— Director Tom Bacchetti,
Assoc. Director Lynn Bonde,
and Audience Development
Coordinator Shirley Kelley —
work, to use an overworked
cliche, to "enrich our lives
culturally."
Bacchetti explains their
function in more detail. "We
work in five particular areas, all
of which have to do with the
general type of public events.
"First is administration of
University policy as it pertains to
events that are open to the
public. In that context we have
responsibility for scheduling of
space for events anybody wants
to put on, with the exception of
events that are put on by the
athletic department and events
that are resident-based — if they
take place in the dormitory."
Their work encompasses
lectures film series, concerts, and
organizational meetings by such
varied university-related groups
as administrative offices,
departments, schools or
registered student organizations.
They also work with student
organizations, helping them put
on events. Bacchetti says, "We
work with them and try and
provide them with some advice
and counsel as to how to get
things on, where they can get
necessary publicity, assistance,
how they get their technical
support together, and all that
kind of stuff."
The Office of Public Events is
also responsible for the
management of public
ceremonies, i.e. Founder's Day,
the Baccalaureate and
Commencement.
Commencement alone takes
about six months of their time.
The last six weeks of the
quarter alone are devoted
exclusively to coordinating
activities for that day. According
to Assoc. Director Bonde,
"It's like planning somebody
else's wedding — or a war,
depending on which day you ask
us."
The lecture committee wants
to "bring very fine scholars" to
the campus, hopefully to deliver
speeches pertaining to the
research they have done. The
recent Walter Cronkite lecture
was part of that series.
Organizations wishing to
bring lecturers to the campus,
says Bonde, can apply to Public
Events for financial assistance.
Last year they donated funds to
Women's Day International Fair;
a visit by Ousmane Sembene, an
African filmmaker; and Wally
Soyenka. "The money is not
great," says Bonde "but
sometimes it makes the
difference between having a
speaker and not."

In the performing arts aspect
of the Public Events Office, are
the upcoming concerts for Sour
Cream and the LA Four. The
office has been bringing to
Stanford "touring professional
artists and attractions that
people wouldn't normally have a
chance to see otherwise" for
seven years, says Bacchetti.
"It's fairly eclectic in terms
of kinds of things that we do
from recorder music, which is
the first thing coming up, to
jazz, to modern dance. We don't
get into pop-rock programming
because that's more or less the
domain of ASSU Special
Events.
"We're also working to
develop different kinds of
non-performance things to go
along with it — residency
activities, essentially —
mini-concerts in the dormitories
by visiting artists so that
students can meet them
informally outside of the
performance environment."
Bacchetti introduced the
