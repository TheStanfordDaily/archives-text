# Dance, sing in Harmony
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN First of Two Parts 
Somewhere between Lake
Lagunita and Santa Theresa St.
sits Harmony House, the
headquarters for the Committee
on Black Performing Arts, an
organization dedicated to
bringing black culture and its
rich history to the Stanford
community.
Two of the Committee's
instructors, Les Williams and Jim
Shields, are excellently qualified
for their positions, having been
in the world of music and dance
since ... well, since they were
old enough to dance and play
music.
Les Williams, teacher of a
course on the history of black

dance, has a dual connection
with the University. Besides his
position at Harmony House, he
enrolled in the Stanford Law
School in 1970, fulfilling a
lifelong dream of being a lawyer.
At age 56, having just taken
the bar exams, and beginning his
second year here, he proves that
it's never too late to do
anything.
His idols were such great
dancers as Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson, whom he describes as
"generous" and "cheerful,"
Gene Kelly, and Fred Astaire. As
a youth, he teamed with a friend
and formed "Moe and Les."
Having graduated from high
school at age 15, and feeling too
small in stature to be

comfortable at a college ("All
college men were seven feet
tall"), he and Moe worked for a
dance studio doing janitorial
work in exchange for lessons.
There he was in constant
contact with professionals who
rented the studios to rehearse
when they were in town. With a
chuckle, Williams explains that
he and his partner always found
an excuse to clean the mirrors in
the particular studio that was
being used. The pros, of course,
would offer to teach them a few
steps.
In 1939, though, Moe was
invited to try his luck in
Hollywood, and Les stayed
behind. He opened a dance
studio in San Mateoto finance his

education, which he maintained
until 1970.
He plans to put on a show
here in May. "The type of
dancing that I'm really going to
focus on is what was called "jive
dancing," which was a
forerunner to jazz." It comes
from the 20's and 30's, the
period Williams plans on
emphasizing.

continued on Tuesday; also, Jim
Shields, musician)

enrolled in the Stanford Law
School in 1970, fulfilling a
lifelong dream of being a lawyer.
At age 56, having just taken
the bar exams, and beginning his
second year here, he proves that
it's never too late to do
anything.
His idols were such great
dancers as Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson, whom he describes as
"generous" and "cheerful,"
Gene Kelly, and Fred Astaire. As
a youth, he teamed with a friend
and formed "Moe and Les."
Having graduated from high
school at age 15, and feeling too
small in stature to be

comfortable at a college ("All
college men were seven feet
tall"), he and Moe worked for a
dance studio doing janitorial
work in exchange for lessons.
There he was in constant
contact with professionals who
rented the studios to rehearse
when they were in town. With a
chuckle, Williams explains that
he and his partner always found
an excuse to clean the mirrors in
the particular studio that was
being used. The pros, of course,
would offer to teach them a few
steps.
In 1939, though, Moe was
invited to try his luck in
Hollywood, and Les stayed
behind. He opened a dance
studio in San Mateoto finance his

education, which he maintained
until 1970.
He plans to put on a show
here in May. "The type of
dancing that I'm really going to
focus on is what was called "jive
dancing," which was a
forerunner to jazz." It comes
from the 20's and 30's, the
period Williams plans on
emphasizing.

Somewhere between Lake
Lagunita and Santa Theresa St.
sits Harmony House, the
headquarters for the Committee
on Black Performing Arts, an
organization dedicated to
bringing black culture and its
rich history to the Stanford
community.
Two of the Committee's
instructors, Les Williams and Jim
Shields, are excellently qualified
for their positions, having been
in the world of music and dance
since ... well, since they were
old enough to dance and play
music.
Les Williams, teacher of a
course on the history of black

dance, has a dual connection
with the University. Besides his
position at Harmony House, he
enrolled in the Stanford Law
School in 1970, fulfilling a
lifelong dream of being a lawyer.
