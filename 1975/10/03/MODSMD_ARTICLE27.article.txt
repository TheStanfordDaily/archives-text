## Cardinal backfield seeks holes to bolster meager running game 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Although it may seem hard to
believe, if you watched last
Saturday's football game in the
Stadium, the Stanford running
attack has actually improved
over last year.
After three games the Cards
have gained 231 yards,
compared with 230 at the same
time last season. But one thing
hasn't changed. Stanford is still
in last place in conference
rushing statistics.
And this was supposed to be
the year when the ground game
returned to the Farm. After
watching John McKay's USC
Trojans run over around and
through more holes than the
Cards knew existed, Coach Jack
Christiansen installed an
I-formation in the play book.
Christiansen figured that an I
was the best way to spring
halfback Ron Inge for more
yardage. But he forgot one thing
— it should have been kept a
secret. All of Stanford's
opponents have been waiting for
Inge, whom McKay said "could
be a great back if running from
an I-formation," much as the

posse waited to catch train
robbers.
Inge hasn't been able to turn
the corner — a must if an
I-tailback is to break off some
long gainers. "The only other
choice is to run Inge inside,"
said assistant coach Dave
Currey,"and he's an outside
runner." The Cards have gone
inside — but they've given the
ball to fullbacks Don Stevenson
(tomorrow's starter) and John
Finley.
Finley has replaced Inge as
Stanford's leading rusher, with
19 attempts for 82 yards and a
4.3 average, and he's quick to
point out that the team's rushing
attack isn't that bad. "We gained
125 yards against San Jose State,
not counting losses. We had a
good average. When we start
running the ball more, it'll go
up."
That may be at the heart of
Stanford's meager rushing total.
USC's Ricky Bell, who gained
more yards in the Trojan's home
opener than Stanford has
accumulated all season, also gets
the ball more than 30 times a
game.

Stanford, a school which has
survived through the air, might
have some sort of aversion to the
ground game. Currey sums it up.
"Last year USC wouldn't have
beaten us without the pass. And
they wouldn't have beaten Notre
Dame and Ohio State without
putting the ball in the air."
Inge knows that Stanford's
offensive philosophy is still to
throw the ball. "It's never been
equal," said Inge. "It's just a
matter of recognizing the
defenses. The timing hasn't
[between the backfield and the
line] quite been there.
Christiansen agrees that his
Cards haven't worked on the
running game as much as they
should. "Maybe we should stress
it, but it would take the
quarterbacks away from the
passing game.
"It takes 100 percent
coordination to run a play. It
seems when we get people
blocking, the backs slip." And
don't forget that pass protection
and blocking for running plays
require totally different
techniques. Chris also said that
the Cards may have been trying
to emulate other teams too
much. "Early in the year we
spent a lot of time running plays
we see other teams running. This
week we have concentrated on
running fewer plays."
Last week quarterback Guy
Benjamin suggested that perhaps
Stanford should play
two-minute football games. Well,
this year the Cards have always

been behind when the
two-minute warning has come
up and that means the ball goes
in the air.
"Sometimes because of the
way we get off in a game, we
have to throw a lot," said
Currey. "We've been playing
catch-up football."
And take a look at the
situations the Cards choose to
run the ball in. "If it's third and
one and we only gain a yard,
you have to look at what the
play is designed to get. In that
case it was designed to get a
yard," said Currey.
By now you've heard all the
reasons for the Cards inept
rushing game and you're still
wondering what will happen
tomorrow against Army.
"As long as I can remember,"
said Christiansen, "we've been
notoriously slow in getting our
rushing game going. Last year we
got off to a slow start in our first
couple of games and then came
on strong."
Maybe tomorrow Stanford's
hearts and minds will be with
their running backs.

Finley.
Finley has replaced Inge as
Stanford's leading rusher, with
19 attempts for 82 yards and a
4.3 average, and he's quick to
point out that the team's rushing
attack isn't that bad. "We gained
125 yards against San Jose State,
not counting losses. We had a
good average. When we start
running the ball more, it'll go
up."
That may be at the heart of
Stanford's meager rushing total.
USC's Ricky Bell, who gained
more yards in the Trojan's home
opener than Stanford has
accumulated all season, also gets
the ball more than 30 times a
game.

Stanford, a school which has
survived through the air, might
have some sort of aversion to the
ground game. Currey sums it up.
"Last year USC wouldn't have
beaten us without the pass. And
they wouldn't have beaten Notre
Dame and Ohio State without
putting the ball in the air."
Inge knows that Stanford's
offensive philosophy is still to
throw the ball. "It's never been
equal," said Inge. "It's just a
matter of recognizing the
defenses. The timing hasn't
[between the backfield and the
line] quite been there.
Christiansen agrees that his
Cards haven't worked on the
running game as much as they
should. "Maybe we should stress
it, but it would take the
quarterbacks away from the
passing game.
"It takes 100 percent
coordination to run a play. It
seems when we get people
blocking, the backs slip." And
don't forget that pass protection
and blocking for running plays
require totally different
techniques. Chris also said that
the Cards may have been trying
to emulate other teams too
much. "Early in the year we
spent a lot of time running plays
we see other teams running. This
week we have concentrated on
running fewer plays."
Last week quarterback Guy
Benjamin suggested that perhaps
Stanford should play
two-minute football games. Well,
this year the Cards have always

been behind when the
two-minute warning has come
up and that means the ball goes
in the air.
"Sometimes because of the
way we get off in a game, we
have to throw a lot," said
Currey. "We've been playing
catch-up football."
And take a look at the
situations the Cards choose to
run the ball in. "If it's third and
one and we only gain a yard,
you have to look at what the
play is designed to get. In that
case it was designed to get a
yard," said Currey.
By now you've heard all the
reasons for the Cards inept
rushing game and you're still
wondering what will happen
tomorrow against Army.
"As long as I can remember,"
said Christiansen, "we've been
notoriously slow in getting our
rushing game going. Last year we
got off to a slow start in our first
couple of games and then came
on strong."
Maybe tomorrow Stanford's
hearts and minds will be with
their running backs.

NUMBER NlNE—Halfback Ron Inge had more success getting outside last season. The junior from
Stockton was expected to lead the Card ground attack this year, but he's been struggling to gain
yardage despite some new plays.
Although it may seem hard to
believe, if you watched last
Saturday's football game in the
Stadium, the Stanford running
attack has actually improved
over last year.
After three games the Cards
have gained 231 yards,
compared with 230 at the same
time last season. But one thing
hasn't changed. Stanford is still
in last place in conference
rushing statistics.
And this was supposed to be
the year when the ground game
returned to the Farm. After
watching John McKay's USC
Trojans run over around and
through more holes than the
Cards knew existed, Coach Jack
Christiansen installed an
I-formation in the play book.
Christiansen figured that an I
was the best way to spring
halfback Ron Inge for more
yardage. But he forgot one thing
— it should have been kept a
secret. All of Stanford's
opponents have been waiting for
Inge, whom McKay said "could
be a great back if running from
an I-formation," much as the

posse waited to catch train
robbers.
Inge hasn't been able to turn
the corner — a must if an
I-tailback is to break off some
long gainers. "The only other
choice is to run Inge inside,"
said assistant coach Dave
Currey,"and he's an outside
runner." The Cards have gone
inside — but they've given the
ball to fullbacks Don Stevenson
(tomorrow's starter) and John
Finley.

quarterbacks away from the
passing game.
"It takes 100 percent
coordination to run a play. It
seems when we get people
blocking, the backs slip." And
don't forget that pass protection
and blocking for running plays
require totally different
techniques. Chris also said that
the Cards may have been trying
to emulate other teams too
much. "Early in the year we
spent a lot of time running plays
we see other teams running. This
week we have concentrated on
running fewer plays."
Last week quarterback Guy
Benjamin suggested that perhaps
Stanford should play
two-minute football games. Well,
this year the Cards have always

been behind when the
two-minute warning has come
up and that means the ball goes
in the air.
"Sometimes because of the
way we get off in a game, we
have to throw a lot," said
Currey. "We've been playing
catch-up football."
And take a look at the
situations the Cards choose to
run the ball in. "If it's third and
one and we only gain a yard,
you have to look at what the
play is designed to get. In that
case it was designed to get a
yard," said Currey.
By now you've heard all the
reasons for the Cards inept
rushing game and you're still
wondering what will happen
tomorrow against Army.
"As long as I can remember,"
said Christiansen, "we've been
notoriously slow in getting our
rushing game going. Last year we
got off to a slow start in our first
couple of games and then came
on strong."
Maybe tomorrow Stanford's
hearts and minds will be with
their running backs.

NUMBER NlNE—Halfback Ron Inge had more success getting outside last season. The junior from
Stockton was expected to lead the Card ground attack this year, but he's been struggling to gain
yardage despite some new plays.
Although it may seem hard to
believe, if you watched last
Saturday's football game in the
Stadium, the Stanford running
attack has actually improved
over last year.
After three games the Cards
have gained 231 yards,
compared with 230 at the same
time last season. But one thing
hasn't changed. Stanford is still
in last place in conference
rushing statistics.
And this was supposed to be
the year when the ground game
returned to the Farm. After
watching John McKay's USC
Trojans run over around and
through more holes than the
Cards knew existed, Coach Jack
Christiansen installed an
I-formation in the play book.
Christiansen figured that an I
was the best way to spring
halfback Ron Inge for more
yardage. But he forgot one thing
— it should have been kept a
secret. All of Stanford's
opponents have been waiting for
Inge, whom McKay said "could
be a great back if running from
an I-formation," much as the

posse waited to catch train
robbers.
Inge hasn't been able to turn
the corner — a must if an
I-tailback is to break off some
long gainers. "The only other
choice is to run Inge inside,"
said assistant coach Dave
Currey,"and he's an outside
runner." The Cards have gone
inside — but they've given the
ball to fullbacks Don Stevenson
(tomorrow's starter) and John
Finley.
Finley has replaced Inge as
Stanford's leading rusher, with
19 attempts for 82 yards and a
4.3 average, and he's quick to
point out that the team's rushing
attack isn't that bad. "We gained
125 yards against San Jose State,
not counting losses. We had a
good average. When we start
running the ball more, it'll go
up."
That may be at the heart of
Stanford's meager rushing total.
USC's Ricky Bell, who gained
more yards in the Trojan's home
opener than Stanford has
accumulated all season, also gets
the ball more than 30 times a
game.

Stanford, a school which has
survived through the air, might
have some sort of aversion to the
ground game. Currey sums it up.
"Last year USC wouldn't have
beaten us without the pass. And
they wouldn't have beaten Notre
Dame and Ohio State without
putting the ball in the air."
Inge knows that Stanford's
offensive philosophy is still to
throw the ball. "It's never been
equal," said Inge. "It's just a
matter of recognizing the
defenses. The timing hasn't
[between the backfield and the
line] quite been there.
Christiansen agrees that his
Cards haven't worked on the
running game as much as they
should. "Maybe we should stress
it, but it would take the
quarterbacks away from the
passing game.
"It takes 100 percent
coordination to run a play. It
seems when we get people
blocking, the backs slip." And
