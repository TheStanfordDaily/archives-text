# Pac-8 predictions
## 
### 
*
! Stanford students will get to
see something this weekend that
| hasn 't been on the Farm since the
| halcyon days of ROTC: a group
! of scholars in full military
[ uniform.
There'll be 500 cadets on
hand to cheer on Army at
Stanford Stadium this Saturday,
but they probably won't have
many opportunities to wave their
hats around. The officers-to-be
are about as weak a team as ever
scored 98 points in its first two
games, and the Cards shouldn't
miss this last chance to pick up a
win before a tough Pac-8 opener
next week.
San Jose State's Coach Darryl
Rodgers brings his squad to
Berkeley in an attempt to finish a
sweep of the Bay Area's Pac-8
teams that might propel the

Spartans into the national
rankings. By the time the Bears
get done, San Jose's win last week
will look a little more like luck.
New Bear quarterback Joe Roth
should be ab.e to pick the Spartan
pass defense apart.
In other contests, USC travels
to corn-and-hog country to
trample and slaughter Big Ten
weakling lowa. UCLA won't be so
lucky: after last week's fiasco
against Air Force, the Bruins will
have to come storming back to
stay even remotely close to Ohio
State.
