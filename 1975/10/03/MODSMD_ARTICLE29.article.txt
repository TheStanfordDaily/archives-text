# Poloers romp in NorCal warmup
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team improved its pre-season
record to 5-1 yesterday with a
12-1 victory over Pepperdine.
That was not the main thing
on head coach Art Lambert's

mind after the game, however, as
he concerned himself with the
Northern California Aquatic
Federation water polo
tournament that his Cards enter
this weekend.
"The NorCal tournament is
quite important. It will give me
an indication of how we stand
for the upcoming season," said
Lambert, whose Cards host a
tough UCLA squad in their
regular season debut on October
10.
The NorCal tourney,
according to Lambert, is the
largest in the world, boasting 32
entries that are divided up into
three divisions: open, small
college and junior college. Last
year, Stanford finished fourth in
the open division behind first
place California, but Lambert
believes the Cards' chances are
considerably improved to meet
Cal for the division
championship this year.

"We are naturally a more
experienced team. We have
acquired a great deal of fine
freshmen talent in Doug Burke,
Dave Egan, Robbie Arnold and

Sam Forencich. We are also
quite fortunate that we did not
lose any of our real strength
through graduation last year,"
he said.
According to Lambert,
however, there are still some
fundamental points that the
team will have to keep in mind
when facing their opponents this
weekend.
"We have to work on getting
better shots. For the moment,
though, I am most concerned
that we readjust and get down to
the rules like we did this
summer," he emphasized.
Tough opposition
Stanford will find that the
three wins they need to reach
the championship will not come
easily as their first obstacle is the
Air Force Academy. Air Force
claimed the championship last
year in the small college division.

The Cards will then meet
UC-Davis today at 1 p.m. and
Long Beach City College
tomorrow at 9 a.m.
"We have not had a chance to
see the teams that we are
playing. All I am going on is
hearsay, and I've heard that all
the teams we are meeting have
posted respectable season
records," he said.
In yesterday's NorCal tune-up
against Pepperdine, the varsity
tabulated four goals apiece in
the last three periods for the
final 12-1 rout. Freshmen Burke
and Arnold led the
evenly-balanced scoring attack
with three and two goals,
respectively, while goaltenders
Chris Dorst and Frank Forencich
held Pepperdine to only one
futile goal early in the first
quarter.

final 12-1 rout. Freshmen Burke
and Arnold led the
evenly-balanced scoring attack
with three and two goals,
respectively, while goaltenders
Chris Dorst and Frank Forencich
held Pepperdine to only one
futile goal early in the first
quarter.
Stanford's varsity water polo
team improved its pre-season
record to 5-1 yesterday with a
12-1 victory over Pepperdine.
That was not the main thing
on head coach Art Lambert's

mind after the game, however, as
he concerned himself with the
Northern California Aquatic
Federation water polo
tournament that his Cards enter
this weekend.
"The NorCal tournament is
quite important. It will give me
an indication of how we stand
for the upcoming season," said
Lambert, whose Cards host a
tough UCLA squad in their
regular season debut on October
10.
The NorCal tourney,
according to Lambert, is the
largest in the world, boasting 32
entries that are divided up into
three divisions: open, small
college and junior college. Last
year, Stanford finished fourth in
the open division behind first
place California, but Lambert
believes the Cards' chances are
considerably improved to meet
Cal for the division
championship this year.

"We are naturally a more
experienced team. We have
acquired a great deal of fine
freshmen talent in Doug Burke,
Dave Egan, Robbie Arnold and

Sam Forencich. We are also
quite fortunate that we did not
lose any of our real strength
through graduation last year,"
he said.
According to Lambert,
however, there are still some
fundamental points that the
team will have to keep in mind
when facing their opponents this
weekend.
"We have to work on getting
better shots. For the moment,
though, I am most concerned
that we readjust and get down to
the rules like we did this
summer," he emphasized.
Tough opposition
Stanford will find that the
three wins they need to reach
the championship will not come
easily as their first obstacle is the
Air Force Academy. Air Force
claimed the championship last
year in the small college division.

The Cards will then meet
UC-Davis today at 1 p.m. and
Long Beach City College
tomorrow at 9 a.m.
"We have not had a chance to
see the teams that we are
playing. All I am going on is
hearsay, and I've heard that all
the teams we are meeting have
posted respectable season
records," he said.
In yesterday's NorCal tune-up
against Pepperdine, the varsity
tabulated four goals apiece in
the last three periods for the
final 12-1 rout. Freshmen Burke
