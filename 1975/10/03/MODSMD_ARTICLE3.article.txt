# Locked stack policy reviewed
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Upon review, the current squabble
about the locked stack policy of the
Main Library turns into a fervently
argued production of Much Ado
About Nothing, aggravated by
bureaucratic inertia and a hidebound
library regulation.
In a Sept. 4 letter to David
Weber, director of university libraries,
Richard Thomas of the Gay People's
Union objected to the "inexcusable

barrier to information" erected by the
library. (The letter was printed in
Monday's Daily.)
Thomas' letter has prompted a
full-scale review of the locked stack
guidelines, with recommended changes
expected within two months,
according to Dale Canelas, assistant
director for public services at Main
Library. The library discriminates
against homosexuals by limiting access

to books on gay power and gay civil
rights, Thomas complained.
He claimed that many potentially
gay people fear openly checking out
these books, but would surreptitiously
read them within the library to learn
more about their attraction to
members of their own sex.
Basement books
In fact, the Main Library maintains
a basement section of locked stacks

for a variety of publications:
illustrated books susceptible to theft
or mutilation; valuable books or
collections; fragile, velum-bound
books; and books unusually liable to
theft, including volumes on drugs,
heterosexuality, erotica, and
homosexuality. The policy is not
limited to books about homosexuality.
Library officials have
indiscriminately placed titles with
certain Library of Congress
classification numbers in the locked
stacks, however, including the
classification number HQ 76, which
includes most books on
homosexuality.
Most books about heterosexuality
are also housed in the locked stacks, as
are virtually all erotic books.
The locked stack policy does not
alter circulation policy at all, library
officials emphasize. The books in
locked stacks may be checked out like
any others, but must be fetched by a
library employe.
To avoid 'theft'
The purpose of the locked stacks is
"not to keep books away from people
who need them, but to avoid
circulation by theft," observed Gloria
Stockton, head of the circulation
department.
Library officials could cite no
statistics to support their fear of theft,
but a review of circulation records
provides ample evidence. In Meyer
Library, which has open stacks, more
than one-third of the HQ 76 section
was reported missing in a 1974
inventory. Even in the locked Main
Library basement section, many of the
80 books on homosexuality are
missing.
Bureaucratic overkill has added an
element of burlesque to the locked
stacks policy. Library Administration
Regulation No. 11, promulgated in
1968, provides for a "sensitive area

Library. The locked stack policy is being reviewed.
cage" within the locked stacks.
Part-time library employes may not
enter this area.
The special cage houses "Erotica,
any literary items having a strongly
erotic theme or treating of sexual love
in a particularly sensuous manner, i.e.,
English translations of Marquis de
Sade." It also includes books on "sex
hygiene and sex psychology."
Contrary to rumor, the library does
not have a titillating collection of
pornographic books or pictures. The
lascivious section contains
controversial titles like Portnoy's
Complaint, Naked Came the Stranger
and Human Sexual Response by
Masters and Johnson.
By contrast, the open stacks
contain prurient books like The
Salvaging of American Girlhood and
What a Young Woman Ought to
Know.
