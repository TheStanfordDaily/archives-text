# Delaney, Whitlinger and Forood
## Net stars cashing in on tennis 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Although ex-Stanford tennis
stars Jim Delaney and John
Whitlinger are currently in
Hawaii and will leave in a few
days for Melbourne, Australia,
they're on anything but a
vacation.
It's all part of their new job —
touring professional tennis
player.
Since participating in
Stanford's fourth-place finish in
the NCAA Championships at
Corpus Christi, Texas, last June,
Delaney and Whitlinger have
followed the pro tennis tour to
such places as Chicago,
Cincinnati, Birmingham,
Bermuda and, most recently,
San Francisco for the Fireman's
Fund International.
Due to the seeding system,
which rewards the top pros by
pitting them against the less
proven ones in opening rounds
of tournaments, it is

exceptionally difficult for a
young player to distinguish
himself among his established
colleagues. Nevertheless,
Whitlinger and Delaney have
made significant indentations in
the hierarchy over the summer.
Delaney, in fact, has the best
record over the past four months
of any tour rookie (including
NCAA singles champ Billy
Martin), and has been called the
best new pro on the circuit.
In addition to winning the
Birmingham tournament,
Delaney scored wins this
summer over Onny Parun of
New Zealand, Karl Meiler and
Jurgen Fassbender of Germany,
Bob Carmichael of France and
Ray Moore of South Africa, all
mainstays of the pro tour.
Delaney's wins are even more
impressive when you consider
that he must survive qualifying
matches to reach even the first

round of tournaments.
Whitlinger has no such
problem. Largely on the basis of
his play on the pro circuit in the
summer of 1974, "Whit" has
accumulated enough Association
of Tennis Professionals (ATP)
points to bypass the qualifying
rounds and begin play as a
"starter," which also guarantees
him first-round earnings.
Whit, who skipped his final
year of eligibility at Stanford to
turn pro, has not matched
Delaney's success, but did reach
the semifinals of the Bermuda
tournament before losing
unforgiveably to some guy
named Jimmy Connors.
Whitlinger achieved probably
his greatest victory ever by
defeating Russian Alex
Metreveli, a 1973 Wimbledon
finalist, at Bermuda.
Outside of Bermuda,
Whitlinger's most notable
accomplishment this summer

was advancing to the doubles
final in Chicago with partner
Mark Cahill.
Stanford may have lost
Delaney and Whitlinger, but it
still has Lele Forood, the Cards'
number one female tennis
player, and the 1975 National
Amateur Grass Court Singles
champion player. Forood has
been named by the U.S. Tennis
Association to the three-woman,
three-man amateur team which

will represent the United States
in the Pan American Games,
involving nations from Central,
North and South America, Oct.
17-21 in Mexico City.
Selected along with Forood
to go to Mexico City were
Stephanie Tolleson and Sandy
Stapp from Trinity University in
Texas, Butch Walts and Bruce
Manson from USC and Hank
Pfister from San Jose State.

finalist, at Bermuda.
Outside of Bermuda,
Whitlinger's most notable
accomplishment this summer

was advancing to the doubles
final in Chicago with partner
Mark Cahill.
Stanford may have lost
Delaney and Whitlinger, but it
still has Lele Forood, the Cards'
number one female tennis
player, and the 1975 National
Amateur Grass Court Singles
champion player. Forood has
been named by the U.S. Tennis
Association to the three-woman,
three-man amateur team which

will represent the United States
in the Pan American Games,
involving nations from Central,
North and South America, Oct.
17-21 in Mexico City.
Selected along with Forood
to go to Mexico City were
Stephanie Tolleson and Sandy
Stapp from Trinity University in
Texas, Butch Walts and Bruce
Manson from USC and Hank
Pfister from San Jose State.

John Whitlinger rushes to net.
Although ex-Stanford tennis
stars Jim Delaney and John
Whitlinger are currently in
Hawaii and will leave in a few
days for Melbourne, Australia,
they're on anything but a
vacation.
It's all part of their new job —
touring professional tennis
player.
Since participating in
Stanford's fourth-place finish in
the NCAA Championships at
Corpus Christi, Texas, last June,
Delaney and Whitlinger have
followed the pro tennis tour to
such places as Chicago,
Cincinnati, Birmingham,
Bermuda and, most recently,
San Francisco for the Fireman's
Fund International.
Due to the seeding system,
which rewards the top pros by
pitting them against the less
proven ones in opening rounds
of tournaments, it is

exceptionally difficult for a
young player to distinguish
himself among his established
colleagues. Nevertheless,
Whitlinger and Delaney have
made significant indentations in
the hierarchy over the summer.
Delaney, in fact, has the best
record over the past four months
of any tour rookie (including
NCAA singles champ Billy
Martin), and has been called the
best new pro on the circuit.
In addition to winning the
Birmingham tournament,
Delaney scored wins this
summer over Onny Parun of
New Zealand, Karl Meiler and
Jurgen Fassbender of Germany,
Bob Carmichael of France and
Ray Moore of South Africa, all
mainstays of the pro tour.
Delaney's wins are even more
impressive when you consider
that he must survive qualifying
matches to reach even the first

round of tournaments.
Whitlinger has no such
problem. Largely on the basis of
his play on the pro circuit in the
summer of 1974, "Whit" has
accumulated enough Association
of Tennis Professionals (ATP)
points to bypass the qualifying
rounds and begin play as a
"starter," which also guarantees
him first-round earnings.
Whit, who skipped his final
year of eligibility at Stanford to
turn pro, has not matched
Delaney's success, but did reach
the semifinals of the Bermuda
tournament before losing
unforgiveably to some guy
named Jimmy Connors.
Whitlinger achieved probably
his greatest victory ever by
defeating Russian Alex
Metreveli, a 1973 Wimbledon
finalist, at Bermuda.
Outside of Bermuda,
Whitlinger's most notable
accomplishment this summer

was advancing to the doubles
final in Chicago with partner
