# Harriers off to Fresno

### 
Stanford's cross-country team
will be putting its unblemished
1-0 record on the line this
Saturday at the Fresno State
Invitational cross-country run.
After last weekend's easy
victory in a quadrangular meet,

the Cards look ready for the
likes of Fresno State and
Nevada-Reno.
Tony Sandoval, who set a
home course record in the
quadrangular meet, will head the
squad. Also running for Stanford

will be: Jack Bellah, Chris Berka,
Richard Karlgaard, Frank
Boutin, Jeff Parietti, Stacy
Geiken, Roy Kissin and Jerry
Emory.
Head Coach Marshall Clark
feels that the Cards should do
well all season long because the
team has "good depth" and is
"extremely strong at the top.
Our first three runners — Bellah,
Sandoval and Kissin — could
make any team in the country."
Frosh sensation Kissin placed
third in last weekend's meet
while setting a Stanford
freshman record. He finished the
4.2 mile run in 20:31.6 despite
falling early in the race.
Although this is Kissin's first
collegiate season, he is no
newcomer to high pressure
running. Last year, Kissin
finished eighth in the
International Junior Cross
Country Championships. His
best time in the six-mile run,
29:21.1, would place him sixth
on Stanford's all-time list.
Bellah, a senior, set the
Stanford record in the six-mile
last season, with a 28:53 mark
set in the Pac-8 meet last season.
Sandoval holds the second-best
time at that distance, with a
28:56.6 also clocked last season.
