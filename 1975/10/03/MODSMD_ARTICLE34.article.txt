House votes to lift embargo
WASHINGTON — The House reversed its
opposition and voted last night to partly lift
Congress' embargo against U.S. arms sales to
Turkey. The Turks had threatened to close U.S.
bases unless the embargo was lifted.
After initiating Congress' cut-off of all U.S.
military aid to Turkey as of last Feb. 5 and voting
against such aid nine times, the House approved a
bill releasing $185 million in arms shipment.
President Ford made a last minute appeal for
the House approval, saying it was critical to
restoring security interests not only of the United
States but of the North Atlantic alliance.
Backers of the aid said they feared U.S.
surveillance stations in Turkey watching the Soviets
would be lost without the bill and said Congress'
embargo had failed to force Turkey to negotiate a
Cyprus peace.
Ford: Sinai Pact above board
WASHINGTON — President Ford assured the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday
that it has been told about all the secret
understandings reached with Israel and Egypt as
part of the Sinai settlement.
Ford's formal statement, presented in a closed
hearing by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
appeared to remove a roadblock from congressional
approval for the stationing of 200 American
technicians in the desert passes.
However, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) told
reporters the issue of whether the American people
are to be given the information still remains.
Hirohito "deplores" world war
WASHINGTON — Japan's Emperor Hirohito, in
whose name 1.5 million Japanese servicemen died
during World War 11, said last night he deeply
deplores "that most unfortuante war," and he
thanked the United States for its reconstruction
assistance.
The emperor said he has long wished to convey
personally his "gratitude to the people of the
United States for the friendly hand of good will
and assistance their great country accorded us for
our post-war reconstruction, immediately following
that most unfortunate war which I deeply
deplore."
In a toast prepared for a White House dinner in
his honor, Hirohito expressed confidence that "the
story of the generosity and good will of the
American people will be retold from generation to
generation of Japanese for the rest of time."

Spanish police jeer premier
MADRID, Spain — Enraged police officers
attending the funeral of three colleagues slain by
terrorists jeered liberal-leaning Premier Carlos Arias
Navarro yesterday and told him to quit if he had
"any honor left."
Shouts of "we want justice, not clemency" and
"justice yes, pardon no" continually disrupted
services for the three dead policemen, who were
gunned down Wednesday morning.
More than 4,000 police officers jammed the
central court of the military academy to hear a
Roman Catholic friar demand tough anti-terrorism
action.
"These things must not happen again," Friar
Jose Lopez Ortiz said in his funeral oration.
"Judicial sanctions to curb these crimes must be
used. It is hard and punishing work, but it must be
done."
After the mass, scores of armed police and civil
guards struggled with official pall bearers,
demanding to carry the three coffins on their own
shoulders to a military cemetery 12 miles away.
Wholesale prices rise again
WASHINGTON — Prices of foods, fuels and
metals increased sharply at the wholesale level in
September, the government reported yesterday,
signaling a probable new round of price increases
for consumers.
The Labor Department said over-all wholesale
prices in September increased six-tenths of one
percent, down from a gain of eight-tenths of one
percent in August.
Wholesale piices were 6.3 percent higher in
September than a year earlier, but the annual rate
of increase for the last three months was 11.1
percent.
Chairman Arthur F. Burns of the Federal
Reserve Board told the House Budget Committee
yesterday there is concern at the Fed that "a fresh
dose of double-digit inflation" may appear.
Senate keeps gas control bill
WASHINGTON — Republicans won a
temporary victory yesterday as the Senate voted to
keep alive a proposal to remove all federal controls
from natural gas prices within five years.
The 50-45 /ote against a motion that would
have killed the amendment indicated at least half
of the Senate wants to remove price controls at the
same time that it passes legislation to avert a gas
shortage this winter.
House leaders have warned that coupling the

emergency and long-range proposals could block
efforts to prevent the predicted shortage in 14
states this winter.
W.T. Grant files bankruptcy
NEW YORK — W. T. Grant Co., the nationwide
retail chain which was hit with losses of $111.5
million in the first six months of this year,
yesterday filed for reorganization under the
nation's bankruptcy laws, becoming the largest
retailing failure in U.S. history.
The New York-based chain, which started in
1906, filed papers in federal court here seeking
rearrangement under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws, which would allow it to continue
to operate while trying to reach a suitable
agreement with creditors.
Chapter 11 filing is largely the result of too
rapid expansion in the 1960s by the former "Main
Street" retailer — both into new areas and shopping
centers and into new merchandising lines, such as
household appliances.

nation's bankruptcy laws, becoming the largest
retailing failure in U.S. history.
The New York-based chain, which started in
1906, filed papers in federal court here seeking
rearrangement under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws, which would allow it to continue
to operate while trying to reach a suitable
agreement with creditors.
Chapter 11 filing is largely the result of too
rapid expansion in the 1960s by the former "Main
Street" retailer — both into new areas and shopping
centers and into new merchandising lines, such as
household appliances.
Today's weather
Chance of showers today and tonight then
clearing Saturday. Little temperature change. Lows
tonight in the low mid 50s. Highs both days in the
60s and low 70s. West to southwest winds 10 to 15
mph. Chance of rain 40 percent today and
Saturday.
House votes to lift embargo
WASHINGTON — The House reversed its
opposition and voted last night to partly lift
Congress' embargo against U.S. arms sales to
Turkey. The Turks had threatened to close U.S.
bases unless the embargo was lifted.
After initiating Congress' cut-off of all U.S.
military aid to Turkey as of last Feb. 5 and voting
against such aid nine times, the House approved a
bill releasing $185 million in arms shipment.
President Ford made a last minute appeal for
the House approval, saying it was critical to
restoring security interests not only of the United
States but of the North Atlantic alliance.
Backers of the aid said they feared U.S.
surveillance stations in Turkey watching the Soviets
would be lost without the bill and said Congress'
embargo had failed to force Turkey to negotiate a
Cyprus peace.
Ford: Sinai Pact above board
WASHINGTON — President Ford assured the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday
that it has been told about all the secret
understandings reached with Israel and Egypt as
part of the Sinai settlement.
Ford's formal statement, presented in a closed
hearing by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
appeared to remove a roadblock from congressional
approval for the stationing of 200 American
technicians in the desert passes.
However, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) told
reporters the issue of whether the American people
are to be given the information still remains.
Hirohito "deplores" world war
WASHINGTON — Japan's Emperor Hirohito, in
whose name 1.5 million Japanese servicemen died
during World War 11, said last night he deeply
deplores "that most unfortuante war," and he
thanked the United States for its reconstruction
assistance.
The emperor said he has long wished to convey
personally his "gratitude to the people of the
United States for the friendly hand of good will
and assistance their great country accorded us for
our post-war reconstruction, immediately following
that most unfortunate war which I deeply
deplore."
In a toast prepared for a White House dinner in
his honor, Hirohito expressed confidence that "the
story of the generosity and good will of the
American people will be retold from generation to
generation of Japanese for the rest of time."

Spanish police jeer premier
MADRID, Spain — Enraged police officers
attending the funeral of three colleagues slain by
terrorists jeered liberal-leaning Premier Carlos Arias
Navarro yesterday and told him to quit if he had
"any honor left."
Shouts of "we want justice, not clemency" and
"justice yes, pardon no" continually disrupted
services for the three dead policemen, who were
gunned down Wednesday morning.
More than 4,000 police officers jammed the
central court of the military academy to hear a
Roman Catholic friar demand tough anti-terrorism
action.
"These things must not happen again," Friar
Jose Lopez Ortiz said in his funeral oration.
"Judicial sanctions to curb these crimes must be
used. It is hard and punishing work, but it must be
done."
After the mass, scores of armed police and civil
guards struggled with official pall bearers,
demanding to carry the three coffins on their own
shoulders to a military cemetery 12 miles away.
Wholesale prices rise again
WASHINGTON — Prices of foods, fuels and
metals increased sharply at the wholesale level in
September, the government reported yesterday,
signaling a probable new round of price increases
for consumers.
The Labor Department said over-all wholesale
prices in September increased six-tenths of one
percent, down from a gain of eight-tenths of one
percent in August.
Wholesale piices were 6.3 percent higher in
September than a year earlier, but the annual rate
of increase for the last three months was 11.1
percent.
Chairman Arthur F. Burns of the Federal
Reserve Board told the House Budget Committee
yesterday there is concern at the Fed that "a fresh
dose of double-digit inflation" may appear.
Senate keeps gas control bill
WASHINGTON — Republicans won a
temporary victory yesterday as the Senate voted to
keep alive a proposal to remove all federal controls
from natural gas prices within five years.
The 50-45 /ote against a motion that would
have killed the amendment indicated at least half
of the Senate wants to remove price controls at the
same time that it passes legislation to avert a gas
shortage this winter.
House leaders have warned that coupling the

emergency and long-range proposals could block
efforts to prevent the predicted shortage in 14
states this winter.
W.T. Grant files bankruptcy
NEW YORK — W. T. Grant Co., the nationwide

yesterday there is concern at the Fed that "a fresh
dose of double-digit inflation" may appear.
Senate keeps gas control bill
WASHINGTON — Republicans won a
temporary victory yesterday as the Senate voted to
keep alive a proposal to remove all federal controls
from natural gas prices within five years.
The 50-45 /ote against a motion that would
have killed the amendment indicated at least half
of the Senate wants to remove price controls at the
same time that it passes legislation to avert a gas
shortage this winter.
House leaders have warned that coupling the

emergency and long-range proposals could block
efforts to prevent the predicted shortage in 14
states this winter.
W.T. Grant files bankruptcy
NEW YORK — W. T. Grant Co., the nationwide
retail chain which was hit with losses of $111.5
million in the first six months of this year,
yesterday filed for reorganization under the
nation's bankruptcy laws, becoming the largest
retailing failure in U.S. history.
The New York-based chain, which started in
1906, filed papers in federal court here seeking
rearrangement under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws, which would allow it to continue
to operate while trying to reach a suitable
agreement with creditors.
Chapter 11 filing is largely the result of too
rapid expansion in the 1960s by the former "Main
Street" retailer — both into new areas and shopping
centers and into new merchandising lines, such as
household appliances.
Today's weather
Chance of showers today and tonight then
clearing Saturday. Little temperature change. Lows
tonight in the low mid 50s. Highs both days in the
60s and low 70s. West to southwest winds 10 to 15
mph. Chance of rain 40 percent today and
Saturday.
House votes to lift embargo
WASHINGTON — The House reversed its
opposition and voted last night to partly lift
Congress' embargo against U.S. arms sales to
Turkey. The Turks had threatened to close U.S.
bases unless the embargo was lifted.
After initiating Congress' cut-off of all U.S.
military aid to Turkey as of last Feb. 5 and voting
against such aid nine times, the House approved a
bill releasing $185 million in arms shipment.
President Ford made a last minute appeal for
the House approval, saying it was critical to
restoring security interests not only of the United
States but of the North Atlantic alliance.
Backers of the aid said they feared U.S.
surveillance stations in Turkey watching the Soviets
would be lost without the bill and said Congress'
embargo had failed to force Turkey to negotiate a
Cyprus peace.
Ford: Sinai Pact above board
WASHINGTON — President Ford assured the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday
that it has been told about all the secret
understandings reached with Israel and Egypt as
part of the Sinai settlement.
Ford's formal statement, presented in a closed
hearing by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
appeared to remove a roadblock from congressional
approval for the stationing of 200 American
technicians in the desert passes.
However, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) told
reporters the issue of whether the American people
are to be given the information still remains.
Hirohito "deplores" world war
WASHINGTON — Japan's Emperor Hirohito, in
whose name 1.5 million Japanese servicemen died
during World War 11, said last night he deeply
deplores "that most unfortuante war," and he
thanked the United States for its reconstruction
assistance.
The emperor said he has long wished to convey
personally his "gratitude to the people of the
United States for the friendly hand of good will
and assistance their great country accorded us for
our post-war reconstruction, immediately following
that most unfortunate war which I deeply
deplore."
In a toast prepared for a White House dinner in
his honor, Hirohito expressed confidence that "the
story of the generosity and good will of the
American people will be retold from generation to
generation of Japanese for the rest of time."

Spanish police jeer premier
MADRID, Spain — Enraged police officers
attending the funeral of three colleagues slain by
terrorists jeered liberal-leaning Premier Carlos Arias
Navarro yesterday and told him to quit if he had
"any honor left."
Shouts of "we want justice, not clemency" and
"justice yes, pardon no" continually disrupted
services for the three dead policemen, who were
gunned down Wednesday morning.
More than 4,000 police officers jammed the
central court of the military academy to hear a
Roman Catholic friar demand tough anti-terrorism
action.
"These things must not happen again," Friar
Jose Lopez Ortiz said in his funeral oration.
"Judicial sanctions to curb these crimes must be
used. It is hard and punishing work, but it must be
done."
After the mass, scores of armed police and civil
guards struggled with official pall bearers,
demanding to carry the three coffins on their own
shoulders to a military cemetery 12 miles away.
Wholesale prices rise again
WASHINGTON — Prices of foods, fuels and
metals increased sharply at the wholesale level in
September, the government reported yesterday,
signaling a probable new round of price increases
for consumers.
The Labor Department said over-all wholesale
prices in September increased six-tenths of one
percent, down from a gain of eight-tenths of one
percent in August.
Wholesale piices were 6.3 percent higher in
September than a year earlier, but the annual rate
of increase for the last three months was 11.1
percent.
Chairman Arthur F. Burns of the Federal
Reserve Board told the House Budget Committee
yesterday there is concern at the Fed that "a fresh
