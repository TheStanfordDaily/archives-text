# Hearst may face murder indictment
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A
lawyer for Patricia Hearst said
yesterday he's sure the once-fugitive
heiress had nothing to do with any
murder, although he said he won't be
surprised if she is charged with one.
Hearst reportedly has been
identified as the young woman who
rented a garage for a getaway car used
in a suburban Sacramento bank
holdup in which a woman customer
was shotgunned to death. Federal
prosecutors say it's possible Hearst and
her revolutionary companions may be
charged with murder.
"They're undoubtedly trying to
pile up more charges against her,"
attorney Terence Hallinan said in an
interview.
"I'm confident she was never
involved in a murder and if they throw
any murder charge at her, they'll never
make it stick," he said.

In Los Angeles, a county grand jury
indicted Hearst and Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) members
William and Emily Harris in
connection with a May 1974 crime
spree in Los Angeles County.
The indictments charging three
counts of armed robbery, six of assault
with a deadly weapon and two of
kidnaping, were expected to replace
state felony charges previously filed
against the three.
The Harrises have been held in Los
Angeles since last week. Prosecution of
the state charges against Hearst would
depend on developments in the federal
prosecution on a bank robbery charge
here.
Stronger ties
The ties between the SLA and
crimes in Sacramento became stronger
yesterday as the FBI confirmed that
the Harrises lived in a rundown frame
house near the state Capitol from
February to sometime in June.
Those dates coincide with the
murder-holdup at a Crocker National
Bank branch in suburban Carmichael,
and the robbery in February of a
Sacramento savings and loan office.
And the FBI confirmed a San
Francisco Chronicle report that federal
law enforcement sources are positive
Hearst rented the garage used to house
a stolen car employed in the Crocker
robbery. The newspaper quoted its

sources as saying that was Hearst's
only known role in the holdup.
But a number of other links have
been reported between the SLA and
the bank heist. In addition to the fatal
wounding of 42-year-old Myrna
Opsahl, four other persons were
stomped as they lay face down.
Sources say the fingerprints of
James Kilgore, an SLA sympathizer,
were found on one of the two getaway
cars, and a green scarf similar to one
worn by a female robber was found in
the apartment where Hearst and
radical Wendy Yoshimura were
arrested Sept. 18.
Unsent communique
An unsent communique from the
New World Liberation Front claiming
responsibility for the holdup
reportedly was found in the San
Francisco apartment used by the
Harrises. And reports have circulated
that marked currency from the
Carmichael bank was discovered in the
Hearst-Yoshimura apartment, although
authorities have not confirmed that.
After an SLA summit meeting
Wednesday of top prosecutors here,
U.S. Atty. Dwayne Keyes of
Sacramento was asked if authorities
might file murder charges against
Hearst or the Harrises.
"It's under investigation," he told
reporters. "If we find sufficient
evidence, yes. If not, no."

Hearst reportedly has been
identified as the young woman who
rented a garage for a getaway car used
in a suburban Sacramento bank
holdup in which a woman customer
was shotgunned to death. Federal
prosecutors say it's possible Hearst and
her revolutionary companions may be
charged with murder.
"They're undoubtedly trying to
pile up more charges against her,"
attorney Terence Hallinan said in an
interview.
"I'm confident she was never
involved in a murder and if they throw
any murder charge at her, they'll never
make it stick," he said.

In Los Angeles, a county grand jury
indicted Hearst and Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) members
William and Emily Harris in
connection with a May 1974 crime
spree in Los Angeles County.
The indictments charging three
counts of armed robbery, six of assault
with a deadly weapon and two of
kidnaping, were expected to replace
state felony charges previously filed
against the three.
The Harrises have been held in Los
Angeles since last week. Prosecution of
the state charges against Hearst would
depend on developments in the federal
prosecution on a bank robbery charge
here.
Stronger ties
The ties between the SLA and
crimes in Sacramento became stronger
yesterday as the FBI confirmed that
the Harrises lived in a rundown frame
house near the state Capitol from
February to sometime in June.
Those dates coincide with the
murder-holdup at a Crocker National
Bank branch in suburban Carmichael,
and the robbery in February of a
Sacramento savings and loan office.
And the FBI confirmed a San
Francisco Chronicle report that federal
law enforcement sources are positive
Hearst rented the garage used to house
a stolen car employed in the Crocker
robbery. The newspaper quoted its

sources as saying that was Hearst's
only known role in the holdup.
But a number of other links have
been reported between the SLA and
the bank heist. In addition to the fatal
wounding of 42-year-old Myrna
Opsahl, four other persons were
stomped as they lay face down.
Sources say the fingerprints of
James Kilgore, an SLA sympathizer,
were found on one of the two getaway
cars, and a green scarf similar to one
worn by a female robber was found in
the apartment where Hearst and
radical Wendy Yoshimura were
arrested Sept. 18.
Unsent communique
An unsent communique from the
New World Liberation Front claiming
responsibility for the holdup
reportedly was found in the San
Francisco apartment used by the
Harrises. And reports have circulated
that marked currency from the
Carmichael bank was discovered in the
Hearst-Yoshimura apartment, although
authorities have not confirmed that.
After an SLA summit meeting
Wednesday of top prosecutors here,
U.S. Atty. Dwayne Keyes of
Sacramento was asked if authorities
might file murder charges against
Hearst or the Harrises.
"It's under investigation," he told
reporters. "If we find sufficient
evidence, yes. If not, no."
