# At Carnegie Institute
## Research is hot work

One reason no one talks to the
plants at the Carnegie Institution
Department of Plant Biology might be
the weather. The 120 degree heat and
99 percent humidity don't inspire
scintillating conversation.
These steambath-like conditions are
part of an experiment to see what
makes some plants die in a Death
Valley-type environment â€” lack of
moisture, or extreme heat. Generally,
if the plants thrive in this specially
controlled greenhouse, it's the lack of
moisture that kills them in Death
Valley. If they die in this environment,
it's the heat in the Valley that destroys
them.
This is only one of many
experiments being conducted at the
Carnegie Institution, located on an
obscure section of campus across the
street from the Jordan Quad.

According to Biology Prof. Winslow
Briggs, the research conducted at the
Institution's Stanford extension is
divided into three groups: "physical
ecology, or how plants cope with a
stressful, extreme environment,"
photosynthesis research from a
biophysical and biochemical aspect,
and plant development."
Briggs is the director of the
Stanford facility, an offshoot of
Washington's famed Carnegie
Institution. In total there are five
daughter institutions across the
country. The Stanford "department"
is the only one that is exclusively
dedicated to the study of plant
biology.
The Stanford facility recently
underwent major renovation and a $1
million expansion, the first major
addition to the building since the
Carnegie Institution opened it 46 years
ago.
"The long-range objective of many
of the experiments," says Briggs, "is to
see if it is possible to screen for a crop
plant, select for certain biochemical
properties."
One on-going experiment which has
received nationwide coverage involved
converting a Winnebago trailer into a
mobile lab, complete with computer,
which currently is in Death Valley.
Two staff scientists run the lab and
"tow a generator behind themselves.
They can go anywhere," says Briggs.

The scientists are researching how
certain plants "cope with water
stress," according to Briggs. The
sophisticated equipment allows the
researchers to "alter the gas mixture,
alter the amount of air around (the
plant subjects). In my opinion, it's the
best such outfit in the world," says
Briggs.
Death Valley temperatures can hit
125 degrees in the summer. "How do
these plants make it?" asks Briggs. The
answer could possibly involve cell
membranes. "These cell membranes
don't melt. Most plant proteins would
become coagulated like egg whites" in
the intense heat, he said.
Briggs is personally involved in
investigating the "influence of light on
plant development," and has made
new discoveries concerning the effect
of red and infrared light on plant
growth.
Undergraduates can study on the
plant grounds under specific staff
professors and arrange to receive units
for projects they devise and research.
There is currently one undergrad
involved in this.
Briggs says the impressive physical
set-up of the new addition is "designed
to encourage a maximum of
interchange" among the graduate
students, undergraduates, staff
researchers, post-doctorate fellows,
and "visiting investigators" from
around the world, who can stay from a
few months to a few years.
