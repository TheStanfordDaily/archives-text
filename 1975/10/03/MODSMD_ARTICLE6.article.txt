# Budget cuts force TMU reductions

### GEORGE ANDERS 
Budget cuts of nearly $100,000
have forced a reorganization of the
staff at Tresidder Union, according to
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan
Williams.
After two full-time employes left
last year, the University's
across-the-board 17 percent budget cut
prompted Williams to keep their posts
vacant. As a result,he explained, "With
only four full-time equivalents, we're
trying to consolidate responsibilities
by putting each of them in charge of
an area."
New positions
Three new positions have been
created. Thomas Massey is now
director of the office of student
activities; Diana Conklin, manager of
community relations and services; and
Jean Martin, program manager. All
three previously held positions at
Tresidder, and, according to Conklin,
will receive the same salaries.
"We've been wanting to consolidate
student activities for about a year
now," Williams said. "But when Dale
Snape departed, that was the go-ahead
signal." Snape, formerly assistant dean
of students affairs, resigned this
summer to attend the University's
business school.

Williams recalled that "Gordon
Starr, our financial manager, left in
January. I didn't replace him. Rather,
I assumed his job. This cut down on
the time I could supervise other
areas."
Now, Williams said, Conklin,
Massey and Martin "will handle much
of the paper work, and report directly
to me."
Massey added, "Williams' main job
is to make sure Tresidder does not go
into a deficit. These changes break the
span of control, keeping Williams from
also having to make day-to-day
decisions."
Dramatic changes?
"I don't think these are dramatic
changes," Snape maintained. "They're
all taking more responsibility, but
mainly in the area they're already
working in."
Massey, however, expects the office
of student activities to offer improved
services. "Students can come right to
us for information," he noted,
"instead of having to run around from
place to place."
Massey explained that his office
will also "provide small grants to
organizations from the student
initiative fund, oversee the off-campus
student center, and serve as a liason
between the administration and the
ASSU."
Williams said, "We're not going to
be able to do as much" because of the
budget cuts.
Massey said, however, "I'm not sure
anything essential will go. "We'll have
less time to spend with organizations,
but we will be just as cordial," he
remarked.
Conklin agreed, noting that "We've
become much more service-oriented,
instead of thinking of ourselves as a
business."
So far, no budget cuts have affected
the part time staff working under
Massey. However, he admitted, "We
may be forced to make further cuts."
Other improvements
The realignment should improve
other areas, Williams claimed. "As an
example," he said, "Jean Martin used
to have to split her time between being
manager of community services, and
performing fine arts. Now she can
concentrate on being program
manager."
The position requires coordinating
all cultural, social and educational
activities at Tresidder, Williams
explained.
Conklin moves up from being "an

administrative assistant to the financial
manager," Williams said. "She's to
administer all space resources in the
Union, Old Firehouse and Clubhouse."
