# ERA deserves swift defeat
## 
### 
As a woman and a
business-administration and
merchandising double major, I
do anticipate a career. Having
worked my way through college,
I can appreciate the need for job
equality. Since my high school
days in San Francisco, I have
spent a considerable amount of
time traveling in the United
States and have seen the need
for equality in educational
opportunity.
I come with no ax to grind
or vendetta to pay; 1 come only
as a concerned citizen desiring to
expose my fellow constituents
to the dangers of an amendment
that has the potential power of
limiting our freedom and
privacy.
The 27th Amendment to the
Constitution, currently being
presented to the states for
ratification, holds the potential
of wiping out many of our rights
and freedoms in the name of
"equality." In reviewing the
Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA), I would like to point out
(1) the expansion of federal
manipulation, (2) the invasion of
individual rights and (3) the
existence of the objectives of the
ERA under present law.
Vague law
(1) Section II of the Equal
Rights Amendment reads:*. "The
Congress shall have the power to
enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this
article." This v/idespread
authorization would serve to
further amplify the already
awesome power held by the
Washington bureaucracy. This
transfer of power from state to
federal levels will place the
federal government potentially
in control of domestic relations,
such as marriage, divorce,
inheritance issues and child
custody.
Other laws that will be
affected include those dealing
with private property, crime
and labor. As one who abhors
the existing federal regulations, I
shudder to think of what our

bureaucrats can come up with
under this.
Rights invaded
(2) Due to the ambiguity and
vagueness of the wording in the
ERA ("appropriate" legislation
can mean almost anything), the
federal government will be given
a free hand to invade our
individual rights. For example,
the amendment has the power to
force women to place their
children in federal day care
centers so that they can go to
work to support their children
and-or husbands. I personally do
not want to obtain my rights
just because I am a woman. I
want my rights as a human
being, not as a "woman," and
not at the expense of a man's
rights; such an artifical elevation
of my status would not really
accomplish anything. It appears
that statutes deleting specific
labor regulations (such as
maternity leave), and eliminating
men and women's separate
lounges and sleeping quarters
would be likely to flow from
this amendment. Since I treasure
my right to privacy, it disturbs
me that my personal life will be
trampled on by this amendment.
(3) Finally, let us examine
the purpose of the Equal Rights
Amendment. Most would agree
that the issues of equal pay,
equality in jobs and equality in
educational opportunities are
very valid ones. The proponents
of this amendment screech these
slogans from the rooftops.
However, the fact is that these
benefits of the ERA are already
effective under present law.
ERA negates rights
One need look no further
than the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Equal Pay Act of
1963 and the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission. The need is for the
enforcement of the legislation
which already exists, rather than
the accumulation of additional
"baggage." The irony of the
ERA is that it negates the very
rights and privileges which its
advocates desire to secure. It has
a greater propensity toward
enslaving women than setting
them free.
Discrimination against
women is already against the
law. This 27th Amendment
would open a floodgate of
lawsuits that would swamp our
individual freedoms even further
with bureaucratic
pronouncements of what we can
and can't do.

As a woman and a

do anticipate a career. Having
worked my way through college,
I can appreciate the need for job
equality. Since my high school

spent a considerable amount of
time traveling in the United

The 27th Amendment to the
Constitution, currently being
presented to the states for
ratification, holds the potential
of wiping out many of our rights
and freedoms in the name of
"equality." In reviewing the
Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA), I would like to point out
(1) the expansion of federal
manipulation, (2) the invasion of
individual rights and (3) the
existence of the objectives of the
ERA under present law.
Vague law
(1) Section II of the Equal
Rights Amendment reads:*. "The
Congress shall have the power to
enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this
article." This v/idespread
authorization would serve to
further amplify the already
awesome power held by the
Washington bureaucracy. This
transfer of power from state to
federal levels will place the
federal government potentially
in control of domestic relations,
such as marriage, divorce,
inheritance issues and child
custody.
Other laws that will be
affected include those dealing
with private property, crime
and labor. As one who abhors
the existing federal regulations, I
shudder to think of what our

bureaucrats can come up with
under this.
Rights invaded
(2) Due to the ambiguity and
vagueness of the wording in the
ERA ("appropriate" legislation
can mean almost anything), the
federal government will be given
a free hand to invade our
individual rights. For example,
the amendment has the power to
force women to place their
children in federal day care
centers so that they can go to
work to support their children
and-or husbands. I personally do
not want to obtain my rights
just because I am a woman. I
want my rights as a human
being, not as a "woman," and
not at the expense of a man's
rights; such an artifical elevation
of my status would not really
accomplish anything. It appears
that statutes deleting specific
labor regulations (such as
maternity leave), and eliminating
men and women's separate
lounges and sleeping quarters
would be likely to flow from
this amendment. Since I treasure
my right to privacy, it disturbs
me that my personal life will be
trampled on by this amendment.
(3) Finally, let us examine
the purpose of the Equal Rights
Amendment. Most would agree
that the issues of equal pay,
equality in jobs and equality in
educational opportunities are
very valid ones. The proponents
of this amendment screech these
slogans from the rooftops.
However, the fact is that these
benefits of the ERA are already
effective under present law.
ERA negates rights
One need look no further
than the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Equal Pay Act of
1963 and the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission. The need is for the
enforcement of the legislation
which already exists, rather than
the accumulation of additional
"baggage." The irony of the
ERA is that it negates the very
rights and privileges which its
advocates desire to secure. It has
a greater propensity toward
enslaving women than setting
them free.
Discrimination against
women is already against the
law. This 27th Amendment
would open a floodgate of

As a woman and a
business-administration and
merchandising double major, I
do anticipate a career. Having
worked my way through college,
I can appreciate the need for job
equality. Since my high school
days in San Francisco, I have
spent a considerable amount of
time traveling in the United
States and have seen the need
for equality in educational
opportunity.
I come with no ax to grind
or vendetta to pay; 1 come only
as a concerned citizen desiring to
expose my fellow constituents
to the dangers of an amendment
that has the potential power of
limiting our freedom and
privacy.
The 27th Amendment to the
Constitution, currently being
presented to the states for
ratification, holds the potential
of wiping out many of our rights
and freedoms in the name of
"equality." In reviewing the
Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA), I would like to point out
(1) the expansion of federal
manipulation, (2) the invasion of
individual rights and (3) the
existence of the objectives of the
ERA under present law.
Vague law
(1) Section II of the Equal
Rights Amendment reads:*. "The
Congress shall have the power to
enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this
article." This v/idespread
authorization would serve to
further amplify the already
awesome power held by the
Washington bureaucracy. This
transfer of power from state to
federal levels will place the
federal government potentially
in control of domestic relations,
such as marriage, divorce,
inheritance issues and child
custody.
Other laws that will be
affected include those dealing
with private property, crime
and labor. As one who abhors
the existing federal regulations, I
shudder to think of what our

bureaucrats can come up with
under this.
Rights invaded
(2) Due to the ambiguity and
vagueness of the wording in the
ERA ("appropriate" legislation
can mean almost anything), the
federal government will be given
a free hand to invade our
individual rights. For example,
the amendment has the power to
force women to place their
children in federal day care
centers so that they can go to
work to support their children
and-or husbands. I personally do
not want to obtain my rights
just because I am a woman. I
want my rights as a human
being, not as a "woman," and
not at the expense of a man's
rights; such an artifical elevation
of my status would not really
accomplish anything. It appears
that statutes deleting specific
labor regulations (such as
maternity leave), and eliminating
men and women's separate
lounges and sleeping quarters
would be likely to flow from
this amendment. Since I treasure
my right to privacy, it disturbs
me that my personal life will be
trampled on by this amendment.
(3) Finally, let us examine
the purpose of the Equal Rights
Amendment. Most would agree
that the issues of equal pay,
equality in jobs and equality in
educational opportunities are
very valid ones. The proponents
of this amendment screech these
slogans from the rooftops.
However, the fact is that these
benefits of the ERA are already
effective under present law.
ERA negates rights
One need look no further
than the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Equal Pay Act of
1963 and the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission. The need is for the
enforcement of the legislation
which already exists, rather than
the accumulation of additional
"baggage." The irony of the
ERA is that it negates the very
rights and privileges which its
advocates desire to secure. It has
a greater propensity toward
enslaving women than setting
them free.
Discrimination against
women is already against the
law. This 27th Amendment
would open a floodgate of
lawsuits that would swamp our
individual freedoms even further
with bureaucratic
pronouncements of what we can
and can't do.
