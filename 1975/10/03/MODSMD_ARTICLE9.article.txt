# Ford does turnabout on privacy
## 
### Jonathan Marshall 
President Ford's defense of the right of
privacy at his recent address here was
certainly welcome. Yet his call to "protect
every individual from excessive and
unnecessary intrusions by a Big Brother
bureaucracy" represents a radical shift away
from his previous policies.
Ford is one of the staunchest defenders
of Senate Bill 1 (S. 1), the criminal code
reform act that the Los Angeles Times calls
"An assault on the People." The bill would
give the government the right to install
48-hour "emergency" wiretaps without
court approval, and would force telephone
companies and landlords to cooperate
"forthwith" and "unobtrusively." So much
for privacy.
The bill also provides heavy penalties for
leaking or publishing even improperly
classified information (thus putting Jack
Anderson out of business), would
potentially ban most demonstrations and
protests, however peaceful, and would
sanction criminal action by government
employes if authorized by superiors,
despite the lessons of Watergate and
Nuremburg.
As Yale Law Professor Thomas Emerson
has said, "The enactment of S. 1 would
constitute an unparalleled disaster for the
system of individual rights in the United
States. . . .The objective of the draftsmen
was to incorporate into the criminal code
every restriction upon individual liberties

... that the Nixon Administration thought
necessary or useful in pursuit of its fearful
and corrupt policies."
Symptomatic of Ford's disrespect for
civil liberties and the right to privacy is his
attitude toward former members of the
Nixon Administration who flouted such
rights. With Nixon himself, Ford still
maintains friendly relations and even briefs

him in advance on foreign policy decisions.
Yet Nixon's Justice Department wrote the
original version of S. 1 and conducted
hundreds of illegal wiretaps; his plumbers
burgled confidential psychiatric files; his
campaign aids infilitrated the private offices
of Democratic opponents.
Ford has repeatedly voiced his
unqualified respect for Henry Kissinger. Yet
Kissinger ordered the illegal wiretaps on
present and former associates in the White
House. The House Judiciary Committee
concluded that the taps were placed for
political purposes and not for reasons of

national security.
Kissinger's co-conspirator in this
wiretapping was Gen. Alexander Haig, who
ran the White House for Nixon during the
final months of the impeachment
investigation. But President Ford,
overlooking Haig's record on the "right to
privacy," appointed the general as
commander-in-chief of NATO.
Finally, Ford has never shown any
concern for the rights of citizens in the
foreign dictatorships his administration
supports so lavishly with economic and
military aid. In South Korea, the
Philippines, Spain, Brazil and many
other countries backed by U.S. aid, citizens
are fortunate to avoid arrest and torture,
much less wiretaps.
"The best interests of the Chilean
people," Ford said, were served by the U.S.
role in ousting President Allende. Yet,
"Where is the concern of Mr. Ford and
Kissinger," Allende's widow asks, "now that
civil liberties have been destroyed and the
country turned into a showcase for
concentration camps?"
President Ford's victims at home and
abroad will find his "defense" of the right
to privacy repugnant. It was a shame that he
chose Stanford, and particularly the law
school, to sell such a transparent hypocrisy.
