# A
						battered, baffled Stanford battles back
## Today's skirmish should be easy 
### TIM W. FERGUSON 
Usually an army would relish a
battle with a foe as beleaguered as
the one the West Pointers face on
a Northern California Farm today.
After all, the Farm ground
cover has proved inadequate
against a recent air attack by a
third-rate power. And the local
land forces have been fortunate to
get to the gates of the fort before
being turned back.
Perhaps worst of all, the people
of the Farmland have little faith
in their field general. Though the
region's commander-in-chief
expresses continued confidence in
his troops' high command, the
people restlessly rant and chant
for the number two general.
Military parables, however,
sometimes are belied by the facts
of the college football world.
Among these is the fact that the
real Army stands to lose to its real
opponent, Stanford, under
virtually any circumstance.
Or so the oddsmakers imply.
They've made winless Stanford an
18-point favorite over the Cadets
today. The forecasters obviously
are assuming:
—that Card quarterback Mike
Cordova won't be afflicted with
another case of the hometown
blues and throw the game away,
or that Head Coach Jack
Christiansen will recognize the
ailment soon enough to apply the
magic remedy — substitute QB
Guy Benjamin;
—that Stanford's offense,
anticipating double pass coverage
on its wide receivers, will be able
to rejuvenate its impotent running
game in order to neutralize the
defenders' tactics;
—that the Card pass defenders,
routed last week by San Jose
State after an influx of new
personnel into the secondary
ranks,will regroup into a cohesive
unit (the same backs are
scheduled to start), and
—that the Army, though 2-1
for the season, is as bad as recent
West Point squads have been
(three wins in the last two years).
If so, it won't matter whether
coach Homer Smith starts Scott
Gillogly (the runner) or Leamon
Hall (the passer) at quarterback.
Or whether the Cardinals,
reasonably, fail to give a damn
about the game.
They won't be alone in their
attitude, in that case.
Thrills are likely to be short in
number today, so although the
old soldiers of the stands may
never die of boredom, it wouldn't
surprise if they just. . . faded . . .
away ...
