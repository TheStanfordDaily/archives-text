Michigan, 19-19, holding
quarterback Rick Leach to six
completions in 17 attempts for
145 yards and one touchdown.
Item—Homely, a'tniable,
unrecognized-in-the-West-and-un
known-in-the-East San Jose State
defeats Stanford 36-34.
Quarterback Roger Proffitt, who
passed for an all-time school low
three yards the previous week
against Oregon, riddles the
Cardinal secondary for 258 yards
and two touchdowns on 13
completions out of 27 attempts.
Could Stanford's defensive
backfield have deteriorated that
much in just one week?
At first glance, it makes no
sense.
At second glance, it still
doesn't.
But look one more time.
There's more to it.
The Cardinal secondary was
probably neither as good as it
seemed against Michigan nor as
bad as it seemed against San Jose
State.
In the first place, Michigan is

basically a running team, and
Stanford geared its defense to that
phase of the Wolverine offense. A
defensive backfield can look
awfully good when the opposition
doesn't pass. When Leach did
pass, he wasn't all that ineffective.
Six of 17 is a poor completion
rate, but 145 yards is getting a lot
of mileage out of just six
completions.
Secondly, it shouldn't be so
surprising that San Jose State
moved as well as it did against
Stanford.
"In my grading of the films,"
said Card secondary coach Willie
Shaw, "the secondary didn't play
that badly. San Jose State is
basically a roll-out team, so
Proffitt had more time to throw
the ball. We put some pressure on
the quarterback, but he threw real
well under pressure.
"I watched San Jose State's
spring game, so I knew Proffitt
had the ability to be a fine
quarterback. And [Gary]
Maddocks and [Maurice] Hill are
two of the best receivers we've
seen."
Shaw said the Army offense
will present problems similar to

Quarterback Guy Benjamin — still number two
those Stanford encountered
against San Jose State.
"Army is a wishbone team
which throws the ball. They run
outside and throw the ball. I
would expect them to throw
about 50 percent of the time
against us."
Head Coach Jack Christiansen
and Shaw gave two defensive
backs their first Stanford starts
ever against San Jose State, with
freshman Savann Thompson
replacing Paul Skrabo and junior
college transfer Mike Michel
bumping Jeff Siemens.
"The changes," Shaw said,
"were based on practice and
breaking down the game films. In
the Michigan game, Michel and
Thompson graded higher than
Skrabo and Siemens."
Shaw added that the players

are graded on their physical errors
such as missed tackles, and mental
errors such as missed assignments.
Understandably, Skrabo, a
junior, doesn't agree.
"Of course I don't. It would be
foolish for me to admit I
shouldn't be starting. 1 have pride
and confidence in myself, and I
won't ever admit I shouldn't be
starting until I'm fully convinced
that the person ahead of me is
better. Yet, I feel I must respect
the coaches' decision and work to
the best of my ability. I'm not
taking anything away from my
competitors."
One reason Christiansen and
Shaw prefer Thompson at this
time is the latter's speed (4.7 in
the forty).
"We don't feel," Shaw says,
"that we'll have a long run made
against us with Savann in there.

He's got the speed to catch
anybody from behind. He made a
great play against Michigan,
coming across the field to tackle
[Rob] Lytie, and another one
against San Jose State, tacking
[Rick] Kane."
Is Thompson surprised that he's
been elevated to first string as a
freshman? "Yeah, very surprised,"
he said. "I had relegated myself to
saying that I'd work hard this year
and get my big chance next year.
But the coaches said 'Let's see
what he can do now.' That's a
nice reflection on me."
