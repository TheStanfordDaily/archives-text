defeats Stanford 36-34.
Quarterback Roger Proffitt, who
passed for an all-time school low
three yards the previous week
against Oregon, riddles the
Cardinal secondary for 258 yards
and two touchdowns on 13
completions out of 27 attempts.
Could Stanford's defensive
backfield have deteriorated that
much in just one week?
At first glance, it makes no
sense.
At second glance, it still
doesn't.
But look one more time.
There's more to it.
The Cardinal secondary was
probably neither as good as it
seemed against Michigan nor as
bad as it seemed against San Jose
State.
In the first place, Michigan is

basically a running team, and
Stanford geared its defense to that
phase of the Wolverine offense. A
defensive backfield can look
awfully good when the opposition
doesn't pass. When Leach did
pass, he wasn't all that ineffective.
Six of 17 is a poor completion
rate, but 145 yards is getting a lot
of mileage out of just six
completions.
Secondly, it shouldn't be so
surprising that San Jose State
moved as well as it did against
Stanford.
"In my grading of the films,"
said Card secondary coach Willie
Shaw, "the secondary didn't play
that badly. San Jose State is
basically a roll-out team, so
Proffitt had more time to throw
the ball. We put some pressure on
the quarterback, but he threw real
well under pressure.
"I watched San Jose State's
spring game, so I knew Proffitt
had the ability to be a fine
quarterback. And [Gary]
Maddocks and [Maurice] Hill are
two of the best receivers we've
seen."
Shaw said the Army offense
will present problems similar to
