### BOB DEAN 
Poor Army.
Football at West Point is more
of a welfare service than a sport.
Since 1969 the Cadets have
compiled a sparkling 20-40-2
record, while helping to turn
also-ran teams into contenders
overnight.
It's no wonder Army is such a
popular opponent. Schools drool
at the hope of scheduling the
Cadets, particularly at home. If
your school is in a rebuilding
program, give Army a call. If
you're rated in the top five and
looking for a number one ranking,
a big win over Army could do it.
Nebraska used this strategy in
1972 by blasting the Cadets 77-7.
And if you're like Stanford:
winless, you'll most certainly get
your first.
Take 1973 for instance. The
Cadets really went out of their
way to be humanitarian. As if
their 0-10 record wasn't enough,
Army was gracious enough to
score only 67 points to their
opponents' 342.
Stanford played the Cadets last

in 1971. It was its first step
towards the Rose Bowl. As
expected the then-Indians won big
38-3. Then, the following week,
with their egos properly inflated,
Stanford lost to San Jose State.
Presumably Army's form of
revenge.
This year Army has defied the
law of gravity and started out
winning. In their first two games
the Cadets scored 98 points,
exceeding their allotted quota
already. Things got back to
normal last week when the Cadets
were shut out by Villanova, but
Army is still a vastly improved
team. Twenty-seven lettermen are
returning and Coach Smith has
tailored his offense around his
two talented quarterbacks: Scott
Gillogly and Leamon Hall.
Gillogly runs the offensive ground
game while Hall does the passing.
Though the Cadets have played
the patsy in the past, winning is
not beyond the realm of
possibility. With two wins under
its belt, Army has already scared
off scores of future opponents. A
win today could ruin the image.
