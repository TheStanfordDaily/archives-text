# This is grid business
## And Homer Smith, a Stanford alumnus, makes it pay 
### CHRIS BAKER 
By all normal standards,
Homer Smith should probably be
sitting in the executive board
room of some multi-national
corporation instead of roaming
the sidelines every fall football
Saturday.
After all, don't most Stanford
Business School graduates run
corporations? Well, maybe
everyone except Smith. But
Army's second-year head coach is
quick to defend his training.
"Attending Stanford helped
me a great deal," said the 1958
graduate of the Business School.
"I probably appreciated the
education more than most."
And it is probably business
school that gave him his
trademark — organization. "Given

three minutes of time, he [Smith J
would have a Chinese fire drill
running as smoothly as a Rudolph
Nureyev ballet," a rival head
coach once said.
A football business
And the Business School
certainly influenced his view of
football. "Football is much, much
more than a business. It's too real;
it involves too many real people.
But the organizational problems
are still there. That's what's
exciting, the overall challenge of
organization."
Smith came to West Point after
completing a superb organizing
job at UCLA, where he served as
assistant head coach under Pepper
Rodgers in 1972- 73.
It was Smith who helped
install the Wishbone-T offense,
which almost took the Bruins to
the Rose Bowl. Using the
formation for the first time, the
Bruins soared to an 8-3 record in
1972 and shattered the Pac-8
team rushing record. The next
season, Smith's last with UCLA,
the Bruins improved to a 0-2
mark (including a 59-13 thumping
of Stanford) and established still
another conference record — this

one for total offense. Smith and
Rodgers even co-authored a
95,000 word book: Installing
Wishbone-T.
Chose Army
Smith was one of the brightest
assistant coaches in the country,
and when Rodgers returned to his
alma mater, Georgia Tech,
following the 1973 season, Smith
was Army's choice to rebuild the
Cadet football program.
"The March Back," as Army's
press guide calls it, met with
about as much success as the
Army saw in Southeast Asia. The
Cadets suffered last through a 3-8
season, a rather long walk.
And a four-year commitment
to the Army doesn't help win
recruits, who have their hearts and
minds set on playing pro football.
Same as Stanford?
Still, Smith says that recruiting
for the Army isn't any harder
than recruiting for Stanford. "The
Army is a tremendous
opportunity. You're selling a great
program. Both Stanford and the
Military Academy are excellent
academic institutions. Once you
get down to it the only difference
may be the hair. They're both just
exceptional schools."
