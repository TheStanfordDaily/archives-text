# Lyman: debate issues

Last year's controversies over the
Commencement appearance of U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan
and the future of extradepartmental
programs should have been more
academically debated and less emo
tionally argued, President Richard
Lyman told the Academic Council
Friday.
"It ought to be possible to carry on
controversies at a relatively high level
of intelligence, even when emotions
are involved," he remarked. He admit
ted, however, that "ego trips, bureauc
ratic tangles (and) self-serving man
ipulation of other people are not
foreigners in academia."
Such controversies at Stanford
should be debated, said Lyman, "with
relatively greater objectivity
than . . . elsewhere, and with much
sharper recognition of the role and
quality of evidence than one can ex
pect of the world at large.
"Surely, among the things which we
would like undergraduates to be able
to learn while they are here is how to
carry on a controversy on a subject,
about which one feels strongly, with
out losing one's capacity for detached
analysis," Lyman stated.
'Different conclusions'
He added he hoped students in
volved in heated issues could ap
proach them without abandoning
judgment, or yielding capacity to re
think, "and just conceivably to reach
different conclusions from those with
which one began."
Lyman remarked, "I doubt many ob
servers would be prepared to maintain
that we've done very well . . . in recent
years" at debating controversies with
relative objectivity.
