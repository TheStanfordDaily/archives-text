# Lyman: debate issues
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Last year's controversies over the
Commencement appearance of U.N.
Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan
and the future of extradepartmental
programs should have been more
academically debated and less emo
tionally argued, President Richard
Lyman told the Academic Council
Friday.
"It ought to be possible to carry on
controversies at a relatively high level
of intelligence, even when emotions
are involved," he remarked. He admit
ted, however, that "ego trips, bureauc
ratic tangles (and) self-serving man
ipulation of other people are not
foreigners in academia."
Such controversies at Stanford
should be debated, said Lyman, "with
relatively greater objectivity
than . . . elsewhere, and with much
sharper recognition of the role and
quality of evidence than one can ex
pect of the world at large.
"Surely, among the things which we
would like undergraduates to be able
to learn while they are here is how to
carry on a controversy on a subject,
about which one feels strongly, with
out losing one's capacity for detached
analysis," Lyman stated.
'Different conclusions'
He added he hoped students in
volved in heated issues could ap
proach them without abandoning
judgment, or yielding capacity to re
think, "and just conceivably to reach
different conclusions from those with
which one began."
Lyman remarked, "I doubt many ob
servers would be prepared to maintain
that we've done very well . . . in recent
years" at debating controversies with
relative objectivity.
On the controversy over Daniel P.
Moyniahn's selection as Commence
ment speaker last spring, Lyman noted
first that "the potential for a lively and
possibly an enlightening debate was
present here."
Numerous questions might have
been discussed, he proposed, such as
the standards for judging an academi
cian in public office, what constitutes
a valid claim to speak authoritatively
in a given academic specialty, and
others.
However, he said, "the public con
troversy did little to formulate, let
alone treat, those questions. In fact, the
faculty, following the initial challenge
from members of the Anthropology
Department, largely abstained from
public discussion."
'Lack of progress'
Lyman also expressed dissatisfac
tion with the "seeming lack of prog
ress" in debating the issues involved
in student-initiated programs, such as
the Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI) and the
Student Center for Innovation and Re
search in Education (SCIRE).
"The debate has had a curious static
or revolving character; very seldom
has the attempt been made to break the
circle by the introduction of some hard
evidence," he charged. "Critics have
generally seemed reluctant to speak.
Their comments . . . have tended to be
oblique, tangential, or otherwise to
have fallen short of direct engagement
on . . . central questions ..."
Lyman referred to a Daily column
"some time back" which complained
that "speakers at Stanford speak to the
converted, to audiences predisposed
to agree with them. Few people seem
genuinely interested in hearing and
trying to learn from speakers whose
views are sharply at variance with
their own. ... I think that the Daily
columnist's view retains much valid
ity â€” more than is comfortable."
"We need to ask ourselves whether
there are not some further (educa
tional) opportunities . . . that we are
missing, to the detriment of the total
education that is offered here," Lyman
concluded.
