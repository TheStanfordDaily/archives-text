# 'Right' to abort is a myth
## 
### 
The abortion debate is
primarily over three questions:
the humanity of the fetus, the
obligations one person has
toward another and the
conditions under which human
life should be protected.
A careful analysis of these
three questions leads me to
believe that abortion should
only be allowed when necessary
to protect the mother from
death or serious permanent
injury.
If we err in our analysis on
the side of the fetus then we, at
worst, cause the unwanted child
a sad life and the mother an
inconvenience — albeit often a
great one. An error in the
opposite direction, however,
leads to the murder of human
beings.
Therefore, we should give the
benefit of any doubt to the life
of the fetus.
There is strong reason to
believe that the fetus is human.
The fetus is a genetic individual
from conception. Its heart beats
after 25 days. By eight weeks, it
has the basic physical
characteristics of a human.
Fetus is sentient
According to Dr. A.W. Liley,
research professor in perinatal
physiology at the University of
Auckland, "the unborn child
responds to pain, cold, taste and
light. He gets bored with
repetitive signals but can be
taught to be alerted by a first

signal for a second different
one."
Liley adds that although most
studies were done during the
later stages of pregnancy because
it is much more difficult to
study younger fetuses, there is
sufficient evidence to "know
that early fetal responsiveness is
only quantitatively, and not
qualitatively different, from the
early to the later stages of
pregnancy."
Liley concludes that "my
own practice in medicine makes
it very clear that in modern
obstetrics, we are caring for two
individuals, mother and baby."
It is difficult to prove that
the fetus is a human being, but
the evidence certainly suggests
it. Giving the fetus the benefit of
the doubt, we must assume that
the unborn child is a human
being.
Social responsibility
Yet even if the unborn child
is a human being, it does not
necessarily follow that his life
must be protected. Most
libertarians support abortion on
the grounds that we have no
right to force one person to
support another.
Similarly, many feminists
argue that a woman has an
absolute right to control her
own body and therefore to
remove the unborn child even at
the cost of his life.
Though there is a danger of
taking the principle of public

duty too far, people do have a
minimum positive obligation
toward others. If an innocent
person — such as an unborn
child — can only survive with the
minimum aid of another, 1 have
no qualms about forcing such
aid.
Furthermore there is an
implicit contractual relationship
between the unborn child and
his parents. When a man and a
woman have intercourse they are
voluntarily risking a pregnancy
and implicitly promising to
support any children that may
result from their actions.
Nor must we protect the
fetus if we feel we may be so
paternalistic as to decide for
another person that his life is or
would be so sad that it is not
worth living.
This view is behind the
justification of abortion in cases
of deformed or retarded fetuses
and of fetuses that could not be
raised in a proper home.
Yet such an argument would
be equally valid for deformed or
retarded children and for
difficult to adopt orphans. Are
we to allow infanticide as well?
Option of life
Most people prefer life to
death no matter how poor their
situation is. We should at least
allow the unborn child the
option of life.
Some people have argued that
making abortion illegal does not
prevent abortions and only

Bill MacDougall

forces women to have dangerous
operations from unskilled
practitioners.
One could similarly argue
that theft should be legal since
laws against theft do not prevent
theft and increase the danger
that the hurgler might be bitten
by dogs or shot by his intended
victim.
Only when it is necessary to
protect the mother from death
or serious permanent injury
should abortion be permitted. In
this case, the mother's right to
self-defense applies.
In 1973, the U.S. Supreme
Court effectively repealed the
laws of all fifty states regulating
abortion. To reverse this
decision, a constitutional
amendment is required.
We should pass an
amendment which would either
return to the states the right to
protect the unborn child or
grant to the unborn child a
constitutional right to life.
We should as much as
possible treat the fetus as a
human being — at least until our
knowledge of the fetus
improves. And we should not
allow women to kill their
unborn children merely to avoid
a nine-month inconvenience.
Such tolerance of what may
very well be murder will lead to
a further disrespect for human
lives in general.

own body and therefore to
remove the unborn child even at
the cost of his life.
Though there is a danger of
taking the principle of public

duty too far, people do have a
minimum positive obligation
toward others. If an innocent
person — such as an unborn
child — can only survive with the
minimum aid of another, 1 have
no qualms about forcing such
aid.
Furthermore there is an
implicit contractual relationship
between the unborn child and
his parents. When a man and a
woman have intercourse they are
voluntarily risking a pregnancy
and implicitly promising to
support any children that may
result from their actions.
Nor must we protect the
fetus if we feel we may be so
paternalistic as to decide for
another person that his life is or
would be so sad that it is not
worth living.
This view is behind the
justification of abortion in cases
of deformed or retarded fetuses
and of fetuses that could not be
raised in a proper home.
Yet such an argument would
be equally valid for deformed or
retarded children and for
difficult to adopt orphans. Are
we to allow infanticide as well?
Option of life
Most people prefer life to
death no matter how poor their
situation is. We should at least
allow the unborn child the
option of life.
Some people have argued that
making abortion illegal does not
prevent abortions and only

Bill MacDougall

forces women to have dangerous
operations from unskilled
practitioners.
One could similarly argue
that theft should be legal since
laws against theft do not prevent
theft and increase the danger
that the hurgler might be bitten
by dogs or shot by his intended
victim.
Only when it is necessary to
protect the mother from death
or serious permanent injury
should abortion be permitted. In
this case, the mother's right to
self-defense applies.
In 1973, the U.S. Supreme
Court effectively repealed the
laws of all fifty states regulating
abortion. To reverse this
decision, a constitutional
amendment is required.
We should pass an
amendment which would either
return to the states the right to
protect the unborn child or
grant to the unborn child a
constitutional right to life.
We should as much as
possible treat the fetus as a
human being — at least until our
knowledge of the fetus
improves. And we should not
allow women to kill their
unborn children merely to avoid
a nine-month inconvenience.
Such tolerance of what may
very well be murder will lead to
a further disrespect for human
lives in general.
(Bill MacDuuffall, a junior in
economics, is a Daily staffer.)
The abortion debate is
primarily over three questions:
the humanity of the fetus, the
obligations one person has
toward another and the
conditions under which human
life should be protected.
A careful analysis of these
three questions leads me to
believe that abortion should
only be allowed when necessary
to protect the mother from
death or serious permanent
injury.
If we err in our analysis on
the side of the fetus then we, at
worst, cause the unwanted child
a sad life and the mother an
inconvenience — albeit often a
great one. An error in the
opposite direction, however,
leads to the murder of human
beings.
Therefore, we should give the
benefit of any doubt to the life
of the fetus.
There is strong reason to
believe that the fetus is human.
The fetus is a genetic individual
from conception. Its heart beats
after 25 days. By eight weeks, it
has the basic physical
characteristics of a human.
Fetus is sentient
According to Dr. A.W. Liley,
research professor in perinatal
physiology at the University of
Auckland, "the unborn child
responds to pain, cold, taste and
light. He gets bored with
repetitive signals but can be
taught to be alerted by a first

signal for a second different
one."
Liley adds that although most
studies were done during the
later stages of pregnancy because
it is much more difficult to
study younger fetuses, there is
sufficient evidence to "know
that early fetal responsiveness is
only quantitatively, and not
qualitatively different, from the
early to the later stages of
pregnancy."
Liley concludes that "my
own practice in medicine makes
it very clear that in modern
obstetrics, we are caring for two
individuals, mother and baby."
It is difficult to prove that
the fetus is a human being, but
the evidence certainly suggests
it. Giving the fetus the benefit of
the doubt, we must assume that
the unborn child is a human
being.
Social responsibility
Yet even if the unborn child
is a human being, it does not
necessarily follow that his life
must be protected. Most
libertarians support abortion on
the grounds that we have no
right to force one person to
support another.
Similarly, many feminists
argue that a woman has an
absolute right to control her
own body and therefore to
remove the unborn child even at
the cost of his life.
Though there is a danger of
taking the principle of public

duty too far, people do have a

improves. And we should not
allow women to kill their
unborn children merely to avoid
a nine-month inconvenience.
Such tolerance of what may
very well be murder will lead to
a further disrespect for human
lives in general.

economics, is a Daily staffer.)
The abortion debate is
primarily over three questions:
the humanity of the fetus, the
obligations one person has
toward another and the
conditions under which human
life should be protected.
A careful analysis of these
three questions leads me to
believe that abortion should
only be allowed when necessary
to protect the mother from
death or serious permanent
injury.
If we err in our analysis on
the side of the fetus then we, at
worst, cause the unwanted child
a sad life and the mother an
inconvenience — albeit often a
great one. An error in the
opposite direction, however,
leads to the murder of human
beings.
Therefore, we should give the
benefit of any doubt to the life
of the fetus.
There is strong reason to
believe that the fetus is human.
The fetus is a genetic individual
from conception. Its heart beats
after 25 days. By eight weeks, it
has the basic physical
characteristics of a human.
Fetus is sentient
According to Dr. A.W. Liley,
research professor in perinatal
physiology at the University of
Auckland, "the unborn child
responds to pain, cold, taste and
light. He gets bored with
repetitive signals but can be
taught to be alerted by a first

signal for a second different
one."
Liley adds that although most
studies were done during the
later stages of pregnancy because
it is much more difficult to
study younger fetuses, there is
sufficient evidence to "know
that early fetal responsiveness is
only quantitatively, and not
qualitatively different, from the
early to the later stages of
pregnancy."
Liley concludes that "my
own practice in medicine makes
it very clear that in modern
obstetrics, we are caring for two
individuals, mother and baby."
It is difficult to prove that
the fetus is a human being, but
the evidence certainly suggests
it. Giving the fetus the benefit of
the doubt, we must assume that
the unborn child is a human
being.
Social responsibility
Yet even if the unborn child
is a human being, it does not
necessarily follow that his life
must be protected. Most
libertarians support abortion on
the grounds that we have no
right to force one person to
support another.
Similarly, many feminists
argue that a woman has an
absolute right to control her
own body and therefore to
remove the unborn child even at
the cost of his life.
Though there is a danger of
taking the principle of public

duty too far, people do have a
minimum positive obligation
toward others. If an innocent
person — such as an unborn
child — can only survive with the
minimum aid of another, 1 have
no qualms about forcing such
aid.
Furthermore there is an
implicit contractual relationship
between the unborn child and
his parents. When a man and a
woman have intercourse they are
voluntarily risking a pregnancy
and implicitly promising to
support any children that may
result from their actions.
Nor must we protect the
fetus if we feel we may be so
paternalistic as to decide for
another person that his life is or
would be so sad that it is not
worth living.
This view is behind the
justification of abortion in cases
of deformed or retarded fetuses
and of fetuses that could not be
raised in a proper home.
Yet such an argument would
be equally valid for deformed or
retarded children and for
difficult to adopt orphans. Are
we to allow infanticide as well?
Option of life
Most people prefer life to
death no matter how poor their
situation is. We should at least
allow the unborn child the
option of life.
Some people have argued that
making abortion illegal does not
prevent abortions and only

Bill MacDougall

forces women to have dangerous
operations from unskilled
practitioners.
One could similarly argue
that theft should be legal since
laws against theft do not prevent
theft and increase the danger
that the hurgler might be bitten
by dogs or shot by his intended
victim.
Only when it is necessary to
protect the mother from death
or serious permanent injury
should abortion be permitted. In
this case, the mother's right to
self-defense applies.
In 1973, the U.S. Supreme
Court effectively repealed the
laws of all fifty states regulating
abortion. To reverse this
decision, a constitutional
amendment is required.
We should pass an
amendment which would either
return to the states the right to
protect the unborn child or
grant to the unborn child a
constitutional right to life.
We should as much as
possible treat the fetus as a
human being — at least until our
knowledge of the fetus
improves. And we should not
allow women to kill their
unborn children merely to avoid
a nine-month inconvenience.
Such tolerance of what may
very well be murder will lead to
