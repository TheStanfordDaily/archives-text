# With plans, a degree is valuable

I feel that someone at Stanford should
respond to the "useless degree" article
which was published in the Sept. 29 Daily.
The author laments that, "After all the
education I got from Stanford ... I could
not find a . . . 20th floor, big desk . . . job
. . . let all naive Stanford students beware!"
Fortunately, the article doesn't apply to
many Stanford students because very few of
them expect to start at the top.
Perhaps the author merely intended to
be facetious. Obviously, however, she has
not found a job which satisfies her
expectations. It is equally apparent that she
perceives the cause of her frustration to be
related in some way to the nature of the
education she received at Stanford. In this
connection, a few facts should be noted.
Valuable degree
The results of research conducted by the
Western College Placement Association
show that Stanford's graduates are more

highly regarded by employers than those
graduating from most of the other
institutions of higher education in the
United States.
And, the record also indicates that
Stanford's graduates, even in the toughest
job market, usually have fared better upon
graduation than those from other
universities. Therefore, when a Stanford
graduate experiences job hunting
difficulties, it seems appropriate that we
should examine the circumstances involved.
Chasing the clock
Some of the circumstances pertaining to
the author of the article are reasonably well
documented at the Career Planning and
Placement Center. If the record is correct,
she came to the Center for counseling for
the first time on Apr. 2 of her senior year.
She did not subsequently establish a file
of references and even now has not
completed a file. A reference file is

Ralph Keller

important in securing employment.
The purpose of this response, however, is
not to criticize the author of the article.
The point is that a Stanford education, even
if considered only for the purpose of
securing employment, has been shown to be
generally more productive than an
education acquired elsewhere.
These comments should not be
construed to mean that it is easy for college
graduates to find jobs. There are many more
graduates than there are positions for them.
Finding a job can be difficult for a
Stanford graduate, especially if one does
not take advantage of the services offered
by the University until it is too late to use
the assistance effectively.
The time for seniors to come to the
Career Planning and Placement Center is
October at the latest — not the middle of
the Spring Quarter.

Stanford graduate, especially if one does
not take advantage of the services offered
by the University until it is too late to use
the assistance effectively.
The time for seniors to come to the
Career Planning and Placement Center is
October at the latest — not the middle of
the Spring Quarter.

I feel that someone at Stanford should
respond to the "useless degree" article
which was published in the Sept. 29 Daily.
The author laments that, "After all the
education I got from Stanford ... I could
not find a . . . 20th floor, big desk . . . job
. . . let all naive Stanford students beware!"
Fortunately, the article doesn't apply to
many Stanford students because very few of
them expect to start at the top.
Perhaps the author merely intended to
be facetious. Obviously, however, she has
not found a job which satisfies her
expectations. It is equally apparent that she
perceives the cause of her frustration to be
related in some way to the nature of the
education she received at Stanford. In this
connection, a few facts should be noted.
Valuable degree
The results of research conducted by the
Western College Placement Association
show that Stanford's graduates are more

highly regarded by employers than those
graduating from most of the other
institutions of higher education in the
United States.
And, the record also indicates that
Stanford's graduates, even in the toughest
job market, usually have fared better upon
graduation than those from other
universities. Therefore, when a Stanford
graduate experiences job hunting
difficulties, it seems appropriate that we
should examine the circumstances involved.
Chasing the clock
Some of the circumstances pertaining to
the author of the article are reasonably well
documented at the Career Planning and
Placement Center. If the record is correct,
she came to the Center for counseling for
the first time on Apr. 2 of her senior year.
She did not subsequently establish a file
of references and even now has not
completed a file. A reference file is

important in securing employment.
The purpose of this response, however, is
not to criticize the author of the article.
The point is that a Stanford education, even
if considered only for the purpose of
securing employment, has been shown to be
generally more productive than an
education acquired elsewhere.
These comments should not be
construed to mean that it is easy for college
graduates to find jobs. There are many more
graduates than there are positions for them.
Finding a job can be difficult for a
Stanford graduate, especially if one does
not take advantage of the services offered
by the University until it is too late to use
the assistance effectively.
