Banking options

Editor:
A Sept. 29 Daily article
surveyed banking options
available to students. There was
a rather sizable omission from
the article.
In three states, checks may
effectively be drawn on savings
accounts; although technically
these are not checks but
"negotiable orders of
withdrawal," abbreviated
N.O.W.
The result is a checking
account in which the money
earns interest.
Typical of these accounts are
those offered by a Massachusetts
bank. First of all, there is free
checking with no minimum
balance.
Free checks are also available.
Interest is compounded monthly
at an annual five percent rate
and is furthermore based on the
average daily balance, yielding a
higher effective rate than most
savings accounts in California.
Of course, the bank pays all
postage costs for banking by
mail.
With Stanford 1.D., most
places off campus will cash these
checks and they are as good as
any check on campus or for
payments by mail.

Mars probe wasteful
Editor:
It is now known we can
recover life of sterile origin from
boiling carbohydrates, but not
from boiling water.
The origin of life requires a
new concept: carbon-oriented
biocrystals, that can induce
crystals of their own image in
complementary substrates.
Specific areas of a cell will
complement nucleic acid
biocrystals. Viruses and
pathogens send their biocrystals
in complementary regions of a
cell.
Life will appear on any planet
that complements biocrystals.
Searching Mars for the origin
of life, which has been solved in
a bowl of molasses, is like
swinging a sledge-hammer, to
drive a tack.

Money makers
Editor:
Having recently registered, I
have been reminded that
this University is in dire
financial straits. Rent, fee,
tuition increases, parking costs
and new rulings about library
privileges have hit us all hard as a
result. I am offering several
suggestions that may have been
overlooked in fiscal planning.
—Instituting a $20 a quarter
walking license. A taglike metal
license should be inserted
through one's- earlobe, or it
should be branded or tattooed
on one's rump; this license
would be rendered visible by
cutting windows in one's jeans.
—Charging admission to all
campus buildings. The kiosks
should have windows jigsawed in
them where one could buy
booklets of tickets. The main
library might cost 25 cents to
enter, the law building 10 cents,
and psychology 5 cents.
Booklets of different
denominations would tell for
which buildings access is
granted; perhaps a consultant
from Disneyland could help
work out details.
—Charging 10 cents,
admission to the carillon
concerts.
—Installing pay toilets for
both men and women,
converting drinking fountains to
pay ones, and charging people to
sit outside on any bench, chair,
tree or law at 5 cents each.
Toilet paper should be available
in vending machines at one cent
for two sheets.
Other serious-minded
students, staff or faculty
members are urged to offer
further recommendations.
Perhaps a public-spirited group
will finance a contest. We all
must do our bit to help!
