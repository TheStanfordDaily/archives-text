# CNT appeals to chivalry and chauvinism
## Troup joins war between sexes 
### KATHY BATTS 
"One of the first rules for
radicals is to have a sense of
humor."
—Saul Alirisky
Usually, zealots involved in
serious movements find it hard
to laugh at themselves. And
perhaps this humorless outlook
is what lends credence to most
radicals' rhetoric.
But on July 4, the first "Male
Independence Day" was
laughingly ushered in at the San
Francisco Press Club by a group
known as the Chauvinist
Neanderthal Troup (CNT). It has

been laughed at and cursed at by
both sexes, but the Palo Alto
group is a growing organization
which has hopes of spawning a
national movement.
CNT members are, in their own
words, "an assortment of
chauvinists, male sympathizers
and other neanderthal types who
enjoy the natural differences
between the two sexes." They
claim they are not against
women — that they love and
respect most women. But, they
add, they are tired of being
"whipping boys for shrill-voiced
libbers."
Mythical rooster
The troop is the brainchild
of a mythical Hugh "Rooster"
Gillis, who is said to have been
"savagely beaten by an Activist
Patrol of the Indira Gandhi Fan
Club, after publicly challenging
her right to rule on moral
grounds." Supposedly, Gillis has
been in seclusion since the
incident last June.
The actual leaders of the CNT
are Robert Coughlin and
Hehrman Vandenburg, a former
Stanford student. The idea for
the troop evolved early last
summer after a night of drinking
and complaining at Souza's Bar
(The Rat's) in Menlo Park.
"All of us were having similar
problems with our women at
that time," Coughlin says. "So
we decided to do something
about it.
"Remember when it used to
be cool in Washington circles to

invite a black militant to a party
so everyone could listen to him
tell us how bad we honkies
were? That was liberal," he
continues. "Now it's almost
fashionable to be flagellated by
militant feminists and accept our
guilt at being male.
Accidental birth
"We're tired of being put
down just because an act of love
gave us birth as a male."
Coughlin adds that he thinks
the war between the sexes is a
superfluous issue compared with
other problems. "But a
reasonable man can't just say

female chauvinism is as bad as
male chauvinism. So we have to
go out and burn our jock straps
instead."
He says the troup is meant to
poke fun at both sexes.
"Chauvinism is neanderthal.
That's why we chose a cock for
our symbol."
Filling a void
The CNT is a serious
movement, make no mistake
about that. It was created to fill
a void, Coughlin says. There is a
movement for women and one
for gays, but there was no
movement just for men.
The troup boasts over 1000
members, mostly Bay Areans,
since it's public formation in
July. And Coughlin says, there
are nearly 300 women in the
CNT Powder Puff Auxiliary. He
adds they have gotten only four
hate letters so far — and these
have all come from the same
address.
"We've gotten a lot of calls
and mail from other men's
groups," Vandenburg says."The
National Organization for Men
called to find out how serious
we are. And we've also heard
from single fathers' groups."
Vandenburg admits to a
radical element in the CNT.
"Some of us are heavily into
lechery," he says, noting that he
has added the extra "h" in his
name, "so it wouldn't look like
'her man.' "
Should the CNT really get
going, members plan to make a

few changes in society. One of
their major gripes is with the
Social Security Administration.
"If a man dies," Coughlin
says, "his wife collects Social
Security benefits. That's fine
with me. But if a woman dies her
husband cannot collect benefits.
That is unfair."
Men's fashions are another
CNT target.
"They are getting
tyrannical," Vandenburg
complains. "All this unisex crap.
Men and women are biologically
different. That's carrying the
melting pot theory a little too
far.
"It's like telling a black he
has to look white."
But for the time being the
CNT is concentrating on radio

public service spots promoting
chivalry and courtesy.
"We're taking on the militant
women," Vandenburg states.
"They're the ones we're trying
to reach. Everyone should be
free to choose to do as they
wish. If a woman wants to be a
housewife and raise her children,
that's cool. She shouldn't be put
down for that."
Segregation?
The Palo Alto Women's Club
is down the street from the
CNT's Bayshore office.
However, no troup members
have yet tried to accost the club.
"I don't even know if they
allow men in the building,"
Coughlin says. "But if people
want to segregate the sexes,
that's fine with me. I think there

should still be all male bars. But
every time you put up a sign
that says 'No Women,' you get
some libber picketing the place,
even if she personally never
wants to set foot in the place."
A CNT membership kit has
been mailed to Sen. William F.
Buckley (C-N.Y.) and a similar
Powder Puff Auxiliary kit has
been sent to tennis star Billie
Jean King. Coughlin says he has
heard from neither celebrity yet.
"We're not out to harass
anyone needlessly," Coughlin
claims. "We're just getting in a
few licks of our own.
"After all," he adds,
"Everyone knows the answer to
the classic question: 'Which
came first, the chicken or the
egg?' It was the rooster."
