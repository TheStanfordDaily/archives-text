# Social worker vacations in Communist Saigon
## 
### 
OAKLAND (Pacific New Ser
vice) - At a time when most
Americans in Saigon were
scrambling aboard departing
aircraft, Joe Hughes of
Pittsburgh, Pa. was winging
blithely into what seemed to be a
holocaust.
"It's incredible to say that in
April of 1975 I went to Vietnam
for a vacation," Hughes, a
34-year-old social worker, says.
"But as it turned out, that's what
it was."
Hughes, who stayed on in
Saigon until mid-August, went
there to visit his brother Dick, 32,
who since 1968 has headed the
Shoeshine Boy Foundation,
which took care of street chil
dren separated from their homes
by war.
Dick Hughes wanted to stay in
South Vietnam to manage eight
houses of children in Saigon and
Danang, and wasn't worried
about his safety after the Provi
sional Revolut ; onary Govern
ment (PRG) took over. He

wanted Joe to take a first-hand
look, then go back to America
and assure their parents that he
was all right in Saigon.
Business as usual
"Most Saigon people just went
about their business." Joe says of
the PRG takeover, "waiting for
events to take their course."
On April 30, the Saigon p'olice
stationed in the corner by the
Hughes' apartment didn't show
up for work. The cease-fire was
announced that morning. At
about noon the PFG formally
took over the government of
South Vietnam.
"There was incessant shoot
ing that day," Joe recalls, "be
cause the ARVN soldiers had
taken off their uniforms, thrown
them down in the streets with
their guns, and gone home. Kids
were picking up their automatic
rifles and emptying the clips
into the sky."
Shortly thereafter, the Hughes
brothers watched the North Vie
tnamese Army enter their neigh
borhood.
Tanks and flowers
"They came in with their
weapons lowered, with flowers
on their tanks and jeeps," Joe
says. "They politely asked peo
ple for directions, and even
obeyed traffic signals. Local re
sidents watched them ap
prehensively. For years people
had been told by their govern
ment that the communists
would bring a bloodbath to
Saigon."
About 80 North Vietnamese
troops moved into abandoned
apartments in the Vo Thanh
Street apartment house where
Joe and Dick were staying. Not
quite accustomed to being out of
the jungle, the communist sol
diers dragged tree branches into

the halls and cooked on wood
fires. They patroled the neigh
borhood, keeping order.
"They'd walk around, not
bothering anybody, breaking up
fights and generally serving as
police," Joe says.
North Vietnamese troops were
like country bumpkins in
Saigon, and were easy marks for
the sharks of the black market.
"They put especially high
value on watches," Joe says."I
took pictures of about eight sol
diers, each standing with a
watch showing on his arm. It
was the same watch in each pic
ture!"
Joe noticed that Sunday ser
vices went on uninterrupted in
the Catholic Church across the
street from their apartment.
"One North Vietnamese sol
dier had me take his picture in
the door of the Catholic
Church," he recalls. "He's a
Catholic, and wanted his family
in Hanoi to have that picture. Far
from storming the church, the
North Vietnamese troops 1 knew
were ifraid the priest might
chase them out of the
churchyard!"
When Saigon residents
realized there was not going to
be a brutal reprisal campaign, a
tremendous elation swept the
city. Joe says."It was a time of
reunion for many families which
had been separated by partition
of the country in 1954, and by
the war."
The Hughes brothers were al
lowed to travel freely around
Saigon, but like other foreigners
could not leave the city. "We
were politely told that in the
countryside our safety could not
be guaranteed, because we
might meet people who hated all
Americans," Joe says.
