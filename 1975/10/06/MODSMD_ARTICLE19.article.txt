## Cartoonist battles to parody Disney 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (Pacific
News Service) — "You can go
after God, the Virgin Mary, you
can bounce off every rabbi, go
after Billy Graham — but you
can't draw the Mouse," laments
cartoonist Brian O'Neill,
currently persona non grata in
the Wonderful World of Disney.
O'Neill's battle with Mickey
Mouse began five years ago
when, as the creator of the
nationally syndicated comic
strip, "Odd Bodkins," he
decided to parody Disney
characters.
And the battle is still
continuing, with a confrontation
in federal court scheduled this
fall over the sanctity of the
world's most famous cartoon
character.
"It's starting to bother me
a lot, not being able to parody
that stupid mouse," O'Neill
grumbles. "But I find myself in
the strange position where it's a
federal crime if I do."
Air Pirates
After his syndicator canceled
his comic strip in 1970, O'Neill
helped form with several other
cartoonists a group called the
Air Pirates. Holed up in a San
Francisco warehouse, they let
loose some underground comic
books in which Mickey and
Minnie — as well as Pluto, Bambi
and various bugs — engaged in
activities shocking to their
official purveyors. The comic
strip characters took LSD,
enjoyed sex, talked about their
prejudices and shameful deeds.
"It was satire and parody on
the sexual misbehavior of an
entire generation," explains
O'Neill. "It was also a morals
bust on Disney."
The cartoonists' work was cut
short by a Pinkerton man who
came to the studio door with a
summons. Walt Disney
Productions had filed suit,
complaining that the Air Pirates
were competing
infringing on copyright and
trademark, ruining the Disney
reputation. The multi-million
dollar company claimed damages
of $700,000 from the Pirates,
who at the time sometimes
lacked money for a decent meal.
A federal court order
subsequently forbade the Pirates
to continue their parody. All
copies of the first two issues
were seized and later shredded,
says O'Neill.
Mice again
Now O'Neill has again drawn
mice that bear resemblance to
the forbidden Mickey — risking
contempt of court charges — in
an attempt to raise $5,000 to
support his case when it comes
to trial in San Francisco.
His band of fellow defendants
has shrunk from eight to three.
Two, Last Gasp Comics
publisher Ron Turner and
cartoonist Gary Hallgren, settled
last April in a deal with Disney
— agreeing not to caricature any

more Disney characters.
But O'Neill intends to hold
out. At stake for him is the right
to make fun of anything in any
way, a vital part of his freedom
of speech.
"Putting something out of
bounds for ridicule is thought
police," he says.
Above copyrighting
O'Neill argues that Mickey
Mouse has long since
transcended copyright law by
becoming a modern folk myth.
Mickey Mouse has even become
part of the languages: a mickey
mouse course, to students, is a
pushover. Soldiers call VD films
mickey mouse movies. Mickey
mouse has become an adjective
implying triviality and
shoddiness.
After learning to draw as a
child with Disney characters as
models, O'Neill in 1963 began
seven years synidcation of his
"Odd Bodkins" strip — and
became the most controversial
syndicated cartoonist around,
taking on every shade of sacred
cow.

But in 1970, after irritating
the powers-that-be once too
often, O'Neill and Bodkins got
the axe from their
352-newspaper syndication.
That was when O'Neill and the
Air Pirates turned to
underground comics,
churning out nine books in seven
months.
"It looked like we were
actually going to see daylight
and make about $50 to $100 a
week from our drawing," says
O'Neill, "until those Pinkertons
came to the door."
Unfinished parody
The gang scattered, leaving
the third and last Disney parody
back in their series unfinished,
proving once more that Mickey
Mouse enjoyed a protection
from their ink that even the
Virgin Mary didn't have.
It was this sancrosanctity of
the Mouse that led O'Neill to do
the series ithe first place.
"I'd used Christ as early as
'64. God was in there all the
time, a voice coming from the
sky, messing things up. I'd used

[Lyndon] Johnson. But there
were these no-no's about the
Mouse."
That experience naturally
made him itch to draw the little
creature who, across the world,
stood for America as much as
Coca-Cola or the flag.
He considered the whole
Disney world that had saturated
his mind as a kid: It was a world
without sex or sex organs, where
everyone was cut but hardly
innocuous.
Certain characters seemed to
personify ethnic and sexist
stereotypes: Sylvester Shyster
was the greedy Jew. Zeke Wolf
was the bumbling, stupid
southern white. Don Jolio was
the Mexican. Minnie was the
silly girl, clearly less important
than Mickey.
Once upon a time Mickey
Mouse had been innocent,
perhaps, as well as cute. But he
had come to stand with some
sinister allies. In a 1950 strip he
had carried a machine gun, for
instance, while on a mission for
the CIA.
Even the Disney firm had
changed course — once famous
for nature films, it was now
trying to put amusement parks
into natural wilderness areas.
Walt Disney Productions
argued in its demand for an
injunction against the Pirates
that they had indulged in
"perverted" and "grotesque"
misuse of Disney characters and
had portrayed the characters in a
"degrading, lewd and offensive
manner" calculated to "degrade
and disparage all that Disney has
done."
No pornography
O'Neill maintains there's
nothing pornographic in his
parody. Mice and bugs were
simply given the sexual organs
Disney had denied them, and
were allowed to act as mice and
bugs naturally would.
"On its highest level, parody
extends commentary beyond the
original work to the premises on
which the original is based,"
attorneys for the Pirates argued.
Disney claimed that
unsuspecting buyers could have

confused the Pirates' comics
with authentic Disney products,
but O'Neill points out that the
comics were drawn for a small
underground market, with no
intent to expand to other
Disney-like items.
Among those who have
agreed to testify in court for the
Air Pirates are columnists
Nicholas von Hoffman, Charles
McCabe and Art Hoppe, and
National Lampoon founder
Michael O'Donohue.
It may seem funny that
Mickey Mouse and Pluto are
going to court. But there's
nothing funny to O'Neill about
the isse at stake — copyright
versus parody.


PERSONA NON GRATA—Cartoonist Brian O'Neill, currently
involved in a suit with Walt Disney Productions over the right to
parody Mickey Mouse, drew this self-parody for a recent issue of
City of San Francisco magazine.
