# Ford 'reckless'? Yes, say profs
## 
### ROSARIO DeLaTORRE 
President Ford's mingling with
crowds at recent public appear
ances has been "downright reck
less," according to David Daniels,
clinical associate professor of
psychiatry at the Medical Center.
"Such actions as wading into
crowds to 'press the flesh' and mak
ing fatalistic statements tend to en
courage potential assassins, he
said.
Daniels is the author of a position
paper issued in 1972 based on the
studies of the Committee on Viol
ence of the Department of
Psychiatry.
The paper analyzes political as
sassinations in America, outlines
the profile of a potential assassin
and makes recommendations to
candidates and elected officials on
how to reduce the chances of assas
sination.
"The best way to prevent another
presidential assassination is to
modify the President's behavior, to
make him more prudent and re
sponsible," Daniels added.
Limited exposure
The paper recommends that can
didates' exposure at large public
gatherings be limited, especially
after an assassination attempt. Evi
dence shows an assassination at
tempt is more likely shortly after an
unsuccessful attempt.
Basically, it's a great mistake for
candidates to go out and press the
flesh." said Psychiatry Prof. David
Hamburg, who specializes in viol
ence.
"There are a large number of seri
ously disturbed, violently oriented
people in society, and an immense
amount of weaponry available to
them. There's no really adequate
way to protect the President from
such people and weaponry except
by minimizing his exposure,"
Hamburg said.
"The President certainly does not
gain any meaningful exchange of
information or ideas by pressing the
flesh. It comes down to some intan
gible exhilaration," he said.
Fatalistic statements
The paper also advises politi
cians to avoid making fatalistic
statements and expressions of
"false" courage which can lead to
carelessness and encourage poten
tial assassins.
Daniels quoted a statement by
Robert Kennedy as an example of a
fatalistic statement.
"There is no sense in worrying

about those things (assassina
tions)," Kennedy said. "If they want
you, they can get you. I play Rus
sian Roulette every time I get up in
the morning. But I just don't care.
There is nothing I can do about it
anyway."
Daniels' paper also describes the
characteristics of assassins. In al
most every case, they have been
smaller than average size, failing in
life or following a "downhill
course." They are often unable to
relate to women, are obscure or un
known and tend to have delusions
of persecution or grandeur.
"Assassins have distorted views
of their actions. They feel they are
helping their country by perform
ing an act of justice. One assassin
even felt there would be a great out
pouring of public support and rec
ognition for his action," Daniels
explained.
Same for women
Referring to the two recent assas
sination attempts on Ford, Daniels
said he believes the same basic pat
tern remains true for women.
"In the case of Lynette "Squeaky"
Fromme, she felt she was doing
something good by destroying a
symbol of evil," Daniels said.
Another characteristic of past as
sassins according to the paper, is
that all but one used guns. Daniels
said the adoption of some kind of
gun control will not have a great
immediate result because hand
guns will still be readily available.
He explained that the profile was
intended to help understand the
phenomenon of assassination, and
not to provide a basis for identify
ing potential assassins.
"There are thousands of people
that fit the general profile," he said.
"It would be impossible to jail
everyone that fit the profile in order
to protect the President."
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo warned that the profile is not
foolproof. "All it takes is one person
with a gun who doesn't fit the pro
file," he explained.
Zimbardo added that a
psychological analysis, such as a
profile of an assassin who is men
tally disturbed, neglects the social
conditions that have to the assas
sins' mental state.
"Until the social conditions lead
ing to assassinations can be cor
rected. the best deterrent is to keep
the President or other candidates
from taking unnecessary chances."

fatalistic statement.
"There is no sense in worrying

about those things (assassina
tions)," Kennedy said. "If they want
you, they can get you. I play Rus
sian Roulette every time I get up in
the morning. But I just don't care.
There is nothing I can do about it
anyway."
Daniels' paper also describes the
characteristics of assassins. In al
most every case, they have been
smaller than average size, failing in
life or following a "downhill
course." They are often unable to
relate to women, are obscure or un
known and tend to have delusions
of persecution or grandeur.
"Assassins have distorted views
of their actions. They feel they are
helping their country by perform
ing an act of justice. One assassin
even felt there would be a great out
pouring of public support and rec
ognition for his action," Daniels
explained.
Same for women
Referring to the two recent assas
sination attempts on Ford, Daniels
said he believes the same basic pat
tern remains true for women.
"In the case of Lynette "Squeaky"
Fromme, she felt she was doing
something good by destroying a
symbol of evil," Daniels said.
Another characteristic of past as
sassins according to the paper, is
that all but one used guns. Daniels
said the adoption of some kind of
gun control will not have a great
immediate result because hand
guns will still be readily available.
He explained that the profile was
intended to help understand the
phenomenon of assassination, and
not to provide a basis for identify
ing potential assassins.
"There are thousands of people
that fit the general profile," he said.
"It would be impossible to jail
everyone that fit the profile in order
to protect the President."
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo warned that the profile is not
foolproof. "All it takes is one person
with a gun who doesn't fit the pro
file," he explained.
Zimbardo added that a
psychological analysis, such as a
profile of an assassin who is men
tally disturbed, neglects the social
conditions that have to the assas
sins' mental state.
"Until the social conditions lead
ing to assassinations can be cor
rected. the best deterrent is to keep
the President or other candidates
from taking unnecessary chances."
Zimbardo concluded.
President Ford's mingling with
crowds at recent public appear
ances has been "downright reck

clinical associate professor of
psychiatry at the Medical Center.
"Such actions as wading into
crowds to 'press the flesh' and mak

courage potential assassins, he
said.
Daniels is the author of a position
paper issued in 1972 based on the
studies of the Committee on Viol

the profile of a potential assassin
and makes recommendations to

how to reduce the chances of assas

"The best way to prevent another
presidential assassination is to

make him more prudent and re

Limited exposure
The paper recommends that can
didates' exposure at large public
gatherings be limited, especially
after an assassination attempt. Evi
dence shows an assassination at

unsuccessful attempt.

candidates to go out and press the
flesh." said Psychiatry Prof. David
Hamburg, who specializes in viol

"There are a large number of seri
ously disturbed, violently oriented
people in society, and an immense
amount of weaponry available to
them. There's no really adequate
way to protect the President from
such people and weaponry except
by minimizing his exposure,"
Hamburg said.
"The President certainly does not
gain any meaningful exchange of
information or ideas by pressing the
flesh. It comes down to some intan
