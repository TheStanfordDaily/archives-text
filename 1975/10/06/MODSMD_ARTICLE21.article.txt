## Card charge mows down helpless Army 
### RON BECK 
Stanford's football team has
found the perfect antidote for
its pre-season ills — Army.
"No wonder we didn't do too
hot in Vietnam," commented
one spectator after watching the
Cards shoot holes through West
Point's finest to come out on
top, 67-14.
Army was the last chance for
Stanford to sharpen up its game

before next week's Pac-8 opener
against UCLA. And the Cards
took advantage of it.
The running game, which has
appeared hopeless in three
previous contests, was suddenly
superb. Stanford's runners were
able to rush for far more yards
Saturday (321) than they had in
all the other games combined
(231).
"There were holes all over the

place," said running back Ron
Inge who rushed for 60 of those
yards.
Fullback John Finley
notched his second and third
touchdowns of the season on
runs. "The line was blocking
great." Finley added that the
team worked a lot more on
developing a tough running game
in practice. "We worked hard on
it, and we used the practice
well," he said.
Nine minutes into the game,
Stanford started the scoring.
Mike Langford's 38-yard field
goal gave the Cards a 3-0 lead.
Fast return
Less than two minutes later,
Finley cut into the end zone
unmolested on a nine-yard run
that increased the lead to 10-0.
On Army's first offensive play
after thekickoff, linebacker Dan
Francis recovered a fumble that
gave the Cards possession on the
Cadets' 18-yard line.
Quarterback Mike Cordova
continued to mix the plays well,
bringing Stanford to the
one-yard line where Finley
scored his second touchdown of
the game on a twisting
backplunge over the line.
And that's how the game
continued. Stanford notched up
22 points in the second-quarter
on three touchdown strikes by
Cordova: a 22-yarder to Inge, a
42-yard play to receiver Bill

Kellar and a 7-yard bullet to
tight end Ted Pappas.
The Card defense had just
about as easy a time as the
offense, limiting the Cadets to
86 total yards and no points in
the first half.
Offense helps defense
Linebacker Geb Church gave
part of the credit for the
defense's success to the Stanford
offense. "They helped us out
quite a bit by keeping us off the
field," he said with a smile.
Except for 14 Army points,
the second half was virtually
identical. Army scored first with
a well-executed 74-yard scoring
drive. A two-point conversion
cut Stanford's lead to 39-8.
On the next offensive series,
Cordova looked like he did two
weeks ago against Michigan. He
hit Pappas for 16, then threw a
beauty to wide receiver James
Lofton for 44 yards. On fourth
and goal at the Army three,
Christiansen had Cordova go for
the touchdown. Cordova found
running back Sig Ostrom in the
end zone for the score.
Long runback
Stanford's next score came
on an 85-yard interception
return by Ralph Phillips, the
second longest return in

Stanford history. With the score
now at 53-8, Christiansen
decided to put in second-string
quarterback Guy Benjamin.
The Stanford student section
gave Benjamin a standing
ovation when he entered the
game on the Cards' next
offensive series. Benjamin took
over on first and goal of the
Army seven, and on third down
sent Ostrom into the end zone
for another six points.
Stanford's final tally came on
fullback Joe Baumgaertner's
one-yard blast into the end zone.
Benjamin set up the touchdown
with a superbly-placed 22-yard
shot to receiver Jim Jenke.
Army scored the last
touchdown after recovering a
fumble. Cadet quarterback
Leamon Hall completed three
passes in a row for a total of 65
yards and the score.
Chris' thoughts
Christiansen was happy with
everyone's playing, especially
Cordova's.
"I thought Mike threw the ball
awfully well. It's a matter of him
getting loosened up and getting
off to a good start in a game.
When he does that, he's a very
good quarterback.
"We talked about that during

the week, about how important
it was for him to get off to a
good start. It's important for the
rest of the team. In our offense,
the quarterback is so important.
If he doesn't function, we're not
going to move the ball."
And before anyone could
note that Benjamin had also
done pretty well, leading the
team to touchdowns on two of
three drives (a fumble ended the
third drive), Christiansen added:
"I think Mike's a great starting
quarterback, regardless of what
some writers, alumni and fans
think."
Cordova's relief
Cordova, meanwhile, was
relieved to have played only his
second good game in Stanford
Stadium. "I was psyched, and I
felt good today," he explained.
"We simplified the offense a bit,
which helped."
"We can't go into the Pac-8
season wondering if we can win
a game," noted Cordova. "This
was a must-game all-around."
Tony Hill, the nation's
leading receiver, was pleased
with the effectiveness of both
the running and passing. "Our
running made the passing game
much easier," he said. "If we
keep this up, there's no way we

can be stopped."
With some sort of a quality
running game now established,
the defensive secondary that
gave up 36 points to San Jose
State is the only unit still
suspect. But Mike Michel, a
starter in the last two games,
thinks otherwise. "We're going
to be ready for UCLA. It doesn't
matter who's starting or who
gets to play. [The defensive
secondary] is all one unit, and 1
think we're prepared."
Cardinal notes: Army wide
receiver-quarterback Scott
Gillogly went to the hospital and
will probably be out for a few
weeks. . . Cordova's .615
(16-for-26) percentage was his
second highest percentage of
completions at Stanford
Stadium ... first was .622 last
year against Washington .. .
Tony Hill's four grabs were good
enough to keep him on top of
the nation's pass receiving
leaders. . . . Cadet fans stood up
throughout the game and
cheered almost nonstop. .. .
Waldvogel's completed pass for a
two-point conversion was not
planned, said Waldvogel. It was
"completely accidental. Just
good luck."

Army scored the last
touchdown after recovering a
fumble. Cadet quarterback
Leamon Hall completed three
passes in a row for a total of 65
yards and the score.
Chris' thoughts
Christiansen was happy with
everyone's playing, especially
Cordova's.
"I thought Mike threw the ball
awfully well. It's a matter of him
getting loosened up and getting
off to a good start in a game.
When he does that, he's a very
good quarterback.
"We talked about that during

the week, about how important
it was for him to get off to a
good start. It's important for the
rest of the team. In our offense,
the quarterback is so important.
If he doesn't function, we're not
going to move the ball."
And before anyone could
note that Benjamin had also
done pretty well, leading the
team to touchdowns on two of
three drives (a fumble ended the
third drive), Christiansen added:
"I think Mike's a great starting
quarterback, regardless of what
some writers, alumni and fans
think."
Cordova's relief
Cordova, meanwhile, was
relieved to have played only his
second good game in Stanford
Stadium. "I was psyched, and I
felt good today," he explained.
"We simplified the offense a bit,
which helped."
"We can't go into the Pac-8
season wondering if we can win
a game," noted Cordova. "This
was a must-game all-around."
Tony Hill, the nation's
leading receiver, was pleased
with the effectiveness of both
the running and passing. "Our
running made the passing game
much easier," he said. "If we
keep this up, there's no way we

can be stopped."
With some sort of a quality
running game now established,
the defensive secondary that
gave up 36 points to San Jose
State is the only unit still
suspect. But Mike Michel, a
starter in the last two games,
thinks otherwise. "We're going
to be ready for UCLA. It doesn't
matter who's starting or who
gets to play. [The defensive
secondary] is all one unit, and 1
think we're prepared."

receiver-quarterback Scott
Gillogly went to the hospital and

Stanford's football team has
found the perfect antidote for
its pre-season ills — Army.
"No wonder we didn't do too
hot in Vietnam," commented
one spectator after watching the
Cards shoot holes through West
Point's finest to come out on
top, 67-14.
Army was the last chance for
Stanford to sharpen up its game

before next week's Pac-8 opener
against UCLA. And the Cards
took advantage of it.
The running game, which has
appeared hopeless in three
previous contests, was suddenly
superb. Stanford's runners were
able to rush for far more yards
Saturday (321) than they had in
all the other games combined
(231).
"There were holes all over the

place," said running back Ron
Inge who rushed for 60 of those
yards.
Fullback John Finley
notched his second and third
touchdowns of the season on
runs. "The line was blocking
great." Finley added that the
team worked a lot more on
developing a tough running game
in practice. "We worked hard on
it, and we used the practice
well," he said.
Nine minutes into the game,
Stanford started the scoring.
Mike Langford's 38-yard field
goal gave the Cards a 3-0 lead.
Fast return
Less than two minutes later,
Finley cut into the end zone
unmolested on a nine-yard run
that increased the lead to 10-0.
On Army's first offensive play
after thekickoff, linebacker Dan
Francis recovered a fumble that
gave the Cards possession on the
Cadets' 18-yard line.
Quarterback Mike Cordova
continued to mix the plays well,
bringing Stanford to the
one-yard line where Finley
scored his second touchdown of
the game on a twisting
backplunge over the line.
And that's how the game
continued. Stanford notched up
22 points in the second-quarter
on three touchdown strikes by
Cordova: a 22-yarder to Inge, a
42-yard play to receiver Bill

Kellar and a 7-yard bullet to
tight end Ted Pappas.
The Card defense had just
about as easy a time as the
offense, limiting the Cadets to
86 total yards and no points in
the first half.
Offense helps defense
Linebacker Geb Church gave
part of the credit for the
defense's success to the Stanford
offense. "They helped us out
quite a bit by keeping us off the
field," he said with a smile.
Except for 14 Army points,
the second half was virtually
identical. Army scored first with
a well-executed 74-yard scoring
drive. A two-point conversion
cut Stanford's lead to 39-8.
On the next offensive series,
Cordova looked like he did two
weeks ago against Michigan. He
hit Pappas for 16, then threw a
beauty to wide receiver James
Lofton for 44 yards. On fourth
and goal at the Army three,
Christiansen had Cordova go for
the touchdown. Cordova found
running back Sig Ostrom in the
end zone for the score.
Long runback
Stanford's next score came
on an 85-yard interception
return by Ralph Phillips, the
second longest return in

Stanford history. With the score
now at 53-8, Christiansen
decided to put in second-string
quarterback Guy Benjamin.
The Stanford student section
gave Benjamin a standing
ovation when he entered the
game on the Cards' next
offensive series. Benjamin took
over on first and goal of the
Army seven, and on third down
sent Ostrom into the end zone
for another six points.
Stanford's final tally came on
fullback Joe Baumgaertner's
one-yard blast into the end zone.
Benjamin set up the touchdown
with a superbly-placed 22-yard
shot to receiver Jim Jenke.
Army scored the last
touchdown after recovering a
fumble. Cadet quarterback
Leamon Hall completed three
passes in a row for a total of 65
yards and the score.

touchdowns of the season on
runs. "The line was blocking
great." Finley added that the
team worked a lot more on
developing a tough running game
in practice. "We worked hard on
it, and we used the practice
well," he said.
Nine minutes into the game,
Stanford started the scoring.
Mike Langford's 38-yard field
goal gave the Cards a 3-0 lead.
Fast return
Less than two minutes later,
Finley cut into the end zone
unmolested on a nine-yard run
that increased the lead to 10-0.
On Army's first offensive play
after thekickoff, linebacker Dan
Francis recovered a fumble that
gave the Cards possession on the
Cadets' 18-yard line.
Quarterback Mike Cordova
continued to mix the plays well,
bringing Stanford to the
one-yard line where Finley
scored his second touchdown of
the game on a twisting
backplunge over the line.
And that's how the game
continued. Stanford notched up
22 points in the second-quarter
on three touchdown strikes by
Cordova: a 22-yarder to Inge, a
42-yard play to receiver Bill

Kellar and a 7-yard bullet to
tight end Ted Pappas.
The Card defense had just
about as easy a time as the
offense, limiting the Cadets to
86 total yards and no points in
the first half.
Offense helps defense
Linebacker Geb Church gave
part of the credit for the
defense's success to the Stanford
offense. "They helped us out
quite a bit by keeping us off the
field," he said with a smile.
Except for 14 Army points,
the second half was virtually
identical. Army scored first with
a well-executed 74-yard scoring
drive. A two-point conversion
cut Stanford's lead to 39-8.
On the next offensive series,
Cordova looked like he did two
weeks ago against Michigan. He
hit Pappas for 16, then threw a
beauty to wide receiver James
Lofton for 44 yards. On fourth
and goal at the Army three,
Christiansen had Cordova go for
the touchdown. Cordova found
running back Sig Ostrom in the
end zone for the score.
Long runback
Stanford's next score came
on an 85-yard interception
return by Ralph Phillips, the
second longest return in

Stanford history. With the score
now at 53-8, Christiansen
decided to put in second-string
quarterback Guy Benjamin.
The Stanford student section
gave Benjamin a standing
ovation when he entered the
game on the Cards' next
offensive series. Benjamin took
over on first and goal of the
Army seven, and on third down
sent Ostrom into the end zone
for another six points.
Stanford's final tally came on
fullback Joe Baumgaertner's
one-yard blast into the end zone.
Benjamin set up the touchdown
with a superbly-placed 22-yard
shot to receiver Jim Jenke.
Army scored the last
touchdown after recovering a
fumble. Cadet quarterback
Leamon Hall completed three
passes in a row for a total of 65
yards and the score.
Chris' thoughts
Christiansen was happy with
everyone's playing, especially
Cordova's.
"I thought Mike threw the ball
awfully well. It's a matter of him
getting loosened up and getting
off to a good start in a game.
When he does that, he's a very
good quarterback.
"We talked about that during

the week, about how important
it was for him to get off to a
good start. It's important for the
rest of the team. In our offense,
the quarterback is so important.
If he doesn't function, we're not
going to move the ball."
And before anyone could
note that Benjamin had also
done pretty well, leading the
team to touchdowns on two of
three drives (a fumble ended the
third drive), Christiansen added:
"I think Mike's a great starting
quarterback, regardless of what
some writers, alumni and fans
think."
Cordova's relief
Cordova, meanwhile, was
relieved to have played only his
second good game in Stanford
Stadium. "I was psyched, and I
felt good today," he explained.
"We simplified the offense a bit,
which helped."
"We can't go into the Pac-8
season wondering if we can win
a game," noted Cordova. "This
was a must-game all-around."
Tony Hill, the nation's
leading receiver, was pleased
with the effectiveness of both
the running and passing. "Our
running made the passing game
much easier," he said. "If we
keep this up, there's no way we

can be stopped."
With some sort of a quality
running game now established,
the defensive secondary that
gave up 36 points to San Jose
State is the only unit still
suspect. But Mike Michel, a
starter in the last two games,
thinks otherwise. "We're going
to be ready for UCLA. It doesn't
matter who's starting or who
gets to play. [The defensive
secondary] is all one unit, and 1
think we're prepared."
Cardinal notes: Army wide
receiver-quarterback Scott
Gillogly went to the hospital and
will probably be out for a few
weeks. . . Cordova's .615
(16-for-26) percentage was his
second highest percentage of
completions at Stanford
Stadium ... first was .622 last
year against Washington .. .
Tony Hill's four grabs were good
enough to keep him on top of
the nation's pass receiving
leaders. . . . Cadet fans stood up
throughout the game and
cheered almost nonstop. .. .
Waldvogel's completed pass for a
two-point conversion was not
planned, said Waldvogel. It was
"completely accidental. Just
good luck."

Stanford's football team has
found the perfect antidote for
its pre-season ills — Army.
"No wonder we didn't do too
hot in Vietnam," commented
one spectator after watching the
Cards shoot holes through West
Point's finest to come out on
top, 67-14.
Army was the last chance for
Stanford to sharpen up its game

before next week's Pac-8 opener
against UCLA. And the Cards
took advantage of it.
The running game, which has
appeared hopeless in three
previous contests, was suddenly
superb. Stanford's runners were
able to rush for far more yards
Saturday (321) than they had in
all the other games combined
(231).
"There were holes all over the

place," said running back Ron

yards.

three drives (a fumble ended the
third drive), Christiansen added:
"I think Mike's a great starting
quarterback, regardless of what
some writers, alumni and fans
think."
Cordova's relief
Cordova, meanwhile, was
relieved to have played only his
second good game in Stanford
Stadium. "I was psyched, and I
felt good today," he explained.
"We simplified the offense a bit,
which helped."
"We can't go into the Pac-8
season wondering if we can win
a game," noted Cordova. "This
was a must-game all-around."
Tony Hill, the nation's
leading receiver, was pleased
with the effectiveness of both
the running and passing. "Our
running made the passing game
much easier," he said. "If we
keep this up, there's no way we

can be stopped."
With some sort of a quality
running game now established,
the defensive secondary that
gave up 36 points to San Jose
State is the only unit still
suspect. But Mike Michel, a
starter in the last two games,
thinks otherwise. "We're going
to be ready for UCLA. It doesn't
matter who's starting or who
gets to play. [The defensive
secondary] is all one unit, and 1
think we're prepared."

Stanford's football team has
found the perfect antidote for
its pre-season ills — Army.
"No wonder we didn't do too
hot in Vietnam," commented
one spectator after watching the
Cards shoot holes through West
Point's finest to come out on
top, 67-14.
Army was the last chance for
Stanford to sharpen up its game

before next week's Pac-8 opener
against UCLA. And the Cards
took advantage of it.
The running game, which has
appeared hopeless in three
previous contests, was suddenly
superb. Stanford's runners were
able to rush for far more yards
Saturday (321) than they had in
all the other games combined
(231).
"There were holes all over the

place," said running back Ron
Inge who rushed for 60 of those
yards.
Fullback John Finley
notched his second and third
touchdowns of the season on
runs. "The line was blocking
great." Finley added that the
team worked a lot more on
developing a tough running game
in practice. "We worked hard on
it, and we used the practice
well," he said.
Nine minutes into the game,
Stanford started the scoring.
Mike Langford's 38-yard field
goal gave the Cards a 3-0 lead.
Fast return
Less than two minutes later,
Finley cut into the end zone
unmolested on a nine-yard run
that increased the lead to 10-0.
On Army's first offensive play
after thekickoff, linebacker Dan
Francis recovered a fumble that
gave the Cards possession on the
Cadets' 18-yard line.
Quarterback Mike Cordova
continued to mix the plays well,
bringing Stanford to the
one-yard line where Finley
scored his second touchdown of
the game on a twisting
backplunge over the line.
And that's how the game
continued. Stanford notched up
22 points in the second-quarter
on three touchdown strikes by
Cordova: a 22-yarder to Inge, a
42-yard play to receiver Bill

Kellar and a 7-yard bullet to
tight end Ted Pappas.
The Card defense had just
about as easy a time as the
offense, limiting the Cadets to
86 total yards and no points in
the first half.
Offense helps defense
Linebacker Geb Church gave
part of the credit for the
defense's success to the Stanford
offense. "They helped us out
quite a bit by keeping us off the
field," he said with a smile.
Except for 14 Army points,
the second half was virtually
identical. Army scored first with
a well-executed 74-yard scoring
drive. A two-point conversion
cut Stanford's lead to 39-8.
On the next offensive series,
Cordova looked like he did two
weeks ago against Michigan. He
hit Pappas for 16, then threw a
beauty to wide receiver James
Lofton for 44 yards. On fourth
and goal at the Army three,
Christiansen had Cordova go for
the touchdown. Cordova found
running back Sig Ostrom in the
end zone for the score.
Long runback
Stanford's next score came
on an 85-yard interception
return by Ralph Phillips, the
second longest return in

Stanford history. With the score
now at 53-8, Christiansen
decided to put in second-string
quarterback Guy Benjamin.
The Stanford student section
gave Benjamin a standing
ovation when he entered the
game on the Cards' next
offensive series. Benjamin took
over on first and goal of the
Army seven, and on third down
sent Ostrom into the end zone
for another six points.
Stanford's final tally came on
fullback Joe Baumgaertner's
one-yard blast into the end zone.
Benjamin set up the touchdown
with a superbly-placed 22-yard
shot to receiver Jim Jenke.
Army scored the last
touchdown after recovering a
fumble. Cadet quarterback
Leamon Hall completed three
passes in a row for a total of 65
yards and the score.
Chris' thoughts
Christiansen was happy with
everyone's playing, especially
Cordova's.
"I thought Mike threw the ball
awfully well. It's a matter of him
getting loosened up and getting
off to a good start in a game.
When he does that, he's a very
good quarterback.
"We talked about that during

the week, about how important
it was for him to get off to a
good start. It's important for the
rest of the team. In our offense,
the quarterback is so important.
If he doesn't function, we're not
going to move the ball."
And before anyone could
note that Benjamin had also
done pretty well, leading the
team to touchdowns on two of
three drives (a fumble ended the
third drive), Christiansen added:
"I think Mike's a great starting
quarterback, regardless of what
some writers, alumni and fans
think."
Cordova's relief
Cordova, meanwhile, was
relieved to have played only his

"We simplified the offense a bit,
