# Stevenson leads ground assault...
## ...but players reflect after contest 
### 
It was like boot camp. The big tough master sargeant bullying,
abusing and generally harassing the young new recruit. It was
Stanford 67, Army 14. The brass who lined the sidelines — and the
Cadets who came all the way from West Point — were embarrassed.
The defeat was one of the worst in the hollowed history of the
Cadets.
Stanford ground up its opposition on land and in the air. Don
Stevenson. Stanford's junior fullback, made like a runaway tank
and chugged for 112 yards while the Stanford offense picked up
over 500 yards for the game.
At the conclusion of the contest, players from both squads met in
the eastern end zone for prayers. Amidst the din of a departing
crowd, the noise of the band and their own physical hurts which
are a part of any post game atmosphere, the players knelt to reflect
on the events of the day.
In as much as it was the Card's first win of the year. it
was a good one. The coaches thought so. the players thought so as
did the fans.
