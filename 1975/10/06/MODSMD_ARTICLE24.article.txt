# Poloists edge out tough Bears to take NorCal tournament final
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
In China, it's the year of the
rabbit. In water polo, it might
wejl be the year of the Cardinal.
The Stanford water polo
team defeated two-time NCAA
champion California, 10-7, en
route to capturing the Northern
California Aquatic Federation
tournament championship.
In their four tournament
contests, the Cards "out-goaled"
their opponents by a 46-19
margin, finding more openings in
their opponents' goals than the
varsity football team found in
Army's defense. And most of
the opposition's scoring came in
the second half when Coach Art
Lambert substituted freely.
Against Cal in the
championship game, the Card
poloists punctured Cal's
man-to-man defense in
tabulating an insurmountable
6-2 halftime lead. Stanford's

scoring attack was paced by
John Roberts, Drew McDonald
and Rick Johannsen with two
goals apiece.
Dorst defends
Goalie Chris Dorst supported
Stanford's stingy defense in the
first half by making many fine
shot blocks but it didn't help Cal
any that three of the Bears' big
guns were at the Pan-American
games.
"I was very pleased with the
play of Roberts and McDonald,
but I thought it was our team
defense that actually gave us the
game," Lambert said.
In order to reach the
championship game, however,
Stanford had to defeat three
teams in two days — defeat was
not the word for it. The Cards
just swam right over an
unsuspecting Air Force squad,
last year's NorCal small college
division champ, in a 14-5

opening romp. Firepower was
delivered by Johannsen and
Doug Burke's three, and Robbie
Arnold's two goals.
Aggies tough
Less than two hours later,
Stanford was pitted against a
very physical UC-Davis team.
The Cards held their earlier
scoring momentum and won
10-3. Roberts and McDonald led
the scorers with three and two
tallies, respectively, while Dorst
kept the Stanford net pretty
much shut.
"Our three preliminary games
were against teams that we had
not seen before. It was very hard
to know what offense and
defense to use because we
weren't sure what any of our
opponents would throw at us.
"We adjusted very well,
though, in each of the games,"
Lambert added. "I was most
pleased with our consistency
during the games. We never went
down."
Stanford remained consistent
to the end. Meeting their last
obstacle, Long Beach City
College, the Cards rose to the
occasion on Burke's four goals
and McDonald's three and
gained a 12-4 victory, setting up
the Stanford-California
championship matchup.
Stay strong
"Our attitude was the thing
that won the tournament for us.
We just remained at a high level
all through the tournament," the

Cardinal coach said.
According to Lambert,
though, this tournament victory
won't be savored long.
"We have to start working for
our big game next Saturday
against UCLA. We have to make
a transition in our offense as
California plays a man-to-man
while the Bruins play a zone
defense, noted Lambert."
What does the NorCal
championship mean overall to
the team? Well, according to
Lambert, it will give the Cards
the confidence to go all the way,
which wouldn't be bad for a
team that only two years ago
suffered an 0-6 Pac-8 season.

championship matchup.
Stay strong
"Our attitude was the thing
that won the tournament for us.
We just remained at a high level
all through the tournament," the

Cardinal coach said.
According to Lambert,
though, this tournament victory
won't be savored long.
"We have to start working for
our big game next Saturday
against UCLA. We have to make
a transition in our offense as
California plays a man-to-man
while the Bruins play a zone
defense, noted Lambert."
What does the NorCal
championship mean overall to
the team? Well, according to
Lambert, it will give the Cards
the confidence to go all the way,
which wouldn't be bad for a
team that only two years ago
suffered an 0-6 Pac-8 season.

Action goes on in front of the goal in Stanford's win over UC-Davis
In China, it's the year of the
rabbit. In water polo, it might
wejl be the year of the Cardinal.
The Stanford water polo
team defeated two-time NCAA
champion California, 10-7, en
route to capturing the Northern
California Aquatic Federation
tournament championship.
In their four tournament
contests, the Cards "out-goaled"
their opponents by a 46-19
margin, finding more openings in
their opponents' goals than the
varsity football team found in
Army's defense. And most of
the opposition's scoring came in
the second half when Coach Art
Lambert substituted freely.
Against Cal in the
championship game, the Card
poloists punctured Cal's
man-to-man defense in
tabulating an insurmountable
6-2 halftime lead. Stanford's

scoring attack was paced by
John Roberts, Drew McDonald
and Rick Johannsen with two
goals apiece.
Dorst defends
Goalie Chris Dorst supported
Stanford's stingy defense in the
first half by making many fine
shot blocks but it didn't help Cal
any that three of the Bears' big
guns were at the Pan-American
games.
"I was very pleased with the
play of Roberts and McDonald,
but I thought it was our team
defense that actually gave us the
game," Lambert said.
In order to reach the
championship game, however,
Stanford had to defeat three
teams in two days — defeat was
not the word for it. The Cards
just swam right over an
unsuspecting Air Force squad,
last year's NorCal small college
division champ, in a 14-5

opening romp. Firepower was
delivered by Johannsen and
Doug Burke's three, and Robbie
Arnold's two goals.
Aggies tough
Less than two hours later,
Stanford was pitted against a
very physical UC-Davis team.
The Cards held their earlier
scoring momentum and won
10-3. Roberts and McDonald led
the scorers with three and two
tallies, respectively, while Dorst
kept the Stanford net pretty
much shut.
"Our three preliminary games
were against teams that we had
not seen before. It was very hard
to know what offense and
defense to use because we
weren't sure what any of our
opponents would throw at us.
"We adjusted very well,
though, in each of the games,"
Lambert added. "I was most
pleased with our consistency
during the games. We never went
down."
Stanford remained consistent
to the end. Meeting their last
obstacle, Long Beach City
College, the Cards rose to the
occasion on Burke's four goals
and McDonald's three and
gained a 12-4 victory, setting up
the Stanford-California
championship matchup.
