# Booters tumble; Sandoval sets pace

### GEORGE ANDERS 
By all reasonable standards,
the Stanford soccer team was
playing well enough to hold its
own against Southern Cal
Saturday night.
But instead, three
unreasonable USC goals turned
the Cards' opener into a 5-1
trouncing. Five minutes into the
game, halfback Robby Robb,
usually one of the steadiest
players on the team, passed the
ball into his own net.
The Trojans also scored on a
penalty kick that Bert

Baldaccini, on-the-field coach,
said should not have been
awarded.
"Two players were scrapping
for the ball, and the ball
bounced out and hit [wingback
Jim] Melamed in the hand.
There was no question of him
trying to stop a scoring threat.
But the referee on the other side
of the field ran over and called
the penalty."
Shady ref
Baldaccini recalled that "one
of the referees came out of the
stands half an hour before the

game because they couldn't find
anyone else. The players really
had to work to keep calm, with
all the stuff the refs were
doing."
Forward Bob Bonaparte noted
that one of USC's goals "came
on a 40 yard chip shot. That
kind of goal shouldn't happen. I
haven't seen anything like it
since junior high."
Meanwhile, Baldaccini said,
"we were outshooting them, and
kept the ball in their half of the
field most of the game." The
Cards could muster only one
goal though, by Phil Wright,
assisted by Melamed.
"There were some near
misses, including a shot off the
post," Baldaccini said. "But they
had a superb goalkeeper. He was
probably the best player on their
team."
Forward Brian Bershader was
kicked near the end of the game,
and had to be replaced, but
Baldaccini expects him to be
ready for Tuesday's game.
Overlooking the fluke goals,
Baldaccini said his team "played
outstandingly. Those guys
played their hearts out, even
when they got behind. We aren't
too worried about what
happened. There are plenty of
games left to win."

Cross-country
Despite Tony Sandoval's
course record performance,
Stanford's cross country team
fell one point short of winning
the Fresno Invitational Saturday
at Fresno.
Nevada-Reno edged the Cards
46-47 in the eight-team meet.
"We expected to do better,"
coach Marshall Clark said after
the meet. "I'm not going to
single out individuals, but there
were a lot of places where we
could have won. Still,
Nevada-Reno beat us in all the
close places."
Sandoval ripped through the
six-mile course in 29:17.0,
leading all runners. Jack Bellah
placed third in 30.23, Roy
Kissin was 11th in 30.59, Jerry
Emory was 18th in 31:35, and
Alan Cummings was 21st in
31:47.
"Sandoval's time was
outstanding," Clark stated. "In
fact most of the times were
better than usual, but that was
because we ran early in the
morning, before it got hot."
When the placings of runners
not competing for schools were
dropped, the Cards' top five
scores added up to one point
higher than Nevada-Reno's.
