Contrary to popular belief, guys aren't the
only ones out to bust their tails here at
Stanford.
It seems that the women on Stanford's field
hockey team enjoy doing the same.
"Our girls must be in super shape — both
physically and mentally — on par with the men
on the lacrosse and soccer teams," says Head
Coach Shirley Schoof.
Such "super shape" is achieved through
rigorous daily workouts across a 6,000
square-foot grassy field.
These three-hour work-outs involve
timed-runnings, conditioning drills and
scrimmages, all stressing continuous
movement.
During competition, the girls must remain
on the field throughout both 35-minute halves
with only one ten-minute break. "There's no
substitution of players — in and out — as in
football" says Coach Schoof.
A typical practice begins with a series of
individual stretching exercises designed to
limber up still muscles. These are followed by
a timed two-mile endurance run around the
field. Often, a bad time (over sixteen-minutes)
requires an instant-replay run.
Next, comes a solid twenty minutes of
conditioning drills which, according to Schoof,
are "really tough." These include command
runs with sticks, geared to increase hand-leg
coordination.
Of course, all is not physical. "We try to
instill an attitude of team comradeship in the
girls," says Schoof. "After all, one can't be a
field hockey player and be a star, as in other
sports."
Many team members showed their
dedication to the game and each other by
returning to Stanford one week early this year.

"This was the first time we've asked the girls
back for pre season practice and we got a big
turn-out — 26 out of 30," says Schoof.
Coach Schoof holds much confidence in the
ability of this year's team. "We've got the
potential this year to go all the way if the girls
continue to work as hard as they are now in
pre-season practice."
"All the way" means to Harrisonburg,
Virginia, the site of the National Field Hockey
tournament to be held over Thanksgiving
weekend.
Previously, field hockey competition for
the Stanford team ended when the champion
of the Northern California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference (NCIAC) was declared.
This year the top two NCIAC teams will
compete against the top two teams from
Southern California. This Regional match is
scheduled for November 14 and 15. The two
winning teams will head on to Virginia to vie
against other victorious teams from all over the
nation.
New this year in the position of
assistant-coach is Stanford graduate, Carla
Soracco. Soracco is in charge of developing
new team tactics and techniques.
With chalk in hand and blackboard
balanced on knee, Soracco sketches positions
and patterns of a style of play different from
the traditional game of last year. Now Soracco
can freely arrange her players according to the
line-up strategies of competing teams.
Also aiding Soracco and Schoof is
sophomore Louis Alexander, a volunteer
assistant coach in charge of the goal-keepers.
Himself an avid field hockey player from
Australia, Alexander would like to join the
team but is barred from doing so until
conference rules open up the sport to both
sexes.

weekend.
Previously, field hockey competition for
the Stanford team ended when the champion
of the Northern California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference (NCIAC) was declared.
This year the top two NCIAC teams will
compete against the top two teams from
Southern California. This Regional match is
scheduled for November 14 and 15. The two
winning teams will head on to Virginia to vie
against other victorious teams from all over the
nation.
New this year in the position of
assistant-coach is Stanford graduate, Carla
Soracco. Soracco is in charge of developing
new team tactics and techniques.
With chalk in hand and blackboard
balanced on knee, Soracco sketches positions
and patterns of a style of play different from
the traditional game of last year. Now Soracco
can freely arrange her players according to the
line-up strategies of competing teams.
Also aiding Soracco and Schoof is
sophomore Louis Alexander, a volunteer
assistant coach in charge of the goal-keepers.
Himself an avid field hockey player from
Australia, Alexander would like to join the
team but is barred from doing so until
conference rules open up the sport to both
sexes.

Tough practices ready field hockey players for season.
Contrary to popular belief, guys aren't the
only ones out to bust their tails here at
Stanford.
It seems that the women on Stanford's field
hockey team enjoy doing the same.
"Our girls must be in super shape — both
physically and mentally — on par with the men
on the lacrosse and soccer teams," says Head
Coach Shirley Schoof.
Such "super shape" is achieved through
rigorous daily workouts across a 6,000
square-foot grassy field.
These three-hour work-outs involve
timed-runnings, conditioning drills and
scrimmages, all stressing continuous
movement.
During competition, the girls must remain
on the field throughout both 35-minute halves
with only one ten-minute break. "There's no
substitution of players — in and out — as in
football" says Coach Schoof.
A typical practice begins with a series of
individual stretching exercises designed to
limber up still muscles. These are followed by
a timed two-mile endurance run around the
field. Often, a bad time (over sixteen-minutes)
requires an instant-replay run.
Next, comes a solid twenty minutes of
conditioning drills which, according to Schoof,
are "really tough." These include command
runs with sticks, geared to increase hand-leg
coordination.
Of course, all is not physical. "We try to
instill an attitude of team comradeship in the
girls," says Schoof. "After all, one can't be a
field hockey player and be a star, as in other
sports."
Many team members showed their
dedication to the game and each other by
returning to Stanford one week early this year.

"This was the first time we've asked the girls
back for pre season practice and we got a big
turn-out — 26 out of 30," says Schoof.
Coach Schoof holds much confidence in the
ability of this year's team. "We've got the
potential this year to go all the way if the girls
continue to work as hard as they are now in
pre-season practice."
"All the way" means to Harrisonburg,
Virginia, the site of the National Field Hockey
tournament to be held over Thanksgiving
weekend.
