# Pac-8 roundup
## Cal comeback stops Spartans 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
The Pac-8 versus San Jose
State is a new daytime TV
mini-drama appearing on
Saturday afternoons. Although
network shows such as Phyllis,
The Montefuscos and Beacon
Hill received more advance
publicity, The Pac-8 versus San
Jose State has proved far more
popular among Bay Area
viewers.
In the season premier, San
Jose State sent the sickly Oregon
branch of the Pac-8 to the
hospital following the Spartans'
5-0 victory.
The following week's show
saw San Jose State inflict more
pain on the Pac-8 as a result of
its visit at cousin Stanford's
place. Back at the hospital, the
Pac-B's condition had
deteriorated to "serious."
But then, in the final episode
on Saturday, just when it
seemed too late, the Pac-8
snapped out of its coma as
California defeated San Jose
State 27-24 at Berkeley. The
hero was "Dr." Joe Roth.
Roth, a junior starting his
first game ever for Cal, threw a
46-yard touchdown pass to
speedster Wesley Walker with
1:08 remaining Saturday to give
Cal its victory in the Pac-B's last
opportunity this season to get
back at San Jose State.
"That pass was perfect," said
Walker. "Roth really showed us

something today. He's some
quarterback."
Cal's winning drive originated
on its own 22 yard line with
3:05 left. After San Jose State's
Kim Bokamper dropped Roth
on Cal's 10-yard line, the Bears
faced a crucial third-and-22
situation.
Roth, who completed 11 of
24 passes for 206 yards and two
touchdowns on the day, then hit
Chuck Muncie over the middle
for 25 yards, leading to the TD
pass to Walker a few plays later.
Cal's Muncie rushed for 95
yards on 18 carries, while
quarterback Roger Proffitt of
San Jose State completed 12 of
30 passes for 196 yards and was
named the offensive player of
the game.
Meanwhile, second-ranked
Ohio State, which usually
reserves trips to California for
Rose Bowl games, successfully
displayed its disciplined offense
in defeating 13th-ranked UCLA,
41-20, in Los Angeles. The win
may project the Buckeyes into
the number one position
nationally, as the present leader,
Oklahoma, barely edged
Colorado 21-20.
Archie Griffin, the 1974
Heisman Trophy winner, rushed
for over 100 yards for the
4000 th consecutive game
(actually only 25) as Ohio State
accumulated 343 yards on the
ground. Quarterback Cornelius

Greene ran for 120 yards
himself, and fullback Pete
Johnson scored his 10th and
11th touchdowns of the young
season.
Third-ranked USC (4-0)
rebounded from a surprising
10-point deficit to give lowa its
fourth straight loss this year and
eighth straight going back to last
season. Sophomore quarterback
Rob Hertel directed the Trojans'
27-16 win in place of the injured
Vince Evans.
Hertel did nothing of value,
except give the ball to Ricky
Bell, who gained 163 yards on
26 carries. Bell's season rushing
totals may soon have to be
measured in kilometers.
USC held the Hawks to 71
rushing yards as the Trojans are
now unbeaten in their last 15
games.
Who else but the
impoverished Oregon Ducks
could blow a possible victory on
a delay-of-game penalty?
Probably only the San Francisco
49ers. Thanks to the penalty and
an overall lack of talent, Oregon
lost its Pac-8 opener Saturday to
Washington, 27-17.
Washington State lost to
Illinois 27-21 in a game that saw

the teams rush for 581 yards
combined, while Grambling
defeated Oregon State 19-12.
