Do fragments of SLA remain?
SAN FRANCISCO — "The SLA lives on!" That was the message in a com
munique signed "Symbionese Liberation Army" and dropped last weekend in
San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles.
And despite FBI claims that the back of the SLA's seven-headed cobra was
broken by the arrests of Patty Hearst and her companions, some law enforce
ment investigators contend privately that some members cf the tiny terrorist
group may remain unknown and at large.
In other weekend developments:
— U.S. Dist. Judge Oliver Carter granted a one-day extension to a psychiatric
panel examining Hearst, and her competency hearing was postponed from
Tuesday until Wednesday.
The four members were appointed to determine whether Hearst is too frail to
undergo cross-examination on her affidavit, as her lawyers claim.
— Martin Soliah said it was his tip to the FBI that led authorities to his son,
Steven, and from him to the Hearst and Harris arrests.
— Randolph and Catherine Hearst visited their daughter in jail for about an
hour and 45 minutes Saturday. Thsy refused to say what was discussed.
— Her chief defense attorney, F. Lee Bailey, said Hearst's mental state will be
the most important element in her defense.
Arson reported in firemen's strike
KANSAS CITY — Arson and sabotage reports continued yesterday in the
third day of a bitter strike by Kansas City firemen seeking pay parity with
police.
. . there were strong indications that arson was involved in six fires in
abandoned buildings," City Fire Director Frank Spink said of the fires Saturday
night and Sunday morning. "They were in unusual locations and under un
usual circumstances."
Spokesmen for city management and the firefighters' union both said Sun
day no further negotiations were scheduled.
Mayor Charles B. Wheeler Jr. said if the illegal strike continues the city will
lay off the striking firemen and hire new ones.
Emperor sees varied U.S. lifestyles
NKW YORK — Japan's Emperor Hirohito, on a visit intended to put the final
touch to the reconciliation of his country and the United States, got a kaleides
copic view of American society Sunday.
The emperor's day started with a school children's serenade in Central Park,
which was followed by a tour of Vice President and Mrs. Nelson A.
Rockefeller's new Japanese-style house. He ended his public appearances
Sunday at the New York Jets-New England Patriots football game.
The emperor made no reference to the arrest in New York Saturday night of
two Chinese-Americans and confiscation of a small arsenal of rifles, automatic
weapons and even a bow-and-arrow.
Poor grain harvest in USSR
MOSCOW — Preliminary reports on a poor grain harvest in the Ukraine
tended yesterday to confirm Western estimates of a total Soviet crop about 40
million metric tons below planned totals.
In the first authoritative harvest figures given out by the Soviets this year, the
IJkranian Communist party chief said the average harvest for the five years now
ending would be 40 million metric tons a year*
Calculations show that would mean a Ukranian harvest of only about 33.6
million tons this year, just slightly above the disastrous year of 1972.
While the Ukranian yield could not be projected across the Soviet Union, it

does explain the Soviet rush to buy 9.8 million tons of American grain and
eagerness to talk about long-term purchases.
Democratic candidates rap Ford's policies

tic presidential nomination criticized President Ford's economic policies this

tions?"
Besides Harris, announced contenders for the presidential nomination at the
meeting Saturday were Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, former North Carolina
Gov. Terry Sanford, Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona. R. Sargent Shriver and
Sen.Henry }ackson of Washington.
