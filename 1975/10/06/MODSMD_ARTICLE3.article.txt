# Buckley talk perplexes panelists, audience
## 
### RICHARD FEARON TERENCE MEALMAN 
William F. Buckley, Jr.'s Friday
night address reminded Law Prof.
Kenneth Scott of a Jackson Pollock
painting. "It was like a tapestry —
some of the threads were gold and
some were silver, but I couldn't see the
pattern."
Buckley spoke before an overflow
Memorial Auditorium crowd. San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto and
Scott appeared with him.
The majority of the audience seemed
to agree with Scott.

"The most interesting part of the
program were the comments by Scott
and Alioto, and the arguments bet
ween Alioto, and Buckley," said one
student. "I found the speech almost
incomprehensible."
Buckley's address rambled for fifty
minutes and consisted of describing
what he said were five serious prob
lems of freedom.
"None of the points seemed to bear
much relationship to any other," com
plained one observer.
'Freedom to deceive'
"The freedom to deceive is overin
dulged," said Buckley, describing the
first problem.
Politicians are some of the most ob
vious practitioners of deception, said
Buckley. "But in a society where there
is also freedom to criticize, the politi
cians probably would not get away
with deception," he said.
A second major problem, Buckley
noted, is that the intellectual stance of
the defenders of capitalism is tied di
rectly to their moral characters. He
said that moral characteristics should
be deemphasized.
He also chastised those capitalists
who flee "into the protective arms of
government at the least hint of social
difficulty."
'Opposition to socialism'
Buckley's third point was that "op
position to socialism must remain

primarily negative and should take
strength from being so." He stated that
imagination and courage would be
necessary to defeat growing socialism.
He said he doubted freedom would
lead America to Utopia, but advocated
freedom because "1 believe that human
beings should be free."
However, by exalting freedom "we
encourage certain kinds of confusion,"
he admitted. This confusion may re
sult from personal indecision or from
lack of serious thought on a matter,
explained Buckley, citing Betty Ford's
recent comments on her daughter's sex
life.
His final point was that the future of
the Republican party should not be
considered closed. Buckley said that
"no precedent" existed for automati
cally renominating a man who became
President through a non-elective
route.
He also said he hoped Ronald
Reagan would run for the Republican
nomination in the New Hampshire
primary.
Alioto and Scott delivered brief
commentaries following Buckley's
50-minute speech.
Alioto's criticism
Alioto critized Buckley's complaint
that too much deception exists.
He cited the case of the ex-marine
who foiled Sarah Moore's attempted

assassination of Ford and later was
publically exposed as a homosexual.
This information alienated his friends
and family, said Alioto.
Alioto also said he is skeptical of
whether the problems of housing for
the poor and full employment can be
solved without government interven
tion.
Dealing with failure
Scott said we need to investigate the
ability of the free-market system to
deal with its failure. He cited the
economic failure of New York City,
Lockheed and Penn Central as exam
ples.
Buckley defended his free-market
stance following the speeches by
Alioto and Scott, listing seven free
market reasons why he approved of the
government plan to bail out Penn Cen
tral, since such action would hurt the
stockholders.
Questions from the audience were
addressed to the panelists following
Buckley's remarks.
Buckley's speech was sponsored by
the Stanford Conservative Forum. The
Forum plans several additional speak
ing programs for the remainder of the
year
