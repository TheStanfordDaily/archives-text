# Doctors take calls

### 
Have you longed to have your snif
fles treated by handsome Dr. Gannon
only to get kindly old Dr. Welby in
stead? Now you can make an appoint
ment at Cowell Health Center to see
your favorite doctor.
Previously, only gynecologists,
psychologists and orthopedists

operated on an appointment basis a'
Cowell. Starting this quarter, all doc
tors are available for appointments at
specified times. It makes no difference
whether or not the student has previ
ously gone to Cowell.
Walk-in care will still be available at
all times. Mondays and Fridays are set
up exclusively for walk-in treatment to
handle the weekend overload.
Dr. James B. McClenahan, director of
Cowell, said the change was brought
about to "distribute the patient flow
more evenly through the week." For
merly patients sometimes had to wait
30 to 45 minutes on Mondays and Fri
days.
Shorter waits
McClenahan hopes that shifting to a
partial appointment basis will shorten
or eliminate the waiting time.
More time is presently allocated to
walk-in treatment than to appoint
ments because, according to
McClenahan, students are more used
to coming in without appointments.
However, as the new system con
tinues. more time may be allocated to
appointments.
"We may evolve to where 50 to 70
percent of the students are seen on an
appointment basis," McClenahan
said.
