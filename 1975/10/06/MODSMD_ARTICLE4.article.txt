# FBI mailed phony letters

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The FBI
mailed phony letters to top Michigan
Democrats in a 1965 effort to persuade
them that socialists had infiltrated the
Young Democrats Club at Wayne State
University, according to newly
disclosed FBI documents.
The files, made public yesterday,
also show that the FBI told Cleveland
school officials that a local music
teacher was married to a Socialist
Workers party activist.
The FBI claimed that the action
prompted the school board to fire the
woman.
The documents were released by the
Political Rights Defense Fund, which
represents the Socialist Workers, in a
$27 million lawsuit accusing the FBI
of unconstitutional harassment and
disruption of legitimate political activ
ity.
The FBI was required by a court
order to turn over the secret files to the
party.
Cointelpro
Many files in the latest batch pro
vided to the party describe acts under
taken as part of the FBl's broad coun
terintelligence programs, known as
Cointelpro, against the Socialist
Workers and various political milit
ants on the right and left.
The FBI has said the formal Cointel
pro operation ended in April 1971.
But some of the documents show
that the FBI was interviewing and
keeping files on party members as late
as 1972 and 1973.
The defense fund described the
Michigan incident as an attempt "to
poison relations between the
Michigan Democratic party and its
youth affiliate" on the Detroit campus.
First case
"This incident is the first
documented case in which the FBI
tried to disrupt the affairs of either the
Democratic or Republican parties,"
said a defense fund statement.
The documents show that the De
troit FBI office clipped news accounts
from the Wayne State newspaper re
porting allegations that the Young
Socialist Alliance (YSA) had infil
trated the Young Democrats.
One report quoted YSA leader Jan
Garrett as denying there was any infilt
ration and labeling the charge "com
pletely ridiculous."
But the Detroit FBI office won head
quarters approval to mail copies of the
clippings and a phony letter, purpor
tedly from a Wayne State student, to
the Democratic State Central Commit
tee and six other state and city Democ
ratic organizations, the documents
said.

The letter described the writer as a
member of the campus Young Repub
licans who was complaining about al
leged socialist efforts to infiltrate the
Young Republicans as well as the
Young Democrats.
'Fictitious name'
The letter was signed "Paul Mac A
ndrew," which the FBI memo described
as "a fictitious name."
In the Cleveland case, the docu
ments show that FBI agents learned
that an elementary school music
teacher hired on a probationary basis
was married to Rod Holt, chairman of
the Ohio campaign committee for the
Socialist Workers party's 1963 presi
dential candidate.
