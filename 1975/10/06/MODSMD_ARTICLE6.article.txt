# 'Decade for discovery'
## Cancer research lab dedicated 
### ROB LENCE 
"This is going to be the decade for
discovery of a cancer vaccination; that
is my personal conviction." Radiology
Prof. Henry S. Kaplan said Saturday at
the dedication of the new Louis B.
Mayer Cancer Research Laboratory-
The $1.2 million laboratory, located
on Pasteur Drive and Governor's Lane
near the Medical Center, will house a
new program of cancer research under
Kaplan's direction.
Projects involving an intensive at
tack on the fundamental aspects of
human lymphomas (tumors made up
of lymphoid tissue), and the increas
ingly strong possibility that they may
be caused by a virus, wi 11 be carried out
on the first floor of the new building.
On the second floor, the staff will
study the mechanisms underlying the
development of very similar lym
phomas in mice.
'Attack on cancer'
"Three or four years ago I realized
that the time had come for an all out
attack on cancer and lymphomas."
said Kaplan. "At this time lymphomas
are the most favorable area for re
search. However, we hope to extend
research into all areas of cancer even
tually."
Kaplan also said a separate building
was necessary so few people would be
exposed to a potentially dangerous
virus.
Completion of the laboratory was
made possible by a combination of
public and private funding. Support
came from the National Cancer Insti
tute. the Louis B. Mayer Foundation,
the Friends of Radiology, and an
anonymous gift through the San Fran
cisco Foundation.
The building has been named in
honor of the late Louis B. Mayer, the
Russian immigrant whose interest in
films began in 1908 and who served as

vice-president and chief of production
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for
28 years.
'None better
Dr. Frank J. Rauscher, director of the
National Cancer Institute, said at the
dedication that he has toured many
facilities across the country, but that
he had "seen none better than this
cancer research center."
Rauscher also called for an end to
what he called "halfway technology."

"We must do all we can for today's
cancer patient and not worry only
about tomorrow's patient," he said.
"We must also concentrate our efforts
on the prevention of cancer by deter
mining those who have a high risk of
cancer and have these people come in
more often for a check up."
University President Richard W.
Lyman presented the building, and
Board of Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown made the acceptance

speech. Melvin C. IJry, chairman of the
Friends of Radiology Steering Com
mittee, acknowledged the donors.
Faculty investigators who will be
working in the laboratory with Kaplan
are Michael Feldman, visiting profes
sor in cell biology and Asst. Radiology
Prof. Zvi Y. Fuks.
Research Associates will be Marcia
M. Bieber. Alan Decleve, Miriam
Lieberman and Peter N. Rosenthal.

on the first floor of the new building.
On the second floor, the staff will
study the mechanisms underlying the
development of very similar lym
phomas in mice.
'Attack on cancer'
"Three or four years ago I realized
that the time had come for an all out
attack on cancer and lymphomas."
said Kaplan. "At this time lymphomas
are the most favorable area for re
search. However, we hope to extend
research into all areas of cancer even
tually."
Kaplan also said a separate building
was necessary so few people would be
exposed to a potentially dangerous
virus.
Completion of the laboratory was
made possible by a combination of
public and private funding. Support
came from the National Cancer Insti
tute. the Louis B. Mayer Foundation,
the Friends of Radiology, and an
anonymous gift through the San Fran
cisco Foundation.
The building has been named in
honor of the late Louis B. Mayer, the
Russian immigrant whose interest in
films began in 1908 and who served as

vice-president and chief of production
of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for
28 years.
'None better
Dr. Frank J. Rauscher, director of the
National Cancer Institute, said at the
dedication that he has toured many
facilities across the country, but that
he had "seen none better than this
cancer research center."
Rauscher also called for an end to
what he called "halfway technology."

"We must do all we can for today's
cancer patient and not worry only
about tomorrow's patient," he said.
"We must also concentrate our efforts
on the prevention of cancer by deter
mining those who have a high risk of
cancer and have these people come in
more often for a check up."
University President Richard W.
Lyman presented the building, and
Board of Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown made the acceptance

speech. Melvin C. IJry, chairman of the
Friends of Radiology Steering Com
mittee, acknowledged the donors.
Faculty investigators who will be
working in the laboratory with Kaplan
are Michael Feldman, visiting profes
sor in cell biology and Asst. Radiology
Prof. Zvi Y. Fuks.
Research Associates will be Marcia
M. Bieber. Alan Decleve, Miriam
Lieberman and Peter N. Rosenthal.
