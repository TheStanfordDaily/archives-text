William A. Clebsch's Oct. 2
Daily letter regarding access to
books on homosexuality raises
several points that need
clarification.
It may indeed be true that
restrictions must be placed on the
circulation of materials that have
a high probability of being stolen
because of their special interest,
but it is my contention that the
present procedure is too
indiscriminate and fails to
consider adequately the content
of a work.
In fact, when I told a
sociologist employed by the Gay
Community of Concern project,
that Donn Teal's The Gay
Militants was shelved in the
locked stacks area, his reply was,
"Oh, are they trying to protect
the students from boredom?"
Many of the works on
homosexuality are far from
titillating and some of them aren't
even very interesting. On the
other hand, a collection of gay
poetry, some of which is
undeniably homoerotic, is shelved
on the open stacks, presumedly
because its Library of Congress
classification number prevented
its being detected and squirreled
away.
World not perfect
Clebsch also states that were
men and women gods and
goddesses it would not be
necessary to place restrictions on
the circulation of holdings.
Yes, and if this were a perfect
society where gay people were
accepted as human beings with an
equally valid lifestyle and
recognized as having the ability to
develop full and satisfying forms
of sexual and emotional behavior
rather than stigmatized,
categorized, persecuted, and
discriminated against because of
their sexual orientation, then
upon discovering their potential
to express love for those of their
own sex, they would not suffer
from a sense of overwhelming
shame and guilt, and"it would
not be necessary to place
restrictions on the circulation of
holdings."
Beyond the rules
From the tone of Clebsch's
column, it is apparent that he
wishes to see this matter as
dealing principally with library
rules, regulations, procedures,
policies, and costs instead of real
people.
In that sense, it is an issue
dramatically illustrating the
purposes and goals of the gay
liberation, feminist, and men's
liberation movements, where, as
Stokely Carmichael and Charles
Hamilton state in Black Power, a
reorientation is sought to place

Richard A. Thomas

"an emphasis on the dignity of
human beings, not on the sanctity
of property."
The psychological wholeness of
human beings must not be
sacrificed on the altar of
institutional efficiency and
economy.
Suppression of gays
The following analogy will
amplify my point. Suppose that
our present society were to
develop into that technocratic
nightmare so often a theme of
literature and the cinema, where
efficiency, productivity, and
practicality are the principal
values of society, and we are
reduced to parts of a gigantic
machine, units on the assembly
line.
And let us suppose that
religious feelings and a belief in a
transcendent being were seen as
impractical, superfluous, and
resulting in inefficiency.
And in fact these were not
only incomprehensible but a
threat to society, and therefore all
those who expressed such feelings
were held in contempt, despised,
and ridiculed.
There were from time to time
individuals who, without being
aware how it happened, realized
that they believed in something
more than objective reality, who
felt that there was a transcendent
power that was a ground of all
being and a spiritual force in their
own lives.
They were naturally afraid and
ashamed of these feelings and
mentioned them to no one but
felt compelled to find out if
others had felt this way and went
to their university library to find
out more.
Justifiably fearful of being
stigmatized and persecuted, they
sometimes stole these religious
works. As a result all the works
dealing with these people and
their beliefs were locked away in
the sensitive area of the libraries.
This was, of course,necessary.
I believe that the present
library policy reinforces and
continues the oppression of gay
men and women by our society.
Perhaps to no longer limit access
to works on homosexuality would
be financially burdensome to the
University.
But what that cost is should at
least be ascertained. And then the
Committee on Libraries must
decide if this is too much to pay
to aid students in regaining the
sense of self-worth and
self-acceptance that an intolerant
and ignorant society stole from
them.

that Donn Teal's The Gay
Militants was shelved in the
locked stacks area, his reply was,
"Oh, are they trying to protect
the students from boredom?"
Many of the works on
homosexuality are far from
titillating and some of them aren't
even very interesting. On the
other hand, a collection of gay
poetry, some of which is
undeniably homoerotic, is shelved
on the open stacks, presumedly
because its Library of Congress
classification number prevented
its being detected and squirreled
away.
World not perfect
Clebsch also states that were
men and women gods and
goddesses it would not be
necessary to place restrictions on
the circulation of holdings.
Yes, and if this were a perfect
society where gay people were
accepted as human beings with an
equally valid lifestyle and
recognized as having the ability to
develop full and satisfying forms
of sexual and emotional behavior
rather than stigmatized,
categorized, persecuted, and
discriminated against because of
their sexual orientation, then
upon discovering their potential
to express love for those of their
own sex, they would not suffer
from a sense of overwhelming
shame and guilt, and"it would
not be necessary to place
restrictions on the circulation of
holdings."
Beyond the rules
From the tone of Clebsch's
column, it is apparent that he
wishes to see this matter as
dealing principally with library
rules, regulations, procedures,
policies, and costs instead of real
people.
In that sense, it is an issue
dramatically illustrating the
purposes and goals of the gay
liberation, feminist, and men's
liberation movements, where, as
Stokely Carmichael and Charles
Hamilton state in Black Power, a
reorientation is sought to place

Richard A. Thomas

"an emphasis on the dignity of
human beings, not on the sanctity
of property."
The psychological wholeness of
human beings must not be
sacrificed on the altar of
institutional efficiency and
economy.
Suppression of gays
The following analogy will
amplify my point. Suppose that
our present society were to
develop into that technocratic
nightmare so often a theme of
literature and the cinema, where
efficiency, productivity, and
practicality are the principal
values of society, and we are
reduced to parts of a gigantic
machine, units on the assembly
line.
And let us suppose that
religious feelings and a belief in a
transcendent being were seen as
impractical, superfluous, and
resulting in inefficiency.
And in fact these were not
only incomprehensible but a
threat to society, and therefore all
those who expressed such feelings
were held in contempt, despised,
and ridiculed.
There were from time to time
individuals who, without being
aware how it happened, realized
that they believed in something
more than objective reality, who
felt that there was a transcendent
power that was a ground of all
being and a spiritual force in their
own lives.
They were naturally afraid and
ashamed of these feelings and
mentioned them to no one but
felt compelled to find out if
others had felt this way and went
to their university library to find
out more.
Justifiably fearful of being
stigmatized and persecuted, they
sometimes stole these religious
works. As a result all the works
dealing with these people and
their beliefs were locked away in
the sensitive area of the libraries.
This was, of course,necessary.
I believe that the present
library policy reinforces and
continues the oppression of gay
men and women by our society.
Perhaps to no longer limit access
to works on homosexuality would
be financially burdensome to the
University.
But what that cost is should at
least be ascertained. And then the
Committee on Libraries must
decide if this is too much to pay
to aid students in regaining the
sense of self-worth and
self-acceptance that an intolerant
and ignorant society stole from
them.

William A. Clebsch's Oct. 2
Daily letter regarding access to
books on homosexuality raises
several points that need
clarification.
It may indeed be true that

a high probability of being stolen
because of their special interest,
but it is my contention that the
present procedure is too
indiscriminate and fails to
consider adequately the content
of a work.

World not perfect
Clebsch also states that were
men and women gods and
goddesses it would not be
necessary to place restrictions on
the circulation of holdings.
Yes, and if this were a perfect
society where gay people were
accepted as human beings with an
equally valid lifestyle and
recognized as having the ability to
develop full and satisfying forms
of sexual and emotional behavior
rather than stigmatized,
categorized, persecuted, and
discriminated against because of
their sexual orientation, then
upon discovering their potential
to express love for those of their
own sex, they would not suffer
from a sense of overwhelming
shame and guilt, and"it would
not be necessary to place
restrictions on the circulation of
holdings."
Beyond the rules
From the tone of Clebsch's
column, it is apparent that he
wishes to see this matter as
dealing principally with library
rules, regulations, procedures,
policies, and costs instead of real
people.
In that sense, it is an issue
dramatically illustrating the
purposes and goals of the gay
liberation, feminist, and men's
liberation movements, where, as
Stokely Carmichael and Charles
Hamilton state in Black Power, a
reorientation is sought to place

"an emphasis on the dignity of
human beings, not on the sanctity
of property."
The psychological wholeness of
human beings must not be
sacrificed on the altar of
institutional efficiency and
economy.
Suppression of gays
The following analogy will
amplify my point. Suppose that
our present society were to
develop into that technocratic
nightmare so often a theme of
literature and the cinema, where
efficiency, productivity, and
practicality are the principal
values of society, and we are
reduced to parts of a gigantic
machine, units on the assembly
line.
And let us suppose that
religious feelings and a belief in a
transcendent being were seen as
impractical, superfluous, and
resulting in inefficiency.
And in fact these were not
only incomprehensible but a
threat to society, and therefore all
those who expressed such feelings
were held in contempt, despised,
and ridiculed.
There were from time to time
individuals who, without being
aware how it happened, realized
that they believed in something
more than objective reality, who
felt that there was a transcendent
power that was a ground of all
being and a spiritual force in their
own lives.
They were naturally afraid and
ashamed of these feelings and
mentioned them to no one but
felt compelled to find out if
others had felt this way and went
to their university library to find
out more.
Justifiably fearful of being
stigmatized and persecuted, they
sometimes stole these religious
works. As a result all the works
dealing with these people and
their beliefs were locked away in
the sensitive area of the libraries.
This was, of course,necessary.
I believe that the present
library policy reinforces and
continues the oppression of gay
men and women by our society.
Perhaps to no longer limit access
to works on homosexuality would
be financially burdensome to the
University.
But what that cost is should at
least be ascertained. And then the
Committee on Libraries must
decide if this is too much to pay
to aid students in regaining the
sense of self-worth and
self-acceptance that an intolerant
and ignorant society stole from
them.
