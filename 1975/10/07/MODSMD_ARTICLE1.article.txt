# Ski equipment exhibition spurs review of policies regulating White Plaza use
## 
### JANICE BRESSLER JOHN FREED 
White Plaza teemed with ski
enthusiasts, gawkers and seven large
vans of ski equipment yesterday,
prompting an examination of
unrestricted use of the plaza.
The congestion resulted from a ski
show operated by a commercial outfit
and sponsored by the Stanford Ski
Club.
The show, described by one student
as an eye sore, should not have been
located in the plaza, according to Dan
Williams, associate dean of student
affairs.
"That exhibit is not the type of
thing we have in mind as being a
proper use of the plaza," Williams said.
"Nobody was in error, but it was
certainly not something we expected."
No formal policy currently governs
use of the plaza, according to Tom

Massey, assistant dean of student
affairs.
Dale Snape, former assistant dean
of student affairs, said "Federal tax
code states that University land must
be used only for educational purposes
to remain tax — exempt."
"How they got permission [to use
the plaza] is now under scrutiny,"
Massey commented.
Ski Club President Mark Winkler
said representatives of Harry Leonard
Co. asked to set up the show "to
promote interest in skiing. "Winkler
said he had no idea that salesmen
would be selling products — such as
scarves called "Midas Mufflers."
"The main purpose was to promote
skiing itself, not the products, Winkler
commented.
The lack of any formal procedure
for using White Plaza surprised
Richard Gates, manager of Harry

Leonard Co.
"Most campuses require a permit
and request a copy of my insurance
policy. Nothing like that was done
here," Gates noted.
Apparently, all a group wishing to
use the plaza must do is inform Randy
Phillips, director of ASSU Special
Events. Unless there is a schedule
conflict, requests are routinely
approved, Phillips said.
Winkler claimed a secretary at the
ASSU office reserved the plaza for the
Ski Club yesterday, but Phillips
thought otherwise.
"I knew nothing about it except
that on my way back from class I went
in and saw the show," Phillips said.
"Who okayed it, I don't know."
Williams and Winkler both agreed
that additional regulations are needed.
"We have to develop some
procedure so that we can avoid these
situations in the future," Williams said.
"However, I don't want to come up
with something that overregulates the
plaza, either."
The dangers of the other extreme —
underregulation — were demonstrated
at 1:26 p.m. when a Police Services
car, proceeding to an accident at the
Engineering Corner, was forced to
weave through the crowd at White
Plaza.
The ski show's large vans irritated
one vendor, who noted that vendors
cannot bring cars onto the plaza

because of an informal agreement with
police.
But Policy Services Lt. Walter
Konar reported no complaints about
the vans. Williams said the ban on
vehicles applies only to the vendors,
and not to special events.
Massey forsees new regulations in
the "near future," and encouraged
student input into the decision-making
process.

SKI BUFF—Skiing enthusiasts were treated to an avalanche of equipment in White Plaza yesterday, but complaints
from students forced to slalom through the numerous exhibits prompted re-evaluation of White Plaza use policies.
