# Parking issue input avidly sought
## 
### 
Roger Hardy was dead wrong.
In a Daily column on Oct. 2,
Hardy stated that "input from
the community was largely
unsolicited and ignored when
proferred" relative to
development of the new parking
regulations.
This is absolutely false. In
fact, there has probably been no
recent issue on campus where
community input was more
energetically sought out than on
the parking issue.
Peter Carpenter, assistant
vice-president for Medical
Affairs and administrator of the
parking study, held eight
well-publicized open hearings
throughout the campus to
ascertain community sentiment;
met several times with the
Parking Subcommittee of the
University Committee on Land
and Building Development
(whose members include faculty,
staff and students); and solicited
and received a detailed set of
recommendations from the
ASSU Senate.

In addition, an extensive
survey of community parking
behavior, attitudes and
preferences was conducted by a
group of Business School
students as part of Carpenter's
study.
The survey consisted of an
eight-page questionnaire which
was sent to 1500
randomly-chosen members of
the community, of whom about
40 percent responded.
But that's not all. After
Carpenter completed his study,
it was reprinted in its entirety on
two full pages of the Daily. The
Land and Building Committee
then conducted its own public
hearing, a lively three-hour
session attended by over 150
community members.
If that's not community
input, I don't know what is.
Input was used
And the input was anything
but ignored. Many of the
specific grievances raised in the
public hearings and nearly all of

the ASSU Senate's
recommendations were
addressed or incorporated in the
Carpenter report.
Moreover, many of the more
distasteful or stringent
regulations recommend in it
(including the amount of the
parking fee) were softened by
the committee that made the
final recommendations to
President Richard Lyman.
Nevertheless, it appears that
Stanford's motives for levying
the parking fee have raised some
discomfiting questions: most
feel the University did it simply
to raise money.
In fact, the University has
taken the valid position that
parking is a privilege, not a right.
Further, it is a privilege that
should be paid for by the users
rather than by the University
(and, therefore, by all students
and other donors).
It costs money to build and
maintain parking lots, and it
seems fair that those who use

the lots should pay for them.
Excess money
There is still a problem,
though: given the size of the
parking fees, there'll probably be
money left over after covering
maintenance and other costs.
If the philosophy expressed
in the Carpenter report and
elsewhere is adhered to, then
that money should go towards
developing and improving
bikepaths and other means of
intra-campus travel; the first of
these improvements should
almost certainly be an
on-campus tram or shuttle
service.
If such improvements are not
made, however, then I believe
that one of the largest-scale
ripoffs ever will have been
perpetrated on the Stanford
community. Only time will tell
if this is the case or not.
