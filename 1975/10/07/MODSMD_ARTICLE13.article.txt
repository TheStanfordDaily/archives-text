## Lavatelli art graces law school 
### 
A new sculpture has been
recently acquired by the
University in its quest for
decorating the new law school.
Carla Lavatelli's stainless steel
and bronze sculpture, entitled
"One and a Half," has been
placed in the inner courtyard
near the student lounge.
The sculpture is valued at
$40,000, according to Lavatelli's
son, Carlo Herrmann, who
donated the art piece.
"It's a decorative piece," says
Art Prof. Albert Elsen. "It's nice
for an intimate space like that
courtyard."
Elsen adds that he is glad to
see more sculpture being placed
on campus.
"This courtyard is a good
place to combine sculpture,
architecture, law and thought,"
Herrmann says of the sculpture's
placement. "I think it adds life
to these buildings."
The sculpture was produced
in Italy in 1970, where Lavatelli,
an American artist, has her
studios. One of the two pieces is
of cut and shined solid stainless
steel, the other is of hollow
bronze.
Herrmann, an electrical
engineer at Watkins-Johnson Co.
in Palo Alto, received his masters
degree from Stanford in 1972.
"I wanted to share something
with Stanford, after all it's given
me," he says, adding that he
chose one of his mother's
sculptures for this purpose.
Law Prof. John Merryman
obtained the sculpture from
Herrmann. Lavatelli's portfolio
has also been donated to the Art
Department library.

Herrmann says he has
followed the progression of art
on campus. He says he is
honored to have his mother's
works added here. "It's like
placing a young master among
older ones."
Her work has recently become
a part of the prestigious Phillips
Collection in Washington D.C. In
the last 10 years she has had 15
one-man shows.
Some of her works are
preserved in the National Art
Gallery, the Chamber of
Deputies and the Palace of
Justice (all in Rome), Palace of
Prince Ranier 111 in Monaco, the
Springold Theatre of Brandeis
University, the Norton Museum
in Florida and the Hakone
Open-Air Museum in Japan.

A new sculpture has been
recently acquired by the
University in its quest for
decorating the new law school.
Carla Lavatelli's stainless steel
and bronze sculpture, entitled
"One and a Half," has been
placed in the inner courtyard
near the student lounge.
The sculpture is valued at
$40,000, according to Lavatelli's
son, Carlo Herrmann, who
donated the art piece.
"It's a decorative piece," says
Art Prof. Albert Elsen. "It's nice
for an intimate space like that
courtyard."
Elsen adds that he is glad to
see more sculpture being placed
on campus.
"This courtyard is a good
place to combine sculpture,
architecture, law and thought,"
Herrmann says of the sculpture's
placement. "I think it adds life
to these buildings."
The sculpture was produced
in Italy in 1970, where Lavatelli,
an American artist, has her
studios. One of the two pieces is
of cut and shined solid stainless
steel, the other is of hollow
bronze.
Herrmann, an electrical
engineer at Watkins-Johnson Co.
in Palo Alto, received his masters
degree from Stanford in 1972.
"I wanted to share something
with Stanford, after all it's given
me," he says, adding that he
chose one of his mother's
sculptures for this purpose.
Law Prof. John Merryman
obtained the sculpture from
Herrmann. Lavatelli's portfolio
has also been donated to the Art
Department library.

Herrmann says he has
followed the progression of art
on campus. He says he is
honored to have his mother's
works added here. "It's like
placing a young master among
older ones."
Her work has recently become
a part of the prestigious Phillips
Collection in Washington D.C. In
the last 10 years she has had 15
one-man shows.
Some of her works are
preserved in the National Art
Gallery, the Chamber of
Deputies and the Palace of
Justice (all in Rome), Palace of
Prince Ranier 111 in Monaco, the
Springold Theatre of Brandeis
University, the Norton Museum
in Florida and the Hakone
Open-Air Museum in Japan.
