Why did Plant Services provide the microphones
for the anti-Ford rally here last month? Is this the
way the University spends our money?—C.S.
No, it's not. The microphones were rented by
the Bridge at a cost of $11.30 an hour.

What is the recipe for the dip that the
Coffeehouse serves with their crudites? I love that
stuff—A. S.
The following recipe probably serves more
people than you will ever have. However, a word
of caution. If you cut the recipe down, you
cannot cut the spices down in exact proportion.
For some reason, you will probably need to
increase the spices somewhat — suit your own
taste.
1 gallon mayonnaise
V2 cup curry
V/ 2 cups ketchup
V2 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 cup chopped onions
1 tsp. garlic granules
2 tsps. salt
1 Tb.Tabasco sauce

Was that a prayer group that met in the end zone
of the field after the last two home football
games? It looked like it was made up of 30-40
members of both teams. I can understand why
our team would want (and need) to pray after the
San Jose State game, but it seemed a bit
unnecessary after Army.—G.J.S.
The group was a prayer group. Jim Stump,
formerly part of the Christian ministry staff at
Stanford, leads members of both teams in prayer
after all home games. In addition, Stanford team
members pray before the games and on Tuesday
nights.
"It's produced some tremendous
relationships," Stump said. "One Army player
said that he'd played a lot of football but he'd
never seen the kind of men he'd met at Stanford.
He was impressed that they'd get down after a
game right there on the field and thank God."
Stump estimated that about 25 members of
the Stanford team participate regularly in the
prayer group, but says it has no real name. "Some
people call it the Fellowship of Christian
Athletes, but we're not hung up on titles," he
said. "We're just a bunch of men who want to get
to know God better."
