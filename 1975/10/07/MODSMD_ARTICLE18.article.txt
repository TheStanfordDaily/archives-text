# Student advisors provide information on academics
## 
### JACK VAUGHN 
In an effort to supplement
the undergraduate advising
system, the Academic
Information Center is sponsoring
an experiment in peer advising in
Stern and Branner Halls.
The idea for the pilot
program, consisting of eight
undergraduates trained to
answer students' questions on
academic programs and
requirements, originated with
ASSU Vice President Charlotte
Germane.
"Last year, [Dean of
Students Research Director]
John Black did a survey of the

student body and found that
students would rather talk to
other students," Germane said.
In response to this feeling,
Germane last May began
contacting residence assistant
(RA) candidates and students
who had worked on freshman
orientation to find potential
advisors. After interviews, she
selected the first team and
secured support from Academic
Information Center Director
Robert Hamrdla.
"I believe this program is a
way to give access for students
to people specifically trained in
academic advising," said

Hamrdla. While not accepting
peer advising as a "manna from
heaven," Hamrdla agreed
Germane's program is "worth a
try" and has placed it under the
center's auspices.
No conclusions yet
Neither Germane nor
Hamrdla has reached any
conclusions about continuing
the program.
"Each of the advisors has
kept judicious records of how
many people have come and
what kinds of questions they are
asking," said Hamrdla. "If the
records show there are not
enough, or that the questions
can be answered somewhere
else," the program may be
abandoned, he stated.
The decision on continuing
the program probably won't be
made before the end of the year,
Hamrdla said.
Typical questions the advisors
were asked concerned
"distribution requirements,
courses where there was a
conflict between the [/ISSt/]
Course Guide and Approaching
Stanford, course load and
freshman English requirements,"
according to peer advisor Bruce
Kadden.
As advising continues through
the quarter, Kopersky expects
problems with "not liking
classes, having conflicts with
faculty," and not understanding
University and departmental
rules.
However, both Germane and
Hamrdla were quick to point out
that the program's participants
do not "counsel" students.
