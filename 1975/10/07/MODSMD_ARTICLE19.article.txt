## Good times at carnival 
### HELEN SCHAWLOW 
A capacity crowd gathered to
samba the night away at the
Bechtel International Center
Saturday night. The occasion
was the annual Brazilian Carnival
complete with band and free
beer.
In Brazil the carnival is seen
as a social leveler and soul
purger, held to celebrate Lent. It
was held this year on the first
Saturday night of the academic
year to kick off the social
season.
A sprinkling of bright
costumes in the sea of blue jeans
added to the festive spirit.
Among those seen were: a
gangster, several South American
planters and peasants, an
Amazon Indian and an Arab
complete with oil can. Said one

participant: "It's a great
opportunity to dress up as a
monster and really be myself."
The decorations, however,
did not succeed in adding to the
atmosphere. They may have
been, in some sense, authentic,
but seemed tasteless and often
sexist. The rooms were adorned
with streamers and banners
spray-painted with such
immortal prose as: "far out,"
"make love" and "get that
woman," as well as Brazilian
sayings. Even less tasteful were
several drawings of bikini-clad
lower female torsos.
A live Brazilian band was
present but most of the music
was recorded. The records were
rather tame and not as exciting
as the live music provided by the

"Viva Brazil" band. Both
represented authentic Brazilian
styles. The guests, however,
clearly prefered the driving
rhythms of "Viva Brazil."
Regretfully, they didn't play
more.
Most of the dancers were
more enthusiastic than expert.
"It's not like a real Brazilian
party. The people don't feel the
music the same way. They are
dancing differently,"
commented Brazilian Jose
Inacio. "I'm not Brazilian but
the atmosphere here makes it so
that anyone can enjoy
themselves freely. The music is
very exciting. The crowd is
really having fun," said Sylvia
Hulz. But what the party lacked
in authenticity it made up for in
good times.

added to the festive spirit.
Among those seen were: a
gangster, several South American
planters and peasants, an
Amazon Indian and an Arab
complete with oil can. Said one

participant: "It's a great
opportunity to dress up as a
monster and really be myself."
The decorations, however,
did not succeed in adding to the
atmosphere. They may have
been, in some sense, authentic,
but seemed tasteless and often
sexist. The rooms were adorned
with streamers and banners
spray-painted with such
immortal prose as: "far out,"
"make love" and "get that
woman," as well as Brazilian
sayings. Even less tasteful were
several drawings of bikini-clad
lower female torsos.
A live Brazilian band was
present but most of the music
was recorded. The records were
rather tame and not as exciting
as the live music provided by the

"Viva Brazil" band. Both
represented authentic Brazilian
styles. The guests, however,
clearly prefered the driving
rhythms of "Viva Brazil."
Regretfully, they didn't play
more.
Most of the dancers were
more enthusiastic than expert.
"It's not like a real Brazilian
party. The people don't feel the
music the same way. They are
dancing differently,"
commented Brazilian Jose
Inacio. "I'm not Brazilian but
the atmosphere here makes it so
that anyone can enjoy
themselves freely. The music is
very exciting. The crowd is
really having fun," said Sylvia
Hulz. But what the party lacked
in authenticity it made up for in
good times.
