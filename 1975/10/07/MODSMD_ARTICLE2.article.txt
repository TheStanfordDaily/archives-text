# Lyman opposes poll

Polling seniors to select the
University's commencement speaker
would create more problems than it
would solve, President Richard Lyman
said yesterday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Lyman said that because
nearly half the degree candidates are
graduate students rather than
undergraduates, such a poll would be
undemocratic.
But even if all graduates were
polled, there would still be the
problem of what to do if the person
invited refused to speak, Lyman said.
Successive invitations are more
easily handled under the existing
system, where the four class officers
and three administrators choose the
speaker, he said.
"There are a great many difficulties
in trying to [select the speaker] with a
plebiscite," Lyman said. Since
"commencement is the most
conspicuous academic event"and the
"University is identified with it in
many minds," it is important to
choose a speaker in the smoothest
possible way, he added.
Frivolous suggestions?
Lyman added that he fears that a
poll would select frivolous speakers
not qualified to address such an
assembly as commencement.
Senior class officers have met with
Lyman and other University officials
in recent weeks to try to persuade
them to conduct a poll, according to
Walt Spevak, senior class president.
Spevak explained that the issue
arose after last year's controversial
selection of U.N. Ambassador Daniel
Patrick Moynihan as commencement
speaker.
Lyman also said that the continued
success of the five-year. $300 million
Campaign for Stanford has not
decreased the University's need to cut
costs.
"The success of the campaign has
been calculated into all of our plans,"
including a five-year, $10 million
budget gap, Lyman said. "So don't
look for solace from that source [the
campaign.]"
Some money in use
He noted that much of the money
raised already is being used. For
example, the campaign has enabled the
University to double its endowed
professorships, he explained.
Lyman also noted that while he is
pleased that the campaign recently
reached the $200 million mark, the

campaign is somewhat behind
schedule.
He predicted that "the last $100
million is bound to be the toughest to
raise," but said it still is likely that it
can be raised before the campaign ends
in April 1977.
In other Campus Conference
remarks, Lyman said that he was not
aware that security agents searched
two campus residences prior to
President Ford's Sept. 21 appearance
on campus.
i didn't know'
"I didn't know that students were
in the houses since they weren't
considered open," Lyman explained.
But Lyman said that he wouldn't
have protested the search if he had
known about it because the Secret
Service didn't have much time to
coordinate its operations.
Lyman added that usually "there
would be a more open and appropriate
way" for the Secret Service to conduct
security checks.
Discussing the recent kidnaping of
three Stanford students at the Gombe
Stream primate research center in
Africa, Lyman said the University is
taking a closer look at security
precautions at all overseas programs.
"The world-wide situation is not
subject to control by any institution,"
Lyman said. "There is no way to
provide absolute safety but the
University would not be justified to
take extraordinary risks. Clearly the
University will have to take this [the
Gombe incident] into consideration in
regulating its overseas programs."
Campus Conference will be aired
this evening at 7 p.m. today on KZSU.
