# Dancing, music in Harmony
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN Second of Two Parts 
(Les Williams is an instructor at Harmony House, headquarters
of the Committee on Black Performing Arts. He has been dancing
and teaching since he was fifteen).
Speaking of what he wants to discuss in his dance class this fall,
Williams says, "Jazz dancing to me is the most popular form of
dance there is today. You see it all the time. The forerunner to
that was what the black people did in their 'part of town' in the
'30s . . . and the '20s like "Walkin' The Dog," "Scratchin' The
Gravel," "Messin' Around" — those dances, even though they were
created prior to the '20s, really got off the ground [ then ].
"Then of course in the '30s and the very late '20s came the
Lindy Hop, the Jitterbug, the Boogie Woogie and many other
similar dances. And that was the jive dance period, when the
dancing was done, as opposed to taps ... in whatever footwear you
had on. It involved a lot of body movement, just as the jazz
dancing of today does."
Jim Shields, musician
Jim Shields, though at 31 much younger than Les Williams, also
has superb qualifications for his job at Harmony House. Primarily a
singer, he began his musical career with the French horn in
third grade.
He was a studio musician in his home town of Detroit for five
years, after which he went to the University of Michigan and then
to Mills College. He has worked with the San Francisco Opera, and
is currently busy in his spare time with a chamber ensemble in
Oakland and an opera company. He came to Stanford after hearing
about the Committee on Black Performing Arts and its director,
John Cochran.
He explains what the Committee does. "The Committee
functions in five aspects — drama, music, dance, photography and
cinematography. Therefore, I'm responsible for the musical aspects
of any production that would involve live music.
"Also, I do my own productions. John Cochran and I have done

two musicals here: We did Purlie in 1974 and Remember When last
year in the summer ... I was music director and he was drama
director.
Sports Conflicts
"In addition to that, on my own, I've done a couple of concerts
of my students' works." His only problem here, Shields admits
with a sly smile, is occasional conflict with the basketball
schedule, when his students' time is divided.
Both Purlie and Remember When were very well-received. His
originality is expressed by his shows — Remember When was
produced in a tent adjacent to Memorial Auditorium. It presented
a variety of unusual technical problems, but Shields — even though
he's an admitted perfectionist—was very satisfied with the result.
His classroom production will be in Dinkelspiel in February. His
ideas will depend on the turnout he gets in the classroom, but he
could not provide any firm details, since rights for the show have
not yet been secured.
He is progressing "with an idea of presenting a theater piece
involving lots of singing, orchestra, possibly smaller instrumental
groups and probably some movement. I don't know if I'd go so far
as to call it dance, but some movement will be involved."
He is teaching two courses — one of which is "Black Music In
America," which spans from pre-civil war music to contemporary
music — "kind of an impossible thing to do," he realizes — with
some emphasis on African influence and the influence of black
music on what we hear today.

John Cochran.
He explains what the Committee does. "The Committee
functions in five aspects — drama, music, dance, photography and
cinematography. Therefore, I'm responsible for the musical aspects
of any production that would involve live music.
"Also, I do my own productions. John Cochran and I have done

two musicals here: We did Purlie in 1974 and Remember When last
year in the summer ... I was music director and he was drama
director.

"In addition to that, on my own, I've done a couple of concerts
of my students' works." His only problem here, Shields admits
with a sly smile, is occasional conflict with the basketball
schedule, when his students' time is divided.
Both Purlie and Remember When were very well-received. His
originality is expressed by his shows — Remember When was
produced in a tent adjacent to Memorial Auditorium. It presented
a variety of unusual technical problems, but Shields — even though
he's an admitted perfectionist—was very satisfied with the result.
His classroom production will be in Dinkelspiel in February. His
ideas will depend on the turnout he gets in the classroom, but he
could not provide any firm details, since rights for the show have
not yet been secured.
He is progressing "with an idea of presenting a theater piece
involving lots of singing, orchestra, possibly smaller instrumental
groups and probably some movement. I don't know if I'd go so far
as to call it dance, but some movement will be involved."
He is teaching two courses — one of which is "Black Music In
America," which spans from pre-civil war music to contemporary
music — "kind of an impossible thing to do," he realizes — with
some emphasis on African influence and the influence of black
music on what we hear today.

(Les Williams is an instructor at Harmony House, headquarters
of the Committee on Black Performing Arts. He has been dancing
and teaching since he was fifteen).
Speaking of what he wants to discuss in his dance class this fall,
Williams says, "Jazz dancing to me is the most popular form of
dance there is today. You see it all the time. The forerunner to
that was what the black people did in their 'part of town' in the
'30s . . . and the '20s like "Walkin' The Dog," "Scratchin' The
Gravel," "Messin' Around" — those dances, even though they were
created prior to the '20s, really got off the ground [ then ].
"Then of course in the '30s and the very late '20s came the
Lindy Hop, the Jitterbug, the Boogie Woogie and many other
similar dances. And that was the jive dance period, when the
dancing was done, as opposed to taps ... in whatever footwear you
had on. It involved a lot of body movement, just as the jazz
dancing of today does."
Jim Shields, musician
Jim Shields, though at 31 much younger than Les Williams, also
has superb qualifications for his job at Harmony House. Primarily a
singer, he began his musical career with the French horn in
third grade.
He was a studio musician in his home town of Detroit for five
years, after which he went to the University of Michigan and then
to Mills College. He has worked with the San Francisco Opera, and
is currently busy in his spare time with a chamber ensemble in
Oakland and an opera company. He came to Stanford after hearing
about the Committee on Black Performing Arts and its director,
John Cochran.
