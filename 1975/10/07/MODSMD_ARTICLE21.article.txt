Only one gun in RFK case
LOS ANGELES — Only one gun was used in the
assassination of Sen. Hubert E. Kennedy in June, 1968, a
panel of firearms experts said in a report yesterday.
The seven ballistics experts said that working
independently they had all arrived at the same conclusion
after examining the bullets taken from the assassination
scene and firing new bullets from convicted assassin
Sirhan B. Sirhan's .22-caliber Iver Johnson revolver.
"We find no substantive evidence to indicate more than
one gun," the experts said in a report read by Superior
Court Judge Robert Wenke.
Sirhan, a Palestinian national, was convicted of the
assassination and is serving a life sentence at San Quentin
prison his original death sentence having been voided by
the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling against capital
punishment.
Since the assassination, however, some people have
believed Sirhan did not act alone, and ballistics experts
who studied photographs have said a second gun was used.
Kansas City strikers, officials meet
KANSAS CITY, Mo. — City officials and striking
firemen agreed yesterday to attend a meeting called by
federal mediators in an attempt to end a four-day-old
walkout by nearly 900 fire fighters.
Charles Shafer, attorney for the firemen, said the union
had scaled down its demands and would be "delighted to
attend the meeting" scheduled for 1 p.m. today.
"We'll be there," said Mayor Charles Wheeler Jr. "I
think they can clarify the legalities of the situation and
thus go a long way towards getting the firemen back to
work."
The mayor said earlier the city would not negotiate
until firemen end the strike, which the city claims is illegal
under state law.
Hearst lawyer quits case
SAN FRANCISCO — Terence Hallinan, a radical
attorney who had represented Patricia Hearst since the
day of her arrest, withdrew from the case yesterday after

an apparent dispute within the defense ranks.
Meanwhile, a federal judge postponed indefinitely a
hearing on the newspaper heiress's mental condition and a
judge in Los Angeles ordered her to appear to answer 11
state felony charges.
Reprisal killings plague Madrid
MADRID, Spain — Gunmen thought to be extreme
rightists machine-gunned to death the Basque owner of a
bar in northern Spain as quick reprisal killings appeared to
mark the country's escalating political violence.
Premier Carlos Arias Navarro met with his cabinet in
emergency session for more than four hours yesterday
after the late Sunday attack, apparently done in
retaliation for the bombing deaths of three civil
guardsmen.
There was no immediate word on any initiatives to
curb the political violence that has taken seven lives in five
days and more than 50 lives since January 1971.
Dallas beats Detroit 36-10
PONTIAC, Mich. — Charles Young bolted over for a
one-yard touchdown that put Dallas ahead, then made a
juggling fingertip catch of a 42-yard touchdown pass that
triggered a Roger Staubach aerial show which led the
Cowboys to a 36-10 victory over the Detroit Lions last
night.
The triumph in the nationally televised game kept the
surprisingly balanced Cowboys unbeaten through the first
three weeks of the National Football League campaign.
And it handed the Lions their first defeat of the year,
tarnishing their regular-season debut in their magnificent
new dome-covered Pontiac Stadium home.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today. Chance of rain tonight and
Wednesday. Continued cool. Lows both nights in the 50s.
High today and tomorrow in the 60s to low 70s. Westerly
wind 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 10 percent today and
30 percent tonight.

Only one gun in RFK case
LOS ANGELES — Only one gun was used in the
assassination of Sen. Hubert E. Kennedy in June, 1968, a
panel of firearms experts said in a report yesterday.
The seven ballistics experts said that working
independently they had all arrived at the same conclusion
after examining the bullets taken from the assassination
scene and firing new bullets from convicted assassin
Sirhan B. Sirhan's .22-caliber Iver Johnson revolver.
"We find no substantive evidence to indicate more than
one gun," the experts said in a report read by Superior
Court Judge Robert Wenke.
Sirhan, a Palestinian national, was convicted of the
assassination and is serving a life sentence at San Quentin
prison his original death sentence having been voided by
the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling against capital
punishment.
Since the assassination, however, some people have
believed Sirhan did not act alone, and ballistics experts
who studied photographs have said a second gun was used.
Kansas City strikers, officials meet
KANSAS CITY, Mo. — City officials and striking
firemen agreed yesterday to attend a meeting called by
federal mediators in an attempt to end a four-day-old
walkout by nearly 900 fire fighters.
Charles Shafer, attorney for the firemen, said the union
had scaled down its demands and would be "delighted to
attend the meeting" scheduled for 1 p.m. today.
"We'll be there," said Mayor Charles Wheeler Jr. "I
think they can clarify the legalities of the situation and
thus go a long way towards getting the firemen back to
work."
The mayor said earlier the city would not negotiate
until firemen end the strike, which the city claims is illegal
under state law.
Hearst lawyer quits case
SAN FRANCISCO — Terence Hallinan, a radical
attorney who had represented Patricia Hearst since the
day of her arrest, withdrew from the case yesterday after

an apparent dispute within the defense ranks.
Meanwhile, a federal judge postponed indefinitely a
hearing on the newspaper heiress's mental condition and a
judge in Los Angeles ordered her to appear to answer 11
state felony charges.
Reprisal killings plague Madrid
MADRID, Spain — Gunmen thought to be extreme
rightists machine-gunned to death the Basque owner of a
bar in northern Spain as quick reprisal killings appeared to
mark the country's escalating political violence.
Premier Carlos Arias Navarro met with his cabinet in
emergency session for more than four hours yesterday
after the late Sunday attack, apparently done in
retaliation for the bombing deaths of three civil
guardsmen.
There was no immediate word on any initiatives to
curb the political violence that has taken seven lives in five
days and more than 50 lives since January 1971.
Dallas beats Detroit 36-10
PONTIAC, Mich. — Charles Young bolted over for a
one-yard touchdown that put Dallas ahead, then made a
juggling fingertip catch of a 42-yard touchdown pass that
triggered a Roger Staubach aerial show which led the
Cowboys to a 36-10 victory over the Detroit Lions last
night.
The triumph in the nationally televised game kept the
surprisingly balanced Cowboys unbeaten through the first
three weeks of the National Football League campaign.
And it handed the Lions their first defeat of the year,
tarnishing their regular-season debut in their magnificent
new dome-covered Pontiac Stadium home.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today. Chance of rain tonight and
Wednesday. Continued cool. Lows both nights in the 50s.
High today and tomorrow in the 60s to low 70s. Westerly
wind 10 to 20 mph. Chance of rain 10 percent today and
30 percent tonight.
