# Employers' criteria studied

By MICHAEL SCOTT
If you're a college graduate who has
niajored in business or engineering,
and if you appear for a job interview
with neatly trimmed hair, wearing a
suit and creating a "relaxed, balanced,
and professional" impression, your
chances of joining the ranks of
America's white collar workers are
better than average.
So reports a survey made by Jane
Anton and Michael Russell, who
received their doctoral degrees here in
June.
The pair made the study for the
Western College Placement
Association, of which Stanford is a
member.
They received replies from more
than 100 recruiting officers from 17
different industry groups, ranging
from accounting and aerospace to
government and utilities.
The study found that recruiters'
top priorities in selecting prospective
employes were the candidate's major
field of study and academic

performance, followed by
extracurricular activities, academic
activities and awards, type of college
or university attended,
recommendations from faculty or
school officials and test scores.
According to Russell, there have
been many studies aimed at showing
college undergraduates what kinds of
job opportunities are available, but
this "is the first study looking at what
companies are after."
He added that the survey is
"primarily directed towards

undergraduates. It was designed to
help the freshman or sophomore
concerned about his or her future
employability."
The survey showed business and
engineering majors received the highest
rankings in the choice of applicants. In
the liberal arts, only communications
majors received a positive rating from
a majority of employer groups.
Fine arts and humanities received
no "positive" ratings, while education
and ethnic studies received only two
"slightly positive" ratings.
