# Energy costs cut

Weeks added "We've prioritized all
the buildings on campus. We wouldn't
shut down the fans in the Education
Research and Development Building
for even 10 minutes, because that
would make the fourth floor heat up

unbearably. But that long a shutdown
in the Graduate School of Business
would have hardly any temperature
change."
"The computer can also reduce the
electricity costs for lighting,"
McKnight said. "But most buildings
don't have the controls necessary for
this, so we could only introduce this in
a few years as a follow-up system."
Gas usage will also be reduced,
McKnight added. A small weather
station will be mounted on the roof of
the power plant, transmitting
information to the computer about
wind velocity, temperature and
sunshine.
"We'll be able to do power
management this way," McKnight
said. "For example, if it warms up
during the day, we can send less heat
to the History Corner. Individual
zones won't be automated, though.
Within buildings, all controls will still
remain active.
