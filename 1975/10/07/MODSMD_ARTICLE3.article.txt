# Ford offers tax cut; congressmen leery
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford proposed yesterday $28 billion
in permanent tax cuts to take effect in
the 1976 election year — but only if
Congress agrees to cut federal spending
an equal amount.
The plan drew fire from two
powerful Democratic House
committee chairmen who said they are
developing alternative tax cut
recommendations.
Of the cuts in Ford's proposal,
$20.7 billion would be for individuals
and $7 billion for business. Reductions
for individuals would be about $4
billion more than relief from the 1975
tax rebates and reductions.
The House Ways and Means
Committee is to begin its discussions
on tax cut proposals on Tuesday, and
Chairman A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.) said last
night that the committee drafts likely

will bear little resemblance to Ford's.
He said that depending on which of
the staff-drawn alternatives are
adopted, tax reductions for next year
could range from $8 billion to $12
billion — extending the eight-month,
$8 billion tax cut put into effect this
year.
CBS, NBC decline
The President's address, delivered
from the Oval Office, was televised live
on ABC, but CBS and NBC declined,
citing equal time regulations regarding
presidential candidates.
In his speech, Ford insisted the tax
reductions "be tied together in one
package" with a federal spending
ceiling of $395 billion for the 1977
fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.
"It would be dangerous and
irresponsible to adopt one without the
other," Ford said. He said the actions
would be a "first step . .. toward
balancing the federal budget within
three years."
Hugh Scott (R-Pa.), the Senate
minority leader, said Congress "can
earn this reduction for the taxpayers
by accepting the fact that spending his
got to be curtailed. Otherwise, a tax
reduction bill is a candidate for veto."
Simon threat
Treasury Secretary William Simon
told reporters Ford would veto a tax
reduction bill for 1976 if Congress
failed to also agree to the $395 million
spending ceiling.
Ford said that without reductions
in federal spending, the spending in
fiscal year 1977 could easily total
more than $420 billion without adding

a single new federal program.
He said he will propose specific
spending reductions to Congress in
January.
Ford said his tax cut proposals
would permanently reduce taxes for a
family of four with a $14,000 annual
income by $412, or 27 percent from
1974 rates. Compared with the
reduced 1976 tax rate, the reduction
would be less.
1975 reductions expire
The 1975 tax reductions would
expire Dec. 31 unless action is taken
to extend them.
Ford called on Congress to raise the
personal tax exemption for all
taxpayers to $1000 from $750, to
lower personal income tax rates and to
make the standard deduction for single
taxpayers $1800 and for married
couples, $2500.
Ford told his nationwide audience
"there are encouraging signs that we
have weathered the worst" of the
1974-75 recession. But he said
Americans "must recognize that just
beneath the surface there are still
deep-seated problems in our economy
problems that have been building up
over the years and will not quickly or
easily disappear."
He cited mounting federal spending
that claims an ever larger share of
individual incomes while creating
record budget deficits and inflation.
Arguing that much of the nation's
inflation should be labeled "Made in
Washington, D.C.," Ford contended
that "excesses have played a major role
driving up prices, driving up interest
rates and holding down jobs."

told reporters Ford would veto a tax
reduction bill for 1976 if Congress
failed to also agree to the $395 million
spending ceiling.
Ford said that without reductions
in federal spending, the spending in
fiscal year 1977 could easily total
more than $420 billion without adding

a single new federal program.
He said he will propose specific
spending reductions to Congress in
January.
Ford said his tax cut proposals
would permanently reduce taxes for a
family of four with a $14,000 annual
income by $412, or 27 percent from
1974 rates. Compared with the
reduced 1976 tax rate, the reduction
would be less.
1975 reductions expire
The 1975 tax reductions would
expire Dec. 31 unless action is taken
to extend them.
Ford called on Congress to raise the
personal tax exemption for all
taxpayers to $1000 from $750, to
lower personal income tax rates and to
make the standard deduction for single
taxpayers $1800 and for married
couples, $2500.
Ford told his nationwide audience
"there are encouraging signs that we
have weathered the worst" of the
1974-75 recession. But he said
Americans "must recognize that just
beneath the surface there are still
deep-seated problems in our economy
problems that have been building up
over the years and will not quickly or
easily disappear."
He cited mounting federal spending
that claims an ever larger share of
individual incomes while creating
record budget deficits and inflation.
Arguing that much of the nation's
inflation should be labeled "Made in
Washington, D.C.," Ford contended
that "excesses have played a major role
driving up prices, driving up interest
rates and holding down jobs."
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford proposed yesterday $28 billion
in permanent tax cuts to take effect in
the 1976 election year — but only if
Congress agrees to cut federal spending
an equal amount.
The plan drew fire from two
powerful Democratic House
committee chairmen who said they are
developing alternative tax cut
recommendations.
Of the cuts in Ford's proposal,
$20.7 billion would be for individuals
and $7 billion for business. Reductions
for individuals would be about $4
billion more than relief from the 1975
tax rebates and reductions.
The House Ways and Means
Committee is to begin its discussions
on tax cut proposals on Tuesday, and
Chairman A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.) said last
night that the committee drafts likely

will bear little resemblance to Ford's.
He said that depending on which of
the staff-drawn alternatives are
adopted, tax reductions for next year
could range from $8 billion to $12
billion — extending the eight-month,
$8 billion tax cut put into effect this
year.
CBS, NBC decline
The President's address, delivered
from the Oval Office, was televised live
on ABC, but CBS and NBC declined,
citing equal time regulations regarding
presidential candidates.
In his speech, Ford insisted the tax
reductions "be tied together in one
package" with a federal spending
ceiling of $395 billion for the 1977
fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.
"It would be dangerous and
irresponsible to adopt one without the
other," Ford said. He said the actions
would be a "first step . .. toward
balancing the federal budget within
three years."
Hugh Scott (R-Pa.), the Senate
minority leader, said Congress "can
earn this reduction for the taxpayers
by accepting the fact that spending his
got to be curtailed. Otherwise, a tax
reduction bill is a candidate for veto."
