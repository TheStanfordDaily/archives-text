# 'Pay its costs back in nine months'
## Computer cuts energy costs 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
A new plant services computer will slow the rise in the
University's energy costs, according to Plant
Superintendent Warren Weeks.
The computer, an IBM System Seven, was installed
Sept. 22. "The computer cost us $40,000," Jason Mavis,
director of plant services, said. "We estimate it will pay its
cost back in nine months or less."
"Energy operations are pretty efficient now," Weeks
said, "but this computer should optimize everything. I'd
say a conservative estimate of the savings would be around
10 percent."
Mavis said that energy costs are rising sharply. "In just
August the University's cost for gas went up 46 percent,
and the electrical rates 21 percent."
Weeks says he expects gas and electricity costs "to
double in the next few years," raising the University's
energy budget well above its present $3.1 million figure.

Utilities Manager Robert McKnight said the computer
will cut electricity costs in two ways. "The utility
company bills us for our total usage — which is what most
people are familiar with —and for our peak demand.
"When we suddenly use a lot of electricity, that puts a
strain on them. So they look at the half hour per month
that we used the most electricity, and slap on a peak
demand charge for that. That charge is now $2.53 per
kilowatt.
"Now the computer will keep track of how much
energy the entire campus is using. When we seem to be
exceeding the previous peak demand, the computer shuts
off non-critical items.
"This doesn't mean elevators, lighting or environmental
boxes," McKnight pointed out. "There are several
hundred kilowatts we can cut down on within the Plant
Department, and the rest would probably come in fan
units."
