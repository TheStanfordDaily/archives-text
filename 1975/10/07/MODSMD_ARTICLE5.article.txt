# University increases student employment
## 
### BOB BARKER 
"Job-wise, we're probably in
better shape now than any other
time in recent years," says
Financial Aid Director Robert P.
Huff.
The University expects to
employ some 1700 undergraduates
this year, including 300 in federally
funded work-study jobs and 1400
in self-help programs. Huff calls this
a "significant increase" over last
year's figures.
He attributes the increase to a
memorandum he and Vice Provost
Ray Bacchetti distributed to
campus departments last spring.
The letter reminded the
departments that all jobs open to
students and paying more than $50
per year must be registered with the
Financial Aids Office. Huff says he
and Bacchetti received a "good
response" to the memorandum. He
adds that although most student
employment continues to be in
"service type jobs such as hashing
the library work," there are not
only "more jobs, but more
interesting jobs as well."
The policy of registering jobs
does not mean that students
granted financial aid receive jobs
automatically, Huff says. "We refer
them to the department, and the
department makes the decision."
The "more interesting"
University jobs include working
with special collections in the
Hoover Library and assisting
faculty in research projects.
Huff says he "doesn't like the
connotations that we're forcing
students [who are not on financial
aid ] out of jobs. First crack at jobs
goes to students on aid because we
have made a commitment to these
students. The end result will be that

more students on aid will receive
campus jobs .. . obviously we will
never be able to fill every job. For
instance, if a department places a
request for a programmer, we may
not have anybody with that
particular skill. If we can't fill it,
then we refer the job to the
placement office where any student
may apply for the position."
Huff says he has a
"responsibility" to monitor wage
rates. This [student employment]
is a student aid source and naturally
we want it to do as well as it can."
In the past wages have been raised
the same percentage as staff salaries
in an effort to match the rate of
inflation, he says.

The challenges of inflation,
depreciation of endowment funds
and attrition of University reserves
can be met, Huff claims. His
strategy to meet the rising cost of
attending Stanford and the
increasing need for financial
assistance calls for soliciting funds
from a number of sources,
"beginning outside of the
University itself."
With the exception of
government insured student loans,
the Basic Education Opportunity
Grant (BEOG) program is the
largest single source of scholarship
money in the United States and it
continues to grow.
Three years ago 78 Stanford
students received a total of $20,000

in BEOGs. This year 265 students
were awarded a total of $250,000
in such aid. Next year the figures
should double, Huff says.
"I wouldn't be surprised if in
three years every student whose
parents' income is under $15,000
received a BEOG, he adds. Some
$125,000 in additional funds may
also be coming from Washington to
expand community service oriented
work-study, such as tutoring.
More help may also come from
the states, as Gov. Edmund G.
Brown Jr. signed legislation late last
month which increases the
maximum California State
Scholarship from $2500 to $2900,
Huff says.
But Huff calls private
endowments the best source of
support. "We do prefer
endowments, of course, because we
can generally use the appreciation
besides the interest earned." A
half-million dollar raise over last
year in general funds from the
University and the $55 million
earmarked for financial aid from
the Campaign for Stanford should
also help to relieve the pinch of
tight finances, he says.
Direct grants increasing
While direct grants are increasing
— 75 percent of all aid is in the
form of outright gifts — the amount
of self-help will also be going up.
Huff says that from greater
self-help, usually offered in a
package divided equally between
workstudy and student loans, two
important questions arise:
—How much can students be
expected to borrow?
—How much can parents be
expected to contribute?
Resolving these two questions is
among Huff's main concerns.
