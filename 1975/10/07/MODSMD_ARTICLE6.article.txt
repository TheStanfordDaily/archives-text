## SB1: Dangerous 
### 
Apparently still shaken by the civil disorders the
nation witnessed during the Vietnam War, a coalition of
U.S. Senate liberals and conservatives has sponsored
Senate Bill 1, a measure which, if passed, could do more
to muzzle dissent than any legislation since the Alien and
Sedition Acts of 1798.
The 753-page bill has ambitious aims. It attempts to
give the federal government a heavy hand in preventing
demonstrations and publication of secret documents.
In order to silence protesters, S.B. 1 would outlaw
demonstrations near the President and those interfering
with traffic. Picketing of government buildings would be
made illegal. Dissident groups would thus be denied the
chance to emphasize their views by assembling in the
streets.
Trying to preclude another Pentagon Papers incident,
the bill would provide prison terms of up to seven years
for bureaucrats or politicians who leak secret documents.
Reporters and publishers who revealed such documents
would receive the same prison sentence as their sources.
Although we acknowledge that any government must
have secrets, we oppose any legislation which proscribes
publication of any classified documents simply because
they might embarrass public officials.
One of the bill's most frightening aspects is its
vagueness. It outlaws "incitement" of persons to engage
in conduct "that then or at some future time" would
facilitate the government's destruction. Such an
ambiguous phrase could easily give the government a
carte blanche in prosecuting its opponents.
S.B. 1 also vaguely states that anyone caught
"tampering with" military installations to obstruct the
ability of the nation to engage in war would be liable to a
series of penalties ranging to death. While the government
has a legitimate interest in protecting its military
establishments, the exact definition of "tampering with"
is not clear and needs to be clarified.
In another provision that would do justice to the late
j. Edgar Hoover, the bill reaffirms the government's
ability to conduct domestic wiretapping. S.B. 1 would
allow the government to conduct bugging for up to 48
hours without a court order. Landlords and telephone
companies would be forced to cooperate.
Apparently, the recent revelations about FBI and CIA
wiretaps have taught the bill's sponsors nothing.
One of the motivations behind the bill was the desire
to codify the federal government's policy on civil
disorder. We agree that there is a need for such standards
to a codification, but we believe that this could be done
more effectively in a series of acts over a long period of
time rather than in one huge, unwieldly bill.
The proposed legislation is so long and complex that it
will be virtually impossible for the Senate or the public to
conduct a careful and reasoned discussion of its
provisions. There is a danger that many moderate
senators will fail to perceive its dangers. Indeed, it already
has been suggested by The Nation magazine that Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield co-sponsored the legislation
unaware of provisions that later bothered him.
We hope that the bill's attempts to silence dissent will
bother more senators â€” enough to defeat this dangerous
measure.
