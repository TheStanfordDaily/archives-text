# Cost cuts: Survival of the fittest
## 
### William Ross 
Imagine the chagrin of a
freshman who has entered a
college with a good reputation
only to discover that the
department in which he has
chosen to study is mediocre.
Such a freshman is indeed
unfortunate, for the quality of a
university education ultimately
depends far more on the
academic strength of the
departments in which one
studies rather than on the
university's overall prestige.
Purdue, for example, offers
fine training in engineering, but
it is no place to study English.
Williams may be good in English,
but it would disappoint an
aspiring engineer.
Fortunately for Stanford
students, the University
administration has recognized
the importance of maintaining
departmental strength in its
efforts to cut costs in the face of
an estimated budget deficit of
$1.6 million for 1975-76.
Killing the weak
Its decision last summer to
eliminate its poorly financed
Architecture Department is
evidence that the University is
trying to maintain good
departments at their current
strength while killing off weak
ones.
This policy is nothing new.
As Raymond Bacchetti, vice
provost for budget and planning,
has pointed out, the quality of
the University's programs was
maintained during the 1969-74
$6 million Budget Readjustment
Program (BAP) by eliminating
speech instruction and nuclear
engineering altogether.
And Arthur Bienenstock, vice
provost for faculty affairs,
foreshadowed the Architecture
Department's cut in a Daily
interview last November.
"If I could, I would single out
weak and peripheral programs
for the deepest cuts,"
Bienenstock said, "In order to
attract the best faculty we must
show them the best.
"This University has no
reason for survival if it can't
keep its best departments strong
and it knows it."
The elimination of
architecture caused some people
to criticize the administration
for weakening the University by

destroying a program that could
perhaps be built up during
economically better days.
Spread too thin
But the administration's
critics are at a loss to explain
what other cost slashes the
University might have made.
They fail to recognize the
dangers of a University spreading
itself too thin by remaining
burdened with programs that
aren't worth supporting.
There is, of course,
potentially one major problem
with the University's policy:
what happens if after cutting all
the weak programs the
University finds that it still must
make budget cuts? Will we have
the absurd spectacle of the
administration examining the
latest department ratings of the
American Council of Education
and cutting those departments
which aren't quite as prestigious
as others?
The Columbia University
Spectator said in an editorial late

last month that "most
[Columbia] university officers
feel they have made all the cuts
they can without deeply
harming the quality of their
operations. In an otherwise
fragmented university, this is the
one universal theme: 'there is no
place left to cut.' "
But Stanford has not yet
reached this point. The
Campaign for Stanford is on
schedule and monthly donations
are reaching new highs.
Although the administration is
reluctant to tell how much
money it lost during what
President Richard Lyman always

calls "the stock market
collapse," it is clear that the
University fared far better than
many other schools.
The University of Rochester,
for example, lost more than half
its endowment; Yale,
one-fourth. Stanford's loss did
not approach these proportions,
and much if not all has been
regained since stock prices began
to climb.
It therefore appears that
despite the gravity of the
University's money woes, it will
not have to decide what to do
after it has eliminated its poorer
programs.
Maybe it's even a good thing
for the University to get rid of
its weak spots. Now at least
there is no danger of a freshman
interested in architecture
arriving here and finding that his
department is lousy.
