Who is rational?
Editor:
Tim Ferguson wrote about
the hollowness of the
philosophical foundations of
conservatism (Daily, Oct. 2).
According to his authority —
Edith Efron — it is based on
such abstractions as God, Duty,
and so on, never derived in any
rational way.
How true. But what about
Efron's "primacy of the
individual mind, its right to
self-assertion. ... its right to
destroy order . . ." Are these not
abstractions? Are they derived in
a rational way?
Persons without beliefs based
on abstractions are
opportunists, like Richard
Nixon's young men. We should
be glad that most of us believe in
abstractions like justice and
compassion.
The real questions are not
about the "primacy of the
individual mind" versus the
"primacy of the organic
community," but about the
desirable balance between
freedom and restraint.
