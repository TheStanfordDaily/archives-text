Toyo-View
Demonstration
The masters of photography have always needed a
photographic system that would allow the full expres
sion of their creativity. Their choice since photog
raphy's infancy has been the view camera, for in spite
of the tremendous technological advances made in
the field of photography since Alfred Steiglitz started
taking pictures of the New York skyline through his
apartment window, no system has ever been devel
oped that can do the things a view camera is capable
of doing.
The Toyo View is designed to take full advantage of
the unique capabilities of large format photography.
Its only limitation is your own imagination.
