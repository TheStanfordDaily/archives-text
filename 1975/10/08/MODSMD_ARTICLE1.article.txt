# Girl spots exhibitionist near Quad
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Police cordoned oft' the Geology
Corner of the Quad yesterday
afternoon in a futile search for an
exhibitionist who had reportedly
taken flight there after exposing
himself near Memorial Church.
According to Capt. Raoul K.
Niemeyer of the Stanford Police
Dept., an unknown girl "who we
would like to come forward so we
can complete the report" observed
the man masturbating in the bushes
near the Round Room of the Church.
She told someone in the Round
Room of the incident, and the police
were then called.
Four police vehicles remained on
the scene for about an hour,
searching each room of the Geology
Corner, but abandoned the effort
when it became clear the man was
not there.
Reports described the man as
blond Caucasian in his early 20's of
medium build and wearing a yellow
shirt (or jacket) and brown pants.
The incident yesterday was the
latest in what Niemeyer termed a
"rash" of indecent exposures around
the campus, as well as other
disturbances. Last week, a man of the
same description attacked a girl on
Palm Drive, knocking her off her bike
and then running away.
"He's believed to be a
non-student," said Niemeyer, "and
also mentally ill. Most crimes of this
nature are committed by
non-students."
Other reported incidents included
the sighting of a nude, green-capped
man early last Saturday morning on
Mayfield Avenue. Witnesses also
reported seeing a Peeping Tom
peering into a female student's dorm
window last week.
The green-capped man was
described as being 5' 10", 170 lbs.,
and having a dark moustache, "so we
know it's not all one man," said
Neimeyer.
"We just want to alert incoming
students, especially women, that
these problems do exist, and call
their attention to the [Arlis Perry]
murder in the church last October. I
don't want to strike fear into
anyone's hearts, but there are a lot of
strange and dangerous people running
around," he said.
The police are still interested in
information on the Perry slaying
almost a year later, he added. They
have followed up leads from as far
away as Germany and have talked to
around 200 people.
