# Buckley eschews freedom

First of two parts
In his Oct. 3 speech here, William F. Buckley
delivered a subtle ridicule of the political
thought of F.A. Hayek.
While Buckley finds much of the negative
aspects of Hayek's view appealing — namely
wherever Hayek shows up socialist ideology for
the foolishness that it is — he is disdainful
toward Hayek's affirmative case for the free
society.
Buckley accurately labels Hayek's political
thought libertarianism. Libertarianism,
consistently held, construes the government of a
society at best a hired service agent, providing
national defense, courts and police (for a price
voluntarily paid) — the only activities needed to
secure the general, common good, namely liberty.
Hayek's case for this kind of social order,
granted his inconsistent characterization of it,
rests on a complicated argument which
completely eschews moral judgments.
Because of the amoralist argument for
libertarian political principles, Hayek is, of
course, the target of conservatives such as
Buckley and Alexandr Solzhenitsyn.
Indeed, Hayek is, in this amoralism, not very
different from an intellectual tradition he
himself has criticized for many decades,
positivist social science.
But Buckley did not simply criticize Hayek's
case for libertarianism and its highest political
value, human political liberty. Buckley indicted
that libertarian theory itself.
In this he came not to praise liberty but to
find its shortcomings. Witness his lamentations
on the institution of free speech, as exhibited
by Penthouse and Mrs. Ford. Instead of
admitting that American conservatives, who have
given some liberty lip service for a century,
simply haven't the arguments needed to
overcome the Marxist^Leninist-Maoist

comprehensive, albeit invalid, political
philosophy, Buckley chose to decry the liberty
of Marxists, et al., to advocate evil creeds.
What Buckley failed to tell us is that
libertarianism does have a case that meets all of
the necessary and sufficient ingredients for a
moral and political theory. He did not tell his
audience that Hayek is but one, social theorist
turned economist, advocate of the free market.
He did not tell us that a normative case for the
free society has been advanced, touching all
necessary bases on the philosophical terrain.
Why did Buckley choose to evade the case
for liberty that has the moral ingredients he so
conveniently found lacking in Hayek's position?
Because Buckley, a conservative theist, did
not think it wise to tell his audience that
conservative theism is not the only value-laden
alternative to communism.
What kind of morality do we find in
conservative theism? We get a clue by
considering the view of human nature that is
advocated by conservative theists like Buckley,
Russell Kirk, et al. They view human beings as
necessarily base.
They take us all to be afflicted with original
sin fiom which only their conservative creed can
free us. They view us all as inclined, by nature,
toward evil. And they then advocate as the
proper virtues for us all to cultivate: humility,
charity, self-abasement.
No wonder. If we are indeed base at the
core, is it not more decent for us all to suppress
ourselves, debase the human self that we are? If
we incline toward sin, should we not, intelligent
beings that we are to know it, force upon
ourselves the character which takes humility for
its moral inspiration?
