# Poll seniors for commencement speaker
## 
### Stephen Carter 
So President Lyman has
decided that once again,
students in general need have
no voice in selecting the
University's commencement
speaker.
On Campus Conference
Monday, Lyman rejected what
he termed "a plebiscite."
Rather, he argued that a
commencement speaker should
be selected in what he termed
the smoothest possible way.
He pointed out, quite
rightly, that the top choice

could simply refuse to attend,
and implied that this would
cause serious problems. But
these problems, in Lyman's
conception, would be overcome
by the current system, wherein
the four senior class officers
and three administrators choose
the speaker.
Not only is this argument
facile and inconsistent, but it
fails in any significant degree to
address the criticisms set forth
last year following the
invitation to then-Harvard Prof.
Daniel P. Moynihan to speak at
commencement.
The Lyman system — the
current system — presumably
allows this committee to vote
on a speaker, and invite her or
him. If the speaker declines,
there is no real problem — the
committee could simply vote
again. And again. All in the
privacy of the committee room.
Suppose, on the other hand,
that Stanford allows students to
vote on a commencement
speaker. The top vote-getter
might turn down the invitation.
Then the next highest
vote-getter would be invited —
no more votes, no committee
meeting, no problem. But for
an administration as hopelessly
steeped in committeeism as is
ours, such an obvious
consideration may be
blasphemy.
Moreover, if Lyman truly
desired the "smoothest" process i
of selecting a speaker, he could
select the speaker himself. Or
he could appoint a Vice
President for Commencement
to make the selection.
Views represented?
Another problem arises from
the administration's bland
assurances last year that the
senior class officers were
expected to represent the views
of seniors. Presumably, the
officers would have to take a
poll, formal or informal, to gain
an insight into seniors' views,
and if the administrators are
being intellectually honest, they
must realize this.
Would Lyman's "smoothest
system" then demand that the
officers take a new poll each
time a speaker declined an
invitation? Or does this border

too closely on the feared
"plebiscite"?
But suppose Lyman's system
— the current one, remember —
passed all of these reasonably
straightforward tests. It would
still fail to meet the more
complex but more deeply
rooted objections raised to
Moynihan's selection.
Certainly, seniors were not
consulted — no one carries on
that charade any longer. But
possibly more to the point,
Stanford's sizeable Third World
community, which not only
opposed Moynihan's selection,
but must have felt frankly
offended by it, was never
consulted — probably never
considered.
Not all opponents
The argument is not that all
possible opponents of all
controversial speakers need
always be consulted. But the
selection committee presumably
looked into Moynihan's
background. In doing so, it
must have discovered (if it was
not already aware) this pattern
of consistent Third World
opposition to him.
The committee then had, at
the very least, an intellectual
responsibility to consult this
community, to try to
understand the reasons for the
opposition. Certainly this alone
should not have been reason
enough to deny Moynihan his
golden forum; but the
committee might have decided
to reconsider.
Vice President for University
Affairs Robert W. Rosenzweig
argued Moynihan had been
selected largely because he was
a great scholar. Here again, the
committee should have
discovered how controversial
many of his theories were, and
consulted people likely to
understand and to hold strong

opinions. And here again, the
invitation might not have been
withdrawn — but it might have
been reconsidered in the light
of such serious opposition.
But Lyman insists on
defending the system that
perpetrated such nonsense. It
worked smoothly, all right, but
it worked badly. There is no
reason why the same mistakes
as last year cannot be repeated
— except, of course, for the
vigilance of the senior class
officers.
But even this is a touchy
question. A recalcitrant and
jealous — or so it seems —
administration can thwart the
best of intentions. In any event,
this year's officers can offer no
guarantee for the openness of
the selection process in the
future.
Such a guarantee only the
University can grant. But the
University, for reasons best
known only to itself, refuses to
learn from past mistakes.

selection committee presumably
looked into Moynihan's
background. In doing so, it
must have discovered (if it was
not already aware) this pattern
of consistent Third World
opposition to him.
The committee then had, at
the very least, an intellectual
responsibility to consult this
community, to try to
understand the reasons for the
opposition. Certainly this alone
should not have been reason
enough to deny Moynihan his
golden forum; but the
committee might have decided
to reconsider.
Vice President for University
Affairs Robert W. Rosenzweig
argued Moynihan had been
selected largely because he was
a great scholar. Here again, the
committee should have
discovered how controversial
many of his theories were, and
consulted people likely to
understand and to hold strong

opinions. And here again, the
invitation might not have been
withdrawn — but it might have
been reconsidered in the light
of such serious opposition.
But Lyman insists on
defending the system that
perpetrated such nonsense. It
worked smoothly, all right, but
it worked badly. There is no
reason why the same mistakes
as last year cannot be repeated
— except, of course, for the
vigilance of the senior class
officers.
But even this is a touchy
question. A recalcitrant and
jealous — or so it seems —
administration can thwart the
best of intentions. In any event,
this year's officers can offer no
guarantee for the openness of
the selection process in the
future.
Such a guarantee only the
University can grant. But the
University, for reasons best
known only to itself, refuses to
learn from past mistakes.

So President Lyman has
decided that once again,
students in general need have
no voice in selecting the
University's commencement
speaker.
On Campus Conference
Monday, Lyman rejected what
he termed "a plebiscite."
Rather, he argued that a
commencement speaker should
be selected in what he termed
the smoothest possible way.
He pointed out, quite
rightly, that the top choice

could simply refuse to attend,
and implied that this would
cause serious problems. But
these problems, in Lyman's
conception, would be overcome
by the current system, wherein
the four senior class officers
and three administrators choose
the speaker.
Not only is this argument
facile and inconsistent, but it
fails in any significant degree to
address the criticisms set forth
last year following the
invitation to then-Harvard Prof.
Daniel P. Moynihan to speak at
commencement.
The Lyman system — the
current system — presumably
allows this committee to vote
on a speaker, and invite her or
him. If the speaker declines,
there is no real problem — the
committee could simply vote
again. And again. All in the
privacy of the committee room.
Suppose, on the other hand,
that Stanford allows students to
vote on a commencement
speaker. The top vote-getter
might turn down the invitation.
Then the next highest
vote-getter would be invited —
no more votes, no committee
meeting, no problem. But for
an administration as hopelessly
steeped in committeeism as is
ours, such an obvious
consideration may be
blasphemy.
Moreover, if Lyman truly
desired the "smoothest" process i
of selecting a speaker, he could
select the speaker himself. Or
he could appoint a Vice
President for Commencement
to make the selection.
Views represented?
Another problem arises from
the administration's bland
assurances last year that the
senior class officers were
expected to represent the views
of seniors. Presumably, the
officers would have to take a
poll, formal or informal, to gain
an insight into seniors' views,
and if the administrators are
being intellectually honest, they
must realize this.
Would Lyman's "smoothest
system" then demand that the
officers take a new poll each
time a speaker declined an
invitation? Or does this border

too closely on the feared
"plebiscite"?
But suppose Lyman's system
— the current one, remember —
passed all of these reasonably
straightforward tests. It would
still fail to meet the more
complex but more deeply
rooted objections raised to
Moynihan's selection.
Certainly, seniors were not
consulted — no one carries on
that charade any longer. But
possibly more to the point,
Stanford's sizeable Third World
community, which not only
opposed Moynihan's selection,
but must have felt frankly
offended by it, was never
consulted — probably never
considered.
Not all opponents
The argument is not that all
possible opponents of all
controversial speakers need
always be consulted. But the

background. In doing so, it

speaker. The top vote-getter
might turn down the invitation.
Then the next highest
vote-getter would be invited —
no more votes, no committee
meeting, no problem. But for
an administration as hopelessly
steeped in committeeism as is
ours, such an obvious
consideration may be
blasphemy.
Moreover, if Lyman truly
desired the "smoothest" process i
of selecting a speaker, he could
select the speaker himself. Or
he could appoint a Vice
President for Commencement
to make the selection.
Views represented?
Another problem arises from
the administration's bland
assurances last year that the
senior class officers were
expected to represent the views
of seniors. Presumably, the
officers would have to take a
poll, formal or informal, to gain
an insight into seniors' views,
and if the administrators are
being intellectually honest, they
must realize this.
Would Lyman's "smoothest
system" then demand that the
officers take a new poll each
time a speaker declined an
invitation? Or does this border

too closely on the feared
"plebiscite"?
But suppose Lyman's system
— the current one, remember —
passed all of these reasonably
straightforward tests. It would
still fail to meet the more
complex but more deeply
rooted objections raised to
Moynihan's selection.
Certainly, seniors were not
consulted — no one carries on
that charade any longer. But
possibly more to the point,
Stanford's sizeable Third World
community, which not only
opposed Moynihan's selection,
but must have felt frankly
offended by it, was never
consulted — probably never
considered.
Not all opponents
The argument is not that all
possible opponents of all
controversial speakers need
always be consulted. But the
selection committee presumably
looked into Moynihan's
background. In doing so, it
must have discovered (if it was
not already aware) this pattern
of consistent Third World
opposition to him.
The committee then had, at
the very least, an intellectual
responsibility to consult this
community, to try to
understand the reasons for the
opposition. Certainly this alone
should not have been reason
enough to deny Moynihan his
golden forum; but the
committee might have decided
to reconsider.
Vice President for University
Affairs Robert W. Rosenzweig
argued Moynihan had been
selected largely because he was
a great scholar. Here again, the
committee should have
discovered how controversial
many of his theories were, and
consulted people likely to
understand and to hold strong

opinions. And here again, the
invitation might not have been
withdrawn — but it might have
been reconsidered in the light
of such serious opposition.
But Lyman insists on
defending the system that
perpetrated such nonsense. It
worked smoothly, all right, but
it worked badly. There is no
reason why the same mistakes
as last year cannot be repeated
— except, of course, for the
vigilance of the senior class
officers.
But even this is a touchy
question. A recalcitrant and
jealous — or so it seems —
administration can thwart the
best of intentions. In any event,
this year's officers can offer no
guarantee for the openness of
the selection process in the
future.
Such a guarantee only the
University can grant. But the
University, for reasons best
known only to itself, refuses to
learn from past mistakes.

So President Lyman has
decided that once again,
students in general need have
no voice in selecting the
University's commencement
speaker.
On Campus Conference
Monday, Lyman rejected what
he termed "a plebiscite."
Rather, he argued that a
commencement speaker should
be selected in what he termed
the smoothest possible way.
He pointed out, quite
rightly, that the top choice

could simply refuse to attend,
and implied that this would
cause serious problems. But
these problems, in Lyman's
conception, would be overcome
by the current system, wherein
the four senior class officers
and three administrators choose
the speaker.
Not only is this argument
facile and inconsistent, but it
fails in any significant degree to
address the criticisms set forth
last year following the
invitation to then-Harvard Prof.
Daniel P. Moynihan to speak at
commencement.
The Lyman system — the
current system — presumably
allows this committee to vote
on a speaker, and invite her or
him. If the speaker declines,
there is no real problem — the
committee could simply vote
again. And again. All in the
privacy of the committee room.
Suppose, on the other hand,
that Stanford allows students to
vote on a commencement
speaker. The top vote-getter
might turn down the invitation.
Then the next highest
vote-getter would be invited —
no more votes, no committee
meeting, no problem. But for
an administration as hopelessly
steeped in committeeism as is
ours, such an obvious
consideration may be
blasphemy.
Moreover, if Lyman truly
desired the "smoothest" process i
of selecting a speaker, he could
select the speaker himself. Or
he could appoint a Vice
President for Commencement
to make the selection.
