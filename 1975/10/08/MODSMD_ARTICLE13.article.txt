# ERA: Yes

Although Susan Stampfli's
Oct. 3 column on the Equal
Rights Amendment — reprinted
from a Texas college paper —
brings out an interesting,
debatable point concerning the
possible expansion of inefficient
federal bureaucracy and the
transfer of power from the
state to federal levels, it also
makes some absurdly inaccurate
statements in her effort to
"scare" undecided citizens into
opposing the ERA.
First of all, the ERA will
not force women to be
employed any more than
existing laws require men to
work. It will only provide for
the sharing of the responsibility
of child support when such
support is in question, such as
in divorce situations.
Furthermore, no amendment
to the Constitution will ever
remove rights or privileges from
citizens who have enjoyed
them, but may only extend
these rights to disadvantaged
citizens.
Therefore, the right to
privacy will not be nullified by
the ERA, and restrooms, locker
rooms and the like will
continue to be separate and
private.
Likewise, the privilege to a
period of disability leave during
the time immediately preceding
and after the delivery of a child
cannot be denied a woman, just
as a man will continue to be
able to seek a temporary leave
of absence under similarly
disabling circumstances.
In addition, the ERA will
swiftly remove the innumerable
state statutes which
discriminate against women
without allowing them to be
responsible for their own lives
and business affairs.
These laws limit the number
of hours in a day or week that
a woman may work, they
forbid women from working
under certain conditions, and in
some states even forbid or
discourage her from serving on
juries.
Not only will countless
obstacles be removed from the
paths of women who wish to
determine their own lives, but
men will also benefit from this
law by being relieved of the
total responsibility of
maintaining age-old sex roles.
The alleged temporary
legislative and legal difficulties
will be worth the gain.
