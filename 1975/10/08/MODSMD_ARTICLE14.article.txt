## How soon is safe?

How long do women have to take the Pill
before it's safe to have intercourse?
For some reason, there is no universal
agreement on this. Some doctors say to wait an
entire month, others think two weeks is long
enough, and Our Bodies, Our Selves claims your
boyfriend could sleep over the next night.
The issue seems to be the length of time it
takes for a high estrogen level to build up in
your system, since that controls whether an egg
ovulates or not. According to Peer Counseling
sources, it gets even more uncertain when your
period is irregular. The safest bet is to see a
doctor, since he could tell you what is best for
you. For a truly impregnable defense, use a
backup method of birth control for the first
month, then just continue taking the Pill.
How common is nymphomania?
True nymphomaniacs are very rare. What
many people assume to be nymphomania is
actually nothing more than a great liking for
sex, which results in promiscuity. In a man, it's
called a normal sex drive. The actual condition
of nymphomania is pathological in nature, and
consists of an intense and sustained sexual desire
which cannot be satisfied by intercourse or
orgasm. It seems to be caused by unusual
conditions of neuromuscular disease.
/ am good-looking and I dress well and I use the
right kinds of deodorant and mouthwash, and I
have read and even memorized books about how
to pick up girls, and I go to a singles bar and
start talking with a girl, doing everything right,
and after just a few minutes she realizes what an
asshole 1 am, and it's all over. What am I doing

wrong?
If all you want is a pickup, you can spend a
lot less time and money, in the long run, by
going to a pro who specializes in assholes.
They're listed in the yellow pages under Massage
Parlors.
If you just want a reasonably beautiful date
for the evening, borrow a copy of the froshbook
(the source preferred by four out of five
Stanford frats) and go hunting.
On the othor hand if you're looking for a
long-lasting iiilimatp relationship with the
woman of your dreams, try this guaranteed
method: On the evening of the third day
following a full moon in a month beginning
with the letter "J", go into a singles bar, pii« h
the first beautiful woman you see on the ass
and murmur the closing price of Boeing stock
into her ear. She'll be yours forever. Unless she's
a policewoman.
Can a man get an erection after he's dead?
What a way to start off an aspiring new
column. Actually, I had to do quite a bit of
digging on this one, but here's the scoop. I
finally managed to uncover a doctor at the Med
Center (who refuses to be identified) who told
me that the answer was unequivocally no. He
couldn't even believe that anyone would even
consider the possibility, because it's "so
obvious."
The problem is that erections are maintained
by a high volume of blood in the penis, and
dead men don't have any blood pressure.
Even if the man were engaged in intercourse
at the time of his demise, it wouldn't work.

many people assume to be nymphomania is
actually nothing more than a great liking for
sex, which results in promiscuity. In a man, it's

column. Actually, I had to do quite a bit of
digging on this one, but here's the scoop. I
finally managed to uncover a doctor at the Med
Center (who refuses to be identified) who told
me that the answer was unequivocally no. He
