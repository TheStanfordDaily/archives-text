# State Scholarships deadline
## 
### 
California State
Scholarship applications are
available to undergraduates
who will need financial
assistance for the 1976-77
school year, and may be
obtained from the Financial
Aids Office.
Although a majority of
the new scholarships will go
to high school seniors, the
State Scholarship and Loan
Commission expects that
some 3300 awards will be
available for currently
enrolled college students
who are not already in the
State Scholarship Program.
The new awards will
range from $600 to $2500

for students at independent
colleges.
Applications must be filed
with the Scholarship
Commission by midnight,
Dec. 6, 1975, and a 1976-77
Parents' Confidential
Statement must be filed with
the College Scholarship
Service by the same time.
Applicants must complete
the Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) no later than Dec. 6,
1975. SAT scores from
previous years will also be
accepted.
Applicants are no longer
required to be below a
specific age to apply for a
state scholarship.
