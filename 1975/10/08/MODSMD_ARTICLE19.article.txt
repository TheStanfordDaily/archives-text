## Watson: a hero of Stanford golf 
### JEFF WAHBA 
Devoid of the pressure and
tension that surrounds most
professional golf tournaments,
the Tom Watson-Stanford
Pro-Am gave the gallery, players
and Stanford golfers everything
they came for Monday at the
Stanford golf course.
About 4000 watched some
great golf, the players had a
good time and the Stanford
golf program got some money.
Watson, a 1971
graduate of Stanford and
winner of this year's British
Open and World Series of Golf,
got the idea for Stanford's first
professional golf tournament
after he learned of the athletic
department's budget squeeze.
The department eliminated
men's golf scholarships.
Wife's idea
So to help out, Watson (or,
as he tells it, his wife) badgered
21 touring professionals to
come play a round of golf at
Stanford with 84 amateurs. The
key to the event was that most
of the amateurs would chip in
$250 to tee off with a
professional, plus spectators
would pitch in five dollars.
So yesterday at 8:30 a.m.,
21 fivesomes teed off from
each of the 18 holes. Among
those who gave the tourney
their names were pros Johnny
Miller and Buddy Allin along
with star amateurs like John
Brodie and Bing Crosby.
Though there were $450
checks for the winners (George
Cadle and Bob Smith) scores
didn't seem to matter too much
to most of the pros.
Good to help
As Miller, winner of last
week's Kaiser Open, put it,
"It's nice to do something you
don't have to do once in a
while. Even though I have no
association with Stanford, it's
great helping out a friend's
alma mater. I had a real good
time and am just happy I could
help out." Miller carded a 69,
though his smooth strokes
seemed to attract more
attention than his score.
The golfing highlights of the
day were shared by two men.
Eventual winner Cadle sunk his
14th hole tee shot on one
bounce. But little-known
amateur Bob Norton then
stepped up and did the exact

same thing with his four-iron.
Only once before have
back-to-back aces been shot on
the Stanford golf course.
The man of the hour was
definitely Watson, responsible
for the golf program netting
over $22,000.
"This is what golf is really
about, raising money for

charities, whether it be for
cancer research, hospitals, or
Stanford's golf program," said
Watson. "The pros enjoyed this
tournament and I think we can
make this an annual affair."
One man who hopes to see
Watson and his buddies around
again next year is Stanford golf

Coach Bud Finger.
"The proceeds from the
tourney will allow us to
compete with the best college
teams in the country," Finger
stated. "To be the best, you've
got to compete with top teams
in the country and we'll be able
to do that."

while. Even though I have no
association with Stanford, it's
great helping out a friend's
alma mater. I had a real good
time and am just happy I could
help out." Miller carded a 69,
though his smooth strokes
seemed to attract more
attention than his score.
The golfing highlights of the
day were shared by two men.
Eventual winner Cadle sunk his
14th hole tee shot on one
bounce. But little-known
amateur Bob Norton then
stepped up and did the exact

same thing with his four-iron.
Only once before have
back-to-back aces been shot on
the Stanford golf course.
The man of the hour was
definitely Watson, responsible
for the golf program netting
over $22,000.
"This is what golf is really
about, raising money for

charities, whether it be for
cancer research, hospitals, or
Stanford's golf program," said
Watson. "The pros enjoyed this
tournament and I think we can
make this an annual affair."
One man who hopes to see
Watson and his buddies around
again next year is Stanford golf

Coach Bud Finger.
"The proceeds from the
tourney will allow us to
compete with the best college
teams in the country," Finger
stated. "To be the best, you've
got to compete with top teams
in the country and we'll be able
to do that."

TOUGH TOSSING—Zeta Psi quarterback Ed Snate lets one loose
in yesterday's 27-6 Zete victory over Theta Xi. The Zetes are one
of the top-ranked teams in 'A' football play.
Devoid of the pressure and
tension that surrounds most
professional golf tournaments,
the Tom Watson-Stanford
Pro-Am gave the gallery, players
and Stanford golfers everything
they came for Monday at the
Stanford golf course.
About 4000 watched some
great golf, the players had a
good time and the Stanford
golf program got some money.
Watson, a 1971
graduate of Stanford and
winner of this year's British
Open and World Series of Golf,
got the idea for Stanford's first
professional golf tournament
after he learned of the athletic
department's budget squeeze.
The department eliminated
men's golf scholarships.
Wife's idea
So to help out, Watson (or,
as he tells it, his wife) badgered
21 touring professionals to
come play a round of golf at
Stanford with 84 amateurs. The
key to the event was that most
of the amateurs would chip in
$250 to tee off with a
professional, plus spectators
would pitch in five dollars.
So yesterday at 8:30 a.m.,
21 fivesomes teed off from
each of the 18 holes. Among
those who gave the tourney
their names were pros Johnny
Miller and Buddy Allin along
with star amateurs like John
Brodie and Bing Crosby.
Though there were $450
checks for the winners (George
Cadle and Bob Smith) scores
didn't seem to matter too much
to most of the pros.
Good to help
As Miller, winner of last
week's Kaiser Open, put it,
"It's nice to do something you
don't have to do once in a
while. Even though I have no
association with Stanford, it's
great helping out a friend's
alma mater. I had a real good
time and am just happy I could
help out." Miller carded a 69,
