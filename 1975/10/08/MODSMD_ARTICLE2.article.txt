# Frats missing quota; OK seen for Bonfire
## 
### KEVIN CHILDRESS 
The fraternity system may not
meet its assigned housing quota this
year and thus faces possibly serious
consequences, it was determined at a
meeting of the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) yesterday.
At the meeting, the traditional Big
Game Bonfire was favored, although
not officially approved, by the
Council. A later telephone poll
showed a majority in favor of the
Bonfire, and Bill Christopher, a Theta
Delt sophomore, was named Bonfire
Committee chairman.
The fraternities together are 14.5
spots below their new quotas, which
take effect for the first time this
year. A sophomore counts as a full
spot, while upperclassmen tally
one-half spot each in the system
established last year by the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS).
The fraternity system has until
Friday to meet the quota. If the

quota is not met, the housing office
will then issue a warning to the
fraternities.
If the fraternity system fails again
next year to meet its housing quota,
then the house with the largest
percentage of unfilled spots would
tentatively be required to enter the
University draw system and cease to
function as a fraternity.
Advertising push
Sources said the fraternities would
not reach the quota by Friday, but
fraternity presidents voted to go
ahead and try to meet the standards
with an advertising push for new
residents.
"Although we accepted the system
voluntarily last spring, we think it's
unfair," IFC President Bob Ottilie
told the Daily last night.
Delta Kappa Epsilon stands at 8.5
spots below the quota established for
it; Theta Xi, four spots below and
Delta Tau Delta (which is filled, but
mostly by upperclassmen who each

count only one-half spot) at 2.5 spots
below.
Ottilie, meanwhile, is "sure" the
Bonfire will be held as always,
despite opposition from ecology
groups, the ASSU Council of
Presidents and some members of the
fraternity community, led by Delta
Upsilon President Tom Gordon.
Bonfire opposition
Gordon complained of massive
debris left behind each year, and
damage to Lake Lagunita's ecology
(unnatural moss growth, etc.) as his
reasons for opposing the Bonfire. He
conceded, however, that he
represented a minority in the DU
house.
At the meeting, five houses voted
to proceed immediately with Bonfire
plans; however, a telephone poll of
the houses conducted by Ottilie later
in the evening found a majority of
the 13 houses in favor of the fire.
Although alternate plans still may
be presented to the committee
(Gordon suggested "spot fires,"
fireworks or a laser light show),
Ottilie said it was "very unlikely"
that anything would stop the Bonfire
now.
Kappa Alpha's Pete Truex, whose
fraternity house is located near the
lake, noted that the KA's like the
blaze, among other reasons, because
it "brings in all kinds of babes to the
house."
Although Ottilie expressed concern
about the fire's environmental
impact, he said, "We think the
perennial core of activists who
represent a minority of the student
body should accept the demand for
the Bonfire and not annually subject
the students to their arguments,
which the majority have not bought
in the past. This includes the Council
of Presidents."
