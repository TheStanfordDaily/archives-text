# ...but an also-ran on the course

### 
British Open Champion and
Stanford grad Tom Watson may
be number one in the hearts of
Cardinal golf fans and players
for helping initiate Monday's
Tom Watson-Stanford Pro-Am,
but golf professionals Bob E.
Smith and George Cadle
relegated him to third in the
actual tournament.
Smith and Cadle won the
Pro-Am, benefiting Stanford's
indigent golf program, with
18-hole scores of 67.
Watson finished one stroke
back at 68, while Johnny
Miller, one of golf's top pros,
and Bill Rodgers, one of golf's
unknown pros, tied for fourth
place with two-under-par 69's.
Smith and four amateur
partners won the team portion
of the tournament by two
strokes over pro John Jacobs
and his group, which included
ex-49er Gordie Soltau.
Bing Crosby and his team,
headed by John Mahaffey,
finished well back at 204.
Watson left immediately
after the Stanford benefit for
London, England, where he will
play in the Picadilly Match Play
Tournament.
