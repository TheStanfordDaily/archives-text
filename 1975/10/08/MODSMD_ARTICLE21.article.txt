# Women join all IM action
## 
### DAVID TRADER 
Cowell beware — there may
soon be a slow influx of
Stanford jocks needing
treatment. No, Army isn't
planning a counterattack on the
football team; it's just the start
of another IM season.
According to Dutch Fehring,
director of intramural sports,
"The activities encompassed in
the intramural program provide
the competition, exercise and
social benefits that cannot be
found in any other part of the
educational program."
There are a few new features
in this year's programs. The
major change is the merging of
the women's and men's
intramural sports programs.
Cindy Cannon, the coordinator
of the women's program, will
rotate office times between the
IM office and Roble Gym.
Women can participate both in
the All-University Intramurals
with men, and in women's IM's.
Sherry Kosek and Ken Morgan
will work as trainers for all
intramural participants.
Howie Dallmar, former
basketball coach and now
special assistant to the athletic
director, will have the task of
being in charge of all officials.
Other changes include the
incorporation of table tennis
doubles for points and a new
2.75 mile cross country course.

Whether there will be any
changes in who turns up to be
IM champion remains to be
seen. "The Theta Delts, who
have won it the past four years,
should of course be considered
among the frontrunners,"
commented Fehring. "They
always come up with pretty
good teams and accumulate
points by participating in
almost all of the sports." Biz,
JRA and Los Arcos are also top
contenders.
Major innovations in the
program that Fehring would
like to see appear to be far off.
"We greatly need an indoor
recreation facility that can be
used for IM's and informal
recreation.

"It is especially hard in the
winter when we have to play
intramural basketball games at
midnight. Also it's hard when
Maples is only open around
noon," he added.
