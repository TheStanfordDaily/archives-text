# Booters lose again
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer team
(0-2) missed two scoring
opportunities and had a goal
called back yesterday as the
Cards lost to UC-Davis (8-1)
at Davis, 2-0.
Stanford "controlled the
major part of the game,''
according to Coach Bert
Baldaccini, but a shot by
Phil Wright that hit the
crossbar, Mac Taylor's losing
one-on-one confrontation
with Davis' goalie and the
discounted goal left the
Cards scoreless.
Davis capitalized on a
penalty kick for its first and
winning goal.
