Ullman assails tax cuts
WASHINGTON — Congress cannot pledge Lc
meet President Ford's request for a $28 billion
tax cut tied to an equal reduction on spending
until it sees the administration's new budget, the
House's chief tax writer said yesterday.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.) said Ford's plan is "an
impossible one." Ford proposed enactment of
$28 billion in permanent tax cuts for 1976 if
Congress agrees to cut spending by an identical
amount and set a $395 billion spending ceiling
for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, 1976.
As the tax-writing committee began work on
an assortment of tax revision legislation, including
Ford's plan, Ullman said that "if the President
wants a $395 billion budget, why doesn't he
submit a $395 billion budget?"
Beame cuts budget
NEW YORK — New York Mayor Abraham
Beame promised budget cuts of $200 million
yesterday, including the possibility of further
layoffs of city employes, in a plan presented to a
state-controlled board.
Beame presented his preliminary proposal to
eliminate the city's $800 million deficit within a
three-year period to the Emergency Financial
Control Board, a state agency headed by Gov.
Hugh Carey that is designed to oversee the city's
finances.
Hearst ruling delayed
SAN FRANCISCO — A ruling on Patricia
Hearst's mental competency will not come for at
least two weeks because psychiatrists need more
time to examine her, a federal judge said
yesterday.
U.S. District Judge Oliver Carter said
psychiatrists who have been examining
Hearst submitted a preliminary report Monday on

her mental state but plan more extensive final
reports.
"No hearing in the Hearst matter will be held
until after all the psychiatrists' final reports are
filed," Carter announced. The reports, he said, are
expected in 10 days to two weeks.
Corporations' taxes low
WASHINGTON — The average effective
income tax rate paid by 142 major corporations
in 1974 was 22.6 percent, less than half the
standard corporate tax rate, Rep. Charles Vanik
(D-Ohio) said yesterday.
Vanik, a House Ways and Means subcommittee
chairman, said eight companies paid no taxes and
18 more paid at a rate of 10 percent of less. The
standard rate is 48 percent.
The companies, whose aggregate income was
$46 billion, were able to reduce their tax
liabilities "through entirely legal means," Vanik
said.
"if U.S. corporations are already paying little
or nothing in federal income taxes, it makes no
sense to give them tax relief in an effort to
stimulate investment capital," he said.
Fromme asks new counsel
SACRAMENTO - Lynette "Squeaky"
Fromme demanded yesterday that the judge
replace the public defender appointed to help
defend her on a charge of trying to assassinate
President Ford.
U.S. Dist. Judge Thomas Macßride said he
would wait a few days before deciding whether to
grant Miss Fromme's request.
"There is absolutely no rapport between the
co-counsel and myself," she said of U.S. Public
Defender Richard Walker. "We can barely get
through a conversation."
Red Sox, Reds clinch titles

killed Oakland's last hope for a victory witn one
pitch last night and Carl Yastrzemski contributed

Armbrister's sacrifice fly drove in the winning run
