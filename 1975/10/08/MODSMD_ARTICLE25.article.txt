# CORRECTIONS

### 
Yesterday's "Bug Me" column incorrectly
stated that the Bridge paid for the microphones
for the protest rally held during President Ford's
appearance here. Bridge staffer Tim Cullinane
stated that the Alliance for Radical Change paid
for the speakers. The incorrect information was
supplied to the Daily by Plant Services.
A typesetting error in Monday's Daily story on
the campus speech by William Buckley last week
resulted in an incorrect assertion that Buckley
approved of the government plan to bail out the
Penn Central railroad.
Buckley stated that he opposed this and other
government subsidies to private businesses.
The Daily regrets the errors.
