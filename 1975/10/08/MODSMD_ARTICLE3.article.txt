# Hoover Institution influences federal government's policies

The Hoover Institution, long
famous for its international archives
and research, is beginning to attain
national prominence for its domestic
studies and "have some impact on
policy," according to Senior Fellow
Thomas G. Moore, director of the
domestic studies program.
Moore says Hoover's research is
aimed primarily at "long-term
problems," and he believes the
institution's frequently conservative
viewpoints are already having some
influence on government attitudes.
But he cautions that the institution's
influence "is hard to pinpoint, since
domestic research is relatively new"
at Hoover.
He hopes to see the institution
play a role similar to that held by the
Brookings Institute in the '60s.
While Hoover's domestic
researchers are conducting original
research on topics ranging from the
economics of law enforcement to the
merits of an all-volunteer army, at
least one of Hoover's major research
themes — government's excessive
influence on American society — is
being favorably received by the Ford
administration.
Moore, who staunchly objects to

extensive government regulation, is
currently examining Western Europe's
experience with regulation and
deregulation of the trucking industry.
Several congressional committees have
cited his studies on deregulation,
and Treasury Secretary William Simon
recently quoted from them in a

Moore, calling himself a
libertarian, argues that regulation
hurts the consumer. "Transportation
regulation adds to everything you or
I buy at the store. Electricity
regulation has not protected the
consumer in the past, and in the next
few years may even keep him from
getting electricity," he says.
Many of Hoover's other domestic
studies voice concern about the
influence of government
bureaucracies. Hoover Senior Fellow
Rita Ricardo Campbell has analyzed
the economics of both national
health care and food safety
regulations. Roger Freeman's study,
"The Growth of American
Government," argues that government
is spending too much money on
domestic programs.
Although much of Hoover's
domestic research is policy-oriented,
there are exceptions. Most notably,
Edward Teller, the "father of the
H-Bomb," has come to Hoover from
Berkeley to write a book on science
and technology in the 20th century
and its relation to international
security.
A major emphasis on domestic

research may be relatively new, but it
has long been in the planning stages,
