# Mem Chu nuptials
## Hostess battles wedding bell blues 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
When a man and woman are
making wedding arrangements, the
last thing they want to worry
about are nagging details such as
where the bride's mother sits
during the ceremony, who sends in
the marriage license, or whether or
not the groom's father's third wife
should be there at all.
But couples who choose to be

married in Memorial Church are
lucky — Stanford student and
wedding hostess Katie Anderson
takes care of all the details and
does all the worrying, with the
result that most weddings are the
memorable experiences they
should be.
At first glance, Anderson's job
seems remarkably simple. She sits
at her desk in the Round Room

several afternoons a week, answers
the phone, answers questions for
prospective marrieds who may
wander into her office and fills
out marriage registration forms.
What isn't so obvious is her
incredible mind for detail, her
friendliness and desire to make
people happy, her ability to
memorize names and faces and a
thorough knowledge of wedding

etiquette ("If I don't know, I go
by instincts").
Involved
From the very beginnings of a
Mem Chu wedding. Anderson is
involved. When couples call to
make a reservation, she first finds
out if they are eligible.
"Students, alumni, faculty, staff
and faculty-staff families are
eligible [to be married in Mem
Chu]," she explains. She says that
she sometimes has to do a bit of
checking as some people lie about
being eligible, but usually there is
no problem.
She'll then find an available
Saturday (two Saturdays in June
1976, are full already). For a fee
of $75 for students — $100 for
others — to cover expenses, the
reservation is made.
Couples are responsible for
supplying personal details of their
ceremony — the ring, minister,
flowers, attendants, etc. Anderson
will recommend photographers,
florists and the like, and knows
which ones to avoid.
Counseling
Another job she has is
informing all prospective couples
of the compulsory counseling,
which is performed by Asst. Dean
of the Chapel Wendy Smith.
Anderson says that many
couples balk at the idea of
counseling because they don't
understand what it's about.
"It's excellent marital and
social-psychological counseling.
Almost evervone, after they've had

it, is very enthusiastic and gets a
lot out of it,"Anderson adds. "One
couple, who had been married
twice each previously, didn't want
it — and they're just the type who
need it."
Couples resist
She adds that "about a quarter
resist counseling to some extent,
as they think they're going to have
to sit through lectures of no value.
Usually by the second session
[there are four] their impression
transforms."
Anderson steps in again during
rehearsals. She leads the wedding
party through all the motions,
such as where and when to sit,
stand, walk, etc.
Past weddings have had only
church music, but that's getting
more liberal. One recent wedding
had "The Sting" for the
recessional; an upcoming wedding
will use music by John Denver.
Organist Jim Welch explains
that conferences with the
officiating organist are a
pre-wedding must. "If the bride's
mother is there, she wants what
was played at her wedding when
she got married." He adds that
"not many want 'here comes the
bride' music anymore."
Welch also may be asked to add
special touches to the music. At
one recent wedding, bride Thalia
Penix asked that he play a
"toot-toot" to start the
recessional, as her intended, Bruce

FINISHING TOUCHES—Mem Chu Wedding Hostess Katie Anderson pins the corsage on the mother of the bride
as the last-minute touch before the ceremony. It is Anderson's job to make sure all the little aetails are taken
care of so the bride and groom can concentrate on worrying if they're doing the right thing.
