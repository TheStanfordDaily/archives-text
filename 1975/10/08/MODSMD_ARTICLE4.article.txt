# Mem Chu nuptials
## Hostess battles wedding bell blues 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
When a man and woman are
making wedding arrangements, the
last thing they want to worry
about are nagging details such as
where the bride's mother sits
during the ceremony, who sends in
the marriage license, or whether or
not the groom's father's third wife
should be there at all.
But couples who choose to be

married in Memorial Church are
lucky — Stanford student and
wedding hostess Katie Anderson
takes care of all the details and
does all the worrying, with the
result that most weddings are the
memorable experiences they
should be.
At first glance, Anderson's job
seems remarkably simple. She sits
at her desk in the Round Room

several afternoons a week, answers
the phone, answers questions for
prospective marrieds who may
wander into her office and fills
out marriage registration forms.
What isn't so obvious is her
incredible mind for detail, her
friendliness and desire to make
people happy, her ability to
memorize names and faces and a
thorough knowledge of wedding

etiquette ("If I don't know, I go
by instincts").
Involved
From the very beginnings of a
Mem Chu wedding. Anderson is
involved. When couples call to
make a reservation, she first finds
out if they are eligible.
"Students, alumni, faculty, staff
and faculty-staff families are
eligible [to be married in Mem
Chu]," she explains. She says that
she sometimes has to do a bit of
checking as some people lie about
being eligible, but usually there is
no problem.
She'll then find an available
Saturday (two Saturdays in June
1976, are full already). For a fee
of $75 for students — $100 for
others — to cover expenses, the
reservation is made.
Couples are responsible for
supplying personal details of their
ceremony — the ring, minister,
flowers, attendants, etc. Anderson
will recommend photographers,
florists and the like, and knows
which ones to avoid.
Counseling
Another job she has is
informing all prospective couples
of the compulsory counseling,
which is performed by Asst. Dean
of the Chapel Wendy Smith.
Anderson says that many
couples balk at the idea of
counseling because they don't
understand what it's about.
"It's excellent marital and
social-psychological counseling.
Almost evervone, after they've had

it, is very enthusiastic and gets a
lot out of it,"Anderson adds. "One
couple, who had been married
twice each previously, didn't want
it — and they're just the type who
need it."
Couples resist
She adds that "about a quarter
resist counseling to some extent,
as they think they're going to have
to sit through lectures of no value.
Usually by the second session
[there are four] their impression
transforms."
Anderson steps in again during
rehearsals. She leads the wedding
party through all the motions,
such as where and when to sit,
stand, walk, etc.
Past weddings have had only
church music, but that's getting
more liberal. One recent wedding
had "The Sting" for the
recessional; an upcoming wedding
will use music by John Denver.
Organist Jim Welch explains
that conferences with the
officiating organist are a
pre-wedding must. "If the bride's
mother is there, she wants what
was played at her wedding when
she got married." He adds that
"not many want 'here comes the
bride' music anymore."
Welch also may be asked to add
special touches to the music. At
one recent wedding, bride Thalia
Penix asked that he play a
"toot-toot" to start the
recessional, as her intended, Bruce

FINISHING TOUCHES—Mem Chu Wedding Hostess Katie Anderson pins the corsage on the mother of the bride
as the last-minute touch before the ceremony. It is Anderson's job to make sure all the little aetails are taken
care of so the bride and groom can concentrate on worrying if they're doing the right thing.
Battles, is a model train freak.
Welch complied.
Anderson's responsibilities
are multitudinous. About a
half-hour before the ceremony,
while the groom paces,
Anderson fills out the license
and registry of marriage.
Battles admits to having been
nervous before his wedding, but
adds, "we only had one
rehearsal, and we didn't know
what to do. She helped us, and
she's been great, especially
when people get flustered. I'm
sure there's nothing she doesn't
know."
Anderson then goes to the
East Room, where the bride
and her attendants are waiting.
She reassures them that all is

going well, and then talks to
the organist to give him his
cues.
She and the sexton help to
usher in guests. She says she
won't allow the ceremony to
start unless she's reasonably
sure all the guests are there.
Then she arranges the family
for pre-wedding pictures.
During the ceremony, Anderson
and the sexton stand by the
main doors to keep gawking
tourists out; "often tourists
cling to the doors like a
monkey show."
Just before the bride walks
down the aisle, Anderson
adjusts her train. And after the
ceremony, she has to make the
couple aware of the next

wedding scheduled hoping that
one party leaves without seeing
the next. A quick clean up and
candle-lighting, and she's done.
Anderson says she enjoys the
job, adding "it's fun being a
part of it, yet not a part of it."
She admits that it's a challenge,
that she feels a lot of
responsibility, and occasionally
worries about everything going
right. Sometimes she even has
nightmares; she describes one in
which the bridal party was late,
and then they all rushed into
the church dressed in football
uniforms.
She says she realizes how
important each wedding is to
the individuals getting married,
but she says her job tends to
make her cynical about the

wedding industry because "I see
so many of them. I have to
remember it's their first, and
my 200 th."
Most of her weddings go
very smoothly, and people rave
about her. Sexton Dan Delgado
says "she's excellent.
Sometimes people fight in
rehearsals and she's a good
mediator."
And Mrs. Lawrence Werner,
a mother of a recent bride, says
"Katie's fabulous — such
professionalism. All the guests
commented about her, and we
can't rave enough."
Anderson admits that some
of her weddings are memorable
experiences, but for the wrong
reasons. She painfully
remembers her worst wedding,
where "the best man took over.
He seated the guests wrong and
then took everyone to the
reception without posing for
pictures after the ceremony.
"I had to get everyone
back," she continues, and then
adds that "he reported me to
the Dean [Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-Kelly ], but
Kelly said it wasn't my fault."
Indeed, Kelly also raves
about Anderson. "She does a
fine job — I don't know where
we'd be without her."
Anderson says that some of
her weddings have their funny
moments. At one, the bride and
groom drank wine before being
declared man and wife, and he
spilled wine all over the bride's
white dress.
At another, the groom
forgot the ring, and had to
drive to Sunnyvale to get it.

The bride got upset, refused to
walk down the aisle and said
she wasn't sure she wanted to
marry the guy after all.
During Mike and Kerry
Boryla's wedding, the officiating
organist came down from the
organ loft to chat with
Anderson and Delgado. The
couple were halfway down the
aisle before the organist realized
he was late with the recessional,
and he took the steps two at a
time to play a little music
before they were out of the
church.
And Anderson has dealt with
the unusual. At one wedding,
both parents of the groom were
deaf, and had a sign language
interpreter. At others, the bride
was blind, and one groom was
an amputee in a wheel chair.
Anderson has had the job
about two years. She got it
through a friend. It helps pay
her Stanford expenses, and
she'd "rather do this than
sitting in a library or hashing."

THEY DO—The final touches of another wedding for Anderson. Since she's been through over 200
ceremonies, she says she sometimes finds it hard to remember it's the couples' first.

the next. A quick clean up and
candle-lighting, and she's done.
Anderson says she enjoys the
job, adding "it's fun being a
part of it, yet not a part of it."
She admits that it's a challenge,
that she feels a lot of
responsibility, and occasionally
worries about everything going
right. Sometimes she even has
nightmares; she describes one in
which the bridal party was late,
and then they all rushed into
the church dressed in football
uniforms.
She says she realizes how
important each wedding is to
the individuals getting married,
but she says her job tends to
make her cynical about the

wedding industry because "I see
so many of them. I have to

Most of her weddings go
very smoothly, and people rave
about her. Sexton Dan Delgado
says "she's excellent.
Sometimes people fight in
rehearsals and she's a good
mediator."
And Mrs. Lawrence Werner,
a mother of a recent bride, says
"Katie's fabulous — such
professionalism. All the guests
commented about her, and we
can't rave enough."
Anderson admits that some
of her weddings are memorable
experiences, but for the wrong
reasons. She painfully
remembers her worst wedding,
where "the best man took over.
He seated the guests wrong and
then took everyone to the
reception without posing for
pictures after the ceremony.
"I had to get everyone
back," she continues, and then
adds that "he reported me to
the Dean [Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-Kelly ], but
Kelly said it wasn't my fault."
Indeed, Kelly also raves
about Anderson. "She does a
fine job — I don't know where
we'd be without her."
Anderson says that some of
her weddings have their funny
moments. At one, the bride and
groom drank wine before being
declared man and wife, and he
spilled wine all over the bride's
white dress.
At another, the groom
forgot the ring, and had to
drive to Sunnyvale to get it.

The bride got upset, refused to
walk down the aisle and said
she wasn't sure she wanted to
marry the guy after all.
During Mike and Kerry
Boryla's wedding, the officiating
organist came down from the
organ loft to chat with
Anderson and Delgado. The
couple were halfway down the
aisle before the organist realized
he was late with the recessional,
and he took the steps two at a
time to play a little music
before they were out of the
church.
And Anderson has dealt with
the unusual. At one wedding,
both parents of the groom were
deaf, and had a sign language
interpreter. At others, the bride
was blind, and one groom was
an amputee in a wheel chair.
Anderson has had the job
about two years. She got it
through a friend. It helps pay
her Stanford expenses, and
she'd "rather do this than
sitting in a library or hashing."

THEY DO—The final touches of another wedding for Anderson. Since she's been through over 200
ceremonies, she says she sometimes finds it hard to remember it's the couples' first.

ANY QUESTIONS?—Anderson briefs bride Meg Peterson outside
Memorial Church Saturday before her final walk down the aisle
to marry Keith Heneman.
When a man and woman are
making wedding arrangements, the
last thing they want to worry
about are nagging details such as
where the bride's mother sits
during the ceremony, who sends in
the marriage license, or whether or
not the groom's father's third wife
should be there at all.
But couples who choose to be

married in Memorial Church are
lucky — Stanford student and
wedding hostess Katie Anderson
takes care of all the details and
does all the worrying, with the
result that most weddings are the
memorable experiences they
should be.
At first glance, Anderson's job
seems remarkably simple. She sits
at her desk in the Round Room

several afternoons a week, answers
the phone, answers questions for
prospective marrieds who may
wander into her office and fills
out marriage registration forms.
What isn't so obvious is her
incredible mind for detail, her
friendliness and desire to make
people happy, her ability to
memorize names and faces and a
thorough knowledge of wedding

etiquette ("If I don't know, I go
by instincts").
Involved
From the very beginnings of a
Mem Chu wedding. Anderson is
involved. When couples call to
make a reservation, she first finds
out if they are eligible.
"Students, alumni, faculty, staff
and faculty-staff families are
eligible [to be married in Mem
Chu]," she explains. She says that
she sometimes has to do a bit of
checking as some people lie about
being eligible, but usually there is
no problem.
She'll then find an available
Saturday (two Saturdays in June
1976, are full already). For a fee
of $75 for students — $100 for
others — to cover expenses, the
reservation is made.
Couples are responsible for
supplying personal details of their
ceremony — the ring, minister,
flowers, attendants, etc. Anderson
will recommend photographers,
florists and the like, and knows
which ones to avoid.
Counseling
Another job she has is
informing all prospective couples
of the compulsory counseling,
which is performed by Asst. Dean
of the Chapel Wendy Smith.
Anderson says that many
couples balk at the idea of
counseling because they don't
understand what it's about.
"It's excellent marital and
social-psychological counseling.
Almost evervone, after they've had

it, is very enthusiastic and gets a
lot out of it,"Anderson adds. "One
couple, who had been married
twice each previously, didn't want
it — and they're just the type who
need it."
Couples resist
She adds that "about a quarter
resist counseling to some extent,
as they think they're going to have
to sit through lectures of no value.
Usually by the second session
[there are four] their impression
transforms."
Anderson steps in again during
rehearsals. She leads the wedding
party through all the motions,
such as where and when to sit,
stand, walk, etc.
Past weddings have had only
church music, but that's getting
more liberal. One recent wedding
had "The Sting" for the
recessional; an upcoming wedding
will use music by John Denver.
Organist Jim Welch explains
that conferences with the
officiating organist are a
pre-wedding must. "If the bride's
mother is there, she wants what
was played at her wedding when
she got married." He adds that
"not many want 'here comes the
bride' music anymore."
Welch also may be asked to add
special touches to the music. At
one recent wedding, bride Thalia
Penix asked that he play a
"toot-toot" to start the
recessional, as her intended, Bruce

FINISHING TOUCHES—Mem Chu Wedding Hostess Katie Anderson pins the corsage on the mother of the bride
as the last-minute touch before the ceremony. It is Anderson's job to make sure all the little aetails are taken
care of so the bride and groom can concentrate on worrying if they're doing the right thing.
Battles, is a model train freak.
Welch complied.
Anderson's responsibilities
are multitudinous. About a
half-hour before the ceremony,
while the groom paces,
Anderson fills out the license
and registry of marriage.
Battles admits to having been
nervous before his wedding, but
adds, "we only had one
rehearsal, and we didn't know
what to do. She helped us, and
she's been great, especially
when people get flustered. I'm
sure there's nothing she doesn't
know."
Anderson then goes to the
East Room, where the bride
and her attendants are waiting.
She reassures them that all is

going well, and then talks to
the organist to give him his
cues.
She and the sexton help to
usher in guests. She says she
won't allow the ceremony to
start unless she's reasonably
sure all the guests are there.
Then she arranges the family
for pre-wedding pictures.
During the ceremony, Anderson
and the sexton stand by the
main doors to keep gawking
tourists out; "often tourists
cling to the doors like a
monkey show."
Just before the bride walks
down the aisle, Anderson
adjusts her train. And after the
ceremony, she has to make the
couple aware of the next

wedding scheduled hoping that
one party leaves without seeing
the next. A quick clean up and
candle-lighting, and she's done.
Anderson says she enjoys the
job, adding "it's fun being a

Anderson says that many
couples balk at the idea of
counseling because they don't
understand what it's about.
"It's excellent marital and
social-psychological counseling.
Almost evervone, after they've had

it, is very enthusiastic and gets a
lot out of it,"Anderson adds. "One
couple, who had been married
twice each previously, didn't want
it — and they're just the type who
need it."
Couples resist
She adds that "about a quarter
resist counseling to some extent,
as they think they're going to have
to sit through lectures of no value.
Usually by the second session
[there are four] their impression
transforms."
Anderson steps in again during
rehearsals. She leads the wedding
party through all the motions,
such as where and when to sit,
stand, walk, etc.
Past weddings have had only
church music, but that's getting
more liberal. One recent wedding
had "The Sting" for the
recessional; an upcoming wedding
will use music by John Denver.
Organist Jim Welch explains
that conferences with the
officiating organist are a
pre-wedding must. "If the bride's
mother is there, she wants what
was played at her wedding when
she got married." He adds that
"not many want 'here comes the
bride' music anymore."
Welch also may be asked to add
special touches to the music. At
one recent wedding, bride Thalia

"toot-toot" to start the
recessional, as her intended, Bruce

FINISHING TOUCHES—Mem Chu Wedding Hostess Katie Anderson pins the corsage on the mother of the bride
as the last-minute touch before the ceremony. It is Anderson's job to make sure all the little aetails are taken
care of so the bride and groom can concentrate on worrying if they're doing the right thing.
Battles, is a model train freak.
Welch complied.
Anderson's responsibilities
are multitudinous. About a
half-hour before the ceremony,
while the groom paces,
Anderson fills out the license
and registry of marriage.
Battles admits to having been
nervous before his wedding, but
adds, "we only had one
rehearsal, and we didn't know
what to do. She helped us, and
she's been great, especially
when people get flustered. I'm
sure there's nothing she doesn't
know."
Anderson then goes to the
East Room, where the bride
and her attendants are waiting.
She reassures them that all is

going well, and then talks to
the organist to give him his
cues.
She and the sexton help to
usher in guests. She says she
won't allow the ceremony to
start unless she's reasonably
sure all the guests are there.
Then she arranges the family
for pre-wedding pictures.
During the ceremony, Anderson
and the sexton stand by the
main doors to keep gawking
tourists out; "often tourists
cling to the doors like a
monkey show."
Just before the bride walks
down the aisle, Anderson
adjusts her train. And after the
ceremony, she has to make the
couple aware of the next

wedding scheduled hoping that
one party leaves without seeing
the next. A quick clean up and
candle-lighting, and she's done.
Anderson says she enjoys the
job, adding "it's fun being a
part of it, yet not a part of it."
She admits that it's a challenge,
that she feels a lot of
responsibility, and occasionally
worries about everything going
right. Sometimes she even has
nightmares; she describes one in
which the bridal party was late,
and then they all rushed into
the church dressed in football
uniforms.
She says she realizes how
important each wedding is to
the individuals getting married,
but she says her job tends to
make her cynical about the

wedding industry because "I see
so many of them. I have to

Most of her weddings go
very smoothly, and people rave
about her. Sexton Dan Delgado
says "she's excellent.
Sometimes people fight in
rehearsals and she's a good
mediator."
And Mrs. Lawrence Werner,
a mother of a recent bride, says
"Katie's fabulous — such
professionalism. All the guests
commented about her, and we
can't rave enough."
Anderson admits that some
of her weddings are memorable
experiences, but for the wrong
reasons. She painfully
remembers her worst wedding,
where "the best man took over.
He seated the guests wrong and
then took everyone to the
reception without posing for
pictures after the ceremony.
"I had to get everyone
back," she continues, and then
adds that "he reported me to
the Dean [Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-Kelly ], but
Kelly said it wasn't my fault."
Indeed, Kelly also raves
about Anderson. "She does a
fine job — I don't know where
we'd be without her."
Anderson says that some of
her weddings have their funny
moments. At one, the bride and
groom drank wine before being
declared man and wife, and he
spilled wine all over the bride's
white dress.
At another, the groom
forgot the ring, and had to
drive to Sunnyvale to get it.

The bride got upset, refused to
walk down the aisle and said
she wasn't sure she wanted to
marry the guy after all.
During Mike and Kerry
Boryla's wedding, the officiating
organist came down from the
organ loft to chat with
Anderson and Delgado. The
couple were halfway down the
aisle before the organist realized
he was late with the recessional,
and he took the steps two at a
time to play a little music
before they were out of the
church.
And Anderson has dealt with
the unusual. At one wedding,
both parents of the groom were
deaf, and had a sign language
interpreter. At others, the bride
was blind, and one groom was
an amputee in a wheel chair.
Anderson has had the job
about two years. She got it
through a friend. It helps pay
her Stanford expenses, and
she'd "rather do this than
sitting in a library or hashing."

THEY DO—The final touches of another wedding for Anderson. Since she's been through over 200
ceremonies, she says she sometimes finds it hard to remember it's the couples' first.


—Daily photo by Mark Funk
ANY QUESTIONS?—Anderson briefs bride Meg Peterson outside
Memorial Church Saturday before her final walk down the aisle
to marry Keith Heneman.
When a man and woman are
making wedding arrangements, the
last thing they want to worry
about are nagging details such as
where the bride's mother sits
during the ceremony, who sends in
the marriage license, or whether or
not the groom's father's third wife
should be there at all.
But couples who choose to be

married in Memorial Church are
lucky — Stanford student and
wedding hostess Katie Anderson
takes care of all the details and
does all the worrying, with the
result that most weddings are the
memorable experiences they
should be.
At first glance, Anderson's job
seems remarkably simple. She sits
at her desk in the Round Room

several afternoons a week, answers
the phone, answers questions for
prospective marrieds who may
wander into her office and fills
out marriage registration forms.
What isn't so obvious is her
incredible mind for detail, her
friendliness and desire to make
people happy, her ability to
memorize names and faces and a
thorough knowledge of wedding

etiquette ("If I don't know, I go
by instincts").
Involved
From the very beginnings of a
Mem Chu wedding. Anderson is
involved. When couples call to
make a reservation, she first finds
out if they are eligible.
"Students, alumni, faculty, staff
and faculty-staff families are
eligible [to be married in Mem
Chu]," she explains. She says that
she sometimes has to do a bit of
checking as some people lie about
being eligible, but usually there is
no problem.
She'll then find an available
Saturday (two Saturdays in June
1976, are full already). For a fee
of $75 for students — $100 for
others — to cover expenses, the
reservation is made.
Couples are responsible for
supplying personal details of their
ceremony — the ring, minister,
flowers, attendants, etc. Anderson
will recommend photographers,
florists and the like, and knows
which ones to avoid.
Counseling
Another job she has is
informing all prospective couples
of the compulsory counseling,
which is performed by Asst. Dean
of the Chapel Wendy Smith.
Anderson says that many
couples balk at the idea of
counseling because they don't
understand what it's about.
"It's excellent marital and
social-psychological counseling.

drive to Sunnyvale to get it.

The bride got upset, refused to
walk down the aisle and said
she wasn't sure she wanted to
marry the guy after all.
During Mike and Kerry
Boryla's wedding, the officiating
organist came down from the
organ loft to chat with
Anderson and Delgado. The
couple were halfway down the
aisle before the organist realized
he was late with the recessional,
and he took the steps two at a
time to play a little music
before they were out of the
church.
And Anderson has dealt with
the unusual. At one wedding,
both parents of the groom were
deaf, and had a sign language
interpreter. At others, the bride
was blind, and one groom was
an amputee in a wheel chair.
Anderson has had the job
about two years. She got it
through a friend. It helps pay
her Stanford expenses, and
she'd "rather do this than
sitting in a library or hashing."

THEY DO—The final touches of another wedding for Anderson. Since she's been through over 200
ceremonies, she says she sometimes finds it hard to remember it's the couples' first.

ANY QUESTIONS?—Anderson briefs bride Meg Peterson outside
Memorial Church Saturday before her final walk down the aisle
to marry Keith Heneman.
When a man and woman are
making wedding arrangements, the
last thing they want to worry
about are nagging details such as
where the bride's mother sits
during the ceremony, who sends in
the marriage license, or whether or
not the groom's father's third wife
should be there at all.
But couples who choose to be

married in Memorial Church are
lucky — Stanford student and
wedding hostess Katie Anderson
takes care of all the details and
does all the worrying, with the
result that most weddings are the
memorable experiences they
should be.
At first glance, Anderson's job
seems remarkably simple. She sits
at her desk in the Round Room

several afternoons a week, answers
the phone, answers questions for
prospective marrieds who may
wander into her office and fills
out marriage registration forms.
What isn't so obvious is her
incredible mind for detail, her
friendliness and desire to make
people happy, her ability to
memorize names and faces and a
thorough knowledge of wedding

etiquette ("If I don't know, I go
by instincts").
Involved
From the very beginnings of a
Mem Chu wedding. Anderson is
involved. When couples call to
make a reservation, she first finds
out if they are eligible.
"Students, alumni, faculty, staff
and faculty-staff families are
eligible [to be married in Mem
Chu]," she explains. She says that
she sometimes has to do a bit of
checking as some people lie about
being eligible, but usually there is
no problem.
She'll then find an available
Saturday (two Saturdays in June
1976, are full already). For a fee
of $75 for students — $100 for
others — to cover expenses, the
reservation is made.
Couples are responsible for
supplying personal details of their
ceremony — the ring, minister,
flowers, attendants, etc. Anderson
will recommend photographers,
florists and the like, and knows
which ones to avoid.
Counseling
Another job she has is
informing all prospective couples
of the compulsory counseling,
which is performed by Asst. Dean
of the Chapel Wendy Smith.
Anderson says that many
couples balk at the idea of
counseling because they don't
understand what it's about.
"It's excellent marital and
social-psychological counseling.
Almost evervone, after they've had

it, is very enthusiastic and gets a
lot out of it,"Anderson adds. "One
couple, who had been married
twice each previously, didn't want
it — and they're just the type who
need it."
Couples resist
She adds that "about a quarter
resist counseling to some extent,
as they think they're going to have
to sit through lectures of no value.
Usually by the second session
[there are four] their impression
transforms."
Anderson steps in again during
rehearsals. She leads the wedding
party through all the motions,
such as where and when to sit,
stand, walk, etc.
Past weddings have had only
church music, but that's getting
more liberal. One recent wedding
had "The Sting" for the
recessional; an upcoming wedding
will use music by John Denver.
Organist Jim Welch explains
that conferences with the
officiating organist are a
pre-wedding must. "If the bride's
mother is there, she wants what
was played at her wedding when
she got married." He adds that
"not many want 'here comes the
bride' music anymore."
Welch also may be asked to add
special touches to the music. At
one recent wedding, bride Thalia
Penix asked that he play a
"toot-toot" to start the
recessional, as her intended, Bruce

FINISHING TOUCHES—Mem Chu Wedding Hostess Katie Anderson pins the corsage on the mother of the bride
as the last-minute touch before the ceremony. It is Anderson's job to make sure all the little aetails are taken
care of so the bride and groom can concentrate on worrying if they're doing the right thing.
Battles, is a model train freak.
Welch complied.
Anderson's responsibilities
are multitudinous. About a
half-hour before the ceremony,
while the groom paces,
Anderson fills out the license
and registry of marriage.
Battles admits to having been
nervous before his wedding, but
adds, "we only had one
rehearsal, and we didn't know
what to do. She helped us, and
she's been great, especially
when people get flustered. I'm
sure there's nothing she doesn't
know."
Anderson then goes to the
East Room, where the bride
and her attendants are waiting.
She reassures them that all is

going well, and then talks to
the organist to give him his
cues.
She and the sexton help to
usher in guests. She says she
won't allow the ceremony to
start unless she's reasonably
sure all the guests are there.
Then she arranges the family
for pre-wedding pictures.
During the ceremony, Anderson
and the sexton stand by the
main doors to keep gawking
tourists out; "often tourists
cling to the doors like a
monkey show."
Just before the bride walks
down the aisle, Anderson
adjusts her train. And after the
ceremony, she has to make the
couple aware of the next

wedding scheduled hoping that
one party leaves without seeing
the next. A quick clean up and
candle-lighting, and she's done.
Anderson says she enjoys the
job, adding "it's fun being a
part of it, yet not a part of it."
She admits that it's a challenge,
that she feels a lot of
responsibility, and occasionally
worries about everything going
right. Sometimes she even has
nightmares; she describes one in
which the bridal party was late,
and then they all rushed into
the church dressed in football
uniforms.
She says she realizes how
important each wedding is to
the individuals getting married,
but she says her job tends to
make her cynical about the

wedding industry because "I see
so many of them. I have to
remember it's their first, and
my 200 th."
Most of her weddings go
very smoothly, and people rave
about her. Sexton Dan Delgado
says "she's excellent.
Sometimes people fight in
rehearsals and she's a good
mediator."
And Mrs. Lawrence Werner,
a mother of a recent bride, says
"Katie's fabulous — such
professionalism. All the guests
commented about her, and we
can't rave enough."
Anderson admits that some
of her weddings are memorable
experiences, but for the wrong
reasons. She painfully
remembers her worst wedding,
where "the best man took over.
He seated the guests wrong and
then took everyone to the
reception without posing for
pictures after the ceremony.
"I had to get everyone
back," she continues, and then
adds that "he reported me to
the Dean [Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-Kelly ], but
Kelly said it wasn't my fault."
Indeed, Kelly also raves
about Anderson. "She does a
fine job — I don't know where
we'd be without her."
Anderson says that some of
her weddings have their funny
moments. At one, the bride and
groom drank wine before being
declared man and wife, and he
spilled wine all over the bride's
white dress.
At another, the groom
forgot the ring, and had to
drive to Sunnyvale to get it.

The bride got upset, refused to
walk down the aisle and said
she wasn't sure she wanted to
marry the guy after all.
During Mike and Kerry
Boryla's wedding, the officiating
organist came down from the

are multitudinous. About a
half-hour before the ceremony,
while the groom paces,
Anderson fills out the license
and registry of marriage.
Battles admits to having been
nervous before his wedding, but
adds, "we only had one
rehearsal, and we didn't know
what to do. She helped us, and
she's been great, especially
when people get flustered. I'm
sure there's nothing she doesn't
know."
Anderson then goes to the
East Room, where the bride
and her attendants are waiting.
She reassures them that all is

going well, and then talks to
the organist to give him his
cues.
She and the sexton help to
usher in guests. She says she
won't allow the ceremony to
start unless she's reasonably
sure all the guests are there.
Then she arranges the family
for pre-wedding pictures.
During the ceremony, Anderson
and the sexton stand by the
main doors to keep gawking
tourists out; "often tourists
cling to the doors like a
monkey show."
Just before the bride walks
down the aisle, Anderson
adjusts her train. And after the
ceremony, she has to make the
couple aware of the next

wedding scheduled hoping that
one party leaves without seeing
the next. A quick clean up and
candle-lighting, and she's done.
Anderson says she enjoys the
job, adding "it's fun being a
part of it, yet not a part of it."
She admits that it's a challenge,
that she feels a lot of
responsibility, and occasionally
worries about everything going
right. Sometimes she even has
nightmares; she describes one in
which the bridal party was late,
and then they all rushed into
the church dressed in football
uniforms.
She says she realizes how
important each wedding is to
the individuals getting married,
but she says her job tends to
make her cynical about the

wedding industry because "I see
so many of them. I have to
remember it's their first, and
my 200 th."
Most of her weddings go
very smoothly, and people rave
about her. Sexton Dan Delgado
says "she's excellent.
Sometimes people fight in
rehearsals and she's a good
mediator."
And Mrs. Lawrence Werner,
a mother of a recent bride, says
"Katie's fabulous — such
professionalism. All the guests
commented about her, and we
can't rave enough."
Anderson admits that some
of her weddings are memorable
experiences, but for the wrong
reasons. She painfully
remembers her worst wedding,
where "the best man took over.
He seated the guests wrong and
then took everyone to the
reception without posing for
pictures after the ceremony.
"I had to get everyone
back," she continues, and then
adds that "he reported me to
the Dean [Dean of the Chapel
Robert Hamerton-Kelly ], but
Kelly said it wasn't my fault."
Indeed, Kelly also raves
about Anderson. "She does a
fine job — I don't know where
we'd be without her."
Anderson says that some of
her weddings have their funny
moments. At one, the bride and
groom drank wine before being
declared man and wife, and he
spilled wine all over the bride's
white dress.
At another, the groom
forgot the ring, and had to
drive to Sunnyvale to get it.

The bride got upset, refused to
walk down the aisle and said
she wasn't sure she wanted to
marry the guy after all.
During Mike and Kerry
Boryla's wedding, the officiating
organist came down from the
organ loft to chat with
Anderson and Delgado. The
couple were halfway down the
aisle before the organist realized
he was late with the recessional,
and he took the steps two at a
time to play a little music
before they were out of the
church.
And Anderson has dealt with
the unusual. At one wedding,
both parents of the groom were
deaf, and had a sign language
interpreter. At others, the bride
was blind, and one groom was
an amputee in a wheel chair.
Anderson has had the job
about two years. She got it
through a friend. It helps pay
her Stanford expenses, and
she'd "rather do this than
sitting in a library or hashing."
