# Staff shifts with budget cutbacks
## 
### 
Budget cuts and the shifting of
several officials to part-time work
have caused a juggling of duties in
the University administration.
B. Michael Closson, assistant dean
of undergraduate studies, plans to
work only three days a week to
devote more time to an alternative
work center in Palo Alto.
Learning Assistance Center
Director R. Michael McHargue will
take over Closson's duties as director
of the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Program (UROP).
Laura Selznick, assistant to the
assistant dean of undergraduate
studies, will continue to do much of
the day-to-day coordination.
Asst. Dean G. Robert
Hamrdla, director of the Academic
Information Center, will take over
Closson's task of supervising the
topical compendium. Hamrdla says he
does not plan to publish the
compendium, a listing of courses
under special topics, at least for this
quarter.
Andrew Parnes, current director of
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI), will work
half-time this year while pursuing
legal studies at UC-Berkeley. Alice
Supton, formerly full time director of
the Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE),
will divide her time between SCIRE
and SWOPSI.
Sally Monfort Freelen, currently
assistant dean of humanities and
sciences, has been appointed assistant
dean of undergraduate studies on a
half-time basis, replacing Beth
Alvarez.
Undergraduate Studies Dean James
Gibbs says he hopes Freelen's joint
duties will provide a "closer liason"
between the two offices.
