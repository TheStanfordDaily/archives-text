## No parks here 
### 
Palo Alto may need more parks, but University land,
contrary to the city's preliminary draft of its
Comprehensive Plan, is not the place to put them.
We support the objections to the city's proposals
raised by Robert Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, in a Sept. 10 letter to the Palo Alto City
Planning Commission.
Augsburger stated that Stanford's land policy
emphasizes holding the University's vacant property
open for the academic needs of future generations.
Although the five proposed park sites are not near
the academic center of campus, it is impossible to
predict whether the University will need the land in the
future. Could the University's founders, for example,
have envisioned the use of the foothills for a linear
accelerator?
We join the University administration in urging Palo
Alto to omit references in the Comprehensive Plan's final
draft to the use of Stanford land for parks.
