# Hoover receives crime grant
## 
### ROBERT E. BARKER 
The Hoover Institution has been
awarded a grant of $600,000 by the
Justice Department to create a
criminal justice research center here.
The grant is contingent upon final
approval of the center's research
plans.
Tentatively named the Center for
Econometric Studies and Criminal
Justice, it will use the initial grant to
study the relations between
employment opportunities and crime
over the next two years. The center
will become a permanent addition to
the Hoover Institution, according to
Institution officials.
Research Fellow Michael K. Block,
a Stanford economist with five years
experience in the field of the
economics of theft, will be the senior
investigator. "My main mission," says
Block, "is to refine the empirical
work which has already been done.
I'd like to bring precision to these
techniques.
'Theoretical work'
"The theoretical work that I've
already done suggests that economic
theory alone will not predict what
effect small changes in economics has
on various deterrents to crime," he
added.
Techniques known as
"econometrics" are the ones which
Block will be trying to make more
precise. He and other researchers will
anonymously record economic and
criminal histories of prisoners,
primarily those convicted of property
crimes. Block is confident that his
data will be accurate "because we're
not using very much subjective
information."
By studying at least 100 economic
characteristics from the prison files of
up to 1000 California inmates, Block
hopes to draw conclusions about the
efficacy of current crime deterrent
and prison job training programs.
"The charter of the center is to do
econometric work using sophisticated
statistical methods. One of the
purposes for establishing a center is
to further this discipline," Block
explained.
Other studies
The Justice Department, which has
also commissioned Yale University
and the Rand Corporation of Santa
Monica, Calif., to do studies on other
aspects of criminal justice, hopes to
gain more accurate knowledge of the
best way to deter crime.
"We want to be able to pinpoint
the proper places to spend money
which has been allocated for law
enforcement," added Richard T.
Burress, associate director and a
senior fellow at Hoover.
The center is engaged in a 90-day
planning period which began Sept. 1.
Block expects the study to be fully
underway by December.
Burress said he assumed "that
Stanford's proposal for a research
center on crime was accepted by the
Justice Department because of our
reputation for both domestic and
international research expertise."

President Ford is considering appointing Business School Pirof.George P. Shultz
as director of the CIA. But Shultz claimed he knew nothing of the reports
and was "very content" here.
