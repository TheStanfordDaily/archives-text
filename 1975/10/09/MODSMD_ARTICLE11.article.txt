# Do deserters deserve full amnesty?
## 
### 
(First of two parts)
It is sometimes difficult to
persuade people that deserters
should receive amnesty. Many
people who can be persuaded
that draft-resisters deserve
vindication and by extension
that draftees who deserted also
deserve vindication, are
reluctant to accept the idea of
full amnesty for deserters.
The draft is an unusual,
almost alien, institution in
American life. In contrast,
prosecution for desertion and
other violations of the
discipline imposed in the
military are familiar features of
our historical landscape.
Not only do habits of mind
inhibit acceptance of amnesty
for deserters, but various
arguments offered by some
political and legal theorists also
seem to counsel against
amnesty for deserters.
Raising the topic of
desertion from the military sets
the stage for many difficult
desertion-related questions. Is
some sort of aggression or theft
inherent in desertion? Does
staying on the job during an
unjust war constitute aggression
by the individual soldier? Do
employees of the military have
a right to quit their jobs (just
war or not)?
On the other hand, if
they've enlisted for a five-year
hitch, have they taken on a
duty which it would be
criminal to neglect or have they
contractually given up their
right to quit? In touching on
these questions, we will be
evaluating the various possible
answers from the libertarian
ethical standpoint that upholds
the primacy of human liberty
and regards the initiation of
coercion as illegitimate.
Furthermore, because of the
complexity of these issues, we
will be suggesting works by
social thinkers that treat the
issues.

Discussion of just and unjust
wars has a long history going
back to St. Augustine and St.
Thomas Aquinas. Bartolome de
las Casas, a legal scholar of the
16th-century Spanish
Renaissance, wrote an excellent
work (recently translated into
English and published) entitled
In Defense of the Indians,

which summed up centuries of
Aristotelian-Thomist discussion
of war and applied that wisdom
to analysing the Spanish
conquest of the New World.
For libertarian treatment of the
problem of just wars, see
Murray N. Rothbard's essay,
"War, Peace, and the State,"
reprinted in his Egalitarianism
as a Revolt against Nature.
The old non-libertarian
discussions of just and unjust
wars were written as moral
advice to the ruler. They
advised the individual soldier to
always obey orders. For the
classic libertarian reply to such
assumptions, see Henry David
Thoreau's essay "On Civil
Disobedience."
Have enlistees (and many
non-libertarians would add
draftees), as members of the
military, a duty which it would
be criminal to neglect?
Generally, libertarians are
extremely reluctant to endorse
criminal law enforcement of
supposed duties. Examination
of Anglo-American criminal law
shows that neglect of three
sorts of duty is punished.
First, there are duties which
are believed to make it less

costly for government officials
to run the governmental
apparatus. An example would
be the duty to pay taxes and
keep and provide information
relevant to the payment of
taxes. Another example is the
duty to register with and
cooperate with the system of
military conscription. Because
such duties are government
imposed duties to go along with
coercion, libertarians do not
recognize them as legitimate.
The second sort of duty that
is enforced is the duty
(reminiscent of the feudal era)
to carry out the customary
activities of some occupational
status. An example would be
the legal duty of hotel keepers
and other managers of public
accomodations to serve all
comers. Again, because such
duties are government-imposed
violations of rights, libertarians
do not recognize them as
legitimate.
Clearly, then, these two sorts
of duty are incompatible with
libertarian principles and
breaches of such duties should
not be punished via the
criminal law. Any arguments
for punishing deserters from the
military that depend on such
ideas of duty are arguments
against individual rights.
The third sort of duty that
is now enforced by the criminal
justice process is not really a
duty at all. The criminal law
punishes persons who put into
motion some force that invades
individual rights and then
neglect to halt the force which
they originally set in motion.
This law-enforcement is in
accord with the libertarian legal
axiom prohibiting aggression.
Although the law governing
such matters sometimes speaks
misleadingly of criminal
omissions or neglect, what is
really being punished is the
bringing forth of an emergency,
as when the pilot of a passenger

airplane bails out on a whim
leaving the passengers to crash.
This sort of enforced duty (if
you want to look at it that
way) governs a specific and
narrow set of criminal acts, but
does not apply to the broad
question of military employees
leaving their jobs.
At this point, it is fair to say
that libertarian principles are
incompatible with the
criminal-law justifications for
treating deserters as criminals,
that is, by jailing and
sometimes executing them as
the present law does. What
about treating deserters as
contract-violators (which
present Anglo-American law
does not do)? In part two, we
will consider this matter.

It is sometimes difficult to
persuade people that deserters
should receive amnesty. Many
people who can be persuaded
that draft-resisters deserve
vindication and by extension
that draftees who deserted also
deserve vindication, are
reluctant to accept the idea of
full amnesty for deserters.
The draft is an unusual,
almost alien, institution in
American life. In contrast,
prosecution for desertion and
other violations of the
discipline imposed in the
military are familiar features of
our historical landscape.
Not only do habits of mind
inhibit acceptance of amnesty
for deserters, but various
arguments offered by some
political and legal theorists also
seem to counsel against
amnesty for deserters.
Raising the topic of
desertion from the military sets
the stage for many difficult
desertion-related questions. Is
some sort of aggression or theft
inherent in desertion? Does
staying on the job during an
unjust war constitute aggression
by the individual soldier? Do
employees of the military have
a right to quit their jobs (just
war or not)?
On the other hand, if
they've enlisted for a five-year
hitch, have they taken on a
duty which it would be
criminal to neglect or have they
contractually given up their
right to quit? In touching on
these questions, we will be
evaluating the various possible
answers from the libertarian
ethical standpoint that upholds
the primacy of human liberty
and regards the initiation of
coercion as illegitimate.
Furthermore, because of the
complexity of these issues, we
will be suggesting works by
social thinkers that treat the
issues.

Discussion of just and unjust
wars has a long history going
back to St. Augustine and St.
Thomas Aquinas. Bartolome de
las Casas, a legal scholar of the
16th-century Spanish
Renaissance, wrote an excellent
work (recently translated into
English and published) entitled
In Defense of the Indians,

which summed up centuries of
Aristotelian-Thomist discussion
of war and applied that wisdom
to analysing the Spanish
conquest of the New World.
For libertarian treatment of the
problem of just wars, see
Murray N. Rothbard's essay,
"War, Peace, and the State,"
reprinted in his Egalitarianism
as a Revolt against Nature.
The old non-libertarian
discussions of just and unjust
wars were written as moral
advice to the ruler. They
advised the individual soldier to
always obey orders. For the
classic libertarian reply to such
assumptions, see Henry David
Thoreau's essay "On Civil
Disobedience."
Have enlistees (and many
non-libertarians would add
draftees), as members of the
military, a duty which it would
be criminal to neglect?
Generally, libertarians are
extremely reluctant to endorse
criminal law enforcement of
supposed duties. Examination
of Anglo-American criminal law
shows that neglect of three
sorts of duty is punished.
First, there are duties which
are believed to make it less

costly for government officials
to run the governmental
apparatus. An example would
be the duty to pay taxes and
keep and provide information
relevant to the payment of
taxes. Another example is the
duty to register with and
cooperate with the system of
military conscription. Because
such duties are government
imposed duties to go along with
coercion, libertarians do not
recognize them as legitimate.
The second sort of duty that
is enforced is the duty
(reminiscent of the feudal era)
to carry out the customary
activities of some occupational
status. An example would be
the legal duty of hotel keepers
and other managers of public
accomodations to serve all
comers. Again, because such
duties are government-imposed
violations of rights, libertarians
do not recognize them as
legitimate.
Clearly, then, these two sorts
of duty are incompatible with
libertarian principles and
breaches of such duties should
not be punished via the
criminal law. Any arguments
for punishing deserters from the
military that depend on such
ideas of duty are arguments
against individual rights.
The third sort of duty that
is now enforced by the criminal
justice process is not really a
duty at all. The criminal law
punishes persons who put into
motion some force that invades
individual rights and then
neglect to halt the force which
they originally set in motion.
This law-enforcement is in
accord with the libertarian legal
axiom prohibiting aggression.
Although the law governing
such matters sometimes speaks
misleadingly of criminal
omissions or neglect, what is
really being punished is the
bringing forth of an emergency,
as when the pilot of a passenger

airplane bails out on a whim
leaving the passengers to crash.
This sort of enforced duty (if
you want to look at it that
way) governs a specific and
narrow set of criminal acts, but
does not apply to the broad
question of military employees
leaving their jobs.
At this point, it is fair to say

punishes persons who put into
motion some force that invades
individual rights and then
neglect to halt the force which
they originally set in motion.
This law-enforcement is in
accord with the libertarian legal
axiom prohibiting aggression.
Although the law governing
such matters sometimes speaks
misleadingly of criminal
omissions or neglect, what is
really being punished is the
bringing forth of an emergency,
as when the pilot of a passenger

airplane bails out on a whim
leaving the passengers to crash.
This sort of enforced duty (if
you want to look at it that
way) governs a specific and
narrow set of criminal acts, but
does not apply to the broad
question of military employees
leaving their jobs.
At this point, it is fair to say
that libertarian principles are
incompatible with the
criminal-law justifications for
treating deserters as criminals,
that is, by jailing and
sometimes executing them as
the present law does. What
about treating deserters as
contract-violators (which
present Anglo-American law
does not do)? In part two, we
will consider this matter.

It is sometimes difficult to
persuade people that deserters
should receive amnesty. Many
people who can be persuaded
that draft-resisters deserve
vindication and by extension
that draftees who deserted also
deserve vindication, are
reluctant to accept the idea of
full amnesty for deserters.
The draft is an unusual,
almost alien, institution in
American life. In contrast,
prosecution for desertion and
other violations of the
discipline imposed in the
military are familiar features of
our historical landscape.
Not only do habits of mind
inhibit acceptance of amnesty
for deserters, but various
arguments offered by some
political and legal theorists also
seem to counsel against
amnesty for deserters.
Raising the topic of
desertion from the military sets
the stage for many difficult
desertion-related questions. Is
some sort of aggression or theft
inherent in desertion? Does
staying on the job during an
unjust war constitute aggression
by the individual soldier? Do
employees of the military have
a right to quit their jobs (just
war or not)?
On the other hand, if
they've enlisted for a five-year
hitch, have they taken on a
duty which it would be
criminal to neglect or have they
contractually given up their
right to quit? In touching on
these questions, we will be
evaluating the various possible
answers from the libertarian
ethical standpoint that upholds
the primacy of human liberty
and regards the initiation of
coercion as illegitimate.
Furthermore, because of the
complexity of these issues, we
will be suggesting works by
social thinkers that treat the
issues.

Discussion of just and unjust
wars has a long history going
back to St. Augustine and St.
Thomas Aquinas. Bartolome de
las Casas, a legal scholar of the
16th-century Spanish
Renaissance, wrote an excellent
work (recently translated into
English and published) entitled
In Defense of the Indians,

which summed up centuries of
Aristotelian-Thomist discussion
of war and applied that wisdom
to analysing the Spanish
conquest of the New World.
For libertarian treatment of the
problem of just wars, see
Murray N. Rothbard's essay,
"War, Peace, and the State,"
reprinted in his Egalitarianism
as a Revolt against Nature.
The old non-libertarian
discussions of just and unjust
wars were written as moral
advice to the ruler. They
advised the individual soldier to
always obey orders. For the
classic libertarian reply to such
assumptions, see Henry David
Thoreau's essay "On Civil
Disobedience."
Have enlistees (and many
non-libertarians would add
draftees), as members of the
military, a duty which it would
be criminal to neglect?
Generally, libertarians are
extremely reluctant to endorse
criminal law enforcement of
supposed duties. Examination
of Anglo-American criminal law
shows that neglect of three
sorts of duty is punished.
First, there are duties which
are believed to make it less

costly for government officials
to run the governmental
apparatus. An example would
be the duty to pay taxes and
keep and provide information
relevant to the payment of
taxes. Another example is the
duty to register with and
cooperate with the system of
military conscription. Because
such duties are government
imposed duties to go along with
coercion, libertarians do not
recognize them as legitimate.
The second sort of duty that
is enforced is the duty
(reminiscent of the feudal era)
to carry out the customary
activities of some occupational
status. An example would be
the legal duty of hotel keepers
and other managers of public
accomodations to serve all
comers. Again, because such
duties are government-imposed
violations of rights, libertarians
do not recognize them as
legitimate.
Clearly, then, these two sorts
of duty are incompatible with
libertarian principles and
breaches of such duties should
not be punished via the
criminal law. Any arguments
for punishing deserters from the
military that depend on such
ideas of duty are arguments
against individual rights.
The third sort of duty that
is now enforced by the criminal
justice process is not really a
duty at all. The criminal law
punishes persons who put into
motion some force that invades
individual rights and then
neglect to halt the force which
they originally set in motion.
This law-enforcement is in
