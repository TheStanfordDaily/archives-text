The halftime show the
Stanford Band subjected us to
during the Army-Stanford game
has got to be the lowest point
they could reach.
It bills itself as an
"uncensored" band, but
somehow I naively thought that
this bunch of adolescents could
censor itself.
Whoever they are, the
Hearsts are still a family
agonizing over a very bizarre
situation. When 1 pay my
money to have fun, I do not
want it to be over someone
else's tragedy.

I have just one question
concerning Jim Stump's
statement about the
prayer-meetings after the
football games ("Bug Me," Oct.
7): For which team does God
root?
