## Pinball: 'a game of the mind' Tresidder's wizards delight in a well-placed flipper shot 
### KEVIN OHLSON 
Pinball in Tresidder is like
visiting one of the local massage
parlors. Everyone pays the same
money —what you get out of
it depends on your experience.
There are some very
interesting things at these
pinball parlors. For a quarter of
a dollar, you can ride the "El
Dorado," score a "Triple
Strike" or pick the "Lucky
Ace."
Most students have their
favorite brands, with Bally
machines on top followed by
Williams. These are more
challenging and give a better
show, according to players.
Models from Gottlieb and
Chicago Coin are just "too
sensitive," they say.
The favorites are the more
complicated ones — moving
targets, more lights and more
ways to score. One machine can
save up to five balls, only to be
released by manipulation of the
proper points.
What is the thrill to be
found at Tresidder? A recent

Stanford grad says, "It's a game
in my mind. I'll punch in for
two players and play myself.
It's not the quarter, it's the
satisfaction of a well-placed
flipper shot."
A sophomore engineering
student says, "I've been playing
since I was six. It's just a game.
"It's a test of reaction and
anticipation," he continues.
"Sort of like ping-pong, because
you're moving about — at least
a little bit. But the reflexes and
concentration need to be more
acute."
He adds that "it relieves
studying; a break. You can tell
that pressure is blown off as
some folks pound on the glass
or spin around when they lose
the ball. Look at the heelmarks
and dents on the cash boxes."
An aficionado confesses that
he easily spends $6-10 per week
on his iniquity. He and others
lament the passing of the good
old days with its three games
for 25 cents. *
(These days the minimum
play is two games for a quarter,

with some machines indulging
only three balls per game,
instead of the usual five.)
"I'm from the East, and I
used to play on the Boardwalk
in Atlantic City for five cents a
game. But now I guess a bonus
play is more easily attainable,"
one fan notes.
Money hungry
Another table-side kibbutzer
likens the easier bonuses to
flat-rate tuition. "Once it's got
your money, the machine really
doesn't care at all what you
do."
Players confide that today's
machines are better and more
elaborate than in days past.
Bumpers are livelier and flippers
quicker.
Machines are also more
expensive. They cost from
$1200 to over $2000.
According to the shop foreman
at Automated Machines, who
own the "Tresidder Bandits,"
they also require constant
upkeep.
"Good machines should be
tuned about once per week. By

tuning I mean tightening
connections, checking the
rubber, cleaning the ball and
otherwise checking the unit for
proper operation."
He goes on to say that while
Bally, the consensus favorite,
makes good machines, quality
control from the factory is
poor; some models need shop
jobs when new. Most machines
are used a year before requiring
major service.
Tresidder rates "about
average" according to
Automated as far as revenue is
concerned, usually $50 — $100
per machine per week. A usual
split is 50 percent to the
machine owners and 50 percent
to the landlords.
Vandalism, though perhaps
not overt cheating, is on par
with other places. A few
players have confessed to
quarters on strings in their
earlier days but not in recent
years.

into on the back of the
machine. It would register 17
free games. It worked out well
until someone was almost
electrocuted." One ought to be
careful where one pats one's
finger.

Tilting the machine and
"body-English" are other
various forms of cheating,
though purists frown on them.
When asked what it took to
be good, one expert claims,

"you have to count on a lot of
four and five dollar nights.
After that, it's all worth it."
Even the best have bad
nights. "If you're good, a few
quarters will last all night," he
says. "If it's an unlucky night,
you can drop $2 in twenty
minutes."
Most enthusiasts say there's
been an increase in playing
since the release of the movie
Tummy. Indeed, there is a
Wizard machine at TMU. For
25 cents you can get two
rounds on Ann-Margaret's table.

Ace."
Most students have their
favorite brands, with Bally
machines on top followed by
Williams. These are more
challenging and give a better
show, according to players.
Models from Gottlieb and
Chicago Coin are just "too
sensitive," they say.
The favorites are the more
complicated ones — moving
targets, more lights and more
ways to score. One machine can
save up to five balls, only to be
released by manipulation of the
proper points.
What is the thrill to be
found at Tresidder? A recent

Stanford grad says, "It's a game
in my mind. I'll punch in for
two players and play myself.
It's not the quarter, it's the
satisfaction of a well-placed
flipper shot."
A sophomore engineering
student says, "I've been playing
since I was six. It's just a game.
"It's a test of reaction and
anticipation," he continues.
"Sort of like ping-pong, because
you're moving about — at least
a little bit. But the reflexes and
concentration need to be more
acute."
He adds that "it relieves
studying; a break. You can tell
that pressure is blown off as
some folks pound on the glass
or spin around when they lose
the ball. Look at the heelmarks
and dents on the cash boxes."
An aficionado confesses that
he easily spends $6-10 per week
on his iniquity. He and others
lament the passing of the good
old days with its three games
for 25 cents. *
(These days the minimum
play is two games for a quarter,

with some machines indulging
only three balls per game,
instead of the usual five.)
"I'm from the East, and I
used to play on the Boardwalk
in Atlantic City for five cents a
game. But now I guess a bonus
play is more easily attainable,"
one fan notes.
Money hungry
Another table-side kibbutzer
likens the easier bonuses to
flat-rate tuition. "Once it's got
your money, the machine really
doesn't care at all what you
do."
Players confide that today's
machines are better and more
elaborate than in days past.
Bumpers are livelier and flippers
quicker.
Machines are also more
expensive. They cost from
$1200 to over $2000.
According to the shop foreman
at Automated Machines, who
own the "Tresidder Bandits,"
they also require constant
upkeep.
"Good machines should be
tuned about once per week. By

tuning I mean tightening
connections, checking the
rubber, cleaning the ball and
otherwise checking the unit for
proper operation."
He goes on to say that while
Bally, the consensus favorite,
makes good machines, quality
control from the factory is
poor; some models need shop
jobs when new. Most machines
are used a year before requiring
major service.
Tresidder rates "about
average" according to
Automated as far as revenue is
concerned, usually $50 — $100
per machine per week. A usual
split is 50 percent to the
machine owners and 50 percent
to the landlords.
Vandalism, though perhaps
not overt cheating, is on par
with other places. A few
players have confessed to
quarters on strings in their
earlier days but not in recent
years.

Stanford grad says, "It's a game
in my mind. I'll punch in for
two players and play myself.
It's not the quarter, it's the
satisfaction of a well-placed
flipper shot."
A sophomore engineering
student says, "I've been playing
since I was six. It's just a game.
"It's a test of reaction and
anticipation," he continues.
"Sort of like ping-pong, because
you're moving about — at least
a little bit. But the reflexes and
concentration need to be more
acute."
He adds that "it relieves
studying; a break. You can tell
that pressure is blown off as
some folks pound on the glass
or spin around when they lose
the ball. Look at the heelmarks
and dents on the cash boxes."
An aficionado confesses that
he easily spends $6-10 per week
on his iniquity. He and others
lament the passing of the good
old days with its three games
for 25 cents. *
(These days the minimum
play is two games for a quarter,

with some machines indulging
only three balls per game,
instead of the usual five.)
"I'm from the East, and I
used to play on the Boardwalk
in Atlantic City for five cents a
game. But now I guess a bonus
play is more easily attainable,"
one fan notes.
Money hungry
Another table-side kibbutzer
likens the easier bonuses to
flat-rate tuition. "Once it's got
your money, the machine really
doesn't care at all what you
do."
Players confide that today's
machines are better and more
elaborate than in days past.
Bumpers are livelier and flippers
quicker.
Machines are also more
expensive. They cost from
$1200 to over $2000.
According to the shop foreman
at Automated Machines, who
own the "Tresidder Bandits,"
they also require constant
upkeep.
"Good machines should be
tuned about once per week. By

tuning I mean tightening
connections, checking the
rubber, cleaning the ball and
otherwise checking the unit for
proper operation."
He goes on to say that while
Bally, the consensus favorite,
makes good machines, quality
control from the factory is
poor; some models need shop
jobs when new. Most machines
are used a year before requiring
major service.
Tresidder rates "about
average" according to
Automated as far as revenue is
concerned, usually $50 — $100
per machine per week. A usual
split is 50 percent to the
machine owners and 50 percent
to the landlords.
Vandalism, though perhaps
not overt cheating, is on par
with other places. A few
players have confessed to
quarters on strings in their
earlier days but not in recent
years.

'SUCH A SUPPLE WRlST'—Students flock to the Tresidder billiard room to drop quarter after

study breaks. Since the release of the movie Tummy, pinball machines have soared in popularity.

careful where one pats one's
finger.

Tilting the machine and
"body-English" are other
various forms of cheating,
though purists frown on them.
When asked what it took to
be good, one expert claims,

"you have to count on a lot of
four and five dollar nights.
After that, it's all worth it."
Even the best have bad
nights. "If you're good, a few
quarters will last all night," he
says. "If it's an unlucky night,
you can drop $2 in twenty
minutes."
Most enthusiasts say there's
been an increase in playing
since the release of the movie
Tummy. Indeed, there is a
Wizard machine at TMU. For
25 cents you can get two
rounds on Ann-Margaret's table.

Pinball in Tresidder is like
visiting one of the local massage
parlors. Everyone pays the same
money —what you get out of
it depends on your experience.
There are some very
interesting things at these
pinball parlors. For a quarter of
a dollar, you can ride the "El
Dorado," score a "Triple
Strike" or pick the "Lucky
Ace."
Most students have their
favorite brands, with Bally
machines on top followed by
Williams. These are more
challenging and give a better
show, according to players.
Models from Gottlieb and
Chicago Coin are just "too
sensitive," they say.
The favorites are the more
complicated ones — moving
targets, more lights and more
ways to score. One machine can
save up to five balls, only to be
released by manipulation of the
proper points.
