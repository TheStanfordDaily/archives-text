In the movie "Jaws," one of
the last credit lines gives special
thanks to the biology
department at Stanford. What
did our bio department do for
>l Jaws"?—H. K.
We provided a "shark
specialist." His name is Leonard
Compagno, and he is currently
working on his Ph.D. in biology
here.
In an interview in the
summer Daily, Compagno said
that what Melville did for great
white whales, "Jaws" did for
great white sharks.
"The great shark in the
movie is sort of a summation of
a whole bunch of different
things that individual great
white sharks have done," he
said.
Catching sharks throughout
his boyhood, Compagno grew
up in San Francisco, and taught

at the California Academy of
Sciences before coming to
Stanford. When the art
directors of "Jaws" needed
some information on what
sharks looked like, the academy
suggested Compagno.
Compagno first advised the
art directors on the four-foot
clay model of the shark, and
then on the 24-foot rubber and
steel imitation shark that was
used in the movie. He also
helped director Steven Spielberg
interpret an "icthylogist's
personality." Compagno
maintains that he sees the
effect of his advice on the
character of Hooper in the film.
Compagno says he liked the
movie, but noted that some
scenes were inaccurate. An
example, he said, is the first
scene, where the girl is horribly
mauled.

"A shark that size could
have swallowed the girl
completely," Compagno said.
"But. . . it's a little bit better
to have some remains around
there. [Itj contributes to the
shock .. . having those gorpy
remains covered with crabs and
holding up a severed arm."

/ have been a post-doctoral
candidate here before, but this
year they arc registering
post-docs as students. Does this
mean that post-docs will now
have all rights and privileges of
students? Will they get student
discounts on tickets and gym
lockers? Will they be allowed to
vote in student elections and
hold student body
officer?—R. W.
Register Sally Mahoney said
that post-doctoral candidates
will have all student privileges,
including health services,
housing assignments in
Escondido Village and library
privileges. And Lee Rosenbaum,
ASSU president, said that
post-docs will be able to vote
and hold office.
Article I, section 101 of the
ASSU Constitution states,
"Registered students of
Stanford University shall be
defined to include all students
of Stanford University who
possess a valid certificate of
registration for the current
quarter . . . Only students with
a valid certificate of
registration . . . shall be eligible
to vote." Those eligible to vote
are also eligible to hold office,
Rosenbaum said.
