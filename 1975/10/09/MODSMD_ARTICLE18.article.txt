# Debaters get new coach
## 
### 
After going through four
coaches in five years and com
peting only in local tourna
ments, the Stanford debate team
is going to try to "turn it around
this year," according to debate
team president John Roos.
Attributing the debate team's
lack of success in the past to poor
coaching which caused many of
the better debaters to quit the
team, Roos said he hoped the
situation will change with the
arrival of the new coach, Brad
Ziff.
Ziff, who teaches an under
graduate special debate class,
was considered an outstanding
debater at Georgetown Univer
sity, Roos said.
Currently coaching a high
school debate team in Santa
Cruz, Ziff offered to help
Stanford's debaters when previ
ous team coach Dan Meek had to
leave, Roos said.
Roos noted that Ziff hopes for
several big wins this year to put
the Stanford team on an equal
footing with stronger debate
teams such as those from USC
and UCLA.
Although a lack of funds has
kept the team from competing
nationally in the past, Roos said
he hopes to raise more money
this year so the team can go to
national tournaments. He said
that the Stanford team is spon
soring a high school and a col
lege tournament here and may
also receive funding from pri
vate sources.
There are some 20 people on
the team now, but Roos said the
team is still looking for "good"
debaters. He expressed hopes
that more people will be signing
up now that the team is planning
to compete nationally.
