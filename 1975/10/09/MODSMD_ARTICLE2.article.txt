### MARK FUNK 
A man was arrested near the
Coffee House this afternoon on
charges stemming from an assault and
battery incident which took place last
week on Palm Drive.
Police Services Detective Kristin
Henderson, the arresting officer, said
a 28-year old male caucasian was
taken into custody around 3 p.m.
after the woman involved in the Palm
Drive incident spotted him in the
Tresidder Union courtyard.
Last week, the suspect allegedly
attacked the woman while she was
bicycling on Palm Drive. "The girl
was surprised when the man advanced
on her and knocked her off her
bike," Henderson said, who was on
the case from the beginning. "He
made menacing gestures towards her
and then ran away."
According to Henderson, no

charges will be filed against the
subject, who is not a Stanford
student. She said, however, that he
has been committed to the Valley
Medical Center and placed under
observation after completion of a
battery of psychiatric tests
administered to him yesterday
afternoon.
The suspect will be held at Valley
Medical for 72 hours and could be
released after that period if doctors
feel it is warranted.
Henderson said she evaluated the
individual after speaking to him and
felt hospitalization would be an
appropriate course of action.
An eyewitness to the arrest,
Malcolm Young, manager of the
Coffee House, said the subject was
seated at a table in the courtyard at
the time of the arrest. "It was done
very quickly," Young said.
