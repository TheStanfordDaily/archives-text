# Biology seniors offer information to students
## 
### ANNETTE HARNESS 
cheap cup of coffee and a
friendly word or two are there if
you want them, hut the Biology
Bridge can offer a lot more to in
terested biology majors.
The Biology Bridge is a stu
dent advisory committee which
volunteers information on clas
ses, professors and job and
career opportunities.
Modeled after the Human
Biology department, where all
advisors are students, the Biol
ogy Bridge is manned by six
seniors, each interested in a dif
ferent branch of biology.
The advisory committee was
set up in spring quarter last year
with the goal of improving
communication between stu
dents and faculty.
Complaints
According to Jody McVittie,
one of the founders of the Biol
ogy Bridge, students com
plained about "an unapproach
able faculty, and the faculty
complained about students who
never came during their office
hours."
To help eliminate such
student-faculty difficulties,
McVittie and the other Biology
Bridge advisors, Mary Artero,

Kon Burton, Mike Murr, David
Milch and Tom Payne, inter
viewed every member of the
biology department and com
piled a list of the professors' of
fice hours and telephone num
bers.
The advisors also have a book
describing each professor's time
committments to under
graduates. honors programs, di
rected research projects, area or
areas of specialization and other
such information.
Weekly visits
Letters to graduate schools
and businesses, plus a weekly
visit to SCIRE (Student Center
for Innovation in Research and
Education). SWOPSI (Stanford
Workshops on Political and So
cial Issues), the medical center,
and the Career Planning and
Placement Center provide
further information which Biol
ogy Bridge advisors can consult
when trying to help students.
McVittie said that Bridge ad

visors also draw on personal ex
perience in offering information
to interested students.
The go.il of the Biology Bridge
is not to "sell" the biology de
partment, but to supplement the
faculty advising system. Mi:\'it
tie said.
Kun-around
According to Milch. Bridge
advisors often help students
who feel they have gotten the
run-around from traditional av
enues such as the Academic In
formation Center, department
secretaries and faculty advisors.
The Biology Bridge also offers
social services, including dinner
discussions. .1 volleyball social
hour and .1 relaxed social atmos
phere in the office, said Artero.
Stressing the importance ol
the Biology Bridge's existence.
Milch said. "It's there, an office
with fellow students, it's leis
urely unacademic. and you can
talk about whatever's on your
mind."
