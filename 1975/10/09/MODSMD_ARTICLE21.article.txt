Ford seeks airline competition
WASHINGTON — President Ford asked Congress
yesterday to increase competition among the scheduled
airlines and give the American public the "best possible
service at the lowest possible price."
The President submitted legislation to grant the
airlines greater flexibility to raise or lower ticket prices
on individual routes and more authority to start or stop
service between cities.
The proposal would sharply curtail the authority of
the Civil Aeronautics Board over airline fares and routes.
It would make the CAB's primary responsibility one of
serving the public — while diminishing the board's
mission of promoting the airlines.
Senate rejects energy plan
WASHINGTON — The Senate refused by a 10-vote
margin yesterday to accept a compromise energy plan
that would raise natural gas prices in exchange for a
rollback of domestic oil rates.
The 55-45 vote against the proposal indicated that
Democrats and Republicans still are far apart in their
efforts to write a long-range energy policy. And the
defeat raised questions about whether Congress will be
able to avert a severe natural gas shortage forecast in 14
states this winter.
Rejection of the amendment, sponsored by Sen.
Adlai E. Stevenson 111 (D-Ili.) came minutes after the
Senate, on a 54-45 vote, defeated a liberal attempt to
break up the nation's largest oil and gas companies into
firms with an interest in only one segment of the
petroleum industry.
Lebanese violence flares up
BEIRUT — Street fighting ravaged Beirut yesterday
after a five-day lull, and a state radio announcer said,
"We are losing Lebanon. Blood maniacs are at large."
Kuwait called for an urgent meeting of Arab foreign
ministers to discuss the deteriorating situation, and
Lebanese Premier Bashid Karami said he welcomed the
call.
The governor of Beirut imposed a citywide
dusk-to-dawn curfew. But mortars and bombs continued
to explode into the night across Beirut and in northern
Lebanon.
Dozens of cease-fires have been broken since the
fighting started in April. The battling has lead to the
death of about 6000 persons.
The 18,000-man Lebanese army has not intervened in

the struggle, which reflects a political and economic
crisis — Moslems seeking a greater share of power and a
fairer distribution of wealth from the wealthy Christian
establishment. Both sides have private militias numbering
in the thousands.
Internal security forces have been unable to stop the
chaos which has cost the reeling Lebanese economy,
once one of the healthiest in the Middle East even
without oil revenues, an estimated $2.5 billion.
SLA papers explain kidnaping
SAN FRANCISCO — A previously secret Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) manuscript says Patricia Hearst
was kidnaped in an attempt to force the release of two
captured SLA "soldiers" and to expose the wealth of
the Hearst family, the San Francisco Examiner reported
yesterday.
In its copyrighted story, the newspaper quoted at
length from documents it said were removed last month
from the home of SLA members Emily and William
Harris. The Examiner did not explain how it had gained
access to the papers.
The newspaper said authorities believe the SLA
manuscript to be the work of several authors, perhaps
collaborating on a new SLA manifesto. The documents
make several references to imprisoned SLA members
Russell Little and Joseph Remiro.
"One of the objectives of the kidnaping was to test
how much bargaining power we needed to get our
comrades released," it said.
Death toll rises in Spanish fighting
BARCELONA, Spain — Nervous police in
guerrilla-harassed Barcelona opened fire on a carload of
innocent passers-by and a police early yesterday,
killing three civilians and two of their own officers just
minutes after terrorists fired into the police barracks.
Another policeman and a retired policeman in the
passing car were seriously wounded in Spain's bloodiest
day of violence this year.
It raised the death toll to eight policeman and four
civilians in seven days of political violence that began
after the government of Gen. Francisco Franco executed
five men convicted of killing police.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today. Low tonight in 50s. High today
60s to low 70s. Chance of rain 70 percent today and 60

Ford seeks airline competition
WASHINGTON — President Ford asked Congress
yesterday to increase competition among the scheduled
airlines and give the American public the "best possible
service at the lowest possible price."
The President submitted legislation to grant the
airlines greater flexibility to raise or lower ticket prices
on individual routes and more authority to start or stop
service between cities.
The proposal would sharply curtail the authority of
the Civil Aeronautics Board over airline fares and routes.
It would make the CAB's primary responsibility one of
serving the public — while diminishing the board's
mission of promoting the airlines.
Senate rejects energy plan
WASHINGTON — The Senate refused by a 10-vote
margin yesterday to accept a compromise energy plan
that would raise natural gas prices in exchange for a
rollback of domestic oil rates.
The 55-45 vote against the proposal indicated that
Democrats and Republicans still are far apart in their
efforts to write a long-range energy policy. And the
defeat raised questions about whether Congress will be
able to avert a severe natural gas shortage forecast in 14
states this winter.
Rejection of the amendment, sponsored by Sen.
Adlai E. Stevenson 111 (D-Ili.) came minutes after the
Senate, on a 54-45 vote, defeated a liberal attempt to
break up the nation's largest oil and gas companies into
firms with an interest in only one segment of the
petroleum industry.
Lebanese violence flares up
BEIRUT — Street fighting ravaged Beirut yesterday
after a five-day lull, and a state radio announcer said,
"We are losing Lebanon. Blood maniacs are at large."
Kuwait called for an urgent meeting of Arab foreign
ministers to discuss the deteriorating situation, and
Lebanese Premier Bashid Karami said he welcomed the
call.
The governor of Beirut imposed a citywide
dusk-to-dawn curfew. But mortars and bombs continued
to explode into the night across Beirut and in northern
Lebanon.
Dozens of cease-fires have been broken since the
fighting started in April. The battling has lead to the
death of about 6000 persons.
The 18,000-man Lebanese army has not intervened in

the struggle, which reflects a political and economic
crisis — Moslems seeking a greater share of power and a
fairer distribution of wealth from the wealthy Christian
establishment. Both sides have private militias numbering
in the thousands.
Internal security forces have been unable to stop the
chaos which has cost the reeling Lebanese economy,
once one of the healthiest in the Middle East even
without oil revenues, an estimated $2.5 billion.
SLA papers explain kidnaping
SAN FRANCISCO — A previously secret Symbionese
Liberation Army (SLA) manuscript says Patricia Hearst
was kidnaped in an attempt to force the release of two
captured SLA "soldiers" and to expose the wealth of
the Hearst family, the San Francisco Examiner reported
yesterday.
In its copyrighted story, the newspaper quoted at
length from documents it said were removed last month
from the home of SLA members Emily and William
Harris. The Examiner did not explain how it had gained
access to the papers.
The newspaper said authorities believe the SLA
manuscript to be the work of several authors, perhaps
collaborating on a new SLA manifesto. The documents
make several references to imprisoned SLA members
Russell Little and Joseph Remiro.
"One of the objectives of the kidnaping was to test
how much bargaining power we needed to get our
comrades released," it said.
Death toll rises in Spanish fighting
BARCELONA, Spain — Nervous police in
guerrilla-harassed Barcelona opened fire on a carload of
innocent passers-by and a police early yesterday,
killing three civilians and two of their own officers just
minutes after terrorists fired into the police barracks.
Another policeman and a retired policeman in the
passing car were seriously wounded in Spain's bloodiest
day of violence this year.
It raised the death toll to eight policeman and four
civilians in seven days of political violence that began
after the government of Gen. Francisco Franco executed
five men convicted of killing police.
