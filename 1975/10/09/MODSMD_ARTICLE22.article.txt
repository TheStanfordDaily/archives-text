# Physicists gain new knowledge
## Power lines disrupt atmosphere 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
New findings from a
University-sponsored research station
in Antarctica have revealed that
high-tension electric power lines cause
electrons to "rain" down from the
upper atmosphere.
The recently released report may
have far-reaching implications for
such diverse fields as electrical
engineering, meteorology and
astrophysics, experts say.
Experiments designed by Electrical
Engineering Prof. Robert A. Helliwell
and carried out by a four-member
team directed by John Katsufrakis at
the Stiple Research Station,
Antarctica, have revealed that
radiation belts surrounding the Earth
"are now seen to be inadvertently
under the control of man," according
to Helliwell. Helliwell said that
radiation from power lines is causing
electrons to precipitate into the
ionosphere (a layer of the upper
atmosphere characterized by the
presence of charged particles) from
the magnetosphere (Earth's magnetic
field).
"The huge grid [of power-lines] in
the eastern U.S. and Canada appears
to be injecting significant amounts of
radiation into the magnetosphere
which is partially controlling the
radiation belts," he added.
The ionosphere, which starts about
25 miles above the surface of the
Earth, is known to play a crucial role
in radio-communications. More
importantly, though less well
established, is the role the
ionosphere plays in determing the
weather of the lower atmosphere.
With the ability to change the
composition of the ionosphere,
scientists conceivably might be able
to change global weather patterns.
But Helliwell said these
possibilities are "pure speculation."

"It is possible that because of our
findings, people from other
disciplines may be able to obtain a
better understanding of phenomena
within their own disciplines," he said.
He noted, for example, that the
power-line radiation effects have
important implications for several
fields of physics.
"All of the particle physics people
and all of the fields that are
connected in any way with radiation
belt physics must now look at these
wave effects, asking themselves what's
going on here," he said. "They will
have to re-examine their earlier data
in the light of this new factor.
"Further study of the harmonic
wave effects could lead to a better
understanding of fundamental plasma
physics, to improved VLF
communication techniques, to new

diagnostic tools to probe the
magnetosphere and to new
modification experiments in the
ionosphere. The wave effects must
occur widely in other parts of the
universe, and hence may be of
interest to astrophysicists as well."
Stiple Station was first set up with
a 100,000-watt transmitter to
investigate the effect of
very-low-frequency (VLF) radiation
on high-energy particles, particularly
electrons, in the magnetosphere.
VLF radiation was previously
shown to have the same effect as
power line radiation, causing
electrons to "rain down" into the
ionosphere.
This phenomenon, when it occurs
spontaneously in nature, is associated
with aurora borealis or "northern
lights."
