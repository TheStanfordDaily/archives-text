If Ludwig von Beethoven were writing his
"Fifth" today at Stanford, he might be using a
computer to help him compose.
The Music Department's new Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics is
currently developing a computer which a
composer can program to produce a musical
composition.
Two grants totaling more than $400,000
from the National Science Foundation and the
National Endowment for the Arts financed the
center at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
on Arastradero Road.
An interdisciplinary team of music,
computer and psychology specialists will utilize
a new device — a digital signal processor — to
do research in acoustics and auditory
perception, Adjunct Music Prof. John
Chowning, co-principal investigator of the
program, said.
The processor will compute the composer's
program fast enough to allow him to hear what
he is playing, according to Chowning.
"In our center the composer will exercise
control over his musical program just as the
composer in traditional practice exercises his
control over an orchestra. With our computer
he has a more complex system of sounds to
experiment with," he said.
Chowning remarked, reassuringly, that
despite the sophisticated talents of the
computer, a person will still have to be the
composer.

"There is a myth that computers will be
'writing' music. But the computer is merely a
musical tool just as an organ is," Chowning
said.
Added Chowning, "Our fundamental concern
is the development of musical compositions.
There are many compositions which cannot be
realized without the substantial contributions of
scientific discoveries in the fields of computer
science and electronic acoustics."

The computer music center will work closely
with composer Pierre Boulez, former conductor
of the New York Philharmonic orchestra, at the
Institute de Recherche et de Coordination
Acoustique/Musique in Paris. The institute is
being built as part of the Centre Beaubourg.
Co-directors of the Stanford project are
computer specialist James Moorer, psychologist
John Grey, Music Prof. Leland Smith, composer
Leon Loren Rush and Chowning.

The processor will compute the composer's
program fast enough to allow him to hear what
he is playing, according to Chowning.
"In our center the composer will exercise
control over his musical program just as the
composer in traditional practice exercises his
control over an orchestra. With our computer
he has a more complex system of sounds to
experiment with," he said.
Chowning remarked, reassuringly, that
despite the sophisticated talents of the
computer, a person will still have to be the
composer.

"There is a myth that computers will be
'writing' music. But the computer is merely a
musical tool just as an organ is," Chowning
said.
Added Chowning, "Our fundamental concern
is the development of musical compositions.
There are many compositions which cannot be
realized without the substantial contributions of
scientific discoveries in the fields of computer
science and electronic acoustics."

The computer music center will work closely
with composer Pierre Boulez, former conductor
of the New York Philharmonic orchestra, at the
Institute de Recherche et de Coordination
Acoustique/Musique in Paris. The institute is
being built as part of the Centre Beaubourg.
Co-directors of the Stanford project are
computer specialist James Moorer, psychologist
John Grey, Music Prof. Leland Smith, composer
Leon Loren Rush and Chowning.
