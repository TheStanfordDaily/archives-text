# House okays U.S. technicians in Sinai
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The House
gave overwhelming approval last night
to a plan which commits 200
American technicians to monitor the
Sinai peace accord.
Before final approval, the House
approved an amendment specifying
that the resolution gives the President
no power to introduce U.S. military
force into the Middle East that is not
already there.
The commitment of U.S.
technicians was approved 341-69 and
sent to the Senate where final action
on the plan was put off until
tomorrow.
The amendment, introduced by
Rep. Bob Eckhardt (D-Tex.), was
approved 124-71. It was accepted by
supporters of the resolution â€”
including Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio),
who said it would not prevent Ford
from using military forces to rescue
the technicians should that be
essential.
Congressional leaders had hoped to
give the resolution final approval by
today, but the Senate put off final
action until tomorrow.
Congress should make clear,

Eckhardt told the House, that it was
not writing anything comparable to
the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that
committed U.S. forces to the
Vietnam war.
He said, "we want to make it clear
we have not given blanket authority
to go to war as a nation."
The House also overwhelmingly
rejected a two-year limit on the
technicians' stint in the Sinai.
Any danger of the technicians
involving the United States in a
Middle East war "is very remote,"
House International Relations
Chairman Thomas E. Morgan (D-Pa.)
told the House.
An almost identical resolution,
including the condition that
technicians be pulled out immediately
if war erupts, is scheduled for Senate
consideration today and tomorrow.
Morgan said the technicians would
be protected by 5000 U.N. troops in
the buffer zone, and Rep. Dante B.
Fascell (D-Fla.) said they'll be the
first to know of war. "We think
they'll be smart enough to get out of
the way."
"But what if your prediction is

wrong?" persisted Rep. Henry B.
Gonzales (D-Tex.). "Will the United
States be obligated to go in and
rescue them?"
Fascell replied that that would be
a decision the President would have
to make at the time.
"There is that small element of
gamble, there's no question about it,"
Fascell said.
But Morgan and other leaders said
that while that risk is remote,
Congress' rejection of the technicians
commitment would lead quickly to
renewed Egyptian-Israeli war.
An effort by Reps. Paul Findley

(R-Ill.) and Clement Zablocki
(D-Wis.) to limit authority for the
U.S. technicians to two years was
rejected 287 to 122 after opponents
said it would require renegotiation of
the entire Sinai accord.
Rep. John Anderson (R-Ill.) said
that because Israel is waiting for
Congress approval before beginning
the Sinai disengagement timetable
that was to have started last Sunday,
"There is some urgency.
"Every further day of delay does
jeopardize the entire agreement,"
Anderson said.
