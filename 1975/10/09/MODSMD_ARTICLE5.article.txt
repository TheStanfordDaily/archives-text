## 
### TIM W. FERGUSON 
Business School Prof. George P.
Shultz is being "seriously considered"
by President Ford to head up an
overhauled Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), United Press
International (UPI) reported
yesterday.
UPI quoted sources as saying
Shultz has the "strong personality"
reportedly desired in a new CIA
director.
Reached at home last night, Shultz
said, "All I have heard is what is on
the TV and the radio." He said no
government official had contacted
him.
"I'm very content at Stanford. I
have no intentions of leaving this
university," the two-time cabinet
member said. Pressed on whether he

would refuse a CIA post however,
Shultz said, "I don't think it would
be proper to comment on a job that
hasn't been offered."
Well qualified
Both Ford and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger reportedly feel
Shultz has the proper qualifications
for the CIA post, according to UPI.
Shultz, 55, is considered an able
administrator, is respected on Capitol
Hill and would not suffer partisan
objections because he has "no
political ambitions," UPl's sources
reported.
Ford is scheduled to reveal shortly
a shake-up of the intelligence agency
in the wake of recent revelations of
its allegedly widespread illegal
activities. No intention to replace
current CIA Director William Colby

has been announced publicly,
however.
Heads Bechtel, too
Shultz was appointed professor of
management and public policy at the
Business School on Sept. 1, 1974. He
also is president of the Bechtel Corp.
of San Francisco.
A graduate of Princeton University
with a Ph.D. in industrial economics
from MIT, he was named secretary of
labor by President Richard Nixon in
December 1968. He later became
director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget and treasury
secretary before leaving the
government in May 1974.
Shultz had stayed on at MIT as an
assistant professor of industrial
relations after gaining his doctorate in
1949. But in 1955 he was granted
leave to serve as senior staff
economist for the President's Council
of Economic Advisers.
He was a consultant on industrial
economics and labor relations to
government, labor and business
groups from 1959 until his first
cabinet appointment in 1968.
Associates have described Shultz as
a hard worker who would arrive at
his desk at 7:30 a.m. and often
return to work in the evening.
He currently is Ford's
representative to planning sessions for
an international monetary conference
in Paris later this year.
Shultz is married to the former
Helena Maria O'Brien, whom he met
while she was an Army nurse in
Hawaii during World War 11. They
have five children.

Shultz has the proper qualifications
for the CIA post, according to UPI.
Shultz, 55, is considered an able
administrator, is respected on Capitol
Hill and would not suffer partisan
objections because he has "no
political ambitions," UPl's sources
reported.
Ford is scheduled to reveal shortly
a shake-up of the intelligence agency
in the wake of recent revelations of
its allegedly widespread illegal
activities. No intention to replace
current CIA Director William Colby

has been announced publicly,
however.
Heads Bechtel, too
Shultz was appointed professor of
management and public policy at the
Business School on Sept. 1, 1974. He
also is president of the Bechtel Corp.
of San Francisco.
A graduate of Princeton University
with a Ph.D. in industrial economics
from MIT, he was named secretary of
labor by President Richard Nixon in
December 1968. He later became
director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget and treasury
secretary before leaving the
government in May 1974.
Shultz had stayed on at MIT as an
assistant professor of industrial
relations after gaining his doctorate in
1949. But in 1955 he was granted
leave to serve as senior staff
economist for the President's Council
of Economic Advisers.
He was a consultant on industrial
economics and labor relations to
government, labor and business
groups from 1959 until his first
cabinet appointment in 1968.
Associates have described Shultz as
a hard worker who would arrive at
his desk at 7:30 a.m. and often
return to work in the evening.
He currently is Ford's
representative to planning sessions for
an international monetary conference
in Paris later this year.
Shultz is married to the former
Helena Maria O'Brien, whom he met
while she was an Army nurse in
Hawaii during World War 11. They
have five children.
Business School Prof. George P.
Shultz is being "seriously considered"
by President Ford to head up an
overhauled Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), United Press
International (UPI) reported
yesterday.
UPI quoted sources as saying
Shultz has the "strong personality"
reportedly desired in a new CIA
director.
Reached at home last night, Shultz
said, "All I have heard is what is on
the TV and the radio." He said no
government official had contacted
him.
"I'm very content at Stanford. I
have no intentions of leaving this
university," the two-time cabinet
member said. Pressed on whether he

would refuse a CIA post however,
Shultz said, "I don't think it would
be proper to comment on a job that
hasn't been offered."
Well qualified
Both Ford and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger reportedly feel
Shultz has the proper qualifications
for the CIA post, according to UPI.
