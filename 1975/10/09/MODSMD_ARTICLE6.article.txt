# Planned opening in 1976
## Old Barn faces renovation 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
The Old Stanford Bam will be
renovated this year, announced Bruce
Ricks, general partner of Stanford
Barn Enterprises, new owners of the
barn-turned-shopping facility.
"The major thrust of our work
will be to expose more of the original
structure of the Barn including the
brickwork, the original walls, beams
and ceilings," Ricks announced.
Construction of small offices,
service businesses and retail shops on
the second floor began in August
1975 and is expected to be
completed by January 1976.
Ricks gave no estimate of the cost
of renovation except to say it would
be "a lot." He did not reveal the
sources of his financing.
Building plans
Architect Ray Rector plans to
open the second-floor ceiling to let in
air and light from three rooftop
cupolas, add a decorative stairway
within the main entrance, redesign
the entrance and add about 3600
square feet.
"We're sand-blasting the paint off
the bricks. We want to make the
inside look like the outside," said
Ricks.

"In addition, we'd like to add a
sit-down restaurant where people can
be served," Ricks said. "We feel it is
very important to maintain in the
Barn a variety of restaurants serving
inexpensive but good food."
The Barn would contain executive
office space with a centralized
secretarial answering service. Ricks
noted that there are very few offices
of this type in the Palo Alto area.
Merchants' views
Most retailers in the Barn are
"looking forward to the change very
much," according to John McGrath,
Stanford Barn Merchants Association
president. He said the actual
construction activity would show
retailers that "something's being
done."
Sandy Warren, owner of Trudie's
dressmaking shop, says her customers
"think it's great." Charlene
McLoughlin of Stanford Florists
thinks "it's about time for a change."
She said business would not be
adversely affected because "most

shoppers come wih a specific purpose
in mind."
The historic brick structure,
located across from Saks Fifth
Avenue in the Stanford Shopping
Center, served as a winery for Leland
Stanford. The three-story building
became a dairy barn in 1910 and
later served as offices for the
American Breeder's Association. It
has been a shopping facility since
1961 and currently houses 11
commercial, two financial and six
food outlets.
Walkway planned
Planned for the outside is a trellis
walkway extending from the second
floor out over the outdoor dining
area.
"It would be a great place for
musicians to entertain diners. You
could even have fashion shows on it,"
said Ricks.
Rector also designed Vintage
1870, a winery in Yountville, nine
miles north of Napa, which is now a
specialty shopping center.

service businesses and retail shops on
the second floor began in August
1975 and is expected to be
completed by January 1976.
Ricks gave no estimate of the cost
of renovation except to say it would
be "a lot." He did not reveal the
sources of his financing.
Building plans
Architect Ray Rector plans to
open the second-floor ceiling to let in
air and light from three rooftop
cupolas, add a decorative stairway
within the main entrance, redesign
the entrance and add about 3600
square feet.
"We're sand-blasting the paint off
the bricks. We want to make the
inside look like the outside," said
Ricks.

"In addition, we'd like to add a
sit-down restaurant where people can
be served," Ricks said. "We feel it is
very important to maintain in the
Barn a variety of restaurants serving
inexpensive but good food."
The Barn would contain executive
office space with a centralized
secretarial answering service. Ricks
noted that there are very few offices
of this type in the Palo Alto area.
Merchants' views
Most retailers in the Barn are
"looking forward to the change very
much," according to John McGrath,
Stanford Barn Merchants Association
president. He said the actual
construction activity would show
retailers that "something's being
done."
Sandy Warren, owner of Trudie's
dressmaking shop, says her customers
"think it's great." Charlene
McLoughlin of Stanford Florists
thinks "it's about time for a change."
She said business would not be
adversely affected because "most

shoppers come wih a specific purpose
in mind."
The historic brick structure,
located across from Saks Fifth
Avenue in the Stanford Shopping
Center, served as a winery for Leland
Stanford. The three-story building
became a dairy barn in 1910 and
later served as offices for the
American Breeder's Association. It
has been a shopping facility since
1961 and currently houses 11
commercial, two financial and six
food outlets.
Walkway planned
Planned for the outside is a trellis
walkway extending from the second
floor out over the outdoor dining
area.
"It would be a great place for
musicians to entertain diners. You
could even have fashion shows on it,"
said Ricks.
Rector also designed Vintage
1870, a winery in Yountville, nine
miles north of Napa, which is now a
specialty shopping center.
The Old Stanford Bam will be
renovated this year, announced Bruce
Ricks, general partner of Stanford
Barn Enterprises, new owners of the
barn-turned-shopping facility.
"The major thrust of our work
will be to expose more of the original
structure of the Barn including the
brickwork, the original walls, beams
and ceilings," Ricks announced.
Construction of small offices,
service businesses and retail shops on
the second floor began in August
1975 and is expected to be
completed by January 1976.
