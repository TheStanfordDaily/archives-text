# Willow Road plan favors widening
## 
### KEVIN CHILDRESS 
No significant environmental
impact would result if Willow Road
were widened from El Camino Real
to the Sand Hill-Santa Cruz
intersection, according to a report
released this week to Palo Alto and
Stanford officials by the Environment
Impact Planning (EIP) Corp. of San
Francisco.
The Palo Alto Department of
Public Works retained EIP at a cost
of $58,400 to assess various effects
of the widening project, particularly
on traffic and pollution in the area.
EIP concluded, "The number of
east-west trips between El Camino
Real and Junipero Serra Blvd. would
not change significantly . . . The net
effect on regional air quality would
be negligible."
The major impact of the project
would be loss of open space in a tree
grove north of the Stanford Shopping
Center. The widening would also
cause noise levels, by 1990, to exceed
the maximum recommended level in
nearby residences and in four acres of
the Stanford Golf Course bordering
the route. However, these excesses
would not be large, the report stated.
Few adverse effects
The report added that the project
"would not significantly affect
wildlife, provided adequate
precautions are taken." It noted that
the grove would lose from a few to
more than 30 trees (depending on
which road alignment is chosen), and

that possibly up to 340 parking
places at the shopping center would
vanish.
The comprehensiveness and
accuracy of the EIP report were
discussed and endorsed at a Palo Alto
Planning Commission meeting last
night.
"All alternatives would benefit the
shopping center by reducing traffic
on Arboretum Road and through
traffic in the parking lot," the report
said.
University support
The University "supports the
project in principle," John Breedlove,
land resources manager, told the
Daily yesterday.
"As far as we're concerned, the
report is complete," Breedlove added.
The University will reserve final
judgment "until the route is decided
upon." he said. Discussions about the
route begin in two weeks at the next
planning commission meeting.
The report, replete with 52 figures
and 16 tables, cited three options
concerning the area adjacent to the
road: leave it alone, develop it
commercially (as a garden or
restaurant) or develop a park or trail
system.
The plan called the probability for
the resurrection of the once-proposed
Willow Freeway, whose plan was
dropped in 1972, "extremely low,"
and noted that California Department
of Transportation officials regard the
freewav as "a dead issue."
