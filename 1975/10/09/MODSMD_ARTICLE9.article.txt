# Buckley's guile

William F. Buckley
demonstrated in his Memorial
Auditorium speech Friday that
he thinks no morality can
support a free society; hence,
he does not support such a
society but advocates
censorship, governmental
suppression of opposing
political groups and keeping us
clean of our sins.
The fact is that only one
moral position can defend
liberty — Buckley's allegation
to the contrary. This morality
is classical egoism.
It is the view that each
person should pursue his own
self-interest, and it has a very
specific view of the self which
does not taint it in favor of sin
from the start, before a person
has grown to an age of
responsibility. This self is what
we share in essentials, the self
of a rational soul.
The self-interest we should
all pursue is the interest of one
with a rational soul, one that
can, if he chooses, pursue a
thoughtful life. The purpose of
doing so, of pursuing a
thoughtful life, is that only that
course of conduct which
accords with reason can make
us happy.
This happiness that we
should all pursue in life is not
the happiness of thrillseeking,
hedonism, or fun-chasing. It is
the happiness that accords with
human nature, the happiness
that comes from living as a
human being.
Natural rights
The libertarian political
theory is based on a doctrine of
human rights. These natural
human rights are the proper
conditions for people to live in
their communities. In the
Declaration of Independence we
have them described as the
rights to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. This
description attests to my point
that the moral foundation of a
free society is egoism, since the
rights to life, liberty and,
especially, the pursuit of
happiness would make no sense
unless it would be good for
each person to live in liberty to
pursue his happiness.
Both the Buckley
conservative and the
Marx-socialist creeds offer
values to be pursued, something
that Hayek's system lacks. So
both Buckley and Marx touch a
deep need in the human soul.
But they offer not food but
poison as the nourishment of
that soul.

Buckley must know this by
now — he has friends and
colleagues who espouse this
moral case, not to mention his
familiarity with that widely
abused advocate of the moral
case for capitalism, Ayn Rand.
So why did Buckley choose to
hammer away at Hayek in his
speech?
If there are intellectuals
guilty of fraud and deception
on the left, there are plenty of
that kind on the right. And
while mostly entertaining
enough, due to his skill as
rhetorician, Buckley stands
within the right-wing faction of
our political spectrum as the
intellectual deceiver. He believes
that by showing admiration for
the moral courage of a
Solzhenitsyn he might hide his
own cowardice, but for myself
1 don't think he should enjoy
that delusion.
Not 'incomprehensible'
A final note on Buckley's
style. As the Daily reported on
Monday, Oct. 6, "Buckley's
address rambled for fifty
minutes. ..But several
people also said about this talk
that it came close to being
"incomprehensible." This is not
so. Buckley's talk had a very
clear direction and intention —
to persuade his audience that
not Marxist socialism, nor yet
Hayek's libertarianism but his
own theistic conservatism is the
proper political ideology for
human beings.
The rambling was, I submit,
quite intentional. He aimed to
bamboozle, befuddle and
deceive those who heard him
into thinking that the ideology
he advocates is the most
profound of the alternatives
competing for acceptance. One
way to instill the belief in
profundity is by the use of
complex polemics.
Yet in the end Buckley is
but a sophist. He can use all
the tricks of the logician, the
rhetorician, the PR man, and
the intellectual for his
prejudiced, unexamined goal,
namely to capture us as slaves
of his detestible anti-human
point of view. Mind you, this is
done with the utmost sincerity
— malice is not in Buckley's
heart, I am convinced. But
malice is not the only form of
vice.

support a free society; hence,
he does not support such a
society but advocates
censorship, governmental
suppression of opposing
political groups and keeping us
clean of our sins.
The fact is that only one
moral position can defend
liberty — Buckley's allegation
to the contrary. This morality
is classical egoism.
It is the view that each
person should pursue his own
self-interest, and it has a very
specific view of the self which
does not taint it in favor of sin
from the start, before a person
has grown to an age of
responsibility. This self is what
we share in essentials, the self
of a rational soul.
The self-interest we should
all pursue is the interest of one
with a rational soul, one that
can, if he chooses, pursue a
thoughtful life. The purpose of
doing so, of pursuing a
thoughtful life, is that only that
course of conduct which
accords with reason can make
us happy.
This happiness that we
should all pursue in life is not
the happiness of thrillseeking,
hedonism, or fun-chasing. It is
the happiness that accords with
human nature, the happiness
that comes from living as a
human being.
Natural rights
The libertarian political
theory is based on a doctrine of
human rights. These natural
human rights are the proper
conditions for people to live in
their communities. In the
Declaration of Independence we
have them described as the
rights to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. This
description attests to my point
that the moral foundation of a
free society is egoism, since the
rights to life, liberty and,
especially, the pursuit of
happiness would make no sense
unless it would be good for
each person to live in liberty to
pursue his happiness.
Both the Buckley
conservative and the
Marx-socialist creeds offer
values to be pursued, something
that Hayek's system lacks. So
both Buckley and Marx touch a
deep need in the human soul.
But they offer not food but
poison as the nourishment of
that soul.

Buckley must know this by
now — he has friends and
colleagues who espouse this
moral case, not to mention his
familiarity with that widely
abused advocate of the moral
case for capitalism, Ayn Rand.
So why did Buckley choose to
hammer away at Hayek in his
speech?
If there are intellectuals
guilty of fraud and deception
on the left, there are plenty of
that kind on the right. And
while mostly entertaining
enough, due to his skill as
rhetorician, Buckley stands
within the right-wing faction of
our political spectrum as the
intellectual deceiver. He believes
that by showing admiration for
the moral courage of a
Solzhenitsyn he might hide his
own cowardice, but for myself
1 don't think he should enjoy
that delusion.
Not 'incomprehensible'
A final note on Buckley's
style. As the Daily reported on
Monday, Oct. 6, "Buckley's
address rambled for fifty
minutes. ..But several
people also said about this talk
that it came close to being
"incomprehensible." This is not
so. Buckley's talk had a very
clear direction and intention —
to persuade his audience that
not Marxist socialism, nor yet
Hayek's libertarianism but his
own theistic conservatism is the
proper political ideology for
human beings.
The rambling was, I submit,
quite intentional. He aimed to
bamboozle, befuddle and
deceive those who heard him
into thinking that the ideology
he advocates is the most
profound of the alternatives
competing for acceptance. One
way to instill the belief in
profundity is by the use of
complex polemics.
Yet in the end Buckley is
but a sophist. He can use all
the tricks of the logician, the
rhetorician, the PR man, and
the intellectual for his
prejudiced, unexamined goal,
namely to capture us as slaves
of his detestible anti-human
point of view. Mind you, this is
done with the utmost sincerity
— malice is not in Buckley's
heart, I am convinced. But
malice is not the only form of
vice.

The fact is that only one
moral position can defend
liberty — Buckley's allegation
to the contrary. This morality
is classical egoism.
It is the view that each
person should pursue his own
self-interest, and it has a very
specific view of the self which
does not taint it in favor of sin
from the start, before a person
has grown to an age of
responsibility. This self is what
we share in essentials, the self
of a rational soul.
The self-interest we should
all pursue is the interest of one
with a rational soul, one that
can, if he chooses, pursue a
thoughtful life. The purpose of
doing so, of pursuing a
thoughtful life, is that only that
course of conduct which
accords with reason can make
us happy.
This happiness that we
should all pursue in life is not
the happiness of thrillseeking,
hedonism, or fun-chasing. It is
the happiness that accords with
human nature, the happiness
that comes from living as a
human being.
Natural rights
The libertarian political
theory is based on a doctrine of
human rights. These natural
human rights are the proper
conditions for people to live in
their communities. In the
Declaration of Independence we
have them described as the
rights to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness. This
description attests to my point
that the moral foundation of a
free society is egoism, since the
rights to life, liberty and,
especially, the pursuit of
happiness would make no sense
unless it would be good for
each person to live in liberty to
pursue his happiness.
Both the Buckley
conservative and the
Marx-socialist creeds offer
values to be pursued, something
that Hayek's system lacks. So
both Buckley and Marx touch a
deep need in the human soul.
But they offer not food but
poison as the nourishment of
that soul.

Buckley must know this by
now — he has friends and
colleagues who espouse this
moral case, not to mention his
familiarity with that widely
abused advocate of the moral
case for capitalism, Ayn Rand.
So why did Buckley choose to
hammer away at Hayek in his
speech?
If there are intellectuals
guilty of fraud and deception
on the left, there are plenty of
that kind on the right. And
while mostly entertaining
enough, due to his skill as
rhetorician, Buckley stands
within the right-wing faction of
our political spectrum as the
intellectual deceiver. He believes
that by showing admiration for
the moral courage of a
Solzhenitsyn he might hide his
own cowardice, but for myself
1 don't think he should enjoy
that delusion.
Not 'incomprehensible'
A final note on Buckley's
style. As the Daily reported on
Monday, Oct. 6, "Buckley's
address rambled for fifty
minutes. ..But several
people also said about this talk
that it came close to being
"incomprehensible." This is not
so. Buckley's talk had a very
clear direction and intention —
to persuade his audience that
not Marxist socialism, nor yet
Hayek's libertarianism but his
own theistic conservatism is the
proper political ideology for
human beings.
The rambling was, I submit,
quite intentional. He aimed to
bamboozle, befuddle and
deceive those who heard him
into thinking that the ideology
he advocates is the most
profound of the alternatives
competing for acceptance. One
way to instill the belief in
profundity is by the use of
complex polemics.
Yet in the end Buckley is
but a sophist. He can use all
the tricks of the logician, the
rhetorician, the PR man, and
the intellectual for his
prejudiced, unexamined goal,
namely to capture us as slaves
of his detestible anti-human
point of view. Mind you, this is
done with the utmost sincerity
— malice is not in Buckley's
heart, I am convinced. But
malice is not the only form of
vice.
