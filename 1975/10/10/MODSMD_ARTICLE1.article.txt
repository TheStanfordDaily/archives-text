# Disco fever: It's contagious
## 
### ALEXANDER LEFF PERRY M. SIMON 
In the middle of the dance floor, a
bare-chested black, his hips encircled by a
silver Indian belt, bumps with a sleek
redhead dressed in clinging orange satin
pants, a low-cut yellow blouse, and an
orange scarf. They stare at each other and
let their bodies do the talking.
Suddenly, she drops to her knees and
alternately brushes one cheek and then the
other against her partner's crotch.
He pumps his pelvis slightly but stares
straight ahead. She stands up and he
spreads his knees, arching his back slightly
as the redhead wedges her hips sideways
between his thighs. Their hips pulsate in
time to the disco beat. They challenge each
other to back down. But the music won't
let them.
Dance Discipline
Like a well-disciplined army, scattered
dancers fall into formation. With
mechanical precision they dance the L.A.
hustle. Eventually, the discipline becomes
too confining; the dancers must break
away and attempt to release their excess
energy in whatever manner suits them best.
This is the disco scene: bodies churning
as if the floor were a giant mixmaster,
motion spurred by music, strobes pulsating
in a storm of fire. Some say it's the Big
New Thing that has given a transfusion to a
moribund rock and roll industry.
Although dancing to records has been
around as long as the discs themselves, the
first discotheques were born in Paris and
New York ten years ago. These, however,
were overshadowed by the emergence of
live rock shows in places like the Fillmores
East and West.
"People danced like crazy when Bill
Graham first opened," one disco owner
said. "But then they got mellow. The
drug scene had a lot to do with it."
Few agree on how the new disco craze
began to dent the stoned reverence of the
rock concert. Both blacks and gays claim
credit.
"Blacks have always danced to records,"
shouts Leon Harris as he bumps hip to hip
with his girlfriend at San Francisco's
Ricksha Bistro. "We invent the dances —
you white boys just steal 'em."
But a disc jockey at a prominent San
Francisco gay disco says,"The very first
disco in town was the Cabaret; it was
totally gay. Gay people have always been
more progressive."
Airwave Rare
Whoever is right, disco music
unquestionably is taking over the AM
airwaves, pushing more sophisticated rock
forms off the charts.
Classics of the genre include: "Hustle"
by Van McCoy; "Get Down Tonight" by
K.C. and the Sunshine Band and "Fight the

Power" by the Isley Brothers. Once the
discos spun the records that AM pop
stations played. Now, radio stations check
the disco playlists first.
The disco market is so important that
"disco versions" of records, with more
pronounced rhythm sections and sound
designed for high volume, are prepared
specially for the clubs.
Although mainstream whites are
flooding the floor, some of the most
successful clubs remain predominantly gay.
The End-up, the City's foremost gay disco,
isn't exactly comfortable, but it stresses
quality and good vibes.
'Intellectual' Clients
"We're the best dance and cruise bar in
the city," claims Tom, an End-up disc
jockey. "Other discos cater to welfare
people; the clientele here is a lot more
intellectual — lawyers, doctors . . . heh,
even a few Stanford professors."
Tom says End-up welcomes women "as
long as they're ladies. There's a difference
between a lady and a broad." Asked if
heterosexual males are welcome, he
replied, "The one thing all of us in here
don't like is discrimination."
Not all patrons come to dance. "I hate
to dance and the music is awful," one
client said. Tom says that there's not much
drinking, either: "In fact, many patrons
favor fruit juice."
What brings people in, Tom says, is "the
other people." But aside from the
socializing on the sidelines, there's plenty
to watch. A caged go-go boy bumps, grinds
and teases with the zipper of his baggy
army-surplus pants. Across the room a sign
reads: "Jockey Shorts Dance Contest . . .
Sundays ... $100 First Prize."
At Dance Your Ass Off, regarded as the
straightest and best Frisco Disco, DJ Pete
Struve sits 20 feet above the frenzy
encased in a glass booth with a control
panel that makes a 747 dashboard look
modest. Struve, the DJ's pilot, controls the
dance floor environment. He directs both
the music and the flashing lights.
Struve denies rumors of playlist payola
and says,"I decide what I play solely on
the basis of what I like and what the floor
gets off on."
The dancers are vigorous and intense.
Faces glisten with sweat and no bell signals
the end of a round. One record punches
into the next; to stop dancing, even for a
moment, is to lose. Littered on the sideline
counches are battered bodies that have
spun off the floor. After a few minutes
recouperation, they get up again.
A stunning brunette with a Vidal Sasson
wedge cut sips a Brandy Alexander in the
comparatively quiet disco bar. "Why do I
come here? Because there's foxy men."

Her blonde friend, Geneva, is
approached by a Romeo in a
white suit. How does she decide
whether to dance with him?
"Confidentially, I like his ass."
Th° further one moves from the
dance floor, the hotter the
pick-up scene.
More patrons dance the Hustle
rather than the Bump, which
some say is too suggestive when
performed on the dance floor
with a stranger. "The bump's not
out," a bystander explains. "But
only real tight couples do it."
A woman who looks like a
secretary-by-day giggles outside
the men's room. "I'm waiting for
my boyfriend to come out of the
bathroom from doing some
coke," she says. Why won't she
stop dancing? "I can't."
Although many disco patrons
are expending sheer youthful
energy, the blazing disco machine
is noticably stoked with
amphetamines, cocaine and amyl
nitrate.
Why the disco craze?
Mike, an End-up DJ, says, "It's

all escape. They don't have to
spend too much money, you
know, to go out, buy a few
drinks, dance, have a good time
... and forget about what's going
99
on.
The sexual overtones of San
Francisco clubs disturbed one
New York disco veteran: "People
out here are trying to get laid.
In gay discos in New York ... all
they want to do is dance."
As for the difference between
the Los Angeles and San
Francisco disco scenes, an End-up
DJ explained: "In L.A. they play
anything new; we throw away the
shit."
Lauren, a veteran of the Dance
Your Ass Off floor, says that
pickup undertones shouldn't keep
anyone from checking out the
disco scene. "You only get picked
up if you want to be," she insists.
"It's friendly here," says Willie,
a Frisco Disco waiter. "It's not a
pickup scene. People come, they
meet each other, dance, come
back, maybe see each other again.
Then maybe, they go home and
f— each other's brains out."
