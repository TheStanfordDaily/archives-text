# Frisco Disco's happy hustler

### 
Stu Goldberg and his disco are
a lot alike. Both have flash and
integrity.
Goldberg, owner of Dance
Your Ass Off, Inc., is the
recognized patriarch of the San
Francisco disco scene. "When I
was 16 I joined the circus as an
acrobat. Today I treat every
business I'm involved in as show
business," he says.
He also owns the popular
Agatha's Pub in Sausalito and

Marina Music Store in the City.
And there's more: he plays
guitar, jumps trampoline profes
sionally and teaches acrobatics to
San Francisco youngsters.
Goldberg is active in Bay Area
politics and can be identified by
his Quentin-Kopp-for-Supervisor
T-shirt. His donation of a batch
of shirts to the Kopp campaign
stirred a mild controversy.
The roots of Frisco Disco are
planted in Goldberg's exuber

ance. He took over a mis
managed, gay night spot, the
Olympus, this year with a
$100,000 debt. He revamped the
facility and constructed the disco
with only the aid of friends.
At the unveiling of the club
he took in $47, charging 50
cents for beer, 75 cents for
mixed drinks and no cover. After
a few good write-ups, including
coverage by Rolling Stone
magazine, Goldberg took

double-page newspaper ads urging
San Francisco to "Dance Your
Ass Off."
Drink prices remain
unchanged but the crowds are
estimated now at 7000 per week.
The door charge is on the rise
and sources say that Goldberg is
on his way to netting a hot half
million.
Tony Kent, Goldberg's public
relations consultant, says he's
"all iron and steel, held together
with strands of gold."
The disco master demands
respect and obedience from his
young staff. During an interview,
he was called aside and told of
some trouble at the back door.
He leaped over the desk,
bounded down the stairs and
across the dance floor, and
assumed the role of a bouncer.
A few minutes later, a waiter
complained that the person
Goldberg had bounced was his
cousin. "Tell your cousin to get
fucked and never come back, dig
it?" Goldberg snapped. "I don't
care if he's your fucking
father . . . he's not welcome."
Goldberg, who designed the
disco's flashy front window,
plans to hold "a phantasmagoric

Halloween party" and install a
laser light show and closed
circuit TV system.
Goldberg lets his DJ's set the
pace and the mood, but he
circulates among the clients and
knows many by name. As for
dancing? "Seldom. Only when
there's a really foxy lady who
needs to be danced with."
When Goldberg began his
Frisco Disco, all he could afford
was a cot in his office. He still
lives at the club 24 hours a day
— but now he has a full-sized
bed.
