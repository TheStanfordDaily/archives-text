Farewell My Lovely
Directed by Dick Richards.
Robert Mitchum underplays the role
of Philip Marlowe to the point of
Cctetonia. He pursues a long line of
dcac! bodies in his search for the
mysterious girlfriend of a client.
Though accurate in its portrayal of
the seamy side of Los Angeles, it
leans on Mitchum for support and
falls flat on its face. There is vitality
in Raymond Chandler's Marlowe,
while Mitchum appears to be asleep
most of the time. * *
Funny Lady
Directed by Herbert Ross.
Barbara Streisand returns as Fanny
Brice, her Oscar-winning role in

Funny Girl. If you don't look too
closely at the gaping holes in the
picture, Streisand is beautiful and her
voice is overwhelming. James Caan
provides contrast and balance as
Brice's second husband Billy Rose. A
glossy musical to end all glossy
musicals. ***
Journey Into Fear
Directed by Daniel Mann.
The most muddled mystery to come
out in a long time. Oil company
employee Graham (Sam Waterston) is
pursued by unknown nemesis on a
trip from Turkey to New York.
Exploitative violence, poor editing
and a choppy finale waste a fine cast
of name actors, including lan Mc-

Shane, Shelley Winters, and Stanley
Holloway. *
Tommy
Directed by Ken Russell.
The only way to see this film is
stoned, which is most likely the state
Ken Russell was in when he filmed it.
The Who's rock opera with Ann-
Margret and Oliver Reed is a confus
ing, flashy, violent, overdone exercise
in perversion. Completely sung and
poorly looped, it gives one the
impression of being trapped in a
kalideoscope for two hours. *
Bite The Bullet
Directed by Richard Brooks.
This film has Gene Hackman, Candace
Bergen, James Coburn, Ben Johnson
and Jan-Michael Vincent, but it is
amazing that so many talented people
could team to make such a boring
movie. It is a story of a 1906 horse
race, but the suspence, characters and
tension are so lackadaisical that it is
difficult to care who wins. *
The Fortune
Directed by Mike Nichols.
One of the few really likable come
dies that has surfaced recently, edged
with black humor. It's the story of
two con men out to murder the
heiress to a sanitary napkin fortune
and their bungled attempts are hilari
ous. Jack Nicholson's performance is
one of his best. Warren Beatty reveals
a talent for comedy as the stuffy con

man. Newcomer Stockard Channing
sparkles as the heiress. ****
The Wind and the Lion
Directed by John Milius.
Rewritten history, Hollywood style,
has never come out better. Brian
Keith as Teddy Roosevelt tries to
rescue Candace Bergen as Eden
Pedecaris (who was male in the
original incident) from Sean Connery
as Raisuli, the Last of the Barbary
Pirates. It is a majestic production,
corny at times, but thrilling in the
tradition of old-time adventure
movies. ***.
Singin' In The Rain
Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene
Kelly.
The 1952 MGM musical that supplied
the world with some of the most
magical musical moments. A multi
faceted film showing Hollywood both
in the halcyon days of 1927 before
and after sound arrived and in 1952
just before the days of TV when no
expense was spared for a lavish
production. The songs, Kelly's danc
ing and his superb performance as a
Hollywood lover make the picture
worth seeing — again. ****
Rollerball
Directed by Norman Jewison.
A chilling look into the not-so-distant
future when corporations have taken
over the world and the masses are
subdued by the ultraviolent rollerball
game, a conglomeration of roulette,
motorcycling, roller derby and hock
ey. James Caan plays the immensely
popular Jonathan E. who becomes
powerful enough to challenge the
reign of the corporations. ****
The Return of the Pink Panther
Directed by Blake Edwards.
Coolly mincing his way through the
intrigues of international crime and
the phonetic hazards of renting a
hotel "rum," Peter Sellers is at his
bumbling best as Inspector Clouseau.

Love and Death
Directed by Woody Allen.
Allen, a frustrated seeker of truth,
gets lost among philosophical cobwebs
of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky with
Diane Keaton, who is merely frustra
ted. Less frenzied than his earlier
films, this is Woody Allen's most
mature piece of filmmaking. He even
gets the girl. ****
Nashville
Directed by Robert Altman.
This tour de fource covers several
days in the lives of about 20
characters caught up in the Nashville
scene. We don't think it's the Ameri
can epic it is purported to be, but the
capsule performances of Henry
Gibson, Lily Tomlin and Roni Blakely
are outstanding. ***
Monty Python and the Holy
The six-man British comedy team
spoofs a King Arthur legend. If you
aren't already familiar with their
humor, it may take you a while to
get used to it. **
The Passenger
Directed by Antonio Antonioni.
The story of an American journalist
who assumes a dead man's identity
and takes on a new life, too. The film
is cast with an infectious sense of
apathy. Jack Nicholson, the journalist,
gets little chance to act. Maria
Schneider is the nameless "girl." *

capsule performances of Henry
Gibson, Lily Tomlin and Roni Blakely
are outstanding. ***
Monty Python and the Holy
The six-man British comedy team
spoofs a King Arthur legend. If you
aren't already familiar with their
humor, it may take you a while to
get used to it. **
The Passenger
Directed by Antonio Antonioni.
The story of an American journalist
who assumes a dead man's identity
and takes on a new life, too. The film
is cast with an infectious sense of
apathy. Jack Nicholson, the journalist,
gets little chance to act. Maria
Schneider is the nameless "girl." *
Farewell My Lovely
Directed by Dick Richards.
Robert Mitchum underplays the role
of Philip Marlowe to the point of
Cctetonia. He pursues a long line of
dcac! bodies in his search for the
mysterious girlfriend of a client.
Though accurate in its portrayal of
the seamy side of Los Angeles, it
leans on Mitchum for support and
falls flat on its face. There is vitality
in Raymond Chandler's Marlowe,
while Mitchum appears to be asleep
most of the time. * *
Funny Lady
Directed by Herbert Ross.
Barbara Streisand returns as Fanny
Brice, her Oscar-winning role in

Funny Girl. If you don't look too
closely at the gaping holes in the
picture, Streisand is beautiful and her
voice is overwhelming. James Caan
provides contrast and balance as
Brice's second husband Billy Rose. A
glossy musical to end all glossy
musicals. ***
Journey Into Fear
Directed by Daniel Mann.
The most muddled mystery to come
out in a long time. Oil company
employee Graham (Sam Waterston) is
pursued by unknown nemesis on a
trip from Turkey to New York.
Exploitative violence, poor editing
and a choppy finale waste a fine cast
of name actors, including lan Mc-

Shane, Shelley Winters, and Stanley
Holloway. *
Tommy
Directed by Ken Russell.
The only way to see this film is
stoned, which is most likely the state
Ken Russell was in when he filmed it.
The Who's rock opera with Ann-
Margret and Oliver Reed is a confus
ing, flashy, violent, overdone exercise
in perversion. Completely sung and
poorly looped, it gives one the
impression of being trapped in a
kalideoscope for two hours. *
Bite The Bullet
Directed by Richard Brooks.
This film has Gene Hackman, Candace
Bergen, James Coburn, Ben Johnson
and Jan-Michael Vincent, but it is
amazing that so many talented people
could team to make such a boring
movie. It is a story of a 1906 horse
race, but the suspence, characters and
tension are so lackadaisical that it is
difficult to care who wins. *
The Fortune
Directed by Mike Nichols.
One of the few really likable come
dies that has surfaced recently, edged
with black humor. It's the story of
two con men out to murder the
heiress to a sanitary napkin fortune
and their bungled attempts are hilari
ous. Jack Nicholson's performance is
one of his best. Warren Beatty reveals
a talent for comedy as the stuffy con

man. Newcomer Stockard Channing
sparkles as the heiress. ****
The Wind and the Lion
Directed by John Milius.
Rewritten history, Hollywood style,
has never come out better. Brian
Keith as Teddy Roosevelt tries to
rescue Candace Bergen as Eden
Pedecaris (who was male in the
original incident) from Sean Connery
as Raisuli, the Last of the Barbary
Pirates. It is a majestic production,
corny at times, but thrilling in the
tradition of old-time adventure
movies. ***.
Singin' In The Rain
Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene
Kelly.
The 1952 MGM musical that supplied
the world with some of the most
magical musical moments. A multi
faceted film showing Hollywood both
in the halcyon days of 1927 before
and after sound arrived and in 1952
just before the days of TV when no
expense was spared for a lavish
production. The songs, Kelly's danc
ing and his superb performance as a
Hollywood lover make the picture
worth seeing — again. ****
Rollerball
Directed by Norman Jewison.
A chilling look into the not-so-distant
future when corporations have taken
over the world and the masses are
subdued by the ultraviolent rollerball
game, a conglomeration of roulette,
motorcycling, roller derby and hock
ey. James Caan plays the immensely
popular Jonathan E. who becomes
powerful enough to challenge the
reign of the corporations. ****
The Return of the Pink Panther
Directed by Blake Edwards.
Coolly mincing his way through the
intrigues of international crime and
the phonetic hazards of renting a
hotel "rum," Peter Sellers is at his
bumbling best as Inspector Clouseau.

Love and Death
Directed by Woody Allen.
Allen, a frustrated seeker of truth,
gets lost among philosophical cobwebs
of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky with
Diane Keaton, who is merely frustra
ted. Less frenzied than his earlier
films, this is Woody Allen's most
mature piece of filmmaking. He even
gets the girl. ****
Nashville
Directed by Robert Altman.
This tour de fource covers several
days in the lives of about 20
characters caught up in the Nashville
scene. We don't think it's the Ameri
can epic it is purported to be, but the
capsule performances of Henry
Gibson, Lily Tomlin and Roni Blakely
are outstanding. ***

hotel "rum," Peter Sellers is at his
bumbling best as Inspector Clouseau.

Love and Death
Directed by Woody Allen.
Allen, a frustrated seeker of truth,
gets lost among philosophical cobwebs
of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky with
Diane Keaton, who is merely frustra
ted. Less frenzied than his earlier
films, this is Woody Allen's most
mature piece of filmmaking. He even
gets the girl. ****
Nashville
Directed by Robert Altman.
This tour de fource covers several
days in the lives of about 20
characters caught up in the Nashville
scene. We don't think it's the Ameri
can epic it is purported to be, but the
capsule performances of Henry
Gibson, Lily Tomlin and Roni Blakely
are outstanding. ***
Monty Python and the Holy
The six-man British comedy team
spoofs a King Arthur legend. If you
aren't already familiar with their
humor, it may take you a while to
get used to it. **
The Passenger
Directed by Antonio Antonioni.
The story of an American journalist
who assumes a dead man's identity
and takes on a new life, too. The film
is cast with an infectious sense of
apathy. Jack Nicholson, the journalist,
gets little chance to act. Maria
Schneider is the nameless "girl." *
Farewell My Lovely
Directed by Dick Richards.
Robert Mitchum underplays the role
of Philip Marlowe to the point of
Cctetonia. He pursues a long line of
dcac! bodies in his search for the
mysterious girlfriend of a client.
Though accurate in its portrayal of
the seamy side of Los Angeles, it
leans on Mitchum for support and
falls flat on its face. There is vitality
in Raymond Chandler's Marlowe,
while Mitchum appears to be asleep
most of the time. * *
Funny Lady
Directed by Herbert Ross.
Barbara Streisand returns as Fanny
Brice, her Oscar-winning role in

Funny Girl. If you don't look too
closely at the gaping holes in the
picture, Streisand is beautiful and her
voice is overwhelming. James Caan
provides contrast and balance as
Brice's second husband Billy Rose. A
glossy musical to end all glossy
musicals. ***
Journey Into Fear
Directed by Daniel Mann.
The most muddled mystery to come
out in a long time. Oil company
employee Graham (Sam Waterston) is
pursued by unknown nemesis on a
trip from Turkey to New York.
Exploitative violence, poor editing
and a choppy finale waste a fine cast
of name actors, including lan Mc-

Shane, Shelley Winters, and Stanley
Holloway. *
Tommy
Directed by Ken Russell.
The only way to see this film is
stoned, which is most likely the state
Ken Russell was in when he filmed it.
The Who's rock opera with Ann-
Margret and Oliver Reed is a confus
ing, flashy, violent, overdone exercise
in perversion. Completely sung and
poorly looped, it gives one the
impression of being trapped in a
kalideoscope for two hours. *
Bite The Bullet
Directed by Richard Brooks.
This film has Gene Hackman, Candace
Bergen, James Coburn, Ben Johnson
and Jan-Michael Vincent, but it is
amazing that so many talented people
could team to make such a boring
movie. It is a story of a 1906 horse
race, but the suspence, characters and
tension are so lackadaisical that it is
difficult to care who wins. *
The Fortune
Directed by Mike Nichols.
One of the few really likable come
dies that has surfaced recently, edged
with black humor. It's the story of
two con men out to murder the
heiress to a sanitary napkin fortune
and their bungled attempts are hilari
ous. Jack Nicholson's performance is
one of his best. Warren Beatty reveals
a talent for comedy as the stuffy con

man. Newcomer Stockard Channing
sparkles as the heiress. ****
The Wind and the Lion
Directed by John Milius.
Rewritten history, Hollywood style,
has never come out better. Brian
Keith as Teddy Roosevelt tries to
rescue Candace Bergen as Eden
Pedecaris (who was male in the
original incident) from Sean Connery
as Raisuli, the Last of the Barbary
Pirates. It is a majestic production,
corny at times, but thrilling in the
tradition of old-time adventure
movies. ***.
Singin' In The Rain
Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene
Kelly.
The 1952 MGM musical that supplied
the world with some of the most
magical musical moments. A multi
faceted film showing Hollywood both
in the halcyon days of 1927 before
and after sound arrived and in 1952
just before the days of TV when no
expense was spared for a lavish
production. The songs, Kelly's danc
ing and his superb performance as a
Hollywood lover make the picture
worth seeing — again. ****
Rollerball
Directed by Norman Jewison.
A chilling look into the not-so-distant
future when corporations have taken
over the world and the masses are
subdued by the ultraviolent rollerball
game, a conglomeration of roulette,
motorcycling, roller derby and hock
ey. James Caan plays the immensely
popular Jonathan E. who becomes
powerful enough to challenge the
reign of the corporations. ****
The Return of the Pink Panther
Directed by Blake Edwards.
Coolly mincing his way through the
intrigues of international crime and
the phonetic hazards of renting a
hotel "rum," Peter Sellers is at his
bumbling best as Inspector Clouseau.
