The press release touted him
as "rock critic and gossip
columnist for I/Observatore
Romano, the official Vatican
newspaper." Father Guido
Sarducci could be contacted at
the Boarding House in San
Francisco while on leave from
his Vatican post, and it looked
like an interview prospect too
promising to pass up.
The rock priest's list of credits
seemed endless: Graduate of the
Marconi School of Broadcasting
at Reggio Calabria, recently
named one of the world's "Ten
Best-Dressed Priests" by the
German religious trade
publication Der Clergy.
Who would have guessed that
Father Guido Sarducci is really
Don Novello, a comedian with
not only a taste for satire but a
growing list of performance
credits to match that of the
Good Father?
Father Sarducci, or Don
Novelio, completed a five-night
appearance at the Boarding House
last week. He wore his wry
humor into a spontaneous act
tha completely won audiences.
It's been a long time since
Novello's first appearance on the
Chicken Little Comedy Show
three years ago, when Father

'I'd like to be the
first Denim Pope!'

Sarducci first presented his
"Report From Rome." More
recently Novello has been
something of a regular on the
Smothers Brothers' television
series.
Excommunicated
Father Sarducci's character
just sort of "popped up," says
the Ohio-born Novello, a former
economics major, turned comedy
writer. "I went to school in
Rome for a while," he explains.
Almost as soon as the
Sarducci act fell together,
Novello was taping four shows
for an ABC pilot broadcast called
Comedy News. "It was the
second time I had ever done it,"
recalls Novello, who has stuck
exclusively with the Vatican City

columnist character ever since.
One of the first problems
however, was finding the right
audience; the ABC tapes were
cut after the network decided
that the character of the smoking
priest was too radical for the
time.
The Smothers Brothers first
ran into Novello during a gig at
the Comedy Store in Los
Angeles. He was commuting
between engagements there and

'I'm for taking out
the pews and
having dancing.'

at the Intersection in San
Francisco. This time the
network, at the urging of the
Smothers Brothers, went for his
act, "and they put me on prime
time ... it was surprising that
there wasn't much comment,"
Novello says. He has recorded
one successful single, "A
European Speaks Up for the
U.S." a parody of that patriotic
single "The Americans" of a year
and a half ago. Novello now
hopes to put an album together.
Saint he ain't
He remains active in comedy
writing and his most recent
published work appears in the
recent issue of Oui magazine.
The piece, entitled "Vatican
Memos," includes the actual bill
for the Last Supper, which had
been lost for centuries.
Novello, as Father Sarducci,
wears his wide-brimmed padre
hat, cape and sunglasses, totes a
120 millimeter cigarette and
pokes fun at the politics of the
modern church: "These new
American saints! Three miracles
gets them in — and two of those
are card tricks! Why I know
Italians with 30 miracles going
for them, but no dice!"
"Political satire is still alive
too, and that's great!" Novello
exclaims.
Here are a few comments
taken from the Good Father's
amazing scope of knowledge and
insight:

On the reflection of looser
lifestyles in rock music lyrics:
"JVo, I'm. not bothered by
them at all; but it doesn't affect
the church very much . . . they're
only concerned that people are
falling away from the church,
and this stops the revenue from
coming in. We're trying to get
involved! Whatever the move is,
we've got to be right on top of
it. I'm for taking out the pews
and having dancing — as long as
we can get into the bucks!"
On writing for L'Observatore
Romano:
"... I do my column like I
was working for Crawdaddy or
Rolling Stone or something, I
don't pay much attention that
it's a Vatican paper. (As for
censorship) there's a little bit,
but you know I get a lot through
them because they don't
understand. For one thing, the
Pope's not into music at all. He's

got only one album, an old jazz
album that Jack Kennedy gave
him, that's it! He's into nothing,
just hymns..."
On change within the church:
"It's starting to loosen up a
little bit. They sec all these gurus
making all this money — it's
frightening! Gurus say: OK you
can pray at home you know? No
need the church! So we have to
go for 'em. I say we reach out
.. . like with the 'Doo-Wop'
mass.
On hopes for the future of
the church:
'7 think I would change the
Pope's outfit. I wouldn't want to
wear that shit that they've been
wearing all this time, you know.
I want a little color. Maybe the
same robes, but tie-dyed or
something. Denim! I'd like to be
the first Denim Pope!"

Pope's not into music at all. He's

album that Jack Kennedy gave
him, that's it! He's into nothing,
just hymns..."
On change within the church:
"It's starting to loosen up a
little bit. They sec all these gurus
making all this money — it's
frightening! Gurus say: OK you

the first Denim Pope!"

The press release touted him
as "rock critic and gossip
columnist for I/Observatore
Romano, the official Vatican
newspaper." Father Guido
Sarducci could be contacted at
the Boarding House in San
Francisco while on leave from
his Vatican post, and it looked
like an interview prospect too
promising to pass up.
The rock priest's list of credits
seemed endless: Graduate of the
Marconi School of Broadcasting
at Reggio Calabria, recently
named one of the world's "Ten
Best-Dressed Priests" by the

Father Guido Sarducci is really
Don Novello, a comedian with
not only a taste for satire but a
growing list of performance
credits to match that of the
Good Father?
Father Sarducci, or Don
Novelio, completed a five-night
appearance at the Boarding House
last week. He wore his wry
humor into a spontaneous act
tha completely won audiences.
It's been a long time since
Novello's first appearance on the
Chicken Little Comedy Show
three years ago, when Father

'I'd like to be the
first Denim Pope!'

Sarducci first presented his
"Report From Rome." More
recently Novello has been
something of a regular on the
Smothers Brothers' television
series.
Excommunicated
Father Sarducci's character
just sort of "popped up," says
the Ohio-born Novello, a former
economics major, turned comedy
writer. "I went to school in
Rome for a while," he explains.
Almost as soon as the
Sarducci act fell together,
Novello was taping four shows
for an ABC pilot broadcast called
Comedy News. "It was the
second time I had ever done it,"
recalls Novello, who has stuck
exclusively with the Vatican City

columnist character ever since.
One of the first problems
however, was finding the right
audience; the ABC tapes were
cut after the network decided
that the character of the smoking
priest was too radical for the
time.
The Smothers Brothers first
ran into Novello during a gig at
the Comedy Store in Los
Angeles. He was commuting
between engagements there and

'I'm for taking out
the pews and
having dancing.'

at the Intersection in San
Francisco. This time the
network, at the urging of the
Smothers Brothers, went for his
act, "and they put me on prime
time ... it was surprising that
there wasn't much comment,"
Novello says. He has recorded
one successful single, "A
European Speaks Up for the
U.S." a parody of that patriotic
single "The Americans" of a year
and a half ago. Novello now
hopes to put an album together.
Saint he ain't
He remains active in comedy
writing and his most recent
published work appears in the
recent issue of Oui magazine.
The piece, entitled "Vatican
Memos," includes the actual bill
for the Last Supper, which had
been lost for centuries.
Novello, as Father Sarducci,
wears his wide-brimmed padre
hat, cape and sunglasses, totes a
120 millimeter cigarette and
pokes fun at the politics of the
modern church: "These new
American saints! Three miracles
gets them in — and two of those
are card tricks! Why I know
Italians with 30 miracles going
for them, but no dice!"
"Political satire is still alive
too, and that's great!" Novello
exclaims.
Here are a few comments
taken from the Good Father's
amazing scope of knowledge and
insight:

On the reflection of looser
lifestyles in rock music lyrics:
"JVo, I'm. not bothered by
them at all; but it doesn't affect
the church very much . . . they're
only concerned that people are
falling away from the church,
and this stops the revenue from
coming in. We're trying to get
involved! Whatever the move is,
we've got to be right on top of
it. I'm for taking out the pews
and having dancing — as long as
we can get into the bucks!"
On writing for L'Observatore
Romano:
"... I do my column like I
was working for Crawdaddy or
Rolling Stone or something, I
don't pay much attention that
it's a Vatican paper. (As for
censorship) there's a little bit,
but you know I get a lot through

taken from the Good Father's
amazing scope of knowledge and
insight:

On the reflection of looser
lifestyles in rock music lyrics:
"JVo, I'm. not bothered by
them at all; but it doesn't affect
the church very much . . . they're
only concerned that people are
falling away from the church,
and this stops the revenue from
coming in. We're trying to get
involved! Whatever the move is,
we've got to be right on top of
it. I'm for taking out the pews
and having dancing — as long as
we can get into the bucks!"
On writing for L'Observatore
Romano:
"... I do my column like I
was working for Crawdaddy or
Rolling Stone or something, I
don't pay much attention that
it's a Vatican paper. (As for
censorship) there's a little bit,
but you know I get a lot through
them because they don't
understand. For one thing, the
Pope's not into music at all. He's

got only one album, an old jazz
album that Jack Kennedy gave
him, that's it! He's into nothing,
just hymns..."
On change within the church:
"It's starting to loosen up a
little bit. They sec all these gurus
making all this money — it's
frightening! Gurus say: OK you
can pray at home you know? No
need the church! So we have to
go for 'em. I say we reach out
.. . like with the 'Doo-Wop'
mass.
On hopes for the future of
the church:
'7 think I would change the
Pope's outfit. I wouldn't want to
wear that shit that they've been
wearing all this time, you know.
I want a little color. Maybe the
same robes, but tie-dyed or
something. Denim! I'd like to be
the first Denim Pope!"

The press release touted him
as "rock critic and gossip
columnist for I/Observatore
Romano, the official Vatican
newspaper." Father Guido
Sarducci could be contacted at
the Boarding House in San
Francisco while on leave from
his Vatican post, and it looked
like an interview prospect too
promising to pass up.
The rock priest's list of credits
seemed endless: Graduate of the
Marconi School of Broadcasting
at Reggio Calabria, recently
named one of the world's "Ten
Best-Dressed Priests" by the
German religious trade
publication Der Clergy.
Who would have guessed that
Father Guido Sarducci is really
Don Novello, a comedian with
not only a taste for satire but a
growing list of performance
credits to match that of the
Good Father?
Father Sarducci, or Don
Novelio, completed a five-night
appearance at the Boarding House
last week. He wore his wry
humor into a spontaneous act
tha completely won audiences.
It's been a long time since
Novello's first appearance on the
Chicken Little Comedy Show
three years ago, when Father

'I'd like to be the
first Denim Pope!'

Sarducci first presented his
"Report From Rome." More
recently Novello has been
something of a regular on the
Smothers Brothers' television
series.
Excommunicated
Father Sarducci's character
just sort of "popped up," says
the Ohio-born Novello, a former
economics major, turned comedy
writer. "I went to school in
Rome for a while," he explains.
Almost as soon as the
Sarducci act fell together,
Novello was taping four shows
for an ABC pilot broadcast called
Comedy News. "It was the
second time I had ever done it,"
recalls Novello, who has stuck
exclusively with the Vatican City

columnist character ever since.
One of the first problems
however, was finding the right
audience; the ABC tapes were
cut after the network decided
that the character of the smoking
priest was too radical for the
time.
The Smothers Brothers first
ran into Novello during a gig at
the Comedy Store in Los
Angeles. He was commuting
between engagements there and

'I'm for taking out
the pews and
having dancing.'

at the Intersection in San
Francisco. This time the
network, at the urging of the
Smothers Brothers, went for his
act, "and they put me on prime
time ... it was surprising that
there wasn't much comment,"
Novello says. He has recorded
one successful single, "A
European Speaks Up for the
U.S." a parody of that patriotic
single "The Americans" of a year
and a half ago. Novello now
hopes to put an album together.
Saint he ain't
He remains active in comedy
writing and his most recent
published work appears in the
recent issue of Oui magazine.
The piece, entitled "Vatican
Memos," includes the actual bill
for the Last Supper, which had
been lost for centuries.
Novello, as Father Sarducci,
wears his wide-brimmed padre
hat, cape and sunglasses, totes a
120 millimeter cigarette and
pokes fun at the politics of the
modern church: "These new
American saints! Three miracles
gets them in — and two of those
are card tricks! Why I know
Italians with 30 miracles going
for them, but no dice!"
"Political satire is still alive
too, and that's great!" Novello
exclaims.
