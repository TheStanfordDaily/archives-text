# Disco reaches ballroom
## 'Exceptional' students hustle, bump with class 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Its roots are planted in earthy
black soul music and movements.
It sprouted in New York's Le
Jardin and rambled westward on
TV network trunklines, faster
than a speeding Soul Train. It
branched into hundreds of clubs
crammed with people of various
races and sexual preferences who
want to dance to recorded music.
And it didn't stop there.
The Highlands Country Club,
Inc., which hugs the Redwood
City edge of rural-suburban
Woodside at 1665 Fernside Ave.,
doesn't look like a place that
should be quarantined for disco
fever. But ballroom dancing
teacher Imogene Woodruff isn't
surprised that her students have
been catching it.
Woodruff, who has been
teaching on the peninsula for at
least 25 years, can't afford to be
fazed by the craze. "You've got
to stay with the trends to stay in
business," she says.
The disco renaissance has made
a difference in who she teaches
and what she teaches. The total
number of students enrolled in
her classes remains at an average
400, she estimates, "but all of a
sudden there are more college age
students, more young marrieds."
Woodruff saw the new fad
coming in the wake of the popular
Soul Train. TV program and in a
time of national belt-tightening.

People are dancing to records
because it's economical, she says.
"They like dancing more and can
afford bands less."
But most people in the
22-to-30 age group didn't learn to
dance five years ago, Woodruff
adds. "Kids who haven't been
dancing don't know what to do. If
a leader gets up, they're willing to
follow."
Thus, such line dances as the
Continental and the L.A. Hustle
evolved. Now that the patterns are
set, "kids have to know what to
do when they get out there. So
they practice at home." Or they
take lessons.
Woodruff teaches classes with
the help of some "exceptional
children," who demonstrate as she
barks out directions like a
drillmaster. "You can really see
the colored influence," she
explains, raising her voice over the
thump of the disco hit
"Dyno-mite."
"I saw a show called The
Evolution of the Blues in San
Francisco," says Mark Gill, 19,
whose frenzied movements in the
"Locker" disco style belie years
of ballroom titles and training.
"One man did some early African
dancing that looked remarkably
like the dances we're doing now."
Not all Woodruff's students can
coordinate the sequences of kicks,
head snaps and turns. But once
they try it "they get tired of

copying styles," she says. "Every
dance that's coming out now
shows that people are trying to
get back together."
The bump is the most popular
with students, she says. However,
it's more a contact sport than a
dance. When every combination
of clashing hips, rumps, shoulders
heads and elbows has been tried
(they don't bump those "other"
parts in suburban Redwood City),
most students are ready for some
sustained touching.
The disco innovators aped the
classic ballroom partnering
position, Woodruff points out,
then tried to invent something to
do with their feet.
The New York hustle was
invented by someone trying to
imitate a fox trot, she says. The
pattern—two stamps with the right
foot, two with the left, a rocking
step backwards and reverse — is an
imitation of an old swing.
Woodruff watches an
"exceptional" couple hustle
across the floor: "It's the first
time kids have touched while
dancing in five years. They forgot
how much fun it is."
Mike Fenly, an 19-year-old
sophomore in engineering at the
College in San Mateo, has fun
dancing with his sister Joanne, 18
a freshman in nursing. "When
we hear a disco record or a group
like Papa Du Run Da Run we just
get out there and burn up the
floor."
But skill is not enough to make
the disco scene. "At most places,"
Mike complains, "you have to be
over 21."
Nevertheless, Woodruff says
that her stellar students are "the
most popular kids around — they
get asked to teach all their
friends."
Every now and then, Woodruff
herself gets caught up in the disco
rhythm. When she finds herself
dancing she stops, a little
embarrassed. "There's no
championship in the bump or the
hustle," she says wistfully. "They
only do that for beautiful
dancing."

head snaps and turns. But once
they try it "they get tired of

copying styles," she says. "Every
dance that's coming out now
shows that people are trying to
get back together."
The bump is the most popular
with students, she says. However,
it's more a contact sport than a
dance. When every combination
of clashing hips, rumps, shoulders
heads and elbows has been tried
(they don't bump those "other"
parts in suburban Redwood City),
most students are ready for some
sustained touching.
The disco innovators aped the
classic ballroom partnering
position, Woodruff points out,
then tried to invent something to
do with their feet.
The New York hustle was
invented by someone trying to
imitate a fox trot, she says. The
pattern—two stamps with the right
foot, two with the left, a rocking
step backwards and reverse — is an
imitation of an old swing.
Woodruff watches an
"exceptional" couple hustle
across the floor: "It's the first
time kids have touched while
dancing in five years. They forgot
how much fun it is."
Mike Fenly, an 19-year-old
sophomore in engineering at the
College in San Mateo, has fun
dancing with his sister Joanne, 18
a freshman in nursing. "When
we hear a disco record or a group
like Papa Du Run Da Run we just
get out there and burn up the
floor."
But skill is not enough to make
the disco scene. "At most places,"
Mike complains, "you have to be
over 21."
Nevertheless, Woodruff says
that her stellar students are "the
most popular kids around — they
get asked to teach all their
friends."
Every now and then, Woodruff
herself gets caught up in the disco
rhythm. When she finds herself
dancing she stops, a little
embarrassed. "There's no
championship in the bump or the
hustle," she says wistfully. "They
only do that for beautiful
dancing."


Mark Gill and Judy Perko hustle
the original way: cheek to cheek


The Fenlys "get down" with the bump


A "cuddle" variation on the New York hustle


Follow the leader: getting it together in a line dance
Its roots are planted in earthy
black soul music and movements.
It sprouted in New York's Le
Jardin and rambled westward on
TV network trunklines, faster
than a speeding Soul Train. It
branched into hundreds of clubs
crammed with people of various
races and sexual preferences who
want to dance to recorded music.
And it didn't stop there.
The Highlands Country Club,
Inc., which hugs the Redwood
City edge of rural-suburban
Woodside at 1665 Fernside Ave.,
doesn't look like a place that
should be quarantined for disco
fever. But ballroom dancing
teacher Imogene Woodruff isn't
surprised that her students have
been catching it.
Woodruff, who has been
teaching on the peninsula for at
least 25 years, can't afford to be
fazed by the craze. "You've got
to stay with the trends to stay in
business," she says.
The disco renaissance has made
a difference in who she teaches
and what she teaches. The total
number of students enrolled in
her classes remains at an average
400, she estimates, "but all of a
sudden there are more college age
students, more young marrieds."
Woodruff saw the new fad
coming in the wake of the popular
Soul Train. TV program and in a
time of national belt-tightening.

People are dancing to records
because it's economical, she says.
"They like dancing more and can
afford bands less."
But most people in the
22-to-30 age group didn't learn to
dance five years ago, Woodruff
adds. "Kids who haven't been
dancing don't know what to do. If
a leader gets up, they're willing to
follow."
Thus, such line dances as the
Continental and the L.A. Hustle
evolved. Now that the patterns are
set, "kids have to know what to
do when they get out there. So
they practice at home." Or they
take lessons.
Woodruff teaches classes with
the help of some "exceptional
children," who demonstrate as she
barks out directions like a
drillmaster. "You can really see
the colored influence," she
explains, raising her voice over the
thump of the disco hit
"Dyno-mite."
"I saw a show called The
Evolution of the Blues in San
Francisco," says Mark Gill, 19,
whose frenzied movements in the
"Locker" disco style belie years
of ballroom titles and training.
"One man did some early African
dancing that looked remarkably
like the dances we're doing now."

Woodside at 1665 Fernside Ave.,
doesn't look like a place that
should be quarantined for disco
fever. But ballroom dancing
teacher Imogene Woodruff isn't
surprised that her students have
been catching it.
Woodruff, who has been
teaching on the peninsula for at
least 25 years, can't afford to be
fazed by the craze. "You've got
to stay with the trends to stay in
business," she says.
The disco renaissance has made
a difference in who she teaches
and what she teaches. The total
number of students enrolled in
her classes remains at an average
400, she estimates, "but all of a
sudden there are more college age
students, more young marrieds."
Woodruff saw the new fad
coming in the wake of the popular
Soul Train. TV program and in a
time of national belt-tightening.

People are dancing to records
because it's economical, she says.
"They like dancing more and can
afford bands less."
But most people in the
22-to-30 age group didn't learn to
dance five years ago, Woodruff
adds. "Kids who haven't been
dancing don't know what to do. If
a leader gets up, they're willing to
follow."
Thus, such line dances as the
Continental and the L.A. Hustle
evolved. Now that the patterns are
set, "kids have to know what to
do when they get out there. So
they practice at home." Or they
take lessons.
Woodruff teaches classes with
the help of some "exceptional
children," who demonstrate as she
barks out directions like a
drillmaster. "You can really see
the colored influence," she
explains, raising her voice over the
thump of the disco hit
"Dyno-mite."
"I saw a show called The
Evolution of the Blues in San
Francisco," says Mark Gill, 19,
whose frenzied movements in the
"Locker" disco style belie years
of ballroom titles and training.
"One man did some early African
dancing that looked remarkably
like the dances we're doing now."
Not all Woodruff's students can
coordinate the sequences of kicks,
head snaps and turns. But once
they try it "they get tired of

copying styles," she says. "Every
dance that's coming out now
shows that people are trying to
get back together."
The bump is the most popular
with students, she says. However,
it's more a contact sport than a
dance. When every combination
of clashing hips, rumps, shoulders
heads and elbows has been tried
(they don't bump those "other"
parts in suburban Redwood City),
most students are ready for some
sustained touching.
The disco innovators aped the
classic ballroom partnering
position, Woodruff points out,
then tried to invent something to
do with their feet.
The New York hustle was
invented by someone trying to
imitate a fox trot, she says. The
pattern—two stamps with the right
foot, two with the left, a rocking
step backwards and reverse — is an
imitation of an old swing.
Woodruff watches an
"exceptional" couple hustle
across the floor: "It's the first
time kids have touched while
dancing in five years. They forgot
how much fun it is."
Mike Fenly, an 19-year-old
sophomore in engineering at the
College in San Mateo, has fun
dancing with his sister Joanne, 18
a freshman in nursing. "When
we hear a disco record or a group
like Papa Du Run Da Run we just
get out there and burn up the
floor."
But skill is not enough to make
the disco scene. "At most places,"
Mike complains, "you have to be
over 21."
Nevertheless, Woodruff says
that her stellar students are "the
most popular kids around — they
get asked to teach all their
friends."
Every now and then, Woodruff
herself gets caught up in the disco
rhythm. When she finds herself
dancing she stops, a little
embarrassed. "There's no
championship in the bump or the
hustle," she says wistfully. "They
only do that for beautiful
dancing."

Its roots are planted in earthy
black soul music and movements.
It sprouted in New York's Le
Jardin and rambled westward on
TV network trunklines, faster
than a speeding Soul Train. It
branched into hundreds of clubs
crammed with people of various
races and sexual preferences who
want to dance to recorded music.
And it didn't stop there.
