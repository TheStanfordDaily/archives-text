# 'Tiny Alice' in Scandal-land
## Playwright-director clash parallels onstage drama 
### JANICE L. ROSS 
Nothing sells theater tickets
like a good scandal.
While this may not be director
William Ball's intent, his revival
of Edward Albee's Tiny Alice,
which opened ACT's 10th season
last Friday night, already is at
the center of a lively and volatile
controversy.
There is almost as much
mystery and intrigue surrounding
the production of this play as
there is in the drama itself. Albee
says he is furious because he
feels that Ball has "taken it upon
himself to freely cut, distort and
rewrite" Tiny Alice until it bears
little resemblance to the original
work.
Ball, on the other hand,
maintains that his revisions have
helped make the play a popular
success.
But at the moment, onstage at
the Geary Theater as well as
offstage, it's a hopeless muddle.
War in the wings
The tension between Ball and
Albee is reminiscent of the
relationship between the Cardinal
and the Lawyer in Tiny Alice.
Although both men dislike each
other they are forced to be
tolerant, because each has
something the other wants. Ball
wants the right to continue
producing Albee's plays without
fear of legal action; in the play

it's the Cardinal's greed for
money which forces him to
endure the acerbic Lawyer.
Conversely, Albee needs major
directors with major companies,
such as Ball of ACT, to present
his works to the public; in Tiny
Alice, the Lawyer needs the
Cardinal's help in arranging for
the transfer of a large donation
to the Church.
Including intermissions, Tiny
Alice runs about three hours. But
despite its conceptual complexity
and lack of obvious plot, it isn't
boring. The play is replete with
philosophical musings about Man,
God and morality as well as
pithy verbal exchanges.
Superficially, Tiny Alice
concerns Julian, a young, iay
priest (unevenly acted by
Nicholas Cortland) who is
struggling to reconcile his idea of
God the creator with the God
created by Man. Julian's
confusion is exacerbated when he
meets Alice, a wealthy and
beautiful woman who is about to
donate two billion dollars to the
Catholic Church. Julian is sent to
help arrange the transfer and in
the process he is seduced,
married and destroyed by Alice.
Dual denouement
The denouement occurs in the
third and final act when it is
revealed that Alice is no ordinary
billionaire, and that this is no

ordinary marriage.
Just as he was seduced by
religion, married to the Church
and betrayed by the Cardinal,
Julian's second marriage, this
time to a supposed reality
instead of a guaranteed illusion,
proves equally disappointing.
In staging Tiny Alice Ball has
incorporated the use of masks,
Beckettesque word chants and
tacky science fiction music in an
effort to increase the ambience
of foreboding and desperation.
This works to an extent, but the
production falls short where Ball
employs cheap gimmicks like
overt homosexual overtones to
mask the real issues of the
drama.
ACT's original production of
Tiny Alice, some eight years
earlier, had a strange power to it
that is lacking in this version. In
the first production the
characters were all threateningly
omnipotent and sagacious,
conveying a sense of an infinite
wisdom and power. But in Ball's
effort the acting is generally
shallow and superficial. This
clouds the playwright's intent.
Whether in spite of its
drawbacks or because of them,
Ball's production of Tiny Alice is
a major theatrical event that
should not be missed by anyone
interested in Albee, scandal or
both.
