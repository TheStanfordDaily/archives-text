# Gimmicks foil 'Matchmaker'
## ACT curtain rises on blind date with Thornton Wilder 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Lately, American Conservatory Theater
directors have become insufferably uppity.
They apparently believe that a play's script is
an adjunct to a director's stagecraft, which they
should remodel with textual revision, bizarre
interpretation and cheap gimmickry. They seem
unable to leave well enough alone.
ACT General Director William Ball led the
trend toward a tawdry parody of drama for
several years, notably with a forced commedia
del'arte version of Taming of the Shrew and stark
caricatures of The Crucible and King Richard 111.
Other ACT directors followed suit, albeit more
carefully. But Ball protege Laird Williamson has
abandoned all caution with his labored production
of The Matchmaker.
Thornton Wilder wrote a smooth, lively play
that most junior high school dramatists could not
butcher. Williamson manages to spoil it with ease,
transforming a delightful comedy into a crude
cartoon.
He distends Wilder's short play into a sluggish
three-hour bore — stifling the magic of quick
repartee with exaggerated double-takes, leaving
pregnant pauses that uniformly miscarry, milking
the audience for laughs but eliciting polite,
embarassed titters.
Wilder's stage directions suggest clever,
judicious use of props, but Williamson added
grandiose flourishes of his own, reducing portions

of the play to slapstick.
The director yields to the same temptation in
stage effects: Stagehands dance prettily across the
apron, arranging the set at the opening of each
act, while characters assume strained poses in a
tableau behind the scrim, for example.
The ACT production also collapses in
characterization. Most comedies require suspended
belief; this Matchmaker demands suspended
incredulity.
In his program notes Williamson observes that
Wilder, in revising Matchmaker, "added interesting
new characters and gave warmth, dimension and
humanity to existing ones. He graced their
frustrations and desires with greater depth,
infused more feeling into their relationships, and
treated us to insights into their lives."
Wilder does offer this. But Williamson himself
conceals it all with grotesquely exaggerated
characters. The playwright wrote sympathetically
about his characters; an ACT audience leaves
feeling indifferent to them all, including the
extraordinary Dolly Levi and the warmly-drawn
clerks, Cornelius and Barnaby.
With such fatal flaws in the direction, one
cannot fairly criticize the acting company.
Virtually all of the principals seem uneasy with
Williamson's strained interpretation. His approach
left them no room to manuever and reduced the
play to banality before anyone spoke a line.

He distends Wilder's short play into a sluggish
three-hour bore — stifling the magic of quick
repartee with exaggerated double-takes, leaving
pregnant pauses that uniformly miscarry, milking
the audience for laughs but eliciting polite,
embarassed titters.
Wilder's stage directions suggest clever,
judicious use of props, but Williamson added
grandiose flourishes of his own, reducing portions

of the play to slapstick.
The director yields to the same temptation in
stage effects: Stagehands dance prettily across the
apron, arranging the set at the opening of each
act, while characters assume strained poses in a
tableau behind the scrim, for example.
The ACT production also collapses in
characterization. Most comedies require suspended
belief; this Matchmaker demands suspended
incredulity.
In his program notes Williamson observes that
Wilder, in revising Matchmaker, "added interesting
new characters and gave warmth, dimension and
humanity to existing ones. He graced their
frustrations and desires with greater depth,
infused more feeling into their relationships, and
treated us to insights into their lives."
Wilder does offer this. But Williamson himself
conceals it all with grotesquely exaggerated
characters. The playwright wrote sympathetically
about his characters; an ACT audience leaves
feeling indifferent to them all, including the
extraordinary Dolly Levi and the warmly-drawn
clerks, Cornelius and Barnaby.
With such fatal flaws in the direction, one
cannot fairly criticize the acting company.
Virtually all of the principals seem uneasy with
Williamson's strained interpretation. His approach
left them no room to manuever and reduced the
play to banality before anyone spoke a line.
Lately, American Conservatory Theater
directors have become insufferably uppity.
They apparently believe that a play's script is
an adjunct to a director's stagecraft, which they
should remodel with textual revision, bizarre
interpretation and cheap gimmickry. They seem
unable to leave well enough alone.
ACT General Director William Ball led the
trend toward a tawdry parody of drama for
several years, notably with a forced commedia
del'arte version of Taming of the Shrew and stark
caricatures of The Crucible and King Richard 111.
Other ACT directors followed suit, albeit more
carefully. But Ball protege Laird Williamson has
abandoned all caution with his labored production
of The Matchmaker.
Thornton Wilder wrote a smooth, lively play
that most junior high school dramatists could not
butcher. Williamson manages to spoil it with ease,
transforming a delightful comedy into a crude
cartoon.
