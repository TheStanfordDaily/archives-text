# Quick-starting Card poloists face UCLA today
## 
### 
UCLA brought more than foot
balls to the Farm today.
It brought a ivater polo squad
a perennial power in the NCAA.
And the Bruins face their Cardinal
counterparts at 11 a.m. in what
could he called a hattle of the big
gies, because Stanford is also
pretty good at water polo.
Led by head coach Art Lambert,
in only his second season at Stan
ford, the Cards have already
racked up impressive victories
this season, including one over
two-time defending NCAA
champion California en route to
capturing the Northern California
Aquatic Federation tournament
championship last weekend at
DeAnza College.
Last year Stanford placed third
in the tourney, and wound up
sixth in the NCAA with a 14-11
record. Lambert expects better.
"I'm looking forward to great
things this season," he says,
"we're much more talented in
both experience and new person
nel than we were a year ago.
"Overall, this team is extremely
fast and very smart."
The Cards are led by high
scoring sophomore Hick
/ohannsen, John Roberts, Drew
McDonald, Paul Clark and goalie
Chris Dorst.
The remainder of a well
balanced line-up includes Tom
Angelo, Hobby Arnold, Brian Av
ery, Doug Burke, Marty Davis,
Dave Egan, Tom Elson, Jim
Evered, Sam Forencich, John
Goepp, Mike Jamond, Jack
Lorenze, Keith Ortiz and Dan
Pennington.
Lambert expects to be a chal
lenger for the NCAA title. And
only two years ago the Cards went
0-6 in the Pacific Eight. Not bad at
all.
