# "...and on defense, from Pago Pago ..."
## UCLA's Samoans are a broadcaster's – and a quarterback's – nightmare

SUBJECT: New Football Stadium
Last year we averaged 48,816
per game at the Los Angeles Col
iseum, and the questionnaire that
I received from our season ticket
holder cited the poor surround
ings as the reason.
I know you've suggested building
a new stadium in the San Fer
nando Valley, but how about

buildinga stadium in Pago Pago?
-Jerry
Building a stadium in Pago
Pago might actually increase the
Bruins' attendance. At least they
wouldn't have to fight USC for the
college audience.
Football is bigger than the Sa
moan governor's Swiss bank ac
count, in Pago Pago. The island
looks like a vast training camp.
The palagis have made live tele
casts of high school football
games the most popular show.
But you can also find studly
Samoans on the rosters of college

football teams all over the nation.
Take a look at the UCLA ros
ter . . . you'll probably need a
pronounciation guide.
There's Manu Tuiasosopo, An
thony Fao Pao, Terry Tautola and
Pele Pele 111, and if that isn't
enough to send broadcasters stut
tering to their press guides, then
nothing is.
And they may even send Mike
Cordova hurrying off the field
this afternoon.
Tautola is the Bruins' fourth
leading tackier, with 28 tackles
from his inside linebacker spot.
Tuiasosopo starts at the other in
side linebacker spot as a
freshman.
Tautola, a senior letterman,
serves as big brother to his Sa
moan teammates. "I'm the oldest
and I had to recruit 'em all and
there are some real close ties here.
Like blood relatives."
All cousins
It seems half the Samoans in
Westwood are cousins. Tautola,
Tuiasosopo and defensive tackle
Pele are cousins. And Tautola
and former Bruin Frank Man
umeleuna are roommates.
But the Samoan football pro
wess certainly doesn't run in the
blood. "It just comes from train
ing," Tautola. "I've been playing
since I was eight."
Tuiasosopo sounds like any
freshman starting for a major col
lege football team. "I'm super ex
cited," he said, "Stanford's a
tough team."

But are Samoan players better
athletes? Well they're certainly
bigger. Tuiasosopo is 6-foot-3 and
weighs 223 pounds and he's only
18 years old. Pele Pele 111 stands
6-4 and weighs 265 pounds and
he's still a growing boy.
"We're proud of being Sa
moan," says Tuiasosopo. "We
always keep active. Football
happened to be that kind of sport.
I like to do it from deep down
inside . . . that's what makes me
play football."
The Samoan players work to
gether in the summer. "I got to
gether with Terry this summer,"
said Tuiasosopo, "and he showed
me the agility drills and some
tricks."
They train a lot
Tautola says the studly Samoan
image comes from hard work.
"I've been playing football since I
was eight. It all comes from train
ing."
OK, but just look at the Bruin

defensive stats. Those Samoans
haven't made all that much dif
ference there. UCLA tied winless
Air Force, but Tautola and
Tuiasosopo agree that UCLA's de
fense won't be the same one you
saw on television against Ohio
State.
"Our defense has come to
gether," says Tautola. "Things
are all right; it's gotten better."
Impressed with Stanford
Both of them have looked at the
Army game films and both came
away impressed with the not-so
impressive Stanford running
game. "We've got to stop the run,"
said Tautola. "They're a good
running team."
And the Cardinal offensive line
impresses the pair. "Stanford has
a big offensive line," says
Tuiasosopo. "The coaches were
telling us that if they're up they'll
play a super game."
Along with a couple of studly
Samoans.

wouldn't have to fight USC for the
college audience.
Football is bigger than the Sa
moan governor's Swiss bank ac
count, in Pago Pago. The island
looks like a vast training camp.
The palagis have made live tele
casts of high school football
games the most popular show.
But you can also find studly
Samoans on the rosters of college

football teams all over the nation.
Take a look at the UCLA ros
ter . . . you'll probably need a
pronounciation guide.
There's Manu Tuiasosopo, An
thony Fao Pao, Terry Tautola and
Pele Pele 111, and if that isn't
enough to send broadcasters stut
tering to their press guides, then
nothing is.
And they may even send Mike
Cordova hurrying off the field
this afternoon.
Tautola is the Bruins' fourth
leading tackier, with 28 tackles
from his inside linebacker spot.
Tuiasosopo starts at the other in
side linebacker spot as a
freshman.
Tautola, a senior letterman,
serves as big brother to his Sa
moan teammates. "I'm the oldest
and I had to recruit 'em all and
there are some real close ties here.
Like blood relatives."
All cousins
It seems half the Samoans in
Westwood are cousins. Tautola,
Tuiasosopo and defensive tackle
Pele are cousins. And Tautola
and former Bruin Frank Man
umeleuna are roommates.
But the Samoan football pro
wess certainly doesn't run in the
blood. "It just comes from train
ing," Tautola. "I've been playing
since I was eight."
Tuiasosopo sounds like any
freshman starting for a major col
lege football team. "I'm super ex
cited," he said, "Stanford's a
tough team."

But are Samoan players better
athletes? Well they're certainly
bigger. Tuiasosopo is 6-foot-3 and
weighs 223 pounds and he's only
18 years old. Pele Pele 111 stands
6-4 and weighs 265 pounds and
he's still a growing boy.
"We're proud of being Sa
moan," says Tuiasosopo. "We
always keep active. Football
happened to be that kind of sport.
I like to do it from deep down
inside . . . that's what makes me
play football."
The Samoan players work to
gether in the summer. "I got to
gether with Terry this summer,"
said Tuiasosopo, "and he showed
me the agility drills and some
tricks."
They train a lot
Tautola says the studly Samoan
image comes from hard work.
"I've been playing football since I
was eight. It all comes from train
ing."
OK, but just look at the Bruin

defensive stats. Those Samoans
haven't made all that much dif
ference there. UCLA tied winless
Air Force, but Tautola and
Tuiasosopo agree that UCLA's de
fense won't be the same one you
saw on television against Ohio
State.
"Our defense has come to
gether," says Tautola. "Things
are all right; it's gotten better."
Impressed with Stanford
Both of them have looked at the
Army game films and both came
away impressed with the not-so
impressive Stanford running
game. "We've got to stop the run,"
said Tautola. "They're a good
running team."
And the Cardinal offensive line
impresses the pair. "Stanford has
a big offensive line," says
Tuiasosopo. "The coaches were
telling us that if they're up they'll
play a super game."
Along with a couple of studly
Samoans.

tering to their press guides, then
nothing is.
And they may even send Mike
Cordova hurrying off the field
this afternoon.
Tautola is the Bruins' fourth
leading tackier, with 28 tackles
from his inside linebacker spot.
Tuiasosopo starts at the other in
side linebacker spot as a
freshman.
Tautola, a senior letterman,
serves as big brother to his Sa
moan teammates. "I'm the oldest
and I had to recruit 'em all and
there are some real close ties here.
Like blood relatives."
All cousins
It seems half the Samoans in
Westwood are cousins. Tautola,
Tuiasosopo and defensive tackle
Pele are cousins. And Tautola
and former Bruin Frank Man
umeleuna are roommates.
But the Samoan football pro
wess certainly doesn't run in the
blood. "It just comes from train
ing," Tautola. "I've been playing
since I was eight."
Tuiasosopo sounds like any
freshman starting for a major col
lege football team. "I'm super ex
cited," he said, "Stanford's a
tough team."

But are Samoan players better
athletes? Well they're certainly
bigger. Tuiasosopo is 6-foot-3 and
weighs 223 pounds and he's only
18 years old. Pele Pele 111 stands
6-4 and weighs 265 pounds and
he's still a growing boy.
"We're proud of being Sa
moan," says Tuiasosopo. "We
always keep active. Football
happened to be that kind of sport.
I like to do it from deep down
inside . . . that's what makes me
play football."
The Samoan players work to
gether in the summer. "I got to
gether with Terry this summer,"
said Tuiasosopo, "and he showed
me the agility drills and some
tricks."
They train a lot
Tautola says the studly Samoan
image comes from hard work.
"I've been playing football since I
was eight. It all comes from train
ing."
OK, but just look at the Bruin

defensive stats. Those Samoans
haven't made all that much dif
ference there. UCLA tied winless
Air Force, but Tautola and
Tuiasosopo agree that UCLA's de
fense won't be the same one you
saw on television against Ohio
State.
"Our defense has come to
gether," says Tautola. "Things
are all right; it's gotten better."
Impressed with Stanford
Both of them have looked at the
Army game films and both came
away impressed with the not-so
impressive Stanford running
game. "We've got to stop the run,"
said Tautola. "They're a good
running team."
And the Cardinal offensive line
impresses the pair. "Stanford has
a big offensive line," says
Tuiasosopo. "The coaches were
telling us that if they're up they'll
play a super game."
Along with a couple of studly
Samoans.
