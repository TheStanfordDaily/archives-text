## The 						Pac-8 enters its second interesting week 
### DAVID TRADER 
The scramble for the Roses be
gins in earnest today with six
Pac-8 teams involved in confer
ence action. While the UCLA-
Stanford game appears to take
top billing, the other games
should prove interesting.
Undefeated and third-ranked
USC entertains Washington State
at the Coliseum. Both teams have
had injury problems. WSU has
lost two starting offensive players
for the season, quarterback Wally
Bennett with a knee injury and
halfback Dan Doornink, the
Cougars' leading rusher. South
ern Cal quarterback Vince Evans
sat out against lowa with a jam
med thumb, but is expected to
play today.
Rob Hertel, the Trojans reserve
quarterback, went all the way

against lowa as USC overcame an
early 10-0 deficit to win 27-16.
Phenomenal Ricky Bell rushed
for 163 yards to bring his season
total to 723. Solid USC leads the
league in both rushing offense
and total defense.
The Cougars, 2-2 overall, are
coming off of a 27-21 road loss to
Illinois. WSU, believe it or not, is
second to USC in rushing defense.
That factor should not stop the
league leading Trojans, although
the last two times Washington
State has been at the Coliseum
it's made the games interesting.
Cal should have little trouble in
defeating the winless Oregon
Ducks, even though it is rumored
that the Bears' quarterback, Joe
Roth, may not play.
The Bear offense survived a
scare by San Jose State last week

when Roth fired a 46-yard pass to
speedy Wesley Walker with 1:08
remaining to beat the Spartans,
27-24.
Oregon is by no means a
pushover and will be waiting for
the aerial attack as the Ducks are
number one in pass defense.
Northwestern schools
Washington and Oregon State
both step outside the league, with
the Huskies facing seventh
ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa
and the Beavers staying in Cor
vallis to tangle with Colorado
State.
Washington has won its last
two games since losing road con
tests to Arizona State and Texas.
Oregon State is winless in four
games, losing last week to the
number one College Division team,
Grambling.

for the season, quarterback Wally
Bennett with a knee injury and
halfback Dan Doornink, the
Cougars' leading rusher. South
ern Cal quarterback Vince Evans
sat out against lowa with a jam
med thumb, but is expected to
play today.
Rob Hertel, the Trojans reserve
quarterback, went all the way

against lowa as USC overcame an
early 10-0 deficit to win 27-16.
Phenomenal Ricky Bell rushed
for 163 yards to bring his season
total to 723. Solid USC leads the
league in both rushing offense
and total defense.
The Cougars, 2-2 overall, are
coming off of a 27-21 road loss to
Illinois. WSU, believe it or not, is
second to USC in rushing defense.
That factor should not stop the
league leading Trojans, although
the last two times Washington
State has been at the Coliseum
it's made the games interesting.
Cal should have little trouble in
defeating the winless Oregon
Ducks, even though it is rumored
that the Bears' quarterback, Joe
Roth, may not play.
The Bear offense survived a
scare by San Jose State last week

when Roth fired a 46-yard pass to
speedy Wesley Walker with 1:08
remaining to beat the Spartans,
27-24.
Oregon is by no means a
pushover and will be waiting for
the aerial attack as the Ducks are
number one in pass defense.
Northwestern schools
Washington and Oregon State
both step outside the league, with
the Huskies facing seventh
ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa
and the Beavers staying in Cor
vallis to tangle with Colorado
State.
Washington has won its last
two games since losing road con
tests to Arizona State and Texas.
Oregon State is winless in four
games, losing last week to the
number one College Division team,
Grambling.
