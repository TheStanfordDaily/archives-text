# Notes from the Band
## 
### BLAINE E. PALMER (LSJUMB Announcer 
For some time now, the Stanford Band has
realized that virtually no one in the stands can
actually tell what it is doing on the field. They
know that the pre-game and halftime shows
are supposed to be a little risque, hopefully
funny, satirical, and preferably slightly Left
Wing (Republicans are always good for a laugh
in the student crowd). But in terms of actually
understanding what the show is about, with
the bad P.A. system, the illegible formations
and their general obscurity, the average viewer
has no idea what the connection is between,
say, forming a backwards safety pin and play
ing the song "Friendship Train."
Nonetheless, it has been proposed that we try
letting you in on the joke, and tell you approx
imately what's supposed to happen in today's
show.
PREGAME:
The Pregame show starts out with the tradi
tional fanfare, then the downfield march (sic)
to the accompaniment of "Come Join the Band"
(Any other title by which you know the song is
erroneous). Then the Band forms the Axe, the
traditional symbol of Stanford spirit. This
much happens every week.
This week's formation will be a salute to
UCLA, by reminding them of last Saturday's
game. Spelling out OHIO ST, we suggest that
that was a tough one to dump, with the song
"So Very Hard to Go".
Next, we recognize Ralph Phillips'great in
terception, by spelling out SNATCH (hyphe
nated for your confusion), and the following
run that just kept going for more and more,
taking all comers like a "Long Train Runnin'."
Finally the Incomparables will form the let
ters USA, for the playing of the National An
them, then leave the scene of the crime to
"American Band."

HALFTIME:
The Halftime show takes a look at one of our
favorite institutions: Stanford University (or
ganized 1891). We feel that since the University
has given us so much, it's time we gave them a
little of it back.
The first formation is an Indian Head, some
thing the University hasn't given us for about
three years now. You see, we want to recognize
not only the Administration (an easier target
than a Republican), but also such fine student
organizations as the ASSU Senate. For this
brief re-appearance of our deep-seated pre
judices, we play "Long Time No See."
Reminded of the words of our founder: "a
school for the poor young men and women of
California .. . "who couldn't afford the Uni
versity of California tuition, we play "My Old
School," thinking of the good old days when
Stanford had, as out spellout says, NO TUIT
(--ion).
The parking situation is the next object of our
blunt wit, as we form a screwdriver and screws
to symbolize the action recommended last year
by the "Carpenter" Report, and advise stu
dents to "Listen What the Man Says."
Our last shot is at the Housing Office (talk
about sitting ducks). Suggesting the Annual
Spring Draw as one of the "Games People
Play" (by the Spinnersâ€”not the one by Joe
South, you honky), the last formation expres
ses hope that your draw number will GO LOW.
Freshman: this is the part they didn't tell you
about.
Well, if by now you're convinced that ignor
ance was a bliss, we remind you that this is
only what we are planning to put on. So if you
prefer to let your imagination wander, as may
some of our members when things become a
little hazy and that afternoon sun starts to get to
you, you can never tell what might appear
down there on the field. >
