# The 						fight for second begins anew
## and the key is the QB 
### DAN PYNE 
If Leland Stanford Junior
University's head coach is edgy,
he probably has a right to be. For
weeks — for years — people,
especially newspaper reporters
with porkpie hats and big cigars,
have been asking him the same
inevitable question.
It's a quarterback fixation; the
names have changed, the
complaints haven't. There was this
guy Boryla, Mike Boryla, who
threw a lot of passes a couple
years ago. And now there's
another Mike, Cordova, and this
Guy Benjamin (pun intended),
and Jerry Waldvogel, and
presumably in a couple years
everyone will say a lot of pleasant
and/or unpleasant things about
Steve Dils (the redshirt) and Turk
Schonert (the freshperson),
depending upon who does what
when. And Head Coach Jack
Christiansen will still be edgy.
The major problem is not that
Christiansen has trouble finding
quarterbacks. The major problem
is that Chris finds too many good
quarterbacks at once. It is not
entirely implausible that, were
they attending other Pacific Eight
schools, Cordova, Benjamin and
Waldvogel would all be starting
quarterbacks.
But Jack Christiansen would
still be edgy. For other reasons.
UCLA Head Coach Dick
Vermeil doesn't have such
problems. He's only got one
quarterback, who runs slightly
better than any of the Cardinal
offensive backfield, and throws
slightly worse than the Card QBs.
This does not mean that Dick
Vermeil isn't edgy. He is.
"In my mind," Vermeil said
earlier this week, "Stanford is the
second-best team in the Pac-8. We
have to beat them to be second
best." What Vermeil needs is a
way to do it. The Bruins may have
the material, but after a 41-20
shellacking at the hands of Ohio
State last week and a 20-20 tie
with unheralded (and winless)
Air Force the week before, people
are beginning to wonder whether

the once-nationally-ranked
Grizzlers can put it all together
any more.
One question mark is that
running quarterback, John
Sciarra, who despite respectable
stats has not lived up to
pre-season, Heisman Trophy
predictions. The Bruin offense
keys around him — if Sciarra runs
the Veer well, UCLA can be
devastating. If his offense
sputters, the Bruins are in trouble,
because their defense is not all
that solid. Especially the pass
defense. Vermeil is aware of it.
"I don't think we can stop
Cordova, but I do think we can
contain him," Vermeil said,
noting that the Cards "can run,
but they're not a great running
team."
Against Ohio State, Vermeil
said, "we played some defensive
plays as well as they can be
played, but we didn't do it for the
entire game. You might say,
'Geez, they scored 41 points
against you,' but we played them
even for three quarters." UCLA
fell behind 28-7 in the first half in
that contest.
Vermeil also disclosed early in
the week that Sciarra was injured
after UCLA's victory over
Tennessee, a "minor" shoulder
separation, which somewhat
explains his lackluster
performances against both Air
Force (in which he was 5-12 with
three key interceptions) and the
Buckeyes.
The Bruin quarterback is still
up and running, however,
averaging almost 60 yards per
game. When combined with
halfbacks Eddie Ayers and
Wendell Tyler, who together total
over 140 yards rushing per game,
his option-offense presents a
considerable problem for
Stanford's rush-defense.
Then again, so did Michigan.
The off-and-on Bruin
secondary is led by cornerback
Barney Person, who leads the
Pac-8 in interceptions with four.
Vermeil said his defense may let
the Cards have the short passes

while trying to prevent the bomb.
"I hope they have to pass 50
times because if they can run and
pass on us we're in trouble."
That trouble is what
Christiansen wants.
"Defensively, [UCLA] might
be the biggest team we've faced in
the front line. The nose guard,
Frazier, is just an outstanding
football player. He's definitely an
All-America candidate. The
freshman from San Jose, Pete
Pele, is also an excellent player."
Christiansen seems more
concerned about the Bruin
offensive attack. "Though we've
faced option teams before, in
Michigan and Army, UCLA
presents a different kind of option
attack. It's a challenge to our
defensive players to react
correctly to the play, defeat the
blocks, and get to the ball carrier.
"UCLA is a class football
team."
As for Sciarra, Christiansen
calls him "an outstanding athlete.
We've known that since his

freshman year. He does a great job
running the option. He fakes and
pitches very well, plus he's an
excellent ballcarrier."
Sciarra's primary aerial target is
long-haired split-end Norm
Anderson who has also been
hampered by an injury, according
to Vermeil. But Anderson hasn't
been used extensively, to say the
least.
It appears to be the classic
match-up. Cordova the passer
against Sciarra the runner. The
outcome, inevitably, will depend
upon the performance of both;
the score, historically, should be
close.
As Vermeil aptly put it, this
game will decide who is number
two in the conference (though
California may still be around to
complain).
Number one? "Who do you
think?" said Vermeil. "USC, of
course."
But that's a whole different
ball game ...

shellacking at the hands of Ohio
State last week and a 20-20 tie
with unheralded (and winless)
Air Force the week before, people
are beginning to wonder whether

the once-nationally-ranked
Grizzlers can put it all together
any more.
One question mark is that
running quarterback, John
Sciarra, who despite respectable
stats has not lived up to
pre-season, Heisman Trophy
predictions. The Bruin offense
keys around him — if Sciarra runs
the Veer well, UCLA can be
devastating. If his offense
sputters, the Bruins are in trouble,
because their defense is not all
that solid. Especially the pass
defense. Vermeil is aware of it.
"I don't think we can stop
Cordova, but I do think we can
contain him," Vermeil said,
noting that the Cards "can run,
but they're not a great running
team."
Against Ohio State, Vermeil
said, "we played some defensive
plays as well as they can be
played, but we didn't do it for the
entire game. You might say,
'Geez, they scored 41 points
against you,' but we played them
even for three quarters." UCLA
fell behind 28-7 in the first half in
that contest.
Vermeil also disclosed early in
the week that Sciarra was injured
after UCLA's victory over
Tennessee, a "minor" shoulder
separation, which somewhat
explains his lackluster
performances against both Air
Force (in which he was 5-12 with
three key interceptions) and the
Buckeyes.
The Bruin quarterback is still
up and running, however,
averaging almost 60 yards per
game. When combined with
halfbacks Eddie Ayers and
Wendell Tyler, who together total
over 140 yards rushing per game,
his option-offense presents a
considerable problem for
Stanford's rush-defense.
Then again, so did Michigan.
The off-and-on Bruin
secondary is led by cornerback
Barney Person, who leads the
Pac-8 in interceptions with four.
Vermeil said his defense may let
the Cards have the short passes

while trying to prevent the bomb.
"I hope they have to pass 50
times because if they can run and
pass on us we're in trouble."
That trouble is what
Christiansen wants.
"Defensively, [UCLA] might
be the biggest team we've faced in
the front line. The nose guard,
Frazier, is just an outstanding
football player. He's definitely an
All-America candidate. The
freshman from San Jose, Pete
Pele, is also an excellent player."
Christiansen seems more
concerned about the Bruin
offensive attack. "Though we've
faced option teams before, in
Michigan and Army, UCLA
presents a different kind of option
attack. It's a challenge to our
defensive players to react
correctly to the play, defeat the
blocks, and get to the ball carrier.
"UCLA is a class football
team."
As for Sciarra, Christiansen
calls him "an outstanding athlete.
We've known that since his

freshman year. He does a great job
running the option. He fakes and
pitches very well, plus he's an
excellent ballcarrier."
Sciarra's primary aerial target is
long-haired split-end Norm
Anderson who has also been
hampered by an injury, according
to Vermeil. But Anderson hasn't
been used extensively, to say the
least.
It appears to be the classic
match-up. Cordova the passer
against Sciarra the runner. The
outcome, inevitably, will depend
upon the performance of both;
the score, historically, should be
close.
As Vermeil aptly put it, this
game will decide who is number
two in the conference (though
California may still be around to
complain).
Number one? "Who do you
think?" said Vermeil. "USC, of
course."
But that's a whole different
ball game ...

If Leland Stanford Junior
University's head coach is edgy,
he probably has a right to be. For
weeks — for years — people,
especially newspaper reporters
with porkpie hats and big cigars,
have been asking him the same
inevitable question.
It's a quarterback fixation; the
names have changed, the
complaints haven't. There was this
guy Boryla, Mike Boryla, who
threw a lot of passes a couple
years ago. And now there's
another Mike, Cordova, and this
Guy Benjamin (pun intended),
and Jerry Waldvogel, and
presumably in a couple years
everyone will say a lot of pleasant
and/or unpleasant things about
Steve Dils (the redshirt) and Turk
Schonert (the freshperson),
depending upon who does what
when. And Head Coach Jack
Christiansen will still be edgy.
The major problem is not that
Christiansen has trouble finding
quarterbacks. The major problem
is that Chris finds too many good
quarterbacks at once. It is not
entirely implausible that, were
they attending other Pacific Eight
schools, Cordova, Benjamin and
Waldvogel would all be starting
quarterbacks.
But Jack Christiansen would
still be edgy. For other reasons.
UCLA Head Coach Dick
Vermeil doesn't have such

quarterback, who runs slightly
better than any of the Cardinal
offensive backfield, and throws
slightly worse than the Card QBs.

over 140 yards rushing per game,
his option-offense presents a
considerable problem for
Stanford's rush-defense.
Then again, so did Michigan.
The off-and-on Bruin
secondary is led by cornerback
Barney Person, who leads the
Pac-8 in interceptions with four.
Vermeil said his defense may let
the Cards have the short passes

while trying to prevent the bomb.
"I hope they have to pass 50
times because if they can run and
pass on us we're in trouble."
That trouble is what
Christiansen wants.
"Defensively, [UCLA] might
be the biggest team we've faced in
the front line. The nose guard,
Frazier, is just an outstanding
football player. He's definitely an
All-America candidate. The
freshman from San Jose, Pete
Pele, is also an excellent player."
Christiansen seems more
concerned about the Bruin
offensive attack. "Though we've
faced option teams before, in
Michigan and Army, UCLA
presents a different kind of option
attack. It's a challenge to our
defensive players to react
correctly to the play, defeat the
blocks, and get to the ball carrier.
"UCLA is a class football
team."
As for Sciarra, Christiansen
calls him "an outstanding athlete.
We've known that since his

freshman year. He does a great job
running the option. He fakes and
pitches very well, plus he's an
excellent ballcarrier."
Sciarra's primary aerial target is
long-haired split-end Norm
Anderson who has also been
hampered by an injury, according
to Vermeil. But Anderson hasn't
been used extensively, to say the
least.
It appears to be the classic
match-up. Cordova the passer
against Sciarra the runner. The
outcome, inevitably, will depend
upon the performance of both;
the score, historically, should be
close.
As Vermeil aptly put it, this
game will decide who is number
two in the conference (though
California may still be around to
complain).
Number one? "Who do you
think?" said Vermeil. "USC, of
course."
But that's a whole different
ball game ...

If Leland Stanford Junior
University's head coach is edgy,
he probably has a right to be. For
weeks — for years — people,
especially newspaper reporters
with porkpie hats and big cigars,
have been asking him the same
inevitable question.
It's a quarterback fixation; the
names have changed, the
complaints haven't. There was this
guy Boryla, Mike Boryla, who
threw a lot of passes a couple
years ago. And now there's
another Mike, Cordova, and this
Guy Benjamin (pun intended),
and Jerry Waldvogel, and
presumably in a couple years
everyone will say a lot of pleasant
and/or unpleasant things about
Steve Dils (the redshirt) and Turk
Schonert (the freshperson),
depending upon who does what
when. And Head Coach Jack
Christiansen will still be edgy.
The major problem is not that
Christiansen has trouble finding
quarterbacks. The major problem
is that Chris finds too many good
quarterbacks at once. It is not
entirely implausible that, were
they attending other Pacific Eight
schools, Cordova, Benjamin and
Waldvogel would all be starting
quarterbacks.
But Jack Christiansen would
still be edgy. For other reasons.
UCLA Head Coach Dick
Vermeil doesn't have such
problems. He's only got one
quarterback, who runs slightly
better than any of the Cardinal
offensive backfield, and throws
slightly worse than the Card QBs.
This does not mean that Dick
Vermeil isn't edgy. He is.
"In my mind," Vermeil said
earlier this week, "Stanford is the
second-best team in the Pac-8. We
have to beat them to be second
best." What Vermeil needs is a
way to do it. The Bruins may have
the material, but after a 41-20
shellacking at the hands of Ohio
State last week and a 20-20 tie
with unheralded (and winless)
Air Force the week before, people
are beginning to wonder whether

the once-nationally-ranked
Grizzlers can put it all together
any more.
One question mark is that
running quarterback, John
Sciarra, who despite respectable
stats has not lived up to
pre-season, Heisman Trophy
predictions. The Bruin offense
keys around him — if Sciarra runs
the Veer well, UCLA can be
devastating. If his offense
sputters, the Bruins are in trouble,
because their defense is not all
that solid. Especially the pass
defense. Vermeil is aware of it.
"I don't think we can stop
Cordova, but I do think we can
contain him," Vermeil said,
noting that the Cards "can run,
but they're not a great running
team."
Against Ohio State, Vermeil
said, "we played some defensive
plays as well as they can be
played, but we didn't do it for the
entire game. You might say,
'Geez, they scored 41 points
against you,' but we played them
even for three quarters." UCLA
fell behind 28-7 in the first half in
that contest.
Vermeil also disclosed early in
the week that Sciarra was injured
after UCLA's victory over
Tennessee, a "minor" shoulder
separation, which somewhat
explains his lackluster
performances against both Air
Force (in which he was 5-12 with
three key interceptions) and the
Buckeyes.
The Bruin quarterback is still
up and running, however,
averaging almost 60 yards per
game. When combined with
halfbacks Eddie Ayers and
Wendell Tyler, who together total
over 140 yards rushing per game,
his option-offense presents a
considerable problem for
Stanford's rush-defense.
Then again, so did Michigan.
