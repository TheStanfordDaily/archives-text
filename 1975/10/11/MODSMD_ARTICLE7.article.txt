# The 						kicker's become a headline
## Mike Langford consistently puts the pig through the uprights

The ball wobbled, drifted to the
right, wobbled some more and fi
nally arched over and between a
soon-to-be-destroyed pair of goal
posts.
When Langford finally looked
up, "I just saw people running at
me." Those people mobbed him,
hugged him, lifted him up be
cause the nervous A/I-American
boy had just become one of the Big
Game's biggest heroes, the guy
whose third field goal of the day
won it, 22-20.

The Stanford Daily
Nov. 25, 1974.
Chronologically, it's been over
10 months since The Kick.
Emotionally, to those who at
tended the 1974 Big Game, it may
seem more recent than last week's
Army game.
Mike Langford, whose kick
climaxed an entire season, re
minisced vividly the other day
after practice.
"I've had a lot of time to think
about that kick," he said. "I
thought the ball was going to go
way to the right. That's the way it
felt. When I looked up and saw
the ball straight in front of me 1
was kind of confused.
"I didn't want to get too emo
tional (after The Kick). But I took
two steps toward the sideline,
saw the team running toward me
and started jumping up and
down. I couldn't hold it back."

Whereas Langford was known
mainly as "an obscure junior col
lege transfer" before The Kick (if
he was known at all), his popular
ity now equals or exceeds Mike
Cordova's notoriety.
"I've been getting a lot of ink,"
Langford said. "After one kick all
of a sudden I'm a great kicker. I
guess that's what it takes — the
right kick at the right time — to
put you in the spotlight.
"I went to about eight banquets
just because of that one kick. I've
enjoyed being recognized. It (the
winning field goal) is not done
every day. People were curious
about my reaction."
Although Langford's Big Game
heroics have popularized his
name, they have at times
obscured his overall kicking re
cord.
Fourth leading kicker
Langford, a senior from Atwa
ter, Ca., was the fourth leading
collegiate field goal kicker in the
nation last year, hitting 15 of 26
attempts. Add to that four-of-four
this year and Langford is 19 for 30
in his Stanford career, including
three field goals from 50 yards or
beyond and five successes from
40-50 yards.
Langford's longest field goal at
Stanford measured 52 yards
against Michigan in 1974, equal
ing his longest at Merced Junior
College.
"Langford is the surest bet on
this year's team to be drafted,"
says Stanford defensive coor

dinator Norb Hecker, former
head coach of the Atlanta Fal
cons.
A good pro choice
Hecker knows what he's talk
ing about. Denver Bronco scout
Mac Speedie has been scrutiniz
ing Langford's kicking in prac
tice this week. Denver may be
looking for someone to eventually
replace Jim Turner, its aging
place kicker.
If it were up to Langford, he'd
be in San Diego next year. "I'd

like to stay in the South, some
place where it's warm. I don't like
cold weather. It was what.. . like
60 or 65 degrees yesterday? I was
tight and couldn't get loose. San
Diego's a really nice place — I've
been there a few times."
Another of Langford's profes
sional concerns is the round in
which he will be drafted.
"If I go anywhere in the top 10,"
he said, "I'll be happy. (The pro
football draft consists of 17
rounds.) I dream of someone cal-

ling me and saying I was drafted
in the fifth round.
Hard to break in
"It's hard to break in as a
kicker, but I know I'll get the
chance to try out either as a free
agent or as a draftee. I'll give it the
best try I can."
And if he doesn't make it in the
pros? "It's up in the air. I'd be in
the same boat as a lot of people
when they get out of college."
Langford is a return to the past,
before the influx of diminutive,
sidewinding foreign kickers who
were told to kick the funny
looking-ball through the posts
and then wonder how many
points they had just scored. He is
big — 6-2, 215 lbs. — he kicks
straight on, he is American and
he is a former linebacker
thoroughly familiar with the
rules of his sport.
Dull maybe, but effective.
With his light brown, almost
reddish hair of medium length
and his rectangular wire-rimmed
glasses, Langford looks like a

slim Alex Karras, the ABC broad
caster and former defensive
tackle of the Detroit Lions. His
speech and manner are casual
and uncondescending, even
when discussing the competition
he has faced from junior college
transfer Mike Michel since last
spTing.
Unnerved by Michel
"I was pretty unnerved,"
Langford said about the arrival of
the kicker-defensive back. "He
came in with a real strong leg and
good accuracy. He was better
than I was in the spring, and I
worried about it a lot."
Unnecessarily, as it turned out.
