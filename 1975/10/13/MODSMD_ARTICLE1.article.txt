# BSU president outlines plans
## 
### LAURA KENNEDY 
Kodney Johnson, acting president
of the Black Students Union (BSU),
has the job of representing special
black interests, while making sure
that black students here are "in the
mainstream" of University life.
"We're interested in black student
unity, but I want to reach out further.
The world isn't just confined ot us," he
said.
Johnson sees the BSU and other
black organizations on campus at» -
"means of helping in a transition from
the experience of a black, low-income
world" to Stanford.
He said he hopes that, at some point
in the future, special campus organi
zations would not be needed to repre
sent black interests. Johnson com
pared the current situation, however,
to "two people running a race, but one
has a 50 yard advantage in a 150-yard
race."
While not denying that low-income
white students face the same cultural
and financial disadvantages as low
income black students, Johnson said,
"There is this vibration, understand
ing between black people, a helping
attitude perpetuated by the BSU."
Johnson will focus the BSU more on
service projects this year rather than
on social activities. The organization
is contemplating a possible fund
raiser for the scholarship and collect
ing food for a local community
agency.
The BSU is also planning activities
during Black Liberation Month in
February, a talent show and
Thanksgiving dinner for black stu
dents who live too far away to go
home, according to Johnson.
Phone book
As a means of encouraging black
students to help each other with their
homework the BSU is considering
compiling a phone book of black stu
dents. with majors listed.
The BSU is also encouraging its

members to run for ASSU Senate, and
to participate in University
decision-making.
If the BSU holds parties this year,
Johnson would like to see them held in
a more central location than Olivo-
Magnolia, the black theme house in
Lagunita. He advocates the same
security measures that wer v instituted
late last year. The BSU probably will
not publicize its functions outside the
Stanford community, Johnson said.
Part of the function of the BSU is
simply to "discuss ideas and ideals"
relating to the black student and his
role at Stanford. Johnson hopes to fos
ter discussion by holding rap sessions
led by black student leaders and black
alumni.
Acting president
Johnson remains acting president of
the BSU until he is confirmed by the
membership later this month since a
quorum of 36 votes could not be raised
lat year to elect officers.
Johnson conceded ftiat there
seemed to be a lower level of black
involvement than during theOO's and
early 70's.
Nevertheless, he feels the BSU
would have sufficient strength to
carry out its activities. Johnson hopes
to spread involvement through a
committee system, rather than focus
ing on a small cory of officers. He
noted that all black students are au
tomatically members of the BSU.
Johnson, a sophomore history
major, not only was active in the BSU
last year, but also founded SCAR
(Stanford Committee Against Ra
cism). This group of black and white
students grew out of a SWOPSI course
on racism in education that Johnson
helped teach.
The fate of SCAR this year is uncer
tain. Johnson said the group, which
never numbered more than 20 or 30
members, may merge with Students
for Equity.

income black students, Johnson said,
"There is this vibration, understand
ing between black people, a helping
attitude perpetuated by the BSU."
Johnson will focus the BSU more on
service projects this year rather than
on social activities. The organization
is contemplating a possible fund
raiser for the scholarship and collect
ing food for a local community
agency.
The BSU is also planning activities
during Black Liberation Month in
February, a talent show and
Thanksgiving dinner for black stu
dents who live too far away to go
home, according to Johnson.
Phone book
As a means of encouraging black
students to help each other with their
homework the BSU is considering
compiling a phone book of black stu
dents. with majors listed.
The BSU is also encouraging its

members to run for ASSU Senate, and
to participate in University
decision-making.
If the BSU holds parties this year,
Johnson would like to see them held in
a more central location than Olivo-
Magnolia, the black theme house in
Lagunita. He advocates the same
security measures that wer v instituted
late last year. The BSU probably will
not publicize its functions outside the
Stanford community, Johnson said.
Part of the function of the BSU is
simply to "discuss ideas and ideals"
relating to the black student and his
role at Stanford. Johnson hopes to fos
ter discussion by holding rap sessions
led by black student leaders and black
alumni.
Acting president
Johnson remains acting president of
the BSU until he is confirmed by the
membership later this month since a
quorum of 36 votes could not be raised
lat year to elect officers.
Johnson conceded ftiat there
seemed to be a lower level of black
involvement than during theOO's and
early 70's.
Nevertheless, he feels the BSU
would have sufficient strength to
carry out its activities. Johnson hopes
to spread involvement through a
committee system, rather than focus
ing on a small cory of officers. He
noted that all black students are au
tomatically members of the BSU.
Johnson, a sophomore history
major, not only was active in the BSU
last year, but also founded SCAR
(Stanford Committee Against Ra
cism). This group of black and white
students grew out of a SWOPSI course
on racism in education that Johnson
helped teach.
The fate of SCAR this year is uncer
tain. Johnson said the group, which
never numbered more than 20 or 30
members, may merge with Students
for Equity.
Kodney Johnson, acting president
of the Black Students Union (BSU),
has the job of representing special
black interests, while making sure
that black students here are "in the
mainstream" of University life.
"We're interested in black student
unity, but I want to reach out further.
The world isn't just confined ot us," he
said.
Johnson sees the BSU and other
black organizations on campus at» -
"means of helping in a transition from
the experience of a black, low-income
world" to Stanford.
He said he hopes that, at some point
in the future, special campus organi
zations would not be needed to repre
sent black interests. Johnson com
pared the current situation, however,
to "two people running a race, but one
has a 50 yard advantage in a 150-yard
race."
While not denying that low-income
white students face the same cultural
and financial disadvantages as low
income black students, Johnson said,
"There is this vibration, understand
ing between black people, a helping
attitude perpetuated by the BSU."
