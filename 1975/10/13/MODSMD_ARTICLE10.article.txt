# Beware 'Moonie' zealots
## 
### 
On the steps of Tresidder students will bump
into a group with a large poster, the Creative
Community Project. If one stops and listens to
their rap, it sounds real good: a loving, sharing
way of life, a universal viewpoint, communal
farming.
They'll ask you to their house for dinner, invite
you to spend a weekend on their farm. And be
cause we all need food and friends, since we're
all looking for peace and purpose in life, many of
us will accept.
But a student who goes to their Booneville farm
will never see the Stanford Farm again.
There are the Moon people, the zombies of Rev.
Sun Myung Moon of Korea. Every moment on the
farm is spent holding hands, singing and praying
to "Heavenly Father." Listening to lectures full of
mysticism and fundamental Christianity.
Screaming and shouting and making fun of sci
ence, Darwin and evolution.
Brainwashing
Peer pressure is enormous; brainwashing is
complete.
The Stanford student will write home to his
parents (all his mail — outgoing and incoming —
will be censored) informing them that he has

Gene Gordon

dropped out of school and joined a commune. If,
after that, his parents are still sending him
money, it will all belong to "The Family."
Since no extramarital sex is allowed, he will
one day wish to marry. Then he will submit a list
of five possible mates and one will be chosen for
him.
Altered politics
His politics will become that of a vicious anti
communist. His master Moon trains the military
and secret police of dictator Park Chung Hee in
South Korea. The student, now recruiting other
young people, is in effect a Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) agent, since Moon works with the
CIA.
Even after the weekend on the farm, the student
will not know who his "master" is, to whom he
has been shouting and singing and praying with
out end.
After listening to the pleasant purveyors of de
ception, the student should make it across the
plaza to the library. There a bit of research will
uncover the frightening story, the nightmare
which could begin with a friendly talk on the
steps of Tresidder.
(Gene Gordon is a resident of Palo Alto.)
