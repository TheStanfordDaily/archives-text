# Eliminate graduation speaker
## 
### 
The Committee to Select the
Commencement Speaker
should consider the elimination
of a commencement guest
speaker.
Before explaining why, it
would be well to explain two of
my biases in this matter.
First, I like and value the
commencement exercise. It is a
useful ritual; a useful commun
ity exercise that is colorful,
pleasant, and which generates
good feelings within and among

most of the participants.
I know that not all feel that
way, but most who participate
do and the vast majority of those
who could participate in fact do
so. I see the elimination of the
commencement speaker as a
way to strengthen and improve
the event.
'Family' matter
The second bias follows from
the first. I have never liked out
side commencement speakers.
Commencement is a celebration
of events that have occurred
within the several communities
that combine to make a Univer
sity; it is a "family" affair.
A non-Stanford speaker has
little chance of relating success
fully to the University, to the
event or to the individuals who
make up the event.
A Stanford speaker (aside
from the president who cus
tomarily has a few remarks
anyway) is unlikely to be of
great intrest to more than one of
the groups attending com
mencement. And these are times
when the choice of the speaker
ifciikely to offend some.
Speaker irrelevant
My opinions about the irrele
vance of commencement speak
ers were unchanged during my
10 years as a dean at a small
college where there was a cus
tom (and adequate bequest dol
lars to back it up) to invite only
those persons to speak who
could spend one or two weeks
on the campus to interact with
it. The speakers (excepting one
— Robert Coles) were still ir
relevant to the event. As here,

their names were soon forgotten
and their words instantly lost,
indeed if gotten at all.
I mention my bias here only to
suggest that it may be a bias that
is held more generally.
Selecting a speaker was
deeply divisive last year; and
deeply troubling to very many
who were touched by the debate
and the event. I see every indica
tion that these wounds will be
reopened this year — and in
years to come. We may have
reached a point where group as
sertiveness has dulled our
capacity to seek a sensitive con
sensus.
Judgment lost
If the Daily reports are accu
rate, the selection process will
become quite political so as to
avoid the harder and lonelier
task of making good judgments.
Already there are regular calls
for organizers and followers for
a campaign to have a profes
sional comedian on the 1975
commencement platform.
These are efforts of sincere
people with good motives, but
with limited inclination to un
derstand the great diversity in a
commencement or to project
themselves into the mental set of
the many people who will com
bine that day to make com
mencement. The divisiveness is
increasing — not abating.
Method not key
But some would argue that we
should simply change the way
we choose speakers; involve the
parents, spouses, the faculty, the
administration, and graduate
and professional students more
than before.

James Lyons

Aside from the fact that that
argument suggests that speak
ers were a good idea to begin
with, it may also remind some
that we are entering an era
when we can no longer indulge
in the expending for trivia of
University dollars (a relatively
small amount) and human
energy (an enormous amount
when a silly or politically un
palatable speaker is selected).
Useless debate
At a time when we are seeking
to assert and fund first
priorities, a debate about the
usefulness or appropriateness
of Woody Allen can at best be
regarded as insensitive.
The disputes of last year
failed to gain the level of debate
and dialogue that could have
made the whole affair educa
tionally useful and relevant and
thus worth the effort. For the
most part we could not rise
above a fairly low level of divi
sive, emotional, and rhetorical
nonsense.
Would it be more fruitful to
ask whether the human and dol
lar resources now expended on
commencement speakers and
arguing about commencement
speakers could be used to im
prove the event? Could such a
move serve to re-create the
separate and more personable
degree ceremonies for the
Humanities and Sciences stu
dents and faculty and to provide
us all with the bonus of 20 fewer
minutes under that hot June sun
in Frost?

The Committee to Select the
Commencement Speaker
should consider the elimination
of a commencement guest
speaker.
Before explaining why, it
would be well to explain two of
my biases in this matter.
First, I like and value the
commencement exercise. It is a
useful ritual; a useful commun
ity exercise that is colorful,
pleasant, and which generates
good feelings within and among

most of the participants.
I know that not all feel that
way, but most who participate
do and the vast majority of those
who could participate in fact do
so. I see the elimination of the
commencement speaker as a
way to strengthen and improve
the event.
'Family' matter
The second bias follows from
the first. I have never liked out
side commencement speakers.
Commencement is a celebration
of events that have occurred
within the several communities
that combine to make a Univer
sity; it is a "family" affair.
A non-Stanford speaker has
little chance of relating success
fully to the University, to the
event or to the individuals who
make up the event.
A Stanford speaker (aside
from the president who cus
tomarily has a few remarks
anyway) is unlikely to be of
great intrest to more than one of
the groups attending com
mencement. And these are times
when the choice of the speaker
ifciikely to offend some.
Speaker irrelevant
My opinions about the irrele
vance of commencement speak
ers were unchanged during my
10 years as a dean at a small
college where there was a cus
tom (and adequate bequest dol
lars to back it up) to invite only
those persons to speak who
could spend one or two weeks
on the campus to interact with
it. The speakers (excepting one
— Robert Coles) were still ir
relevant to the event. As here,

their names were soon forgotten
and their words instantly lost,
indeed if gotten at all.
I mention my bias here only to
suggest that it may be a bias that
is held more generally.
Selecting a speaker was
deeply divisive last year; and
deeply troubling to very many
who were touched by the debate
and the event. I see every indica
tion that these wounds will be
reopened this year — and in
years to come. We may have
reached a point where group as
sertiveness has dulled our
capacity to seek a sensitive con
sensus.
Judgment lost
If the Daily reports are accu
rate, the selection process will
become quite political so as to
avoid the harder and lonelier
task of making good judgments.
Already there are regular calls
for organizers and followers for
a campaign to have a profes
sional comedian on the 1975
commencement platform.
These are efforts of sincere
people with good motives, but
with limited inclination to un
derstand the great diversity in a
commencement or to project
themselves into the mental set of
the many people who will com
bine that day to make com
mencement. The divisiveness is
increasing — not abating.
Method not key
But some would argue that we
should simply change the way
we choose speakers; involve the
parents, spouses, the faculty, the
administration, and graduate
and professional students more
than before.

James Lyons

Aside from the fact that that
argument suggests that speak
ers were a good idea to begin
with, it may also remind some
that we are entering an era
when we can no longer indulge
in the expending for trivia of
University dollars (a relatively
small amount) and human
energy (an enormous amount
when a silly or politically un
palatable speaker is selected).
Useless debate
At a time when we are seeking
to assert and fund first
priorities, a debate about the
usefulness or appropriateness
of Woody Allen can at best be
regarded as insensitive.
The disputes of last year
failed to gain the level of debate
and dialogue that could have
made the whole affair educa
tionally useful and relevant and
thus worth the effort. For the
most part we could not rise
above a fairly low level of divi
sive, emotional, and rhetorical
nonsense.
Would it be more fruitful to
ask whether the human and dol
lar resources now expended on
commencement speakers and
arguing about commencement
speakers could be used to im
prove the event? Could such a
move serve to re-create the
separate and more personable
degree ceremonies for the
Humanities and Sciences stu
dents and faculty and to provide
us all with the bonus of 20 fewer
minutes under that hot June sun
in Frost?

The Committee to Select the
Commencement Speaker
should consider the elimination
of a commencement guest
speaker.
Before explaining why, it
would be well to explain two of
my biases in this matter.
First, I like and value the
commencement exercise. It is a
useful ritual; a useful commun
ity exercise that is colorful,
pleasant, and which generates
good feelings within and among

most of the participants.
I know that not all feel that
way, but most who participate
do and the vast majority of those
who could participate in fact do
so. I see the elimination of the
commencement speaker as a
way to strengthen and improve
the event.
'Family' matter
The second bias follows from
the first. I have never liked out
side commencement speakers.
Commencement is a celebration
of events that have occurred
within the several communities
that combine to make a Univer
sity; it is a "family" affair.
A non-Stanford speaker has
little chance of relating success
fully to the University, to the
event or to the individuals who
make up the event.
A Stanford speaker (aside
from the president who cus
tomarily has a few remarks
anyway) is unlikely to be of
great intrest to more than one of
the groups attending com
mencement. And these are times
when the choice of the speaker
ifciikely to offend some.
Speaker irrelevant
My opinions about the irrele
vance of commencement speak
ers were unchanged during my
10 years as a dean at a small
college where there was a cus
tom (and adequate bequest dol
lars to back it up) to invite only
those persons to speak who
could spend one or two weeks
on the campus to interact with
it. The speakers (excepting one
— Robert Coles) were still ir
relevant to the event. As here,

their names were soon forgotten
and their words instantly lost,
indeed if gotten at all.
I mention my bias here only to
suggest that it may be a bias that
is held more generally.
Selecting a speaker was
deeply divisive last year; and
deeply troubling to very many
who were touched by the debate
and the event. I see every indica
tion that these wounds will be
reopened this year — and in
years to come. We may have
reached a point where group as
sertiveness has dulled our
capacity to seek a sensitive con
sensus.
Judgment lost
If the Daily reports are accu
rate, the selection process will
become quite political so as to
avoid the harder and lonelier
task of making good judgments.
Already there are regular calls
for organizers and followers for
a campaign to have a profes
sional comedian on the 1975
commencement platform.
These are efforts of sincere
people with good motives, but
with limited inclination to un
derstand the great diversity in a
commencement or to project
themselves into the mental set of
the many people who will com
bine that day to make com
mencement. The divisiveness is
increasing — not abating.
Method not key
But some would argue that we
should simply change the way
we choose speakers; involve the
parents, spouses, the faculty, the
administration, and graduate
and professional students more
than before.

James Lyons

Aside from the fact that that
argument suggests that speak
ers were a good idea to begin
with, it may also remind some
that we are entering an era
when we can no longer indulge
in the expending for trivia of
University dollars (a relatively
small amount) and human
energy (an enormous amount
when a silly or politically un
palatable speaker is selected).
Useless debate
At a time when we are seeking
to assert and fund first
priorities, a debate about the
usefulness or appropriateness
of Woody Allen can at best be
regarded as insensitive.
The disputes of last year
failed to gain the level of debate
and dialogue that could have
made the whole affair educa
tionally useful and relevant and
thus worth the effort. For the
most part we could not rise
above a fairly low level of divi
sive, emotional, and rhetorical
nonsense.
Would it be more fruitful to
ask whether the human and dol
lar resources now expended on
commencement speakers and
arguing about commencement
speakers could be used to im
prove the event? Could such a
move serve to re-create the
separate and more personable
degree ceremonies for the
Humanities and Sciences stu
dents and faculty and to provide
us all with the bonus of 20 fewer
minutes under that hot June sun
in Frost?
