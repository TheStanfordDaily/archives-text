Evasive response

What did Robert M.
Rosenzweig argue as the reason
for Daniel Moynihan's selection
as commencement speaker last
year? After careful review of his
recent column in the Oct. 10
Daily. as well as Daily cover
age last spring, I still don't
know.
His column is but one more
example of the evasive rhetoric,
irrelevant argument and unsub
tle personal attack that has
characterized administration
pronouncements on the issue
since the beginning.
Did he read President Richard
Lyman's remarks in the pages of
the Daily at the beginning of this
quarter? A clear statement of the
issue — relevant criteria, con
stituencies and other considera
tions — would be most welcome
and is certainly overdue. His
column, unfortunately, is of no
help.

Editor:
The Stanford community has
recently seen the Daily allow
some crude, attention-seeking
filler seep into various columns
under the pretenses of con
troversy and professionalism.
But all previous indiscretions
are overshadowed by the latest,
the "Undercovers" column by
Dave Ansley.
We are appalled by the ques
tions that Ansley has seen fit to
print, such as one item in the
Oct. 10 Daily where a reader in
quired, "Can a man get an erec
tion after he's dead?"
The answer is almost as inane
as its reference next to the
nameplate which reads, "Only
men can love the dead." This
humor does not belong in the
University's premier news
paper. We hope that the editors
of the Daily have the sense to
avoid this type of sen
sationalism in the future.

were looking for off-campus

To the Clearing House staff

'Daily' sensationalist?
Editor:
The Stanford community has
recently seen the Daily allow
some crude, attention-seeking
filler seep into various columns
under the pretenses of con
troversy and professionalism.
But all previous indiscretions
are overshadowed by the latest,
the "Undercovers" column by
Dave Ansley.
We are appalled by the ques
tions that Ansley has seen fit to
print, such as one item in the
Oct. 10 Daily where a reader in
quired, "Can a man get an erec
tion after he's dead?"
The answer is almost as inane
as its reference next to the
nameplate which reads, "Only
men can love the dead." This
humor does not belong in the
University's premier news
paper. We hope that the editors
of the Daily have the sense to
avoid this type of sen
sationalism in the future.

Editor:
A group of students called the
Clearing House staff spent the
last weeks of their summer "va
cation" helping students who
were looking for off-campus
housing.
To the Clearing House staff
and especially to their coor
dinator, David Babbitz: a small,
but sincere, thanks.
