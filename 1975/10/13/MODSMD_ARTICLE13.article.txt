# ASSU Senate candidates announce election platforms

The ASSU Senate is an impor
tant part of this campus that
graduate students have too often
neglected in the past. Many vital
issues to graduate students,
such as stipends, housing,
health needs and parking can be
affected by the Senate.
Your graduate Senate candi
dates need your support so they
can help you. A large vote turn
out by graduate students will
convince the administration
that graduate students are con
cerned about their condition
and it will help the Senate to
work effectively.
Graduade and professional
students, be sure to vote next
Wednesday and Thursday at the
various locations around cam
pus! Thanks.
Thank you.
Marcus C. Wood
As a candidate for the ASSU
Senate, I do not run on prom
ises. I. too am in favor of the lofty
ideals of my fellow candidates.
It is my hope that Serra St. will
be repaved. 1 would like to see
the project to clean up Lake
Lagunita finished. Also, a re
turn to the tuition levels of the
early 1900s would be appealing
to me.
Yet, all that I can realistically
promise is a conscientious effort
on my part to work toward im
proving the Stanford commun
ity.
I am a junior in history and
economics.
John Fyfe
I am John Fyfe, 24. doctoral
student in School of Education,
concentration on University
administration. Attentive to the
concerns of undergraduates in a
complex university. Desirous of
a program to increase com
munication between the
graduate schools and their stu
dents.
Building upon understanding

of how university administra
tion operates and the role of stu
dents in that operation. Past ex
perience as a student body pres
ident at a private college, a year
of administrative work and pre
sent study of University ad
ministration contribute sig
nificantly to my desire for elec
tion
Major role within Senate if
elected: To observe, debate,
converse with fellow graduate
students, understand, and in
fluence policy formulation to
wards the goal of ASSU-
University communication and
cooperation.

Accessible. Unbiased. In

Responsible. Individual. Ex
perienced.
Sweet and simple: At $6000 a
year, how can you afford any
thing less?

Aren't you getting rather tired
of the same old spiels from can
didates who promise "better
communiction." "more student
involvement" and "more rep
resentative government" if they
are elected to the Senate?
Well so are we. Those
platitudes are warmed over
bullshit — which each year be
gets a Senate as dumpy as yes
terday's pudding.
We'd rather talk about some
real issues. Such as:
The Bonfire: We're for it. We
saw 10,000 people in Lake Lag
unite last fall for an event which
brought the community to
gether. We're going to listen to
the 10,000 and not to the old
core of activists whose argu
ments against the Bonfire we've
heard before.
Senate Domination: A slate of
graduate students is attempting
to gain Senate control. We be

lieve graduate representation
should be based on actual en
rollment and limited to 45 per
cent of the Senate, not 50.
A similar attempt at domina
tion is afoot in the under
graduate race, where a slate of
nine candidates formed around
a core of radicals is attempting
to take Stanford in a "new direc
tion." That direction is towards
ideological domination of the
Senate.
Bruce Reznick
There is a sickness in Stan
ford. The administration talks
like it's motivated by pedagogy
but acts like it's running a cor
poration. Where is love of learn
ing when other schools are "our
competitors" — competition
used to excuse cutbacks rather
than to promote innovation?
Graduate students are given
miserly support, if at all, while
we get the coveted $14 million
money. In the only nearby
moderate-priced housing, stu
dents pay for the privilege of
parking at home.
At this self-proclaimed
Harvard-of-the-West. Lyman
says that the seniors can't vote
for commencement speaker be
cause they might be frivolous.
And the only way to get a decent
cheap meal on campus is to
bring it yourself. There must be
a re-examination of purpose;
there is more to a University
than self-perpetuation.
Frank Coari, Dave Sharp,
Chad Huston, Dan
Livingston
The members of the Conserva
tive Slate for ASSU Senate, feel
that students deserve candi
dates who have staunch stands
on specific issues rather than
political rhetoric and
generalities.
Votes may be lost due to can
did expression of our positions,
but we will maintain our per
sonal integrity and challenge

our opponents to do the same.
ASSU budget reform: includ
ing readily available copies of
explicit financial statements
and improved allocation of
ASSU services to benefit the
majority determined by student
referendum, not by a handful of
senators.
All housing units choosing fi
nancial independence of the
university should not be bur
dened with quotas or other Uni
versity intervention.
To limit the Council of Presi
dents' committee appointment
power by giving the Senate au
thority to veto student commit
tees.
To adamantly importune stu
dent participation in student
government with an extensively
improved referendum system.
The minor issues of our plat
form include: reinstatement of
the Stanford "Indian" as the
University's symbol, which was
transformed a few years ago
(against student opinion) to a
vague piece of cloth; assurance
that all ASSU services are
brought to students at cost; ex
pedition of currently pending
boathouse improvements;
longer facilities hours, includ
ing pools, libraries and retail
services.
We suggest that the Conserva
tive Slate is your best choice on
Wednesday and Thursday. Al
though we are endorsed by the
Conservative Student Union, we
are not running as their rep
resentatives.
We believe that it is time for a
constructive change; a time for
an end to the impracticality and
irresponsibility that has charac
terized the ASSU in recent
years.
Therefore, our chief position
is that since the ASSU is the offi
cial representative of the Stan
ford student body, it should only
fund programs that prove bene
ficial to the greatest number of
its constituents. We would put
an end to the funding of special
interest and pressure groups.

Contrary to what some may
tell you, or to what you may al
ready believe, we are not stiff
collared rednecks who hold
meetings under the full moon
wearing white sheets and
pointed hats. Neither are we
wild-eyed radicals out to reform
the world with pickets and de
monstrations.
Conservatives here are people
like you, people with some seri
ous disenchantments with the
Senate and who would like to
see the kind of reform outlined
above.
Bill Larkins
Like everybody else running
for ASSU Senate, I am a respon
sible, dedicated, concerned in
dividual with years of experi
ence in high school government.
Unlike my opponents, who have
resorted to smear tactics in at
tempts to erode my lead in the
polls, I don't skirt the real is
sues.
I am opposed to more on
campus housing. I seek the abol
ition of the SWOPSI and SCIRE
programs. William Shockley
should be this year's com
mencement speaker. I accept
contributions from oil com
panies, milk interests and pub
lic utilities. I support all prop
osed tuition hikes.
Jack Christiansen's contract
should be renewed for 10 years.
The Sunday Flicks should cost
$2. Patty Hearst should be freed.
I advocate the reinstatement of
the letter grade "F". I am wait
ing for Dutch elm disease and
syphilis to depopulate the entire
campus.
For new life in your appen
dage, the ASSU . . . voteT.Bear.
Wallace Judd
The parking issue has been
resolved from the point of view
of administrative convenience.
Another solution could easily
emerge from the point of view of

the students — the people the
University is designed to serve.
As with parking, so with
many other issues.
Students' evaluations should
constitute a part of a course de
scription. Student assessment of
teaching should contribute to
hiring decisions. I would like to
see the research elitist lock on
policy decisions broken.
Tim Conway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate because I want to and
will do a good job. I was in the
Senate last year and feel I did a
good job then. My experience
will enable me to move in and
get started. People who know

me realize that I am not timid
about expressing my opinion on
any subject, popular or not.
The Senate does have power
in money regulation and as the
student voice. These elections
should be important enough to
vote on Wednesday or Thurs
day.
Thank you.

Deric Jennings
I am a second-year doctoral,
candidate in economics, ij
served on the Graduate Student -
Council (GSC) last year, and on«
the Financial Aid Committee '
which worked on the GSC, and *
have recently been elected pres
ident of the Graduate Student
Association in the Economics
Department.
I am interested in a closer
liaison between the ASSU and
the GSC than has existed hereto
fore, with the hope of increasing
student input into University
policy decisions, particularly
with respect to stipend and
RA/TA levels, and the overall
quality of graduate education
here.

In the past, the ASSU has re
ceived minutes of University
and Academic Senate commit
tee meetings. This flow of in
formation is essential to student
awareness of University high
level policy decisions.
During the 1974-75 academic
year, the secretary to the
Academic Senate stopped send
ing the minutes of many key
committees such as the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid (C
--UAFA).
Student activism created stu
dent positions on University
committees. The ASSU must in
sure the availability of policy re
lated information to all stu
dents.
We oppose arbitrary cutbacks
in any student activities solely
to "trim the university budget"
such as reductions in counsel
ing and financial support to
student organizations.
Where cuts must be made,
input from the groups con
cerned and students in general
is essential along with a careful
assessment of long term effects
on the University.
We support the senior class
officers in their effort to poll the
senior class so as to promote a
more commencement speakers.

The special needs of trans
fers, off campus, and even
graduate students have been ig
nored until very recently. The
new services to off campus stu
dents (lounge, lockets) should
be viewed as only the beginning
and innovative programs in
transfer orientation need ex
pansion.
Brad Jones
Before I graduate this June, I
want to put some of my experi
ence to use by improving the
services of student groups and
residences. To increase public
ity, a list describing the various
organizations on campus
should be distributed to each
student on Registration Day
every Quarter.
As for residences, monthly
meetings for all resident assis
tants would not only enable
these people to discover which
events attract the greatest par
ticipation, but could also lead to
more interaction among the
housing system (e.g. combined
parties, meal exchanges).
Also, 1 advocate restoring the
boathouse so that students may
enjoy the spring weather at Lake
Lagunita in safety.
I have more ideas, and I'm
open to yours. The Senate needs
to receive student input
throughout the year. We need to
get together.
Steven Westly
I am Steven Westly. I am dis
gusted. All around me I see dis
gusting perversion. Perversion
that was never intended when
the benevolent Leland Stanford
founded this great university.
Every day some new degenerate
mauls the honor of this school.
Once there was a time when
you and I might have been
proud to stand up in a crowd
and say "I am a Stanford stu
dent," but no longer. This need
not be so. Things can and must

change. And I am the one who
will do it. But I need your help.
I am running for the student
senate. My name on the ballot
stands for decency. The forces of
filth fear a victory on my part,
but with your vote I will win. I
must win.
Gregg Densmore
There are a number of reasons
why I think 1 could do a good job
on the ASSU Senate. I'm a fair
and just person because I am,
very open-minded.
How can you expect fairness
from a senator who is already
partial and only interested in
his own projects? After having
formed an opinion I have al
ways spoken vociferiously on its
behalf. Finally, if I'm elected I
will truly work hard to repre
sent the students of this school
I would like to urge the stu

dent body to please go out and
vote. I am an undergraduate in
biology.
Gary E. Beckstead
In response to the graduate
students of Escondido Village,
the constituency which has
nominated me, I Gary E.
Beckstead, advocate and, if
elected, will support in the
ASSU Senate the following is
sues:
—Eliminations of parking
fees for residents of Escondido
Village;
—Establishment of health
services at Covvell Health Center
for spouses of registered stu
dents;
—Improvement of child care
facilities in Escondido Village;
—Improvement in schedules
and equipment in DeGuerre
pool for Escondido residents;
Traffic control on Campus

Drive at Serra Street and Escon
dido Road intersections during
morning and evening rush
hours;
—Repair of Serra Street for
bicycle travel;
Creation of polling place in
Escondido Village Center;
Revision of election rules and
timing for greater graduate stu
dent participation.
Tom Fitzgerald
There are a number of issues
that are of concern to the Stan

ford community. Some of these
issues, e.g. on-campus housing,
commencement speaker, and
the SWOPSI/SCIRE programs
are of major interest to a large
number of people. Other issues,
e.g. the reinstallation of ASSU
courtesy phones in UGLY are of
relatively minor concern. How
ever, in both cases, the ASSU
Senate, as student representa
tives, should actively pursue
solutions to these problems that
will satisfy students' needs.
I am running for under
graduate Senator because I feel

my background (in student or
ganizations, ASSU government,
and dealings with the Univer
sity administration) will enable
me to effectively represent un
dergraduates in the dealings
with these and other problems
of concern to us all.
1 will appreciate any support
given my candidacy during the
election and, if elected, during
the coming year.
Charlotte Christman,
Andy Goldenkranz,
Tom McCormack, Ruben
Sanchez,
Shea Dixon,
Mark Haddad
Andrew Nussbaum
We have combined together
solely for the purpose of diverse,
accessible student representa
tion. By living in different areas
of the University, we will be
more available and more ex
posed to the wide variety of stu
dent opinion. Though we are
one slate, we each have unique
interests.
Student services: Christman
wants another Big Game bon
fire; Dixon's alternative is a dis
cotheque dance. Haddad and
McCormack favor quality con
certs, not Helen Roddy flops, as
well as a late night food delivery
service.
Academic: Nussbaum anil
Sanchez would like to protect
SWOPSI, SCIRE and minority
interests against unreasonable
budget cuts. Goldenkranz
wishes to improve the effective
ness of the Learning Assistance
Center.
While differing in other
priorities, we all agree that
communicating through per
sonal accessibility is essential to
any representative student gov
ernment. Consider the alterna
tives.
