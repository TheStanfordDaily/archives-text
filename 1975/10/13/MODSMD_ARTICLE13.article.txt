# ASSU Senate candidates announce election platforms

The ASSU Senate is an impor
tant part of this campus that
graduate students have too often
neglected in the past. Many vital
issues to graduate students,
such as stipends, housing,
health needs and parking can be
affected by the Senate.
Your graduate Senate candi
dates need your support so they
can help you. A large vote turn
out by graduate students will
convince the administration
that graduate students are con
cerned about their condition
and it will help the Senate to
work effectively.
Graduade and professional
students, be sure to vote next
Wednesday and Thursday at the
various locations around cam
pus! Thanks.
Thank you.
Marcus C. Wood
As a candidate for the ASSU
Senate, I do not run on prom
ises. I. too am in favor of the lofty
ideals of my fellow candidates.
It is my hope that Serra St. will
be repaved. 1 would like to see
the project to clean up Lake
Lagunita finished. Also, a re
turn to the tuition levels of the
early 1900s would be appealing
to me.
Yet, all that I can realistically
promise is a conscientious effort
on my part to work toward im
proving the Stanford commun
ity.
I am a junior in history and
economics.
John Fyfe
I am John Fyfe, 24. doctoral
student in School of Education,
concentration on University
administration. Attentive to the
concerns of undergraduates in a
complex university. Desirous of
a program to increase com
munication between the
graduate schools and their stu
dents.
Building upon understanding

of how university administra
tion operates and the role of stu
dents in that operation. Past ex
perience as a student body pres
ident at a private college, a year
of administrative work and pre
sent study of University ad
ministration contribute sig
nificantly to my desire for elec
tion
Major role within Senate if
elected: To observe, debate,
converse with fellow graduate
students, understand, and in
fluence policy formulation to
wards the goal of ASSU-
University communication and
cooperation.

Accessible. Unbiased. In
novative.
Responsible. Individual. Ex
perienced.
Sweet and simple: At $6000 a
year, how can you afford any
thing less?
Wilbur Hall: 327-3224.

Aren't you getting rather tired
of the same old spiels from can
didates who promise "better
communiction." "more student
involvement" and "more rep
resentative government" if they
are elected to the Senate?
Well so are we. Those
platitudes are warmed over
bullshit — which each year be
gets a Senate as dumpy as yes
terday's pudding.
We'd rather talk about some
real issues. Such as:
The Bonfire: We're for it. We
saw 10,000 people in Lake Lag
unite last fall for an event which
brought the community to
gether. We're going to listen to
the 10,000 and not to the old
core of activists whose argu
ments against the Bonfire we've
heard before.
Senate Domination: A slate of
graduate students is attempting
to gain Senate control. We be

lieve graduate representation
should be based on actual en
rollment and limited to 45 per
cent of the Senate, not 50.
A similar attempt at domina
tion is afoot in the under
graduate race, where a slate of
nine candidates formed around
a core of radicals is attempting
to take Stanford in a "new direc
tion." That direction is towards
ideological domination of the
Senate.
Bruce Reznick
There is a sickness in Stan
ford. The administration talks
like it's motivated by pedagogy
but acts like it's running a cor
poration. Where is love of learn
ing when other schools are "our
competitors" — competition
used to excuse cutbacks rather
than to promote innovation?
Graduate students are given
miserly support, if at all, while
we get the coveted $14 million
money. In the only nearby
moderate-priced housing, stu
dents pay for the privilege of
parking at home.
At this self-proclaimed
Harvard-of-the-West. Lyman
says that the seniors can't vote
for commencement speaker be
cause they might be frivolous.
And the only way to get a decent
cheap meal on campus is to
bring it yourself. There must be
a re-examination of purpose;
there is more to a University
than self-perpetuation.
Frank Coari, Dave Sharp,
Chad Huston, Dan

The members of the Conserva
tive Slate for ASSU Senate, feel
that students deserve candi
dates who have staunch stands
on specific issues rather than
political rhetoric and
generalities.
Votes may be lost due to can
did expression of our positions,
but we will maintain our per
sonal integrity and challenge

our opponents to do the same.
ASSU budget reform: includ
ing readily available copies of
explicit financial statements
and improved allocation of
ASSU services to benefit the
majority determined by student
referendum, not by a handful of
senators.
All housing units choosing fi
nancial independence of the
university should not be bur
dened with quotas or other Uni
versity intervention.
To limit the Council of Presi
dents' committee appointment
power by giving the Senate au
thority to veto student commit
tees.
To adamantly importune stu
dent participation in student
government with an extensively
improved referendum system.
The minor issues of our plat
form include: reinstatement of
the Stanford "Indian" as the
University's symbol, which was
transformed a few years ago
(against student opinion) to a
vague piece of cloth; assurance
that all ASSU services are
brought to students at cost; ex
pedition of currently pending
boathouse improvements;
longer facilities hours, includ
ing pools, libraries and retail
services.
We suggest that the Conserva
tive Slate is your best choice on
Wednesday and Thursday. Al
though we are endorsed by the
Conservative Student Union, we
are not running as their rep
resentatives.
We believe that it is time for a
constructive change; a time for
an end to the impracticality and
irresponsibility that has charac
terized the ASSU in recent
years.
Therefore, our chief position
is that since the ASSU is the offi
cial representative of the Stan
ford student body, it should only
fund programs that prove bene
ficial to the greatest number of
its constituents. We would put
an end to the funding of special
interest and pressure groups.

Contrary to what some may
tell you, or to what you may al
ready believe, we are not stiff
collared rednecks who hold
meetings under the full moon
wearing white sheets and
pointed hats. Neither are we
wild-eyed radicals out to reform
the world with pickets and de
monstrations.
Conservatives here are people
like you, people with some seri
ous disenchantments with the
Senate and who would like to
see the kind of reform outlined
above.
Bill Larkins
Like everybody else running
for ASSU Senate, I am a respon
sible, dedicated, concerned in
dividual with years of experi
ence in high school government.
Unlike my opponents, who have
resorted to smear tactics in at
tempts to erode my lead in the
polls, I don't skirt the real is
sues.
I am opposed to more on
campus housing. I seek the abol
ition of the SWOPSI and SCIRE
programs. William Shockley
should be this year's com
mencement speaker. I accept
contributions from oil com
panies, milk interests and pub
lic utilities. I support all prop
osed tuition hikes.
Jack Christiansen's contract
should be renewed for 10 years.
The Sunday Flicks should cost
$2. Patty Hearst should be freed.
I advocate the reinstatement of
the letter grade "F". I am wait
ing for Dutch elm disease and
syphilis to depopulate the entire
campus.
For new life in your appen
dage, the ASSU . . . voteT.Bear.
Wallace Judd
The parking issue has been
resolved from the point of view
of administrative convenience.
Another solution could easily
emerge from the point of view of

the students — the people the
University is designed to serve.
As with parking, so with
many other issues.
Students' evaluations should
constitute a part of a course de
scription. Student assessment of
teaching should contribute to
hiring decisions. I would like to
see the research elitist lock on
policy decisions broken.
Tim Conway
I am running for the ASSU
Senate because I want to and
will do a good job. I was in the
Senate last year and feel I did a
good job then. My experience
will enable me to move in and
get started. People who know

me realize that I am not timid
about expressing my opinion on
any subject, popular or not.
The Senate does have power
in money regulation and as the
student voice. These elections
should be important enough to
vote on Wednesday or Thurs
day.
Thank you.
