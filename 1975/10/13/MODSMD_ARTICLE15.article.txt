## Jimmy Carter: peanuts to White House 
### MARK FUNK 
Jimmy Carter seems to be gaining some con
verts in his quest for the presidency. It is still a
long way to New York City and the 1976
Democratic National Convention, but the
former Georgia governor — who started out
the year with a name recognition factor
somewhere below 5 percent — has received
some interesting endorsements.
Like Hunter Thompson's.
Thompson, a distinctly left-wing, spacey
political writer for Rolling Stone magazine, is
noted chiefly for his offbeat coverage of
George McGovern's abortive 1972 presiden
tial campaign and as the character on which
Gary Trudeau (creator of "Doonesbury")
modeled Uncle Duke.
Thompson says of Carter, "I like him. I don't
exactly know why yet. I just have a good feel
ing about him."
So apparently, does Max Palevsky.
Palevsky is to the liberal wing of the Democra
tic party what Adolph Coors could be to
Ronald Reagan — a gravy train. Ready at the
drop of an issue to open his pursestrings to
leftwing leaning candidates, Palevsky and
some of his well-to-do friends got together and
threw a little fundraiser for Carter in Los
Angeles last month. In one night. Carter at
least doubled the $12,000 he had collected in
California since throwing his hat into the ring
in early January.
Peanut farmer
Not bad for a Southern peanut farmer come
physicist come businessman, who does not
lean all that far left.
Carter was here Friday after
noon. His message was much the same as it
had been during the summer. He mixes
moralisms ("I would'never tell a lie. I would
never tell a misleading statement. Watch me
closely. If you ever hear me doing any of these
things, then I don't deserve to be President.")
with a technical knowledge gained during his
days as a nuclear physicist.
He dwelled on his record during his talk. It's
an impressive one. Georgia has had more than
its share of forgettable governors — the Tal
madges (Eugene and Herman) both strict seg
regationists, Lester Maddox and a few non
entities propped up by theTalmadge machine.
Undertaking a massive reorganization of
the Georgia state government, Carter called in
teams of business and governmental

specialists to mold a sounder fiscal structure.
He told students he cut the state's
bureaucracy from over 300 separate agencies
to a more manageable and economical 22.
And he promised to do the same thing in
Washington. Only this time he will have 1900
agencies — "that we know of" — to pare
down.
'Zero budgeting'
Carter also instituted an accounting system
known as "zero budgeting." Instead of justify
ing budget increases, Georgia's agencies must
annually re-evaluate their budgets. This saves
money. Carter, who was able to serve out his
term as governor without an increase in taxes,
ended his administration with a $10 million
surplus in the state treasury.
There are, however, a number of drawbacks
to his candidacy. Carter is relatively inexperi
enced. Aside from his stint in the governor's
mansion, he has only held two elective offices.
He served on the Plains, Ga., school board and
in the Georgia state legislature.
He has little experience in international
politics and this could hurt his candidacy. It is
still uncertain how he will fare in a head-to
head showdown with Alabama Governor
George Wallace.
In Washington last August, Carter outlined
the campaign strategy he hoped to use while
building his organization for the New Hamp
shire and Florida primaries.
U.S. microcosm
Carter, who has always been popular with
Georgia's working class, called Florida "a Un
ited States in microcosm," and said that the
same coalition that sent him to the governor's
mansion in Georgia — a coalition of workers
and rural farmers ("thelittlepeople") — could
be mobilized in Florida.
"The northern part of Florida is a rural
area," Carter said. "It is strong Wallace coun
try, but I think I am gaining there." He puts his
biggest hopes on the industrial southern part
of the state, however.
"The south, particularly around Miami,\is
sophisticated and not necessarily receptive to
the Wallace line," Carter noted. Straw polls in

the area show Carter is making some headway
in the Miami area.
A number of people have suggested that
other candidates stay out of Florida so Carter
alone can challenge Wallace. Rep. Morris
Udall (D-Ariz.) said he would. "If Carter
wants to take him (Wallace) on in Florida,
that's fine. I want to give him every opportun
ity. 1 do not plan at this time to run a serious
campaign in Florida."
Dispel regional image
Carter said, however, that it was equally
important to show well in the North and dis
pell his image as a regional candidate.
Monitarily, at least, Carter has qualified for
federal matching funds after collecting $5000

in 21 or more states. The additional revenues
that the matching monies will bring in are
welcomed by the Carter campaign. It is esti
mated that Carter is spending over $2000 a
day to finance his staff. He attributes part of
his early success to the new federal laws.
Carter should have a healthy campaign
chest built up for the New Hampshire and
Florida primaries. He has visited New Hamp
shire 15 times in the past year and will come to
Florida at least as many. People in the Udall
and Jackson campaigns have labeled Carter as
the candidate most likely to win in New
Hampshire — if they don't.
"1 am flattered," Carter said. "We are
slowly picking up some support for our cam
paign up there."
However, a recent poll shows Carter with
less than four percent of the popular vote at
this time.
Energetic
Carter is an energetic individual. His visit
here marked the eighth time he has visited
California since January. He will, by his own
estimate, devote 250 days to the campaign this
year. He spent one of those days, Aug. 2, in
Norfolk, Va.
It was a hot, muggy day in the Tidewater
area. Carter was on hand for a lawn party
thrown by Virginia's former lieutenant gover
nor, Henry Howell. Howell ran for governor in
1972 and came within a whisker of taking the
election. He might have won had his opponent
not claimed that Howell was in favor of integ
rating the predominantly white schools of
the northern Virginia suburbs with the over
whelmingly black Washington, D.C. school
system.
Howell was a little piqued that day. Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat who is also
running for president, had made a swing
through Virginia just a week earlier and
picked up the endorsements of a number of
influential Howell supporters, including the
state's attorney general and the Democratic
state chairman, Joe Fitzpatrick. "1 nurtured a
number of those boys for years," Howell said.
"And now Bentsen — who came in throwing

his money around — has got them.
Carter went immediately to a press confer
ence at the Howell residence upon his arrival,
two hours late due to jet failure. He also made
his one serious mistake of the day. Stating that
the state Democratic chairman should main
tain at least the facade of neutrality in in
traparty politics, Carter took Fitzpatrick to
task for his endorsement of Bentsen. Fitzpat
rick, who was also at the press conference,
literally shook with rage.
"1 didn't come to Henry Howell's to be em
barrassed," Fitzpatrick stated, and not at all
calmly. "If somebody asked me, I'll go down to
Georgia and campaign against him. When he
gets to the convention and looks at the Vir
ginia delegate total and sees zero for Carter,
he'll remember the name of Fitzpatrick."
Carter made out better with the 300 or so
people who gathered on Howell's lawn to sip
iced tea, eat watermelon and politick. It was a
true old-fashioned political gathering. Carter
moved easily through the crowd, stopping
frequently to chat with small knots of people.
They seemed pleased with his grasp of domes
tic issues and his friendship with Henry How
ell.
Gentleman's code
His manner, a product of a strict Southern
Baptist upbringing and three years at the U.S.
Naval Academy, impressed those he met. The
gentleman's code still runs deep through Vir
ginia's middle class. Carter personified it.
Speaking from a podium festooned with the
Georgia state flag and the stars and stripes,
Carter dwelled on morality in government
and his record as governor. Only Joe Fitzpat
rick wasn't paying attention.
After Norfolk, Carter drove to nearby
Yorktown where he and Howell attended a
picnic sponsored by the Yorktown Democratic
Club and attended by Howell's faithful.
Yorktown is steeped in tradition. So are its
people. They talk about the surrender of
Cornwallis there as if the revolutionary war
had ended yesterday.
Carter played with the children and spoke
with people as they stood in line for dinner.
After he spoke, local party leaders gave him a
prized Smithfield ham. Most of them had
never been that close to a presidential candi
date before. Carter hopes that that intimacy
will breed support.
