# Report finds job sharing more productive, flexible
## 
### ANN POLLOCK 
"Job sharing" increased the
numbers of the employed,
broadened the diversity of
employe backgrounds,
heightened productivity and
added more flexibility in hours,
an ARLO (Action Research
Liaison Office) study has con
cluded.
In a report on job sharing —
the division of one full-time job
between two people — in the
Palo Alto city government,
ARLO found that the higher
productivity was credited to in
creases in energy, enthusiasm
and concentration, resulting
from shorter working hours.
The study also found job shar
ing to be "A viable way of struc
turing work to better accommo
date working women."
As one city employe said, "It's
better to have two heads in a
position than one."
Student participants
Four political science stu
dents, Cheryl Stewart, Jeanne
Kennedy, Christine Sierra and
Charles Gossett participated in
the program after enrolling in
political science Prof. David
Abernathy's class.
Abernathy chose the study of
job sharing from several prog
rams dealing with the city of
Palo Alto offered by ARLO as
the one most complementary to
the class's scheduled studies.
Requiring much more coop
eration between workers than is
usually demanded, the job shar
ing program was begun by Palo
Alto with help from the New
Ways to Work, a non-profit voc
ational resource center.
Stewart said that job sharing
works best in jobs that naturally
divide into separate functions.
F'or example, "Librarians set
aside their own separate tasks
while dividing the job at the
desk between them. One person
took charge of orders and the
other in getting science books,"
she said.
'Breadwinner stereotype'
Most men won't consider the
job sharing program because,
"the breadwinner stereotype is
still pretty darn strong,"

Stewart said.
But for herself, she noted, "A
40 hour week, or the 50 or 60
hour week that many profes
sionals put in, is just impossible
if you wantto maintain any kind
of home life."
Sierra pointed out how stu
dents might benefit from job
sharing.
"I would be interested in job
sharing if I was still going to
school and needed extra money.
I could participate in job shar
ing, which would be better than
a casual part-time job because I
could start accumulating hours
for my chosen profession if I got
a fairly good job in the field I'm
going into," she said.
Although the
study found job sharers to be
"overwhelmingly positive with
regard to the effects job sharing
has upon both their work and
their home life," one definite
disadvantage of a shortened
work week was the resulting cut
in pay.
But, according to one worker,
"The money doesn't do you any
good if you're killing yourself by
working too much."
Job sharers mentioned pursu
ing personal interests, raising a
family and going to school as
ways of filling their new free
time.
"Communication was antici
pated as a problem, but the co
workers didn't mention it as a

drawback," Sierra said.
"Some sharers feel that they
don't have enough input into the
decision making process of the
office," Stewart said.
Missing out
Other communication prob
lems were missing out on in
traoffice communication,
employe gossip and personal re
lationships.
Increased costs from job shar
ing are due to increased time
spent on communications,
supervision and administra
tion, and, Stewart said, "The
benefits aren't usually quanta
tive as the additional costs."
"But you can't consider the
additional time wasted," she
argued.
"It clarifies a situation to have
to account for your hours at a
job, and to write down com
munications. It systemizes
things and takes away the un
predictability and forgetful
ness."
In assessing the future of job
sharing, Stewart observed that,
"Many cities won't take a leap
and may just decide not to im
plement job sharing because
they're not willing to incur a lit
tle additional expense." Sierra
commented, "We're in a reces
sion and people are afraid of los
ing their full time jobs, so they
perceive of job sharing as a
threat."
