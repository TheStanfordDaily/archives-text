# Program offers chance to learn via work experience overseas

For those who want to go ab
road without going tourist, the
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) prog
ram offers the opportunity for
near-total immersion in a
foreign culture.
Being stranded in a different
culture with a different lan
guage can be difficult, VIA re
turnees report. No matter how
well-prepared volunteers are
before going, they still are often
jolted by the different cultural
atmospheres they encounter.
Reported one volunteer in a
letter from Indonesia, "The first
few week's was a period of com
plete culture shock because I
did not enter the type of Asia
that Dwight (Clark, executive
director of VIA) talked about."
Said anotherVlA participant,
"Odd being an odd being. (Even)
if a Chinese were on the street
with a foot growing out of his
head and a very traditional
beard growing from each eyeb
row, I would only have to stand
still to get all the stares."
Trans-cultural immersion
However, VIA returnees
agree that this complete trans
cultural immersion is an in

valuable part of their experi
ences abroad.
"I met Indonesian culture on
that culture's terms. That led to
frustrations; it led to incredible
friendships. I may not be able to
do that again," said Tom
Graham, a recent returnee.
Although VIA is Stanford
based, it makes no academic re
quirements.
Explained Ken Darrow, a re
cent volunteer, "You make your
own experience. There are no
requirements; there's no
bureaucracy watching over you.
We're hoping people will take
Asians on their own terms by
working or living with them, not
by coming in as a tourist."
According to Howdy Bouis, a
volunteer who so enjoyed his
stay in Asia that he hopes to
move there permanently, "It
was a better education than my
undergraduate education. The
VIA program was so much bet
ter than the Stanford overseas
program in Germany that they
just didn't compare."
Unique reflections
Many VIA students found
that, in addition to other forms
of education, their stays in Asia

provided them with unique re
flections upon Western culture.
Said Graham, "1 was in In
donesia during the Watergate
affair and the people there
couldn't believe what was hap
pening â€” that one of the most
powerful countries in the world
was acting out principles of
democracy.
"Theysaid, 'Wow! That's in
credible. If that had happened
in our country, (former White
House counsel John) Dean
would have disappeared, never
to be heard from again.' They

really respect us in this way."
Most undergraduate volun
teers spend from six months to a
year in Asia, teaching advanced
conversational English in local
schools or YMCA's. Graduate
students also teach English, but
because they go for two-year
stints, also have the option of
working on village level pro
jects in areas such as agriculture
or the environment.
Presently, 32 undergraduates
and graduates are working at
varied posts in such countries as
Taiwan, Japan, and Indonesia.
