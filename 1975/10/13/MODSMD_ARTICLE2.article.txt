# Under limited conditions
## CIA monitoring? 
### JOHN FREED 
Effective monitoring of secret U.S.
intelligence agencies could occur only
under limited conditions, former na
tional security aide Mort Halperin
said Friday.
Halperin and Daniel Ellsberg (who
released the "Pentagon Papers") ad
dressed some 480 persons as the
leadoff speakers in a Counterspy Con
vention sponsored last weekend Ber
keley radio station KPFA.
Halperin has served as an assistant
to the National Security Council and
as deputy secretary of defense in Lyn
don Johnson's administration. He ac
cused the CIA of violating its charter.
"They ignored the charter," Halpe
rin said. "When the CIA began open
ing mail, they lied to the Post Office,
they lied to the FBI, but they sent
memos to each other admitting they
knew it was illegal."
Illegal operations
Both the CIA and FBI have tried to
convince the public that illegal opera
tions ceased long ago, he noted.
"What the intelligence organiza
tions now say is 'We've taken care of
all that,' " Halperin said.
Intelligence records on private citi
zens are so extensive, Ellsberg
claimed, that a police state could
come about if a President thought it
necessary.
"All that remains for this country to
become a police state," Ellsberg said,
"is for a President to fl ip the switch —
act on those computer files, pick the
people up."
Because the agencies apparently lie
frequently, a congressional oversight
committee would be usless, according
to Halperin, who now works for the
Center for Natural Securities Studies.
He termed such committees "use
less," saying they "just become a

cover behind which a secret agency
can hide."
Three rules
He proposed three rules which he
said would give citizens a chance to
monitor intelligence agencies:
—no secret agencies;
—no secret charters; and
—no secret budgets.
To implement these proposals, he
suggested having a permanent special
prosecutor in investigate potential
violations of agency charters.
Adherence to these rules, Halperin
claimed, would have revealed the
existence of the National Reconnais
sance Organization, which allegedly
processes intellegence gathered by
satellite.

Three rules
He proposed three rules which he
said would give citizens a chance to
monitor intelligence agencies:
—no secret agencies;
—no secret charters; and
—no secret budgets.
To implement these proposals, he
suggested having a permanent special
prosecutor in investigate potential
violations of agency charters.
Adherence to these rules, Halperin
claimed, would have revealed the
existence of the National Reconnais
sance Organization, which allegedly
processes intellegence gathered by
satellite.
