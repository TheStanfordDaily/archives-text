## Why one boos 
### Tim Ferguson 
Saturday, after his team sustained
another shellacking, Jack Christiansen
turned his ire on the student rooting section.
The stands earlier had been the source of
several serenades of boos which rained on
the playing field.
"It's an amazing thing to happen at a
university like this that students can't be
behind the team at all times," said the
coach. "It must be demoralizing for the
players to feel the student body isn't behind
them."
Actually, it's not so amazing at a school
where intolerance for imperfection is so
widespread a trait. But I would challenge
Christiansen's implication that Saturday's
expressions of discontent were directed sol
ely at his players. In some cases, they in
stead were aimed at him.
Judging from locker room quotes, Christ
iansen's players are near unanimous in
their defense of the coach. And they were
plenty pissed off at the boos, no matter who
the intended victim. Responding to the fans'
complaints, one player went so far as to say,
"If they don't like the way we're playing,

they can get the hell out."
Well, it seems to me that if one pays to see
a football game, he's entitled to say pretty
much what he damn well pleases. Now
perhaps a refusal by the dissatisfied to at
tend games might be a more constructive
form of protest. But then again, the resultant
decline in athletic revenues
would be self-defeating. After all, it's be
cause the fans pay that the show goes on.
I'd say the old "heat in the kitchen" axiom
applies pretty well here, particularly to
Christiansen, who's often shown a reluc
tance to put up with press badgerings after a
bad afternoon.
I'm just an armchair quarterback, not
versed in the scientific knowledge of foot
ball thatChristiansen probably has, but I see
some legitimate gripes among the bitching
and booing.
Number one is the quarterback situation,
an issue that is hardly posse. It's regrettable
to see a college football player like Mike
Cordova bear the burden of boos believed to
be aimed at his performance â€” so great a
burden that he says he'd rather play on the

road. But if, indeed, the boos really translate
into a protest of Christiansen putting Cor
dova in the game in the first place, I'd main
tain they're a good deal more legitimate.
And though, admittedly, play-calling is a
pretty helpless target for second-guessing,
it's an unavoidable one. Christiansen
should face up to this and admit that he may
have called some bad plays and always will,
instead of trying to dodge responsibility for
calls like the three pass plays at the end of
the first half Saturday, as he did with repor
ters after the game.
Finally, disgruntled fans are not out of
bounds in booing the powers who granted
Christiansen a five-year contract after the
1973 season. Some people think Chris is a
good coach, some don't. The fact that fans
buy their way into the stadium is in some
respects a measure of support for the coach
ing regime; those who wish to temper this
support have few avenues of expression
outside of the boo.
Players and coaches alike should recon
cile themselves to the current Stanford
temperament, right or wrong.
