# JV footballers win mud bowl

### JIM MOLLER 
Stanford's Junior Varsity
football team overcame numer
ous mistakes and a sloppy field
on its way to a 20-6 win over
Sacramento State in its first
game of the season. Everybody
had an opportunity to play in
the game which saw the Cards
pile up over 400 yards total of
fense. Meanwhile, the defense
held Sacramento to under 70
yards rushing.
The key figure in the Stanford
offense was running back Billie
Anderson, who gained 93 yards
on nine carries and scored two
touchdowns. In addition. An
derson had a 70 yard
touchdown run called back due
to a clipping penalty.
For the game, Stanford had
over 100-yards in penalties as
sessed against them. Anderson
was also the leading receiver for
Stanford, hauling in four passes
for 70 yards. Phil Francis was
the second leading ground
gainer with 41 yards on 10 car
ries.
All three Stanford quarter
backs managed to complete at
least one pass each. Starting
quarterback Turk Schonert
threw for 169 yards and two
touchdowns. Schonert called a
number of audibles at the line of
scrimmage in response to the
unexpected use of a split six de
fensive alignment by Sac
ramento.
Other quarterbacks
Corky Davis was the quarter
back on the Card's final 84-yard
drive which was capped by An

derson's 19 yard touchdown
run. The third JV quarterback,
Joe Rominger, completed the
only pass he attempted.
Overall, Single was pleased
with the Card's offensive play,
commenting that it "looked very
good at times." The Cards fum
bled seven times, losing the ball
on four of those fumbles. Single
said he is hopeful that the of
fense has all of its mistakes out
of the way now.
One of those fumbles was re
covered by Sacramento on the
Stanford 14-yard line. Sac
ramento scored a few plays later
on a three yard run. Otherwise,
theCardinal defense was in con
trol throughout the game. Be
sides holding Sacramento to
under 70 yards rushing, the
Cards intercepted two passes
and generally left the Stanford
offense in good field position.
After viewing the game films,
Single felt that "the defense
played really well for the first
time out."
Broken leg
The only dim aspect of the
game was the loss of starting
linebacker Connie Wool ridge,
who broke his leg.
Single seemed satisfied with
histeam's performance. He said
that some of the offensive mis
takes could be accounted for by
the fact that the team had only
five days of practice before the
game. Stanford will not be able
to make as many mistakes this
week against an always strong
Cal-Poly team and still hope to
win, said Single.
