# Pac-8 roundup
## Bell goes over 200 
### CHRIS BAKER 
If someone had told USC tail
back Kickv Bell that he would
have gained 940 yards after just
five games this season, he would
have said they were "lyin'."
The only people lyin' after the
Trojans' 28-10 win over
Washington State were the
Cougar defenders left on the
Coliseum turf after trying to
tackle Bell.
The junior tailback went over,
around and through the porous
Cougar defense for 217 yards on
38 carries. It was Bell's third
200-yard rushing game this sea
son. He scored one touchdown
on a 3-yard run in the fourth
quarter and had a 36-yard
touchdown called back, but the
Trojans didn't really need it
against the hapless Cougars.
After the game the only ques
tion was how good are the Tro
jans at midseason. USC has
played opponents with a com
bined record of 1-15. Trojan
Coach John McKay said it was
"impossible " to say exactly
how good his team is right now.
Duck soup
Up in Eugene, Ore., California
Coach Mike White knows how
good his Bears are. Tailback
Chuck Muncie ran for 207 yards
and three touchdowns to lead
Cal to a 34-7 win over winless

Oregon.
Muncie racked up his first
200-yard game, as the Bears
won their third straight contest
and second conference game. It
was the Ducks' 13th straight
loss. Muncie scored on runs of
five, one and six yards as Cal
turned a 10-7 first half lead into
a romp.
The James Gang will be wait
ing for Stanford next week. It
had better wait for someone,
after a 52-0 loss to Alabama. The
Dogs did nothing right in the
first three minutes as the Crim
son Tide rolled to a 21 point
lead.
Fast start
Willie Shelby tore loose for an
84-yard punt return after
Alabama held Washington on
its first series. The Tide got the
ball at the 31 on its next series
and fullback lohnny Davis tore
loose for a touchdown on the
second play of the series. From
then on it was a question of how
many times Bear Bryant's squad
would score.
Fumbles by Washington's
massive fullback Robin Earl set
up the Tide's next two scores, as
the Huskies came away losers.
Alabama rolled up 404 yards on
the ground against Washington.
Maybe the Stanford running
came will dn ns well next week

in Seattle.
Oregon State lent more credi
bility Saturday to arguments
debating Pac-8 quality. Col
orado State utilized ball control
to beat the winless Beavers 17-8
up in Corvallis Saturday. Run
ning back Ron Harris ripped
through the Oregon State de
fense for 122 yards on 28 carries
for the Rams.
