# Boosters turn booers
## Cards trampled, 31-21 
### DAVE SMITH 
There was a relatively new
topic of post-game conversation
in the Stanford locker room
after Saturday's 31-21 loss to
UCLA. It wasn't a subject as
tired as how well UCLA quar
terback. John Sciarra plays, or
why the Bruin runners got away
for 408 yards against the Card
defenders.
"1 don't care what the hell the
fans think," stormed linebacker
John Olenchalk. "We're behind
Coach Chris all the way."
The topic was one of the most
concerted exhibitions of booing
heard west of Philadelphia this
fall — and the target was the
Cardinal offense.
It didn't take much to get the
Cardinal fans started: they
began to sound off on the first
play of the game, an incomplete

Mike Cordova pass that was de
flected at the line. By the time
Cordova threw a first-quarter
swing pass over running back
Ron Inge's head, the crowd was
booing in earnest.
Perpetual booing
Aside from a few lapses —
notably during a 64-yard
touchdown bomb from Cordova
to streaking wide receiver Tony
Hill — the fans kept the hooting
going all afternoon. And the
Card players weren't too
pleased.
Hill's post-game comment, "I
don't think the fans understand
what's going on," seemed
genuinely charitable compared
to what some other players had
to say. Even the normally mild
Stanford Coach Jack Christian
sen reserved a few post-game
pokes for the fans.
"It's too bad when you hear
your players say at halftimethat
they feel like they're playing in a
visiting park," he said. "It must
be demoralizing for the players
to feel the student body isn't be
hind them."
Bruins helped out
In the first half the Bruins
seemed to be trying to compen
sate for the unkind treatment
the Cards were getting from the
disgruntled hometown fans.
The visitors moved deter
minedly during the first two
quarters, picking up 209 yards
total offense. Only the first
Bruin drive ended in a
touchdown. On the others,
UCLA was more generous.
For instanco, there was Sciar

ra's fumble on a fourth-and-o.ne
play at the Stanford 19 yard
line, ending a drive that had
seen Bruin backs Sciarra, Eddie
Ayers and Wendell Tyler rip
through the spread-out Card de
fense for 61 rushing yards.
On the next UCLA series,
something even more fortunate
for theCardinals happened: div
ing into the Stanford endzone,
Ayers dumped the football right
into the arms of safety Gerald
Wilson, and the Cards took over
on the UCLA 20, still trailing by
only a touchdown.
Unintentional help
Stanford went nowhere again
(Cordova completed only 6 of 16
passes in the half), but UCLA's
charity seemed limitless. Sci
arra took a hard shot from
linebacker Ray Cardinalli that
sent the ball flying backwards,
Wilson dove on it at the Bruin
28, and with 1:16 left in the half
the Cards had the sort of field
position that makes opposing
coaches wince.
The UCLA masterminds
needn't have. The Card mini
drive started inauspiciously as
Ron Inge ran into the line for
two yards.
On the next play Hill raced
into the endzone ahead of two
defenders and waited for what
seemed an interminable length
of time for Cordova's lobbed
pass to come down. Hill, now
that the defenders had caught
up with him, made a brilliant
leaping catch — and gestured
wildly when an official ruled
him out of the end zone.

Cordova threw strongly to Bill
Singler at the UCLA 7, and the
clock stopped when Singler had
the wind knocked out of him on
the tackle. The Cards had 29
seconds (with three time-outs) to
gain seven yards. They didn't
get anything.
Christiansen sent in three
pass plays, and Cordova over
threw all of them. "We had to go
with what we do best." said
Chris of his play-calling, source
of some post-game controversy.
With 15 seconds left, the usually
imperturbable Mike Langford
came on and muffed a 24-yard
field goal attempt. The Cards
went to the locker room
skunked.
They weren't so lucky after
they came out again. Sciarra
squirmed into the end zone on
the sixth play after the kickoff,
putting Stanford two
touchdowns behind. Cordova
was booed as he came on the
field, booed even louder as he
rambled aimlessly in the
backfield on a first-down bro
ken play.
The big score
But a few plays later came the
superb Cordova-to-Hill bomb,
probably the best pass Cordova
has thrown in Stanford
Stadium. The offense finally
seemed ready to challenge
UCLA, if the defense could hold
the Bruins as it had in the first
quarter.
This time, though, the Bruins
didn't seem bent on giving the
ball away. A pass-interference'
call on cornerback Rich Waters
gave UCLA the ball on the Stan
ford 12, and though UCLA end
James Sarpy obliged by drop
ping an easy pass in the end
zone, the Bruins got a field goal.
It was perhaps about this time,
that someone on Stanford's side
remembered watching a TV
football game the week before in
which an L.A. team had been
embarrassed by an opponent's
runners. Although the Stanford
runners didn't exactly look like
Archie Griffin and Pete Johnson
on the next series, they piled up
enough yardage to bring Stan
ford to within a field goal as the
final quarter began.
No closer
That was as close as they got.
The Bruins proved no slouches
at running the ball either. A late
Cordova interception ended the
Cards' faint hopes and set up a
UCLA touchdown that made the
score 31-14.
As a result, there wasn't much
cheering as the Cards put to
gether a late drive, Hill grabbing
a TD pass with one second left.
Cordova didn't go to the locker
room very satisfied.

John Olenchalk. "We're behind
Coach Chris all the way."
The topic was one of the most
concerted exhibitions of booing
heard west of Philadelphia this
fall — and the target was the
Cardinal offense.
It didn't take much to get the
Cardinal fans started: they
began to sound off on the first
play of the game, an incomplete

Mike Cordova pass that was de
flected at the line. By the time
Cordova threw a first-quarter
swing pass over running back
Ron Inge's head, the crowd was
booing in earnest.
Perpetual booing
Aside from a few lapses —
notably during a 64-yard
touchdown bomb from Cordova
to streaking wide receiver Tony
Hill — the fans kept the hooting
going all afternoon. And the
Card players weren't too
pleased.
Hill's post-game comment, "I
don't think the fans understand
what's going on," seemed
genuinely charitable compared
to what some other players had
to say. Even the normally mild
Stanford Coach Jack Christian
sen reserved a few post-game
pokes for the fans.
"It's too bad when you hear
your players say at halftimethat
they feel like they're playing in a
visiting park," he said. "It must
be demoralizing for the players
to feel the student body isn't be
hind them."
Bruins helped out
In the first half the Bruins
seemed to be trying to compen
sate for the unkind treatment
the Cards were getting from the
disgruntled hometown fans.
The visitors moved deter
minedly during the first two
quarters, picking up 209 yards
total offense. Only the first
Bruin drive ended in a
touchdown. On the others,
UCLA was more generous.
For instanco, there was Sciar

ra's fumble on a fourth-and-o.ne
play at the Stanford 19 yard
line, ending a drive that had
seen Bruin backs Sciarra, Eddie
Ayers and Wendell Tyler rip
through the spread-out Card de
fense for 61 rushing yards.
On the next UCLA series,
something even more fortunate
for theCardinals happened: div
ing into the Stanford endzone,
Ayers dumped the football right
into the arms of safety Gerald
Wilson, and the Cards took over
on the UCLA 20, still trailing by
only a touchdown.
Unintentional help
Stanford went nowhere again
(Cordova completed only 6 of 16
passes in the half), but UCLA's
charity seemed limitless. Sci
arra took a hard shot from
linebacker Ray Cardinalli that
sent the ball flying backwards,
Wilson dove on it at the Bruin
28, and with 1:16 left in the half
the Cards had the sort of field
position that makes opposing
coaches wince.
The UCLA masterminds
needn't have. The Card mini
drive started inauspiciously as
Ron Inge ran into the line for
two yards.
On the next play Hill raced
into the endzone ahead of two
defenders and waited for what
seemed an interminable length
of time for Cordova's lobbed
pass to come down. Hill, now
that the defenders had caught
up with him, made a brilliant
leaping catch — and gestured
wildly when an official ruled
him out of the end zone.

Cordova threw strongly to Bill
Singler at the UCLA 7, and the
clock stopped when Singler had
the wind knocked out of him on
the tackle. The Cards had 29
seconds (with three time-outs) to
gain seven yards. They didn't
get anything.
Christiansen sent in three
pass plays, and Cordova over
threw all of them. "We had to go
with what we do best." said
Chris of his play-calling, source
of some post-game controversy.
With 15 seconds left, the usually
imperturbable Mike Langford
came on and muffed a 24-yard
field goal attempt. The Cards
went to the locker room
skunked.
They weren't so lucky after
they came out again. Sciarra
squirmed into the end zone on
the sixth play after the kickoff,
putting Stanford two
touchdowns behind. Cordova
was booed as he came on the
field, booed even louder as he
rambled aimlessly in the
backfield on a first-down bro
ken play.
The big score
But a few plays later came the
superb Cordova-to-Hill bomb,
probably the best pass Cordova
has thrown in Stanford
Stadium. The offense finally
seemed ready to challenge
UCLA, if the defense could hold
the Bruins as it had in the first
quarter.
This time, though, the Bruins
didn't seem bent on giving the
ball away. A pass-interference'
call on cornerback Rich Waters
gave UCLA the ball on the Stan
ford 12, and though UCLA end
James Sarpy obliged by drop
ping an easy pass in the end
zone, the Bruins got a field goal.
It was perhaps about this time,
that someone on Stanford's side
remembered watching a TV
football game the week before in
which an L.A. team had been
embarrassed by an opponent's
runners. Although the Stanford
runners didn't exactly look like
Archie Griffin and Pete Johnson
on the next series, they piled up
enough yardage to bring Stan
ford to within a field goal as the
final quarter began.
No closer
That was as close as they got.
The Bruins proved no slouches
at running the ball either. A late
Cordova interception ended the
Cards' faint hopes and set up a
UCLA touchdown that made the
score 31-14.
As a result, there wasn't much
cheering as the Cards put to
gether a late drive, Hill grabbing
a TD pass with one second left.
Cordova didn't go to the locker
room very satisfied.
There was a relatively new
topic of post-game conversation
in the Stanford locker room
after Saturday's 31-21 loss to
UCLA. It wasn't a subject as
tired as how well UCLA quar
terback. John Sciarra plays, or
why the Bruin runners got away
for 408 yards against the Card
defenders.
"1 don't care what the hell the
fans think," stormed linebacker
John Olenchalk. "We're behind

Ron Inge's head, the crowd was
booing in earnest.
Perpetual booing
Aside from a few lapses —
notably during a 64-yard
touchdown bomb from Cordova
to streaking wide receiver Tony
Hill — the fans kept the hooting
going all afternoon. And the
Card players weren't too
pleased.
Hill's post-game comment, "I
don't think the fans understand
what's going on," seemed
genuinely charitable compared
to what some other players had
to say. Even the normally mild
Stanford Coach Jack Christian
sen reserved a few post-game
pokes for the fans.
"It's too bad when you hear
your players say at halftimethat
they feel like they're playing in a
visiting park," he said. "It must
be demoralizing for the players
to feel the student body isn't be
hind them."
Bruins helped out
In the first half the Bruins
seemed to be trying to compen
sate for the unkind treatment
the Cards were getting from the
disgruntled hometown fans.
The visitors moved deter
minedly during the first two
quarters, picking up 209 yards
total offense. Only the first
Bruin drive ended in a
touchdown. On the others,
UCLA was more generous.
For instanco, there was Sciar

ra's fumble on a fourth-and-o.ne
play at the Stanford 19 yard
line, ending a drive that had
seen Bruin backs Sciarra, Eddie
Ayers and Wendell Tyler rip
through the spread-out Card de
fense for 61 rushing yards.
On the next UCLA series,
something even more fortunate
for theCardinals happened: div
ing into the Stanford endzone,
Ayers dumped the football right
into the arms of safety Gerald
Wilson, and the Cards took over
on the UCLA 20, still trailing by
only a touchdown.
Unintentional help
Stanford went nowhere again
(Cordova completed only 6 of 16
passes in the half), but UCLA's
charity seemed limitless. Sci
arra took a hard shot from
linebacker Ray Cardinalli that
sent the ball flying backwards,
Wilson dove on it at the Bruin
28, and with 1:16 left in the half
the Cards had the sort of field
position that makes opposing
coaches wince.
The UCLA masterminds
needn't have. The Card mini
drive started inauspiciously as
Ron Inge ran into the line for
two yards.
On the next play Hill raced
into the endzone ahead of two
defenders and waited for what
seemed an interminable length
of time for Cordova's lobbed
pass to come down. Hill, now
that the defenders had caught
up with him, made a brilliant
leaping catch — and gestured
wildly when an official ruled
him out of the end zone.

Cordova threw strongly to Bill
Singler at the UCLA 7, and the
clock stopped when Singler had
the wind knocked out of him on
the tackle. The Cards had 29
seconds (with three time-outs) to
gain seven yards. They didn't
get anything.
Christiansen sent in three
pass plays, and Cordova over
threw all of them. "We had to go
with what we do best." said
Chris of his play-calling, source
of some post-game controversy.
With 15 seconds left, the usually
imperturbable Mike Langford
came on and muffed a 24-yard
field goal attempt. The Cards
went to the locker room
skunked.
They weren't so lucky after
they came out again. Sciarra
squirmed into the end zone on
the sixth play after the kickoff,
putting Stanford two
touchdowns behind. Cordova
was booed as he came on the
field, booed even louder as he
rambled aimlessly in the
backfield on a first-down bro
ken play.
The big score
But a few plays later came the
superb Cordova-to-Hill bomb,
probably the best pass Cordova
has thrown in Stanford
Stadium. The offense finally
seemed ready to challenge
UCLA, if the defense could hold
the Bruins as it had in the first
quarter.
This time, though, the Bruins
didn't seem bent on giving the
ball away. A pass-interference'
call on cornerback Rich Waters
gave UCLA the ball on the Stan
ford 12, and though UCLA end
James Sarpy obliged by drop
ping an easy pass in the end
zone, the Bruins got a field goal.
It was perhaps about this time,
that someone on Stanford's side
remembered watching a TV
football game the week before in
which an L.A. team had been
embarrassed by an opponent's
runners. Although the Stanford
runners didn't exactly look like
Archie Griffin and Pete Johnson
on the next series, they piled up
enough yardage to bring Stan
ford to within a field goal as the
final quarter began.
No closer
That was as close as they got.
The Bruins proved no slouches
at running the ball either. A late
Cordova interception ended the
Cards' faint hopes and set up a
UCLA touchdown that made the
score 31-14.
As a result, there wasn't much
cheering as the Cards put to
gether a late drive, Hill grabbing
a TD pass with one second left.
Cordova didn't go to the locker
room very satisfied.
There was a relatively new
topic of post-game conversation
in the Stanford locker room
after Saturday's 31-21 loss to
UCLA. It wasn't a subject as
tired as how well UCLA quar
terback. John Sciarra plays, or
why the Bruin runners got away
for 408 yards against the Card
defenders.
"1 don't care what the hell the
fans think," stormed linebacker
John Olenchalk. "We're behind
Coach Chris all the way."
The topic was one of the most
concerted exhibitions of booing
heard west of Philadelphia this
fall — and the target was the
Cardinal offense.
It didn't take much to get the
Cardinal fans started: they
began to sound off on the first
play of the game, an incomplete

Mike Cordova pass that was de
flected at the line. By the time
Cordova threw a first-quarter
swing pass over running back
Ron Inge's head, the crowd was
booing in earnest.
Perpetual booing
Aside from a few lapses —
notably during a 64-yard
touchdown bomb from Cordova
