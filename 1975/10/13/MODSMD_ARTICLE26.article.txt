# Booters surprise UCLA
## 
### JEFF WAHBA 
Though still winless the Stan
ford soccer players came away
with an impressive tie against
UCLA Saturday. It dropped a
3-1 decision to Cal State Fuller
ton on Sunday to make its re
cord 0-4-1.

Playing their fourth and fifth
games within eight days, the
booters seemed to tire in both
contests as they built early leads
only to see them fade away in
the second halves.
The Cardinals showed their
most aggressive play of the sea
son against the Bruins, ranked
fifth in the West. Playing infront
of nearly 200 fans, Stanford
applied constant pressure that
accounted for the only score of
the first period when a centered
ball was accidentally kicked
backwards by a UCLA man past
his own goalie.
Opening the second half in a
rainstorm theCardinals kept up
their hustle as a lead pass from
Phil Wright to Rick Morrow ac
counted for their second and
last goal.
Spurred by the chants of the

UCLA cheerleaders who were
making their way to the football
game, the Bruins took advan
tage of Stanford's strategy of try
ing to protect its lead and
outplayed the Cardinals after
Morrow's goal to tie the score.
The game went into two 10-
minute overtime periods, but
both teams came up scoreless.
In Sunday's contest against
Fullerton Stanford's arduous
schedule finally took its toll as
the Titans came up with three
second-period goals.
The Cardinals led at the half
1-0 as Wright scored midway
through the half on a penalty
shot after a tripping violation.
Picking up aggressiveness the
Titans put away the game as
they scored all three of their
goals in a span of about 15 mi
nutes midway through the sec
ond half.
