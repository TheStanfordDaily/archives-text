# Poloists outlast Bruins
## 
### CHRIS KAMEI 
While most Stanford fans
were waiting in line before the
Stanford-UCLA game, theCards
had already beaten the Bruins
— in water polo, that is.
The Cards' 3-2 victory last
Saturday at deCuerre was
paced by leading scorer Rick
Johannsen's two goals and a
tight defense that was backed up
by the fine goaltending of Chris
Dorst.
"We played well defensively.
I was very pleased with the play
of Dorst. He made three or four
crucial blocks. Of course
Johannsen did a fine job on of
fense once again with those two

goals," Stanford head Coach Art
Lambert said.
Lambert's praise for the of
fense stopped there, however, as
the usually potent scoring of
fense stalled in front of the
sloughed-off Bruin zone defense
— the same the Cards had blis
tered by a 12-7 score over the
summer.
"We just didn't control the
ball on offense. We lacked our
usual mobility. We were just re
luctant to make moves, being af
raid to get burned. We played as
poorly on offense as we did well
on defense," he said.
The games were different

however, according to the sec
ond year Stanford water polo
coach, as the game conditions
were different.
"As always, when we play
UCLA, it is a very physical
game. The officials this game
were different from the ones
over the summer, however.
They are very consistent offi
cials, but they are known to be
loose. Aside from that, the
players were very nervous.
Everyone was tense with it being
our first game of the Pac-8 sea
son and the fact that we have a
very promising one ahead. We
were just like violin strings out

there," commented Lambert.
The Cards relinquished part
of their game plan by not pres
sing the Bruins all over the pool.
They simply couldn't get on
track, all day, which baffled
Lambert after the Cards offense
picked apart UC Davis, 20-6,
only the day before.
"Davis has always been a
mystery to me. We led them 10-3
at the half, which was the final
score of our win against them in
the NorCal tournament, but they
are a good team. What concerns
me the most is whether games
like Davis that precede a big
Pac-8 game take the edge off our
play," he said.
The Cards will try to sharpen
that edge this Saturday as they
travel to Berkeley to meet Cal in
an attempt to try to duplicate
Stanford's 10-7 win over the
Bears for the NorCal tourna
ment championship two weeks
ago. What they will try not to
duplicate is what Lambert
termed an "uneventful game"
against UCLA.
