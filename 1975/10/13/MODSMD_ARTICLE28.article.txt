# Alums enjoy Sunday run

"You can sit on your hind end just so long, then
you've got to get out and make the blood flow,"
lectured a 1925 Cornell graduate after he
finished the five-mile Alumni Cross-Country Run
yesterday morning.
The winner of the second annual event — it
was really only 4.H miles — was Jim Dare of the
West Valley Track Club. Dare, who obtained a
Master's Degree in operations research in '72 and
another in industrial engineering in '75 from
Stanford, completed the run in 23:12.
"I didn't think the course was too bad. I ran it
last year for fun. I think I came in third unoffi
cially," Dare said. He is planning to compete in
the National AAU Cross-Country Meet in Mary
land this summer.
The majority of the runners were competing
just for some fun and exercise. One second year
law student observed, "The course was pretty
good. Everyone spread out pretty well. The best
runners you only saw at the start so eventually
you end up running against people in your same
level.
Harder running
"This makes you run harder than you would in
a competition. The run was a lot of fun because
everyone is so low-key about it. One thing you
have to watch out for is some old coot coming out

of the woods," he added. "Some of those guys are
in good shape."
A class of '39 alum enjoyed the run and said, "I
ran it last year and will next year, if 1 stay in
shape.
"It's work. I'm always disappointed I can't do
better," commented another jogger.
One young alum noticed, "The problem with
Stanford is most people come out of the school
middle-aged because they don't get any exer
cise."
Well worth it
"They should do this two or three times a
year," said two Stanford coeds. "It was great. We
did it last year and will be here again next year.'
"Thank God it rained yesterday or this would
have been a lousy course. I think this must be the
way Stanford finds out if its alumni are well
balanced. If you make it through this, you must
be well-balanced. But it's not really fair to get the
alumni out of bed so early to do this after a lot of
post-game partying last night," said another
alum.
Most of the finishers looked a bit exhausted at
the run's end, but after making the trek over to
the Women's PE fields for a few taps from the
kegs, they appeared rejuvenated and ready to
come back for next year's jaunt.

The majority of the runners were competing
just for some fun and exercise. One second year
law student observed, "The course was pretty
good. Everyone spread out pretty well. The best
runners you only saw at the start so eventually
you end up running against people in your same
level.
Harder running
"This makes you run harder than you would in
a competition. The run was a lot of fun because
everyone is so low-key about it. One thing you
have to watch out for is some old coot coming out

of the woods," he added. "Some of those guys are
in good shape."
A class of '39 alum enjoyed the run and said, "I
ran it last year and will next year, if 1 stay in
shape.
"It's work. I'm always disappointed I can't do
better," commented another jogger.
One young alum noticed, "The problem with
Stanford is most people come out of the school
middle-aged because they don't get any exer
cise."
Well worth it
"They should do this two or three times a
year," said two Stanford coeds. "It was great. We
did it last year and will be here again next year.'
"Thank God it rained yesterday or this would
have been a lousy course. I think this must be the
way Stanford finds out if its alumni are well
balanced. If you make it through this, you must
be well-balanced. But it's not really fair to get the
alumni out of bed so early to do this after a lot of
post-game partying last night," said another
alum.
Most of the finishers looked a bit exhausted at
the run's end, but after making the trek over to
the Women's PE fields for a few taps from the
kegs, they appeared rejuvenated and ready to
come back for next year's jaunt.
"You can sit on your hind end just so long, then
you've got to get out and make the blood flow,"
lectured a 1925 Cornell graduate after he
finished the five-mile Alumni Cross-Country Run
yesterday morning.
The winner of the second annual event — it
was really only 4.H miles — was Jim Dare of the
West Valley Track Club. Dare, who obtained a
Master's Degree in operations research in '72 and
another in industrial engineering in '75 from
Stanford, completed the run in 23:12.
"I didn't think the course was too bad. I ran it
last year for fun. I think I came in third unoffi
cially," Dare said. He is planning to compete in
the National AAU Cross-Country Meet in Mary
land this summer.
