FBI tracks escaped convicts
SALEM, 111. — A convicted killer was captured
yesterday as a stolen car carrying five dangerous
escapees from a federal prison crashed near this
Southern Illinois city, police said.
Nearly 200 FBI agents, state and local police
combed a three-mile area of thick weeds and farm
land with tracking dogs for the other four escapees
from the Marion Federal Penitentiary, who fled
after the wreck.
Wayne Friend, one of two Salem policemen who
spotted the c?r, said he wounded one of the four
men with a shotgun blast.
An FBI agent with the dog team said the inmates
appeared to be heading south. The dogs were fol
lowing a trail of blood and four sets of human
foottracks, he said. Two airplanes, a helicopter
and two, five-man Special Weapons and Tactical
Units also were aiding in the search, officials said.
Musicians' strike ends
NEW YORK — Broadway musicians voted last
night to accept a new contract and end a 25-day
strike which had darkened a dozen theaters and
lost $3.5 million in ticket sales.
The strike, the longest walkout ever to hit the
Great White Way, put hundreds of singers, dan
cers, barmen and restaurant employes out of work.
School merger
(Continued from front page)
One of the strongest cases for the merger, propo
nents say, is that none of Ravenswood's five
elementary schools has a librarian, a music prog
ram, an art program, a science lab or foreign lan
guage instruction.
Low scores
Ravenswood achievement scores in math and
reading are near the bottom in the state ranking;
those of students in surrounding districts are near
the top.
Many parents in Ravenswood, both black and
white, have removed their children from local
schools by "sneaking out" to other districts, in
cluding Palo Alot.

Members of Local 802 of the American Federa
tion of Musicians voted 189 to 76 to accept the new
contract, but the pact still had to win the approval
of the League of New York Theaters and Produc
ers.
Max Arons, president of Local 802, said the
musicians were ready to go back to work Monday.
Congress tackles oil issues
WASHINGTON — After months of wrangling,
Congress will attempt to find legislative solutions
to the nation's energy problems when it returns
from a 10-day recess next week.
The lawmakers' attention will focus on two
problems: alleviating an expected natural gas
shortage this winter and reducing American de
pendence on foreign oil.
Also pending are tax reform and tax reduction
legislation and seven appropriations bills, includ
ing the ones covering defense spending and
foreign aid.
A far-reaching energy proposal is being worked
out in a House-Senate conference committee. It
could determine whether the price on so-called
"old oil," which comprises 60 percent of domestic
pi.jduction, would remain frozen at its present
lev. ' of $5.25 a barrel.
New Social Security program
WASHINGTON — A federal program permit
ting Social Security checks to be sent directly to a
recipient's bank has prompted bankers to court
elderly customers they previously ignored, reports
a retirees organization.
The program began in July. With its implemen
tation this month in the Northeast, it is in operation
across the country.
The enrollment rate is four months ahead of
original estimates and the U.S. Treasury, banks
and the American Association of Retired Persons
say they are pleased by the results. Seven percent
of all Social Security recipients have signed up,
according to the Treasury Department.
The program was designed to save the govern
ment money and frustrate forgers and thieves who
break into mail boxes at housing projects for the
alderly on the day Social Security checks are due.
