Emeritus Education Prof. Paul
Hanna has donated to the University
his campus house, designed by famed
architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
Hanna said he decided to donate his
home, called the Honeycomb House,
to "be sure that the house is preserved.
We (Hanna and his wife) decided to do
it at this time because we want to be
alive to help with the planning."
They hope that the house will ulti
mately become the residence for a
series of distinguished visiting profes
sors.
Until funds can be raised to endow a
visiting professorship and for the
maintenance of the Honeycomb
House, President Richard Lyman has
designated the home as the University

Provost's residence.
Provost William Miller moved into
the house last weekend. "It's very ex
citing," Miller said last night. "It's
like living inside a sculpture. There
are also good facilities for much of the
entertaining 1 have to do."
'Magnificent gift'
Lyman stated: "The magnificent gift
of this veritable architectural treasure
is a great addition to the University,
and I look forward to the time when it
will be occupied by a succession of
scholars of world distinction.
"Meanwhile. I am pleased that it
will provide the first official residence
for the University's provost, whose
duties have grown to include many
official functions which can only be

accommodated in a home built on the
Honeycomb House scale."
The residence was built in 1937,
and is a famous example of Wright's
architectural talent. For many years.
Wright had been trying to "break
open the box" of conventional, re
ctilinear building. The commission by
the Hannas in 1935 gave Wright the
chancfe to put into practice the innova
tive design scheme based on the hexa
gon.
Hanna said that the open 120 degree
angles of the hexagon, "provide a flow
of space you can't get in a 90 degree
design." The hexagon shape also ap
pears in the landscaping and many of
the home furnishings, some of which
were also designed by Wright.
'More fertility and flexibility'
Wright chose the hexagon shape be
cause, "I am convinced that the
cross-section of the honeycomb has
more fertility and flexibility where
human movement is concerned than
the square. The obtuse angle (120 de
grees) is more suited to human 'to and
fro' than the right angle."
The Hannas have lived in the Hon
eycomb House for 38 years, and dur
ing this time have made hundreds of
friends who have come to the unique
home.
Architecture classes and groups
have come from all parts of the world
to visit what the American Institute of
Architects has designated "one of the
17 American buildings designed by
Frank Lloyd Wright to be retained as
an example of his architectural con
tribution to American culture."
The Hannas have moved to the new
Pearce Mitchell Houses, a
University-sponsored campus hous
ing development for emeritus and
junior faculty and staff.
Hanna, who retired in 1967 after 33
years on the faculty of the School of
Education, is the Lee L. Jacks Profes
sor of Child Education. Emeritus. He
was also recently appointed Senior
Research Fellow of the I loover Institu
tion.
