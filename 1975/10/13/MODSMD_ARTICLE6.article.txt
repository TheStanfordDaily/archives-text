## 
### MARK FUNK 
Jimmy Carter, one of eight Democ
rats currently currently campaigning
for the presidency, called for a com
prehensive energy program and sing
led out Florida as a key primary state
in an address Friday afternoon at
Bowman Alumni House.
The former Georgia governor,
speaking amid heavy security precau
tions, also called the Ford administra
tion "an abject, total failure," and
criticized the President's proposed
$28-billion tax cut. Approximately
200 persons were on hand for the
speech, which was sponsored by the
ASSII Speakers Bureau.
Carter said in California for the
eighth time since announcing his
dandidacy in January, said top prior
ity must be given to the energy crisis.
"No matter who the next president
is," Carter stated "he will have to face
the energy issue." Pointing out that
known oil reserves in the United
States will be depleted in a projected
38 years, Carter said America would
have to turn to coal.
'We have coal'
"We have coal reserves — easily
mined and clean — which should last
for 200 years." Carter said, "and we
have more coal which is more difficult
to mine which will last 300 years."
Nuclear power, Carter said, would
have to make up the remainder of the
U.S.'s energy supply. A physicist who
worked in the U.S. Navy's atomic
energy program. Carter expressed
dissatisfaction with the current reg
ulatory guidelines for nuclear reac

tors and said a way must be found to
dispose of radioactive wastes.
Aiming for Florida
Politically, Carter, who has been
called a Southern alternative to
George Wallace, said his organization
is aiming towards the March 9 Florida
presidential primary and the January
12 delegate selection caucuses in
lowa.
"We feel that Florida will be a key
state for us," Carter said. "We feel we
can do well there. We will prove that
Wallace is losing some of his popular
ity. He is a perennial loser."

Carter also predicted that there
would be no more than three candi
dates still in the running for the
Democratic nomination after the
Florida primary.
"1 will be one of them," he stated. "I
will be at the convention when the last
vote is counted."
'An insult'
Characterizing Ford's $28-billion
tax cut proposal as "an insult to the
American people," Carter went to the
defense of Congress in its tug-of-war
with the president.
"To propose a $28-billion tax cut
and expect Congress to cut the budget
by the same amount defies political
imagination," Carter said.

eighth time since announcing his
dandidacy in January, said top prior
ity must be given to the energy crisis.
"No matter who the next president
is," Carter stated "he will have to face
the energy issue." Pointing out that
known oil reserves in the United
States will be depleted in a projected
38 years, Carter said America would
have to turn to coal.
'We have coal'
"We have coal reserves — easily
mined and clean — which should last
for 200 years." Carter said, "and we
have more coal which is more difficult
to mine which will last 300 years."
Nuclear power, Carter said, would
have to make up the remainder of the
U.S.'s energy supply. A physicist who
worked in the U.S. Navy's atomic
energy program. Carter expressed
dissatisfaction with the current reg
ulatory guidelines for nuclear reac

tors and said a way must be found to
dispose of radioactive wastes.
Aiming for Florida
Politically, Carter, who has been
called a Southern alternative to
George Wallace, said his organization
is aiming towards the March 9 Florida
presidential primary and the January
12 delegate selection caucuses in
lowa.
"We feel that Florida will be a key
state for us," Carter said. "We feel we
can do well there. We will prove that
Wallace is losing some of his popular
ity. He is a perennial loser."

Carter also predicted that there
would be no more than three candi
dates still in the running for the
Democratic nomination after the
Florida primary.
"1 will be one of them," he stated. "I
will be at the convention when the last
vote is counted."
'An insult'
Characterizing Ford's $28-billion
tax cut proposal as "an insult to the
American people," Carter went to the
defense of Congress in its tug-of-war
with the president.
"To propose a $28-billion tax cut
and expect Congress to cut the budget
by the same amount defies political
imagination," Carter said.
Jimmy Carter, one of eight Democ
rats currently currently campaigning
for the presidency, called for a com
prehensive energy program and sing
led out Florida as a key primary state
in an address Friday afternoon at
Bowman Alumni House.
The former Georgia governor,
speaking amid heavy security precau
tions, also called the Ford administra
tion "an abject, total failure," and
criticized the President's proposed

200 persons were on hand for the
speech, which was sponsored by the
ASSII Speakers Bureau.
