# Palo Alto schools face Mid-Peninsula merger
## 
### STEVE HEFTER 
The Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict edged a step closer early Friday
morning towards integration with
schools in .southern San Mateo
County, including the predominantly
black Ravenswood Elementary
School District.
The Santa Clara County Committee
on School District Organization voted
6-4 in favor of requesting the State
Board of Education to call an election
on the matter, possibly in June of 1976.
The vote followed a five-hour public
hearing at Cunn High School, at
tended by about 1000 area residents.
The proposed merger would estab
lish a 23,000-student Mid-Peninsula
Unified School District. The district
would include the Palo Alto Unified
School District; Las Lomitas, Menlo
Park. Portola Valley and Ravenswood
Elementary School Districts, and por
tions of the Sequoia Union High
School District, including Menlo-
Atherton and Ravenswood High
Schools.
'Vote of the people'
The Mid-Peninsula Task Force for
Integrated Education, a group of 500
citizens and educators that initiated
the proposal, claims the merger
would achieve "racial desegregation
through a vote of the people rather
than relying on litigation and court
order."
According to Marjorie Movlan. the
group's chairperson, the proposal
was made about two years ago. Since

that time, the San Mateo County coun
terpart for school district organiza
tion has rejected the proposal.
The San Mateo group will now be
asked for recommendations and con
currence to Santa Clara County's ac
tion, but action by either county alone
is enough to send the proposal to the
state.
If the state approves, a vote of resi
dents in the districts would be held
next year.
At last Thursday night's marathon
meeting Richard A. Mowers, a consul
tant to the committee, recommended
that the proposal be dropped.
'Community identity'
Bowers said it met racial, ethnic
and size requirements of the state but
did not represent "substantial com
munity identity."
Other opponents argued that the
proposed merger would require bus
ing. upset "natural boundaries,"
cause taxes in all districts to rise, raise
many salaries, and therefore rob the
system of educational programs.
John Seidl. a lecturer in the Stanford
Business School and a Menlo Park re
sident, spoke in favor of the merger,
calling opposition to it, "a hardening
of the boundaries." Seidl called on
area residents to recognize that they
are citizens of the mid-peninsula, not
just residents of individual cities.
To date, opponents of the merger
have claimed over 3500 signatures of
residents opposed to the proposal.
