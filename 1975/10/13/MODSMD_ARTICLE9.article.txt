## Opinions editorial Parking woes 
### 
Expensive and restrictive parking permits con
fronted faculty, staff and students when they returned
here this fall. Despite complaints from students and a
United Stanford Employees (U.S.E.) lawsuit and
boycott of the permits, the Daily believes the Univer
sity is justified in increasing parking fees.
We support the ultimate purpose of the new fees —
to divert traffic from the center of campus. Therefore,
we disapprove of the U.S.E. boycott and lawsui*.
U.S.E. claims that faculty and staff should not have to
pay parking fees, and thus suffer a reduction in
wages, just to work here.
University officials must do their fair share too,
however.
Many people have complained that the "G" parking
lots are too far away from the campus destinations of
most drivers. We suggest the University immediately
begin studying the feasibility of a shuttle bus system
from the parking lots to various spots on campus.
The lack of security at the "G" lots has also been a
topic of concern. There have been a number of van
dalism cases, particularly at the Medical Center lots,
reported to the police. We believe that some of the
money from the transportation fund should be used to
pay for tighter security in the outer parking areas.
Students, faculty and staff are being inconvienced
for the sake of the University; it's the University's
responsibility to make that inconvenience as painless
as possible.
