# Lack of protest about recession puzzles Upset
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Seymour Martin Lipset is nonchal
ant about his recent decision to leave
Harvard after a decade to accept a
position at Stanford.
"I've always liked living in Califor
ni a more than in the east," says Lipset,
a New Yorker by birth and education.
"Two or three times during the past
few years, I've considered accepting
west coast appointments. I taught at
Berkeley for many years before going
to Harvard and I like the west."
Lipset, 53, says he left Harvard for
personal reasons rather than due to
any complaints about that university.
The adjustment to life at Stanford
has been easy, says Lipset, who ar
rived here last summer to accept ap
pointments as professor of sociology
and political science and Hoover In
stitution fellow.
"My general feeling is that academe
is more like itself than it is like any

part of the country that it is in," Lipset
says. "You run into very similar val
ues and opinions when you are at
schools of roughly similar quality.
'A different world'
"If you go one mile off campus
you're in a different world, but you
can travel 3000 miles to another col
lege and stay in the same world.
Lipset should know. He has spent
most of his life studying the political
attitudes of the academic world.
Through nearly a dozen books and
scores of articles, Lipset has become
one of the best known American intel
lectuals.
"Lipset has had a very distin
guished career," says Prof. Richard
Brody, chairman of the political sci
ence department. "He's one of the
leading political sociologists in the
world."
Although recognized for many
years in the academic world as a scho

lar, Lipset first achieved large scale
popular attention during the campus
upheavals of the late '60s and early
70s when his reserch attempted to
explain the origins of the unrest.
Effects of war
Aside from the obvious effects of the
Vietnam War's end and the recession
on ending protest, Lipset says he has
found that social unrest usually fol
lows four to five year cycles.
"It's hard to maintain the sort of
momentum that an extremist move
ment needs," Lipset contends. "As ex
tremists often drive out the moderates
by scaring or intimidating them. And
once an issue ends — as with the end
of the Vietnam War — it is particu
larly hard to find continued support
for a radical movement.
"People are normally not political.
Not too many people find it pleasura
ble to go to meetings and to work for a
political cause," he says. "They need a
pretty hefty motivation. Extreme
political movements don't easily sus
tain themselves."
Lipset expresses surprise that the
recession has not replaced the war as
an issue of popular discontent.
"What surprises me most about the

recession is how little overt protest
there has been," Lipset says."The
easiest focus for such discontent
would be George Wallace, but he isn't
stronger than usual. About one-fifth of
the country is pro-Wallace — even
though many of his supporters
wouldn't vote for him — but his
strength comes mainly from the race
issue."
Just as there has been no sign of
extremism on the right, the left also
has been quiet during the recession,
Lipset observes.
"There has been no resurgence on
the left," Lipset says. "There has some
growth among radical caucuses in the
labor movement, but not much. If
conditions are so bad as the un
employment figures indicate, why
aren't people reacting?"
Lipset answers his own question by
saying that unemployment benefits
and unemployment among women
whose husbands can support them
partly explain the lack of protest.
Unemployment breeds retreat
"Another factor is that when people
are unemployed, they tend to retreat
personally," Lipset says. "They be

come less available for collective ac
tion. It is during periods of economic
upswing that people protest."
"If there were a 25 percent un
employment rate such as there was at
the depth of the Great Depression,
people would know that they could
work themselves to the bone and it
wouldn't make a difference in helping
them to find work," Lipset explains.
"But when the recession is bad
enough to cause worry but not
economic collapse, the competitive
ethos is reinforced rather than the col
lective."
Lipset says he will continue his re

search on protest movements while at
Stanford although he currently is
more interested in studying the politi
cal orientation of the academic com
munity.
Obvious delight
With the obvious delight of a man
who knows his subject well, Lipset
explains that his theory among elite
universities, the academiccommunity
is divided more according to field of
study than according to school.
Lipset points out that a large major
ity of engineering and business pro
fessors vote Republican but that most
social scientists are Democrats. There
is a 60 percent variation in political

preference between some professions,
he adds.

But Lipset. who authored a book on
academic electoral behavior in the
1972 election, admits it is difficult to
tell how academics will vote next
year.
"Academics are as confused as
anybody, since it isn't clear who the
Democrat candidate will be," Lipset
says. "There isn't anyone yet for
which academe has a preference,"
Intellectual response
Lipset says that the intellectual re
sponse toward Ford will depend
largely on professors' general politi
cal leanings.
He notes that academics as a whole
are more Democratic than most vot
ers. In 1972, for example, only 43 per
cent supported Nixon, although
Nixon garnered 60.7 percent of the
vote in the general population.
Even Nixon's showing among
academics was better than that of
most Republican presidential candi
dates, Lipset says.
"When most groups move to the
right, professors swing to the right,"
Lipset says. Only blacks and Jews re
main solidly behind the Democrats, he
explains.
Lipset says he is looking forward to
explaining his theories of political
sociology in an undergraduate class
and a graduate seminar he will teach
next winter.
Despite the large amount of time he
spends in research, Lipset says he
does not find that teaching loads st
rain his schedule.
"Teaching is not the most time
consuming thing other than research,
— administrative chores are," Lipset
maintains.
