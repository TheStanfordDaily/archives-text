# Frats aren't placated

I don't know if Bonny Rodden in her article in
the Oct. 10 Daily was attempting to stir the pot or
provide comment. I wonder at her assessment of
attitudes in the fraternity community.
A resigned depression may be closer to the
truth than her view that it is content with housing
reforms. 1 for one. and I believe a fair majority of
those in the fraternity system, feel that we have
had the present housing system railroaded into
existence despite quite valid objections.
I cannot speak for any other house directly but
the arguments presented can be altered to fit the
situation. My house, Theta Xi, was built as a
fraternity at no cost or inconvenience to the Uni
versity. It was paid for and is maintained by its
membership. The house has never been a direct
financial liability to the University.
To this day, the only concern the University
has for us is that we pay our rent, water and
garbage charges. There was of course a time dur
ing World War II when the house was taken over,
but I believecircumstanc.es were somewhat diffe
rent at the time.
Membership of Theta Xi has provided the
housing system with thirty spaces at no cost. We
have made this contribution to the housing «vs-

tem, we have maintained our plant and grounds
at no cost to the University. We have asked only
to remain a fraternity and for the University to let
us handle our own affairs.
What has the University done for us? Origi
nally it helped us to secure a loan to build the
house. Thereafter, aside from a steady flow of
rules and regulations, and a disregard for inter
fraternity conflicts, not a heck of a lot was done.
The real clincher is this housing new deal. The
great egalitarian enlightenment has come! Larry
Horton from deep within the bowels of the ad
ministration proclaims that all must share! That
if all cannot have a chance then it is his duty to
drag in those who on their own initiative attempt
to seek a solution to their housing problems.
But Horton has taken something which was not
his to trifle with. He has gone to the general stu
dent body saying "I am benevolent, look what I
have done for you!"
Over the summer. Rodden tells us, the hard
feelings wrought by this injustice have mellowed.
Perhaps, but I for one am still quite angry at the
arrogant, self-perpetuating actions of Horton and
the housing office.

I don't know if Bonny Rodden in her article in
the Oct. 10 Daily was attempting to stir the pot or
provide comment. I wonder at her assessment of
attitudes in the fraternity community.
A resigned depression may be closer to the
truth than her view that it is content with housing
reforms. 1 for one. and I believe a fair majority of
those in the fraternity system, feel that we have
had the present housing system railroaded into
existence despite quite valid objections.
I cannot speak for any other house directly but
the arguments presented can be altered to fit the
