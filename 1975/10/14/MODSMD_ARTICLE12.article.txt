# Ford reveals his right-wing nature
## 
### 
Virtually no one could quarrel with Pres
ident Ford's frequent defenses of the value
of individual initiative — I've never known
anyone who wanted laziness and passivity
to prevail among the American populace.
But when one goes beyond Ford's rhetoric
and examines his actions, one finds that his
speeches in favor of individual initiative
are merely a flimsy cloak and a crude
rationalization for his reactionary domestic
policies.
Ford has continually opposed legislation
that would benefit poor and oppressed
groups in American society. In order to jus
tify his attacks on federal welfare measures,
he contends that he merely is helping
hard-working taxpayers and trying to pro
tect Americans from excessive governmen
tal intervention in their lives.
Such defenses are little more than a gen
teel version of George Wallace's bombastic
appeals to voters who wrongly fear that so
cial legislation undermines the work ethic.
A shocking veto
Ford's latest attempt at curbing govern
ment service to the poor, his veto of a $2.7
billion extension and broadening of federal
school lunch and child nutrition programs,
shocked even some of his conservative sup
porters.
Contending that the bill was too costly
and inflationary and would further deprive
Americans of individual responsibility.
Ford flew in the face of congressional opin
ion in vetoing the measure.
He also went against the basic legislative
trends of industrialized nations.
Every major nation has witnessed
large-scale growth in recent years of such
services as school lunch programs, in most
nations, a moderate extension of programs
such as those embodied in the bill Ford vet
oed would receive approval from both right

ist and leftist leaders.
Even the 1972 decision by Margaret
Thatcher (then Minister of Health in Ed
ward Heath's Conservative Government) to
eliminate free milk in the British schools —
a decision which won her the name
"Thatcher the Milk Snatcher" — was made
only in order to finance school improve
ment.
It is therefore no wonder that members of

both ends of the political spectrum in Con
gress united to override Ford's veto. The
vote in the House of Representatives was an
overwhelming 397 to 18, or more than 100
more than the two-thirds majority needed to
override the veto. The Senate vote was 79 to
13 to override.
The extent of congressional opposition to
Ford was symbolized by the votes of Ford's
staunch supporters in the GOP congres
sional leadership to override his veto; both
Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-
Pa.), and House Minority Leader )ohn }.
Rhodes, (R-Ariz.) voted against the Presi
dent.
While both men, called conservatives by
pundits, have records of opposing massive
federal spending, they have usually sup
ported humanitarian measures such as the
school lunch program. This stance is proba
bly a mixture of moral conviction and rec

ognition of political reality.
For example, Rhodes not long ago spon
sored a measure that would permit the el
derly poor to fly on airlines for reduced
fares.
The strong congressional rebuke to Ford
on the school lunch measure has two impor
tant ramifications for the future of the Ford
presidency.
Another smear
Thefi rst is that Ford will attempt to smear
Congress with charges of "fiscal irresponsi
bility" during the upcoming election cam
paign. Ford,who apparently likes to com
pare himself to Harry Truman, remembers
that Truman's charges that Congress wasn't
doing anything helped elect Truman in
1948.
Ford also will probably try to run against
Congress. But this attempt is likely to
backfire, since this time it is the President,
and not Congress, who advocates an inac
tive government.
Secondly, Ford's veto shows that his poli
tics haven't changed much since he rep
resented Grand Rapids. When Ford took of
fice it was widely observed that Ford's right
ist record reflected Grand Rapids views
more than Ford's. It was predicted that Ford
would be mildly progressive.
But vetoing moderate social welfare mea
sures opposed only by hard core right
wingers such as Rep. Phillip Crane (R-Ill.)
and John Rousselot (R-Calif), is not the mark
of a centrist president.
And Ford's insistence that he merely
wants to encourage individual initiative is
invalid since the children who will benefit
from the school lunch bill he vetoed can't
learn the meaning of self-reliance unless
they are properly fed.
