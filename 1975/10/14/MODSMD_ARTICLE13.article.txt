# Hearst case captures childish imagination
## 
### 
I find it extremely difficult to
remember when I last read a
newspaper, viewed a televised
news show or listened to a radio
commentary which failed to
contain some mention of Pat
ricia Hearst.
Particularly during the time
since her recent capture, she has
undoubtedly commanded more
air time and newspaper cover
age than any other figure in the
public eye. The media's inces
sant treatment of her story has

rendered Hearst nothing less
than a unique new American
celebrity, and I would express
little surprise if Patty Hearst
T-shirts suddenly came into
vogue.
In view of the fact that kid
napings bank holdups and
murders are commonplace in
our society, I am initially puz
zled by the media's obsession
with Hearst. The appearance is
often that of deliberate inclusion
of her name even when there is
no real news to report.
Such items as "a ruling on
Patricia Hearst's mental compe
tency will not come for at least
two weeks ..." on a recent As
sociated Press release serve to
illustrate the point.
Childish fascination
Hearst's story, that of a weal
thy young girl kidnapped and
mysteriously transformed into a
violent revolutionary, is obvi
ously intriguing to the Ameri
can public.
Hence, media exploitation of
the sensationalism of the case is
a sufficient explanation for the
extreme coverage. Nevertheless,
I cannot help but feel that her
family background is the over
riding factor; an identical story
involving some obscure person
would hardly provoke such
widespread attention.

Whatever the actual reason,
my purpose here is not to deal
with it as such, but rather to
question the press' justification
for excessive coverage in light of
its legal implications. The
strong possibility that Patty will
soon be brought to trial raises
the issue of pre-trial publicity
and its influence on the judicial
process.
Pre-trial publicity.
In a recent CBS radio edito
rial, Walter Cronkite consi
dered these facts and reached
theconclusion that Hearst could
not possibly utilize pre-trial
publicity as grounds for a suc
cessful appeal. However, the al
ready overwhelming media
coverage of the Hearst case
leads me to believe otherwise.
To assume that Hearst's right to
a fair trial has not been jeopar
dized by it is absurd; implicit in
Cronkite's very consideration of
a possible appeal is the assump
tion that she has already been
tried and found guilty.
Prospective jurors, as well as
the general public, are not likely
to come through a ceaseless bar
rage of such implications un
scathed.
The mass media has. in the
Hearst case, gone critically

David John Sartoris

beyond its responsibility to ac
curately convey news to the
public. In doing so, it has not
only trespassed upon the rights
of an individual, but has also
added confusion to an already
complex judicial situation.

leads me to believe otherwise.
To assume that Hearst's right to
a fair trial has not been jeopar
dized by it is absurd; implicit in
Cronkite's very consideration of
a possible appeal is the assump
tion that she has already been
tried and found guilty.
Prospective jurors, as well as
the general public, are not likely
to come through a ceaseless bar
rage of such implications un
scathed.
The mass media has. in the
Hearst case, gone critically

beyond its responsibility to ac
curately convey news to the
public. In doing so, it has not
only trespassed upon the rights
of an individual, but has also
added confusion to an already
complex judicial situation.

I find it extremely difficult to
remember when I last read a
newspaper, viewed a televised
news show or listened to a radio
commentary which failed to
contain some mention of Pat
ricia Hearst.
Particularly during the time
since her recent capture, she has
undoubtedly commanded more
air time and newspaper cover
age than any other figure in the
public eye. The media's inces
sant treatment of her story has

rendered Hearst nothing less
than a unique new American
celebrity, and I would express
little surprise if Patty Hearst
T-shirts suddenly came into
vogue.
In view of the fact that kid
napings bank holdups and
murders are commonplace in
our society, I am initially puz
zled by the media's obsession
with Hearst. The appearance is
often that of deliberate inclusion
of her name even when there is
no real news to report.
Such items as "a ruling on
Patricia Hearst's mental compe
tency will not come for at least
two weeks ..." on a recent As
sociated Press release serve to
illustrate the point.
Childish fascination
Hearst's story, that of a weal
thy young girl kidnapped and
mysteriously transformed into a
violent revolutionary, is obvi
ously intriguing to the Ameri
can public.
Hence, media exploitation of
the sensationalism of the case is
a sufficient explanation for the
extreme coverage. Nevertheless,
I cannot help but feel that her
family background is the over
riding factor; an identical story
involving some obscure person
would hardly provoke such
widespread attention.

Whatever the actual reason,
my purpose here is not to deal
with it as such, but rather to
question the press' justification
for excessive coverage in light of
its legal implications. The
strong possibility that Patty will
soon be brought to trial raises
the issue of pre-trial publicity
and its influence on the judicial
process.
Pre-trial publicity.
In a recent CBS radio edito
rial, Walter Cronkite consi
dered these facts and reached
theconclusion that Hearst could
not possibly utilize pre-trial
publicity as grounds for a suc
cessful appeal. However, the al
ready overwhelming media
coverage of the Hearst case
leads me to believe otherwise.
