In an article on the debate
team (Daily, Oct. 9), l was cre
dited with attributing the debate
team's lack of success in the past
to poor coaching. Although the
debate squad has been ham
pered by poor coaching in its re
cent history, 1 had no intention
of implying that last year's
coach, Dan Meek, was included
in this category.
On the contrary. Meek was an
excellent, hardworking coach,
and we are indebted to him for
the guidance he has given the
debate team. Last year's mem
bers benefitted from, and en
joyed Meek's association with
the team, and we look forward
to his return in November.

Support boathouse
Editor:
We support the proposed fee
assessment for the renovation of
the Boathouse and the upgrad
ing of the surrounding facilities.
The Boathouse is owned by
the ASSU and has historically
been the center of activities at
the lake. The building itself has
been in deplorable disrepair for
years. But the student body can
change that.
Last year, new pilings were
installed to keep the building
standing. With ASSU financial
reserves and matching funds
from the Provost's office, the
Boathouse has been re-opened
as safe to the public.
With the passage of the fee as
sessment, the grounds can be
upgraded — a better beach,
sporting and picnicking
facilities, etc. All the work
would be performed by paid
student labor. But none of this
will be done unless the fee as
sessment passes.
The student body must de
monstrate its support of an im
proved Boathouse, which is the
purpose of the fee assessment
election. This vote will deter
mine whether the Boathouse
will remain an eyesore or be re
vived as the focal point of the
lake.

1 was interested in Terri
Macey's question, "For which
team does God root?" (Daily,
Oct. 9). As a football player who
participates in the prayer
gathering after the game, I
would like to answer her ques
tion.
Since 1 have come to know
Jesus Christ as my Lord and
Saviour, 1 have learned that He
does not take sides and is not
concerned with the final score of
the game, but rather He is con
cerned with my attitude as a
player. God's definition of win
ning is my putting 100 percent
effort into the game for His pur
pose.
The prayer gathering at the
end of the game is simply a time
to thank Jesus Christ for the op
portunity to play football for His
glory.

Since 1 have come to know
Jesus Christ as my Lord and
Saviour, 1 have learned that He
does not take sides and is not
concerned with the final score of
the game, but rather He is con
cerned with my attitude as a
player. God's definition of win
ning is my putting 100 percent
effort into the game for His pur
pose.
The prayer gathering at the
end of the game is simply a time
to thank Jesus Christ for the op
portunity to play football for His
glory.

Meek was helpful
Editor:
In an article on the debate
team (Daily, Oct. 9), l was cre
dited with attributing the debate
team's lack of success in the past
to poor coaching. Although the
debate squad has been ham
pered by poor coaching in its re
cent history, 1 had no intention
of implying that last year's
coach, Dan Meek, was included
in this category.
On the contrary. Meek was an
excellent, hardworking coach,
and we are indebted to him for
the guidance he has given the
debate team. Last year's mem
bers benefitted from, and en
joyed Meek's association with
the team, and we look forward
to his return in November.

Support boathouse
Editor:
We support the proposed fee
assessment for the renovation of
the Boathouse and the upgrad
ing of the surrounding facilities.
The Boathouse is owned by
the ASSU and has historically
been the center of activities at
the lake. The building itself has
been in deplorable disrepair for
years. But the student body can
change that.
Last year, new pilings were
installed to keep the building
standing. With ASSU financial
reserves and matching funds
from the Provost's office, the
Boathouse has been re-opened
as safe to the public.
With the passage of the fee as
sessment, the grounds can be
upgraded — a better beach,
sporting and picnicking
facilities, etc. All the work
would be performed by paid
student labor. But none of this
will be done unless the fee as
sessment passes.
The student body must de
monstrate its support of an im
proved Boathouse, which is the
purpose of the fee assessment
election. This vote will deter
mine whether the Boathouse
will remain an eyesore or be re
vived as the focal point of the
lake.
