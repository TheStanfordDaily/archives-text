Numerous issues will arise
during the coming year which
directly affect the lives of stu
dents and should not be resol
ved without substantial student
input. Although the ASSU Se
nate does not control the final
decisions of the administration,
our slate will use the forum and
resources of the Senate to lobby
more effectively in the students'
interest.
Backed by experience ac
quired through serving on Uni
versity committees and plan
ning major projects like the
Spring Festival and Interna
tional Women's Year Fair, we
will raise issues such as the fol
lowing:
Our slate has set two
priorities concerning the fiscal
crisis at Stanford: information
on budget affairs must be made
public and widely dissemi
nated, by beginning monthly
open meetings of the Budget
Priorities Commission (cur
rently closed to the public) to re
lease proposals and receive
community input; the Senate
should actively protect the con
structive advances of the'6os
from erosion credited to the fis
cal crisis.
A 1973 SWOPSI Task Force
on Education found that only 23
percent of Stanford under

graduates were satisfied with
student-faculty relations. This
situation stems from a system
which denies tenure and ad
vancement to professors who
emphasize teaching over re
search.
We will press the faculty and
administration to give more
weight to student evaluations of
teaching in the decisions of the
Appointments and Promotions
Committee.
This year we cannot afford an
inactive ASSU Senate.
Chris Suczek
1 am a graduate candidate for
ASSU Senate.
Your vote is important. The
more representative the Senate
is, the more influence it will
have with the administration. In
the past, few graduate students
have voted in ASSU elections:
let's do better this year.
My own main concerns are
about transportation, particu
larly bicycle safety and con
venience and the special prob
lems of co-terminal students
and those students returning to
college after several years away
from school.
Randy Bergerac
Kit WefcJ
Still hungry after lunch, dis
gusted with the classes you ch
ose? Dying for a pizza but have
no dough-. . . for a car? The

Weld-Bergerac team wants to
help you out.
Most of us are required to suf
fer through University Food
Service red tape, eat
questionable-quality food and
pay outrageous prices for our
meals. We intend to initiate a
senatorial committee to look
into the real possibilities of im
proving food service.
We would like to reduce the
costs and improve the efficiency
and quality by reorganizing the
food service system. We also in
tend to institute more flexible
and inexpensive meal plans.
In addition, no one has ques
tioned the fact that the ASSU
holds all house monies and does
not pay the houses the interest
made from house dues. It takes
an average of two weeks to
withdraw house monies from an
ASSU account and the proce
dure is unnecessarily compli
cated. Either the ASSU policy
needs changing or houses
should be free to put monies into
private banks for their own pro
fit and convenience.
Thirdly, we would like to look
into establishing a night pizza
delivery service â€” a project
which has been proven feasible
by a previous study.
Randy Bergerac is a member
of the Overseas Studies Commit
tee and Kit Weld is a member of
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau.
Please vote wisely. What you
eat, how much money your
house has and what courses you
take might depend on it.

Kevin L. McDermott
In three years, tuition has
soared from $2850 to $3850. But
while costs are increasing, stu
dents are receiving less. Many
more programs stand in the
path of the budget cutting ax as
the University eliminates a
$10 million deficit.
Lest students be forgetten or
ignored when budget priorities
are set, a student is needed who
understands the budget process
and University finances. Having
represented students on the
Trustee Committee on Finance
and Development. I'm ac
quainted with University
economics.
Last year, I chaired a special
committee to investigate tuition
and I hope to bring about more
of this committee's recom
mended changes. Furthermore,
while as a senator last year, I
served as chairman of the Fi
nance Committee of the ASSU.
My strongest qualification,
however, is that 1 realize that if
re-elected, 1 will serve to repre
sent the students.
Jim Reitzes
Joe Galgano
The campaign of Jim Reitzes
and Joe Galgano for election to
the ASSU Senate is based on a
willingness to work. Our talks
with people involved in last
year's Senate indicate that
many of the undergraduate rep
resentatives didn't even attend
the regular meetings of that

body. We want to be Senators;
this is no window-dressing for a
law school transcript.
Our immediate concern is
with basic student services, the
tangible benefits from ASSU.
We're canvassing students for
their opinions on how Tresidder
Union is run; should it be sub
sidized in order to make prices
more reasonable?
Perhaps a student-run Transi
tion and Store would be more
responsive to student budgeting
problems. How about more
money for the Speaker's
Bureau? Let's have more con
certs with less profit
consciousness and more quality
entertainment.
We can't pretend to know all
the answers to the housing di
lemma or cutbacks in various
departments. We can demand a
student representation in Board
of Trustees meetings, in order to
give students first hand infor
mation and an opportunity to
present student grievances di
rectly to the Board.
We can't do it alone. That's
why we're asking for student
views.
We are willing to work.
Brad Krevoy
I offer the following ideas not
as campaign promises, but as
premises which 1 will act upon if
elected.
Student advocacy: The stu
dent body has the right to have
its views become an integral

part of every important Univer
sity decision. The Senate is re
sponsible for exercising this
right, and should be prepared to
forcefully advocate student sen
timent before the administra
tion.
Communication: The best way
to influence the University is to
have as many students informed
as possible. That's why I'd like
to see one representative from
each campus residence act as a

liaison between the Senate anil
you.
Student services: Existing
student services should he ex
panded to include a mini-bus for
on and off campus students, a
pub at Tresidder, and alterna
tive methods for funding club
sports.
I'm looking forward to work
ing with the COP and working
for other students in improving
the effectiveness of our student
government.
Bill Doyle
The ASSU Senate, along with
the Council of Presidents, has
the responsibility of promoting
the collective interests of Stan
ford students against oft-times
competing interest groups
administration, faculty, alumni,
etc. Particularly at a time when
budget problems are forcing
cutbacks in various academic
and nonacademic programs
and services, the needs and de
sires of students must be heard.
I'd like to work as a senator to
give students a greater voice in
the development and implemen
tation of University policy, and
to confront problems of studenj
concern.
More specifically, the senate
should work to place a student
on the Board of Trustees, and to
expand services to off-campus
students, to name a few. Take a
moment this week, then, to vote
in a responsive senate with the
desire to fight for issues of stu
dent concern.
