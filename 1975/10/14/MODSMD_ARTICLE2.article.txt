# Frats to miss quota
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Preliminary figures indicate that
the fraternity system definitely will
not meet its University-assigned hous
ing quota, Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) President Bob Ottilie said yes
terday.
Ottilie predicted that the frats fi
nally will fall 10 to 12 spaces below
the 250 total membership required by
the University. The official deadline
for meeting the quota passed Friday.
Exactly how far under the quota the
13 campus fraternities end up will be
announced "by the end of the week,"
Row director Norm Robinson said.
Robinson explained that he had to
"sift through" and cross-check the
membership figures to verify their ac
curacy.
He guessed that the frats would be
only five to seven spots under the
mini mu m.
Nevertheless, the fraternities' fai
lure to meet the quota will probably
draw individual house warnings from

the housing office.
Should the system not fulfill the
minimum requirement next year, the
house with the largest percentage of
unfilled spots would tentatively be re
quired to enter the University draw
system and give up its independence
at least temporarily.
Ottilie suggested that Delta Kappa
Epsilon (Dekes) would probably be
"the first house to go." Delta Kappa
Epsilon stands at 8.5 spots below its
house quota.
The fraternities, meanwhile, have
formed a "preliminary rush commit
tee" to examine the quota problem
and begin formulating a long-term
solution, he said. The committee's
first meeting is Thursday.
Sigma Chi junior Tim Ferguson will
head the panel, consisting of one rep
resentative from each frat, Ottilie ad
ded. Eventually, the committee will
meet with University officials and
fraternity alumni as a liaison, he said.
