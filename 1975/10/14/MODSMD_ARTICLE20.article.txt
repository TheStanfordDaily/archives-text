## Grab your board It's sidewalk surfing again 
### KATHY BATTS 
Back in the mid-60s a lot of
little kids began imitating on the
sidewalks what their big
brothers and sisters were doing
at the beaches, dr wishing they
were doing if they weren't lucky
enough to live in California or
Hawaii. And just as the
Beachboys canonized surfing
with their music, Jan and Dean
glorified skateboarding with
their classic "Sidewalk Surf
ing."
A few freshmen in Branner
Hall remember that fad from
elementary school days. They
claim its becoming all the rage
again, only bigger and bettor
than before.
"It's really catching on up
here," says freshman John Con
nolly. "I think it's going to be
bigger than it was in the 605."
When freshman Tom Ben
ninger left I,as Vegas last month
to start his Stanford career, he
just naturally packed his
skateboard. Connolly, also from
Las Vegas, bought one soon after
his arrival here.
"It's so much better than
bicycling to class," Connolly
claims. "Skateboards travel al
most as fast as bicycles and you
save time not having to lock up
the bike. 1 can just carry my
board right into class."
"Skateboards are safer than
bikes, too," Benninger chimes
in. "They've got a lot more man
euverability. If you're about to
crash, you can just jump off."
Although cross-country
skateboarding may never catch

on, Connolly says he has gone as
far as downtown Palo Alto on
his board. "I made it from City
Hall to Branner in 14 minutes,"
he says.
Some aficionados go in for
shorter distance traveling. Con
nolly's roommate, Finlay
Waugh rides around his room
for study breaks.
Benninger says there are
about 10 other freshman in
Branner that have taker up
skateboarding again. "There
are a lot more that are still shop
ping around for boards," he
adds.
"Our sales have increased
about 1000 percent over last
year," estimates Bill Johnston,

store manager of Bayshore Bike
Works and Sport Center. "We
can't keep them (skateboards) in
stock. We just keep running
out."
Johnston says his store is sel
ling about 10 boards a week.
Thesport has almost spawned
a cult, complete witti customiz
ing fanatics. There are special
boards one can buy, certain
brands of wheels and trucks
(wheel mounts) and particular
methods to caring for the
boards' ballbearings.
Both Connolly and Benninger
claim that Bahne boards are the
best. Johnston says he has had
Bahne on backorder for three
weeks, but adds that Hang Ten

is also a popular brand.
Serious skateboarders buy
components rather than com
plete boards. Names such as
Cadillac and Stoker wheels or
Excalibur trucks are a part of
the cult. Johnston says he sells a
lot more parts than complete
boards.
There are both stiff and flexi
ble boards available, depending
upon the type of riding one
plans on doing. The stiffer
boards are best for doing tricks,
while the flexible boards are
good for sharp turns. A good
compromise between the two
styles, says Benninger, is the
"Rigiflex" board, which is built
similar to a ski (fiberglass
covered ash wood).
Skateboard prices have
changed, of course, with their
popularity. That $6-10 board
you may have had when you
were 10 years old would now
average $36. Johnston says his
cheapest board costs $21. He
adds that an enthusiasic fan
could easily spend $100 on a
completely customized board.
The fad already has its own
Skateboard Magazine and Hang
Ten now makes tee-shirts with
little silkscreen skateboards.
Although sidewalk surfers
say they are still getting weird
looks from people they pass on
the way to class, they predict the
fad will catch on for good this
time.
"It takes up where surfing left
off," Waugh says."And look
how long that's lasted."
