Somewhere there must be
printed an analysis of Don Mc-
Lean's "American Pie." Could
you dig up a complete cast of
characters and events for the
song? I know a few keys. The
levee referred to in the line "I
drove my Chevy to the levee/But
the levee was dry" is supposedly
the place where (wo slain civil
rights workers were found in the
early 19605. "The flames
climbed high into the night/To
light the sacrificial rite" has
been said to be the ball of fire that

emerged when the plane carry
ing ruck star Muddy Holly
crashed. The "widowed bride" I
heard was Jacqueline Kennedy;
The King - Elvin Presley; the
Queen - Janis Joplin; the quar
tet — the Beatles; the jester -
Boh Dylan. But who are the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
etc.? -H.B.
There were several analyses
of "American Pie" at the time it
came out. but the best one, in my
opinion, appeared in, believe it
or not, the Stanford Daily. It was
written by Barry Wood, a
graduate student in English and
Humanities,on (an. 2H, 1972.
The song's question, Wood as
serts, is obviously when rock
music died. It might have been
in February, 1959 ("February
made me shiver/With every
paper I deliver"), when the
plane carrying Buddy Holly,
Richie Valens and the Big Bop
per crashed. Or perhaps it was
in 1963 when John Kennedy was
assassinated ("I don't remember
if I cried/When I read about his
widowd bride").
Another possibility is 1967,
when Bob Dylan had his motor
cycle accident ("The jester on
the sidelines in a cast"). That
same year the Beatles produced

Sergeant Pepper's Lonely-hearts
Club Band ("The sergeants
played a marching tune"), an
album which Wood considers
part ofthe music's decay, since it
could not be reproduced before
a live audience without a mill
ion dollars of equipment.
Or perhaps the music died
when the Rolling Stones hired
the Hell's Angels at Altamont
("moss grows fat on a rolling
stone"), or when Spiro Agnew
attacked rock music for corrupt
ing youth ("As I watched him on
the stage/My hands were
clenched in fists of rage/No
angel born in hell/Could break
that Satan's spell").
In any case, the music died
sometime, and with it the whole
'60s' culture, says Wood. This
song then says goodbye to the
Great Society, the New Frontier
and the New Prosperity. And it
is a farewell to the heroes of the
'60s — John Kennedy, Martin
Luther King and Robert Ken
nedy — who, for Wood, are the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
"This is the New Age," Wood
says. "Mere musicians are out of
date, just as mere soldiers are
obsolete, in a computerized air
warover Asian jungles. Theend
of music is the end of Man."

of "American Pie" at the time it
came out. but the best one, in my
opinion, appeared in, believe it
or not, the Stanford Daily. It was
written by Barry Wood, a
graduate student in English and
Humanities,on (an. 2H, 1972.
The song's question, Wood as
serts, is obviously when rock
music died. It might have been
in February, 1959 ("February
made me shiver/With every
paper I deliver"), when the
plane carrying Buddy Holly,
Richie Valens and the Big Bop
per crashed. Or perhaps it was
in 1963 when John Kennedy was
assassinated ("I don't remember
if I cried/When I read about his
widowd bride").
Another possibility is 1967,
when Bob Dylan had his motor
cycle accident ("The jester on
the sidelines in a cast"). That
same year the Beatles produced

Sergeant Pepper's Lonely-hearts
Club Band ("The sergeants
played a marching tune"), an
album which Wood considers
part ofthe music's decay, since it
could not be reproduced before
a live audience without a mill
ion dollars of equipment.
Or perhaps the music died
when the Rolling Stones hired
the Hell's Angels at Altamont
("moss grows fat on a rolling
stone"), or when Spiro Agnew
attacked rock music for corrupt
ing youth ("As I watched him on
the stage/My hands were
clenched in fists of rage/No
angel born in hell/Could break
that Satan's spell").
In any case, the music died
sometime, and with it the whole
'60s' culture, says Wood. This
song then says goodbye to the
Great Society, the New Frontier
and the New Prosperity. And it
is a farewell to the heroes of the
'60s — John Kennedy, Martin
Luther King and Robert Ken
nedy — who, for Wood, are the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
"This is the New Age," Wood
says. "Mere musicians are out of
date, just as mere soldiers are
obsolete, in a computerized air
warover Asian jungles. Theend
of music is the end of Man."


Somewhere there must be
printed an analysis of Don Mc-
Lean's "American Pie." Could
you dig up a complete cast of
characters and events for the
song? I know a few keys. The
levee referred to in the line "I
drove my Chevy to the levee/But
the levee was dry" is supposedly
the place where (wo slain civil
rights workers were found in the
early 19605. "The flames
climbed high into the night/To
light the sacrificial rite" has
been said to be the ball of fire that

emerged when the plane carry
ing ruck star Muddy Holly
crashed. The "widowed bride" I
heard was Jacqueline Kennedy;
The King - Elvin Presley; the
Queen - Janis Joplin; the quar
tet — the Beatles; the jester -
Boh Dylan. But who are the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
etc.? -H.B.
