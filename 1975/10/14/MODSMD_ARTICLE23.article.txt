EXTON. Pa. (AP) â€” Susan
Schell is running a daringly dif
ferent campaign for a court job
by walking the streets in short
shorts and halter, and putting
up posters that show her skim
pily clad.
The 2 3-year-old Chester
County Democrat complains
that the posters come down al
most as fast as she gets them
nailed on poles or pasted on
walls.
"I'm told they're collector's
items," she says, "but it still
makes me mad. 1 put a half
gallon of glue on some and they

still take them."
The idea of a pin-up poster
came from her husband, Jacob, a
builder and unsuccessful can
didate for Congress a year ago.
"He felt that I'd have a chance
of winning if I had enough expo
sure," smiles Scholl, admitting
she has an uphill in this
suburban Philadelphia county,
which has a 3-2 Republican
edge.
It was the COP dominance
over half a century that promp
ted her to toss in the fancy som
brero she wears in her poster
picture.

"I think that the party in
power for a long time without
competition tends to become
complacent," she says. "They
don't do their best."
The job she seeks is that of
secretary or clerk to the Court of
Common Pleas, the keeper of re
cords, with an annual salary of
$17,500.
It's something I'm familiar
with." says Schell. She does the
bookkeeping for her husband's
business and is corporate sec
retary and office manager of a
center that houses 15 different
firms.
