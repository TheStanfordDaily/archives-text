## Science fiction invades Stanford 
### DANA GIOIA 
l.ilgit is .1 magazine ot science
Ik lion and fantasy published by
Stanford students. It contains
fiction, artwork, comics and an
interview and soils at the nearly
unbelievable price of 25 cents. It
is available at the Stanford
Bookstore and several other
newsstands.
As one would expect of a stu
dent publication, the contents
are of uneven quality. But at
Stanford such visible efforts of
student writers are so rare that a
hearty congratulation is due
simply for producing a
magazine at all.

Except for the steadfast ap
pearances of Sequoia almost no
student writing ever sees the
light of publication. Edge is
especially welcome since it fills
a large gap in the sort of writing
that can appear.
Technique lacking
There are three stories in this
issue of Edge. All are fairly in
teresting but none is especially
good. All of them contain good
ideas, but none of the writers
had sufficient technique to turn
their ideas into successfully
written stories. As beginning
writers often do, th.y tried to
put too much materi d into a

•small structure.
The best story in the magazine
is George Cole's "The Haunting
of the King," a fantasy tale a In
Connn set in a pre-Christian,
Norse kingdom. With remarka
ble condensation Cole manages
to describe an unscrupulous
bastard son's attempt to usurp
bis father's crown in about 10
pages.
The plot is interesting and
well-structured (as well as very
Shakespearean in many details)
and the story moves towards an
exciting, albeit histrionic close.
Unfortunately, the author's dic
tion is too full of clumsy "ye's,"
"thou's" and other archaisms
that prevent the story from
being completely successful.
Future condensed
"Probability," by Peter Ale
shire, is a sprawling, undiscip
lined story centered around an
interesting prediction of the fu
ture. If Aleshire had not tried to
cram centuries of future history
into 10 pages, the story would
have been much better.
As it stands "Probability" is
an unsatisfying account of the
distant future when the human
factor in important-political de
cisions has been replaced by
computerized, quantitative

analysis.
"The Burgerßlues," by James
Buser.reads more like a National
Lampoon parody than a short
storv. Buser's account ofthegas
tronomic tragedies of the hip
pies of tomorrow begins promis
ingly but ultimately lacks both
tension and finish.
Like the other writers in this
issue Buser lacks the essential
sense of form necessary to con
trol his stories. Perhaps a care
ful study of a few masterpieces
of the genre would give them
greater insight into the craft of
their art.
The best thing in Edge is an

engrossing interview with the
novelist, Robert Silverberg, one
of the deans of contemporary
science fiction. Silverberg per
suasively complains of the liter
ary establishment's neglect of
sciffnce fiction.
He also provides some very
interesting comparisons bet
ween the way "serious"
novelists like Barth or Pynchon
and modern science fiction
writers deal with the same
material. Silverberg's com
ments should prove interesting
to both camps of readers.
Expansion helpful
Edge might have been a better
magazine if Silverberg's inter
view had been extended to re
place some of the weaker mate
rial in the issue. Although that
decision might have excluded
some student work, the remain
ing material would have been
displayed to better advantage.
Surprisingly enough, one of
the comics in Edge is as good as
any of the fiction. Philip Wa
dler's brief section of "Robot 1"
uses its very limited means to
accomplish more than the prose
writers did in their more elabo
rate medium.
The excerpt in this issue was
too short to say much about it,

but the strip is well-drawn and
well-conceived.
Edge is a long overdue addi
tion to Stanford's literary scene.
At its price there is no excuse for
the science-fiction buff not to
buy a copy. And at just under
thirty heavily-illustrated pages
it is the perfect length to fill a
study break.
