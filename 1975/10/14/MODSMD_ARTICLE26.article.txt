### RICHARD CROSS 
A small but attentive audi

noon to hear an organ recital by
Sandra Soderlund in Din
kelspiel Auditorium. Ms. Soder
lund s program featured works
for the organ from the 16th,
17 th, 18th and 20th centuries by
C.P.E. Bach, J.S. Bach, Cavaz

Paumann, Pellegrini, Shackel

Christ lag in Todestxinden by
Hermann Schroeder, a 20th
century composer, and the Toc
cata, Adagio and Fugue in C

Bach. The first piece was
worked out with energy and
sound technique clear through

interpretation was exciting and

Fugue, though marred by some
mistakes in technique and an
occasional lack of unity in the
phrasing, was also exciting and
well-conceived.
Passages were phrased with
considerable style and beauty

touch.

lovely second movement in
which the basje line of a theme in
the pedals and the alto part of it
in the keyboard were subtly and
hauntingly intertwined.
Merulo's Toccata (16-century)
consisted of a single stately
theme developed at one
