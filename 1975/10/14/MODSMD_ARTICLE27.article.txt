# Garcia's debut welcomed
## 
### BEN DICKINSON 
Jerry Garcia, lead guitarist for the Grateful Dead and one of San
Francisco's most well-known rock musicians in his own right,
unveiled his new band — named simply the Jerry Garcia Band —
at DeAnza College's Flint Center last Friday night.
Although the audience was unmistakably loyal to the Grateful
Dead, sporting dozens of cowboy hats, spaced gazes and Ameri
can Beauty album patches in acknowledgement, a highly vocal
majority of them left the concert thoroughly convinced that Jerry
was still playing excellent music with equally excellent musi
cians.
The evening began rather inauspiciously; a fairly restive crowd
waited three quarters of an hour longer than expected for Garcia's
band to begin their maiden performance, but they immediately
forgave the band when the music began.
As soon as Garcia started singing the first song, cheers nearly
drowned out the music; this occurred frequently throughout the
whole show. Despite the almost overly-appreciative crowd, the
band played as if they were out to prove their abilities the entire
time.
The opening song set the mood for the rest of the show; it was
slow and deliberate, showing a large amount of jazz and blues
influence. Garcia's guitar talents were showcased early with two
lengthy and inspired solos.
Nicky Hopkins did a magnificent job at the piano all night; he
played a few good solos of his own and backed Jerry's leads
smoothly and tastefully. He and Garcia also played off each other
very impressively a couple of times, indicating a fantastic amount

of musical compatibility and communication.
Nicky was largely unappreciated by the Garcia-oriented audi
ence, but will receive more acclaim in other cities less steeped in
Grateful Dead tradition — his only low point was his attempt to
sing a song near the end of the second set; the vocals in the song
were poorly balanced, but no adjustment could have salvaged his
uneven, self-conscious singing style.
The remaining two members of thegroup are Ron 1 utt on drums
and John Kahn on bass guitar. These two did relatively little out of
the ordinary but like Nicky, they backed up Garcia very well.
Kahn remained rooted to a spot in front of his amplifier and very
close to the drums, and apparently this style contributed to the
extreme tightness of the rhythm section. John and Ron were very
unobtrusive throughout the performance, except on one or two
occasions when Tutt cut loose with some exciting drum parts.
Perhaps the most irritating part of the concert was the break
between sets; usually 15 minutes is considered to be about as long
a break as should be taken. Garcia, however, took 45 minutes
between sets, breaking the mood and continuity of the concert and
leading some people to take a snooze between shows. Again,
however, as soon as the band returned, the crowd roared in for
giveness.
The main weakness seemed to be the lack of some more raucous
tunes to break up the deliberate mood set by the overwhelming
majority of the selections. One song was so slow, in fact, that the
crowd thought it had ended three times before it finally did.
Laid-back concerts aren't bad, they just need some punctuation.
