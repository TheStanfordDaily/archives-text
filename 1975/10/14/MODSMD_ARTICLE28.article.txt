dynamic level in the manner of a

The sound of the Dinkelspiel
organ does not nearly fill the
auditorium; rather, it comes di
â€¢ rectly at the listener from the in
strument itself. As a result, the
organist's problem of mixing the
tones that reflect off the walls is
less important than the quality
of his technique.
Soderlund's technique
appeared to lapse at times:
chords were not always clear
when first struck and running
passages were sometimes mud
dled. Where the articulation suf
fered, the rhythm did too.
Organ dictates choice
Soderlund's program
selections reflected the special
qualities and limitations of the
Dinkelspiel organ. The instru
ment, which weighs six tons and
can be rolled on and off the

stage, is extremely small com
pared to the Memorial Church
organ.
It does not project nearly as
much sound as the church or
gan, nor does it have as many
stops (which control the tone of
the pipes). Consequently, it does
not afford as wide a variety in
registration (the technique of
selecting and combining stops)
as the church organ does.
Soderlund therefore
chose early works, which, be
cause of the limitations of the
Baroque organ, have a smaller
variation in registration than
later works of the late-Classical
and Romantic periods. Works
from the modern period were
selected according to the same
criterion.
On the other hand, the Din
kelspiel organ articulates notes
in a different way than the organ
in the Memorial Church. The

former instrument produces
what Soderlund described
as a "chiff" sound at the begin
ning of each note, whereas the
latter does not. In the playing of

early works, this characteristic
is especially desirable, since it
resembles the sound produced
by Baroque and pre-Baroque
organs.
