Israeli cargo to go down canal
JERUSALEM — A foreign-registered freighter will
steam from an Israeli port next week in the first attempt to
ferry Israeli cargo down the Suez Canal since 1956, gov
ernment officials said yesterday.
They did not disclose what flag the vessel would be
flying but said it would not be an Israeli ship and the
cargo would be non-military.
The ship is to disembark from one of Israel's Mediter
ranean ports — either Haif or Ashdod — and sail through
the Suez waterway bound for an East African harbor,
officials said. The navigational route away from Israel
was intentional, they said, in order to assure the Egyp
tians that the freighter was carrying only non-military
cargo.
Chou En-lai ailing in Peking
TOKYO — Chou En-lai, architect of Chinese-American
rapprochement, lies ill, perhaps critically, in a Peking
hospital and probably will not receive his old partner in
detente, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, during Kis
singer's Oct. 19-23 China visit.
Stricken with heart disease in the spring of 1974, the
charismatic and once tireless Chinese premier has been
barred for nearly a month from seeing foreign visitors.
In the nearly 11 months since Kissinger's last China
visit, Chou has put the Chinese administrative house in
order, thus insuring a smooth transition in the event of
bis death orfu rther incapacity. Should First Vice Premier
Teng Hsiao-ping become premier, as now expected, he
would have a full quota of 11 vice-premiers and 29 minis
ters in all posts to help him.
Ford approves Sinai resolution
WAS!IINCTON — President Ford yesterday.signed the
resolution by Congress authorizing the manning of early
warning stations in the Sinai by American civilians.
The Americans who will man the Sinai stations are not
expected to be flown to the Middle East until February.
Their number is expected to total 200.
Ford said participation by U.S. civilians in the warning
network demonstrates a determination to continue what
he described as,two years of "vigorous diplomatic efforts
to promote the prospects of peace."

Domestic intelligence for CIA
WASHINGTON — The National Security Agency pro
vided theCIA with "at least 1100 and undoubtably more"
summaries of telephone and telegraph communications
involving anti-war activists and other dissidents, in
formed sources said yesterday.
The communications — intercepted over "a two- or
three-year period" during the first Nixon administration
— detailed the foreign travels and organizing efforts of
various groups, sources said.
The summaries were transmitted via courier from NSA
headquarters to Richard Ober, the official in charge of the
ClA's Operation CHAOS which monitored the activities
of political dissidents, the sources said.
A separate source said similar summaries went to
other agencies, such as the FBI and the Defense Intelli
gence Agency, but was unable to say how many com
munications went to these recipients.
Economic conference opens
PARIS — "Interdependence," "compromise" and
"conciliation" were terms used repeatedly by delegates
from industrialized and developing nations yesterday in
opening a meeting seeking a new international economic
relationship.
Delegates from both sides privately expressed confi
dence that the bitter deadlock which ended last April's
meeting was a thing of the past.
The meeting is expected to recommend that a larger
ministerial conference in December establish four 15-
member commissions to discuss energy, raw materials,
development and financial matters.

Economic conference opens
PARIS — "Interdependence," "compromise" and
"conciliation" were terms used repeatedly by delegates
from industrialized and developing nations yesterday in

meeting was a thing of the past.
The meeting is expected to recommend that a larger
ministerial conference in December establish four 15-
member commissions to discuss energy, raw materials,
development and financial matters.

Israeli cargo to go down canal
JERUSALEM — A foreign-registered freighter will
steam from an Israeli port next week in the first attempt to
ferry Israeli cargo down the Suez Canal since 1956, gov
ernment officials said yesterday.
They did not disclose what flag the vessel would be
flying but said it would not be an Israeli ship and the
cargo would be non-military.
The ship is to disembark from one of Israel's Mediter
ranean ports — either Haif or Ashdod — and sail through
the Suez waterway bound for an East African harbor,
officials said. The navigational route away from Israel
was intentional, they said, in order to assure the Egyp
tians that the freighter was carrying only non-military
cargo.
Chou En-lai ailing in Peking
TOKYO — Chou En-lai, architect of Chinese-American
rapprochement, lies ill, perhaps critically, in a Peking
hospital and probably will not receive his old partner in
detente, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, during Kis
singer's Oct. 19-23 China visit.
Stricken with heart disease in the spring of 1974, the
charismatic and once tireless Chinese premier has been
barred for nearly a month from seeing foreign visitors.
In the nearly 11 months since Kissinger's last China
visit, Chou has put the Chinese administrative house in
order, thus insuring a smooth transition in the event of
bis death orfu rther incapacity. Should First Vice Premier
Teng Hsiao-ping become premier, as now expected, he
would have a full quota of 11 vice-premiers and 29 minis
ters in all posts to help him.
Ford approves Sinai resolution
WAS!IINCTON — President Ford yesterday.signed the
resolution by Congress authorizing the manning of early
warning stations in the Sinai by American civilians.
The Americans who will man the Sinai stations are not
expected to be flown to the Middle East until February.

Ford said participation by U.S. civilians in the warning
network demonstrates a determination to continue what
he described as,two years of "vigorous diplomatic efforts
to promote the prospects of peace."

Domestic intelligence for CIA
WASHINGTON — The National Security Agency pro

The communications — intercepted over "a two- or
three-year period" during the first Nixon administration
— detailed the foreign travels and organizing efforts of
various groups, sources said.
