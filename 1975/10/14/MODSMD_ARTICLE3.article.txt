## More women profs in nation says study 
### BLAKE HALLANAN 
The number of full women profes
sors at Stanford has decreased in the
past two years, although a national
survey shows the proportion of
women among American college and
university professors has inched up
ward to 21 percent.
There were a total of 544 men full
professors on campus and 14 women
professors. By June, 1975 there was an
increase of 12 male professors, total
ling 556, while there was a decrease of
three in the number of women profes
sors.
According to the survey, which was
conducted by Profs. Everett Carll
Ladd Jr. of the University of
Connecticut-Stors and Seymour Mar
tin Lipset of Stanford, women com
prised 19 percent of the professoriate
in 1969 and 20 percent in 1973. At the
same time, while 34 percent of the
male faculty nationally are full pro
fessors, 1H percent of the women are at
this level.
Nearly one third of all full-time fa
culty under age3o are women, but as a
group, they occupy a status similar to
theirs in 1969:
—they spend more of their time teach
ing than men;
—they earn less than men;
—they publish less, exhibit less in
terest in research and receive less
support for research; and

—they show a "striking pattern of
segregation" in terms of their rank,
where they teach and what they teach.
The Ladd-Lipset survey, made pos
sible by grants from The National In
stitute of Education and the Spencer
Foundation, was instituted in March,
1975. Questionaires were mailed to a
elected sample of 7800 faculty mem
bers at 111 United States institutions.
Berkeley, Santa Cruz, Davis and Stan
ford were among the California cam
puses selected.
The survey also reported that
women constitute only five percent of
all faculty members in the natural sci
ences at major universities and that
they are half of all academics teaching
at lower-status institutions in a cluster
of disciplines that have been consi
dered "women's fields" — education,
nursing, child development and home
economics.
In reaction to the survey, Sandra
Bern, assistant professor of psychol
ogy, reported that Stanford began its
efforts to hire women the same time as
the economic crunch struck. Stanford
hired a number of junior (untenured)
women in these efforts.

In reaction to the survey, Sandra
Bern, assistant professor of psychol
ogy, reported that Stanford began its
efforts to hire women the same time as
the economic crunch struck. Stanford
hired a number of junior (untenured)
women in these efforts.
The number of full women profes
sors at Stanford has decreased in the
past two years, although a national
survey shows the proportion of
women among American college and
university professors has inched up
ward to 21 percent.
There were a total of 544 men full
professors on campus and 14 women
professors. By June, 1975 there was an
increase of 12 male professors, total
ling 556, while there was a decrease of
three in the number of women profes
sors.
According to the survey, which was
conducted by Profs. Everett Carll
Ladd Jr. of the University of
Connecticut-Stors and Seymour Mar
tin Lipset of Stanford, women com
prised 19 percent of the professoriate
in 1969 and 20 percent in 1973. At the
same time, while 34 percent of the
male faculty nationally are full pro
fessors, 1H percent of the women are at
this level.
Nearly one third of all full-time fa
culty under age3o are women, but as a
group, they occupy a status similar to
theirs in 1969:
—they spend more of their time teach
ing than men;
—they earn less than men;
—they publish less, exhibit less in
terest in research and receive less
support for research; and

—they show a "striking pattern of
segregation" in terms of their rank,
where they teach and what they teach.
The Ladd-Lipset survey, made pos
sible by grants from The National In
stitute of Education and the Spencer
Foundation, was instituted in March,
1975. Questionaires were mailed to a
elected sample of 7800 faculty mem
bers at 111 United States institutions.
Berkeley, Santa Cruz, Davis and Stan
ford were among the California cam
puses selected.
The survey also reported that
women constitute only five percent of
all faculty members in the natural sci
ences at major universities and that
they are half of all academics teaching
at lower-status institutions in a cluster
of disciplines that have been consi
dered "women's fields" — education,
nursing, child development and home
economics.
