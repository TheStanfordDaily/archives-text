The Ai>SU Council of Presidents
(COP) opposes the Bonfire held annu
ally in the dry bed of Lake Lagunita
before the "Big Game" against
California. However, the COP has no
plans to prevent it, according to ASSU
Vice President Josie jaramillo.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum

said he objects to previous University
funding of the Bonfire and the adverse
effects of the Bonfire on the environ
ment.
"In view of recent budget cuts it
(University funding) seems to be to
tally unjust when cutting other prog
rams and departments," Rosenbaum
said.

University Relations and the Athle
tic Department each contributed $200
to the Inter-Fraternity Council (IPC)
last year. However, Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs, said the University would
probably not contribute funds to the
Bonfire this year due to the financial
situation of the University.

IPC President Bob Ottilie said the
council nevertheless plans to go
ahead with the Bonfire. The frater
nities plan to raise money for it and
hope to receive private contributions
from alumni fortheevent.Ottiliesaid.
He said the IPC will also solicit
funds from the ASSU Senate. Last
year's Senate rejected a request for
$75 for the Bonfire.
Rosenbaum also criticized last
year's Bonfire because the ashes left
on the lake prompted algae growth. "I
believe it's a stupid waste of re
sources, adversely affecting other re
sources," Rosenbaum stated. "The
scum that came about last year formed
a ring around the lake."
Jaramillo added that the COP is try
ing to make the Bonfire organizers
aware of their responsibility to clean
up the lake after the fire.
The Bonfire has been held only once
in the past three years (last year) due
to rain, the resulting wetness of the
lake and lack of interest. Last year
students objected to the effects of the
smoke and ashes on the environment,
but the Bonfire went ahead as
scheduled.
The Bonfire is largely an event for
Stanford alumni, according to Tom
Newell, director of the Alumni As
sociation
"Alumni enjoy seeing traditional
events continue to occur. They would
probably be moderately disappointed
if it were not held," he stated.


BURNING MADâ€” The ASSI' Council of Presidents has
