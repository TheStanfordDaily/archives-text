# Fewer ASSU candidates this year
## Elections to begin Wednesday 
### JACK VAUGHN 
Students will decide between sev
eral approaches to student govern
ment in the ASSU Senate election to
morrow and Thursday.
Some 67 candidates, 53 under
graduates and 14 graduates, have
been campaigning on platforms vari
ously promising "action," "new di
rections," "responsibility," 'budget
reform," "clear voices," "accessibil
ity," "regular attendance" at Senate
meetings and the "return of the Indian
as Stanford's symbol."
Last year, 84 students competed for
the 20 positions, equally divided bet
ween graduates and undergraduates.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Mike Murray called the high number
of candidates last year "a surprise
turnout."

"This year is closer to the usual
number," he said. "People are realiz
ing that there are other ways of getting
into law school than being in the Se
nate," he speculated.
Computer cards
The voting will be done on compu
ter cards, Murray said. "The proce
dure will be the same as in last
spring's election."
He added that computer program
ming problems, which delayed vote
counting in lastyear'sCouncilofPres
idents primary election have been
worked out. "The bugs have been un
bugged," he said.
Murray and his three-person elec
tion commission picked workers to
handle the individual polling places
and put them through what he called
"an intensive training session." He

said he expects no difficulties because
of his "very well-organized staff."
Candidates have an individual
spending limit of $50, said Murray.
Spending is accounted for by "a fee
voucher form giving a list of ex
penses" which must be submitted
within three weeks of the election, he
explained.
Possible disqualification
Murray said that a winner who vio
lated the spending limit could be dis
qualified, in which case "the candi
date with the next highest number of
votes would be elected."
Other potential violations of elec
tion rules, according to the ASSU Se
nate By-laws, include posting signs in
forbidden areas and campaigning too
close to the polls. In either case, the
severity of the act and the punishment
will be decided by the elections com
mission. Murray said.
Murray reported he knew of no
election rule violations this year, but
added that "we (the Commission)
aren't going to become a policing
force, investigating constantly for vio
lations."
Winners will take office at the first
Senate meeting, called by ASSU Pres
ident Lee Rosenbaum after the votes
are in, according to Mary Taxiera,
secretary of the Senate. However, the
results will not be final until "we get
returns from the overseas campuses."
Murray cautioned. These ballots
"sometimes change things," he ad
ded.
Rosenbaum, last year's Senate
Chairman, declined to give a list of
issues facing this year's body. "The
Senate pretty much defines its own."
he said. "Some slates are interested in
student services, while others are
more concerned with University-wide
policy."
Rosenbaum added that he felt "last
year's Senate was the best I've ever
seen." He said he was "hopeful this
year's will be even better."
"It depends on what they define the
issues to be," he said. "If they just
want to run the ASSU. they will have a
lot of power. If they want to try to
influence University policy as a stu
dents' voice, they will find they have
very little power."
Polling places will be open tomor
row and Thursday between 10 a.m.
and 4 p.m. at the Post Office and en
gineering corner, and between 10 a.m.
and 2 p.m. at the history corner. Medi
cal School, Physics Tank and Busi
ness School. Murray said.
