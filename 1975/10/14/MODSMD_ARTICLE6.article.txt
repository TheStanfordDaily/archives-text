# New planner takes charge
## 
### RON SEGE 
Philip Williams has been named the
new director of the planning office,
following the early retirement of
former director Harry Sanders.
Williams, formerly a planning and
design consultant, in Houston, Texas,
sees his new job as being "involved
with campus planning" and also as a
liaison between Stanford's planning
department and the surrounding
community. He is involved with both
the planning of future construction
and the day-to-day updating of what
he calls the "official master plan" of

the campus.
As planning director, Williams is
responsible for the future building
projects already announced, as well
as other campus improvements. When
asked about the possibility of building
new dormitories on campus, Williams
said "that is being discussed now, and
funding is being looked at. We don't
have a site picked, or a number of
beds, but it is definitely in the talking
stage."
Parking space inventory
Discussing the parking situation,
Williams said "over the whole cam
pus there is a sufficient number of
parking spaces." He further addd,
"we are beginning to inventory the
spaces and how they are being used."
He noted that shuttle buses are a pos
sibility which will be investigated.
Williams said that he plans to spend
a generous amount of time out about
his new job, so that he can "figure out
what to do" as planning director.
"We are having a nice transitional
period," says Wlliams, mainly due to
the fact that previous director Harry
Sanders is staying on for about one
year â€” to assist Williams and later to
work on a book concerning planning
at Stanford.
Advisory capacity
His calender is full of meetings,
explained Williams to help him "fi
gure out the priorities so that I could
make decisions; I think the challenge
in any job is to try to make it an initia
tive job. You try to keep one jump
ahead and decide what needs to be
decided next, rather than reacting to
what comes."
Besides making decisions, Williams
feels that he and his department are
"largely responsible in an advisory
capacity." "A lot of decisions are
made here, and a lot are taken higher

up, but this office is responsible for
professional advice and counsel."
Having worked extensively with
college planning in the past, Williams
feels that a university is "far more
democratic than almost any other soc
iety" and that "Stanford is particu
larly democratic." What this means,
according to Williams, is that "the
price you pay for all that input is
time."
Williams has had over 17 years of
experience in planning. He previously
worked for an engineering firm which
did consulting work for Ohio State
and the University of Nebraska.
Williams is married and has three
children.
