# Physicians to receive extensions
## 
### 
Fifty community physicians, sus
pended last week by Stanford Hospi
tal for failing to comply with the hos
pital's new by-laws on malpractice in
surance, have been given an extension
until Oct. 30 to meet the new stan
dards.
The physicians were suspended be
cause the hospital had been informed
by its insurance carrier that if unin
sured doctors practiced there ap
proximately $400,000 more would be
charged for the hospital's premiums
between Nov. 1 and Jan 1. The hospi
tal's insurance rate is currently about
$2.4 million. The hospital said the in
crease in premiums over the next
three months would have raised room
rates.
The effective date of the suspen
sions was changed and extended due
to the requests of several physicians,
according to Dr. Clayton Rich, vice
president for medical affairs and dean
of the School of Medicine.
"In addition, the hospital has now
been informed that a failure on its part
to enforce these requirements will not
adversely affect the hospital's own in
surance program until Nov. 1," said
Rich.
Some doctors purchased malprac
tice insurance to avoid suspension.
Rich stated he hoped that during the
extension period the suspended
physicians would reconsider this mat
ter and obtain the insurance neces
sary to remain on the hospital's staff.
Meanwhile. El Camino Hospital is
considering the acceptance of a plan
which would create a self-insurance
plan for the hospital and its staff. The
plan would cost $2.7 million, with
half of this amount being contributed
by the physicians and half by the tax
payers in the hospital's district.
