## Boat house: no 
### 
We recommend a NO vote on the $1 fee assessment
to provide funds to improve the Lake Lagunita Boat
house and the surrounding area.
Although the ASSU has tried to persuade students
that the proposed assessment would be of incalculable
benefit to campus, we disagree. We oppose this project
as being entirely unnecessary. The boathouse already
has been renovated and is now safe for use — the
proposed additions are merely an extravagant waste
of student money.
After all, how necessary are the proposed floats and
the volleyball court? Or the barbecue pit? It seems to
us that students enjoy the Lake Lagunita area as it is
and we doubt whether the recommended additions
would add much.
And although it is true that the beach needs more
sand, surely the ASSU can acquire the $900 necessary
to finance this project without taking anentiresl 1,000
assessment. We suggest that money from program fees
might be one possible source of funds. If any money is
to be acquired for Lagunita-related purposes, it
should be to clean up the lake area — not to add frills.
