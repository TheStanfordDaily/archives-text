# Car fee: unfair
## 
### 
In his Oct. 3 rebuttal of my
position on Stanford's
decision-making policies,
Lance Friedmann declared I
was "dead wrong" in my asser
tion that on the pay parking
issue "input from the commun
ity was largely unsolicited and
ignored when proffered."
To support these absolutisms
Friedmann reminds us that
fast-climbing, Asst. Vice Presi
dent Peter Carpenter "met sev
eral times with the Parking Sub
committee of the Committee on
Land and Use and Building De
velopment ..." whose mem
bers, he adds pointedly "include
faculty, staff and students," as
though the inclusion of token
members of three groups on the
committee implied representu
tion of those groups.
In fact, the CLUBD does in
clude three "staff members" ap
pointed by the President. Those
staff members are the director of
community relations, an as
sociate campaign director from
GSO and the associate dean of
admissions of the Medical
School. This is very high-class
representation for the 7000 staff
members who work at Stanford.
Friedmann might remember
that last year, when the con
troversy regarding the
University's decision to cut the
commencement budget was at
its height, the beseiged head of
University Relations reminded
those who claimed he acted de
spotically, that he had cleard his
decision with the Committee on
Public Events.
Oh! These University Com
mittees; these "open" meetings
discuss decisions already made!
The proof of the feelings of the
community can be seen in the
strength of the reaction against
the parking tax. 6000 people re
fused to pay the fee. 200 parking
citations were turned in to the
SCRAP lawyers in the first three
days of the plan.
Friedmann speaks of a "sur
vey"distributed to 1500 com
munity members by Business
School Students (making no
mention of the results). SCRAP
distributed 8000 questionaires
and the response was over
whelmingly negative. At the
Hospital and Medical Center 10
percent of those responding said
they would quit working at

Stanford rather than pay the
tax.
If true representational input
had been sought by Carpenter, it
was readily available. United
Stanford Employees (1500
workers), CRONA (700 nurses)
Hospital House Staff ( 350 resi
dents and interns) and the Stan
ford Firefighters, all were eager
to negotiate and educate Peter
Carpenter as to the needs of the
staff about parking and trans
portation.
But it was never Carpenter's
intention, 1 charge, to concern
himself with the needs or de
sires of the community.
The regressive nature of this
new tax should be clear to
Friedmann, since he is an
economics major. It is not the
$25,000 to $40,000-a-year ad
ministrator represented on the
committee who is affected by a
$40 per year assessment, but to
a food service worker or library
portal monitor taking home less
than $500 per month, a $40 tax
is a heavy burden.
Shame on you, Friedmann,
that you should suggest that the
woman who washes your dirty
dishes and the man who cleans
your toilets, should pay for the
"privilege" (Friedmann's word)
of parking near their places of
work out of their $3 per hour.
It is shameful that Fried
mann's committee had a hand in
requiring swing-shift Operating
Room Nurses at the hospital to
pay $40 for the privilege of not
being raped on their way to their
cars parked in a lonely, dark lot
one-fourth of a mile from their
place of employment.
Finally, those improvements
in intra-campus transportation,
should have been made before
the imposition of this pay
parking debacle. Friedmann
can speak of the future hope
fully because as a student he
will soon be gone.
He will not need to ride on the
bikepaths which don't exist or
take the imaginary shuttle bus
financed by the dishwasher's
dollars.
