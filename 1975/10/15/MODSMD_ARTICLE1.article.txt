# Galligan on KZSU:
## COP stresses advocacy 
### JACK VAUGHN 
The members of this year's ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP) see them
selves "primarily as student advo
cates" with University adminis
trators, ASSU Vice President Dave
Galligan said yesterday.
Speaking on KZSU's Qimpus Con
ference last night, Galligan said "the
role of a student advocate is much
harder than the role of one who is in
terested only in student services."
Galligan stated the COP "defi
nitely" favors the reconvening of a
committee to revise the newly-ratified
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) prop
osal. "This has been a real trouble

some issue between the COP and Pres
ident (Richard) Lyman," he said, ad
ding that Lyman has opposed reopen
ing the issue decided last spring in a
student referendum.
The COP is also attempting to place
a student on the Board of Trustees,
Galligan said. He maintained that re
sponse from Board members "hasn't
been totally negative, though the re
sponse hasn't been fantastic."
"I can't say we're optimistic but
we're going to keep working at it and
perhaps lay some groundwork for fu
ture COPs," he said.
Calligan predicted there would be
no "ASSU-COP response against"
new. higher parking fees for students.
"We should have higher parking fees
to discourage parking on the central
campus," he said. This policy, he
stated, should also apply to faculty
and employes, currently in a dispute
with the University over parking reg
ulations.
The COP will be relying on a group
of "dorm representatives" for infor
mation on student feelings, according
to Galligan. "We're placing a lot of
faith in the dorm rep organization,"
he said.

He explained that the COP "would
have several meetings with the group,
explain the issues to them and get
their response." In this way, he said,
"the Senate and students on various
University committees will know
what the student interest is."
The representatives. Calligan said,
were selected in many residences
after the COP contacted house as
sociates in each dorm. The represen
tatives will not be required to attend
ASSU Senate meetings, but will con
stitute a separate body "meant to
complement the Senate rather than to
increase its size," he said.
Calligan said ASSU Vice President
Charlotte Germane is about to begin
work on reviving last year's campus
shuttle bus service. Though "it didn't
appear to have been a success" last
year, Calligan claimed this was
"mainly due to a lack of publicity and
infrequent runs" by the buses.
This year, he snid. "we are going to
be looking to the newly-formed Uni
versity Committee on Parking and
Transportation" for funding. He said
he hopes there will be more publicity
for the service this year.
