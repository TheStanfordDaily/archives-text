# Roth House breaks stereotypes
## 
### 
Stephanie Hill, 23, is a third-year law
student here who did her undergraduate
work at Yale. When she tells her friends
where she lives, some of them chuckle.
Others exclaim in disbelief:
"What? You live in Ho(h House?"
Stereotypes are as much a part of thecam
pus housing system as draw numbers: The
eggheads live in the academic theme
house: the spaced-out hippies and radical
freaks live in the activist co-ops: the beer
guzzling animals live in the fraternities: the
sorority-type dollies and would-be dollies
live in houses for girls only; and so on.
Unrealistic view
Accepting these generalizations as accu
rate pictures of student life is about as
realistic as accepting the Playboy pictorial
photographed on the Lambda Nu sundeck
several years ago as an accurate portrayal
of life in a coed dorm. After all. when was
the last time your coed house had a totally
nude outdoor orgy on the roof?
I've been a resident of Roth House, by
chance rather than by choice, for more than
one quarter. I'm still looking for the social
whirl that reportedly exists here. What I've
found instead is a diverse group of women
who are more interested in getting into
graduate school or a career than in getting a
man.
"If you think that the people in an all
women's housedo a lot of dating, it's just not
true," says Mary Ann Toman, the house
president, who plans to attend business
school. "Three years ago, this place would

be fairly empty on a Friday or Saturday
night. Now, just about everyone is up here."
Only three or four women in the house are
seeing just one person socially and "dating"
in the traditional sense of the word. Toman
points out.
Other plusses
The house has plenty of other advantages,
however. Toman has been trying to draw

into Lathrop, a co-ed row house, for the past
three years. If she had succeeded this year,
she probably would have had three room
mates. Hut she has accumulated enough re
sidency points in Roth House to be assured
of a single here. And, Toman adds, "Our
food is probably the best on campus. That
alone attracts a lot of women who want to
live here."
A'fter three years as a Koth resident.
Toman barely acknowledges any hint of a
house stereotype. "I don't care what people
want to think," she responds. "Criticizing a
woman for living here is about the same as
criticizing someone for living in a coed

house. What's wrong with women getting to
know each other? It's important to get to
know people of your own sex."
Yet, according to Hill, the RA, most of this
year's residents are about as happy with the
"dollie" label as they were with the
mediocre draw numbers that left them little
choice but to move in to Roth and try to live
it down.
Now, they'retrying to do something about
it.
Tomorrow night, Roth is holding the first
in a series of sherry hours. The guest speak
ers will be four lawyers, all women, from
Equal Rights Advocates, Inc., a San Fran
cisco law group that specializes in sex dis
crimination law.
And, on the social front. Roth wants to
help other houses transcend their
stereotypes as well. First on the Koth social
calendar is a dinner exchange with C rot hers
(a coed dorm for graduate students that has
a reputation for being about as lively as the
Main Library stacks). A Halloween party is
being planned with Kairos, a coed co-op on
the row.
Even these efforts may not be enough to
convince some skeptics. I'he best wqy to
find out that there's more to Koth House
than the sorority stereotype is to grab your
meal card and gome up 'n see for yourself.
Chances are, Toman points out, that the first
three people you meet will be diverse
enough to change your mind.
