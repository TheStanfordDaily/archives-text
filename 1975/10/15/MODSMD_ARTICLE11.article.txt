One statement in Ahmed I.
Ahuel-H aija's column (Daily.
Oct. 3) really "hits the nail on the
head." He writes: "All the Mid
dle East countries claim they
want peace, but each has its own
definition for peace."
He fails, however, to tell us
what the various definitions are.
This is unfortunate, because the
"key to crisis," which Abuel-
Haija is searching for, is right
there.
He tails to tell us that since the
time o! its foundation, and long
before Arab land was "lost" in
the 191)7 war. Israel has been
openly calling for direct talks
with the Arabs, and made it
very clear that her definition of
peace is normal diplomatic rela
tions, commercial ties and open
borders.
He fails to tell us that Egypt,
whose relations with Israel
seem, at times, improved some
what, defines peace, at best, as
nonbelligerency.
He fails to tell us about the
discrepancy between the peace
Arab leaders claim to seek, in
their propaganda speeches in
the outside world, and the
"peace" they advocate in
speeches to their own peoples.
Most of all, he fails to tell us
that the Palestinian Liberation
Organization's explicit and offi
cial definition of peace is the de
struction and elimination of the
State of Israel.
II Arab leaders would stop
playing with words, and instead
of re-defining peace to suit their
intentions, would modify their
intentions to suit peace, then the
Middle East would be on the
right track to recovery.

I beg to defend your paper
against " The Three" engineers
who objected to publishing
comments on the erections of the
dead. Where's their sense of sick
humor?
Seriously, it's a national pol
icy issue. Eor war is orgasm, the
Final Release of the battlefield,
the final victory over male per
formance anxiety. (And corpses
really do it — a soldier told me
so.)
And then your same issue so
graced with their letter, Oct. 13,
also brought us the courageous
attack on Sun Moon. His Central
Intelligence Agency connec
tions are often discussed, but I
never knew that his movement
gives you five nominations be
fore it picks your spouse.
Concerning writer Gene Cor
don's suggestion of library re
search, check out Doomsday
Cult, a thinly veiled sociological
study of the early U.S. Moon be
fore the big money was poured
in.
Fins the ASSU Senate state
ments. spanning the spectrum of
(conservative) student opinion,
from closet to comedy. And
KPFA'sGounterspy Convention,
job sharing and Oliphant (he's
getting better all the time).
Good stick-to-the-brain
nourishment. Keep it up.

struction and elimination of the
State of Israel.
II Arab leaders would stop
playing with words, and instead
of re-defining peace to suit their
intentions, would modify their
intentions to suit peace, then the
Middle East would be on the
right track to recovery.

I beg to defend your paper
against " The Three" engineers
who objected to publishing
comments on the erections of the
dead. Where's their sense of sick
humor?
Seriously, it's a national pol
icy issue. Eor war is orgasm, the
Final Release of the battlefield,
the final victory over male per
formance anxiety. (And corpses
really do it — a soldier told me
so.)
And then your same issue so
graced with their letter, Oct. 13,
also brought us the courageous
attack on Sun Moon. His Central
Intelligence Agency connec
tions are often discussed, but I
never knew that his movement
gives you five nominations be
fore it picks your spouse.
Concerning writer Gene Cor
don's suggestion of library re
search, check out Doomsday
Cult, a thinly veiled sociological
study of the early U.S. Moon be
fore the big money was poured
in.
Fins the ASSU Senate state
ments. spanning the spectrum of
(conservative) student opinion,
from closet to comedy. And
KPFA'sGounterspy Convention,
job sharing and Oliphant (he's
getting better all the time).
Good stick-to-the-brain
nourishment. Keep it up.

One statement in Ahmed I.
Ahuel-H aija's column (Daily.
Oct. 3) really "hits the nail on the
head." He writes: "All the Mid
dle East countries claim they
want peace, but each has its own
definition for peace."
He fails, however, to tell us
what the various definitions are.
This is unfortunate, because the
"key to crisis," which Abuel-
Haija is searching for, is right
there.
He tails to tell us that since the
time o! its foundation, and long
before Arab land was "lost" in
the 191)7 war. Israel has been
openly calling for direct talks
with the Arabs, and made it
very clear that her definition of
peace is normal diplomatic rela
tions, commercial ties and open
borders.
He fails to tell us that Egypt,
whose relations with Israel
seem, at times, improved some
what, defines peace, at best, as
nonbelligerency.
He fails to tell us about the
discrepancy between the peace
Arab leaders claim to seek, in
their propaganda speeches in
the outside world, and the
"peace" they advocate in
speeches to their own peoples.
Most of all, he fails to tell us
that the Palestinian Liberation
Organization's explicit and offi
cial definition of peace is the de
struction and elimination of the
State of Israel.
II Arab leaders would stop
playing with words, and instead
of re-defining peace to suit their
intentions, would modify their
intentions to suit peace, then the
