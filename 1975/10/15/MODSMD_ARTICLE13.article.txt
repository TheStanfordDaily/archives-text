# McCloskey â€“ proven record
## 
### 
Tomorrow, Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-
Menlo Park) will once again come here to discuss
issues that he feels are important for the fuure of
this country.
He comes at a time when a few of his former
supporters are now deserting him. They feel that
McCloskey's support of aid to Cambodia and his
support of Ford's vetos means that he has some
how "sold out" to the conservatives.
But McCloskey probably will never be ac
cepted by the conservatives because of his blatant
opposition to the Vietnam war and Richard Ni
xon's administration. For if McCloskey had only
kept his mouth shut or at least moderated his
views, he would probably now be an acceptable
U.S. Senate candidate for the Republican Party.
McCloskey's big flaw, if you consider it a flaw,
is that he has the courage to speak out on issues
and policies that he sees as leading this country
on a downhill course. Thus, he opposed the war
long before it became popular to do so because he
saw the country' heading for a great disaster.
Nixon corrupted
McCloskey also opposed the Nixon administ
ration long before any hint of Watergate, because
he saw it as corrupting his personal friends. the
Republic an Party and the country as a whole.

After years of opposition to the war in Vietnam,
McCloskey disappointed many of his supporters
hv advocating continued aid to Cambodia. He
took this, stand because he personally suspected a
bloodbath would take place if the government
fell before the rainy season.
Thus, temporary aid until the rainy season
would have given many innocent people a
chance to escape. A well-documented bloodbath
did occur, an event his now former supporters
seldom mention.
McCloskey has always followed his gut in
sights about the future much to the dislike (if
many Republicans and now to the dislike of
many of his former supporters.
Views the future
I recommend that the community come out and
listen to what McCloskey says about the prob
lems facing this country and its prospects for the
future. He has a known record for being right.
If you are a doctrinaire conservative or a
radical-liberal, you will probably disagree with a
lot of what he says. This is because McCloskey
consistently deals with the changing issues and
politics of the future, instead of just rehashing the
political rhetoric of the past
