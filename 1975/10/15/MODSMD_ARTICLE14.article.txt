# Sexism in the media
## 
### 
We find the Daily deplorable
in its lackof perception and lack
of sensitivity with regard to
women's issues. Three articles
within the last four days have
exemplified what we fear is
practically a tradition with the
paper.
First, the article on the
Chauvinist Neanderthal Troup
was unnewsworthy both by vir
tue of being a rehash of an ear
lier Pah) Alto Times article and
of treating an insipid, reactio
nary "organization" as a matter
of light humor.
If the group is a joke, why
write about it at all? If not, is tlu;
Daily representing its own cam
paign of male backlash in the
guise of quotes from this frivol
ous amalgam of anachronists?
Secondly, the anti-abortion
column epitomizes the
chauvinist ethos that can so idly
talk about "social responsibil
ity" as long as the reality of that
responsibility must lie with
women for obvious biological
reasons.
Women's burden
In our society, the onus of re
sponsibility in abortion, con
traception, and child rearing is
always on women; it is too easy
for men to sit back (childless)
and call women murderers for
undertaking the ordeal of abor
tion. And how typical of your
writer to refer to pregnancy as
"a nine-month inconvenience,"
a naive statement coming from
the place of male privilege, and
insulting to those who choose
abortion or to give birth.
The decision to do either is not
taken lightly by women, pre
gnancy being an intrinsically
emotional spiritual involve

merit. Inconvenience is hardly
the word for it.
Moreover, the author ignores
the real crux of the arguments
on abortion — the opportunity,
the right, to choose whether or
not to become pregnant. Only
when contraception is safe, reli
able and non-sexist can the
abortion question get its de
served burial.
It is interesting that the pub
lishing of this opinion coincides
with the "Right-to-liters' " all
out campaign to repeal the cur
rent abortion laws.
Semantic sexism
Finally, while your front page
article (except for your semantic
sexism in calling women
"girls") concerning the appear
ance of an exhibitionist on cam
pus was commendable in that it
appeared at all, there was a
pointed lack of analysis or in
vestigation into the matter, not
to mention inquiry into the cru
cial problem of one's physical
safety on this campus.
Insofar as fulfilling the news
paper's role of informing by in
quiry. of identifying social in
justice and inadequacy, the
Daily falls far short of its poten
tial. Any cursory investigation
into this occurrence would have
revealed something we found
out the first day of registration:
that exhibitionists and "peeping
Toms" are common in certain
areas of campus (around I.ake
l.agunita and over in the Encina
vicinity).
It is a matter of casual infor
mation in physical education
classes to warn women not to jog
in the l.agunita area alone, not
to use the change room (the only
facility on that side of campus

Cirksena, Strover

for women) in the Encina are.) in
the late afternoon and to never
go there alone.
A strange (and, for women,
very dangerous) set of cir
cumstances for a campus but
one which seemingly is ac
cepted by all.
The Daily seems to be doing
its best to degrade and trivialize
women's search for more mean
ingful roles and recognition.
The noticeable lack of positive
articles on women's groups and
issues combined with the at
titudes prevalent in the three
above mentioned articles is a
pointed indication of the
paper's narrow-minded sexism.

ity" as long as the reality of that
responsibility must lie with
women for obvious biological
reasons.
Women's burden
In our society, the onus of re
sponsibility in abortion, con
traception, and child rearing is
always on women; it is too easy
for men to sit back (childless)
and call women murderers for
undertaking the ordeal of abor
tion. And how typical of your
writer to refer to pregnancy as
"a nine-month inconvenience,"
a naive statement coming from
the place of male privilege, and
insulting to those who choose
abortion or to give birth.
The decision to do either is not
taken lightly by women, pre
gnancy being an intrinsically
emotional spiritual involve

merit. Inconvenience is hardly
the word for it.
Moreover, the author ignores
the real crux of the arguments
on abortion — the opportunity,
the right, to choose whether or
not to become pregnant. Only
when contraception is safe, reli
able and non-sexist can the
abortion question get its de
served burial.
It is interesting that the pub
lishing of this opinion coincides
with the "Right-to-liters' " all
out campaign to repeal the cur
rent abortion laws.
Semantic sexism
Finally, while your front page
article (except for your semantic
sexism in calling women
"girls") concerning the appear
ance of an exhibitionist on cam
pus was commendable in that it
appeared at all, there was a
pointed lack of analysis or in
vestigation into the matter, not
to mention inquiry into the cru
cial problem of one's physical
safety on this campus.
Insofar as fulfilling the news
paper's role of informing by in
quiry. of identifying social in
justice and inadequacy, the
Daily falls far short of its poten
tial. Any cursory investigation
into this occurrence would have
revealed something we found
out the first day of registration:
that exhibitionists and "peeping
Toms" are common in certain
areas of campus (around I.ake
l.agunita and over in the Encina
vicinity).
It is a matter of casual infor
mation in physical education
classes to warn women not to jog
in the l.agunita area alone, not
to use the change room (the only
facility on that side of campus

Cirksena, Strover

for women) in the Encina are.) in
the late afternoon and to never
go there alone.
A strange (and, for women,
very dangerous) set of cir
cumstances for a campus but
one which seemingly is ac
cepted by all.
The Daily seems to be doing
its best to degrade and trivialize
women's search for more mean
ingful roles and recognition.
The noticeable lack of positive
articles on women's groups and
issues combined with the at
titudes prevalent in the three
above mentioned articles is a
pointed indication of the
paper's narrow-minded sexism.
(Kuthry 11 Cirksena and Sharon
Strover are graduate students in
communications.!
We find the Daily deplorable
in its lackof perception and lack
of sensitivity with regard to
women's issues. Three articles
within the last four days have
exemplified what we fear is
practically a tradition with the
paper.
First, the article on the
Chauvinist Neanderthal Troup
was unnewsworthy both by vir
tue of being a rehash of an ear
lier Pah) Alto Times article and
of treating an insipid, reactio
nary "organization" as a matter
of light humor.
If the group is a joke, why
write about it at all? If not, is tlu;
Daily representing its own cam
paign of male backlash in the
guise of quotes from this frivol
ous amalgam of anachronists?
Secondly, the anti-abortion
column epitomizes the
chauvinist ethos that can so idly
talk about "social responsibil
ity" as long as the reality of that
responsibility must lie with
women for obvious biological
reasons.
