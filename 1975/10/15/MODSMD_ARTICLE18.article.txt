Are women on the Pill mure prone to yeast infections and Herpe's
simplex than women not on the Pill? Why? Why do some women
get infections all the time and others never do?
Veast infections and Herpe's simplex are two entirely different
things. There does seem to be a correlation between the Pill and
the former, but no direct connection has been established. Accord
ing to Dr. John Dorman from Cowell, "anything changing the
acidity of the vagina predisposes someone to getting yeast infec
tions." For some reason, not everyone on the Pill is affected in the
same way, and the amount of estrogen in the prescription also
seems to make a difference.
Hut Herpe's is a venereal disease, more common than syphilis
and gonorrhea. It is a virus, apparently transmitted by contact,
and has no certain cure. It is spreading rapidly, becoming increas
ingly common. The disease is not connected with the Pill.
Visible signs are itchy red spots, which change to bumps, then
blisters. The blisters break, leaving a small red sore â€” usually on
the shaft of th<; penis or outside the woman's genitals. The dangers
of Herpe's include an increased statistical chance of cancer of the
cervix and the possibility of a baby becoming infected over its
entire body it the mother has Herpe's sores at the time of birth.
The disease has a dormant stage, so the symptoms might disap
pear after a while, but they could reappear at any time. The only
method one can use to keep from getting Herpe's during inter
course with someone infected and in its visible stage is to utilize a
condom.

Are vasectomies available at Cowell or the Med Center? Are they
recommended for college-age men?
Most doctors are reluctant to perform vasectomies on college
age men, because they have so many years of reproductive ability
ahead, and you're usually out of luck if you change your mind
after it's been done. Cowell does not perform them, but they will
refer you to the Medical Center or the Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
According to Barbara Dewey, secretary to the director of Cowell,
such operations would not be covered by the usual student health
plan. However, the high-level plan offered by Blue Cross would
pay for them if they were performed at the Med Center.
Actually, there is a possibility that a vasectomy reversal opera
tion will be availablesometime in thefuture. Dr. Sherman Silber, a
urologist at the UC Medical Center, has reported the development
of a surgical technique which has been successful in all 24 of the
lirst patients. It utilizes a 40 power microscope and extremely
delicate surgical tools to re-connect the sperm ducts severed in
vasectomy.
