# Injections help cancer patients

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Re
searchers say injections of
highly nutritious solutions have
broken a vicious circle in which
the only hope for a mal
nourished cancer patient was a
treatment which left him even
more malnourished.
A group of Houston resear
chers headed by Dr. Edward M.
Copeland told the Clinical Con
gress of the American College of
Surgeons that hyperalimenta
tion — injection of amino acids,
fats and carbohydrates — has
been successful in replenishing
the strength of cancer patients
being treated with radiation and
chemicals.
Cancer extracts nutrients at a
rapid pace during
chemotherapy and radiation
treatments, often producing loss
of appetite, nausea, diarrhea
and, consequently, weight loss.
Copeland said intravenous
nutrition can provide the pa
tient with adequate physical re

plenishment before and during
his cancer treatments, and if the
cancer responds to treatment,
the patient's appetite returns
naturally and weight is gained.
Dr. Stanley J. Dudrick,
another researcher at the Uni
versity of Texas, said the use of
hyperalimentation on cancer
patients was pioneered by the
team about three years ago.
"Up until then there was a
taboo that said if you fed a
cancer patient, you would ac
celerate the growth of the
tumor," he said. "We've found
that to be untrue."
He said hyperalimentation
was not only useful in treating
curable patients but also in
making terminal patients
stronger and more comfortable
in their last days.
The researchers said they
studied 47 cancer patients who
were given various cancer
treatments and intravenous
nutritional replenishment.
