### GEORGE ANDERS 
Addition of an ice cream fountain
will highlight expansions of the
Transition, according to Hob Caselli,
head of Tresidder food services.
The Transition, a fast food outlet on
the first floor of Tresidder Union, is
currently sharing available counter
space with Marcel's Pastry Shop.
"But over the Christmas vacation,"
Caselli said, "we'll relocate Marcel's
in the dining area by the south drink
ing fountain, and that'll open up a lot
ot space. We'll use it to add a full foun
tain set-up. with everything from ice
creas cones to freezes and sundaes.
Hopefully that'll be in by the begin
ning of winter quarter.
"Other changes, which are still ten
tative." Caselli added, "include Hof
brau sandwiches made to order, and
opening up a health bar offering relish
trays and cold meat platters.

I'ub in Tresidder?
A proposal for a pub in Tresidder is
currently being evaluated by the Al
coholic Beverages Control Board. As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs D;in Wil
liams said. "We expect to hear from
them by the end of the month." he
stated.
"If the proposal goes through, the
next step is to get estimates of how
much a pub would cost, how much
money it would take in. and decide
whether it's financially feasible." Wil
liams continued.
"This should all be done by the end
of the year." he said, "but we've made
predictions before and nothing's
happened.
The pub would be located in what is
presently the pinball and pool room.
Longer hours
Since Sept. 29, the Transition has
been open until midnight every night.
"We tried longer hours last spr
ing, "Caselli noted,"and the figures
showed it would be worthwhile to
pursue this in the fall. So far we're
breaking even after 7 p.m."
Caselli indicated that the name "the
Transition" is probably here to stay.
"It's not the best name possible, but a
lot of people remember it. We ran a
marketing survey, and got a favorable
response from 94 percent of the people
at the mention of the Transition."
Overall, Williams noted, "We're
trying to make Tresidder not just a
student union, but a union for
everyone on campus. For example last
Thursday, we had a reception for
about 100 secretaries throughout the
University."
