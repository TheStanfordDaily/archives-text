## Crew captain sees big year 
### GARY MARENZI 
II the performance of theStan
ford men's crow team ap
proaches the same level as the
enthusiasm of its captain, Jim
Wickersham, the Cardinal
oarsmen will be plying the wat
ers of Syracuse, N.Y., at the In
ternational Rowing Association
Championships next May.
The senior human biology
major will lead the varsity eight
to Long Beach for a wide open
event known as the Head of the
Harbor Regatta in late
November. This unusual 2.3
mile race (most races are 2000
meters) will be the first test of
this year's squad.
Wickersham expects a banner
year from the crew team and
spent this entire summer at
Stanford to prepare himself for
the grueling races that lay be
fore him. The muscular ex-
Marine thinks that the recent ac
tion by the Department of Athle
tics promoting crew from"club
sport" to "varsity club sport"
status will give the program the
recognition it deserves.
"We are a student-run or
ganization that puts more
people into the Olympics than
the top crew powers, and the
University is only now coming
behind us," Wickersham says.
He cites that, in the last six
Olympiads, Stanford oarsmen
have had a hand in seven of the
14 medals won by the United
States â€” a record which no
other university approaches.
Presently, there are about 50
men and 50 women in the prog
ram who hope to lengthen that
list.
Club dues
The crew program is actually
a club. Undergraduate members
who participate in the races pay
annual dues of $10 while
graduate students and others
who wish to use the club's
equipment at the Redwood City
Boathouse pay a yearly fee of
$20. These dues hardly cover
the cost of running the program,
which fields eight-man boats on
the varsity, IV and freshman
level as well as a four-man var
sity shell.
Also to be financed is the new
women's crew program, which
has yet to enter competition. To
intensify the money problem,
the Department of Athletics, de
spite raising the status of the
crew, has dropped its subsidy
from $4500 to $1500.
Another source of income
may present itself as a television
advertisement for Stroh's Beer.
The Detroit-based brewery has
made a "concrete" offer for the
use of Stanford crewmen in an
upcoming commercial.
Brew and crew
"Why not," says Wickersham,
"beer and rowing seem to go to
gether." Stanford's name will
not be used in the ad, ruling out
any astronomical royalties or
loss of the crew's atnateur stand

ing, but the club may still net up
to $1000.
With the exception of the
Head of the Harbor Regatta, all
of the crew's races are
scheduled for springflquarter.
Hut. with the excellent guidance
of Coach Dick Dreissigacker,
who is himself training for the
Olympic games, Stanford's row
ing skills won't rust during the
winter.
"Crew requires a combination
of balance, strength, endurance
and teamwork," says Wicker
sham, "and it may not look too
difficult, but it is. The goal of the
oarsman is to make it look
easy"
Winning, that is.
