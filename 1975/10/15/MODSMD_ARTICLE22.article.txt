Scotchers win all
The Stanford women's field hockey team bat
tled and conquered all six of the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
(NCIAC) teams in a pre-season tournament held
at Cliico State last weekend.
"Quite frankly, we weren't out to win," says
Asst. Coach Lewis Alexander. "We knew the
tournament didn't count towards conference
wins, so we treated it as just good practice."
This "just good practice" resulted in the fol
lowing Stanford victories: Hayward State (3-1),
IJC-Davis (4-1), Chico State (5-0), San lose State
(2-0), Sacramento State (1-0); and Humboldt
State (3-1).
The team lost one game to Simon-Fraser, a
team visiting from Canada.
The six victories didn't come all that easily.
Torrential rains ruined the three fields and
turned the goal cage into an immense puddle.
"The fact that the field was a sea of mud and the
sky was full of lightning," says Alexander,
"made the games exceptionally dangerous."
"Sacramento wasn't the best team, but cer
tainly the roughest," Alexander added. This
game triggered minor injuries to Onnie Killefer,
Jane Schultz. Ann Walker and Yvonne Water
man. "With all these injuries we sort of lost our
composure," said Alexander.

The high-scoring capabilities of Killefer and
Walker were augmented by those of two first
time scorers, Jane Soyster and Jamie Crodsky.
The season opens today at 1:30 with a confer
ence game against Hayward State. Field hockey
enthusiasts are asked to support the team and
hear the Stanford Band perform at halftime.

Sailors take 2nd in regatta
The Stanford sailing team opened its season
last weekend by taking second place in the
Northern Californian Intercollegiate Match Rac
ing Championships at Santa Cruz. Skip Schapiro
was at the helm for Stanford whilePeterSkinner,
Doug Barger and Alan Andrews served as crew.
After the first day of competition. Berkeley,
Santa Cruz and Stanford were deadlocked in a
three-way tie, forcing the event to carry over into
Sunday. After Sunday's last scheduled race the
three way tie was still unbroken.
The race committee, foreseeing this possibility,
had arranged for a sudden death sail cff. One last
race was sailed, with the results for the entire
regatta based on its outcome. In strong winds.
Berkeley won the last race and sailed away with
the cup. '
