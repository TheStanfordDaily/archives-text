# Fencers defend titles
## 
### GARY SPRAGUE 
The two white-clad fencers
saluted each other and disap
peared behind their tight wire
mesh facemasks. A moment's
pause gave way to a flurry of
flashing steel. Advance, fake,
lunge, touch; the point was won.
The automatic scoring machine,
with electronic infallibility, re
corded the touch with buzzing
and flashing lights. "Good
shot," said one of the masks.
"Let's try it again."
This vignette, replayed
thousands of times in the Roble
gym, is the preparation for the
Stanford fencing team's 1975-76
season.
The fencing office, halt office
and half arsenal, has that com
fortable lived-in look, neatly
cluttered with fencing
magazines and wandering
fencers. Four large trophies are
prominently displayed along
one wall, testifying to the qual
ity of the program Coach Jean
Helliwell has single-handedly
developed at Stanford over the
last 10 years.
WhenCoachHelliwell arrived
in 1964, Stanford fencing con
sisted of a women's team and
whatever else the independent
fencing club could scrape to
gether. Helliwell formed the
first men's team in 1966, fol
lowed by the first epee and saber
squads in 1970 and 1973 respec
tively.
The years of work by both
coach and team members
climaxed in last year's champ
ionship showing: Northern
California championships in
individual foil, individual epee,
overall men's, and a second
overall in the Western Intercol
legiate Fencing Conference
(WIFC).
The prospects look just as
good for this year. While warily
eyeing last year's WIFC champ,

Cal State Fullerton, and power
ful San lose State. Helliwell
commented. "1 think we have a
good chance with our foil team
to do as well as we did last year.
This last year was our top per
formance, and I think they'll
come through again." Smiling
and glancing at the prized pos
sessions on the wall, she added,
"We hope to keep all our
trophies."
Bob Wilder and Steve Walt re
turn on the epee team. Walt,
gracious and friendly in the Hel
liwell mold, is the man to watch
this year in Stanford fencing. As
a sophomore. Walt took the
Northern California individual
championship, fourth in the
Westerns, and placed 17th in the
NCAA finals.
This year. Walt is looking
higher. "If I make the NCAA's
again," he says, "my goal is to
make the semis this year, the top
12, and the finals next year, the
top six. And I'm eyeing Al I -
American sometime before 1
graduate."
The saber team looks a little
thin, with Chris Berk as the only
returnee. Commenting on the
team's chances. Berk exhibited
a reserved optimism. "I expect

the team to uphold the fine win
ning tradition set by last year's
first place team through hard
work."
"You bet we're going to
work," chipped in Helliwel),
trying to sound authoritarian.
The ruse collapses, however,
and the fencers break up laugh
ing.
The women's team also looks
strong, building on the founda
tions of Claudia Tenby and cap
tain Marie Fiatarone.
Helliwell becomes most en
thusiastic when talking of the
excellent crop of freshmen, led
by Harvey Cain. Cain is a three
year member of the national
modern pentathalon team,
which includes fencing as one of
its five sports.
Stanford has only recently
emerged as a fencing power and
this season will be crucial in
firmly establishing that winning
tradition. But whatever hap
pens. the fencers will have a
good time. When asked about
CoachHelliwell's strong points,
one team member sagaciously
offered, "She throws good par
ties and makes great clam
chowder." What more could
you ask?
