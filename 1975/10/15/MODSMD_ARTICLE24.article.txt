Ford car hit broadside
HARTFORD, Conn. — A Buick sedan ran into
the front fender of President Ford's armored
limousine last night at a downtown intersection
after Ford gave a speech in Hartford. Ford said he
was not hurt.
There is "no reason to believe it was anything
hut an accident," Secret Service spokesman Jack
Warner said
Hartford police said the driver of the car that hit
the limousine indicated the collision was not in
tentional. The crash was under investigation. No
arrests were reported.
"I feel fine. I feel great," Ford told a reporter
after he arrived at the Hartford airport. Asked if he
had been shaken up, Ford replied, "No, not a bit."
The President then jogged up the stairs of Air
Force One and flew back to Washington.
The light-colored sedan carrying five persons
hit the right front fender of the Presidents
limousine. Ford was sitting in the right rear seat
with Republican State Chairman Frederickßiebel,
whose left wrist was injured in the collision.
Refugees 'need welfare'
OAKLAND — "We left Vietnam dreaming
of a new life, now we are hungry," says one of 90
refugees who were brought here to train for jobs
but now find themselves candidates for the welfare
rolls.
The refugees are mostly former South Viet
namese military officers who arrived in Oakland
on Sept. 17 after leaving the Camp Pendleton,
relocation center.
The plan to train them for jobs ran amuck be
cause it was designed for people who spoke En
glish, and it turned out most of the refugees do not.
Now, a $40,000 grant for their support is running
out.
"We can't send them back to Camp Pendleton,"
said John Whalen, a San Francisco lawyer helping
handle the grant from the Tolstoy Foundation of
New York. "Once the refugees are out, the gov
ernment won't take them back. So we're asking
Alameda County welfare to put them on the rolls.
One of the refugees, Dang Phung, had hoped to
get a job as a security guard. "We can't go back to

Vietnam because of the Communist government."
he said. "The American people have been so nice
we thought we'd made good together. Hut right
now we've been hungry for the fifth time" since
coming to Oakland.
Whalen said the refugees training program here
was supposed to involves 00 bachelors "fluent in
English, ready for training." Instead, he added,
some of the "bachelors" turned up with families
and children, creating room and board problems.
The training was to prepare them for employ
ment as security guards under the guidance of
Gordon Jacobson of the I! rban Security Services of
San Francisco.
Jacobson said he was assured the refugees could
handle English, but found that only one in three
spoke the language.
"There is just no way we can get them jobs with
out that," he said.
Whalen said only $2000 remained of the founda
tion funds obtained in three grants in September
and October. Most of the money has gone for food
and administration, he said.
Ford threatens budget veto
HARTFORD. Conn. — President Ford returned
to the political arena last night and threatened to
use the "veto 100 times" if the Democratic Con
gress passes a 1976 tax cut without setting a ceiling
on federal spending.
In a speech to a Republican fund-raising dinner,
the President warned, "If the Congress sends me
legislation that exceeds the spending limitation
and threatens your tax cut, 1 will not hesitate to use
the constitutional authority available to me and
veto that legislation.
"The veto has been described as a 'negative' act,
but I've used it 39 times and saved the American
taxpayers $0 billion," he said. "I will use it 100
times, if necessary, to prevent excessive and in
flationary spending increases."
The President said his spending and tax cut
proposals will lighten the public's tax load. "But if
we want this kind of new direction in our tax
policies, we must have a new direction in our
spending policies as well," the President said.
"Tonight. 1 say to the 'Can't-Do' Congress: It can
be done. Why not do it?"

"Let me emphasize, however, I will work with
the Congress to ensure that those who deserve help
will continue to receive that help — the elderly, the
poor, the veterans who have borne this nation's
arms.
"Nor will I permit slashes in our military budget
that would jeopardize our national security," the
President said.
Nobel for economics given
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — A Soviet mathemati
cian favoring less Kremlin control over the
economy and a Dutch-born American pioneer in
how best to use men and machines were jointly
awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Economic Sci
ence yesterday.
The two — Soviet Professor Leonid Kantorovich.
63, and Tjalling C. Koopmans, 65, of Yale Univer
sity — were cited by the Swedish Academy of Sci
ences "for their contributions to the theory of op
timum allocation of resources." Koopmans said he
was "delighted" by the news; Kantorovich said he
was "very touched."
On the practical side their work has been
applied by others for such purposes as more effi
cient transportation, how best to assign men to
machines and improved warehousing and storage.
