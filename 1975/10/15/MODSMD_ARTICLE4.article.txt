# Miller: tuition to rise to $4303 next year
## 
### RICHARD FEARON DAN FIDUCCIA 
Projected tuition for next year will
be $4303, Provost William Miller and
Vice Provost for Research William
Massy reported yesterday to the
Board of Trustees.
The projection is part of the Uni
versity's official five-year financial
plan. According to the plan, tuition
would be increased by an average of
12.2 percent per year through 1980.
This projected tuition increase rate is
slightly higherthan that proposed last
year.
Financial aid is planned to increase
by an average of 11.6 percent per year
through 1980, said Massy.
If tuition is increased at this average
rate over the next four years, tuition
for the 1979-80 academic year will be
$6036.
Despite the stock market's recovery,
near-record contributions and budget
reductions, last year's estimate of a
$1.2 million budget deficit between
now and 1977-78 is still being pro
jected.
"We consider that gap to be slightly
optimistic, that is to say, it could be
more," said Massy. He added, "We
think it's a credible figure."
"Considering a larger gap would
begin to seriously impact academic
programs while smaller ones would
not adequately reflect Stanford's
economic situation." he explained.
Persistent inflation and a sharp rise
in projected energy costs have caused
this large deficit. Massy said.
One of the methods for coping with
the deficit is to lower the projected
increase in faculty and staff salaries,
he stated.
"A year ago we were projecting a
real increase in income,"said Massy.
The current plan is to increase the fa
culty and staff salaries at the same
rate as inflation, according to Massy.

Budget reductions which have been
proposed are:
—11.1 percent for all academic
programs. The School of Humanities
and sciences (H&S) will have to face a
ft.6 percent reduction and the School
of Engineering will have a reduction
of 7.7 percent. Last spring the H&S
reduction was projected to be 3.9 per
cent.
—14.5 percent for general ad
ministration and maintenance.
—14.2 percent for student services.
The plan also proposes decreasing
the Overseas Studies budget by 50
percent. This decrease is the same de
crease projected last spring.

Massy explained that the five-year
projection is based on a number of as
sumptions. The first of these is that the
Consumer Price Index will increase at
about 9 percent per year.
"Some believe that it will be in the 5
percent to 6 percent while others ex
pect it to be in the double-digits," said
Massy.
la king "a middle course, but
slightly on the high side," inflation is
estimated at 9 percent for 197(>-77,
two percentage points above the rate
anticipated last year.
One reason for such large tution
hikes is the University's new goal to
increase the general endowment fund.
"We are slightly the prop
ortion of the endowment that we pay
out to expenditures." Massy re
marked. Combined with gifts and
natural stock market growth for the
endowment stocks, the endowment
should provide a steady proportion of
the yearly budget in the future, he said.
A report discussing the effects of
tuition increases on students will be
presented at the Board's meeting next
month.
Massy noted that family income is
projected to increase at an average
annual rate of 10.2 percent until 1980.
After 1980
"Tuition increases beyond 1980
will be something in the 9 percent
range," Massy added.
The plan's projections include an
anticipated decrease in donations fol
lowing the conclusion of the Cam
paign for Stanford, he stated.
Begun three years ago, the five-year
projections are an attempt to antici
pate the University's financial posi
tion in future years.
The final tuition rate for next year
will be decided in December.
Plans to close the budget deficit call
for cutting the budget by $4 million
both this year and next year. An addi
tional $2 million will be cut in the
third and final year of the $10 million
budget decrease program.

programs. The School of Humanities
and sciences (H&S) will have to face a
ft.6 percent reduction and the School
of Engineering will have a reduction
of 7.7 percent. Last spring the H&S
reduction was projected to be 3.9 per
cent.
—14.5 percent for general ad
ministration and maintenance.
—14.2 percent for student services.
The plan also proposes decreasing
the Overseas Studies budget by 50
percent. This decrease is the same de
crease projected last spring.

Massy explained that the five-year
projection is based on a number of as
sumptions. The first of these is that the
Consumer Price Index will increase at
about 9 percent per year.
"Some believe that it will be in the 5
percent to 6 percent while others ex
pect it to be in the double-digits," said
Massy.
la king "a middle course, but
slightly on the high side," inflation is
estimated at 9 percent for 197(>-77,
two percentage points above the rate
anticipated last year.
One reason for such large tution
hikes is the University's new goal to
increase the general endowment fund.
"We are slightly the prop
ortion of the endowment that we pay
out to expenditures." Massy re
marked. Combined with gifts and
natural stock market growth for the
endowment stocks, the endowment
should provide a steady proportion of
the yearly budget in the future, he said.
A report discussing the effects of
tuition increases on students will be
presented at the Board's meeting next
month.
Massy noted that family income is
projected to increase at an average
annual rate of 10.2 percent until 1980.
After 1980
"Tuition increases beyond 1980
will be something in the 9 percent
range," Massy added.
The plan's projections include an
anticipated decrease in donations fol
lowing the conclusion of the Cam
paign for Stanford, he stated.
Begun three years ago, the five-year
projections are an attempt to antici
pate the University's financial posi
tion in future years.
The final tuition rate for next year
will be decided in December.
Plans to close the budget deficit call
for cutting the budget by $4 million
both this year and next year. An addi
tional $2 million will be cut in the
third and final year of the $10 million
budget decrease program.
Projected tuition for next year will
be $4303, Provost William Miller and
Vice Provost for Research William
Massy reported yesterday to the
Board of Trustees.
The projection is part of the Uni
versity's official five-year financial
plan. According to the plan, tuition
would be increased by an average of
12.2 percent per year through 1980.
This projected tuition increase rate is
slightly higherthan that proposed last
year.
Financial aid is planned to increase
by an average of 11.6 percent per year
through 1980, said Massy.
If tuition is increased at this average
rate over the next four years, tuition
for the 1979-80 academic year will be
$6036.
Despite the stock market's recovery,
near-record contributions and budget
reductions, last year's estimate of a
$1.2 million budget deficit between
now and 1977-78 is still being pro
jected.
"We consider that gap to be slightly
optimistic, that is to say, it could be
more," said Massy. He added, "We
think it's a credible figure."
"Considering a larger gap would
begin to seriously impact academic
programs while smaller ones would
not adequately reflect Stanford's
economic situation." he explained.
Persistent inflation and a sharp rise
in projected energy costs have caused
this large deficit. Massy said.
One of the methods for coping with
the deficit is to lower the projected
increase in faculty and staff salaries,
he stated.
"A year ago we were projecting a
real increase in income,"said Massy.
The current plan is to increase the fa
culty and staff salaries at the same
rate as inflation, according to Massy.

Budget reductions which have been
proposed are:
—11.1 percent for all academic
programs. The School of Humanities
and sciences (H&S) will have to face a
