## Tenure OK granted 
### 
I he Board of Trustees yesterday approved the granting of tenure and an
associate professorship to Paul M. Sniderman, 34, an assistant political
science professor heresince 1968, a reliable source informed the Daily.
1 he Board also approved the administration's recommendation to award
Civil Engineering Prof. Perry Lee McCarty the Silas H. Palmer endowed
chair, the source said.
The source said the Appointments and Promotions Committee recom
mended denying Sniderman tenure, but that higher officials decided to
disregard the committee's advice.
Neither President Richard Lyman nor Provost William Miller would con
firm the report, although Lyman said he was "not directly or personally
involved" in the decision to grant tenure to Sniderman.
Miller said it is not uncommon tor the dean of Humanities and Sciences or
his seven-member Advisory Board to overrule the committee's recommen
dations.
Miller noted, however, that in most cases, the committee's advice is fol
lowed by higher ranking administrators.
Sniderman refused tocomment on his case and Halsey Royden, dean of the
school oi Humanities and Sciences, was unavailable for comment.
McCarty, 44, has taught at Stanford since 1962. He has published more
than 80 professional papers, articles and reports and has helped develop the
environmental engineering science teaching program, now ranked best of
its kind in the nation.
