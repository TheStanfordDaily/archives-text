# ARC sponsors open forum
## 
### BERT BOWER 
Contending that yesterday's Hoard
of Trustees meeting was closed to
"meaningful student participation."
the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) sponsored an open town meet
ing to discuss the role students have in
shaping the character of the univer
sity.
Approximately 150 people assem
bled on the grass in White Plaza to
hear three student speakers address
the implications of the Boa rd's closed
meeting on student power. Fol
lowing the presentations, there was
an open forum.
ARC member Terry Bright ques
tioned whether trustee interests are
geared to student needs. She said.
"The Board is composed almost en
tirely of corporate businessmen.
There are 30 trustees who collectively
hold someßO board of directorships in
this nation's corporations."
She admitted that some Board
members are sympathetic to student
needs but they "clearly are not in the
majority." She asked, "How long are
we going to let them control this
power?"
Brett Cook, the only non-ARC
member who formally addressed the

gathering, outlined areas in which
students might concentrate
in the future. She included University
land use policy, saying "Students
should be involved in such planning
as whether or not the Stanford Shop
ping (.'enter will receive funds from
the endowment."
She predicted another "round of
campaigning" if Provost William Mil
ler decides to terminate the SWOPS I
and SCIRE programs which were
dealt severe economic cut-backs last
year.
Mike Kieschnick, an ARC' member,
told the group that "radicals of the
past made the mistake of centering all
their discontent on the Board of Trus
tees." Urging the group to take a
broader look at where power if con
centrated, he opined that the trustees
indirectly control power through the
faculty and the administration.
'A deal'
"The faculty and trustees have a
deal," claimed Kieschnick. "The fa
culty understands that the trustees
give the University funds to pay them
and, in turn, they give the trustees
what they need." The trustees benefit
from the faculty's technological re
search and professional skills, he

said.
He went on to criticize the role of
corporations in university education,
saying, "Stanford teaches students to
think analytically and creatively, but
the social system, through high pay
ing johs, bribes students not to use
those skills to critically analyze the
system."
As another example of the Board's
indirect control over the University,
Kieschnick charged "Richard Lyman
is president of the University because
in 1969, when he was the provost, he
was willing to call in the Santa Clara
County sheriffs to quell sit-ins and de
monstrations, whereas ex-president
Kenneth Pitzer was too nice."
Kieschnick believes that this action
"earned Lyman the admiration of the
trustees."
When the initial speakers finished
the microphone was left open for pub
lic discussion but only a handful of
individuals responded to the invita
tion.
Students 'inept'?
One student, Tom Craham, com
mented, "Students don't have any
power because they have done no
thing to gain power." He went further
to declare, "Students have been inept
at coming up with alternatives to the
power structure."
At (he close of the town meeting,
petitions were circulated proposing
that the student body, faculty and staff
be granted voting membership in the
Board of Trustees. ARC intends to
present the petitions to the Board at its
next meeting.
