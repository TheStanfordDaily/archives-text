## Degree candidates deserve a voice 
### 
The process for selecting a commencement speaker
has become a controversy once more. Senior class
officers believe a poll should be taken to determine
who should be the speaker; the administration be
lieves that the past method (the class officers working
with administrators to choose the speaker) should be
continued.
We believe that the poll should be conducted to
determine the commencement speaker. Anyone who
would be eligible to receive a degree in next June's
commencement should be allowed to vote in this elec
tion.
Senior class officers have already had the seniors
complete a form on which they listed speaker candi
dates. A list of all suggested speakers should be made
public a few weeks before the election to allow the
members of the community the opportunity of exa
mining and debating the candidates.
After the election the candidates should be invited
in the order of their vote-getting.
We feel that this process is necessitated by several
reasons. First, President Richard Lyman has stated
that "it ought to be possible to carry on controversies
at a relatively high level of intelligence ..." here.
We fail to see how any sort of an informed,
academic debate can occur solely between four senior
class officers and a handful of administrators. To ask
these four seniors to discuss the hundreds of
suggested candidates with appproximately 1000
seniors is, at best, ludicrous.
To place the burden on them of being almost exclu
sively responsible for the selection of a speaker at a
commencement (which will also be attended by stu
dents who didn't elect them as officers) is unfair.
Second, Lyman has also contended that, even if all
graduate students were polled, there would still be the
problem of what to do if the person invited refused to
speak. Under this proposed system, if the candidate
with the highest vote total refused, then the next can
didate should be invited and so on down the list.
This method differs with the one used in previous
years in just two areas: In the past, only the class
officers and administrators composed the list, and
only they knew the order in which the candidates
were invited.
Possibly students should vote for three speakers,
thus allowing a clearer ranking of candidates.
Third, Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons has
recently suggested that there should be no com
mencement speaker. This idea also deserves discus
sion. The most effective method through which sup
port, or opposition, to this idea can be measured is
also by an election.
Parents and alumni also have a concern in com
mencement. However, any students receiving a de
gree here should be mature and intelligent enough to
examine, and then select, a provocative speaker.
Any selection process is bound to have its disadvan
tages. Yet an election will allow for the most open and
objective consideration — one which will sort out
those unqualified to speak and one which will help
remove controversy from commencement.

gree here should be mature and intelligent enough to
examine, and then select, a provocative speaker.
Any selection process is bound to have its disadvan
tages. Yet an election will allow for the most open and
objective consideration — one which will sort out
those unqualified to speak and one which will help
remove controversy from commencement.
The process for selecting a commencement speaker
has become a controversy once more. Senior class
officers believe a poll should be taken to determine
who should be the speaker; the administration be
lieves that the past method (the class officers working
with administrators to choose the speaker) should be
continued.
We believe that the poll should be conducted to
determine the commencement speaker. Anyone who
would be eligible to receive a degree in next June's
commencement should be allowed to vote in this elec
tion.
Senior class officers have already had the seniors
complete a form on which they listed speaker candi
dates. A list of all suggested speakers should be made
public a few weeks before the election to allow the
members of the community the opportunity of exa
mining and debating the candidates.
After the election the candidates should be invited
in the order of their vote-getting.
We feel that this process is necessitated by several
reasons. First, President Richard Lyman has stated
that "it ought to be possible to carry on controversies
at a relatively high level of intelligence ..." here.
We fail to see how any sort of an informed,
academic debate can occur solely between four senior
class officers and a handful of administrators. To ask
these four seniors to discuss the hundreds of
suggested candidates with appproximately 1000
seniors is, at best, ludicrous.
To place the burden on them of being almost exclu
sively responsible for the selection of a speaker at a
commencement (which will also be attended by stu
dents who didn't elect them as officers) is unfair.
Second, Lyman has also contended that, even if all
graduate students were polled, there would still be the
problem of what to do if the person invited refused to
speak. Under this proposed system, if the candidate
with the highest vote total refused, then the next can
didate should be invited and so on down the list.
This method differs with the one used in previous
years in just two areas: In the past, only the class
officers and administrators composed the list, and
only they knew the order in which the candidates
were invited.
Possibly students should vote for three speakers,
thus allowing a clearer ranking of candidates.
Third, Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons has
recently suggested that there should be no com
mencement speaker. This idea also deserves discus
sion. The most effective method through which sup
port, or opposition, to this idea can be measured is
also by an election.
Parents and alumni also have a concern in com
mencement. However, any students receiving a de
gree here should be mature and intelligent enough to
examine, and then select, a provocative speaker.
