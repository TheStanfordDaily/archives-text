Be a special kind of Navy Flyer.
Be a Naval Flight Officer.
Whenever a Navy plane is under electronic con
trol, that plane is in the hands of a Naval Flight
Officer. Naturally, as a candidate for Naval Flight
Officer training you'll need some very special
qualifications. First, you must really want to fly,
even if you've never flown before. You'll also
need a college degree and a sharp mind.
Waiting at the end of your training program
are the Golden Wings of a Naval Flight Officer.
By then you'll be an expert in areas like Jet Navi
gation and Airborne Control... equipped to do
your job wherever you go.
But whatever your specialty, travel will be
part of your life. And so will challenge, responsi
bility, achievement and reward.
If that's the kind of career you're looking for,
and if you think you've got what it takes to be a
Naval Flight Officer, see your local Navy re
