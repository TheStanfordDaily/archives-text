# Campus activists confront issues
## 
### BERT BOWER 
Radicals. Immediately the word
conjures up images of a gun-toting
Patricia "Tania" Mearstandguerrillas
in Zaire holding Stanford students as
hostages.
But at Stanford, radicalism, how
ever uneasily it rests within the staid
sandstone archways and manicured
gardens of campus life, is conceived of
as critical, reasoned thinking directed
at confronting such issues as the state
of the economy, third world grie
vances and even personal life styles.
The leading forum for radical
thought at Stanford is the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARCJ, founded in the
spring of 1974 after the United Stan
ford Employees went on strike and un
ited a group of people devoted to the
idea of forming an activist organiza
tion.
As one ARC member put it,"I
looked around me and saw that out
there in the 'big world' something was
going wrong — things needed to be
done — and nothing could change if I
continued in the normal liberal 'patch
up' type way."
Three goals
Since its inception, ARC] has been
devoted to eradicating three principle
"isms" — imperialism, sexism and
racism.
"We have a three pronged approach
to these goals," said Larry Litvak, an
active ARC member. "We want to
educate people, involve ourselves in
action and offer people alternative
ways of living their lives."
ARC itself is an alternative organi
zation unlike other campus groups.
"We're a supportive community for
people who are dissatisfied with Stan
ford and want to integrate social ac

tivism into their everyday lives,"
explained Mike Kieschnick, another
ARC member.
Challenging the student body to di
vert its awareness from collegiate
preoccupations to a more worldly, ac
tivist outlook has been one of ARC's
predominant aims. Among ARC ac
tivities last year were a 150-person
demonstration against Marine Corps
recruitment on campus, a benefit to
raise funds for the Inez Garcia and
Joan Little defense funds, a 600-
person demonstration objecting to fi
nancial aid cutbacks and a student
march and sit-in to protest Stanford's
contract to design a communications
satellite for the Shah of Iran's "repres
sive" regime.
Sharp criticism
The contract protest exemplifies
how ARC has drawn sharp criticism
for its actions.
"They (ARC) are dead wrong," in
sisted Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan, one of two scientists
working on the project, in a recent
interview. "They said what sounded
best instead of what was accurate."
Lusignan stated that ARC's action
"stopped some students from par
ticipating in the educational aspect of
our program by putting them under
heavy pressure." As to ARC's role in
the university he conceded, "They
have a legitimate role, but 1 wish
they'd be more responsible in their re
search."
Jonathan Marshall, a senior history
major who has written extensively on
radicalism, commented on ARC's
role, "I think ARC is needed, but I
don't think they have reached the stu
dent body to try to present a coherent
philosophy."
Explaining that he was involved in
ARC only during its initial stages,
Marshall said, "In ideological terms,
simplistic Marxism was becoming
dominant in the group, and things we
ren't organized."
Recent criticisms
Students For Equity (SEE), a group
formed to prevent what its members
see as minority aid cut-backs, also
criticized ARC.
According to Josie Jaramillo, SEE
member and an ASSU vice president,
"ARC wasn't telling us all their plans
when they asked for our endorse
ment." SFE endorsed last year's ARC
protest against aid cut-backs and the
Iranian contract and was surprised
when the incident turned into a sit-in,
she implied.
Leftist groups and administrations
have never made congenial bedfel
lows and ARC is no exception for
Stanford administrators.
President Richard Lyman, reflect
ing on last year's controversies in
which ARC was involved, suggested
that more "academic debate rather
than antagonistic bickering" should
have taken place.
ARC member, Seth Foldy, said that
"rational communication is no good if
he (Lyman) doesn't act on what we
suggest."
No impact
ARC's effect on university decisions
seems minimal. "In terms of the direct
impact of the organization I'd have to
say it doesn't have any," stated Pro
vost William Miller. He said he be
lieves that most faculty and administ
ration members "wouldn't even know
what ARC is."

Certainly ARC isn't as visible as its
counterparts in the '60s. "The move
ment is in a process of maturity."
commented Foldy.in comparing ARC
to the last decade's movement. "We
can't limit ourselves to popular issues
but must confront the entire capitalist
system as it stands today and offer al
ternatives."

working on the project, in a recent
interview. "They said what sounded
best instead of what was accurate."
Lusignan stated that ARC's action
"stopped some students from par
ticipating in the educational aspect of
our program by putting them under
heavy pressure." As to ARC's role in
the university he conceded, "They
have a legitimate role, but 1 wish
they'd be more responsible in their re
search."
Jonathan Marshall, a senior history
major who has written extensively on
radicalism, commented on ARC's
role, "I think ARC is needed, but I
don't think they have reached the stu
dent body to try to present a coherent
philosophy."
Explaining that he was involved in
ARC only during its initial stages,
Marshall said, "In ideological terms,
simplistic Marxism was becoming
dominant in the group, and things we
ren't organized."
Recent criticisms
Students For Equity (SEE), a group
formed to prevent what its members
see as minority aid cut-backs, also
criticized ARC.
According to Josie Jaramillo, SEE
member and an ASSU vice president,
"ARC wasn't telling us all their plans
when they asked for our endorse
ment." SFE endorsed last year's ARC
protest against aid cut-backs and the
Iranian contract and was surprised
when the incident turned into a sit-in,
she implied.
Leftist groups and administrations
have never made congenial bedfel
lows and ARC is no exception for
Stanford administrators.
President Richard Lyman, reflect
ing on last year's controversies in
which ARC was involved, suggested
that more "academic debate rather
than antagonistic bickering" should
have taken place.
ARC member, Seth Foldy, said that
"rational communication is no good if
he (Lyman) doesn't act on what we
suggest."
No impact
ARC's effect on university decisions
seems minimal. "In terms of the direct
impact of the organization I'd have to
say it doesn't have any," stated Pro
vost William Miller. He said he be
lieves that most faculty and administ
ration members "wouldn't even know
what ARC is."

Certainly ARC isn't as visible as its
counterparts in the '60s. "The move
ment is in a process of maturity."
commented Foldy.in comparing ARC
to the last decade's movement. "We
can't limit ourselves to popular issues
but must confront the entire capitalist
system as it stands today and offer al
ternatives."
Radicals. Immediately the word
conjures up images of a gun-toting
Patricia "Tania" Mearstandguerrillas
in Zaire holding Stanford students as
hostages.
But at Stanford, radicalism, how
ever uneasily it rests within the staid
sandstone archways and manicured
gardens of campus life, is conceived of
as critical, reasoned thinking directed
at confronting such issues as the state
of the economy, third world grie
vances and even personal life styles.
The leading forum for radical
thought at Stanford is the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARCJ, founded in the
spring of 1974 after the United Stan
ford Employees went on strike and un
ited a group of people devoted to the
idea of forming an activist organiza
tion.
As one ARC member put it,"I
looked around me and saw that out
there in the 'big world' something was
going wrong — things needed to be
done — and nothing could change if I
continued in the normal liberal 'patch
up' type way."
Three goals
Since its inception, ARC] has been
devoted to eradicating three principle
"isms" — imperialism, sexism and
racism.
"We have a three pronged approach
to these goals," said Larry Litvak, an
active ARC member. "We want to
educate people, involve ourselves in
action and offer people alternative
ways of living their lives."
ARC itself is an alternative organi
zation unlike other campus groups.
"We're a supportive community for
people who are dissatisfied with Stan
ford and want to integrate social ac

tivism into their everyday lives,"
explained Mike Kieschnick, another
ARC member.
Challenging the student body to di
vert its awareness from collegiate
preoccupations to a more worldly, ac
tivist outlook has been one of ARC's
predominant aims. Among ARC ac
tivities last year were a 150-person
demonstration against Marine Corps
recruitment on campus, a benefit to
raise funds for the Inez Garcia and
Joan Little defense funds, a 600-
person demonstration objecting to fi
nancial aid cutbacks and a student
march and sit-in to protest Stanford's
contract to design a communications
satellite for the Shah of Iran's "repres
sive" regime.
Sharp criticism
The contract protest exemplifies
how ARC has drawn sharp criticism
for its actions.

system as it stands today and offer al
ternatives."
Radicals. Immediately the word
conjures up images of a gun-toting
Patricia "Tania" Mearstandguerrillas
in Zaire holding Stanford students as
hostages.
But at Stanford, radicalism, how
ever uneasily it rests within the staid
sandstone archways and manicured
gardens of campus life, is conceived of
as critical, reasoned thinking directed
at confronting such issues as the state
of the economy, third world grie
vances and even personal life styles.
The leading forum for radical
thought at Stanford is the Alliance for
Radical Change (ARCJ, founded in the
spring of 1974 after the United Stan
ford Employees went on strike and un
ited a group of people devoted to the
idea of forming an activist organiza
tion.
As one ARC member put it,"I
looked around me and saw that out
there in the 'big world' something was
going wrong — things needed to be
done — and nothing could change if I
continued in the normal liberal 'patch
up' type way."
Three goals
Since its inception, ARC] has been
devoted to eradicating three principle
"isms" — imperialism, sexism and
racism.
"We have a three pronged approach
to these goals," said Larry Litvak, an
active ARC member. "We want to
educate people, involve ourselves in
action and offer people alternative
ways of living their lives."
ARC itself is an alternative organi
zation unlike other campus groups.
"We're a supportive community for
people who are dissatisfied with Stan
ford and want to integrate social ac

tivism into their everyday lives,"
explained Mike Kieschnick, another
ARC member.
Challenging the student body to di
vert its awareness from collegiate
preoccupations to a more worldly, ac
tivist outlook has been one of ARC's
predominant aims. Among ARC ac
tivities last year were a 150-person
demonstration against Marine Corps
recruitment on campus, a benefit to
raise funds for the Inez Garcia and
Joan Little defense funds, a 600-
person demonstration objecting to fi
nancial aid cutbacks and a student
march and sit-in to protest Stanford's
contract to design a communications
satellite for the Shah of Iran's "repres
sive" regime.
Sharp criticism
The contract protest exemplifies
how ARC has drawn sharp criticism
for its actions.
"They (ARC) are dead wrong," in
sisted Electrical Engineering Prof.
Bruce Lusignan, one of two scientists
working on the project, in a recent
interview. "They said what sounded
best instead of what was accurate."
Lusignan stated that ARC's action
"stopped some students from par
ticipating in the educational aspect of
our program by putting them under
heavy pressure." As to ARC's role in
the university he conceded, "They
have a legitimate role, but 1 wish
they'd be more responsible in their re
search."
Jonathan Marshall, a senior history
major who has written extensively on
radicalism, commented on ARC's
role, "I think ARC is needed, but I
don't think they have reached the stu
dent body to try to present a coherent
philosophy."
Explaining that he was involved in
ARC only during its initial stages,
Marshall said, "In ideological terms,
simplistic Marxism was becoming
dominant in the group, and things we
ren't organized."
Recent criticisms
Students For Equity (SEE), a group
formed to prevent what its members
see as minority aid cut-backs, also
criticized ARC.
According to Josie Jaramillo, SEE
member and an ASSU vice president,
"ARC wasn't telling us all their plans
when they asked for our endorse
ment." SFE endorsed last year's ARC
protest against aid cut-backs and the
Iranian contract and was surprised
when the incident turned into a sit-in,
she implied.
Leftist groups and administrations
have never made congenial bedfel
lows and ARC is no exception for
Stanford administrators.
President Richard Lyman, reflect
ing on last year's controversies in
which ARC was involved, suggested
that more "academic debate rather
than antagonistic bickering" should
have taken place.
ARC member, Seth Foldy, said that
"rational communication is no good if
he (Lyman) doesn't act on what we
suggest."
No impact
ARC's effect on university decisions
seems minimal. "In terms of the direct
impact of the organization I'd have to
say it doesn't have any," stated Pro
vost William Miller. He said he be
lieves that most faculty and administ
ration members "wouldn't even know
what ARC is."

Certainly ARC isn't as visible as its
counterparts in the '60s. "The move
ment is in a process of maturity."
commented Foldy.in comparing ARC
to the last decade's movement. "We
can't limit ourselves to popular issues
but must confront the entire capitalist
system as it stands today and offer al
ternatives."
