"He has erected a multitude of New Of
fices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to
hamss our People, and eat out their sub
stance." - Complaint against King George
111 in the Declamtion of Independence, 177 H.
As many in this country prepare for the
fatuous festivities of the Bicentennial Car
nival of 1976, they would do well to look
back upon the causes of the revolution they
seek so ceremoniously to celebrate.
Should they do so, many of these modern
Neros might discover that little and less of
the liberty they so triumphantly toast re
mains in bastion America.
In particular, they should take note of the
grievance reprinted above, and consider
whether it might not be equally applicable
to the state.' under whose rule they live today.
One needn't scan past the front page of
most newspapers without confronting the
seemingly übiquitous abuses to political
and civil liberties here (and elsewhere)
committed by the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and the FBI.
But buried in the deep recesses of mass
circulation journals and highlighted only in
the more probitive press are stories which,
for their lack of notice if not their actual
portentousness, are yet more troublesome.
These are the violations of economic lib
erty. often not of the corporate giants whose
power to corrupt is sufficient to regulate the
government regulators, but of the cigar
smoker prohibited from enjoying choice
Cuban tobacco, or of the small businessman
harassed by zoning, "safety" and myriad
other restrictions.
The scope of this interference was
brought to light by a recent U.S. News and
World Report article which found that over
50,000 investigators were employed by fed
eral government agencies other than theCIA

and FBI.
Among the fastest growing units is the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
Its mistaken raids and subsequent brutality
against legally innocent parties is a matter
of recent record. But a criticism of the DEA
which concentrates solely on its infringe
ments upon civil liberties begs a pressing
question: what justifies state interruption of

the voluntary (and moral) process of impor
tation and sale of drugs in the first place?
Some 10,000 other investigators aid the
Internal Revenue Service in taking money
from incomes earned through voluntary ex
changes. Additionally, recent scandals
(lumped under the term Watergate) have
blown the cover on repeated IRS harass
ments of politically sensitive individuals,
both through taxation powers and by use of
personal information-gathering authority
which yearly invades the privacy of mill
ions.
Another 7000 U.S. agents inspect meat and
poultry, ostensibly to protect Americans
from dangers of diet (although some re
visionist historians have seen a more sinis
ter motive: the curtailment of operations at
meat plants not in favor in political circles).
Almost 4000 inspect imported goods, pre
sumably either to restrict their entry into a
free market or to impose anti-price
competitive tariffs upon them. More than

1600 putrol U.S. borders, much for the same
purpose, save only that their ignominious
task includes imposing barriers to people as
well as products.
Among the most contemptuous of the
harassments are those carried out under the
1971 federal Occupational Safety and
Health Act (OSHA). This law allows, among
other modes of interference, the search of a
business property without the need for a
warrant.
A recent survey by the National Federa
tion of Independent Business discovered
that OSHA was being used more as a means
to fill inspectors' quotas than as a safeguard
on employe working conditions.
Remarks by business people, the survey
showed, "indicate that the citations and
fines for the most part are not because of any
hazard to health or safety, but are levied
because of failure to properly display a
OSHA poster on the premises, failure to
maintain the records demanded by OSHA,
failure to have coat hangers on toilet doors,
or some other violation of the Labor De
partment regulations that are not related to
safe working conditions."
The result of this apparent quota-filling
on the efficacy of OSHA is indicated by a
July Los Angeles Times article which stated
that job-related deaths continued to rise in
California in 1974 despite a $16 million
budget for the new state OSHA adjunct.
The argument against such agencies,
however, should never rest on the grounds
of monetary cost or effectiveness, but rather
on the principle of violation of individual
liberty. And on this the United States gov
ernment, 200 years after its inception,
stands indicted.

"He has erected a multitude of New Of
fices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to
hamss our People, and eat out their sub
stance." - Complaint against King George
111 in the Declamtion of Independence, 177 H.
As many in this country prepare for the
fatuous festivities of the Bicentennial Car
nival of 1976, they would do well to look
back upon the causes of the revolution they
seek so ceremoniously to celebrate.
Should they do so, many of these modern
Neros might discover that little and less of
the liberty they so triumphantly toast re
mains in bastion America.
In particular, they should take note of the
grievance reprinted above, and consider
whether it might not be equally applicable
to the state.' under whose rule they live today.
One needn't scan past the front page of
most newspapers without confronting the
seemingly übiquitous abuses to political
and civil liberties here (and elsewhere)
committed by the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and the FBI.
But buried in the deep recesses of mass
circulation journals and highlighted only in
the more probitive press are stories which,
for their lack of notice if not their actual
portentousness, are yet more troublesome.
These are the violations of economic lib
erty. often not of the corporate giants whose
power to corrupt is sufficient to regulate the
government regulators, but of the cigar
smoker prohibited from enjoying choice
Cuban tobacco, or of the small businessman
harassed by zoning, "safety" and myriad
other restrictions.
The scope of this interference was
brought to light by a recent U.S. News and
World Report article which found that over
50,000 investigators were employed by fed
eral government agencies other than theCIA

and FBI.
Among the fastest growing units is the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
Its mistaken raids and subsequent brutality
against legally innocent parties is a matter
of recent record. But a criticism of the DEA
which concentrates solely on its infringe
ments upon civil liberties begs a pressing
question: what justifies state interruption of

the voluntary (and moral) process of impor
tation and sale of drugs in the first place?
Some 10,000 other investigators aid the
Internal Revenue Service in taking money
from incomes earned through voluntary ex
changes. Additionally, recent scandals
(lumped under the term Watergate) have
blown the cover on repeated IRS harass
ments of politically sensitive individuals,
both through taxation powers and by use of
personal information-gathering authority
which yearly invades the privacy of mill
ions.
Another 7000 U.S. agents inspect meat and
poultry, ostensibly to protect Americans
from dangers of diet (although some re
visionist historians have seen a more sinis
ter motive: the curtailment of operations at
meat plants not in favor in political circles).
Almost 4000 inspect imported goods, pre
sumably either to restrict their entry into a
free market or to impose anti-price
competitive tariffs upon them. More than

1600 putrol U.S. borders, much for the same
purpose, save only that their ignominious
task includes imposing barriers to people as
well as products.
Among the most contemptuous of the
harassments are those carried out under the
1971 federal Occupational Safety and
Health Act (OSHA). This law allows, among
other modes of interference, the search of a
business property without the need for a
warrant.
A recent survey by the National Federa
tion of Independent Business discovered
that OSHA was being used more as a means
to fill inspectors' quotas than as a safeguard
on employe working conditions.
Remarks by business people, the survey
showed, "indicate that the citations and
fines for the most part are not because of any
hazard to health or safety, but are levied
because of failure to properly display a
OSHA poster on the premises, failure to
maintain the records demanded by OSHA,
failure to have coat hangers on toilet doors,
or some other violation of the Labor De
partment regulations that are not related to
safe working conditions."
The result of this apparent quota-filling
on the efficacy of OSHA is indicated by a
July Los Angeles Times article which stated
that job-related deaths continued to rise in
California in 1974 despite a $16 million
budget for the new state OSHA adjunct.
The argument against such agencies,
however, should never rest on the grounds
of monetary cost or effectiveness, but rather
on the principle of violation of individual
liberty. And on this the United States gov
ernment, 200 years after its inception,
stands indicted.

"He has erected a multitude of New Of
fices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to
hamss our People, and eat out their sub
stance." - Complaint against King George
111 in the Declamtion of Independence, 177 H.
As many in this country prepare for the
fatuous festivities of the Bicentennial Car
nival of 1976, they would do well to look
back upon the causes of the revolution they
seek so ceremoniously to celebrate.
Should they do so, many of these modern
Neros might discover that little and less of
the liberty they so triumphantly toast re
mains in bastion America.
In particular, they should take note of the
grievance reprinted above, and consider
whether it might not be equally applicable
to the state.' under whose rule they live today.
One needn't scan past the front page of
most newspapers without confronting the
seemingly übiquitous abuses to political
and civil liberties here (and elsewhere)
committed by the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and the FBI.
But buried in the deep recesses of mass
circulation journals and highlighted only in
the more probitive press are stories which,
for their lack of notice if not their actual
portentousness, are yet more troublesome.
These are the violations of economic lib
erty. often not of the corporate giants whose
power to corrupt is sufficient to regulate the
government regulators, but of the cigar
smoker prohibited from enjoying choice
Cuban tobacco, or of the small businessman
harassed by zoning, "safety" and myriad
other restrictions.
The scope of this interference was
brought to light by a recent U.S. News and
World Report article which found that over
50,000 investigators were employed by fed
eral government agencies other than theCIA

and FBI.
Among the fastest growing units is the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
Its mistaken raids and subsequent brutality
against legally innocent parties is a matter
of recent record. But a criticism of the DEA
which concentrates solely on its infringe
ments upon civil liberties begs a pressing
question: what justifies state interruption of

the voluntary (and moral) process of impor
tation and sale of drugs in the first place?
Some 10,000 other investigators aid the
Internal Revenue Service in taking money
from incomes earned through voluntary ex
changes. Additionally, recent scandals
(lumped under the term Watergate) have
blown the cover on repeated IRS harass
ments of politically sensitive individuals,
both through taxation powers and by use of
personal information-gathering authority
which yearly invades the privacy of mill
ions.
Another 7000 U.S. agents inspect meat and
poultry, ostensibly to protect Americans
from dangers of diet (although some re
visionist historians have seen a more sinis
ter motive: the curtailment of operations at
meat plants not in favor in political circles).
Almost 4000 inspect imported goods, pre
sumably either to restrict their entry into a
free market or to impose anti-price
competitive tariffs upon them. More than

1600 putrol U.S. borders, much for the same
purpose, save only that their ignominious
task includes imposing barriers to people as
well as products.
Among the most contemptuous of the
harassments are those carried out under the
1971 federal Occupational Safety and
Health Act (OSHA). This law allows, among
other modes of interference, the search of a
business property without the need for a
warrant.
A recent survey by the National Federa
tion of Independent Business discovered
that OSHA was being used more as a means
to fill inspectors' quotas than as a safeguard
on employe working conditions.
Remarks by business people, the survey
showed, "indicate that the citations and
fines for the most part are not because of any
hazard to health or safety, but are levied
because of failure to properly display a
OSHA poster on the premises, failure to
maintain the records demanded by OSHA,
failure to have coat hangers on toilet doors,
or some other violation of the Labor De
partment regulations that are not related to
safe working conditions."
The result of this apparent quota-filling
on the efficacy of OSHA is indicated by a
July Los Angeles Times article which stated
that job-related deaths continued to rise in
California in 1974 despite a $16 million
budget for the new state OSHA adjunct.
The argument against such agencies,
however, should never rest on the grounds
of monetary cost or effectiveness, but rather
on the principle of violation of individual
liberty. And on this the United States gov
ernment, 200 years after its inception,
stands indicted.
