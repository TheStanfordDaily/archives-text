# Small programs can make big contributions

In the Oct. 7 Daily, William
Ross wrote a commentary, "Cost
Gluts: the Survival of the Fittest,"
in which he argued that on ba
lance the University during
these times of economic
stringency has no choice but to
cut weak and peripheral prog
rams in order to strengthen its
more important ones.
On the surface, this seems a
sensible approach, and Ross
quotes Arthurßienenstock, vice
provost for faculty affairs, to
underline and strengthen his

view that in lean times the pat
tern of "survival of the fittest" is
the most natural and rational
stance to choose with regard to
administrative support for Uni
versity educational programs.
But one would think in a con
temporary institution of higher
learning that such a philosophy
would gain little support. One
need only think of tin; barbaric
results that would ensue if we
applied such a doctrine to
medicine, old age or the arts.
What is important?
Certainly in all developed cul
tures there are artistic and intel
lectual disciplines that to many
— in fact even to a majority of
people — seem weak and
peripheral. A mime troupe ap
pears less important than a
theatre company, a chamber
music group less important than
a symphony orchestra, print
making less important than
painting — or to bring the com
parison home in the context of
the present campus discussion,
architecture seems less impor
tant than the other areas of en
gineering, and training in
speech seems less important
than the study of law.
In fact, only a very small
group of persons directly in
terested in the field being consi
dered for closure may even
speak out in defense of the prog
ram. The majority will merely
accept the current educational
trends as to which intellectual
or artistic disciplines are the
most important.
Is speech peripheral?
For the sake of argument, take
the seemingly simple matter of
speech training, that Ross (men
tioning an interview with Ray
Baccbetti. vice president for
budget and planning) uses as an
example of the appropriate
pruning of programs that was

pursued under the Budget Ad
justment Program of 1969-74.
It seemed peripheral and
weak and therefore asked to be
cut. but now we find (L)ailv, Oct.
9) that students are not obtain
ing appropriate training in
speech, the Stanford Debate
team finds itself in difficulty
fielding teams against other
major schools, and the Law
School must attempt to supply
its students with speech training
without being able to call on ex
perts in the field.
In fact, as the Daily pointed
out in its article on debate, an
undergraduate special has just
been instituted by a star debater
and graduate of Georgetown
University to offer some solid
training in the field (obviously
at little cost to the University),
and one can only hope that the
University may be becoming
aware that in cutting what
seemed a weak and peripheral
program, it also cut one of the
most necessary fields of study
for a full participation in pre
sent day public life.
President Richard Lyman has
spoken, most recently in his
speech to the Academic Council
on Oct. 3. about the need for
quality in the discussion and
debate of campus and public is
sues. and it is to the formulation
and presentation of such issues
that training in rhetoric, debate
and public address is addres
sed.
Poor support
There are many areas of in
struction that may appear weak
and peripheral because they
have a small number of majors
and are poorly supported by the
administration.
It is too easy further to reduce
support, say that the program is
a poor one. and then cut it, only
to realize later that though an

area or a field of study may be
small, it may be absolutely es
sential in adding depth, dimen
sion and expertise to the train
ing of persons in other areas, as
well as turning out a limited
number of well trained persons
that will maintain this Universi
ty's participation in the field.
I think that the University
should look carefully at each
area or field and not equate its
importance to the University on
the basis of a seeming weakness
and peripheral position within

the present University organiza
tion.
Such small but vital programs
within the artistic-intellectual
educational community should
be strengthened and sustained,
not cut off with a sense of ac
complishment based on a
cavalier belief in the Darwinian
doctrine of "the survival of the
fittest."

I think that the University
should look carefully at each
area or field and not equate its
importance to the University on
the basis of a seeming weakness

the present University organiza

educational community should
be strengthened and sustained,
not cut off with a sense of ac

cavalier belief in the Darwinian

In the Oct. 7 Daily, William
Ross wrote a commentary, "Cost
Gluts: the Survival of the Fittest,"
in which he argued that on ba
lance the University during
these times of economic
stringency has no choice but to
cut weak and peripheral prog
rams in order to strengthen its
more important ones.
On the surface, this seems a
sensible approach, and Ross
quotes Arthurßienenstock, vice
provost for faculty affairs, to
underline and strengthen his

view that in lean times the pat
tern of "survival of the fittest" is
the most natural and rational
stance to choose with regard to
administrative support for Uni
versity educational programs.
But one would think in a con
temporary institution of higher
learning that such a philosophy
would gain little support. One
need only think of tin; barbaric
results that would ensue if we
applied such a doctrine to
medicine, old age or the arts.
What is important?
Certainly in all developed cul
tures there are artistic and intel
lectual disciplines that to many
— in fact even to a majority of
people — seem weak and
peripheral. A mime troupe ap
pears less important than a
theatre company, a chamber
music group less important than
a symphony orchestra, print
making less important than
painting — or to bring the com
parison home in the context of
the present campus discussion,
architecture seems less impor
tant than the other areas of en
gineering, and training in
speech seems less important
than the study of law.
In fact, only a very small
group of persons directly in
terested in the field being consi
dered for closure may even
speak out in defense of the prog
ram. The majority will merely
accept the current educational
trends as to which intellectual
or artistic disciplines are the
most important.
Is speech peripheral?
For the sake of argument, take
the seemingly simple matter of
speech training, that Ross (men
tioning an interview with Ray
Baccbetti. vice president for
budget and planning) uses as an
example of the appropriate
pruning of programs that was

pursued under the Budget Ad
justment Program of 1969-74.
It seemed peripheral and
weak and therefore asked to be
cut. but now we find (L)ailv, Oct.
9) that students are not obtain
ing appropriate training in
speech, the Stanford Debate
team finds itself in difficulty
fielding teams against other
major schools, and the Law
School must attempt to supply
its students with speech training
without being able to call on ex
perts in the field.
In fact, as the Daily pointed
out in its article on debate, an
undergraduate special has just
been instituted by a star debater
and graduate of Georgetown
University to offer some solid
training in the field (obviously
at little cost to the University),
and one can only hope that the
University may be becoming
aware that in cutting what
seemed a weak and peripheral
program, it also cut one of the
most necessary fields of study
for a full participation in pre
sent day public life.
President Richard Lyman has
spoken, most recently in his
speech to the Academic Council
on Oct. 3. about the need for
quality in the discussion and
debate of campus and public is
sues. and it is to the formulation
and presentation of such issues
that training in rhetoric, debate
and public address is addres
sed.
Poor support
There are many areas of in
struction that may appear weak
and peripheral because they
have a small number of majors
and are poorly supported by the
administration.
It is too easy further to reduce
support, say that the program is
a poor one. and then cut it, only
to realize later that though an

area or a field of study may be
small, it may be absolutely es
sential in adding depth, dimen
sion and expertise to the train
ing of persons in other areas, as
well as turning out a limited
number of well trained persons
that will maintain this Universi

Poor support
There are many areas of in
struction that may appear weak
and peripheral because they
have a small number of majors
and are poorly supported by the
administration.
It is too easy further to reduce
support, say that the program is
a poor one. and then cut it, only
to realize later that though an

area or a field of study may be
small, it may be absolutely es
sential in adding depth, dimen
sion and expertise to the train
ing of persons in other areas, as
well as turning out a limited
number of well trained persons
that will maintain this Universi
ty's participation in the field.
I think that the University
should look carefully at each
area or field and not equate its
importance to the University on
the basis of a seeming weakness
and peripheral position within

the present University organiza
tion.
Such small but vital programs
within the artistic-intellectual
educational community should
be strengthened and sustained,
not cut off with a sense of ac
complishment based on a
cavalier belief in the Darwinian
doctrine of "the survival of the
fittest."

In the Oct. 7 Daily, William
Ross wrote a commentary, "Cost
Gluts: the Survival of the Fittest,"
in which he argued that on ba
lance the University during
these times of economic
stringency has no choice but to
cut weak and peripheral prog
rams in order to strengthen its
more important ones.
On the surface, this seems a
sensible approach, and Ross
quotes Arthurßienenstock, vice
provost for faculty affairs, to
underline and strengthen his

view that in lean times the pat
tern of "survival of the fittest" is
the most natural and rational
stance to choose with regard to
administrative support for Uni
versity educational programs.
But one would think in a con
temporary institution of higher
learning that such a philosophy
would gain little support. One
need only think of tin; barbaric
results that would ensue if we
applied such a doctrine to
medicine, old age or the arts.
What is important?
Certainly in all developed cul
tures there are artistic and intel
lectual disciplines that to many
— in fact even to a majority of
people — seem weak and
peripheral. A mime troupe ap
pears less important than a
theatre company, a chamber
music group less important than
a symphony orchestra, print
making less important than
painting — or to bring the com
parison home in the context of
the present campus discussion,
architecture seems less impor
tant than the other areas of en
gineering, and training in
speech seems less important
than the study of law.
In fact, only a very small
group of persons directly in
terested in the field being consi
dered for closure may even
speak out in defense of the prog
ram. The majority will merely
accept the current educational
trends as to which intellectual
or artistic disciplines are the
most important.
Is speech peripheral?
For the sake of argument, take
the seemingly simple matter of
speech training, that Ross (men
tioning an interview with Ray
Baccbetti. vice president for
budget and planning) uses as an
example of the appropriate
pruning of programs that was

pursued under the Budget Ad
justment Program of 1969-74.
It seemed peripheral and
weak and therefore asked to be
cut. but now we find (L)ailv, Oct.
9) that students are not obtain
ing appropriate training in
speech, the Stanford Debate
team finds itself in difficulty
fielding teams against other
major schools, and the Law
School must attempt to supply
its students with speech training
without being able to call on ex
perts in the field.
In fact, as the Daily pointed
out in its article on debate, an
undergraduate special has just
been instituted by a star debater
and graduate of Georgetown
University to offer some solid
training in the field (obviously
at little cost to the University),
and one can only hope that the
University may be becoming
aware that in cutting what
seemed a weak and peripheral
program, it also cut one of the
most necessary fields of study
for a full participation in pre
sent day public life.
President Richard Lyman has
spoken, most recently in his
speech to the Academic Council
on Oct. 3. about the need for
quality in the discussion and
debate of campus and public is
sues. and it is to the formulation
and presentation of such issues
that training in rhetoric, debate
and public address is addres
sed.
