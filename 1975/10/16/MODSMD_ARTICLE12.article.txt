More on Buckley
Editor:
In my recent two part com
mentary (Daily, Oct. 9 and 10)
on William F. Buckley's talk
here, I expressed myself rather
vehemently and leveled
charges at Buckley that 1 did not
fully support in my column.
Some have pointed out to me
that the tone of the piece over
shot its content, and I ugree.
1 did speak hastily in parts ot
that comment, mainly because I
was angry at Buckley for how he
chose to approach his topic. My
irritation was caused, in part, by
Buckley's complaint against
F.A. Hayek that the latter re
fuses to show contempt against
some of those he criticizes.
Buckley did not like Hayek's
civilized tone toward Hayek's
adversaries. Buckley would
have wanted Hayek to be more
aware of the underhandedness
of some of those whom Hayek
finds in error.
I, in turn, tried to accommo
date Buckley's desire for more
awareness of moral transgres
sions within intellectual,
theoretical disputations.
But 1 admit to having overshot
the point by charging Buckley
with transgressions 1 did not
substantiate in my article. There
is no excuse for this, although
there could be an explanation â€”
part of which I have tried to
provide here.
Indeed, 1 think it is more im
portant to discuss the soundness
of Buckley's, Hayek's and
others' ideas than the possible
improprieties involved in ap
proaching the discussion.

Energy problems
Editor:
Mark Funk's story on Jimmv
Carter's energy platform (Daily,
Oct. 13), omitted two crucial
statements made by Carter. As
energy policy is an important
concern of mine, I took particu
lar note of Carter's statement.
After placing first priority on
coal to satisfy short-term needs.
Carter followed immediately
with statements encouraging
conservation of energy and the
development of solar and other
alternative sources.
Then, and only then, did he
acknowledge that nuclear
power would have to take up
whatever slack remained.
The issue of nuclear power is
of particular importance to
Californians. We have the op
portunity for a real voice (for a
change) in setting energy policy
with our votes on the Nuclear
Safeguards Initiative in June
1976.
We also have a rare opportun
ity to hear expert testimony for
and against nuclear power in
the form of hearings of the
California Assembly Committee
on Energy and Diminishing
Materials.
Chaired by Assemblyman
Charles Warren (D-Los
Angeles), these hearings com
menced on Oct. 14 and will con
tinue into December in Sac
ramento.
I encourage the Daily to re
port regularly on testimony
given at the Warren hearings as
a means of informing readers on
matters vitally affecting them.
