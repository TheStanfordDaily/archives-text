It is time that those who attend our football
games remind themselves of basic standards of
decency and courtesy. At Stanford, an educa
tional institution, students do not boo instructors,
and instructors do not boo students for making
less than brilliant remarks in a classroom or
seminar.
In short, we do not boo one another. This
applies equally to those fellow students and fel
low instructors (coaches) who are part of the
football team. I am very happy to see on our
playing fields students whom I know from my
classes and not paid gladiators performing
under the command of a Woody Hayes-type
character.
For the record, I have been watching closely
college football for 28 years, and have seen some
outstanding quarterbacks, like F'aul Hornung,
and Bob Criese. as well as the recnt Stanford
stars. In my view Mike Cordova is one of the few
really talented and promising quarterbacks that I
have seen during that period. But this is not the
main point; elementary courtesy and decency
applies to all students whether you think them
able or not.
Don't forget courtesy
What goes for our student-athletes goes also for
our coach-instructors. They are entitled to the
same courtesy that we extend to anv other in

structor on campus. Whether we agree with a
coach or not, we do not subject him to public
abuse. This is Stanford, not Green Bay.
In the light of the above I deplore both the
inappropriate column by Tim Ferguson in Mon
day's Daily as well as the tasteless remarks by a
couple of undergraduates in Monday's Palo Alto
Times.
For a bunch of spoiled students to pay their
way into the stadium in order to boo their fellow
students and instructors; that is not free speech or
free enterprise; that is plain disgusting.
Support Christiansen
Though this is not the main point. I submit that
Coach Jack Christiansen is doing a fine job by the
following simple criterion: how many schools of
equal size and similar academic standards have
a football program of the same quality as that of
Stanford?
Booing your fellow students and instructors
violates basic standards of decency and courtesy
at an educational institution. I am sure that the
vast majority of students, faculty and adminis
trators will not agree with Ferguson when he
claims that such deplorable conduct is the "cur
rent temperament"; and it is incumbent upon
right-minded people to see to it that our players
and coaches should not be subjected to it.
