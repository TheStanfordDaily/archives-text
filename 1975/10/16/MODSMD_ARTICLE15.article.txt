## 'Cowboy Bill' Dickinson: the 'perfect' prof 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Geology Prof. William
Dickinson is a Stanford man
from way back — he got a
B.S. in engineering here in
1952, got a master's, and
after a two-year stint some
where in the Air Force.he got
his Ph.D. in geology here in
1958. That same year he
started teaching here — and
now he's a full professor.
Dickinson, or "Cowboy
Bill" as his devoted graduate
students affectionately call
him, also epitomizes the
"perfect" professor; his stu
dents and colleagues say he
is an excellent lecturer, a de
voted teacher, a prolific re
searcher and publisher. He's
one of the top five people in
sedimentary geology and
tectonics in the country —
possibly the world.
In spite of all the superla
tives, Dickinson is a very
modest man — he's reluctant
to talk about all his ac
complishments.
"Heck, I don't know,"he
grins, when asked about his
feats, and his face and eyes
light up like neon. Secretly
he loves every minute of it.
But he says he lqves his

work and calls it "fun.
"I don't feel pressed," he
continues. "I don't feel the
'publish or perish' syndrome
as I enjoy writing and like to
be a part of the total effort. If
you don't write about the
things you're doing, you
don't really participate."
He says he believes that
Stanford demands are

"reasonable," but says that
the University "can use fa
culty who do only research,
or who only teach. The ideal
person is one who enjoys a
mixture of both, but it's a
mistake to assume that all
can do their best with the
same mix."
Dickinson is well aware
that not all people can reach
their creative peak in their
career at the same time, and
for this reason he believes

that the University needs
flexibility.
"The key is to hold down
the right number of courses
so that research commit
ments don't suffer. It's har
dest for a young professor to
adjust (he's 45) — to figure
out how much of each he or
she can do and make good
use of time. It's a talent and
takes a while."
It took some time before
Dickinson was in a position
to look at his life and abilities
so objectively. He says that it
took a while to develop a
reputation because he had
spent so much time in the
same place. He says he
"didn't have the challenge"
of working in different envi
ronments, but "it was a chal
lenge to establish myself
among my former profes
sors" who became his col
leagues.
He admits that "it's impos
sible to gauge your own sta
ture," but his reputation goes
unquestioned. He describes
his specialty, plate tectonics,
by saying "it has given us an
understanding of world set
tings and faults like the San
Andreas. There are 10 to 20
recognized 'plates' and tec-,
tonics show how segments
move with respect to each

other."
"The American and
Pacific plates are sliding —
that's the San Andreas. Stan
ford is on the American
plate, and the Santa Cruz
mountains are on the
Pacific."
Does he remember the
1906 earthquake that devas
tated San Francisco and de
stroyed much of then
newly-built Stanford?

"No, but I remember Pearl
Harbor."
Will there by another
quake?
"There'll be one. If we have
any luck, we'll be in a posi
tion to predict it as
geophysics is better able to
make critical observations.
Maybe we'll have warning
when it hits."
Dickinson became in
terested in geology when he

took Geology 1 here in the
late 19405. "Before that. I
was just going to school."
But those students most
devoted to him don't feel that
they're "just going to
school," as working with
Dickinson gives a feeling of
total commitment and in
volvement.
Ken Helmold, a Ph.D. can
didate in geology, speaks for
most of Dickinson's students
when he says, "if you're his
advisee, he takes a lot of in
terest personally and
scholastically. If you're one
of his boys or girls, you've
got it made."
Helmold also says that
Dickinson is an "excellent
lecturer — one of thebest I've
ever had. He's such a good
speaker that sometimes he
comes to class unprepared
and just talks. But he gets
away with it and it always
comes out well because he's
so knowledgeable. He's a
good actor — he's got
charisma."
His colleagues also rave
about him. Ernie Rich, as
sociate dean of the School of
Earth Sciences says "he's a
grand fellow — a very out
standing teacher easy to get
along with — a most helpful
