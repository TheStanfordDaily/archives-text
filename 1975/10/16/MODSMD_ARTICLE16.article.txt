### Patty Fels 
I recently read an article in 'Time' magazine (Oct. 13) which dealt
with the ongoing Patty Hearst story. Along with the article was a
photograph that had appeared in the Daily. It was of Patty being
escorted along the corridors of the Stanford Medical Center during
her examination there recently. Sure enough, the photo credit was
"Dun Cox -Stanford Daily." How much did 'Time' pay either the
Daily or Cox for the privilege of using that photo? -S.H.
That very photograph has catapulted Don Cox, formerly a man
of little fame and lesser wealth, into new heights of glory. The
Associated Press was the first to buy the picture — for $100. It was
also sold to the San Francisco Chronicle ($25), the San Francisco
Examiner ($25) and United Press International ($3O).
Cox still isn't sure how much he will get from Time, which pays
by the inch, but the minimum payment for pictures is $50. And he
hopes to sell the picture to other publications — he may acquire an
agent in New York to handle the requests which pour in daily.
Cox is humble about his accomplishment, and ascribes it to
"divine intervention." He happened to be the only still photo
grapher standing in the corridor which Hearst walked down. In
the other corridor, 25 newsmen and photographers waited for
over three hours — and never got a glimpse of their subject.

I'm wondering whether I should turn off my office lights when I
leave for a short period of time. Someone told me that it takes as
much energy to turn a fluorescent light on as it does to keep it
running for an hour.ls this true? What exactly are the tmde-offs
involved here? -R.G.
When you turn on a fluorescent light, a starter inside the light
releases electrons. Each time the light is turned on, the starter
loses electrons, until eventually the whole tube must be replaced.
However, if you leave the light on, you burn energy, but don't lost
electrons.
With the present energy rates.it is more economical to leave the
fluorescent lights burning if you're going to be gone for less than
15 minutes, according to Barney McCloskey at PG&E. However,
incandescent lights should always be turned out whenever you
leave.

In the paid /xirking lot behind the Main Library, I noticed that the
machine at the entrance to the lot will accept both pass cards and ,
money. I would like to know exactly who in the University has been
issued these cards. -S.W.
The only people with pass cards are the policemen who occasion
ally must fix the machine. On those doleful days when it isn't
working, they will stand at the machine, taking money and then
operating it with the cards.
