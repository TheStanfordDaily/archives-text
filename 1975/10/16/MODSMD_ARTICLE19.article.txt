# Fade-out of the 'flower children' brings hard times to head shops
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
"head sh6ps" that blossomed
with the flower children of the
'60s are still dispensing rolling
papers and pipes to those who
graze contentedly on "grass,"
but many operators are no
longer looking at the world
through rose-colored glasses.
"It's a dying business," said
Albert "Blue" Kelly, glancing
around the store filled with
psychedelic posters and
marijuana pipes. "What you're
seeing is the ghost of what was."
Kelly, a 25-year-old part-time
musician and clerk, at The Alter
Ego, believes time has simply
passed the head shops by. His
head shop is one of the last
half-dozen on Hollywood
Boulevard.
"The people who started the
whole thing are in their late 20s
or 30s now," he said. "And
they're into homes and pools
and the whole-middle class

thing."
Others say the younger gen
eration has come full circle to
the narcotic of their elders — al
cohol.
Head shops sell the
paraphernalia of drug use —
rolling papers and pipes for
smoking marijuana; glass vials
and tiny spoons for snorting
cocaine.
They also offer incense to
mask the smell of "pot, "T-shirts
bearing logos like "Smoke Col
umbian" and "Things Go Better
With Coke," and a variety of
posters, paintings and unusual
lamps to stare at when you're
"stoned."
Part of the head shops' woes
stem from the fact that they are
no longer the sole purveyors of
drug equipment.
Open sales
Rolling papers are sold
openly in drugstores and
supermarkets. Roach clips and

posters are part of the inventory
in most record stores.
The head shop customers are
a mix of tourists, teenyboppers
and seasoned drug users.
"We get the 12-to-14 year-old
group that's just discovering
head shops and think every
thing's great." Kelly said. "Then
there's people like you and me
who just come in for the neces
sities and split."
Head shop owners say they
have few problems with the
police, even though marijuana
possession is illegal and cocaine
possession a felony.
"Their business'
"We sell them the pipes and
what they do with them is their
business," said Ken Strause,
co-owner of Fatima's Chillum,
which offers "Mind and Body
Notions."
Hollywood police Sgt. Ken
neth Bernard said officers gen
erally leave the head shops
alone.
"Pipes and papers per se are
not a violation to possess. If they
sold contraband we'd raid them,
yes," he said. "I'm not aware of
them selling to anyone under 18,
but the kids get it. I don't know
how."
No hassles
Jon Alexander, a 24-year-old
clerk at The Scenter Gift Gar
den, agreed that police don't
hassle the head shops.
"The guv on the beat will stop
in every once in a while and tell

us to turn the music down but
that's about it,"he said. "Of
course, if we say it's a marijuana
pipe we've got trouble."
Alexander said cocaine, also
known as "flake," "lady" and
"snow," has become more popu
lar.
"The big thing in drugs now is
coke," he said. "We always
know when there's a shipment
in town because everyone comes
in for vials to snort it out of."
40 flavors
Rolling papers, which come
in more than 40 flavors includ
ing banana and papaya, are the
shops' most popular item.
Marijuana pipes run second
and roach clips, which are used
to hold a partially burned
marijuana cigarette or "roach,"
are a close third.
Marijuana pipes come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, in
cluding special glass models
known as "carburetors" or
"bhongs." These allow the
smoke to build up inside the
pipe before the smoker inhales,
thus giving him abigger "hit" or
quantity of intoxicating fumes.
"Carburetors are the biggest
seller right now," said Strause,
holding up a purple, red and
gold model with glass coils run
ning up from a metal bowl.
"People like to watch the smoke
going around and around."

musician and clerk, at The Alter
Ego, believes time has simply
passed the head shops by. His
head shop is one of the last
half-dozen on Hollywood
Boulevard.
"The people who started the
whole thing are in their late 20s
or 30s now," he said. "And
they're into homes and pools
and the whole-middle class

thing."
Others say the younger gen
eration has come full circle to
the narcotic of their elders — al
cohol.
Head shops sell the
paraphernalia of drug use —
rolling papers and pipes for
smoking marijuana; glass vials
and tiny spoons for snorting
cocaine.
They also offer incense to
mask the smell of "pot, "T-shirts
bearing logos like "Smoke Col
umbian" and "Things Go Better
With Coke," and a variety of
posters, paintings and unusual
lamps to stare at when you're
"stoned."
Part of the head shops' woes
stem from the fact that they are
no longer the sole purveyors of
drug equipment.
Open sales
Rolling papers are sold
openly in drugstores and
supermarkets. Roach clips and

posters are part of the inventory
in most record stores.
The head shop customers are
a mix of tourists, teenyboppers
and seasoned drug users.
"We get the 12-to-14 year-old
group that's just discovering
head shops and think every
thing's great." Kelly said. "Then
there's people like you and me
who just come in for the neces
sities and split."
Head shop owners say they
have few problems with the
police, even though marijuana
possession is illegal and cocaine
possession a felony.

"We sell them the pipes and
what they do with them is their
business," said Ken Strause,
co-owner of Fatima's Chillum,
which offers "Mind and Body

Hollywood police Sgt. Ken
neth Bernard said officers gen
erally leave the head shops
alone.
"Pipes and papers per se are
not a violation to possess. If they
sold contraband we'd raid them,
yes," he said. "I'm not aware of
them selling to anyone under 18,
but the kids get it. I don't know
how."
No hassles
Jon Alexander, a 24-year-old
clerk at The Scenter Gift Gar
den, agreed that police don't
hassle the head shops.
"The guv on the beat will stop
in every once in a while and tell

us to turn the music down but
that's about it,"he said. "Of
course, if we say it's a marijuana
pipe we've got trouble."
Alexander said cocaine, also
known as "flake," "lady" and
"snow," has become more popu
lar.
"The big thing in drugs now is
coke," he said. "We always
know when there's a shipment
in town because everyone comes
in for vials to snort it out of."
40 flavors

in more than 40 flavors includ

shops' most popular item.
Marijuana pipes run second

to hold a partially burned
marijuana cigarette or "roach,"
are a close third.
Marijuana pipes come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, in
cluding special glass models
known as "carburetors" or
"bhongs." These allow the
smoke to build up inside the
pipe before the smoker inhales,
thus giving him abigger "hit" or
quantity of intoxicating fumes.
"Carburetors are the biggest

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
"head sh6ps" that blossomed
with the flower children of the

rolling papers and pipes for
smoking marijuana; glass vials
and tiny spoons for snorting
cocaine.
They also offer incense to
mask the smell of "pot, "T-shirts
bearing logos like "Smoke Col
umbian" and "Things Go Better
With Coke," and a variety of
posters, paintings and unusual
lamps to stare at when you're
"stoned."
Part of the head shops' woes
stem from the fact that they are
no longer the sole purveyors of
drug equipment.
Open sales
Rolling papers are sold
openly in drugstores and
supermarkets. Roach clips and

posters are part of the inventory
in most record stores.
The head shop customers are
a mix of tourists, teenyboppers
and seasoned drug users.
"We get the 12-to-14 year-old
group that's just discovering
head shops and think every
thing's great." Kelly said. "Then
there's people like you and me
who just come in for the neces
sities and split."
Head shop owners say they
have few problems with the
police, even though marijuana
possession is illegal and cocaine
possession a felony.
"Their business'
"We sell them the pipes and
what they do with them is their
business," said Ken Strause,
co-owner of Fatima's Chillum,
which offers "Mind and Body
Notions."
Hollywood police Sgt. Ken
neth Bernard said officers gen
erally leave the head shops
alone.
"Pipes and papers per se are
not a violation to possess. If they
sold contraband we'd raid them,
yes," he said. "I'm not aware of
them selling to anyone under 18,
but the kids get it. I don't know
how."
No hassles
Jon Alexander, a 24-year-old
clerk at The Scenter Gift Gar
den, agreed that police don't
hassle the head shops.
"The guv on the beat will stop
in every once in a while and tell

us to turn the music down but
that's about it,"he said. "Of
course, if we say it's a marijuana
pipe we've got trouble."
Alexander said cocaine, also
known as "flake," "lady" and
"snow," has become more popu
lar.
"The big thing in drugs now is
coke," he said. "We always
know when there's a shipment
in town because everyone comes
in for vials to snort it out of."
40 flavors
Rolling papers, which come
in more than 40 flavors includ
ing banana and papaya, are the
shops' most popular item.
Marijuana pipes run second
and roach clips, which are used
to hold a partially burned
marijuana cigarette or "roach,"
are a close third.
Marijuana pipes come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, in
cluding special glass models
known as "carburetors" or
"bhongs." These allow the
smoke to build up inside the
pipe before the smoker inhales,
thus giving him abigger "hit" or
quantity of intoxicating fumes.
"Carburetors are the biggest
seller right now," said Strause,
holding up a purple, red and
gold model with glass coils run
ning up from a metal bowl.
"People like to watch the smoke
going around and around."
