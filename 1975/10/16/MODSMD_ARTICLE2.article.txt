# Extra-departmental programs
## Panel recommends independence 
### LIZ HUFFERD 
SWOPSI, SCIRE and the Under
graduate Specials Program should
remain autonomous, according to the
final report of the Ad Hoc Panel on the
Future of Extradepartmental Prog
rams (EDP).
The panel, appointed by Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Cibbs,
said in the report that EDP affiliation
with the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies (ODUS) is. and
would continue to be, acceptable.
However, the report states, "many
people associated with these prog
rams believe strongly that the imposi
tion of further administrative controls
will stifle the innovative aspects of the
programs, particularly in SWOPSI
and SCIRE.
"It is essential that future adminis
trative arrangements for the EDPs re
spect their student centeredness, their
innovative mode of operation and
their cross-disciplinary orientation,"
said the report.
Needs and wants
Other problems recognized in the
report include: the EDPs' need for a
stablebudget. the importance of main
taining an assistant to the dean or an
associate dean to administer the prog
rams, and the possibility of student
staffing for the KDPs.
The final report recommends that
the EDPs have a "stable financial base
on which to operate." SWOPSI cur
rently has a $25,000 per year budget.

SCI RE's budget was cut from $25,000
to $13,000 last year.
SWOPSI, SCIRE and the Under
graduate Specials Program have been
financed by the reserve funds of the
ODIJS budget since their establish
ment six years ago, explained Michael
C.losson, member of the Ad Hoc panel
and assistant dean of undergraduate
studies.
Currently, the dean of under
graduate studies recommends the
amount to be spent on EDPs to the pro
vost who approves or rejects the re
commendation.
"There is a hassle every year about
whether the EDP budget is going to be
cut or not," said Closson.
'Terrible'
"It's terrible to have an ongoing
program depend on largess year in
and year out." he continued. "The
people in these prog rams fight annual
battles, and they want to be recog
nized as enduring parts of the univer
sity."
The panel also recommended that,
"a plan whereby the directorship of
each program is shared by a half-time
student and a half-time professional
would further accomplish student
participation in the programs while
sustaining the necessary professional
leadership." in the staff.
Closson said that the student
staffing plans were still "hazy" and
wouldn't materialize until "at least
next fall."

The final report of the Ad Hoc Panel
is the beginning of a review and re
newal process in the EDPs. Later this
month, the Committee of Under
graduate Studies (C-US) will discuss
the renewal of the ASSU charges
which authorize SWOPSI, SCIRE and

the Undergraduate Specials Program.
C-US will then make recommenda
tions about the future of the EDPs to
the ASSU Senate. The meeting will
probably take place in December, ac
cording to Closson.
