# All life forms are created equal
## 'Biocentrists' urge greater sensitivity to environment

SAN FRANCISCO (Pacific
News Service) — Consider the
San Francisco flutist who makes
music with turkeys. He plays
certain notes; the birds stretch
their wings, expand theirglands
and gobble at various pitches
and volumes. He has also prac
ticed with bob whites, ex
changed tunes with kangaroo
rats and plans to improvise with
wolves.
Or consider the young Cana
dian who recently climbed atop
a sperm whale in waters off the
Northern California coast, pur
posefully spoiling the efforts of
Russian whalers who aimed to

harpoon the undersized mam
mal.
And consider Ponderosa
Pines, a West Coast environ
mentalist, who adopted his
totem name to "remind people
that if we trample on the rights
of flora and fauna, eventually
certain species will become ex
tinct."
All three illustrate a new sen
sitivity to the environment, cal
led biocentric consciousness,
Biocentricity rejects the no
tion that what is good for man is
good for all, and that short
sighted human considerations
must be placed above those of

other life forms. It places equal
value on all forms of life — with
the real fear that continued
preoccupation with strictly
human needs will destroy the
planet.
"What humans have failed to
realize is that we are totally
connected to all other species,"
says Jerry Mander, organizer of
successful campaigns to deter
the development of the super
sonic transport system and dam
construction in the Grand Ca
nyon.
"The assumption that hu
mans are king of the animals
(and plants) is an arbitrary pro

cess of selection. Because we
have hands and can build
things, an arbitrary attribute,
we kill off millions of species
and life forms with the same at
titude with which whites mur
dered Indians."
There is not yet a biocentric
movement as such. Efforts to
label it as a religion or ideology
have been quickly rebuffed. Of
ficial biocentric organizations,
projects, principles or attempts
to proselytize are as yet unheard
of. At best, biocentricity is an
ethical trend, consciously noted
by a few (growing in number),
unconsciously by many.
The ecology movement, for
instance, is in part a manifesta
tion of an underlying biocentric
ethic. But where much of the
ecology movement has em
phasized "tidying up" the envi
ronment for the sake ot humans,
biocentricity carries human re
sponsibility one step further: to
protect the environment for the
sake of all life, even at tempor
ary human expense.
A latent awareness of this
biocentric ethic, however, will
no longer suffice, according to
environmental educator Sterl
ing Bunnell of Antioch College
West. Human chauvinism has
and is, he says, imperiling vital
natural systems.
For example, timber trees,
with a dollar-and-cents value,
have been favored over "less
valuable" plant growth that is
nonetheless an integral compo

nent of to rest land. Con
sequently, to meet human needs,
a diverse forest system has been
replaced by a monoculture,
perhaps crippling the planet's
future evolutionary history.
Throughout the world, once
fertile grasslands have been
transformed into deserts by
overgrazing.
No one is pushing the disaster
button yet. But if humans con
tinue to move full speed ahead
without looking at their effect
on other systems, Earth could,
warns Ponderosa Pines, become
a "planet of blowing sands."
On an individual level, there
are innumerablestalling tactics.
People could farm community
gardens, restore and preserve
the natural histories of an area
or simply become aware of
natural life systems.
Ponderosa Pines advocates,
among other things, an energy
revenue system. Persons would
be taxed according to how much
energy they needlessly con
sume, such as driving a car
when mass transit is available.
Other biocentrists have re
commended regional planning.
Instead of arbitrary state or na
tional borders, areas would be
divided by their ecological
boundaries. A sense of natural
limits to growth would be in
cluded in all planning, seeking
a balance with other life forms.
