# Second gun theory still alive
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (Pacific News
Service) — Contrary to pub
licized reports, the panel of
seven firearms experts examin
ing ballistics evidence in the
Robert F. Kennedy assassina
tion is not yet satisfied that only
one gun was used.
Panel member Lowell Brad
ford — former chief of the Santa
Clara County crime laboratory
— is urging that the inquiry be
expanded to include questions
on the number of bullets fired in
the assassination and their
trajectories.
Most panelists reportedly
agree with him. Some now want
to conduct nuclear activation
analyses to determine if gun
powder on the bullets all came
from the same batch. Others
want to examine the powder
burns on Kennedy's body to re
solve persistent allegations that
Kennedy was shot at point
blank range — while Sirhan
Sirhan fired from six feet away.
The panelists will raise these
issues in court today, when Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge
Robert F. Wenke reconvenes tes
timony in the case.
The panel's original findings,

released Oct. 6, were widely re
ported as having exploded the
second-gun theory and proved
that Sirhan alone shot Kennedy.
The Los Angeles Times went so
far as to editorialize that all pos
sibilities of a conspiracy had
been eliminated.
But Robert J. Joling, presi
dent of the prestigious Academy
of Forensic Science, who has
closely monitored the ballistics
aspect of the case, asserted that
"the press jumped the gun."
Press accounts were based on
the first line of the panel's re
port. which stated that they had
found no demonstrable evi
dence that more than one gun
was used to lire any of the bul
lets examined.
In fact, the report went on to
state that there was no evidence
to show these bullets had been
fired from Sirhan's gun. The
panel found there were "insuffi
cient corresponding individual
characteristics" between the
bullets recovered and those sub
sequently test-fired to match the
two.
The panel thus repudiated the
1968-69 testimony of Los
Angeles police expert DeWayne

Wolfer that he had matched the
bullet in Kennedy to Sirhan's
gun "to the exclusion of all other
weapons in the world."
In addition, the panel
examined only those bullets re
covered from Kennedy's body
and the bodies of two other vic
tims. But possible evidence that
other bullets were fired,
perhaps from a second gun —
including bullet-punctured ceil
ing sections from the shooting
scene — has been lost or de
stroyed by the Los Angeles
police.
Joling has told Pacific News
Service that the RFK case could
have been resolved years ago,
had it not been for "prevarica
tion and stonewalling" by the,
Los Angeles police.
CBS exemplified the press'
misreporting on its news prog
ram the evening of Oct. 6, when
the network violated a promise
by releasing a taped interview
with Bradford 23 minutes before
the panel's findings were offi
cially announced.
The broadcast omitted Brad
ford's assertion that the bullets
could not be tied to Sirhan's
weapon.

LOS ANGELES (Pacific News
Service) — Contrary to pub
licized reports, the panel of
seven firearms experts examin
ing ballistics evidence in the
Robert F. Kennedy assassina
tion is not yet satisfied that only
one gun was used.
Panel member Lowell Brad
ford — former chief of the Santa
Clara County crime laboratory
— is urging that the inquiry be
expanded to include questions
on the number of bullets fired in
the assassination and their
trajectories.
Most panelists reportedly
agree with him. Some now want
to conduct nuclear activation
analyses to determine if gun
powder on the bullets all came
from the same batch. Others
want to examine the powder
burns on Kennedy's body to re
solve persistent allegations that
Kennedy was shot at point
blank range — while Sirhan
Sirhan fired from six feet away.
The panelists will raise these
issues in court today, when Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge
Robert F. Wenke reconvenes tes
timony in the case.
The panel's original findings,

released Oct. 6, were widely re
ported as having exploded the
second-gun theory and proved
that Sirhan alone shot Kennedy.
The Los Angeles Times went so
far as to editorialize that all pos
sibilities of a conspiracy had
been eliminated.
But Robert J. Joling, presi
dent of the prestigious Academy
of Forensic Science, who has
closely monitored the ballistics
aspect of the case, asserted that
"the press jumped the gun."
Press accounts were based on
the first line of the panel's re
port. which stated that they had
found no demonstrable evi
dence that more than one gun
was used to lire any of the bul
lets examined.
In fact, the report went on to
state that there was no evidence
to show these bullets had been
fired from Sirhan's gun. The
panel found there were "insuffi
cient corresponding individual
characteristics" between the
bullets recovered and those sub
sequently test-fired to match the
two.
The panel thus repudiated the
1968-69 testimony of Los
Angeles police expert DeWayne

Wolfer that he had matched the
bullet in Kennedy to Sirhan's
gun "to the exclusion of all other
weapons in the world."
In addition, the panel
examined only those bullets re
covered from Kennedy's body
and the bodies of two other vic
tims. But possible evidence that
other bullets were fired,
perhaps from a second gun —
including bullet-punctured ceil
ing sections from the shooting
scene — has been lost or de
stroyed by the Los Angeles
police.
Joling has told Pacific News
Service that the RFK case could
have been resolved years ago,
had it not been for "prevarica
tion and stonewalling" by the,
Los Angeles police.
CBS exemplified the press'
misreporting on its news prog
ram the evening of Oct. 6, when
the network violated a promise
by releasing a taped interview
with Bradford 23 minutes before
the panel's findings were offi
cially announced.
The broadcast omitted Brad
ford's assertion that the bullets
could not be tied to Sirhan's
weapon.
