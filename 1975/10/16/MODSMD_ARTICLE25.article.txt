## Sure-handed classics major Ted Pappas looks to pros 
### GARY SPRAGUE 
Many classics majors spend
their Saturday afternoons in
spiritual communion with
Euripides and Cicero. Ted Pap
pas spends his snaring passes
and destroying opposing
linebackers. The6-4, 220-pound
senior is number 8(i, Stanford's
starting tight end.
He was recruited out of Med
ford, Ore., from the same
high school which produced
Bill Singler. Although Pappas
played wingback in high school,
his size spelled tight end to the
scouts.
Ted's decision to come to
Stanford had remarkably little
to do with football. "At the
time," he relates, "I didn't know
what I wanted to pursue
academically. All I could go on
was a school with a broad cur
riculum, so 1 could dabble in all
areas. So I took the matter to the
Lord. I can happily say He really
spoke to me and showed me
where He wanted me. Football,
to be honest, really didn't fit into
it. That was just icing on the
cake."
Stanford's recruiters made a
favorable impression on the
Oregonian. "Stanford was one
of the best in being open and
honest," recounts Pappas, "not

building this or that up. From
the coaching staff, I saw the em
phasis was on going to school
and graduating; football was
something to be involved in, but
school was number one."
Although Ted never seriously
considered any of the football
factories notorious for their re
cruiting techniques, he still ran
up against some unethical
propositions. "Other schools
did promise to make me a star",
says Pappas. He labels their re
cruiting approach "phoney".
"Cal said, come here and we'll
make you the next Steve
Sweeney."
Moving up to the varsity as a
sophomore, Ted spent most of
the year cheering from the
sidelines.The inactivity was de
ceiving, however, for Pappas
considers that season in many
ways to be his most important
one.
Best of times
"It was a very frustrating
year," he says, "which is to say
i t was my best yea r. I got a lot out
of that frustration. I grew up a
lot. 1 had to face my fears and
frustrations, see what makes me
tick."
With two years experience,
Ted emerged this year as the
unquestioned number one tight

end. The position is a demand
ing one, requiring not only the
speed and good hands of a re
ceiver, but the blocking ability
of a lineman.
Blocking, perhaps the least
appreciated aspect of football,
constitutes the greater part of
the tight end's duties. "I do a lot
of blocking," says Pappas, "and
my blocks are usually very, very
important. I have a lot of key
blocks. On plays such as a
strong side sweep, it's depen
dent on my block whether the
back can get around."
Passing gear
Although Stanford's offense is
geared to the pass, only two or
three plays in the entire offense
have the tight end as the prim
ary receiver. Most plays look to
a wide receiver, with the tight
end as a secondary target
Ironically, as the play of
flanker Tony Hill and split end
Bill Singler improves, Pappas
sees more action. "Defenses are
double-teaming Tony, and that
leaves me open. As teams make
adjustments to cover our wide
receivers, the tight end becomes
more important."
The possibility of having to
catch passes thrown by three
different quarterbacks during
the course of a game might be
disconcerting to some receivers,
but Pappas sees little difference
between Stanford's trio.
Gopher ball
"If Mike (Cordova) is not pas
sing well, he's the most difficult,
to catch." says Pappas. "He's got
such a strong arm and throws so
hard, it's tougher to make the
adjustment if the ball is at your
feet. Really, though, it doesn't
make much difference. They all
throw so well."
All-American recognition for
Ted is a possibility, but is far
from a sure thing. "I really don't

know,"says Pappas, musing on
the possibility. "I'll have to be
playing a lot better than 1 am
right now. 1 think of it from time
to time, and it would be a great
honor, but it doesn't fit into my
goals right now."
Fappas also acknowledges
the element of luck implicit in
an All-American nomination. In
some cases, a good public rela
tions department has proven
more important than the
player's performance on the
field. Fortunately for Ted, the
Stanford PR corps is devoting
much of its promotional efforts
to the cause of its dependable
tight end.
Query
The fu tureisst i 11 someth ing of
a question mark for Ted. Con
cerning his post graduate plans,
he commented, "I'm really not
sure at this point. I've thought of
law school for awhile, but my
heart's not into that. In the last
couple of months I've gotten a
lot more excited about pro foot
ball. I'd like to give it a shot."
The pros are happy to hear
Ted say that. Scouts represent
ing nearly every NFL team have
contacted Fappas. If he had his
preference, though. Fappas
would rather play for the new
Seattleclub. "It will be their first
year," he explains, "and
they need players. They're real
enthusiastic up there. Besides
that, I miss the Northwest."
Even if pro ball doesn't pan
out for Ted, he has other pos
sibilities. "I may come back to to
do grad work in classics here at
Stanford. Perhaps I'll get my
masters to enable me to teach."
But whatever cause Ted
chooses, it will coine early after
he realizes God's plan for him.
For all things in Ted Fappas
must eventually be reconciled
with his faith.
