### JOHN ROOS 
The Stanford women's field
hockey team demolished an ail
ing Hayward State squad in the
Cards' season opener yesterday
at Roble Field. Hayward never
even registered a shot on goal in
its 9-0 loss.
"We were just getting it to
gether out there today," Stan
ford Coach Shirley Schoof said,
obviously pleased with her
squad's performance. "Of
course, we owe a lot to our pre
season conditioning."
Attributing Hayward's loss to
its injured players unable to
start in today's game, Schoof felt
that the Cards' opponents "re
ally had a tough time on the
field."
A tenacious defensive unit
didn't allow the ball to get
within striking distance of Stan
ford's goalie, Betsy Morris. Led

by junior Mandy Head with 3
goals, the Cards' fast-moving of
fense continually pressured
Hayward's tiring goalie until
she could no longer handle the
oncoming Stanford players.
"We outpassed them and we
also had more stamina," Read
commented.
Other Stanford scorers were
Sukie Jackson, Jessie Gerrand,
Kathy Levinson and Onnie Kil
lefer.
In the end. Read claimed the
squad's victory was due to a
great team effort. "Our offensive
players were pushing hard in
the circle and our defensive
players were always there to
back us up," she said.
The varsity team will have its
next league game here tomor
row at 11 a.m. preceded by the
JV game at 9:30.
