Kissinger offers memo compromise
OTTAWA — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday he will not turn over State Department
documents subpoenaed by a congressional committee but
is willing to submit "a general summary of views on all
subjects."
In Washington, the House Intelligence Committee had
issued a subpoena for a memo written by a former State
Department Cyprus chief who alleged that the govern
ment mishandled the Cyprus crisis.
As the committee's deadline passed yesterday, Kis
singer instead submitted a letter offering a compromise.
Kissinger, who has been visiting Canadian leaders,
told reporters yesterday that no department documents
will be turned over to Congress, nor will junior officers
taking part in decisions be identified.
'Human error' caused Ford crash
HARTF"ORD, Conn. — Police conceded yesterday that
an officer should have been directing traffic at the corner
where President Ford's car was struck Tuesday night and
blamed the failure to assign a traffic cop on "human
error."
The President was not hurt when a car driven by a
teenager crashed into his armored limousine. The only
injury reported was a broken finger suffered by Frederick
K. Biebel Jr., Republican state chairman, who sat next to
Ford on the trip to the airport.
Police spokesman Gordon Damon said police had
planned to have the motorcade's motorcycle escort block
traffic as the President's limousine departed from a GOP
fund-raising dinner in downtown Hartford. But he said
the Market and Talcott street intersection, where the col
lision occurred, was not covered.
"There's human error here," Damon said. "The situa
tion could have been controlled."
Spending ceiling may limit growth
WASHINGTON — President Ford's $395 billion spend
ing ceiling for next year probably would require limits on
growth for some programs for the old and poor. Budget
Director James T. Lynn indicated yesterday.
He said he is sure White House proposals to govern
ment agencies on ways to hold down spending "include
limits in growth in programs that are generally called
entitlement programs."
Such programs include Social Security, food stamps,
veterans benefits, aid to dependent children. Medicare,
retirement benefits and child nutrition programs.
In another related matter, Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.),
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, pre
dicted that this year Congress would pass a tax reform
package with tax reductions. The bill may contain a con
gressional declaration of intent to seek responsible
budget cuts, Ullman said in an interview for the CBS
radio program Capitol Cloakroom.
Ontario man kills police officer
ONTARIO — A man armed with a rifle killed a police

officer and holed up inside an apartment building for two
hours yesterday before surrendering peacefully to his
sister, police said.
Surrenderof thegunman, identified byPoliceChiefLee
Kolbreck as Steven Michael Miller, 25, of Ontario, came
after negotiations through the man's sister, who was
brought to the scene from Pomona.
A police sergeant at the scene said negotiations
through the sister were a last ditch effort. "We'll give it
one more last ditch effort before we go in," he said.
The gunman originally told police in a telephone con
versation that he was holding four hostages. However,
Kolbreck told newsmen there apparently were no hos
tages.
Police said Miller had been sought in connection with
an attempted robbery at an Ontario motel Tuesday night
in which one of the holdup men was shot and killed by the
intended victim.
Fate of Tahoe gunman uncertain
KINGS BEACH, Calif. — Authorities from California,
Nevada and the federal government were working yes
terday on who would charge a man being held here in
connection with a bank robbery, the killing of a highway
patrolman and the kidnaping of four persons.
"We don't really know exactly what's going to happen
yet," said Capt. Max Bennett of the Placer County, Calif.,
Sheriff's Dept. "We've got to figure out who's going to
charge him with what, and when."
Under arrest is Kenneth James Meller, 34, an elec
tronics technician originally from Washington D.C.
Meller was apprehended late Tuesday night after tak
ing four hostages and holding three of them for just over
eight hours at a recreation center in this scenic Lake
Tahoe shoreline community near the California-Nevada
border.

through the sister were a last ditch effort. "We'll give it
one more last ditch effort before we go in," he said.
The gunman originally told police in a telephone con
versation that he was holding four hostages. However,
Kolbreck told newsmen there apparently were no hos
tages.
Police said Miller had been sought in connection with
an attempted robbery at an Ontario motel Tuesday night
in which one of the holdup men was shot and killed by the
intended victim.
Fate of Tahoe gunman uncertain
KINGS BEACH, Calif. — Authorities from California,
Nevada and the federal government were working yes
terday on who would charge a man being held here in
connection with a bank robbery, the killing of a highway
patrolman and the kidnaping of four persons.
"We don't really know exactly what's going to happen
yet," said Capt. Max Bennett of the Placer County, Calif.,
Sheriff's Dept. "We've got to figure out who's going to
charge him with what, and when."
Under arrest is Kenneth James Meller, 34, an elec
tronics technician originally from Washington D.C.
Meller was apprehended late Tuesday night after tak
ing four hostages and holding three of them for just over
eight hours at a recreation center in this scenic Lake

Kissinger offers memo compromise
OTTAWA — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday he will not turn over State Department
documents subpoenaed by a congressional committee but
is willing to submit "a general summary of views on all
subjects."
In Washington, the House Intelligence Committee had
issued a subpoena for a memo written by a former State
Department Cyprus chief who alleged that the govern
ment mishandled the Cyprus crisis.
As the committee's deadline passed yesterday, Kis
singer instead submitted a letter offering a compromise.
Kissinger, who has been visiting Canadian leaders,
told reporters yesterday that no department documents
will be turned over to Congress, nor will junior officers
taking part in decisions be identified.
'Human error' caused Ford crash
HARTF"ORD, Conn. — Police conceded yesterday that
an officer should have been directing traffic at the corner
where President Ford's car was struck Tuesday night and
blamed the failure to assign a traffic cop on "human
error."
The President was not hurt when a car driven by a
teenager crashed into his armored limousine. The only
injury reported was a broken finger suffered by Frederick
K. Biebel Jr., Republican state chairman, who sat next to
Ford on the trip to the airport.
Police spokesman Gordon Damon said police had
planned to have the motorcade's motorcycle escort block
traffic as the President's limousine departed from a GOP
fund-raising dinner in downtown Hartford. But he said
the Market and Talcott street intersection, where the col
lision occurred, was not covered.
"There's human error here," Damon said. "The situa
tion could have been controlled."
Spending ceiling may limit growth
WASHINGTON — President Ford's $395 billion spend
ing ceiling for next year probably would require limits on
growth for some programs for the old and poor. Budget
Director James T. Lynn indicated yesterday.
He said he is sure White House proposals to govern
ment agencies on ways to hold down spending "include
limits in growth in programs that are generally called
entitlement programs."
Such programs include Social Security, food stamps,
veterans benefits, aid to dependent children. Medicare,
retirement benefits and child nutrition programs.
In another related matter, Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.),
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, pre
dicted that this year Congress would pass a tax reform
package with tax reductions. The bill may contain a con
gressional declaration of intent to seek responsible
budget cuts, Ullman said in an interview for the CBS
radio program Capitol Cloakroom.

an officer should have been directing traffic at the corner
where President Ford's car was struck Tuesday night and
blamed the failure to assign a traffic cop on "human
error."
The President was not hurt when a car driven by a
teenager crashed into his armored limousine. The only
injury reported was a broken finger suffered by Frederick
K. Biebel Jr., Republican state chairman, who sat next to
Ford on the trip to the airport.
Police spokesman Gordon Damon said police had
planned to have the motorcade's motorcycle escort block
traffic as the President's limousine departed from a GOP
fund-raising dinner in downtown Hartford. But he said
the Market and Talcott street intersection, where the col
lision occurred, was not covered.
"There's human error here," Damon said. "The situa
tion could have been controlled."
Spending ceiling may limit growth
WASHINGTON — President Ford's $395 billion spend
ing ceiling for next year probably would require limits on
growth for some programs for the old and poor. Budget
Director James T. Lynn indicated yesterday.
He said he is sure White House proposals to govern
ment agencies on ways to hold down spending "include
limits in growth in programs that are generally called
entitlement programs."
Such programs include Social Security, food stamps,
veterans benefits, aid to dependent children. Medicare,
retirement benefits and child nutrition programs.
In another related matter, Rep. Al Ullman (D-Ore.),
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, pre
dicted that this year Congress would pass a tax reform
package with tax reductions. The bill may contain a con
gressional declaration of intent to seek responsible
budget cuts, Ullman said in an interview for the CBS
radio program Capitol Cloakroom.
Ontario man kills police officer
ONTARIO — A man armed with a rifle killed a police

officer and holed up inside an apartment building for two
hours yesterday before surrendering peacefully to his
sister, police said.
Surrenderof thegunman, identified byPoliceChiefLee
Kolbreck as Steven Michael Miller, 25, of Ontario, came
after negotiations through the man's sister, who was
brought to the scene from Pomona.
A police sergeant at the scene said negotiations
through the sister were a last ditch effort. "We'll give it
one more last ditch effort before we go in," he said.
The gunman originally told police in a telephone con
versation that he was holding four hostages. However,
Kolbreck told newsmen there apparently were no hos
tages.
Police said Miller had been sought in connection with
an attempted robbery at an Ontario motel Tuesday night
in which one of the holdup men was shot and killed by the
intended victim.

yet," said Capt. Max Bennett of the Placer County, Calif.,
