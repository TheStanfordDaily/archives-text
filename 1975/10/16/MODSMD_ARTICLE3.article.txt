# Ehrlich resigns to head new firm
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Law School Dean Thomas Ehrlich
announced yesterday afternoon that
he will resign his post effective Jan. 1
to become president of the newly
formed Legal Services Corporation
(LSC), headquartered in Washington.
"This is an independent corpora
tion dedicated to providing legal ser
vices for the poor," Ehrlich explained.
The LSC replaces the Office of Legal
Services in the Community Services
Administration, which was under di
rect federal control.
"My major responsibility will be to
build up existing neighborhood prog
rams," Ehrlich said. "The previous
administration gave them a hard time,
cutting back on attorneys. But we'll
also be experimenting with alternate
techniques like a voucher system, and
an office staffed with para
professionals.
"Right now we're not reaching
more than 15 or 20 percent of these
people who need legal services, so
there's a lot to be done," he noted.

The LSC is funded by Congress, and
has a budget of $88.8 million for this
fiscal year. According to Joe Mohbat.
consultant on public information for
the LSC, "Another of Ehrlich's prime
responsibilities is to testify before
Congress and seek higher appropria
tions."
Ehrlich is also taking a two year
leave of absence from his position as
professor at the Law School. He said
he might work for the LSC longer, "or
I might want to come back after a year.
But 1 certainly expect to return to
Stanford sometime, although not as
an administrator."
Ehrlich says he was "approached
about the position some weeks ago —
I'm not exactly sure when. It was a
very hard decision to make. I love
Stanford, and I love the Law School.
"I guess what made me accept the
offer was that I knew I'd regret it if I
didn't do it. One of the major respon
sibilities of the legal profession has to
be legal aid for the poor."
'Not surprised'
President Richard Lyman said he
wasn't surprised at Ehrlich's decision.
"I'd known for several weeks that this
appointment was a possibility, and
I've followed Dean Ehrlich's state
ments on legal aid for long enough to
know he was bound to be very in
terested in something like this."
Law Prof. Kenneth Scott said he
doubted Ehrlich's departure would be
especially disruptive. "In some ways,
this is a natural dividing point. The
whole campaign to construct the new
building, which was a major effort of
the dean, has now come to an end, and
we'll now have different goals."
Lyman explained, "Ehrlich was
more than just a bricks and mortar
dean. Supervising the building of the
new law school was the most impor
tant thing he did. but he was a good
dean in other respects, too."
A search committee to select a new
dean will be formed in the next few
days, Lyman said. "They'll be looking
at candidates both inside and outside
the University."

MOVIN' ON— Law School Dean Thomas Ehrlich announced yesterday that
he will be resigning as of Jan. 1 to become president of the newly formed Legal
Services Corporation set up in Washington. He said he expected to return to the
University sometime "although not as an administrator."
Mobat noted that Ehrlich was
selected for the LSC presidency from
over 200 candidates. "We're looking
for someone widely known in the
legal profession,with a lot of adminis
trative ability so they could be a buffer
between Washington and the volatile
legal world."
Age was not a factor in the selection,
Mobat said, but he says Ehrlich, at 41,
"will have vigor and stamina. Youth
is on his side."
A move upward
Scott stated that, "although the
Corporation hasn't been established
yet, it has the potential of being very
significant. This is more of a move
upward for Dean Ehrlich than a lat
eral one."
LSC Acting President Lou Ober
dorfer, says he expects the LSC's shift
from government agency to indepen
dent corporation "to give it much gre
ater flexibility. It can attract public
attention in ways it couldn't previ
ously."
Mobat added, "It'll keep us pretty
much free from political interfer
ence."
