# Committee staff assistants expect more action this year
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Historically, the ASSU has treated
the meetings of faculty and Board of
Trustees committees casually. "All
too often students are appointed to
committees and never heard from
again," President Richard Lyman has
observed.
This year the ASSU Council of Pres
idents, (COP), and their staff assis
tants plan to change the old pattern.
They began Monday with an orienta
tion session for 40 student committee

members, attended by the COP', its two
paid assistants for committees, and
Lyman.
Barry Corden. sophomore, and
undergraa Mike Kieschnick
each receive $30 a month for provid
ing staff support to committee mem
bers.
Their predecessor. Jan Havens, says
that last year she only reviewed mi
nutes of committee meetings and
watched attendance records. She
blames ASSU Senate apathy and

spotty cooperation from committee
chairmen for the lack of activity.
Kieschnickand Corden envision a
more active role for themselves.
Committees are "the place where the
faculty and administration have to sit
down and listen to students." Corden
says. The two plan to offer research
assistance to student committee mem
ers and to be liaisons between stu
dents and the administration.
Corden says students sometimes
"feel they're being railroaded" simply
because they cannot obtain enough in
formation about issues. "We can help
people get information together to
comeback with arguments," he notes.
The impact of student opinion de
pends on how it is presented. Corden
says, fie believes "it is important that
students present a united front."
"If student members are not doing
their job. the committee staff assistant
will be in a position to do something"
he warns. Students who consistently
miss committee meetings or fail to
contribute will be replaced. Corden
says.
The staff assistants also plan to
evaluate individually all University
committees, writing reports on how
they are run and how well they do
their work. Their first report will
study the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial
Aids.
