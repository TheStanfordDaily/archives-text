# Board closes Ravenswood, cites 'inferior' school facilities
## 
### RON SEGE 
The Board of Trustees of Sequoia
Union High School District voted last
night to close East Halo Alto's
Ravenswood High School as of Julv 1,
1976.
In a long meeting held in front of a
packed auditorium at Sequoia High
School, the Board voted 4-1 in favor of
a proposal to close the predominantly
black high school. The closure follows
months of special public meetings and
hearings by the Board.
Over the past several years the dis
trict has been facing dropping en
rollment along with increasing costs
at its six high school campuses. Be
cause of this, the Board made a com
mitment in November 1974 to close
one of the campuses. Superintendent
George P. Chaffey assembled a task
force to study possible plans.
The task force study included input
from students, teachers, adminis
trators and parents. The study
strongly recommended closing the
Ravenswood campus.
The task force gave a number of
reasons for closing the school, includ
ing:
— Ravenswood's lack of many
academic facilities, which made it
"academically inferior" to the other
campuses in the district;
— the need to desegregate the
school because its student body is 64
percent black, and thus in violation of
federal discrimination laws; and
— the Board's belief that closing
the school would do the least damage
to students in the district.
Closing Ravenswood is expected to
have a large impact on the East Palo

Alto community. It is felt that most of
the burden for integration will fall on
the black students, as students who
had attended Ravenswood will have
to be bused long distances to attend
other schools.
Along with the closing of
Ravenswood, the Board will have to
initiate boundary changes and ar
range for transportation to re-allocate
students to the other schools in the
district. Many fear that this will dis
rupt the students by separating
friends and creating general bitter
ness among the students.
Flans for the future of Ravenswood
facilities are indefinite, but there is a

good possibility that they will be
leased to the Canada College District.
Also, a community center operating
on the school grounds will remain
open.
Last week, the Santa Clara County
Commitee on School District Organi
zation voted its support for a proposal
that would merge portions of the
Sequoia District, including
Ravenswood, into a proposed
23,000-student Mid-Peninsula Un
ified School District.
Opponents of the merger claimed it
would require busing, cause taxes to
rise, and rob the school system of edu
cational programs.

at its six high school campuses. Be
cause of this, the Board made a com
mitment in November 1974 to close
one of the campuses. Superintendent
George P. Chaffey assembled a task
force to study possible plans.
The task force study included input
from students, teachers, adminis
trators and parents. The study
strongly recommended closing the
Ravenswood campus.
The task force gave a number of
reasons for closing the school, includ
ing:
— Ravenswood's lack of many
academic facilities, which made it
"academically inferior" to the other
campuses in the district;
— the need to desegregate the
school because its student body is 64
percent black, and thus in violation of
federal discrimination laws; and
— the Board's belief that closing
the school would do the least damage
to students in the district.
Closing Ravenswood is expected to
have a large impact on the East Palo

Alto community. It is felt that most of
the burden for integration will fall on
the black students, as students who
had attended Ravenswood will have
to be bused long distances to attend
other schools.
Along with the closing of
Ravenswood, the Board will have to
initiate boundary changes and ar
range for transportation to re-allocate
students to the other schools in the
district. Many fear that this will dis
rupt the students by separating
friends and creating general bitter
ness among the students.
Flans for the future of Ravenswood
facilities are indefinite, but there is a

good possibility that they will be
leased to the Canada College District.
Also, a community center operating
on the school grounds will remain
open.
Last week, the Santa Clara County
Commitee on School District Organi
zation voted its support for a proposal
that would merge portions of the
Sequoia District, including
Ravenswood, into a proposed
23,000-student Mid-Peninsula Un
ified School District.
Opponents of the merger claimed it
would require busing, cause taxes to
rise, and rob the school system of edu
cational programs.
The Board of Trustees of Sequoia
Union High School District voted last
night to close East Halo Alto's
Ravenswood High School as of Julv 1,
1976.
In a long meeting held in front of a
packed auditorium at Sequoia High
School, the Board voted 4-1 in favor of
a proposal to close the predominantly
black high school. The closure follows
months of special public meetings and
hearings by the Board.
Over the past several years the dis
