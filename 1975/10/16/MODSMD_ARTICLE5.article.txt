# Room scheduling complications 'critical' at beginning of quarter
## 
### STEVE SCHILLER BONNY RODDEN 
Classroom scheduling problems
reached "really critical" proportions
during the first two weeks of autumn
quarter, according to Walter Fin
deisen, assistant registrar.
Findeisen, who is responsible for
scheduling, explained that an injury
he incurred Sept. 20 prevented him
from working during the critical first
days of the quarter.
He said the closing of the history
corner — Building 200 — which holds
1193 students and includes a 309-seat
lecture hall, further complicated the

room scheduling procedure.
A ceiling collapse in the history
building the day after final exams last
spring prompted the renovation plans
for the building.
Despite this quarter's particular
problems, the first few days of classes
would still have been tumultous, ac
cording to Vi Gleason. room schedul
ing secretary.
This quarter's problem basically
"wasn't any different from any other
quarter's except that everyone
panicked," she said.
Students are always going to "shop
around for courses," making schedul
ing difficult, Gleason said. Glass sizes
fluctuate during the first few days ac
cording to the number of students
dropping, adding and auditing clas
ses, and some classes are canceled.
Classroom hunt
Some economics classes did not
meet for two or three class days, in an
attempt to pressure Room Scheduling
to fund appropriate sized classrooms,
according to Gleason.
Undergraduate Special 37, "The
Stock Market," was forced to limit its
enrollment because of classroom size.
Gleason said that Room Scheduling
uses every possible classroom. How
ever, 115 rooms are reserved for de
partment use only, Asst. Provost Amy
Blue said. Even Little Theatre, adja
cent to Memorial Auditorium, is being
used this year.
Gleason explained that the space
problem centers on the "haves" and
"have-nots." Some departments, such
as economics, have no classroom
space at all, while others with wealthy
benefactors, such as art. and the Law
and Business Schools, have many
rooms.
Some undergraduate classes have
been scheduled in the Business
School's Bishop Auditorium, but the
Law School allowed only one under
graduate class to use its new Kresge
Auditorium.
Needs pattern
According to Assoc. Law School
Dean Joseph Leininger, the Law
School has not opened its classrooms
to other departments because it needs
to "establish a pattern of Law School
use" of the building.
He said some of the rooms in the
newly constructed building are not
yet usable because of faulty air condi
tioning.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar

shall, whose Political Science 1 class
is the only undergraduate class held
in Kresge Auditorium, told his stu
dents that Law School officials were
afraid undergraduates would spill
beverages and food on the carpeted
auditorium floor.
Gleason said she is going to con
tinue to pressure the Law School for
use of their classrooms.
Gleason said that there are just
barely enough classrooms to hold this
quarter's scheduled classes, but the
situation is not permanently resolved.
She suggested more University funds
should be allotted to constructing a
classroom building.
Findeisen said assigning more clas
ses at 8 a.m. would make scheduling
easier. However, he said he doubted
the early hour would be popular with
students and faculty.

is the only undergraduate class held
in Kresge Auditorium, told his stu

afraid undergraduates would spill
beverages and food on the carpeted
auditorium floor.
Gleason said she is going to con
tinue to pressure the Law School for
use of their classrooms.
Gleason said that there are just
barely enough classrooms to hold this
quarter's scheduled classes, but the
situation is not permanently resolved.
She suggested more University funds
should be allotted to constructing a
classroom building.
Findeisen said assigning more clas
ses at 8 a.m. would make scheduling
easier. However, he said he doubted
the early hour would be popular with
students and faculty.
Classroom scheduling problems
reached "really critical" proportions
during the first two weeks of autumn
quarter, according to Walter Fin
deisen, assistant registrar.
Findeisen, who is responsible for
scheduling, explained that an injury
he incurred Sept. 20 prevented him
from working during the critical first
days of the quarter.
He said the closing of the history
corner — Building 200 — which holds
1193 students and includes a 309-seat
lecture hall, further complicated the

room scheduling procedure.
A ceiling collapse in the history
building the day after final exams last
spring prompted the renovation plans
for the building.
Despite this quarter's particular
problems, the first few days of classes
would still have been tumultous, ac
cording to Vi Gleason. room schedul
ing secretary.
This quarter's problem basically
"wasn't any different from any other
quarter's except that everyone
panicked," she said.
Students are always going to "shop
around for courses," making schedul
ing difficult, Gleason said. Glass sizes
fluctuate during the first few days ac
cording to the number of students
dropping, adding and auditing clas
ses, and some classes are canceled.
Classroom hunt
Some economics classes did not
meet for two or three class days, in an
attempt to pressure Room Scheduling
to fund appropriate sized classrooms,
according to Gleason.
Undergraduate Special 37, "The
Stock Market," was forced to limit its
enrollment because of classroom size.
Gleason said that Room Scheduling
uses every possible classroom. How
ever, 115 rooms are reserved for de
partment use only, Asst. Provost Amy
Blue said. Even Little Theatre, adja
cent to Memorial Auditorium, is being
used this year.
Gleason explained that the space
problem centers on the "haves" and
"have-nots." Some departments, such
as economics, have no classroom
space at all, while others with wealthy
benefactors, such as art. and the Law
and Business Schools, have many
rooms.
Some undergraduate classes have
been scheduled in the Business
School's Bishop Auditorium, but the
Law School allowed only one under
graduate class to use its new Kresge
Auditorium.
