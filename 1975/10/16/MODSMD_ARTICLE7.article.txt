# Reg Day Blues

Gail G. Muller

I spent the registration days
last mouth as gate guardian at
the east side of Memorial Au
ditorium (Mem Aud). Do not ask
me to define "east side." Like
most of the elite Stanford stu
dent body, terminal graduate
students (TGR) included, I have
no idea where is east and where
is west.
To solve this problem I
suggest that on the eve of regist
ration day, Stanford give out
compasses to its students. Using
compasses would reduce the
enormous amounts of anxiety
generated from how am I going
to get there if I don't know
where I'm going.
Giving compasses away,
however, is a complicated and
costly solution. A simpler and
cheaper one is to print large
signs EAST or WEST at the ap
propriate locations.
This job, of course, would be
given to an appropriate person,
a trained navigator.
Gait breeds envy
Gontinuing my impressions
from the east side, I saw that
most students received their
Permits to Register (PTR),
glanced rapidly at them and bee
lined out the exit to Maples
Pavillion. A smaller number (or
good actors, or former Stanford
students, or those not fully
awake) nonchalantly came
down the stairs. Their ambling
gait was the envy of all who
rushed by them. Some students
took a seat at the table near the
exit and actually read theirPTß.
Upon reading their PTK, there
were the unlucky few who
found "HOLD" printed boldly
on the form.
Suppose you were that stu
dent. Your social, intellectual
and financial identity was lo
cated in the form's upper left
hand corner. Without that
corner, the student body card,
you were nonexistent. Offi

cially, you were not in.
You might have had a mo
ment of panic when you were
told to go and clear "HOLD."
Stop! Do not pass Mem Aud. Do
not proceed to Maples Pavillion.
Do not collect student body
card.
Enter through exit
1 was impressed by the reac
tions of the former Stanford stu
dents. They tried to beat the sys
tem by coming in the exit("inthe
exit,"definition of: logical and
bureaucratic impossibility).
If for example, the student's
last name initial was "A" and
was scheduled for H a.m., he
showed up at 11. In a properly
apologetic tone he said, "I'm an
'A' and I'm a little late. Where
do I go in?"
Noting how quickly the stu
dent picked up officialese, 1 re
plied, "Good luck. 'A.' See if you
can go in now. If not. go in to
morrow during 'All Other's
Time.' " My tone was, 1 thought
properly tongue-in-cheek. Un
fortunately, 1 was taken seri
ously and thanked.
Other ways to beat the system
included:
— sneaking in the exit while
the guardian was reading the
ChopurraJ.
— wearing a pained, embar
rassed expression while asking
for the men's room. It happened
to be at the east side.
— losing PTR. This was an
act of courage. Only the intrepid
intentionally took this step.
After two, carefree days, you
proceeded to the Old Union and
picked up a new I'TR.
Although I saw much humor
in the happenings of reg. day, I
also sensed a great deal of anxi
ety. Were those days, indeed,
times of anxiety for many of the
students at Stanford? If so, was
the anxiety necessary?
