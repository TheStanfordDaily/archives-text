# Bicycle safety

An article on campus bicyc
lists in the Oct. 1 1 Daily stated
that bicyclists have a legal right
to ride down the middle of the
road. Quite the contrary is true.
Vehicle Code 21202(a) states:
"(E)very person operating a
bicycle upon a roadway shall
ride as near the right-hand curb
or edge of the roadway as prac
ticable . . ."
The above section is violated
most commonly by cyclists who
ride along the left edge of the
road. This is especially danger
ous for two reasons.
First, a motorist making a
right turn may not anticipate the
approach of any traffic (bicycle
or otherwise) from his im
mediate right.
Second, the bicyclist riding in
the wrong direction may force a
collision with another cyclist
who is riding in the proper di
rection and is unable to move
aside because of vehicular traf
fic on the road.
Of course, this section also
prohibits riding in the correct
direction, but in the middle of a
lane. That practice is hazardous
because it forces motorists to
drive on the wrong side of the
road in order to get by.
Right-of-way violations,
which are the most frequent
cause of vehicle accidents in
many cities, are undoubtedly
also a major cause of bicycle
vehicle collisions on campus.

Especially at intersections,
bicyclists often enter the road
way from paths or blocked-off
streets without yielding to ap
proaching vehicles. This is
dangerous because many
motorists are unlikely to antici
pate that traffic will appear
from these places.
Bicyclists who fail to yield to
motorists are in violation of
Vehicle Code ยง 21802 if they
enter from a street with a stop
sign, or in violation of ยง 21804 if
they enter the road from a path,
alley or parking lot.
