### JAYNE LOUGHRY 
If you've seen True Grit and
The African Queen, don't he
surprised if Rooster Cogburn
strikes the dejci vu bell in your
movie-watching soul. Were it
not for Katherine Hepburn's
wrinkles, one might think that
Rooster Cogburn is a clever
splicing of its progenitors. But
in fact, producer Hal Wallis has
taken Hollywood's current
sequel mania to a new height of
unimaginative exploitation.
Yes, folks, it's all here. John
Wayne gets another shot at the
seedy, besotted, inisogynic role
which won him an Oscar in
1969. It must have been a very
attractive offer for Wayne. In
stead of having to say, as he has
said in a hundred other movies,
"Heck, ma'am, this ain't no
place for a lady," Wayne as
anti-hero gets to say, "Hell,
ma'am, this ain't no place for a
wummin."
As EulaGoodnight, Katherine
Hepburn has what at least one
Hepburn devotee hopes will be
her last chance to play the Bible
quoting, fire spitting, spinster
prude. It's not just the stale pre
dictability of the role. I know I'll
go to hell for saying this,
nevertheless Katherine Hep
burn should retire, quickly.
She's got the shakes, she
blows her lines, she doesn't
know what to do with herself
when she's not the primary
focus of a scene. In reviewing a

Hepburn performance, Dorothy
Parker once wrote, "She ran the
gamut of emotions, from A to B."
Parker's wit has become depres
singly accurate.
On to plot, so to speak. Eula
and Rooster, accompanied by
the loyal Indian boy Wolf ("Gee
Marshall Cogburn, when I grow
up I want to be just like you.")
set off to capture the low down
dirty rats (oh excuse me, that's
another movie), the low down
dirty varmints who murdered
Eula's father and who, unless
stopped by the forces of good
ness, are going to rob a bank
with the help of 10 cases of nitro
glycerine.
We know that the varmints
are very dangerous and very
bad actors because they all snarl
a lot. The good guys — Rooster,
Eula and Wolf — and the bad
guys — everyone who snarls —
alternately chase, ambush, and
shoot Gatling guns at each other
while playing doggie-doggie
who's got the nitro.
Two-thirds of the way
through a fidgetingly long 107
minutes, the good guys, who
now have the nitro, transfer

from a stable wagon on solid
ground to a flimsy raft on an un
navigatable river. If, consider
ing the combustion factor of
nitro, this seems absurd, blame
writer Martin Julien and direc
tor Stuart Millar.
Highlight of this blatant steal
from African Queen is a rapids
scene wherein Wayne and Hep
burn prove their superstar
status by miraculously manag
ing to shoot a mile of rapids on a
five by five raft without being
splattered by a single drop of
water.
Since the rest of the movie is a
contrived formula, why should
the ending be any less obvious?
The bad guys get blown up, and
Wayne and Hepburn ride off
into separate sunsets each hav
ing learned, respectively, grea
ter tolerance for women and
drunkards.
Though it by no means makes
Rooster Cogburn worth a $3 tic
ket, Harry Stradling's photo
graphy of Oregon's Rogue River
is spectacular, but then looking
at picture post cards for two
hours might be more interest
ing.

Two-thirds of the way
through a fidgetingly long 107
minutes, the good guys, who
now have the nitro, transfer

from a stable wagon on solid
ground to a flimsy raft on an un
navigatable river. If, consider

nitro, this seems absurd, blame
writer Martin Julien and direc

Highlight of this blatant steal
from African Queen is a rapids
scene wherein Wayne and Hep
burn prove their superstar
status by miraculously manag
ing to shoot a mile of rapids on a
five by five raft without being
splattered by a single drop of
water.
Since the rest of the movie is a
contrived formula, why should
the ending be any less obvious?
The bad guys get blown up, and
Wayne and Hepburn ride off
into separate sunsets each hav

drunkards.
Though it by no means makes
Rooster Cogburn worth a $3 tic

If you've seen True Grit and
The African Queen, don't he
surprised if Rooster Cogburn
strikes the dejci vu bell in your
movie-watching soul. Were it
not for Katherine Hepburn's
wrinkles, one might think that
Rooster Cogburn is a clever
splicing of its progenitors. But
in fact, producer Hal Wallis has
taken Hollywood's current
sequel mania to a new height of
unimaginative exploitation.
Yes, folks, it's all here. John
Wayne gets another shot at the
seedy, besotted, inisogynic role
which won him an Oscar in
1969. It must have been a very
attractive offer for Wayne. In
stead of having to say, as he has
said in a hundred other movies,
"Heck, ma'am, this ain't no
place for a lady," Wayne as
anti-hero gets to say, "Hell,
ma'am, this ain't no place for a
wummin."
As EulaGoodnight, Katherine
Hepburn has what at least one
Hepburn devotee hopes will be
her last chance to play the Bible
quoting, fire spitting, spinster
prude. It's not just the stale pre
dictability of the role. I know I'll
go to hell for saying this,
nevertheless Katherine Hep
burn should retire, quickly.
She's got the shakes, she
blows her lines, she doesn't
know what to do with herself
when she's not the primary
focus of a scene. In reviewing a

Hepburn performance, Dorothy
Parker once wrote, "She ran the
gamut of emotions, from A to B."
Parker's wit has become depres
singly accurate.
On to plot, so to speak. Eula
and Rooster, accompanied by
the loyal Indian boy Wolf ("Gee
Marshall Cogburn, when I grow
up I want to be just like you.")

dirty rats (oh excuse me, that's
another movie), the low down
dirty varmints who murdered
Eula's father and who, unless
stopped by the forces of good
ness, are going to rob a bank
with the help of 10 cases of nitro
glycerine.
We know that the varmints
are very dangerous and very
bad actors because they all snarl
a lot. The good guys — Rooster,
Eula and Wolf — and the bad
