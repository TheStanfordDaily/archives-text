# Nostalgia's back
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
Once upon a time, before the
days of Clint Eastwood and
Linda Lovelace, there was a
kind of movie that was clean
and decent and had happy
people and happy endings and
plots the approximate weight
of cotton candy. They were cal
led musicals.
They were not like the musi
cals of today (what few there
are). While in those far-off days,
musicals were pillars of the in
dustry, today the successful
musical is a iuri avis, usually
far from being as fluffy as its an
cestors. Case in point: 1972's
Cabaret, which was described as
"a lollipop with a distinctly bit
ter taste."
Those old musicals' popular
ity is resurging — witness the
re-release of Singin' In The Rain
and The Jolson Story. Whether it
is because of "nostalgia" (a
catch-all term for anything that
happened prior to 1973), or be
cause today's movies on the
whole are a waste of time, or
because everyone is suddenly
fascinated by motion picture
history is not known.
The good old days
What is certain is that Hol
lywood does not make musicals
like they used to (a sigh of relief
is heard). Capitalizing on the
salty wave of tears for innocence
gone by. and perhaps perpetuat

ing part of it himself, Jack Haley
Jr. (son of the Tin Woodman of
Oz) wrote, produced, and di
rected a documentary of old
Metro-Goldwyn-Maver musi
cals, appropriately called That's
Entertainment.
He filmed introductory inter
ludes of stars who have had the
misfortune to survive and see
the Hollywood they once knew
auctioned off. He chose MGM
because it was the biggest and
had specialized in musicals in
its heyday. This does, of course,
eliminate some great musicals
(like Warner's 42nd Street), but
why should MGM advertise its
competitors' product?
In the days of the big studios,
stars did what they were told, no
matter how against "type" it
might have seemed. That's En
tertainment has some hilarious
scenes with stars whom one
normally doesn't expect to find
in a musical.
Ridiculous roles
There is a singing and dancing
Glark Gable, Joan Crawford,
Jimmy Stewart, Jean Harlow
and Peter Lawford.
To compensate, though, are
scenes overflowing with the ta
lent of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly
and Frank Sinatra in such great
films as Royal Wedding, The
Bark leys of Broadway, Singin' In
The Rain and On The Town.
We have the startling visions

of stars grown old, shattering
the images in our memories.
There is sincere Elizabeth
Taylor, looking more plastic
than vacuform, reminiscing
about her early days with such
intensity that one can't help but
wonder if what she's saying is
her verson of her childhood, or
Haley's.
There is a very, very old
Jimmy Stewart, leaving us
yearning for the pre-VVorld War
H Mr. Smith who went to a
Washington where the corrupt
senators were in the minority.
The other hosts incite ques
tions, though. What is Bing
Crosby doing here, since he did
only two films for MGM?
Likewise for Donald O'Connor?
It makes one feel like Haley had
many first choices who were
either dead or reluctant, and
had to settle with those who had
a minor connection.
Other hosts are Mickey
Rooney; Liza Minelli (who later
married Haley) by proxy for her
mother, Judy Garland; Frank
Sinatra; Debbie Reynolds; Fred
Astaire; Gene Kelly; and Peter
Lawford.
On the whole, That's Enter
tainment is like a trip back in
time, a kaleidoscope of wacki
ness and hilarity and great
music. While it does stretch a
trifle long at two hours-plus, it is
still a trip not to be missed.
