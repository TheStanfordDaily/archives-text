The Wind and the Lion
Directed by |ohn Milius
Rewritten history, Hollywood style, has
never come out better. Brian Keith as
Teddy Roosevelt tries to rescue Candice
Bergen as Eden Pedecaris (who was male
in the original incident) from Sean Con
nery as Raisuli, the Last of the Barbary
Pirates. It is a majestic production, corny
at times, but thrilling in the tradition of
old-time adventure movies.***
Singin' In The Rain
Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly
The 1952 MCM musical that supplied the
world with some of the most magical mus
ical moments. A multi-faceted film show
ing Hollywood both in the halcyon days of
1927 before and after sound arrived and in
1952 just before the days of TV when no
expense was spared for a lavish produc
tion. The songs, Kelly's dancing and his
superb performance as a Hollywood lover
make the picture worth seeing â€”
again.****

Rollerball
Directed by Norman (ewison
A chilling look into the not-so-distant fu
ture when corporations have taken over
the world and the masses are subdued by
the ultraviolent rollerball game, a con
glomeration of roulette, motorcycling,
roller derby and hockey, lames Caan
plays the immensely popular )onathan E.
who becomes powerful enough to chal
lenge the reign of the corporations. ****
The Return of the Pink Panther
Directed by Blake Edwards
Coolly mincing his way through the in

trigues of international crime and the
phonetic hazards of renting a hotel
"rum," Peter Sellers is at his bumbling
best as Inspector Clouseau.****
Love and Death
Directed by Woody Allen
Allen, a frustrated seeker of truth, gets
lost among philosophical cobwebs of
Tolstoy and Dostoevsky with Diane
Keaton, who is merely frustrated. Less
frenzied than his earlier films, this is
Woody Allen's most mature piece of
filmmaking. He even gets the girl.****

Nashville
Directed by Robert Altman
This tour de force covers several days in
the lives of about 20 characters caught up
in the Nashville scene. We don't think it's
the American epic it is purported to be,
but the capsule performances of Henry
Gibson, Lily Tomlin and Roni Blakely are
outstanding.***
Let's Do It Again
Directed by Sidney Poitier
A "sequel" bearing little resemblance to

Uptown Saturday Night, though both star
Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier. Trying to
raise money for their lodge, Cosby and
Poitier hypnotize a pipsqueak boxer
(Jimmy Walker) to make him a winner.
Though weak and hackneyed in spots,
overall it is funny and enjoyable.***
Rooster Cogburn
Directed by Stuart Millar
A tired re-hashing of the old African
Queen plot, with Katie Hepburn playing
almost exactly the same role she did with
Bogart. She and John Wayne attempt to
find the criminals who killed her father
and stole some nitroglycerine, but it
comes off as boring and contrived. The
sequel to T/ue Crit. *
Hard Times
Directed by Walter Hill
Still another in a seemingly endless string
of Charles Bronson macho movies, this
time Mr. Personality playing a New Or
leans boxer, lames Coburn adds a little
support as a gambler. Altogether a tedi
ous and useless movie.*
