# Sequel aptly named
## 
### HOWARD BALDWIN 
In a time when sequels are
springing up like prices, Let's
Do It Again seems the most ap
propriate title possible. It is an
alleged sequel to Uptown Satur
day Night; it stars Bill Cosby and
Sidney Poitier (who also di
rected) as Billy Foster and Clyde
Williams.
However, since it only has the
same characters, who don't
even have the same wives, it is
not as dedicated a follower as
most sequels.
This is fortunate, because Up
town Saturday Night was not the
most memorable movie ever
produced (I still can't remember
what it was about). And while
Let's Do It Again shows im
provement on Poitier's part as a
director, it isn't the funniest
movie ever produced.
As two lodge members trying
to raise money for a new temple.

Foster and Williams use hyp
notism to rig a fight between
Bootney Farnsworth (Jimmie
Walker from TV's Good Times)
and 40th Street Black.
Hypnotism has always been a
weak gimmick on which to base
an entire movie. 1972's The Hot
Rock was great until it used a
hypnotist to retain the diamond.
Also, it has a tendency to put the
audience to sleep.
For better or worse, hyp
notism plays a big part in Let's
Do It Agciin, calling for some
suspension of disbelief, but once
that is conquered, the movie be
comes quite enjoyable.
It is Cosby who pulls the
movie off. In the beginning, he
dares a fellow workman
(heavyweight boxer George
Foreman) to a fight after being
taunted. Cosby approaches, say
ing, "Before we start, there's
something you ought to know

about mo." Quickly he hugs
Foreman and continues ten
derly, "I love you."
Only Cosby could pull off
such a potentially disastrous
scene with the ease that he does.
As for the supporting cast,
John Amos (also from Good
Times) stands out. His Kansas
City Mack has just the right
blend of comedy and menace.
Calvin Lockhart plays the other
gangster Foster and Williams
get involved with Biggie
Smalls. See? There are some
bright spots among the tar
nished.
The morality message within
— that it's all right to gamble
with other people's money as
long as you win — is sometimes
hard to swallow along with the
film's other gimmickry, but
oddly enough, if one can over
look its weaknesses, it is still an
enjoyable movie.

The morality message within
— that it's all right to gamble
with other people's money as
long as you win — is sometimes
hard to swallow along with the
film's other gimmickry, but
oddly enough, if one can over
look its weaknesses, it is still an
enjoyable movie.

THE STAR— Bill Cosby and his
immense comedic talent walk
off with the show in Let's Do It
Again, the sequel to Uptown
Saturday Night.

THE DIRECTOR— Sidney
Poitier repeats his chores both in
front of the camera and behind
it. His talent is becoming more
refined, as evidenced by Let's Do
It Again.
In a time when sequels are
springing up like prices, Let's
Do It Again seems the most ap
propriate title possible. It is an
alleged sequel to Uptown Satur
day Night; it stars Bill Cosby and
Sidney Poitier (who also di
rected) as Billy Foster and Clyde
Williams.
However, since it only has the
same characters, who don't
even have the same wives, it is
not as dedicated a follower as
most sequels.
This is fortunate, because Up
town Saturday Night was not the
most memorable movie ever
produced (I still can't remember
what it was about). And while
Let's Do It Again shows im
provement on Poitier's part as a
director, it isn't the funniest
movie ever produced.
As two lodge members trying
to raise money for a new temple.

Foster and Williams use hyp
notism to rig a fight between
Bootney Farnsworth (Jimmie
Walker from TV's Good Times)
and 40th Street Black.
Hypnotism has always been a
weak gimmick on which to base
an entire movie. 1972's The Hot
Rock was great until it used a
hypnotist to retain the diamond.
Also, it has a tendency to put the
audience to sleep.
For better or worse, hyp
notism plays a big part in Let's
Do It Agciin, calling for some
suspension of disbelief, but once
that is conquered, the movie be
comes quite enjoyable.
It is Cosby who pulls the
movie off. In the beginning, he
dares a fellow workman
(heavyweight boxer George
Foreman) to a fight after being
taunted. Cosby approaches, say
ing, "Before we start, there's
something you ought to know

about mo." Quickly he hugs
Foreman and continues ten
derly, "I love you."
Only Cosby could pull off
such a potentially disastrous
scene with the ease that he does.
As for the supporting cast,
John Amos (also from Good
Times) stands out. His Kansas
City Mack has just the right
blend of comedy and menace.
Calvin Lockhart plays the other
gangster Foster and Williams
get involved with Biggie
Smalls. See? There are some
bright spots among the tar
nished.
The morality message within

with other people's money as
