# Eleanor Dickinson 'Nudes are timeless' Line drawing artist
## 
### CARLIN CHRISMAN 
Eleanor Dickinson pours her
self a cup of coffee and sits down,
cross-legged, on the floor while
her model takes a break. "I can't
remember when I started draw
ing," she reflects. "There are
scribblings on the basement walls
from the time 1 was three and 1
just have never stopped. 1 never
thought consciously about be
coming an artist — it's just the
way 1 live
"I draw nudes because nudes
are universal and timeless. They
offer me much more possibility
for expression," explains Dickin
son, indicating one of the many
drawings in her exhibit at the
California Palace of the Legion of
Honor in San Francisco.
Line Drawings by Eleanor Dic
kinson is not an ordinary, "come
see and hopefully buy" exhibit. It
is an experiment in which visitors
are able to actually view the crea
tive process of art.
Revolving sketches
Every day of the exhibit,
which will be running through
Sunday, Dec. 14, Dickinson has
scheduled models so that visitors
are able to watch the creation of
her unusual, bold felt pen
sketches on specially treated
white paper. Her new drawings
will replace the old. so there will
be a constantly changing group of
drawings to display in the gal
lery.
Dickinson received the use of
the gallery as the result of her

award-winning exhibition of
drawings in the San Francisco
Arts Festival. She says that this
experimental type of exhibit in
terests her. "I didn't want another
object-oriented show, where
people just look at what's hung on
the walls. This exhibit gets vis
itors interested and involved in
what I'm doing."
Dickinson, who is known
primarily for her drawings of
nude couples, says that she gets
emotionally involved in her sub
jects. She prefers drawing people
with complicated personalities.
"I like to draw people with strong
emotions that let me see what they
feel like."
Dancers excellent
"Dancers make good models,"
she says, "because they have ex
pressive bodies and they're hon
est about communicating their
emotions." Dickinson gets her
models from many sources. Some
are professional models from a
guild, some are recommended by
other artists, some are friends and
neighbors.
But she actually uses only a few
of her favorite models exten
sively. "1 give my models the
freedom to do what they want, but
they have to be open to me and let
me see what they're feeling," she
explains.
An interesting aspect of Dic
kinson's art is her sympathetic
portrayal of old men and women.
Her drawings are frank and hon
est, vet communicate the beautv

in the lines of an aged body.
"Old people make excellent
models because technically they
are more complicated — all the
little lines and wrinkles. But they
also have this marvelous way of
relating to each other. They are at
ease with themselves so they can
be relaxed and get deeply in
volved with each other."
The model returns and Dickin
son climbs onto a high stool in
front of her large easel and picks
up her felt pen. "What do you
want to do now, Toni?" she asks.
Toni composes herself on the
fabric-covered block, her eyes
meditatively ahead, her hands
outstretched at her sides. Dickin
son regards her for a minute, then
starts to draw with long, sweep
ing movements of the arm and
shoulder.
Quick work
In 10 minutes the drawing is
finished. "See how easily she
caught the resemblance — it re
ally looks like her," murmurs one
of the visitors. And it does — not
just the physical resemblance but
the whole mood, quiet and reflec
tive.
Dickinson admits there are
many difficulties in trying to be
an artist, wife and mother. Her
husband, a physicist and inven
tor, is away from home much of
the time and her three children —
the oldest is 21 — say they wish
she'd be a regular mother and
stay home and do the dishes.
"They were embarrassed by the

nudes in the studio and they think
its a drag that I'm always gone,"
she relates. "Today is my
youngest son's birthday and he
probably wishes 1 was home bak
ing him a cake. But they have to
realize that I need to be free. With
me, my art comes first."
Dickinson has had solo exhibi
tions all over the country, includ
ing representation in galleries in
San Francisco. New York and
London. Her book. Revival,
which she wrote and illustrated
with sketches and photos of revi
val meetings in her native Ten
nessee, was nominated for the
Pulitzer Prize.
She has illustrated a dozen
publications and has been the

subject of 20 reviews by impor
tant art critics and art historians.
She teaches drawing classes at
the California College of Arts and
Crafts.
Her exhibit is open from 10 to 5
every day but Thursday and Fri
day mornings, when she will be
teaching art classes. She enjoys
meeting and talking to her vis
itors. That's the whole point of the
exhibit — to interest herself and
her visitors.
Her drawings may be bought
through her agent, William
Sawyer, but she isn't concerned
with whether they sell or not.
Eleanor Dickinson doesn't draw
for any other reason than to ex
press herself.
