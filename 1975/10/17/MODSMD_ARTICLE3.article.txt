# Play unworthy of acclaim
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
The River Niger, by Joseph A.
Walker, won critical acclaim as
the best 1973 production in New
York, but don't be fooled. It's a
bad play.
Walker apparently never
learned a steadfast rule of literary
art: A writer must show, not tell.
His characters explain their feel
ings rather than reveal them in
drama. They become mere points
of argument in a message melo
drama.
The playwright's diffuse
polemic does offer powerful dis
plays of emotion and ideology.
Unfortunately, it lacks the
dramatic palliatives of character,
dialogue and plot needed to
weave the fireworks into the play.
Story unwieldy
Cluttered subplots and stock
characters — a mother dying of
cancer, a South African girlfriend

with a father imprisoned for sedi
tion, and a grandmother whose
husband was murdered by a
Georgia cracker, for example —
contribute to the play's dramatic
i mplausibil ity.
Palo Alto Community Players
director John Cochran, appa
rently seduced by his vision of
Niger as "quality black drama —
a play of universal themes." fails
to recognize its flaws, much less
repair them.
Only an inspired, vital produc
tion could redeem The liiver
Niger. The Palo Alto group comes
close, but a spotty cast and erratic
direction frustrate their attempt.
TheCommunity Players present a
faithful, creditable version of a
weak play.
Walker's play explores the con
flict between John Williams, a
Harlem housepainter, and his son
Jeff, a recently discharged Air
Force lieutenant.
Jeff comes home to a father who

cannot understand why his son
despises the military, and to fel
low gang members who believe
he has sold them out by planning
to attend law school.
Father impressive
George Felix justice, playing
John Williams, dominates the
stage, melding the disparate parts
of the housepai nter-post
alcoholic-philosopher into a rich
portrait. Justice's impressive
stage presence mutes many of the
script's incongruities.
Cedric Anthony brown does
not quite muster the emotional
force to play Jeff Williams oppo
site Justice. His voice contains a
trace of uncertainty and whining,
his carriage on stage is con
strained at critical moments, and
his anger seldom reaches the sus
tained intensity his part de
mands.
Francis Azariah badly under
plays the engaging Dr. Dudley
Stanton, who should articulate a

witty, cynical counterpoint to
John Williams' poetry. Azariah,
lacking the quick voice and man
ner needed, fails to project the
doctor's dry humor or his hidden
warmth.
Priscilla Bates as Mattie Wil
liams and Marie Rolle as
Grandma Brown both turn in
solid performances, overcoming
weakly-written dialogue to
explore all the depth and humor
the playwright allowed.
Siti Makini, playing Jeff's
girlfriend, seems shallow and af
fected throughout. Her stilted ac
cent and manner seem utterly
implausible, undermining Jeff's
role as well as her own.
Cochran's production seems
well-conceived but casual. He has
faithfully presented Walker's
script, but allowed easily remedi
able mistakes in characterization
— notably the doctor and Jeff's
girlfriend.

The River Niger, by Joseph A.
Walker, won critical acclaim as
the best 1973 production in New
York, but don't be fooled. It's a
bad play.
Walker apparently never
learned a steadfast rule of literary
art: A writer must show, not tell.
His characters explain their feel
ings rather than reveal them in
drama. They become mere points
of argument in a message melo
drama.
The playwright's diffuse
polemic does offer powerful dis
plays of emotion and ideology.
Unfortunately, it lacks the
dramatic palliatives of character,
dialogue and plot needed to
weave the fireworks into the play.
Story unwieldy
Cluttered subplots and stock
characters — a mother dying of
cancer, a South African girlfriend

with a father imprisoned for sedi
tion, and a grandmother whose
husband was murdered by a
Georgia cracker, for example —
contribute to the play's dramatic
i mplausibil ity.
Palo Alto Community Players
director John Cochran, appa
rently seduced by his vision of
Niger as "quality black drama —
a play of universal themes." fails
to recognize its flaws, much less
repair them.
Only an inspired, vital produc
tion could redeem The liiver
Niger. The Palo Alto group comes
close, but a spotty cast and erratic
direction frustrate their attempt.
TheCommunity Players present a
faithful, creditable version of a
weak play.
Walker's play explores the con
flict between John Williams, a
Harlem housepainter, and his son
Jeff, a recently discharged Air
Force lieutenant.
Jeff comes home to a father who

cannot understand why his son
despises the military, and to fel
low gang members who believe
he has sold them out by planning
to attend law school.
Father impressive
George Felix justice, playing
John Williams, dominates the
stage, melding the disparate parts
of the housepai nter-post
alcoholic-philosopher into a rich
portrait. Justice's impressive
stage presence mutes many of the
script's incongruities.
Cedric Anthony brown does
not quite muster the emotional
force to play Jeff Williams oppo
site Justice. His voice contains a
trace of uncertainty and whining,
his carriage on stage is con
strained at critical moments, and
his anger seldom reaches the sus
tained intensity his part de
mands.
Francis Azariah badly under
plays the engaging Dr. Dudley
Stanton, who should articulate a

witty, cynical counterpoint to
John Williams' poetry. Azariah,
lacking the quick voice and man
ner needed, fails to project the
doctor's dry humor or his hidden
warmth.
Priscilla Bates as Mattie Wil
liams and Marie Rolle as
Grandma Brown both turn in
solid performances, overcoming
weakly-written dialogue to
explore all the depth and humor
the playwright allowed.
Siti Makini, playing Jeff's
girlfriend, seems shallow and af
fected throughout. Her stilted ac
cent and manner seem utterly
implausible, undermining Jeff's
role as well as her own.
Cochran's production seems
well-conceived but casual. He has
faithfully presented Walker's
script, but allowed easily remedi
able mistakes in characterization
— notably the doctor and Jeff's
girlfriend.
