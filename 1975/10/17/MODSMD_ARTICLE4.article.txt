The Seven Per-Cent Solution, by
Nicholas Meyer (Dutton, $6.95;
Ballentine, $1.95)
Nicholas Meyer's novel, The
Seven Per-Cent Solution, is the
most successful book in a new
publishing craze — the revival
of Sherlock Holmes. It is one of a
dozen recent volumes including
biographies, novels, annotated
editions and quiz books dedi
cated to the world's most fam
ous detective.
Meyer's novel, which led the
bestseller list for nine months
and is now being issued in a
paperback edition of several
million, gives an opportunity to
reflect on this current craze.
Sherlock Holmes has cer
tainly never been forgotten.
Thousands of loyal readers have
formed societies and published
magazines in his honor. His
books have always been in
print, and his name has been a
household word ever since Ar
thur Conan Doyle created the in
trepid sleuth nearly 90 years
ago.
Popularity returns
But in the last few years there
has been a tremendous re
surgence of interest in Holmes.
Old books and movies have been
successfully re-released, and
new projects are in the making.
Holmes has become the literary
equivalent of Alaska's North
Slope, a huge natural resource
waiting to be plundered by any

daring entrepreneur.
The Seven Per-Cent Solution
tells how the loyal Doctor Wat
son cures Sherlock Holmes' de
bilitating addiction to cocaine
and in the process solves one of
the crimes of the 19th century.
Planting false clues, Watson
tricks the paranoid Holmes into
going to Vienna in search of his
arch-foe Moriarty. Sherlock's
reclusive brother, Mycroft,
helps in this ruse because Mor
iarty, the "Napoleon of crime,"
is mostly a phantom of Holmes'
classically neurotic imagina
tion.
The real Moriarty (who will
be portrayed by Sir Laurence
Olivier in the film) is actually a
harmless mathematics tutor
who played an unfortunate part
in Holmes' adolescence.
The Freudian dimensions of
the plot are not lost on the au
thor. For who is to cure Holmes
of his cocaine addiction other
than the noted Herr Doktor
Sigmund Freud himself! And
after a quick cure via hypnosis,
which reveals the dark sexual
secrets behind Holmes'
bachelorhood, the Austrian
psycho-analyst helps the bewil
dered English detective prevent
an incipient world war. Not bad
for 250 pages.
Perhaps novel is the wrong
word for Meyer's book. He
claims that he is merely the
editor. The book is reportedly "a
reprint from the reminiscences

of John H. Watson, M.D." Meyer
only stumbled on the long-lost
manuscript by a fortunate acci
dent. He reports that the story
was never published during
Watson's lifetime because of its
scandalous contents.
Tales not masterpieces
Meyer should not be too seri
ously criticized on literary
grounds, however. Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes tales are no
literary masterpieces. In fact
they are not nearly as well
written as the less famous detec
tive stories by Poe, Saki, or
Chesterton.
Doyle's achievement is in the
creation of the enduring charac
ter of Holmes. His undistin
guished (if not choppy) style is
redeemed by Holmes' presence.
In the same way Meyer's book is
saved by its very subject matter.
Although Meyer's novel has
been seriously overpraised, it is
tremendously fun to read. Like a
good bestseller it captures the
reader's attention from the be
ginning and rarely lets go. The
novel's settings, London and
Vienna in the gilded age, are en
chantingly depicted.
The end of the novel might
seem more appropriate in a
grade-B western film than to the
Victorian sleuth's greatest
caper, but Meyer never makes
any pretentions about writing
great literature. The Seven
Per-Cent Solution is ideal for
light reading. No more, no less.

of his cocaine addiction other
than the noted Herr Doktor
Sigmund Freud himself! And
after a quick cure via hypnosis,
which reveals the dark sexual
secrets behind Holmes'
bachelorhood, the Austrian
psycho-analyst helps the bewil
dered English detective prevent
an incipient world war. Not bad
for 250 pages.
Perhaps novel is the wrong
word for Meyer's book. He
claims that he is merely the
editor. The book is reportedly "a

of John H. Watson, M.D." Meyer
only stumbled on the long-lost
manuscript by a fortunate acci
dent. He reports that the story
was never published during
Watson's lifetime because of its
scandalous contents.
Tales not masterpieces
Meyer should not be too seri
ously criticized on literary
grounds, however. Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes tales are no
literary masterpieces. In fact
they are not nearly as well
written as the less famous detec
tive stories by Poe, Saki, or
Chesterton.
Doyle's achievement is in the
creation of the enduring charac
ter of Holmes. His undistin
guished (if not choppy) style is
redeemed by Holmes' presence.
In the same way Meyer's book is
saved by its very subject matter.
Although Meyer's novel has
been seriously overpraised, it is
tremendously fun to read. Like a
good bestseller it captures the
reader's attention from the be
ginning and rarely lets go. The
novel's settings, London and
Vienna in the gilded age, are en
chantingly depicted.
The end of the novel might
seem more appropriate in a
grade-B western film than to the
Victorian sleuth's greatest
caper, but Meyer never makes
any pretentions about writing
great literature. The Seven
Per-Cent Solution is ideal for
light reading. No more, no less.

Sigmund Freud himself! And
after a quick cure via hypnosis,
which reveals the dark sexual
secrets behind Holmes'
bachelorhood, the Austrian
psycho-analyst helps the bewil
dered English detective prevent
an incipient world war. Not bad
for 250 pages.
Perhaps novel is the wrong
word for Meyer's book. He
claims that he is merely the
editor. The book is reportedly "a
reprint from the reminiscences

of John H. Watson, M.D." Meyer
only stumbled on the long-lost
manuscript by a fortunate acci
dent. He reports that the story
was never published during
Watson's lifetime because of its
scandalous contents.
Tales not masterpieces
Meyer should not be too seri
ously criticized on literary
grounds, however. Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes tales are no
literary masterpieces. In fact
they are not nearly as well
written as the less famous detec
tive stories by Poe, Saki, or
Chesterton.
Doyle's achievement is in the
creation of the enduring charac
ter of Holmes. His undistin
guished (if not choppy) style is
redeemed by Holmes' presence.
In the same way Meyer's book is
saved by its very subject matter.
Although Meyer's novel has
been seriously overpraised, it is
tremendously fun to read. Like a
good bestseller it captures the
reader's attention from the be
ginning and rarely lets go. The
novel's settings, London and
Vienna in the gilded age, are en
chantingly depicted.
The end of the novel might
seem more appropriate in a
grade-B western film than to the
Victorian sleuth's greatest
caper, but Meyer never makes
any pretentions about writing
great literature. The Seven
Per-Cent Solution is ideal for
light reading. No more, no less.
