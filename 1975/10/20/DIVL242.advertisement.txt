To harness water for power.
we have built one of the nation's
greatest hydroelectric systems.
In "average" and snowfall
years, hydro provides about
50% of our electric energy. The
force of falling water makes the
wheels go'round in the gener
ating plants.
Hydro generation neither
contaminates nor consumes the
water itself. It is returned to the
rivers undiminished, to serve
agriculture and other vital needs.
Building hydroelectric facili-
ties is expensive, but they are
economical to operate. The low
cost of hydroelectricity is one
reason why our rates, despite
recent increases, remain among
the lowest in the nation.
Oil and natural gas have
become more prominent in our
energy mix in recent years
because nearly all economically
acceptable hydro sites have been
developed. But the costs of these
fossil fuels have been sky-
rocketing. In just 5 years, the
prices for gas have more than
doubled and the cost per barrel
\ of low-sulfur fuel oil has
j quintupled. All but two of the

and more costly, is uranium.
Nuclear power plants can pro-
duce electricity at half the cost
of a new oil-fired plant. Our two
nuclear units at Diablo Canyon
will save our having to buy 24
million barrels of expensive
imported oil a year.
These are the good reasons
why PG&E and other utility
systems, at home and abroad.
are building nuclear plants.
