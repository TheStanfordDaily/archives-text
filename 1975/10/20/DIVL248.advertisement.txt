Today, even so-called "non-technical" courses
(psych, soc, bus ad, to name 3) require a vari
ety of technical calculations—complicated cal
culations that become a whole lot easier when
you have a powerful pocket calculator.
Not surprisingly, there are quite a few such
calculators around, but ours stand apart, and
ahead. We started it all when we introduced the
world's first scientific pocket calculator back in
1972, and we've shown the way ever since.
The calculators you see here are our newest,
the first of our second generation. Both offer you
technology you probably won't find in compet
itive calculators for some time to come, if ever.
Our HP-21 performs all arithmetic, log and
trig calculations, including rectangular/polar
conversions and common antilog evaluations.
