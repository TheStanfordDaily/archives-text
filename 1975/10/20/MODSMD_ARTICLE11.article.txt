# Innovative programs still survive

Long live extradepartmental programs.
That is, long live the independence of ex
tradepartmental programs, referred to as
EDPs in an effort to conserve energy.
The recommendation to allow the EDPs to
remain autonomous made public last week
by an ad hoc panel appointed last year by
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, is certainly welcome news to those
concerned with innovative education.
Certainly the diverse and and intriguing
topics of various SWOPSI ayd Under
graduate Special courses, the unlimited
capacity for original SCIRE projects and the
interest shown over the years for these prog
rams indicate their merit.
While there have been occasional prob
lems with course quality, this certainly
should not justify the termination of the
programs.
Is autonomy good?
Virtually everyone agrees that innovative
courses are essential to the improvement of
educational quality, but a major disagree
ment concerns whether the EDPs should
remain autonomous or whether they should
be absorbed into the appropriate depart
ments.
It has been convincingly argued that the
only way to maintain innovative programs
is to assure their autonomy, as the commit
tee recommends.
Of course the existence of an independent
EDP set —up would not and should not pre
clude innovation within departments.
Two of the University's most popular
classes, Human Sexuality and Calligraphy,
were originally offered under the EDP
framework, only to be incorporated into ap
propriate departments because of their tre
mendous popularity.
And it is not unthinkable that various de

partments will develop innovative courses.
But considering that all departments must
begin by slashing their budgets, it is doubt
ful that any will have money left over to
experiment.
After all, innovative classes involve a
risk; it is doubtful that many will venture to
pursue such risks when they can barely af
ford to fund their regular courses.
So it appears that if innovative programs

are going to remain a vital force in the Uni
versity, they will haVe to be antonomous.
Roles are reversed
There is an even more important reason
that EDPs remain an independent entity.
Currently they provide an opportunity for
qualified students to reverse roles and in
struct their fellow students. It is an oppor
tunity that very few students would other
wise receive.
The panel proposal to staff each porgram
with a half-time student to assist a half-time
professional is another worthwhile en
deavor that would increase student input in
the programs.
But the biggest problem seems to be to
assure that the EDPs have a stable financial
base on which to operate if they remain in
dependent. It is impossible to plan ahead if

one's budget is slashed in half, as was
SCIRE's this past year.
Stable funds needed
Instead of facing annual battles to salvage
enough money to make continuation of the
programs worthwhile, some arrangements
should be made for stable funding.
While it must be expected that the EDPs
will have to face the same budget cutbacks
as other academic departments, they should
not have to worry about sudden funding
cuts that would effectively destroy the prog
rams.
The conclusions reached by the ad-hoc
panel are by no means binding. Their re
commendations will go to the Committe on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US) which will
then report to the Faculty Senate.
It is imperative that students let the C-US,
faculty and especially the administration
know we stand 100 percent behind the au
tonomy of the EDPs. It could be a matter of
life and death . . . for innovative education
at Stanford.

Long live extradepartmental programs.
That is, long live the independence of ex
tradepartmental programs, referred to as
EDPs in an effort to conserve energy.
The recommendation to allow the EDPs to
remain autonomous made public last week
by an ad hoc panel appointed last year by
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, is certainly welcome news to those
concerned with innovative education.
Certainly the diverse and and intriguing
topics of various SWOPSI ayd Under
graduate Special courses, the unlimited
capacity for original SCIRE projects and the
interest shown over the years for these prog
rams indicate their merit.
While there have been occasional prob
lems with course quality, this certainly
should not justify the termination of the
programs.
Is autonomy good?
Virtually everyone agrees that innovative
courses are essential to the improvement of
educational quality, but a major disagree
ment concerns whether the EDPs should
remain autonomous or whether they should
be absorbed into the appropriate depart
ments.
It has been convincingly argued that the
only way to maintain innovative programs
is to assure their autonomy, as the commit
tee recommends.
Of course the existence of an independent
EDP set —up would not and should not pre
clude innovation within departments.
Two of the University's most popular
classes, Human Sexuality and Calligraphy,
were originally offered under the EDP
framework, only to be incorporated into ap
propriate departments because of their tre
mendous popularity.
And it is not unthinkable that various de

partments will develop innovative courses.
But considering that all departments must
begin by slashing their budgets, it is doubt
ful that any will have money left over to
experiment.
After all, innovative classes involve a
risk; it is doubtful that many will venture to
pursue such risks when they can barely af
ford to fund their regular courses.
So it appears that if innovative programs

are going to remain a vital force in the Uni
versity, they will haVe to be antonomous.
Roles are reversed
There is an even more important reason
that EDPs remain an independent entity.
Currently they provide an opportunity for
qualified students to reverse roles and in
struct their fellow students. It is an oppor
tunity that very few students would other
wise receive.
The panel proposal to staff each porgram
with a half-time student to assist a half-time
professional is another worthwhile en
deavor that would increase student input in
the programs.
But the biggest problem seems to be to
assure that the EDPs have a stable financial
base on which to operate if they remain in
dependent. It is impossible to plan ahead if

one's budget is slashed in half, as was
SCIRE's this past year.
Stable funds needed
Instead of facing annual battles to salvage
enough money to make continuation of the
programs worthwhile, some arrangements
should be made for stable funding.
While it must be expected that the EDPs
will have to face the same budget cutbacks
as other academic departments, they should
not have to worry about sudden funding
cuts that would effectively destroy the prog
rams.
The conclusions reached by the ad-hoc
panel are by no means binding. Their re
commendations will go to the Committe on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US) which will
then report to the Faculty Senate.
It is imperative that students let the C-US,
faculty and especially the administration
know we stand 100 percent behind the au
tonomy of the EDPs. It could be a matter of
life and death . . . for innovative education
at Stanford.
