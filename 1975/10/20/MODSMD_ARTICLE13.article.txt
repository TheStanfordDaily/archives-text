Victory prayers?
Editor:
In response to Dan Francis' let
ter (Daily, Oct. 14) regarding Jim
Stump's comments on post game
prayer meetings, we find great
merit in such endeavors.
We suggest the expansion of
such gatherings to include com
petitive interactions further rep
resentative of the "Glory of God"
(eg., the Ali-Frazier bout and
professional hockey). Also, in
realizing that members of the
military are subject to Cod's de
finition of winning, i.e., "put
ting 100 percent effort into the
game for His purpose." we must
not overlook the value of the
post-Cambodian invasion prayer
meeting by the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
Perhaps, though, these com
ments stem from a confusion on
our part. We naively thought
that being Christian meant being
Christlike.
If we are in error on this point,
we thank Francis for setting us
straight.

I can't help but wonder how
Dan Francis in his letter (Daily,
Oct. 14) knows so clearly that
Cod does not take sides during a
football game. The God we know
from the Old Testament was
constantly taking sides in order
to punish, cajole, etc. As for
Jesus in the New Testament, he
could be a hot-headed side-taker
when he wanted to be one.
My feeling is that God wasn't
even watching the Stanford-
UCLA game, but was in Boston
watching the World Series.

Fickle fans
Editor:
At the Oct. 11 football
game, UCLA scored 31 points,
Stanford scored 21, but the Stan
ford spectators scored a big, fat
zero.
In a shameful display, the
Stanford crowd booed its own
football team, which really
should be congratulated for its
all-out try against UCLA despite
lack of student support.
People think booing is "fash
ionable" or "fun." It's not; it
simply shows no class. Booers
(boors) defend themselves by
saying they aren't booing al any
one person or the team, just the
coach.
Obviously, these fickle fans
don't realize that booing reaches
the ears of all the players and
affects each of them. Mike Cor
dova and Coach Jack Christian
sen should be especially com
mended for their excellent
strategies despite rude "advice"
from the spectators.
