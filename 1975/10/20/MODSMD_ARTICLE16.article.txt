# 'Jaws' technical advisor says sharks could do more damage
## 
### JERRY SALOMONE 
"In most shark attacks, the
shark doesn't do all the damage
it could," Leonard J.V. Com
oagno, the technical consultant
tor the movie Jaws, said in a lec
ture Saturday.
The shark's normal prey does
not include humans, Compagno
went on to explain. The different
stimuli the shark receives from
attacking a human often stop it
from continuing with the attack.
Compagno's "mini-course"
on the biology and evolution of
sharks was one of five offered in
the Stanford Alumni
Association's "Octoberfest."
About fifty alumni, many with
their children, listened to Com
pagno give two lectures and
answer dozens of questions
about these poorly understood
creatures.
The lectures were highlighted
by slides showing the diverse
anatomical structures of many
strange looking species.
First model
Compagno, currently finish
ing eight years of work at Stan
ford for his Ph.D. in marine biol
ogy, produced the first model
from which the 24-foot mechani
cal star of Jaws was made. He
also advised the film's animator

on the movements and behavior
of sharks.
Compagno praised Jaws
director Steve Spielberg. "The
technical direction was excel
lent â€” the movie didn't release
you from its grip to the last mi
nutes," he said, calling the
movie a "nice fable." However,
Compagno said he was
"bothered" by some inaccurate
portrayals of shark behavior in
the movie, such as the shark re
peatedly attacking the boat.

"/aws bears the same relation
ship to the great white shark as
Moby Dick does to the whale,"
he concluded.
'Pupping grounds'
Many people in the audience
were surprised to learn that there
are a large variety of sharks in the
San Francisco Bay. The bay is
used as a nursery, or "pupping
ground," for several species to
deposit their young, Compagno
said. Larger species, including
the great white shark, can be

found along the coast, he said.
In his mini-course, Compagno
often mentioned his own work
in the shark world. His doctoral
dissertation will cover the
anatomy and systematics, or sci
entific classification, of the Car
charhinoid sharks.
Compagno was not the only
shark "expert" in the room. Sev
eral of the youngsters seemed to
have extensive knowledge about
both the anatomy and behavior
of some sharks.
