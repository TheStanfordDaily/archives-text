## Cards hold off Huskies 
### RON BECK 
SEATTLEâ€”"If it weren't for
Stanford, Northwest football
would be awfully dull."
Reserve quarterback Jerry
Waldvogel's post-game com
ment couldn't have been more
exact. The Cards tried to make an
exciting thriller out of what
should have been an easy Stan
ford win, and almost came out of
Washington with another loss.
Not that the Huskies were any
thing spectacular. In fact, the
24-21 final score was pretty mis
leading. The Husky offense can
hardly take credit for any points.
Stanford's special teams take
the honors for 14 of the Dogs'
points. Two consecutive
blocked Stanford punts that
went for Husky scores late in the
game caused all the excitement.
No rain
It was that kind of a day. Stan
ford Head Coach Jack Christian
sen should have known that
something was up when the
Seattle skies cleared for the first
time in over a week.
By game time, the only excuse
the Cards would be able to use

for not wiping out the Huskies
was that the field was still wet
from the week's rain.
Stanford scored 10 points in
the first half on a 31-yard field
goal by Mike Langford and a
1-yard quarterback sneak by
Mike Cordova. The Card defense
held Washington to 103 offen
sive yards, keeping the lacklus
ter Husky offense out of Cardinal
territory on every series but one.
Although Langford missed
two field goals in the third quar
ter, another Cordova keeper
went for 12 yards and a touch
down.
Certain romp
At 17-0 with the defense hold
ing firm, a Stanfo.'J romp
seemed certain. The r. ex
citement the 45,000 Wasb'ngton
fans had was booing the Hus
kies' quarterback selection, a de
vice now popular at Stanford to
stave off boredom.
But Stanford's first-string
punter and starting defensive
back, Mike Michel, left the game
with a pulled hamstring early in
the third quarter. Tom Lynn, the
Cards' second-string punter,

didn't make the trip because of
the new NCAA 48-player limit,
leaving James Lofton, a wide
receiver who hadn't punted
since high school, with the kick
ing duties.
Lofton went in to punt from
the Stanford 27-yard line, and
Husky Jim Gaines, a record
holder in the high hurdles and a
9.6 sprinter, blocked the ball be
hind Lofton, where it was picked
up and run into the end zone.
Lofton normally blocks for
Michel in punting situations and
was aware of the pressure
Washington was putting on the
punter. "I knew they had been
rushing hard all day, and my
step is a little slower (than
Michel's)," he said. "I was still
surprised."
A second try
Stanford's next possession
ended four plays later on the
Cardinal 25. Lofton was again
called upon to punt. "Sure I was
nervous," he said. Again, Gaines
broke through and blocked the
punt, and another Husky ran it in
for a score.
Two incomplete Cordova pas
ses, a quarterback sack and a
penalty put the Cards in another
punting situation. This time
Chris called for Mike Langford to
do the punting chores. Langford
got off a 34-yarder under heavy
pressure. "I didn't know if the
blocks were because of (Lofton)
or the rush. (Chris) told me to
take a half-step and punt, and
Mike (Michel) gave me some
last-minute instructions," Lang
ford said. "I was lucky."
Two possessions later, how
ever, the Husky offense drove to
the Card three-yard line after a
50-yard pass. The Stanford de
fense protected its four-point
lead and got the ball back on
downs.
With 53 seconds left in t*he
game, Washington again took
possession on its own 34. Four
plays later, safety Rich Waters
intercepted the ball on the Stan
ford 48 and ran untouched into

the Husky end zone, putting an
end to Washington's chances of
winning.
The game ended with the only
touchdown technically scored
against the Card defense. Waters
intercepted another Husky pass,
this time on the Stanford two
yard line, and fumbled the ball
into the end zone where a
Washington player recovered it
for another score. Whether or not
Waters ever had possession was
debatable, but with only two
seconds left, it really didn't mat
ter.
After the game, a very relieved
Christiansen said, "You can bet
we'll be working on our punting
game this week."
