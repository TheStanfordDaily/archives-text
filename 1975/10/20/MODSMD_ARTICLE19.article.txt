JVs edge Cal Poly
Stanford's junior varsity football team
needed a late fourth quarter touchdown to
top Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's JV, 20-15,
P'riday afternoon at Stanford Stadium. A
sparse crowd saw the Cards come from be
hind to win in a game marked by seven
turnovers.
The Cards scored first with 5:57 remain
ing in the first quarter as linebacker Drew
Nosworthy picked off a pass from Mustang
quarterback Kevin Hall and returned it 42
yards for a touchdown. The snap on the
extra point try was high, but holder Mike
Connor, reacting quickly, carried it in for
two points.
Cal Poly came right back in the second
quarter to tie things up. Running back
Troyce Leatherwood took a handoff and
outran the Card defenders for an 80-yard
touchdown.
When Cal Poly missed a 48-yard field goal
attempt with only 1:15 remaining on the
clock, it appeared the half would end with
the score deadlocked. But the Cards put to
gether a beautiful drive of 60 yards on just
six plays, culminating in a 16-yard touch
down pass from quarterback Turk Schonert
to tight end Marty Smith.
The Cards went into the fourth quarter
with a precarious 14-8 lead which quickly
vanished. Using the quarterback option, Cal

Poly moved down the field easily, storing
on a two-yard plunge. The extra point at
tempt was successful; the Mustangs took a
15-14 lead.
Stanford looked like it was going to come
right back with a score of its own. Card
running back Jim Dodd took the ensuing
kickoff on a reverse and returned the ball to
midfield. On the second play from scrim
mage Billie Anderson, who gained 169
yards on the day, broke loose on a 43-yard
run before being brought down on the Mus
tang three. Hut fullback Phil Francis lost a
fumble at the goal line, and the Cards con
tinued to trail by a single point.
The Card defense held, thus setting the
stage for the winning tally. Schonert hit
John Pyle for a 24-yard gain to the Cal Poly
three. On third down Schonert faked the
ball to his back and diving into the left side
of the line carried it three yards for the
touchdown.
