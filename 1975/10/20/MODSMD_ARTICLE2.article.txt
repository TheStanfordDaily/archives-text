# EZ-A booklets sell 'very well'
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
EZ-A study guides, recently intro
duced on campus, are "selling very
well," according to Sandy Feldman,
one of three seniors producing them,
although some professors have said
they think the guides are of little use to
students in their classes.
Feldman and two partners, David
Fryefield and Shawn Libau, have as
sembled guides consisting of all exams
given the last two years in five science
classes, complete with detailed ans
wers to each question, and explana
tions of some answers.
Booklets cost $3.50 each for Chemis
try 31, Chemistry 131. Biology 21 and
Physics 21, and were first put on sale
Oct. 10, Fryefield said. "We're selling
them outside each class before and
after it meets, and in White Plaza at
noon," he said.
"This is a combination of a money
making enterprise for us and a service
for Stanford students," Feldman said.
"We got the idea after noticing how
many of our friends asked us for old
exams when they were taking these
classes.
"We've gotten an overwhelmingly
favorable response from students,"
Feldman maintained. After the first
Chem 131 midterm, students told the
producers they wouldn't have done as
well without the exams.
Exorbitant price
However Asst. Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni, who teaches Bio 21, said "The
price seems rather exorbitant in terms
of the benefits gained. We keep old
exams on file in the Bio Library, and
hopefully, students know the answers
themselves. I'd say the name EZ-A is a
total misnomer."
Feldman said guides may be offered
for Biology 110. but Lecturer Elizabeth
Center says she is teaching 110 "in a
totally different manner this year. Old
exams wouldn't do students any

good."
Reviewing last year's test "will tell
students what areas they need to work
on," Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen
maintained. "From the student's point
of view these are great practice." An
dersen, who teaches Chem 31, noted
that the Chemistry Library does not
have copies of back exams, "because
they'd be ripped off."
Memorizing an EZ-A booklet would
be no substitute for doing assigned
work, professors said. "I hope nobody
would be stupid enough to try that,"
Simoni said. "Certainly they wouldn't
do it more than once."
No ethical questions
Professors say no ethical questions
are involved in the sale of old exams. "I
can't see any problems," Andersen
said. "After all, my exams aren't
copyrighted." Simoni added. "1 think
it's rather enterprising."
"We didn't expect to charge this
much and make this little," Feldman
added. "As it happens, we're barely
breaking even. Paper costs are a lot
higher than we had thought, and re
searching answers took more time
than we had expected."
Most of the answers in the guide re
ceived full credit at the time that one of
the partners took the actual exam,
Fryefield said. "On the rest of them, we
researched an answer that would get
full credit, or. gave the answer on a
posted answer sheet if there was one."
Actual sales figures had not yet been
tabulated, Feldman said, "but I'd say
we're reaching 12 to 15 percent of the
students in each class."

for Stanford students," Feldman said.
"We got the idea after noticing how
many of our friends asked us for old
exams when they were taking these
classes.
"We've gotten an overwhelmingly
favorable response from students,"
Feldman maintained. After the first
Chem 131 midterm, students told the
producers they wouldn't have done as
well without the exams.
Exorbitant price
However Asst. Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni, who teaches Bio 21, said "The
price seems rather exorbitant in terms
of the benefits gained. We keep old
exams on file in the Bio Library, and
hopefully, students know the answers
themselves. I'd say the name EZ-A is a
total misnomer."
Feldman said guides may be offered
for Biology 110. but Lecturer Elizabeth
Center says she is teaching 110 "in a
totally different manner this year. Old
exams wouldn't do students any

good."
Reviewing last year's test "will tell
students what areas they need to work
on," Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen
maintained. "From the student's point
of view these are great practice." An
dersen, who teaches Chem 31, noted
that the Chemistry Library does not
have copies of back exams, "because
they'd be ripped off."
Memorizing an EZ-A booklet would
be no substitute for doing assigned
work, professors said. "I hope nobody
would be stupid enough to try that,"
Simoni said. "Certainly they wouldn't
do it more than once."
No ethical questions
Professors say no ethical questions
are involved in the sale of old exams. "I
can't see any problems," Andersen
said. "After all, my exams aren't
copyrighted." Simoni added. "1 think
it's rather enterprising."
"We didn't expect to charge this
much and make this little," Feldman
added. "As it happens, we're barely
breaking even. Paper costs are a lot
higher than we had thought, and re
searching answers took more time
than we had expected."
Most of the answers in the guide re
ceived full credit at the time that one of
the partners took the actual exam,
Fryefield said. "On the rest of them, we
researched an answer that would get
full credit, or. gave the answer on a
posted answer sheet if there was one."
Actual sales figures had not yet been
tabulated, Feldman said, "but I'd say
we're reaching 12 to 15 percent of the
students in each class."
EZ-A study guides, recently intro
duced on campus, are "selling very
well," according to Sandy Feldman,
one of three seniors producing them,
although some professors have said
they think the guides are of little use to
students in their classes.
Feldman and two partners, David
Fryefield and Shawn Libau, have as
sembled guides consisting of all exams
given the last two years in five science
classes, complete with detailed ans
wers to each question, and explana
tions of some answers.
Booklets cost $3.50 each for Chemis
try 31, Chemistry 131. Biology 21 and
Physics 21, and were first put on sale
Oct. 10, Fryefield said. "We're selling
them outside each class before and
after it meets, and in White Plaza at
noon," he said.
"This is a combination of a money
making enterprise for us and a service
for Stanford students," Feldman said.
