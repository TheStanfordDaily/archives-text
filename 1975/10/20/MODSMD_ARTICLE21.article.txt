# Poloists batter Bears again

### CHRIS KAMEL 
BERKELEY â€” Stanford's var
sity water polo team brightened
its chances for a Pac>B title
Saturday as the Cards defeated
reigning two-time NCAA
champion Cal, 12-8, placing
themselves in undisputed first
place with a 2-0 league record
while Cal, without three of its
top players, dropped to the cellar
with an 0-2 mark.
It was the second time this
season that the Cards had beaten
the Bears.
"I'm particularly pleased that
we beat Cal in their own pool.
We were kind of crowded be
cause their pool is narrower than

ours, but we had control
throughout the game," said Card
Coach Art Lambert.
From the outset of the match,
the only thing that Cal control
led was the opening face-offs of
the first three quarters. It looked
as if Stanford would have a close
game on its hands for the second
week in a row as the Cards
fought Cal to a 1-1 deadlock at
the end of the first period on
John Roberts' backhand goal
with only 1:37 elapsed in the
game.
Roberts' score was only one of
five tallies for the Altadena
senior. Marty Davis and Drew
McDonald complemented

Roberts with two goals apiece.
Stanford blasted the Bears out
of the game in the second quarter
as the Cards outscored Cal. 5-1,
on single goals by Rick Johann
sen, Davis, Roberts, Paul Clarke
and McDonald, while goalie
Chris Dorst made two crucial
blocks when Cal had a one-man
advantage over Stanford.
Cal did not relinquish the
game without a fight, however,
as after halftime the Bears tal
lied two scores in the first two
and one-half minutes to pull the
Bears back to within two goals at
6-4.
Stanford neutralized Cal's
comeback, as it seemed to do

throughout the game when the
Bears would threaten, with three
goals to make the score 9-5 at the
end of the third quarter
Most of Cal's second-half scor
ing came when the Bears had a
one-man advantage over Stan
ford, but Cal was almost totally
kept in check by three second
half goals by Roberts, two of
which were one and a half mi
nutes apart in the fourth quarter
and upped the Stanford lead to
11-5.
In what Coach Lambert termed
a "fine defensive effort" on
the part of the Cards, McDonald
led the Cards with three steals.
"I was concerned with our
mental attitude during the week.
1 wasn't sure if the UCLA game
would put a real question mark
on whether we would be men
tally ready to play Cal. We had a
good attitude, however; we have
tough athletes," Lambert said.
Stanford challenges Long
Beach State and UC Irvine this
Friday and Saturday, respec
tively, but the Pac-8 break prom
ises not to be a vacation. Irvine
has the distinction of being the
only team to have beaten the
Cards, who now have compiled a
12-1 season record. That single
loss, 6-3, was the Cards' initial
game of the season and Coach
Lambert feels things have
changed.
"We have really jelled now.
The last time we played Irvine,
we were not that sure of ourse
lves. We are definitely a better
team now," he emphasized.
