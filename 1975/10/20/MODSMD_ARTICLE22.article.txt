# Pac-8 roundup
## Southerners all win 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
As expected, the South swept
the North Saturday in the Pac-B's
mixed-up version of the Civil
War. Key battles were fought at
Berkeley, Los Angeles, Spokane
and Seattle, where Stanford
edged Washington, 24-21.
Cal, which seems to be impro
ving every week, breezed past
Oregon State (0-6), 51-24 at Ber
keley. The Bears have now won
four consecutive games after los
ing their first two.
"We've gained momentum for
the past four weeks," said Cal
coach Mike White. "This was a
solid victory in every way. Now
we're in a good position for our

next two games — UCLA and
USC — to prove we're conten
ders in the Pac-8 race. This is a
deserving team."
Cal's Chuck Muncie ran for
149 yards, scored three touch
downs and threw a 47-yard TD
pass to Wesley Walker in less
than two and one-half quarters of
action.
The Oregon Ducks achieved in
Los Angeles what will probably
be the highlight of their season
— losing to third-ranked USC by
only 14 points, 17-3. It's news
when Oregon (0-6) plays within
14 points of anybody, much less
USC (6-0).
The Trojans once again

showed next to nothing offen
sively except the running of
Ricky Bell. The junior fullback
scored USC's only offensive
touchdown and went over the
1000-yard mark for the season
with a 128-yard ground effort.
Tackle Gary Jeter was out
standing on defense for USC,
blocking four passes and sacking
the quarterback twice.
