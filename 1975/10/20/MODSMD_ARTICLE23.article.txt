# Scotchers smash Sac. St.

### JOHN ROOS PAM BAGLEY 
The Stanford field hockey
team defeated Sacramento
State Saturday in what was
supposed to be a pivotal game
for the Cards. The scotchers
won their second league game

by a 3-0 score, despite a score
less first half.
Stanford looked as if it were
running scared in first half ac
tion. "We weren't thinking and
we were running slow," Coach
Shirley Schoof recalled, "We
just weren't playing our kind of

game in the first half."
Stanford's leading scorer,
Mandy Read, explained her
team's unusual mediocre per
formance in the first part of the
game. "We were scared to
death. They almost killed us in
the tournament a couple of
weeks ago." Another player,
Jessie Gerrard attributed the
poor playing to "too much par
tying last night."
But the scotchers "really
poured it on" in the second
half, and proved once again
that they are serious conten
ders for the national champ
ionship this year.
"We finally began to work as
a team," said (loach Schoof.
With only five minutes of
play in the second half, Onnie
Kiliefer scored Stanford's first
goal. Sukie Jackson and Mandy
Read shot in the other two
scores.
Stanford's defense led by
Martha Anderson and goalie
Betsy Morris, proved to be too
tough for the husky Sac
ramento St. team.
"They were good and we
were lucky," said Anderson.
Morris disagreed. "This team is
the greatest!" she exclaimed.
Next Saturday Stanford will
face San Jose State in what
Schoof thinks will be "just as
tough as today's game." But, as
Morris said, "The spirit is there
1 and we're all confident about
k the future."
