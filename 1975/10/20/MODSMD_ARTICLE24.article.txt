Kissinger toasts China detente
PEKING — With a faltering attempt to speak Chinese,
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger dined with his
Chinese hosts yesterday. He declared, "There is no rela
tionship to which the United States assigns greater sig
nificance."
However, in a toast during a dinner he gave for Kis
singer shortly after the secretary of state arrived in Peking,
Chinese Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua said that, "The
stark reality is not that detente has developed to a new
stage, but that the danger of a new world war is mount
ins"
Kissinger, who sat expressionless during Chiao's re
marks, followed with his own toast in which he mildly
reproached the Chinese attitude but said the United States
will be guided by China's actions, not rhetoric.
Detente with the U.S.S.K. continues as announcement
of a new long-term agreement for the sale of American
grain to the Soviet Union is expected in the next two to
four days, according to a senior American official.
Remiro, Little trial starts today
LOS ANGELES — Two Symbionese Liberation Army
members go on trial today in a bullet-proof courtroom.
Already convicted of murder. Joseph Remiro and Russell
Little will be tried on new charges of attempted murder
and possession of explosives.
Remiro and Little were convicted earlier this year of the
ambush murder of Oakland Schools Superintendent Mar

The current trial stems from a shootout with police at
Concord, Calif., during their arrest Jan. 10, 1974.
Veterans overcollected benefits
WASHINGTON — Veterans collected $446.4 million in
GI Bill education benefits to which they were not entitled
during the last fiscal year.
The Veterans Administration (VA) has managed to re

cover $333.5 million of the overpayment money, but mill
ions more may never be collected.
The main reasons for overpayments are veterans drop
ping classes or quitting school, without either the college
or the veteran promptly notifying the VA.
More coups feared in Portugal
LISBON, Portugal — A member of Portugal's Re
volutionary Council said yesterday the right wing is pre
paring to take power. At the same time, centrists reported
they had evidence that a left-wing coup is in the making.
The contradictory statements illustrated the continued
tension in the country. Army leaders met tor four hours
Saturday in an attempt to deal with the lack of military
discipline that has led to mutinies and demonstrations
against the government.
