KZSU Friday that the San Mateo
County Jail would be hit with "mas
sive explosives" if Patty Hearst were
not released, according to KZSU News
Director Peter Winik.
San Mateo County Sheriff John
McDonald said the KZSU threat was
the first telephone threat concerning
Patty Hearst's captivity in the jail. He
said he received a few written threats
when she was first arrested.
McDonald said he takes all bomb
threats "pretty seriously," but it is
"pretty close to impossible" to plant a
bomb in the eight-story building, he
added. The building was not searched
after the bomb threat was reported.
Winik said lie could not hear very
clearly the end of the message which
could have contained specifics about
the bombing date and time.
