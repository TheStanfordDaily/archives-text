# Health inspectors check dining halls
## 
### LAURA KENNEDY KAREN CAESAR 
After an outbreak of stomach illness
at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity last
week, which health inspectors attri
buted to food poisoning, students and
cooks are taking a closer look at their
kitchens.
The Daily surveyed a representative
sampling of 24 student living groups
and generally agreed with Santa Clara
Health Inspector John Hansen, who
recently found thut sanitary condi
tions range from "excellent" in the
University-operated dining halls to
"very, very bad" in the co-ops. Most
independent houses and some co-ops
are considered comparable to the
Food Service.
Not too surprisingly, the more strict
the management, the cleaner the
kitchen. The Food Service, with a
hierarchy of managers, head hashers,
and full-time professionals, keeps
tight control over its employes, and as
a result, has spotless kitchens.
As an example of its control, the
Food Service requires all workers to
hold back their hair by white hats or
hairnets, and they are not permitted to
wear open-toed shoes. In contrast, at
Terra and Jordan, long-haired girls in
bare feet were preparing dinner when

the Daily reporter arrived.
The only form of supervision at a
co-op is the communal good will of its
members. One Terra resident said it
"depends on the people" whether they
will clean up.
Supervision varies
The supervision of independent
kitchens varies from house to house.
Usually, responsibilities are vaguely
divided between the cook, house man
ager and head hasher. As Hansen put
it, "Cooks are sort of the managers of
their own kitchens, but not really."
This makes it difficult sometimes to
know who is responsible for equip
ment maintenance and who would be
blamed in case of food poisoning.
However, most cooks in indepen
dent houses have many years of ex
perience and keep a possessive watch
over their kitchens. Warren Morris,
who has cooked at Kairos for 18 years,
says."The kids don't resent my telling
them to clean up."
The co-ops lack experienced per
sonnel to guide in food handling, and
instead, relv on common sense. At one
co-op. Theta Chi, the rule about throw
ing out leftovers is "You smell 'em."
according to one resident.
Cenerally. common sense is enough,
but potentially dangerous situations
exist in the co-ops. Open 50-pound
sacks of flour sit on the floor, while in
the Food Service flour is stored in tin,
insect- and vermin-proof containers.
At Terra, a large sack of powdered milk
lay open by a trash can, and a tear near
the bottom of the sack had been taped
shut. Jordan, a clean kitchen in most
ways, had cigarette ashes on a working
surface by the oven. Ants were found
crawling through the pantry at Col
umbae.
Open kitchens
What complicates sanitation in both
co-ops and independent houses that
hire cooks is that most of them have an
open-kitchen policy.
One of the health inspector's chief
complaints is that "far too many (peo
ple) have access to the kitchen." At
ZAP, for instance, approximately 50
residents fix their lunch and breakfast
independently. At Terra, "it looks like
a Jackson Pollock painting from noon
to about 6," according to resident
Alden Marin.
Management and experience in food
handling were found to be better
guarantees of day-to-day sanitation
than periodic county health inspec
tions.

Health Inspector Hansen must regu
larly inspect some 90 establishments.
He finds time to investigate each Stan
ford kitchen usually only two or three
times a year.
Inspections infrequent
Not only are inspections infrequent,
but inspectors are limited by time. Al
though Hansen is supposed to check
on food handling, his schedule does
not always permit him to come at
mealtimes, and sometimes he does not
even see the cook. He usually spends a
half-hour to an hour at each kitchen.
Alan Cummings, director of student
housing, tries to inspect both the liv
ing and eating quarters of all student
residences on a monthly basis. He
says, "We end up inspecting our prob
lem children at least monthly and
probably sometimes more often."
Five co-ops — Jordan, Synergy,
Terra, Hammarskjold and Columbae
— are no longer inspected by the
county, as of May 6 of this year. Be
cause they do not hire a cook, they do
not fall under the definition of a "re
staurant."
Instead, Wilson inspects these
kitchens directly. Cummings says the
"co-ops are not necessarily our worst
problem, but we do pay more attention
to them . . . (There's) more potential to
get out of hand."
The Office of Student Housing has
the power to close down a co-op
kitchen, but Cummings says,"I don't
find it beneficial to close a student
kitchen." In the past, he has hired an
outside contractor at the house's ex
pense to clean up the kitchen.
If conditions deteriorate to the point
where Cummings has to close down a
kitchen, he estimates the chances of
the "existence of that living group
beyond that year is about zero."

kitchens varies from house to house.
Usually, responsibilities are vaguely
divided between the cook, house man
ager and head hasher. As Hansen put
it, "Cooks are sort of the managers of
their own kitchens, but not really."
This makes it difficult sometimes to
know who is responsible for equip
ment maintenance and who would be
blamed in case of food poisoning.
However, most cooks in indepen
dent houses have many years of ex
perience and keep a possessive watch
over their kitchens. Warren Morris,
who has cooked at Kairos for 18 years,
says."The kids don't resent my telling
them to clean up."
The co-ops lack experienced per
sonnel to guide in food handling, and
instead, relv on common sense. At one
co-op. Theta Chi, the rule about throw
ing out leftovers is "You smell 'em."
according to one resident.
Cenerally. common sense is enough,
but potentially dangerous situations
exist in the co-ops. Open 50-pound
sacks of flour sit on the floor, while in
the Food Service flour is stored in tin,
insect- and vermin-proof containers.
At Terra, a large sack of powdered milk
lay open by a trash can, and a tear near
the bottom of the sack had been taped
shut. Jordan, a clean kitchen in most
ways, had cigarette ashes on a working
surface by the oven. Ants were found
crawling through the pantry at Col
umbae.
Open kitchens
What complicates sanitation in both
co-ops and independent houses that
hire cooks is that most of them have an
open-kitchen policy.
One of the health inspector's chief
complaints is that "far too many (peo
ple) have access to the kitchen." At
ZAP, for instance, approximately 50
residents fix their lunch and breakfast
independently. At Terra, "it looks like
a Jackson Pollock painting from noon
to about 6," according to resident
Alden Marin.
Management and experience in food
handling were found to be better
guarantees of day-to-day sanitation
than periodic county health inspec
tions.

Health Inspector Hansen must regu
larly inspect some 90 establishments.
He finds time to investigate each Stan
ford kitchen usually only two or three
times a year.
Inspections infrequent
Not only are inspections infrequent,
but inspectors are limited by time. Al
though Hansen is supposed to check
on food handling, his schedule does
not always permit him to come at
mealtimes, and sometimes he does not
even see the cook. He usually spends a
half-hour to an hour at each kitchen.
Alan Cummings, director of student
housing, tries to inspect both the liv
ing and eating quarters of all student
residences on a monthly basis. He
says, "We end up inspecting our prob
lem children at least monthly and
probably sometimes more often."
Five co-ops — Jordan, Synergy,
Terra, Hammarskjold and Columbae
— are no longer inspected by the
county, as of May 6 of this year. Be
cause they do not hire a cook, they do
not fall under the definition of a "re
staurant."
Instead, Wilson inspects these
kitchens directly. Cummings says the
"co-ops are not necessarily our worst
problem, but we do pay more attention
to them . . . (There's) more potential to
get out of hand."
The Office of Student Housing has
the power to close down a co-op
kitchen, but Cummings says,"I don't
find it beneficial to close a student
kitchen." In the past, he has hired an
outside contractor at the house's ex
pense to clean up the kitchen.
If conditions deteriorate to the point
where Cummings has to close down a
kitchen, he estimates the chances of
the "existence of that living group
beyond that year is about zero."
After an outbreak of stomach illness
at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity last
week, which health inspectors attri
buted to food poisoning, students and
cooks are taking a closer look at their
kitchens.
The Daily surveyed a representative
sampling of 24 student living groups
and generally agreed with Santa Clara
Health Inspector John Hansen, who
recently found thut sanitary condi
tions range from "excellent" in the
University-operated dining halls to
"very, very bad" in the co-ops. Most
independent houses and some co-ops
are considered comparable to the
Food Service.
Not too surprisingly, the more strict
the management, the cleaner the
kitchen. The Food Service, with a
hierarchy of managers, head hashers,
and full-time professionals, keeps
tight control over its employes, and as
a result, has spotless kitchens.
As an example of its control, the
Food Service requires all workers to
hold back their hair by white hats or
hairnets, and they are not permitted to
wear open-toed shoes. In contrast, at
Terra and Jordan, long-haired girls in
bare feet were preparing dinner when

the Daily reporter arrived.
The only form of supervision at a
co-op is the communal good will of its
members. One Terra resident said it
"depends on the people" whether they
will clean up.

crawling through the pantry at Col
umbae.
Open kitchens
What complicates sanitation in both
co-ops and independent houses that
hire cooks is that most of them have an
open-kitchen policy.
One of the health inspector's chief
complaints is that "far too many (peo
ple) have access to the kitchen." At
ZAP, for instance, approximately 50
residents fix their lunch and breakfast
independently. At Terra, "it looks like
a Jackson Pollock painting from noon
to about 6," according to resident
Alden Marin.
Management and experience in food
handling were found to be better
guarantees of day-to-day sanitation
than periodic county health inspec
tions.

Health Inspector Hansen must regu
larly inspect some 90 establishments.
He finds time to investigate each Stan
ford kitchen usually only two or three
times a year.
Inspections infrequent
Not only are inspections infrequent,
but inspectors are limited by time. Al
though Hansen is supposed to check
on food handling, his schedule does
not always permit him to come at
mealtimes, and sometimes he does not
even see the cook. He usually spends a
half-hour to an hour at each kitchen.
Alan Cummings, director of student
housing, tries to inspect both the liv
ing and eating quarters of all student
residences on a monthly basis. He
says, "We end up inspecting our prob
lem children at least monthly and
probably sometimes more often."
Five co-ops — Jordan, Synergy,
Terra, Hammarskjold and Columbae
— are no longer inspected by the
county, as of May 6 of this year. Be
cause they do not hire a cook, they do
not fall under the definition of a "re
staurant."
Instead, Wilson inspects these
kitchens directly. Cummings says the
"co-ops are not necessarily our worst
problem, but we do pay more attention
to them . . . (There's) more potential to
get out of hand."
The Office of Student Housing has
the power to close down a co-op
kitchen, but Cummings says,"I don't
find it beneficial to close a student
kitchen." In the past, he has hired an
outside contractor at the house's ex
pense to clean up the kitchen.
If conditions deteriorate to the point
where Cummings has to close down a
kitchen, he estimates the chances of
the "existence of that living group
beyond that year is about zero."
After an outbreak of stomach illness
at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity last
week, which health inspectors attri
buted to food poisoning, students and
cooks are taking a closer look at their
kitchens.
The Daily surveyed a representative
sampling of 24 student living groups
and generally agreed with Santa Clara
Health Inspector John Hansen, who
recently found thut sanitary condi
tions range from "excellent" in the
University-operated dining halls to
"very, very bad" in the co-ops. Most
independent houses and some co-ops
are considered comparable to the
Food Service.
Not too surprisingly, the more strict
the management, the cleaner the
kitchen. The Food Service, with a
hierarchy of managers, head hashers,
and full-time professionals, keeps
tight control over its employes, and as
a result, has spotless kitchens.
As an example of its control, the
Food Service requires all workers to
hold back their hair by white hats or
hairnets, and they are not permitted to
wear open-toed shoes. In contrast, at
Terra and Jordan, long-haired girls in
bare feet were preparing dinner when

the Daily reporter arrived.
The only form of supervision at a
co-op is the communal good will of its
members. One Terra resident said it
"depends on the people" whether they
will clean up.
Supervision varies
The supervision of independent
kitchens varies from house to house.
Usually, responsibilities are vaguely
divided between the cook, house man
ager and head hasher. As Hansen put
it, "Cooks are sort of the managers of
their own kitchens, but not really."
This makes it difficult sometimes to
know who is responsible for equip
ment maintenance and who would be
blamed in case of food poisoning.
However, most cooks in indepen
dent houses have many years of ex
perience and keep a possessive watch
over their kitchens. Warren Morris,
who has cooked at Kairos for 18 years,
says."The kids don't resent my telling
them to clean up."
The co-ops lack experienced per
sonnel to guide in food handling, and
instead, relv on common sense. At one
co-op. Theta Chi, the rule about throw
ing out leftovers is "You smell 'em."
according to one resident.
Cenerally. common sense is enough,
but potentially dangerous situations
exist in the co-ops. Open 50-pound
sacks of flour sit on the floor, while in
the Food Service flour is stored in tin,
insect- and vermin-proof containers.
At Terra, a large sack of powdered milk
lay open by a trash can, and a tear near
the bottom of the sack had been taped
shut. Jordan, a clean kitchen in most
ways, had cigarette ashes on a working
surface by the oven. Ants were found
crawling through the pantry at Col
