# Health inspectors check dining halls
## 
### LAURA KENNEDY KAREN CAESAR 
After an outbreak of stomach illness
at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity last
week, which health inspectors attri
buted to food poisoning, students and
cooks are taking a closer look at their
kitchens.
The Daily surveyed a representative
sampling of 24 student living groups
and generally agreed with Santa Clara
Health Inspector John Hansen, who
recently found thut sanitary condi
tions range from "excellent" in the
University-operated dining halls to
"very, very bad" in the co-ops. Most
independent houses and some co-ops
are considered comparable to the
Food Service.
Not too surprisingly, the more strict
the management, the cleaner the
kitchen. The Food Service, with a
hierarchy of managers, head hashers,
and full-time professionals, keeps
tight control over its employes, and as
a result, has spotless kitchens.
As an example of its control, the
Food Service requires all workers to
hold back their hair by white hats or
hairnets, and they are not permitted to
wear open-toed shoes. In contrast, at
Terra and Jordan, long-haired girls in
bare feet were preparing dinner when

the Daily reporter arrived.
The only form of supervision at a
co-op is the communal good will of its
members. One Terra resident said it
"depends on the people" whether they
will clean up.
Supervision varies
The supervision of independent
kitchens varies from house to house.
Usually, responsibilities are vaguely
divided between the cook, house man
ager and head hasher. As Hansen put
it, "Cooks are sort of the managers of
their own kitchens, but not really."
This makes it difficult sometimes to
know who is responsible for equip
ment maintenance and who would be
blamed in case of food poisoning.
However, most cooks in indepen
dent houses have many years of ex
perience and keep a possessive watch
over their kitchens. Warren Morris,
who has cooked at Kairos for 18 years,
says."The kids don't resent my telling
them to clean up."
The co-ops lack experienced per
sonnel to guide in food handling, and
instead, relv on common sense. At one
co-op. Theta Chi, the rule about throw
ing out leftovers is "You smell 'em."
according to one resident.
Cenerally. common sense is enough,
