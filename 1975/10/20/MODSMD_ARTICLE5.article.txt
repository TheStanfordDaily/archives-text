# N.J. trial opens today
## Profs view arguments in mercy-killing case 
### ROSARIO De La TORRE 
A trial to determine the legality of
disconnecting a 21-year-old woman's
life-supporting respirator begins today
in Morristown, N.j.
"Whatever happens, it will set a pre
cedent," said Stanford Law Prof. John
Kaplan of the case involving Karen
Ann Quinlan.
The trial will pit two legal concepts
against one another: mercy killing and
an individual's right to refuse special
medical practices.
Karen Quinlan has been in a coma
since last April after apparently acci
dentally ingesting a dangerous com
bination of alcohol and sleeping pills,
the Associated Press (AP) has re
ported.
She has been hospitalized in the in
tensive care ward of St. Claire's Hospi
tal for nearly six months while a
mechanical respirator has helped keep

her alive.
All sides in the case agree that Karen
Quinlan is still alive, whether defined
in traditional terms of respiration and
heartbeat or in more modern terms of
"brain death," AP reported.
"There would be no problem if the
criteria for brain death had been fulfil
led," said Surgery Prof. John Hanbery.
According to Hanbery, in California
if brain death had been determined,
and it were the family's wish, life sup
port devices could be turned off with
no legal problems.
In 1974. California joined Kansas,
Maryland and Minnesota in passing a
law defining death as the "irreversible
cessation of brain function."
Death defined
A Harvard Medical School commit
tee established the currently accepted
brain death criteria in 1968 — a lack of
response to stimulation, no movement
or spontaneous breathing for at least
one hour, no reflexes and a flat elec
troencephalogram constitute "brain
death."
New Jersey Atty. Gen. William F.
Hyland and Morris County Prosecutor
Donald G. Collester have joined the
case because, under New Jersey state
law, causing a death, mercifully or not,
is homicide, a violation of criminal
law which the government is obliged
to prosecute.
The petition before Superior Court
Judge Robert Muir Jr. was filed last
month by Joseph T. Quinlan, adoptive
father of Karen. The petition seeks to
have the attorney general and pro
secutor enjoined from bringing crimi
nal charges against the plaintiffs, the
doctors or the hospital, should permis
sion be given to shut off the respirator.
Prosecution's argument
Paul W. Armstrong, a Morristown
attorney representing Quinlan and his
family in the case, in a pre-trial brief
indicated he would argue that recent
court decisions have given individuals
the right to determine their own course
of medical treatment.
Armstrong has said Karen on two
occasions expressed the wish not to be
maintained by extraordinary medical
efforts should she become terminally
ill.
Her wishes should be enforced,
Armstrong said, under constitutional
guarantees of the right to privacy and
self-determination. He also asserted
that the constitutional guarantee of
freedom of religion should apply.
Daniel R. Coburn, the attorney ap
pointed to represent Quinlan during
the case, has said her medical condi

tion is not hopeless, and the petition
by Joseph Quinlan should be denied
until all chances of a cure have been
exhausted. He asked the court to ap
point a guardian for Quinlan other
than her father.
Armstrong is expected to call medi
cal experts to testify that Quinlan's
condition is irreversible and de
teriorating. The state's right to inter
fere with an individual's rights to pri
vacy and freedom of religion would
not apply, Armstrong indicated, be
cause the preservation of lite standard
does not apply in the Quinlan case.

by Joseph Quinlan should be denied
until all chances of a cure have been
exhausted. He asked the court to ap
point a guardian for Quinlan other
than her father.
Armstrong is expected to call medi
cal experts to testify that Quinlan's
condition is irreversible and de
teriorating. The state's right to inter
fere with an individual's rights to pri
vacy and freedom of religion would
not apply, Armstrong indicated, be
cause the preservation of lite standard
does not apply in the Quinlan case.
A trial to determine the legality of
disconnecting a 21-year-old woman's
life-supporting respirator begins today
in Morristown, N.j.
"Whatever happens, it will set a pre
cedent," said Stanford Law Prof. John
Kaplan of the case involving Karen
Ann Quinlan.
The trial will pit two legal concepts
against one another: mercy killing and
an individual's right to refuse special
medical practices.
Karen Quinlan has been in a coma
since last April after apparently acci
dentally ingesting a dangerous com
bination of alcohol and sleeping pills,
the Associated Press (AP) has re
ported.
She has been hospitalized in the in
tensive care ward of St. Claire's Hospi
tal for nearly six months while a
mechanical respirator has helped keep

her alive.
All sides in the case agree that Karen
Quinlan is still alive, whether defined
in traditional terms of respiration and
heartbeat or in more modern terms of
"brain death," AP reported.
"There would be no problem if the
criteria for brain death had been fulfil
led," said Surgery Prof. John Hanbery.
According to Hanbery, in California
if brain death had been determined,
and it were the family's wish, life sup
port devices could be turned off with
no legal problems.
In 1974. California joined Kansas,
Maryland and Minnesota in passing a
law defining death as the "irreversible
cessation of brain function."
Death defined
A Harvard Medical School commit
tee established the currently accepted
brain death criteria in 1968 — a lack of
response to stimulation, no movement
or spontaneous breathing for at least
one hour, no reflexes and a flat elec
troencephalogram constitute "brain
death."
New Jersey Atty. Gen. William F.
Hyland and Morris County Prosecutor
Donald G. Collester have joined the
case because, under New Jersey state
law, causing a death, mercifully or not,
is homicide, a violation of criminal
law which the government is obliged
to prosecute.
The petition before Superior Court
Judge Robert Muir Jr. was filed last
month by Joseph T. Quinlan, adoptive
father of Karen. The petition seeks to
have the attorney general and pro
secutor enjoined from bringing crimi
nal charges against the plaintiffs, the
doctors or the hospital, should permis
sion be given to shut off the respirator.
Prosecution's argument
Paul W. Armstrong, a Morristown
attorney representing Quinlan and his
family in the case, in a pre-trial brief
indicated he would argue that recent
court decisions have given individuals
the right to determine their own course
of medical treatment.
Armstrong has said Karen on two
occasions expressed the wish not to be
maintained by extraordinary medical
efforts should she become terminally
ill.
Her wishes should be enforced,
Armstrong said, under constitutional
guarantees of the right to privacy and
self-determination. He also asserted
that the constitutional guarantee of
freedom of religion should apply.
Daniel R. Coburn, the attorney ap
pointed to represent Quinlan during
the case, has said her medical condi

tion is not hopeless, and the petition
by Joseph Quinlan should be denied
until all chances of a cure have been
exhausted. He asked the court to ap
point a guardian for Quinlan other
than her father.
