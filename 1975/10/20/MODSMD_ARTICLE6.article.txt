# At AAUP meeting
## Prof outlines student aid plan 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
"Higher education prices itself out
of the market" at private institutions
like Stanford, causing many students
to attend less expensive and "less ade
quate" community colleges, a promi
nent academician said here Friday.
Speaking before approximately 25
people in the Meyer Library Forum
Room, Duke Law Prof. William Van
Alstyne, president of the American
Association of University Professors
(AAUP), outlined a plan which would
give most students state tax money for
use at private colleges.
The plan, already adopted in North
Carolina and Virginia, asks the state
legislature to give a student 50 percent
of the tuition he would pay if he went
to a state college to use towards his
private college education.
Under such a plan, said Van Alstyne,
the private institution would retain
freedom over its own programming.
Also, the amount of money received
would be large enough to make a dif
ference in institutional budgets yet
small enough so that institutions
would have to work "at least as hard"
at soliciting contributions on their
own.
Van Alstyne suggested that because
a university benefits from elements
outside its domain the expense of "ex
ternal benefits should be paid for by
the taxpayers and the federal govern
ment." He did not state specifically
what these outside benefits are.

Cited by Van Alstyne as "less well
known" causes of the current
economic pinch at private schools are
the federally mandated social progams
suchas social security taxes payments
to the General Occupational Safety
and Health Administration Act and
compliance with affirmative action
guidelines.
In addition, while corporate, state,
local and tuition contributions have
remained "fairly stable," there has
been a decline in federal contributions
through the veteran's bill and Basic
Educational Opportunity Grants

(BEOG).
The veteran's program "has not been
renewed," said Van Alstyne, and
hence, universities lose the income
that would have come from veterans
who decide to return to school on the
G.I. Bill.
BEOGs, while quite "noble" in con
cept and providing up to $1500 per
student for tuition "are so small that
they are of no significant use to the
institution," said Van Alstyne, a Stan
ford law graduate and former visiting
professor here.

PRIVATE STL'DENT AID? —Duke Law Prof. William Van Alstyne describes
his plan for state aid to students attending private schools.
Van Alstyne also gave what he
termed a "neutral, sobering observa
tion," on the effectiveness of collective
bargaining for university faculty, say
ing it is "useful in some limited
respects" but should be "reservedonly
as a defensive unit to make sure that
the faculty is not hurt more than other
departments in the university."
While collective bargaining ob
tained higher salaries and more be
nefits for faculty at some schools. Van
Alstyne said, "Getting a higher salary
now is like squeezing water out of a
stone when there is no water to
squeeze."
Collective bargaining can create a
"we and they" situation between ad
ministration and faculty, and costs
money, Van Alstyne said.
