# Man seeks euthanasia
## 
### 
PLEASANT HILL (AP)—"l want
somebody to kill me now, or give me
an opportunity to do it myself," says
Delmar Stuermer, whose enemy is the
oxygen bottle in his room.
"I've been told there's nothing that
can be done for me," said the 59-year
old emphysema victim. "1 know 1 can
never go home again. I'm a dead man
right now."
Doctors have told Stuermer that he
has a few months to a year to live. But
even that's too long for the twice di
vorced former postman, who says he
can bear the pain no longer.
"You see that SOB?" he said, point
ing to a green oxygen tank in the
corner of the room at the rest home
where hebelieves he will die. A plastic
tube runs from the tank into his nose,
filling his ravaged lungs with air.
'Shouldn't have to'
"Anyone who has to depend on
mechanical devices to live shouldn't
have to if they haven't got a future," he
declared, speaking with obvious anger
and bitterness.
Emphysema robs the lungs of their
elasticity. The victim is forced to
breathe harder to get a normal amount
of oxygen into his lungs. Doctors do
not know exactly what causes the dis
ease, which strikes about one million
persons a year in this country.
Until recently, Stuermer thoroughly
enjoyed life. He was an avid hunter
and fisherman and had traveled exten
sively. He enjoyed spending time with
his four children and 13 grandchildren
and was drawing a good pension from
the U.S. Postal Service, where he had
worked for 37 years.
Regrets smoking
Perhaps his only regret was smok
ing. Stuermer was a three-pack-a-day
man.
"I was a fool," he said. "I should
have listened to the people smarter
than me who said to lay off those damn
cigarettes."
Nevertheless, Stuermer had battled
the disease to a standoff until a year
ago. "I woke up feeling poorly one
morning, and suddenly the em
physema I lived with for so long de
cided to take over, and there wasn't a
damn thing 1 could do.
"I've asked my doctor for a pill but
he won't do it,"he continued. "That
Southern California man, who re
cently died after unplugging himself
from his dialysis machine, and I are
soul brothers."
Stuermer was referring to Chuck
McCracken a Loma Linda, Calif, man
who refused to undergo difficult kid
ney machine treatments.

tube runs from the tank into his nose,
filling his ravaged lungs with air.
'Shouldn't have to'

mechanical devices to live shouldn't
have to if they haven't got a future," he
declared, speaking with obvious anger
and bitterness.
Emphysema robs the lungs of their
elasticity. The victim is forced to
breathe harder to get a normal amount
of oxygen into his lungs. Doctors do
not know exactly what causes the dis
ease, which strikes about one million
persons a year in this country.
Until recently, Stuermer thoroughly
enjoyed life. He was an avid hunter
and fisherman and had traveled exten
sively. He enjoyed spending time with
his four children and 13 grandchildren
and was drawing a good pension from
the U.S. Postal Service, where he had
worked for 37 years.
Regrets smoking
Perhaps his only regret was smok
ing. Stuermer was a three-pack-a-day
man.
"I was a fool," he said. "I should
have listened to the people smarter
than me who said to lay off those damn
cigarettes."
Nevertheless, Stuermer had battled
the disease to a standoff until a year
ago. "I woke up feeling poorly one
morning, and suddenly the em
physema I lived with for so long de
cided to take over, and there wasn't a
damn thing 1 could do.
"I've asked my doctor for a pill but
he won't do it,"he continued. "That
Southern California man, who re
cently died after unplugging himself
from his dialysis machine, and I are
soul brothers."
Stuermer was referring to Chuck
McCracken a Loma Linda, Calif, man
who refused to undergo difficult kid
ney machine treatments.
PLEASANT HILL (AP)—"l want
somebody to kill me now, or give me
an opportunity to do it myself," says
Delmar Stuermer, whose enemy is the
oxygen bottle in his room.
"I've been told there's nothing that
can be done for me," said the 59-year
old emphysema victim. "1 know 1 can
never go home again. I'm a dead man
right now."
Doctors have told Stuermer that he
has a few months to a year to live. But
even that's too long for the twice di
vorced former postman, who says he
can bear the pain no longer.
"You see that SOB?" he said, point
ing to a green oxygen tank in the
corner of the room at the rest home
where hebelieves he will die. A plastic
tube runs from the tank into his nose,
filling his ravaged lungs with air.
