# Court ends SP strike
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Southern Pacific (SP) railroad trains
resumed normal operations on the
Peninsula Saturday after a federal
judge ordered striking clerks back to
work.
The temporary injunction, granted
by U.S. District Judge Oliver J. Carter,
ended a one day walkout of the
Brotherhood of Railroad and Airline
Clerks over disputed work rules. The
judge scheduled a hearing for Wed
nesday to determine whether the
back-to-work order should become
permanent.
The walkout halted passenger and
freight trains in six western states
when other railway workers, includ

ing engineers, refused to cross picket
lines. The strike affected some 30,000
Amtrak and SP employes, of whom
only 5400 were union clerks.
On the San Francisco Peninsula,
commuter service was halted, forcing
thousands of stranded workers to use
cars and buses instead. Greyhound
Bus Lines added buses Friday to ac
commodate some of the 8500 regular
passengers of the idled San Jose-San
Francisco SP route.
It was the sixth time in 20 months
that local rail commuters were sud
denly forced to seek other means of
transportation.
Four Amtrak trains, including the

Coast Starlight lines, were halted in
mid-route when the strike began
Thursday evening. In some cases pas
sengers were taken the remainder of
the trip by bus.
Supervisory personnel manned a
limited number of SP freight trains
carrying perishables or key industrial
items, according to a railroad spokes
man.
SP officials said the strike violated a
current contract with the union which
carries a "no strike" provision. Union
officials replied that the provision
does not apply to conflicts over certain
work regulations.
The current nation-wide contract,
signed by the union last July, granted
clerks a 41 percent wage increase.
However, it did not resolve conflicts
over the right of the company to assign
clerks to duties not part of their regular
jobs.
I'hese conflicts have the sub
ject of recent railroad-union negotia
tions, but the talks broke down Thurs
day, and the walkout followed.
"In many cases it (Southern Pacific's
policy) means employes will come to
work in a suit and end up working in
the baggage room," a union official re
portedly told the San Jose Mercury.
Also disputed was whether emp
loyes reassigned to other jobs should
get overtime.
Charlie Coleman, international vice
president of the union said that
Brotherhood and SP officials had met
Friday and agreed to negotiations at
"the earliest possible date," the
Mercury also reported.
The Southern Pacific Transporta
tion Co. provides the dominant prop
ortion of rail service in California,
Oregon. Washington, Arizona. Utah
and New Mexico.
