# Jews need house
## 
### 
Robert Smith

Last Tuesday, the Food Ser
vice offered as a first choice,
pork and as a second choice,
shrimp. Gentiles probably won't
recognize the significance of
this.
Though some students may
know that Jews are forbidden to
eat pork, very few probably
know that they also cannot eat
shellfish — shrimp included.
Thus, for those Jewish students
eating in dorms who keep
kosher, Tuesday's meal was a
total disaster, consisting solely
of salad, icecream and perhaps a
glass of milk.
The Food Service's and the
University's failure to consider
Jewish dietary regulations, al
though 10 percent of the student
body is Jewish, is abhorrent.
Though admittedly less than
half of the Jewish students keep
kosher, for those who do,
Tuesday's meal was a disgrace.
Furthermore, there are many
other Jewish students who
would like to keep kosher, but
because of meals like Tuesday's,
are deprived of the opportunity.
A Jewish theme house is the
obvious answer to the problem.
Certainly the Jews, as a distinc
tive minority, are as entitled to a
theme house as are the blacks,
chicanos and Asian Americans.
Judaism isn't solely a religion
— it is a culture as well. Judaism
has not one but two languages —
Hebrew and Yiddish — which
only Jews use.
Jews are in as much or more
danger of assimilation into
WASP society as are blacks,
chicanos and Asian Americans.
Jews who have lived in a predo
minantly Jewish neighborhood
before coming to Stanford suffer
as much of a culture shock as do
the other minority students.
In a Jewish theine house, Jews
could eat kosher, speak Jewish
languages, study and discuss
Jewish arts, celebrate festivals

outwardly and openly without
attracting strange glances and
become immersed in thecultural
aspects of Judaism.
They could also meet other
Jewish students and pursue
similar interests. These ideas
were the basis for establishing
the other theme houses and are
certainly commensurate with
those reasons given for the estab
lishment of the French theme
house.
Larry Horton, dean of residen
tial affairs, has consistently
turned down Jewish theme
house requests. His arguments
for refusing to grant the theme
house are contradictory, uncon
vincing and vague.
First he said that the Jews are
too large a group for a theme
house, then he declared that if
the Jews are given a theme
house, "every other small
group" which requests a theme
house would have to be granted
one. He stated that no theme
house could be given a kitchen.
Then he gave one to the French
house.
He claimed that the minority
theme houses were established
only to facilitate minority
groups' academic integration
into Stanford, as supposedly
members of minority groups had
a tendency not to perform up to
the average white student at
Stanford.
Then he admitted that al
though the Asian Americans
perform better than the average
white student, "they just wrote a
good proposal." The Jewish stu
dents have written several good
proposals — why weren't they
approved?
There must be a Jewish theme
house at Stanford next year —
and there will be. And that's a
promise.

those reasons given for the estab
lishment of the French theme
house.
Larry Horton, dean of residen
tial affairs, has consistently
turned down Jewish theme
house requests. His arguments
for refusing to grant the theme
house are contradictory, uncon
vincing and vague.
First he said that the Jews are
too large a group for a theme
house, then he declared that if
the Jews are given a theme
house, "every other small
group" which requests a theme
house would have to be granted
one. He stated that no theme
house could be given a kitchen.
Then he gave one to the French
house.
He claimed that the minority
theme houses were established
only to facilitate minority
groups' academic integration
into Stanford, as supposedly
members of minority groups had
a tendency not to perform up to
the average white student at
Stanford.
Then he admitted that al
though the Asian Americans
perform better than the average
white student, "they just wrote a
good proposal." The Jewish stu
dents have written several good
proposals — why weren't they
approved?
There must be a Jewish theme
house at Stanford next year —
and there will be. And that's a
promise.

Last Tuesday, the Food Ser
vice offered as a first choice,
pork and as a second choice,
shrimp. Gentiles probably won't
recognize the significance of
this.
Though some students may
know that Jews are forbidden to
eat pork, very few probably
know that they also cannot eat
shellfish — shrimp included.
Thus, for those Jewish students
eating in dorms who keep
kosher, Tuesday's meal was a
total disaster, consisting solely
of salad, icecream and perhaps a
glass of milk.
The Food Service's and the
University's failure to consider
Jewish dietary regulations, al
though 10 percent of the student
body is Jewish, is abhorrent.
Though admittedly less than
half of the Jewish students keep
kosher, for those who do,
Tuesday's meal was a disgrace.
Furthermore, there are many
other Jewish students who
would like to keep kosher, but
because of meals like Tuesday's,
are deprived of the opportunity.
A Jewish theme house is the
obvious answer to the problem.
Certainly the Jews, as a distinc
tive minority, are as entitled to a
theme house as are the blacks,
chicanos and Asian Americans.
Judaism isn't solely a religion
— it is a culture as well. Judaism
has not one but two languages —
Hebrew and Yiddish — which
only Jews use.
Jews are in as much or more
danger of assimilation into
WASP society as are blacks,
chicanos and Asian Americans.
Jews who have lived in a predo
minantly Jewish neighborhood
before coming to Stanford suffer
as much of a culture shock as do
the other minority students.
In a Jewish theine house, Jews
could eat kosher, speak Jewish
languages, study and discuss
Jewish arts, celebrate festivals

outwardly and openly without
attracting strange glances and
become immersed in thecultural
aspects of Judaism.
They could also meet other
Jewish students and pursue
similar interests. These ideas
were the basis for establishing
the other theme houses and are
certainly commensurate with
those reasons given for the estab
lishment of the French theme
house.
