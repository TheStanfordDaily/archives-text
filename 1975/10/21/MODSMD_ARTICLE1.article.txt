# Crazy tactics entertain voters
## ASSU candidates bobble balloons, mesmerize freshmen 
### RANDY BLOCK LEANA GIANNINI 
Colored balloons and flyers which really flew —
these could have been elements of a carnival, but
instead they were campaign strategies during last
week's ASSU Senate election.
Sophomore Carole Houck, the top vote-getter in
the election, stood in White Plaza both election
days, handing out flyers and holding balloons.
The balloons were intended to draw attention to
Houck's campaign. "They did not represent a cam
paign promise," Houck said.
Some candidates used out-of-the-ordinary tech
niques to emphasize the need for innovative ideas
in the Senate.
Plane flyers
At the Sunday Flicks, sophomores Randy
Bergerac and Kit Weld handed out flyers with di
rections for making paper airplanes drawn on
them. They also distributed flyers with lollipops
attached to them at the UCLA-Stanford football

game.
"People get sick of looking at posters in dorms.
We wanted to do something different. We showed
people that we have imagination, that we're in
novative," Weld remarked.
Bergerac said some environmentalists criticized
their campaign tactics as a waste of paper.
Weld, who lost the election along with Bergerac,
said he couldn't determine whether students con
sidered the paper airplanes and lollipops too
frivolous. However, he said, "If they took the time
to read the poster, they saw that it was serious."
Humorous hoopla
Steve Westly, a sophomore who ran on the Ham
mer and Coffin slate, tried to be humorous and even
sarcastic in his posters, specifically to "make peo
ple realize how ridiculous the election claims re
ally are."
Westly, whose success hinges on the overseas
campuses' vote count, said he wanted to win to
prove to students that candidates with ludicrous

promises could get as much accomplished in office
as those candidates who promised everything.
Houck said she did not promise anything in her
posters because she did not know if she could fulfill
any promises. She campaigned door-to-door, she
said.
"After the election a lot of people said that the
fact that I came around motivated them to go out
and vote," she said.
Focus on frosh
Houck and other candidates concentrated on
freshman dorms. Freshman Jim Reitzes, who lost,
remarked, "The freshmen are the easiest to influ
ence, the most interested and the least apathetic
students on campus."
Houck said freshmen questioned her about the
issues, but unlike some upperclassmen, freshmen
took her seriously.

BALLOONS FOR BALLOTS — A campaign worker for top-vote getterCarole
Houck works the White Plaza "precinct." Other candidates didn't fare so well
with zanier election strategies, but most ASSU election hopefuls agreed that
reaching impressionable freshmen was the key to victory.
Weld said he and Bergerac concen
trated on freshmen because "Fresh
men listen more and are more recep
tive. We told freshmen about a part of
campus life that they didn't know
about. Upperclassmen know many
candidates already and are biased."

In this election and past elections,
some candidates took advantage of
their looks as part of their campaign
strategy.
One student who ran in the Council
of Presidents election last spring said
she specifically campaigned at the
fraternities because she felt fraternity

men would pay more attention to the
election if a woman talked to them
about the issues. She always wore a
dress in order to look her best.
Houck said that she dressed like a
"normal student" and wore school
clothes. "1 didn't think 1 needed to
dress up." Dressing too casually or too
formally offends people, she said.
Some candidates did not spend
much time on their campaign. Senior
Dan Poston, who ran for senior class
president last year, said he did not
spend much time on his Senate cam
paign this year. "I didn't think it was
worth the effort. The Senate per se is
not that powerful within the adminis
trative structure of the University."
Poston said students have little faith
in student government at Stanford. "1
think that the students perceive the
student government as they did in
high school — as just another activity,
like athletics."
Reitzes added that if the ASSU had
more power students would be more
concerned about it.
