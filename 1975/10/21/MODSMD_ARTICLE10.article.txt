# Tenure criteria need explaining
## 
### 
Wags and critics of academia
have often asserted that the uni
versity is the last medieval in
stitution. Although this conten
tion is in some ways unfair, it
certainly applies to the process
of granting tenure to junior fa
culty members at Stanford.
Despite the furor aroused last
winter when several respected
junior assistant professors were
denied tenure, there are no signs
that the University has made its
tenure process less arcane.
The administration's lack of
enthusiasm for reform has
perhaps been encouraged by the
apparent decline in interest of
the tenure controversy.
Some tenure critics believe
that the recent decisions to grant
tenure to several junior profes
sors is a sign that the administra
tion has responded to student
and faculty protests.
Both Paul Sniderman of polit
ical science and Lee Ross of
psychology were given tenure
during the summer despite ini
tial rumors that they had been
denied tenure.
Individual cases
But persons who base their
criticism of the tenure process
on individual cases — most not
ably, that of jerry Irish, whose
failure to receive tenure last year
produced widespread outrage —
ignore the basic flaw in the te
nure process.
The process' basic problem is
not the University's failure to
promote many assistant profes
sors.
Tenure is not a right; it is a
reward for a select few profes
sors who show special academic
promise. Except for periods of
unusual expansion, Stanford has
never granted tenure to more
than about one-third of its assis
tant professors.
The problem with the process
is that the University's failure to
explain how it decides whether
or not to grant tenure. This
makes intelligent criticism of
individual decisions exceed
ingly difficult and it impedes
student efforts to influence the
process.
The University administration
is only hurting itself by refusing
to make the process more open.

Assuming that the University
has good reasons for denying
professors tenure, its refusal to
make those reasons public un
dermines its own credibility.
Committee revealed
Indeed, the existence of the
powerful Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee,
whose recommendations the

President's Advisory Board on
tenure usually accepts, was not
made known to the students
until the Daily uncovered it dur
ing the autumn of 1973.
The names of its six members
are still kept secret and it has
been known to issue three sen
tence explanations for its deci
sions to unsuccessful tenure
candidates.
The University could begin to
open the tenure process to pub
lic view by explaining the
criteria on which its decisions
are based. It could explain the
importance of teaching vis a vis
research and issue guidelines
regarding the types of research
that are preferred in different
departments.
The University should also
urge departments to exercise
harsher judgment before re
commending professors for te
nure.
In recent years, departments
have virtually always recom
mended to the A&P committee
that their assistant professors be
given tenure.
Departments hypocritical
As former Asst. English Prof.
Emerson Brown observed last
spring, departments are hypoc
ritical to complain that the A&P
committee has overruled their
recommendations when they re
commend tenure for every junior
faculty member knowing full
well that only a few can receive

tenure.
If the departments recom
mended only some of their
members for tenure, departmen
tal influence in the tenure pro
cess would increase.
Departmental attempts to in
crease faculty size by recom
mending everyone for tenure
could be stopped by establishing
at Stanford the Harvard system
of imposing rigid limits on the
size of each department.
Finally, and most importantly
to students, the administration
should establish a procedure to
gauge student opinion of profes
sors who are being considered
for tenure.
Student opinion
While students are obviously
not qualified to make final te
nure decisions, their opinions
should be taken more systemati
cally into consideration than
currently is the case.
At the present time, student
consultation depends upon the
whims of departmental leaders
who occasionally submit stu
dent letters to the A&P Commit
tee or upon students who them
selves take the initiative.
Perhaps the best way to re
place this archaic, erratic sys
tem has been suggested by
Bradwell Smith, dean of Carle
ton College.
He recently wrote that "every
year the committee on promo
tion and tenure should request
from each student a letter defin
ing the good and bad points of
any teacher he may have."
Smith noted that students who
take the trouble to fill out such a
form are probably "those most
interested in educational ques
tions and therefore should have
more thoughtful opinions."
Support for such a procedure
is growing. A recent New York
Times article said that while in
1966, only 11 percent of colleges
provided for formal student
participation in the tenure pro
cess, 24 pecent provided for it by
1974.

A few months from now, after
the administration inevitably
will have denied tenure to sev
eral more professors, the issue
will again inflame student opin

ion here. If the University can't
produce evidence that it is con
sidering reforming the tenure
process, administrators should
brace themselves for harsh criti
cism.
