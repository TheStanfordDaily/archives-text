# Wives' legal rights

On Oct. 29, "Alice Doesn't
Day," women libbers will refuse
to do whatever they normally do
that helps support "the system."
Their purpose is to protest
women's "oppressed" status
and promote passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA).
Feminists have said much in
recent months about men's "op
pressed" status, particularly re
garding men's obligation to
support their families — so
much, in fact, that the women's
liberation movement became a
men's liberation movement.
Apparently everyone is op
pressed, and we are now in the
midst of a persons' liberation
movement, with passage of the
ERA supposedly to liberate us
all.
However, if the ERA passes,
our equal rights under the new
"system" will be far more li
mited than many envision.
Moreover, we can be sure no of
ficial "affirmative action" will
be forthcoming to establish
50-50 quotas in the vocation of
homemaking.
Since it is ridiculous to expect
a significant voluntary exodus of
men from the marketplace into
the home, our liberation from
rights as parents will be more
than many bargained for.
The only roadblock to this so
called liberation — and all its
implications — is wives' legal
right, still existing in most
states, to have their husbands
support them without equal fi
nancial obligation on their own
part. Without guaranteeing
women any legal rights they do
not now have, the ERA would
remove this one deterrent to
"liberation."
Only the more astute protes
tors will be aware that Alice
Doesn't Day constitutes "affir
mative action" urging govern
ment to take over complete di
rection of everyone's life from
birth to death.
