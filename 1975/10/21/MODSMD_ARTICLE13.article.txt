## Chief commoner 'Scoop' Jackson: nurturing an image 
### MARK FUNK 
(First of two parts)
There were no crowds at Portland International Airport to greet
Western Airlines Flight 729 or Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington
as he flew in from Los Angeles. Just the usual airport types. None of
the dignitaries were there that might have turned out for the arrival
of, say, a Kennedy. No television cameramen. No policemen, save
one manning an anti-hijacking device. No Secret Servicemen. No
placards. No supporters. Just two reporters and one of Scoop's local
campaign people. The reporters had driven down from Seattle that
morning.
Deplaning, Jackson and three aides moved quickly through the
terminal. Nobody paid much attention to them. Jackson was carry
ing his own bag.
Carrying his own bag! This man could be our next President.
Jackson is a notorious "have" in a field of Democratic "have nots"
and could land his party's Presidential nomination simply because
his campaign organization is larger and better financed than any
other candidate's except George Wallace's.
The next night Jackson would hold a fund raiser in Seattle which
would enrich his campaign war chest by $100,000. But he was
carrying his own bag.

Scoop Jackson is nurturing his image as commoner-in-chief.
It has been a mixed year for him. He has raised considerable sums
of money and his organization — which was forged in 1972 — is
veteran and growing.
On the other hand, there are signs that the national press is
beginning to train its sights on the Jackson voting record — particu
larly his stands during the Vietnam years. He is being scrutinized

more closely than other candidates at this time and will almost
certainly be forced to defend a public record which goes back as far
as World War II in the primary elections.
Some of Jackson's opponents — such as Rep. Morris Udall
(D-Ariz.) and former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter — are count
ing on personality to transcend issues in the early primaries. Since
neither has been in the limelight extensively they could qualify as
the Democrats' "new face." Jackson, however, has to justify 25
years in the Senate and controversial votes on military spending,
detente and energy conservation while repudiating his reputation
as the "senator from Boeing." These are more volatile, and poten
tially embarassing issues thanpersonality.They could hurt Jackson.
No drawback
But he's not convinced this will be a drawback to his candidacy.
"I think the individuals have to relate to the issues," Jackson said
on a flight from Portland to Seattle last August. "In 1976 it will
depend on how each candidate will be able to relate to the
economy. Current issues come first in this one. Inflation and un
employment. That's how I see it."
Some people, apparently, view it differently.
Press Secretary Brian Corcoran measures Jackson's media ex
posure in terms of how many times his man has beenon the national
news in a given week. He is pleased n he makes it three times. But
Corcoran is aware that a number of magazine articles have come out
recently which have painted Jackson in a most unfavorable light.
They have centered on his past voting record and they have ques
tioned his stands on Vietnam.
"What do you do?" Corcoran asks. "You give a writer a break
and he stabs you in the back."
'Sensationalism'
It is a little known fact that there was once a Stanford under
graduate known as Henry Jackson. He was here for a quarter in the
summer of 1931 and studied under Political Science Prof. Graham
Stuart. Most of his time was spent at the Hoover Institution.
"I was taking three classes," Jackson said. "International rela
tions, the League of Nations and psychology. I went to Stanford
with the idea of going into the foreign service after graduation."
But the Depression set in and the foreign service stopped hiring
people. Jackson said he decided to go pre-law and went back to the
University of Washington.
"Dr. Stuart didn't give me an A," he added. "Just an A minus."

American Legion in Pittsburgh, Pa. during that group's state convention. The July edition of
Pittsburgh Magazine ran a cover story concerning Soviet influence on the area's economy entitled
"The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming." Scoop was there to exorcize them. He railed
against detente and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), criticized the Ford administration
and invoked the name of Soviet author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn — all to the approval of the crowd of
about 2000. As Jackson left, and Legionnaires rose to their feet to applaud the Washington senator, a
fortyish matron snapped a picture of him and cried, "I loved you on the Mike Douglas Show."

fortyish matron snapped a picture of him and cried, "I loved you on the Mike Douglas Show."

There were no crowds at Portland International Airport to greet
Western Airlines Flight 729 or Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington
as he flew in from Los Angeles. Just the usual airport types. None of
the dignitaries were there that might have turned out for the arrival
of, say, a Kennedy. No television cameramen. No policemen, save
one manning an anti-hijacking device. No Secret Servicemen. No
placards. No supporters. Just two reporters and one of Scoop's local
campaign people. The reporters had driven down from Seattle that
morning.
Deplaning, Jackson and three aides moved quickly through the
terminal. Nobody paid much attention to them. Jackson was carry
ing his own bag.
Carrying his own bag! This man could be our next President.
Jackson is a notorious "have" in a field of Democratic "have nots"
and could land his party's Presidential nomination simply because
his campaign organization is larger and better financed than any
other candidate's except George Wallace's.
The next night Jackson would hold a fund raiser in Seattle which
would enrich his campaign war chest by $100,000. But he was
carrying his own bag.

Scoop Jackson is nurturing his image as commoner-in-chief.
It has been a mixed year for him. He has raised considerable sums
of money and his organization — which was forged in 1972 — is
veteran and growing.
On the other hand, there are signs that the national press is
beginning to train its sights on the Jackson voting record — particu
larly his stands during the Vietnam years. He is being scrutinized

more closely than other candidates at this time and will almost
certainly be forced to defend a public record which goes back as far
as World War II in the primary elections.
Some of Jackson's opponents — such as Rep. Morris Udall
(D-Ariz.) and former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter — are count
ing on personality to transcend issues in the early primaries. Since
neither has been in the limelight extensively they could qualify as
the Democrats' "new face." Jackson, however, has to justify 25
years in the Senate and controversial votes on military spending,
detente and energy conservation while repudiating his reputation
as the "senator from Boeing." These are more volatile, and poten
tially embarassing issues thanpersonality.They could hurt Jackson.
No drawback
But he's not convinced this will be a drawback to his candidacy.
"I think the individuals have to relate to the issues," Jackson said
on a flight from Portland to Seattle last August. "In 1976 it will
depend on how each candidate will be able to relate to the
economy. Current issues come first in this one. Inflation and un
employment. That's how I see it."
Some people, apparently, view it differently.
Press Secretary Brian Corcoran measures Jackson's media ex
posure in terms of how many times his man has beenon the national
news in a given week. He is pleased n he makes it three times. But
Corcoran is aware that a number of magazine articles have come out
recently which have painted Jackson in a most unfavorable light.
They have centered on his past voting record and they have ques
tioned his stands on Vietnam.
"What do you do?" Corcoran asks. "You give a writer a break
and he stabs you in the back."
'Sensationalism'
It is a little known fact that there was once a Stanford under
graduate known as Henry Jackson. He was here for a quarter in the
summer of 1931 and studied under Political Science Prof. Graham
Stuart. Most of his time was spent at the Hoover Institution.
"I was taking three classes," Jackson said. "International rela
tions, the League of Nations and psychology. I went to Stanford
with the idea of going into the foreign service after graduation."
But the Depression set in and the foreign service stopped hiring
people. Jackson said he decided to go pre-law and went back to the
University of Washington.
"Dr. Stuart didn't give me an A," he added. "Just an A minus."

about 2000. As Jackson left, and Legionnaires rose to their feet to applaud the Washington senator, a

(First of two parts)
There were no crowds at Portland International Airport to greet
Western Airlines Flight 729 or Sen. Henry Jackson of Washington
as he flew in from Los Angeles. Just the usual airport types. None of
the dignitaries were there that might have turned out for the arrival
of, say, a Kennedy. No television cameramen. No policemen, save
one manning an anti-hijacking device. No Secret Servicemen. No
placards. No supporters. Just two reporters and one of Scoop's local
campaign people. The reporters had driven down from Seattle that
morning.
Deplaning, Jackson and three aides moved quickly through the
terminal. Nobody paid much attention to them. Jackson was carry
ing his own bag.
Carrying his own bag! This man could be our next President.
Jackson is a notorious "have" in a field of Democratic "have nots"
and could land his party's Presidential nomination simply because
his campaign organization is larger and better financed than any
other candidate's except George Wallace's.
The next night Jackson would hold a fund raiser in Seattle which
would enrich his campaign war chest by $100,000. But he was
carrying his own bag.

Scoop Jackson is nurturing his image as commoner-in-chief.
It has been a mixed year for him. He has raised considerable sums
of money and his organization — which was forged in 1972 — is
veteran and growing.
On the other hand, there are signs that the national press is
beginning to train its sights on the Jackson voting record — particu
larly his stands during the Vietnam years. He is being scrutinized

more closely than other candidates at this time and will almost
certainly be forced to defend a public record which goes back as far
as World War II in the primary elections.
Some of Jackson's opponents — such as Rep. Morris Udall
(D-Ariz.) and former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter — are count
ing on personality to transcend issues in the early primaries. Since
neither has been in the limelight extensively they could qualify as
the Democrats' "new face." Jackson, however, has to justify 25
years in the Senate and controversial votes on military spending,
detente and energy conservation while repudiating his reputation
as the "senator from Boeing." These are more volatile, and poten
tially embarassing issues thanpersonality.They could hurt Jackson.
No drawback
But he's not convinced this will be a drawback to his candidacy.
"I think the individuals have to relate to the issues," Jackson said
on a flight from Portland to Seattle last August. "In 1976 it will
depend on how each candidate will be able to relate to the
economy. Current issues come first in this one. Inflation and un
employment. That's how I see it."
Some people, apparently, view it differently.
Press Secretary Brian Corcoran measures Jackson's media ex
posure in terms of how many times his man has beenon the national
news in a given week. He is pleased n he makes it three times. But
Corcoran is aware that a number of magazine articles have come out
recently which have painted Jackson in a most unfavorable light.
They have centered on his past voting record and they have ques
tioned his stands on Vietnam.
"What do you do?" Corcoran asks. "You give a writer a break
and he stabs you in the back."
'Sensationalism'
It is a little known fact that there was once a Stanford under
graduate known as Henry Jackson. He was here for a quarter in the
summer of 1931 and studied under Political Science Prof. Graham
Stuart. Most of his time was spent at the Hoover Institution.
"I was taking three classes," Jackson said. "International rela
tions, the League of Nations and psychology. I went to Stanford
with the idea of going into the foreign service after graduation."
But the Depression set in and the foreign service stopped hiring
people. Jackson said he decided to go pre-law and went back to the
University of Washington.
"Dr. Stuart didn't give me an A," he added. "Just an A minus."

JACKSON AND THE LEGIONNAIRES — Sen. Henry )ackson (D-Wash.) addresses members of
American Legion in Pittsburgh, Pa. during that group's state convention. The July edition of
Pittsburgh Magazine ran a cover story concerning Soviet influence on the area's economy entitled
"The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming." Scoop was there to exorcize them. He railed
against detente and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), criticized the Ford administration
and invoked the name of Soviet author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn — all to the approval of the crowd of
about 2000. As Jackson left, and Legionnaires rose to their feet to applaud the Washington senator, a
