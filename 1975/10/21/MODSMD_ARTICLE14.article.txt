Why will the Stanford Main Lib
rary not accept student meal
cards as valid identification to
check out books? -M.S.
Ah, the question of the age!
Frankly, this one puzzles us,
though, since UGLY will accept
meal cards and the Main Library
won't.
According to Gloria Stockton,
chief librarian of the circulation
department, the logic is that only
registered students can check
out books. However, it is not
necessary to be a registered stu
dent to get a meal card. In addi
tion, Stockton said, it is possible
to get a meal ticket (but not an
ID) while still having a register
hold on your registration. Since
these holds can be for overdue
library books, the library obvi
ously does not want to check out
books to students who have
them.

Finally, Stockton said that it
would be impossible for her staff
to remember which cards that
various University personnel
carry are valid to check out
books. "We'd never be able to
recognize all the different
cards," she said. "Our whole
system wouldn't operate." Con
squently, the library has chosen
to accept only those identifica
tion cards listed in the Guide to
Administrative Organizations,
Policies and Procedures - Stan
ford University, Memo No. 28. (a
true administrator's bureaucra
tic Bible).
The interesting statistic is that
only two non-registered stu
dents have meal cards this quar
ter. These two petitioned to live
in housing although they are not
registered. There are more of
these in the spring(B7 last year),
but it is still a tiny minority.
