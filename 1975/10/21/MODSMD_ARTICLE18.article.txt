## Reputation exceeds achievement

Alvin Ailey and his City Center Dance Theater have
never been closer to the pinnacle of public acclaim than
they are now, though by some standards they have
never been less deserving.
The Ailey company has just completed a week of
sold-out, standing-room-only performances at U.C.'s
Zellerbach Auditorium. Yet even in this atmosphere of
adulation only one work was premiered, a revival of
Lester Horton's Liberian Suite, while the most recent
Ailey composition performed, Hidden Rites, was over
two years old.
As a choreographer Ailey's most disturbing short
comings are his failures to challenge his dancer's
abilities and his audiences intellect. Instead of expand
ing his works in the ethnic, modern and jazz dance
idioms that he has popularized, Ailey has been content
to simply grind out one imitative and slick dance after
another.
He has not really created a genuinely successful or
unique piece since his soulful Revelations fifteen years
ago. (And as dance critic Arlene Croce mockingly sug
gested, "Perhaps it's time we saw Revelations as a fluke
rather than a signature-piece.")
Most of Ailey's choreography, with the possible ex
ception of Revelations, betrays a very limited use of
space, music and gesture. He employs the same center
stage pyramidal cluster of wiggling dancers, the same
fisty grabs upward, and the same pelvic thrusts in Night
Creatures, Revelations and Hidden Rites, and each
time with the same predictable and self-conscious styl
ing.
It is in his use of music that Ailey most clearly reveals
himself as essentially a pop choreographer. Instead of

designing movement that is substantive enough to
stand on its own, Ailey's choreographies ae often belit
tled and vulgarized by their obvious dependency on the
music. Regardless of whether he uses a big band Duke
Ellington score Night Creature, or an effusive song
(Love Songs) as accompaniment, the resulting work is
equally meretricious.
Night Creature, the afternoon opening piece, was a
wonderfully theatrical production, complete with
dramatic spotlights and slinky, glittering costumes. The
trouble was it looked more like a Broadway revue than a
dance concert. #
In Night Creature Ailey is conscious of the music's
dominance, and so are we. Throughout the ballet the
dancers maintain a constant rhythmic tension and
pulse, never for an instant daring to pause or counter
point the sound. The fast unison hip bumps and jazzy
walks were all impeccably timed; but the loud Ellington
score had a hypnotically seductive quality, making the
dancers seem like visual ornaments for the sound. Even
if there had been no movement Ellington's score in
sisted on an emotional crescendo, and when it failed to
happen in the movement the only release was applause.
The most pleasant surprise on the afternoon's prog
ram was Ulysses Dove's rendition of Ailey's three-part
solo, Love Song. Dove, a former member of Merce
Cunningham's company, is one of Ailey's most versatile
and unaffected dancers. He imparts a special clarity and
ease to his movements without adding any of the right
athleticism that typifies most of Ailey's males.
One of the most striking features of Ailey's style of
movement is its unrelenting tension. The dancers never
really "let go" while they are dancing, unless they fall
flat on the floor, as the soloist in Love Songs does bet

ween each section. Ailey's technique borrows freely
from Martha Graham'sstvlizedcontractions and spiral
falls, but even she allows for an ocasional release.
In contrast to Ailey's incontinent brazenness, Lester
Horton's Liberian Suite (1952) is unaffected and
natural. Horton was one of the first individuals to
choreograph ethnic dances for a racially mixed com
pany. And if not for his untimely death in 1953 he
would probably rival, if not surpass, Ailey.
Liberian Suite began with a brief musical prologue of
"1 like the Sunrise." Afterward, the curtain rose on a
cardboad mobile of geometric shapes, and below, a
group of men squatted in deep plies, while a cluster of
women contracted up to sitting at an agonizingly slow
tempo. After a judicious assortment of head rolls and
flat-footed spins in place, the dancers departed, reenter
ing with their stars, Judith Jamison and Dudley Wil
liams. Although Jamison was in good form, she is no
longer the powerful dancer she once was. Nonetheless
she continues to enchant audiences hungry for a star
with her unusual size and cool and graceful carriage.
The fourth piece performed at the matinee, John
Butler's After Eden, was a slow and repetitive duet. Both
Enid Britten and Michihiko Oka as the cast-out pair
were skilled dancers. Yet the paucity of the choreog
raphy, which alternated between collapsing and yearn
ing gestures, gave them little to go on in the way of
content or characterization.
In fact, much of Ailey's and Butler's choreography
seems to be consciously de-individualized. They both
like to work with bodies and groups rather than per
sonalities and people.
