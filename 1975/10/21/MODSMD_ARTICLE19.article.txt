# Rebirth sloppy
## 
### JIM TRANQUADA 
The crowd at De Anza's Flint
Center Saturday night, Oct. 11,
was large and enthusiastic, older
than the prepubescent hordes
that "The Great Golden Hits of
the Monkees Show" had played
to in Los Angeles. St. Louis ard
Kansas City (possibly due to the
lateness of the hour).
Still, as the lights dimmed, an
ticipatory screams flew towards
the darkened stage, reaching a
crescendo as former Raider
Mark Allison introduced "the
guys who sang 'em — Micky
Dolenz and Davy Jones — and
the guys who wrote 'em —
Bobby Hart and Tommy Boyce!"
The audience jumped to its feet
as the familiar theme song "Hey,
hey we're the Monkees..."
burst from the amplifiers.
The fact that more attention is
being paid to the rebirth of the
Monkees than to the perfor
mances or the music is indica
tive, however, of the strengths of
the show.
The basic weakness of the
original band — Dolenz and
Jones were actors portraying
roles, while Mike Nesmith and
Peter Tork were committed
musicians — surfaces once
again. The little musical valid
ity that Nesmith and Tork lent to
the band is now. totally lacking,
and the show is, at best, a pleas
ant but somehow unsatisfying
one-shot exercise in nostalgia.
Both Tork and Nesmith were
contacted for the reunion, but
Nesmith is preoccupied with
various production and perfor
mance deals (including the

promotion of his latest effort,
"The Prions"), while Tork is
busy teaching French and music
in Venice, Ca.
Filling in for Nesmith and
Tork were Bobby Hart and
Tommy Boyce, writers and pro
ducers of mfuch of the Monkees
material. Not far into the show,
it appeared as if the act served
solely to give Boyce and Hart the
"live" exposure and applause
they must have wanted 10 years
ago as the Monkees became
famous with their songs.
Too much time was spent un
tangling cords from mike
stands; singing cues were mis
sed; Hart looked awkward and
self-conscious; and Boyce's
acoustic guitar without a pic
kup was pointless.
And there was a great deal of
silliness reminiscent of the
"dumb fun" of the TV show —
jokes about Davey's height —
emphasis on the dumb.
The opening act. Papa Du Run
Da Run, a local group from San
Jose, has a "can't miss" formula:
singalong boogie in the form of
old Beach Boys and Jan & Dean
hits.
Dressed in white pants and
silkies instead of candy-striped
shirts, Papa Du Run Da Run
sounds more like the way the
Beach Boys sounded than the
Beach Boys do.
They make the most of their
material, playing exuberant but
faithful copies (right down to
the guitar solos) of classics
such as "Be True to Your
School." "Fun Fun Fun " and
"Wipeout."

ago as the Monkees became
famous with their songs.
Too much time was spent un
tangling cords from mike
stands; singing cues were mis
sed; Hart looked awkward and
self-conscious; and Boyce's
acoustic guitar without a pic
kup was pointless.
And there was a great deal of
silliness reminiscent of the
"dumb fun" of the TV show —
jokes about Davey's height —
emphasis on the dumb.
The opening act. Papa Du Run
Da Run, a local group from San
Jose, has a "can't miss" formula:
singalong boogie in the form of
old Beach Boys and Jan & Dean
hits.
Dressed in white pants and
silkies instead of candy-striped
shirts, Papa Du Run Da Run
sounds more like the way the
Beach Boys sounded than the
Beach Boys do.
They make the most of their
material, playing exuberant but
faithful copies (right down to
the guitar solos) of classics
such as "Be True to Your
School." "Fun Fun Fun " and
"Wipeout."
The crowd at De Anza's Flint
Center Saturday night, Oct. 11,
was large and enthusiastic, older
than the prepubescent hordes
that "The Great Golden Hits of
the Monkees Show" had played
to in Los Angeles. St. Louis ard
Kansas City (possibly due to the
lateness of the hour).
Still, as the lights dimmed, an
ticipatory screams flew towards
the darkened stage, reaching a
crescendo as former Raider
Mark Allison introduced "the
guys who sang 'em — Micky
Dolenz and Davy Jones — and
the guys who wrote 'em —
Bobby Hart and Tommy Boyce!"
The audience jumped to its feet
as the familiar theme song "Hey,
hey we're the Monkees..."
burst from the amplifiers.
The fact that more attention is
being paid to the rebirth of the
Monkees than to the perfor
mances or the music is indica
tive, however, of the strengths of
the show.
The basic weakness of the
original band — Dolenz and
Jones were actors portraying
roles, while Mike Nesmith and
Peter Tork were committed
musicians — surfaces once
again. The little musical valid
ity that Nesmith and Tork lent to
the band is now. totally lacking,
and the show is, at best, a pleas
ant but somehow unsatisfying
one-shot exercise in nostalgia.
Both Tork and Nesmith were
contacted for the reunion, but
Nesmith is preoccupied with
various production and perfor
mance deals (including the

promotion of his latest effort,
"The Prions"), while Tork is
busy teaching French and music
in Venice, Ca.
Filling in for Nesmith and
Tork were Bobby Hart and
Tommy Boyce, writers and pro
ducers of mfuch of the Monkees
material. Not far into the show,
it appeared as if the act served
solely to give Boyce and Hart the
"live" exposure and applause
they must have wanted 10 years
ago as the Monkees became
famous with their songs.
