Carrying sleeping bags and a sign
that read "Join the Navy, Intimidate
Small Countries," about 20 students
gathered outside the Career Planning
and Placement Center yesterday after
noon to begin an all-night vigil in pro
test of recruiting on campus today by
the Navy.
"Our objective is not to block the
recruiters' entry with our bodies," said
Larry Litvak, an organizer of the vigil,
"but to confront the Stanford com
munity with the issues raised by this
country's huge military expendi
tures."
Those issues, according to Litvak,
include the neglect of social programs
because of a massive military budget,
the role of the U.S. military in suppres
sing national liberation movements
and the "strong ties" between Stanford
and the military.
The vigil was sponsored by an ad
hoc committee. Participants sat in a
circle and discussed Stanford's in
volvement in the military-industrial
complex.
"Santa Clara County has the largest
per capita share of defense spending in
the country," Alan Bernstein, an un
dergraduate, told the group. "And it's
no accident that this is going on
around the Stanford community. Stan
ford creates technological scholars
who feed into military industry," he
added.
Only four students have signed up
for interviews with the recruiters, ac
cording to Fran Holtslander, super
visor of recruitment activities at the
Placement Center.
"The Navy comes every year," she
said. "But the only other time we had
problems with demonstrators was dur
ing the Vietnam war."
