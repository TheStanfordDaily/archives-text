# Sunday spectacular
## 
### DAVE HULTQUIST 
Playing almost continuously
for more than an hour and a half,
Elvin Bishop and his band —
known simply as the Elvin
Bishop Group — climaxed a full
afternoon of great entertainment
in Frost Ampitheatre on Sunday.
The concert featured, in addition
to Bishop, Lydia Pence and Cold
Blood. Cecilio and Kapono, and
lots of sunshine.

In fact, all three groups com
mented on the great weather.
Cecilio and Kapono, who come
from Hawaii, said it made them
feel at home.
The concert opened with
Cecilio and Kapono. The duo,
very popular in Hawaii, and
their new second album Elua
have recently become the sub
jects of quite a promotion cam
paign and are beginning to re
ceive acclaim outside their na
tive state.
This acclaim, it should be
stated, is well deserved.
Both have good singing voices
and most of their original songs
rely on vocal rather than instru
mental talents. Their ability to
compliment the other's voice
and blend in harmony is very
much like that of Seals and
Crofts or Loggins and Messina.
However, they are certainly not
limited to this one style as a pair
of ballads from the 1950s and a
redoing of "La Bamba" clearly
showed.
"La Bamba" was perhaps the
most entertaining number of the
set. It included both a "highly
sophisticated guitar solo from
the'sos which I learned from the
Glen Ca nbell Correspondence
Course' ind a "heavy"'7osver
sion of the same solo.
After a break of about 40
minutes Lydia Pence and Cold
Blood onened the second set

with their hit "Down to the
Bone." This band is a good ex
ample of a, for lack of a better
adjective, Bay Area funky jazz
band somewhat similar to the
Sons of Champlin and Tower of
Power.
Pence's powerful vocals,
along with some outstanding
work from her band — particu
larly the lead guitarist and the
saxophonist — made the second
set even better than the first.
But the people really came to
hear Elvin Bishop, and when he
walked onto stage to lead the
final set, nearly the entire audi
ence — who until then had been
lounging on the grass — stood
up and remained standing,
clapping and dancing to the
music, for a full ninety minutes.
Bishop's group, featuring the
famous guitar of its leader, the
equally exciting guitarof Johnny
"V" Vernazza, and the talents of
a new vocalist, were called back
not only for the standard encore,
but for a second one as well.
Bishop's music, including
such hits as "Juke joint Jump,"
"Stealin' Watermelons," and
"Travelin' Shoes," has no deep
social meaning. It is designed
solely to let people have a good
time. It certainly succeeded
Sunday.

and blend in harmony is very
much like that of Seals and
Crofts or Loggins and Messina.
However, they are certainly not
limited to this one style as a pair
of ballads from the 1950s and a
redoing of "La Bamba" clearly
showed.
"La Bamba" was perhaps the
most entertaining number of the
set. It included both a "highly
sophisticated guitar solo from
the'sos which I learned from the
Glen Ca nbell Correspondence
Course' ind a "heavy"'7osver
sion of the same solo.
After a break of about 40
minutes Lydia Pence and Cold
Blood onened the second set

with their hit "Down to the
Bone." This band is a good ex
ample of a, for lack of a better
adjective, Bay Area funky jazz
band somewhat similar to the
Sons of Champlin and Tower of
Power.
Pence's powerful vocals,
along with some outstanding
work from her band — particu
larly the lead guitarist and the
saxophonist — made the second
set even better than the first.
But the people really came to
hear Elvin Bishop, and when he
walked onto stage to lead the
final set, nearly the entire audi
ence — who until then had been
lounging on the grass — stood
up and remained standing,
clapping and dancing to the
music, for a full ninety minutes.
Bishop's group, featuring the
famous guitar of its leader, the
equally exciting guitarof Johnny
"V" Vernazza, and the talents of
a new vocalist, were called back
not only for the standard encore,
but for a second one as well.
Bishop's music, including
such hits as "Juke joint Jump,"
"Stealin' Watermelons," and
"Travelin' Shoes," has no deep
social meaning. It is designed
solely to let people have a good
time. It certainly succeeded
Sunday.

LYDIA AND HER BLOOD — Lydia Pense and Cold Blood shared
the hot afternoon sunlight last weekend with Elvin Bishop and
Cecilio and Kapono.
Playing almost continuously
for more than an hour and a half,
Elvin Bishop and his band —
known simply as the Elvin
Bishop Group — climaxed a full
afternoon of great entertainment
in Frost Ampitheatre on Sunday.
The concert featured, in addition
to Bishop, Lydia Pence and Cold
Blood. Cecilio and Kapono, and
lots of sunshine.

In fact, all three groups com
mented on the great weather.
Cecilio and Kapono, who come
from Hawaii, said it made them
feel at home.
The concert opened with
Cecilio and Kapono. The duo,
very popular in Hawaii, and
their new second album Elua
have recently become the sub
jects of quite a promotion cam
paign and are beginning to re
ceive acclaim outside their na
tive state.
This acclaim, it should be
stated, is well deserved.
Both have good singing voices
and most of their original songs
rely on vocal rather than instru
mental talents. Their ability to
compliment the other's voice
and blend in harmony is very
much like that of Seals and
Crofts or Loggins and Messina.
