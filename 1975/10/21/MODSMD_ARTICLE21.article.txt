# Cream not sour
## 
### DAVE HULTQUIST 
Combining both old and new
musical ideas, Sour Cream, a re
corder trio from the Netherlands,
played before a sell-out audience
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
Tuesday evening. The concert
was an exciting and unique ex
perience.
Sour Cream consists of Frans
Brueggen, perhaps the world's
most famous recorder virtuoso,
and tw6 of his former students,
Kees Boeke and Walter Van
Hauwe.
The group's rather unusual
style was apparent from the very
outset of the performance. Not
many concerts open with three
chamber music artists, sporting
long hair and faded jeans, enter
ing and crawlng around the
stage on their knees, occasion
ally bumping into one another.
But this is exactly how "Sour
Steam," Sour Cream's opening
work, is performed.
This piece, in which each per
former played short rhythmic
motives on one pitch, was fol
lowed by a beautiful suite of
songs from the Renaissance
period. This was to be only the
first of several juxtapositions of
the traditional and the avant
garde.
Certainly the high points of
the evening were the "20 Varia
tions upon 'La Follia' " by B.
Castafiore and "4 in 3 in 2 in 1"
(subtitled "Two in one upon a
ground") by Boeke.
The Baroque variations was
one of the few works in which
one performer dominated. Most
of the pieces were counterpun
tal, that is, each instrument
played a separate and equally
important melody. Here, how
ever, Bruggen and Boeke merely

accompanied Van Hauwe, who
demonstrated his talent as a
soloist spectacularly. Each of the
20-30 second variations is faster
and more difficult than the last
but Van Hauwe played them all
so perfectly that, toward the end
of the work, an awe-filled
murmur could be heard each
time he began a new one.
"4 in 3 in 2 in 1," played by
Boeke and Van Hauwe, had the
artists humming and buzzing as
well as blowing into their recor
ders.
The piece is a jumble of musi
cal ideas. At times beautifully
lyric and peaceful, at times dis
sonant and furious, it is also
often very confusing. Yet it is
nevertheless artistic and very
moving and was performed with
both feeling and technical skill.
The program's remaining
works, though not as exqiting,
were never less than beautiful.
These were all short suites of
songs and dances from the Re
naissance and Baroque periods.
Whereas Castafiore's and
Boeke's works commanded the
full attention of the listener,
these gentler works allowed one
to relax and realize what a beaut
iful instrument the recorder can
be.
