the 12.4 percent jump computed at an annual rate in the
first three months of 1955.

common recovery characeristic triggered by fluctuations
in businss inventories, cannot be expected to endure.

behind where it was before the recession began. The value
of Gross National Product was at an annual rate of $1,497.8
billion for the quarter.
