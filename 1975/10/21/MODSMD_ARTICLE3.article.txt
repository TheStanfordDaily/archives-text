# ARLO gets $5000 booster shot
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
The Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) has received $5000 from two
sources enabling it to continue its ac
tivities until mid-December, co
directors Edith Eddy and Bill Leland
said.
The San Mateo Foundation pro
vided $3000, in recognition of the
numerous action research projects ar
ranged by ARLO in San Mateo County.
The other $2000, designated "unre
stricted research funds," was assigned
to ARLO out of the Engineering
Department's "discretionary funds"
by Engineering Prof. Bruce B. Lusig
nan, a member of the ARLO Policy
Board. He was active last year in coor

dinating engineering class assign
ments with projects in the surround
ing communities.
ARLO was started in the fall of 1973
to enable students to do original re
search in cooperation with non-profit
organizations outside the University.
Funded outside
Since Sept. 1974, ARLO has been
"entirely dependent on outside fund
ing" to cover its $24,000 annual
budget, Leland said.
"The people who set ARLO up felt
that it was important to have a three
year experimental period, when it
would not be under the control of the
administration. That way, while the
University as a whole was cutting back
on its budget, we wouldn't be killed
before we got started," Eddy said.
Student participation in ARLO
sponsored research projects is twice
what it was a year ago.
"Last year, close to 200 students
were involved in some way; we've
been delighted with the dramatic in
crease of student involvement this

Fall. It seems that many more students
and faculty are realizing that this can
be a part of a Stanford education," Le
land said.
Current projects
Among the most popular projects
are the planning of health service
cooperative for the Mid-peninsula;
work with the Palo Alto City Council's
task force on nuclear power; and a re

search project with the Women's Re
source Center to develop a profile of its
clientele.
"We try to take a full range of ac
tivities from a broad range of commun
ity groups in our attempts to make stu
dent education and research more re
levant and interesting," Leland said.
ARLO aims to provide "a real service
to the community," he added.

BECAUSE IT'S THERE — A workman experiences the ultimate campus high
while replacing tiles on the roof of Hoover Power. The roof can be reached by a
metal stairway that begins on the 14th floor, where the carillon is located. The
stairway isn't open to the public, of course, but this climber probably won't be
Hoover's last.

BECAUSE IT'S THERE — A workman experiences the ultimate campus high
while replacing tiles on the roof of Hoover Power. The roof can be reached by a
metal stairway that begins on the 14th floor, where the carillon is located. The
stairway isn't open to the public, of course, but this climber probably won't be
Hoover's last.
The Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) has received $5000 from two
sources enabling it to continue its ac
tivities until mid-December, co
directors Edith Eddy and Bill Leland
said.
The San Mateo Foundation pro
vided $3000, in recognition of the
numerous action research projects ar
ranged by ARLO in San Mateo County.
The other $2000, designated "unre
stricted research funds," was assigned
to ARLO out of the Engineering
Department's "discretionary funds"
by Engineering Prof. Bruce B. Lusig
nan, a member of the ARLO Policy
Board. He was active last year in coor

dinating engineering class assign
ments with projects in the surround
ing communities.
ARLO was started in the fall of 1973
to enable students to do original re
search in cooperation with non-profit
organizations outside the University.
Funded outside
Since Sept. 1974, ARLO has been
"entirely dependent on outside fund
ing" to cover its $24,000 annual
budget, Leland said.
"The people who set ARLO up felt
that it was important to have a three
year experimental period, when it
would not be under the control of the
administration. That way, while the
University as a whole was cutting back
on its budget, we wouldn't be killed
before we got started," Eddy said.
Student participation in ARLO
sponsored research projects is twice
what it was a year ago.
"Last year, close to 200 students
were involved in some way; we've
been delighted with the dramatic in
crease of student involvement this

Fall. It seems that many more students
and faculty are realizing that this can
be a part of a Stanford education," Le
land said.
Current projects
Among the most popular projects
are the planning of health service
cooperative for the Mid-peninsula;
work with the Palo Alto City Council's
task force on nuclear power; and a re

search project with the Women's Re
source Center to develop a profile of its
clientele.
"We try to take a full range of ac
tivities from a broad range of commun
ity groups in our attempts to make stu
dent education and research more re
levant and interesting," Leland said.

to the community," he added.
