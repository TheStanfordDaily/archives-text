# Ford considers food stamp cuts

WASHINGTON (AP ) — President
Ford asked Congress yesterday to ap
prove a new food stamp program that
would deny food stamps to families
whose income exceeds the
government's poverty level.
Administration officials said it
could save the government $1.2 billion
a year and disqualify about 17 percent
of those now receiving stamps, an es
timated 3.4 million people.
Ford said the keys to the new struc
ture for the program are an income
ceiling on eligibility for stamps, a re
quirement that all recipients pay 30
percent of their net income for the
stamps and the calculation of an
applicant's income based on past earn
ings rather than future estimates.
Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz told
a Senate subcommittee that in addi
tion to the 17 percent that would be
eliminated from the program, 26 per

cent would have their benefits re
duced.
Fifty-seven percent of those on the
rolls now would have benefits at least
equal to those they now receive under
a much more complicated structure,
Butz said.
For a four-person family, the poverty
line now is $5050 a year. With the Ford
bill's standard deduction of $100 a
month the gross-income ceiling before
taxes would be $6250 or, if a family
•member is more than 60 years old,
$6550.
The secretary said that although
some people would be disqualified,
the improved benefits at the low end of
the income group could attract another
775,200 recipients into the program.
Under the present program, a four
person household can receive $162 a
month in food stamps, for which it
pays between 16 and 24 percent of its
net income.
Under the Ford plan the household
would receive $166 in stamps and pay
30 percent of its net income. Butz said
that most poor people have few deduc
tions so the standard $100 deduction
would benefit them by lowering their
net income, thereby increasing eligi
bility.
In August, the last month for which
figures are available, about 18.8 mill
ion people participated at an annual
cost to the federal government of $5.2
billion in benefits alone.
There is no gross-income ceiling
now.
