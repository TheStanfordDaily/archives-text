# Admissions drop nearly 200
## Farm reaps fewer transfers 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Stanford admitted approximately 230 transfer students
for autumn quarter this year, down nearly 200 from the
number the University has admitted in past years, Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon said in a recent interview.
Hargadon said that the number was reduced this year
because fewer people are taking quarters off, more old
students are returning to campus and the past two fresh
man classes have been larger than expected.
Another consideration was the inability to house in
coming transfers, said Hargadon.
Because people take time off, and go overseas, it is
possible to admit a fairly large number of transfer stu
dents, Hargadon explained. The University aims to have
about 6475 undergraduates on campus at all times, he
continued.
Hargadon predicted that Ivy League colleges also will

have to admit large numbers of transfers within the next
few years.
Must raise enrollment
"They have been able to afford not filling in places of
students who have left or are not on campus. Now, they've
got to raise their average enrollments," he said.
A transfer applicant's previous rejection or acceptance
by Stanford is not a factor in the decision to admit him or
her, Hargadon said. Each transfer applicant is considered
solely on existing merits, he said.
"We tend not to think of the admissions of students as a
won/loss game." said Hargadon. "We are glad they apply
and glad to be able to admit them."
The California phenomenon
In fact, a fairly large number of students originally turn
down Stanford to go east, and then transfer, Hargadon
said, referring to this as the "California phenomenon."
Hargadon also spoke of the problems involved in com
paring the quality of students at various colleges — espe
cially with regard to test scores.
Many Ivy League schools publish in April mean test
scores of the class just accepted, Hargadon said. The mean
scores published don't include test scores of those stu
dents admitted from the waiting list, he said.
Consequently, because students on the waiting list have
lower average scores, the actual mean scores are lower
than those published, he concluded.
Same applicant pool
Another factor that distorts test score reports is that
most of the Ivy League students come from the same ap
plicant pool, Hargadon stated. Therefore, although a stu
dent can attend only one of the schools at which he was
accepted, his test scores appear in the averages for all the
schools which accept him, Hargadon explained.
Stanford's student body has very high mean test scores,
Hargadon said.
"My guess is that Stanford is in the top five in the
country," Hargadon said. "Harvard is probably the
strongest, but with the rest it is hard to say."

Although many students feel that they must have a long
list of extracurricular activities in order to be accepted,
Hargadon said these activities actually play only a small
p J in the acceptance of the average student.
Brownie points
"We don't generally look at extracurricular activities,"
he stated. "We tend to think of it as energy level as much as
anything else — whether a student has had time to par
ticipate in other activities besides academic work."
Hargadon also cited these transfer admissions facts and
policies:
— students are admitted on a transfer basis every quar
ter, although some quarters are more popular among
transfers than others. The largest number of transfers are
accepted in the fall, followed by winter and then spring,
he said;
— athletes who have been recruited must go through
the same admissions process as regular students;
— applicants who submit art folios and music tapes are
evaluated by the Art and Music Departments. These
evaluations are considered in the admissions decision.
— the quality of transfers admitted is at least as high as
that of the entering freshman class. If there still are spaces
for transfers, but no applicants are considered to be well
qualified, the transfer class remains unfilled.

country," Hargadon said. "Harvard is probably the
strongest, but with the rest it is hard to say."

Although many students feel that they must have a long
list of extracurricular activities in order to be accepted,
Hargadon said these activities actually play only a small
p J in the acceptance of the average student.
Brownie points
"We don't generally look at extracurricular activities,"
he stated. "We tend to think of it as energy level as much as
anything else — whether a student has had time to par
ticipate in other activities besides academic work."
Hargadon also cited these transfer admissions facts and
policies:
— students are admitted on a transfer basis every quar
ter, although some quarters are more popular among
transfers than others. The largest number of transfers are
accepted in the fall, followed by winter and then spring,
he said;
— athletes who have been recruited must go through
the same admissions process as regular students;
— applicants who submit art folios and music tapes are
evaluated by the Art and Music Departments. These
evaluations are considered in the admissions decision.
— the quality of transfers admitted is at least as high as
that of the entering freshman class. If there still are spaces
for transfers, but no applicants are considered to be well
qualified, the transfer class remains unfilled.
Stanford admitted approximately 230 transfer students
for autumn quarter this year, down nearly 200 from the
number the University has admitted in past years, Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon said in a recent interview.
Hargadon said that the number was reduced this year
because fewer people are taking quarters off, more old
students are returning to campus and the past two fresh
man classes have been larger than expected.
Another consideration was the inability to house in
coming transfers, said Hargadon.
Because people take time off, and go overseas, it is
possible to admit a fairly large number of transfer stu
dents, Hargadon explained. The University aims to have
about 6475 undergraduates on campus at all times, he
continued.
Hargadon predicted that Ivy League colleges also will

have to admit large numbers of transfers within the next
few years.
Must raise enrollment
"They have been able to afford not filling in places of
students who have left or are not on campus. Now, they've
got to raise their average enrollments," he said.
A transfer applicant's previous rejection or acceptance
by Stanford is not a factor in the decision to admit him or
her, Hargadon said. Each transfer applicant is considered
solely on existing merits, he said.
"We tend not to think of the admissions of students as a
won/loss game." said Hargadon. "We are glad they apply
and glad to be able to admit them."
The California phenomenon
In fact, a fairly large number of students originally turn
down Stanford to go east, and then transfer, Hargadon
said, referring to this as the "California phenomenon."
Hargadon also spoke of the problems involved in com
paring the quality of students at various colleges — espe
cially with regard to test scores.
Many Ivy League schools publish in April mean test
scores of the class just accepted, Hargadon said. The mean
scores published don't include test scores of those stu
dents admitted from the waiting list, he said.
Consequently, because students on the waiting list have
lower average scores, the actual mean scores are lower
than those published, he concluded.
Same applicant pool
Another factor that distorts test score reports is that
most of the Ivy League students come from the same ap
plicant pool, Hargadon stated. Therefore, although a stu
dent can attend only one of the schools at which he was
accepted, his test scores appear in the averages for all the
schools which accept him, Hargadon explained.
Stanford's student body has very high mean test scores,
Hargadon said.
"My guess is that Stanford is in the top five in the
country," Hargadon said. "Harvard is probably the
strongest, but with the rest it is hard to say."
