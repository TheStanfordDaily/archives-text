# Admissions drop nearly 200
## Farm reaps fewer transfers 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Stanford admitted approximately 230 transfer students
for autumn quarter this year, down nearly 200 from the
number the University has admitted in past years, Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon said in a recent interview.
Hargadon said that the number was reduced this year
because fewer people are taking quarters off, more old
students are returning to campus and the past two fresh
man classes have been larger than expected.
Another consideration was the inability to house in
coming transfers, said Hargadon.
Because people take time off, and go overseas, it is
possible to admit a fairly large number of transfer stu
dents, Hargadon explained. The University aims to have
about 6475 undergraduates on campus at all times, he
continued.
Hargadon predicted that Ivy League colleges also will

have to admit large numbers of transfers within the next
few years.
Must raise enrollment
"They have been able to afford not filling in places of
students who have left or are not on campus. Now, they've
got to raise their average enrollments," he said.
A transfer applicant's previous rejection or acceptance
by Stanford is not a factor in the decision to admit him or
her, Hargadon said. Each transfer applicant is considered
solely on existing merits, he said.
"We tend not to think of the admissions of students as a
won/loss game." said Hargadon. "We are glad they apply
and glad to be able to admit them."
The California phenomenon
In fact, a fairly large number of students originally turn
down Stanford to go east, and then transfer, Hargadon
