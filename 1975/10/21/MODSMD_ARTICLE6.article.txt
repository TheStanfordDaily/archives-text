# Cards deny 'mutiny' report
## 
### RON BECK VLAE KERSHNER 
Wire service reports alleging a near "mutiny" among
Stanford football players over the decision of Head Coach
Jack Christiansen to start Mike Cordova at quarterback
have been denied by Cardinal players and coaches.
The Oakland Tribune yesterday reported that a number
of Stanford players were so disgruntled about
Christiansen's choice that they enlisted the help of a local
attorney in order to force Christiansen to change his mind
The Tribune story apparently was the source for a United
Press International dispatch alleging "mutiny."
Christiansen termed the report "unrealistic." He said
that the lawyer is merely an interested alumnus who wrote
him before the season began saying that players were
dissatisfied with the choice of Cordova over Guy Benja
min.
Team co-captains Geb Church and Bill Singler im
mediately denied the allegations yesterday. "This team is
backing Coach Christiansen and Mike Cordova 100 per
cent." Singler said.
"It's completely unfounded." Church agreed.
Other players echoed these sentiments. "Life is full of
absurdities, and this story is one of them." receiver Ray
Anderson said.
However, one varsity player who asked to remain
anonymous said that players who disagree with Christ

iansen are "intimidated about losing their jobs. We talk
among ourselves, and we've got great stories about the
situation, but we're under a lot of pressure not to say
anything."
The player said that no coach had asked the players not
to talk to the press, but affirmed that pressure from
coaches does exist.
"We're more 'together' as a team than we were last year,
because we feel that the (quarterback) choice isn't going to
change." the player said. "We aren't going to influence
anybody, so we'd just like to get together and win some
games."
Christiansen was quoted in yesterday's Palo Alto Times
as saying, "Ifanyone is unhappy with the way I'm running
the team, they are free to quit."
Athletic Director Joseph Ruetz said, "I disagree with
Jack on that (attitude), but I understand that jack was
frustrated when he made the statement."
Christiansen later said he had never tried to muzzle any
players, nor would he do so.
Ruetz also said he had heard nothing about a wire ser
vice report that a group of alumni were trying to buy out
the remaining years of Christiansen's contract. "If there
are any such alumni, they might as well keep their
money," Ruetz said. "Decisions on hiring and judging
coaches have to be made on a lot more solid ground than
alumni pressure."

Christiansen's choice that they enlisted the help of a local
attorney in order to force Christiansen to change his mind
The Tribune story apparently was the source for a United
Press International dispatch alleging "mutiny."
Christiansen termed the report "unrealistic." He said
that the lawyer is merely an interested alumnus who wrote
him before the season began saying that players were
dissatisfied with the choice of Cordova over Guy Benja
min.
Team co-captains Geb Church and Bill Singler im
mediately denied the allegations yesterday. "This team is
backing Coach Christiansen and Mike Cordova 100 per
cent." Singler said.
"It's completely unfounded." Church agreed.
Other players echoed these sentiments. "Life is full of
absurdities, and this story is one of them." receiver Ray
Anderson said.
However, one varsity player who asked to remain
anonymous said that players who disagree with Christ

iansen are "intimidated about losing their jobs. We talk
among ourselves, and we've got great stories about the
situation, but we're under a lot of pressure not to say
anything."
The player said that no coach had asked the players not
to talk to the press, but affirmed that pressure from
coaches does exist.
"We're more 'together' as a team than we were last year,
because we feel that the (quarterback) choice isn't going to
change." the player said. "We aren't going to influence
anybody, so we'd just like to get together and win some
games."
Christiansen was quoted in yesterday's Palo Alto Times
as saying, "Ifanyone is unhappy with the way I'm running
the team, they are free to quit."
Athletic Director Joseph Ruetz said, "I disagree with
Jack on that (attitude), but I understand that jack was
frustrated when he made the statement."
Christiansen later said he had never tried to muzzle any
players, nor would he do so.
Ruetz also said he had heard nothing about a wire ser
vice report that a group of alumni were trying to buy out
the remaining years of Christiansen's contract. "If there
are any such alumni, they might as well keep their
money," Ruetz said. "Decisions on hiring and judging
coaches have to be made on a lot more solid ground than
alumni pressure."

Wire service reports alleging a near "mutiny" among
Stanford football players over the decision of Head Coach
Jack Christiansen to start Mike Cordova at quarterback
have been denied by Cardinal players and coaches.
The Oakland Tribune yesterday reported that a number
of Stanford players were so disgruntled about
Christiansen's choice that they enlisted the help of a local
attorney in order to force Christiansen to change his mind
