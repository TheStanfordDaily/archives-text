A reader of recent parking ar
ticles might conclude that all
students want to drive their
energy-consuming and
environment-despoiling cars
around and don't want to pay the
cost of parking. However, the
students' case against parking
fees is strong and needs to be
stated.
Student cars are only a minor
part of the campus traffic prob
lem. They are located away from
the central campus and are not
usually used in the main rush
hours. Student resident parking
is least scarce of all parking on
campus.
The cost of parking in these
resident lots is already included
in the rents students pay. Yet,
faculty residents are exempt
from paying these resident park
ing fees, despite the fact that
students pay to maintain their
parking lots just as faculty resi
dents maintain their driveways.
Concerning the actual parking
fees, the administration has yet
to issue a definite explanation of
why parking fees are collected.
First, students need to know
the rationale used to choose the
size of the fees — something the
University has neglected to pro
vide.
Much has been said of the use
of parking fees to discourage the
automobile use, but few have
recognized the invalidity of that
argument to resident parking. A
parking fee at one's employment
encourages the search for alter
native means of
transportation,but a fee on park
ing at one's house does nothing
of the kind — it is only a hard
ship on the owner.
Second, the parking fees
should be put to good use. Al
though many good uses are
planned for the parking fund,
such as constructing bike paths
and running shuttle buses, right
now it seems that the parking
fund is mainly going to the
salaries of the police depart
ment.
Instead of collecting money
for vague and unspecified pur
poses, the University would do
better to design a program, cal
culate its cost and then charge
parking fees at a rate necessary to

pay for the program. People
would then know in advance
what their parking money is
going for, as opposed to the pre
sent system which bears much
resemblance to a slush fund.
In developing its parking
plan, the University has made
numerous references to parking
regulations at other universities,
trying to persuade us we are
lucky to be at Stanford. But the
problems of Stanford are not
those of other universities and
the excuse that other univer
sities charge high fees is no ex
cuse at all.
Stanford's parking regulations
and fees must be justified
internally, not on the basis of
what others do.
People need to provide input,
such as the meetings held last
year. However, input is no good
unless something happens. 1
would trade all those hearings
last year for the opportunity to
change one major part of the
program to the benefit of the stu
dents.
Much of this year's parking
debate has centered around the
use of free (G permit) lots.
A car no matter where it is
parked uses energy and pollutes
the air, and everyone should pay
for the service they receive.
A major objection of students
has been that staff and faculty
were able to park free while stu
dents had to pay for far less valu
able parking. Last spring we
were promised that faculty
would have to pay for their
spaces.
Yet, over three-quarters of the
faculty and staff are currently
getting free permits, leaving the
students still holding the bag. If
three-quarters of the people are
using the free lots, then it would
be better to have all free lots or no
free lots.
Parking is a complicated issue
and too often the administration
has used the ignorance of stu
dents to defeat honest efforts to
get grievances remedied. Stu
dents will pay for a program that
is just and fair, but they have yet
to see one.

stated.
Student cars are only a minor
part of the campus traffic prob
lem. They are located away from
the central campus and are not
usually used in the main rush
hours. Student resident parking
is least scarce of all parking on
campus.
The cost of parking in these
resident lots is already included
in the rents students pay. Yet,
faculty residents are exempt
from paying these resident park
ing fees, despite the fact that
students pay to maintain their
parking lots just as faculty resi
dents maintain their driveways.
Concerning the actual parking
fees, the administration has yet
to issue a definite explanation of
why parking fees are collected.
First, students need to know
the rationale used to choose the
size of the fees — something the
University has neglected to pro
vide.
Much has been said of the use
of parking fees to discourage the
automobile use, but few have
recognized the invalidity of that
argument to resident parking. A
parking fee at one's employment
encourages the search for alter
native means of
transportation,but a fee on park
ing at one's house does nothing
of the kind — it is only a hard
ship on the owner.
Second, the parking fees
should be put to good use. Al
though many good uses are
planned for the parking fund,
such as constructing bike paths
and running shuttle buses, right
now it seems that the parking
fund is mainly going to the
salaries of the police depart
ment.
Instead of collecting money
for vague and unspecified pur
poses, the University would do
better to design a program, cal
culate its cost and then charge
parking fees at a rate necessary to

pay for the program. People
would then know in advance
what their parking money is
going for, as opposed to the pre
sent system which bears much
resemblance to a slush fund.
In developing its parking
plan, the University has made
numerous references to parking
regulations at other universities,
trying to persuade us we are
lucky to be at Stanford. But the
problems of Stanford are not
those of other universities and
the excuse that other univer
sities charge high fees is no ex
cuse at all.
Stanford's parking regulations
and fees must be justified
internally, not on the basis of
what others do.
People need to provide input,
such as the meetings held last
year. However, input is no good
unless something happens. 1
would trade all those hearings
last year for the opportunity to
change one major part of the
program to the benefit of the stu
dents.
Much of this year's parking
debate has centered around the
use of free (G permit) lots.
A car no matter where it is
parked uses energy and pollutes
the air, and everyone should pay
for the service they receive.
A major objection of students
has been that staff and faculty
were able to park free while stu
dents had to pay for far less valu
able parking. Last spring we
were promised that faculty
would have to pay for their
spaces.
Yet, over three-quarters of the
faculty and staff are currently
getting free permits, leaving the
students still holding the bag. If
three-quarters of the people are
using the free lots, then it would
be better to have all free lots or no
free lots.
Parking is a complicated issue
and too often the administration
has used the ignorance of stu
dents to defeat honest efforts to
get grievances remedied. Stu
dents will pay for a program that
is just and fair, but they have yet
to see one.
