# Death penalty: just?

An eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth is an ancient and often
repeated concept of justice, but
the question of its constitution
ality is still hanging in the air.
In 1972, the Supreme Court
ruled by a 5-4 decision that the
death penalty was a form of cruel
and unusual punishment, even
in cases involving premeditated
murder. However, the Court is
about to take another look at that
stand. Opponents of the death
penalty argue that it isn't effec
tive as a '-rime deterrent, that no
one has the right to sentence
another person to death and that
the purpose of the American
penal system is to rehabilitate
criminals, not to execute them.
Perhaps the death penalty
isn't an effective deterrent to
crime, as the thought of death
simply doesn't bother some
criminals.
In one sense, however, the
death penalty could be a deter
rent to future crime. Countless
studies have shown that prisons
seldom have effective rehabilita
tion programs and in fact, often
alienate criminals from society
even more.
When a mass murderer such as
Charles Manson, who has spent
more than half of his life in

prison, is sent to jail with a
chance of a parole, society might
once again be subjected to his
heinous crimes.
It's true that the constitution
forbids cruel and unusual
punishment, but this term isn't
clearly defined. A fast, painless
death in the gas chamber doesn't
seem nearly so cruel as a brutal
and fatal stabbing or shooting.
The constitution also states
that none can be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due
process of law.
When someone is given the
death penalty after he has had a
trial by jury and the option to
appeal if he thinks his convic
tion is unfair, then he is obvi
ously not being deprived of his
life without due process of law.
In some cases, where crimi
nals are so hardened or crimes
are so hideous that rehabilita
tion seems impossible, perhaps
the "eye for an eye, tooth for a
tooth" doctrine is the best one.
There are instances where only
by taking a life for a life can soci
ety protect itself from violent
crimes.
