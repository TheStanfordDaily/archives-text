### KATHLEEN WHEATON 
The Soviet Union denied a former
Stanford assistant professor the op
portunity to go to Moscow last summer
to participate in a conference of elec
trical engineers, the Daily has learned.
Adrian Segall was denied a visa he
cause he is a citizen of Israel, accord
ing to Stanford Electrical Engineering
Prof. Thomas Kailath.
The conference, originally planned
for August, 1975, was called off by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers (lEEE) because Segall's visa
request was denied.
Kailath, Electrical Engineering Prof.
Thomas Cover, Asst. Electrical En
gineering Prof. Robert Cray and Segall
were to participate in the conference,
which was to be a joint research work
shop between the Russian Academy of
Science and the lEEE.
Organizers hoped such a conference
would bring about closer cooperation
between Soviet and American scien
tists as well as an exchange of informa
tion.
'Insure participation'
"Since the lEEE is an international
organization, one of its main purposes
is to insure participation by members
from all countries," said Kailath, pres
ident of the conference.
"The U.S.S.R. does not have dip
lomatic relations with Israel, but we
were told when the conference was
first proposed that there would be no
problem getting Segall in," he said.
Kailath, himself a citizen of India,
emphasized that the difficulty lay in
Soviet diplomatic policy, rather than
in prejudice or anti-Semitism. He said
the IEEE has no desire to antagonize
diplomatic relations between the
U.S.S.R. and the U.S.
The conference, which was to be a
workshop of information theory, has
been tentatively postponed until De
cember.
"Perhaps a group of American citi
zens will go (to the workshop) under a
different organization," said Kailath,
"but the IEEE will stay by its policy of
including all countries in its confer
ences."
