First of two parts
The other day, bill Ross of the
Daily called to ask me to defend
conservative virtue: "We have
recently published several at
tacks on conservatism," he said,
"and we would like you to reply.
In 110 more than 800 words."
Fight hundred miserly words
to clear up myths and miscon
ceptions about conservatives.
Madonna'. I might as well try
cleaning the stables of Augias
with a toothpick . . .
Moreover Ross would have me
defend conservatism against
libertarian critics, and 1 don't
like to quarrel with libertarians.
For one, 1 call myself a liber
tarian conservative. I deplore the
rilt between libertarians and
conservatives.
I take no pleasure in exposing
the libertarians' epistemological
perplexities. There is so much at
stake, and we have so much in
common.
Hut libertarians, for reasons
which escape me, have resolved
that conservatives are the
enemy, not the collectivists and
the totalitarians with whom they
surreptitiously indulge in the
most puz/.ling and promiscuous
affairs.
Why quarrel?
For another, most libertarians
I happen to respect — like the
admirable Fdith Efron, whom
Tim Ferguson so skillfully
paraphrased in his Oct. 2 Daily
article. How can I quarrel with
one I owe so much ?
bin I wish she'd keep doing
what she does best, e.g., expos
ing the impudent liberal bias ol
tlie media, instead of perorating
on things she doesn't under
stand. e.g.. conservatism.
I'ray, tell me. what can one do
with someone who criticizes the
conservative reliance on au
thority. order, tradition, duty
and patriotism because such
"platonic abstractions . . . are
not derived in any rational
way?"
Isn't there someone to tell
Efron that platonic ideas, which
are the foundations of < lassica
tional rationalism, cannot
themselves be rationally de
rived?
Limpid assertions
And what about an author
who considers that such limpid
propositions as "man is often ir
rational" or "reason, education,
and science cannot solve many
or most human problems" arc
symptoms of a "fascist strain"

corroding the conservative
temper? Mon Dieu, if this be fas
cism, the planet must be crawl
ing with them fascists, all the
way from existentialists to
ecologists.
What am 1 to do with Efron's
loaded complaint that conserva
tives "cannot grasp the primacy
of the individual mind, ... its
right to flout tradition, if that
tradition is fatuous or irrational,
its right to repudiate authority, if
that authority is imbecile or im
moral, its right to destroy order,
if that order is unjust or malig
nant?"
So what's new? Is
Efron really unaware that her
very own formulation implies
the existence of a tradition that is
neither fatuous nor irrational, of
an authority that is neither im
becile nor immoral, of an order
that is neither unjust nor malig
nant?
Can't Ferguson understand
that the conservative's task, and
his anguished dilemma, is pre
cisely to sort them out so as to
know which to "destroy," which
to preserve? Hasn't anyone told
tlie two that it simply isn't
proper to stuff into the premises
tli.it which one wishes to de
monstrate in the conclusions?
What does one prove by claim
ing an individual's right to de
stroy Efron's cherished freedom,
if that freedom is assumed to be
immoral, its practice irrational,
its exercise imbecile?
Efron's inconsistencies
How does one handle people
who, in one paragraph, criticize
conservatives for the "religious
origins" of their commitment to
112 reedom, only to castigate them
in the next because "their incli
nations to economic self
betterment know no bounds on
tin; infringement of the liberty of
others?"
Hasn't anyone let Efron into
the secret of those injunctions
and exhortations which lews
and Christians call the Ten
Commandments?
Isn't there somewhere a
charitable soul willing to exp
lain to Ferguson that one can
criticize conservatism for its re
ligious commitments; or indict it
for failing to impose restrictions
on the pursuit of economic self
betterment; but not for both?

First of two parts
The other day, bill Ross of the
Daily called to ask me to defend
conservative virtue: "We have
recently published several at
tacks on conservatism," he said,
"and we would like you to reply.
In 110 more than 800 words."
Fight hundred miserly words
to clear up myths and miscon
ceptions about conservatives.
Madonna'. I might as well try
cleaning the stables of Augias
with a toothpick . . .
Moreover Ross would have me
defend conservatism against
libertarian critics, and 1 don't
like to quarrel with libertarians.
For one, 1 call myself a liber
tarian conservative. I deplore the
rilt between libertarians and
conservatives.
I take no pleasure in exposing
the libertarians' epistemological
perplexities. There is so much at
stake, and we have so much in
common.
Hut libertarians, for reasons
which escape me, have resolved
that conservatives are the
enemy, not the collectivists and
the totalitarians with whom they
surreptitiously indulge in the
most puz/.ling and promiscuous
affairs.
Why quarrel?
For another, most libertarians
I happen to respect — like the
admirable Fdith Efron, whom
Tim Ferguson so skillfully
paraphrased in his Oct. 2 Daily
article. How can I quarrel with
one I owe so much ?
bin I wish she'd keep doing
what she does best, e.g., expos
ing the impudent liberal bias ol
tlie media, instead of perorating
on things she doesn't under
stand. e.g.. conservatism.
I'ray, tell me. what can one do
with someone who criticizes the
conservative reliance on au
thority. order, tradition, duty
and patriotism because such
"platonic abstractions . . . are
not derived in any rational
way?"
Isn't there someone to tell
Efron that platonic ideas, which
are the foundations of < lassica
tional rationalism, cannot
themselves be rationally de
rived?
Limpid assertions
And what about an author
who considers that such limpid
propositions as "man is often ir
rational" or "reason, education,
and science cannot solve many
or most human problems" arc
symptoms of a "fascist strain"

corroding the conservative
temper? Mon Dieu, if this be fas
cism, the planet must be crawl
ing with them fascists, all the
way from existentialists to
ecologists.
What am 1 to do with Efron's
loaded complaint that conserva
tives "cannot grasp the primacy
of the individual mind, ... its
right to flout tradition, if that
tradition is fatuous or irrational,
its right to repudiate authority, if
that authority is imbecile or im
moral, its right to destroy order,
if that order is unjust or malig
nant?"
So what's new? Is
Efron really unaware that her
very own formulation implies
the existence of a tradition that is
neither fatuous nor irrational, of
an authority that is neither im
becile nor immoral, of an order
that is neither unjust nor malig
nant?
Can't Ferguson understand
that the conservative's task, and
his anguished dilemma, is pre
cisely to sort them out so as to
know which to "destroy," which
to preserve? Hasn't anyone told
tlie two that it simply isn't
proper to stuff into the premises
tli.it which one wishes to de
monstrate in the conclusions?
What does one prove by claim
ing an individual's right to de
stroy Efron's cherished freedom,
if that freedom is assumed to be
immoral, its practice irrational,
its exercise imbecile?
Efron's inconsistencies
How does one handle people
who, in one paragraph, criticize
conservatives for the "religious
origins" of their commitment to
112 reedom, only to castigate them
in the next because "their incli
nations to economic self
betterment know no bounds on
tin; infringement of the liberty of
others?"

First of two parts
The other day, bill Ross of the
Daily called to ask me to defend
conservative virtue: "We have
recently published several at
tacks on conservatism," he said,
"and we would like you to reply.
In 110 more than 800 words."
Fight hundred miserly words
to clear up myths and miscon
ceptions about conservatives.
Madonna'. I might as well try
cleaning the stables of Augias
with a toothpick . . .
Moreover Ross would have me
defend conservatism against
libertarian critics, and 1 don't
like to quarrel with libertarians.
For one, 1 call myself a liber
tarian conservative. I deplore the
rilt between libertarians and
conservatives.
I take no pleasure in exposing
the libertarians' epistemological
perplexities. There is so much at
stake, and we have so much in
common.
Hut libertarians, for reasons
which escape me, have resolved
that conservatives are the
enemy, not the collectivists and
the totalitarians with whom they
surreptitiously indulge in the
most puz/.ling and promiscuous
affairs.
Why quarrel?
For another, most libertarians
I happen to respect — like the
admirable Fdith Efron, whom
Tim Ferguson so skillfully
paraphrased in his Oct. 2 Daily
article. How can I quarrel with
one I owe so much ?
bin I wish she'd keep doing
what she does best, e.g., expos
ing the impudent liberal bias ol
tlie media, instead of perorating
on things she doesn't under
stand. e.g.. conservatism.
I'ray, tell me. what can one do
with someone who criticizes the
conservative reliance on au
thority. order, tradition, duty
and patriotism because such
"platonic abstractions . . . are
not derived in any rational
way?"
Isn't there someone to tell
Efron that platonic ideas, which
are the foundations of < lassica
tional rationalism, cannot
themselves be rationally de
rived?
Limpid assertions
And what about an author
who considers that such limpid
propositions as "man is often ir
rational" or "reason, education,
and science cannot solve many
or most human problems" arc
symptoms of a "fascist strain"

corroding the conservative
temper? Mon Dieu, if this be fas
cism, the planet must be crawl
ing with them fascists, all the
way from existentialists to
ecologists.
What am 1 to do with Efron's
loaded complaint that conserva
tives "cannot grasp the primacy
of the individual mind, ... its
right to flout tradition, if that
tradition is fatuous or irrational,
its right to repudiate authority, if
that authority is imbecile or im
moral, its right to destroy order,
if that order is unjust or malig
nant?"
So what's new? Is
Efron really unaware that her
very own formulation implies
the existence of a tradition that is
neither fatuous nor irrational, of
an authority that is neither im
becile nor immoral, of an order
that is neither unjust nor malig
nant?
Can't Ferguson understand
that the conservative's task, and
his anguished dilemma, is pre
cisely to sort them out so as to
know which to "destroy," which
to preserve? Hasn't anyone told
tlie two that it simply isn't
proper to stuff into the premises
tli.it which one wishes to de
monstrate in the conclusions?
What does one prove by claim
ing an individual's right to de
stroy Efron's cherished freedom,
if that freedom is assumed to be
immoral, its practice irrational,
its exercise imbecile?
