Lest the Daily's scenario of bare feet. hair, lef
tovers. rodents .iiul other assorted ingredients be
construed as the truth. I wish to register my objec
tion of tin* unsanitary kitchen conditions attri
buted (Daily. Oct. 20) to Terra Mouse.
While I .1111 unable to speak definitively on the
procedures of the other "very, very bad" co-ops, it
may be of general interest to the Stanford com
munity that we have no desire to poison ourselves
or our guests; for these reasons the following
sanitary procedures art; followed daily.
First, the kitchen floor, counters and stainless
steel are scrubbed and sanitized nightly. All dis
hes and silverware are sterilized; pots and pans
are thoroughly washed: trash cans are emptied.
Weekly kitchen clean-up includes such items
as refrigerators and freezers. Moreover, during
general house clean-ups (once a month), the
stove, ovens, trashcans. shelves and walls are
cleaned, finally, items such as flour, sugar and
grain are stored in closed plastic: containers in a
separate storeroom.
As for the "sack of powdered milk ... by a

trashcan," I can only say that our normal storage
space for powdered milk is across the kitchen; the
probable reason the sack was by the trash can was
that it was empty.
Nonetheless, I do not pretend that our kitchen is
as "spotless" as the University Food Service, but 1
sincerely believe our sanitary conditions are satis
factory to prevent outbreaks of food poisoning,
dysentery or any other catastrophe.
Granted, the kitchen is messy for a few hours
per day during the afternoon when meals are pre
pared. but I am certain that the Food Service is not
spotless during these times either.
Moreover, there are "long-haired girls in bare
feet . . . preparing dinner," but 1 can assure any
potential resident or guest of Terra that they do
not stir the food with either their heads or feet.
And, while we may not be as clean or sanitary as
the Food Service, our food tastes considerably less
sterile and artificial because of it. in addition to
costing less than half the price â€” and those goals
are what food preparation is all about.
