# Urban future hinges on NYC aid
## 
### 
That New York City is proba
bly the worst managed city in tin;
world has long been apparent.
Between a ridiculous financial
portfolio, consistent scandal and
seemingly incessant strikes by
public employes, the city has
done all it can over the years to
fix that image as strongly as pos
sible in the public mind.
So this year, true to its tradi
tion, New York threatens to be
come the first city in the country
to go into default. Although that
once qualified as news, the re
frain has since become familiar:
debts come due, the city worries
(publicly and loudly) about how
to pay them, banks stay open an
extra hour or two, other mayors
warn of the dangers and then —
deus ex muchinu! — some labor
union dips into its valuable
funds to give the ailing city yet
another loan — which must also,
in its time, be repaid.
Hut the problem becomes
especially vital this week, as the

federal government is debating
whether to give any assistance to
the city.
Shuttle persuasion
New York Mayor Abraham
Beanie and many of his fellow
city sovereigns have been flit
ting in and out of Washington.
D.C. recently, trying toconvince
a hesitant Congress and an
adamant President that a default
by New York would have serious
national implications.
The President lias opposed
any federal assistance to the city
from the beginning, first because
(he argues) New York did not de
serve any aid. and later because
(again, his argument) tin,' city
did deserve aid. but the state
should provide it.
This is akin to defending
child-beating 011 the grounds
that although children do de
serve protection, the parents
should provide it.
Others have argued that only
banks and other investors would
be hurt by a default. In any event,
they note, the politicians got the
city into its current mess, and
should bear the brunt of what
ever happens.
Although New York City's
politicians are difficult to defend
(and, in a curious sense, proba
bly do deserve default), and
Chase Manhattan does not really
deserve a federal subsidy, there
are more weighty matters to con
sider.
Unfortunately, Beanie and
other mayors are absolutely cor
rect in arguing that what is hap
pening to New York City could
happen anywhere. Already, in
vestors are losing confidence in
even the highest rated issues of
other cities' bonds. This could
bring about a repetition of New
York's problems even sooner.
To be sure, some could reply
that this simply demonstrates
the extent to which big investors
shy away from anything not fed
erally guaranteed, to the detri
ment of the free market
economy. But since the market
neither is, nor is likelv to be, free,

tliis particular principle hardly
seems worth demonstrating so
dramatically in this case.
|obs are cut
The city, meanwhile, tries to
cut back the only way it knows.
Already, 31,000 jobs have been
eliminated. Now New York Gov.
Hugh Carey and his Municipal
Assistance Corporation (Big Mac
to the initiate), which has taken
over New York City's finances,
have elected to cut 55,000 more
over the next three years (if the
city survives that long).
These statistics help illumi
nate the most pressing nature of
the problem. Certainly, any gov
ernment assistance to the city
will help some incompetent
politicians and unscrupulous
businessmen (the Vice President
of the United States, for exam
ple). but the city's default would
bring down many more people
than these.
Dire consequences
New York City's millions of
residents would suffer. Some
would simply be laid off; for
others, regular payroll or assis
tance checks would not come
through. For the troubled
citizenry, such consequences
would be dire indeed. And al
though that may seem melod
ramatic. city safety officials
warn of rioting and worse if the
city does not remain solvent.
Are those who so vehemently
oppose aid willing to see this
happen, not only in New York,
but quite possibly in other cities
as well?
The city needs the aid and
should get it — who got New
York into the mess is no longer
relevant. The federal govern

ment should back the city's
bonds, to increase investor con
fidence.
The backing need not In; per
manent, and the "California
Plan" to set up a corporation to
insure that no other cities go into
default is inane on its bureaucra
tic face. The aid should, how
ever. be conditional upon the
city taking drastic steps to clean
up the financial mess.
Fears that other cities would
use federal backing of New York
as an excuse for their own future
fiscal irresponsibility may have
some basis, but not much. The
spectre of New York City,
whether il defaults or not, will
undoubtedly haunt urban politi
cians and voters alike for some
time to come.
