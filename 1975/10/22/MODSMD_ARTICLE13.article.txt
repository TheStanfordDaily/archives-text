Default City
Editor:
There is an old saying that pro
tecting tools from the effects of
their follv will produce a world
full of tools. The wisdom of this
saying applies directly to the
fiscal crisis of New York City.
We can see no good reason to
further subsidize the folly of
New York City politicians who
seem to lack the will to cut
budgets unless forced to do so.
These politicians have often
bought their political support
with expensive programs.
It is therefore understandable
th.it they are reluctant to cut back
swollen payrolls and proliferat
ing programs or to expose their
fiscal sleights of hand to public
scrutiny. Hut as California Gov.
Jerry Hrown argues, it is neces
sary to recognize that taxes .it
present are a burden pressing too
heavily on the populace.
Today the political leaders of
New York City need to follow
Hrown's example and face real
ity. Any subsidy, any escape
hatch will only reinforce the
New York politicians' natural
tendency to profligacy. Such .1
course would <ilso encourage
other local governments to fol
low tin; same pattern.
Why should the American
people follow the advice of Nel
son Kocketeller and prop up
with loan guarantees or by as
sumption of funding the poor
investments of brother David
Rocket el ler's bond-burdened
('base Manhattan Hank? This is
folly, plutocracy and special
privilege of the worst order.
If tin! banks have made poor
investments, they should reap
the consequences. This is the
proper assignment of risk. There
should be no socialization by the
government of big business'
costs and risks.
Lastly, the economic effect of a
federal loan guarantee is coun
terproductive. A federal guaran
tee will crowd out productive
investment opportunities.
The limited pool of available
capital will flow into a shaky and
unwise but guaranteed invest
ment (like New York, Lockheed
or Chase Manhattan), while a
productive investment needed
to pull America out of recession
will of necessity go unfunded.
