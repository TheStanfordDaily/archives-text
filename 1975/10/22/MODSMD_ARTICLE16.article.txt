## Jackson still fights Cold War 
### MARK FUNK (Second of two parts 
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) and British poet Rudyard Kipling
might have been close friends had they gotten to know each other.
Kipling's message in jungle Book is philosophically akin to
Jackson's views of the Soviet Union. "Beware ye of Adam-zad,"
Kipling wrote near the turn of the century, "the bear who walks like
a man." The regimes have changed —czarists are now communists
but the mistrust of the Russian bear lingers on. Jackson couches
his mistrust in less literary terms.
He still retains a bit of the cold warrior in him. When Henry
Kissinger advised President Ford not to receive Soviet author
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the White House (Kissinger reasoned
that such a meeting might damage relations with the USSR), it
became a signal for Jackson to step up his assault on detente.
"The very idea that the Soviets can dictate who we see in the
White House is embarrassing," Jackson said, giving every indica
tion that he plans to make detente an issue in the 1976 election.
Jackson said he felt that the major issues in the upcoming Presi
dential election would center around theeconomy. And hepointed
out that one of the reasons he feels the economy has gone sour is in
part due to the Russian wheat deals.
"President Ford, unfortunately, has been a soft touch for the
Russians," Jackson said in Portland last August. "It is high time he
started being a nice guy to working people whose pay checks and
standard of living are being squeezed by soaring prices and infla
tion."
Jackson added that "the Ford administration has pursued a pol
icy which allowed the Russians to purchase the grain they want,
when they want it — and under their own rules of secrecy — at the
expense of regular foreign customers and the American people.
The Russians should regularize their purchases or stand in line
after our regular customers are served."

Nor was the Washington Democrat pleased with the recent Hel
sinki conference. "It served only to legitimize the forced takeover
of people in Eastern Europe."
The energy issue will also figure prominently in Jackson's plans.
He is chairman of the Senate Interior Committee and has headed
the Senate's energy policy since 1971.
While a number of Jackson's stands (particularly on Vietnam and
military spending) will not endear him to some elements of the
Democratic party, his campaign will center on a number of aspects
of his public career.
Jackson is one of the most effective members of the Senate, and
has learned how to wield the powers and innuendos of his off ice for
the benefit of his constituency — which includes labor, the Jewish
community and parts of the defense industry.
Interestingly, Jackson has been named the Senate's "most effec
tive" member in a survey of legislative assistants conducted by
Ralph Nader's organization.
Jackson says he hopes such assets will catapult him to the White
House.
The organization of the Jackson campaign could be a telling
factor in a number of primaries. He is rounding up some impressive
endorsements.
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), another Presidential hopeful, said
he had contacted a number of people about chairing his own
California campaign including State Treasurer Jesse IJnruh. But
Unruh, in Sacramento, had already agreed to head Jackson's cam
paign during this state's primary election.
The financial stability and organization of the Jackson effort
apparently weighed heavily in his decision.
Come 1976, it could be an even more important factor if Henry
Jackson should win his party's nomination and challenge Cerald
Ford for the Presidency.

AL AND SCOOP — Soviet author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Sen. Henry Jackson share an aside
during a reception on Capitol Hill. Later Solzhenitsyn autographed a copy of 'Gulag Archipelago'
for Jackson during a private meeting in the senator's office.
