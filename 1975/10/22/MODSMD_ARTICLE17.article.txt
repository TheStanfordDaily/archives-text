How can you tell if a guy is cir
cumcised or not?
The best way is to ask him. If
he doesn't know, or won't tell
you, take his pants off. Yes, his
underwear too. Look for the
glans penis, the tip of the unerect
penis. If it is obscured by a loose,
flexible piece of skin, he is not
circumcised. If, however, the
foreskin is missing, he is.
Circumcision is an operation,
usually performed after birth,
which has come under increased
criticism. It is done to decrease
the chance of cancer of the penis
(or of the partner's cervix) which
may arise only because of poor
hygiene. Disadvantages of the
removal are an increased suscep
tibility to irritation of the glans
penis during childhood, and
possibly, a loss of sensitivity
during intercourse. Few men

have experienced sex under both
circumstances, however, so the
issue is not clear.

Is it possible for men to perform
fellatio on themselves? My
girlfriend claims her old boy
friend did it once.
I've heard of tooting your own
horn, hut this is ridiculous. Be
lieve it or not, it can be done. A
recent copy of Screiv magazine
features an illustrated interview
with someone calling himself
Dr. Infinity, who regularly per
forms auto-fellatio. He's even
made money with the talent,
having appeared in a porno film
doing a solo. It is a rare ability,
however. The basic requirement
is a very limber body.
Libber's note: women can do it
too.
