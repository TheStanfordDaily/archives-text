## Christiansen scoffs at mutiny tales 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The only thing missing from
Captain Jack Christiansen's act,
at the Northern California loot
hall writer's luncheon yesterday,
were Humphrey Bogart's ball
hearings.
The rumors of a near "mutiny"
among Stanford football players
over Christiansen's decision to
start quarterback Mike Cordova
were old news and Coach Chris

resembled a good stand-up com
edian.
"1 just came from the
dungeons," Christiansen
cracked. "We have all the
mutineers in chains." With the
mood loosened, Chris discussed
the alleged mutiny.
"As far as the article is con
cerned, it's been in the papers.
Some of it is true and some of it is
false," Christiansen said. "One

of the things 1 told my players
was if you're unhappy, you can
turn in your scholarships. I've
talked to some other coaches and
they said, hell, we tell 'em that
every day."
Last man
Christiansen remembered his
playing days at Colorado State
when he was the last man on the
roster. "Everybody's unhappy
when you're second string."

Chris denied reports that his
players had hired an attorney to
settle the quarterback problem.
"They didn't hire a lawyer — if
they did I'd like to know where
they got the money." Yesterday.
Palo Alto Times quoted Chris as
saying that the situation cen
tered on "some disgruntled
alum (Palo Alto attorney Joe
Mecia) who happened to be a
lawyer."
Mecia said that he wrote a let
ter to San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Glenn Dickey, after
Christiansen named Cordova as
the Cards' starter in early Se
ptember. "It was obvious to me
that Christiansen was laying the
foundation to start Cordova
again," said Mecia.
Message to Dickey
"When he came out and had
the balls to say Cordova was
going to start. I wrote to Dickey, I
sent a copy of the letter to Christ
iansen." related Mecia.
"He called meat the office and
read ine the riot act." That was
the last Mecia thought he would
hear of his letter. "If anybody
had suggested a mutiny. I would
have said it was a bad decision. It
exceeded my wildest dreams. I
don't like to create dissension on
the team.
"1 don't know that many
players, but the ones that 1 do
know aren't behind his decision.

Back when I was .it Stanford
(Mecia is a 10(>4 graduate, who
played varsity football), we had
another Jack (Stanford football
coach lack. Curtice) and fans
used to sing 'Hit the road.
Jack.' "
Mecia said that he hadn't
heard of any movement to buy
up Christiansen's contract but
asked, "where do you send the
money?"
Without the reports of revolt,
the football writers wouldn't
have had much to write about.
Stanford takes on what is proba
bly the bust northwest Pacific:
Eight team — Washington
State, in what might be a close
game this Saturday. But
Christiansen's comments about
the Cougars were pretty dull.
"Washington State is one of
the better hitting teams we've
played all year. I talked to
(Cougar Coach Jim) Sweeney
and they'll be i good sound foot
ball team."

Stanford takes on what is proba
bly the bust northwest Pacific:
Eight team — Washington

game this Saturday. But
Christiansen's comments about
the Cougars were pretty dull.

WHERE WERE YOU LAST SATURDAY? — Second-string
punter Tom Lynn (No. 25) talks to safety Mike Connor (No. 2H) at
yesterday's practice. Lynn didn't go with tin? football team to
Washington because of the new NCAA 48-plaver traveling limit.
Two punts were blocked and run in for touchdowns by the Hus
kies in the game.
The only thing missing from
Captain Jack Christiansen's act,
at the Northern California loot
hall writer's luncheon yesterday,
were Humphrey Bogart's ball
hearings.
The rumors of a near "mutiny"
among Stanford football players
over Christiansen's decision to
start quarterback Mike Cordova
were old news and Coach Chris

resembled a good stand-up com
edian.
"1 just came from the
dungeons," Christiansen
cracked. "We have all the
mutineers in chains." With the
mood loosened, Chris discussed
the alleged mutiny.
"As far as the article is con
cerned, it's been in the papers.
Some of it is true and some of it is
false," Christiansen said. "One

of the things 1 told my players
was if you're unhappy, you can
turn in your scholarships. I've
talked to some other coaches and
they said, hell, we tell 'em that
every day."
Last man
Christiansen remembered his
playing days at Colorado State
when he was the last man on the
roster. "Everybody's unhappy
when you're second string."

Chris denied reports that his
players had hired an attorney to
settle the quarterback problem.
"They didn't hire a lawyer — if
they did I'd like to know where
they got the money." Yesterday.
Palo Alto Times quoted Chris as
saying that the situation cen
tered on "some disgruntled
alum (Palo Alto attorney Joe
Mecia) who happened to be a
lawyer."
Mecia said that he wrote a let
ter to San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Glenn Dickey, after
Christiansen named Cordova as
the Cards' starter in early Se
ptember. "It was obvious to me
that Christiansen was laying the
foundation to start Cordova
again," said Mecia.
