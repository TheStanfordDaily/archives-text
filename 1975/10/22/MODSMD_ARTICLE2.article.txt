## 'Hearst admits role as getaway driver' 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Patricia Hearst
has admitted that she drove a getaway
car after a Carmichael, Calif., bank
robbery in which a woman customer
was killed, the Post reported yester
day.
The newspaper said the once
fugitive heiress told at least one person
who interrogated her in recent weeks
about her role in the robbery linked to
the Symbionese Liberation Army
(SLA).
A marked $1 bill from the bank re
portedly was found in the San Fran
cisco apartment which Hearst shared
with Wendy Yoshimura. She also re
portedly rented a garage for one of the
getaway cars.
If she drove the getaway car, under
California law. Hearst still could face a
murder charge as a participant in a
crime in which a murder occurred.
Hearst denial
The Post also reported yesterday
that "sources familiar with the conver
sations" said Hearst said she never was
inside the bank during the holdup in
which a woman was killed by a shot
gun blast.
The newspaper quotes "a well
placed law enforcement official" in
Sacramento as saying. "Our best in
formation at present indicates that she
(Hearst) was probably outside the bank
at the time of the robbery."
Meanwhile, in Harrisburg. Pa., the
government makes a new effort today
to force two reluctant witnesses to tell

u federal grand jury what they know
about harboring Hearst in a Pennsyl
vania farmhouse during the summer of
1974.
Scott and Miller
Micki Scott. 27, Portland, Ore., and
Martin Miller, 28, New York City, re
fused last month to answer any ques
tions claiming FBI harassment and il
legal wiretapping.
Both were granted immunity from
prosecution, paving the way for possi
ble jail on contempt charges — an ac
tion which could be started today be
fore U.S. Dist. Judge Uixon Herman.
