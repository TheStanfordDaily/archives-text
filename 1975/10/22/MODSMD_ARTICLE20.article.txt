# Players vie for cage spots

Terry McCartin slouched on
the first row of the bleachers at
Maples Pavilion, legs fully ex
tended. beads of sweat dripping
from his face, eyes fixed at the
floor.
A two-year starter on
Stanford's junior varsity basket
ball team. McCartin was one of
l'l non-scholarship players who
had just tried out for Dick
DilJiaso's varsity squad last
week. Six of the 19 were invited
to come back after the two-hour
workout, and McCartin was not
among them.
"You down?," the reporter
asked unnecessarily.
"Very much so," McCartin
said frankly. "It looks like I'm
going to be studying a lot." His
tone was one of a player whose
scholastic basketball career
could have just ended.
Because Stanford no longer
has a junior varsity team, you
either play varsity basketball or
intramural basketball.
Teammates made good
Two of the six survivors, Sven
Walkerand Scott Russell, played
|Y ball with McCartin last year.
Tht! others are John Streeter, a
sophomore transfer from Menlo
College, John Mancasola, a
sophmore transfer from Shasta
(lollege. sophomore Eddy Harris
and freshman Andy Patterson.
None of the six can afford to
relax though, as at least one ad

ditional cut remains, Stanford
has 12 scholarship players,
which leaves space for three
other prospects on a projected
15-man roster. In all probability,
that means three of the six
walk-ons will stay and three will
go. Dißiaso said he does not
know when he'll reduce the ros
ter. Mancasola, who at 5-foot-8
lacks size but not confidence,
plans on hanging around. "I'd
say 1 have a good chance to make
it — better than good," he said.
"He (Dißiaso) has only five
guards and I figure he needs six.
I'm confident I can beat out the
other guards."
Good enough
Dißiaso said the two-hour
workout was adequate to deter
mine the top talent. "The players

had all they could do
condition-wise. We chose what
we felt were the six best players
of the group. That's it. We prob
ably made a mistake on one or
two guys, but how do you know?
You can't try out 19 and keep 19.
"I was impressed with, the
players' attitudes. The group as a
whole worked very hard. "Quite
a few guys dove for loose balls
and gave 100 percent."
