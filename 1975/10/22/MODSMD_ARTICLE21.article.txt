IRA still holds kidnap victim
MONASTEREVIN, Ireland — Heavily armed troops and
police tried to rescue a Dutch industrialist from his kid
napers by storming a house in this sleepy market town
yesterday. But the abductors held authorities at bay by
threatening to "blow his head off," police said.
"All communications we've had to date indicate
they're not about to surrender," a police spokesman said.
The kidnapers, believed to be Irish Republican Army

Tiede Herrema 16 days ago, demanding that the Irish
government release three other IRA members from jail.
They repeated these demands yesterday.
