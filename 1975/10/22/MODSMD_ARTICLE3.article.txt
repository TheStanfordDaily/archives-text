# History department:
## Hazard didn't force move 
### MARK NASSUTTI 
The History department moved at
the end of the summer because there
was room available in the old Law
School Annex, not because the History
Corner was a fire hazard, according to
Edward Shaw, executive assistant to

the Provost.
Stanford Fire Chief Frank )urian
said, "There was nothing life
threatening in the building. It met all
safety codes that were applicable."
However, during finals week of
spring quarter last year, three anchors
for a false ceiling came loose in room
214, a lecture hall. The collapse occiy
red because water leaking through a
skylight in the original ceiling
weakened the plaster in which the an
chors were set.
Shaw said, "The ceiling collapse
had nothing to do with the move. We
wanted to get History out of there
while there was room for them in the
Law School Annex building. Vacant
buildings don't stay empty for long
around here."
The early evacuation was not caused
by the building's lack of a sprinkler
system either. Shaw said. "Sprinklers
weren't required by thehuildingcodes
when that building was constructed
(in the 1890s). Wedidn't want tospend
$3(3.000 on a system and then have to
take it out when we remodelled the
building. It was a calculated deci
sion."
But Walter J. Findeisen, assistant re
gistrar and recorder, said. "Personally.
I thought it was a fire trap. Until they

moved the department out of there, I
took that worry to bed wth me every
night"
Asst. History Prof. Dorothy Atkin
son said, "It was impossible to do
any more cosmetic work to the build
ing." Renovation plans now include
complete gutting of the building's in
terior, reinforcement of the outside
structure and complete remodelling of
the inside so it will better fit the
department's needs.
Jurian said that the renovators
would probably use steel-reinforced
concrete, instead of plastered wood, to
remodel the building. As of now.
though, no contract has been signed
for the remodelling project, Shaw said.
Shaw's office is negotiating with ar
chitects.
