# History department:
## Hazard didn't force move 
### MARK NASSUTTI 
The History department moved at
the end of the summer because there
was room available in the old Law
School Annex, not because the History
Corner was a fire hazard, according to
Edward Shaw, executive assistant to

the Provost.
Stanford Fire Chief Frank )urian
said, "There was nothing life
threatening in the building. It met all
safety codes that were applicable."
However, during finals week of
spring quarter last year, three anchors
for a false ceiling came loose in room
214, a lecture hall. The collapse occiy
red because water leaking through a
skylight in the original ceiling
weakened the plaster in which the an
chors were set.
Shaw said, "The ceiling collapse
had nothing to do with the move. We
wanted to get History out of there
while there was room for them in the
Law School Annex building. Vacant
buildings don't stay empty for long
around here."
The early evacuation was not caused
by the building's lack of a sprinkler
system either. Shaw said. "Sprinklers
weren't required by thehuildingcodes
when that building was constructed
(in the 1890s). Wedidn't want tospend
$3(3.000 on a system and then have to
take it out when we remodelled the
building. It was a calculated deci
sion."
But Walter J. Findeisen, assistant re
gistrar and recorder, said. "Personally.
I thought it was a fire trap. Until they

moved the department out of there, I
took that worry to bed wth me every
night"
Asst. History Prof. Dorothy Atkin
son said, "It was impossible to do
any more cosmetic work to the build
ing." Renovation plans now include
complete gutting of the building's in
terior, reinforcement of the outside
structure and complete remodelling of
the inside so it will better fit the
department's needs.
Jurian said that the renovators
would probably use steel-reinforced
concrete, instead of plastered wood, to
remodel the building. As of now.
though, no contract has been signed
for the remodelling project, Shaw said.
Shaw's office is negotiating with ar
chitects.
The target figure for the renovation
project has been set at $10 million, and
the expected date of completion is the
fall of 1978. but until the fund raising
drive for the project has been com
pleted. no remodelling will occur.
Shaw said finding the money for the
project is the main barrier the project
must surmount.
The decision to move the History
Department was made in the early part
of August and was completed by Sept.
15. History Prof. Gordon Craig, former
head of the department, was responsi
ble for organizing and executing the
move.
The Political Science, Spanish and
Portugese and Classics Departments
also moved their headquarters over the
summer. The Spanish and Portugese
Department took up permanent resi
dence in one of the houses on Sal

vatierra Street, while the Classics De
partmnt moved from its old offices to
Building 20 on the Quad, which was
vacated by the Political Science De
partment.
The Political Science Department
consolidated its offices, moving from
three house on Salvatierra Street and
Building 20 into the old law
Prof. Richard Brody. chairman of the
Political Science Department, said he
feels the move has been a good one. He
could not name any major problems
caused by the move and feels that any
that come up will be worked out.
However, at the beginning of the
quarter, the new department locations
caused some confusion since maps
and room assignments in the Autumn
Time Schedule had not been updated.
Furthermore, the time reported in the
Daily for History 1 conflicted with a
departmental memo sent out during
Freshman Orientation.
Some classes were displaced when
Room 214 was closed, but a new lec
ture hall was found before the start of
school for such classes as History 1 and
Political Science 135.
