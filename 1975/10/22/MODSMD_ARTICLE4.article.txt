# Gibbs for separate SWOPSI /SCIRE
## 
### LIZ HUFFERD 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
lames Gibbs will recommend to the
Faculty Senate that SWOPSI and
SCIRE remain autonomous.
"I will basically accept the recom
mendations of the Ad Hoc Panel (on
the Future of Extradepartmental Prog
rams)." said Gibbs in an interview on
KZSU's Campus Conference last
night.
During the broadcast. Gibbs ans
wered Daily and KZSU reporters'
questions about SVVOPSI and SCIRE,
trends in tenure policy, departmental
budget cuts and the new distribution
requirements effective in the 1976-77
academic year.
Gibbs also reflected on his six years
as dean of undergraduate studies dur
ing and after the broadcast.
Gibbs said he found the Report on

the Future of Extradepartmental Prog
rams (EDP). and the deliberations that
went into the report, "very useful." I le
said he learned how students regard
the strength of the programs.
Student priorities
"Separate programs, separate
boards and more places to have stu
dents involved in shaping policy are
the number one priority for them," he
said. "I think that's one of the mes
sages of the Ad Hoc Committee."
"For me," he continued, what was
important was "having those activities
take place in a way as a central part of
the University."
Gibbs proposed last year that
SWOPSI and SCIIRE be consolidated
with the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies. The proposal, which
appeared in the |an. 15 issue of
Campus Report recommended that
"SCIRE should end as a separate prog
ram in June," and SWOPSI end "as a
separate program in June 1976."
"I'm not considering any further
cuts in their budgets." said Gibbs.
Tenure trend?
When asked if he saw a trend in te
nure policy that favored research qual
ities over teaching qualities. Gibbs
said he didn't think so.
"There is no doubt that the chances
of getting tenure are better according
to the reputation of scholarship."

He called administrative-student
controversies about tenure "a situation
that is not symmetrical in terms of ac
cess to information."
"Sometimes, you don't want to harm
a teacher's career by saying something
contrary (to student input)."
Looking back.Gibbs told what it was
like to be dean of undergraduate
studies.
"There is a lack of consensus in the
community about what a dean is to
do."
*|ust impossible'
He said that it is "just impossible" to
get everything done that needs to be
done.
Gibbs has summarized the decanal
office in his five-year report, which he
said he thinks the committee search
ing for a new dean, when organized,
will want to look at.
In regard to his controversial
policies. Gibbs said, "Last year I was
on the unpopular side . , .
"SWOPSI and SCIRE became so
symbolic. I supported them. I thought
more could be done in the depart
ments," Gibbs continued.
"There was a fair amount of intoler
ance last year about the financial aid
issue. The campus rads feel you
should be standing with them critiqu
ing the institution rather than finking
out." he said.
