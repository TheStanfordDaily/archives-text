# KFJC struggling for additional funds
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Constant equipment trouble and an
inability to fund a much needed power
increase characterize the fight for sur
vival of Foothill College's educational
radio station. KFJC.
"We're barely making it finan
cially," said Jona Denz. KFJC station

manager. "Ninety percent of our
equipment is breaking down, and the
only reason we've made it this far is
that we've always had people around
who can effect makeshift repairs."
KFJC receives its funding, less than
$4000. through the Language Arts De
partment of Foothill College, and
raises all additional money on its own,
mostly through movie and concert be
nefits.
But lately that additional money
hasn't been enough to offset additional
complications, said Denz. Overexpen
diture at the end of last year ran the
station slightly into debt and thus it
will receive even less than its allotted
$3970 this year. '
Also, station workers consider a
power increase vital to the future exis
tence of KFJC. Stanford radio station
KZSU. immediately adjacent to KFJC
on the FM dial, filed for such an in
crease before the Federal Communica
tions Commission (FCC) last May.
A KZSU power increase, if ap
proved. could conceivably drown out
KFJC unless it too makes a similar ap
plication to the FCC, an endeavor
which will cost $1500 for the study
and filing, and then an additional
$2500 for new equipment the station
would have to purchase.
Even though the most expensive
piece of equipment associated with the
increase has been donated to KFJC by
the Quadro-Cart Company of San
Mateo, the station's ability to fund the
increase remains in doubt.
' We would have filed our applica
tion jointly with KZSU if we had the
money." said Uenz.
KFJC instead filed a letter of objec
tion with the FCC against KZSU's
power boost, citing potential interfer
ence as the reason.
According to Mark Merrill. KZSU's
chief engineer, the FCC is "in the pro
cess" of sending KZSU a letter indicat
ing the success of the application.
