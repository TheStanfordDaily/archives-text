# Vigil ends quietly
## 
### 
The all-night vigil challenging Navy
recruitment on campus ended yester
day, not with raucous rheforicbut with
a quiet dialogue between under
graduate Alan Bernstein, a vigil par
ticipant, and Lt. George Gordon, Navy
recruiter.
Sitting with Gordon inside the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, Bernstein read a statement
written by participants of the vigil.
"The major role of the military,"
Bernstein stated, "is the protection of
corporate interests in underdeveloped
countries, not the maintenance of a
balance of power between the United
States and the Soviet Union."
Gordon agreed there are "many

problems with both the military and
the country." but he said he believes
our current military strength is neces
sary to deter possible aggressors.
"I see myself as a manager in a deter
rent force." said Gordon, "not as a part
of any war machine."
The vigil participants who remained
outside sat in front of the Placement
Center until about noon, discussing
military spending and its consequ
ences among themselves and with a
few passers-by.
Many students hurried past the vigil
without stopping but the protesters
did not seem discouraged. Said Larry
Litvak, an organizer of the vigil. "Even
the turned heads are important."
