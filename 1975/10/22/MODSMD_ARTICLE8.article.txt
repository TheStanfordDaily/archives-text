# California: kook capital of the western world?
## 
### DAVE SARTORIS 
The Hearst kidnaping, theZebra killings, the
San Quentin escape attempt, the Manson slav
ings, the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the
flower child movement, and two recent threats
on the life of the President all have one thing in
common: they occurred in California.
One presidential aide has labeled theColden
State the "kook capital" of the world. However,
a number of Stanford professors find this title
somewhat inappropriate.
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Seymour
Martin Lipset attributed the state's propensity
for deviance to the attractiveness residents
have for movements. "Movements, both religi
ous and political, tend to have a greater appeal
here. Most individuals are non-natives and
tend to feel unsettled or ill at ease in their
environment.
"In attempting to find themselves, they are
more apt to join groups than are people living
in more settled areas. It is much easier for the
individual to get lost where people don't know
each other well," he added.
Lipset said he believes the absolute number
of "kooks" in California is probably small.
Dissatisfied migrants
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo said he
believes California draws a great number of
migrants who come with some level of previ
ous dissatisfaction. He explained that migrants
don't have their extended families to help them

bear frustration when they find that California
is no better than the place they left.
In Japan, he said, the extended family helps
restrain deviant behavior. Its low crime rate is
attributed to the shame of embarrassing other
family members.
"This system can work only if an individual
has a sense of family that leads to a sense of
community and caring about neighbors,"
Zimbardo said.
According to Psychology Prof. Lee Ross,

California's population is an accumulation of
individuals wbo place little value on their
roots or their past.
"People will not move unless family and
personal ties, those factors which tend to make
a person straight, mean little to them." he said.
New surroundings
"Once in new surroundings, they are free to
live as they please without worry about criti
cism from past acquaintances. As a result, a
wide variety of deviant sexual behaviors, polit
ical views and lifestyles emerges," Ross added.
Ross pointed out a media-induced, self
perpetuating aspect of abnormal social be
havior. "People who want to be loose or de
viant read about others and are inspired to do
the same."
He cited this effect as the reason for the
back-to-back attempts to kill Ford, and warned
that further attempts could result from the pub
licity.
Similarly. Law School Prof. David Rosenhan
maintained that assassination attempts are in
dividual events promoted by radio and televi
sion coverage.
"Suck incidents are the price our society
must pay for a free press." he stated. "The fact
that both occurred in California reminds me ot
the adage. 'All Indians walk in single file, at
least the Indian I saw walked in single file.' It
would take quite a few more attempts to justify
blamine the state."

Rosenhan. an expert on mental health, said
"California certainly does exhibit a broader
political and behavioral spectrum than other
parts of thecountry. However, it is an attractive
place to people in general, not just to those who
are troubled or not normative. There is abso
lutely no evidence that California is more
dangerous than any other state."
Psychiatrist Donald Lunde, who recently ex
amined Patty Hearst, commended. "California

does not have a monopoly of all the kooks. The
highest murder rates are in the South, 12.9 per
100,000 individuals as opposed to 7.H in the
West in 1973. Finger pointing, like gun point
ing. is too simple."
Several studies by the National Institute of
Mental Health support these views. The results
of a statewide survey of the number of
psychiatric beds per 100,000 individuals show
that only seven states had fewer than Califor
nia. New Yorkand Washington. D.C. had many
more.
'Less deviant'
"To the extent that number of beds reflects
need, California is clearly less deviant than
many of the finger-pointing regions of the
East," commented Rosenhan.
Another study, conducted in 1973. found
that California has one of the lowest rates ot
mental hospital admission in the nation.
Crime rates are, and have long been, higher
on the West Coast than in other parts of the
country. However, according to Upset. "Any
area with less tradition and more migration is
likely to have weaker mechanisms of social
control and hence more crime."
Ross said he feels that California is not more
dangerous than other states. "The statistical
chances of any given individual becoming ,i
crime victim are extremely small. People here
have more to fear from driving cars and pollu
tion than from walking the streets."

place to people in general, not just to those who
are troubled or not normative. There is abso
lutely no evidence that California is more
dangerous than any other state."
Psychiatrist Donald Lunde, who recently ex
amined Patty Hearst, commended. "California

does not have a monopoly of all the kooks. The
highest murder rates are in the South, 12.9 per
100,000 individuals as opposed to 7.H in the
West in 1973. Finger pointing, like gun point
ing. is too simple."
Several studies by the National Institute of
Mental Health support these views. The results
of a statewide survey of the number of
psychiatric beds per 100,000 individuals show
that only seven states had fewer than Califor
nia. New Yorkand Washington. D.C. had many
more.
'Less deviant'
"To the extent that number of beds reflects
need, California is clearly less deviant than
many of the finger-pointing regions of the
East," commented Rosenhan.
Another study, conducted in 1973. found
that California has one of the lowest rates ot
mental hospital admission in the nation.
Crime rates are, and have long been, higher
on the West Coast than in other parts of the
country. However, according to Upset. "Any
area with less tradition and more migration is
likely to have weaker mechanisms of social
control and hence more crime."
Ross said he feels that California is not more
dangerous than other states. "The statistical
chances of any given individual becoming ,i
crime victim are extremely small. People here
have more to fear from driving cars and pollu
tion than from walking the streets."


Prof. Philip Zimbardo


Prof. Donald Lunde
The Hearst kidnaping, theZebra killings, the
San Quentin escape attempt, the Manson slav
ings, the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the
flower child movement, and two recent threats
on the life of the President all have one thing in
common: they occurred in California.
One presidential aide has labeled theColden
State the "kook capital" of the world. However,
a number of Stanford professors find this title
somewhat inappropriate.
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Seymour
Martin Lipset attributed the state's propensity
for deviance to the attractiveness residents
have for movements. "Movements, both religi
ous and political, tend to have a greater appeal
here. Most individuals are non-natives and
tend to feel unsettled or ill at ease in their
environment.
"In attempting to find themselves, they are
more apt to join groups than are people living
in more settled areas. It is much easier for the
individual to get lost where people don't know
each other well," he added.
Lipset said he believes the absolute number
of "kooks" in California is probably small.
Dissatisfied migrants
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo said he
believes California draws a great number of
migrants who come with some level of previ
ous dissatisfaction. He explained that migrants
don't have their extended families to help them

bear frustration when they find that California
is no better than the place they left.
In Japan, he said, the extended family helps
restrain deviant behavior. Its low crime rate is
attributed to the shame of embarrassing other
family members.
"This system can work only if an individual
has a sense of family that leads to a sense of
community and caring about neighbors,"
Zimbardo said.
According to Psychology Prof. Lee Ross,

California's population is an accumulation of
individuals wbo place little value on their
roots or their past.
"People will not move unless family and
personal ties, those factors which tend to make
a person straight, mean little to them." he said.
New surroundings
"Once in new surroundings, they are free to
live as they please without worry about criti
cism from past acquaintances. As a result, a
wide variety of deviant sexual behaviors, polit
ical views and lifestyles emerges," Ross added.
Ross pointed out a media-induced, self
perpetuating aspect of abnormal social be
havior. "People who want to be loose or de
viant read about others and are inspired to do
the same."
He cited this effect as the reason for the
back-to-back attempts to kill Ford, and warned
that further attempts could result from the pub
licity.
Similarly. Law School Prof. David Rosenhan
maintained that assassination attempts are in
dividual events promoted by radio and televi
sion coverage.
"Suck incidents are the price our society
must pay for a free press." he stated. "The fact
that both occurred in California reminds me ot
the adage. 'All Indians walk in single file, at
least the Indian I saw walked in single file.' It
would take quite a few more attempts to justify
blamine the state."

Rosenhan. an expert on mental health, said
"California certainly does exhibit a broader
political and behavioral spectrum than other
parts of thecountry. However, it is an attractive

attributed to the shame of embarrassing other
family members.
"This system can work only if an individual
has a sense of family that leads to a sense of
community and caring about neighbors,"
Zimbardo said.
According to Psychology Prof. Lee Ross,

California's population is an accumulation of
individuals wbo place little value on their
roots or their past.
"People will not move unless family and
personal ties, those factors which tend to make
a person straight, mean little to them." he said.
New surroundings
"Once in new surroundings, they are free to
live as they please without worry about criti
cism from past acquaintances. As a result, a
wide variety of deviant sexual behaviors, polit
ical views and lifestyles emerges," Ross added.
Ross pointed out a media-induced, self
perpetuating aspect of abnormal social be
havior. "People who want to be loose or de
viant read about others and are inspired to do
the same."
He cited this effect as the reason for the
back-to-back attempts to kill Ford, and warned
that further attempts could result from the pub
licity.
Similarly. Law School Prof. David Rosenhan
maintained that assassination attempts are in
dividual events promoted by radio and televi
sion coverage.
"Suck incidents are the price our society
must pay for a free press." he stated. "The fact
that both occurred in California reminds me ot
the adage. 'All Indians walk in single file, at
least the Indian I saw walked in single file.' It
would take quite a few more attempts to justify
blamine the state."

Rosenhan. an expert on mental health, said
"California certainly does exhibit a broader
political and behavioral spectrum than other
parts of thecountry. However, it is an attractive
place to people in general, not just to those who
are troubled or not normative. There is abso
lutely no evidence that California is more
dangerous than any other state."
Psychiatrist Donald Lunde, who recently ex
amined Patty Hearst, commended. "California

does not have a monopoly of all the kooks. The
highest murder rates are in the South, 12.9 per
100,000 individuals as opposed to 7.H in the
West in 1973. Finger pointing, like gun point
ing. is too simple."
Several studies by the National Institute of
Mental Health support these views. The results
of a statewide survey of the number of
psychiatric beds per 100,000 individuals show
that only seven states had fewer than Califor
nia. New Yorkand Washington. D.C. had many
more.
'Less deviant'
"To the extent that number of beds reflects
need, California is clearly less deviant than
many of the finger-pointing regions of the
East," commented Rosenhan.
Another study, conducted in 1973. found
that California has one of the lowest rates ot
mental hospital admission in the nation.
Crime rates are, and have long been, higher
on the West Coast than in other parts of the
country. However, according to Upset. "Any
area with less tradition and more migration is
likely to have weaker mechanisms of social
control and hence more crime."
Ross said he feels that California is not more
dangerous than other states. "The statistical
chances of any given individual becoming ,i
crime victim are extremely small. People here
have more to fear from driving cars and pollu
tion than from walking the streets."

The Hearst kidnaping, theZebra killings, the
San Quentin escape attempt, the Manson slav
ings, the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the
flower child movement, and two recent threats
on the life of the President all have one thing in
common: they occurred in California.
One presidential aide has labeled theColden
State the "kook capital" of the world. However,
a number of Stanford professors find this title
somewhat inappropriate.
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Seymour
Martin Lipset attributed the state's propensity
for deviance to the attractiveness residents
have for movements. "Movements, both religi
ous and political, tend to have a greater appeal
here. Most individuals are non-natives and
tend to feel unsettled or ill at ease in their
environment.
"In attempting to find themselves, they are
more apt to join groups than are people living
in more settled areas. It is much easier for the
individual to get lost where people don't know
each other well," he added.
Lipset said he believes the absolute number
of "kooks" in California is probably small.
Dissatisfied migrants
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo said he
believes California draws a great number of
migrants who come with some level of previ
ous dissatisfaction. He explained that migrants
don't have their extended families to help them

bear frustration when they find that California
is no better than the place they left.
In Japan, he said, the extended family helps
restrain deviant behavior. Its low crime rate is
attributed to the shame of embarrassing other
family members.
"This system can work only if an individual
has a sense of family that leads to a sense of
community and caring about neighbors,"
