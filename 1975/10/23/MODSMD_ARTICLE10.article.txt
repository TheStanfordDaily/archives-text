# 'That's one helluva big cake'
## 
### 
San FYancisco Mayor Joseph Alioto dedicated the City's
Bicentennial cake — largest ever baked — early this week
amid sweet celebration.
Some 2000 people, including San Francisco's chic and
super-chic, toasted champagne gl'asses and ate hors
d oeuvres as the 35,000-pound cake was unveiled in the
lobby of the City's Emporium department store.
The 30-foot high cake contains over 2000 pounds of
sugar, 1200 pounds of shortening, 665 dozen eggs, 2600
pounds of flour and a 200-pound "pinch of salt. "There are
some 2000 pounds of edible icing around the cake which
depict scenes of the City's past and of the founding of
America.
The cake is crowned with a diadem of 200 illuminated
candles and the Phoenix, the symbol of the City's rebirth
after the great earthquake of 1906. The cake stands over
three stories high, and rotates slowly on an electrically
powered turntable.
The program included a fashion show of clothes
designed by singer-actress Diana Ross. Ross designed the
clothes for her newly released movie. Mahogany.

When Alioto arrived after the fashion show, he told the
crowd, "I'm glad to be here in the rotunda of the City
Hall." Several people shouted a correction, "Not the City
Hall — the Emporium."
"Well," the mayor responded, "this is where all the
power — and the charm — of San Francisco is tonight."
Alioto was greeted on the podium by singer Frankie
Laine. "My trouble is that I've been associating with too
many Italians," the mayor said after seeing Laine. "This
could mean allegations of conspiracy."
Also present were actors portraying Uncle Sam and the
City's own Emperor Norton. Norton, played by Jack
Brooks, proclaimed the opening of a great birthday celeb
ration.
Both the City and the entire country will celebrate their
Bicentennials next year.
The cost of the project, which exceeded $100,000, was
underwritten entirely by the Emporium with no public or
agency funds involved.
The Emporium will sell a portion of the cake in two
pound packages to help defray the cost.

Some 2000 people, including San Francisco's chic and
super-chic, toasted champagne gl'asses and ate hors
d oeuvres as the 35,000-pound cake was unveiled in the
lobby of the City's Emporium department store.
The 30-foot high cake contains over 2000 pounds of
sugar, 1200 pounds of shortening, 665 dozen eggs, 2600
pounds of flour and a 200-pound "pinch of salt. "There are
some 2000 pounds of edible icing around the cake which
depict scenes of the City's past and of the founding of
America.
The cake is crowned with a diadem of 200 illuminated
candles and the Phoenix, the symbol of the City's rebirth
after the great earthquake of 1906. The cake stands over
three stories high, and rotates slowly on an electrically
powered turntable.
The program included a fashion show of clothes
designed by singer-actress Diana Ross. Ross designed the
clothes for her newly released movie. Mahogany.

When Alioto arrived after the fashion show, he told the
crowd, "I'm glad to be here in the rotunda of the City
Hall." Several people shouted a correction, "Not the City
Hall — the Emporium."
"Well," the mayor responded, "this is where all the
power — and the charm — of San Francisco is tonight."
Alioto was greeted on the podium by singer Frankie
Laine. "My trouble is that I've been associating with too
many Italians," the mayor said after seeing Laine. "This
could mean allegations of conspiracy."
Also present were actors portraying Uncle Sam and the
City's own Emperor Norton. Norton, played by Jack
Brooks, proclaimed the opening of a great birthday celeb
ration.
Both the City and the entire country will celebrate their
Bicentennials next year.
The cost of the project, which exceeded $100,000, was
underwritten entirely by the Emporium with no public or
agency funds involved.
The Emporium will sell a portion of the cake in two
pound packages to help defray the cost.
