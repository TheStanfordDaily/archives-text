# Bullshot Crummond
## Slick satire is delightfully 'B'-grade 
### 
reviewed by David Thiemann
Bullshot Crummond's creators and producers,
the Low Moan Spectacular, come by their name
honestly. Their current satire, featuring Captain
Hugh Crummond, an ex-officer of His Majesty's
Royal Loamshires, elicits as many groans as
laughs.
The production displays superb comic acting
and slick special effects, with airplane crashes,
parachute jumps, naval battles and automobile
chases all put on in fine Grade-"B"-movie style.
The troupe lampoons the Bulldog Drummond
detective novels of the 19205, which antedate most
students, but the vintage melodrama comes off
well anyway.
Of course, not everyone loves satire. People with
straight humor in mind will find themselves perp
lexed and disappointed.
One caution: Plan to student rush on weeknights
for about $2.50. You'll pay five or six dollars
otherwise. And beware the waitresses in this
cabaret-style theater — they push the drinks hard.
