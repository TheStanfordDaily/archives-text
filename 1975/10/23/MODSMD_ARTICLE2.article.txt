# Bootlegs...

### Jim Tranquada 
As the last concert of Neil
Young's 1971 winter four was
drawing to a close, someone in the
audience shouted for "I Anl A
Child."
"Eventually, eventually," Neil
said. "When I first heard that re
cord, it was on the radio. I never
heard it before - they mixed that
down somewhere. I don't know
how they got it. . . it's on a Woods
lock album, as you know. It was
just weird, I was listening fo the
radio, and there I was - and I had
never heard that record before.
I'm used to making my own re
cords, you know? It seemed kind a
strange."
The small cassette tape recorder
somewhere in the audience
picked up a guilty chuckle. Then
another yell split the silence -
"Wooden Nickel!" the title of an
infamous CSNY bootleg.
"Wooden Nickle?" repeated
Neil. "Never heard of it."
The audience laughed know
ingly.
"That's a capitalist ripoff," he
said.

Underground Records sits on a
nondescript, worn-out corner in
downtown San Jose. Inside, past
the turnstile, the multi-colored
patchwork carpet and the toilets
turned-ashtrays reflect the no
hype, comfortable atmosphere.
And standing near the rear, be
tween the classical and used re
cords. are racks of bootlegs —
rows of white-jacketed albums
with minimal artwork and titles
like "Pink Floyd Take Linda Sur
fin'."

Pat O'Gara, the owner of Under
ground Records, has stocked boot
legs ever since she bought the
store five-and-a-half years ago.
Underground is currently the only
store in San Jose that carries boot
legs — a selection of over 60 dif
ferent artists, ranging from the
Allman Brothers to Frank Zappa.
Surprisingly enough, there are
no Soul or R & B bootlegs. But the
wide array nevertheless may
quickly be going out of print.
Paranoia
"It's a very paranoid situation in
LA right now," relates O'Gara. "I
used to have a much larger selec
tion; Wizardo and a lot of the

smaller companies have gone out
of business."
Wizardo, along with Trademark
of Quality and Pigs Eye Records,
are the most prolific and widely
distributed organizations in the
bootlegging business, in a market,
where many small operators
manufacture for a year and then
quickly fold.
The market is "very tight now,"
according to O'Gara. "We buy
when we can." She has written to
all of her suppliers (all available
bootlegs come from LA ) and re
ceived only a few replies that
"hem and haw around." Increas
ingly, more and more of the titles
now in the racks are the last of
their kind.
Booming business
Business is brisk despite the re
cent warnings by respected
sources like KSAN radio that the
inferior quality bootlegs have a
life of 20 plays at most. O'Gara

says that bootlegs sel!"very well.'
The majority of bootlegs are re
corded off live performances.
O'Gara admits that the quality of
the earlier bootlegs was low: The
classic method was to sit in the
front rows with a small cassette
tape recorder that had been smug
gled past the concert security.
But, she asserts, "the quality
of anything recorded in the last
two years is really very good —
very clean." Some boast stereo or
even quad.
In fact, the Rolling Stones' road
manager was so impressed by one
Stones bootleg recorded live in
1969 that he bought copies for
each of the Stones.
Sure thing
"The bootleggers are recording
off of FM radio now — they can't
miss," says O'Gara. "There's even
a rumor going around now that
some guy takes in a remote mic
rophone while his partner sits in a
van outside and records the con

certs with a big reel-to-reel recor
der."
O'Gara emphasize! the fact that
live albums were few and far bet
ween until the popularity and
competition presented by live
bootlegs forced the major record
companies to put out their own
live product — which is what con
sumers wanted all along, O'Gara
notes.
Dylan's most recently released
album. "The Basement Tapes."
was finally released just because
so many of the cuts had appeared
on bootlegs. Dylan, on hearing
that "Basement Tapes" had hit the
top ten, was quoted by Ho/Zing
Stone as saying, "I don't believe it!
I thought everybody had 'em al
ready!"
Gigantic profits
The profit margin in bootlegs is
enormous. When O'Gara finds a
seller, she buys roughly $500
worth — six to eight boxes, with
50 discs to a box. The records cost

about 40 cents to make; the
wholesale price fluctuates bet
ween $1.25 and $2.
Once when she made a purch
ase of 2000 "Jimi Hendrix — Live
in Maui" bootlegs, she was able to
get a price of 89 cents per disc. She
herself sells single albums for
$3.02 (as compared with the L.A.
price of $2.49). double record sets
at $6 and out of print doubles
anywhere from $8 to $15.
World's Indoor Records, on Ki
pling Street in Palo Alto, the only
other local store that carries boot
legs, has a tiny selection, with
singles at $3.99 and $4.89 and
doubles at $0.89. The drying up of
LA sources and fear of legal action
have kept their stock low.
O'Gara has never had any legal
confrontations in almost six years
of business, but the illegality of
bootlegging is still the cause of
much apprehension.
Pseudo-royalties
Bootleggers rationalize their
trade by saying that the record
companies weren't planning to re
lease the material anyway, and
that whatever money the artists
lose, they gain in publicity and
interest generated. Still, some
bootleggers actually have started
paying royalties (at whatever per
centage they wish) — directly to
the artists as a protective legal
measure.
The record industry, generally,
has chosen to ignore the bootleg
gers; they are very difficult to
track down, anyway. Major labels
don't want the problems that go
with legal action — if any com
pany tried to close O'Gara's store,
she says, she "just wouldn't buy
their records anymore."
Although many bootlegs are
just infinite variations of existing
tracks recycled, shuffled and re
packaged, some albums have be
come standards. Neil Young's
1971 performance at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion is a classic, de
spite tape hiss; the Beatle concerts
at the Hollywood Bowl and Shea
Stadium are usually available;
and the Stones' "LIVEr Than
You'll Ever Be" is considered bet
ter than their commercially re
leased live albums.
However, when dealing with
the unstable and volatile world of
bootlegging, it's wise to remember
the saying: "Yer pays yer money
and ver takes yer chances."
