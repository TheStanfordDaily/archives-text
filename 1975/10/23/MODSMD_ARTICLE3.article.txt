# Cinderella story
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Install®iime is a condition that all of us, I
think, would like to try for a certain length
of time, at least. It is probably a euphoric
and dizzying feeling, when all of a sudden
the world clamors for your opinion and
shoves microphones in your face.
Such is the problem — if you can term it a
problem — of Rob Thompson, who wrote
the film that opened the San Francisco Film
Festival, Hearts Of The West. It is the? story
of a writer who finds himself an actor in the
cowboy films of the '30s. Thompson went to
Hollywood to soil it and had the amazing
fortune to meet oroducer Tony Bill almost
immediately. While some screenwriters
strive for months to contact producers
Thompson succeeded in a matter of minutes
"It was an atypical experience. I met him
(Hill) at a restaurant. I was geared up to meet
producers — whoever producers were —
and I just met him and I said, 'You want to
read a good script?' and he said, 'Yeah.' I
hadn't heard of him or The Sting because it
hadn't been released. He called me up two
days later and said he wanted an option on
the material. All of a sudden we were mak
ing a deal at MC.M. It was extraordinarily
lucky."
Numbing experiences
Now he is on a 12-city public relations
tour "It's a curious experience," he exp
lained during lunch in San Francisco last
week. "After you've done it for about 10 to
12 days, things begin to get very fuzzy
around the edges. You find yourself getting
kind of numb."
Although it's his first screenplay, Hearts
Of The West became a major motion picture,
beating many odds. Most pictures written
by newcomers (and some professionals)
never even get produced, much less re
leased.
The beginning of this
incredible Cinderella-type story began in
Seattle when Thompson, a documentary
filmmaker, decided he wanted to break into
the "real" movies, and to use writing as a
springboard. His sole contact with Hol
lywood had been a job as location mangager
for John Wayne's McQ.
Sudden inspiration
"I wanted to write a script." Thompson
relates. "I didn't know what to write about.
I'd been watching 'B' Westerns for a long
time on a Seattle television station that
would run them every day from 5 to 0:30. I'd
seen about 30 of these . . . enjoying the hell

out of it, (when) it hit me — this is the milieu
to work with. That's where I started from.
"I don't think I would have done it if a lot
of people had been digging these grounds
prior to it. 1-ean't think of any movies that
dealt with the making of 'B' Westerns. So 1

From filmmaker to screenwriter in one easy step —
the Rob Thompson miracle

felt good about that. I did a little bit of re
search, but not much."
His research included consulting Bob
Steele, an old movie cowboy who is still in
great physical condition, "to make sure we
weren't making any incredible blunders."

Like most of Hollywood, Thompson is
young — and perhaps a little bit naive. Of
course, who wouldn't be, without having
gone through all the trouble it normally
takes to be a success? Everything went as
smoothly as satin.
His timing may have been perfect, too.
for it is generally acknowledged that Hol
lywood is entering upon the era of the wri
ter. With the importance of good scripts
increasing, writers with talent can now
write their own passports to the top.
Thompson, like everybody else, he says,
wants to be a director.
However, for his next picture, Killers
Don't Kiss, a comedy spoof of detective
movies, he's settling for the status of pro
ducer, with Bill as executive producer.
That's pretty fast for someone who wanted
to be a cinematographer when he started
out.
It must be noted, however, that Thomp
son proved himslf a capable writer with the
Hearts Of The West screenplay. An ex
tremely original and entertaining film, it is
peopled by some of the most eccentric
characters since Day Of The Locust.
Good characterization
Those characters were performed excel
lently, Thompson asserts, by the cast of Jeff
Bridges, Alan Arkin, Andy Griffith, Blythe
Danner and Donald Pleasance. He was ex
tremely pleased with Bridges' performance
in particular.
"He just became the character. After the
first days of shooting, he was the character
to me. You have that ambivalent feeling
when you see a guy for the first time, be
cause if you write a film on speculation, you
obviously don't have anybody in mind.
When you see the person, he's different
from what you imagined. And you're a little
shocked.
"Then you watch him and he begins
doing the lines. You see the . . . dailies, and
you completely erase the other notion and
that guy becomes your character com
pletely."
Asked if he ever wanted to be an actor,
Thompson laughed and shrugged it off.
"That would be a cataclysmic mistake. I
couldn't remember the lines. I stand there
behind the camera, and I go over the lines. I
imagine what it would be like to step over,
just six feet in front of the lens. It would
comeout of my mouth like Ralston Purina."
