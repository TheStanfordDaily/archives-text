# Their hearts were in it
## ...making this Western a smashing success 
### 
reviewed by Howard Baldwin
From the first scene of Hearts Of
The West, the screen test of cow
boy Lewis Tater, one knows that
Jeff Bridges has portrayed his best
character yet. Tater wants to be a
ZaneGrey Western writer, but the
West he is infatuated with bit the
dust long ago.
It has been reincarnated,
though, in that never-never-land
called Hollywood of the '30s,
where nothing is as it seems and
the past can be recreated to pro
duce any desired effect.
On the run from two con men
who lured him to the West inad
vertently, Tater encounters a
group of actors working under the
direction of Kessler (Alan Arkin).
Joining up with them and return
ing to Hollywood, he gets caught
up in the wild and woolly days of
the brand-new film capital.
The eccentric and unique indi
viduals he meets and grows to like
contribute to this very strong
movie.
Eccentric cast
Howard Pike (Andy Griffith —
in a superb portrayal) is a fallen

idol forced to be an extra. Trouty
(Blythe Danner) is a script girl
who falls for Tater. A.J. Neitz
(Donald Pleasance) is the pub
lisher who is even more eccentric
than the actors. All of the perfor
mances are excellent.
Bridges in particular outdoes
himself. Another Oscar nomina
tion is possible, because his
drawl, his naivete and his back
ward lowa country-boy personal
ity are integrated perfectly into an
interesting and lovable character.
So often one just doesn't care
about the characters whom he's
watching, but Tater and his frinds
are so well-done and likeable that
Hearts Of The West is a true pleas
ure to watch.
Special honors must go to
Arkin's characterization. While it
has a few too many of the man
nerisms of his Lt. Practice
in Little Murders, he is still the
perfect prototype of Hollywood
with his raging artistic tempera
ment.
'Sting'-ing staff
Hearts was directed with a com
fortable zeal by Howard Zieff

(Slither), written by newcomer
Rub Thompson and produced by
Tony Bill, this being his first pro
duction following the legendary
Sting.
As a comedy, the movie has
much to offer. The elements of
Tater's indoctrination to Hol
lywood balance with the con
men's pursuit to make more than a
comedy, though.
Beyond the laughter is a period
little explored — the days when
"B" Westerns were the staple of
Saturday-afternoon movies. It is a
time that is long gone and not
likely to return again. The film
evokes the period of Cower Gulch
and the dusty Western locations
perfectly.
It is also the enchanting story of
a man born too late. Unlike the rest
of us, though, he was lucky
enough to discover the time
period he really loved in a rather
magical place In a rousing finale
in which life imitates art, rather
than vice versa, time is reversed
and dreams come true. Hearts Of
The West is what Hollywood does
best.

Special honors must go to

Hearts was directed with a com
fortable zeal by Howard Zieff

(Slither), written by newcomer
Rub Thompson and produced by
Tony Bill, this being his first pro
duction following the legendary
Sting.
As a comedy, the movie has
much to offer. The elements of
Tater's indoctrination to Hol
lywood balance with the con
men's pursuit to make more than a
comedy, though.
Beyond the laughter is a period
little explored — the days when
"B" Westerns were the staple of
Saturday-afternoon movies. It is a
time that is long gone and not
likely to return again. The film
evokes the period of Cower Gulch
and the dusty Western locations
perfectly.
It is also the enchanting story of
a man born too late. Unlike the rest
of us, though, he was lucky
enough to discover the time
period he really loved in a rather
magical place In a rousing finale
in which life imitates art, rather
than vice versa, time is reversed
and dreams come true. Hearts Of
The West is what Hollywood does
best.

THEIR HEARTS ARE IN IT — Jeff Bridges (left) and Alan Arkin
firepare to rehearse a bit of derring-do for a Western movie in a scene
rom "Hearts Of The West."
reviewed by Howard Baldwin
From the first scene of Hearts Of
The West, the screen test of cow
boy Lewis Tater, one knows that
Jeff Bridges has portrayed his best
character yet. Tater wants to be a
ZaneGrey Western writer, but the
West he is infatuated with bit the
dust long ago.
It has been reincarnated,
though, in that never-never-land
called Hollywood of the '30s,
where nothing is as it seems and
the past can be recreated to pro
duce any desired effect.
On the run from two con men
who lured him to the West inad
vertently, Tater encounters a
group of actors working under the
direction of Kessler (Alan Arkin).
Joining up with them and return
ing to Hollywood, he gets caught
up in the wild and woolly days of
the brand-new film capital.
The eccentric and unique indi
viduals he meets and grows to like
contribute to this very strong
movie.
Eccentric cast
Howard Pike (Andy Griffith —
in a superb portrayal) is a fallen

idol forced to be an extra. Trouty
(Blythe Danner) is a script girl
who falls for Tater. A.J. Neitz
(Donald Pleasance) is the pub
lisher who is even more eccentric
than the actors. All of the perfor
mances are excellent.
Bridges in particular outdoes
himself. Another Oscar nomina
tion is possible, because his
drawl, his naivete and his back
ward lowa country-boy personal
ity are integrated perfectly into an
interesting and lovable character.
So often one just doesn't care
about the characters whom he's
watching, but Tater and his frinds
are so well-done and likeable that
Hearts Of The West is a true pleas
ure to watch.
