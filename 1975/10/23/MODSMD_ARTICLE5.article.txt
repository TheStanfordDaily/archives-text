Look At The Harlequins!, by
Vladimir Nabokov (McGraw Hill,
$7.95)
In his latest novel. Look At The
Harlequins!, Vladimir Nabokov
has proven that at the age of 75 he
is still at the top of his creative
powers. This is his best novel for
nearly a decade, which is saying
quite a lot.
Although half of his books are
written in Russian, Nabokov is
without a doubt the greatest living
American novelist. Indeed he is
perhaps the greatest literary im
migrant who ever lived.

And like Stravinsky and Picasso
betore him, Nabokov has lived long
enough to see his genius ap
preciated. He has been fortunate
enough to see honor (and money)
heaped at his feet.
Nabokov's success has caused
problems. When an artist lives
long enough to become classic, he
makes his audience uneasy. The
audience has already defined him
in terms of his masterpieces, and
they are not easily persuaded to
change their minds.
If the author writes the same
kind of book, the critics condemn
him as a mannerist who engages

in self-parody. If he writes a dif
ferent kind of book, the critics re
gretfully inform him that an old
dog can learn no new tricks.
Beautiful parody
Look At The Harlequins! is an
example of self-parody that works
beautifully. Nearly 20 years ago,
Nabokov wrote Speak, Memory
which is probably one of the best
autobiographies written in any
language. Nabokov's new novel is
a mock autobiography by a fic
tional writer from a background
similar to Nabokov's.
A reader does not have to be
familiar with Nabokov's career to

appreciate that Look At The
Harlequins! speaks for itself with
absolute assurance.
It is a marvelously funny novel,
and its chief objects of satire —
frustrated intellectuals, obtuse
professors, deposed aristocrats
and intimidating sexually liber
ated women — are universal facts
of life.
Vast tableau
As Nabokov's alter ego
sheepishly runs from nation to na
tion avoiding wars, revolutions
and old friends, he encounters do
zens of such eccentric: figures.
In 100 years, some professor
might well try to identify each
character, but a reader today will
only sit back and enjoy them as
literary figures.
Nabokov is too often praised as
a stylist to the expense of his other
talents. Few novelists since Dick
ens have created as many devas
tatingly funny characters as
Nabokov. Look At The Harle
quins! makes this talent abun
dantly clear.
Success of style
Nabokov uses style to create his'
characters. They often are in

separable from the way they are
described. How many comic
characters have been so success
fully drawn in one marvellous
sentence as Nabokov depicts Oks,
a Russian bookseller:
"He was one of those persons
who for some reason or other are
often interrupted, but whom no
force in our blessed galaxy will
prevent from completing their
sentence, despite new interrup
tions, of an elemental or poetical
nature, the death of his inter
locutor ('I was just saying to him,
doctor'), or the entrance of a
dragon."
Intellectually underfed souls
may balk at Nabokov. Their
meagre diets of Hemingway,
movies and popular music have
left their tastes underdeveloped.
They are suspicious of anyone
who doesn't write like an ungifted
newspaper reporter.
But those readers who enjoy se
eing their own language used
creatively and delightfully will
treasure Look At The Harlequins!
Perhaps it takes a Russian to teach
Americans what English can do.

Nabokov uses style to create his'

a Russian bookseller:
"He was one of those persons

Look At The Harlequins!, by
Vladimir Nabokov (McGraw Hill,
$7.95)
In his latest novel. Look At The
Harlequins!, Vladimir Nabokov
has proven that at the age of 75 he
is still at the top of his creative
powers. This is his best novel for
nearly a decade, which is saying
quite a lot.
Although half of his books are
written in Russian, Nabokov is
without a doubt the greatest living
American novelist. Indeed he is
perhaps the greatest literary im
migrant who ever lived.

And like Stravinsky and Picasso
betore him, Nabokov has lived long
enough to see his genius ap
preciated. He has been fortunate
enough to see honor (and money)
heaped at his feet.
Nabokov's success has caused
problems. When an artist lives
long enough to become classic, he
makes his audience uneasy. The
audience has already defined him
in terms of his masterpieces, and
they are not easily persuaded to
change their minds.
If the author writes the same
kind of book, the critics condemn
him as a mannerist who engages

in self-parody. If he writes a dif
ferent kind of book, the critics re
gretfully inform him that an old
dog can learn no new tricks.
Beautiful parody
Look At The Harlequins! is an
example of self-parody that works
beautifully. Nearly 20 years ago,
Nabokov wrote Speak, Memory
which is probably one of the best
autobiographies written in any
language. Nabokov's new novel is
a mock autobiography by a fic
tional writer from a background
similar to Nabokov's.
