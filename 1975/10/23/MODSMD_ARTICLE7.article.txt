The Wind and the Lion
Directed by John MHus
Rewritten history, Hollywood style, has
never come out better Brian Keith as Teddy
Roosevelt tries to rescue Candice Bergen
as Eden Pedecaris (who was male in the
original incident) from Sean Connery as
Raisuli, the Last of the Barbary Pirates. It is
a majestic production, corny at times, but
thrilling in the tradition of old-time adventure
movies."**
Singin' In The Rain
Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene
Kelly
The 1952 MGM musical that supplied the
world with some of the most magical musi

cal moments. A multi-faceted film showing
Hollywood both in the halcyon days of 1927
before and after sound arrived and in 1952
just before the days of TV when no expense
was spared for a lavish production. The
songs, Kelly's dancing and his superb per
formance as a Hollywood lover make the
picture worth seeing â€” again.****

Rollerball
Directed by Norman Jewison
A chilling look into the not-so-distant future
when corporations have taken over the
world and the masses are subdued by the
ultraviolent rollerball game, a conglomera
tion ot roulette, motorcycling, roller derby
and hockey. James Caan plays the im
mensely popular Jonathan E. who becomes
powerful enough to challenge the reign ot
the corporations.****

The Return of the Pink Panther
Directed by Blake Edwards
Coolly mincing his way through the intrigues
ot international crime and the phonetic
hazards of renting a hotel "rum," Peter Sel
lers is at his bumbling best as Inspector
Clouseau.""*
Love and Death
Directed by Woody Allen
Allen, a frustrated seeker of truth, gets lost
among philosophical cobwebs of Tolstoy
and Dostoevsky with Diane Keaton, who is
merely frustrated. Less frenzied than his
earlier films, this is Woody Allen's most ma
ture piece of filmmaking. He even gets the
girl.""
Nashville
Directed by Robert Altman
This tour de force covers several days in the
lives of about 20 characters caught up in the
Nashville scene. We don't think it's the
American epic it is purported to be, but the
capsule performances of Henry Gibson, Lily
Tomlin and Roni Blakely are outstanding."'
Let's Do It Again
Directed by Sidney Poitier
A "sequel" bearing little resemblance to
Uptown Saturday Night, though both star
Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier. Trying to
raise money for their lodge, Cosby and
Poitier hypnotize a pipsqueak boxer (Jimmy
Walker) to make him a winner. Though
weak and hackneyed in spots, overall it is
funny and enjoyable."*
Rooster Cogburn
Directed by Stuart Millar
A tired re-hashing of the old African Queen

plot, with Katie Hepburn playing almost ex
actly the same role as she did with Bogart
She and John Wayne attempt to find the
criminals who killed her father and stole
some nitroglycerine, but it comes off as bor
ing and contrived. The sequel to True Grit '
Farewell My Lovely
Directed by Dick Richards
Robert Mitchum underplays the role of
Philip Marlowe to the point of catatonia. He
pursues a long line of dead bodies in his
search for the mysterious girlfriend of a
client. Though accurate in its portrayal of the
seamy side of Los Angeles, it leans on
Mitchum for support and falls flat on its face.
There is vitality in Raymond Chandler's Mar
lowe, while Mitchum appears to be asleep
most of the time."
Funny Lady
Directed by Herbert Ross
Barbra Streisand returns as Fanny Brice,
her Oscar-winning role in Funny Girl. If you
don t look too closely at the gaping holes in
the picture, Streisand is beautiful and her
voice is overwhelming. James Caan pro
vides contrast and balance as Brice's sec
ond husband Billy Rose A glossy musical to
end all glossy -musicals.***
Journey Into Fear
Directed by Daniel Mann
The most muddled mystery to come out in a
long time Oil company employe Graham
(Sam Waterston) is pursued by unknown
nemesis on a trip from Turkey to New York.
Exploitative violence, poor editing and a
choppy finale waste a fine cast of name
actors, including lan McShane, Shelley
Winters and Stanley Holloway."
The Fortune
Directed by Mike Nichols
One of the few really likable comedies that
has surfaced recently, edged with black
humor. It's the story of two con men out to
murder the heiress to a sanitary napkin for
tune and their bungled attempts are hilari
ous. Jack Nicholson's performance is one of
his best. Warren Beatty reveals a talent for
comedy as the stuffy con man Newcomer
Stockard Channing sparkles as the
heiress.****
