# Diana Ross is supreme
## 
### 
reviewed by Howard Baldwin
It is a major "truth" that there
are no women's roles being writ
ten in this macho world of Nichol
son. I'acino and Bronson. This is a
reversal from the ':10s and '40s,
when almost ail the big stars were
women (Katherine Hepburn, Bette
Davis, Greer Garson, Joan Craw
ford, Norma Shearer), and the pic
tures were dedicated to them
along.
However, amazingly enough,
here in 1975 is a woman's film,
that shows its main character as an
ingenious, gutsy and ambitious
individual. It is Mahogany, star
ring Diana Ross and Billy Dee Wil
liams, that charismatic couple
from Lady Sings The Blues, for
which she received an Oscar
nomination.
And while Ross' performance
here as a secretary-turned-model
turned-fashion designer is not as
powerful as her performance as
Billie Holiday, she still carries the
film perfectly, as if acting had al
ways been heir career.
No cliche
Tracy Chambers (Ross) is a
fiercely competitive woman
struggling in a world dominated
by men, determined to be a first

class designer. While this may
sound cliched, it isn't, because of
the uniqueness screenwriter John
Byrum infused into the charac
ters.
Tony Perkins plays Sean
McAvov, an eccentric, impotent
and otherwise psychologically
disorganized fashion photo
grapher who takes Tracy on as his
model, naming her, as he does all
his models, after something in
animate. "What is dark, beautiful
and rare? I'll call you
'Mahogany'."
Billy Dee Williams' character is
equally fascinating. He is charm
ing as a ghetto politician, but his
character lacks the patience and
fortitude to make a really good al
derman. The idea of a politician as
a loser rather than total winner is
interesting.
Outstanding support
Jean Pierre Aumont plays the
millionaire who believes he can
buy anything he wants, and yet
can be the perfect gentleman's
perfect gentleman.
Nina Foch's cameo as Tracy's
boss and Beah Richards' role as
Tracy's aunt are both great, too.
The acting is uniformly outstand
ing.
Tracy's life is one of constant
conflict between her and Brian
Walker (Williams). Their careers
don't always mesh perfectly, and,

while she loves him, she can not
subordinate her desire for success.
Neither feels really comfortable in
the shadow or the world of the
other, and theirs is a Hubbell
Gardner-Katie Morosky relation
ship until the final scenes.
Love stories have rarely been
big recently, with The Way We
Were being the best of a long
while. But now Mahogany can
take its place among the love
stories of the '70s. The last scene,
at one of Walker's political rallies,
has a charm and simplicity all its
own.
Mahogany was directed by
Berry Gordy, who took over from
Tony Richardson. As chairman of
the board of Motown Records,
which financed the lavish film,
Gordy has proved that he is as
capable a film director as he is a
record producer.

Outstanding support
Jean Pierre Aumont plays the
millionaire who believes he can
buy anything he wants, and yet
can be the perfect gentleman's
perfect gentleman.
Nina Foch's cameo as Tracy's
boss and Beah Richards' role as
Tracy's aunt are both great, too.
The acting is uniformly outstand
ing.
Tracy's life is one of constant
conflict between her and Brian
Walker (Williams). Their careers
don't always mesh perfectly, and,

while she loves him, she can not
subordinate her desire for success.
Neither feels really comfortable in
the shadow or the world of the
other, and theirs is a Hubbell
Gardner-Katie Morosky relation
ship until the final scenes.
Love stories have rarely been
big recently, with The Way We
Were being the best of a long
while. But now Mahogany can
take its place among the love
stories of the '70s. The last scene,
at one of Walker's political rallies,
has a charm and simplicity all its
own.
Mahogany was directed by
Berry Gordy, who took over from
Tony Richardson. As chairman of
the board of Motown Records,
which financed the lavish film,
Gordy has proved that he is as
capable a film director as he is a
record producer.

ON THE WAY UP — Diana Ross plays a woman struggling to
succeed in a male-chauvinist world in the recently released film
"Mahogany."
reviewed by Howard Baldwin
It is a major "truth" that there
are no women's roles being writ
ten in this macho world of Nichol
son. I'acino and Bronson. This is a
reversal from the ':10s and '40s,
when almost ail the big stars were
women (Katherine Hepburn, Bette
Davis, Greer Garson, Joan Craw
ford, Norma Shearer), and the pic
tures were dedicated to them
along.
However, amazingly enough,
here in 1975 is a woman's film,
that shows its main character as an
ingenious, gutsy and ambitious
individual. It is Mahogany, star
ring Diana Ross and Billy Dee Wil
liams, that charismatic couple
from Lady Sings The Blues, for
which she received an Oscar
nomination.
And while Ross' performance
here as a secretary-turned-model
turned-fashion designer is not as
powerful as her performance as
Billie Holiday, she still carries the
film perfectly, as if acting had al
ways been heir career.
No cliche
Tracy Chambers (Ross) is a
fiercely competitive woman
struggling in a world dominated
by men, determined to be a first

class designer. While this may
sound cliched, it isn't, because of
the uniqueness screenwriter John
Byrum infused into the charac
ters.
Tony Perkins plays Sean
McAvov, an eccentric, impotent
and otherwise psychologically
disorganized fashion photo
grapher who takes Tracy on as his
model, naming her, as he does all
his models, after something in
animate. "What is dark, beautiful
and rare? I'll call you
'Mahogany'."
Billy Dee Williams' character is
equally fascinating. He is charm
ing as a ghetto politician, but his
character lacks the patience and
fortitude to make a really good al
derman. The idea of a politician as
a loser rather than total winner is
interesting.
