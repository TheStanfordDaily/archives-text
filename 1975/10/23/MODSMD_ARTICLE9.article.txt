# Spy vs. spies
## Former CIA agent Philip Agee tells all about his former colleagues and employers 
### 
reviewed by Merrit Ruhlen
Inside the Company: CIA
Diary, by Philip A gee.
I started out to do my duty,
ended up just doing time.
What is it about you,
that makes so many change their
minds.
You had me on your honor roil,
for your dream I would die;
now I would not even cross the
street
to help you live a lie.
-from "Changes" by Harry
Chap in
Recruited off the Notre Dame
campus in 1956, Philip Agee
spent the 1960s as a CIA agent in
Latin America, first in Ecuador,
then in Uruguay and finally as a
"U.S. embassy attache" for the
1968 Olympic games in Mexico
City.
He went into the CIA with all
the idealism and enthusiasm that
often characterizes bright young
men fresh out of college. He res

igned in 1969 after coming to the
realization that "I became the ser
vant of the capitalism I rejected. I
became one of its secret police
men.
"The CIA, after all, is nothing
more than the secret police of
American capitalism, plugging
up leaks in the political dam night
and day so that the shareholders of
U.S. companies operating in poor
countries can continue enjoying
the rip-off," he noted.
From spy to activist
In the book, Agee reconstructs,
in the form of a diary, his 12-year
career, tracing his evolution from
a dedicated CIA "case officer" to
socialist revolutionary.
The book is long (598 pages)
and at times too detailed for the
casual reader, but as the only book
ever written about a former agent
without the approval of CIA cen
sors, it is worth the effort.
Part of the difficulty stems from
Agee's decision to disclose the
identities of as many CIA person
nel (both American and foreign),

operations and code names as
memory would allow. In so doing
he has made the book, in addition
to being simply a chronicle of life
in the CIA, a political document,
in the sense of Daniel Ellsberg's
"Pentagon Papers," for it shows
that the official description of the
CIA in Washington and the actual
practices of the CIA in Latin
America bear little resemblance to
each other.
Congressional coverup
In Washington, the official line
is that the purpose of the CIA is to
protect democracy and freedom
around the world, though in re
cent months certain "excesses"
(e.g., domestic spying, mail cov
ers, murder, Mafia connections)
have been admitted and are cur
rently being "corrected" by Con
gressional investigations.
The reality in Latin America is
that "CIA operations constitute
the usually unseen efforts to shore
up unjust, unpopular, minority
governments, always with the
hope that overt military interven

tion (as in Vietnam and the
Dominican Republic) will not be
necessary. The interests of the
privileged minorities in poor
countries lead back to, and are
identified with, the interests of the
rich and powrful who control the
U.S."
'Alliance': myth
At the beginning of his career,
Agee believed the official prop
aganda concerning thebenevolent
role which the United States is re
ported to play in Latin America.
The famous Alliance for Progress
aided economic growth in under
developed countries, raising the
living standard of the lower clas
ses, who (everyone admits) live in
deplorable conditions.
After a decade in Latin America,
Agee's perception of the Alliance
had changed: "The Alliance for
Progress has been, in effect, a sub
sidy program for U.S. exporters
and private investors. For the Un
ited States this has meant a return
to private investors of about five
dollars for every dollar sent from
the U.S. to Latin Amrica during
the period, plus a favorable trade
balance, plus billions of dollars in
loans that are earning interest and
will someday be repaid. In other
words Latin America through the
Alliance for Progress has contri
buted to the economic develop
ment of the United States and has

gone into debt to do it."
Unlike many of the current CIA
critics who want the agency
"clea\ed up," Agee recognizes
that it is not the CIA, but the
economic system of which it is a
small part, which must be re
formed.
Oppressive capitalism
"Reforms qf the FBI and CIA,
even the removal of the President
from office, cannot remove the
problem. American capitalism,
based as it is on exploitation of the
poor, with its fundamental moti
vation in personal greed, simply
cannot survive without force —
without a secret police force. The
argument is with capitalism and it
is captalism that must be opposed,
with its CIA, FBI and other sec
urity agencies understood as logi
cal, necessary manifestations of a
ruling class's determination to re
tain power and privilege," he ar
gues.
According to the U.N. economic
commission, the poorest 20 per
cent of the population in Latin
America receives three percent of
the total income, the poorest half
of the population receives only 13
percent the richest five percent re
ceives 33 percent.
Paul and ArtneEhrlich point out
in The End of Affluence that "in
the late 1960s fish exported to de
veloped countries by Peru alone
would have been enough to make
up the protein deficit of all Latin
Americans. Poor nations all too
often export food that is needed at
home in a world where money,
not need, determines interna
tional flows of goods. For exam
ple, a recent 40 percent rise in
meat production in Guatemala
was accompanied by a six percent
declinc in Guatemalan per capita
meat consumtion."
For those who find such statis
tics disturbing and would like to
know how such an inhumane and
unjust system can be sustained, a
reading of Agee's book is a good
place to start.

Part of the difficulty stems from

nel (both American and foreign),

operations and code names as
memory would allow. In so doing

in the CIA, a political document,
in the sense of Daniel Ellsberg's
"Pentagon Papers," for it shows
that the official description of the
CIA in Washington and the actual
practices of the CIA in Latin
America bear little resemblance to

Congressional coverup
In Washington, the official line
is that the purpose of the CIA is to
protect democracy and freedom
around the world, though in re
cent months certain "excesses"
(e.g., domestic spying, mail cov
ers, murder, Mafia connections)
have been admitted and are cur
rently being "corrected" by Con
gressional investigations.
The reality in Latin America is
that "CIA operations constitute
the usually unseen efforts to shore
up unjust, unpopular, minority
governments, always with the
hope that overt military interven

tion (as in Vietnam and the
Dominican Republic) will not be
necessary. The interests of the
privileged minorities in poor
countries lead back to, and are
identified with, the interests of the
rich and powrful who control the
U.S."
'Alliance': myth
At the beginning of his career,
Agee believed the official prop
aganda concerning thebenevolent
role which the United States is re
ported to play in Latin America.
The famous Alliance for Progress
aided economic growth in under
developed countries, raising the
living standard of the lower clas
ses, who (everyone admits) live in
deplorable conditions.
After a decade in Latin America,
Agee's perception of the Alliance
had changed: "The Alliance for
Progress has been, in effect, a sub
sidy program for U.S. exporters
and private investors. For the Un
ited States this has meant a return
to private investors of about five
dollars for every dollar sent from
the U.S. to Latin Amrica during
the period, plus a favorable trade
balance, plus billions of dollars in
loans that are earning interest and
will someday be repaid. In other
words Latin America through the
Alliance for Progress has contri
buted to the economic develop
ment of the United States and has

gone into debt to do it."
Unlike many of the current CIA
critics who want the agency
"clea\ed up," Agee recognizes
that it is not the CIA, but the
economic system of which it is a
small part, which must be re
formed.
Oppressive capitalism
"Reforms qf the FBI and CIA,
even the removal of the President
from office, cannot remove the
problem. American capitalism,
based as it is on exploitation of the
poor, with its fundamental moti
vation in personal greed, simply
cannot survive without force —
without a secret police force. The
argument is with capitalism and it
is captalism that must be opposed,
with its CIA, FBI and other sec
urity agencies understood as logi
cal, necessary manifestations of a
ruling class's determination to re
tain power and privilege," he ar
gues.
According to the U.N. economic
commission, the poorest 20 per
cent of the population in Latin
America receives three percent of
the total income, the poorest half
of the population receives only 13
percent the richest five percent re
ceives 33 percent.
Paul and ArtneEhrlich point out
in The End of Affluence that "in
the late 1960s fish exported to de
veloped countries by Peru alone
would have been enough to make
up the protein deficit of all Latin
Americans. Poor nations all too
often export food that is needed at
home in a world where money,
not need, determines interna
tional flows of goods. For exam
ple, a recent 40 percent rise in
meat production in Guatemala
was accompanied by a six percent
declinc in Guatemalan per capita
meat consumtion."
For those who find such statis
tics disturbing and would like to
know how such an inhumane and
unjust system can be sustained, a
reading of Agee's book is a good

had changed: "The Alliance for
Progress has been, in effect, a sub
sidy program for U.S. exporters
and private investors. For the Un
ited States this has meant a return
to private investors of about five
dollars for every dollar sent from
the U.S. to Latin Amrica during
the period, plus a favorable trade
balance, plus billions of dollars in
loans that are earning interest and
will someday be repaid. In other
words Latin America through the
Alliance for Progress has contri
buted to the economic develop
ment of the United States and has

gone into debt to do it."
Unlike many of the current CIA
critics who want the agency
"clea\ed up," Agee recognizes
that it is not the CIA, but the
economic system of which it is a
small part, which must be re
formed.
Oppressive capitalism
"Reforms qf the FBI and CIA,
even the removal of the President
from office, cannot remove the
problem. American capitalism,
based as it is on exploitation of the
poor, with its fundamental moti
vation in personal greed, simply
cannot survive without force —
without a secret police force. The
argument is with capitalism and it
is captalism that must be opposed,
with its CIA, FBI and other sec
urity agencies understood as logi
cal, necessary manifestations of a
ruling class's determination to re
tain power and privilege," he ar
gues.
According to the U.N. economic
commission, the poorest 20 per
cent of the population in Latin
America receives three percent of
the total income, the poorest half
of the population receives only 13
percent the richest five percent re
ceives 33 percent.
Paul and ArtneEhrlich point out
in The End of Affluence that "in
the late 1960s fish exported to de
veloped countries by Peru alone
would have been enough to make
up the protein deficit of all Latin
Americans. Poor nations all too
often export food that is needed at
home in a world where money,
not need, determines interna
tional flows of goods. For exam
ple, a recent 40 percent rise in
meat production in Guatemala
was accompanied by a six percent
declinc in Guatemalan per capita
meat consumtion."
For those who find such statis
tics disturbing and would like to
know how such an inhumane and
unjust system can be sustained, a
reading of Agee's book is a good

Inside the Company: CIA
Diary, by Philip A gee.
I started out to do my duty,
ended up just doing time.
What is it about you,
that makes so many change their
minds.
You had me on your honor roil,
for your dream I would die;
now I would not even cross the
street
to help you live a lie.
-from "Changes" by Harry
Chap in
Recruited off the Notre Dame
campus in 1956, Philip Agee
spent the 1960s as a CIA agent in
Latin America, first in Ecuador,
then in Uruguay and finally as a
"U.S. embassy attache" for the
1968 Olympic games in Mexico
City.
He went into the CIA with all
the idealism and enthusiasm that
often characterizes bright young
men fresh out of college. He res

igned in 1969 after coming to the
realization that "I became the ser
vant of the capitalism I rejected. I
became one of its secret police
men.
"The CIA, after all, is nothing
more than the secret police of
American capitalism, plugging
up leaks in the political dam night
and day so that the shareholders of
U.S. companies operating in poor
countries can continue enjoying
the rip-off," he noted.
From spy to activist
In the book, Agee reconstructs,
in the form of a diary, his 12-year
career, tracing his evolution from
a dedicated CIA "case officer" to
socialist revolutionary.
The book is long (598 pages)
and at times too detailed for the
casual reader, but as the only book
ever written about a former agent
without the approval of CIA cen
sors, it is worth the effort.
Part of the difficulty stems from
Agee's decision to disclose the
identities of as many CIA person
nel (both American and foreign),

operations and code names as
memory would allow. In so doing
he has made the book, in addition
to being simply a chronicle of life
in the CIA, a political document,
in the sense of Daniel Ellsberg's
"Pentagon Papers," for it shows
that the official description of the
CIA in Washington and the actual
practices of the CIA in Latin
America bear little resemblance to
each other.
Congressional coverup
In Washington, the official line
is that the purpose of the CIA is to
protect democracy and freedom
around the world, though in re
cent months certain "excesses"
(e.g., domestic spying, mail cov
ers, murder, Mafia connections)
have been admitted and are cur
rently being "corrected" by Con
gressional investigations.
The reality in Latin America is
that "CIA operations constitute
the usually unseen efforts to shore
up unjust, unpopular, minority
governments, always with the
hope that overt military interven

tion (as in Vietnam and the
Dominican Republic) will not be
necessary. The interests of the
privileged minorities in poor
countries lead back to, and are
identified with, the interests of the
rich and powrful who control the
U.S."
'Alliance': myth
At the beginning of his career,
Agee believed the official prop
aganda concerning thebenevolent
role which the United States is re
ported to play in Latin America.
The famous Alliance for Progress
aided economic growth in under
developed countries, raising the
living standard of the lower clas
ses, who (everyone admits) live in
deplorable conditions.
After a decade in Latin America,
