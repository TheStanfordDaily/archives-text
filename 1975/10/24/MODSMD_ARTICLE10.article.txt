# Enact strong gun control laws
## 
### 
I have had enough.
Since 1963, I have seen one
President killed, one candidate
killed, another crippled — all by
guns. And within the last six
weeks, another President has
twice narrowly escaped death by
gunshot.
Even more staggering, since
1963 there have been thousands
of gunshot homicides and hun
dreds of accidental deaths by
gunshot —the victims ordinary
Americans like you and me.
In the face of such gross waste
of human life, I am sickened
when 1 hear about the "Constitu
tional right to bear arms." As I
read the Second Amendment, it
permits states the right to form

militias; this was necessary to
allay public fears that national
defense measures would be in
sufficient.
I am even more sickened to
hear the "guns don't kill people,
people kill people." This super
ficial argument ignores the fact
that killers almost always need
tools — and by far the most
popular aid to murder is the gun.
What 1 propose is drastic: after
a reasonable grace period has
expired, private possession of a
gun by anyone other than a
bonded guard, policeman, etc.,
ought to be a felony. Similarly
prohibited would be possession
of ammunition.
Importation and manufacture
of guns and ammunition ought
to be supervised onlyslightlyless
closely than uranium processing
operations are today.
I do make two concessions. I
am open to proposals allowing
gun collectors to keep their anti
que guns.
Furthermore, for the benefit of
those who simply must prove
their virility by shooting targets
or animals, 1 reluctantly endorse
the availability of targets or ani
mals guns and ammunition in
specified target or hunting areas.
I hasten to add that
security procedures in such de
signated gun rental areas would
have to be truly draconian — to
prevent theft and to prevent
unfit individuals from renting
guns.
Gun-lovers will protest that
my proposal penalizes the law

abiding citizen and helps the
criminal ("who will always be
able to get guns"). I disagree.
Just think of the number of
robberies, assaults and other
crimes which could be nipped in
the bud because would-be per
petrators often carry guns as a
matter of course. I don't believe
it is excessive to say that gun
control might prove to be more
valuable to law enforcement ef
forts than income tax laws in
curbing organized crime.
But even if my predictions are
not borne out, I fail to see how
the present state of affairs is but a
nightmare for law abiding citi
zens. Compare, for example, the
miniscule number of crimes
foiled by gun-toting citizens
with the staggering number of
crimes of passions committed
with guns by otherwise law
abiding citizens who have guns
— or with the number of gun ac
cidents.
It is pathetic and disgusting
that the pro-gun lobby has pic
tured opponents as somehow
less patriotic. It should no longer
be allowed to get a way with this.
The flag within which the
NRA wraps itself so proudly is

saturated with the blood of
Americans who have been killed
or maimed by gunshot. Perhaps
in frontier days guns were
necessary in this country, but no
more.
The good of the country de
mands that strong gun control
measures be enacted now.
