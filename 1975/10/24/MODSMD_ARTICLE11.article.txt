I find it very surprising that
Bill Evers (Daily. Oct. 23). who
apparently has given the matter
much thought, would fail to see
a major difference between
Thompson's violinist attached
to one's circulatory system and a
fetus attached to a woman's
uterus.
The person with the violinist
using his kidneys had no choice
in the matter. But in the vast ma
jority of pregnancies, the woman
made the choice to have sexual
intercourse.
Implicit in this choice is the
knowledge that the action could
lead to pregnancy. As 1 see it.
these pregnancies are cases of
implied consent, a very popular
concept lately.
Many of our problems today
stem from people who fail to ac
cept the consequences of their
actions or who try to change the
rules in a situation they previ
ously agreed to. On campus we
can see this in students who vio
late the honor code, take food
from the food service or default
on loans. Most cases of abortion
are extensions of this syndrome.
Perhaps more alarming is
Evers' seeming callousness to
wards life. Most argument in the
abortion controversy centers
around whether the fetus is life
or not. Given that the fetus is a
life, Evers advocates the taking
of those lives.
1 am not advocating irrespon
sible propagation, but only that
we protect and enhance life once
it exists. After all, isn't this
world meant to ensure that as
many as possible share in the
good life we are capable of
achieving?
