## Financial aid plan sparks debate 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
It wasn't on the agenda, but a dialogue on
minority financial aid, between ASSU Vice
President Josie Jaramillo and Dean of Admis
sions Fred A. Hargadon, highlighted last
week's Faculty Senate meeting.
The impromptu debate centered on the an
nual report of the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial Aids
(CUAFA) presented earlier in the meeting by
committee ex-chairman Prof. Paul B. Green.
That report, summarizing CUAFA's work all
last year, contains a detailed explanation of
this fall's new financial aid arrangements for
Stanford undergraduates, particularly
minorities. It provides for a very-low-income
(VLI) category in which all students from
families below a certain income level are
placed, regardless of race.
Those in the VLI bracket receive a more
favorable aid package.
Previously, minority financial aid at Stan
ford gave all minority students with need, re
gardless of income background, the same aid
package, providing for no self-help (job or
loan) the first year and reduced amounts in the
following years.
Something for everyone?
The final plan, however, was a compromise
which "retained the preference concept (for
minorities) but also resulted in increased
minority self-help and in self-help for all stu
dents in all years of attendance," according to
the report.
Jaramillo, not a Senate member, spoke after
being yielded to, with the Senate's permission,
by ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum. She ar
gued against the VI,I plan for the reason that"a
necessity for increased self-help would de
crease the minority population at Stanford."
And therein was where Hargadon disagreed,
claiming that "the schools to which we lose
minority students require much larger jobs and
loans." Admissions figures for this and last

year's freshman class show an almost 12
percent increase in admitted blacks choosing
to come to Stanford, and a three percent drop in
admitted chicanos choosing Stanford, he said.
Sacrifice to attend
"The yield is bound to vary from year to
year," he said. "Students make their choice
based on the school they would most like to
attend, even if there are sacrifices involved."
Jaramillo, on the other hand, noted that the
income level of Stanford minorities is increas

ing in relation to that of minorities nationwide.
She also questioned Hargadon's minority re
cruiting policies.
On financial aid, Jaramillo stated "the
report's assertion that all must bend, however
much or little, to adapt to (Stanford's) in
stitutionalized culture is completely opposite
to the University's proclaimed commitment to
diversity among its students.
Ghetto education
"The education given in most barrio, reser
vation, and ghetto schools requires that most
minority students need extra time to study to
compete in rigorous schools as Stanford," she
said.
Hargadon, though, described the former
plan as one in which a relatively high income
black on financial aid would, solely on the
basis of color, have no job the first year, while a
lower income white would, solely on the basis
of color, have to take such a job.
"That struck me as unfair," said Hargadon.
The gist of the change in financial aid policy
can be summed up by Green's statement and
continual restatement that "the emphasis has
shifted to looking at the needs of paticular in
dividuals, instead of basing financial aid deci
sions on assumed mean properties of groups."

Something for everyone?
The final plan, however, was a compromise
which "retained the preference concept (for
minorities) but also resulted in increased
minority self-help and in self-help for all stu
dents in all years of attendance," according to
the report.
Jaramillo, not a Senate member, spoke after
being yielded to, with the Senate's permission,
by ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum. She ar
gued against the VI,I plan for the reason that"a
necessity for increased self-help would de
crease the minority population at Stanford."
And therein was where Hargadon disagreed,
claiming that "the schools to which we lose
minority students require much larger jobs and
loans." Admissions figures for this and last

year's freshman class show an almost 12
percent increase in admitted blacks choosing
to come to Stanford, and a three percent drop in
admitted chicanos choosing Stanford, he said.
Sacrifice to attend
"The yield is bound to vary from year to
year," he said. "Students make their choice
based on the school they would most like to
attend, even if there are sacrifices involved."
Jaramillo, on the other hand, noted that the
income level of Stanford minorities is increas

ing in relation to that of minorities nationwide.
She also questioned Hargadon's minority re
cruiting policies.
On financial aid, Jaramillo stated "the
report's assertion that all must bend, however
much or little, to adapt to (Stanford's) in
stitutionalized culture is completely opposite
to the University's proclaimed commitment to
diversity among its students.
Ghetto education
"The education given in most barrio, reser
vation, and ghetto schools requires that most
minority students need extra time to study to
compete in rigorous schools as Stanford," she
said.
Hargadon, though, described the former
plan as one in which a relatively high income
black on financial aid would, solely on the
basis of color, have no job the first year, while a
lower income white would, solely on the basis
of color, have to take such a job.
"That struck me as unfair," said Hargadon.
The gist of the change in financial aid policy
can be summed up by Green's statement and
continual restatement that "the emphasis has
shifted to looking at the needs of paticular in
dividuals, instead of basing financial aid deci
sions on assumed mean properties of groups."

It wasn't on the agenda, but a dialogue on
minority financial aid, between ASSU Vice
President Josie Jaramillo and Dean of Admis
sions Fred A. Hargadon, highlighted last
week's Faculty Senate meeting.
The impromptu debate centered on the an
nual report of the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial Aids
(CUAFA) presented earlier in the meeting by
committee ex-chairman Prof. Paul B. Green.
That report, summarizing CUAFA's work all
last year, contains a detailed explanation of
this fall's new financial aid arrangements for
Stanford undergraduates, particularly
minorities. It provides for a very-low-income
(VLI) category in which all students from
families below a certain income level are
placed, regardless of race.
Those in the VLI bracket receive a more
favorable aid package.
Previously, minority financial aid at Stan
ford gave all minority students with need, re
gardless of income background, the same aid
package, providing for no self-help (job or
loan) the first year and reduced amounts in the
following years.
