# Seniors fight to choose graduation speaker
## 
### BECKY TROUNSON 
Woody Allen won more votes than Mickey
Mouse in the senior class commencement
speaker poll, but the administration probably
doesn't care. Administrators apparently
wouldn't want either to speak because they
don't consider commencement a laughing
matter.
It therefore seems likely that administration
opposition will prevent the seniors from invit
ing Allen to speak at next June's commence
ment — much to the dismay of the class offic
ers.
"Commencement is in honor of the gradua
tion of the seniors and graduate students and
the person who addresses them as a group for
the last time should be their choice," Senior
Class President Walt Spevak declared in frust
ration on Wednesday after another round of
unfruitful talks with administrators.
Despite half-serious predictions by some op
ponents of a senior poll that Mickey Mouse and
topless dancer Carol Doda would garner strong
support, Mickey Mouse was mentioned only

once in the poll and Doda won no votes,
Spevak pointed out.
It is not a comedy
"We believe that Stanford students are keep
ing things in perspective," he said. "President
Lyman has made it clear to us that commence
ment is not a joke and not a 30-minute comedy
spot. I trust the good judgment and sincerity of
myfellow students and 1 think that when they
get down to voting, they will do it seriously."
Senior class officers say they hope the vot
ing, in which seniors and graduate students
will state their choice for commencement
speaker, will be held soon.
But the officers said it would "limit the
students' input if we had an election now, be
fore the administration and faculty have sub
mitted names of possible choices."
"The administration and faculty are drag
ging their tails and are waiting for everyone
else to get going," Spevak said. "What's
bothering them right now is the prospect of
having an entertainment figure — Woody
Allen — as commencement speaker."

Spevak said he*is "critical of the administra
tion because it axed him without knowing
much about the man. He may have something
worthwhile to say."
But administrators contend that a choice
who pleases only the students is not enough.
William Stone, assistant to the president,
says that the commencement speaker should
appeal to everyone — students, faculty, ad
ministrators and parents.
Administrators insist that, in keeping with
their contentions, they have approached Uni
versity fellows, the Senate, Campus Report
editors and graduate students in an effort to
gather many opinions on whom should be
invited to speak.
To avoid controversy
University administrators also say they hope
to solicit enough opinion to avoid the type of
controversy that occurred last year after the
selection of Harvard Prof. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as speaker.
Moynihan was castigated by blacks for hav
ing urged President Nixon to adopt a policy of

"benign neglect" toward blacks. And many
other students considered Moynihan just plain
boring.
About 175 students left their seats at com
mencement last June when Moynihan rose to
speak.
The administration was criticized for
replacing departmental ceremonies with one
large gathering of all graduates in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Spevak said the officers are trying to per
suade the administration to return to the old
system of having departmental ceremonies.
"In our poll, there were 99 votes to switch
back to departmental ceremonies and only 22
voted to keep it the way it was last year,"
Spevak noted.
The main controversy, however, revolves
around the selection of the commencement
speaker. But after all the turmoil, seniors might
not feel much like laughing even if Allen were
allowed to deliver the commencement ad
dress.


FAREWELL — Controversial commencement speaker Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Presi

speaker, will be held soon.
But the officers said it would "limit the
students' input if we had an election now, be
fore the administration and faculty have sub
mitted names of possible choices."
"The administration and faculty are drag
ging their tails and are waiting for everyone
else to get going," Spevak said. "What's
bothering them right now is the prospect of
having an entertainment figure — Woody
Allen — as commencement speaker."

Spevak said he*is "critical of the administra
tion because it axed him without knowing
much about the man. He may have something
worthwhile to say."
But administrators contend that a choice
who pleases only the students is not enough.
William Stone, assistant to the president,
says that the commencement speaker should
appeal to everyone — students, faculty, ad
ministrators and parents.
Administrators insist that, in keeping with
their contentions, they have approached Uni
versity fellows, the Senate, Campus Report
editors and graduate students in an effort to
gather many opinions on whom should be
invited to speak.
To avoid controversy
University administrators also say they hope
to solicit enough opinion to avoid the type of
controversy that occurred last year after the
selection of Harvard Prof. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan as speaker.
Moynihan was castigated by blacks for hav
ing urged President Nixon to adopt a policy of

"benign neglect" toward blacks. And many
other students considered Moynihan just plain
boring.
About 175 students left their seats at com
mencement last June when Moynihan rose to
speak.
The administration was criticized for
replacing departmental ceremonies with one
large gathering of all graduates in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Spevak said the officers are trying to per
suade the administration to return to the old
system of having departmental ceremonies.
"In our poll, there were 99 votes to switch
back to departmental ceremonies and only 22
voted to keep it the way it was last year,"
Spevak noted.
The main controversy, however, revolves
around the selection of the commencement
speaker. But after all the turmoil, seniors might
not feel much like laughing even if Allen were
allowed to deliver the commencement ad
dress.


FAREWELL — Controversial commencement speaker Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Presi
dent Richard Lyman join in a chorus during last June's commencement exercises. If this year's
senior class officers have their way, Lyman will be joined by a speaker of the senior class' own
choosing.
Woody Allen won more votes than Mickey
Mouse in the senior class commencement
speaker poll, but the administration probably
doesn't care. Administrators apparently
wouldn't want either to speak because they
don't consider commencement a laughing
matter.
It therefore seems likely that administration
opposition will prevent the seniors from invit
ing Allen to speak at next June's commence
ment — much to the dismay of the class offic
ers.
"Commencement is in honor of the gradua
tion of the seniors and graduate students and
the person who addresses them as a group for
the last time should be their choice," Senior
Class President Walt Spevak declared in frust
ration on Wednesday after another round of
unfruitful talks with administrators.
Despite half-serious predictions by some op
ponents of a senior poll that Mickey Mouse and
topless dancer Carol Doda would garner strong
support, Mickey Mouse was mentioned only

once in the poll and Doda won no votes,
Spevak pointed out.
It is not a comedy
"We believe that Stanford students are keep
ing things in perspective," he said. "President
Lyman has made it clear to us that commence
ment is not a joke and not a 30-minute comedy
spot. I trust the good judgment and sincerity of
myfellow students and 1 think that when they
get down to voting, they will do it seriously."
Senior class officers say they hope the vot
ing, in which seniors and graduate students
will state their choice for commencement
speaker, will be held soon.
But the officers said it would "limit the
