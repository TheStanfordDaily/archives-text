## Just $540 will buy... a lot more than Stanford tuition 
### LYN CARLSON 
It has been over three weeks
since your writing hand under
went premature rigor mortis and
jerkily scrawled that check at re
gistration. Undoubtedly some
time since you have emitted the
cry, "They should be paying me
$6000 a year for this."
Take heart in this fact — these
first three weeks alone have cost
you about $540 (tuition in
room and board plan A). And
take heart also in the following
— what you could be doing with
$540 besides investing in L.
Stanford Co., Inc.:
For $540 you could be spend
ing eight days in a top-priced
single at the Fairmont Hotel on
Nob Hill — trying to avoid gawk
ing like a tourist at the lobby's
Florentine mirrors and crimson

furnishings, sipping a drink in
the revolving cocktail lounge
and devising ingenious methods
of stealing the towels.
For $540 you could be biking
around campus on a brand-new
Raleigh International — with
Campognolo parts flashing in
the sun, Reynold's 531 double
butted frame whistling in the
wind and those bikers on
clunker three-speed pumping
furiously out of your way.
(Incidentally, $540 includes
insurance, locks, cables, etc.,
which clunker three-speeds
don't have to worry about.)
For $540 you could be touring
the countryside to peer at the
local urchins every afternoon for
six days in the chauffeured Mer
cedes Benz.
( —"Oh Reginald, stop the

car: Just look at them!
Aren't they quaint in those 'S'
t-shirts? Some peasant symbol, I
presume . . . 'Stanford Stu
dents,' you call them? How
charmingly bourgeoisie! Drive
on.")
For $540 you could be sipping
a half-bottle of "Tokai Assen
cia" wine, vintage 1887 — eye
ing the color quizzically, utter
ing knowing remarks about the
bouquet, reverently fingering
the bottle. The price is estimated
because this year's auction
hasn't been held yet prices
are listed in fluctuating English
pounds.
Hopefully you would have

some money left to buy a special
wine glass, instead of having to
use a dixie cup (which tends to
spoil the effect).
For $540 you could be flying
to romantic Paris — secretly
humming "Gigi," pretending to
read the French newspaper in
the seat pocket and chatting with
that charming person who owns
a chateau in Normandy. But
don't tell the charming person
that you're on one of those low
cost student travel plans.
There's yet another way of
looking at it. That $540 would
have paid for your entire educa
tion at the state university back
home.

A TOUGH DECISION — The past several weeks at Stanford have cost students about $540 in
tuition. But there are other ways to spend that rather hefty sum — such as renting a Mercedes Benz
for six days and gazing with wonder at all the local urchins while the chauffeur wisks the
car through the countryside.
