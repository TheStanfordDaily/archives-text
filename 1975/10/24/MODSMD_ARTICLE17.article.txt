## USF suffers strike 
### KATHY BATTS 
Strike-ridden University of San Francisco has suffered a break
down in major services this week, in a dispute similar to the 1974
United Stanford Employees strike here.
Problems center around a wage dispute between university en
gineers and the USP" administration, according to Charles Souby, a
campus radio KUSF staffer.
The 13 engineers are employed in maintenance-related jobs on
the campus, Souby told the Daily. However, their bargaining
power has been strengthened by a sympathy walkout of nearly 150
other AFL-CIO-affiliated university employees, including clerks,
typists, secretaries, food service personnel and housekeepers.
Strikers, who are now paid $6.38 an hour, are asking for a wage
comparable to other maintenance workers in San Francisco, which
is $8.25 per hour. The university is only willing to pay a wage
comparable to what other university maintenance workers on the
West Coast are paid — $6.38 an hour.
Heat and hot water have been curtailed in two dormitories and
completely cut off in the third, causing some students to go else
where to shower and use the toilets, Souby said.
With students and administrative personnel pitching in as scab
labor, the campus food service has continued to operate, although
on an irregular schedule.
Law school students called a boycott of classes Wednesday in
support of the strikes, while undergraduates held a rally to air their
gripes about the dispute. No other classes have been cancelled as
yet.
"No one except the law students is taking sides," Souby said.
"There's just a general feeling of resentment because we're the ones
who are suffering."
Souby estimated that most law students — nearly 80 percent —
live off campus. A majority of undergraduates live in the three
on-campus residence halls.
University officials have announced that negotiations with the
strikers will resume today.
