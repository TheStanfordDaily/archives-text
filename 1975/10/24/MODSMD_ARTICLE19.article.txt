# Debate team comes out on top

### CHERYL ESCHBACH 
Led by freshman Tom Newell
and junior Mark Schallert, the
Stanford Debate Team took first
place in a tournament at Cal
State-Sacramento last weekend.
Junior Laurie Sherman, also
representing the Stanford squad,
took fourth place in oral in
terpretation.
"By winning this tournament,
we clearly established ourselves
as one of the top teams in the
Western U. 5.," said Debate Soci
ety Director Bradley Ziff.
However, the success of this
year's squad in future tourna-
I

ments "depends very highly on
the amount of financial support
we receive," said Ziff.
Limited resources
Ziff said he hopes that the
team will be able to compete
with major universities in other
parts of the U.S. Yet as the situa
tion stands, limited resources
could curtail their competition
to a local level.
"It's almost like forcing the
football team to play San Jose
State every week-end," he com
mented.
Indeed, the debate teams of the
past several years have been

doing just that.
"Although we've had some
good debaters, our budget re
stricted our competition to local
tournaments," said debate team
president John Roos.
Funded by the ASSU and
coached by students from the
law school for the past two
years, debate has been mainly an
extra-curricular activity offered
as an undergraduate special.
Undergraduate special
This year, debate is again an
undergraduate special, taught
by Ziff and three assistants.
None of them are paid.

But status as an undergraduate
special does not guarantee the
team the financial support it
needs for competition on a na
tional level. This year the team
was given about $1500 from the
ASSU budget, Ziff said. The de
baters also received additional
financial supprot from the pro
vost, he added.
"In comparison." Ziff said,
"schools like Harvard, Dart
mouth, Berkeley, USC and
UCLA all have debate budgets
anywhere between five to 20
times ours."
