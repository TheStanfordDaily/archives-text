# Bio advance may prevent rejected organ transplants

Scientists are discovering the intri
cate mechanisms by which the body's
immunization system cells perceive a
foreign substance and attempt to de
stroy it, Nobel Laureate Gerald M.
Edelman said yesterday.
Edelman, 1972 Nobel Prize winner
in medical physiology, sketched his
theory of this process in the third an
nual Linus Pauling Lecture. The lec
ture was established in Pauling's
honor by friends and colleagues to
publicize advances in molecular biol
ogy related to Pauling's work.
The practical benefit of discovering
these mechanisms might eventually be
the development of drugs which
would keep the human body from re
jecting transplanted organs by block
ing its immune response.
Edelman prefaced his theory by say
ing, "In the Pauling tradition, I don't
want to hold myself back in proposing
a model."
According to Edelman, white blood
cells, a primary immunelogical
weapon of the body, attack toxins with
the antibody immunoglobulin. Earlier
researchers, Edelman said, had found
that immunoglobulin attacks the toxin
by gathering itself into microscopic
caps on the surface of the cell.
Edelman discovered that certain
"canavinal A" could inhibit formation
of these antibody caps. But at the same

time, the cells would try to fight off the
invader by dividing, on the principle
of "strength in numbers."
Molecules like concanavanal set oft
this internal reaction from outside the
cell when they are sensed by receptors.
But, Edelman explained, other sub
stances can actually penetrate thecell
membrane and block chemical mes
sages from within the cell. These
chemicals block antibodies from form
ing while also preventing cells from
dividing. Thus, these chemicals can
completely block the immune reaction
of white blood cells.
However, Hugh McDevitt, professor

of immunology, said this prospect is
still off in the future.
"I don't think anybody is at the point
of trying to control the individual
cell's response."
Scientists are still arguing over the
mechanism of the immune response,
McDevitt explained.
Edelman, a professor at Rockefeller
University, was awarded the Nobel
prize for describing the form and func
tion of a tremendously complex anti
body, one that fights off a type of
human cancer.
