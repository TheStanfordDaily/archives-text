## Injured Cougars look tough 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The voice on the other end of a
very expensive long distance
telephone call to Pullman,
Washington sounded worried.
"With all that mutiny stuff going
on down there, Stanford will be
up for the game," sighed
Washington State Athletic Di
rector Ray Nagel. "Can't you
hold off until next week?"
The Cards aren't planning to
follow Nagel's advice, but it isn't
because of this week's excite
ment. "The only people con
cerned about that mutiny stuff
are the newspaper people," exp
lained wide receiver Ray Ander
son.
"We'll be ready, but only be
cause Washington State is a
good team, not because of all that
media bullshit." A lot of Stan
ford fans may have gotten too ab
sorbed in this week's headlines
to even know who the Cards are
playing.
Well, it's Washington State
University and they aren't one of
the Pacific Eight's "Northwest
Nothings."
Two wins
The Cougars, 2-4, lost to UCLA
37-23 last week, but they opened
the season with wins over Kan
sas and Utah. But WSU has al

ways given Stanford a scare.
They even lead the series
16-14-1. Last year the Cards es
caped the "Curse of the
Palouse," as they held on for a
20-18 win.
And Coach )im Sweeney must
have been thinking about the
Stanford defense when he instal
led the veer offense, a formation
which has haunted the Cards for
the last two years. "Washington
State runs the veer offense and
passes off it, like UCLA," said
Coach Jack Christiansen. "We'll
have to handle our assignments
and avoid making mistakes."
Ripped off
After losing that 37-23 game to
UCLA last Saturday, Sweeney
returned to his office to find that
his color television set had been
stolen. It's been that bad a year
for the Cougars injury-wise, too.
WSU will be using its third
quarterback tomorrow. They lost
quarterback Wally Bennett to a
knee injury in the season opener
to Kansas and quarterback John
Hopkins suffered a cracked rib
on the second play of the UCLA
game. Sophomore Jack Thomp
son came in to complete 16 of 34
passes for 218 yards and two
touchdowns against the Bruins
and he didn't suffer an intercep

tion.
But there's good news. The
Cougars will welcome back tail
back Dan Doornink tomorrow.
Doornink, who has missed three
games with a broken rib, was the
Cougar's leading rusher with
275 yards on 57 carries for a 4.82
average, before his injury.
Fullback Vaughn Williams led
WSU with 89 yards and a touch
down last week. "Some of his
yards were gained BYOB," said
Sweeney, "Bring Your Own
Blocking."
Washington State will bring a
very good football team to the

Farm this week, but the attention
of most fans will be on quarter
back Mike Cordova and Coach
Chris.
Cordova will have his hands
full with the "Electric Com
pany," the Cougars' defensive
secondary. The Company has al
lowed just 123.8 yards passing
per game, and it ranks third in
conference passing defense.
Last week Cordova ran into
Washington's pass defense,
13th-ranked in the nation, and
came away with just 65 yards.
"Washington was beating the
hell out of our receivers," exp
lained Christiansen. "It was a
cold day and he wasn't throwing
very well."

against the Cougars if his mild toe injury can heal.
