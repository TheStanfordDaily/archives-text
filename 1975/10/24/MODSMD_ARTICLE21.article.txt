SEATTLE—A reluctant au
thority has finally broken his sil
ence on the Stanford quarterback
issue.
"No, I don't think Mike's play
ing as well as he could," con
fided 16-year-old Tim Cordova
after watching his brother com
plete 8 of 26 passes in his
hometown last Saturday. "But I
think he's doing a really good job
and I know he's the best."
Cordova was harder on the
Stanford fans, who have been
occasionally raucous in their
verbal abuse of his brother. "I
think the booing has been get
ting to Mike," Tim declared.
"You just don't want to get out
there and play your best if the
fans aren't behind you."
But while he's not likely to
take over for the Chronicle's
Glenn Dickey, the high-school
sophomore doesn't figure to re
place his brother right away.
While official statistics weren't
available, he looks at least six in
ches shorter than Big Mike. And
he doesn't hesitate to announce
his football position:
"Linebacker."
