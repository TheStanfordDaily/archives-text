# Pac-8 predictions
## Cards will romp 
### 
Last week, our forecaster got all four games
right. You could look it up. But then it was
only north vs. south. This week's mish-mash
of games makes improving on our
forecaster's .800 percentage (12 of 15) almost
impossible. Oh well.
Unless Christiansen's Cardinal charges
decide to take up arms in rebellion before
tomorrow's Cougar shoot, Stanford should
coast to an easy win.
Win Jess Washington State (0-3 in Pacific-
Eight play) should be no match for the Cards.
In fact, the only excitement at Stanford
Stadium tomorrow should be listening to the
cheering section and the band voice opin
ions on the quarterback problem.

UCLA should just barely edge California.
Cal Coach Mike White calls running back
Chuck Muncie "the top back in the country,"
but wait until he meets a real defense.
The Trojans are going to continue their
unbeaten string with a victory over Notre
Dame. Stanford Head BasketbaJJ Coach Dick
Dißiaso (last year of Notre Dame) won't be
happy to watch the Irish blow their chance to
get revenge of last year's USC upset.
