# Harshbarger propels women swimmers
## 
### ELLEN SOFIO 
Anyone straying in the vicin
ity of deCuerre Pool during the
early morning or waning after
noon hours this quarter will be
treated to a panoramic view as a
milieu of fluttering feet and
churning arms lap the water.
From the height of the
bleachers the spectacle is a diz
zying blur of activity, but if you
look carefully you may be able to
single out a bright yellow cap
being propelled vigorously back
and forth along one of the
crowded 25 meter lanes.
The energy behind this speedy
grace is that of Jo Harshbarger, a
1972 Olympic finalist who is one
of eight women athletes receiv
ing full or partial Stanford scho
larships this year. A freshman, jo
will be adding her own special
lustre to already sparkling pros
pects for Stanford in NCAA
competition this season.
Like most top-notch swim
mers, Jo started at an early age.
She was five when she began
competing for Bellvue's Lake
Washington Swim Club in AAU

meets, but not until she was 13
did she set her sites on the
big time.
Out of blue
Jo was a virtual unknown who
burst out of nowhere to an upset
victory at the 1972 nationals in
Dallas where she shattered the
old national record in the 1650
free-style with a time of 16.58. It
was this meet that raised her
confidence and her ambitions
for the literal long pull ahead.
Recalling her Olympic experi
ence of 1972, Jo emphasized her
enjoyment of the social aspects.
"The most exciting part was the
opportunity to meet people,
aside from the actual swim
ming."
Asserting that "the trials were
more pressure than the Olym
pics themselves," she sees the
tension of the trials as a result of
the fact that "only the top three
can go and anybody in the top
eight could do it," a fact of life
with swimming competition as
intense as it is in the U.S.
Jo's sixth in the 800 at Munich
came as a surprise since she was

first seeded, having rewritten
the world record in the event
with a time of 8.53.83 at the tri
als, so her name will bear espe
cially close watching in the 1976
long-course events.
Jo is up against several well
established contenders in U.S.
women's swimming in her cur
rent bid for the top. including
Shirley Baboshoff of Mission
Viejo and Heather Creenwood, a
USC sophomore who edged by
her in the 1500 meter free this
summer.
Several of her Cardinal team
mates are also nationally ranked.
Senior Vicki Hays, Anne Brodell
and Anne Coffey are three other
recipients of athletic scholar
ships this year.
Moving up
Jim Caughran, coach for both
the men's and women's teams,
describes his squad this fall as
"an exciting and dynamic team
to be on." Saying he looks for
ward to moving up in the na
tional ranks this year, Caughran
cites the team's outstanding
1974-75 peformance as an incen

tive and a challenge for the sea
son ahead.
The Cards placed eighth in the
nationals last March. Perhaps it
was this sparkling record which
drew an enthusiastic crowd of 80
out for early practices last week,
but Gaughran anticipates that
"the intensity of training will cut
some out" and hopes to get
down to 20 or 30 swimmers.
NCAA rules currently limit
each college to a maximum of 18
competitors in travelling meets,
but Gaughran explained that
"the qualifying standards are so
tough, we usually don't have to
leave anybody home who qual
ifies."
Get out
Harshbarger and her coach ag
reed that recent attention to fi
nancial equity for women ath
letes should begin to meet a seri
ous need.. Citing the common
tendency "for most women
swimmers to get out right after
high school due to low-key col
lege programs," Gaughran
foresees a new and more com
petitive era for women's athle
tics and predicts that "many may
find out their real peak in
swimming isn't between 13 and
15 but closer in range to 18 to
21."
Admitting to a little soreness
from the recently-begun strenu

ous workout schedule, Jo exp
lains that although she's con
sidered taking spring quarter off
for intensive training, she dis
likes the tension and strain of
concentrating exclusively on her
swimmming.
"All 1 think about is how 1 did
in morning practice. It's good to
have distraction even ifit s dumb
homework," she says. And with
a rigorous schedule of two hours
swimming and one hour of dry
land work per day. Jo under
standably finds "no time to
waste."
This fall and wintershe will be
swimming primarily freestyle
long course events: the 200, 500
and 1650 meters, although she
may also be entered in some re
lays or butterfly events.
Academically her current am
bitions are still in the formative
stages, but she claims she is "de
finitely not into the engineering
pre-med route" and finds her in
terests tend more towards the
social sciences.
In any case, Jo's immediate
goals are much more pressing, as
she must face not only a formid
able array of U.S. contenders, but
also a rapidly improving East
German women's team as she
primes herself for a second
Olympic try, this time in
Montreal.

IN THE WAY — Stanford's John 'J.P." Roberts sticks his hand
