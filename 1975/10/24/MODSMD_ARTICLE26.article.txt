Borbon will replace Franco soon
MADRlD—Doctors issued a medical bulletin last night
saying that 82-year-old Gen. Francisco Franco suffered a
relapse following a heart attack Tuesday.
The statement opened the way for a constitutional trans
fer of power to the generalissimo's designated heir,
37-year-old Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon. The cabinet was
expected to start the transfer in motion when it meets
today.
A spokesman at the palace said Franco was "recover
ing." He said reports that the head of state was in a coma
were "lies," but did not directly repudiate the doctors'
declaration.
Some foreign diplomatic sources said it was their opin
ion Franco was not critically ill, but that his illness had
been exaggerated in a political move to oust him.
Spain gives Sahara to Morocco
MARKAKECH, Morocco—Spain has reached a tentative
understanding with Morocco for the peaceful handover of
sovereignty in disputed Spanish Sahara, Moroccan
sources said late yesterday.
The sources said King Hassan II of Morocco will not call
oft his proposed march of 350,000 unarmed Moroccans
into the territory, but it was agreed that only a "symbolic
contingent" would go all the way to El Aaiun, the Spanish
Sahara capital.
Tens of thousands of Moroccans continued to move in
trains, trucks and buses toward the assembly point at
Tarfaya, on the Spanish Sahara border, for the "March of
Conquest."
The sources said Moroccan Foreign Minister Ahmed
Laaki was due to fly to Madrid Friday or Saturday to
complete the negotiations, and only the possible death of
Spanish chief of state Francisco Franco could upset the
timetable for the handover of the Spanish colony.
Italian poet receives Nobel prize
STOCKHOLM—Eugenio Montale, Italy's grand old
poet of nature, love and solitude was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Literature yesterday by a sharply divided
Swedish Academy of Letters.
The 79-year old Montale, often a candidate and said to
be the choice of older members of the academy, won over
60-year-old U.S. novelist Saul Bellow, the most serious

contender, informed sources said.
Bellow, vacationing in Israel, said: "It's very nice that
Eugenio Montale won the Nobel prize. I'm not disap
pointed. There's plenty of time to win it yet."
Turkey's leftist peasant-novelist Yasar Kemal and Doris
Lessing, a British writer born in Iran, also were said to
have been in the running.
Psychiatrist will treat Hearst
SAN FRANClSCO—Responding to pleas from Patricia
Hearst's attorneys for emergency psychiatric treatment, a
federal judge gave her defense team permission yesterday
to bring their own psychiatrist to her jail cell.
However, U.S. District Judge Oliver }. Carter stressed
that under no conditions would he allow the defense
doctor to testify in any legal proceeding involving the
newspaper heiress.
Defense attorney Albert Johnson sought "immediate
psychiatric aid" for his client at the unexpected hearing.
Johnson did not elaborate on the nature of the
"emergency," other than to say that there had been no
improvement in Miss Hearst's condition during her stay at
the San Mateo County Jail south of here.
Exxon reports profits down
NEW YORK—Exxon Corp., the world's largest oil com
pany, said yesterday its third quarter profits fell sharply
from last year's inflated levels, but are showing some signs
of improvement.
Exxon's results appear to reflect the industry-wide
trend that has cut profits of some companies back to the
levels that existed before the 1973 oil embargo and foreign
price hikes caused them to soar.
The company, citing the impact of higher taxes and
lower demand, reported third quarter earnings of $550
million or $2.46 a share on revenues of $12.25 billion.
The latest earnings were up from the second quarter's
$535 million or $2.39 a share, but 31 percent below the
$800 million or $3.58 a share posted in the 1974 third
quarter.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday except patchy low clouds or fog
Saturday morning. Little temperature change. Highs both
days the mid 60s to lower 70s.

The company, citing the impact of higher taxes and
lower demand, reported third quarter earnings of $550
million or $2.46 a share on revenues of $12.25 billion.
The latest earnings were up from the second quarter's
$535 million or $2.39 a share, but 31 percent below the
$800 million or $3.58 a share posted in the 1974 third
quarter.

Borbon will replace Franco soon
MADRlD—Doctors issued a medical bulletin last night
saying that 82-year-old Gen. Francisco Franco suffered a
relapse following a heart attack Tuesday.
The statement opened the way for a constitutional trans
fer of power to the generalissimo's designated heir,
37-year-old Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon. The cabinet was
expected to start the transfer in motion when it meets
today.
A spokesman at the palace said Franco was "recover
ing." He said reports that the head of state was in a coma
were "lies," but did not directly repudiate the doctors'
declaration.
Some foreign diplomatic sources said it was their opin
ion Franco was not critically ill, but that his illness had
been exaggerated in a political move to oust him.
Spain gives Sahara to Morocco
MARKAKECH, Morocco—Spain has reached a tentative
understanding with Morocco for the peaceful handover of
sovereignty in disputed Spanish Sahara, Moroccan
sources said late yesterday.
The sources said King Hassan II of Morocco will not call
oft his proposed march of 350,000 unarmed Moroccans
into the territory, but it was agreed that only a "symbolic
contingent" would go all the way to El Aaiun, the Spanish
Sahara capital.
Tens of thousands of Moroccans continued to move in
trains, trucks and buses toward the assembly point at
Tarfaya, on the Spanish Sahara border, for the "March of
Conquest."
The sources said Moroccan Foreign Minister Ahmed
Laaki was due to fly to Madrid Friday or Saturday to
complete the negotiations, and only the possible death of
Spanish chief of state Francisco Franco could upset the
timetable for the handover of the Spanish colony.
Italian poet receives Nobel prize
STOCKHOLM—Eugenio Montale, Italy's grand old
poet of nature, love and solitude was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Literature yesterday by a sharply divided
Swedish Academy of Letters.
The 79-year old Montale, often a candidate and said to
be the choice of older members of the academy, won over
60-year-old U.S. novelist Saul Bellow, the most serious

contender, informed sources said.
Bellow, vacationing in Israel, said: "It's very nice that
Eugenio Montale won the Nobel prize. I'm not disap
pointed. There's plenty of time to win it yet."
Turkey's leftist peasant-novelist Yasar Kemal and Doris
Lessing, a British writer born in Iran, also were said to
have been in the running.
Psychiatrist will treat Hearst
SAN FRANClSCO—Responding to pleas from Patricia
Hearst's attorneys for emergency psychiatric treatment, a
federal judge gave her defense team permission yesterday
to bring their own psychiatrist to her jail cell.
However, U.S. District Judge Oliver }. Carter stressed
that under no conditions would he allow the defense
doctor to testify in any legal proceeding involving the
newspaper heiress.
Defense attorney Albert Johnson sought "immediate
psychiatric aid" for his client at the unexpected hearing.
Johnson did not elaborate on the nature of the
"emergency," other than to say that there had been no
improvement in Miss Hearst's condition during her stay at
the San Mateo County Jail south of here.
Exxon reports profits down
NEW YORK—Exxon Corp., the world's largest oil com

levels that existed before the 1973 oil embargo and foreign
price hikes caused them to soar.
The company, citing the impact of higher taxes and
