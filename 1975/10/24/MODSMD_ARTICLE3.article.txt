# School to close anyway
## Students laud Ravenswood program 
### KEVIN CHILDRESS RON SEGE 
The San Mateo County Sheriff's
helicopter hovered over newly integ
rated Ravenswood High School on the
lookout for anticipated lunchtime
trouble.
Below, black and white students
swore at the skyborne watchers. The
school's costly gamble to integrate
voluntarily seemed to be working bet
ter than any mandatory program in the

state.
Next year Ravenswood will close. In
a meeting last week, the Sequoia
Union High School District Board of
Trustees decided 4-1 to close the
school, citing inferior academic
facilities and a need to further integ
rate, implying that improving
Ravenswood would cost too much.
The district, which expects to fall
over $1,000,000 in debt next year, had
to close a school. It decided that the

victim would be Ravenswood, where
minority enrollment among the 650
students has risen from 55 percent in
the first year of integration to its cur
rent level of 64 percent today. This was
unacceptably high according to a letter
sent to the district by the Department
of Health. Education and Welfare
(HEW).
But the racial proportions are "per
fect," according to Mary Clauss, a
white junior at Ravenswood. She and

another white girl, Mignon Stocks, say
they consider the atmosphere at other
Sequoia District high schools one of
"hate," but classify Ravenswood's as
one of at least "peaceful coexistence,"
with many genuine inter-racial friend
ships.
'A closeness'
"We have a closeness here," says
Denise Womack, president of the
Ravenswood student body. She says
the voluntary integration program
"worked because everybody who
comes here wants to come here. There
is a will to work out problems."
The district gambled in 1971 by
spending an estimated 30 percent per
student per day more at Ravenswood
than at other high schools in an effort
to entice non-minority students to
come to the school. But this figure, ac
cording to Principal James Vann, is not
accurate.
"We are supposed to spend about 30
percent more, but it is actually much
more. Our cost per student is so high
that I don't even like to discuss it. It's
incredible," he said.
Several students interviewed by the
Daily said they feel that court action
initiated by pro-Ravenswood forces
may keep the school open for at least
another year. .
Faith
"I have faith that the school's not
going to close," says Womack. Most of
the students interviewed expressed
the same view, but administration of
ficials were much less optimistic.
"It all depends on how well they
(pro-Ravenswood forces) present their
case," says John Simson. dean of stu
dent affairs. "If the litigation does go
through, then we are faced with new

whose enrollment is two-thirds minorities, will be closed
next year despite the objections of many students.
