Democrat David Harris, candidate
for Paul (Pete) McCloskey's congres
sional seat and former Stanford stu
dent body president, said at the law
school yesterday the questions of his
campaign are "survival questions."
Until recently, Harris said, Ameri
cans operated on the assumption that
there would always be "a layer of fat"
to live off. Now problems such as the
diminishing supplies of essential
minerals and metals and the increas
ing pollution of the oceans have en
gendered a "new awareness" — an
awareness that the world's natural re

sources are not unlimited.
Harris, who sees himself as an expo
nent of this new awareness, said new
consumer patterns have to be created.
There must be a complete readjust
ment of the distribution of resources,
both to save the environment and to
insure that all citizens share the be
nefits of those resources.
Participation in this society depends
upon income, as well as political free
dom, Harris stressed. To ensure this
participation, redistribution of re
sources must take place under the
guiding imperative of "the public in
terest."

"The mass of the people," not some
privileged minority, Harris says,
should receive the benefits of these re
sources.
On Ford administration
Harris contended that the Ford Ad
ministration was responding slug
gishly and irresponsibly to the need
for change. In order to reduce unemp
loyment and encourage the redistribu
tion of resources. Harris suggested that
the government:
—lower interest rates on loans to six
percent in order to stimulate the
growth of new business;
—cut back on the average length of

the work week in order to give more
people a chance to work;
—reorganize the delivery of services
to eliminate unnecessary intermediate
steps;
—and insure that frequently
ignored fringe groups, such as the el
derly who must live on inadequate So
cial Security payments, are provided
with better incomes.
Decentralized programs
This plan should be implemented
on the local level. Harris said. But he
advocated federal funding of these
programs, citing the national
government's "redoubtable" ability to
tax.
In order to fund the plan he outlined,
Harris suggested the budget for de
fense be cut in half. He maintained
there is a great deal of "slack" in milit
ary spending that could be taken up.
He said American armed forces should
be withdrawn from West Germany,
Japan and South Korea, which he said
has a corrupt and undemocratic gov
ernment.
Harris said special tax privileges
should be ended to allow the redis
tribution of resources. Harris cited oil
companies and large banks as the
primary beneficiaries of the present
tax system.
