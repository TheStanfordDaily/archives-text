Democrat David Harris, candidate
for Paul (Pete) McCloskey's congres
sional seat and former Stanford stu
dent body president, said at the law
school yesterday the questions of his
campaign are "survival questions."
Until recently, Harris said, Ameri
cans operated on the assumption that
there would always be "a layer of fat"
to live off. Now problems such as the
diminishing supplies of essential
minerals and metals and the increas
ing pollution of the oceans have en
gendered a "new awareness" — an
awareness that the world's natural re

sources are not unlimited.
Harris, who sees himself as an expo
nent of this new awareness, said new
consumer patterns have to be created.
There must be a complete readjust
ment of the distribution of resources,
both to save the environment and to
insure that all citizens share the be
nefits of those resources.
Participation in this society depends
upon income, as well as political free
dom, Harris stressed. To ensure this
participation, redistribution of re
sources must take place under the
guiding imperative of "the public in
terest."

"The mass of the people," not some
privileged minority, Harris says,
should receive the benefits of these re
sources.
On Ford administration
Harris contended that the Ford Ad
ministration was responding slug
gishly and irresponsibly to the need
for change. In order to reduce unemp
loyment and encourage the redistribu
tion of resources. Harris suggested that
the government:
—lower interest rates on loans to six
percent in order to stimulate the
growth of new business;
—cut back on the average length of

the work week in order to give more
people a chance to work;
—reorganize the delivery of services
to eliminate unnecessary intermediate
steps;
—and insure that frequently
ignored fringe groups, such as the el
derly who must live on inadequate So
cial Security payments, are provided
with better incomes.
Decentralized programs
This plan should be implemented
on the local level. Harris said. But he
advocated federal funding of these
programs, citing the national
government's "redoubtable" ability to
tax.
In order to fund the plan he outlined,
Harris suggested the budget for de
fense be cut in half. He maintained
there is a great deal of "slack" in milit
ary spending that could be taken up.
He said American armed forces should
be withdrawn from West Germany,
Japan and South Korea, which he said
has a corrupt and undemocratic gov
ernment.
Harris said special tax privileges
should be ended to allow the redis
tribution of resources. Harris cited oil
companies and large banks as the
primary beneficiaries of the present
tax system.

CAMPAIGN TRAIL — David Harris, an ex-Stanford student body president,
returned to his alma mater yesterday and called for, among other things, a
redistribution of resources. Harris seeks to gain Paul McCloskey's congres
sional seat.
He stressed that the income tax
structure must also be viewed as a way
of subsidizing various interests, since
entities which are not taxed as much as
they should be are, in effect, being
awarded money.
According to Harris, 75 percent of
all tax "subsidies" end up going to in
dividuals making more than $25,000 a
year.
The environment
Americans must take care of the en
vironment they live in, Harris said.
"We've assumed that we can simply
use it up and not put it back together
again," he added. To put it together

again, he suggested:
—reorganizing the way products are
packaged in order to eliminate un
necessary waste of resources and to
help control pollution;
—reorganizing the National Parks
System so it would no longer be an
agency that allots our remaining re
sources to various industrial interests.
Harris was optimistic about his
chances for election. Because of the
Federal Campaign Financial Act,
which limits a candidate's campaign
budget to $70,000, "politics has been
returned to the realm of the amateur,"
Harris said.
'Get under' McCloskey
Harris described his campaign as an
attempt to "get under" the well
ensconced McCloskey. Harris said he
is opposing McCloskey because the
Congressman has remained a suppor
ter of the Ford Administration's
policies, which are mere continua
tions of the Nixon Administration's
basic policies, according to Harris.
Harris also said he would not en
dorse other candidates during his
campaign. Endorsements, he said, are
simply beyond the mechanical
capacities of his campaign's structure.
Harris fielded questions cooly anil
with humor. Asked if he would be in
favor of saving the city of New York
from bankruptcy, he answered,
"We've got to bail it out."
"What if another one went bank
rupt?" his interlocutor continued.
He paused. "Well, I'd take them one
at a time."
