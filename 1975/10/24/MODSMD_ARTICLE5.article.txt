# C-US recommends office consolidation
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Following Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James L. Gibbs' resignation
due Aug. 31, the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US) has re
commended that his replacement also
hold office as a vice provost.
Provost William F. Miller said at last
week's Faculty Senate meeting that he
is "generally inclined to accept" the
C-US recommendations.
Miller's decision was made after
weighing varying proposals made by
Gibbs, the C-US majority report and
the C-US minority report. Gibbs fa
vored setting up two positions: dean of
undergraduate studies and a
Humanities and Sciences associate
dean for undergraduate education.
The committee minority report
proposed that one officer simultane
ously hold the offices of dean of un
dergraduate studies and associate
dean for undergraduate housing in the
School of Humanities and Sciences
(H&S).
However, the majority report re
jected that proposal, claiming that if
"the post (were) to go into H&S, the
undergraduate education officer
would cease to sit as an equal among
the deans at the Dean's Council and in
the Acadmic Senate. . . . Under
graduate studies would simply cease
to have a voice in these councils."
Majority viewpoint
The majority viewpoint was that
elevation of the dean to vice provost
would signal "that undergraduate
education is coequal at Stanford with
graduate studies."
Millef also indicated at the meeting
that the new dean-vice provost would
presumably continue to be responsible
for the Learning Assistance Center, the
Academic Information Center and ex
tradepartmental programs such as
SWOPSI, SCIRE and undergraduate
specials.
After consultation with theComittee
on Committees, Miller plans to draft a

charge for a search committee to re
commend candidates for the new
deanship. Gibbs will relinquish his
administrative duties and return to
teachng and research.
According to Miller, however, ad
ministrative responsibiity for inter
school undergraduate programs
would be shifted to the deans of the
"cognizant schools."
Dean's involvement
Faculty Senate members expressed
concern about the importance of the
undergraduate dean's involvement in
faculty appointments and curricular
matters. Religious Studies Prof. Wil
liam Clebsch said, "We still have to
master the art of relating the impor
tance of general university under
graduate teaching to departments."
Later, Clebsch said "concerted ac

tion" is needed to close the gap bet
ween the new dean and the depart
ments.
Gibbs said afterwards he felt that
Miller's decision was a "good one,"
particularly since "it indicates Uni
versity acceptance of the notion that
undergraduate education should have
a centrally placed, high-level adminis
trative officer."
Gibbs, however, had expressed in
his recommendations his concern that
if the dean were to become a vice pro
vost. he would no longer have mana
gerial responsibility for the academic
programs and services now handled
by the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies.
"Such services would have to be
lodged elsewhere, leaving the problem
of their coordination and focus," Gibbs
said.
