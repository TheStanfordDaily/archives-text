# Frat council views new rush proposal
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Citing the failure of last year's rush to draw enough new pledges to fill the
university-mandated housing quota, Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Rush
Committee Chairman Tim Ferguson asked the IFC to extend his committee's
powers at a meeting yesterday.
Ferguson asked the IFC to grant his committee "the power to request from
each house documents which it determines to be helpful in assessing the
house's ability to conduct a successful rush," and"the power to assume any
and all authority over rush activities" at any house declared "unfit to conduct a
successful rush."
Although IFC members were at first wary of giving up too much of their
individual houses' autonomy, they acknowledged the need for a strong central
committee.
According to the University's fraternity housing quota plan, each fraternity
house must maintain a minimum number of residents throughout the academic
year. This number (or quota) is calculated by counting each sophomore as one
resident, and each junior or senior as one-half resident.
Sophomores wanted
Because a house filled with juniors and seniors would be filled far beyond
capacity, a premium is placed on having a relatively high percentage of
sophomores. This is designed to encourage upperclassmen to live off campus.

"Things look pretty good for next
year if we can get organized now,"
Ferguson said. "Last year the different
houses went about the rush totally in
dependently and the system missed
the quota by nine and one-half places."
The majority of the deficit occurred
in the Delta Kappa Epsilon, Theta Xi,
Delta Tau Delta and Kappa Alpha
fraternities.
Ferguson pointed out a clause in the
quota plan which he said requires a
concerted effort by fraternities: "If the
fraternity system as a whole fails to
meet its quota for two consecutive
years, the house with the greatest share
of deficit over the previous two years
will tentatively enter the housing
draw."
Warnings
The quota plan goes on to say that if
an individual house fails to meet its
quota three out of four consecutive
years, it may also be placed in the
housing draw.
The quota plan was approved by the
fraternities last spring with mixed feel
ings. "We wanted to cooperate," Fer
guson said, "but we really were forced
v into it. By now the university isn't giv
ing us a hard time, but they don't have
to."
Also discussed at the meeting was
the fraternity system's role in the Big
Game bonfire. About $500 will be
budgeted this year for the bonfire. The
fraternities will assume their tradi
tional responsibility for the organiza
tion and actual building of the bonfire.
