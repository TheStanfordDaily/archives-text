## Help New York 
### 
Misguided notions of fiscal responsibility and a lin
gering cultural and political provincialism have com
bined to persuade Administration officials to deny
federal aid to financially hard-pressed New York City.
The decision will backfire.
President Ford contends that the nation cannot afford
to help New York. Taxpayers, especially during a re
cession, cannot sustain extra burdens, he says. But we
believe that taxpayers can't afford not to help the
nation's largest city.
If New York defaults on its obligations, the opera
tions of the nation's leading banks and factories cen
tered in the city will be disrupted. Worse yet, the city,
which has already eliminated 31,000 jobs, would cut
even more jobs, adding to the city's already considera
ble unemployment problem. The entire nation would
feel the effects of both.
The chain reaction would also extend to the finan
cial problems of other leading cities. Investors would
lose confidence in nearly all cities, and lending to
municipalities would be sharply reduced.
Furthermore, the value of the dollar abroad would
fall as foreigners lost confidence in a nation whose
largest city went bankrupt and defaulted on its bonds.
Many critics of New York argue that the city has
managed its financial affairs poorly and has spent too
much money on extravagant social welfare programs.
They are right.
But New York's problems are not all its own fault.
One of the main reasons New York is broke is that
people who work in the city enjoy its abundant
municipal services but escape its life-sustaining prop
erty taxes by fleeing to suburbia in the evening.
The city has demonstrated good faith in its promise
to reform. It is reorganizing its financial structure and
slicing its profligate social welfare schemes.
The Administration also argues that aiding New
York would disrupt the nation's system of federalism.
This argument ignores the large amount of federal
funds already pumped into cities through revenue
sharing and similar programs.
Ford is fond ofposing New York's interests against
those of America. But in his provincialism he fails to
comprehend that New York is an integral part of
America. New York's financial collapse can only
weaken the economic stability of the nation as a whole.
The Administration should act immediately to
guarantee New York's financial obligations for the
next several years.
