If Stanford University is to re
main an institution of higher
learning it must maintain a suit
able learning environment for its
undergraduates.
1 doubt that I speak only for
myself when I say that I find it
nearly impossible to get any
thing accomplished in Meyer
Undergraduate Library. Recog
nition of this is shown in the
great number of undergraduates
who have flocked to the new
Law Library, only to be told that
undergraduates cannot study
there.
1 do not blame the Law School

for its policy. It is probably wary,
and justifiably so, that its library
will become another Meyer.
Such disruptiveness is kept
from developing in high schools
by the policing of librarians and
their assistants. Now, I am not
advocating the introduction of a
"policing" system.
But I feel it is impossible to
expect students to maintain
some kind of control over their
fellow students. It is the duty of
students to refrain from bother
ing those students who did not
come to the library to socialize.
A situation like this is not eas-

Douglas Bargar
ily remedied. A new policy must
be introduced which, hopefully,
will set a precedent for the fu
ture.
At a big university like Stan
ford, consideration for the rights
of others are frequently disre
garded for the sake of one's own
personal indulgences. It is un
fortunate that more of us do not
demonstrate the need for a suita
ble study area through our ac
tions.
