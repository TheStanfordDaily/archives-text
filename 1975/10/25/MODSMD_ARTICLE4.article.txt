# 'Northern Four' get lots of guff
## WSU, despite complaints, maintains it's an asset 
### CHRIS BAKER 
If IJSC football Coach John
McKay had his way, Stanford
might be playing San Diego State,
instead of battling Washington
State today.
McKay, who is also the Trojan
athletic director, has become as
popular in Pullman as he is on the
Farm. "With our current
schedules, we're being robbed of a
lot of money by staying in the
Pacific Eight.
"When we play certain confer
ence schools, in their stadiums
every year, we lose a fortune,"
said McKay. "That's because the
league is all wrong population
wise. It's too heavy in the south —
in California."
With a seating capacity of
27,600, WSU's Martin Stadium
could hold the entire population
of Pullman and have 7600 extra
seats.
Relative attendance low
In two home games, Washing
ton State has drawn just 5.1.000
fans, an average of 26,500. It's the
sixth best in the conference.
Not exactly the kind of figures
athletic directors dream about.
Nor the kind of figures McKay, the
NCAA "super conference" advo
cate. would like to see. "Washing
ton .State made $85,000 and
$96,000 off our games in Los
Angeles in 1969 and 1971,"
McKay complained. "In 1970 we
each grossed $19,000 in Spokane.
That barely paid our expenses for
the game."
But Cougar Athletic Director
Kay Nagel contends that the WSU
game checks aren't that bad. "Our
settlement checks are on par with
the rest of the conference." he
said. "I think John was quoted on
some things out of context. He's
predicating things on money. At
some particular point you have to

say that it (football) is for the stu
dents.
'Have to scramble'
WSU has been doing a fine job
of it. The Cougar Club, an athletic
support group, raised $281,000
last year. Nagel also took the 1972
USC-WSU game to Seattle, in
creasing each school's revenue to
$79,000. And he took last year's
Ohio State contest to Seattle as
well. A little scrambling.
Still, McKay's comments in
volve more than mere money:
"Stadiums and populations are
not only smaller in the north, but
the weather is worse too. In 1973,
our defending national champ
ions, working on a 20-game un
beaten streak, drew 21,000 people
in Corvallis for Oregon State. It
was the first day of hunting sea

son." Presumably the hunters
missed.
Title IX?
Part of the criticism of the
"Northwest Nothings" that has
surfaced this year is due to some
thing else that surfaced this year.
As one USC source put it, "We're
worried about money this year.
With Title IX and all, we have to
make more money or cut some
programs."
McKay has suggested replacing
WSU and Oregon with San Diego
State and Arizona — or getting rid
of the schools altogether. There
has even been some speculation
that WSU might leave the Pac-8
for the Big Sky conference, which
is geographically better for the
Cougars.
Pac-8 Executive Director Wiles

Hallock says it won't happen.
"Washington State is in capable
hands. Glenn Terrell is a fine pres
ident and Ray Nagel has done an
outstanding job."
Cougar Sports Information Di
rector Mike Wilson scoffs at the
possibility also. "We happen to
think we're good for the Pac-8 and
the Pac-8 is good for us. The con
ference could vote 7-0 to have us
leave and we would stay."
It's probably just as well. How
would Pac-7 sound, anyway?
