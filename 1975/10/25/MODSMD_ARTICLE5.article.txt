# The 						cat's outta the bag
## Still, WSU may not have claws left for an upset 
### DAVE DALEKE MARK FUNK 
If the real thing has graduated, a
coach might as well put a couple
of reasonable (or, as the case may
he, unreasonable) facsimiles out
on the field. Jim Plunkett
lookalikes Are in vogue again this
year. A sidelight to today's game
will be the clash of two quarter
backs who purportedly bear some
resemblance to the former Indian
great.
It's one of those "dream match
ups" that publicists sometimes
create before the season starts.
Stanford's pseudo-Plunkett, of
course, is Mike Cordova. He is as
tall as Plunkett, looks a bit like
him and even wears his old
number — 16. In fact, he's got just
about everything but Plunkett's
passing stats.
Washington State will counter
with Jack Thompson (who, inci
dentally, is a Samoan. It is a fact
that Stanford has yet to win a
game this season against a team
with a Samoan on its roster.). The
Cougar pressbook claims the
young sophomore has all the
physical attributes of — "a Jim
Plunkett."

He has some of the stats, too.
Last week against UCLA,
Thompson came off the bench in
the second half to throw for 218
yards and two touchdowns in his
first action of the year. He also had
an impressive freshman season.
Actually, Thompson looks less
like Jim Plunkett than the mean
average Stanford quarterback: he
comes from near Seattle, Wash,
(like Cordova), is coming off a
knee injury that kept him out all
last season (like Guy Benjamin)
and, according to coach Jim
Sweeney, is a scholar-athlete and
"an outstanding play caller" (like
Jerry Waldvogel).
So Sweeney will be going with a
newcomer at quarterback.
It's been that kind of year for the
ebullient Irishman. He started out
-the year with three signal-callers.
Two of them — Wally Bennett,
who started the season, and John
Hopkins — are through for the
year. If Thompson gets hurt, look
for tailback Dan Doornik (who is
recovering from a knee injury) to
fill in at quarterback.
To top that off, the Cougs' lead
ing ground gainer, fullback Vern
Chamberlain, is also out for the

year. He injured his knee versus
UCLA.
Sweeney's defense is also hurt
ing. All three linebackers have
been shelved by injuries at one
time or another.
In other words, its been kind of a
tough fall up on the Palouse. After
two wins to open the season,
Washington State has dropped its
last four games. In spite of that,
Sweeney's Cougars may be the
class of the northern teams this
year. It oughta tell you something.
