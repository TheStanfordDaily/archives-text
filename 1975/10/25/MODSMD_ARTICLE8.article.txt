# Hill's the ultimate end
## But he'll bypass honors for victories... 
### RON BECK 
Until this week's new statistics came out, the
same person had been leading the nation in pass
receptions per game for four weeks in a row.
Since "you can only catch what's thrown to
you," after last weekend's game against Washing
ton, in which only a few passes came his way,
Stanford flanker Tony Hill dropped into a tie for
fifth.
If you aren't from a Pacific Eight school,
Michigan, Penn State or San Jose State, you've
probably never heard of Hill. Don't bother to look
hack to Playboy's pre-season Ail-American picks,
or Street & Smith's Blue Chip player guide, be
cause you won't find Hill listed there.
"Our offense isn't really geared to producing an
Ail-American wide receiver, because our quarter
backs throw to both sides," explained the Cards'
receivers coach, Pete Kettella. "At other schools
where the quarterback might pass 15 times to the
same guy in one game, a receiver has a better
chance."
"Winning games is a lot more on my mind than
being named as an All-American," says Hill.
The 6-foot-2,185-pound junior from Long Beach
has already done enough this season to merit con
sideration for honors. Hill caught six passes in the
Cards' opener against Penn State and followed that
up with an incredible eight catches against then
third-ranked Michigan.
Hill's 126 yards and one touchdown led him to
be named as the Pacific-Eight's offensive player
of-the-week. The next weekend, San Jose St. let
him sneak through its defense for another six re
ceptions.
Hill caught only four against Army, but the Card
game plan was centered around a running attack.
UCLA limited Hill to his six receptions-per-game
average, but another game plan emphasizing run
ning, and a poor passing day for quarterback Mike

Cordova left him with only two receptions against
Washington.
After six games, the only person who has effec
tively stopped Hill has been Cordova. Play after
play, Hill manages to slip through the usual
double-coverage assigned to him.
"We've never found a defensive back who could
shut Tony out." said Kettella. "Nobody has been
able to close him off or catch him off guard more
than once. Even though the defenses change-up on
him, Tony has a complete arsenal he can go to in
order to beat them."
But the defenses have stopped changing up on
him since the Michigan game. Now Hili can almost
always expect to see two defenders assigned to
him.
Hill's accomplishments at Stanford have often
been compared with those of former Indian All-
American Gene Washington (now with the San
Francisco 49ers), and for a good reason. Both Hill
and Washington went to Long Beach Polytechnic
High where they starred as quarterbacks ("1 broke
all of his records," recalls Hill.). Then both came to
Stanford where they were switched to the wide
receiver position.
Hill's team leading 34 catches last year com
bined with this year's 32 catches leaves him 56
receptions short of Washington's 122-career
catches, but he's far ahead of Washington's pace.
At the rate he's going, Hill should follow
Washington into the ranks of Stanford Ail-
Americans. If it doesn't happen this season, there's
always his senior year.
Listening to Hill answer questions about his
prospects of being selected for the honor, it's easy
to believe that being chosen isn't an all-consuming
interest for him.
As Hill tells it, "You can't concentrate on being
an Ail-American when there's team success to
work for."

bined with this year's 32 catches leaves him 56
receptions short of Washington's 122-career
catches, but he's far ahead of Washington's pace.
At the rate he's going, Hill should follow
Washington into the ranks of Stanford Ail-
Americans. If it doesn't happen this season, there's
always his senior year.
Listening to Hill answer questions about his
prospects of being selected for the honor, it's easy
to believe that being chosen isn't an all-consuming
interest for him.
As Hill tells it, "You can't concentrate on being
an Ail-American when there's team success to
work for."
Until this week's new statistics came out, the
same person had been leading the nation in pass
receptions per game for four weeks in a row.
Since "you can only catch what's thrown to
you," after last weekend's game against Washing
ton, in which only a few passes came his way,
Stanford flanker Tony Hill dropped into a tie for
fifth.
If you aren't from a Pacific Eight school,
Michigan, Penn State or San Jose State, you've
probably never heard of Hill. Don't bother to look
hack to Playboy's pre-season Ail-American picks,
or Street & Smith's Blue Chip player guide, be
cause you won't find Hill listed there.
"Our offense isn't really geared to producing an
Ail-American wide receiver, because our quarter
backs throw to both sides," explained the Cards'
receivers coach, Pete Kettella. "At other schools
where the quarterback might pass 15 times to the
same guy in one game, a receiver has a better
chance."
"Winning games is a lot more on my mind than
being named as an All-American," says Hill.
The 6-foot-2,185-pound junior from Long Beach
has already done enough this season to merit con
sideration for honors. Hill caught six passes in the
Cards' opener against Penn State and followed that
up with an incredible eight catches against then
third-ranked Michigan.
Hill's 126 yards and one touchdown led him to
be named as the Pacific-Eight's offensive player
of-the-week. The next weekend, San Jose St. let
him sneak through its defense for another six re
ceptions.
Hill caught only four against Army, but the Card
game plan was centered around a running attack.
UCLA limited Hill to his six receptions-per-game
average, but another game plan emphasizing run
ning, and a poor passing day for quarterback Mike

Cordova left him with only two receptions against
Washington.
After six games, the only person who has effec
tively stopped Hill has been Cordova. Play after
play, Hill manages to slip through the usual
double-coverage assigned to him.
"We've never found a defensive back who could
shut Tony out." said Kettella. "Nobody has been
able to close him off or catch him off guard more
than once. Even though the defenses change-up on
him, Tony has a complete arsenal he can go to in
order to beat them."
But the defenses have stopped changing up on
him since the Michigan game. Now Hili can almost
always expect to see two defenders assigned to
him.
Hill's accomplishments at Stanford have often
been compared with those of former Indian All-
American Gene Washington (now with the San
Francisco 49ers), and for a good reason. Both Hill
and Washington went to Long Beach Polytechnic
High where they starred as quarterbacks ("1 broke
all of his records," recalls Hill.). Then both came to
Stanford where they were switched to the wide
receiver position.
Hill's team leading 34 catches last year com
bined with this year's 32 catches leaves him 56
receptions short of Washington's 122-career
catches, but he's far ahead of Washington's pace.
