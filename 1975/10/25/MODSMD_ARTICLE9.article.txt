# He catches as catch can
## Receiver Bill Singler is number two...sort of 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
In a sport primarily populated
by broad-shouldered, muscle
bound gargantuans, Bill Singler is
a refreshing reminder that real
people play football.
A player termed "small" by
football criteria is still usually
above average in size by normal
standards.
Not Singler.
There are small football players
and there are small football
players. Singler. one of Stanford's
starting wide receivers, is of the
later variety.
Singler's stature —5-foot-9, 160
lbs. is such that, after looking at
him, you're tempted to say to
yourself, "Geez, maybe 1 should
try out for football." He looks
more like a jockey than a football
player.
"I'm one of your football
stereotypes," Singler says in jest.
"It's funny. Sometimes when I'm
in a group I'll be introduced to
someone as a football player, and
they'll say, 'Oh you must be jok
ing.'
"It doesn't bother me. There are
a lot of other guys my size playing
football. You don't have to be a

great big guy. I know I can play the
game as well as anyone else."
Three-year starter
Better even. Now in his third
year as a starting split end for
Stanford, Singler, a senior, was
named to the All Pac-8 team in
1973 as a sophomore on the basis
of his 31 pass receptions for 501
yards and five touchdowns.
Singler slipped to 15 catches for
249 yards and four TDs last year,
but he says that doesn't necessar
ily mean his performance slipped
corespondingly.
"A receiver is only as good as
how many balls are thrown to
him," he says. "There was one
stretch of five games where I had
like 10 balls thrown to me."
Singler has already caught 14
passes this year—one less than all
last season. He needs only 10 more
catches to become Stanford's
seventh leading all-time receiver
behind Randy Vataha, and his 10
career touchdown receptions are
fourth best in that department.
All this from a guy who hardly
looks big enough for touch foot
ball, much less Pac-8 football.
Singler compensates for his lack
of size with quickness, deception,

good hands and meticulously-run
pass patterns.
"In my opinion," says Tony
Hill, Singler's counterpart on the
other side of the Stanford offense,
"he has the best hands and runs
the best pass routes in the Pac-8."
Hill credits much of his own
success to Singler.
"I've basically tried to learn his
excellent moves," Hill said. "He
runs what you call a smooth pat
tern — you can hardly detect what
kind of pattern he's going to run. I
try to put his style into my form of
running so 1 can be almost as de
ceptive as him."
Singler grew up in Medford,
Ore., and was named All-State in
prep football and basketball there.
"I love Oregon," says Singler, one
of eight Oregonians listed on
Stanford's varsity roster. "Hope
fully I'll return someday and settle
down there. I can't say anything
bad about Stanford. This is great.
If I were to live in California, this
would be the place."
Future plans
Singler doesn't know exactly
where he'll be next year at this
time. He could be back at Stanford
as a grad student or he could be in
any of 28American cities posses
sing National Football League
franchises.
"It's something lodged in the
back of your mind," Singler says
on the possibiliy of playing pro
football. "You always want to
reach the top. I can't say my life is
going to revolve around it, but I
definitely think I'll give it a
chance."
Singler's primary future goal is
not to play football, but to coach it.
Coaching football is something
I've always wanted to do," the
psychology major said. "The peo
ple I've respected and admired
most have been coaches because
they've been so much a part of my
life."

named to the All Pac-8 team in
1973 as a sophomore on the basis
of his 31 pass receptions for 501
yards and five touchdowns.
Singler slipped to 15 catches for
249 yards and four TDs last year,
but he says that doesn't necessar
ily mean his performance slipped
corespondingly.
"A receiver is only as good as
how many balls are thrown to
him," he says. "There was one
stretch of five games where I had
like 10 balls thrown to me."
Singler has already caught 14
passes this year—one less than all
last season. He needs only 10 more
catches to become Stanford's
seventh leading all-time receiver
behind Randy Vataha, and his 10
career touchdown receptions are
fourth best in that department.
All this from a guy who hardly
looks big enough for touch foot
ball, much less Pac-8 football.
Singler compensates for his lack
of size with quickness, deception,

good hands and meticulously-run
pass patterns.
"In my opinion," says Tony
Hill, Singler's counterpart on the
other side of the Stanford offense,
"he has the best hands and runs
the best pass routes in the Pac-8."
Hill credits much of his own
success to Singler.
"I've basically tried to learn his
excellent moves," Hill said. "He
runs what you call a smooth pat
tern — you can hardly detect what
kind of pattern he's going to run. I
try to put his style into my form of
running so 1 can be almost as de
ceptive as him."
Singler grew up in Medford,
Ore., and was named All-State in
prep football and basketball there.
"I love Oregon," says Singler, one
of eight Oregonians listed on
Stanford's varsity roster. "Hope
fully I'll return someday and settle
down there. I can't say anything
bad about Stanford. This is great.
If I were to live in California, this
would be the place."
Future plans
Singler doesn't know exactly
where he'll be next year at this
time. He could be back at Stanford
as a grad student or he could be in
any of 28American cities posses
sing National Football League
franchises.
"It's something lodged in the
back of your mind," Singler says
on the possibiliy of playing pro
football. "You always want to
reach the top. I can't say my life is
going to revolve around it, but I
definitely think I'll give it a
chance."
Singler's primary future goal is
not to play football, but to coach it.
Coaching football is something
I've always wanted to do," the
psychology major said. "The peo
ple I've respected and admired
most have been coaches because
they've been so much a part of my
life."

In a sport primarily populated
by broad-shouldered, muscle
bound gargantuans, Bill Singler is
a refreshing reminder that real
people play football.
A player termed "small" by
football criteria is still usually
above average in size by normal
standards.
Not Singler.
There are small football players
and there are small football
players. Singler. one of Stanford's
starting wide receivers, is of the
later variety.
Singler's stature —5-foot-9, 160
lbs. is such that, after looking at
him, you're tempted to say to
yourself, "Geez, maybe 1 should
try out for football." He looks
more like a jockey than a football
player.
"I'm one of your football
stereotypes," Singler says in jest.
"It's funny. Sometimes when I'm
in a group I'll be introduced to
someone as a football player, and
they'll say, 'Oh you must be jok
ing.'
"It doesn't bother me. There are
a lot of other guys my size playing
football. You don't have to be a

great big guy. I know I can play the
game as well as anyone else."
Three-year starter
Better even. Now in his third
year as a starting split end for

kind of pattern he's going to run. I
try to put his style into my form of
running so 1 can be almost as de
ceptive as him."
Singler grew up in Medford,
Ore., and was named All-State in
prep football and basketball there.
"I love Oregon," says Singler, one
of eight Oregonians listed on
Stanford's varsity roster. "Hope
fully I'll return someday and settle
down there. I can't say anything
bad about Stanford. This is great.
If I were to live in California, this
would be the place."
Future plans
Singler doesn't know exactly
where he'll be next year at this
time. He could be back at Stanford
as a grad student or he could be in
any of 28American cities posses
sing National Football League
franchises.
"It's something lodged in the
back of your mind," Singler says
on the possibiliy of playing pro
football. "You always want to
reach the top. I can't say my life is
going to revolve around it, but I
definitely think I'll give it a
chance."
Singler's primary future goal is
not to play football, but to coach it.
Coaching football is something
I've always wanted to do," the
psychology major said. "The peo
ple I've respected and admired
most have been coaches because
they've been so much a part of my
life."
