# High voltage laser experiment
## Student electrocuted in lab 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Charles Hawley, a third-year
graduate student in applied physics,
was electrocuted early yesterday
morning while working on a laser ex
periment in the High Temperature
Gasdynamics Laboratory.
The Safety and Health Division of
the office of Insurance/Risk Manage
ment is investigating the apparent ac
cident, the exact cause of which has
not been determined. Hawley's death
was probably due to his coming in con
tact with a 5000 volt capacitor which
was partially charged.
Hawley's research concerned the
application of high voltage electric
discharges to supersonic gas flows.
Hawley had just begun an experiment
when he touched the capacitor, an
electrical apparatus which stores elec
trical energy.
"It's all presumption right now, but
we think he went to either put on or
take off the capacitor. We suspect he
was tired and forgot it was charged,"
said Robert Beth, University director
of Insurance/Risk Management.
Hawley's girlfriend and Alan Stan

ton, a mechanical engineering
graduate student, were also in the
laboratory. According to Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Robert Eustis, they
were not watching Hawley when the
accident happened.
High voltage lead
Eustis thought that "he must have
touched a lead still at high voltage
which he didn't remember to turn
down."
John Barr, assistant Stanford fire
chief, said "thecapacitor was charged,
and Hawley had some contact with it."
So far there is no evidence to indi
cate that any of the equipment in the
experiment was defective. "The
equipment was not faulty and we think
the power was off. There were shields
for the major components; however,
the capacitor was not supposed to be
shielded or he wouldn't have been able
to conduct the experiment," Beth exp
lained.
Laboratory sealed
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Of
fice has sealed the laboratory pending
the investigation. A coroner of Santa
Clara County has already examined

the laboratory. The Industrial Division
of the state Department of Health and
Safety was also notified yesterday
morning.
Beth stated, "They were called at
about 4 a.m. and their reaction at this
time is that they would not be coining
in to investigate. They would have to
investigate under state law if Hawley
was an employe."
However, Eustis said, "we would
welcome the state safety department's
investigation."
Following regulations
According to Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Morton Mitchner, Hawley's
advisor. Hawley was following all
regulations, which included the re
quirement that at least one other per
son be in the room while an experi
ment is being conducted.
"We try to encourage students to do
their work during the daytime, but
they can work on the weekend if
another person is present," said
Mitchner.
One irony in this tragedy is that a
laboratory safety committee had been
formed last week. Memos concerning
safety were sent to all students doing
research in the laboratories.
Concern about high voltages
"We're concerned about the hjgh
voltages being used and the committee
has the power to shut down any exper
iments which don't meet the safety re
quirements," noted Eustis.
Because these are research experi
ments, none of the equipment is avail
able from manufacturers. Hawlev and

other students "design the equipment
and build the entire device," noted
Beth.
Firefighters and paramedics were
unable to resuscitate Hawley. He was
pronounced dead at Stanford Hospital.
Hawley's family lives near New
Haven. Conn. A University of Chicago
graduate in physics. Hawley was de
scribed as a good student by Eustis.
Hawley, 27, lived in Atherton. His
extracurricular activities included in
tramural basketball.
The effects of this accident on exper
iments in other departments are un
known. The Safety and Health Divi
sion expects to have a report by tomor
row morning.

AGAINST THE CLOCK — Firefighters battle the odds, attempting to revive
physics graduate student Charles Hawley, who was electrocuted early yester
day in the Gasdynamics Laboratory. Rescuers were unable to resuscitate him;
Hawley was working with laser equipment when the incident occurred.
