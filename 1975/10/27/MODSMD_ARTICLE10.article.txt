I would like to comment on
Alphonse Juilland's two part
column (Daily, Oct. 22-23)
which he wrote in the defense of
conservatism. I consider myself
neither liberal nor conservative;
I am only a spectator.
Some of juilland's assertions
and a part of his logical
framework seem very sound to
me, but I would like to point out
what 1 consider to be a few logi
cal blunders.
When refuting Edith Efron's
statement that conservatives
"cannot grasp the primacy of the
human mind . . . its right to flout
tradition if that tradition is fatu
ous or irrational " he asserts
that this implies an assumption
on Efron's part that a tradition
exists which is not "fatuous or
irrational "
Why? Although Efron may
have intended such an implica
tion, there are certainly other al
ternatives.
Why not accept a state without
tradition, or, more realistically,
one of constantly changing trad
ition as ideal? Either could be
accepted axiomatically.
Juilland is showing his proc
livity for stasis, which, I sup
pose. is to be expected from a
hard-core conservative.
Then in reprimanding Tim
Ferguson for criticizing a con
servative simultaneously for the
latter's religious commitments
and typical economic self
centeredness, juilland commits
the same horrible act of petitio
principii for which he indicts
Efron earlier.
He assumes in his major pre
mise (which is implied) that the
two sets of ethics cannot exist in
one individual at one point in
time. Obviously the point is just
that paradox, the simultaneity
of two moral standpoints seem
ingly at odds, the criticism is not
directed at one characteristic or
the other.
I agree that any system of
thought must have as its ulti
mate basis some set of axioms or
assumptions. But a process for
dealing with those axioms must
also be assumed. It need not be
logic. Aristotelian or otherwise.
As Fyodor Dostoyevsky once
showed, a system of thought (or
the lack thereof) can be based en
tirely on whim, an arational pro
cess. I might point out here that
both Juilland and I assume a ra
tional framework, otherwise
there would be no reason to dis
cuss the matter. William F.
Buckley's problem is that he
knows that his axioms are cor
rect in an absolute sense, ipso
facto, u priori, ad nauseam — he
is possessed of the priceless
"jewelers eye."
As I see it conservatism shares
one aspect with all other systems
of thought: it is moot.

two sets of ethics cannot exist in
one individual at one point in
time. Obviously the point is just
that paradox, the simultaneity
of two moral standpoints seem
ingly at odds, the criticism is not
directed at one characteristic or
the other.
I agree that any system of
thought must have as its ulti
mate basis some set of axioms or
assumptions. But a process for
dealing with those axioms must
also be assumed. It need not be
logic. Aristotelian or otherwise.
As Fyodor Dostoyevsky once
showed, a system of thought (or
the lack thereof) can be based en
tirely on whim, an arational pro
cess. I might point out here that
both Juilland and I assume a ra
tional framework, otherwise
there would be no reason to dis
cuss the matter. William F.
Buckley's problem is that he
knows that his axioms are cor
rect in an absolute sense, ipso
facto, u priori, ad nauseam — he
is possessed of the priceless
"jewelers eye."
As I see it conservatism shares
one aspect with all other systems
of thought: it is moot.

I would like to comment on
Alphonse Juilland's two part
column (Daily, Oct. 22-23)
which he wrote in the defense of
conservatism. I consider myself
neither liberal nor conservative;
I am only a spectator.
Some of juilland's assertions
and a part of his logical
framework seem very sound to
me, but I would like to point out
what 1 consider to be a few logi
cal blunders.
When refuting Edith Efron's
statement that conservatives
"cannot grasp the primacy of the
human mind . . . its right to flout
tradition if that tradition is fatu
ous or irrational " he asserts
that this implies an assumption
on Efron's part that a tradition
exists which is not "fatuous or
irrational "
Why? Although Efron may
have intended such an implica
tion, there are certainly other al
ternatives.
Why not accept a state without
tradition, or, more realistically,
one of constantly changing trad
ition as ideal? Either could be
accepted axiomatically.
Juilland is showing his proc
livity for stasis, which, I sup
pose. is to be expected from a
hard-core conservative.
Then in reprimanding Tim
Ferguson for criticizing a con
servative simultaneously for the
latter's religious commitments
and typical economic self
centeredness, juilland commits
the same horrible act of petitio
principii for which he indicts
Efron earlier.
He assumes in his major pre
mise (which is implied) that the
two sets of ethics cannot exist in
one individual at one point in
time. Obviously the point is just
that paradox, the simultaneity
of two moral standpoints seem
ingly at odds, the criticism is not
directed at one characteristic or
the other.

mate basis some set of axioms or
