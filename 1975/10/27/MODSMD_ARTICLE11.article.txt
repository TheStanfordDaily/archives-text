# Placement Center to start peer counseling for students wishing to 'stop out' of school
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
You've gone to school for 13
years. You face four years of col
lege, perhaps four years of
graduate school and you wonder
if you can ever take a break from
it all. Where do you go? Who do
you see?
In an attempt to provide some
answers, the Career Planning
and Placement Center is setting
up a peer counseling service
next quarter for students think
ing about taking time off from
school for work experience,
travel or a study break.
Meanwhile, the Placement
Center is sponsoring an informal
program on "Stopping Out:
What For and How To" next
Wednesday, 4:30 p.m., at Bow
man Alumni House.
"The purpose of the peer
counseling is not to encourage
stopping out, but to provide a
staff of people who understand
the thoughts going through stu
dents' minds," said program
coordinator Pam Evans, director
of student employment at the
Placement Center.
First time
Evans explained that until
now, "There was no one office
that dealt with it (stopping out)."
Evans is organizing the coun
seling program with the help of
two paid students who both
stopped out of Stanford, seniors
Chris Roche and Ed Cotter.
Through SCIRE, Roche and

Cotter plan to publish a book on
stopping out explaining "who
you see for what" and contain
ing twelve essays on stop out ex
periences.
Evans cited many reasons why
students want to stop out.
"It could be a disagreeable
roommate, finances, the desire
to go to another school or just a
chance to get their heads
straight," she said.
'Not always good'
"It's not always good to stop
out, especially if a student uses it
to escape from reality," she
added.
If a student does have definite
plans with what to do once he
has stopped out, he still needs to
find out about his academic
standing, what to do about his
scholarships, how many, if any,
of his credits earned outside of
Stanford can be applied to his
major and if any of his work ex
perience can be credited, Evans
observed.
Roche stopped out at the end
of her junior year and considered
working a study break and a
chance to "make money."
Stoppng out "wasn't difficult
at all," she said. "As long as
you're in good standing with the
University, You just don't show
up on registration day."
To return, "you send the Uni
versity a letter a month before,
you come back," Roche said.

Roche cautioned that it might
be a "good idea to look up the
credit you need for your major"
before leaving.
Roche, Evans and Cotter are
gathering information and de
ciding on peer counselor re
quirements.
To prepare themselves for the
peer counseling program, Roche
and Cotter took a no-credit basic
attending skills class last spring
from Dr. Vince D'Andrea,
psychologist at the Bridge.
"Counselors would have to
have taken a counseling course
at the Bridge or through the
Learning Assistance Center
(LAC)," Roche said.
Starting next quarter, counsel
ing skills courses offered
through LAC can be taken for
credit, she added.
Evans said she hopes coun
selors will be split "50-50" bet
ween those who did and did not
stop out. "Those who haven't
stopped out can empathize with
students, also." she said.
Exploring feelings
"With counseling, you don't
try to convince people to do any
thing. Rather, you help them ex
plore their feelings about stop
ping out," said Roche.
Senior Bill Lubart, who stop
ped out after his sophomore
year, said that many times stu
dents fear stopping out because
"they and their parents equate it

with dropping out. Parents are
afraid their kids won't go back."
A transfer from the University
of Pennsylvania, Lubart stopped
out quite by chance.
"I'd always seen myself as a
perpetual student. I was scared
of going to work. I never thought
of stopping out," he said.
A communications job in
Washington, D.C. with the Na
tional Association of Broadcast
ing attracted his attention and he
worked there for a year.
Self-confidence
"1 developed a lot of self con
fidence," said Lubart.
"I was able to hold my own
with older people in a working
situation. I was thinking as an
equal with them. My job gave me
insight into organizational
dynamics â€” how people interact
and how decisions are made in a

business environment."
Lubart came to Stanford to
take advantage of the communi
cation department and has de
cided to go to business school to
get management and adminis
trative training.
Stanford "is a wonderland.
Students have little concept of
life on the outside," said Lubart.
Lubart sees himself as a re
source person in the peer coun
seling program. As coordinating
director of residence of Toyon
Hall this year, he said he has no
time to be formally involved, but
would be willing to talk to peo
ple referred to him.
It is important for students to
"figure out early what they're
doing," said Lubart. "Stopping
out is not worthwhile if the stu
dent is not moving towards a
goal."
