# Gays discuss myths, role in society

### DANA CURRY 
Homosexuals, particularly
lesbians, are suppressed because
they are a threat to society and to
the nuclear family, according to
two representatives of the Gay
People's Union who spoke at
Tresidder Thursday.
Speaking to approximately 50
people, Donna Hughes-
Oldenburg and Larry Goldyn
discussed myths and social and
political aspects of homosexual
ity in the second of a series of
conversations sponsored by the
Tresidder Program Board.
"Lesbianism is a double threat
. . . . not only are we queer, we
are women. We are an affirma
tion of women in a culture that
despises and abuses women, we

are a blow to the male ego," said
Hughes-Oldenburg, a lesbian
feminist.
She added that conservative
lesbians view lesbianism as just
a sexual preference, but "it's a
political choice too."
'Potential for love'
Addressing the theme of
homophobia (fear of homosexu
als and homosexuality). Goldyn
said that society is afraid be
cause homosxuals have a secret,
which is that "humans have the
potential for love."
Among the myths that society
perpetuates, said Goldyn, is the
idea that "homosexual love is
unnatural or pathological.
Psychiatrists, for example, al
ways ask, "How did he

become . . . ?"
"What is the basis of love? If it
were just procreation, then
homosexual love would be un
natural â€” but the purpose is not
just procreation."
Another myth, he continued,
"is that homosexuals are un
happy, lonely, and seek solace.
They do, but so does everyone
else."
Not condemned
A third myth, he said, is that
"homosexuality is universally
condemned. Actually, h4 per
cent of the societies on earth
condone homosexuality in some
form."
"One positive side of Gay
Lib," he concluded, "is that we
can show straight men that it's

OK to cry and show other
'feminine' qualities."
In response to the observation
that gay men are more promis
cuous than gay women, Goldyn
said "that is true because they ae
men, not because they are gay.
Men in general are more promis
cuous."
Asked about homosexuals'
uneasiness over bisexual indi
viduals, Goldyn remarked that
bisexuality "is sometimes a
cop-out."
Both speakers mentioned the
possibility of getting "emotion
ally ripped off" by bisexual or
straight people who want to
"find out where they are sexu
ally."
