## Scotchers tie San Jose St. 
### JOHN ROOS 
SAN JOSE — The Stanford field hockey team fought its way to a
1-1 tieagainst San Jose State Saturday. Both scores came in first half
play.
Both teams were poised while at the same time extremely aggres
sive in what looks to be a preview to next month's Regional Tour
nament.
But Stanford coaches and players were disappointed with the
outcome of the match. "It was a disappointing tie but San Jose just
played so well," said Coach Shirley Schoof.

Stanford took control of the
game early in the first half, un
-1 ike last weeks game against Sac
ramento State in which the
Cards didn't come alive until the
second half. Fifteen minutes into
the game, Onnie Killefer scored
a goal and Stanford seemed to be
on its way to its third straight
victory of the season. Cathy
Levinson, Jessie Gerrard and
Mandy Read provided addi
tional spark to the Cards' of
fense.
Total domination
"They completely dominated
the first half," San Jose Coach
Lita Walter explained.
But two discounted Stanford
goals and one disputed San Jose
score were "too much for the
team to handle," according to
Schoof.
"We totally fell apart in the
second half," commented player
Sukie Jackson. "Our mistakes
made us lose our momentum."
Walter disagreed. The Spartan
coach felt that the difference be
tween the two halves was that
San Jose was "ready to play our
own game in the second half."
Scoreless half
The result was a scoreless 35
minutes of play. Stanford failed
to get the ball into the Spartans'
circle after another Stanford
goal. this one by Cathy Levinson,
was discounted because of an
offside penalty.
So the question as to which
team is number one in northern
California remains unanswered.
With only three games left before
the Regionals, Assistant Coach
Carla Soracco feels that the
Cards are "still learning things
that cause us to execute not as
quickly as we'd like."
The JV's lost 4-1 to the San Jose
JV team. Helen Hunt scored the
only Card goal.

The result was a scoreless 35
minutes of play. Stanford failed
to get the ball into the Spartans'
circle after another Stanford
goal. this one by Cathy Levinson,
was discounted because of an
offside penalty.
So the question as to which
team is number one in northern
California remains unanswered.
With only three games left before
the Regionals, Assistant Coach
Carla Soracco feels that the
Cards are "still learning things
that cause us to execute not as
quickly as we'd like."
The JV's lost 4-1 to the San Jose
JV team. Helen Hunt scored the
only Card goal.

SAN JOSE — The Stanford field hockey team fought its way to a
1-1 tieagainst San Jose State Saturday. Both scores came in first half
play.
Both teams were poised while at the same time extremely aggres
sive in what looks to be a preview to next month's Regional Tour
nament.
But Stanford coaches and players were disappointed with the
outcome of the match. "It was a disappointing tie but San Jose just
played so well," said Coach Shirley Schoof.

Stanford took control of the
game early in the first half, un
-1 ike last weeks game against Sac
ramento State in which the
Cards didn't come alive until the
second half. Fifteen minutes into
the game, Onnie Killefer scored
a goal and Stanford seemed to be
on its way to its third straight
victory of the season. Cathy
Levinson, Jessie Gerrard and
Mandy Read provided addi
tional spark to the Cards' of
fense.
Total domination
"They completely dominated
the first half," San Jose Coach
Lita Walter explained.
But two discounted Stanford
goals and one disputed San Jose
score were "too much for the
team to handle," according to
Schoof.
"We totally fell apart in the
second half," commented player
Sukie Jackson. "Our mistakes
made us lose our momentum."
Walter disagreed. The Spartan
coach felt that the difference be
tween the two halves was that
San Jose was "ready to play our
own game in the second half."
