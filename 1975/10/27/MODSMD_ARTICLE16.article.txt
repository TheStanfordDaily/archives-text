# Pac-8 roundup
## Big UCLA win 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
The circumstances may vary
every year, but the result inevit
ably seems the same. For the
umpteenth time, it could be
UCLA vs. USC for the Pacific-
Eight championship.
The Bruins declared them
selves the leading challengers to
USC by defeating California,
28-14, Saturday before a misera
ble crowd of 36,100 at the Los
Angeles Coliseum. Only UCLA
and USC are still unbeaten in
Pac-8 play.
The key plays were two first
half turnovers by the Bears
which led to a pair of UCLA
touchdowns. "I told the players
all week long that mistakes
would beat us against a team like
this," said Cal Coach Mike
White, "and yet it happened.
What else is there to say?"
UCLA's rushing game again
provided most of the Bruins' of
fense, led by Wendell Tyler's
143 yards. Quarterback John
Sciarra found it necessary to
pass only eight times, complet
ing four.
On the brighter side for Cal,
Chuck Muncie rushed for 126
yards on 26 carries, and Steve
Rivera caught 10 passes for 154
yards. Cal quarterback Joe Roth,
completed 17 of 31 passes for
226 yards.
USC remained undefeated by
coming from behind three times
to defeat rival Notre Dame,
24-17, in South Bend, Ind. Tro
jan fullback Ricky Bell carried
the ball 40 times for 165 yards,
while quarterback Vince Evans

completed only three of 11 pas
ses for 42 yards. USC's defense
made the offense's job easier by
limiting Notre Dame to 168 total
yards and only 25 in the air.
James Anderson rushed for
102 yards and two touchdowns
to lead Washington to a 35-7 vic
tory over the winless Oregon
State Beavers (0-7). Oregon State
aided the Huskies by turning the
ball over five times. The Beavers'
only score came on a 47-yard run
by quarterback Kyle Grossart.
Oregon (1-6) broke a 14-game
losing streak by defeating Utah
(1-5), 18-7, before a basketball
game-sized crowd of 10,500 in
Eugene. The only pertinent
question resulting from this
classic match-up of pow
erhouses is, who could Utah
have possibly beaten?
