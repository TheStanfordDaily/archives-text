# Cards outrun Cougars in 54-14 rout
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
After Stanford's persuasive
54-14 trouncing of Washington
State Saturday, the exploits of
Ron Inge and the rest of the Car
dinal running backs didn't get as
much attention as they might
have.
It wasn't as if the Stanford
runners hadn't been astounding.
The Cards, who last year sur
prised no one by finishing last in
the Pacific Eight in rushing, had
just run over and around the
Cougars for 395 yards, an all
time Stanford game record.
And Card Coach Jack Christ
iansen started his post-game
conference with some extraor
dinary praise for halfback Inge,
who had dodged defenders and
emerged several times from
masses of would-be tacklers on a
77-yard touchdown run in the
second quarter. Inge had 76
more rushing yards for the best
day of his Stanford career.
But before too long the repor
ters were after Coach Chris about
his most un-favorite question:
the Cardinal quarterback situa
tion. This week, Chris' question
ers seemed even more confused
than usual.
Good reasons
They had reasons. Mike Cor
dova, whom Christiansen likes
to refer to as simply "the starting
quarterback," had been at the
helm during the Cards' first two
touchdown drives. but
Stanford's 14-0 lead could be
more fairly attributed to Inge. He
took a Cordova swing pass and
rambled for 11 yards behind per
fect blocking to score the first
Stanford TD, and in the middle
of the second quarter took off on
his 77-yard run.
The less Cordova threw, the

better the Cards seemed to move
the ball. The Stanford student
section even experimented with
cheering sarcastically every time
one of Cordova's passes missed,
but they seemed to be applaud
ing in earnest during a minute
long standing ovation for Guy
Benjamin, who replaced Cor
dova late in the first half.
With a little more than three
minutes left in the half and the
ball on the Cardinal six, Benja
min had a chance to test his
mid-week assertion that he was a
better passer and team leader
than Cordova.
Worked like magic
Whatever Benjamin did dif
ferently from the starting quar
terback, it seemed to work. By
the time the fans had recovered
from the surprise of his first play,
a quarterback draw with bad
kneed Benjamin running for four
yards, they were watching Ben
jamin roll out of the pocket and
connect on a 53-yard bomb to
flanker Tony Hill.
On the next play split end Bill
Singler ran a perfect flag pattern,
and Benjamin, with plenty of
time, drilled the ball to Singler
just as he stepped into the front
corner of the end zone. The fans

responded with another stand
ing ovation.
Meanwhile, the Card defen
ders had given lots of ground to
the Cougars'veer offense, but the
visitors had demonstrated
enough of a propensity to fum
ble, throw interceptions and lose
penalty yardage that they didn't
seem capable of threatening the
Cards at all.
Second-half starter
So one of the more bewilder
ing sights of this Stanford foot
ball season was Mike Cordova's
trotting back onto the field on
Stanford's first offensive series
in the second half. If anything,
he looked a little worse than he
had in the first half.
Still, the Cards kept rolling up
the score: they averaged over 10
yards per rushing play and were
helped by such Cougar errors as
successive fumbles at the
Washington State 34- and
16-yard lines. Cordova ran the
ball in himself after the latter
fumble, but, after four straight
incompletions, had inspired
boos from the alumni section
and cheers from the students,
Benjamin came in again.
How could Christiansen exp
lain the quarterback exchange?

"It's a real pleasure to have three
outstanding quarterbacks," he
began, "and know all of them
can do a good job."
But that wasn't quite what the
reporters wanted to hear. "I
think I've figured out now,"
Chris added, "when to leave the
starting quarterback in and
when to take him out." But
Christiansen was about to make
what seemed a more startling re
velation.
A sore arm?
"Mike Cordova has a sore
arm," said the coach. "None of
the players ever tell me when
they're hurt, and I don't expect
them to. But Mike's arm has been
bothering him all week, so when
he went out there and didn't
throw well, I had to assume he
was hurt. So 1 took him out."
But why had Cordova reap
peared in the second half? "We
had him throwing during half
time, and during the warinup 1
thought his motion looked good.
But in the game it seemed to
tighten up on him again, and he
didn't throw well, so 1 made the
decision to take him out again."
If there was a real injury,
though, Cordova seemed bent on
concealing it from more than

Coach Chris. "Who told you I
was hurt?" Cordova said in the
locker room. "I've been healthy
all year." He denied that he had
been throwing any differently
Saturday than he had in other
games this season.
Another beauty
At any rate, Benjamin's first
second-half pass was a 29-yard
touchdown strike thrown to
Tony Hill, who seemed to be per
fectly double-teamed at the back
of the end zone. "It couldn't have
been thrown any better," said
Hill, the Pac-B's leading receiver
with 36 catches.
On the next series, Benjamin
didn't have to throw a pass to
lead the Cards to a touchdown.
Sophomore halfback Cary Lynn,
at 5-foot-9, 175-pounds one of
the Cards' smallest performers,
high-stepped his way to a
53-yard touchdown run. Late in
the final quarter Lynn, who
wasn't even on the Cards'
48-man traveling roster for the
Washington game, scored
another touchdown to give the
Cards their 40-point lead.
And Tony Hill's analysis of
the quarterback problem? "Just
let whoever's in there throw it to
me, and I'll catch it,"he said.
After Stanford's persuasive
54-14 trouncing of Washington

Ron Inge and the rest of the Car
dinal running backs didn't get as

48-man traveling roster for the
Washington game, scored
another touchdown to give the
Cards their 40-point lead.
And Tony Hill's analysis of
the quarterback problem? "Just
let whoever's in there throw it to
me, and I'll catch it,"he said.
After Stanford's persuasive
54-14 trouncing of Washington
State Saturday, the exploits of
Ron Inge and the rest of the Car
dinal running backs didn't get as
much attention as they might
have.
It wasn't as if the Stanford
runners hadn't been astounding.
The Cards, who last year sur
prised no one by finishing last in
the Pacific Eight in rushing, had
just run over and around the
Cougars for 395 yards, an all
time Stanford game record.
And Card Coach Jack Christ
iansen started his post-game
conference with some extraor
dinary praise for halfback Inge,
who had dodged defenders and
emerged several times from
masses of would-be tacklers on a
77-yard touchdown run in the
second quarter. Inge had 76
more rushing yards for the best
day of his Stanford career.
But before too long the repor
ters were after Coach Chris about
his most un-favorite question:
the Cardinal quarterback situa
tion. This week, Chris' question
ers seemed even more confused
than usual.
Good reasons
They had reasons. Mike Cor
dova, whom Christiansen likes
to refer to as simply "the starting
quarterback," had been at the
helm during the Cards' first two
touchdown drives. but
Stanford's 14-0 lead could be
more fairly attributed to Inge. He
took a Cordova swing pass and
rambled for 11 yards behind per
fect blocking to score the first
Stanford TD, and in the middle
of the second quarter took off on
his 77-yard run.
The less Cordova threw, the

better the Cards seemed to move
the ball. The Stanford student
section even experimented with
cheering sarcastically every time
one of Cordova's passes missed,
but they seemed to be applaud
ing in earnest during a minute
long standing ovation for Guy
Benjamin, who replaced Cor
dova late in the first half.
With a little more than three
minutes left in the half and the
ball on the Cardinal six, Benja
min had a chance to test his
mid-week assertion that he was a
better passer and team leader
than Cordova.
Worked like magic
Whatever Benjamin did dif
ferently from the starting quar
terback, it seemed to work. By
the time the fans had recovered
from the surprise of his first play,
a quarterback draw with bad
kneed Benjamin running for four
yards, they were watching Ben
jamin roll out of the pocket and
connect on a 53-yard bomb to
flanker Tony Hill.
On the next play split end Bill
Singler ran a perfect flag pattern,
and Benjamin, with plenty of
time, drilled the ball to Singler
just as he stepped into the front
corner of the end zone. The fans

responded with another stand
ing ovation.
Meanwhile, the Card defen
ders had given lots of ground to
the Cougars'veer offense, but the
visitors had demonstrated
enough of a propensity to fum
ble, throw interceptions and lose
penalty yardage that they didn't
seem capable of threatening the
Cards at all.
Second-half starter
So one of the more bewilder
ing sights of this Stanford foot
ball season was Mike Cordova's
trotting back onto the field on
Stanford's first offensive series
in the second half. If anything,
he looked a little worse than he
had in the first half.
Still, the Cards kept rolling up
the score: they averaged over 10
yards per rushing play and were
helped by such Cougar errors as
successive fumbles at the
Washington State 34- and
16-yard lines. Cordova ran the
ball in himself after the latter
fumble, but, after four straight
incompletions, had inspired
boos from the alumni section
and cheers from the students,
Benjamin came in again.
How could Christiansen exp
lain the quarterback exchange?

"It's a real pleasure to have three
outstanding quarterbacks," he
began, "and know all of them
can do a good job."
But that wasn't quite what the
reporters wanted to hear. "I
think I've figured out now,"
Chris added, "when to leave the
starting quarterback in and
when to take him out." But
Christiansen was about to make
what seemed a more startling re
velation.
A sore arm?
"Mike Cordova has a sore
arm," said the coach. "None of
the players ever tell me when
they're hurt, and I don't expect
them to. But Mike's arm has been
bothering him all week, so when
he went out there and didn't
throw well, I had to assume he
was hurt. So 1 took him out."
But why had Cordova reap
peared in the second half? "We
had him throwing during half
time, and during the warinup 1
thought his motion looked good.
But in the game it seemed to
tighten up on him again, and he
didn't throw well, so 1 made the
decision to take him out again."
If there was a real injury,
though, Cordova seemed bent on
concealing it from more than

Coach Chris. "Who told you I
was hurt?" Cordova said in the
locker room. "I've been healthy
all year." He denied that he had
been throwing any differently
Saturday than he had in other
games this season.
Another beauty
At any rate, Benjamin's first
second-half pass was a 29-yard
touchdown strike thrown to
Tony Hill, who seemed to be per
fectly double-teamed at the back
of the end zone. "It couldn't have
been thrown any better," said
Hill, the Pac-B's leading receiver
with 36 catches.
On the next series, Benjamin
didn't have to throw a pass to
lead the Cards to a touchdown.
Sophomore halfback Cary Lynn,
at 5-foot-9, 175-pounds one of
the Cards' smallest performers,
high-stepped his way to a
53-yard touchdown run. Late in
the final quarter Lynn, who
wasn't even on the Cards'
48-man traveling roster for the
Washington game, scored
another touchdown to give the
Cards their 40-point lead.
And Tony Hill's analysis of

at 5-foot-9, 175-pounds one of
the Cards' smallest performers,
high-stepped his way to a
53-yard touchdown run. Late in
the final quarter Lynn, who
wasn't even on the Cards'
48-man traveling roster for the
Washington game, scored
another touchdown to give the
Cards their 40-point lead.
And Tony Hill's analysis of
the quarterback problem? "Just
let whoever's in there throw it to
me, and I'll catch it,"he said.
After Stanford's persuasive
54-14 trouncing of Washington
State Saturday, the exploits of
Ron Inge and the rest of the Car
dinal running backs didn't get as
much attention as they might
have.
It wasn't as if the Stanford
runners hadn't been astounding.
The Cards, who last year sur
prised no one by finishing last in
the Pacific Eight in rushing, had
just run over and around the
Cougars for 395 yards, an all
time Stanford game record.
And Card Coach Jack Christ
iansen started his post-game
conference with some extraor
dinary praise for halfback Inge,
who had dodged defenders and
emerged several times from
masses of would-be tacklers on a
77-yard touchdown run in the
second quarter. Inge had 76
more rushing yards for the best
day of his Stanford career.
But before too long the repor
ters were after Coach Chris about
his most un-favorite question:
the Cardinal quarterback situa
tion. This week, Chris' question
ers seemed even more confused
than usual.
Good reasons
They had reasons. Mike Cor
dova, whom Christiansen likes
to refer to as simply "the starting
quarterback," had been at the
helm during the Cards' first two
touchdown drives. but
Stanford's 14-0 lead could be
more fairly attributed to Inge. He
took a Cordova swing pass and
rambled for 11 yards behind per
fect blocking to score the first
Stanford TD, and in the middle
of the second quarter took off on
his 77-yard run.
The less Cordova threw, the

better the Cards seemed to move
the ball. The Stanford student
section even experimented with
cheering sarcastically every time
one of Cordova's passes missed,
but they seemed to be applaud
ing in earnest during a minute
long standing ovation for Guy
Benjamin, who replaced Cor
dova late in the first half.
With a little more than three
minutes left in the half and the
ball on the Cardinal six, Benja
min had a chance to test his
mid-week assertion that he was a
better passer and team leader
than Cordova.
Worked like magic
Whatever Benjamin did dif
ferently from the starting quar
terback, it seemed to work. By
the time the fans had recovered
from the surprise of his first play,
a quarterback draw with bad
kneed Benjamin running for four
yards, they were watching Ben
jamin roll out of the pocket and
connect on a 53-yard bomb to
flanker Tony Hill.
On the next play split end Bill
Singler ran a perfect flag pattern,
and Benjamin, with plenty of
time, drilled the ball to Singler
just as he stepped into the front
corner of the end zone. The fans

responded with another stand
ing ovation.
Meanwhile, the Card defen
ders had given lots of ground to
the Cougars'veer offense, but the
visitors had demonstrated
enough of a propensity to fum
ble, throw interceptions and lose
penalty yardage that they didn't
seem capable of threatening the
Cards at all.
Second-half starter
So one of the more bewilder
ing sights of this Stanford foot
ball season was Mike Cordova's
trotting back onto the field on
Stanford's first offensive series
in the second half. If anything,
he looked a little worse than he
had in the first half.
Still, the Cards kept rolling up
the score: they averaged over 10
yards per rushing play and were
helped by such Cougar errors as
successive fumbles at the
Washington State 34- and
16-yard lines. Cordova ran the
ball in himself after the latter
fumble, but, after four straight
incompletions, had inspired
boos from the alumni section
and cheers from the students,
Benjamin came in again.
How could Christiansen exp
lain the quarterback exchange?

"It's a real pleasure to have three
outstanding quarterbacks," he
began, "and know all of them
can do a good job."
But that wasn't quite what the
reporters wanted to hear. "I
think I've figured out now,"
Chris added, "when to leave the
starting quarterback in and
when to take him out." But
Christiansen was about to make
what seemed a more startling re
velation.
A sore arm?
"Mike Cordova has a sore
arm," said the coach. "None of
the players ever tell me when
they're hurt, and I don't expect
them to. But Mike's arm has been
bothering him all week, so when
he went out there and didn't
throw well, I had to assume he
was hurt. So 1 took him out."
But why had Cordova reap
peared in the second half? "We
had him throwing during half
time, and during the warinup 1
thought his motion looked good.
But in the game it seemed to
tighten up on him again, and he
didn't throw well, so 1 made the
decision to take him out again."
If there was a real injury,
though, Cordova seemed bent on
concealing it from more than

Coach Chris. "Who told you I
was hurt?" Cordova said in the
locker room. "I've been healthy
all year." He denied that he had
been throwing any differently
Saturday than he had in other
games this season.
Another beauty
At any rate, Benjamin's first
second-half pass was a 29-yard
touchdown strike thrown to
Tony Hill, who seemed to be per
fectly double-teamed at the back
of the end zone. "It couldn't have
been thrown any better," said
Hill, the Pac-B's leading receiver
with 36 catches.
On the next series, Benjamin
didn't have to throw a pass to
lead the Cards to a touchdown.
Sophomore halfback Cary Lynn,
at 5-foot-9, 175-pounds one of
the Cards' smallest performers,
high-stepped his way to a

been thrown any better," said
Hill, the Pac-B's leading receiver
with 36 catches.
On the next series, Benjamin
didn't have to throw a pass to
lead the Cards to a touchdown.
Sophomore halfback Cary Lynn,
at 5-foot-9, 175-pounds one of
the Cards' smallest performers,
high-stepped his way to a
53-yard touchdown run. Late in
the final quarter Lynn, who
wasn't even on the Cards'
48-man traveling roster for the
Washington game, scored
another touchdown to give the
Cards their 40-point lead.
And Tony Hill's analysis of
the quarterback problem? "Just
let whoever's in there throw it to
me, and I'll catch it,"he said.
