# Poloists continue win streak
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
The Stanford water polo team ran its win
ning string to 14-straight and its season re
cord to 14-1, but not before Coach Art Lam
bert had a few gray hairs as his Card team
narrowly defeated Long Beach State and UC
Irvine.
Even though the Cards, who are 2-0 in
Pacific-8 play, took a break from their
league schedule, they had to scratch their
way to 8-7 and 9-7 wins over Long Beach
State and Irvine, respectively.
"This game will be the real indication of
how well we can play against Irvine. In our
first game, the NCAA was in the midst of a
lot of rule changes that confused us," Lam
bert predicted before the game.
And indeed it was. Irvine, the only team
to hand Stanford a loss this season, proved
to be as tough as when Stanford first met
them. It was not until Rick Johannsen
scored with 50 seconds left and goalie
Christ Dorst preserved the 9-7 Cardinal lead
with two blocks in the final seconds when
Irvine had a man advantage, that the Cards
got their 14th straight win.
It looked as though defense might be the

key to the game, as Irvine was called for two
45-second possession violations at the
game's outset due to the Cardinal defense.
The first score of the contest didn't come
until halfway through the first quarter as
Johannsen sprinted down the pool ahead of
the pack for the goal. Irvine, however,
scored on a penalty shot, but Stanford then
countered with a Marty Davis goal with
three seconds remaining on the first quarter
clock.
The second quarter saw Irvine come back
at 3-3, as it seemed to do consistently
throughout the game, but again a Davis
score gave the Card team a little breathing
room and a 5-3 halftime lead.
Two Stanford goals within four minutes
by team captain John Roberts in the second
half finished off Irvine and gave Stanford a
7-5 lead after Irvine had once again tied the
score at 5-5.
"We had a fine game offensively but
seemed a little mixed up on defense. Paul
Clarke played a superb game. Irvine, who I
would say is one of the top teams around,
stayed in it all the way," said Lambert.
The Cards offense featured a balanced

scoring attack paced by Davis, Johannsen
and Drew McDonald with two goals apiece.
Stanford, however, almost didn't meet Ir
vine with a 13-1 record as the previous day,
Long Beach State shocked the Cards by scor
ing five fourth quarter goals but losing, 8-7.
The Cardinals had built up a seemingly in
surmountable 6-0 halftime lead, with
freshman Paul Burke accounting for half of
the first half Cardinal tallies. For Long
Beach State, Olympic star Tim Shaw tallied
two goals.
"We were looking ahead to Irvine. That is
the only way we could give up so many
goals in the last quarter. Also, Roberts was
absent, and I pulled Clarke out of the game
in the second quarter. I also wanted to rest
Dorst so I played Frank Forencich at
goalie," Lambert explained.
Stanford resumes its quest for a Pac-8
championship next Friday against USC.
According to Lambert, the Trojans, who the
Cards have yet to meet in regular season
competition, are a sol id team against which
Stanford will have to play a little more con
sistently than last weekend in order to raise
their league record to a perfect 3-0.

ning string to 14-straight and its season re
cord to 14-1, but not before Coach Art Lam
bert had a few gray hairs as his Card team
narrowly defeated Long Beach State and UC
Irvine.
Even though the Cards, who are 2-0 in
Pacific-8 play, took a break from their
league schedule, they had to scratch their
way to 8-7 and 9-7 wins over Long Beach
State and Irvine, respectively.
"This game will be the real indication of
how well we can play against Irvine. In our
first game, the NCAA was in the midst of a
lot of rule changes that confused us," Lam
bert predicted before the game.
And indeed it was. Irvine, the only team
to hand Stanford a loss this season, proved
to be as tough as when Stanford first met
them. It was not until Rick Johannsen
scored with 50 seconds left and goalie
Christ Dorst preserved the 9-7 Cardinal lead
with two blocks in the final seconds when
Irvine had a man advantage, that the Cards
got their 14th straight win.
It looked as though defense might be the

key to the game, as Irvine was called for two
45-second possession violations at the
game's outset due to the Cardinal defense.
The first score of the contest didn't come
until halfway through the first quarter as
Johannsen sprinted down the pool ahead of
the pack for the goal. Irvine, however,
scored on a penalty shot, but Stanford then
countered with a Marty Davis goal with
three seconds remaining on the first quarter
clock.
The second quarter saw Irvine come back
at 3-3, as it seemed to do consistently
throughout the game, but again a Davis
score gave the Card team a little breathing
room and a 5-3 halftime lead.
Two Stanford goals within four minutes
by team captain John Roberts in the second
half finished off Irvine and gave Stanford a
7-5 lead after Irvine had once again tied the
score at 5-5.
"We had a fine game offensively but
seemed a little mixed up on defense. Paul
Clarke played a superb game. Irvine, who I
would say is one of the top teams around,
stayed in it all the way," said Lambert.
The Cards offense featured a balanced

scoring attack paced by Davis, Johannsen
and Drew McDonald with two goals apiece.
Stanford, however, almost didn't meet Ir
vine with a 13-1 record as the previous day,
Long Beach State shocked the Cards by scor
ing five fourth quarter goals but losing, 8-7.
The Cardinals had built up a seemingly in
surmountable 6-0 halftime lead, with
freshman Paul Burke accounting for half of
the first half Cardinal tallies. For Long
Beach State, Olympic star Tim Shaw tallied
two goals.
"We were looking ahead to Irvine. That is
the only way we could give up so many
goals in the last quarter. Also, Roberts was
absent, and I pulled Clarke out of the game
in the second quarter. I also wanted to rest
Dorst so I played Frank Forencich at
goalie," Lambert explained.
Stanford resumes its quest for a Pac-8
championship next Friday against USC.
According to Lambert, the Trojans, who the
Cards have yet to meet in regular season
competition, are a sol id team against which
Stanford will have to play a little more con
sistently than last weekend in order to raise
their league record to a perfect 3-0.
