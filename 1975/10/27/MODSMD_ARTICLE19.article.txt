JVs drop first
Despite a strong second-half surge, JV football
team lost its first game of the season last Friday
afternoon at Butte College, 35-34. The Cards' re
cord now stands at 2-1 on the season. It was the
first loss in the last 10 games for the JVs.
From the very beginning nothing seemed to go
right for the Cards. The team arrived for the game
just one hour before the scheduled starting time,
after spending four hours on the bus trip there.
It wasn't until the first-half ended with Stanford
having only one possession that the Cards
realized the quarter had been played with a run
ning clock. But it wasn't until the fourth-quarter
that the most questionable aspect of the timekeep
ing occurred.
With approximately three minutes left and
trailing 33-20, the Cards began a rally which saw
them catapult into a 34-33 lead. Linebacker Jack
Moller began the rally by intercepting a pass in
Butte territory.
On the Cards' first play from scrimmage, quar

terback Turk Schonert connected on a pass to
running back Billy Anderson for a 37-yard touch
down. The Cards wasted no time on their next
possession as Schonert found Anderson once
again for a 61-yard TD pass.
When safety Mike Connor intercepted a pass in
the Stanford endzone and brought it out to the
Stanford three with only 42 seconds remaining, it
appeared the Cards would be able to sit on the ball
until time ran out. Things did not work out that
way, however.
Butte used up their final timeouts on the first
two Cardinal plays. On third down Schonert re
ceived the snap and fell to the ground. The clock
should have remained running, but instead it
stopped. By the time everything had been ironed
out, Stanford was called for a delay of game pen
alty. Facing a fourth down situation within their
three-yard line, the Cards were forced to punt.
Schonert fumbled a low snap from center and, by
the time he recovered, was tackled in the endzone
for a safety, giving Butte its one point victory.

Swimmers dominate
Stanford's women swimmers were the class of
the field Saturday at the NCI AC relays at Cal-State
Hayward. The tankers took first-places in eight of
12 events.

Fencers look flashy
Two men and three women representing Stan
ford in the individual foil competitions at San Jose
State made it to the final round on Saturday.
Dennis Leybold took a first in the men's divi
sion, while Phil Logan placed sixth. In the
women's half of the tournament, Stanford pegged
fifth through seventh place with Ann Bunnenberg
finishing fifth, Amy Fiske finishing sixth and
Claudie Temby placing seventh.
Booters take Stanislaus
The Stanford soccer team crushed Stanislaus
State 3-0 Saturday for their first home game win
and goalie Bruce Mosbacher's second shutout of
the season.
Although center Phil Wright termed Stanford s
first half play "rather pathetic," he and forward
Johnny Murao banged in goals. Wright put in his
left-footed shot 19 minutes into the game when he
took the ball from 20 feet in front of the goal and
ricocheted it off a Stanislaus man's foot. Murao
got his goal eight minutes later when he put a shot
between two Stanislaus men from 15 feet out.
Though Stanford scored just once in the second
half, it was probably the Cardinals' prettiest score
of the season. With Wright running in full stride
towards the left side of the goal, he took a perfect
kick and put a head shot past the goalie in the final
two minutes.

JVs drop first
Despite a strong second-half surge, JV football
team lost its first game of the season last Friday
afternoon at Butte College, 35-34. The Cards' re
cord now stands at 2-1 on the season. It was the
first loss in the last 10 games for the JVs.
From the very beginning nothing seemed to go
right for the Cards. The team arrived for the game
just one hour before the scheduled starting time,
after spending four hours on the bus trip there.
It wasn't until the first-half ended with Stanford
having only one possession that the Cards
realized the quarter had been played with a run
ning clock. But it wasn't until the fourth-quarter
that the most questionable aspect of the timekeep
ing occurred.
With approximately three minutes left and
trailing 33-20, the Cards began a rally which saw
them catapult into a 34-33 lead. Linebacker Jack
Moller began the rally by intercepting a pass in
Butte territory.
On the Cards' first play from scrimmage, quar

terback Turk Schonert connected on a pass to
running back Billy Anderson for a 37-yard touch
down. The Cards wasted no time on their next
possession as Schonert found Anderson once
again for a 61-yard TD pass.
When safety Mike Connor intercepted a pass in
the Stanford endzone and brought it out to the
Stanford three with only 42 seconds remaining, it
appeared the Cards would be able to sit on the ball
until time ran out. Things did not work out that
way, however.
Butte used up their final timeouts on the first
two Cardinal plays. On third down Schonert re
ceived the snap and fell to the ground. The clock
should have remained running, but instead it
stopped. By the time everything had been ironed
out, Stanford was called for a delay of game pen
alty. Facing a fourth down situation within their
three-yard line, the Cards were forced to punt.
Schonert fumbled a low snap from center and, by
the time he recovered, was tackled in the endzone
for a safety, giving Butte its one point victory.

Swimmers dominate
Stanford's women swimmers were the class of
the field Saturday at the NCI AC relays at Cal-State
Hayward. The tankers took first-places in eight of
12 events.

Fencers look flashy
Two men and three women representing Stan
ford in the individual foil competitions at San Jose
State made it to the final round on Saturday.
Dennis Leybold took a first in the men's divi
sion, while Phil Logan placed sixth. In the
women's half of the tournament, Stanford pegged
fifth through seventh place with Ann Bunnenberg
finishing fifth, Amy Fiske finishing sixth and
Claudie Temby placing seventh.
Booters take Stanislaus
The Stanford soccer team crushed Stanislaus
State 3-0 Saturday for their first home game win
and goalie Bruce Mosbacher's second shutout of
the season.
Although center Phil Wright termed Stanford s
first half play "rather pathetic," he and forward
Johnny Murao banged in goals. Wright put in his
left-footed shot 19 minutes into the game when he
took the ball from 20 feet in front of the goal and
ricocheted it off a Stanislaus man's foot. Murao
got his goal eight minutes later when he put a shot
between two Stanislaus men from 15 feet out.
Though Stanford scored just once in the second
half, it was probably the Cardinals' prettiest score
of the season. With Wright running in full stride
towards the left side of the goal, he took a perfect
kick and put a head shot past the goalie in the final
two minutes.
