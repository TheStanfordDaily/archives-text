# Blaze erupts in TMU kitchen; 'Transition' damaged by smoke
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Fire in the kitchen of the Transition,
the short order food service, in Tresid
der Memorial Union caused an esti
mated $10,000 worth of damage
Saturday night.
The fire, which broke out about 9:30
p.m. is believed to have been caused by
a faulty thermostat which allowed the
grease in a deep fat fryer to overheat.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan
Williams said that most of the damage
was caused by the grease-laden smoke.
"There was greasy soot all over every
thing. We are going to have to replace
the entire system over the grill. But
really the biggest problem is that it's so
damn messy."
The deep fryer itself, a small part of
the ceiling around the ventilation
duct, the vertilation duct and some

wiring were damaged by the flames.
Kerwin Theriault, assistant manager
of the Transition, located on the first
floor of Tresidder, said that the fire
broke out suddenly. "I turned around
and saw the machine burning," he
said. "I yelled for someone to call the
fire department and went for a fire ex
tinguisher."
Kelly McGovern, a student employe,
pulled the alarm. He said that the
foam-type fire extinguisher seemed to
have little effect on the flames.
"When we hit it (the flame) with the
foam the fire would sort of go out, but
then start back up again," he said. "It
was like it was still getting heat from
somewhere. It must have been a hot
wire or something. Finally it was just
too much, so Kervvin (Theriault) said
to leave."

Williams said that the blaze will be
investigated by the insurance com
pany, but he does not anticipate any
difficulty with collection on the claim.
Assistant Chief John Barr of the
Stanford Fire Department said that the
thermostat on the deep fry unjt failed
to shut off but was unavailable for
further comment.
Three fire trucks responded to the
call. Firefighters supervised by Assis
tant Chief Harry Lund brought the
flames under control almost im
mediately.
A crew composd mainly of Transi
tion staff worked all day yesterday to
enable the Transition to open today.
Williams said he believes that
Marcel's, a pastry shop adjoining the
Transition, may open as usual at 7 a.m.
this morning.

CHARCOAL BROILER — Stanford firefighters peer into a wall of greasy,
black smoke as fhey prepare to enter Tresidder's fast food cafeteria, the
Transition, to put out a blaze Saturday night. It is estimated that the grease
fire, which started in the french fry machine, caused $10,000 damage to the
building. Employes worked all day yesterday in an effort to reopen Transition
today.
Fire in the kitchen of the Transition,
the short order food service, in Tresid
der Memorial Union caused an esti
mated $10,000 worth of damage
Saturday night.
The fire, which broke out about 9:30
p.m. is believed to have been caused by
a faulty thermostat which allowed the
grease in a deep fat fryer to overheat.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Dan
Williams said that most of the damage
was caused by the grease-laden smoke.
"There was greasy soot all over every
thing. We are going to have to replace
the entire system over the grill. But
really the biggest problem is that it's so
damn messy."
The deep fryer itself, a small part of
the ceiling around the ventilation
duct, the vertilation duct and some

wiring were damaged by the flames.
Kerwin Theriault, assistant manager
of the Transition, located on the first
floor of Tresidder, said that the fire
broke out suddenly. "I turned around
and saw the machine burning," he
said. "I yelled for someone to call the
fire department and went for a fire ex
tinguisher."
Kelly McGovern, a student employe,
pulled the alarm. He said that the
foam-type fire extinguisher seemed to
have little effect on the flames.
"When we hit it (the flame) with the
foam the fire would sort of go out, but
then start back up again," he said. "It
was like it was still getting heat from
somewhere. It must have been a hot
wire or something. Finally it was just
too much, so Kervvin (Theriault) said
to leave."

Williams said that the blaze will be
investigated by the insurance com
pany, but he does not anticipate any
difficulty with collection on the claim.
Assistant Chief John Barr of the
Stanford Fire Department said that the
thermostat on the deep fry unjt failed
to shut off but was unavailable for
further comment.
Three fire trucks responded to the
call. Firefighters supervised by Assis
tant Chief Harry Lund brought the
flames under control almost im
mediately.

tion staff worked all day yesterday to
