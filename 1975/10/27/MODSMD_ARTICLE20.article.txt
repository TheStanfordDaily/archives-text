Sadat seeks more U.S. aid
WILLIAMSBURG, Va. — President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt will seek more U.S. military and economic aid dur
ing his visit to the United States.
He also wants a promise that Israel will be pressured
into giving up more land to the Arabs and. according to
sources, wishes to encourage Congress to deny Israel ul
tramodern arms such as the Pershing missile.
Before leaving Cairo, Sadat said in a taped television
interview that he wishes to buy arms to replace weapons
lost in the last Middle East war and to try to convince the
Ford administration to scale down its military commit
ment to Israel.
"Mainly, I want you to help me on the economic side, to
have long-term loans because the difficulty in my
economy is that we have short-term loans," Sadat said in
the interview for ABC's Issues and Answers.
The Ford administration already has decided to ask
Congress for a minimum of $500 million in economic aid
for Egypt, and Sadat is expected to ask for more.
Congress plans new energy bill
WASHINGTON — Senate-House conferees put the
finishing touches this week on a bill to provide a congres
sional substitute for President Ford's energy plan.
But because the bill will contain a provision cutting the
price of oil, it stands a good chance of being vetoed. Ford
advocates higher fuel prices on the grounds that they
would reduce consumption and provide U.S. energy pro
ducers the incentive to increase supplies.
The lawmakers — 25 from the Senate and seven from
the House — hope to hammer into one piece of legislation
this week the separate comprehensive energy bills passed
by the House and Senate. Neither house will meet today
because of the Veterans' Day holiday.
Lebanese leader pleads for peace
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslem-Christian street battles
sent bullets, rockets and grenades tearing through the
European quarter of Beirut yesterday, leaving at least 30
persons dead.
Foreign embassies stepped up plans to move their na
tionals out of the war-torn capital.
Premier Rashid Karami announced in a nationwide
broadcast after a 4V2-hour cabinet meeting that another

cease-fire had been agreed upon by leaders of the Moslem
and Christian militias, but shooting continued.
Franco approaching death
MADRID, Spain — Gen. Francisco Franco was near
death early today as doctors, preparing Franco for
surgery, instead massaged his failing heart and gave him
an emergency blood transfusion, sources close to his med
ical team said.
Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon, Franco's heir as head of
state, and all top government officials rushed to the
generalissimo's Pardo Palace 10 miles north of Madrid.
A medical bulletin yesterday reported he was sleep
ing, but his heart was experiencing "important rhythmic
upsets with marked accentuation of the congestive car
diac insufficiency" for the past two days.
Airline strike deadlocked
MIAMI — Federal mediators have bowed out of negotia
tions between striking flight attendants and National Air
lines because of a new deadlock over a tentative agree
ment to end the two-month-old strike against National.
National officials, however, continued to hold out hope
that the agreement could be salvaged to end the shut
down.
A representative of the striking stewards and stewar
desses contended that the latest talks dissolved when the
company began proposing language that "would take
things away from the tentative agreement" worked out
last Thursday.
However, both sides declined to be specific on what the
terms of the settlement were or to what the union objected.
Also, no further meetings between negotiators were
scheduled.
Since Labor Day, 7660 employes of National have been
idled, and 360 daily flights out of 45 American cities and
London have been halted.
Today's weather

able cloudiness tonight and tomorrow. Continued cool.
Lows tonight in the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs in the upper
50s and 60s. Variable winds 5 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 30
percent today.
