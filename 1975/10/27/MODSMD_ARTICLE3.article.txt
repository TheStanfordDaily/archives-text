### STEVE SCHILLER 
Dean Arjay Miller challenged
Stanford's Graduate School of Busi
ness "to maintain forward momen
tum" for the next 50 years, when he
spoke at Saturday's gathering of busi
ness school alumni.
Nine hundred alumni attended the
school's 50th anniversary celebration,
where Miller recalled the accomp
lishments of the school since he be
came dean in 1969.
Each of last June's 286 graduates, in
cluding 51 women, had at least three
job offers before they left the campus
with a mean starting salary of $18,500,
Miller said.
The school applicants-to
admissions ratio is 11 to 1, making
GSB's selection the most competitive
in the country. The average age of stu
dents is 25.1 years and 85 percent have
some previous job experience.
Stanford tops survey
A recent survey rating business
schools in several fields, including fi
nance, accounting, marketing and

management science, gave Stanford
6V2 points, and its nearest competitor
2 x /i points out of a total of 10 points
awarded.
Calling the continuing education
program, in which business execu
tives attend seminars at the school to
update their knowledge, the "big suc
cess story," Miller predicted an in
creased emphasis on this area in the
years ahead.
In 1957, the school won a $216,000
grant from the Sloan Foundation to es
tablish a special course of study for
middle management executives. The
Sloan program today has approxi
mately 450 alumni. Starting in
academic year 197(5-77, graduates of
the year-long program will receive a
M.S. degree.
Petroprices and petrodollars
On Friday, approximately 150 Sloan
alumni attended a series of sessions at
the school, including a speech by
former Secretary of the Treasury
Ceorge P. Schulz entitled "Petroprices
and Petrodollars." Schulz, a professor

of management and public policy at
the school, said that a "dropped price
is inevitable."
In response to a question, Schulz
said that a $100 billion energy prog
ram recently proposed by President
Ford "looks like a loser to me."
Schulz also suggested that the Pres
ident start to cut spending by eliminat
ing the project. In Schulz's opinion,
the function of government in energy
"is being performed."
The Ernest C. Arbuckle Award, first
awarded to retiring Dean Arbuckle in
1968 "for distinguished achievement
in the tradition of Ernest C. Arbuckle,"
was awarded to Miller, who was given
honorary alumni status in 1972.
