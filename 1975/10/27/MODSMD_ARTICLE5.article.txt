# Overseas directors confer here

Directors of the overseas studies
programs, flown in from Europe, yes
terday began a five-day conference
that will explore all aspects of the
programs, including curriculum and
ways to meet the impending budget
cuts.
The directors are meeting with the
Faculty Senate's Committee on
Foreign Studies Programs, hoping to
give the committee the benefit of their
on-site administrative experience. The
committee is expected to submit re
commendations on the future of the
program to the Senate in late
November.
Prospective overseas students will
also have an opportunity to meet with
the directors this week in orientation
sessions.
"A focus program (such as the one
on health care delivery taught at
Cliveden) has a tremendous potential
if it attracts the students' interest,"
said Ciuseppe Mammarella, director
of Stanford-in-Florence.
However, Mammarella also noted a
couple of drawbacks to the focus prog
rams. "A basic problem is that stu
dents aren't required to take focus
programs as a whole, and they tend to
take separate courses, he said, adding
that "A focus program has a cost that
far exceeds the cost of other, normal
programs. Other programs can often be
taught by local faculty."
Some of the overseas centers have
cut costs by moving from campuses to
city facilities. For instance, in the
Beutelsbach program students live in
apartments rented directly from the
city at sub-market prices and receive a
meal stipend.
Justified move
The prime reason for the move was
"to get students into closer contact
with the population." according to
Beutelsbach director Alfred Schmid.
"It is my impression that this move
was very well received by students.
Former criticism about isolation has
completely disappeared."
So has the number of places availa
ble for the Beutelsbach program. The
move necessitated a cut in student
population from about 80 students to
35, Schmid said.
