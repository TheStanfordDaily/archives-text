# Overseas directors confer here

### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Directors of the overseas studies
programs, flown in from Europe, yes
terday began a five-day conference
that will explore all aspects of the
programs, including curriculum and
ways to meet the impending budget
cuts.
The directors are meeting with the
Faculty Senate's Committee on
Foreign Studies Programs, hoping to
give the committee the benefit of their
on-site administrative experience. The
committee is expected to submit re
commendations on the future of the
program to the Senate in late
November.
Prospective overseas students will
also have an opportunity to meet with
the directors this week in orientation
sessions.
"A focus program (such as the one
on health care delivery taught at
Cliveden) has a tremendous potential
if it attracts the students' interest,"
said Ciuseppe Mammarella, director
of Stanford-in-Florence.
However, Mammarella also noted a
couple of drawbacks to the focus prog
rams. "A basic problem is that stu
dents aren't required to take focus
programs as a whole, and they tend to
take separate courses, he said, adding
that "A focus program has a cost that
far exceeds the cost of other, normal
programs. Other programs can often be
taught by local faculty."
Some of the overseas centers have
cut costs by moving from campuses to
city facilities. For instance, in the
Beutelsbach program students live in
apartments rented directly from the
city at sub-market prices and receive a
meal stipend.
Justified move
The prime reason for the move was
"to get students into closer contact
with the population." according to
Beutelsbach director Alfred Schmid.
"It is my impression that this move
was very well received by students.
Former criticism about isolation has
completely disappeared."
So has the number of places availa
ble for the Beutelsbach program. The
move necessitated a cut in student
population from about 80 students to
35, Schmid said.
Of the nine overseas studies centers
only Cliveden and Florence now have
their own facilities outside of the city.
Director of Overseas Studies Mark
Mancall said he did not foresee in the
near future the possibility of Cliveden
or Florence moving to the city.
Nor did Mancall believe there could
be a significant increase in the number
of programs allowing Stanford stu
dents to attend European universities.
"That usually requires a language
competency most of our students don't

have," he said. "Where students have
the language competency we do en
courage them (to participate in such
programs)."
In an effort to withstand proposed
General Funds budget cuts of 50 per
cent by 1979, the possibility of seeking
funds from Stanford alumni and
American overseas businesses will be
considered, Mancall said.
Presently $1.5 million of the $2 mill
ion overseas budget is paid out of Uni
versity General Funds, with the re
mainder paid by paticipants for room.

Orientation and recruitment prog
rams for students going overseas will

"A focus program (such as the one
on health care delivery taught at
Cliveden) has a tremendous potential
if it attracts the students' interest,"
said Ciuseppe Mammarella, director
of Stanford-in-Florence.
However, Mammarella also noted a
couple of drawbacks to the focus prog
rams. "A basic problem is that stu
dents aren't required to take focus
programs as a whole, and they tend to
take separate courses, he said, adding
that "A focus program has a cost that
far exceeds the cost of other, normal
programs. Other programs can often be
taught by local faculty."
Some of the overseas centers have
cut costs by moving from campuses to
city facilities. For instance, in the
Beutelsbach program students live in
apartments rented directly from the
city at sub-market prices and receive a
meal stipend.
Justified move
The prime reason for the move was
"to get students into closer contact
with the population." according to
Beutelsbach director Alfred Schmid.
"It is my impression that this move
was very well received by students.
Former criticism about isolation has
completely disappeared."
So has the number of places availa
ble for the Beutelsbach program. The
move necessitated a cut in student
population from about 80 students to
35, Schmid said.
Of the nine overseas studies centers
only Cliveden and Florence now have
their own facilities outside of the city.
Director of Overseas Studies Mark
Mancall said he did not foresee in the
near future the possibility of Cliveden
or Florence moving to the city.
Nor did Mancall believe there could
be a significant increase in the number
of programs allowing Stanford stu
dents to attend European universities.
"That usually requires a language
competency most of our students don't

have," he said. "Where students have
the language competency we do en
courage them (to participate in such
programs)."
In an effort to withstand proposed
General Funds budget cuts of 50 per
cent by 1979, the possibility of seeking
funds from Stanford alumni and
American overseas businesses will be
considered, Mancall said.
