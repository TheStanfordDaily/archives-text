# International Women's Conference
## Women discuss power, advancement 
### RIV WEBER 
An international array of speakers joined more
than 1000 participants in the San Francisco Inter
national Women's Year Conference last Friday and
Saturday to discuss development of women's
power in our world.
The speakers cited socialism, lesbianism and
education as essential elements of the increasing
power of the world's largest majority — women.
In regard to population control, "The best con
traceptive discovered so far is the advancement of
women," declared Annie Jiagge, justice of the Sup
reme Court of Appals in Chana, in the first address
of the conference.
Education and opportunity will keep women
"too interested and too involved to consider mar
riage at an early age," Jiagge said.
Jiagge, the first African woman lawyer, attacked
the world economic structure and male-initiated
political decisions as factors in the exploitation of
women.

Mildred Persinger, chairperson of the Interna
tional Women's Year Tribune in Mexico City, con
tinued on fiagge's theme. "If women are indeed the
only new force for change, their multiple roles will
have to be expanded to include the assertion of the
right to be part of the great global decisions which
control our destinies," said Persinger.
"Only the powerless can effect change," con

tinued Persinger, "Men in power have too much to
lose." The agents of change are the "political outs"
like those at the conference, she explained.
At one of the five panel discussions, Nancy
McDermid, chairwomen of the speech communica
tions department at San Francisco State University,
cited the basic problems confronting women.
"First, the law in the United States is the rule of
men. It makes for a world in which women were
never intended to share the power," began McDer
mid.
Capitalism and the patriarchal nuclear family are
also causes of the women's lower position, she con
tinued. Lastly, "the nature of things and the divine
creator Himself" are used as justifications of
women's lower status.
Token lesbian
Sally Gearhart, another professor from San Fran
cisco State University, was described by two ga>
women in the audience as the conference's "token
lesbian."
Gearhart claims the ideas of a woman's status
begin at birth. "In the hospital room you are in
jected with a heavily addicting drug I'd like to call
'woman-hatred, self-hatred.' " she said. "You can
hear the doctor's disappointment when he says,
it's a girl.' "
"Women are taught we can't be whole persons
until our weaknesses can be matched by men's
strengths," Garhart continued. She predicts a com

ing of power when there is "women love and self
love," and she suggested that women should be
come lesbians.
"If she (a woman) is really women-loving, she
will be pleased to call herself a lesbian," Gearhart
said. Lesbianism is a "lifestyle, a mindset that can
confront the dominant culture."
Asked about the conference's reaction to
Gearhart's comments, a lesbian in the audience
said. "They accepted her personally, but not her
ideas."
The Chilean woman
"The Chilean woman placed her hope in
socialism," said Laura Allende, sister of the late
Salvador Allende and a Chilean senator for nine
years before the 1973 coup.
Lecturing the conference during lunch, Allende
explained. "Our fight is not against men as a sexual
grouping, rather it is against the exploitation of
men and women by a few men in position of
privilege."
Allende spoke through a translator and specified
American companies that helped finance the over
throw of the Allende government as exploiters.
The conference was held at the Sheraton Palace
Hotel, sponsored by the United Nations Associa
tion of San Francisco and underwritten by a grant
from Standard Oil of California. Allended attacked
the fact that many participants in the conference
had incomes above their countries' average.

McDermid, chairwomen of the speech communica
tions department at San Francisco State University,
cited the basic problems confronting women.
"First, the law in the United States is the rule of
men. It makes for a world in which women were
never intended to share the power," began McDer
mid.
Capitalism and the patriarchal nuclear family are
also causes of the women's lower position, she con
tinued. Lastly, "the nature of things and the divine
creator Himself" are used as justifications of
women's lower status.
Token lesbian
Sally Gearhart, another professor from San Fran
cisco State University, was described by two ga>
women in the audience as the conference's "token
lesbian."
Gearhart claims the ideas of a woman's status
begin at birth. "In the hospital room you are in
jected with a heavily addicting drug I'd like to call
'woman-hatred, self-hatred.' " she said. "You can
hear the doctor's disappointment when he says,
it's a girl.' "
"Women are taught we can't be whole persons
until our weaknesses can be matched by men's
strengths," Garhart continued. She predicts a com

ing of power when there is "women love and self
love," and she suggested that women should be
come lesbians.
"If she (a woman) is really women-loving, she
will be pleased to call herself a lesbian," Gearhart
said. Lesbianism is a "lifestyle, a mindset that can
confront the dominant culture."
Asked about the conference's reaction to
Gearhart's comments, a lesbian in the audience
said. "They accepted her personally, but not her
ideas."
The Chilean woman
"The Chilean woman placed her hope in
socialism," said Laura Allende, sister of the late
Salvador Allende and a Chilean senator for nine
years before the 1973 coup.
Lecturing the conference during lunch, Allende
explained. "Our fight is not against men as a sexual
grouping, rather it is against the exploitation of
men and women by a few men in position of
privilege."
Allende spoke through a translator and specified
American companies that helped finance the over
throw of the Allende government as exploiters.
The conference was held at the Sheraton Palace
Hotel, sponsored by the United Nations Associa
tion of San Francisco and underwritten by a grant
from Standard Oil of California. Allended attacked
the fact that many participants in the conference
had incomes above their countries' average.
An international array of speakers joined more
than 1000 participants in the San Francisco Inter
national Women's Year Conference last Friday and
Saturday to discuss development of women's
power in our world.
The speakers cited socialism, lesbianism and
education as essential elements of the increasing
power of the world's largest majority — women.
In regard to population control, "The best con
traceptive discovered so far is the advancement of
women," declared Annie Jiagge, justice of the Sup
reme Court of Appals in Chana, in the first address
of the conference.
Education and opportunity will keep women
"too interested and too involved to consider mar
riage at an early age," Jiagge said.
Jiagge, the first African woman lawyer, attacked
the world economic structure and male-initiated
political decisions as factors in the exploitation of
women.

have to be expanded to include the assertion of the
right to be part of the great global decisions which
control our destinies," said Persinger.
"Only the powerless can effect change," con

tinued Persinger, "Men in power have too much to
lose." The agents of change are the "political outs"
