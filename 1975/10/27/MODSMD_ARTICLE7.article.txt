# Tenure problems
## 
### 
I am glad to see from William
Ross's article (Daily, Oct. 21)
that the Daily is still concerned
about the procedures for grant
ing or withholding tenure in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ence (H & S).
But 1 must take issue with him
on one point.
He suggests that "if the de
partments recommended only
some of their members for te
nure, departmental influence in
the tenure process would in
crease." This sounds plausible
(although one department has a
long record of supporting many
candidates and getting them
through).
The feeling may very well de
velop in the departments that
since the judgments of the Ap
pointments and Promotions
(A & P) Committee are so unpre
dictable, any junior person
whom they think worthy to re
main at Stanford should be given
a chance of getting through. In
that way, at least a few may sur
vive to handle the senior work
load.
Run department
Hut the case of my own de
partment is obviously to the
point. Last year we put up three
candidates for tenure (including
one case resubmitted, with
much new evidence, after a pre
vious rejection).
We considered them all excel
lent, and in different ways, the
best in their fields. Suppose we
had, after agonizing decisions or
by drawing lots, denied a chance
of tenure to two of these and
supported only one of the appli
cations.
If the A & P Committee indeed
makes its decision on the basis of
the evidence of scholarship and
teaching submitted to it, this ap
plication would have been re
jected (as all three were in fact
rejected), and the consciences of
the department would never
have known any peace concern-

Mark W. Edwards

ing the other two, who might
have better conformed to the
standards of the A & P Commit
tee.
But suppose this one applica
tion had been passed. One can
only suppose that the A & P
Committee is not competent to
assess the scholarly merits of
candidates and is primarily in
fluenced by its impressions of
the department.
These impressions could not,
of course, be based on any know
ledge of the record of these
junior faculty whom the de
partment had seen fit to reject,
since these would never reject
the A & P Committee. Can one
admit this without demanding
reform?
Punishing department
I have heard the suggestion
that denying tenure to all three
of our candidates was a way of
punishing the department for
venturing to support so many.
Let me say that I am utterly con
fident that neither Dean Halsey
Royden of H & S nor former
Dean Lawrence Ryan would ever
act in such a spirit.
If the A& P Committee
thought it impossible to promote
all these men in one department
on non-academic grounds, no
thing except an unworthy tradi
tion prevented it from discus
sing that issue with senior mem
bers of the department.
I have some sympathy with
members of the A & P Commit
tee who worked hard and cannot
defend themselves in public. But
it is their own fault, for consent
ing to undertake a vital task
under procedures which make it
impossible to do it properly.
If all senior faculty in H & S
declined to accept appointment
to the Committee until some
reform was made, reform would
quickly come.

Run department
Hut the case of my own de
partment is obviously to the
point. Last year we put up three
candidates for tenure (including
one case resubmitted, with
much new evidence, after a pre
vious rejection).
We considered them all excel
lent, and in different ways, the
best in their fields. Suppose we
had, after agonizing decisions or
by drawing lots, denied a chance
of tenure to two of these and
supported only one of the appli
cations.
If the A & P Committee indeed
makes its decision on the basis of
the evidence of scholarship and
teaching submitted to it, this ap
plication would have been re
jected (as all three were in fact
rejected), and the consciences of
the department would never
have known any peace concern-

Mark W. Edwards

ing the other two, who might
have better conformed to the
standards of the A & P Commit
tee.
But suppose this one applica
tion had been passed. One can
only suppose that the A & P
Committee is not competent to
assess the scholarly merits of
candidates and is primarily in
fluenced by its impressions of
the department.
These impressions could not,
of course, be based on any know
ledge of the record of these
junior faculty whom the de
partment had seen fit to reject,
since these would never reject
the A & P Committee. Can one
admit this without demanding
reform?
Punishing department
I have heard the suggestion
that denying tenure to all three
of our candidates was a way of
punishing the department for
venturing to support so many.
Let me say that I am utterly con
fident that neither Dean Halsey
Royden of H & S nor former
Dean Lawrence Ryan would ever
act in such a spirit.
If the A& P Committee
thought it impossible to promote
all these men in one department
on non-academic grounds, no
thing except an unworthy tradi
tion prevented it from discus
sing that issue with senior mem
bers of the department.
I have some sympathy with
members of the A & P Commit
tee who worked hard and cannot
defend themselves in public. But
it is their own fault, for consent
ing to undertake a vital task
under procedures which make it
impossible to do it properly.
If all senior faculty in H & S
declined to accept appointment
to the Committee until some
reform was made, reform would
quickly come.
(Murk W. Edwards is acting
chairman of the Classics De
partment.)
I am glad to see from William
Ross's article (Daily, Oct. 21)
that the Daily is still concerned
about the procedures for grant
ing or withholding tenure in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ence (H & S).
But 1 must take issue with him
on one point.
He suggests that "if the de
partments recommended only
some of their members for te
nure, departmental influence in
the tenure process would in
crease." This sounds plausible
(although one department has a
long record of supporting many
candidates and getting them
through).
The feeling may very well de
velop in the departments that
since the judgments of the Ap
pointments and Promotions
(A & P) Committee are so unpre
dictable, any junior person
whom they think worthy to re
main at Stanford should be given
a chance of getting through. In
that way, at least a few may sur
vive to handle the senior work
load.
