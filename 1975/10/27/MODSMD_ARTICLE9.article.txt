# Airline regulations should be relaxed
## 
### Richard Fearon 
Federal regulation of American industry
has often been responsible for inflated con
sumer prices and for supporting companies
which should have gone bankrupt years
ago.
The transportation industry — especially
the airlines — is a prime example of the
harms of regulation. Attesting to this is the
fact that three of the United States' major air
carriers are in extreme financial difficulty,
while none of the others is faring particu
larly well.
Steps finally were taken earlier this
month to restore some autonomy to the
overrestricted airline industry — a move
long overdue.
The proposed legislation, introduced by
the administration, would permit airlines to
raise fares and rates up to 10 percent a year
without prior Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB) approval. The bill would also allow
airlines to cut fares to the carriers' operating
costs, allowing reductions of 20 pecent the
first year and 40 pecent the second year.
Fewer restrictions
Restrictions on new airlines entering the
business or on expansion of existing car
riers would also be greatly lessened under
the bill.
One provision would allow airlines to
expand their system of routes without CAB
approval five to 10 percent a year, begin
ning in 1981. Nor would the CAB have au
thority any longer to sanction joint agree
ments among airlines to limit competition,
as the bill would require that such pacts be
subject to the same antitrust laws other in
dustries face.
The bill would partly deprive the
CAB of its power to approve new airline
mergers, subjecting these mergers to
tougher antiinonopoly standards adminis
tered by the Justice Department.
Such action is just what the airline indus
try needs to revive itself. With a little more

competition, some of the airlines kept alive
by the artificially high CAB-pegged fares
will be forced to streamline their operations
or go into bankruptcy.
The hill also would increase competition
by providing expanded opportunity for air
lines to enter the business.

The plan would allow a new carrier to
begin service on routes where existing air
lines don't give non-stop service, with only
the provision that the new carrier be qual
ified.
Despite the legislation's failure to fully
open the airline industry to pure competi
tion, it would be quite an improvement over
the current rules.
These regulations now state that in order
to be approved a new carrier must prove it
would not financially harm any existing
carrier. It is difficult to conceive of a gov
ernment restriction more antithetical to free
competition.
Other restrictions currently imposed are
also lifted by the bill. Requirements forcing
carriers not to provide through-plane ser
vice or requiring that flights be continued
beyond certain destinations are being drop
ped.
Fear of competition
Of course, a number of airlines are oppos
ing the bill — primarily, because they fear
for their existence if too much competition
enters the industry. These fears are guised
in contentions that eliminating the present

regulations would threaten loss of service to
small towns.
Yet, if a small town can't afford to support
its own air service, why should passengers
on longer flights be forced to subsidize this
service? The bill provides a better way of
supplying local air service.
It would allow airlines to drop services
within 90 days when any alternate air ser
vice is available to a community. If no other
service were available, the airline could
terminate sevice by showing that its federal
subsidy payments for small-town runs don't
cover the costs involved.
The community affected by the termina
tion could then keep its air service by pay
ing the carrier for the carrier's losses. The
burden would be placed on the community;
no longer would carriers be forced to sub
sidize local flights.
Small town airlines
More markets would also be opened
under the bill to unregulated "commuter"
airlines, permitting small air companies to
carry 55 seats rather than the 30-seat limit
currently imposed. Such a provision might
help foster a growing number of small-town
airlines.
Indeed, White House planners estimated
that if the bill is passed, airline fares will
decrease an average of 15 percent to 20 per
cent over the next five years, excluding any
rise in the price level. The planners also
predict that the better service provided and
lower fares will increase airline ridership
nearly 20 pecent over that same period.
It is just such a shot in the arm our airlines
need if they are to providean important link
in the United States transportation system.
Fortunately the carriers are being rescued
before they fall into the same mire as
the nation's railroads.
