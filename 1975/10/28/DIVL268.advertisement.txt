It's hot down below
and 4 more are on the way.
Where depths and other conditions
permit, those heat reservoirs can be
turbines.
Our geothermal power costs less than
power generated by burning oil. We're
continuing the development, but at best.
geothermal can satisfy no more than 10%
of our needs to serve Northern and
Central California.

To harness water for power, we have
built one of the nation's greatest hydro
electric systems. In "average" and
snowfall years, hydro provides about 50%
of our electric energy. The force of falling
water makes the wheels go 'round in the
generating plants. Hydro generation
neither contaminates nor consumes the
water itself; it is returned to the rivers
undiminished, to serve agriculture and
other vital needs,
Building hydroelectric facilities is
expensive, but they are economical to
operate. The low cost is one reason why
our rates, despite recent increases, remain
among the lowest in the nation.
But since nearly all economically
acceptable hydro sites have already been
developed, oil and natural gas have
become more prominent in our energy
mix in recent years. Unfortunately the
costs of these fossil fuels have been sky-
rocketing In just five years, the prices
for gas have more than doubled and the
cost per barrel of low-sulfur fuel oil has
quintupled All but two of the PG&E
electnc rate increases requested in the
past five years were to offset these higher
fuel costs.
