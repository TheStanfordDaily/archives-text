# Future looks murky for ASSU promotions
## 
### BILL SING 
"The future of big-name rock enter
tainment at Stanford is very uncer
tain," says the man responsible for
promoting the success of rock concerts
on the Farm, senior Randy Phillips.
Phillips, director of ASSU Special
Events, heads one of the few, if not the
only, student-run and -owned college
promotional agencies in the country.
Phillips' combined role as booking
agent, promoter and producer of con
certs at Stanford makes his job unique.
Under his direction Special Events has
staged successful Elvin Bishop and
Leo Kottke concerts and is planning a
Big Game concert with Stephen Stills
Nov. 22.
Special Events is overwhelmingly
the principal moneymaker for the
ASSU. Last year, under the direction of
Danny Scher, Special Events netted
over $50,000.
Phillips says he expects to surpass
that total by the end of autumn quarter
this year. All profits go into a revolving
fund which supports many ASSU stu
dent projects.
Phillips and his staff run Special
Events as a business. Phillips relies on
a professional press agent, Ken Baker,
to handle publicity. In addition, he has
two production men, Bill Cleveland,
public service supervisor of Plant Ser
vices, and crew chief, Doug Baldwin
and security chief George Pegelow.
Phillips' greatest ally is ASSU Finan
cial Manager Chris Cline, who helps

with all-important budget and finance
matters.
$50,000 budget
Special Events' annual budget of
approximately $50,000 is used in bid
ding for groups, advertising, produc
tion and expenses.
"Actually there is no real limit to the
amount we can spend on a concert,"
says Cline. "If a show promises to have
a large enough return without being
too risky, there is no reason financially
why we can't do it."
However, rock promoting is a dif
ficult trade, especially for colleges,
where most productions lose money.
The ASSU is one of the few who have
been successful at promotions.
Local conditions make promoting
concerts at Stanford particularly dif
ficult.
"Our biggest obstacle is (rock im
presario) Bill Graham," says Phillips.
"He literally has the power over the
life and death of Stanford concerts. It's
like a tug of war competing for the few
big-name attractions to bid for. Bill
makes it extremely tough. When we do
get a show, it's usually one Bill wanted
that we got instead."
Hard rock returns
This summer's Eric Clapton concert
at Frost Amphitheater put Special
Events on the map and prompted
Graham to take heed of Phillips' abil
ity. The success of the show prompted
an in-depth article on Special Events
in the Sept. 6 issue of Billboard

Magazine, which characterized the
Clapton concert as marking "the re
turn of hard-rock to the Stanford cam
pus."
But, "there is a definite prejudice in
the Administration toward rock music
and the crowds it attracts," says Phil
lips. "It is extremely tough to get ap
proval for big-name acts. They make it
very hard to do business. At times my
job is like walking on eggs."
The Administration had for several
years banned hard rock concerts at
Stanford, permitting only groups such
as Loggins & Messina, Seals & Crofts,
Gordon Lightfoot and Joan Baez to per
form.
Permission needed
Every concert booked by Phillips
and Special Events must get approval
from the University through its Office
of Public Events and various academic
departments which exert priorities
over the use of their own facilities. In
order to book the Stills concert, for in
stance, Phillips had to obtain permis
sion from the Athletic Department for
the use of Maples Pavilion.
If there are conflicts in the process,
the ultimate decision often rests with
University Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
"The Administration has no objec
tion to the ASSU making money." says
Rosenzweig. "There are many high
risk problems involved in scheduling
rock concerts. . . . Frost, for instance,
takes a beating each time an event is

held there. Also, there is the problem
of finances and the risk of losing
money because of poor management."
"It is the University's job to see that
student initiated projects come off
well, with the high risk factors
minimized," says Tom Bacchetti. who,
as director of public events, largely de
termines the feasibility of each prop
osed production.
"The University has only a limited
number of facilities which are usable.
Academic departments obviously
have first priority over the use of their
own facilities. You just can't muscle
academic departments around.
"The University as an institution
has to cover itself." continues Bac
chetti. "It is the University, now the
ASSU, which will be ultimately liable
for our facilities. Therefore, we must
look carefully at the kind of entertain
ment Special Events proposes. Our at
titude is that of encouragement to
student-initiated projects, provided
the risks are minimized."
An educational institution

for that matter, must remember is that

says Rosenzweig.
"The University is not a base for Bill
Graham or Randy Phillips Enterprises.
Everyone must live by the priorities of
the University, which is first and
foremost an educational institution."
But Phillips says that putting on a
concert at Stanford "is like running an
obstacle course in Guantanamo (sic)
Marine Boot Camp. There's just one
obstacle after another."

"Students seem to think that an Krii
Clapton or a Stephen Stills just
materializes out of thin air. If they

process then perhaps they'd e\t'rt

replies. "1 always wanted to be better. 1
guess now 1 can't even do that."
"The future of big-name rock enter
tainment at Stanford is very uncer
tain," says the man responsible for
promoting the success of rock concerts
on the Farm, senior Randy Phillips.
Phillips, director of ASSU Special
Events, heads one of the few, if not the
only, student-run and -owned college
promotional agencies in the country.
Phillips' combined role as booking
agent, promoter and producer of con
certs at Stanford makes his job unique.
Under his direction Special Events has
staged successful Elvin Bishop and
Leo Kottke concerts and is planning a
Big Game concert with Stephen Stills
Nov. 22.
Special Events is overwhelmingly
the principal moneymaker for the
ASSU. Last year, under the direction of
Danny Scher, Special Events netted
over $50,000.
Phillips says he expects to surpass
that total by the end of autumn quarter
this year. All profits go into a revolving
fund which supports many ASSU stu
dent projects.
Phillips and his staff run Special
Events as a business. Phillips relies on
a professional press agent, Ken Baker,
to handle publicity. In addition, he has
two production men, Bill Cleveland,
public service supervisor of Plant Ser
vices, and crew chief, Doug Baldwin
and security chief George Pegelow.
Phillips' greatest ally is ASSU Finan
cial Manager Chris Cline, who helps

with all-important budget and finance
matters.
$50,000 budget
Special Events' annual budget of
approximately $50,000 is used in bid
ding for groups, advertising, produc
tion and expenses.
"Actually there is no real limit to the
amount we can spend on a concert,"
says Cline. "If a show promises to have
a large enough return without being
too risky, there is no reason financially
why we can't do it."
However, rock promoting is a dif
ficult trade, especially for colleges,
where most productions lose money.
The ASSU is one of the few who have
been successful at promotions.
Local conditions make promoting
concerts at Stanford particularly dif
ficult.
"Our biggest obstacle is (rock im
presario) Bill Graham," says Phillips.
"He literally has the power over the
life and death of Stanford concerts. It's
like a tug of war competing for the few
big-name attractions to bid for. Bill
makes it extremely tough. When we do
get a show, it's usually one Bill wanted
that we got instead."
Hard rock returns
This summer's Eric Clapton concert
at Frost Amphitheater put Special
Events on the map and prompted
Graham to take heed of Phillips' abil
ity. The success of the show prompted
an in-depth article on Special Events
in the Sept. 6 issue of Billboard

Magazine, which characterized the
Clapton concert as marking "the re
turn of hard-rock to the Stanford cam
pus."
But, "there is a definite prejudice in
the Administration toward rock music
and the crowds it attracts," says Phil
lips. "It is extremely tough to get ap
proval for big-name acts. They make it
very hard to do business. At times my
job is like walking on eggs."
The Administration had for several
years banned hard rock concerts at
Stanford, permitting only groups such
as Loggins & Messina, Seals & Crofts,
Gordon Lightfoot and Joan Baez to per
form.
Permission needed
Every concert booked by Phillips
and Special Events must get approval
from the University through its Office
of Public Events and various academic
departments which exert priorities
over the use of their own facilities. In
order to book the Stills concert, for in
stance, Phillips had to obtain permis
sion from the Athletic Department for
the use of Maples Pavilion.
If there are conflicts in the process,
the ultimate decision often rests with
University Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
"The Administration has no objec
tion to the ASSU making money." says
Rosenzweig. "There are many high
risk problems involved in scheduling
rock concerts. . . . Frost, for instance,
takes a beating each time an event is

held there. Also, there is the problem
of finances and the risk of losing
money because of poor management."
"It is the University's job to see that
student initiated projects come off
well, with the high risk factors
minimized," says Tom Bacchetti. who,
as director of public events, largely de
termines the feasibility of each prop
osed production.
"The University has only a limited
number of facilities which are usable.
Academic departments obviously
have first priority over the use of their
own facilities. You just can't muscle
academic departments around.
"The University as an institution
has to cover itself." continues Bac
chetti. "It is the University, now the
ASSU, which will be ultimately liable
for our facilities. Therefore, we must
look carefully at the kind of entertain
ment Special Events proposes. Our at
titude is that of encouragement to
student-initiated projects, provided
the risks are minimized."

Graham of Stanford University. "1
never wanted to be a Bill Graham." hi'
replies. "1 always wanted to be better. 1
guess now 1 can't even do that."
"The future of big-name rock enter
tainment at Stanford is very uncer
tain," says the man responsible for
promoting the success of rock concerts
on the Farm, senior Randy Phillips.
Phillips, director of ASSU Special
Events, heads one of the few, if not the
only, student-run and -owned college
promotional agencies in the country.
Phillips' combined role as booking
agent, promoter and producer of con
certs at Stanford makes his job unique.
Under his direction Special Events has
staged successful Elvin Bishop and
Leo Kottke concerts and is planning a
Big Game concert with Stephen Stills
Nov. 22.
Special Events is overwhelmingly
the principal moneymaker for the
ASSU. Last year, under the direction of
Danny Scher, Special Events netted
over $50,000.
Phillips says he expects to surpass
that total by the end of autumn quarter
this year. All profits go into a revolving
fund which supports many ASSU stu
dent projects.
Phillips and his staff run Special
Events as a business. Phillips relies on
a professional press agent, Ken Baker,
to handle publicity. In addition, he has
two production men, Bill Cleveland,
public service supervisor of Plant Ser
vices, and crew chief, Doug Baldwin
and security chief George Pegelow.
Phillips' greatest ally is ASSU Finan
cial Manager Chris Cline, who helps

with all-important budget and finance
matters.
$50,000 budget
Special Events' annual budget of
approximately $50,000 is used in bid
ding for groups, advertising, produc
tion and expenses.
"Actually there is no real limit to the
amount we can spend on a concert,"
says Cline. "If a show promises to have
a large enough return without being
too risky, there is no reason financially
why we can't do it."
However, rock promoting is a dif
ficult trade, especially for colleges,
where most productions lose money.
The ASSU is one of the few who have
been successful at promotions.
Local conditions make promoting
concerts at Stanford particularly dif
ficult.
"Our biggest obstacle is (rock im
presario) Bill Graham," says Phillips.
"He literally has the power over the
life and death of Stanford concerts. It's
like a tug of war competing for the few
big-name attractions to bid for. Bill
makes it extremely tough. When we do
get a show, it's usually one Bill wanted
that we got instead."
Hard rock returns
This summer's Eric Clapton concert
at Frost Amphitheater put Special
Events on the map and prompted
Graham to take heed of Phillips' abil
ity. The success of the show prompted
an in-depth article on Special Events
in the Sept. 6 issue of Billboard

Magazine, which characterized the
Clapton concert as marking "the re
turn of hard-rock to the Stanford cam
pus."
But, "there is a definite prejudice in
the Administration toward rock music
and the crowds it attracts," says Phil
lips. "It is extremely tough to get ap
proval for big-name acts. They make it
very hard to do business. At times my
job is like walking on eggs."
The Administration had for several
years banned hard rock concerts at
Stanford, permitting only groups such
as Loggins & Messina, Seals & Crofts,
Gordon Lightfoot and Joan Baez to per
form.
Permission needed
Every concert booked by Phillips
and Special Events must get approval
from the University through its Office
of Public Events and various academic
departments which exert priorities
over the use of their own facilities. In
order to book the Stills concert, for in
stance, Phillips had to obtain permis
sion from the Athletic Department for
the use of Maples Pavilion.
If there are conflicts in the process,
the ultimate decision often rests with
University Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig.
"The Administration has no objec
tion to the ASSU making money." says
Rosenzweig. "There are many high
risk problems involved in scheduling
rock concerts. . . . Frost, for instance,
takes a beating each time an event is

held there. Also, there is the problem
of finances and the risk of losing
money because of poor management."
"It is the University's job to see that
student initiated projects come off
well, with the high risk factors
minimized," says Tom Bacchetti. who,
as director of public events, largely de
termines the feasibility of each prop
osed production.
"The University has only a limited
number of facilities which are usable.
Academic departments obviously
have first priority over the use of their
own facilities. You just can't muscle
academic departments around.
"The University as an institution
has to cover itself." continues Bac
chetti. "It is the University, now the
ASSU, which will be ultimately liable
for our facilities. Therefore, we must
look carefully at the kind of entertain
ment Special Events proposes. Our at
titude is that of encouragement to
student-initiated projects, provided
the risks are minimized."
