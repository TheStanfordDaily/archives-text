# Bilingual ballots fight imagined injustice
## 
### 
Bureaucracies rarely die alter completing
the work lor which they were created.
Instead they usually just create unneces
sary work with which to sustain them
selves. Kecent events in the Justice Depart
ment illustrate this contention.
In 1 the Justice Department's Office of
Civil Rights was ordered to interpret and
enforce the Voting Rights Act. which at
tempted to eliminate discrimination against
racial minorities who tried to register to
vote.
The Office of Civil Rights performed its
important task well, and by 1974 voter re
gistration among minorities had risen
dramatically.
With its main work completed, the Office
should have reduced its operations. But in
stead. it turned its attention from real injus
tice to imagined injustice by deciding that
Knglish language ballots discriminated
against voters who didn't speak English.
Under the direction of ). Stanley Pot
tinger. chief enforcer of the Voting Rights
Act. states and cities have recently been in
formed that election ballots must he printed
in languages other than English if a com
milnitv includes at least five percent of what
the Justice Department calls a "minority
language group."'
The provision is largely unnecessary and
poorly constructed.
In order to vote, one must bean American
citizen. Me is therefore, ipso facto, either a
native-born or a naturalized citizen. If he is
naturalized then he theoretically can speak

English, since federal law decrees that be
fore naturalization, "the applicant for citi
zenship has to be able to speak, read and
write" English.
Il is doubtful if many native born citizens
who take so little interest in American life

that they have failed to learn English would
want to vote. Hut. assuming that some such
persons want to vote, it seems unnecessary
to make elaborate special accomodations for
persons who have purposely isolated them
selves from the mainstream of national life.
One exception is that of Native Ameri
cans. They have been encouraged by the
government to remain isolated on reserva
tions where English is often not the princi
pal language.
But rather than consider the Native
Americans as a special group, the Justice
Department has created rigid and unwork
able formula.
In most southwestern cities, for example,
the department has determined how many
persons are illiterate in English by counting

tlio number of Spanish surnamed persons in
the cities.
In other words, ail Spanish surnamed
persons are assumed to be functionally i 11 it
erate in English.
The formula insults countless highly
educated chicanos. The governors of both
Arizona and New Mexico must be rather
shocked to suddenly learn that they are il
literate.
Even the provisions for Indian reserva
tions are ill-conceived. The Justice Depart
ment is finding it difficult to determine
which areas include more than five percent
Native Americans, since federal law pros
cribes asking a person who registers to vote
to declare his race.
The provision is also extremely costly.
San Francisco authorities estimate that bi
lingual ballots may cost as much as
$500,000. Phoenix is spending $30,000 to
print new ballots and countless other cities
are paying large sums to implement the sys
tem.
Pottinger's regulations also set a danger
ous precedent, since it now likely that fed
eral officials will eventually decide it is
wrong to print government documents and
textbooks solely in English.
And when these injustices have been
eradicated, Pottingerand his associates will
no doubt find other imagined injustices to
fight in order to remain employed.
