# COP supports gay rights
## 
### 
In recent issues of the Daily,
students have been familiarized
with tilt; recent debate over the
shelving of books dealing with
homosexuality in Main Library.
The controversy — which is a
controversy only because of the
hard work and courage of the
Cav People's Union (CPU) at
Stanford — is now expanding
into discussion of the non
discriminatory policies of the
Career Planning and Placement
("enter (CPPC).
The CPU has performed an
important service in helping to
raise Stanford's consciousness
of gay liberation issues.
It is now asking that the pres
ent CPPC non-discriminatory
policies be extended to include
the category of "affectional or
sexual preference." meaning
"having or manifesting an emo
tional or physical attachment to
another consenting person or
persons of either gender, or hav
ing or manifesting a preference
for such attachment."
CPPC facilities
The CPPC currently makes its
facilities available only to emp
loyers who do not discriminate
on the basis of race, creed, sex or

national origin.
The Council of Presidents
(COP) belieyes that such a policy
extension is a needed and logical
progression in the direction of a
freer and healthier society — an
ideal which Stanford recognizes
in existing CPPC policies.
It is very important that the
Stanford community not per
ceive this issue in moral terms
and attempt to draw parallels
with earlier efforts to restrict
campus recruiting efforts. At the
height of the war-resistance
movement. President Richard
Lyman made it clear that he
would rather close the CPPC
than set up regulations to dis
cern the moral or immoral nature
of an employer's activities.
However, the CPU is not talk
ing about ethics but
discrimination — a clear-cut
case where the fundamental
rights of an important segment
of the Stanford community are
being restricted.
Kxtension legal
Extension of the CPPC policy
would be neither illegal nor un
precedented — 24 U.S. cities,
several counties and numerous
companies have already passed

Rosenbaum, et. al. II
regulations banning such dis
crimination.
Regarding Main Library's pol
icy of placing all books on
homosexuality in the locked
stacks, the COP strongly sup
ports the CPU's request that it be
changed. The rationale for cur
rent regulations is that such
books, because of their special
(presumably "sexual") interest,
have a high probability of being
stolen.
Book content
Yet most of the books in ques
tion have little strictly sexual
content. Many, for instance, are
books on the history and politics
of the gay liberation movement.
We think it high time that
Stanford students, faculty and
staff recognize the daily dis
crimination practiced against
gavs and make a concerted effort
to stop it. We can begin in our
own community. To the GPU
and its President. Richard
.Thomas, we extend our
wholehearted support and
hopes for continued success.
