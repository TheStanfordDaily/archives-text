Editor:
Hie Daily's report of my
comments last week on kZSU's
Cum pus Conference was gener
ally an accurate act ount of what
I said during the fast-paced ses
sion.
I nfortunately. one comment
made alter the recorded portion
of the program was omitted, thus
muddying the intended sense of
two thoughts.
What I said was: "The campus
r.ids feel you (as a hI at k person)
should be standing with them
critiquing the Establishment,
rather than working within it to
bring about change. The\ view
the latter pattern as "finking
out'."
I did not go on to add — al
though perhaps l should ha\ e —
that I see working for change
within "the Establishment" as
one important and. sometimes,
effective way of bringing about
change.

Fewer women profs
Editor:
Make Hallanan is correct in
stating in the Oct. 14 Daily that
the number of women full pro
fessors at Stanford decreased by
three between Sept. 1. 11)73 and
June 1975. The situation is
further exacerbated by the unfor
tunate death, this summer, of
Hematology Prof. Judith Pool,
bringing the reduction to four bv
Aug. 31.
It should be noted, however,
that two promotions to the full
professor rank became effective
on Sept. 1. so that the net de
crease is two.
(liven what the University is
trying to achieve by affirmative
action, this decrease is disturb
ing. We art; having trouble keep
ing ahead at the senior ranks.
Even though three women
were promoted to and one was
appointed to full professor posi
tions during the entire two year
period, the effects were counter
balanced by an abnormally large
number (five) of retirements and
the death of Prof. Pool.
I shall provide a rather com
plete analysis of the results of the
past three years' affirmative ac
tion in my report to the Senate on
Oct. 30. A written version in my
report will be presented to the
llniversity committee.
