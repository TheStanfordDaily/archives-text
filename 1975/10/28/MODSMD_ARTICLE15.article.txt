## '50s car buff tinkers for fun and profit 
### KEVIN OHLSON 
A person whose pastime pays
off in satisfaction and breaks
even monetarily must be doing
something right. Education In
structor Richard Paige does
more than something.
Paige's hobby is vintage 1950s
era automobiles. He has owned
almost a dozen cars in the last
few years, typically those big se
dans which were always a little
"off-beat."
"When I first came here, I
bought an old 1958 Cadillac
Coupe de Ville," Paige recounts.
"1 thought I might restore it, but
it was too far gone; really ratty.
So I sold il to somebody else who
thought he might be able to fix it
up."
He took the money and bought
a 1953 Oldsmobile, sold from an
estate. Paige says this is a prefer
able method for buying the cars.
After a few months, he sold the
Olds and found his next "dream
car" in Minnesota, a 1954 Mer
cury with a plexiglas sunroof.
"Most of the roofs were cracked
through the years," he says, "But
this one was all right, and the
previous owner had an extra
one.
"The car had a tendency to get

rather warm inside," he adds.
"Maybe that's why there were
only 7900 of them built."
"When I first bought the
Caddy, it cost me $125," Paige
says, "As time went along I was
able to parlay that into the other
cars. They appreciated in value
just during the time that I had
them."
Any profit, however, was put
into other cars. "Counting gas,
insurance and maintenance, 1
figure 1 break even on every
deal," he says. Except for his first
few cars, Paige has driven every
one as transportation between
Stanford and his home in Moun
tain View.
"I can't keep every one of them
because I don't have the space
nor the money," he says. "Be
sides, I like to experience as
many of the cars from this era as I
can.
"Now, it's even harder to find
the time and space for them. So
my wife and I talked about it and
acquired an almost concourse
(perfect) 1955 MG/TF-1500
Roadster. This was a considera
bly larger investment than be
fore."
Paige says he doesn't do any
major work required on the car.
In fact he says he tries to stay

away from cars that need a sub
stantial amount of work. Smaller
parts and help can be found
through old-car clubs and
magazines. There are some
junkyards in the San Carlos area
which specialize primarily in
parts for 1950s cars.
Paige continues in his praise
of the "last real cars ever built."
"The cars of the '50s are really
something. Each one has a mark
of craftsmans'hip, an individual
character. They're almost con
temporary in performance, as
the speed limit was 55 miles
per-hour when these were built.
"They're roomy, and have all
the options you can get on a car
today. And,"he adds, l 'those
built before 1955 are exempt
from smog controls."
Not everything is rosy,
though.
"The problem is that today the
prices have gone out-of-sight,"
Paige complains. "Dealers and
speculators have gotten into the
market, which makes it hard to
call it a hobby anymore.
"But I still like it,"he adds.
"Mostly 1 just like to tinker with
them. It's good to do something
which requires some manual ef
fort every once in awhile."

bought an old 1958 Cadillac
Coupe de Ville," Paige recounts.
"1 thought I might restore it, but
it was too far gone; really ratty.
So I sold il to somebody else who
thought he might be able to fix it
up."
He took the money and bought
a 1953 Oldsmobile, sold from an
estate. Paige says this is a prefer
able method for buying the cars.
After a few months, he sold the
Olds and found his next "dream
car" in Minnesota, a 1954 Mer
cury with a plexiglas sunroof.
"Most of the roofs were cracked
through the years," he says, "But
this one was all right, and the
previous owner had an extra
one.
"The car had a tendency to get

rather warm inside," he adds.
"Maybe that's why there were
only 7900 of them built."
"When I first bought the
Caddy, it cost me $125," Paige
says, "As time went along I was
able to parlay that into the other
cars. They appreciated in value
just during the time that I had
them."
Any profit, however, was put
into other cars. "Counting gas,
insurance and maintenance, 1
figure 1 break even on every
deal," he says. Except for his first
few cars, Paige has driven every
one as transportation between
Stanford and his home in Moun
tain View.
"I can't keep every one of them
because I don't have the space
nor the money," he says. "Be
sides, I like to experience as
many of the cars from this era as I
can.
"Now, it's even harder to find
the time and space for them. So
my wife and I talked about it and
acquired an almost concourse
(perfect) 1955 MG/TF-1500
Roadster. This was a considera
bly larger investment than be
fore."
Paige says he doesn't do any
major work required on the car.
In fact he says he tries to stay

away from cars that need a sub
stantial amount of work. Smaller
parts and help can be found
through old-car clubs and
magazines. There are some
junkyards in the San Carlos area
which specialize primarily in
parts for 1950s cars.
Paige continues in his praise
of the "last real cars ever built."
"The cars of the '50s are really
something. Each one has a mark
of craftsmans'hip, an individual
character. They're almost con
temporary in performance, as
the speed limit was 55 miles
per-hour when these were built.
"They're roomy, and have all
the options you can get on a car
today. And,"he adds, l 'those
built before 1955 are exempt
from smog controls."
Not everything is rosy,
though.
"The problem is that today the
prices have gone out-of-sight,"
Paige complains. "Dealers and
speculators have gotten into the
market, which makes it hard to
call it a hobby anymore.
"But I still like it,"he adds.
"Mostly 1 just like to tinker with
them. It's good to do something
which requires some manual ef
fort every once in awhile."
