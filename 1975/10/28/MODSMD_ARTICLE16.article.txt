Is it true that A be Mellinkoff, associate political editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, once stole the Daily editor's election? -V.K.
Well, it's a sticky question. Here's the story, according to Dailys
from May 31, June 1 and June 2, 1934.
Apparently a staff election was held near the end of the year. The
votes were Don Douglass, 21; Abe Mellinkoff, 18; Jack Allen, 14.
Since no candidate had received a two-thirds majority, the decision
passed to the Publications Council, a group of media representa
tives which voted 7-0 for Douglass.
But then Mellinkoff stepped in to protest the original election. He
charged that a former Daily editor had exercised a "baneful influ
ence" at the polls, that two staff members had been unfairly
awarded votes, and that there were "trades" in the voting.
And so the ever-effective ASSU took over. An Executive Commit
tee declared the election invalid, and decided that Mellinkoff
would make a better editor.
But the fight was not yet over. Immediately after the Executive
Council's decision, a petition with 392 student signatures (includ
ing that of English Prof. Albert Guerard) demanded Mellinkoff's
recall. Since this occurred the last day of the quarter, it is unlikely
the election ever took place. But a group, including "Dave Pack
ard," was formed to change the ASSU Constitution by-laws regard
ing editor elections.
The last installment in all the controversy came in Mellinkoff's
first editorial (appropriately entitled "Finis") thefollowing year. In
a vitriolic outburst, he charged that a "Poker Trust" had been
running the Daily tor years. This "ruthless group," Mellinkoff said,
"like little Hearstlings on the loose," had made the paper a "jour
nalistic monstrosity." Mellinkoff ended his editorial with
these moving sentiments: ". . . . they (the trust) were seeing the
Daily pass to an editor who publicly preferred bridge to poker, who
could not 'roll his own."
