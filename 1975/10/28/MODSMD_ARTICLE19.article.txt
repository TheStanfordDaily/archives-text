# Digging up shipwrecks is hard work

An underwater excavation

but expertise in maritime law.

noted nautical archeologist said
Friday night.
In a speech sponsored by the
Stanford chapter of the Ar
chaeological Institute of
America, Cynthia Jone Eiseman.
executive director of the Ameri
can Institute of Nautical Ar
chaeology, demonstrated how
all of these skills — and more —
were used in piecing together

the 'whodunit' clues of the now
famous Porticello shipwreck.
"The finds from this wreck are
pitifully small," she said. "But
when studied in conjunction
with materials from other
wrecks, pieces of the puzzle
begin to fall into place."
Eiseman, a member of the
1970 expediton from the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania that exp
lored the fifth century B.C.
wreck in the Straits of Messina
between Sicily and the town of
Porticello, Italy, admitted that
she would raise more questions
than she could answer, due in

part to the looting of the wreck
site by local fishermen in the fall
of 1969.
The first answers were pro
vided by modern technolgoy.
Eiseman said. U.S. Navy divers
using undersea metal detectors
located bronze and lead artifacts
from the ship, while radio
carbon dating of wooden re
mains showed that the ship was
built during the second quarter
of the fifth century B.C.
By analyzing the rosette de
sign on the ship's pottery as well
as the shape of the eight am
phoras (vase-like containers
used to transport wine, oil and
dried fish). Eiseman said she was
able to determine that the ship
sank during the last quarter of
the fifth Century B.C.
A solid background in Creek
history and literature was neces

sary to analyze the expedition's
major find: a bronze head from
what was once a life-sized statue
carried by the ship, Eiseman
noted. Although Eiseman de
termined the head to be a portrait
of a Greek literary figure or
philosopher, the exact identity
of the head remains unknown,
she said.
Using the knowledge that the
statue was from Greece. Eiseman
set out to determine the ship's
home port and destination.
After examining the lead in
gots found aboard ship as well as
knowing through Thucydides
the location and operating con
ditions of lead mines throughout
the Mediterranean during the
period, she proposed a southern
Greek home for the ship and a
destination somewhere in Italy
ortheGreek colonies.

all of these skills — and more —
were used in piecing together

the 'whodunit' clues of the now
famous Porticello shipwreck.
"The finds from this wreck are
pitifully small," she said. "But
when studied in conjunction
with materials from other
wrecks, pieces of the puzzle
begin to fall into place."

wreck in the Straits of Messina
between Sicily and the town of
Porticello, Italy, admitted that
she would raise more questions
than she could answer, due in

part to the looting of the wreck
site by local fishermen in the fall
of 1969.
The first answers were pro
vided by modern technolgoy.
Eiseman said. U.S. Navy divers
using undersea metal detectors
located bronze and lead artifacts
from the ship, while radio
carbon dating of wooden re
mains showed that the ship was
built during the second quarter
of the fifth century B.C.
By analyzing the rosette de
sign on the ship's pottery as well
as the shape of the eight am
phoras (vase-like containers
used to transport wine, oil and
dried fish). Eiseman said she was
able to determine that the ship
sank during the last quarter of
the fifth Century B.C.
A solid background in Creek
history and literature was neces

sary to analyze the expedition's
major find: a bronze head from
what was once a life-sized statue
carried by the ship, Eiseman
noted. Although Eiseman de
termined the head to be a portrait
of a Greek literary figure or
philosopher, the exact identity
of the head remains unknown,
she said.
Using the knowledge that the
statue was from Greece. Eiseman
set out to determine the ship's
home port and destination.
After examining the lead in
gots found aboard ship as well as
knowing through Thucydides
the location and operating con
ditions of lead mines throughout
the Mediterranean during the
period, she proposed a southern
