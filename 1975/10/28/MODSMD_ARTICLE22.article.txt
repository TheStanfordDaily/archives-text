## Robert Klein titillates the crowd 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
Robert Klein performed some of the funniest material
ever seen on the live stage Friday night before a nearly
filled Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
A product of the Chicago improvisational group
"Second City" and a short-lived stint on a CBS summer
replacement, Comedy Tonight. Klein plays very hard at
making us see the, well, weirdness of life's daily occurr
ences.
Like other young comedians who ride the Tonight
Show circuit, he wants to make the listener share in his
vision of absurdities instead of making himself the sub
ject of absurdity.
Addressing the subject of "anthropomorphisms,"
Klein pointed out the human qualities that the media
ascribe to animals.
Smokey the Bear
"The picture they give you of Smokey the Bear, wear
ing suspenders and a ranger hat and talking in a deep,
friendly voice is just great until somebody goes to Yel
lowstone Park and sticks out his hand to say. Hi,
Smokey.' Smokey then bites his head off."
Turning to cockroaches: "I really love those 'Raid'
commercials. First they show a bunch of cockroaches
boogying in the cupboard. Then the groups' lookout
screams, 'Watch out, it's "Raid".' Out walks this
fascist-looking can, puts his hand to his head and
squirts them. They flash a big 'DEAD' on the screen,
followed by tombstones, 'rest-in-peace,' and cruc
ifices."

"It wouldn't be so bad except the stufl doesn't even
work. I mean, the only time 'Raid' works is when you
drown them in it. Then the guy at home sticks the can in
his pocket, saying 'Sure got that one. Only three million
more to go.' "
College dates
Klein talked about his college dates around the coun
try. He said that at Alabama he found that the students
didn't care for Ceorge Wallace, "except that there are
only four students in Alabama."
At the Air Force Academy, he was surprised to find
that his stereotype of the grev-suited cadets was shat
tered, but added that when the audience laughed, "it
looked like a Brillo pad moving from side to side. And
what was worse, when the show was over, they all
marched out in columns, chanting 'Robert Klein, he is
fine, Robert Klein, he is fine.' "
Klein drew his biggest applause from material that
was familiar to the audience from his TV appearances
and albums. In his encore he retold the story of visiting
his dentist's office, "where the lamps are in the shape of
molars and they have magazines like Better Flossing on
the table."
This type of story-telling is perfectly suited for Klein,
allowing him to make grimaces and body movements to
enhance his stand-up patter.
Pop songs
Somewhat less successful, but still quite funny, was
his use of that mainstay of the improvisational come

dian. the pop song composed of unconnected words
suggested by the audience.
Klein's political satire was sneaky, and therefore,
successful. Railing out against "those crumb-bums
Nixon. Agnew and Wallace." Klein singled out Ted
Agnew for special treatment.
"Agnew is such a crumb-bum that he even took a
second-rate bribe. He was Vice-President and he was
still taking hundred dollar bills and Christmas turkeys
from tailors in Maryland."
On the other hand. Klein thought astronaut Neil Arm
strong is a genuine good guy!
Coca-Cola
"Do you realize how rich Armstrong could have been
if when he took that first step, instead of that 'One small
step' jazz, he would have yelled out 'Coca-Cola'?"
In the last four years. Klein has developed greater
rapport with an audience and has subjugated his some
what pompous air.
He rebounded quickly from material that didn't click
and fended off the infamous Stanford hecklers by either
pulling with the punches, or emitting his trademark
stinger sound. "0000-eeee" which Klein says he bor
rowed from the soundtrack of the movie. Them, when
the monster is about to suck out all the flesh of the
victim, leaving just the skin.
After two hours of first-rate comedy. Klein had satis
fied, if not satiated, those who had come.
