# LA 						Four plays imaginative jazz in a varied Mem Aud performance

### SALLY OURIEFF 
The jazz enthusiasts who
packed Memorial Auditorium
Friday night certainly dis
played their good taste. The per
formance by the acclaimed LA
Four proved to be jazz at its very
best.
With a full program including
an encore, the older, jazz "wise"
audience remained in a state of
contented awe. Not only was the
playing overwhelming in its vir
tuosity, but the selection of
pieces exhibited the incredible
dimensions of jazz music.
Purely an accoustical group,
one was amazed at the variety of
sound and rhythm they were
able to create.
The artists, Laurindo Almeida
(guitar), Bud Shank (sax and
flute), Ray Brown (bass), and
Shelly Marine (drums) are. indi
vidually. perhaps the finest jazz
players alive.
Variety
The variety of their music
ranged from overtones of classi
cal, to Brazilian samba, even to
deep blues.
The most intriguing quality of
the LA Four was their adaptation
of classical works into the jazz
style and beat. Taking pieces of
Chopin or Bach, they merged in
the classical as the foundation
for their jazz composition.
Almeida seemed to be the

source behind these pieces,
using his guitar to weave the two
together. In the Chopin piece,
opening with a duet between
Almeida and Brown, his playing
was strikingly clear and pure.
As the piece progressed. Al
meida made the transition from
th classical interpretation into
the jazz rhythm so effortlessly
that it seemed Chopin had writ
ten it himself.
Brazilian rhythm
What those pieces illustrated
was how much wider the dimen
sions of these two types of music
really are.
One of the highlights of the
evening was "Berimbau
Caroca," written by Almeida
and featuring Manne on a
Brazilian wood instrument. It is
made out of a rod of Jacaranda
wood, a gourd and a wire, and is
played with the help of a coin to
change octaves.
As suggested bv its half bow,
half waterpipe-like shape,
Manne explained, "If you tried
hard enough, you could proba
bly hunt and even smoke with
this thing." But when it is sim
ply played, its rattle and twang
definitely set the Brazilian
mood.
Flute solo
In "Berimbau Caroca" Bud
Shank played an overwhelming
flute solo. His control was flaw

less, even in the complicated
runs and fast tempo. His stamina
was present in every piece and
had he lost his instrument, the
movements of his body could
have carried the melody.
In his original work "Ballad,"
Shank's wailing sax went right
through you. The emotions in
his piece were carried by the
depth and quality of his sound.
The most creative playing
among the four was by Shelly
Manne on drums.
His innovative style continu
ously holds oner interest. In one
piece, "Variations On A Theme"
by John Birks Gillespie, he used
his hands and fists to drum,
creating a deeper, more blues
style.
Another, "Canon" by Almeida
and Manne, was based on the
pitches of a series of cow bells
Manne often incorporates into
his music.
Dynamic
This piece was more interest
ing than some of the others be
cause of its more modern,
dynamic quality. However, it
was inconsistent and weak in its
various transitions.
Incorporated between the
duets of Almeida and Manne
were sections of rather unim
aginative jazz played by the en
tire group.
Not only did these sections

seem out of place, but the transi
tions into them were awkward
and stilted.
However, Manne's playing
remained strong throughout the
evening. The myriad of sounds
he accomplished made it hard to
believe he was playing just one
instrument. His use of the per
cussions shadowed and ac
cented, adding even greater
depth to the group's interpreta
tions.
Ray Brown on the bass sent
through the audience another
wave of awe.
Playing much more than just
background rhythm, Brown es
tablished his bass as a lead in
strument.
Out of the group, he seemed
most consistently to be in the
mainstream of the music. He
played an integral part in the
melodies of the pieces, showing
great versatility and skili.
