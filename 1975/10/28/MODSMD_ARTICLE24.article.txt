Sam Rivers, one of jazz's most
imagiikitive instrumentalists,
entertained a small crowd at the
New Varsity Theatre Jast Wed
nesday night. The show was the
/irst in a series that promises to
bring jazz to Pulo Alto every
week. *
Rivers, leading a trio, played
two hour-long improvisations as
he played four different instru
ments and occasionally sung
wordlessly with his hand. Rivers
opened on tenor sax, his best
known instrument and he
showed his ability to play at al
most any dynamic level
with a growling tone halfway be
tween speech and conventional
playing.
A highlight was Rivers' sweet
unaccompanied solo on the sop
rano sax. joined later by his fine
local bassist, Chris Anburger.
On flute, Rivers got what
sounded like a primitive three
part harmony by humming and
playing simultaneously.
And surprisingly, the in
strumentalist played two strong
piano solos that showed the in
fluence of Rivers' one-time
bandleader, Cecil Taylor.
