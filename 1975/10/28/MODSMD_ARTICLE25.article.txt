# At Circle Star Theatre
## Pointers, Smokey 'smooth' 
### BOB HENRY 
The Circle Star Theatre's revolving stage be
came a showcase for The Pointer Sisters and
Smokey Robinson over the weekend and both
groups gave a smooth, professional show.
The Pointer Sisters have shed their 1930s dres
ses for long,curvaceous evening gowns and their
incomparable vocal blend and amazing fit with
the tight rhythm section has improved.
They sang songs from all their albums — "I
Ain't Got Nothin' But The Blues/Satin Doll" and
"Going Down Slowly"; "Step-in." "Bangin' On
The Pipes/Steam Heaf'and "flow Long (Chick On
The Side)." "That's A Plenty" and "Yes We Can."
Steady flow
The Pointer Sisters have gone from choir
singing Oakland minister's daughters to compe
tent, entertaining performers; their show main
tained an even, steady flow.
Midway through their act. after telling the au
dience "these brown babies gonna boogie for
you." Ruth. Jane, Bonnie and Anita did "Yes We
Can" with a vocal sound-effect blending into
"How bong" which the audience enthusiastically
accepted. They sang "Salt Peanuts" as an encore
after a 50 minute set.
Smokey Robinson, no longer with The Mira
cles, has an excellent back-up band, a new album,
and a song all entitled "Quiet Storm." His show
after the Pointer Sisters was a steady downpour of
solid, tender, emotional singing and suave sensu

ality as he sang about love, true love, not making it
without you. being nothing without you, needing
you, you being everything and even "The Way
We Were."
Adulation
The women in the audience responded by tos
sing bracelets and necklaces on stage, running up
and touching him and screaming adulation and
undying love.
One lucky lass managed to get past the
Smokey-protectors around the stage and give the
man a solid kiss on the cheek.
Robinson said he was "singing whatever you
say." and sang audience requests for songs like "I
Second That Emotion," "Tears of a Clown " and
"Tracks of My Tears."
Professionalism
He smoothly sang Stevie Wonder's "You Are
The Sunshine Of My Life," "1 Am " and other
tunes from the "Quiet Storm" album.
It first appeared Smokey was going to out-do
The Pointer Sisters on continuity, but he stopped
to babble and be funny between a few of his songs,
which destroyed the natural flow from one song to
another.
His professionalism, knack for knowing exactly
what the audience wanted, and his radiance of
unassuming sexuality, though, could not be seri
ously tarnished by his abundant talking. Smokin'
Smokey entertained the ladies and they dug it.

"Going Down Slowly"; "Step-in." "Bangin' On
The Pipes/Steam Heaf'and "flow Long (Chick On
The Side)." "That's A Plenty" and "Yes We Can."
Steady flow
The Pointer Sisters have gone from choir
singing Oakland minister's daughters to compe
tent, entertaining performers; their show main
tained an even, steady flow.
Midway through their act. after telling the au
dience "these brown babies gonna boogie for
you." Ruth. Jane, Bonnie and Anita did "Yes We
Can" with a vocal sound-effect blending into
"How bong" which the audience enthusiastically
accepted. They sang "Salt Peanuts" as an encore
after a 50 minute set.
Smokey Robinson, no longer with The Mira
cles, has an excellent back-up band, a new album,
and a song all entitled "Quiet Storm." His show
after the Pointer Sisters was a steady downpour of
solid, tender, emotional singing and suave sensu

ality as he sang about love, true love, not making it
without you. being nothing without you, needing
you, you being everything and even "The Way
We Were."
Adulation
The women in the audience responded by tos
sing bracelets and necklaces on stage, running up
and touching him and screaming adulation and
undying love.
One lucky lass managed to get past the
Smokey-protectors around the stage and give the
man a solid kiss on the cheek.
Robinson said he was "singing whatever you
say." and sang audience requests for songs like "I
Second That Emotion," "Tears of a Clown " and
"Tracks of My Tears."
Professionalism
He smoothly sang Stevie Wonder's "You Are
The Sunshine Of My Life," "1 Am " and other
tunes from the "Quiet Storm" album.
It first appeared Smokey was going to out-do
The Pointer Sisters on continuity, but he stopped
to babble and be funny between a few of his songs,
which destroyed the natural flow from one song to
another.
His professionalism, knack for knowing exactly
what the audience wanted, and his radiance of
unassuming sexuality, though, could not be seri
ously tarnished by his abundant talking. Smokin'
Smokey entertained the ladies and they dug it.
The Circle Star Theatre's revolving stage be
came a showcase for The Pointer Sisters and
Smokey Robinson over the weekend and both
groups gave a smooth, professional show.
The Pointer Sisters have shed their 1930s dres
ses for long,curvaceous evening gowns and their
incomparable vocal blend and amazing fit with
the tight rhythm section has improved.
They sang songs from all their albums — "I
Ain't Got Nothin' But The Blues/Satin Doll" and
"Going Down Slowly"; "Step-in." "Bangin' On
The Pipes/Steam Heaf'and "flow Long (Chick On
The Side)." "That's A Plenty" and "Yes We Can."
