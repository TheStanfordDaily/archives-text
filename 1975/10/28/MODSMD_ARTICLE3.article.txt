# Faisan residents debate going coed
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
Faisan, the only single-sex, four
class dormitory on campus, is discus
sing the possibility of going coed. The
matter has been brought to the atten
tion of the Student Housing Office
through Faisan Resident Associates
(RAs) and staff and has been discussed
by the 61 residents at house meetings.
"Absolutely no decision will be
made without full participation of
everyone in Faisan," said Larrv Hor
ton, associate dean of student affairs.
When asked why women in Faisan
want to go coed, one RA said that it
seemed to be the "prevailing trend."
"There are only a few people who
really wanted to live in an all-girl
dorm," said Diane Middlebrook, resi
dent coordinating fellow.
Many girls placed here agreed to ac
cept placement "any place where they
qualify" in last spring's Housing
Draw, according to Leah Kaplan, assis
tant dean of student affairs for women
students.
Faisan could go coed as early as next
quarter, according to Karen Murray,
assistant to the Dean of Student Af
fairs. However, housing options can be

changed midyear only if there is
unanimous support for the change,
and each person's opinion was "indi
vidually assessed" with no group
pressure on any one individual, said
Murray.
If one resident doesn't want to go
coed, the dorm doesn't go coed.
"This is a very touchy situation,"
said one resident who declined to be
identified. "We had thought of making
one or two floors coed as a com
promise measure at house meetings,
but during floor meetings, there were
people who were really against it.
People felt they were being coerced
into going coed."
She added, "I'm sure we're not
going to go coed — at least not for this
quarter."
The Student Housing Office will be
conducting a "thorough study of the
situation," said Middlebrook, and a
meeting, which includes Middleb
rook, Administration Fellow Liz
Chowning, the Faisan RAs and Kap
lan, is scheduled for next Tuesday.
