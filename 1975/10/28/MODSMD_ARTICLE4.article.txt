Graduates and instructors of the creative writing prog
ram have won awards ranging from the Pulitzer Prize to
the Best Science Award. They have written popular books,
produced widely acclaimed movies and have been com
pared by reviewers to Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Faulk
ner.
Richard P. Scowcroft. director of the Creative Writing
Center, explains, "The goal (of the department) is for stu
dents in creative writing courses to come to a better reali
zation of literature. They learn to view a book as a thing
created, not just published."
Assoc. English Prof. Nancy H. Packer echoes Scowcroft
and points out that creative writing is valuable in its
exercise of the mind and its training in observation and
writing, even though on occasion it is mistakenly referred
to as "unscholarly."
