# Six STAND members on Senate
## 
### JACK VAUGHN 
Final results from the ASSU Senate
election show that five under
graduates and one graduate member of
the Students Taking a New Direction
(STAND) slate were elected senators.
Two of last year's senators, Kevin
McDermott and Tim Conway, were re
turned to the hody.
Vote totals were not complete until
ballots were received from overseas
campuses, according to ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Mike Murray.
Four of the campuses — Cliveden,
Vienna, Florence and Tours — did re
turn ballots, Murray said.
The other five campuses sent no
votes, although the Bonn campus was

the only one to notify the ASSU that it
was not participating, said Murray. He
added that ASSU President Lee
Rosenbaum had set a deadline of noon
yesterday for receiving ballots from
overseas.
The only effect of the newly
returned votes was to place Cooper
Chao among the top 20 undergraduate
vote-getters, replacing Frank Coari.
Candidates ranking between 10th and
20th in each category serve as alter
nates, with the right to debate in the
Senate and replace absent and res
igned senators on roll call votes.
Some 51 overseas students voted on
the Lake Lagunita Boathouse fee as
sessment, but the total number of par
ticipants remained below the 20 per
cent of the student body required to
validate the measure, according to
Murray.
The first Senate meeting will be held
tonight at 7 p.m. in Rm. 75 of the Busi
ness School. ASSU Vice President
Josie Jaramillo will open the meeting.
Senate meetings are open to the pub
lic.
