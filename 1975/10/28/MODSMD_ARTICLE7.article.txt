# This year's 'Quad' stresses quality plus a trimmer budget

### SALLY BRAY 
Despite inflation, the
Stanford Quad has "at least broken
even over the last two years" and is
presently in "no financial danger," ac
cording to Quad editor Jeff Gerecke.
Gerecke attributed the lack of finan
cial success in past Quad volumes to
poor financial management. He said
the 1975-76 Quad is concentrating on
responsible financial management
and plans to order fewer books to in
sure breaking even.
The introductory price of the Quad
is $10, but the book will cost $12 after
Jan. 12, 1976.
When asked why the book is more
expensive than pre-1973 volumes
which sold for $7, Gerecke said, "pub
lishing costs have gone up considera
bly." Gerecke explained the price in
crease after Jan. 12 is "to encourage
people to buy ahead of time," because
the book order is placed Jan. 15.
Four sections
Approximately 50 pages shorter
than the 1974-75 yearbook, this year's
Quad will consist of four main sec
tions entitled "Academics," "Athle
tics," "Activities" and "People."
The Quad staff is placing a special
emphasis on campus residences this
year. More pages have been assigned
to residences than in the past, and a
"big effort" will be made to improve
the scheduling and quality of resi
dence pictures, said Gerecke.
Within the Quad's academic sec
tion, there will be a new emphasis on
individual professors and their out
side interests. Full pages will be given
to selected faculty members, and in
terviews will be conducted to create "a
reflection of their personalities,"
commented Gerecke.
In the Quad's senior section, the sit
ting fee for senior pictures is $2. "ex
actly the same as last year," according
to Quad business manager. Norm Hal
leen. The fee is payable to Keith Cole

Photography, located in Redwood
City.
Professional portraits
Gerecke explained that the Quad
staff decided to use a professional
photographer, after using staff photo
graphers in 1974, as a service to
seniors who want a portrait picture
taken.
He also said using staff photo
graphers "involves a great deal of
time," and the result in 1974, in terms

of photography quality, was "not
good."
The Quad's copy quality will also be
improved this year, according to
Gerecke. In Gerecke's opinion, the
typographical errors in the 1974-75
volume of the Quad were "a function
of carelessness."
He said this year's copy editor will
be responsible for going over proof
sheets and checking names with Uni
versity lists.

AND THE CUPBOARD WAS . . . FULL? — Well, at least financially speak
ing, it's not as bad as last year, or as bare as the cupboard 'Quad' editor JefT
Gerecke attempted to put up yesterday afternoon. Gerecke said fewer annuals
will be printed this year in order to keep down spiralling costs which plunged
the 'Quad' into the red a year ago.
