## Opinions editorial Keep EDPs 
### 
We welcome the Ad Hoc Panel on the Future of
Extradepartmental Programs' (EDP) recommendation
that SWOPSI, SCIRE and the Undergraduate Specials
Program remain autonomous.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James (libbs sum
med up the committee's message as advocating "sepa
rate programs, separate boards and more places to have
students involved in shaping policy."
Everyone realizes the value of continued innovative
educational opportunities. These can best be accomp
lished by allowing extradepartmental programs to re
main autonomous, rather than being consolidated
with the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
as Gibbs proposed last year.
Gibbs should be especially commended for taking
the panel's recommendations seriously and changing
his position on the issue. We hope the Faculty Senate
will listen to Gibbs and the Panel and allow these
programs to be continued.
In order that these programs remain effective, they
will have to have a stable financial base on which to
operate. Gibbs said he is not considering any further
cuts in their budgets, which is a good sign for the near
future.
But to assure long-range stability, arrangements
should be made for regular funding. This would elimi
nate the annual battles to obtain enough money to
make continuation of the programs worthwhile.
The EDPs have provided students with the oppor
tunity to explore diverse, intriguing, interdepartmen
tal subjects that would otherwise not fit into the
University's curriculum.
