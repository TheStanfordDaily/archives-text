# Korean repression

Mann, Peterson

With the transformation of Saigon into Ho (Tii Minh City, we at
Stanford, and at all universities, are in danger of placing Southeast
Asia beyond the perimeter of our consciousness.
There currently seems to be a remarkableinsensitivity to current
injustices in South Korea.
Today, our government is throwing its support ever more solidly
behind President Park Cluing I lee in spite of his escalating denial
ol human rights. The voices protesting this support have been few.
It is important to understand why the U.S. government is so
tightly committed to the Park regime.
U.S.- and Japanese-based multinational corporations derive
huge benefits l>\ placing factories in the low wage labor pool of
South Korea. These I !.S. companies have terminated hundreds of
thousands of blue collar manufacturing jobs over the past 10 years
and moved them to South Korea.
Additionally.tax havens created by South Korea's "export proces
sing zones" make multinational runaways irresistable.
Wages are extremely low — the average hourly rate for clothing
workers is 20 cents per hour. Strikes in foreign owned plants are
forbidden and the government can compel arbitration.
The I I.S. Commerce Department currently rates South Korea as a
"favorable investment climate." And Prime Minister Kim Jong Pil
explicitly said the emergency measures that deny rights of dissent
were necessary to assure "stability and economic progress."
Poet Kim Chi lia has raised one of the most significant voices
against the repression by his government as well as against the
unjust economic system in which his people labor.
Kim is currently in prison for his writing and he has been there
for most of the last two years. I le faces a sentence of life imprison
ment following his trial, which is now in progress.
The painful truth of what is happening in South Korea can best
be seen through a selected chronology of events over the last six
years. We pick this chronology up in October. 1909. when Park has
the constitution revised in the absence ot the opposition party, to
allow his running for a .'trd term. I'rom there:
January 27, 1972: The Washington Post reports: President Park
told his cabinet "We must encourage t LS. corporation has as much
siigniticanceand effect as a division of ground forces in terms of I'S
presence."
April 3. 1974: Emergency Decree No. -4 one of the more extreme
lawsagainst studentsand universities anywhere, makes it a crime
punishable bv death for students to refuse to attend classes or to
join in demonstrations, discussions, rallies or any other type of
political activity. Eight hundred a rearrested. A search is started for
dozens of student leaders with up to $5000 rewards offered.
May 19,1975: Secretary of Defense James Scldesinger warns North
Korea that the U.S. will defend Korea in a manner unlike Vietnam
and hints about the use of nuclear weapons.
