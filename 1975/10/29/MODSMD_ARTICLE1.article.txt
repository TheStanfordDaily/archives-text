## Enrollment boost only if pressed 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The University would consider ex
panding its enrollment in order to
generate income only it laced with
"stillii ientlv severe limine i<iI ( ircunis
tiUK.es. according to President
Richard Lyman.
Speaking l.ist night on KZSU's
(,'u/ii/mis Conference, Lyman re
sponded to a new Budget Priorities
Commission t.isk force report which
states tliiit expansion ol enrollment ot
ters ( nnsiderable income potential hut
could negatively allect the
University's ahilitv to attract top
academic talent in the long run. *
"We wouldn't want to do anything
that would adversely allect academic
quality just to generatea small amount
ol income," Lyman said.
Hut il the University were finan
cially threatened and needed to reduce
its programs drastically, it would
choose the "least damaging consequ
ence" and admit more students.
I.vman said.
Noting that the report indicated that
an enrollment increase should be con
sidered onl\ as a finam ial last resort.
Lyman said the (Commission would
probably seriously consider the task
force's tears about increasing enroll
ment.
Lyman also said the task force might
be correct in its observation that many
academically promisi tin appi i< ants for
admission choose to attend other in
stitutions because thev perceive
Stanford's undergraduate program to
be weaker than its graduate schools.
Hut l,\ man said be strongly disag
rees with students who take this view.
"Ironically, this belief is derived
from the fact that we have extremely
distinguished graduate si hools" and
some people therefore wrongly as
sume that undergraduate education is
neglec led. Lvinati said. "Schools such
as Princeton that have no array of
graduate schools to compete for the
limelight with their undergraduate
program are better able to emphasize
their undergraduate studies."
Lyman added that "our task is to
make the professional schools an asset
rather than a liability to undergraduate
education."
He explained that programs such as
human biology grew out of graduate
programs and he expressed hope that
interaction between graduate and un
dergraduate studies will increase.
In other remarks. Lyman said he bas
ically agrees with the recommenda
tion by the Ad Hoc Panel on Extra De

partmental Programs that SWOPSI.
SCIRE and the Undergraduate Spe
cials program remain autonomous.
"If we waited for departments to
take up these programs, they'd be
squeezed down very far," Lyman said.
"They would lose some of their spon
taneity and some of their value."
Lyman chided students who pro
tested proposed cuts in the programs
for wrongly assuming that the Univer
sity would eliminate the programs.
"It is hard to account for the rapidity
with which students assumed that the
programs would die," Lyman said.
"I think they will survive although
they are not as richly funded as we'd
like them to be," Lyman added.

"I think they will survive although
they are not as richly funded as we'd
like them to be," Lyman added.
The University would consider ex
panding its enrollment in order to
generate income only it laced with
"stillii ientlv severe limine i<iI ( ircunis
tiUK.es. according to President
Richard Lyman.
Speaking l.ist night on KZSU's
(,'u/ii/mis Conference, Lyman re
sponded to a new Budget Priorities
Commission t.isk force report which
states tliiit expansion ol enrollment ot
ters ( nnsiderable income potential hut
could negatively allect the
University's ahilitv to attract top
academic talent in the long run. *
"We wouldn't want to do anything
that would adversely allect academic
quality just to generatea small amount
ol income," Lyman said.
Hut il the University were finan
cially threatened and needed to reduce
its programs drastically, it would
choose the "least damaging consequ
ence" and admit more students.
I.vman said.
Noting that the report indicated that
an enrollment increase should be con
sidered onl\ as a finam ial last resort.
Lyman said the (Commission would
probably seriously consider the task
force's tears about increasing enroll
ment.
Lyman also said the task force might
be correct in its observation that many
academically promisi tin appi i< ants for
admission choose to attend other in
stitutions because thev perceive
Stanford's undergraduate program to
be weaker than its graduate schools.
Hut l,\ man said be strongly disag
rees with students who take this view.
"Ironically, this belief is derived
from the fact that we have extremely
distinguished graduate si hools" and
some people therefore wrongly as
sume that undergraduate education is
neglec led. Lvinati said. "Schools such
as Princeton that have no array of
graduate schools to compete for the
limelight with their undergraduate
program are better able to emphasize
their undergraduate studies."
Lyman added that "our task is to
make the professional schools an asset
rather than a liability to undergraduate
education."
He explained that programs such as
human biology grew out of graduate
programs and he expressed hope that
interaction between graduate and un
dergraduate studies will increase.
In other remarks. Lyman said he bas
ically agrees with the recommenda
tion by the Ad Hoc Panel on Extra De

partmental Programs that SWOPSI.
SCIRE and the Undergraduate Spe
cials program remain autonomous.
"If we waited for departments to
take up these programs, they'd be
squeezed down very far," Lyman said.
"They would lose some of their spon
taneity and some of their value."
Lyman chided students who pro
tested proposed cuts in the programs
for wrongly assuming that the Univer
sity would eliminate the programs.
"It is hard to account for the rapidity
with which students assumed that the
programs would die," Lyman said.
"I think they will survive although
they are not as richly funded as we'd
like them to be," Lyman added.
