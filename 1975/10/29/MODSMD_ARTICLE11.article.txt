# Eccentrics flock to Hearst cell
## 
### 
It's probably tht? most secure women's
dormitory in tin; May Area.
And with good reason.
Tim San Mateo County jail in Redwood
City houses two of the most notorious
female inmates in the state. There's Sara
|ane Moore, accused of attempting to assas
sinate President Ford. And there's news
paper heiress Patricia Hearst, whose appar
ent abduction by the Symbinnese Liberation
Armv and subsequent life as a fugitive form
the nexus of a still-to-be-unraveled mystery.
A White House aide recently branded
Northern California as the "kook capital" ot
the world. And these women represent the
stuff of which such impressions are made:
attempted presidential assassinations, un
derground revolutionary cults.
Now. both are locked up on the fourth
floor ot an institution known for its air
tight security, in separate cells, six to eight
feet apart across a narrow hallway. They
may face each other and talk through the
bars.
Kook convention
Suddenly, it's as if someone placed a bill
board outside the Hall of Justice to advertise
some kind of "kook" convention. Delegates
trickle into the first-floor lobby, one by one.
Most want to see Hearst. There was Walt
Wagner. 25. who said he was a law student
from Sacramento. He carried the autobiog
raphy of psychic llri Celler under one arm
and some instamatic photos snapped at the
"mystery spot" in Santa Cruz in his pocket.
bike any of the 100 or more people who
mill through the lobby during jail visiting
hours, he may wait in line, sign his name,
present some form of identification and re
quest to see an inmate.
He is turned a way after the reserve deputy
at the desk telephones the jail and is told
that Hearst has never heard of the fellow.
Wagner is disappointed, but not discour
aged.
He returns the following week. Again un
able to visit Patty, he corners her father.

Randolph Hearst, in the lobby. Wagner exp
lains that lie wanted to tell Patty ot Uri
Cleller's psychic powers "to help her grow
some more, so she'll have a good defense."
Good intentions
Fortunately, most "kooks" have similar
good intentions. A Los Angeles man who
signs the visitors' roster as "20th Century
Fox" offers Patty a special message "from an
eclectic elitist retrospective."

Grant Kendall. 23, of Berkeley, writes
Fatty a note declaring his intention to keep a
vigil outside the Hall of Justice for her re
lease on hail. He holds up a sign, hand
lettered on flimsy white paper, reading,
"Free Patty Hearst to her home." lie
apologizes to a reporter: "Sorry. I couldn't
think of anything more original than that."
Rut it is a cold Saturday afternoon. The
sun is fickle and rain is expected by even
ing. Twenty minutes later, Kendall is gone.
Routine procedure
The comings and goings have little effect
on the routine jail-visit procedure. Yet, a
woman who came to visit her husband was
somewhat uneasy. "I'd rather be up there (in
the jail) than down here (in the lobby)," she
said. "Upstairs they know who the kooks
are; they're locked up. Down here, you just
have to guess."
There was no need to guess about Albin
Sylversteen, 56. He and his wife had driven
to Redwood City from Chicago in a battered
1963 station wagon. The trip took more than

two weeks because the car kept breaking
down.
Sylversteen. about 5-foot-fi with faded
blue eyes, chopped shocks of gray liair and
stubbly gray whiskers, reeks of cats. That's
because there are '*10 big cats and 1 don't
know how many little ones" in the couple's
car. he explains. The cats dine on veal cut
lets and salmon while the Svlversteens eat
liver sausage sandwiches. Sylversteen savs
that his wife suffers from a serious gallblad
der ailment and that doctors say she has just
a few months to live.
The sign on the couple's car proclaims
their intention to take Patricia Hearst's
place. "Then she'd be set free and she could
do everything in her power to prepare a
defense." Sylversteen explains. "I don't
want power or money; I just want justice
and truth."
Penniless Hearsts?
Sylversteen. a pensioner, also brought a
$5 check. "Regardless of whether she's rich
or poor I want her to have it."he says. "Her
parents sav they're rich, but maybe they
don't have a cent."
Apparently his explanations weren't good
enough for the deputies. They're profes
sionals and proud of it. Dealing with kooks
quickly is just part of their job. Sylversteen
is asked to wait and the desk sergeant calls
the FBI.
Sylversteen dons thick, Mr. Magoo glas
ses. "A man travels over 2000 miles to see
Patty Hearst and they treat him like a com
mon criminal." he mutters.
After the KB 1 call is completed. Sylvers
teen leaves the building. He and his wife
embark on a return trip to Chicago. Califor
nia weather doesn't agree with them, he
says. Not damp enough.
Somewhere in the White House, an aide
may be relieved to know that California
doesn't have a corner on the kook market.

It's probably tht? most secure women's
dormitory in tin; May Area.
And with good reason.
Tim San Mateo County jail in Redwood
City houses two of the most notorious
female inmates in the state. There's Sara
|ane Moore, accused of attempting to assas
sinate President Ford. And there's news
paper heiress Patricia Hearst, whose appar
ent abduction by the Symbinnese Liberation
Armv and subsequent life as a fugitive form
the nexus of a still-to-be-unraveled mystery.
A White House aide recently branded
Northern California as the "kook capital" ot
the world. And these women represent the
stuff of which such impressions are made:
attempted presidential assassinations, un
derground revolutionary cults.
Now. both are locked up on the fourth
floor ot an institution known for its air
tight security, in separate cells, six to eight
feet apart across a narrow hallway. They
may face each other and talk through the
bars.
Kook convention
Suddenly, it's as if someone placed a bill
board outside the Hall of Justice to advertise
some kind of "kook" convention. Delegates
trickle into the first-floor lobby, one by one.
Most want to see Hearst. There was Walt
Wagner. 25. who said he was a law student
from Sacramento. He carried the autobiog
raphy of psychic llri Celler under one arm
and some instamatic photos snapped at the
"mystery spot" in Santa Cruz in his pocket.
bike any of the 100 or more people who
mill through the lobby during jail visiting
hours, he may wait in line, sign his name,
present some form of identification and re
quest to see an inmate.
He is turned a way after the reserve deputy
at the desk telephones the jail and is told
that Hearst has never heard of the fellow.
Wagner is disappointed, but not discour
aged.
He returns the following week. Again un
able to visit Patty, he corners her father.

Randolph Hearst, in the lobby. Wagner exp
lains that lie wanted to tell Patty ot Uri
Cleller's psychic powers "to help her grow
some more, so she'll have a good defense."
Good intentions
Fortunately, most "kooks" have similar
good intentions. A Los Angeles man who
signs the visitors' roster as "20th Century
Fox" offers Patty a special message "from an
eclectic elitist retrospective."

Grant Kendall. 23, of Berkeley, writes
Fatty a note declaring his intention to keep a
vigil outside the Hall of Justice for her re
lease on hail. He holds up a sign, hand
lettered on flimsy white paper, reading,
"Free Patty Hearst to her home." lie
apologizes to a reporter: "Sorry. I couldn't
think of anything more original than that."
Rut it is a cold Saturday afternoon. The
sun is fickle and rain is expected by even
ing. Twenty minutes later, Kendall is gone.
Routine procedure
The comings and goings have little effect
on the routine jail-visit procedure. Yet, a
woman who came to visit her husband was
somewhat uneasy. "I'd rather be up there (in
the jail) than down here (in the lobby)," she
said. "Upstairs they know who the kooks
are; they're locked up. Down here, you just
have to guess."
There was no need to guess about Albin
Sylversteen, 56. He and his wife had driven
to Redwood City from Chicago in a battered
1963 station wagon. The trip took more than

two weeks because the car kept breaking
down.
Sylversteen. about 5-foot-fi with faded
blue eyes, chopped shocks of gray liair and
stubbly gray whiskers, reeks of cats. That's
because there are '*10 big cats and 1 don't
know how many little ones" in the couple's
car. he explains. The cats dine on veal cut
lets and salmon while the Svlversteens eat
liver sausage sandwiches. Sylversteen savs
that his wife suffers from a serious gallblad
der ailment and that doctors say she has just
a few months to live.
The sign on the couple's car proclaims
their intention to take Patricia Hearst's
place. "Then she'd be set free and she could
do everything in her power to prepare a
defense." Sylversteen explains. "I don't
want power or money; I just want justice
and truth."

There was no need to guess about Albin
Sylversteen, 56. He and his wife had driven
to Redwood City from Chicago in a battered
1963 station wagon. The trip took more than

two weeks because the car kept breaking
down.
Sylversteen. about 5-foot-fi with faded
blue eyes, chopped shocks of gray liair and
stubbly gray whiskers, reeks of cats. That's
because there are '*10 big cats and 1 don't
know how many little ones" in the couple's
car. he explains. The cats dine on veal cut
lets and salmon while the Svlversteens eat
liver sausage sandwiches. Sylversteen savs
that his wife suffers from a serious gallblad
der ailment and that doctors say she has just
a few months to live.
The sign on the couple's car proclaims
their intention to take Patricia Hearst's
place. "Then she'd be set free and she could
do everything in her power to prepare a
defense." Sylversteen explains. "I don't
want power or money; I just want justice
and truth."
Penniless Hearsts?
Sylversteen. a pensioner, also brought a
$5 check. "Regardless of whether she's rich
or poor I want her to have it."he says. "Her
parents sav they're rich, but maybe they
don't have a cent."
Apparently his explanations weren't good
enough for the deputies. They're profes
sionals and proud of it. Dealing with kooks
quickly is just part of their job. Sylversteen
is asked to wait and the desk sergeant calls
the FBI.
Sylversteen dons thick, Mr. Magoo glas
ses. "A man travels over 2000 miles to see
Patty Hearst and they treat him like a com
mon criminal." he mutters.
After the KB 1 call is completed. Sylvers
teen leaves the building. He and his wife
embark on a return trip to Chicago. Califor
nia weather doesn't agree with them, he
says. Not damp enough.
Somewhere in the White House, an aide
may be relieved to know that California
doesn't have a corner on the kook market.

It's probably tht? most secure women's
dormitory in tin; May Area.
And with good reason.
Tim San Mateo County jail in Redwood
City houses two of the most notorious
female inmates in the state. There's Sara
|ane Moore, accused of attempting to assas
sinate President Ford. And there's news
paper heiress Patricia Hearst, whose appar
ent abduction by the Symbinnese Liberation
Armv and subsequent life as a fugitive form
the nexus of a still-to-be-unraveled mystery.
A White House aide recently branded
Northern California as the "kook capital" ot
the world. And these women represent the
stuff of which such impressions are made:
attempted presidential assassinations, un
derground revolutionary cults.
Now. both are locked up on the fourth
floor ot an institution known for its air
tight security, in separate cells, six to eight
feet apart across a narrow hallway. They
may face each other and talk through the
bars.
Kook convention
Suddenly, it's as if someone placed a bill
board outside the Hall of Justice to advertise
some kind of "kook" convention. Delegates
trickle into the first-floor lobby, one by one.
Most want to see Hearst. There was Walt
Wagner. 25. who said he was a law student
from Sacramento. He carried the autobiog
raphy of psychic llri Celler under one arm
and some instamatic photos snapped at the
"mystery spot" in Santa Cruz in his pocket.
bike any of the 100 or more people who
mill through the lobby during jail visiting
hours, he may wait in line, sign his name,
present some form of identification and re
quest to see an inmate.
He is turned a way after the reserve deputy
at the desk telephones the jail and is told
that Hearst has never heard of the fellow.
Wagner is disappointed, but not discour
aged.
He returns the following week. Again un
able to visit Patty, he corners her father.

Randolph Hearst, in the lobby. Wagner exp
lains that lie wanted to tell Patty ot Uri
Cleller's psychic powers "to help her grow
some more, so she'll have a good defense."
Good intentions
Fortunately, most "kooks" have similar
good intentions. A Los Angeles man who
signs the visitors' roster as "20th Century
Fox" offers Patty a special message "from an
eclectic elitist retrospective."

Grant Kendall. 23, of Berkeley, writes
Fatty a note declaring his intention to keep a
vigil outside the Hall of Justice for her re
lease on hail. He holds up a sign, hand
lettered on flimsy white paper, reading,
"Free Patty Hearst to her home." lie
apologizes to a reporter: "Sorry. I couldn't
think of anything more original than that."
Rut it is a cold Saturday afternoon. The
sun is fickle and rain is expected by even
ing. Twenty minutes later, Kendall is gone.
Routine procedure
The comings and goings have little effect
on the routine jail-visit procedure. Yet, a
woman who came to visit her husband was
somewhat uneasy. "I'd rather be up there (in
the jail) than down here (in the lobby)," she
said. "Upstairs they know who the kooks
are; they're locked up. Down here, you just
have to guess."
