# New York does not merit help

"The spectre of New York
City, whether it defaults or not.
will undoubtedly haunt urban
politicians and voters alike for
some time to come."
This statement is typical of the
unfounded, inane, and mis
guided comments in Stephen
Carter's column (Daily. Oct. 22).
He has fallen under the spell of
those New York politicians arid
investment bankers who are
using scare tactics to con Ameri
cans into believing that the de
mise of their city means vi rtua 1 ly
the collapse of the nation.
Carter contends default will
have two devastating effects.
First. New York will be in tur
moil after city workers stop re
ceiving their paychecks. Riots,
burglary and general chaos, he
asserts, will commence as soon
as police and fire departments
shut down.
The second and more serious
outcome would he the disrup
tion of bond markets everywhere
because, the undermined confi
dence of investors would make it
impossible for cities to borrow.
Both of these contentions are
blown out of proportion.
Allegation denied
The Wall Street Journal, the
most reputable source on this
subject, denies the latter allega
tion which is based on no factual
evidence. According to the
Journal, "the markets are taking
the New York crisis with re
markable calm." This view is
held by most bonds analysts.
John Nuveen and Co. re
marked. "It is refreshing to note
that the market was not totally
mesmerized by New York City's
problem but. in fact reacting to
events within the money mar
ket."
Carter's assertion that "what is
happening to New York City
could happen anywhere" is to
tally erroneous. The magnitude
and causes of its problems are
unique to the city. New York's
budget for the coming fiscal year

is expected to be 12.3 billion dol
lars.
Chicago's budget this year was
only 1.1 billion.
Bond prohibition
Most other large cities are un
likely to default in the near fu
ture because, unlike New York
they are prohibited from issuing
short-term bonds.
The main reason, however,
why these cities have managed
to survive is that they have
looked realistically at their fi
nancial plights and have either
trimmed payrolls and services or
raised taxes.
Meanwhile, New York seemed
to cling to the fairy tale that
money grows on trees.
The result of this attitude has
been appalling. As Time
magazine reports, "It (the
budget) has increased' almost

mindlessly, as if there were a job
for everybody at the taxpayer's
expense."
Spoiled brats
These are the same workers
who demand higher wages,
more fringe benefits and longer
vacations. Are we to support
these spoiled brats by bailing
them out with billions of dol
lars?
The only result will be the
perpetuation of the city's illu
sion that capital is unlimited.
Carter's analogy between
Ford's attitude towards federal
aid and child-beating shows a
total lack of thought on his part.
First of all. Ford did not say
New York didn't deserve aid but.
that it did not deserve federal
aid.
State aid to New York City is
by no stretch of the imagination

analogous to child-beating par
ents providing protection to the
beaten child.
This is absurd.
The state of New York did not
cause the troubles the city is suf
fering. Does Carter believe that if
the city was severed from the
state its problems would be sol
ved?
That is exactly what his
ridiculous analogy implies.
New York's dilemma does not
and never will "haunt" me. Citi
zens such as Carter honestly be
lieving Big Brother should step
in is the only nightmare I know. I
hope the rest of us have the intel
ligence and fortitude not to be
swayed by their ill-informed ar
guments.
