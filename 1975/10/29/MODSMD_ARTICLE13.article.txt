# Abolish theme houses

Nimmer, Rain

Robert Smith's Oct. 20 Daily column proposed
a Jewish theme house. Such an extension of the
present trend towards concentration of ethnic
minorities would be undesirable. His proposal
should not only be rejected, but all existing theme
houses which are based on race should be
abolished.
The Asian-American, black and chicano theme
houses, and Gavilan. the Native American house
(though not technically a theme house) all grant
admission priority on the basis of birth.
Such a policy of discrimination makes the pres
ent system unconscionable. Further, these bouses
perpetuate that segregation which we should be
striving to eliminate. Rather than providing an
opportunity for all students to learn about diverse
cultures, they inhibit contact between persons of
different backgrounds because of their insular na
ture.
Contrast this with the French theme house,
which teaches French culture and language to
interested people regardless of their birth.
Consider our residence. Whitman House. The
total number of Native Americans, chicanos.

Asian Americans and blacks in (his house is three
out of 50. The racial theme houses provide a con
centration of these minorities which deprives
other houses, such as Whitman, of the opportun
ity for contact which integrated living affords.
As it is now, racial theme houses treat people as
members of an ethnic group rather than as indi
viduals.
Granted, there will always be members of
minority groups who will wish to live among
others of their own background. Those who hold
these parochial desires should not be thwarted
from exercising them. But neither should the
University officially sanction this segregation
The recent proposal for a Jewish theme house
thus attempts to strengthen the undesirable trend
toward divisiveness and would deprive more stu
dents of rich and varied dorm lives.
Even more importantly, by giving housing pre
ference to lews, it would result in further official
discrimination on the basis of birth.
