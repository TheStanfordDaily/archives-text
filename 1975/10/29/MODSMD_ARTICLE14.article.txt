Sexual roulette
Editor:
Tho examples which Hill
Evers expects the readers of his
Oct. Daily column to assume
are analogous to the pregnant
mother's dilemma are .ill mis
leading.
They assume that someone is
catapulted suddenly and with
out warning into .1 situation in
which he must accept severe in
convenient e or terminate the life
of another.
How is that analogous tu .t
situation in which both man .uul
woman enter intercourse know
ing that there is sunn* prohahiliU
(zero) of conception?
A tighter analogy is that of ,1
man and a woman choosing to
play partners in the following
game at Las Vegas: Enter a room
ot intants. Approach the atten
dant. who bears .1 straight deck
of playing cards. I'ick .1 card. II it
is a jack, kill one of the babies. II
it is not. leave. The prize is what
ever pleasure the couple gets out
of playing.
This game is called "sexual i 11-
tercourse." and it is not legalh
restricted to the environs of Las
Vegas. My analogy shows how
? completely Kvers has obscured
the key moral issue of abortion.
I The issue is not whether .1
I woman has the right to kill a
fetus.
The issue is whether a couple
has the right to conceive a child
they art; not prepared to nurture.
Plainly no two people have that
right. My conclusion is that one
- has the right to sexual inter
t course if and only i I the probabil
ity of conception is zero, or if tin*
s couple can responsibly raise the
child that might issue.

More on earthquakes
Editor:
1 1 would like to correct some
1 impressions which may have;
r been conveyed by the Daily
' report (Oct. 23) of a recent talk on
earthquakes. In speaking of the
1 desirability of condemnation or
" abandonment of some public
â€¢ buildings. I was referring to
1 those which are located on ac
1 tive faults.
Furthermore, my remarks
about seismic data collection by
high school students pertained
to China, not to the United
States.

What's with Jack?
Editor:
Is Coach Jack Christiansen re
markably pig-headed? Is he such
a coward that he cannot admit
his own mistake? Is he carrying
out a personal vendetta? Is he
trying to sabotage the team? Or is
he just deaf, dumb and blind?
If the problem with Christian
sen is not clear, the answer cer
tainly is. The football team is not
his personal property to ruin; it
belongs to the team members,
students and alumni. Let's take
Jack's toy away before he breaks
it: Sack Jack.

Misplaced priorities
Editor:
Somehow, during the year, the
priorities of the student popula
tion have become badly rear
ranged.
As evidenced by the vehement
protests of the student body, it is
obvious that the recent tuition
hike is paramount in the minds
of the undergraduate populace.
However, this protest is need
less. for the increase will obvi
ously be reflected in the im
provement of undergraduate
education next year. Just like last
year's tuition increase improved
undergraduate education this
year.
Knowing this, we can now
concentrate on something of far
greater importance, the quarter
back situation on the football
team.
Whether Mike Cordova or Cuy
Benjamin starts is obviouslv
more important than if a middle
class family can afford to send
its son or daughter to the Uni
versity.
On the other hand, if a handful
of kids have to overlook Stan
ford because their fathers only
make $16,000 a year, who cares.
Certainly not theadministration.
and witb the quarterback situa
tion to worry about, the student
body cannot waste its time wor
rying about education.
So lets all be there on Saturday
to boo the team on to another
image-improving victory. And
when you go to pay your tuition
next fall, think how much the
University has improved be
cause your father sold your little
sister to white slavers to cover
the increase.
