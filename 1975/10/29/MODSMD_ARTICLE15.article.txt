## True confessions In search of the ultimate rub 
### JACK HALL 
One night I was moaning over
my books; complaints billing
from my lips and pencils shatter
ing in my rip. Suddenly, a
scene which had heen uncon
sciously recorded in mv memory
flashed before mv eyes. It was an
advertisement tor a ina<<s»]ge par
lor, picturing a scantily (dad.
voluptuous cardboariu a ma/.on
that beckons to people as they
driv'e 11un n hi I nuji >. .>■
Seizing upon this as 'ho, per
lei I stink break I sr! (nil to fir'l
out what I could about tile area
parlors. I was momentari Iv
shocked, however, to find no
ready information. Although the
Fscondido Village Center is
conducting a class in the art of
giving massage. I didn't think
this was quite up my alloy.
I finally turned to that old
standby of free enterprise, the
Yellow Cages. As I lot my fingers
do the walking, they seemed to
have a will of their own. inspect
ing the various advertisements.
Cage 272 is entirely devoted to
the trade.
Although I do not consider
mysell as being easi ly swayed by
mere printed sketches depicting
animals in skirts or genies on
magic carpets, some of the ads
did seem to hold a particular at
traction for my wandering fin
gers. Marilyn (ihambers is one of
mv favorite movie stars. When I
noticed one establishment was
named for a hit movie of
Marilyn's. I decided that i! might
east; my misery it I were to un
dergo therapy there.
Referrals?
Being new to the game. I was
not aware of the procedures in
volved. In Calo Alto does one
need a referral as in, say. New
York?
My first call was answered by
an older lady who confirmed
that, yes, they could take can; of
my neck ache. They did list! oils
and special massage techniques.
Slit: said that she was a
licensed operator and appeared
to bo uncomprehending when I
suggested some techniques of
my own. We ended our conver
sation when slit; informed me
that no. they did not have stu
dent rates. I was not impressed.
She didn't sound as it her hands
had any character at all.
The next parlor I tried was
evidently on a coffee break —
lots of chatter in the background.

We had a bad connection and my
tongue wouldn't function, so it
took a whi It! to get down to busi
ness. The lady of the house in
formed mt; that a session would
include something more to mv
liking:
Nude sessions

"Twenty-five
an hour, then if you wanPlo
spend more for more time, you
can."
"What's that include?"
"OK. it's a nude session.
\ ou're both in the nude, you can
massage her or sht! can massage
you . . . or you can just relax. Or
you can take a shower with each
other if you like . . . it's very
nice."
"I'm hum. how about
girls . . . number of girls you
have there?"
"Oh. there'll be about five."
"Do you have a choice?"
"lib huh!"
"I see. Do you have student
rates?"
"I'll. no."
"OK, thanks."
"Bye. then."
Cool heels
The following morning. 1 de
cided that the oil needed chang
ing in tilt! oar, and that while it
was being worked on. 1 would
cool my heels in a local parlor.
Before going. I had to make sev
eral preparations. First, a trip to
the bookstore to cash a check,
then back to the apartment to
change my underwear.
My mother always told me
that if I was in an auto accident
and didn't haveclean underwear
on. that sht; would die of shame.
I figured that the saint; thing
would go for massage parlors.
I had .i small struggle trying to
decide between standard whites,
which are being phased out. and
tbt! blue ones that my sister sent
me for my birthday. I opted for
the blues and headed for the
door.

I finally made it to the place of
my choice. A multitude of signs
directed me upstairs. Through
the window I saw a man dressed
in tbt! style of early insurance
salesman. No ladies were in
sight, so I started to leave. He
didn't motion for me to return,
but something drew mo back to
hi m.
Junior pimp
Filter junior pimp — border
ing between medium short and
very short. Without his cowboy
boots he was probably very
short. His long hair was combed
up and back, secured with a shot
of "Final Mist." His blue eves
wort! dull and lifeless, looking at
nntjfeg in particular.

I asked the gentleman if he
would mind if I hung around
awhile and asked him a few
questions. He wasn't very im
pressed. but seeing as 1 wasn't
connected with a grand jury, he
said lit! didn't mind if I talked to
tilt; girls as soon as they showed
up.
New to the business
"I'm new to the area, and 1
must say we don't have any
businesses like this back home."
"Oh?"
"No. as a matter of fact, if a
go-go girl comes out with a cow
boy hat instead of a halter, she
packs the place in!"
"Really, how interesting."
"Could you tell me. sir, about
how many customers do you
have a day on the average?"
"It depends. During some
days we get as many as 1200 or
1300. Others, maybe only 500.
600."
"No, really? That is
astounding . . . how many girls
do you have here on the aver
ago?"
"Usually four or five, but none
of the have shown up
yet."
"How long are you open?" I
figure that if they have a
thousand customers a day, and
they're open 24 hours a day with

five girls, each customer spends
an average of a little over five
minutes with his hostess.
"What are your rates and time
limits?"
"We're open from 11 a.m. to 3
p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m.
We charge $15 tor 15 minutes."
Hestseller
There was a book on the table
about a hit man in New York.yVs
my host was from the same city. I
gathered that he was reading it.
There was a picture on the cover
of a man holding a pistol equip
ped with a silencer up to another
man's mouth. One of the review
ers on the jacket said something
about what a thrill it was to see a
bullet disappearing into
someone's face and how the au
thor had accurately described
that thrill.
"Do you stay around here to
see that there's no trouble?"
"Yeah. We never have much

the phone between taking bites
of her sandwich and responding
to questions.
"Hello .. . yes. it is. Uh
huh . . . well, I'm a
redhead . . . great! Come on
over. . . anytime . . . 3:30 will
be fine . . . want to tell me your
name? . . . well, come on over
and we'll discuss it."
"Hello .. . yes. it is .. . well,
right now we have two blondes,
a brunette, one redhead and an
oriental that'll knock your eyes
out .. . yeah, she really
will . . . well they're all busy
right now, but come on
over . . . you know how to find
us? . . . great ... I'll be waiting."
Stalling
After another half hour of stal
ling on the telephone, a few of
the ladies started to trickle in.
None of them were any great
shakes, so to speak, but then
none of them seemed particu
larly attracted to me, either.
The first customer of the day
came in, was greeted in a

friendly manner by one of the
ladies and escorted into the back
rooms. He was an average-type
person and reminded me ot a
mailman 1 once knew. In a mi
nute. he had returned and
walked out . . . evidently some
thing didn't suit him.
I continued my conversation
with the first lady, who told me
that she really enjoyed her line of
work because she liked to meet
people. She has clients who are
doctors and lawyers and profes
sors at Stanford. She says that bv
interacting with professional
people she has learned a lot.
Most of her clients wish to do
no more than talk about their
problems and fantasy expecta
tions. She says she never has any
problems with customers, and
has never accidentally run into
any of them on the street.
Yes. it is not uncommon for
some of her customers to be
females, and she savs female
clients are welcome.
Job opportunities
For those women that are in
terested. no experience is neces
sary and you can plan on taking
home all of $150 each week!

"Do you go to school
"Yes. I do. Do you?" jfi
"No. but I have a friend who
was a Dolly there last year.
. Do you know
her?"
"No, I just arrived this year.

Bye now."
"Bye."
The management told me my
wildest desire would bo satisfied
by tlu; hostess it I were a client.
All I have to do is tell her. I
thought, and I thought. I looked

something could be arranged.
There is a definite distinction
between a licensed massage par
lor and an unlicensed one. In a
licensed parlor, you get a mas
sage and maybe teased a little.
The unlicensed ones are techni
cally "nude encounter" estab
lishments. There you get to be
your masseuse's masseuse and
take an expensive shower.
