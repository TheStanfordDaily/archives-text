U'huf ore the signs ol VI)? W'luil
should I do if I lui\r it?
Technically. VI) refers to any
of many diseases which .ire
transmitted by sexual contact,
and it would take too long to dis
cuss them all. Hut the three most
important and common forms
are Herpes Simplex, gonorrhea
and syphilis. Since I answered a
question on Herpes earlier,
here's a quick synopsis on Syph
Xt Clap I.
The symptoms of the first
stage of syphilis are chancres or
painless ulcers on the genitals,
sometimes inside the woman's
vagina. (They would show up
about three weeks after contact).
It not treated the second stage. .1
general body rash, appears
weeks later. This is your last
chance for definitely effective
treatment. One-third of the peo
ple who ignore if at this point
will suffer serious damage of the
brain or other vital organs.
Conorrhea shows up as a burn
ing sensation during urination
*or.i discharge4-(i days after con
tact for about !)() percent of the
infected men. Women may have
a discharge, or often, no warning
at all. If left untreated, all sorts of
nifty complications can appear,
like problems with the prostate.

or scarring of the Fallopian t ibes.
which lead to sterility. Udmen
should get tested at the same
time they have their pelvic ex
amination if there is any possi
bility at all that they have been
infected.

Lost year. <1 guy in my feeshnuin
dorm usked if he could photo
graph me - in the nude. I told
him that I ivus fluttered loud I
rt'tdl\ won tod to do it!!) hut I ivus
ufruitl thot he might do more
than photograph me. Wed/ess
to soy. he is kind of strange?. Ves
tcrduy he asked me again. Hoiv
can I pose for him. and he sure
tluit oil he lakes is pictures?
Who says he's strange? Why
have such a negative attitude?
Maybe he's just an up and com
ing new talent trying to develop
his technique. Maybe headmires
your figure and wants to com
pliment you with the pictures.
Then again, maybe all he wants
is <1 free show. Why don't you
simply tell him your concern
and ask for an assurance that his
mind stay on his camera's
aperture?lf things start cropping
up that you don't like, just put on
your clothes and leave. Hut don't
forget. ,t little free exposure
never hurt anvbodv.
