### WILLIAM ROSS 
Till! Classics Department is healing
its wounds alter three of its assistant
professors were denied tenure last year
in a dei ision bitterly criticized by the
department. a< cording to i l.issics pro
lessors and students.
"We are gradually repairing the
damage." said Prof. Mark Kdwards.
who has reassunied the department
chairmanship alter resigning it last
year to protest the decision ot the Ap
pointments and Promotions (A&P)
Committee to den\ tenure to the three
professors. "We are on our way to liv -
ing it down." he said.
Kdwards said lie became chairman
again only to relieve I'rol. Anthony
Raubitschei k of his part of the heavy
workload
"I'm only holding down the fort
until we can hire a senior faculty
member who can become chairman."
Kdwards said. "It doesn't mean I've
changed mv mind about the
committee's decision."
The department was particularly
bard hit by the loss ot the three assis
tant professors because distinguished
classicist Thomas Webster had re
cently died and I'rof. Lionel Pearson
had recently retired.
Considering applications
Kdwards said the department cur
rently is considering applications
from several leading classii ists to re
place Webster and Pearson
According to Kdwards. the
department's much publicized prob
lems have not discouraged eminent
classicists from seeking to fill the two
senior vacancies on the faculty.
Classicists from .is far a wax as Cam
bridge University in Kngland had ex
pressed amazement at the A&P
Committee's decision.
Kdwards said, however, that noted
classicist C |ohn Harrington ot Yale,
who broke off plans to accept a posi
tion at Stanford when he learned of the
firing of the three professors, has not
reconsidered his decision.
Kdwards said Pearson has emerged
from retirement to teach a i ourse until
the senior faculty members are
selected.
Visiting prof
Edxvards also noted that a visiting
professor. Michael Crant. is helping to
till the two vacant spots Grant, former
chancellor of the I'niversitx of Edin
borough. and author of more than U)
scholarly books, is "a very big man in

tlie classics profession." according to
Kdwards.
Raubitscheck. a world renowned
classicist, is also teaching several
courses each quarter despite his heavy
research workload, according to Kd
wards
"Classicists love to teach." Kdwards
explained.
Hell.i Zweig. a graduate student in
the department, agreed with Kdwards
that morale has improved markedly
since last year's turmoils.
'Move optimistic*
"People seem much more optimis
tii ." she said. "They are more confi
dent about the status of the depart
ment. The horrors of last year have
died down."
Zweig said department members
were particularly pleased last summer
when Assoc. Prof. Gregson Davis was
given tenure.
She noted th.it a hook fix Davis on
Ox id had received much acclaim
among classicists.
"I'm glad that he received tenure,
but I don't see how his case was
stronger than that of (fired Asst. Prof.
Ronald) Mellor." Zweig said.
Shock
Zweig said that a slight feeling of
shock still lingers in the department.
"It's depressing to have three people
shot down right in a row." she said.
"You don't easily forget that sort of
thing."
Kdwards said he considers the three
new assistant professors comparable
in quality to those the I 'diversity fired.
The new faculty members are Asst.
Prof. John Xicols. from Germany's
I'niversitx ot Kreiburg: Acting Asst.
Prof. Carolyn Dexvald. xvho will re
ceive her Ph.D. from Berkeley and Lec
turer Dorothea Krede. who had taught
at the I'niversitx oi Gottingen in Ger
main'.
Kdwards emphasized that he has
"no quarrel" with Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Halsex Rox den about the
firing ot the three professors.
Zweig and Kdwards expressed con
fidence the department's recent prob
lems won't hurt the department's na
tional ratings.
Stanford's Classics Department
ranked fourth in the nation behind
those of Harvard. Yale and Princeton

had recently retired.
Considering applications
Kdwards said the department cur
rently is considering applications
from several leading classii ists to re
place Webster and Pearson
According to Kdwards. the
department's much publicized prob
lems have not discouraged eminent
classicists from seeking to fill the two
senior vacancies on the faculty.
Classicists from .is far a wax as Cam
bridge University in Kngland had ex
pressed amazement at the A&P
Committee's decision.
Kdwards said, however, that noted
classicist C |ohn Harrington ot Yale,
who broke off plans to accept a posi
tion at Stanford when he learned of the
firing of the three professors, has not
reconsidered his decision.
Kdwards said Pearson has emerged
from retirement to teach a i ourse until
the senior faculty members are
selected.
Visiting prof
Edxvards also noted that a visiting
professor. Michael Crant. is helping to
till the two vacant spots Grant, former
chancellor of the I'niversitx of Edin
borough. and author of more than U)
scholarly books, is "a very big man in

tlie classics profession." according to
Kdwards.
Raubitscheck. a world renowned
classicist, is also teaching several
courses each quarter despite his heavy
research workload, according to Kd
wards
"Classicists love to teach." Kdwards
explained.
Hell.i Zweig. a graduate student in
the department, agreed with Kdwards
that morale has improved markedly
since last year's turmoils.
'Move optimistic*
"People seem much more optimis
tii ." she said. "They are more confi
dent about the status of the depart
ment. The horrors of last year have
died down."
Zweig said department members
were particularly pleased last summer
when Assoc. Prof. Gregson Davis was
given tenure.
She noted th.it a hook fix Davis on
Ox id had received much acclaim
among classicists.
"I'm glad that he received tenure,
but I don't see how his case was
stronger than that of (fired Asst. Prof.
Ronald) Mellor." Zweig said.
Shock
Zweig said that a slight feeling of
shock still lingers in the department.
"It's depressing to have three people
shot down right in a row." she said.
"You don't easily forget that sort of
thing."
Kdwards said he considers the three
new assistant professors comparable
in quality to those the I 'diversity fired.
The new faculty members are Asst.
Prof. John Xicols. from Germany's

chancellor of the I'niversitx of Edin
borough. and author of more than U)
scholarly books, is "a very big man in

tlie classics profession." according to
Kdwards.
Raubitscheck. a world renowned
classicist, is also teaching several
courses each quarter despite his heavy
research workload, according to Kd
wards
"Classicists love to teach." Kdwards
explained.
Hell.i Zweig. a graduate student in
the department, agreed with Kdwards
that morale has improved markedly
since last year's turmoils.
'Move optimistic*
"People seem much more optimis
tii ." she said. "They are more confi
dent about the status of the depart
ment. The horrors of last year have
died down."
Zweig said department members
were particularly pleased last summer
when Assoc. Prof. Gregson Davis was
given tenure.
She noted th.it a hook fix Davis on
Ox id had received much acclaim
among classicists.
"I'm glad that he received tenure,
but I don't see how his case was
stronger than that of (fired Asst. Prof.
Ronald) Mellor." Zweig said.
Shock
Zweig said that a slight feeling of
shock still lingers in the department.
"It's depressing to have three people
shot down right in a row." she said.
"You don't easily forget that sort of
thing."
Kdwards said he considers the three
new assistant professors comparable
in quality to those the I 'diversity fired.
The new faculty members are Asst.

I'niversitx ot Kreiburg: Acting Asst.
Prof. Carolyn Dexvald. xvho will re
ceive her Ph.D. from Berkeley and Lec

Kdwards emphasized that he has
"no quarrel" with Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Halsex Rox den about the
firing ot the three professors.
Zweig and Kdwards expressed con
fidence the department's recent prob
lems won't hurt the department's na
tional ratings.
