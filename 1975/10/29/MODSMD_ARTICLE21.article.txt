"Mike Cordova will shirt (this
weekend's) Head
Football Coach Jack Christian
sen told the Northern California
Football Writers yesterday.
Christiansen ended specula
tion that Cuv Benjamin would
' take over the starting quarter
back spot after his performance
! last weekend against Washing-
I ton State.
i II Cordova doesn't execute
well against Oregon State, said
Christiansen. "I'll be quicker to
change than I have been in the
past.
"I'm just going to start the first
quarterback and leave him in
until I think we're ready for a
change.".Chris added.
Christiansen said earlierin tht!
week that. "If Cuy Benjamin
continues to do as good a job this
week as he has in the past, he
would be the starter the next
week against IJSC."
Concerning Cordova's alleged
shoulder injury. Christiansen
explained that. "Ballplayers at
every position want to play, and
they just don't want to tell you if
they're hurting.
"My opinion is that the way
Mike threw some of those balls
(against WSIJ). I have to assume
something must be wrong.
"He says his arm felt fine, but
he tells you that all of the time."
Christiansen said. "He's that

kind of a competitor."
Christiansen also denied
speculation concerning Cuy
Benjamin. "Some people are
saying that I put (Benjamin) in
hoping th.it he'd perform
badly." Chris said. "That's just
not true. I'd like to see every
player come in and do well."
"When I told him to go in."
Chris elaborated, "there were
seven minutes left in the half. 1
didn't plan for (WSlJ) to hold the
ball for four minutes, or for them
to give it back to us on our own
(i-yard line.''
According to Christiansen.
Oregon St. is better than its win
less (0-7) record would indicate.
"(OSU) is a team that scares you.
It scares me on film. They're big.
they've got an all-pro caliber
linebacker and they've got a
strong defensive line." he said.
"They've had some problems
moving the bail. They've fum
bled the ball in some close situa
tions. but they're tough." he
added.
Cardinal Notes: Mike Michel
is still doubtful for the game due
to his pulled
hamstring . . . Offensive tackle
Carv Anderson dislocated his
toe and is listed as
'questionable' . . . Freshman
cornerback Larry Reynolds will
be playing across the street from
his Corvallis home.

Football Coach Jack Christian
sen told the Northern California
Football Writers yesterday.
Christiansen ended specula
tion that Cuv Benjamin would
' take over the starting quarter
back spot after his performance
! last weekend against Washing-
I ton State.
i II Cordova doesn't execute
well against Oregon State, said
Christiansen. "I'll be quicker to

past.

quarterback and leave him in
until I think we're ready for a

Christiansen said earlierin tht!
week that. "If Cuy Benjamin
continues to do as good a job this
week as he has in the past, he
would be the starter the next
week against IJSC."
Concerning Cordova's alleged
shoulder injury. Christiansen
explained that. "Ballplayers at
every position want to play, and
they just don't want to tell you if
they're hurting.
"My opinion is that the way
Mike threw some of those balls
(against WSIJ). I have to assume
something must be wrong.
"He says his arm felt fine, but
he tells you that all of the time."
Christiansen said. "He's that

kind of a competitor."
Christiansen also denied
speculation concerning Cuy
Benjamin. "Some people are
saying that I put (Benjamin) in
hoping th.it he'd perform
badly." Chris said. "That's just
not true. I'd like to see every
player come in and do well."
"When I told him to go in."
Chris elaborated, "there were
seven minutes left in the half. 1
didn't plan for (WSlJ) to hold the
ball for four minutes, or for them
to give it back to us on our own
(i-yard line.''
According to Christiansen.
Oregon St. is better than its win
less (0-7) record would indicate.
"(OSU) is a team that scares you.
It scares me on film. They're big.
they've got an all-pro caliber
linebacker and they've got a
strong defensive line." he said.
"They've had some problems
moving the bail. They've fum
bled the ball in some close situa
tions. but they're tough." he
added.
Cardinal Notes: Mike Michel
is still doubtful for the game due
to his pulled
hamstring . . . Offensive tackle
Carv Anderson dislocated his
toe and is listed as
'questionable' . . . Freshman
cornerback Larry Reynolds will
be playing across the street from
his Corvallis home.
