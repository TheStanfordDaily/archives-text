Religious battles flare in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslem and Christian gunmen
battled outside Lebanon's Parliament yesterday as con
voys of Americans and other foreigners sped to the airport
for flights out of this strife-torn capital.
Marine guards at the U.S. Embassy changed from dress
blues to combat fatigues and flak jackets when stray
rounds from a nearby combat zone began hitting the build
ing. Rocket-propelled grenades and machine gun bursts
slammed into three of Beirut's most expensive hotels.
Nonstop fighting made it impossible to accurately
count casualties, but officials estimated that 23 died dur
ing the early part of the night and 120 on Monday.
Premier Rashid Karami announced another cease-fire
bid to end the war between Christian militiamen and
Palestinian-led Moslems. He said a nine-man "security
group" would meet in his office until it comes up with
"effective measures to end onceand forall the tragedy that
fias been gripping Lebanon." The group represents leftist,
rightist and religious groups involved in the fighting.
GM sales rise 20 percent
DETROIT — General Motors Corp. said yesterday its
third-quarter earnings increased nearly 14 times from last
year's anemic levels to $243 million ,'.nd its sales were up
20 percent for the period.
Meanwhile, Chrysler Corp. reported a three percent
boost in sales but a record $79-million loss in earnings for
the period.
Ford Motor Co. will release its third-quarter financial
results Thursday and financial analysts predict the firm
will show a drop in profits from the year-ago period.
The firms' earnings were released as industry analysts
estimated U.S. car production next month would be down
from last year's depressed levels to the lowest output for a
nonstrike November since 1960.
Despite recent improvements in car sales, analysts said
the auto makers are maintaining a cautious November
production schedule. That suggests company internal
planners are less optimistic about the strength of the
new-car market than their public spokesmen, who have
predicted dramatic sales gains for fall and winter.
Analysts say the firms plan to build about 000.000 cars
in November, down 2.5 percent from 615,000 last year. It
would be the lowest output for a November in 15 years,
with the exception of 1970, when production was depre
ssed by a national CM strike.
Busing 'hampers' integration?
WASHINCTON — A leading sociologist joined Ken
tucky political leaders yesterday in calling for an end to
compulsory busing as a means of achieving school deseg
regation.
Sociologist James S. Coleman of the University of
Chicago, an early backer of cross-busing of school chil
dren. told the Senate Judiciary Committee he now believes
that busing has hampered more than helped the cause of
school integration.
Claiming busing raises "a spectre of a country of black
cities and white suburbs." Coleman said he supports a
moratorium on all busing and the creation of a presiden
tial commission to study the impact of busing across the
nation.
Hut Coleman disagreed with Kentucky Gov. Julian Nl.
Carroll and Kentucky senators and congressmen who
urged that the Constitution be amended to bar court
ordered busing plans like those now in effect in Louisville
and Boston.
The Judiciary Committee is holding hearings on four
proposed constitutional amendments that would prohibit
busing of students beyond the nearest school.
Moore, Fromme plead innocent
SAN FRANCISCO — Over strong defense objections, a
federal judge entered an innocent plea yesterday for Sara
Jane Moore on charges she tried to kill President Ford and
ordered her trial to start Dec. 15.
Meanwhile, another woman accused of trying to kill

Ford. Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, was to appear in fed
eral court in Sacramento. She has pleaded innocent to
charges of trying to shoot Ford Sept. 5 near the California
State Capitol.
The hearing concerns arguments on U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Macbride's order that Ford give video
taped testimony as a defense witness at Fromme's trial.
In San Francisco. Chief Public Defender James Hewitt,
in a 15-minute arraignment marked by a sharp exchange
with the judge, repeatedly insisted no plea be entered
until psychiatric tests are completed to determine
whether Moore is competent to stand trial.
U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Conti. citing require
ments of the 1974 Speedy Trial Act. swept aside all objec
tions. He said the trial would begin as scheduled unless
she were found mentally incompetent.
Conti later agreed to Hewitt's request that Moore. 45. be
allowed to attend a closed juvenile court custody hearing
in San Francisco Thursday concerning her 10-year-old
son. Frederick Aalberg. He is currently living in a foster
horn in the Bay area with a friend of his mother's.

ingly yesterday not to admit boys to their organization.
