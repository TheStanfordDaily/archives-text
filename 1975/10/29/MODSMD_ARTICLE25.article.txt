Canfield Court
The area separating Meyer Under

tate of Chalres A. Canfield (1848-101!))

CORRECTION
A caption in yesterday's Daily
incorrectly stated that the Quad was
"in the red a year ago." The Quad that
year did not run at a deficit, as stated in
the story. Also, Editor Jeff Cerecke's
statements regarding "poor financial
management" were directed only at
the years 1960-71.
