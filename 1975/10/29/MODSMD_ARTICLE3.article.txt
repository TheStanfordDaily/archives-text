# Ex-agent Marchetti:
## CIA maintains 'warped view' 
### LAURA KENNEDY 
The Central Intelligence Agency
((' IA) is ,i "secret fraternity of the
American power aristocracy." accord
ing to Victor Marchetti. a CIA officer
who resigned in 10(>0 after 14 years of
service.
Marchetti told about 500 people in
Memorial Auditorium last night that
the (IIA "strikes at the core of our con
stitutional system." The C-1A had de
leted U0 sections ol his book. The CIA
and the Cult of Intelligence, which he
wrote with John Marks. Court battles
restored over half the deletions, sev
er,d of which had previously been
made public.
In his speech. Marchetti declared
that "the real CIA is the clandestine
service (whosepurpose is) the penetra

lion and manipulation ol events in
other countries."
He termed the "dichotomy" bet
ween the intelligence gathering sec
tion and the clandestine section of the
CIA "a source of internal and external
problems." Marchetti cited Cuba, Vie
tnam and Chile as examples of coun
tries where the intelligence section
had recommended against going in.
but the director had sided with the
larger clandestine section.
'Clandestine mentality'
Marchetti claimed the CIA was af
flicted with a "(landestine mentality."
a "warped view of the world" so secre
tive that sometimes the director him

on.
This mentality extended to tin; Ken
nedy assassination, in Marchetti's
view. He said. "Somebody's hiding
something and I don't know why." He
recommended reopening the case.
However, in a Daily interview. Mar
chetti said he did not think the "CIA as
an institution was responsible for the
assassination." Nevertheless, he said
there were "a few bitter
people . . . who had been in the Bay of
Figs " Marchetti said.
In his speech. Marchetti called gov
ernment intelligence agencies a "big,
fat and wasteful community." He

pointed out that that intelligence or
ganizations spent $()-B billion per year,
employed 150-200 thousand people
and included such diverse agencies as
the Internal Revenue Service and the
Smithsonian Institution.
Little control
Marchetti indicated he thought
Congress had little control over this
large intelligence community and the
CIA in particular. "Generally the
White House knows what (the CIA) is
doing, but Congress certainly
doesn't." he said.
Marchetti termed the Congressional
investigative committees "a great

breakthrough." He sarcastically cre
dited Ford with promoting the inves
tigations by placing "flaming liberals"
like Ronald Reagan on the Rockefeller
Commission, and "arming them all
with a bucket of whitewash."
In the Daily interview. Marchetti re
commended that Congress increase
the staff of CIA oversight committees.
Without a constant flow of informa
tion. Marchetti said there is "no way
they (Congress) have a check now."
He suggested the 1976 elections as a

deadline for reform of the intelligence
system. He particularly urged the au
dience to oppose Senate Bill 1. calling
it a "Soviet national secrets law." The
bill would, among other things, fine a
citizen up to $100,000 or even im
prison him for life for leaking clas
sified information.
Don't eliminate
Marchetti said during the interview,
he diil not advocate "reforming" the
CIA by eliminating it. He instead
wanted the CIA to return to its original
purpose of collecting, coordinating

and analyzing information.
He termed the argument that some
information could only be gathered
clandestinely a "myth." "We don't
learn what's going on around the
world through the CIA. but through
technical collection systems." Mar
chetti said.
He also described two other
"myths" of intelligence: that spies are
needed to determine the intentions of
toreign operatives, and that counterin
telligence. such as the ClA's mail
opening operation, is valuable.
