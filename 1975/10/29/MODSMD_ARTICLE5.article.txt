# Econ profs state views on urban ills

Speculating on what's in store for
New York City, economics professors
here see little chance of a quick solu
tion to the city's financial woes.
New York City has already had to
seek state and business aid to meet its
debts and another $4 billion must be
raised by next June to pay bills and
loans due then, Time magazine re
ported in its Oct. 20 issue
"Default is imminent." Asst. Prof.
Michael Boskin said. "In the short run,
something has to be done to allow New
York to borrow. But I doubt the struc
tural causes of New York's problems
can be remedied in the short run."
Boskin pointed to ".in enormous in
crease in welfare expenditures and in
creased fringe benefits in labor con
tracts that are only now coming due"
as primary causes of New York's dif
ficulties.
'Real indicators'
Asst. Prof. Karen Johnson said,
"Originally. I thought steps were
clearly being taken by the city just to
alarm other people. But lately one gets
the impression the federal government
won't respond to real indicators of
trouble."
"The odds of federal aid to New
York areabout 50-50." Boskin said. "A
bill just to consider giving aid to New
York barely squeaked through the
congressional committee." he noted.
Prof. Richard Muth said default
would "primarily affect holders of
New York bonds. But I'd also project
cutbacks in the number of firemen and
other municipal employes."
In the event of default. Boskin exp
lained. "Legally the bondholders have
first lien on any money left. But in my
opinion, any judge who would try to
do that would be run out of town."
'Massive reorganization'
Asst. Prof. David Starrett said he ex
pects "a massive reorganization" if
New York defaults. "The city could
never borrow again, without substan
tial federal guarantees. And the federal
government wouldn't do that, without
taking a say in how New York is run."

A New York default would be un
likely to drag down other cities, the
professors asserted. "I suspect it
would make borrowing difficult in
other cities, but I don't think it would
bring doom." Johnson said.
"What people forget." she added,
"is that if the city defaults, that doesn't
mean 100 percent of the bond value is
wiped out. Although there will be a
delay, it's likely most or all of the bond
value will eventually be paid."
CINP jump
The United States is coming out of a
recession, the economists also said,
pointing toa recently announced jump
in the Cross National Product (CNP).
The Commerce Department an
nounced on Oct. 20 that the CNP rose
in the three months ending in Sep
tember by an annual rate of 11.2 per
cent, the biggest increase since 1955.
"It's pretty obvious we're out of the
downswing," Muth said. "On the
other hand, we still have high unemp
loyment. Typically. (a drop in) unemp
loyment lags behind a recovery in out
put, as the first tendency is for emp
loyed workers to work longer."
Boskin noted, "There's a modest re
covery. but it's unlikely to be spectacu
lar. The CNP jump overstates things;
much of it just represents a buildup in
inventories."
Ford's policy
President Ford's economic policy,
stressing tax cuts, "helped somewhat
in bringing about the recovery." Bos
kin said. But Starrett said, "I would
have favored — and I still favor — big
ger tax rebates."
Modern economic theory asserts
that there is a tradeoff between a drop
in unemployment and inflation,
known as the Phillips relationship.
However, Johnson predicted.
"Inflation's not going to rise im
mediately. There's no great pressure

on aggregate demand."
"I've never been much of a believer
in the Phillips relationship." Bos kin
said. "I'd expect inflation to continue,
perhaps moderating to about six per
cent."
Starrett cautioned. "There's a fine
line to be drawn between keeping the
recovery going and fueling inflation."
But he said Federal Reserve Board
policies will provide the kev to how
rapid inflation will be.
