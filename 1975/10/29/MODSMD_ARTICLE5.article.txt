Speculating on what's in store for
New York City, economics professors
here see little chance of a quick solu
tion to the city's financial woes.
New York City has already had to
seek state and business aid to meet its
debts and another $4 billion must be
raised by next June to pay bills and
loans due then, Time magazine re
ported in its Oct. 20 issue
"Default is imminent." Asst. Prof.
Michael Boskin said. "In the short run,
something has to be done to allow New
York to borrow. But I doubt the struc
tural causes of New York's problems
can be remedied in the short run."
Boskin pointed to ".in enormous in
crease in welfare expenditures and in
creased fringe benefits in labor con
tracts that are only now coming due"
as primary causes of New York's dif
ficulties.
'Real indicators'
Asst. Prof. Karen Johnson said,
"Originally. I thought steps were
clearly being taken by the city just to
alarm other people. But lately one gets
the impression the federal government
won't respond to real indicators of
trouble."
"The odds of federal aid to New
York areabout 50-50." Boskin said. "A
bill just to consider giving aid to New
York barely squeaked through the
congressional committee." he noted.
