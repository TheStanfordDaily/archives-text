# SFE lobbies for minority goals
## 
### BERT BOWER 
Partially in response to Martin Luther King's as
sassination in 1068. the University first granted
special finam ial aid to blacks and chicanos. lead
ing to an increase in minority enrollment. There are
approximately 10(10 minority students enrolled
today.
Along with the rising tide of minority enrollment
came an onslaught of questions. Should I niversity
policy he to integrate the new students? How
should special aid be extended to minorities? How
should minorities be recruited?
Students for Equity (SFE). a group formed last
January to bring together the various campus
minorities, has dealt energetically and at times con
troversially with Mich questions.
The University's policy on minorities "is to con
trol us by splitting us up into different factions."
according to |osie Jaramillo. a member ot SFE and
an ASSU vice president. She explained. "We
(minority groups) decided that together we could
accomplish something."
Last year the University increased self-help re
quirements ot minority students on financial aid.
thus setting otf a wave of protest throughout the
minority community It culminated in the forma
tion ot SFE. which brings together the chicano.
Native American, black and Asian communities on
campus.
SFE represents minorities
SFE is essentially a group that can represent
minority students on financial aid and minority

entrance decisions." according to SFE member
Bruce Chan. He cautioned, however, that "SFE
can't just react to policy but must be a continual
source of student input."
SFE was ardent in opposition to last year's minor
ity aid shifts. "The previous aid package was much
more favorable to minorities," stated Jaramillo.
"Before, a minority freshman didn't have to work
the first year, whereas now he or she does. In addi
tion. the University wants to decrease the amount
of loans to minorities while increasing the self-help
requirement." she added.
Last year. SFE organized two demonstrations
protesting thechanges and met with theCommittee
on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA) to vocalize its discontent SFF claimed
the new policy would reduce minority admissions.
Hargadon disagrees
Uean ot Admissions Fred Hargadon disagreed
with SFE's stance against the new financial aid
package. He commented at the last Far ultv Senate
meeting.'The yield (ot minority students) is bound
to var\ from year to year. Students make their
choice based on the school they would most like to
attend, even if there are sacrifices involved."
SFE is urging the formation of a monitoring
committee to oversee the effects of the new policy.
"We see this as possibly being a sub-group of
CUAFA." explained Ricardo Reyna. another SFE
member.
SFE perceives its major role as working for the
continuation of a substantial minority community

at Stanford. Its reason for this is twofold.
first. SI'L members say minorities should have
access to Stanford in order to learn the tools and
skills necessary to gain greater equality.
'Third World people'
Second, according to Reyna, "It's good to expose
(other) Stanford students to Third World people,
because in the future Stanford graduates will be the
decision makers in power. II they can be influenced
by Third World people, they will take this into
consideration when making decisions."
SFE members, however, do not promote total in
tegration into the university system. "We feel the
University wants to assimilate minorities but we
think the stress should be on cultural pluralism,"
said Jaramillo. She declared the University's goals
"should not beto makea chicanoa successful white
student but should be to give the student the means
to help his or her community."
Responding to Jaramillo, Dean of Student Affairs
lames Lyons said. "Pluralism requires that various
sub-cultures within the University be able to in
teract with, to talk with one another. I don't think
that's assimilation. That's just basic communica
tion."
Lyons said he fears that SFE's desires to see
graduating minority students return totheir respec
tive c ommunities could lead to "political or social
tests" for admissions, in order to determine which
minority applicants would be willing to make such
a return.
Among its plans to push campus
minorities causes. SFE is considering
the possibility of establishing its own
recruitment program to visit high
schools.
"Since Stanford doesn't recruit at
many high schools with large minority
enrollments, we feel there is a need for
another recruitment program," stated
SFE member Susan Tomita.
She said, however, that perspective
minority students shouldn't have
"Stanford pushed on them" until they
are aware of some of the problems
minorities face at Stanford. She
claimed that many students from
Asian-American communities feel
alienated on campus.
Asian-American members of SFE
are fighting to be recognized by the
University as an official minority
group so they will be entitled to spe
cial programs and aid. Currently Har
gadon "refuses to recognize Asians as
a minority when giving us financial
aid but counts us in the 17 percent total
minority figure he uses for PR," said
Tomita.
Although he considers SFE a prog
ressive organization, Mike Kies
chnick, a member of the largely-white
Alliance for Radical Change (ARC),
feels "SFE could be strengthened by a
more radical analysis." He believes
SFE is cautious about radical issues
because "there has been a history of
white radicals co-opting minorities."
SFE's influence seems to lie in the
simple idea that a collective group of
minorities will make its voice heard
louder than any one minority alone
could hope to. As Jaramillo put it. "We
won't just shut up and go along â€” if we
don't protest, no one else is going to do
it for us."
