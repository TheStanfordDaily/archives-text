Crade point inflation and increasing competition to
enter graduate and professional schools have led many
critics in recent weeks to attack the University's Honor
Code for administering examinations.
The pressure to achieve, some contend, encourages
cheating — cheating which, they maintain, students
cannot be reasonably expected to detect. Some have
gone so far as to call for a return to a system of proctor
ing.
Hut while a serious review of the I lonor Code, as had
been proposed by Ombudsman John Coheen, will un
doubtedly prove valuable, we generally like the Honor
Code as it is.
According to official University publications, the
I lonor Code establishes a sort of contract between stu
dents and instructors. The instructors agree not to
police the students; students, in turn, agree not to cheat
on exams. Students further agree to report violations of
the code which they observe.
Many of the critics who complain that the code leads
to cheating may fail to realize that by failing to report
students who do cheat, they. too. violate the Honor
Code. Hut there, as in everything else, each student can
decide for himself or herself whether to report viola
tions.
Such an arrangement is a vital facet of the Stanford
atmosphere, the relaxed, honest and straightforward
climate which the University likes to project.
The University exists largely to train future leaders.
How can we successfully-enter "the real world" after
years of having others stare over our shoulders, doubt
ing our honesty at every turn?
This was much of the original rationale for introduc
ing the Honor Code. The same criteria remain valid
today.
