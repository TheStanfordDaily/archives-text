I have come to expect certain
distortions of reality from Hill
Evers. but I have in the past
found his column to he.it least
fairly accurate in a methodologi
cal sense.
I am quite willing to forgive?
his opinions when they con
tradict mine, as long as they are
presented in <i manner that does
not offend my sense of logic.
Ironically, his column 011
abortion (Daily. Oct. 2.t)does not
disagree with my own views on
the subject. However, while we
an? in agreement on the funda
mental issue of whether or not a
woman has a right to exercise
control over her own body. I tear
that the shoddiness of Evers'
analogy is only too apparent and
must be pointed out.
Faulty analogy
My case is this: Evers presents
the analogy of a kidnap victim
finding himself involuntarily
"plugged in" to a famous vio
linist to allow the \ ictim's kid
neys to filter the violinist's con
taminated blood.
Evers rightly asserts that the
victim should feel no compunc
tion to remain "plugged in" for
the specified nine month period.
Yet the krv to his inconsistency
ot argument is the word "in
voluntary" (my choice, not
Evers').

Had the kidnap victim instead
originally volunteered freely to
save tbt; life of the violinist and
then decided to pull out of the
project, the issue becomes less
simplistic, and the moral im
peratives harder to discern.
Sex agreement
In the actual case of pregnancy
|l exclude the possibility of im
pregnation bv rape), the woman
has consented to the possibility
of pregnancy in agreeing to sex
ual involvement.
She is accountable at least to
herself for the consequences of
heraction. Shecannot claim that
she "found herself" with
another "life" (debatable point)
dependent on her without her
consent.
I ler reaction to this position of
another's dependency is then up
to her own conscience.
Within reasonable (and admit
tedly difficult to establish) time
limits, a woman has the right to
control her body processes.
My objection to the Evers arti
cle then. is somewhat legalistic
in nature. I am disturbed at the
sloppiness of his example.
As much as I generally disag
ree with him. I expect more pre
cision in his opinions.

I have come to expect certain
distortions of reality from Hill
Evers. but I have in the past
found his column to he.it least
fairly accurate in a methodologi
cal sense.
I am quite willing to forgive?
his opinions when they con
tradict mine, as long as they are
presented in <i manner that does
not offend my sense of logic.
Ironically, his column 011
abortion (Daily. Oct. 2.t)does not
disagree with my own views on
the subject. However, while we
an? in agreement on the funda
mental issue of whether or not a
woman has a right to exercise
control over her own body. I tear
that the shoddiness of Evers'
analogy is only too apparent and
must be pointed out.
Faulty analogy
My case is this: Evers presents
the analogy of a kidnap victim
finding himself involuntarily
"plugged in" to a famous vio
linist to allow the \ ictim's kid
neys to filter the violinist's con
taminated blood.
Evers rightly asserts that the
victim should feel no compunc
tion to remain "plugged in" for
the specified nine month period.
Yet the krv to his inconsistency
ot argument is the word "in
voluntary" (my choice, not
Evers').

Had the kidnap victim instead
originally volunteered freely to
save tbt; life of the violinist and
then decided to pull out of the
project, the issue becomes less
simplistic, and the moral im
peratives harder to discern.
Sex agreement
In the actual case of pregnancy
|l exclude the possibility of im
pregnation bv rape), the woman
has consented to the possibility
of pregnancy in agreeing to sex
ual involvement.
She is accountable at least to
herself for the consequences of
heraction. Shecannot claim that
she "found herself" with
another "life" (debatable point)
dependent on her without her
consent.
I ler reaction to this position of
another's dependency is then up
to her own conscience.
Within reasonable (and admit
tedly difficult to establish) time
limits, a woman has the right to
control her body processes.
