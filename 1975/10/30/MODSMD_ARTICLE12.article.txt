# 'Lisztomania' falls flat
## 
### 
reviewed by Ann Hoffman
Film Director Ken Russell has
a self-admitted music fetish. His
latest film, a musical, sexual
orgy of the imagination based
ever so slightly on the life of
Hungarian composer P'ranz
Liszt, represents the second in a
series of six films he will make
on famous composers.
Russell says, "Music for me is
the most incredible event in the
history of the human race," then
confesses, "Perhaps if 1 could
write great music, then I
wouldn't have started making
films." It is hard to imagine, after
Lisztomania, that his music
could be any worse.
Lisztomania vaguely purports
to deal with Liszt's numerous
love affairs and his relationship
with composer Richard Wagner.
Roger Daltrey of The Who, star of
Russell's last film Tommy, is the
fantasy-ridden Liszt, and Paul
Nicholson, who appeared as the
perverted Cousin Kevin in
Tommy, plays Wagner. The two
musicians are conceived as
19th-century pop stars, Liszt as a
glittery exhibitionist and
Wagner as a revolutionary
superstar.
Once Russell makes his paral
lels between Liszt, Wagner and
pop stardom, the film is no more
than a series of private and con
sequently meaningless fantasies
which seem to have been still
born in Russell's imagination.
Outrageous fantasia
The many sexual fantasies in
the film are perhaps too out
rageous to offend; they are so
much a part of Russell's inner
imagination that they become
mere prolonged autoerotica.

Throughout Liszt's fantasies
women appear as vampires who
physically threaten to drain his
music from him. While they
throw themselves at him, Liszt
periodically announces with
grave innocence that all he
wants from life is to write good
music. Rut Daltrey is not able to
convince us that he really wants
anything. He is simply Russell's
disjointed puppet.
Though Russell professes to
be greatly affected by Liszt's
music, its presence in the film
seems purely incidental.
Russell has borrowed a great
deal from the style and techni
que of Stanley Kubrick's A
C/ockvvork Orange. However,
Lisztomania lacks that fragile
link with reality that sustains in
terest in Clockwork Orange.
Though much of Kubrick's film
is imaginary free-for-all, we are
always aware of the society
which he attacks.
Audience attacked
In Lisztomania, the attack is
focused, for lack of a better ob
ject, on the sensibilities of the
audience. When Wagner rises up
in the spirit of a Nazi Frankens
tein at the film's conclusion,
what might have been plausible
suggestion becomes so outrage
ous that one is forced to dismiss
it altogether.
When Russell is not attempt
ing to create a phallic maypole
extravaganza or a Wagnerian
Frankenstein, he can be quite
funny on a smaller scale. In the
first scene, we find Liszt giving
Countess Marie d'Agoult her
music lesson in time to a met
ronone — in bed.
One of Liszt's love fantasies, a

parody of Chaplin's The Gold
Rush, is brilliant in itself, but un
fortunately, none of the scenes
ever interconnect.
Ringo Starr appears briefly as
the Pope, wearing cowboy boots.
Russell's heavy-handed direc
tion seems to have stultified that
spontaneity which is Starr's
screen appeal. Like most of the
film's characters, Starr has no
identity, but exists solely to get
Daltrey from one scene to
another.
Musical exorcism
Near the film's conclusion, the
Rope sends Liszt on a mission to
exorcize the devil from Richard
Wagner who is busily preparing,
50 years in advance, for Nazism.
Wagner dies at the mercy of Liszt
and a fireshooting piano. Liszt
eventually ascends to heaven
where he plays beautiful music
with an orchestra of his former
mistresses on a phallic pedestal
in the sky.
At one point, Liszt responds to
a criticism of his music by stat
ing emphatically that, "Time
kills critics." In the case of
Lisztomania, it may kill
bad art as well.

grave innocence that all he
wants from life is to write good
music. Rut Daltrey is not able to
convince us that he really wants
anything. He is simply Russell's
disjointed puppet.
Though Russell professes to
be greatly affected by Liszt's
music, its presence in the film
seems purely incidental.
Russell has borrowed a great
deal from the style and techni
que of Stanley Kubrick's A
C/ockvvork Orange. However,
Lisztomania lacks that fragile
link with reality that sustains in
terest in Clockwork Orange.
Though much of Kubrick's film
is imaginary free-for-all, we are
always aware of the society
which he attacks.
Audience attacked
In Lisztomania, the attack is
focused, for lack of a better ob
ject, on the sensibilities of the
audience. When Wagner rises up
in the spirit of a Nazi Frankens
tein at the film's conclusion,
what might have been plausible
suggestion becomes so outrage
ous that one is forced to dismiss
it altogether.
When Russell is not attempt
ing to create a phallic maypole
extravaganza or a Wagnerian
Frankenstein, he can be quite
funny on a smaller scale. In the
first scene, we find Liszt giving
Countess Marie d'Agoult her
music lesson in time to a met
ronone — in bed.
One of Liszt's love fantasies, a

parody of Chaplin's The Gold
Rush, is brilliant in itself, but un
fortunately, none of the scenes
ever interconnect.
Ringo Starr appears briefly as
the Pope, wearing cowboy boots.
Russell's heavy-handed direc
tion seems to have stultified that
spontaneity which is Starr's
screen appeal. Like most of the
film's characters, Starr has no
identity, but exists solely to get
Daltrey from one scene to
another.
Musical exorcism
Near the film's conclusion, the
Rope sends Liszt on a mission to
exorcize the devil from Richard
Wagner who is busily preparing,
50 years in advance, for Nazism.
Wagner dies at the mercy of Liszt
and a fireshooting piano. Liszt
eventually ascends to heaven
where he plays beautiful music
with an orchestra of his former
mistresses on a phallic pedestal
in the sky.
At one point, Liszt responds to
a criticism of his music by stat
ing emphatically that, "Time
kills critics." In the case of
Lisztomania, it may kill
bad art as well.

Roger Daltrey plays Liszt in 'Lisztomania'
reviewed by Ann Hoffman
Film Director Ken Russell has
a self-admitted music fetish. His
latest film, a musical, sexual
orgy of the imagination based
ever so slightly on the life of
Hungarian composer P'ranz
Liszt, represents the second in a
series of six films he will make
on famous composers.
Russell says, "Music for me is
the most incredible event in the
history of the human race," then
confesses, "Perhaps if 1 could
write great music, then I
wouldn't have started making
films." It is hard to imagine, after
Lisztomania, that his music
could be any worse.
Lisztomania vaguely purports
to deal with Liszt's numerous
love affairs and his relationship
with composer Richard Wagner.
Roger Daltrey of The Who, star of
Russell's last film Tommy, is the
fantasy-ridden Liszt, and Paul
Nicholson, who appeared as the
perverted Cousin Kevin in
Tommy, plays Wagner. The two
musicians are conceived as
19th-century pop stars, Liszt as a
glittery exhibitionist and
Wagner as a revolutionary
superstar.
Once Russell makes his paral
lels between Liszt, Wagner and
pop stardom, the film is no more
than a series of private and con
sequently meaningless fantasies
which seem to have been still
born in Russell's imagination.
Outrageous fantasia
The many sexual fantasies in
the film are perhaps too out
rageous to offend; they are so
much a part of Russell's inner
imagination that they become
mere prolonged autoerotica.

Throughout Liszt's fantasies
women appear as vampires who
physically threaten to drain his
music from him. While they
throw themselves at him, Liszt
periodically announces with
grave innocence that all he
wants from life is to write good
music. Rut Daltrey is not able to
convince us that he really wants
anything. He is simply Russell's
disjointed puppet.

Musical exorcism
Near the film's conclusion, the
Rope sends Liszt on a mission to
exorcize the devil from Richard
Wagner who is busily preparing,
50 years in advance, for Nazism.
Wagner dies at the mercy of Liszt
and a fireshooting piano. Liszt
eventually ascends to heaven
where he plays beautiful music
with an orchestra of his former
mistresses on a phallic pedestal
in the sky.
At one point, Liszt responds to
a criticism of his music by stat
ing emphatically that, "Time
kills critics." In the case of
Lisztomania, it may kill
bad art as well.
