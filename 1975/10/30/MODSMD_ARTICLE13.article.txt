# Camelot:
## King Arthur loses, but so does the audience 
### 
reviewed by 808 Henry
Cume/of has begun a six-week
run at San Francisco's Curran
Theatre, and with luck it just
may make it all the way to clos
ing night (Dec. 6).
This Civic Light Opera pro
duction destroys whatever con
cern or feeling the audience may
have had for the story's dramatic
and didactic ending by bom
barding one with three hours of
sloppy directing, uninventive
sets and clumsy costumes.
When the extras are not trip
ping or wandering aimlessly
about the stage under Douglas
Campbell's direction, they stand
by passively speaking at one
another.
Cuenevere (Anne Rogers) has
gowns she cannot walk in —
obscenely hindered by four-inch
spike heels — courtesy of cos
tumer Frank Thompson, and she
leads the over-gowned and
over-cloaked cast in this lavish
stumble-in.
The excessive costumes only

further clutter the already
crowded and visually disturbing
stage, as King Arthur attempts to
found the first United Nations.
Arthur loses!
The story revolves around
Arthur's quest to change "might
makes right" into "might for
right." He estabishes the round
table in hopes of having discus
sions and debates instead of
wars, but the knights' love for
battle and the mischievous do
ings of the villain Mordred (ex
cellently played by Scott Jarvis)
defeat Arthur.
The king maintains at the end,
however, that there are "a few
good drops in this endless sea (of
humanity)" as he sends a young
would-be knight back home to
tell everyone how Camelot
briefly put an end to war.
Edward Mulhare, perhaps best
known to most TV viewers as
the ghost on The Ghost and Mrs.
Muir, plays Arthur, and despite
jumbling a few lines and not
being able to sing very well,

manages to give the production a
few fine dramatic instances.
Rogers sings nicely, but bur
dened by abundant clothing and
a Lancelot (Ron Husman) that
fails to portray his conversion
from super-knight to frustrated
lover, she cannot do much with
her part.
Music subdued
Three of Lerner and Loewe's
16 songs approach the level of
entertainment the musical
should have: The proud Lan
celot gallantly sings "C'est
Moi," proclaiming himself more
formidable than even the Six
Million Dollar Man; the entire
cast manages to stay out of each
other's way enough for "The
Lusty Month Of May" to be en
joyable; and the Mordred-led
knights, in the one scene where
the actors finally take their capes
off, crisply sing "Fie On Good
ness."
There are, however, some in
defatigable fans of musicals who
cannot resist a show, and at
Camelot they will receive some
brief moments of good singing,
good acting, funny lines, good
staging, and may somehow ab
sorb the fine dramatic dialogue
in the final two scenes.
And they'll get to see Gale
Gordon of The Lucille Ball Show
(Mr. Mooney), Here's Lucy
(Uncle Harry), and Dennis The
Menace (Mr. Wilson) as the
dragon-hunting, humorous old
King Pellinore. Gordon should
have remained on television.
