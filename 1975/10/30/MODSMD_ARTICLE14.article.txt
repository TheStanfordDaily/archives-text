Rock of the We sties, by Elton
John, MCA 2163.
The unshaven face of rock's
biggest superstar leers out sar
donically from the cover of Elton
John's latest album, Rock of the
Westies. And even the most de
voted fans are apt to see that
grinning face looming before
them and whispering, "Hey,
suckers!" as they listen to each
and every track.
In other words, this album
can't be a serious effort — not
with its disjointed and trite
lyrics, not with its almost total
lack of melody, not with its clut
tered and unoriginal instrumen
tals. One wonders if it was writ
ten and recorded out of sheer
boredom in the span of one rainy
afternoon, simply to pass the
time.
After Captain Fantastic and
the Brown Dirt Cowboy, criti
cally acclaimed as John's best
album to date, the British singer
hardly even allowed the presses
to cool down before he released
this effort only five months later.
And now he can sit back, snic
kering while he watches the
crowds blindly flock to the re
cord stores, his fans confident
that Elton has come out with
another album with the acknow
ledged quality of his last.
But seriously, is the album re
ally a satire on what people will
buy ? One has to ask the question
after listening to it again and
again and finding so very few
positive things about it. It's
doubtful that even Elton John
would have the audacity to take
the entire record-buying public
