Rock of the We sties, by Elton
John, MCA 2163.
The unshaven face of rock's
biggest superstar leers out sar
donically from the cover of Elton
John's latest album, Rock of the
Westies. And even the most de
voted fans are apt to see that
grinning face looming before
them and whispering, "Hey,
suckers!" as they listen to each
and every track.
In other words, this album
can't be a serious effort — not
with its disjointed and trite
lyrics, not with its almost total
lack of melody, not with its clut
tered and unoriginal instrumen
tals. One wonders if it was writ
ten and recorded out of sheer
boredom in the span of one rainy
afternoon, simply to pass the
time.
After Captain Fantastic and
the Brown Dirt Cowboy, criti
cally acclaimed as John's best
album to date, the British singer
hardly even allowed the presses
to cool down before he released
this effort only five months later.
And now he can sit back, snic
kering while he watches the
crowds blindly flock to the re
cord stores, his fans confident
that Elton has come out with
another album with the acknow
ledged quality of his last.
But seriously, is the album re
ally a satire on what people will
buy ? One has to ask the question
after listening to it again and
again and finding so very few
positive things about it. It's
doubtful that even Elton John
would have the audacity to take
the entire record-buying public
for a ride, so the album has to be
viewed as it stands.
And as it stands, the album
contains not even one redeem
ing song. Almost all of the cuts
are remarkably similar
sounding. a criticism often made
of John in the past. It's a raunch
album, and poor raunch at best.
John screams and rasps his way
through practically every song,
backed by the messy instrumen
tals of his new and unspectacu
lar group.
"Island Girl," the first single
off the album, is a pseudo-reggae
piece which would be one of the
more mediocre cuts on most
other Elton John albums. On
Hock of the Westies. though, it is
a highlight, surpassed only by a
pleasant-sounding "I Feel I.ike a
Bullet (In the Gun of Robert
Ford)" in a three-legged race for
the dubious prize for best song
on the album.
The satire theory is furthered
by the lyrics of Bernie Taupin.
Taupin has always been incon
sistent in bis efforts, ranging
from the spectacular ("Rocket
Man"; "Country Comfort") to
the incredibly bad ("Philadel
phia Freedom"; "Stinker"). But
on this album he ranges into the
ridiculous.
Like corn in a field I cut you
down
I threw the Inst punch too hard
After years of going steady.
Really. Bernie. Really, Elton. If
Hock oft he Westies does indeed
represent a true effort at musical
art. Flton John has taken vet
another step towards aesthetic
oblivion

would have the audacity to take
the entire record-buying public
for a ride, so the album has to be
viewed as it stands.
And as it stands, the album
contains not even one redeem
ing song. Almost all of the cuts
are remarkably similar
sounding. a criticism often made
of John in the past. It's a raunch
album, and poor raunch at best.
John screams and rasps his way
through practically every song,
backed by the messy instrumen
tals of his new and unspectacu
lar group.
"Island Girl," the first single
off the album, is a pseudo-reggae
piece which would be one of the
more mediocre cuts on most
other Elton John albums. On
Hock of the Westies. though, it is
a highlight, surpassed only by a
pleasant-sounding "I Feel I.ike a
Bullet (In the Gun of Robert
Ford)" in a three-legged race for
the dubious prize for best song
on the album.
The satire theory is furthered
by the lyrics of Bernie Taupin.
Taupin has always been incon
sistent in bis efforts, ranging
from the spectacular ("Rocket
Man"; "Country Comfort") to
the incredibly bad ("Philadel
phia Freedom"; "Stinker"). But
on this album he ranges into the
ridiculous.
Like corn in a field I cut you
down
I threw the Inst punch too hard
After years of going steady.
Really. Bernie. Really, Elton. If
Hock oft he Westies does indeed
represent a true effort at musical
art. Flton John has taken vet
another step towards aesthetic
oblivion

Rock of the We sties, by Elton
John, MCA 2163.
The unshaven face of rock's
biggest superstar leers out sar
donically from the cover of Elton
John's latest album, Rock of the
Westies. And even the most de
voted fans are apt to see that
grinning face looming before
them and whispering, "Hey,
suckers!" as they listen to each
and every track.
In other words, this album
can't be a serious effort — not
with its disjointed and trite
lyrics, not with its almost total
lack of melody, not with its clut
tered and unoriginal instrumen
tals. One wonders if it was writ
ten and recorded out of sheer
boredom in the span of one rainy
afternoon, simply to pass the
time.
After Captain Fantastic and
the Brown Dirt Cowboy, criti
cally acclaimed as John's best
album to date, the British singer
hardly even allowed the presses
to cool down before he released
this effort only five months later.
And now he can sit back, snic
kering while he watches the
crowds blindly flock to the re
cord stores, his fans confident
that Elton has come out with
another album with the acknow
ledged quality of his last.
But seriously, is the album re
ally a satire on what people will
buy ? One has to ask the question
after listening to it again and
again and finding so very few
positive things about it. It's
doubtful that even Elton John
would have the audacity to take
the entire record-buying public
for a ride, so the album has to be
viewed as it stands.
