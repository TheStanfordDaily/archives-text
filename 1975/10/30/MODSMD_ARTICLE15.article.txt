# 'Alice' is delightful

The Bureau of Creative
Mythology, a new experimental
theatre group, has produced a
handsomely mounted and well
performed production of Alice
in Wonderland for its Palo Alto
debut.
The only real problem with
the show seems to be the small
size of the audience there to ap
preciate the Bureau's efforts.
The ensemble spirit among
the cast was very strong, and the
production showed a clear dedi
cation to an ensemble approach.
Each actor played several roles
as the play progressed, and all of
the actors played Alice at one
time or another.
As the portrayal of Alice
switched from actor to actor, the
character's confusions and
transformations were heigh
tened without confusing the au
dience, since it was always clear
just who was playing Alice at
any given moment. In the inter
view with the hookah-smoking
caterpillar, Alice flies from actor
toactor, culminating in a chorus
of Alices as her hysteria grows.
Audience participation
Also in the spirit of ensemble,
the audience was drawn into the
production. The actors woidd
wander through the seats speak
ing to the audience, and at times
would invite them on stage to
participate in small ways in the
action. The audience involve
ment was never pushed too far,
though, and always remained
nonthreatening.
The acting was broad, borrow
ing more from mimeand modern
dance than from realism. The

cast as a whole handled the
movement well, hut Felix Win
ters and Sam Ambler was clear
standouts, showing flexibility,
precision, and charity in their
mime work.
Unlike most multi-media
shows, the various production
aspects fit together without
clumsiness and also worked
well individually.
Artificial expansiveness
Slides by Chrissy Freeman
were projected on four screens
throughout the performance,
providing a counterpoint to the
action and creating an expansive
feeling in the enclosed space.
Background music, although
borrowed from various genres,
flowed naturally and supported
the acting, dancing and projec
tions.
The basic costume for the en
semble was a thin, form-fitting

overall worn over leotards and
tiwills Over these were costumes
for each character which, though
simple, achieved a lavishness
through their carefulcraltsman
ship.
The work of Gail Anerson.
designer, Harriet Garfinkel. cos
tume mistress, and the entire
costume crew lent a solid air.ol
professionalism.
Director Richard Carp pulled
together a garagantuan under
taking and blended it into a har
monious whole. Most gratifying
was his refusal to overindulge in
experimentation for its own
sake. He took care never to ig
nore his audience in favor of
theatrical onanism.
The Bureau will present Alicv
on Wednesdays through Sun
days until November 22, at the
school gym on 750 N. California,
Palo Alto.

The Bureau of Creative
Mythology, a new experimental
theatre group, has produced a
handsomely mounted and well
performed production of Alice
in Wonderland for its Palo Alto
debut.
The only real problem with
the show seems to be the small
size of the audience there to ap
preciate the Bureau's efforts.
The ensemble spirit among
the cast was very strong, and the
production showed a clear dedi
cation to an ensemble approach.
Each actor played several roles
as the play progressed, and all of
the actors played Alice at one
time or another.
As the portrayal of Alice
switched from actor to actor, the
character's confusions and
transformations were heigh
tened without confusing the au
dience, since it was always clear
just who was playing Alice at
any given moment. In the inter
view with the hookah-smoking
caterpillar, Alice flies from actor
toactor, culminating in a chorus
of Alices as her hysteria grows.
Audience participation
Also in the spirit of ensemble,
the audience was drawn into the
production. The actors woidd
wander through the seats speak
ing to the audience, and at times
would invite them on stage to
participate in small ways in the
action. The audience involve
ment was never pushed too far,
though, and always remained
nonthreatening.
The acting was broad, borrow
ing more from mimeand modern
dance than from realism. The

cast as a whole handled the
movement well, hut Felix Win
ters and Sam Ambler was clear
standouts, showing flexibility,
precision, and charity in their
mime work.
Unlike most multi-media
shows, the various production
aspects fit together without
clumsiness and also worked
well individually.
Artificial expansiveness
Slides by Chrissy Freeman
were projected on four screens
throughout the performance,
providing a counterpoint to the
action and creating an expansive
feeling in the enclosed space.
Background music, although
borrowed from various genres,
flowed naturally and supported
the acting, dancing and projec
tions.
The basic costume for the en
semble was a thin, form-fitting

overall worn over leotards and
tiwills Over these were costumes
for each character which, though
simple, achieved a lavishness
through their carefulcraltsman
ship.
The work of Gail Anerson.
designer, Harriet Garfinkel. cos
tume mistress, and the entire
costume crew lent a solid air.ol
professionalism.
Director Richard Carp pulled
together a garagantuan under
taking and blended it into a har
monious whole. Most gratifying
was his refusal to overindulge in
experimentation for its own
sake. He took care never to ig
nore his audience in favor of
theatrical onanism.
The Bureau will present Alicv
on Wednesdays through Sun
days until November 22, at the
school gym on 750 N. California,
Palo Alto.
