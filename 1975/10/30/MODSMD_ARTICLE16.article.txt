The Venture Theatre Company's production
of Sean O'Casey's I Knock At The Door displays
an accepted but rare style of staging dramas. A
narrator tells the story of the birth and early
growth of John Cassidy while at times the five
actors seated on stools at the rear of the stage
enact the crucial moments of his young life.
As there is almost no dramatic interaction
between actors, most lines are spoken directly
to the audience, and there is no movement on
stage, so only the script and the acting remain
to attract the audience's attention.
While the acting succeds for the most part,
O'Casey's autobiogaphical script, although
very powerful and moving when showing the
bitter and cruel world the poor, fatherless,
half-blind johnny enters, lacks the complete
intensity and forcefulness a drama of that sort
must have.
The Showcase Theatre in San Francisco
suits the production well. The well-designed,
intimate theatre, transformed into perhaps 20
different locations in the telling of Johnny's
story, is small but not stifling.
Olwen Morgan as Johnny's mother excel

lently portrays the strong-willed woman who
must battle the heartless protestant minister,
the wicked schoolmaster, the deaths of her
husband and three of her children, and the
harsh life of the Dublin tenements.
Bernard Bolter as Johnny does not convey
the change from infant to adolescent, and
seems to be too old overall, but his otherwise
competent performance strengthens the pro
duction. Alan Barnes, Deborah Hecht and Rob
Pherson all portrayseveral different characters
in Johnny's life, a challenge they more than
adequately subdue.
Director Jan Anger keeps the silent actors in
darkness, illuminating only an actor involved
in a scene or narrator Irving Israel. In a few
instances she does have the characters speak
directly to one another, and these blend very
smoothly with the "isolationist" attitude of the
production.
If one expects thedifferent style of the drama,
and appreciates the references to the rebellious
Irish nationalist Parnell, plus areas of Dublin,
the strict Protestant upbringing, and"the Irish
way of life," it can be very entertaining. I Knock
At The Door runs Thursday thru Sunday until
November 23.
