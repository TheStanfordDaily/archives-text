# Mersky excels as Duncan
## 
### Janice Ross 
Kres Mersky is one young ac
tress who has clearly learned that
less means more. Her one-woman
recital, "Isadora Duncan" (cur
rently at the Open Theatre in San
Francisco), is a stunning tes
timony to simplicity, economy
and understatement.
Mersky's hour-long impersona
tion of the gifted and free-spirited
dancer is set in the delightful am
bience of a 1922 lecture at the
"Clement Cultural Center." Under
this guise, Mersky reveals Duncan
as a seditious feminist, a dedi
cated "children's champion" and
an iconoclastic artist.
Instead of succumbing to Van
essa Redgrave's film version of
"The Loves of Isadora," Mersky
creates her own uniquely stylized
character, flawed only by occa
sionally excessive hand gestures
and her too obvious youthfulness.
Mersky also plays up the more
intimate aspects of Duncan's per
sonal life, and she is often more
unabashed than one imagines
Duncan (despite all her

candor) would have been before a
mixed group in 1922.
From the moment she dashes in,
breathless and late, graciously
apologizing to random people in
the audience, until her tearful and
choked departure, Mersky wins
unflagging attention and sym
pathy.
Although she never actually
dances, Mersky has captured the
ease and long-necked grace of a
dancer. And when she speaks of
her vision of a new dance whose
energy radiates from the solarp
lexus of the body outward, and of
her desire for a dance that moves
in harmony with nature rather
than the "crippling affectations"
of ballet, the audience is moved by
her ardor and passion.
The most humanizing aspect of
Mersky's portrayal is her ability to
imbue Duncan with a sense of
humor about herself and her
dreams. "The children of the
world will all dance to
Beethoven's Ninth!" she cries
triumphantly. "All we need is a
little capital."
