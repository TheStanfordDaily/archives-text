# Reggaae
## "you can get it if you really want" 
### Perry Simon Alexander Leff 
A slim blonde, her upper body
sporting only a thin green band
of satin, shimmies to the
Jamaican rhythm. A black cou
ple floats across the dance floor,
their entire bodies moving up
and down in tune with each
other and the übiquitous percus
sion.
A number of patrons dance
alone, totally immersed in the
beat as they trot around the
room. Cowbells, congas, tim
bales and drums underscore the
scratching rhythmic guitar,
lively sax and ever-steady bass
guitar.
The crowd is predominantly
white, but at one side of the room
sit three Jamaicans, who quietly
take in the music, nodding their
heads appreciatively.
The music: reggae.
"Yeah, Reggae.' 'Duh Numbah
one soun' een Sawn Franceesco
townne!"
Disc jockey Tony Wright flips
a switch on the control board,
and Bob Marley's high-pitched
wail comes floating across the
KPOO-FM airwaves.
"One goood theeng a-bout

music: when 'eet hits, yo' feel
noli paine."
Whereverone turns within San
Francisco's hipper-than-hip
music circles, one will en
counter an infatuation with reg
gae music. Reggae records,
concerts, radio shows, discos
and Jamaican accents can be
found throughout the Bay
Area— if one knows where to
look.
"Reggae music is especially
popular in San Francisco, due to
the large number of artists and
musicians that hang out here,"
says Jean Desarmes, leader of a
local group called the Reggae
Blues Band. "Artists tend to be
more responsive to its roots and
rhythms."
Reggae's recent surge in popu
larity in the Bay Area can be
traced back to last July, when
two famous regga6 bands. Bob
Marley and the Wailers. and
Toots and the Maytals, appeared
in San Francisco within a week
of each other.
Reggae hits the waves
Riding on the wave of en
thusiasm generated by these
concerts, the reggae scene in the
Bay Area took flight. Various

forms of reggae entertainment,
which had been around town for
months or even years, suddenly
found their audiences sharply
increasing.
Minnie's Can-Do Club on San
Francisco's Haight Street had
been featuring live reggae enter
tainment on an irregular basis
for a number of months. Sud
denly last July, Minnie found
that her modest, hand-written
"Reggae Tonight" sign was at
tracting hoards of customers
everytime she hung it in her
front window.
Minnie booked Desarmes and
his Reggae Blues Band to play at
her club on Thursday nights.

Since that time, reggae at
Minnie's has been standard fare
at least twice a week.
Different from disco
The club takes on a different
atmosphere when the reggae
beat floats throughout the room.
The floor is tightly packed, but
the scene is exuberant harmony.
The dancers move with a fluid
syncopated motion, much dif
ferent from the mechanical jerk
ing associated with the disco
beat.
A similar scene exists at the
Longbranch Club in Berkeley,
where a steady diet of reggae
music is fed to the clients, often
at a rate of four nights per week.
Desarmes attributes reggae's
popularity to the simplicity of
the music. "Unlike jazz, reggae
is easy to understand and enjoy.
Often, we use only three or four
chords.'
Mellow sounds
And as for dancing: "Reggae
rhythm is much less frenetic and
heavy than rock 'n roll. The
music is mellow; it makes you
want to relax and dance."
Desarmes notes that most Bay
Area reggae audiences are pre
dominantly young whites. How
ever, he fondly recalls a recent
reggae concert at the San Fran
cisco Main Library, where his
band played for a crowd ranging
in age from 20 to 80.
"The older people enjoyed us
the most. They were dancing all
night; we couldn't stop them."
Cornering the market
Perhaps no one in the Bay
Area has as much control over
reggae's exposure as Tony
Wright, a young Jamaican who
came to America about five years
ago, after having run a reggae
discotheque named
"Psychotown" in Kingston.
Two years ago, Wright started
a little-known reggae radio
broadcast on San Francisco's
community radio station,
KPOO-FM. Since last July, his
program has grown increas
ingly popular, and he now finds
himself as the reggae disc joc
key on three Bay Area radio sta
tions.
In addition, he runs the Mango
Disco, a mobile reggae disco
which Wright takes to various
nightclubs in the Bay Area, in
cluding the Can-Do. the
Longbranch and the Lake
Merced Lounge.
Standing about 5-foot-H. with

fair brown skin, Wright exudes
confidence. He speaks with a
lilting Jamaican accent that
lends credence to his opinion
ated comments.
Spreading the word
"I want to bring reggae music
to the people, so they can learn to
understand it,"he says.
When asked to comment on
the allegations by many music
critics that reggae is merely
primitive dance music, his re
sponse is characteristicallylofty,
yet forceful:
"He 'ooh knows not, 'und
knows 'dhat he knows not, 'ees a
chyld . . . teech 'eem.
"He 'ooh knows not, 'und
knows not 'dhat he knows not,
'ees a foohl . . . shun 'eem.
"He 'ooh knows, 'und knows
'dhat he knows, 'ees a wise
mahn . . . seeek "eem."
Selling the beat
Wright is dedicated to bring
ing to reggae music the popular
exposure and support he be
lieves it deserves in the Bay
Area. Together with partner
Ruel Mills, they share a small
storefront in San Francisco's
Fillmore district. This dingy of
fice is adorned with Jamaican
flags, zebra rugs, rattan furniture
and an "Accounting Made Easy"
handbook on the book shelf.
Wright and Mills established
an all-reggae record store called
"Kingston Records" 11 months
ago. They see their operation as
both educational and profitable.
"You can come to our store
and find out what reggae is all
about, mahn," savs Mills. "You
have other places 'that carry reg
gae records, but when you
leave, mahn, you walk out as ig
norant as when you walked in."
Early this year, the two estab
lished "Kingston Productions
and set out to bring top-name
reg-gae to the Bay Area. Their
first extravaganza was the "Re
ggae Explosion" last July, featur
ing Toots and the Maytals.
But both Mills and Wright will
have to reckon with promoter
Bill Graham, who is also becom
ing active in the local reggae
scene. Control of the Bay Area's
reggae concert scene is still an
open question.
Certainly marijuana and reg
gae flourish in Jamaica, but the
Bay Area has enough of both to
keep anyone satisfied on a
Saturday night.

found their audiences sharply
increasing.
Minnie's Can-Do Club on San
Francisco's Haight Street had
been featuring live reggae enter
tainment on an irregular basis
for a number of months. Sud
denly last July, Minnie found
that her modest, hand-written
"Reggae Tonight" sign was at
tracting hoards of customers
everytime she hung it in her
front window.
Minnie booked Desarmes and
his Reggae Blues Band to play at
her club on Thursday nights.

Since that time, reggae at
Minnie's has been standard fare
at least twice a week.
Different from disco
The club takes on a different
atmosphere when the reggae
beat floats throughout the room.
The floor is tightly packed, but
the scene is exuberant harmony.
The dancers move with a fluid
syncopated motion, much dif
ferent from the mechanical jerk
ing associated with the disco
beat.
A similar scene exists at the
Longbranch Club in Berkeley,
where a steady diet of reggae
music is fed to the clients, often
at a rate of four nights per week.
Desarmes attributes reggae's
popularity to the simplicity of
the music. "Unlike jazz, reggae
is easy to understand and enjoy.
Often, we use only three or four
chords.'
Mellow sounds
And as for dancing: "Reggae
rhythm is much less frenetic and
heavy than rock 'n roll. The
music is mellow; it makes you
want to relax and dance."
Desarmes notes that most Bay
Area reggae audiences are pre
dominantly young whites. How
ever, he fondly recalls a recent
reggae concert at the San Fran
cisco Main Library, where his
band played for a crowd ranging
in age from 20 to 80.
"The older people enjoyed us
the most. They were dancing all
night; we couldn't stop them."
Cornering the market
Perhaps no one in the Bay
Area has as much control over
reggae's exposure as Tony
Wright, a young Jamaican who
came to America about five years
ago, after having run a reggae
discotheque named
"Psychotown" in Kingston.
Two years ago, Wright started
a little-known reggae radio
broadcast on San Francisco's
community radio station,
KPOO-FM. Since last July, his
program has grown increas
ingly popular, and he now finds
himself as the reggae disc joc
key on three Bay Area radio sta
tions.
In addition, he runs the Mango
Disco, a mobile reggae disco
which Wright takes to various
nightclubs in the Bay Area, in
cluding the Can-Do. the
Longbranch and the Lake
Merced Lounge.
Standing about 5-foot-H. with

fair brown skin, Wright exudes
confidence. He speaks with a
lilting Jamaican accent that
lends credence to his opinion
ated comments.
Spreading the word
"I want to bring reggae music
to the people, so they can learn to
understand it,"he says.
When asked to comment on
the allegations by many music
critics that reggae is merely
primitive dance music, his re
sponse is characteristicallylofty,
yet forceful:
"He 'ooh knows not, 'und
knows 'dhat he knows not, 'ees a
chyld . . . teech 'eem.
"He 'ooh knows not, 'und
knows not 'dhat he knows not,
'ees a foohl . . . shun 'eem.
"He 'ooh knows, 'und knows
'dhat he knows, 'ees a wise
mahn . . . seeek "eem."
Selling the beat
Wright is dedicated to bring
ing to reggae music the popular
exposure and support he be
lieves it deserves in the Bay
Area. Together with partner
Ruel Mills, they share a small
storefront in San Francisco's
Fillmore district. This dingy of
fice is adorned with Jamaican
flags, zebra rugs, rattan furniture
and an "Accounting Made Easy"
handbook on the book shelf.
Wright and Mills established
an all-reggae record store called
"Kingston Records" 11 months
ago. They see their operation as
both educational and profitable.
"You can come to our store
and find out what reggae is all
about, mahn," savs Mills. "You
have other places 'that carry reg
gae records, but when you
leave, mahn, you walk out as ig
norant as when you walked in."
Early this year, the two estab
lished "Kingston Productions
and set out to bring top-name
reg-gae to the Bay Area. Their
first extravaganza was the "Re
ggae Explosion" last July, featur
ing Toots and the Maytals.
But both Mills and Wright will
have to reckon with promoter
Bill Graham, who is also becom
ing active in the local reggae
scene. Control of the Bay Area's
reggae concert scene is still an
open question.
Certainly marijuana and reg
gae flourish in Jamaica, but the
Bay Area has enough of both to
keep anyone satisfied on a
Saturday night.


'IT'S A FEELING, MAHN' —Disc Jockey Tony Wright has been instrumental in promoting Bay Area
reggae. He spins reggae records for three local radio stations.
A slim blonde, her upper body
sporting only a thin green band
of satin, shimmies to the
Jamaican rhythm. A black cou
ple floats across the dance floor,
their entire bodies moving up
and down in tune with each
other and the übiquitous percus
sion.
A number of patrons dance
alone, totally immersed in the
beat as they trot around the
room. Cowbells, congas, tim
bales and drums underscore the
scratching rhythmic guitar,
lively sax and ever-steady bass
guitar.
The crowd is predominantly
white, but at one side of the room
sit three Jamaicans, who quietly
take in the music, nodding their
heads appreciatively.
The music: reggae.
"Yeah, Reggae.' 'Duh Numbah
one soun' een Sawn Franceesco
townne!"
Disc jockey Tony Wright flips
a switch on the control board,
and Bob Marley's high-pitched
wail comes floating across the
KPOO-FM airwaves.
"One goood theeng a-bout

music: when 'eet hits, yo' feel
noli paine."
Whereverone turns within San
Francisco's hipper-than-hip
music circles, one will en
counter an infatuation with reg
gae music. Reggae records,
concerts, radio shows, discos
and Jamaican accents can be
found throughout the Bay
Area— if one knows where to
look.
"Reggae music is especially
popular in San Francisco, due to
the large number of artists and
musicians that hang out here,"
says Jean Desarmes, leader of a
local group called the Reggae
Blues Band. "Artists tend to be
more responsive to its roots and
rhythms."
Reggae's recent surge in popu
larity in the Bay Area can be
traced back to last July, when
two famous regga6 bands. Bob
Marley and the Wailers. and
Toots and the Maytals, appeared
in San Francisco within a week
of each other.
Reggae hits the waves
Riding on the wave of en
thusiasm generated by these
concerts, the reggae scene in the
Bay Area took flight. Various

KPOO-FM. Since last July, his
program has grown increas
ingly popular, and he now finds
himself as the reggae disc joc
key on three Bay Area radio sta
tions.
In addition, he runs the Mango
Disco, a mobile reggae disco
which Wright takes to various
nightclubs in the Bay Area, in
cluding the Can-Do. the
Longbranch and the Lake
Merced Lounge.
Standing about 5-foot-H. with

fair brown skin, Wright exudes
confidence. He speaks with a
lilting Jamaican accent that
lends credence to his opinion
ated comments.
Spreading the word
"I want to bring reggae music
to the people, so they can learn to
understand it,"he says.
When asked to comment on
the allegations by many music
critics that reggae is merely
primitive dance music, his re
sponse is characteristicallylofty,
yet forceful:
"He 'ooh knows not, 'und
knows 'dhat he knows not, 'ees a
chyld . . . teech 'eem.
"He 'ooh knows not, 'und
knows not 'dhat he knows not,
'ees a foohl . . . shun 'eem.
"He 'ooh knows, 'und knows
'dhat he knows, 'ees a wise
mahn . . . seeek "eem."
Selling the beat
Wright is dedicated to bring
ing to reggae music the popular
exposure and support he be
lieves it deserves in the Bay
Area. Together with partner
Ruel Mills, they share a small
storefront in San Francisco's
Fillmore district. This dingy of
fice is adorned with Jamaican
flags, zebra rugs, rattan furniture
and an "Accounting Made Easy"
handbook on the book shelf.
Wright and Mills established
an all-reggae record store called
"Kingston Records" 11 months
ago. They see their operation as
both educational and profitable.
"You can come to our store
and find out what reggae is all
about, mahn," savs Mills. "You
have other places 'that carry reg
gae records, but when you
leave, mahn, you walk out as ig
norant as when you walked in."
Early this year, the two estab
lished "Kingston Productions
and set out to bring top-name
reg-gae to the Bay Area. Their
first extravaganza was the "Re
ggae Explosion" last July, featur
ing Toots and the Maytals.
But both Mills and Wright will
have to reckon with promoter
Bill Graham, who is also becom
ing active in the local reggae
scene. Control of the Bay Area's
reggae concert scene is still an
open question.
Certainly marijuana and reg
gae flourish in Jamaica, but the
Bay Area has enough of both to
keep anyone satisfied on a
Saturday night.


'IT'S A FEELING, MAHN' —Disc Jockey Tony Wright has been instrumental in promoting Bay Area
reggae. He spins reggae records for three local radio stations.
A slim blonde, her upper body
sporting only a thin green band
of satin, shimmies to the
Jamaican rhythm. A black cou
ple floats across the dance floor,
their entire bodies moving up
and down in tune with each
other and the übiquitous percus
sion.
A number of patrons dance
alone, totally immersed in the
beat as they trot around the
room. Cowbells, congas, tim
bales and drums underscore the
scratching rhythmic guitar,
lively sax and ever-steady bass
guitar.
The crowd is predominantly
white, but at one side of the room
sit three Jamaicans, who quietly
take in the music, nodding their
heads appreciatively.
The music: reggae.
"Yeah, Reggae.' 'Duh Numbah
one soun' een Sawn Franceesco
townne!"
Disc jockey Tony Wright flips
a switch on the control board,
and Bob Marley's high-pitched
wail comes floating across the
KPOO-FM airwaves.
"One goood theeng a-bout

music: when 'eet hits, yo' feel
noli paine."
Whereverone turns within San
Francisco's hipper-than-hip
music circles, one will en
counter an infatuation with reg
gae music. Reggae records,
concerts, radio shows, discos
and Jamaican accents can be
found throughout the Bay
Area— if one knows where to
look.
"Reggae music is especially
popular in San Francisco, due to
the large number of artists and
musicians that hang out here,"
says Jean Desarmes, leader of a
local group called the Reggae
Blues Band. "Artists tend to be
more responsive to its roots and
rhythms."
Reggae's recent surge in popu
larity in the Bay Area can be
traced back to last July, when
two famous regga6 bands. Bob
Marley and the Wailers. and
Toots and the Maytals, appeared
in San Francisco within a week
of each other.
Reggae hits the waves
Riding on the wave of en
thusiasm generated by these
concerts, the reggae scene in the
Bay Area took flight. Various

forms of reggae entertainment,
which had been around town for
months or even years, suddenly
found their audiences sharply
increasing.
Minnie's Can-Do Club on San
Francisco's Haight Street had
been featuring live reggae enter
tainment on an irregular basis
for a number of months. Sud
denly last July, Minnie found
that her modest, hand-written
"Reggae Tonight" sign was at
tracting hoards of customers
everytime she hung it in her
front window.
Minnie booked Desarmes and
his Reggae Blues Band to play at
her club on Thursday nights.

Since that time, reggae at
Minnie's has been standard fare
at least twice a week.
Different from disco
The club takes on a different
atmosphere when the reggae
beat floats throughout the room.
The floor is tightly packed, but
the scene is exuberant harmony.
The dancers move with a fluid
syncopated motion, much dif
ferent from the mechanical jerk
ing associated with the disco
beat.
A similar scene exists at the
Longbranch Club in Berkeley,
where a steady diet of reggae
music is fed to the clients, often
at a rate of four nights per week.
Desarmes attributes reggae's
popularity to the simplicity of
the music. "Unlike jazz, reggae
is easy to understand and enjoy.
Often, we use only three or four
chords.'
Mellow sounds
And as for dancing: "Reggae
rhythm is much less frenetic and
heavy than rock 'n roll. The
music is mellow; it makes you
want to relax and dance."
Desarmes notes that most Bay
Area reggae audiences are pre
dominantly young whites. How
ever, he fondly recalls a recent
reggae concert at the San Fran
cisco Main Library, where his
band played for a crowd ranging
in age from 20 to 80.
"The older people enjoyed us
the most. They were dancing all
night; we couldn't stop them."
Cornering the market
Perhaps no one in the Bay
Area has as much control over
reggae's exposure as Tony
Wright, a young Jamaican who
came to America about five years
ago, after having run a reggae
discotheque named
"Psychotown" in Kingston.
Two years ago, Wright started
a little-known reggae radio
broadcast on San Francisco's
community radio station,
KPOO-FM. Since last July, his
program has grown increas

and set out to bring top-name
reg-gae to the Bay Area. Their
first extravaganza was the "Re
ggae Explosion" last July, featur
ing Toots and the Maytals.
But both Mills and Wright will
have to reckon with promoter
Bill Graham, who is also becom
ing active in the local reggae
scene. Control of the Bay Area's
reggae concert scene is still an
open question.
Certainly marijuana and reg
gae flourish in Jamaica, but the
Bay Area has enough of both to
keep anyone satisfied on a
Saturday night.


'IT'S A FEELING, MAHN' —Disc Jockey Tony Wright has been instrumental in promoting Bay Area
reggae. He spins reggae records for three local radio stations.
A slim blonde, her upper body
sporting only a thin green band
of satin, shimmies to the
Jamaican rhythm. A black cou
ple floats across the dance floor,
their entire bodies moving up
and down in tune with each
other and the übiquitous percus
sion.
A number of patrons dance
alone, totally immersed in the
beat as they trot around the
room. Cowbells, congas, tim
bales and drums underscore the
scratching rhythmic guitar,
lively sax and ever-steady bass
guitar.
The crowd is predominantly
white, but at one side of the room
sit three Jamaicans, who quietly
take in the music, nodding their
heads appreciatively.
The music: reggae.
"Yeah, Reggae.' 'Duh Numbah
one soun' een Sawn Franceesco
townne!"
Disc jockey Tony Wright flips
a switch on the control board,
and Bob Marley's high-pitched
wail comes floating across the
KPOO-FM airwaves.
"One goood theeng a-bout

music: when 'eet hits, yo' feel
noli paine."
Whereverone turns within San
Francisco's hipper-than-hip
music circles, one will en
counter an infatuation with reg
gae music. Reggae records,
concerts, radio shows, discos
and Jamaican accents can be
found throughout the Bay
Area— if one knows where to
look.
"Reggae music is especially
popular in San Francisco, due to
the large number of artists and
musicians that hang out here,"
says Jean Desarmes, leader of a
local group called the Reggae
Blues Band. "Artists tend to be
more responsive to its roots and
rhythms."
Reggae's recent surge in popu
larity in the Bay Area can be
traced back to last July, when
two famous regga6 bands. Bob
Marley and the Wailers. and
Toots and the Maytals, appeared
in San Francisco within a week
of each other.
Reggae hits the waves
Riding on the wave of en
thusiasm generated by these
concerts, the reggae scene in the
Bay Area took flight. Various

forms of reggae entertainment,
which had been around town for
months or even years, suddenly
found their audiences sharply
increasing.
Minnie's Can-Do Club on San
Francisco's Haight Street had
been featuring live reggae enter
tainment on an irregular basis
for a number of months. Sud
denly last July, Minnie found
that her modest, hand-written
"Reggae Tonight" sign was at
tracting hoards of customers
everytime she hung it in her
front window.
Minnie booked Desarmes and
his Reggae Blues Band to play at
her club on Thursday nights.

Since that time, reggae at
Minnie's has been standard fare
at least twice a week.
Different from disco
The club takes on a different
atmosphere when the reggae
beat floats throughout the room.
The floor is tightly packed, but
the scene is exuberant harmony.
The dancers move with a fluid
syncopated motion, much dif
ferent from the mechanical jerk
ing associated with the disco
beat.
A similar scene exists at the
Longbranch Club in Berkeley,
where a steady diet of reggae
music is fed to the clients, often
at a rate of four nights per week.
Desarmes attributes reggae's
popularity to the simplicity of
the music. "Unlike jazz, reggae
is easy to understand and enjoy.
Often, we use only three or four
chords.'
Mellow sounds
And as for dancing: "Reggae
rhythm is much less frenetic and
heavy than rock 'n roll. The
music is mellow; it makes you
want to relax and dance."
Desarmes notes that most Bay
Area reggae audiences are pre
dominantly young whites. How
ever, he fondly recalls a recent
reggae concert at the San Fran
cisco Main Library, where his
band played for a crowd ranging
in age from 20 to 80.
"The older people enjoyed us
the most. They were dancing all
night; we couldn't stop them."
Cornering the market
Perhaps no one in the Bay
Area has as much control over
reggae's exposure as Tony
Wright, a young Jamaican who
came to America about five years
ago, after having run a reggae
discotheque named
"Psychotown" in Kingston.
Two years ago, Wright started
a little-known reggae radio
broadcast on San Francisco's
community radio station,
KPOO-FM. Since last July, his
program has grown increas
ingly popular, and he now finds
himself as the reggae disc joc
key on three Bay Area radio sta
tions.
In addition, he runs the Mango
Disco, a mobile reggae disco
which Wright takes to various
nightclubs in the Bay Area, in
cluding the Can-Do. the
Longbranch and the Lake
Merced Lounge.
Standing about 5-foot-H. with

fair brown skin, Wright exudes
confidence. He speaks with a
lilting Jamaican accent that
lends credence to his opinion
ated comments.
Spreading the word
"I want to bring reggae music
to the people, so they can learn to
understand it,"he says.
When asked to comment on
the allegations by many music
critics that reggae is merely
primitive dance music, his re
sponse is characteristicallylofty,
yet forceful:
"He 'ooh knows not, 'und
knows 'dhat he knows not, 'ees a
chyld . . . teech 'eem.
"He 'ooh knows not, 'und
knows not 'dhat he knows not,
'ees a foohl . . . shun 'eem.
"He 'ooh knows, 'und knows
'dhat he knows, 'ees a wise
mahn . . . seeek "eem."
Selling the beat
Wright is dedicated to bring
ing to reggae music the popular
exposure and support he be
lieves it deserves in the Bay
Area. Together with partner
Ruel Mills, they share a small
storefront in San Francisco's
Fillmore district. This dingy of
fice is adorned with Jamaican
flags, zebra rugs, rattan furniture
and an "Accounting Made Easy"
handbook on the book shelf.
Wright and Mills established
an all-reggae record store called
"Kingston Records" 11 months
ago. They see their operation as
both educational and profitable.
"You can come to our store
and find out what reggae is all
about, mahn," savs Mills. "You
have other places 'that carry reg
gae records, but when you
leave, mahn, you walk out as ig
norant as when you walked in."
