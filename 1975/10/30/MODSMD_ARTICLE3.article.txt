# The 						musicâ€”from the roots up
## 
### 
by Alexander Leff and Perry Simon
"Jamaica has certain things about it that is
different, mahn," exclaims native Jamaican
and reggae disc jockey Tony Wright. "When
you hear the music, you begin to understand it.
It's a feeling mahn, it's a definite feeling."
Except for marijuana, the largest export of
the tropical island of Jamaica is reggae music.
Reggae is a potent mixture of dance music and
political protest. Born in the streets of Tren
chtown, the West Kingston slum, reggae has
been popularized throughout the world by the
classic underground film, The Harder They
Come, and by such musical artists as Bob Mar
ley and the Wailers, Toots and the Maytals, and
Jimmy Cliff.
The island sound has influenced many
mainland musicians, ranging from Paul Simon
and the Rolling Stones to Linda Ronstadt.
Jamaican terms such as ganja, dreadlocks,
rudeboys and Rastafarianism have been made,
if not into household words, at least into the
idiom of the musically knowledgeable.
"Reggae is roots music," states Tony Wright,
"real roots music." Ever since the West Indies
natives bred with black, slaves brought over
from Africa to work on the island's sugar plan
tations. the Carribbean has had a characteristic
music. The sound was a blend of lilting South
American melodies and insistent African
rythms.
In 1968, when the old Jamaican "rock
steady" rhythm sped up and the electric bass
became the lead instrument, reggae was born.
"Reggae is up the line of progress from all
Jamaican music." claims Wright, "just a
natural line of flow."
Music of the poor
Reggae has roots not only in the long history
of West Indies music butalso in the mass of
poor oppressed black Jamaicans. I'or reggae,
unlike other Carribean music, did not develop
on some clean white sand paradise of a beach
with 75-degree water and 75-degree air; rather,
il was invented in the stink ot the Trenchtovvn
slum, one of the worst pockets of poverty in the

Western Hemisphere. In Trenchtown whole
families live in cardboard shanties and the
populace's sewage, as well as its young men,
have nowhere else to be but in the streets.
Reggae music gained popularity among
Kingston's rudeboys, the petty criminals of
Trenchtown. Its lyrics speak of the pain, viol
ence, and danger that dwell in the slum. Reg
gae is rebel music; the anthem of a people
struggling to free themselves from political
and economic oppression.
The dominant theme in the culture of the
Trenchtown rudeboys is crime, marijuana and
Rastafarianism. The Rastafari movement is a
religious movement unique to Jamaica. Ras
tafarians are spiritually descended from the
followers of Marcus Carvey, an American
black separatist who was deported to his home
land. Jamaica, in 1927.
Ras Tafari crowded
Carvey at one time stated, "Look to Africa
when a black king shall be crowned." When in
19H0, an Ethiopian named Ras Tafari was
crowned Emperor Haile Selassie. King of
Kings, Lord of Lords and Conquering Lion of
the Tribe of Judah. a number of Garvey's fol
lowers decided that Selassie was the living
Cod.
Today's Rastafarian movement is very loose
in doctrine. Some disciples believe that repat
riation to Ethiopia is essential: they call
Jamaica "Babylon" and consders it merely a
temporary home. Some followers never cut
their hair and wear it in long, kinky locks
termed "dreadlocks."
Most reggae artists are Rastamen. including
Toots of the Maytals and Bob Marley of the
Wailers. Rastafarian doctrine and metaphor
pervade their works.
Ganja used freely
Marijuana and "ganja." as the potent
Jamaican variety is called on the island, is om
nipresent in the reggae scene.
Some Rastafarian sects believe that ganja is a
religious sacrament. "Ganja is not a drug." ex-
plains Tony Wright, "it is part of
the spiritual movement. Yes,
most Jamaican musicians do
smoke hebs."
Reggae first broke into the
American public eye in 1972
through the movie The Harder
They Come. This low-budget
film told the true story if Ivan, a
poor, unknown reggae singer
who is thwarted in his quest for
well-deserved stardom by the
rigged and oppressive Jamaican
music industry.
Its fame spread, and soon the
film developedan avid cult fol
lowing throughout the nation.
"The Harder They Come was a
real good movie, mahn," says
native Jamaican Leon Franks as
he takes on a ganja stick between
sets of the Longbranch club in
Berkeley. "It showed the music
and some of the hostility and
some of the love and some of the
pain and some of the together
ness about the music, you know.
Yeah, mahn, it not too much of
an acting movie. It's real peo
ple."
An all-reggae soundtrack of
The Harder They Come was re

leased in 1973. It featured songs
performed by Jimmy Cliff, Toots
and the Maytals and other top
reggae stars.
The Maytals, a three-man
singing group led by Toots Hib
bert, had their first West Coast
performance in San Francisco
last July. Toots is a slight, soft
spoken man with short hair and
a closely cropped beard, but on
stage at San Francisco's Winter
land, Hibbert led an ecstatic re
vival meeting which left the au
dience transfigured.
Backed by an energetic reggae
ensemble, the two Maytals spun
gorgeous, up-beat harmonies
around the lead vocals of Toots,
who is considered the greatest
reggae singer in the world. The
crowd went wild as the Maytals
launched into "Sweet and
Dandy," a number they per
formed in The Harder They
Come.
'Stones' of reggae
If Toots and the Maytals are
like the Beatles, happy and up
beat, then the other leading re
ggae band, Bob Marley and the
Wailers, are like the Rolling
Stones. The Wailers project a de

fiant and rebellious image; their
songs wallow in a darker view of
life.
Marley, who plaits hishairin
thedreadlock fashion, is so lean
that his face looks almost
cadaverous. He is not a melodic
vocalist or fluid dancer like
Toots; instead Marley stands
frozen, stage center, guitar in
hand. He chants his lyrics rather
than singing them and holds the
audience in his power like a
voodoo sorcerer.
The energy builds and sud
denly Marley explodes in a St.
Vitus dance; his movements
seem almost involuntary as arms
shoot out and dreadlocks fly.
Seconds later, Marley is again
transfixed, lost in a trance,
chanting his song.
Reggae imitators
As the popularity of reggae in
creased, mainland rock'n roll ar
tists began to flood Jamaica pick
ing up ideas for songs and using
Jamaican studio musicians to
back them up on records. Johnny
Nash recorded the first hit de
rived from reggae, "I Can See
Clearly Now" and went on to re
cord "Stir It Up," a Marley com

position.
Paul Simon recorded in
Jamaica, as did the Rolling
Stones, whose album "Goat's
Head Soup" was recorded en
tirely in Kingston. Their open
ing cut, "Dancing With Mr. D,"
especially shows the reggae in
fluence.
In fact, at a party given for the
Stones after their recent San
Francisco concert by promoter
Bill Graham, the entertainment
chosen was Toots and the Mayt
als.
Wright adds, "Reggae is a feel
ing, mahn ... a
tightness . . . Brothers and sister
who came together and play,
y'ah understand, y'ah can't im
itate it, y'ah can't learn it from a
book, mahn."

The movie The Harder They
Come used the rigged Jamaican
music industry as a microcosm
for the oppression of Third
World countries by developed
nations. Wright laments, "The
movie is true and it's still hap
pening now, because you got
your white jokers, your white
sharks, from the West Coast
down there in Jamaica. What
they're doing is destroying the
music world in Jamaica."
But reggae music has certainly
come on hard; whether it will
fall hard is anybody's guess. As
Franks rocks back in his chair
and sips a mai-tai. he mulls over
the rising popularity of the re
ggae scene. With an earnest look
in his eyes, he says, "We got to
hold on to roots, mahn; 'cause no
roots ... no reggae."

If Toots and the Maytals are
like the Beatles, happy and up

fiant and rebellious image; their
songs wallow in a darker view of

Marley, who plaits hishairin
thedreadlock fashion, is so lean
that his face looks almost
cadaverous. He is not a melodic
vocalist or fluid dancer like
Toots; instead Marley stands
frozen, stage center, guitar in
hand. He chants his lyrics rather
than singing them and holds the
audience in his power like a
voodoo sorcerer.
The energy builds and sud
denly Marley explodes in a St.

seem almost involuntary as arms
shoot out and dreadlocks fly.
Seconds later, Marley is again

Reggae imitators
As the popularity of reggae in
creased, mainland rock'n roll ar
tists began to flood Jamaica pick
ing up ideas for songs and using
Jamaican studio musicians to
back them up on records. Johnny
Nash recorded the first hit de
rived from reggae, "I Can See
Clearly Now" and went on to re
cord "Stir It Up," a Marley com

position.
Paul Simon recorded in
Jamaica, as did the Rolling
Stones, whose album "Goat's
Head Soup" was recorded en
tirely in Kingston. Their open
ing cut, "Dancing With Mr. D,"
especially shows the reggae in
fluence.
In fact, at a party given for the
Stones after their recent San
Francisco concert by promoter
Bill Graham, the entertainment
chosen was Toots and the Mayt
als.
Wright adds, "Reggae is a feel
ing, mahn ... a
tightness . . . Brothers and sister
who came together and play,
y'ah understand, y'ah can't im
itate it, y'ah can't learn it from a
book, mahn."

The movie The Harder They
Come used the rigged Jamaican
music industry as a microcosm
for the oppression of Third
World countries by developed
nations. Wright laments, "The
movie is true and it's still hap
pening now, because you got
your white jokers, your white
sharks, from the West Coast
down there in Jamaica. What
they're doing is destroying the
music world in Jamaica."
But reggae music has certainly
come on hard; whether it will
fall hard is anybody's guess. As
Franks rocks back in his chair
and sips a mai-tai. he mulls over
the rising popularity of the re
ggae scene. With an earnest look
in his eyes, he says, "We got to
hold on to roots, mahn; 'cause no
roots ... no reggae."

"Jamaica has certain things about it that is
different, mahn," exclaims native Jamaican
and reggae disc jockey Tony Wright. "When
you hear the music, you begin to understand it.
It's a feeling mahn, it's a definite feeling."
Except for marijuana, the largest export of
the tropical island of Jamaica is reggae music.
Reggae is a potent mixture of dance music and
political protest. Born in the streets of Tren
chtown, the West Kingston slum, reggae has
been popularized throughout the world by the
classic underground film, The Harder They
Come, and by such musical artists as Bob Mar
ley and the Wailers, Toots and the Maytals, and
Jimmy Cliff.
The island sound has influenced many
mainland musicians, ranging from Paul Simon
and the Rolling Stones to Linda Ronstadt.
Jamaican terms such as ganja, dreadlocks,
rudeboys and Rastafarianism have been made,
if not into household words, at least into the
idiom of the musically knowledgeable.
"Reggae is roots music," states Tony Wright,
"real roots music." Ever since the West Indies
natives bred with black, slaves brought over
from Africa to work on the island's sugar plan
tations. the Carribbean has had a characteristic
music. The sound was a blend of lilting South
American melodies and insistent African
rythms.
In 1968, when the old Jamaican "rock
steady" rhythm sped up and the electric bass
became the lead instrument, reggae was born.
"Reggae is up the line of progress from all
Jamaican music." claims Wright, "just a
natural line of flow."
Music of the poor
Reggae has roots not only in the long history
of West Indies music butalso in the mass of
poor oppressed black Jamaicans. I'or reggae,
unlike other Carribean music, did not develop
on some clean white sand paradise of a beach
with 75-degree water and 75-degree air; rather,
il was invented in the stink ot the Trenchtovvn
slum, one of the worst pockets of poverty in the

Western Hemisphere. In Trenchtown whole
families live in cardboard shanties and the
populace's sewage, as well as its young men,
have nowhere else to be but in the streets.
Reggae music gained popularity among
Kingston's rudeboys, the petty criminals of
Trenchtown. Its lyrics speak of the pain, viol
ence, and danger that dwell in the slum. Reg
gae is rebel music; the anthem of a people
struggling to free themselves from political
and economic oppression.
The dominant theme in the culture of the
Trenchtown rudeboys is crime, marijuana and
Rastafarianism. The Rastafari movement is a
religious movement unique to Jamaica. Ras
tafarians are spiritually descended from the
followers of Marcus Carvey, an American
black separatist who was deported to his home
land. Jamaica, in 1927.
Ras Tafari crowded
Carvey at one time stated, "Look to Africa
when a black king shall be crowned." When in
19H0, an Ethiopian named Ras Tafari was
crowned Emperor Haile Selassie. King of
Kings, Lord of Lords and Conquering Lion of
the Tribe of Judah. a number of Garvey's fol
lowers decided that Selassie was the living
Cod.
Today's Rastafarian movement is very loose
in doctrine. Some disciples believe that repat
riation to Ethiopia is essential: they call
Jamaica "Babylon" and consders it merely a
temporary home. Some followers never cut
their hair and wear it in long, kinky locks
termed "dreadlocks."
Most reggae artists are Rastamen. including
Toots of the Maytals and Bob Marley of the
Wailers. Rastafarian doctrine and metaphor
pervade their works.
Ganja used freely
Marijuana and "ganja." as the potent
Jamaican variety is called on the island, is om
nipresent in the reggae scene.
Some Rastafarian sects believe that ganja is a
religious sacrament. "Ganja is not a drug." ex-
plains Tony Wright, "it is part of
the spiritual movement. Yes,
most Jamaican musicians do
smoke hebs."
Reggae first broke into the
American public eye in 1972
through the movie The Harder
They Come. This low-budget
film told the true story if Ivan, a
poor, unknown reggae singer
who is thwarted in his quest for
well-deserved stardom by the
rigged and oppressive Jamaican
music industry.
Its fame spread, and soon the
film developedan avid cult fol
lowing throughout the nation.
"The Harder They Come was a
real good movie, mahn," says
native Jamaican Leon Franks as
he takes on a ganja stick between
sets of the Longbranch club in
Berkeley. "It showed the music
and some of the hostility and
some of the love and some of the
pain and some of the together
ness about the music, you know.
Yeah, mahn, it not too much of
an acting movie. It's real peo
ple."
An all-reggae soundtrack of
The Harder They Come was re

leased in 1973. It featured songs
performed by Jimmy Cliff, Toots
and the Maytals and other top
reggae stars.
The Maytals, a three-man
singing group led by Toots Hib
bert, had their first West Coast
performance in San Francisco
last July. Toots is a slight, soft
spoken man with short hair and
a closely cropped beard, but on
stage at San Francisco's Winter
land, Hibbert led an ecstatic re
vival meeting which left the au
dience transfigured.
Backed by an energetic reggae
ensemble, the two Maytals spun
gorgeous, up-beat harmonies
around the lead vocals of Toots,
who is considered the greatest
reggae singer in the world. The
crowd went wild as the Maytals
launched into "Sweet and
Dandy," a number they per
formed in The Harder They
Come.

Today's Rastafarian movement is very loose

termed "dreadlocks."

Marijuana and "ganja." as the potent
Jamaican variety is called on the island, is om
nipresent in the reggae scene.
Some Rastafarian sects believe that ganja is a
religious sacrament. "Ganja is not a drug." ex-
plains Tony Wright, "it is part of
the spiritual movement. Yes,
most Jamaican musicians do
smoke hebs."
Reggae first broke into the
American public eye in 1972
through the movie The Harder
They Come. This low-budget
film told the true story if Ivan, a
poor, unknown reggae singer
who is thwarted in his quest for
well-deserved stardom by the
rigged and oppressive Jamaican
music industry.
Its fame spread, and soon the
film developedan avid cult fol
lowing throughout the nation.
"The Harder They Come was a
real good movie, mahn," says
native Jamaican Leon Franks as
he takes on a ganja stick between
sets of the Longbranch club in
Berkeley. "It showed the music
and some of the hostility and
some of the love and some of the
pain and some of the together
ness about the music, you know.
Yeah, mahn, it not too much of
an acting movie. It's real peo
ple."
An all-reggae soundtrack of
The Harder They Come was re

leased in 1973. It featured songs
performed by Jimmy Cliff, Toots
and the Maytals and other top
reggae stars.
The Maytals, a three-man
singing group led by Toots Hib
bert, had their first West Coast
performance in San Francisco
last July. Toots is a slight, soft
spoken man with short hair and
a closely cropped beard, but on
stage at San Francisco's Winter
land, Hibbert led an ecstatic re
vival meeting which left the au
dience transfigured.
Backed by an energetic reggae
ensemble, the two Maytals spun
gorgeous, up-beat harmonies
around the lead vocals of Toots,
who is considered the greatest
reggae singer in the world. The
crowd went wild as the Maytals
launched into "Sweet and
Dandy," a number they per
formed in The Harder They
Come.
'Stones' of reggae
If Toots and the Maytals are
like the Beatles, happy and up
beat, then the other leading re
ggae band, Bob Marley and the
Wailers, are like the Rolling
Stones. The Wailers project a de

fiant and rebellious image; their
songs wallow in a darker view of
life.
Marley, who plaits hishairin
thedreadlock fashion, is so lean
that his face looks almost
cadaverous. He is not a melodic
vocalist or fluid dancer like
Toots; instead Marley stands
frozen, stage center, guitar in
hand. He chants his lyrics rather
than singing them and holds the
audience in his power like a
voodoo sorcerer.
The energy builds and sud
denly Marley explodes in a St.
Vitus dance; his movements
seem almost involuntary as arms
shoot out and dreadlocks fly.
Seconds later, Marley is again
transfixed, lost in a trance,
chanting his song.
Reggae imitators
As the popularity of reggae in
creased, mainland rock'n roll ar
tists began to flood Jamaica pick
ing up ideas for songs and using
Jamaican studio musicians to
back them up on records. Johnny
Nash recorded the first hit de
rived from reggae, "I Can See
Clearly Now" and went on to re
cord "Stir It Up," a Marley com

position.
Paul Simon recorded in
Jamaica, as did the Rolling
Stones, whose album "Goat's
Head Soup" was recorded en
tirely in Kingston. Their open
ing cut, "Dancing With Mr. D,"
especially shows the reggae in
fluence.
In fact, at a party given for the
Stones after their recent San
Francisco concert by promoter
Bill Graham, the entertainment
chosen was Toots and the Mayt

Wright adds, "Reggae is a feel
ing, mahn ... a
tightness . . . Brothers and sister
who came together and play,
y'ah understand, y'ah can't im
itate it, y'ah can't learn it from a

The movie The Harder They
Come used the rigged Jamaican
music industry as a microcosm
for the oppression of Third
World countries by developed
nations. Wright laments, "The
movie is true and it's still hap
pening now, because you got
your white jokers, your white

down there in Jamaica. What
they're doing is destroying the
music world in Jamaica."
But reggae music has certainly
come on hard; whether it will

hold on to roots, mahn; 'cause no
roots ... no reggae."
by Alexander Leff and Perry Simon
"Jamaica has certain things about it that is
different, mahn," exclaims native Jamaican
and reggae disc jockey Tony Wright. "When
you hear the music, you begin to understand it.
It's a feeling mahn, it's a definite feeling."
Except for marijuana, the largest export of
the tropical island of Jamaica is reggae music.
Reggae is a potent mixture of dance music and
political protest. Born in the streets of Tren
chtown, the West Kingston slum, reggae has
been popularized throughout the world by the
classic underground film, The Harder They
Come, and by such musical artists as Bob Mar
ley and the Wailers, Toots and the Maytals, and
Jimmy Cliff.
The island sound has influenced many
mainland musicians, ranging from Paul Simon
and the Rolling Stones to Linda Ronstadt.
Jamaican terms such as ganja, dreadlocks,
rudeboys and Rastafarianism have been made,
if not into household words, at least into the
idiom of the musically knowledgeable.
"Reggae is roots music," states Tony Wright,
"real roots music." Ever since the West Indies
natives bred with black, slaves brought over
from Africa to work on the island's sugar plan
tations. the Carribbean has had a characteristic
music. The sound was a blend of lilting South
American melodies and insistent African
rythms.
In 1968, when the old Jamaican "rock
steady" rhythm sped up and the electric bass
became the lead instrument, reggae was born.
"Reggae is up the line of progress from all
Jamaican music." claims Wright, "just a
natural line of flow."
Music of the poor
Reggae has roots not only in the long history
of West Indies music butalso in the mass of
poor oppressed black Jamaicans. I'or reggae,
unlike other Carribean music, did not develop
on some clean white sand paradise of a beach
with 75-degree water and 75-degree air; rather,
il was invented in the stink ot the Trenchtovvn
slum, one of the worst pockets of poverty in the

Western Hemisphere. In Trenchtown whole
families live in cardboard shanties and the
populace's sewage, as well as its young men,
have nowhere else to be but in the streets.
Reggae music gained popularity among
Kingston's rudeboys, the petty criminals of
Trenchtown. Its lyrics speak of the pain, viol
ence, and danger that dwell in the slum. Reg
gae is rebel music; the anthem of a people
struggling to free themselves from political
and economic oppression.
The dominant theme in the culture of the
Trenchtown rudeboys is crime, marijuana and
Rastafarianism. The Rastafari movement is a
religious movement unique to Jamaica. Ras
tafarians are spiritually descended from the
followers of Marcus Carvey, an American
black separatist who was deported to his home
land. Jamaica, in 1927.
Ras Tafari crowded
Carvey at one time stated, "Look to Africa
when a black king shall be crowned." When in
19H0, an Ethiopian named Ras Tafari was
crowned Emperor Haile Selassie. King of
Kings, Lord of Lords and Conquering Lion of
the Tribe of Judah. a number of Garvey's fol
lowers decided that Selassie was the living
Cod.
Today's Rastafarian movement is very loose
in doctrine. Some disciples believe that repat
riation to Ethiopia is essential: they call
Jamaica "Babylon" and consders it merely a
temporary home. Some followers never cut
their hair and wear it in long, kinky locks

"Jamaica has certain things about it that is
different, mahn," exclaims native Jamaican
and reggae disc jockey Tony Wright. "When
you hear the music, you begin to understand it.
It's a feeling mahn, it's a definite feeling."
Except for marijuana, the largest export of
the tropical island of Jamaica is reggae music.
Reggae is a potent mixture of dance music and
political protest. Born in the streets of Tren
chtown, the West Kingston slum, reggae has
been popularized throughout the world by the
classic underground film, The Harder They
Come, and by such musical artists as Bob Mar
ley and the Wailers, Toots and the Maytals, and
Jimmy Cliff.
The island sound has influenced many
mainland musicians, ranging from Paul Simon
and the Rolling Stones to Linda Ronstadt.
Jamaican terms such as ganja, dreadlocks,
rudeboys and Rastafarianism have been made,
if not into household words, at least into the
idiom of the musically knowledgeable.
"Reggae is roots music," states Tony Wright,
"real roots music." Ever since the West Indies
natives bred with black, slaves brought over
from Africa to work on the island's sugar plan
tations. the Carribbean has had a characteristic
music. The sound was a blend of lilting South
American melodies and insistent African
rythms.
In 1968, when the old Jamaican "rock
steady" rhythm sped up and the electric bass
became the lead instrument, reggae was born.
"Reggae is up the line of progress from all
Jamaican music." claims Wright, "just a
natural line of flow."
Music of the poor
Reggae has roots not only in the long history
of West Indies music butalso in the mass of
poor oppressed black Jamaicans. I'or reggae,
unlike other Carribean music, did not develop
on some clean white sand paradise of a beach
with 75-degree water and 75-degree air; rather,
il was invented in the stink ot the Trenchtovvn
slum, one of the worst pockets of poverty in the

Western Hemisphere. In Trenchtown whole
families live in cardboard shanties and the
populace's sewage, as well as its young men,
have nowhere else to be but in the streets.
Reggae music gained popularity among
Kingston's rudeboys, the petty criminals of
Trenchtown. Its lyrics speak of the pain, viol
ence, and danger that dwell in the slum. Reg
gae is rebel music; the anthem of a people
struggling to free themselves from political
and economic oppression.
The dominant theme in the culture of the
Trenchtown rudeboys is crime, marijuana and
Rastafarianism. The Rastafari movement is a
religious movement unique to Jamaica. Ras
tafarians are spiritually descended from the
followers of Marcus Carvey, an American
black separatist who was deported to his home
land. Jamaica, in 1927.
Ras Tafari crowded
Carvey at one time stated, "Look to Africa
when a black king shall be crowned." When in
19H0, an Ethiopian named Ras Tafari was
crowned Emperor Haile Selassie. King of
Kings, Lord of Lords and Conquering Lion of
the Tribe of Judah. a number of Garvey's fol
lowers decided that Selassie was the living
Cod.
Today's Rastafarian movement is very loose
in doctrine. Some disciples believe that repat
riation to Ethiopia is essential: they call
Jamaica "Babylon" and consders it merely a
temporary home. Some followers never cut
their hair and wear it in long, kinky locks
termed "dreadlocks."
Most reggae artists are Rastamen. including
Toots of the Maytals and Bob Marley of the
Wailers. Rastafarian doctrine and metaphor
pervade their works.
Ganja used freely
Marijuana and "ganja." as the potent
Jamaican variety is called on the island, is om
nipresent in the reggae scene.
Some Rastafarian sects believe that ganja is a
religious sacrament. "Ganja is not a drug." ex-
plains Tony Wright, "it is part of
the spiritual movement. Yes,
most Jamaican musicians do
smoke hebs."
Reggae first broke into the
American public eye in 1972
through the movie The Harder
They Come. This low-budget
film told the true story if Ivan, a
poor, unknown reggae singer
who is thwarted in his quest for
well-deserved stardom by the
rigged and oppressive Jamaican
music industry.
Its fame spread, and soon the
film developedan avid cult fol
lowing throughout the nation.
"The Harder They Come was a
real good movie, mahn," says
native Jamaican Leon Franks as
he takes on a ganja stick between
sets of the Longbranch club in
Berkeley. "It showed the music
and some of the hostility and
some of the love and some of the
pain and some of the together
ness about the music, you know.
Yeah, mahn, it not too much of
an acting movie. It's real peo
ple."
An all-reggae soundtrack of
The Harder They Come was re

leased in 1973. It featured songs
performed by Jimmy Cliff, Toots
and the Maytals and other top
reggae stars.
The Maytals, a three-man
singing group led by Toots Hib
bert, had their first West Coast
performance in San Francisco
last July. Toots is a slight, soft
spoken man with short hair and
a closely cropped beard, but on
stage at San Francisco's Winter
land, Hibbert led an ecstatic re
vival meeting which left the au
dience transfigured.
Backed by an energetic reggae
ensemble, the two Maytals spun
gorgeous, up-beat harmonies
around the lead vocals of Toots,
who is considered the greatest
reggae singer in the world. The
crowd went wild as the Maytals
launched into "Sweet and
Dandy," a number they per
formed in The Harder They
Come.
'Stones' of reggae
If Toots and the Maytals are
like the Beatles, happy and up
beat, then the other leading re
ggae band, Bob Marley and the
Wailers, are like the Rolling
Stones. The Wailers project a de

fiant and rebellious image; their
songs wallow in a darker view of
life.
Marley, who plaits hishairin
thedreadlock fashion, is so lean
that his face looks almost
cadaverous. He is not a melodic
vocalist or fluid dancer like
Toots; instead Marley stands
frozen, stage center, guitar in
hand. He chants his lyrics rather
than singing them and holds the
audience in his power like a
voodoo sorcerer.
The energy builds and sud
denly Marley explodes in a St.
Vitus dance; his movements
seem almost involuntary as arms
shoot out and dreadlocks fly.
Seconds later, Marley is again
transfixed, lost in a trance,
chanting his song.
Reggae imitators
As the popularity of reggae in
creased, mainland rock'n roll ar
tists began to flood Jamaica pick
ing up ideas for songs and using
Jamaican studio musicians to
back them up on records. Johnny
Nash recorded the first hit de
rived from reggae, "I Can See
Clearly Now" and went on to re
cord "Stir It Up," a Marley com

position.
Paul Simon recorded in
Jamaica, as did the Rolling
Stones, whose album "Goat's
Head Soup" was recorded en
tirely in Kingston. Their open
ing cut, "Dancing With Mr. D,"
especially shows the reggae in
fluence.
In fact, at a party given for the
Stones after their recent San
Francisco concert by promoter
Bill Graham, the entertainment
chosen was Toots and the Mayt
als.
Wright adds, "Reggae is a feel
ing, mahn ... a
tightness . . . Brothers and sister
who came together and play,
y'ah understand, y'ah can't im
itate it, y'ah can't learn it from a
book, mahn."

The movie The Harder They
Come used the rigged Jamaican
music industry as a microcosm
for the oppression of Third
World countries by developed
nations. Wright laments, "The
movie is true and it's still hap
pening now, because you got
your white jokers, your white
sharks, from the West Coast
down there in Jamaica. What
they're doing is destroying the
music world in Jamaica."
But reggae music has certainly
come on hard; whether it will
fall hard is anybody's guess. As
Franks rocks back in his chair

launched into "Sweet and
Dandy," a number they per
formed in The Harder They
Come.
'Stones' of reggae
If Toots and the Maytals are
like the Beatles, happy and up
beat, then the other leading re
ggae band, Bob Marley and the
Wailers, are like the Rolling
Stones. The Wailers project a de

fiant and rebellious image; their
songs wallow in a darker view of
life.
Marley, who plaits hishairin
thedreadlock fashion, is so lean
that his face looks almost
cadaverous. He is not a melodic
vocalist or fluid dancer like
Toots; instead Marley stands
frozen, stage center, guitar in
hand. He chants his lyrics rather
than singing them and holds the
audience in his power like a
voodoo sorcerer.
The energy builds and sud
denly Marley explodes in a St.
Vitus dance; his movements
seem almost involuntary as arms
shoot out and dreadlocks fly.
Seconds later, Marley is again
transfixed, lost in a trance,
chanting his song.
Reggae imitators
As the popularity of reggae in
creased, mainland rock'n roll ar
tists began to flood Jamaica pick
ing up ideas for songs and using
Jamaican studio musicians to
back them up on records. Johnny
Nash recorded the first hit de
rived from reggae, "I Can See
Clearly Now" and went on to re
cord "Stir It Up," a Marley com

position.
Paul Simon recorded in
Jamaica, as did the Rolling
Stones, whose album "Goat's
Head Soup" was recorded en
tirely in Kingston. Their open
ing cut, "Dancing With Mr. D,"
especially shows the reggae in
fluence.
In fact, at a party given for the
Stones after their recent San
Francisco concert by promoter
Bill Graham, the entertainment
chosen was Toots and the Mayt
als.
Wright adds, "Reggae is a feel
ing, mahn ... a
tightness . . . Brothers and sister
who came together and play,
y'ah understand, y'ah can't im
itate it, y'ah can't learn it from a
book, mahn."

The movie The Harder They
Come used the rigged Jamaican
music industry as a microcosm
for the oppression of Third
World countries by developed
nations. Wright laments, "The
movie is true and it's still hap
pening now, because you got
your white jokers, your white
sharks, from the West Coast
down there in Jamaica. What
they're doing is destroying the
music world in Jamaica."
But reggae music has certainly
come on hard; whether it will
fall hard is anybody's guess. As
Franks rocks back in his chair
and sips a mai-tai. he mulls over
the rising popularity of the re
ggae scene. With an earnest look
in his eyes, he says, "We got to
hold on to roots, mahn; 'cause no
roots ... no reggae."
