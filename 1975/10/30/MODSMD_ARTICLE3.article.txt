"Jamaica has certain things about it that is
different, mahn," exclaims native Jamaican
and reggae disc jockey Tony Wright. "When
you hear the music, you begin to understand it.
It's a feeling mahn, it's a definite feeling."
Except for marijuana, the largest export of
the tropical island of Jamaica is reggae music.
Reggae is a potent mixture of dance music and
political protest. Born in the streets of Tren
chtown, the West Kingston slum, reggae has
been popularized throughout the world by the
classic underground film, The Harder They
Come, and by such musical artists as Bob Mar
ley and the Wailers, Toots and the Maytals, and
Jimmy Cliff.
The island sound has influenced many
mainland musicians, ranging from Paul Simon
and the Rolling Stones to Linda Ronstadt.
Jamaican terms such as ganja, dreadlocks,
rudeboys and Rastafarianism have been made,
if not into household words, at least into the
idiom of the musically knowledgeable.
"Reggae is roots music," states Tony Wright,
"real roots music." Ever since the West Indies
natives bred with black, slaves brought over
from Africa to work on the island's sugar plan
tations. the Carribbean has had a characteristic
music. The sound was a blend of lilting South
American melodies and insistent African
rythms.
In 1968, when the old Jamaican "rock
steady" rhythm sped up and the electric bass
became the lead instrument, reggae was born.
"Reggae is up the line of progress from all
Jamaican music." claims Wright, "just a
natural line of flow."
Music of the poor
Reggae has roots not only in the long history
of West Indies music butalso in the mass of
poor oppressed black Jamaicans. I'or reggae,
unlike other Carribean music, did not develop
on some clean white sand paradise of a beach
with 75-degree water and 75-degree air; rather,
il was invented in the stink ot the Trenchtovvn
slum, one of the worst pockets of poverty in the

Western Hemisphere. In Trenchtown whole
families live in cardboard shanties and the
populace's sewage, as well as its young men,
have nowhere else to be but in the streets.
Reggae music gained popularity among
Kingston's rudeboys, the petty criminals of
Trenchtown. Its lyrics speak of the pain, viol
ence, and danger that dwell in the slum. Reg
gae is rebel music; the anthem of a people
struggling to free themselves from political
and economic oppression.
The dominant theme in the culture of the
Trenchtown rudeboys is crime, marijuana and
Rastafarianism. The Rastafari movement is a
religious movement unique to Jamaica. Ras
tafarians are spiritually descended from the
followers of Marcus Carvey, an American
black separatist who was deported to his home
land. Jamaica, in 1927.
Ras Tafari crowded
Carvey at one time stated, "Look to Africa
when a black king shall be crowned." When in
19H0, an Ethiopian named Ras Tafari was
crowned Emperor Haile Selassie. King of
Kings, Lord of Lords and Conquering Lion of
the Tribe of Judah. a number of Garvey's fol
lowers decided that Selassie was the living
Cod.
Today's Rastafarian movement is very loose
in doctrine. Some disciples believe that repat
riation to Ethiopia is essential: they call
Jamaica "Babylon" and consders it merely a
temporary home. Some followers never cut
their hair and wear it in long, kinky locks
termed "dreadlocks."
Most reggae artists are Rastamen. including
Toots of the Maytals and Bob Marley of the
Wailers. Rastafarian doctrine and metaphor
pervade their works.
Ganja used freely
Marijuana and "ganja." as the potent
Jamaican variety is called on the island, is om
nipresent in the reggae scene.
Some Rastafarian sects believe that ganja is a
religious sacrament. "Ganja is not a drug." ex-
