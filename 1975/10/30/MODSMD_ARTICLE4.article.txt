# Springsteen: before the mania hit
## 
### Gary Cohen 
It happened to Vail, Colo. To
the out islands of the Carribean.
They did it to Mocha Almond
Fudge. For a while Mocha Al
mond Fudge was one of the
flavors on the Baskin Robbins
master list that rarely appeared
on the top 31. Then it became a
regular. Now every time I enter
an ice cream store, Mocha Al
mond Fudge is the feature flavor.
It's happening to Bruce
Springsteen too. A little known
corollary of the Peter Principle
states that successful under
ground performersgrow increas
ingly popular. This popularity
causes massive changes in the
performer, which destroy that
performer's basic appeal.
Springsteen was never meant
to be another John Denver, and
perusing the newsstands lately,
one can't help but fear that Top
40 is around the corner.
The critical notice began with
a December 1972 review in the
"New Acts" section of Variety. It
was a rave. Tomorrow the "Jer
sey Jumping Jack" checks into
the Paramount Theatre in Oak
land for a one-night stand. The
subsequent weekend papers will
feature the same type of rave re
views, but for those who were
with him before, part of the
magic will have disappeared.
A phone call to Laurel Canyon
Music, Springsteen's corporate
pseudonym, didn't get through
to him as it would have in the
past. It got only as far as Mike
Appel, Bruce's manager:"Bruce
is still himself no matter how

many albums he sells." Not too
convincing.
Clearly ureal
There was never any doubt
that Springsteen was outstand
ing. His guitar work and piano
playing is only average. His
voice is abrasiveâ€”marked by the
same "sand and glue" quality
that made Dylan so distinctive.
Yet, Springsteen's strengths are
numerous.They lie in personal
characteristics.
He is a song stylist; the type of
singer who can make the same
words mean five different
things, depending upon his in
flection, and (when performing
live) on his acting. On the re
corded version of "Sandy", he
sings of angels descending from
heaven. The same line when per
formed live refers to the type of
Angels who ride Harleys. This is
typical of Springsteen.
His songs are less stories than
novels, the participants are less
characters than friends and lov
ers. Most of the recent stories on
him have quoted extensively

from his lyrics, which is tempt
ing but potentially misleading.
His lyrics are the basis of
whatever masterpieces Springs
teen has recorded on vinyl, but
others have made good albums
without becoming rock mes
siahs.
Awesome energy
He is an excellent studio per
former. but he is much better
live. His sheer energy creates a
totally absorbing atmosphere
and his stage presence is awe
some. When performing in a
club, he is liable, more often than
not. to take a jaunt across table
tops, crawling, staggering and
dancing to the rhythmic ap
plause he has initiated.
He dances on the amplifiers,
the piano and anything else he
can find. For his encores he often
marches up and down the aisles,
with saxman Clarence Clemons
and guitarist Miami Steve.
"The E Street Band is as far
ahead of the field as the Beatles
ever were," said manager Appel.

"It's too bad it's taken the public
so long to realize it."
The Springsteen explosion oc
cured in New York this August.
The fallout has just begun to hit
the rest of the nation. Springs
teen had not played New York in
a year, and the members of his
cult were itchy. The last album
was over a year-and-a-half old,
and all the rumors about the new
release were just that, rumors.
Rather than play two or three
shows to medium or large

crowds, Springsteen booked
into The Bottom Line, a night
club in Greenwich Village. He
and the band signed to do two
shows a night for five consecu
tive nights. Wednesday through
Sunday. Each show sold within
hours.
Bruce's career outlook is cer
tainly vastly different now than
it was four months ago, and for
most the change is for the better.
The rest will just have to learn to
live with it.
