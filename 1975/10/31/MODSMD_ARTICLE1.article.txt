# Provost's residence criticized

### WILLIAM ROSS 
Provost William Miller has drawn
fierce criticism from a source near the
administration for moving into a na
tionally famous house recently do
nated to the University.
"This is conspicuous ronsumption
at a time when we at the University are
supposed to be cutting back," the
source said. "Miller's moving into the
house was tasteless and showed bad
judgment. There is something unto
ward about the whole thing."
Emeritus Education Prof. Paul
Hanna donated Honeycomb House to
the University early this month, ex
pressing the hope that it could eventu
ally house visiting endowed profes
sors.
The source contended that the Uni
versity should either have housed un
endowed visiting professors in the
house or left it empty until the creation
of an endowment for visiting profes
sors.
There currently are no endowed pro
fessorships.
Ideal for Solzhenitsyn
He said the house would have been
an ideal residence for Honorary
Hoover Institution Fellow Alexandr
Solzhenitsyn during his next visit to
Stanford.
But President Richard Lyman exp
lained Tuesday on KZSU's Campus
Con/erence that leaving the house
empty seemed wasteful. Lyman said
the provost was chosen to move into
the house because it would enable him
to entertain on a larger scale than he
could in his former house.
The source, however, said he never
heard the University complain about
the inadequacy of Miller's house until
Honeycomb House was donated to
Stanford.
Lyman countered this statement by
saying that Miller's entertaining of
donors in the house will call attention
to the need to endow a visiting profes
sorship.
Unclear benefits
But the source said "the benefits to
the University (from Miller's residence
in the house) are not at all clear."
The source said Miller, the priority
setter for the five-year, $300 million
Campaign for Stanford, could enter
tain donors in the Lou Henry Hoover
House — Lyman's official residence —
or at the Faculty Club.
Miller told the Daily yesterday,
however, that "there are a great many
requests from visiting groups here
who want a setting different from the
Faculty Club."
The source also criticized the ad
ministrators' contentions that the
house was needed for entertaining
large donors. He contended that the
last two years of the Campaign for
Stanford are designed to attract small
gifts from persons who would not be
entertained on the campus.
But Miller said the University will

continue to solicit large donations
until the end of the campaign in 1977.
Asked if his former house was ade
quate for such entertaining, Miller re
plied that "not many houses are ade
quate for entertaining groups of 25 or
more persons."
The source said he was particularly
disturbed by the possibility that Miller
is profiting by the move by renting out
his former house at a large amount
without donating the rent to the Uni
versity.
"This is a surrogate form of salary,"
the source contended. "While other
people are suffering from frozen
salaries and other budget reductions,
Miller (may be) enjoying extra in
come."
Miller refused to comment on
whether he was renting out his former
house for personal gain.
'Personal questions'
"1 have long admired the fact that
the Daily and other campus publica

tions have had a policy of not asking
administrators personal questions,"
Miller said.
Lyman would not comment on
whether any financial gain by Miller
would be counted as part of his salary.
"Things such as this are sometimes
counted as an emolument," Lyman
said.
The source also contended that
since a precedent has been set for the
provost to occupy the house, future
provosts may also live in the house.
'Perversion of the gift'
"It may be hard to get rid of the pro
vosts once they have been in the
house," the source said. "It is a perver
sion of the gift."
But Lyman noted that Hanna has
said he is glad the provost will occupy
the house.
Hanna was unavailable for com
ment.
Miller noted that at most major pri
vate universities, the provost has an
official residence.
