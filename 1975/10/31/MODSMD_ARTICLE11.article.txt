# Ford cultivating pro-Batista Cubans
## 
### 
In a little noticed move, President Ford
two months ago appointed Ricardo Nunez
to head the Cuban Refugee Program, a $1
billion federal project to resettle Cuban re
fugees.
The appointment is highly significant as
an indication that Ford plans to follow
Richard Nixon's lead in supporting the
pro-Batista wing of the Cuban community.
Generalissimo Juan Batista, the former
Cuban dictator whose alliance with Ameri
can gangsters was vividly portrayed in
Godfather 11, fell from power in 1959, but
his former compatriots still exercise their
influence in this country.
Nunez's father served both as prime
minister and United Nations ambassador
under Batista. Nunez himself is a multimil
lionaire Republican.
Even other Cuban-American Republicans
object that "this is a 100 percent political
appointment made to collect money for the
1976 Presidential campaign." They are
concerned that Nunez is "totally unqual
ified" for the job, according tothe-New York
Times.
Gramco VP
Nunez made his fortune as vice president
in charge of Latin American sales for
Gramco, a now defunct Bahamas invest
ment fund owned by Robert Vesco. Vesco is
the Nixon campaign contributor now under
indictment for massive fraud and conspi
racy.
Nunez's operations became controversial
when his salesmen were arrested through
out Latin America for illegal, covert sales of
Gramco bonds.
Meanwhile, Nunez's family company,
NBS Development Inc.. faces a dozen law
suits totalling over $1 million for alleged
non-payment for building materials and
services.
Most intriguing of all, Nunez admits to
having joined in 1961 a top secret CIA prog
ram headed by his uncle, Joaquin Sangenis.
Sangenis, according to the Miami Herald,
received a secret CIA medal in 1972.
Operation 40
At the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion,
when Nunez joined Operation 40, Sangenis

was head of the "Cuban CIA." a CIA politi
cal clique in the anti-Castro Cuban com
munity. Operation 40 was the ClA's plan to
set up a pro-Batista civil-military govern
ment and intelligence system immediately
after Castro's hoped-for downfall following
the Bay of Pigs invasion.

According to two journalists, "the project
included a hand-picked task force of profes
sional killers who were to eliminate obdu
rate elements which might oppose a return
to the good old days." One of the killers was
Ramon Calvino, a top Batista "police tor
turer."
Following the Bay of Pigs failure,
Sangenis retained a 200-man core group
which, under CIA auspices, he molded into
a $2 million a year counterintelligence and
special operations unit for insuring total
CIA control over the Cuban refugee com
munity.
The CIA finally withdrew support in
1970, when it could no longer hide the fact
that the group was covering for one of
America's largest cocaine smuggling rings.
One of Sangenis's operatives, a former
member of the Cuban legislature under
Batista, apparently led the ring.
Bebe Rebozo
Prominent Cuban-Americans charge, ac
cording to the New York Times, that Nunez
is also overly close to have none other than
Bebe Rebozo, Nixon's close friend. Rebozo
who was caught up in the Watergate scan
dals when he was exposed as a conduit for
massive illegal campaign contributions to

Nixon.
In November 1970, one of Rebozo's busi
ness partners, Eduardo Buttari, became
Special Assistant to the Director of the
Cuban Refugee Emergency Program, to
which Nunez has now been appointed di
rector. Buttari was Mayor of Havana and
Minister of Labor and the Treasury, in his
Cuba days, offices intimately linked to the
world of right-wing politics and organized
crime that Batista represented.
Buttari got the job by heading Cubans for
Nixon in 1968. He was also a partner with
Rebozo in the Centro Commercial Cubano, a
shopping center financed by U.S. govern
ment loans and constructed by "Big Al"
Polizzi. Polizzi has since been named in
Senate testimony as a top member of the
Cleveland Syndicate which invested heav
ily in Cuban gambling casinos under
Batista.
Cocaine smuggling
Buttari brought to El Centro his business
associates, Francisco and Ronald
Condom-Gil, who were later convicted for
heading a massive cocaine smuggling ring.
Buttari is also close to millionaire meat
importer Manuel Artime, leader of the Bay
of Pigs invasion. Artime worked on the in
vasion plans with CIA/Watergate figure E.
Howard Hunt, and credits Bernard Barker,
the Watergate burglarand one-time√üastista
police agent, with saving his life in 1960.
With aid from Hunt and Barker, Artime
organized another unsuccessful attempt to
invade Cuba in 1965. More recently, Artime
distributed hush money to the families of
Watergate defendants.
None of this should even imply that
Nunez is involved in anything criminal.
Rather, his appointment in place ofamore
qualified welfare administrator reflects
Ford's decision to cultivate the right-wing,
pro-Batista milieu in "Little Havana."
In so doing, he is affirming the political
strategy of Eisenhower's Bay of Pigs inva
sion planner, Richard Nixon.
