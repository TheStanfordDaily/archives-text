# Examine new presidential candidates
## 
### 
For those who find the present
Democratic presidential contest
confusing and unpromising, it is
useful to compare the state of
this national campaign with that
four years ago.
As 1972 approached, a cruel
war was still being waged by this
country in Southeast Asia.
The country was still torn by
deep and bitter divisions and
lost in direction. In the White
House was a widely distrusted
and supremely cynical Presi
dent, gearing up for re-election
at any price.
Democrats of many shades
were hopeful and excited. The
moderated and office-holders
saw in Edmund Muskie a Lin
colnesque figure capable of de
feating Nixon and uniting the
country.
McGovern figure
Activists of the party's left saw
in George McGovern a commit
ted idealist, an almost messianic
figure, who would capture the
nation's priorities and social
structure.
And the angry and alienated
Southern and blue collar voters
saw in George Wallace an effec
tive symbol to "send them a
message" about their economic
racial and social grievances.
Passions were strong and
powerfully shaped the results.
Passionately committed volun
teers and contributors made pos
sible the stunning showing of

McGovern in New Hampshire,
and the subsequent primary vic
tories.
Passionately angry voters gave
George Wallace more primary
votes than any other Democrat.
And the bullet of a passionate
and demented young man crip
pled Wallace for life.
Cynical intentions
A network of over-passionate
and ambitious men, motivated
by the most cynical of inten
tions, also helped make possible
the stunning McGovern vic
tories and in other ways wove
the most heinous political scan
dal in the nation's history.
As was the case with the ap
proach of the 1968 elections, the
most intense emotions were be
coming focused like a beam from
a laser gun on the campaign for
the Presidency.
Things are duller now. and it
may be a blessing for the coun
try.
The divisions remain, but
have been soothed and blurred
by time and events.
The paranoid cynic of a Presi
dent has been replaced by a hack
congressman who can, if no
thing else, be trusted to play
within the rules of the game and
not send burglars after us in the
night.
Low-key campaigns
And the highstrung emotional
crusade of McGovern has been

replaced by several more or less
low-key campaigns.
The response from the party's
activists to these campaigns has
been, in many areas, lethargic at
best. Echoed in columns and
caucuses across the country has
been the common conviction
that the election looks hopeless,
that we of the party's left have
been cursed with a mercilessly
long string of unexciting, unin
spiring and undistinguished
also-rans.
That the criss-crossing floods
of passion have subsided is a for
tunate thing for the country and
the Democratic Party. Neither
was able to withstand such in
tense division very well.
Now, the more sober mood of
both offers the possibility of a
more reasoned and carefully
considered decision than has
often been the case with this
most crucial of all our political
questions: who shall lead us?
Widespread apathy
That these criss-crossing pas
sions have been replaced by
widespread apathy toward the
present crop of liberal candi
dates is not only unfortunate, but
manifestly unfair. There are no
messiahs among the group, no
men or women on white horses
(no women at all, in fact).
But there are several able men,
earnest, thoughtful about the is
sues and committed to certain
ideals and new directions for the
country.

Larry Diamond
Such candidates as Morris
Udall, Jimmy Carter, Fred Har
ris. Birch Bayh, Sargent Shriver,
Terry Sanford (and perhaps
Frank Church soon) all have
something unique to offer.
While they have clear limita
tions in national stature, public
accomplishment, political base
and charismaticappeal, each has
enough promise about him to
warrant a closer look than most
of us have been willing to pay.
More sensitive
Any of them, without ques
tion, would be a much more sen
sitive and able President than
Gerald Ford.
One or more of them might
have that special ability toset the
country on a new direction and
gather the national resources
and support to pursue it that dis
tinguishes the exceptional
leader.
Such cursory glances as we
have so far been willing to give
can certainly not establih other
wise.
What is now happening in the
Democratic Party is something
called democracy, something
very close to the ideal of how the
system is supposed to work.
The candidates are coming
forward and presenting their
character and beliefs, seeking
our help.
