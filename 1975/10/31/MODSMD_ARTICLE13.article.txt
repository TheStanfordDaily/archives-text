Hunger awareness
Editor:
What do you remember about
last April's Food Day?
If you participated in the
campus-wide fast, undoubtably
it's that gut feeling of hunger. It
should be more than that. . . .
Although last year's Rome In
ternational Food Conference and
hunger-related events have
come and gone, the problem of
world hunger, has not.
Of the four billion people on
this earth,sopercent are afflicted
by some nutritional deficiency.
Some 460 million
of these people are "starving" —
i.e., severely malnourished or
undernourished — and the rest
are chronically hungry.
"So what can I do about it?"
one may ask. As with any prob
lem there are several levels of in
volvement, but the first step is
awareness.
That is what Nov. 24, Na
tional Day of Fasting, is all
about. To be made aware that the
average U.S. citizen consumes
2000 pounds of grain per year
directly through animal pro
ducts or indirectly through cere
als and breadstuff's, where the
average Asian eats 400 pounds
of grain a year and little else.
To be made aware that mal
nutritin causes irreversible brain
damage in infants. Finally, to be
made aware that the minor dis
comfort one experiences for a
day is a reality half the people of
the world face everyday.
Monday, Nov. 24, we
hope to have a campus-wide fast
a well as films, slideshows,
music and discussion to make
people aware, as well as clarify
their feelings toward the issue
and what should be done about
it.

Indian pride
Editor:
Once more the subject of the
Indian was laid to rest, but his
ghost is ever present. Will there
ever come a time when he will be
allowed to completely disap
pear? Maybe not.
It is my belief that those who
keep turning tothe idea of restor
ing the Indian mascot do not
completely understand the ar
guments behind why the mascot
was scrapped. For many of the
students who are here now were
not present when the actual con
troversy over the mascot took
place.
The main point of controversy
was that the mascot was de
rogatory to Natives Americans at
Stanford (and other places as
well).
The argument that we should
see the mascot as a symbol of
pride was and will no doubt con
tinue to be supported. Hut I do
not believe that is what Stanford
University had in mind for Na
tive Americans when the mascot
was first initiated.
How can om'know what pride
means to another ethnic group,
especially when one has very
limited contact with that group?
We are proud of being Indians,
but we do not vest our pride in
being a "mascot" for another
group of people.
Such vulgarities should be li
mited to non-humans.
And for the Native Americans
who were here in 1971-72, the
elmination of the mascot was a
long hard fight.
I hope that nostalgia for the
long-gone "Indian" does not get
the best of what little bit of re
spect the University and others
have chosen to show for the Na
tive Americans by eliminating
the mascot.

Indian pride
Editor:
Once more the subject of the
Indian was laid to rest, but his
ghost is ever present. Will there
ever come a time when he will be
allowed to completely disap
pear? Maybe not.
It is my belief that those who
keep turning tothe idea of restor
ing the Indian mascot do not
completely understand the ar
guments behind why the mascot
was scrapped. For many of the
students who are here now were
not present when the actual con
troversy over the mascot took
place.
The main point of controversy
was that the mascot was de
rogatory to Natives Americans at
Stanford (and other places as
well).
The argument that we should
see the mascot as a symbol of
pride was and will no doubt con
tinue to be supported. Hut I do
not believe that is what Stanford
University had in mind for Na
tive Americans when the mascot
was first initiated.
How can om'know what pride
means to another ethnic group,
especially when one has very
limited contact with that group?
We are proud of being Indians,
but we do not vest our pride in
being a "mascot" for another
group of people.
Such vulgarities should be li
mited to non-humans.
And for the Native Americans
who were here in 1971-72, the
elmination of the mascot was a
long hard fight.
I hope that nostalgia for the
long-gone "Indian" does not get
the best of what little bit of re
spect the University and others
have chosen to show for the Na
tive Americans by eliminating
the mascot.

Hunger awareness
Editor:
What do you remember about
last April's Food Day?
If you participated in the
campus-wide fast, undoubtably
it's that gut feeling of hunger. It
should be more than that. . . .
Although last year's Rome In
ternational Food Conference and
hunger-related events have
come and gone, the problem of
world hunger, has not.
Of the four billion people on
this earth,sopercent are afflicted
by some nutritional deficiency.
Some 460 million
of these people are "starving" —
i.e., severely malnourished or
undernourished — and the rest
are chronically hungry.
"So what can I do about it?"
one may ask. As with any prob
lem there are several levels of in
volvement, but the first step is
awareness.
That is what Nov. 24, Na
tional Day of Fasting, is all
about. To be made aware that the
average U.S. citizen consumes
2000 pounds of grain per year
directly through animal pro
ducts or indirectly through cere
als and breadstuff's, where the
average Asian eats 400 pounds
of grain a year and little else.
To be made aware that mal
nutritin causes irreversible brain
damage in infants. Finally, to be
made aware that the minor dis
comfort one experiences for a
day is a reality half the people of
the world face everyday.
Monday, Nov. 24, we
hope to have a campus-wide fast
a well as films, slideshows,
music and discussion to make
people aware, as well as clarify
their feelings toward the issue
and what should be done about
it.

Charge disputed
Editor: '
I would appreciate it very
much if the Daily would print a
correction of a factual error that
appeared in the Oct. 30 article
headlined "Profs overcharge
federal agencies."
The article refers to "three
full-time engineering profes
sors," and in other places hangs
the whole affair on the School of
Engineering. To the best of my
knowledge only one
engineering professor was in
volved.
I know nothing about the other
two except for the fact that they
were not in the School of En
gineering.

Dean, School of Engineering
(Editor's note: The Daily
based its report on interviews
with two sources, one in the En
gineering Department. We pres
ently ore attempting to learn the
names of the three professors.
Until such time as further infor
mation contradicts bur report,
the Daily stands by its story./
