# Expansion to continue
## Transition shrugs off fire 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
There'll never be a marquis* outside the
Transition, declaring "Over 17 billion served."
But in the last year, the Transition has doubled
its share of the fast food market usually cor
nered by institutions like McDonald's.
A fire that broke out last Saturday evening in
the Transition's deep fat fryer "may slow
things down, but it won't stop our plans for
expansion," Food Services Director Bob
Caselli said.
Future expansion will include adding a full
soda fountain, and hot Hofbrau type sand
wiches, Caselli noted.
Already though, the Transition has come a
long way from its opening last Fall, when it
was strictly a "fries and hamburgers" opera
tion. And not a very successful one at that.
There were numerous complaints from patrons
about the food.
"When they first started, the food was pretty
terrible," senior Steve Taylor recalled. Caselli
said "We're getting a lot of compliments now,
but there was a time when if a student said
nothing, that was a compliment."
In the red
Not surprisingly, Transition lost money
its first year. But the deficit came to only
$12,000, far less than the $100,000 predicted,
according to Tresidder Union Director Dan
Williams.

Sizeable sales increases brightened the pic
ture. This September, Williams said, sales
were up 117 percent from the same time last
year.
"A lot of this is due to extra variety." he said.
"Last year, a marketing survey showed there
was a low return level. People were eating
there only once a week. Now, we've increased
the menu, so people can eat there more often,
without getting tired of the food."
Additional offerings introduced in the past
year have included pizza, more types of ham
burgers, freshly prepared soup, and some
"health foods."
Before the fire, the spacious dining area was
actually crowded during noontime. Even dur
ing the past week, with limited hot food avail
able, the Transition was far fuller than last
year.
Students in kitchen
There's also been a shift towards students
doing kitchen work. "We've got about 60 stu
dents employed part-time, and only four full
time workers, Caselli said. "Students'
schedules are more flexible." Students are also
paid less than fulltime employes, starting at
$2.25 an hour.
But all this financial wizardry would be
wasted if the food weren't at least passable.
And although even Ray Kroc would admit that
fast food is hardly ever good food, most stu

dents eating at the Transition aren't complain
ing' . , . i
"By and large, this is better than any food
service I've seen," lohn Timpane, a first year
graduate student said. "The hamburgers are
especially good, although there aren't enough
other choices on the menu."
Expensive hamburgers
"The food's pretty good, but I can't afford to
eat here too often," senior Sheila Taylor said.
The Transition hamburgers are slightly
larger than a Big Mac. and run at least 30 cents
higher. Generally, Williams said, Tresidder re
tail outlets "don't have a high enough turnover
to match the prices of large chains."
A former employe, who asked not to be
named, stated "I know the management has
been working really hard to improve the food,
but they're on the wrong track. The place has
got bad vibes; people here are so tense." A few
other patrons registered mild complaints about
the metal and formica decor
The Transition does cater to the eat-and-run
crowd, although some graduate students with
out meal plans say they would like to see the
Transition offer multi-course dinners. "I'd be
willing to pay more if 1 could get a dinner on
campus like the kind you find in restaurants,"
one tourth-vear grad student said.
But it looks like the Encina Commons
cafeteria is going to be the closest thing to what
these students have in mind. "There's no
reason to believe we'll ever go back to a full
menu cafeteria," Williams said. "It's just too
expensive labor-wise."
Damage from Saturday's fire appears to have
been more extensive than original estimates,
Williams said. "It'll take about two more weeks
to get structurally back together," Caselli said.
"The main waterline burst, and the power lines
burnt out."
Sales will drop dramatically, as the Transi
tion operates at half-speed while recovering
from the fire. But all repairs will be paid by a
self-insurance plan the University maintains
for the Transition, Williams said.
So the fire is unlikely to negate the
Transition's improvements in the last year.
Gourmet food or McDonald's size profits aren't
going to be coming to the Transition. But the
"greasy spoon" image and the massive deficits
appear to be gone.
