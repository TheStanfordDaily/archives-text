Stanford admits transfer students in the
same manner it conducts all its activities —in
a big way.
Despite the fact that few incoming freshmen
fail to graduate, nearly a fifth of the student
body is composed of transfers.
The reason for admitting so many transfers is
a logical one — to maintain a steady number of
undergraduates on campus at any given time.
The figure currently aimed for is 6475.
In the past, the University has been able to
admit about 400 transfer students each year.
These spaces were open because students took
time off and went overseas.
However, this year that number was pared
almost in half, to about 230.
According to Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon, the number admitted was reduced
primarily because of three considerations.
Fewer people were taking quarters off, more
old students were returning to campus and the
past two freshman classes have been larger
than expected, he said.
High quality students
A worry of many, however, is that transfers
are of inferior quality in relation to students
admitted as freshmen.
However, Hargadon states that those who
transfer to Stanford are at least equal in ability
to other students. And he notes that if transfer
spaces are available but none of the applicants
is considered to meet the qualifications, the
transfer class will be left unfilled.
A special consideration which had to be
made for this year's transfer students was the
number of housing spaces available. Although
the Guaranteed Housing Plan instituted last
spring states that transfers are to be assured
first-year housing, the Housing Office did not
know whether that part could be fulfilled for a
number of years.
However as it turned out. "all transfer stu
dents that applied for housing could have re
ceived it, if we received the application by
Aug. 25," said Karen Murray, who was in
charge of transfer orientation. "We only
realized in late July that we would be able to
house all who wanted it."
Some 181 transfers were actually assigned
housing as of Oct. 14, said Murray.
Another change from previous years was an
expanded transfer orientation program —
something most transfers lauded.
Effective orientation
"The transfer orientation program was very
effective." said sophomore Dave Judelson. "It

helped you meet people and become familiar
with the campus, without giving you the feel
ing of being a tourist on a sightseeing tour."
Stated sophomore Scott Schwimer: "The
transfer program was excellent. Socially, I was
able to establish friendships that were fostered
by the enthusiasm of this program."
However, there were a few criticisms.
Many students complained that registration
materials arrived very late or didn't a;rive at
all. Another common complaint was that the
Admissions Office should set a date by which
all transfers are notified of their accep
tance.
