# New radical bloc the largest
## Power groups emerge in ASSU Senate 
### JACK VAUGHN 
The bearded man at the chairman's desk
threw his hands up in amused bewilderment
over a facetious request from a member. "The
Senate can do anything it wants," he shrugged.
But he cautioned that it must "attend to its job
seriously" if it wants the respect of students
and Administration.

The voice of authority came from newly
elected ASSU Senate Chairman William Hoke.
His year on the Senate and knowledge of its
procedures gave him an initial advantage in
leading the largely inexperienced body meet
ing for the first time Tuesday.
But in the coming months the Senate will
decide-for itself what its "wants" are on issues
of ASSU and University policy and on internal
questions of the Senate's own power structure.
The makeup of the Senate does not suggest a
smooth road toward consensus. Speculation
prior to Tuesday's meeting centered on the
ability of the one organized group, the Stu
dents Taking a New Direction (STAND) slate,
to persuade other Senators to support STAND
member Elizabeth Larkam for chairman.
Other STAND members are Sara Alfadl.
Laura Best, Timothy Cullinane. kell\ Thomp
son and William Tvndall.
The bulk of the body, however, coalesced
around Hoke, leaving Larkam in the deputy
chairmanship and dashing the hopes of Brad
Krevoy. who said he ran for the Senate as a
fallback position in case "things didn't go
right" in his quest for the chair.
STAND still stands
STAND'S initial setback by no means re
moved it as a center of power in the Senate. Six
Senators are STAND members, and in a body in
which decisions are often made with IB votes
cast, such a unified group need only persuade
two or three other members to win.
The STAND group has been characterized as

the "radical" faction of this year's Senate. Its
platform asserts that members "share a basic
discontent over the distribution of power in the
University." In practical terms. STAND favors
lobbying, negotiating and perhaps even con
fronting the University on matters such as
publicly-announced budget priorities,
SWOPS I and SCIRE funding, affirmative ac
tion and tenure.
STAND'S "opposition" in the Senate is less
solidified but more experienced. I-ed by Senate
veterans Kevin McDermott and Tim Conway,
this coalition of fraternity men, conservative
graduate students and others has stressed
ASSU-funded student services and the hous
ing problem in its members' campaigns.
Major issues lie ahead
The Senate has much work ahead of it.
Besides quarreling with the University on
parking, extradepartmental programs such as
SWOPS! and SCIRE, increased housing, affir
mative action and possibly the selection of a
commencement speaker, the Senate will be
spending a good deal of time dividing up its
own "pie."
Financial Manager Chris Cline reported a
$3582 ASSU budget reserve on Tuesday,
money special programs will be fighting for
throughout the year.
Before the Senate can take on a "student
advocacy" role, however, it must decide who
its advocates will be. This has led. in nomina
tions for student members of the Subcommit
tee on Residences of the Committee on Student

Services (COSS). to a struggle between the Se
nate and the semi-autonomous Committee on
Nominations.
Last spring the Senate refused to confirm
three nominations to the COSS subcommittee
because the Nominations Committee had not
placed either a fraternity member or a graduate
student among the nominees.
It asked the Nominations Committee to find
of each.
Apathetic graduates
On Tuesday. ASSIJ Vice President DaveCal
ligan, aii' \ officio member of the Nominations
Committee, reported to the Senate that the
committee had found a fraternity member,
Tom Perry from Kappa Alpha, but said that "no
graduate students applied" for the COSS post.
McDermott replied that the Nominations
Committee should have tried some "affirma
tive action" and "recruited" a graduate stu
dent. Conway said the Nominations Commit
tee should have done "as it was directed" by
the Senate. He suggested to Calligan that the
Nominations Committee "give what we ask
for."
The Senate rejected Calligan's report and
sent the committee back to hunt for a graduate
student, along with some tips on where to find
one. But until one is found, there will be no
Subcommittee on Residences. There will be no
"student voice" on housing.
In the middle of this stands Hoke, whose
opening-night geniality is likely to be severely
tested in the months to come.

STAND still stands
STAND'S initial setback by no means re
moved it as a center of power in the Senate. Six
Senators are STAND members, and in a body in
which decisions are often made with IB votes
cast, such a unified group need only persuade
two or three other members to win.
The STAND group has been characterized as

the "radical" faction of this year's Senate. Its
platform asserts that members "share a basic
discontent over the distribution of power in the
University." In practical terms. STAND favors
lobbying, negotiating and perhaps even con
fronting the University on matters such as
publicly-announced budget priorities,
SWOPS I and SCIRE funding, affirmative ac
tion and tenure.
STAND'S "opposition" in the Senate is less
solidified but more experienced. I-ed by Senate
veterans Kevin McDermott and Tim Conway,
this coalition of fraternity men, conservative
graduate students and others has stressed
ASSU-funded student services and the hous
ing problem in its members' campaigns.
Major issues lie ahead
The Senate has much work ahead of it.
Besides quarreling with the University on
parking, extradepartmental programs such as
SWOPS! and SCIRE, increased housing, affir
mative action and possibly the selection of a
commencement speaker, the Senate will be
spending a good deal of time dividing up its
own "pie."
Financial Manager Chris Cline reported a
$3582 ASSU budget reserve on Tuesday,
money special programs will be fighting for
throughout the year.
Before the Senate can take on a "student
advocacy" role, however, it must decide who
its advocates will be. This has led. in nomina
tions for student members of the Subcommit
tee on Residences of the Committee on Student

Services (COSS). to a struggle between the Se
nate and the semi-autonomous Committee on
Nominations.
Last spring the Senate refused to confirm
three nominations to the COSS subcommittee
because the Nominations Committee had not
placed either a fraternity member or a graduate
student among the nominees.
It asked the Nominations Committee to find
of each.
Apathetic graduates
On Tuesday. ASSIJ Vice President DaveCal
ligan, aii' \ officio member of the Nominations
Committee, reported to the Senate that the
committee had found a fraternity member,
Tom Perry from Kappa Alpha, but said that "no
graduate students applied" for the COSS post.
McDermott replied that the Nominations
Committee should have tried some "affirma
tive action" and "recruited" a graduate stu
dent. Conway said the Nominations Commit
tee should have done "as it was directed" by
the Senate. He suggested to Calligan that the
Nominations Committee "give what we ask
for."
The Senate rejected Calligan's report and
sent the committee back to hunt for a graduate
student, along with some tips on where to find
one. But until one is found, there will be no
Subcommittee on Residences. There will be no
"student voice" on housing.
In the middle of this stands Hoke, whose
opening-night geniality is likely to be severely
tested in the months to come.


William Hoke
The bearded man at the chairman's desk
threw his hands up in amused bewilderment
over a facetious request from a member. "The
Senate can do anything it wants," he shrugged.
But he cautioned that it must "attend to its job
seriously" if it wants the respect of students
and Administration.

The voice of authority came from newly
elected ASSU Senate Chairman William Hoke.
His year on the Senate and knowledge of its
procedures gave him an initial advantage in
leading the largely inexperienced body meet
ing for the first time Tuesday.
But in the coming months the Senate will
decide-for itself what its "wants" are on issues
of ASSU and University policy and on internal
questions of the Senate's own power structure.
The makeup of the Senate does not suggest a
smooth road toward consensus. Speculation
prior to Tuesday's meeting centered on the
ability of the one organized group, the Stu
dents Taking a New Direction (STAND) slate,
to persuade other Senators to support STAND
member Elizabeth Larkam for chairman.
Other STAND members are Sara Alfadl.
Laura Best, Timothy Cullinane. kell\ Thomp

SWOPS! and SCIRE, increased housing, affir
mative action and possibly the selection of a
commencement speaker, the Senate will be
spending a good deal of time dividing up its
own "pie."
Financial Manager Chris Cline reported a
$3582 ASSU budget reserve on Tuesday,
money special programs will be fighting for
throughout the year.
Before the Senate can take on a "student
advocacy" role, however, it must decide who
its advocates will be. This has led. in nomina
tions for student members of the Subcommit
tee on Residences of the Committee on Student

Services (COSS). to a struggle between the Se
nate and the semi-autonomous Committee on
Nominations.
Last spring the Senate refused to confirm
three nominations to the COSS subcommittee
because the Nominations Committee had not
placed either a fraternity member or a graduate
student among the nominees.
It asked the Nominations Committee to find
of each.
Apathetic graduates
On Tuesday. ASSIJ Vice President DaveCal
ligan, aii' \ officio member of the Nominations
Committee, reported to the Senate that the
committee had found a fraternity member,
Tom Perry from Kappa Alpha, but said that "no
graduate students applied" for the COSS post.
McDermott replied that the Nominations
Committee should have tried some "affirma
tive action" and "recruited" a graduate stu
dent. Conway said the Nominations Commit
tee should have done "as it was directed" by
the Senate. He suggested to Calligan that the
Nominations Committee "give what we ask
for."
The Senate rejected Calligan's report and
sent the committee back to hunt for a graduate
student, along with some tips on where to find
one. But until one is found, there will be no
Subcommittee on Residences. There will be no
"student voice" on housing.
In the middle of this stands Hoke, whose
opening-night geniality is likely to be severely
tested in the months to come.
