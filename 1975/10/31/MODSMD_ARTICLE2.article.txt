# Sororities urge revival
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Presi
dent Bob Ottilie has received eight let
ters from national sororities strongly
supporting a revival of sororities here.
The letters came in response to an
inquiry sent out last year by the IFC to a
representative selection of sororities.
The purpose of the inquiry was to de
termine how much assistance would
be forthcoming to any campus group
taking the initial steps toward reviving
sororities.
The most enthusiastic letter came
from the Alpha Phi sorority.
An Alpha Phi representative wrote,
"We've always been interested in re
turning to Stanford. In fact, we have in
a holding fund the money which be
longed to our chapter at Stanford.
'Ready, willing and able'
"So we are financially ready, wdling
and able to restore the chapter
whenever the administration of Stan
ford University gives our chapter of
Alpha Phi International permission to
return."
Commenting on the letters, Ottilie
said. "They all said that they were very
interested. They want to talk to the
University if we think that will help
the cause."
The letters have arrived at a time
when the sorority question is undergo
ing re-examination. The issue had
been dormant since the houses' char
ters were revoked in 1944. The ban by
the Board of Trustees followed a de
cade of intense competition among
women for sorority admission.
In 1933, the number of women stu

dents jumped from 500 to 1050, but the
University refused to allow sororities
to expand and kept their capacity fixed
at 300.
Conditions changed
Assoc. Dean of Students Larry
Morton admits that "those conditions
probably don't pertain today." The
sorority question was raised again last
year during arguments over the draw
exempt status of fraternity members.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said, "The immediate issue is the fact
that there is an existing University pol
icy expressly prohibiting (sororities on
campus). Any thought of return would
have to encounter that policy and
would have to have pretty enormous
weight behind it â€” but that's not to say
that policies aren't available to be re
considered."'
Ottilie charged that "the University
does not want to expand the Greek sys
tem at all," citing the Committee on
Services to Students' (COSS)'s sub
committee report on housing, released
last year.
The report concludes that the sub
committee "would vote to remove this
feature [subjective selection) entirely
from the housing system, rather than
extend it to any groups other than the
presently established male frater
nities."
Subjective selection
Subjective selection, the choosing of
new house members on the basis of
evaluations by present residents, is
seen by Lyons as an important part of
the issue.

He said, "How they (the fraternities)
get their membership is quite a sepa
rate issue. One can have a sorority
without having subjective
selection ... I never said I was against
subjective selection. I just have serious
reservations about extending it.
"1 would much rather have a Uni
versity housing system where the
houses involved are up front with stu
dents and very open about what
criteria will be used and should be
used to determine where students will
live." Lyons said.
