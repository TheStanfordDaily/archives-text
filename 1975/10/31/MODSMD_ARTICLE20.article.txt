## Winchester House tells bizarre tale 
### CARLIN CHRISMAN 
Imagine climbing a staircase that takes you up
44 steps and makes seven winding turns, yet rises
a total of only nine feet. Or opening doors that lead
into the wall. Or seeing a chimney that stops four
inches from the ceiling. Yet this is only the begin
ning of the countless oddities to be found in the
Winchester Mystery House.
The 160-room mansion, located on six acres of
land in San Jose, was built at a cost of over $5.5
million, according to tour director Keith Kittle. It
is one of the most famous houses in the world —
famous for its exquisite workmanship and famous
for the mysteries enshrouding it, explanations of
which are a mixture of legend and conjecture.
The most probable explanation of the mansion
is a bizarre and strangely sad tale of a woman's
desperate effort to escape evil spirits which she
believed caused the death of her husband and
daughter, says Kittle.
Sara Winchester's husband was the son of the
famous Winchester rifle manufacturer. When he
died of tuberculosis in 1881, he left her with $20
million and a terror of the spirits of those who
were killed by the Winchester rifles.
Soon after her husband's death, a seeress told
her that she would be safe from the spirits as long
as she continued a building project.
The young widow moved West and began
building the house in the early 1900s. It was still
not completed when she died 38 years later. Day
and night, year after year, a team of about 16
carpenters carried out the instructions which she
allegedly received from the spirits in her seance
room every night. The house which began as an

eight-room farmhouse mushroomed into a
160-room, seven-story mansion. (The present
structure has only four stories, however, due to
destruction in the San Francisco earthquake.)
The hour-long tour of the house covers over a
mile but doesn't even begin to show all of the 160
rooms. Some of the oddities that are shown during
the tour are the staircase that goes straight up to
the ceiling, windows to brick walls, skylights in
the floors where Winchester could spy on her
servants, the pantry cupboard that is only an inch
deep and the cupboard that is three rooms deep
and the room whose floor is made entirely of trap
doors.
Besides its peculiarities, the house is also the
showcase for some of the most expensive and
beautiful materials to be assembled in one house,
Kittle says. There are shining gold and silver
chandeliers, art glass windows from Tiffany's in
laid with bronze and silver (valued at $10,000
each), parquetry floors and French wallpaper.
Every kind of material that went into the build
ing of the house was the finest that money could
buy.
Not only is the Winchester House a mystery, but
the strange and tormented owner is also a puzzle
to the more than one million people that have
viewed her house. The few people who knew her
said she was "eccentric but not crazy," Kittle
notes.
Shealways veiled herfaceand scurried through
the halls so that no one would see her. Once when
two of her servants — through no fault of their
own — encountered her without her veil she dis
missed them — with a year's wages in their pock
ets.

A WINDOW? — You bet. There are a lot of even stranger things
in the Winchester Mystery House, like a stairway that goes no
where and a chimney that stops four feet short of the ceiling.

PEEK-A-800 — Sara Winchester had skylights put in the flours
of some of the rooms of her strange mansion so sne could spy un
her servants. The floor of another room is entirely out of trap
doors.
