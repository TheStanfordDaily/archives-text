## Alabama KKK active 
### KATHY BATTS 
In 1963 Alabama Gov. George Wallace stood at the entrance to
the registrar's office of the University of Alabama, blocking the way
of the first black student to enter that school, in direct defiance of a
federal court order.
Ten years later, it seemed that the school had indeed cornea long
way. A black woman was chosen homecoming queen, and al
though Wallace did not give her the traditional kiss on the cheek,
he did shake her hand and say she was "a very lovely young lady."
But once again times have changed on the Tuscaloosa campus.
The Knights of the Ku KluxKlanare now petitioning the university
Student Government Association for a campus charter.
According to the Crimson and White, student newspaper at the
University of Alabama, the Knights have been distributing unau
thorized literature in campus dormitories.
Alabama state Knights organizer Don Black is a 22-year-old
former Alabama student. As a student he was active in the Ameri
can Nazi Party, the White Youth Alliance and the National Party.
Black is currently working exclusively for the Knights in a salaried
position.
Black claims the literature distribution was just a way for the
Knights to become known on campus and not for purposes of
member recruitment. "We were not soliciting for members," he
told the Crimson and White. "We usually do that on a personal
level."
The Knights have run into opposition from United Klans of
America, considered the Klan of the South. Imperial Wizard Robert
Shelton has denounced Black and his group, claiming the Knights
are not considered a Klan.
(Shelton was convicted and sent to prison in 19H1 for refusing to
reveal the names of Klan members and the mystics of the organiza
tion to federal authorities.)
Black claims that the Knights are ideologically the "future for
young white people in this state and in the nation."
Black says he wants to start a political grass roots party through
the Knights. A campus charter at Alabama might just provide the
springboard he needs.
