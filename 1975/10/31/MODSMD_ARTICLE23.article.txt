LOS ANGELES lAP) — Most
mental problems in dogs are
caused by their owners, accord
ing to "dog psychiatrist" Wil
liam Campbell.
"The dog is a great animal, but
he needs to be better under
stood." Campbell said in a recent
interview.
"Normally, the dog has no
problem. It's the people who
have the problem."
Campbell. 45, who describes
himself as a canine behavior
specialist, is the president-elect
of the American Society of Vet
erinary Ethology, which deals
with dog behavior problems.
He sees all sorts of dog prob
lems — house soiling, furniture
chewing, nervousness, lack of
self-esteem or even obesity.
"You can't change a dog's be
havior without changing the dog
owner in terms of how he relates
to the dog," Campbell said.
Campbell said a main reason
for dog problems is that owners
treat them inconsistently, alter
nating lavish praise with
punishment. Campbell favors

rewarding good deeds.
Campbell said hyperactive
children can make a dog
hyperactive, and marital stress
can be communicated to the dog.
"Most dogs have a tendency to
reduce tension by barking,
chewing or digging, or all
three," he said.
"He can get a gastrointestinal
upset or colitis if the tension
isn't stopped."
Some problems are brought on
by the canine "work ethic" or by
a natural tendency of a dog to
imitate his master."
"Dogs love to imitate people,"
he said. "If they see you blowing
your nose, they'll do their best to
imitate by tearing up the tissue
or reeling off a whole roll of
toilet paper."
And dogs like to have things to
do, Campbell said. Their in
stincts tell them to find food,
shelter and a bed.
"Nowadays, they don't have to
do that, so they make up their
own work, their own little tasks,
like tearing up pillows. That's
their chore."
