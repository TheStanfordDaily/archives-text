## Offensive line: lots of stud 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Mister, can you tell me who I
really am? Do you think I stand
out, or am I just a face in the
crowd? -Hay Duvies and the
Kinks.

Yes, Glenn Dickey, there is a
Stanford offensive line.
Just ask anyone who watched
Stanford rush for a record 395
yards last week against
Washington State. And after to
morrow, ask Oregon State Coach
Dee Andros about the Cards' of
fensive line.
Anonymity isn't new to the
Stanford offensive line, but this
season it's been more like obliv
ion. The quarterback con
troversy has been making news
for the last three weeks. Even a
renewed Cardinal ground attack,
which after seven games has
rushed for 1292 yards (12 more
yards than last year's 11-game
total), has been ignored. And
hell, if those statistics have gone
unnoticed, then you could
hardly expect the men in the
trenches to make news.
Running the key
But Andros, whose Beavers
face the Cards tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. in rainy Corvallis, is more
concerned with stopping the
Stanford ground attack than
with who's going to start at quar
terback. "On film, the Stanford

offensive line has been tremend
ous. They get off the ball well.
That's what made their ground
game so effective last week.
"We expect 'em to come out
running at us," added the Great
Pumpkin. That should rate us as
the biggest understatement of
the year. The Beavers, in drop
ping seven straight games this
year, have allowed more rushing
yardage than any other team in
the conference.
USC's Ricky Bell and the rest
of the Trojan backfield had a
field day against the Beavers in
Los Angeles earlier this year.
Bell had his second straight
200-yard game against OSU and
the Trojans finished with over
400 yards rushing against the
Beavers.
Worth steaks
Bell took his offensive line out
for steaks after the game against
the Beavers. Card tailback Ron
Inge, who last week rushed for a
career-high 153 yards, says he
might do the same. "If 1 ever gain
1000 yards, I'll do it," cracked
Inge.
"They've been together for a
couple of years and they're more
experienced," said Inge. "Coach
Houck (Stanford offensive line
coach Hudson Houck) has been
doing a great job. They have a
blocking option at the line. The

system really helps the backs."
Center Todd Anderson, the
unofficial leader of the offensive
line, says anonymity doesn't
bother him. "Shit, we never will
get a lot of attention, but after a
long run the backs congratulate
us."
And left guard Tom Tipton
says he likes being an unknown.
"I kind of like the anonymity of
the position. Vou have the best oi
both worlds."
Opposite attention
In 1973, when opposing de
fenders were sacking quarter
back Mike Boryla with shocking
regularity, the line was receiving
a lot of attention, but mostly
negative. This year, "The Quar
terback." has had more protec
tion than Emperor Hirohito." I
think I've been sacked only once
a game," said quarterback Mike
Cordova. "I guess we've just got
a lot of studs."
Studs is right. Anderson, Tip
ton, right guard Alex Karakazoff,
right tackle Al Ten√üruggencate
and left tackle Cordon King av
erage 248 pounds. The last time
Stanford had an offensive line
that big was before Jack Christ
iansen could walk.
It's a good thing that theCard's
are bigger than average this year.
Tomorrow Stanford will face
one of the biggest defensive lines

in the conference. "Their down
line has several players who are
6-5 and 6-6, plus one who's 6-8,"
Christiansen said. "Not only do
they have size, but they have the
agility to go with it. Really, it's
hard to see how they've been
beaten like they have."
But even with the Beavers'
size, the Card offensive line will
probably spring Inge and the
other Stanford running backs for
at least a couple of big gainers in
what should be an easy game.
And the only people who'll
ask fhem for their autographs
after the game will be the ur
chins who couldn't catch Cor
dova or Inge after the game.
