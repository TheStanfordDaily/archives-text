# Poloists take on Trojans
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Stanford's water polo team plays its last key home
game when the USC Trojans play the Cards Friday
at 3 p.m. at deGuerre pools.
"It's easy to get to number one, but it's hard to
stay there,"said Coach Art Lambert. His team has a
2-0 league record and presently holds undisputed
first place in the Pacific Eight. The Trojans, al
though 0-1 in the Pac-8, can't be taken lightly,
according to Lambert. IJSC's loss was a one goal
double-overtime decision against the UCLA
Bruins.
"The Trojans are a very physical team. We have
to generally improve on defense," Lambert said.
"We have to switch more smoothly on defense
and give up less goals."
One of the players Lambert has used to tighten
the Card defense is junior Paul Clark, the "man in
the hole." As Clark describes, "The center's job is
to bold his opponent's suit without the referee
noticing." Although this may be an exaggeration,
the man in the hole must stop the opposition
because he is the last defense before the goalie.
Clark's success has only come recently. Before
then, he had to switch off in the hole with captain

John Roberts and Drew McDonald.
"Before I was the starter in the hole, 1 would
make stupid mistakes, like passing off too fast.
Now I've learned to take my time, to pass to the
man driving through the lanes," said the junior
from Sunnyvale.
Against USC, Clark says he won't alter his stan
dard style of play. He will continue to try to con
trol the ball in the hole, and to set up goals when
his teammates drive to the net.
On defense, Clark feels that the Cards have been
working successfully on switching. According to
Clark, if Stanford can put all these things together
as they've done in practice, they'll do well against
the Trojans.
According to Lambert, the one thing that the
Cards can't work on in practice is their mental
attitude. "Our emotional level is still questiona
ble." he explained.
And the Cards can be sure that the Trojans will
be aiming for an opportunitv to spoil Stanford's
successful season. As Lambert told his team dur
ing practice, "They'll be so up for this game that
they'll walk over the fence."

Now I've learned to take my time, to pass to the
man driving through the lanes," said the junior
from Sunnyvale.
Against USC, Clark says he won't alter his stan
dard style of play. He will continue to try to con
trol the ball in the hole, and to set up goals when
his teammates drive to the net.
On defense, Clark feels that the Cards have been
working successfully on switching. According to
Clark, if Stanford can put all these things together
as they've done in practice, they'll do well against
the Trojans.
According to Lambert, the one thing that the
Cards can't work on in practice is their mental
attitude. "Our emotional level is still questiona
ble." he explained.
And the Cards can be sure that the Trojans will
be aiming for an opportunitv to spoil Stanford's
successful season. As Lambert told his team dur
ing practice, "They'll be so up for this game that
they'll walk over the fence."

Stanford's water polo team plays its last key home
game when the USC Trojans play the Cards Friday
at 3 p.m. at deGuerre pools.
"It's easy to get to number one, but it's hard to
stay there,"said Coach Art Lambert. His team has a
2-0 league record and presently holds undisputed
first place in the Pacific Eight. The Trojans, al
though 0-1 in the Pac-8, can't be taken lightly,
according to Lambert. IJSC's loss was a one goal
double-overtime decision against the UCLA
Bruins.
"The Trojans are a very physical team. We have
to generally improve on defense," Lambert said.
"We have to switch more smoothly on defense
and give up less goals."
One of the players Lambert has used to tighten
the Card defense is junior Paul Clark, the "man in
the hole." As Clark describes, "The center's job is
to bold his opponent's suit without the referee
noticing." Although this may be an exaggeration,
the man in the hole must stop the opposition
because he is the last defense before the goalie.
Clark's success has only come recently. Before
then, he had to switch off in the hole with captain

John Roberts and Drew McDonald.
"Before I was the starter in the hole, 1 would
make stupid mistakes, like passing off too fast.
