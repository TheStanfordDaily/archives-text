# Scotcher coach 'in love with the game'

### PAMELA BAGLEY JOHN ROOS 
"Women in sports have little
practical relevance in society
today. Sports can't earn good
grades, a satisfying job or other
material benefits. Instead, it
simply provides one with a fan
tastic opportunity to work
among joyful, living things —
and to have fun doing so."
Carla Soracco, assistant coach
for Stanford's women's field
hockey team, has strong feelings
about women's role in sports.
Born in Placerville, California
— 50 miles outside Sacramento
— Soracco calls herself a "coun
try girl at heart." Growing up
with four energetic brothers, she
quickly learned to appreciate the
outdoor life and became "the
most dedicated athlete in the
family."
"Because 1 was the only one
from my family who played on
two school teams simultane
ously — volleyball and basket
ball — I really earned my title."
Soracco explained.
First encounter
Soracco first encountered
field hockey when she tried out
for the Stanford team as a fresh
man in 19(56. "The first day 1
played, I fell in love with the
game."
Her skills were cultivated by

Coach Margaret Bar. a "craggy
faced English woman who really
barked. My feelings for her fluc
tuated between extreme dislike
and respect, but mostly the lat
ter!"
After graduating with a
philosophy degree. Soracco
realized that she "was going to
starve!"
She found a job through teach
ing credentials in history and
P.E. and started work as a
student-teacher in Oakland.
"What a disaster that was," she
recalls. "It took me 40 minutes
just to take roll call!"
Out of desperation. Soracco
spent the next two years in a
high school classroom teaching
American History and World
Geography.
On a whim
She and a few friends went to
the local airline office, bought
tickets and took off for a year's
trip around the world.
"1 was entranced by India and
its incredibly exciting culture.
The food was fantastic, and it
gave me a chance to visit some
distant relatives."
Upon returning, Soracco be-

came co-manager of a field hoc
key camp in San Jose, where she
met Shirley Schoof, Stanford's
head coach. Schoof invited
Soracco to give a series of guest
clinics on field hockey at Stan
ford. and last spring asked her to
be assistant coach.
"Of course 1 accepted the offer
without hesitation. My heart was
secretly always in field hockey."
Soracco enjoys teaching at her
alma mater. "Today, many peo
ple find economic consideration
more important than psycholog
ical or emotional ones," Soracco
surmises. "They base their job
choices on the amount of money
or prestige offered when it
should really be fun."
No had feelings
Soracco feels she has de
veloped an intense attachment
to the Stanford team, and says
she has never experienced any
bad feelings between herself and
the players.
"1 try to remind the girls that
field hockey is not a game to be
learned overnight. I think the
key to good playing is mental
preparation and total game in
volvement."

Soracco spends her free time
with her "hockey family," the
Irish, one of several teams in the
Northern California Field Hoc
key Association (NCFHA). The
NCFHA selects teams to repres
ent this area for state and na
tional tournaments. "I've been
on the NCFHA team 11 times
and on the State selected team 10
times," Soracco says.
And with modesty she adds,
"I'm also one of two players from
California ever to be chosen to
play on the national squad."
