# Cornett leads golf tournament
## 
### 
Stanford's Pat Cornett shot a
first-round 75 yesterday to take
the lead in the Stanford
Woman's Collegiate Invitational
tournament on the Stnford golf
course. Another Card contender,
senior Pam Palmieri, stood tied
for fourth in the individual field
that includes competitors from
seven schools.
The Palmieri-Cornett team led
the two-woman competition,
leading second-place San Diego
State by six strokes. And the
Cards' four-woman team trailed
last year's national champion,
Arizona State, with a total of 332.
Tournament play continues
today and tomorrow, with the
times set at 9 a.m. today and 9:30
Saturday.
