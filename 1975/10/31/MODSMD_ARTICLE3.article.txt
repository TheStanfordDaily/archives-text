# Dad will pay, claim students

### WARREN LEIGHT GEORGE ANDERS 
Although nearly all students sur
veyed here say they are displeased
with the projected rise in tuition for
next fall, most of them expect to be able
to meet the increase.
The Daily interviewed students in
the wake of Provost William Miller's
announcement Oct. 14 that under
graduate tuition for 1975-76 will prob
ably be $4303. a $497 increase over
this year.
"It would be like telling a Cadillac
driver that the car's I'M quadrophonic
system will cost a few hundred more,"
one junior said. "Should he buy the
Caddie or switch to a Volkswagen?"
Others echoed his feelings. "It
doesn't affect me really." another
junior said. "My father will have to pay
more money. He won't be happy, but
he'll pay it."
Over half get aid
Yet not all undergraduates are born
to a life of steak and tax-free munici
pals. Some 55 percent of all students
receive some financial aid, according
to Financial Aids Director Robert Huff.
The aid. based on "demonstrated
need," includes both loans and cam
pus jobs. For some students, outright
grants form part of the package.
A few students, those on athletic
scholarships for example, seem un
likely to be affected by the rise.
"It will take an extra $75,000 just to
offer the same number of athletic scho
larships next year," Athletics Director
Joe Ruetz said. All scholarship money
is raised by the Buck Club, which sol
icits money from alumni and other
donors. The funds are then given to the
University.

The wide range of family income
among students makes it difficult to
assess students' reaction to the
Cadillac's quadrophonic.
Financial Aids Counselor Sylvia
Bridges said, "1 haven't had any stu
dents coming to me asking about aid
for next year." She added that her of
fice "will not have a definite aid plan
for next year until some time winter
quarter."
Applications for financial aid dur
ing the 1975-76 school year are not due
until April.
Stanford's "comfortable" under
graduates mouthed displeasure with
the costs but generally admitted the
increase will have little effect on their
lifestyles. These students respond al
most unanimously. "I'll send the bill
to my father."
Parental pressure
Some cite increased parental pres
sure as a possible side effect. One
executive's son explained, "My old
man will probably give me a speech on
how my grades better improve and
how I should take more practical
courses, then he'll write out my check
and forget about it."
Things aren't quite as simple for the
rest of the student body.
Lower and middle income students
who depend on the Financial Aids Of
fice will now be more dependent. They
have already been feeling the cost
pinch of a Stanford education. Stu
dents who have always "spent sum
mer working to pay for fall" and who
depend on aid. now feel they have less
control over their situations.
'In limbo'
A junior on financial aid com
mented. "I guess I'm pretty much in

limbo. My family doesn't have any
extra money and I'm already working
as much as I can. The school will have
to cover the increase. In July they'll
send me my package and then I'll
know where I stand," she explained.
A freshman expressed the predica
ment of many students who depend on
financial aid: "I'm assuming the
school will come through; if not, I'll be
at a state school in September."
