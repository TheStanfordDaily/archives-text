# Pac-8 predictions
## Another Card win 
### 
After a perfect five-for-five week that fol
lowed a perfect four-for-four week, the prog
nosticator is now picking at a potent .850
percentage. You could look it up. And be
cause there are some horrible weekends to
call coming up (how do you posiblv pick the
Oregon State-Washington State game?), he'd
like to fatten his record while he can.
The Stanford Cardinals travel to Corvallis
this weekend to tangle with the winless OSU
Beavers. There aren't likely to be many
thrills — or fans. Whether or not Mike
Cordova's arm is really hurt, the Cards prob
ably won't 1/iroiv too much. By the time the
game is over, Donny Stevenson may hove
another case of "Astro-turf toe," and the
Cards should have an easy win.
In Berkeley (and on national TV I it'll be

one of the better Pacific-Eight games of the
season: California tries to tackle the mighty
USC Trojans. Hear halfback Chuck Mancie
will have a tougher task than his USC coun
terpart, Ricky Bell, whom the Trojan PR
people are beginning to push for the Heis
man trophy. (JSC's defense should hold.
The UCLA Bruins, trounced by Washing
ton last season, won't make the same mis
take again: quarterback John Sciarra has
Ihem rolling towards their last-game con
frontation with USC. And Oregon's Ducks,
probably giddy over last week's defeat of
Utah, should sink at Pullman, Wash.
