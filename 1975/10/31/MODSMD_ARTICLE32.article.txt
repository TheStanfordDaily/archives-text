# Christiansen and the press
## Controversy continues 
### 
Critical mistakes
All coaches dread having
genuine competition at quarter
back, and to know why, you have
only to look at Stanford. Jack
Christiansen is as much a victim
as anybody in the muddled quar
terback situation. It may cost
him his job.
How did this all happen? Why
was Cordova picked originally,
and why has Christiansen been
so reluctant to go to Benjamin?
From my own observation and
from talking to a number of peo
ple close to the situation, I've
surmised that Christiansen orig
inally picked Cordova because
he was a better practice player.
Benjamin is a lackadaisical
player in practice. Cordova is
not. Though Benjamin was the
better passer in practice, Christ
iansen decided Cordova would
be a better leader, because he
was more eager. Most coaches
would have made the same deci
sion. I'm sure, though not all of
them would have stuck with it as
long as Christiansen has.
Again in common with most
coaches, Christiansen hoped
Cordova would become a solid
player so there would be no
question that Mike should be the
starting quarterback. Cordova
has shown flashes of brilliance
— most notably, in the 19-19 tie
with Michigan earlier this year
— but overall, he has not been
consistent enough to justify
Christiansen's faith in him.
Christiansen has made three
critical mistakes. The first was in
not fully explaining his deci
sion. (Again, he may have been
trying to protect a player — in
this case, Benjamin — by not
doing so.) He has made obscure

references to what he sees in
practice, but that means nothing
to fans (or sportswriters), who
judge by what they see in the
game. In the games, Benjamin
has been clearly superior.
His second mistake was in not
realizing there can be a differ
ence between practice and
games for some players. Ideally,
players should practice as hard
as they play, but not all do. War
ren Wells was a terrible practice
player, which contributed to his
being cut by Detroit and Kansas
City, but the Raiders saw beyond
that and he became All-Pro. Ben
jamin appears to be the same
kind of player, miserable in prac

tice, brilliant in the game.
Christiansen's final and most
serious mistake was in not let
ting Benjamin start and play at
least one full game. Had he done
that, he would have known by
now either that Benjamin is as
good as he has looked in spot
situations or that he was not
good enough to do the job for a
whole game. As it stands, he
doesn't know, and he has no de
fense against critics who say
Benjamin has deserved to start.

consistent enough to justify
Christiansen's faith in him.
Christiansen has made three
critical mistakes. The first was in
not fully explaining his deci
sion. (Again, he may have been
trying to protect a player — in
this case, Benjamin — by not
doing so.) He has made obscure

references to what he sees in
practice, but that means nothing
to fans (or sportswriters), who
judge by what they see in the
game. In the games, Benjamin
has been clearly superior.
His second mistake was in not
realizing there can be a differ
ence between practice and
games for some players. Ideally,
players should practice as hard
as they play, but not all do. War
ren Wells was a terrible practice
player, which contributed to his
being cut by Detroit and Kansas
City, but the Raiders saw beyond
that and he became All-Pro. Ben
jamin appears to be the same
kind of player, miserable in prac

tice, brilliant in the game.
Christiansen's final and most
serious mistake was in not let
ting Benjamin start and play at
least one full game. Had he done
that, he would have known by
now either that Benjamin is as
good as he has looked in spot
situations or that he was not
good enough to do the job for a
whole game. As it stands, he
doesn't know, and he has no de
fense against critics who say
Benjamin has deserved to start.

Critical mistakes
All coaches dread having
genuine competition at quarter
back, and to know why, you have
only to look at Stanford. Jack
Christiansen is as much a victim
as anybody in the muddled quar
terback situation. It may cost
him his job.
How did this all happen? Why
was Cordova picked originally,
and why has Christiansen been
so reluctant to go to Benjamin?
From my own observation and
from talking to a number of peo
ple close to the situation, I've
surmised that Christiansen orig
inally picked Cordova because
he was a better practice player.
Benjamin is a lackadaisical
player in practice. Cordova is
not. Though Benjamin was the
better passer in practice, Christ
iansen decided Cordova would
be a better leader, because he
was more eager. Most coaches
would have made the same deci
sion. I'm sure, though not all of
them would have stuck with it as
long as Christiansen has.
Again in common with most
coaches, Christiansen hoped
Cordova would become a solid
player so there would be no
question that Mike should be the
starting quarterback. Cordova
has shown flashes of brilliance
— most notably, in the 19-19 tie
with Michigan earlier this year
— but overall, he has not been
consistent enough to justify
Christiansen's faith in him.
