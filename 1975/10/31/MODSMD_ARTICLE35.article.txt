'Gunman* seized near Ford
SAN FRANCISCO — A babbling middle-aged
man who said he wanted to protect President Ford
was seized with a toy pistol a block away from Ford
yesterday.
The Secret Service interrogated the man for two
hours, and said he would not be charged "at this
time" with threatening the President.
In a speech prepared for a $250-a-plate fundrais
ing luncheon held earlier at the St. Francis Hotel,
Ford said every indicator suggests the nation has
been on the road to economic recovery for six
months.
He said his administration has "injected the
American spirit of can-do into our policies at home
and abroad," and has stirred a strong surge of na
tional confidence.
Ford's text did not mention last month's alleged
assassination attempt. Instead, he began by saying,
"A visit to San Francisco never fails to bolster my
optimism."
Prince takes power in Spain
MADRID, Spain — The government announced
last night it has transfered power temporarily from
Cen. Francisco Franco to his heir, Prince Juan Car
los de Borbon, as Spain's new chief of state.
Sources said the decision to transfer power was
made after Premier Carlos Arias Navarro conferred
privately with the prince.
The sources said the transfer of power, under
Article 11 of the Spanish constitution, was only
temporary under law.
But they added it would, in effect, be permanent
since Franco is not expected to recover.
Reliable sources said the 37-year-old prince, who
had previously refused to step in on a temporary
basis, gave in to intense pressure from the govern
ment.
The prince, rejected in advance by Spain's long
silent political opposition, is scheduled to preside
at a cabinet meeting today.

Franco named the prince six years ago to succeed
on event of his death, retirement or incapacity to
rule.
Besides being head of state, the prince will be
come Spain's first king since his grandfather, Al
fonso XIII, abdicated in 1931.
The temporary transfer of power, however, does
not include installation of the prince on the throne.
That comes only with Franco's death.
Judge rules Alioto in conflict
SAN FRANCISCO — A judge ruled Thursday
that Mayor Joseph L. Alioto violated the conflict of
interest section of the City Charter through his con
nection with family shipping interests.
The district attorney immediately announced he
would start criminal proceedings unless Alioto di
vested himself of the connection, and the mayor
promptly said he would do so.
Superior Court Judge Albert Axelrod ruled the
mayor was guilty of conflict of interest because he
guaranteed a $5.4 million bank loan that enabled
his relatives to purchase a 49 percent interest in the
Pacific Far East shipping line. The line leases space
with the Port of San Francisco, and Alioto as mayor
appoints port officials.
Committee okays NYC loan
WASFIINCTON — The Senate Banking Commit
tee yesterday approved a $4 billion loan guarantee
bill for New York City, but the Ford administration
reaffirmed its opposition to providing federal aid
for the financially stricken city.
The bill faces a threatened filibuster on the Se
nate floor and a probable presidential veto if it
survives House and Senate opposition.
The loan guarantee was approved in the Senate
committee by an 8 to 5 vote. Sen. Robert Morgan
(D-N.C.) was the lone Democrat to vote against it
and Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) the only Republi
can to vote for it.

Battles rage in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslem gunmen appeared
to gain the upper hand yesterday in Lebanon's civil
war as they and their Palestinian allies overran the 1
last forward Christian militia outpost in the down
town hotel district in Beirut and moved into the
shadow of the 26-story Holiday Inn.
At the same time, unidentified gunmen kidnaped
the third American in eight days. He was identified
as Clyde Huddleston,47, of Ft. Worth, Tex., a pilot
for a Lebanese cargo airline. U.S. Embassy officers
Charles Callgaher, 44. of Roanoke, Va.,and William
Dykes, 50, of San Jose, Calif., were abducted Oct.
22.
The conflict began in the Arab quarters last April
and has only recently moved into the downtown
area and residential districts favored by foreigners.
The battles raged despite Premier Rashid
Karami's announcement Wednesday night of new
agreements to enforce a cease-fire with backing
from Yasir Arafat and other moderate Palestinian
leaders.
Hanoi releases Americans
BANGKOK, Thailand — One of nine Americans
released yesterday by the North Vietnamese said he
was held in a solitary cell for six months. He said it
was "psychologically hard."
Half of those freed were missionaries. All the
returnees looked well.
He was among 14 people released in Hanoi in
what U.S. officials saw as a trial balloon by Hanoi
to get some dialogue going with the United States.
