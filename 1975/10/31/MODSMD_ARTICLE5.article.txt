# Rise ends in minority hiring
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
A recent leveling off of the appoint
ment of blacks, chicanos and women
to faculty positions here could indi
cate a "faltering on the part of the Uni
versity towards affirmative action."
Vice Provost Arthur I. Bienenstock
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
Bienenstock, presenting the annual
report on faculty affirmative action,
showed slides displaying various
University hiring statistics since 1971,
when the University set up its Affirma
tive Action Fund.
Bienenstock's figures generally
showed a marked increase in women
and minorities appointed in the initial
two years, and a leveling off after
wards.
Bienenstock emphasized, however,
that "there are a lot of other factors
operating." He pointed toa decreasein
annual faculty appointments, which
dropped from about 100 in 1971 to 85
this year.
Untenured female faculty
Stanford's rate of appointments of
female faculty members is "about even
statistically" with the percentage of
women receiving Ph.D.s each year,
Bienenstock said. However, the per
centage of untenured female faculty
members here is larger than the per
centage of untenured male faculty
members.
Last year, also, a larger number of
senior female faculty retired, which
adversely affected the figures.
On minority appointments, though,
the University is "doing far above the
level we should (statistically) be
doing." according to Bienenstock.
"I see a very gloomy prospect for the
percentage of faculty minorities if
things just happen statistically." he
said. "It's very important, therefore,
for the University to maintain affirma
tive action.
"For the Affirmative Action Fund to

be effective, the faculty must con
stantly be searching for promising
blacks, chicanos and women." he
added.
One reason for the minority ap
pointments leveling off, said Bienens
tock, is that "we are starting to face
competition in affirmative action. We
made a decision to start affirmative ac
tion when other (universities) were
not. and now they're following suit."
Originally, Stanford had a high
"yield" rate for minorities, which
means most of those invited ultimately
accepted positions. However, because
other universities are now adopting af
firmative action, this "yield" rate has
dropped considerably, according to
Bienenstock.
"For example, we made a strong at
tempt last year to obtain two senior
chicano professors, both of whom
turned us down eventually," he said.
Lyman agrees
President Richard Lyman agreed
with Bienenstock's emphasis on the
need for affirmative action. Me said.
"Affirmative action enables the Uni
versity to take advantage of really first
class opportunities, to get good people
wherever they show up.
"Every other good university in the
country is trying to do the same thing,
and if we give up, we'll fall far be
hind," Lyman asserted.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James C.ibbs asked the Senate, "What
can we do to increase our yield (of
minority and women faculty appoint
ments)?"
'Keeping track'
He expressed discontent with
Bienenstock's figures which, he said,
showed that the University was "keep
ing track" of Ph.D. production rates
around the country. "We should be
able to do better than others since we
area more illustrious institution," said
Gibbs.

was "sent out to do a lot of ax work."

A recent leveling off of the appoint
ment of blacks, chicanos and women

Vice Provost Arthur I. Bienenstock
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
Bienenstock, presenting the annual
report on faculty affirmative action,
showed slides displaying various
University hiring statistics since 1971,
when the University set up its Affirma
tive Action Fund.
Bienenstock's figures generally
showed a marked increase in women
and minorities appointed in the initial
two years, and a leveling off after
wards.
Bienenstock emphasized, however,
that "there are a lot of other factors
operating." He pointed toa decreasein
annual faculty appointments, which
dropped from about 100 in 1971 to 85
this year.
Untenured female faculty
Stanford's rate of appointments of
female faculty members is "about even
statistically" with the percentage of
women receiving Ph.D.s each year,
Bienenstock said. However, the per
centage of untenured female faculty
members here is larger than the per
centage of untenured male faculty
members.
Last year, also, a larger number of
senior female faculty retired, which
adversely affected the figures.
On minority appointments, though,
the University is "doing far above the
level we should (statistically) be
doing." according to Bienenstock.
"I see a very gloomy prospect for the
percentage of faculty minorities if
things just happen statistically." he
said. "It's very important, therefore,
for the University to maintain affirma
tive action.
"For the Affirmative Action Fund to

be effective, the faculty must con
stantly be searching for promising
blacks, chicanos and women." he
added.
One reason for the minority ap
pointments leveling off, said Bienens
tock, is that "we are starting to face
competition in affirmative action. We
made a decision to start affirmative ac
tion when other (universities) were
not. and now they're following suit."
Originally, Stanford had a high
"yield" rate for minorities, which
means most of those invited ultimately
accepted positions. However, because
