# Bilingual ballots
## 
### 
As a bilingual individual, I am
both insulted and outraged at
Bill Ross's Oct. 2UDailycolumn
"Bilingual ballots fight im
agined injustice."
Ross contends that the Office
of Civil Rights has invented or
"imagined" the injustice that
Spanish-speaking people are
discriminated against by ballots
worded only in English. He also
argues that the provision .. is
largely unnecessary and poorly
constructed."
I submit that many of Ross's
premises are poorly founded and
show a callous disregard for the
rights of many bilingual citizens
of the U.S.
For example, Ross rightly as
serts that as required by law, a
naturalized citizen must be able
to speak, read and write English.
However, Ross Tails to consider
that although a naturalized citi
zen can speak, read and write
English, this doesn't necessarily
imply that he can understand a
complicated and often
confusingly-worded ballot.
Monolingual citizens
Even monolingual citizens
often complain that they cannot
understand the wording or the
meaning of an election ballot.
The League of Women Voters
recognizes this problem.
The League holds voter semi
nars before important elections
to inform the public of the actual
meaning of the complicated
wording of election ballots.
But for a person who speaks
English as a second language,
tlie often confusing and ambigu
ous English wording of an elec
tion ballot poses especially dif
ficult problems. The possibility
that discrimination could result
if ballots were maintained solely
in English is just what the Civil
Rights Office was trying to pre
vent in providing for bilingual
ballots.
In addition, Ross argues that it
is unlikely that people who have
taken little interest in learning
English would want to vote. "It
seems unnecessary," according
to Ross, "to make elaborate spe
cial accomodations for persons
who have purposely isolated
themselves from the mainstream
of national life."
Segregated neighborhoods
Obviously Ross is unaware
that in many U.S. cities in the
southwest, many native-born
Spanish-speaking people can
live out their lives without hav
ing to speak much English.
They have resided in segre
gated monolingual neighbor
hoods, purposely divorced from

Celso Ortiz

"the mainstream society" by
discriminatory and seg
regationist practices. 1
And because of poor Barrio
and ghetto schools, many
native-born Spanish-speaking
individuals often graduate
without even being able to ade
quately read or write English.
These people have not pur
posely isolated themselves from
the mainstream, as Ross be
lieves, but rather have been pur
posely and deliberately segre
gated and isolated from the
mainstream by a poor educa
tional system and by past dis
criminatory and segregationist
practices.
Today, the courts are ordering
the desegregation of schools to
rectify past injustices of seg
regationist policies of the do
minant middle-class society. To
then place the responsibility and
the blame on the victim for not
voting or participating in main
stream society because of lack of
interest in learning English is
indeed a spurious and specious
argument.
Logical step
Finally, I ask Ross whether it is
only natural and logical that a
democratic government should
take steps to make individuals
who speak a second language
more informed voters by utiliz
ing that capacity?
This is precisely what the gov
ernment is attempting to do by
providing for bilingual ballots.
This is also the driving force be
hind the present implementa
tion of bilingual/bicultural edu
cational programs throughout
the country.
Educators have become in
creasingly aware that speaking a
second language other than En
glish is an asset rather than a de
ficit for bilingual individuals in
our society.
Election system
Ross also complains about the
expenses involved.
But I remind Ross that
publically-financed elections
resulted from an earlier election
system in which such corruption
took place. The expense entailed
in providing bilingual election
ballots is merely an extension of
the publically-financed election
system and would indeed be a
significant improvement of
democracy in the system.
Morover, the expense in
volved in providing bilingual
ballots is well worth the cost if
more people are encouraged to
vote.

English would want to vote. "It
seems unnecessary," according
to Ross, "to make elaborate spe
cial accomodations for persons
who have purposely isolated
themselves from the mainstream
of national life."
Segregated neighborhoods
Obviously Ross is unaware
that in many U.S. cities in the
southwest, many native-born
Spanish-speaking people can
live out their lives without hav
ing to speak much English.
They have resided in segre
gated monolingual neighbor
hoods, purposely divorced from

Celso Ortiz

"the mainstream society" by
discriminatory and seg
regationist practices. 1
And because of poor Barrio
and ghetto schools, many
native-born Spanish-speaking
individuals often graduate
without even being able to ade
quately read or write English.
These people have not pur
posely isolated themselves from
the mainstream, as Ross be
lieves, but rather have been pur
posely and deliberately segre
gated and isolated from the
mainstream by a poor educa
tional system and by past dis
criminatory and segregationist
practices.
Today, the courts are ordering
the desegregation of schools to
rectify past injustices of seg
regationist policies of the do
minant middle-class society. To
then place the responsibility and
the blame on the victim for not
voting or participating in main
stream society because of lack of
interest in learning English is
indeed a spurious and specious
argument.
Logical step
Finally, I ask Ross whether it is
only natural and logical that a
democratic government should
take steps to make individuals
who speak a second language
more informed voters by utiliz
ing that capacity?
This is precisely what the gov
ernment is attempting to do by
providing for bilingual ballots.
This is also the driving force be
hind the present implementa
tion of bilingual/bicultural edu
cational programs throughout
the country.
Educators have become in
creasingly aware that speaking a
second language other than En
glish is an asset rather than a de
ficit for bilingual individuals in
our society.
Election system
Ross also complains about the
expenses involved.
But I remind Ross that
publically-financed elections
resulted from an earlier election
system in which such corruption
took place. The expense entailed
in providing bilingual election
ballots is merely an extension of
the publically-financed election
system and would indeed be a
significant improvement of
democracy in the system.
Morover, the expense in
volved in providing bilingual
ballots is well worth the cost if
more people are encouraged to
vote.
(Celso Ortiz is a senior in an
thropology.)
As a bilingual individual, I am
both insulted and outraged at
Bill Ross's Oct. 2UDailycolumn
"Bilingual ballots fight im
agined injustice."
Ross contends that the Office
of Civil Rights has invented or
"imagined" the injustice that
Spanish-speaking people are
discriminated against by ballots
worded only in English. He also
argues that the provision .. is
largely unnecessary and poorly
constructed."
I submit that many of Ross's
premises are poorly founded and
show a callous disregard for the
rights of many bilingual citizens
of the U.S.
For example, Ross rightly as
serts that as required by law, a
naturalized citizen must be able
to speak, read and write English.
However, Ross Tails to consider
that although a naturalized citi
zen can speak, read and write
English, this doesn't necessarily
imply that he can understand a
complicated and often
confusingly-worded ballot.
Monolingual citizens
Even monolingual citizens
often complain that they cannot
understand the wording or the
meaning of an election ballot.
The League of Women Voters
recognizes this problem.
The League holds voter semi
nars before important elections
to inform the public of the actual
meaning of the complicated
wording of election ballots.
But for a person who speaks
English as a second language,
tlie often confusing and ambigu
ous English wording of an elec
tion ballot poses especially dif
ficult problems. The possibility
that discrimination could result
if ballots were maintained solely
in English is just what the Civil
Rights Office was trying to pre
vent in providing for bilingual
ballots.
In addition, Ross argues that it
is unlikely that people who have
taken little interest in learning
English would want to vote. "It

providing for bilingual ballots.
This is also the driving force be
hind the present implementa
tion of bilingual/bicultural edu
cational programs throughout
the country.
Educators have become in
creasingly aware that speaking a
second language other than En
glish is an asset rather than a de
ficit for bilingual individuals in
our society.
Election system
Ross also complains about the
expenses involved.
But I remind Ross that
publically-financed elections
resulted from an earlier election
system in which such corruption
took place. The expense entailed
in providing bilingual election
ballots is merely an extension of
the publically-financed election
system and would indeed be a
significant improvement of
democracy in the system.
Morover, the expense in
volved in providing bilingual
ballots is well worth the cost if
more people are encouraged to
vote.
