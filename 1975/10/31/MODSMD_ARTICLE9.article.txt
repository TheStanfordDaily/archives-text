One need not be a conserva
tive to sympathize with William
F. Buckley Ir.'s stand against
libertarianism.
Albert Camus, for example,
showed in The Rebel that
man's finest intentions, such as
justice and equality, if pursued
along one dimension — the
horizontal one or the merely
secular — tend to become fanati
cism.
That is why he reintroduced
the idea of the religious (mod
ified as "the sacred") into his
later work and spoke of the "vul
garity." of the anti-religious at
titude, in an interview.
That God-man vertical dimen
sion — of value, faith — could
alone stop the runaway
phenomena, such as the Soviet
terror and the Nazi concentra
tion camps, of what he called
"the horizontal religions" of our
time: Communism, Fascism.
Conversely, properly religious
fanaticism of the Inquisitorial
type needs the check of the secu
lar dimension, or moderating
realism.
Schematically, one may say

This is a quality which the
politically immature, whether
libertarians, extreme conserva
tives, Communists, gauchistes
or fascists, almost totally lack.
The president of the
Psychological Association of
America has discovered, lat
tely . that man is more than
biological and calls the prevail
ing herd view "scientifically
wrong."
Charles McCabe, who reports
this (citing also Karl
Menninger's What Became of
Original Sin?) concludes that
"the Ten Commandments are
right on."
In the last issue of Encounter,
the distinguished sociologist,
Lewis Feuer, sees a return of
"philosophical idealism."
And then there are Alexandr
Solzhenitsyn and Irving Kristol
and, well, this thing could be
come positively catching.
