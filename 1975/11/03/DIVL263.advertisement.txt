Its hot down below
PG&E has the nation's only geothermal
power development—at The Geysers in
Sonoma County —where it uses natural
steam from deep within the earth to turn
turbo-generators to produce electricity.
We have built 11 generating units there
and 4 more are on the way.
How does it work? At its birth, the
earth was a hot. molten mass. As it cooled
it formed a crust. The molten mass, called
magma, is still cooling beneath the crust.
Where depths and other conditions
permit, those heat reservoirs can be
tapped by wells, and steam is brought to
the surface, under control, to spin the
turbines.
Our geothermal power costs less than
power generated by burning oil. We're
continuing the development, but at best,
geothermal can satisfy no more than 10%
of our needs to serve Northern and
Central California.
Diversity: Other
sources of energy
PG&E employs five sources of primary
energy—oil, natural gas, natural steam
I geothermal), nuclear fuel and falling
water (hydro power). All are used to
produce the electricity for PG&E's inter
connected network system. They are
"mixed" for maximum efficiency to gen
erate power at the lowest possible cost.
To harness water for power, we have
built one of the nation's greatest hydro
electric systems. In "average" rafn and
snowfall years, hydro provides about 50%
of our electric energy. The force of falling
water makes the wheels go 'round in the
generating plants. Hydro generation
neither contaminates nor consumes the
water itself; it is returned to the rivers
undiminished, to serve agriculture and
other vital needs.
Building hydroelectnc facilities is
expensive, but they are economical to
operate. The low cost is one reason why
our rates, despite recent increases, remain
among the lowest in the nation.
But since nearly all economically
acceptable hydro sites have already been
developed, oil and natural gas have
become more prominent in our energy
mix in recent years. Unfortunately the
costs of these fossil fuels have been sky
rocketing. In just five years, the prices
for gas have more than doubled and the
cost per barrel of low-sulfur fuel oil has
quintupled. All but two of the PG&E
electric rate increases requested in the
past five years were to offset these higher
fuel costs.

other vital needs.
Building hydroelectnc facilities is
expensive, but they are economical to
operate. The low cost is one reason why
our rates, despite recent increases, remain
among the lowest in the nation.
But since nearly all economically
acceptable hydro sites have already been
developed, oil and natural gas have
become more prominent in our energy
mix in recent years. Unfortunately the
costs of these fossil fuels have been sky
rocketing. In just five years, the prices
for gas have more than doubled and the
cost per barrel of low-sulfur fuel oil has
quintupled. All but two of the PG&E
electric rate increases requested in the
past five years were to offset these higher
fuel costs.
Its hot down below
PG&E has the nation's only geothermal
power development—at The Geysers in
Sonoma County —where it uses natural
steam from deep within the earth to turn
turbo-generators to produce electricity.
We have built 11 generating units there
and 4 more are on the way.
How does it work? At its birth, the
earth was a hot. molten mass. As it cooled
it formed a crust. The molten mass, called
magma, is still cooling beneath the crust.
Where depths and other conditions
permit, those heat reservoirs can be
tapped by wells, and steam is brought to
the surface, under control, to spin the
turbines.
Our geothermal power costs less than
power generated by burning oil. We're
continuing the development, but at best,
geothermal can satisfy no more than 10%
of our needs to serve Northern and
Central California.
Diversity: Other
sources of energy
PG&E employs five sources of primary
energy—oil, natural gas, natural steam
I geothermal), nuclear fuel and falling
water (hydro power). All are used to
produce the electricity for PG&E's inter
connected network system. They are
"mixed" for maximum efficiency to gen
erate power at the lowest possible cost.
To harness water for power, we have
built one of the nation's greatest hydro
electric systems. In "average" rafn and
snowfall years, hydro provides about 50%
of our electric energy. The force of falling
water makes the wheels go 'round in the
generating plants. Hydro generation
neither contaminates nor consumes the
water itself; it is returned to the rivers
undiminished, to serve agriculture and
other vital needs.
