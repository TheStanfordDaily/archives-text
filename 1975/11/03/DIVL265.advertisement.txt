The alternative to oil and gas. which
are getting more scarce and more costly,
is uranium. Nuclear power plants can
produce electricity at half the cost of a
new oil-fired plant. Our two nuclear units
at Diablo Canyon will save our having
to buy 24 million barrels of expensive
imported oil a year.
These are the good reasons why PG&E
and other utility systems, at home and
abroad, are building nuclear plants.
Coal one day may be our sixth source
of primary energy. We are in the process
of acquiring reserves in Utah.
Recent developments in solar power
show interesting promise, but its use as
a major source is, at best, many years
away. Tidal and wind power are still in
limited development, and may never
become practical for large-scale commer
cial use, but research continues.
