## Marijuana aids chemotherapy patients 
### KAREN CAESAR 
Marijuana is far more effective than
any other drug in relieving the vomit
ing and nausea that plague thousands
of patients undergoing chemical
therapy for cancer (chemotherapy), re
searchers say.
"It's been known anecdotally for
quite a few years," said Dr. Jim
Breeden,a chemotherapist in the on
cology department of the Medical
Center. "A lot of drugs you can use for
nausea. Unfortunately they are very
ineffective. Results reported (using
marijuana) are significantly better
than you could get from anything else
available."
Dr. Leo Hollister, a psychophar-

macologist at the Palo Alto Veteran's
Hospital, said the discovery resulted
from an "if you listen to what the pa
tients have to say, you might learn
something" approach. A young man
who had leukemia and also smoked
pot noticed it lessened the nausea con
siderably and began "doing it on the
side to prevent it" specifically.
But a major problem, Hollister
noted, is that "a lot of people would
just as soon vomit as have a high," so
further work is being done io isolatethe
nausea-suppressing element in mari
juana from the euphoria-creating ele
ment.
The nausea and vomiting side ef
fects of the chemotherapy can become

severe enough to make it "psychologi
cally difficult for patients to accept
their treatment," said Breeden. It can
get to the point where just the thought
of the treatment will trigger nausea in
the patient, making him sick to his
stomach and creating a tremendous
psychological burden.
In addition, reaction to
chemotherapeutic drugs "usually gets
worse as time goes on," Breeden said.
The most recent experiments using
marijuana were conducted at the Har
vard Medical School. Dr. Stephen E.
Salan said that he and his colleagues
now "know how the cancer treatment
drugs that cause vomiting work. Most
of them trigger a part of the brain to

cause vomiting, as opposed to nausea
originating in the stomach. So, we can
assume that the marijuana somehow
works on the central nervous system to
block or repress the vomiting re
sponse,"
Salan said that about 75 percent of
the thousands of patients receiving
chemotherapy for cancer suffer mod
erate to extreme nausea and vomiting.
And of this group, ninety percent get
no relief from conventional anti
nausea drugs.
In the Harvard study, the effective
ness of marijuana was tested against a
dummy drug in 22 patients with a var
iety of cancers. For patients who com
pleted the study, 12 of 15 cases involv

ing marijuana drug treatments re
sulted in at least a 50 percent reduction
in vomiting and nausea after therapy.
And in five of these treatments, the
patients suffered no nausea at all, the
report added.
Each treatment consisted of 15 to 20
milligram doses of THC, the first taken
two hours before cancer treatment and
the others two and six hours afterward.
Salan said a high-quality marijuana
cigarette contains about five millig
rams of THC.
There was no decrease in nausea or
vomiting in 14 cases in which placebo,
or dummy, treatment was used, the re
searchers said. In the "double-blind"
experiment, neither patients nor doc

tors knew in advance who got the real
or dummy drugs.
Patients in the study received the
marijuana orally in capsules contain
ing concentrations of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
the active ingredient in the drug re
sponsible for its euphoric effect.
The report said 81 percent of the pa
tients getting THC experienced a
"high," and that the most common
side effect was occasional drowsiness.
Regarding widespread commercial
use in the future, "I have no idea of
what the bureaucratic difficulties
would be," said Breeden. "If every
thing went smoothly, a few years. But
not right away, I'm sure of that."

who had leukemia and also smoked
pot noticed it lessened the nausea con
siderably and began "doing it on the
side to prevent it" specifically.
But a major problem, Hollister
noted, is that "a lot of people would
just as soon vomit as have a high," so
further work is being done io isolatethe
nausea-suppressing element in mari
juana from the euphoria-creating ele
ment.
The nausea and vomiting side ef
fects of the chemotherapy can become

severe enough to make it "psychologi
cally difficult for patients to accept
their treatment," said Breeden. It can
get to the point where just the thought
of the treatment will trigger nausea in
the patient, making him sick to his
stomach and creating a tremendous
psychological burden.
In addition, reaction to
chemotherapeutic drugs "usually gets
worse as time goes on," Breeden said.
The most recent experiments using
marijuana were conducted at the Har
vard Medical School. Dr. Stephen E.
Salan said that he and his colleagues
now "know how the cancer treatment
drugs that cause vomiting work. Most
of them trigger a part of the brain to

cause vomiting, as opposed to nausea
originating in the stomach. So, we can
assume that the marijuana somehow
works on the central nervous system to
block or repress the vomiting re
sponse,"
Salan said that about 75 percent of
the thousands of patients receiving
chemotherapy for cancer suffer mod
erate to extreme nausea and vomiting.
And of this group, ninety percent get
no relief from conventional anti
nausea drugs.
In the Harvard study, the effective
ness of marijuana was tested against a
dummy drug in 22 patients with a var
iety of cancers. For patients who com
pleted the study, 12 of 15 cases involv

ing marijuana drug treatments re
sulted in at least a 50 percent reduction
in vomiting and nausea after therapy.
And in five of these treatments, the
patients suffered no nausea at all, the
report added.
Each treatment consisted of 15 to 20
milligram doses of THC, the first taken
two hours before cancer treatment and
the others two and six hours afterward.
Salan said a high-quality marijuana
cigarette contains about five millig
rams of THC.
There was no decrease in nausea or
vomiting in 14 cases in which placebo,
or dummy, treatment was used, the re
searchers said. In the "double-blind"
experiment, neither patients nor doc

tors knew in advance who got the real
or dummy drugs.
Patients in the study received the
marijuana orally in capsules contain
ing concentrations of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
the active ingredient in the drug re
sponsible for its euphoric effect.
The report said 81 percent of the pa
tients getting THC experienced a
"high," and that the most common
side effect was occasional drowsiness.
Regarding widespread commercial
use in the future, "I have no idea of
what the bureaucratic difficulties
would be," said Breeden. "If every
thing went smoothly, a few years. But
not right away, I'm sure of that."
Marijuana is far more effective than
any other drug in relieving the vomit
ing and nausea that plague thousands
of patients undergoing chemical
therapy for cancer (chemotherapy), re
searchers say.
"It's been known anecdotally for
quite a few years," said Dr. Jim
Breeden,a chemotherapist in the on
cology department of the Medical
Center. "A lot of drugs you can use for
nausea. Unfortunately they are very
ineffective. Results reported (using
marijuana) are significantly better
than you could get from anything else
available."
Dr. Leo Hollister, a psychophar-

macologist at the Palo Alto Veteran's
Hospital, said the discovery resulted
from an "if you listen to what the pa
tients have to say, you might learn
something" approach. A young man
who had leukemia and also smoked
pot noticed it lessened the nausea con
siderably and began "doing it on the
side to prevent it" specifically.
