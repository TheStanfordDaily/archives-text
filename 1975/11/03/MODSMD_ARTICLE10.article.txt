# Women could reverse sorority ban
## 
### 
Although eight national
sororities have expressed an in
terest in opening houses here, it
is doubtful that even freshmen
will see the day that Alpha Phi or
any other chapter is allowed to
set up headquarters.
But the topic probably will not
be dormant this year. The issue
likely will give Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Norton as
many headaches as last year,
when he had fraternity members
and alumni breathing down his
neck.
It is likely that the sex dis
crimination issue which pro
voked last year's confrontation
will be revived. Women are still
not given the exact same oppor
tunities for campus housing.
This year, if the Committee on
Services to Students (COSS) ex
amines the discrimination issue,
it is doubtful they will find
another loophole such as forcing
frats to overcrowd.
Serious obstacles
There are two principal obsta
cles that the sororities and their
supporters will have to over
come before they can be given a
serious chance of returning.

The first is last year's report
from COSS's subcommittee,
which said that it would vote to
remove the current fraternities'
subjective selectivity, rather
than extend it to any other
groups. (That was last year's
subcommittee, not this year's.)
The second difficulty involves
the 1944 ban by the Board of
Trustees which followed 10
years of intense competition
among women for sorority posi
tions. Administrators have ac
cepted this ban, despite the ob
vious fact that the same situation
does not apply today as 30 years
ago.
It is further doubtful that if
sororities returned the competi
tion in the forseeable future
would come close to that of the
1930s and 19405. Indeed, it is
more likely that they will have
difficulty filling spaces than
turning down women.
Does interest exist?
This brings up the crucial
question of whether there is
enough interest to allocate pre
cious housing space to
sororities. At first glance, it ap
pears that women would rather

live in coed housing.
Roth and Storey, the remain
ing all-women's houses, have
hardly been the most popular in
the draw; the most recent statis
tics show them to be toward the
bottom.
Some of the students residing
in the houses would rather be
elsewhere and some of those
who want to be in Storey and
Roth would rather not join a
sorority.
Last year's efforts to generate
support for the return of
sororities were not successful
enough to make an impression
on the administration or mem
bers of COSS.
But these indications do not
mean that if sororities were es

tablished on campus they would
be empty. Most of the fraternities
have had little problem filling
their spaces despite the fact that
many Stanford males wouldn't
be caught dead in one.
Just as there is a cerain aura
that attracts males to frats, there
is likely to be a certain aura
that would attract females to
sororities.
Of course, one cannot be cer
tain of this. But the gamble
seems to be worth taking if
enough women show interest.
While interest certainly does not
indicate success (remember
Stanford-in-Stanford) it is a
necessary prerequisite.
If sororities are to return, it is
not up to the various chapters,
but more importantly up to Stan
ford women (and men who be
lieve the discrimination to be
real) to press the University to
change its position. This isn't
1944.

years of intense competition
among women for sorority posi
tions. Administrators have ac
cepted this ban, despite the ob
vious fact that the same situation
does not apply today as 30 years
ago.
It is further doubtful that if
sororities returned the competi
tion in the forseeable future
would come close to that of the
1930s and 19405. Indeed, it is
more likely that they will have
difficulty filling spaces than
turning down women.
Does interest exist?
This brings up the crucial
question of whether there is
enough interest to allocate pre
cious housing space to
sororities. At first glance, it ap
pears that women would rather

live in coed housing.
Roth and Storey, the remain
ing all-women's houses, have
hardly been the most popular in
the draw; the most recent statis
tics show them to be toward the
bottom.
Some of the students residing
in the houses would rather be
elsewhere and some of those
who want to be in Storey and
Roth would rather not join a
sorority.
Last year's efforts to generate
support for the return of
sororities were not successful
enough to make an impression
on the administration or mem
bers of COSS.
But these indications do not
mean that if sororities were es

tablished on campus they would
be empty. Most of the fraternities
have had little problem filling
their spaces despite the fact that
many Stanford males wouldn't
be caught dead in one.
Just as there is a cerain aura
that attracts males to frats, there
is likely to be a certain aura
that would attract females to
sororities.
Of course, one cannot be cer
tain of this. But the gamble
seems to be worth taking if
enough women show interest.
While interest certainly does not
indicate success (remember
Stanford-in-Stanford) it is a
necessary prerequisite.
If sororities are to return, it is
not up to the various chapters,
but more importantly up to Stan
ford women (and men who be
lieve the discrimination to be
real) to press the University to
change its position. This isn't
1944.

Although eight national
sororities have expressed an in
terest in opening houses here, it
is doubtful that even freshmen
will see the day that Alpha Phi or
any other chapter is allowed to
set up headquarters.
But the topic probably will not
be dormant this year. The issue
likely will give Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Norton as
many headaches as last year,
when he had fraternity members
and alumni breathing down his
neck.
It is likely that the sex dis
crimination issue which pro
voked last year's confrontation
will be revived. Women are still
not given the exact same oppor
tunities for campus housing.
This year, if the Committee on
Services to Students (COSS) ex
amines the discrimination issue,
it is doubtful they will find
another loophole such as forcing
frats to overcrowd.
Serious obstacles
There are two principal obsta
cles that the sororities and their
supporters will have to over
come before they can be given a
serious chance of returning.

The first is last year's report
from COSS's subcommittee,
which said that it would vote to
remove the current fraternities'
subjective selectivity, rather
than extend it to any other
groups. (That was last year's
subcommittee, not this year's.)
The second difficulty involves
the 1944 ban by the Board of
Trustees which followed 10
years of intense competition
among women for sorority posi
tions. Administrators have ac
cepted this ban, despite the ob
vious fact that the same situation
does not apply today as 30 years
ago.
It is further doubtful that if
