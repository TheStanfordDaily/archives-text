# Bilingual ballots fight discrimination
## 
### 
Williamßoss'scri ticisms of the
language-minority amendments
to the voting Rights Act (Daily,
Oct. 28) add to the misconcep
tions about the "bilingual bal
lot."
Ross asserts that if one is a na
tive or naturalized citizen, one
theoretically can read and write
English. Those citizens who
cannot, must "take little interest
in American life." Therefore,
Ross concludes "it seems un
necessary to make special ac
comodations for persons who
have purposely isolated them
selves from the mainstream of
national life."
This reasoning is patronizing,
condescending and fails to deal
with concrete conditions in the
Chinese-American community.
Enactment of Public Law
94-73, amending the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, represented
the culmination of a protracted
effort by language minority citi
zens throughout the United
States to attain equality in exer
cising the right to vote.
Congress found that: "voting
discrimination against citizens
of language minorities is perva
sive and national in scope ..."
and that "where State and local
governments conduct elections
only in English, language minor
ity citizens are excluded from
participating in the electoral
process."
In California, such discrimina
tion was de jure: it was only in
1943 that all Chinese were no
longer deemed ineligible to vote.
Any primer on American his
tory instructs that taxation with
out reprersentation a status ex
perienced by virtually all
Chinese-Americans today—
condemns the taxpayer to severe
deprivations.
Thus, Congress also stated in
the amendment that:" . . . the
denial of the right to vote of such
minority group citizens is ordi
narily directly related to the un
equal educational opportunities

afforded them, resulting in high
illiteracy and voting
participation ..."
Congress designed the 1975
voting rights amendments to al
leviate the circular dilemma of
educational and social poverty
created by disenfranchisement
which, in turn, assures con
tinued deprivation.
The U.S. Supreme Court's
unanimous decision in Lau v.
Nichols, (1974), further supports
the congressional findings. In
that case, the Court held that
Chinese American children had
been denied equal educational
opportunity by the San Fran
cisco Unified School District.
Minorities benefit
Let's examine the case of San
Francisco when its higher
than-nationwide-average illiter
acy rate. Two minority groups,
Chinese and Spanish-speaking
citizens, are entitled under Sec.
203 to full benefit of the Act.
Nearly 100,000 residents of
each group live in San Francisco
while only 20.000 are registered
to vote.

Here, the City has ludicrously
argued that the
constitutionally-mandated,
right to vote costs too much. As
Chinatown groups such as
Chinese for Affirmative Action
report, the City sent out for mul
tilingual, election materials.
Unfortunately, the notice at
tracted no new voters since per
sons previously not registered to
vote failed to receive it.
The Citys "remedy" currently
calls for assistance to be pro
vided at the polling place— for
those who ask for it placing the
entire burden on the minority
citizen. This is precisely what
the new law is designed toavoid.
Ross ignored ghettoes
If Ross had really investigated
the ghetto communities i.n
Stanford's backyard, he might
have discovered that the Justice
Department has aided in San
Francisco's noncompliance with
the law. In fact, Assistant Attor
ney General }. Stanley Pottinger
has issued interim regulations
contravening the voting law he
is supposed to implement.

Minority community organi
zations have responded by filing
a class-action suit in Federal Dis
trict Court against the City and
the U.S. Attorney General.
Thus, Ross, contention that
the Justice Dept. is fighting" im
agined injustice" in a fit of
bureaucratic, self-preservation
remains unsubstantiated in the
case of San Francisco. One be
gins to question how Ross has
interpreted the other evidence
he cites for chicanos and Native
Americans.
