We wish to respond to the Oct.
31 Daily article concerning the
decision to use Honeycomb
house temporarily as the resi
dence of Provost William
Miller's family.
We are confident that Hon
eycomb will be used as we in
tended when we gave our home
to Stanford.
The campaign for funds to
endow the University Visiting
Professorship and to maintain
Honeycomb as the residence of
the distinguished visiting pro
fessor, is proceeding well. It is
our expectation that within a
year, the necessary funds will be
forthcoming.
But until the funds are in
hand, the Board of Trustees can
not proceed with the selection of
a visiting professor to live in the
residence, nor to employ a per
manent caretaker couple to re
side in the attached apartment.
The residence cannot be left
vacant until these pre-requisites
are completed. Security and fire
considerations prohibit a vacant
residence.
We are completely in accord
with the decision of President
Richard Lyman and the Trustees
to ask the Provost to occupy
Honeycomb in the interim. We
know that Honeycomb has al
ready been the site of several
large dinnerparties in which the
Millers have hosted guests of
considerable importance to
Stanford's welfare.
We, the donors of Honeycomb,
are happy that our home can be
put to such good interim use.

As chief business and finan
cial officer, it is my judgment
that the use of the Honeycomb
House as a residence for Provost
William Miller represents a wise
use of university resources. Ex
penses for taxes, maintenance
and custodial care already are a
responsibility of the university
as owner, and incremental ex
penses associated with the
Provost's occupancy are quite
modest. Because of widespread
interest in the Honeycomb
House, its use for official enter
taining is most attractive and
valuable.
Furthermore, it extends the
ability of the university to under
take such entertaining — an abil
ity which 1 am sure represents a
welcome relief to President and
Mrs. Richard Lyman who hereto
fore have shouldered almost the
entire burden.

Honor Code
While an honor code would
idealistically relieve the instruc
tor of his role as disciplinarian
and motivate the student to rely
on his own moralistic values, it
fails to do either. The teacher
remains a disciplinarian insofar
as he checks to see whether the
student has signed the honor
code.
A true code of honor would
not involve such ineffective at
tempts to get students to attest to
their virtuosity at the beginning
of every test.
Neither is the potentially
cheating student disuaded from
violations the sort of which the
code tries to stay. Rather he is
infested with the pretence that a
hollow signature exonerates his
guilt, a pretence which he may
guilefully carry out of the uni
versity with him
The code neither ameliorates
the moral trespass nor implants
any virtue.
Ironically, the very code
which expounds trustworthi
ness, bereaves the moral anal
phabet of any mores at all, and
rather instills a lack of respect for
honor. The habitual code signer
becomes jaded by the institu
tion. The honor code signature
becomes rather a medium of
equivocation.
Moralistically, the honor code
fails miserably. Pragmatically, it
leads to a bifurcation of intent
and result. The scrupulous stu
dent is insulted and dismayed by
the futility: the criminal is ab
solved.
Prudentially, I find it impossi
ble to acknowledge the honor
codes' designs, which have be
come warped in its implementa
tion. I refuse to debase myself by
participating in a system which
defeats its own purpose, and
which expounds action, thereby
corrupting virtuosity.

We wish to respond to the Oct.
31 Daily article concerning the
decision to use Honeycomb
house temporarily as the resi
dence of Provost William
Miller's family.
We are confident that Hon
eycomb will be used as we in
tended when we gave our home
to Stanford.
The campaign for funds to
endow the University Visiting
Professorship and to maintain
Honeycomb as the residence of
the distinguished visiting pro
fessor, is proceeding well. It is
our expectation that within a
year, the necessary funds will be
forthcoming.
But until the funds are in
hand, the Board of Trustees can
not proceed with the selection of
a visiting professor to live in the
residence, nor to employ a per
manent caretaker couple to re
side in the attached apartment.
The residence cannot be left
vacant until these pre-requisites
are completed. Security and fire
considerations prohibit a vacant
residence.
We are completely in accord
with the decision of President
Richard Lyman and the Trustees
to ask the Provost to occupy
Honeycomb in the interim. We
know that Honeycomb has al
ready been the site of several
large dinnerparties in which the
Millers have hosted guests of
considerable importance to
Stanford's welfare.
We, the donors of Honeycomb,
are happy that our home can be
put to such good interim use.

As chief business and finan
cial officer, it is my judgment
that the use of the Honeycomb
House as a residence for Provost
William Miller represents a wise
use of university resources. Ex
penses for taxes, maintenance
and custodial care already are a
responsibility of the university
as owner, and incremental ex
penses associated with the
Provost's occupancy are quite
modest. Because of widespread
interest in the Honeycomb
House, its use for official enter
taining is most attractive and
valuable.
Furthermore, it extends the
ability of the university to under
take such entertaining — an abil
ity which 1 am sure represents a
welcome relief to President and
Mrs. Richard Lyman who hereto
fore have shouldered almost the
entire burden.

Honor Code
While an honor code would
idealistically relieve the instruc
tor of his role as disciplinarian
and motivate the student to rely
on his own moralistic values, it
fails to do either. The teacher
remains a disciplinarian insofar
as he checks to see whether the
student has signed the honor
code.
A true code of honor would
not involve such ineffective at
tempts to get students to attest to
their virtuosity at the beginning
of every test.
Neither is the potentially
cheating student disuaded from
violations the sort of which the
code tries to stay. Rather he is
infested with the pretence that a
hollow signature exonerates his
guilt, a pretence which he may
guilefully carry out of the uni
versity with him
The code neither ameliorates
the moral trespass nor implants
any virtue.
Ironically, the very code
which expounds trustworthi
ness, bereaves the moral anal
phabet of any mores at all, and
rather instills a lack of respect for
honor. The habitual code signer
becomes jaded by the institu
tion. The honor code signature
becomes rather a medium of
equivocation.
Moralistically, the honor code
fails miserably. Pragmatically, it
leads to a bifurcation of intent
and result. The scrupulous stu
dent is insulted and dismayed by
the futility: the criminal is ab
solved.
Prudentially, I find it impossi
ble to acknowledge the honor
codes' designs, which have be
come warped in its implementa

defeats its own purpose, and
