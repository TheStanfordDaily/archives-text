# Laboratory receives new spectrometer

### DAVE SARTORIS 
One of the most powerful nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometers in the world was recently dedicated at
Stanford, in conjunction with a two-day conference on
molecular structural methods in biological research.
The instrument, which cost $360,000, was financed
by a joint grant from the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and the National Institute of Health (NIH).
According to Prof. Oleg Jardetzky, head of the new
Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory, the value of
the Stanford spectrometer lies in its operation at high
frequencies and a strong (80 kilomgauss) magnetic
field.
"With this instrument, we are able to investigate the
dynamics as well as the structure of complex biological
molecules. Its finer resolution allows analysis of large
molecules as units, rather than atom-by-atom as was
previously necessary, said Jardelsky.
"Earlier methods were like trying to understand the
Empire State Building by looking into just one of its
windows," he commented.
The device also allows observation of molecules as
they change with time, as during the course of a biologi
cal reaction.
Protein model
"We can infer manj things about the dynamic move
ments of these molecules in their biologically-active
states," said Jardetzky. "We are now in a position to
develop a model of a protein as it functions in the living
cell."
The Stanford spectrometer is one of three such in
struments in existence, all less than a year old. The other
two are at Bell Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey
and a research facility in Groningen, the Netherlands.
The original planning for the Stanford Magnetic Re
sonance Laboratory was carried out in 1970-71 by an
informal group consisting of Profs. J.D. Baldeschwieler
(Chemistry) and Jardetzky.
Upon announcement of the joint NSF-NIH grant in

June 1972, the first committee for the Laboratory, con
sisting of Jardetzky, McConnell and Applied Physics
Prof. Calvin Quate, was appointed by the provost and
charged with the responsibility of selecting the core
instrumentation.
After extensive investigation of possible alternatives,
a system based on an Oxford Instruments magnet with
Bruker electronics was chosen.
National resource
Originally envisioned as a regional facility, theLabor
tory presently has more the character of a national re
source, according to Jardetzky.
"During the past year, 46 investigators from the Un
ited States and abroad have used the facilities, in large
part for exploratory experiments to evaluate the poten
tial of high-frequency, high-resolution NMR (nuclear

magnetic resonance) in thesolution ot chemical, biolog
ical, and medical problems," said Jardetzky.
The spectrometer operates 24hours a day, every day,
with six days per week available for general users. Four
hours per week are scheduled for routine maintenance
and an average of 20 hours per week are devoted to
"core research."
About half of the spectrometer's operating time, or
some 72 hours per week, is available to investigators
outside Stanford.
Some of the studies underway at the Laboratory in
clude looking at how protein structures change when
drugs are added to them. Researchers are also studying
mechanisms of genetic control, cell membranes, drugs
and their effects on enzymes, and the three-dimensional
geometry of protein molecules.
