Donald Kennedy, professor of biology and chairman of the
Program in Human Biology, withdrew himself as a candidate
for the presidency of the University of Chicago a few weeks ago.
Rumors throughout the summer claimed Kennedy was the
leading candidate to receive the appointment as University of
Chicago president. "There was no one single factor in my
withdrawing," Kennedy said.
"1 took about six weeks to think about it and I cooled off on it.
I'm more enthusiastic on doing things here," Kennedy exp
lained.
Kennedy had visited the University of Chicago campus twice
in early July and met with faculty and student groups there.
Kennedy added that his withdrawal "was not precipitated by
an offer. It was still quite tentative on both sides."
Kennedy stated he would not accept any future offer for the
position at the University of Chicago.
