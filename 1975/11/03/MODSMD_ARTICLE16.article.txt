## Cardinals escape day of Pac-8 upsets Beavers beaten, 28-22 
### RON BECK 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — On a day
when upsets plagued almost all
of the Pacific-Eight favorites,
Stanford's football team barely
avoided one of its own, when a
surprisingly effective Oregon
State squad battled to a 28-22
loss.
The Cards built up a 28-7 half
time lead, and watr'ied as the
Beavers drew to within six
points late in the game. The OSU
defense shut out Stanford in the
second half, and its offense
scored twice, almost enough to
put an end to the Beavers'
seven-game losing streak.
Prompted by the inability of
his team to win a game this sea
son, and the troubles concurrent
with coaching at a small country
school, OSU Head Football
Coach Dee Andros announced
his resignation after the game.
"I will step down as head foot
ball coach at Oregon State Uni
versity after 11 years at the head
coaching position," Andros de
clared. "I'm doing it as of now to
try to take pressure off my foot
ball team for the next three
weeks.
More relaxed
"1 want them to go out and
play the next three games a little
more relaxed, but with the same
intensity that they played
today."
The intensity Andros talked
about was there only in the sec
ond half, though. The Beavers
rushed for over 160 yards in the
final periods, maintaining long
drives that were ended only by

their own miscues. Overall, the
Beavers netted 300 yards rush
ing and passing, only four less
than Stanford.
But the first half belonged to
the Cards and quarterback Guy
Benjamin. As Head Coach Jack
Christiansen had intimated he
would do all week long, he put
Benjamin in early in the second
quarter.
Starting quarterback Mike
Cordova had hit on four of nine
passes in the first quarter and the
beginning of the second, but was
unable to lead the Cards to any
touchdowns. Stanford was con
sistently stopped before the goal
line, and was forced to settle Tor
two Mike Langford field goals.
"Mike (Cordova) moved the
ballclub well in he first half, but
we just didn't move it in all the
way," explained Christiansen. "1
had promised to put Guy in
early, so we told him to go in."
Benjamin appeared nervous in
his first two series. On his first
pass attempt, Benjamin threw a
forced pass right into the hands
of an OSU defender, setting up
the Beavers' only first-half score.
It took OSU nine plays to drive
the ball 46 yards for a touch
down and a 7-6 lead.
The Card defense held OSU
without a first down. Linebacker
Ray Cardinalli blocked the
Beaver punt attempt, and Jeff
Barton ran the ball in for a
touchdown, putting the Cards
on top for good.
Benjamin's next two series
were reminiscent of his play
against Washington State only

one week earlier. On a
third-and-10 situation, Benja
min threw a swing pass to full
back Ron Inge that went for 15
yards. A nine-yard completion
to Inge on the next play, fol
lowed by a 17-yarder to flanker
Tony Hill on the one and all Ben
jamin had to do was dive over
the line for the touchdown.
Another TD
Rich Merlo recovered a fum
bled OSU pitchout two minutes
later on the Beaver 31, and on the
first play Benjamin hit Inge for
another touchdown, making the
score 28-7 at the end of the first
half.
The second-half showed a re
markable turnaround by both
teams. Suddenly Benjamin, sur
prised at being called on to start
the second-half couldn't take the
team anywhere.
Cordova came in at the start of
the fourth quarter, but was un
able to penetrate past the Oregon
48. Meanwhile, the Card defense
had been on the field for almost
the entire third quarter and
much of the fourth. ... In that
time, the defense gave up two
touchdowns, one coming on a
fake field goal attempt which
saw Steve Gervais, the holder,
run nine yards for the score.
Cordova fi nally led the team in
a time-consuming march down
the field. The Cards held onto
the ball for overfour minutes late
in the final quarter, finally giv
ing the ball back after Langford
missed a 34-yard field goal that
would have put the game out of
reach.
End the rally
So with less than two minutes
left, the Beavers had the ball on
their own 20. But linebacker Geb
Church broke through the line
twice in a row to sack the Beaver
quarterback for losses and end
any chance for an upset.
"We're happy to win," said
Christiansen after the game. "We
knew that they're the kind of
team that if you give them a cou
ple of breaks, they're big enough
and strong enough to compete
with anyone.
"Guy thew some great and
then some not-so-great," Chris
analyzed. With USC coming up
on the road next week, and a win
necessary to stay on top of the
Pac-8 race, it looks as if Christ
iansen may have already de
cided who he's going to start at
quarterback.
"It's hard to evaluate them
now," he said. "We'll have to
look at the game films and see.
But as I said last week, I see no
reason to break up a winning
combination at this time."

BEAVER TRAP—Linebacker Geb Church (90) seals a Stanford
victory by tossing OSU quarterback Kyle Grossart for an 11-yard
loss on third down in the closing minute of Saturday's game. The
sack moved the Beavers back to their own 20, and forced Grossart
to throw into the teeth of a Stanford zone defense on the next play.
The pass fell incomplete.
