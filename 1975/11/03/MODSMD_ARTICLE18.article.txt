# OSU's Andros resigns
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — You rarely see football
Coach Jack Christiansen cry after a game. Hell,
you could probably count the times on one hand.
Those occasions are usually reserved for the
dressing room of the Los Angeles Coliseum,
a last-second loss to USC or UCLA. But Saturday,
after a 28-22 Stanford win over Oregon State,
Chris was in tears.
After hearing that Oregon State Coach Dee An
dros was stepping down after 11 years in Corval
lis, Christiansen rushed up to Andros' office,
where the press conference was taking place.
"Don't you quit coaching, you bastard,"
shouted a red-faced Christiansen, with tears
streaming from his eyes. The two men embraced,
and Chris left almost as hurriedly as he had en
tered the room.
No straight face
To say it was an emotional scene is an under
statement. Aren't college football coaches sup
posd to maintain their Bud Wilkinson-straight
faces? Andros, who played under Wilkinson at
Oklahoma in 1950, certainly doesn't fit into that
mold, and neither does Chris.
The "Great Pumpkin," as Andros is nicknamed,
has been one of the most colorful coaches in the
Pacific Eight. He came to Oregon State with a
tough act to follow and performed well.
In 1964, after Tommy Prothro had left OSU just
after leading the Beavers to a Rose Bowl, Oregon
State surprised everyone by naming Andros to
replace Prothro.
He had made a good impression on Beaver fans

when his Idaho Vandals almost upset that OSU
Rose Bowl team. His first six seasons were all
winning years, and he also provided some of the
best excitement in college football during those
seasons.
Those times are history now. Oregon State
hasn't had a winning season in five years and
Andros has been able to save his job only by beat
ing traditional rival Oregon. Saturday's 28-22 loss
to the Cards was the eighth straight Beaver loss
this season.
Never lost class
But although it may sound trite, Andros has
never lost his class. He's been nice to everyone —
players, fans and the press — through five losing
seasons.
The loss to Stanford was certainly frustrating to
Andros — his Beavers almost completed a day of
conference upsets. But his move wasn't a rash
one. "I thought about it before today," Andros
told a stunned press corps. "If we had scored and
won, this press conference wouldn't have been
called."
He could have given the news to his team at
halftime — and who knows, they might have pul
led it off. But he didn't use this Knute Rockne
trick.
Andros is simply a guy with a lot of class. As he
stared at his momentoeson the office wall he said,
"I came here with class and I wanted to leave with
class."
With that, most coaches would have gotten up
and left. Andros waited until the last reporter had
finished.

CORVALLIS, Ore. — You rarely see football
Coach Jack Christiansen cry after a game. Hell,
you could probably count the times on one hand.
Those occasions are usually reserved for the
dressing room of the Los Angeles Coliseum,
a last-second loss to USC or UCLA. But Saturday,
after a 28-22 Stanford win over Oregon State,
Chris was in tears.
After hearing that Oregon State Coach Dee An
dros was stepping down after 11 years in Corval
lis, Christiansen rushed up to Andros' office,
where the press conference was taking place.
"Don't you quit coaching, you bastard,"
shouted a red-faced Christiansen, with tears
streaming from his eyes. The two men embraced,
and Chris left almost as hurriedly as he had en
tered the room.
No straight face
To say it was an emotional scene is an under
statement. Aren't college football coaches sup
posd to maintain their Bud Wilkinson-straight
faces? Andros, who played under Wilkinson at
Oklahoma in 1950, certainly doesn't fit into that
mold, and neither does Chris.
The "Great Pumpkin," as Andros is nicknamed,
has been one of the most colorful coaches in the
Pacific Eight. He came to Oregon State with a
tough act to follow and performed well.
In 1964, after Tommy Prothro had left OSU just
after leading the Beavers to a Rose Bowl, Oregon
State surprised everyone by naming Andros to
replace Prothro.
He had made a good impression on Beaver fans

when his Idaho Vandals almost upset that OSU
Rose Bowl team. His first six seasons were all
winning years, and he also provided some of the
best excitement in college football during those
seasons.
Those times are history now. Oregon State
hasn't had a winning season in five years and
Andros has been able to save his job only by beat
ing traditional rival Oregon. Saturday's 28-22 loss
to the Cards was the eighth straight Beaver loss
this season.
Never lost class
But although it may sound trite, Andros has
never lost his class. He's been nice to everyone —
players, fans and the press — through five losing
seasons.
The loss to Stanford was certainly frustrating to
Andros — his Beavers almost completed a day of
conference upsets. But his move wasn't a rash
one. "I thought about it before today," Andros
told a stunned press corps. "If we had scored and
won, this press conference wouldn't have been
called."
He could have given the news to his team at
halftime — and who knows, they might have pul
led it off. But he didn't use this Knute Rockne
trick.
