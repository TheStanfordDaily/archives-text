# Cal stuns USC

### DAVE SMITH 
BERKELEY—USC's lame
duck coach John McKay, who
next year will head NFL
doormat-to-be Tampa, got an
early taste of losing Saturday.
But his future employers proba
bly weren't too pleased at the
way he managed it.
McKay's widely-feared Tro
jans faced their first really strong
opponent of the season, the
California Bears — and paid the
price of an early-season
pushover schedule by coming
up clawed, 28-14.
Blame the Bears' last seven on
McKay. When California's bril
liant tailback Chuck Muncie
fumbled at the end of a long run
at the USC 9, even the Bear Back
ers in the large crowd could
sense that USC, down by a
touchdown with three minutes
left in the game, might be ready
to show some real offense.
But two Trojan runs could
gain only seven yards, and then
McKay ordered his unimpres
sive quarterback, Vince Evans
(he completed three of 14 passes
in the game), to throw on third
down.
Awe-inspiring
The crowd was too busy won
dering who the pass had been

intended for to get the full im
pact of McKay's next decision:
on fourth and three from the USC
16, he ordered his men to go for
the first down.
Evans fumbled the snap, and
the Bears rumbled in for the
clinching touchdown a couple
of plays later, capping an amaz
ing offensive performance that
had suddenly made the Bears
favorites in a five-way race for
the Rose Bowl.
Muncie, who had to be helped
from the field twice because of
ankle injuries, showed enough
flashy moves to outgain the Tro
jans' national rushing leader
Ricky Bell, 143 yards to 121 —
and Muncie caught five passes
from quarterback Joe Roth and
averaged almost eight yards per
carry.
Kings Ricky
"I wasn't going in there to beat
Bell," said Muncie. "You can't
take nothing away from Ricky.
He's still young, and some day
he'll be the best in the country."'
Not on Saturday. The Bears
gang-tackled the Trojans' pow
erful tailback on every Trojan
drive but one, a frightening
seven-play series on which USC
drove 95 yards without a pass
and tied the score at 14-14.
But the Bears nationally first
ranked offense, led by poised JC
transfer Roth, devastated the
USC defense in the final period
as it had all game. At one point
Roth, who was never sacked by
thestymied USC line, completed
10 straight passes.
"1 don't know how he kept
finding those receivers," said
Cal coach Mike White, who
beamed even more when he
learned that Washington, led by
fullback Robin Earl's 169 yards
rushing, had dumped Pac-8
leader UCLA in the L.A. Col
iseum.
Cal's Vataha-sized receiver,
Steve Rivera, caught nine passes
and was consistently open in the
center of the USC zone. On the
rare occasions when he was co
vered Roth had plenty of time to
find Muncie, flanker Wesley
Walker or tight end George
Freitas, who made a diving
touchdown catch.
