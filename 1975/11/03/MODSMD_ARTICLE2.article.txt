# Environmentalists Oppose Bonfire

By STEPHEN CROLIUS
A hand-delivered letter from the Hay
Area Air Pollution Control District has
been received by ASSU President Lee
Rosenbaum urging that "some other
event be substituted for the Big Game
Rally Bonfire."
The letter states, "Each year, both
before and after the Bonfire, we gener
ally receive complaints from citizens
in the Palo Alto area concerning the air
pollutants released as a result of the
fire . . . .Consequently the Board has
asked the District staff to prevail upon
the appropriate Stanford officials to
substitute a more environmentally ac
ceptable event for the Bonfire."
Rosenbaum noted a passage of the
letter which reads "Although the Bon
fire technically falls within the categ
ory of a recreational fire and is there
fore exempt from our open burning
regulation,this District has serious re
servations about burning of the mag
nitude of the Big Game Bonfire."
"I think it's a real bureaucratic mess,"
Rosenbaum said. "The county fire
marshal has also previously tried to
stop the Bonfirel But as long as county
fire regulations are met he can't do
anything either."
"Another interesting point," Rosen
baum said, "is that nobody in the Uni
versity is taking any responsibility for
approving events that go on in the
lake." Last Tuesday on KZSU, Presi
dent Lyman did declare that this was
the responsibility of the dean of stu
dent affairs.
In a meeting held last Friday at
tended by Rosenbaum, Inter-

Fraternity Council President Bob Ot
tilie, Bonfire Chairman Bill Christ
opher, Stanford conservation group
representative Jim Barstow and Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Thomas Mas
sey, Ottilie urged that the Bonfire go
on as planned.
Ottilie said that preparations had al
ready begun on the Bonfire. "The time
for alternatives was about four weeks
ago," Ottilie said. "We're in the mid
dle of the Bonfire now. Bill's had his
committee going for a month. We've
got financial commitments now.
We've already contracted for materials
for the Bonfire."
But Rosenbaum warned, "I think
that if the Bonfire goes on this year, it
will be stopped next year. Someone
will legislate against it."


WEENIE ROASTâ€”ASSL! President Lee Rosenbaum, an opponent of the Bon
fire, has received a letter from the Bay Area Air Pollution Control District
urging a substitute for the Big Game Bonfire. However, Inter-Fraternity Coun
