Consistently coming up with
the big play, Stanford's JV foot
ball team coasted past Santa
Clara's JV's 59-13 Friday after
noon at Stanford Stadium. Nine
players contributed points to the
Cards' final total of 59.
The Cards got on the
scoreboard early when quarter
back Turk Schonert found wide
receiver John Kirst open over the
middle. Kirst made a fine catch
on the pass and eluded a number
of would-be tacklers for a
49-yard touchdown.
Santa Clara came back 10 mi
nutes later with a score of their
own on a fourth down one-yard
plunge. A two-point conversion
attempt failed, leaving Stanford
in the lead 7-6. This was as close
as Santa Clara would get to the
Cards.
Stanford came right back. Re
ceiver Larry Broussard beat the
Santa Clara defenders deep and
Schonert hit him with a perfect
strike for a 60-yard TD pass.
Schonert completed six out of
eleven passes on the day for 171
yards and two touchdowns.
If Schonert continues to play
as he has Stanford's quarterback

situation could be even more
muddled next year. Last week
Schonert connected on 26 of 37
passes for 371 yards and four
touchdowns.
Schonert, however, isn't the
only quarterback on the JV's.
Second string quarterback Joe
Rominger played quite a bit and
quite well,completing 12 out of
the 16 passes he attempted for
170 yards.
The first half ended with Stan
ford sitting atop a 31-6 lead.
In the third quarter both teams
settled down and played good
defensive football. The lone
score occurred when Cardinal
fullback Phil Francis dove over
the left side of the line from the
one-yard line for six points.
The Cards finished strong,
scoring three touchdowns in the
last three and a half minutes of
the game. With 3:17 left,
Rominger threw his second TD
pass of the game, this one to Matt
Lempress, increasing the Cardi
nal lead to 46-6. Santa Clara fi
nally got on the scoreboard again
on a 79-yard scoring pass, but it
was a case of far too little far too
late.

situation could be even more
muddled next year. Last week
Schonert connected on 26 of 37
passes for 371 yards and four
touchdowns.
Schonert, however, isn't the
only quarterback on the JV's.
Second string quarterback Joe
Rominger played quite a bit and
quite well,completing 12 out of
the 16 passes he attempted for
170 yards.
The first half ended with Stan
ford sitting atop a 31-6 lead.
In the third quarter both teams
settled down and played good
defensive football. The lone
score occurred when Cardinal
fullback Phil Francis dove over
the left side of the line from the
one-yard line for six points.
The Cards finished strong,
scoring three touchdowns in the
last three and a half minutes of
the game. With 3:17 left,
Rominger threw his second TD
pass of the game, this one to Matt
Lempress, increasing the Cardi
nal lead to 46-6. Santa Clara fi
nally got on the scoreboard again
on a 79-yard scoring pass, but it
was a case of far too little far too
late.
Consistently coming up with
the big play, Stanford's JV foot
ball team coasted past Santa
Clara's JV's 59-13 Friday after
noon at Stanford Stadium. Nine
players contributed points to the
Cards' final total of 59.
The Cards got on the
scoreboard early when quarter
back Turk Schonert found wide
receiver John Kirst open over the
middle. Kirst made a fine catch
on the pass and eluded a number
of would-be tacklers for a
49-yard touchdown.
Santa Clara came back 10 mi
nutes later with a score of their
own on a fourth down one-yard
plunge. A two-point conversion
attempt failed, leaving Stanford
in the lead 7-6. This was as close
as Santa Clara would get to the
Cards.
Stanford came right back. Re
ceiver Larry Broussard beat the
Santa Clara defenders deep and
Schonert hit him with a perfect
strike for a 60-yard TD pass.
Schonert completed six out of
eleven passes on the day for 171
yards and two touchdowns.
If Schonert continues to play
as he has Stanford's quarterback

situation could be even more
muddled next year. Last week
Schonert connected on 26 of 37
passes for 371 yards and four
touchdowns.
Schonert, however, isn't the
