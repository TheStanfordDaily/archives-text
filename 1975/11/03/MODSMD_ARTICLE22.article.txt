# Card booters lose, 2-0
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team
broke its two-game shutout win
ning streak and instead was
dumped by Canada College 2-0
at Harry Maloney Field Satur
day. The Cards record fell to
3-8-2.
Canada, probably the top
junior collegeteam in California,
had numerous chances for
scores and came up with its first
tally midway through the first
half. The Canada center bashed a
shot on goal from 15 feet out
which Stanford goalie Bruce
Mosbacher blocked, but the re
bound was easily put past the
sprawled goalie.
Taylor had a chance to put
Stanford on the scoreboard with
17 seconds left, but his free pen
alty kick hit the left crossbar and
bounced out, typical of
Stanford's day on the field.
"Our failure was that we
weren't able to capitalize on our
opportunities," Coach Bert Bal
daccini stated. "We just looked
tired and couldn't get our of
fense going." â€”JefTWehba
