# Poloists stay atop Pac-8

It took an emotional half time
lecture from Coach Art Lambert
to help the Cards boost their
Pacific Eight record to 3-0 with
an 11-5 win over the USC Tro
jans last Friday at deCuerre
Pools.
Stanford, which extended its
winning streak to 16 games,
found itself behind for the first
time in its string when USC
scored with two and a half mi
nutes remaining in the first quar
ter.
Before that, the Cards saw a
Rich Johannsen goal called back
by a penalty and four shots hit
the net posts. Stanford managed
to get out of the quarter with a
1-1 tie, when one minute after

the USC goal Paul Clark scored
from a pass by Doug Burke when
the Cards had a man advantage.
The Cards and Trojens then
traded goals in the second quar
ter until Tom Elson scored with
twelve seconds left to give Stan
ford a 4-3 lead at the half.
(JSC's chance to upset the
Cards then ended with the first
half buzzer.
"1 told them to put the ball in the
hold," said a disgusted Lambert
at halftime. The Cards were
operating their offense around
the perimeter of the net during
the first-half.
Stanford won the second half
opening sprint by a considerable
margin, and then reverted back
to its usual style of play, working
out of the hole. From that point,
the Cards blitzed the unsuspect
ing Trojans, 7-1, on two goals
apiece from Johannsen and
Marty Davis and single scores
from Burke, Tom Angelo and
Drew McDonald.
"We were just not playing our
game in the first half," said Lam
bert. "The aspect that pleased
me the most was that the guys
had enough confidence in them
selves. When they weren't play
ing well, they were able to shake
it off."
Although Stanford was keying

on the USC game, the Cards kept
their winning streak alive the
next day with a 10-6 victory over
UC-Santa Barbara in the second
part of the weekend double
header. Davis led Stanford's at
tack with four goals while Frank
Forencich, starting in place of
Dorst who did not suit up, held
UCSB to only three goals in the
first three quarters.
Stanford next travels down to
Los Angeles where the Cards
have their biggest weekend left.
They meet UCLA this Friday at 3
p.m. and USC on Saturday at 11
a.m.
"If we win these two games,
we'll win the conference. But if
we lose to the Bruins it'll be a
different story," said Lambert.
UCLA is only one game behind
the Cards with a 2-1 record in the
Pac-8.
According to Lambert, the
Cards will have to play better
against UCLA than they did a
few weeks ago in their 3-2 vic
tory. The Bruins will be playing
in their own pool, which is nar
rower than what the Cards are
used to playing in.
"This difference in the pools
bothers me, but I'm particularly
disturbed that we haven't been
able to put a game away when
we've had the chance. We just
seem to slack off," Lambert said.
