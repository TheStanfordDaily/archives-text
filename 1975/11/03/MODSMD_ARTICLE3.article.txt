MADRID, Spain — Spanish sources
reported that Moroccan troops crossed
into the Spanish Sahara yesterday and
battled local inhabitants while Prince
Juan Carlos de Borbon, Spain's new
leader, was encouraging his troops
only 40 miles away.
Moroccan authorities denied the re
ports.
According to the Madrid sources,
the action in the northeast corner of the
Spanish Sahara was one of a series of
recent frontier violations and although
they said there were some casualties
they did not say how many.
The sources said their information

came from persons in the Sahara who
reported that members of the Polisario
Front, which is opposed to Morrocco's
claim to the mineral-rich area, battled
the Moroccans.
Morocco's information minister,
Ahmed Taibi Benhima, told newsmen
in Agadir, Morocco, that he "categori
cally denied" all reports that Moroc
can troops had crossed the frontier.
He added, "It cannot be ruled out,
however, that Sahara residents seek
ing reunification with the mother
country, Morocco, may have raised the
Moroccan flag at certain points that
may have been evacuated by the
Spanish Army."
Prince Juan Carlos put on a general's
uniform and flew to the territorial cap
ital of El Aaiun to declare that Spain
would not bow to Moroccans massed
along the border for an unarmed march
into the Sahara.
"Spain will fulfill its promises," the
37-year-old prince told desert troops.
"A salute and embrace to you from one
who wants to be the first soldier of
Spain."
He arrived in El Aaiun shortly before
midday and was back in Madrid by
evening where he went into an urgent
meeting with government and military
leaders.
Just 300 miles north of the Spanish
Saharan border, thousands of cheering
Moroccans lined the streets of Agadir
as King Hassan II moved his headquar
ters closer to the starting point for the
"March of Conquest."
Moroccan officials have said the
march by 350,000 unarmed civilians
will begin by Thursday. Spanish dip
lomats at the United Nations said it
was expected to begin tomorrow.
There were growing fears of a milit
ary confrontation between the two
countries after the breakdown of bilat
eral negotiations that had been ex
pected to lead to Spain ceding to
Morocco the northern part of the ter
ritory. Spain, which colonized the
mineral-rich land in 1884 and has been
making plans to withdraw, said at the
United Nations that it would use
armed force if necessary to stop the
Moroccan march.
The U.N. Security Council urged
yesterday that all parties to the dispute
— also including Mauritania and
Algeria — avoid any action "which
might further escalate tension."

The prince's lightning trip was his
first public move since taking power
three days ago from Gen. Francisco
Franco. The old generalissimo has
been near death for two weeks
