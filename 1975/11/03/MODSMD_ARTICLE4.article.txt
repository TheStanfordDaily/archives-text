# Lyman, COP to call honor code review
## 
### STEVE HEFTER 
ThtASSU Council of Presidents and
President Richard Lyman tentatively
agreed Friday to ask the Student Con
duct Legislative COUNCIL (skac) to
reassess Stanford's Honor Code.
According to ASSU vice-president
Dave Galligan, the joint request came
in response to growing questions con
cerning academic honesty at Stanford.
Those questions have multiplied in
recent weeks following the annual re
port from University Ombudsman
John Goheen indicating considerable
disregard of the Honor Code.
Goheen, an emeritus professor of
philosophy, serving his second term as
ombudsman, blamed "unevenness in
grading" and"the breakdown of ordi
nary standards of honesty" for placing
the Code in jeopardy. He stressed that
"a reassessment of the whole Honor
Code and its relevance to this point in
time is now desirable."
Galligan said Goheen's report was
probably a major factor in President
Lyman's decision to have the Code ex
amined by the SCLC, the committee in
charge of promulgating legislation
governing student conduct.
Galligan noted, however, that a
problem exists in giving the SCLC
such a task.
Special election
The committee is designed to consist
of six faculty, two ex-officio members
and three elected students, but no stu
dents have run for any of the positions.
Therefore, Galligan said, a special
election would probably have to be
called.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
said. "No one ran for the committee
because no one knows what it is." He
says the committee has been inopera
tive for the past four years.
Two years ago, Rosenbaum was

elected to the SCLC, but it never met.
He said he called the chairperson to
ask when the committee would con
sider important honor code questions
in light of bomb threats during mid
terms and otherdubious activities,and
was told the issue wasn't important.
Rosenbaum said the Honor Code
should have been reassessed at least
two years ago and said he believes
"something political" prevented its
examination.
Today, no one, including Assistant
to the President Bill Stone, Dean of
Students James Lyons. Legal Advisor
to the President James Siena, the COP
nor past SCLC chairpersons, hows ex
actly when the SCLC last met.
Figures available
But all are aware that
Honor Code violations have occurred .
The figures are available.
Last year, according to Siena, there
were 11 Honor Code charges, all of
which were reported by faculty. Of the
11. accused students, he says, 10 were
found guilty and seven were sus
pended for one quarter.
Similar numbers, he added, were
reported in the previous two years.
Siena emphasized that the Honor
Code rests with students policing
themselves and noted that only one or
two students a year have been turning
in peers for cheating.
These facts lead him to conclude
"that if cheating is as widespread as
people say it is. then students aren't
turning in violators." In addition,
Siena said faculty members are violat
ing the Honor Code by proctoring
exams.
A survey
To evaluate the extend of Honor
Code violations, Siena suggested that a
survey be taken and in the memoran
dum to the SCLC to be finalized next
week President Lyman and the COP re
commend that the SCLC conduct a
survey of students, faculty and
alumni.
President Lyman also noted in the
memorandum that surveys at other
universities have produced some dis
tressing findings.
At Johns Hopkins University, for in
stance. a 51-year old honor system was
abandoned last spring after a student
poll revealed that almost 30 percent of
all undergraduates had cheated by
their senior year.
In addition,about 70 percent of all
undergraduates said they had seen
cheating take place.
At UC Davis, a 1974 survey found
that 75.4 percent of the under

graduates said they would not report
another student cheating. A recent re
port by a faculty member there charac
terized the present status of the code as
a joke.
'Little value on honesty'
The report indicated that 16 percent
of the students admitted they had
cheated at one time or another. It also
commented that students felt that
"society at large seems to place little
value on honesty."
Although no formal survey has been
taken here as yet, students interviewed
by the Daily seem to indicate that re
sults of such a survey may be equally
pleasing.
Dave Cooper, a senior biology major
who transferred here from UC Davis
last year, said the honor codes at both
schools are similar, but it wasn't until
he came to Stanford that he saw cheat
ing.
He said that last year, during a final
exam, he and other students noticed a
girl blatantly copying from his paper.
He asked the girl to stop, he said, and
someone in the next row poked her
and told her to "cut it out."
'Not a cop'
Cooper added .however, that neither
he nor the others reported the incident.
"I'm not a cop," he said.
Other students reported "rampant
cheating" during a final exam in
Assoc. Prof. John Kaplan's criminal
law class last spring. When asked
about this Kaplan replied, "Of course
there was cheating, but I anticipated it
and alternated questions without tel
ling anyone."
"If anyone copied, he added, "they
probably copied the wrong answers."
Goheen said students cheat because
of today's intense pressure for top
grades. This pressure, he said, is

created by the competition for admis
sion to professional schools.
Lyons , however, said pressure can
not be equated with being a pre-med.
He said other pressures such as finan
cial and parental, are significant fac
tors contributing to cheating.
According to figures released by
Siena's office, only one of the 11 stu
dents charged with cheating last year
had a possible pre-med major. Five
were undeclared two were English ma
jors one majored in psychology and
two in communication.
These figures do not seem to limit
cheating to a certain group. According
toGalligan, it will be the responsibility
ot the SCLC, and its chairman Paul
Berg, to investigate matters further.

amined by the SCLC, the committee in
charge of promulgating legislation
governing student conduct.
Galligan noted, however, that a
problem exists in giving the SCLC
such a task.
Special election
The committee is designed to consist
of six faculty, two ex-officio members
and three elected students, but no stu
dents have run for any of the positions.
Therefore, Galligan said, a special
election would probably have to be
called.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
said. "No one ran for the committee
because no one knows what it is." He
says the committee has been inopera
tive for the past four years.
Two years ago, Rosenbaum was

elected to the SCLC, but it never met.
He said he called the chairperson to
ask when the committee would con
sider important honor code questions
in light of bomb threats during mid
terms and otherdubious activities,and
was told the issue wasn't important.
Rosenbaum said the Honor Code
should have been reassessed at least
two years ago and said he believes
"something political" prevented its
examination.
Today, no one, including Assistant
to the President Bill Stone, Dean of
Students James Lyons. Legal Advisor
to the President James Siena, the COP
nor past SCLC chairpersons, hows ex
actly when the SCLC last met.
Figures available
But all are aware that
Honor Code violations have occurred .
The figures are available.
Last year, according to Siena, there
were 11 Honor Code charges, all of
which were reported by faculty. Of the
11. accused students, he says, 10 were
found guilty and seven were sus
pended for one quarter.
Similar numbers, he added, were
reported in the previous two years.
Siena emphasized that the Honor
Code rests with students policing
themselves and noted that only one or
two students a year have been turning
in peers for cheating.
These facts lead him to conclude
"that if cheating is as widespread as
people say it is. then students aren't
turning in violators." In addition,
Siena said faculty members are violat
ing the Honor Code by proctoring
exams.
A survey
To evaluate the extend of Honor
Code violations, Siena suggested that a
survey be taken and in the memoran
dum to the SCLC to be finalized next
week President Lyman and the COP re
commend that the SCLC conduct a
survey of students, faculty and
alumni.
President Lyman also noted in the
memorandum that surveys at other
universities have produced some dis
tressing findings.
At Johns Hopkins University, for in
stance. a 51-year old honor system was
abandoned last spring after a student
poll revealed that almost 30 percent of
all undergraduates had cheated by
their senior year.
In addition,about 70 percent of all
undergraduates said they had seen
cheating take place.
At UC Davis, a 1974 survey found
that 75.4 percent of the under

graduates said they would not report
another student cheating. A recent re
port by a faculty member there charac
terized the present status of the code as
a joke.
'Little value on honesty'
The report indicated that 16 percent
of the students admitted they had
cheated at one time or another. It also
commented that students felt that
"society at large seems to place little
value on honesty."
Although no formal survey has been
taken here as yet, students interviewed
by the Daily seem to indicate that re
sults of such a survey may be equally
pleasing.
Dave Cooper, a senior biology major
who transferred here from UC Davis
last year, said the honor codes at both
schools are similar, but it wasn't until
he came to Stanford that he saw cheat
ing.
He said that last year, during a final
exam, he and other students noticed a
girl blatantly copying from his paper.
He asked the girl to stop, he said, and
someone in the next row poked her
and told her to "cut it out."
'Not a cop'
Cooper added .however, that neither
he nor the others reported the incident.
"I'm not a cop," he said.
Other students reported "rampant
cheating" during a final exam in
Assoc. Prof. John Kaplan's criminal
law class last spring. When asked
about this Kaplan replied, "Of course
there was cheating, but I anticipated it
and alternated questions without tel
ling anyone."
"If anyone copied, he added, "they
probably copied the wrong answers."
Goheen said students cheat because
of today's intense pressure for top
grades. This pressure, he said, is

created by the competition for admis
sion to professional schools.
Lyons , however, said pressure can
not be equated with being a pre-med.
He said other pressures such as finan
cial and parental, are significant fac
tors contributing to cheating.
According to figures released by
Siena's office, only one of the 11 stu
dents charged with cheating last year
had a possible pre-med major. Five
were undeclared two were English ma
jors one majored in psychology and
two in communication.
These figures do not seem to limit
cheating to a certain group. According
toGalligan, it will be the responsibility
ot the SCLC, and its chairman Paul
Berg, to investigate matters further.
ThtASSU Council of Presidents and
President Richard Lyman tentatively
agreed Friday to ask the Student Con
duct Legislative COUNCIL (skac) to
reassess Stanford's Honor Code.
According to ASSU vice-president
Dave Galligan, the joint request came
in response to growing questions con
cerning academic honesty at Stanford.
Those questions have multiplied in
recent weeks following the annual re
port from University Ombudsman
John Goheen indicating considerable
disregard of the Honor Code.
Goheen, an emeritus professor of
philosophy, serving his second term as
ombudsman, blamed "unevenness in
grading" and"the breakdown of ordi
nary standards of honesty" for placing
the Code in jeopardy. He stressed that
"a reassessment of the whole Honor
Code and its relevance to this point in
time is now desirable."
Galligan said Goheen's report was

Rosenbaum said the Honor Code
should have been reassessed at least
two years ago and said he believes
"something political" prevented its
examination.
Today, no one, including Assistant
to the President Bill Stone, Dean of
Students James Lyons. Legal Advisor
to the President James Siena, the COP
nor past SCLC chairpersons, hows ex
actly when the SCLC last met.
Figures available
But all are aware that
Honor Code violations have occurred .
The figures are available.
Last year, according to Siena, there
were 11 Honor Code charges, all of
which were reported by faculty. Of the
11. accused students, he says, 10 were
found guilty and seven were sus
pended for one quarter.
Similar numbers, he added, were
reported in the previous two years.
Siena emphasized that the Honor
Code rests with students policing
themselves and noted that only one or
two students a year have been turning
in peers for cheating.
These facts lead him to conclude
"that if cheating is as widespread as
people say it is. then students aren't
turning in violators." In addition,
Siena said faculty members are violat
ing the Honor Code by proctoring
exams.
A survey
To evaluate the extend of Honor
Code violations, Siena suggested that a
survey be taken and in the memoran
dum to the SCLC to be finalized next
week President Lyman and the COP re
commend that the SCLC conduct a
survey of students, faculty and
alumni.
President Lyman also noted in the
memorandum that surveys at other
universities have produced some dis
tressing findings.
At Johns Hopkins University, for in
stance. a 51-year old honor system was
abandoned last spring after a student
poll revealed that almost 30 percent of
all undergraduates had cheated by
their senior year.
In addition,about 70 percent of all
undergraduates said they had seen
cheating take place.
At UC Davis, a 1974 survey found
that 75.4 percent of the under

graduates said they would not report
another student cheating. A recent re
port by a faculty member there charac
terized the present status of the code as
a joke.
'Little value on honesty'
The report indicated that 16 percent
of the students admitted they had
cheated at one time or another. It also
commented that students felt that
"society at large seems to place little
value on honesty."
Although no formal survey has been
taken here as yet, students interviewed
by the Daily seem to indicate that re
sults of such a survey may be equally
pleasing.
Dave Cooper, a senior biology major
who transferred here from UC Davis
last year, said the honor codes at both
schools are similar, but it wasn't until
he came to Stanford that he saw cheat
ing.
He said that last year, during a final
exam, he and other students noticed a
girl blatantly copying from his paper.
He asked the girl to stop, he said, and
someone in the next row poked her
and told her to "cut it out."
'Not a cop'
Cooper added .however, that neither
he nor the others reported the incident.
"I'm not a cop," he said.
Other students reported "rampant
cheating" during a final exam in
Assoc. Prof. John Kaplan's criminal
law class last spring. When asked
about this Kaplan replied, "Of course
there was cheating, but I anticipated it
and alternated questions without tel
ling anyone."
"If anyone copied, he added, "they
probably copied the wrong answers."
Goheen said students cheat because
of today's intense pressure for top
grades. This pressure, he said, is

created by the competition for admis
sion to professional schools.
Lyons , however, said pressure can
not be equated with being a pre-med.
He said other pressures such as finan
cial and parental, are significant fac
tors contributing to cheating.
According to figures released by
Siena's office, only one of the 11 stu
dents charged with cheating last year
had a possible pre-med major. Five
were undeclared two were English ma
jors one majored in psychology and
two in communication.
These figures do not seem to limit
cheating to a certain group. According
toGalligan, it will be the responsibility
ot the SCLC, and its chairman Paul
Berg, to investigate matters further.
ThtASSU Council of Presidents and
President Richard Lyman tentatively
agreed Friday to ask the Student Con
duct Legislative COUNCIL (skac) to
reassess Stanford's Honor Code.
According to ASSU vice-president
Dave Galligan, the joint request came
in response to growing questions con
cerning academic honesty at Stanford.
Those questions have multiplied in
recent weeks following the annual re
port from University Ombudsman
John Goheen indicating considerable
disregard of the Honor Code.
Goheen, an emeritus professor of
philosophy, serving his second term as
ombudsman, blamed "unevenness in
grading" and"the breakdown of ordi
nary standards of honesty" for placing
the Code in jeopardy. He stressed that
"a reassessment of the whole Honor
Code and its relevance to this point in
time is now desirable."
Galligan said Goheen's report was
probably a major factor in President
Lyman's decision to have the Code ex
amined by the SCLC, the committee in
charge of promulgating legislation
governing student conduct.
Galligan noted, however, that a
problem exists in giving the SCLC
such a task.
Special election
The committee is designed to consist
of six faculty, two ex-officio members
and three elected students, but no stu
dents have run for any of the positions.
Therefore, Galligan said, a special
election would probably have to be
called.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
said. "No one ran for the committee
because no one knows what it is." He
says the committee has been inopera
tive for the past four years.
Two years ago, Rosenbaum was

elected to the SCLC, but it never met.
He said he called the chairperson to
ask when the committee would con
sider important honor code questions
in light of bomb threats during mid
terms and otherdubious activities,and
was told the issue wasn't important.
Rosenbaum said the Honor Code
should have been reassessed at least
two years ago and said he believes
"something political" prevented its
examination.
