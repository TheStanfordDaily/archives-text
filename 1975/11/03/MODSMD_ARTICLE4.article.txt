# Lyman, COP to call honor code review
## 
### STEVE HEFTER 
ThtASSU Council of Presidents and
President Richard Lyman tentatively
agreed Friday to ask the Student Con
duct Legislative COUNCIL (skac) to
reassess Stanford's Honor Code.
According to ASSU vice-president
Dave Galligan, the joint request came
in response to growing questions con
cerning academic honesty at Stanford.
Those questions have multiplied in
recent weeks following the annual re
port from University Ombudsman
John Goheen indicating considerable
disregard of the Honor Code.
Goheen, an emeritus professor of
philosophy, serving his second term as
ombudsman, blamed "unevenness in
grading" and"the breakdown of ordi
nary standards of honesty" for placing
the Code in jeopardy. He stressed that
"a reassessment of the whole Honor
Code and its relevance to this point in
time is now desirable."
Galligan said Goheen's report was
probably a major factor in President
Lyman's decision to have the Code ex
amined by the SCLC, the committee in
charge of promulgating legislation
governing student conduct.
Galligan noted, however, that a
problem exists in giving the SCLC
such a task.
Special election
The committee is designed to consist
of six faculty, two ex-officio members
and three elected students, but no stu
dents have run for any of the positions.
Therefore, Galligan said, a special
election would probably have to be
called.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum
said. "No one ran for the committee
because no one knows what it is." He
says the committee has been inopera
tive for the past four years.
Two years ago, Rosenbaum was

elected to the SCLC, but it never met.
He said he called the chairperson to
ask when the committee would con
sider important honor code questions
in light of bomb threats during mid
terms and otherdubious activities,and
was told the issue wasn't important.
Rosenbaum said the Honor Code
should have been reassessed at least
two years ago and said he believes
"something political" prevented its
examination.
Today, no one, including Assistant
to the President Bill Stone, Dean of
Students James Lyons. Legal Advisor
to the President James Siena, the COP
nor past SCLC chairpersons, hows ex
actly when the SCLC last met.
Figures available
But all are aware that
Honor Code violations have occurred .
The figures are available.
Last year, according to Siena, there
were 11 Honor Code charges, all of
which were reported by faculty. Of the
11. accused students, he says, 10 were
found guilty and seven were sus
pended for one quarter.
Similar numbers, he added, were
reported in the previous two years.
Siena emphasized that the Honor
Code rests with students policing
themselves and noted that only one or
two students a year have been turning
in peers for cheating.
These facts lead him to conclude
"that if cheating is as widespread as
people say it is. then students aren't
turning in violators." In addition,
Siena said faculty members are violat
ing the Honor Code by proctoring
exams.
A survey
To evaluate the extend of Honor
Code violations, Siena suggested that a
survey be taken and in the memoran
