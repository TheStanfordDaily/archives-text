WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Ford has fired CIA Director William
Colby and Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger and has asked Henry Kis
singer to step down as head of the Na
tional Security Council, top Pentagon
officials said last night.
Ford and White House officials de
clined to confirm or deny that the
changes were being made.
Congressional Democrats attributed
the changes to longstanding friction
between Kissinger and Schlesinger
and indicated they felt Kissinger
emerged the winner in a power strug

Colby has been criticized for his
stewardship at the CIA. although
many of the misdeeds the agency has
been accused of occurred before he be
came head of the agency.

Unconfirmed reports said Colby is
