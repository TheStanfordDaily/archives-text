## Requests Kissinger leave National Security Council 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Ford has fired CIA Director William
Colby and Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger and has asked Henry Kis
singer to step down as head of the Na
tional Security Council, top Pentagon
officials said last night.
Ford and White House officials de
clined to confirm or deny that the
changes were being made.
Congressional Democrats attributed
the changes to longstanding friction
between Kissinger and Schlesinger
and indicated they felt Kissinger
emerged the winner in a power strug
gle.
Colby has been criticized for his
stewardship at the CIA. although
many of the misdeeds the agency has
been accused of occurred before he be
came head of the agency.
Bush named replacement
Unconfirmed reports said Colby is
being replaced by George Bush, now
U.S. representative to China, and that
Schlesinger is being succeeded by
Donald Rumsfeld, White House staff
chief.
Kissinger, criticized in Congress
and elsewhere for holding dual posts
as secretary of state and head of the
security council, is to remain head of
the state department. However,
sources said he will be replaced at the
National Security Council by his na
tional security deputy, Air Force Lt.
Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the current na
tional security deputy and a Kissinger

protege.
Kissinger and Schlesinger have
been reported at odds over the areas of
detente with the Soviet Union and U.S.
Soviet Strategic Arms Limitation talks.
Some State Department officials
have privately accused Schlesinger of
impeding a new arms limitation ag
reement. The defense secretary was
known to have said there was no need
to hurry into a new agreement with the
Russians.
Schlesinger attacked
Schlesinger also has drawn criti
cism from Congress by bluntly attack
ing House cuts in the defense budgets.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-YVash.) said
the dispute between Kissinger and
Schlesinger was the reason for
Schlesinger's removal.
"Schlesinger's abrupt removal
indicates that the administration can
not tolerate differing views and honest
advice on the most serious issues of
national security," said Jackson, a
candidate for the Democratic presi
dential nomination.
"After this, President Ford will find
it almost impossible to get the candid
judgements that a president must
have."
Chairman John McClellan, (D-Ark.)
of the Senate Appropriations Commit
tee, also blamed Schlesinger's firing
on friction with Kissinger and said, "1
think they're giving Kissinger too
much power down at the White
House."
The Pentagon officials said
Schlesinger was surprised to learn yes
terday morning at a White House meet
ing with Ford that he was being fired.
Schlesinger had spent 90 minutes with
Ford on Saturday in a wide-ranging
policy discussion described as "cor
dial" by Pentagon officials and there
was no hint that his ouster was immi
nent, the sources said.
When he was asked to return yester
day morning, Schlesinger assumed it
was for a continuation of those policy
talks, they said.
Both Schlesinger and Colby turned
down offers of other government jobs,
the sources said. In Schlesinger's case,
the offer included an ambassadorship.

chief.
Kissinger, criticized in Congress
and elsewhere for holding dual posts
as secretary of state and head of the
security council, is to remain head of
the state department. However,
sources said he will be replaced at the
National Security Council by his na
tional security deputy, Air Force Lt.
Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the current na
tional security deputy and a Kissinger

protege.
Kissinger and Schlesinger have
been reported at odds over the areas of
detente with the Soviet Union and U.S.
Soviet Strategic Arms Limitation talks.
Some State Department officials
have privately accused Schlesinger of
impeding a new arms limitation ag
reement. The defense secretary was
known to have said there was no need
to hurry into a new agreement with the
Russians.
Schlesinger attacked
Schlesinger also has drawn criti
cism from Congress by bluntly attack
ing House cuts in the defense budgets.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-YVash.) said
the dispute between Kissinger and
Schlesinger was the reason for
Schlesinger's removal.
"Schlesinger's abrupt removal
indicates that the administration can
not tolerate differing views and honest
advice on the most serious issues of
national security," said Jackson, a
candidate for the Democratic presi
dential nomination.
"After this, President Ford will find
it almost impossible to get the candid
judgements that a president must
have."
Chairman John McClellan, (D-Ark.)
of the Senate Appropriations Commit
tee, also blamed Schlesinger's firing
on friction with Kissinger and said, "1
think they're giving Kissinger too
much power down at the White
House."
The Pentagon officials said
Schlesinger was surprised to learn yes
terday morning at a White House meet
ing with Ford that he was being fired.
Schlesinger had spent 90 minutes with
Ford on Saturday in a wide-ranging
policy discussion described as "cor
dial" by Pentagon officials and there
was no hint that his ouster was immi
nent, the sources said.
When he was asked to return yester
day morning, Schlesinger assumed it
was for a continuation of those policy
talks, they said.
Both Schlesinger and Colby turned
down offers of other government jobs,
the sources said. In Schlesinger's case,
the offer included an ambassadorship.
