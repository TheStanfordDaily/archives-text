Police and Santa Clara County nar
cotics officers raided a three-room
party early Saturday morning at the
Palo Alto Holiday Inn and arrested 78
persons on a variety of durg-related
charges.
Sgt. Howard Carlyle of the Palo Alto
Police Department told the Daily that
observations had indicated that
"known narcotics dealers and their
friends" were holding the party.
None of the 78 were known to be
Stanford students, according to Car
lyle.
After the observations of possible il
legal activity had been made the Palo
Alto Special Weapons and Tactics
(SWAT) team preceded the plain
clothes raiding party into the rooms.
Carlyle said the SWAT team is used
"only in incidents involving possible
danger or potential escape of felons."

The raid occurred without incident,
and plainclothesmen subsequently
made arrests.
Sixty-one of those arrested were
later released pending the filing of
charges with the district attorney. The
remaining 17 were taken to the Santa
Clara County Jail in Palo Alto and
booked on more serious charges.
Among those arrested and released
were two juvenile girls, ages 15 and 17,
said Carlyle.
Six handguns and about $5000
worth of narcotics were seized in the
25-officer raid at 4 a.m. Three rooms in
the Inn were involved, two of them
rented by a woman on probation,and
the third entered without the permis
sion of the hotel's owner, according to
Carlyle.
The owner was unavailable for
comment. Arrests of the 78 were ini
tially on the charge of being in a place

where narcotics were being used. That
charge will be used against most of the
61 persons who were released with
being booked.
Those arrested in the third, illegally
entered, room, a total of 7, will also be
charged with burglary.
Among the drugs seized were 1.5
ounces of heroin, 2.5 ounces of
cocaine, and 3 ounces of marijuana.
Also taken were pills and various other
"narcotics paraphernalia," according
to Carlyle.
Of the six handguns taken, he
added, several were being carried by
the individuals arrested. Some of those
arrested were later charged with pos
session of concealed weapons.
Miscellaneous charges levied
against those booked were possession
of a hypodermic kit, resisting arrest,
assault with a deadly weapon and vio
lation of probation.

DRUG RAID—The Holiday Inn in Palo Alio was the site —Daily photo by Glenn Hudsc
of a narcotics raid Saturday night. Seventy-eight persons were arrested.
Police and Santa Clara County nar
cotics officers raided a three-room
party early Saturday morning at the
Palo Alto Holiday Inn and arrested 78
persons on a variety of durg-related
charges.
Sgt. Howard Carlyle of the Palo Alto
Police Department told the Daily that
observations had indicated that
"known narcotics dealers and their
friends" were holding the party.
None of the 78 were known to be
Stanford students, according to Car
lyle.
After the observations of possible il
legal activity had been made the Palo
Alto Special Weapons and Tactics
(SWAT) team preceded the plain
clothes raiding party into the rooms.
Carlyle said the SWAT team is used
"only in incidents involving possible
danger or potential escape of felons."

The raid occurred without incident,
and plainclothesmen subsequently
made arrests.
Sixty-one of those arrested were
later released pending the filing of
charges with the district attorney. The
remaining 17 were taken to the Santa
Clara County Jail in Palo Alto and
booked on more serious charges.
Among those arrested and released
were two juvenile girls, ages 15 and 17,
said Carlyle.
Six handguns and about $5000
worth of narcotics were seized in the
25-officer raid at 4 a.m. Three rooms in
the Inn were involved, two of them
rented by a woman on probation,and
the third entered without the permis
sion of the hotel's owner, according to
Carlyle.
