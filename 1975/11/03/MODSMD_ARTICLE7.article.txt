# Students ignored?

Each year certain University
policy decisions directly con
tradict the will of a large seg
ment if not a clear majority of the
student body.
The committee system was di
rectly involved in all of last
year's controversial issues (e.g.
financial aid, Emeriti housing,
SWOPSI-SCIRE, grading
change, housing draw, Iran con
tract). With the exception of the
housing issues, the seven com
mittees of the Academic Council
played a major role in the con
troversial policy decisions.
These same committees appear
to be at the focal point of many of
this year's brewing controver
sies.
Although students ire far from
constituting a voting majority on
any of these committees, their
presence is essential for both
disseminating important infor
mation to students and utilizing
the extensive committee re
sources provided by the univer
sity.
According to President
Richard Lyman, the committee
svsiem is the means provided by
the university for students to ad
vocate their opinion(s) and to
have a voice in university policy
formulation.
Yet students cannot fulfill this
particular purpose of the com
mittee system if they are not con
sidered as equal participants
along with the faculty and ad
ministration.
One glaring example of the
subordinate student position in
the committee system occured
last fall. In response to the
doubts of a chairperson as to the
propriety of sending committee
minutes to the ASSU, the Steer
ing Committee of the Academic
Council recommended the ces
sation of such mailings. Appar
antly, there was no response by
the ASSU to this action.
During a recent orientation
meeting for student committee
members, Dan Howard brought
this issue to Lyman'sattention.

Lyman expressed great surprise
and seemed quite chagrined that
such an action flouting the spirit
of the committee system had oc
cured.
He promised to look into it
immediately. Within a week the
ASSU received a memo from
Academic Secretary Hutchinson
stating that although the Steer
ing Committee of last year's
Academic Council decided that
he should "... advise Council
Committee Chairman that Se
nate Rules do not authorize dis
tribution (of the Minutes) to (the)
ASSU", the current Steering
Committee found no impropri
ety in distributing Minutes (but
not agendas, meeting calls,
working papers or confidential
materials) to the ASSU.
It should be noted that this de
cision was made before the issue
was taken to Lyman.
A letter sent to the Steering
Committee and signed by the
COP and both Committee Staff
Assistants (CSA) found the
"... implicit attitude of gratuit
ous inclusion of the ASSU in the
substance of the Academic
Council Committees to be highly
inappropriate ..."
It also requested that the Steer
ing Committee contact theASSU
before revising their policy on
this issue.
This situation, and many
others, might not have de
veloped if the faculty and ad
ministration truly considered
students as equals.
The current Council of Presi
dents, is working to transform
the traditional student role on
committees from passive defer
ence to the administration and
faculty, to an active advocacy of
their own interests.
To achieve this goal, arbitrary
decisions such as the one men
tioned in this article must be
challenged, and gratuitousness
or paternalism cannot be
docilely accepted.

Richard Lyman, the committee
svsiem is the means provided by
the university for students to ad
vocate their opinion(s) and to
have a voice in university policy
formulation.
Yet students cannot fulfill this
particular purpose of the com
mittee system if they are not con
sidered as equal participants
along with the faculty and ad
ministration.
One glaring example of the
subordinate student position in
the committee system occured
last fall. In response to the
doubts of a chairperson as to the
propriety of sending committee
minutes to the ASSU, the Steer
ing Committee of the Academic
Council recommended the ces
sation of such mailings. Appar
antly, there was no response by
the ASSU to this action.
During a recent orientation
meeting for student committee
members, Dan Howard brought
this issue to Lyman'sattention.

Lyman expressed great surprise
and seemed quite chagrined that
such an action flouting the spirit
of the committee system had oc
cured.
He promised to look into it
immediately. Within a week the
ASSU received a memo from
Academic Secretary Hutchinson
stating that although the Steer
ing Committee of last year's
Academic Council decided that
he should "... advise Council
Committee Chairman that Se
nate Rules do not authorize dis
tribution (of the Minutes) to (the)
ASSU", the current Steering
Committee found no impropri
ety in distributing Minutes (but
not agendas, meeting calls,
working papers or confidential
materials) to the ASSU.
It should be noted that this de
cision was made before the issue
was taken to Lyman.
A letter sent to the Steering
Committee and signed by the
COP and both Committee Staff
Assistants (CSA) found the
"... implicit attitude of gratuit
ous inclusion of the ASSU in the
substance of the Academic
Council Committees to be highly
inappropriate ..."
It also requested that the Steer
ing Committee contact theASSU
before revising their policy on
this issue.
This situation, and many
others, might not have de
veloped if the faculty and ad
ministration truly considered
students as equals.
The current Council of Presi
dents, is working to transform
the traditional student role on
committees from passive defer
ence to the administration and
faculty, to an active advocacy of
their own interests.
To achieve this goal, arbitrary
decisions such as the one men
tioned in this article must be
challenged, and gratuitousness
or paternalism cannot be
docilely accepted.

Each year certain University
policy decisions directly con
tradict the will of a large seg
ment if not a clear majority of the
student body.
The committee system was di
rectly involved in all of last
year's controversial issues (e.g.
financial aid, Emeriti housing,
SWOPSI-SCIRE, grading
change, housing draw, Iran con
tract). With the exception of the
housing issues, the seven com
mittees of the Academic Council
played a major role in the con
troversial policy decisions.
These same committees appear
to be at the focal point of many of
this year's brewing controver
sies.
Although students ire far from
constituting a voting majority on
any of these committees, their
presence is essential for both
disseminating important infor
mation to students and utilizing
the extensive committee re
sources provided by the univer
sity.
