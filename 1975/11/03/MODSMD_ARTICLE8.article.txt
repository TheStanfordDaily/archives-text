# Budget problems
## 
### 
In view of persistent inflation
and increasing operational
costs, the University is perhaps
justified in making the severe
budget cuts it has planned.
Students have already begun
to question whether or not at
tending school at the "Farm" is
worth the investment. Like most
larger, cheap state institutions,
Stanford is plagued by such
problems as large classes and fa
culty inaccessability.
In spite of this, it is frequently
argued that a degree from Stan
ford enhances one's chances of
finding a job or gaining admis
sion to graduate and profes
sional schools.
The validity of this latter point
may itself be debated, but even if
one accepts that Stanford
graduates are more qualified, a
second issue is immediately
raised. Are these individuals
more capable because of what
Stanford did to them or because
they were that way to begin
with? In view of Stanford's
selective admissions policies,
the second alternative is at least
likely.
The result of this problem is
that the University may find it
increasingly difficult to attract
the talented individuals for
which it has long been famous.
Similar budgetary measures at
other prestigious institutions
render them equally undesira
ble. and Stanford may soon dis
cover that its greatest competi
tion lies not in the Ivy League but
instead in junior colleges and
state universities.
Many students have resorted
to an intentional hastening of

David Sartoris

their progress through school in
trying to cope with the financial
crunch. It is rare at present to
find an individual carrying less
than 15 academic units at Stan
ford, and 20-unit schedules are
not uncommon. As Fred Harga
don, dean of admissions, re
cently pointed out, fewer people
are taking quarters off, and early
graduation has been occurring
with ever-increasing frequency.
These tendencies, although
monetarily advantageous, place
increased academic pressure on
thestudent. Not only is heable to
spend less time on any particular
course, but he also curtails other
less-formal but equally
important aspects of his educa
tion.
Hence, we see still another ad
verse effect of current budgetary
policy.
Although the new financial
plan also calls for an 11.6 per
cent per year increase in finan
cial aid, it does nothing to al
leviate the "middle class
squeeze" effect. Since the tuition
will simultaneously rise at a
higher rate of 12.2 pecent per
annum, the net result is that
Stanford becomes less affordable
to more people.
Prior to its heyday as the
"academic Mecca of the West,"
Stanford was commonly termed
"the finishing school for
California's rich." Unless the
University discontinues its prac
tice of burdening the under
graduate population with its fi
nancial deficits, it may soon earn
back its former title.

ford enhances one's chances of
finding a job or gaining admis
sion to graduate and profes
sional schools.
The validity of this latter point
may itself be debated, but even if
one accepts that Stanford
graduates are more qualified, a
second issue is immediately
raised. Are these individuals
more capable because of what
Stanford did to them or because
they were that way to begin
with? In view of Stanford's
selective admissions policies,
the second alternative is at least
likely.
The result of this problem is
that the University may find it
increasingly difficult to attract
the talented individuals for
which it has long been famous.
Similar budgetary measures at
other prestigious institutions
render them equally undesira
ble. and Stanford may soon dis
cover that its greatest competi
tion lies not in the Ivy League but
instead in junior colleges and
state universities.
Many students have resorted
to an intentional hastening of

David Sartoris

their progress through school in
trying to cope with the financial
crunch. It is rare at present to
find an individual carrying less
than 15 academic units at Stan
ford, and 20-unit schedules are
not uncommon. As Fred Harga
don, dean of admissions, re
cently pointed out, fewer people
are taking quarters off, and early
graduation has been occurring
with ever-increasing frequency.
These tendencies, although
monetarily advantageous, place
increased academic pressure on
thestudent. Not only is heable to
spend less time on any particular
course, but he also curtails other
less-formal but equally
important aspects of his educa
tion.
Hence, we see still another ad
verse effect of current budgetary
policy.
Although the new financial
plan also calls for an 11.6 per
cent per year increase in finan
cial aid, it does nothing to al
leviate the "middle class
squeeze" effect. Since the tuition
will simultaneously rise at a
higher rate of 12.2 pecent per
annum, the net result is that
Stanford becomes less affordable
to more people.
Prior to its heyday as the
"academic Mecca of the West,"
Stanford was commonly termed
"the finishing school for
California's rich." Unless the
University discontinues its prac
tice of burdening the under
graduate population with its fi
nancial deficits, it may soon earn
back its former title.
(David Sartoris is a senior in
biology.)
In view of persistent inflation
and increasing operational
costs, the University is perhaps
justified in making the severe
budget cuts it has planned.
Students have already begun
to question whether or not at
tending school at the "Farm" is
worth the investment. Like most
larger, cheap state institutions,
Stanford is plagued by such
problems as large classes and fa
culty inaccessability.
In spite of this, it is frequently
argued that a degree from Stan
ford enhances one's chances of
finding a job or gaining admis
sion to graduate and profes
sional schools.
