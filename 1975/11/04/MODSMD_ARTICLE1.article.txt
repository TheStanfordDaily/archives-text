## Loss of Rockefeller may hurt Ford slate 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Vice President Nelson Rockefeller's
decision not to seek office with Presi
dent Ford next year may hurt Ford's
chances for re-election, according to
t wo professors contacted by the Daily.
Although Rockefeller's decision not
to run will help Ford in much of the
South and Midwest, "the overall effect
will hurt Ford" because he will have
lost the support of moderates, Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall said.
But Marshall noted that Ford still
has a good chance of being re-elected
because of the "total disarray of the
Democrats."
Prof. Richard Brody, chairman of the
Political Science department, agreed
that if Rockefeller's withdrawal
"means that Ford is moving toward the
natural center of the Republican
Party," his chances of capturing votes
in the nation's political center will be
reduced.
"Ford realized that his administra
tion was in ideological shambles,"
Marshall said. "Rockefeller talked him
into the $100 billion energy program,
but meanwhile. Ford was touring the

country attacking bureaucracy."
Marshall added that Ford urged
Rockefeller to withdraw from the race
because he wanted to'placate conser
vatives who were angered by his firing
of Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger, who had advocated a
strong defense policy.
But Brody said he doubted that Ford
forced Rockefeller to announce his
withdrawal.
Rockefeller might simply have be
come bored with serving as vice presi
dent, Brody speculated.
"After serving at the hub of New
York for so long (15 years) the vice
presidency must be deadly dull,"
Brody said. "The thought of four more
years of right-wingers carping at him
may have been too much for him. And
he certainly doesn't need the money."
Marshall, however, said that "Rock
efeller loves to be lionized" and would
have enjoyed four more years in the
limelight as vice president.
Marshall and Brody agreed that
Rockefeller's support for aid to New
York indicated that there was a grow
ing rift between Ford and Rockefeller
on policy matters.


TICKET TALKâ€”Vice Prresident Nelson Rockefeller's decision to withdraw
from President Ford's 1976 re-election ticket is expected to spark a power
struggle within the Republican party, experts on campus say. Rockefeller did
not comment on speculation that he would seek the presidency on his own.
