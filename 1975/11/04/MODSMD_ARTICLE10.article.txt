More on New York

Editor:
Whether New York City
should receive state or federal
aid is a lively debate which will
not be concluded easily or
quickly. Most opinions on the
issue have been thoroughly
aired, including those of Carlos
Crummett in the Oct. 29 Daily.
But Crummett's column shed
new light on nothing except his
own narrow view of New York
City and his antagonism toward
its troubles.
New York's problems are
complex and are no way at
tributable to "spoiled brats"
constantly running around de
manding "higher wages, more
fringe benefits and longer vaca
tions." By implying that they
are, Crummett has given his col
umn a tone of ignorant prattling.
If Crummett seriously wishes
his opinions to be listened to, l
suggest that in the future he form
them on a base stable enough
that they are able to stand on
their own, rather than falling
back on petty name-calling and
the denigration of others' ideas.

Let students decide
Editor:
In response to Stella Saunders'
Oct. 31 Daily letter, there will
never come a time when the
Stanford Indian will completely
disappear.
For thousands of alumni and
present students the Indian is
and will continue to be the sym
bol of Stanford spirit. The only
"disappearing" he has experi
enced is from the official title of
Stanford athletic teams.
I am aware of the arguments
which caused the administra
tion to take away the Indian as
mascot. However, it should be
recognized that Stanford stu
dents did not vote to remove
him.
It is foolish to believe that
many students and alumni want
to restore Stanford's mascot to
degrade Native Americans (at
Stanford or elsewhere).
Couldn't they simply wish to
regain the official title of Stan
ford spirit?
