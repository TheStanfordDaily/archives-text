# Bilingual ballots fragmentary
## 
### 
The Justice Department's decision that voters
must be offered ballots in a choice of languages is
a dangerous step for this country, as it opens the
door to severe fragmentization of our society.
This nation stands out as one of the most suc
cessful efforts to amalgamate a society from
widely varied sources.
Most immigrants sought to become American,
to become an integral part of American society,
without abandoning the traditions of their ances
tors. There exists today remarkable preservation
of individual cultures, expressed, for example, in
our religions, our arts and our cuisines.
It is good that Americans remember that we
have a mixed culture and that we keep in mind
from what cultures ours developed. Yet, as
Americans, we must all share some aspects of
nationality.
All American citizens should know English.
It is a requirement for naturalized citizenship. It
is the national language.
Though many segments of the population are
bilingual, ours is not a bilingual society as a
whole. If one expects to function as a citizen, one
must know the common language well enough to
act as a citizen.
The main adverse effect of these ballots is to

further fragmentize our society. It is what we as
individuals have in common that holds us to
gether as a nation.
As long as we prefer to emphasize our differ
ences rather than our common relationship, our
society will disintegrate. Providing ballots in
foreign languages will only solidify the divisions.
Logical developments from the institution of
foreign language ballots might be most ominous.
If the government acknowledges, by printing bal
lots in a variety of languages, that it is not the
responsibility of all citizens to know the English
tongue, citizens would likewise not be responsi
ble for observing laws written only in English.
It is a central assumption of society that all
members are acquainted with the laws of the soci
ety. This assumption then calls for all citizens to
understand the language of the laws or for the
laws to be written in all the languages of the citi
zens.
Our law code would have to be translated into
every conceivable language to satisfy the needs of
all citizens. Law courts would be in a jumble if an
issue of law rested on a semantic difference of
corresponding words in different languages.
Let the reaction against foreign language bal lots
be swift and sharp, and let this foolishness die.

must be offered ballots in a choice of languages is
a dangerous step for this country, as it opens the
door to severe fragmentization of our society.
This nation stands out as one of the most suc
cessful efforts to amalgamate a society from
widely varied sources.
Most immigrants sought to become American,
to become an integral part of American society,
without abandoning the traditions of their ances
tors. There exists today remarkable preservation
of individual cultures, expressed, for example, in
our religions, our arts and our cuisines.
It is good that Americans remember that we
have a mixed culture and that we keep in mind
from what cultures ours developed. Yet, as
Americans, we must all share some aspects of
nationality.
All American citizens should know English.
It is a requirement for naturalized citizenship. It
is the national language.
Though many segments of the population are
bilingual, ours is not a bilingual society as a
whole. If one expects to function as a citizen, one
must know the common language well enough to
act as a citizen.
The main adverse effect of these ballots is to

further fragmentize our society. It is what we as
individuals have in common that holds us to
gether as a nation.
As long as we prefer to emphasize our differ
ences rather than our common relationship, our
society will disintegrate. Providing ballots in
foreign languages will only solidify the divisions.
Logical developments from the institution of
foreign language ballots might be most ominous.
If the government acknowledges, by printing bal
lots in a variety of languages, that it is not the
responsibility of all citizens to know the English
tongue, citizens would likewise not be responsi
ble for observing laws written only in English.
It is a central assumption of society that all
members are acquainted with the laws of the soci
ety. This assumption then calls for all citizens to
understand the language of the laws or for the
laws to be written in all the languages of the citi
zens.
Our law code would have to be translated into
every conceivable language to satisfy the needs of
all citizens. Law courts would be in a jumble if an
issue of law rested on a semantic difference of
corresponding words in different languages.
Let the reaction against foreign language bal lots
be swift and sharp, and let this foolishness die.
