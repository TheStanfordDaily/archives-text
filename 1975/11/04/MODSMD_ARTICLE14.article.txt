A friend of mine maintains that blacks have a greater muscle-to
bone ratio than whites and therefore have more difficulty staying
afloat in water. This, he says, is the reason that there are no famous
black swimmers but an abundance of black sprinters. Is there any
truth to this? - T.B.
Wesley Ruff, an instructor in exercise physiology at Stanford,
says that the muscle-to-bone theory is incorrect. However, it is true
that blacks are what is known in swimmerese as "sinkers." Blacks
have a harder time staying afloat in water for two reasons, accord
ing to Ruff. First, and most important, they have a smaller lung
capacity for their size, and consequently have less air to displace
the water. This smaller lung capacity does not affect their endur
ance, though. Secondly, Ruff said, blacks are rarely obese when
they are young. Since fat people are more buoyant, black children
have a harder time learning to swim initially. However, as Ruff
pointed out, men are generally less buoyant than women and are
often faster swimmers. So buoyancy is less important than lung
capacity.
Finally Ruff noted that there are also social reasons for the small
number of black swimmers. The availability of pools in black
communities is much smaller than in white areas.

I need alterations to a good suede jacket I recently received as a

area at a reasonable price? - W.C.M.
Wilson's House of Suede and Leather recommends a place called
Senator's Cleaners at 512 Ellis Street in the City. They make side
alterations for $8. shoulder alterations for $16 and sleeve altera
tions for $5.
I would like to know who are the two people that drive around in a
green von thut is always parked at the police station. It doesn't
have Stanford stickers on it but it has ladders on top of it. The one
occupant I recognize is an ex-Stanford sheriff. I have seen him and
his partner crawl in the back of the van (which you can't see into)
with a walkie talkie and a gun. The van has been at the Ford
demonstration and other activities around campus. Could you
please inform me as to what these snoops are looking for? - B.D.

Why doesn't the Daily print weather maps? - f.P.S.
Editor Viae Kershner says that the primary reason is that the
newspaper does not get AP laser photo service, and consequently,
there is no way to get the AP map. However, he doubts that it would
be worth the space anyway.

have Stanford stickers on it but it has ladders on top of it. The one
occupant I recognize is an ex-Stanford sheriff. I have seen him and
his partner crawl in the back of the van (which you can't see into)
with a walkie talkie and a gun. The van has been at the Ford
demonstration and other activities around campus. Could you
please inform me as to what these snoops are looking for? - B.D.
The Stanford Police Department says it has no knowledge of such
a vehicle.

Why doesn't the Daily print weather maps? - f.P.S.
Editor Viae Kershner says that the primary reason is that the
newspaper does not get AP laser photo service, and consequently,
there is no way to get the AP map. However, he doubts that it would
be worth the space anyway.


A friend of mine maintains that blacks have a greater muscle-to
bone ratio than whites and therefore have more difficulty staying
afloat in water. This, he says, is the reason that there are no famous
black swimmers but an abundance of black sprinters. Is there any
truth to this? - T.B.
Wesley Ruff, an instructor in exercise physiology at Stanford,
says that the muscle-to-bone theory is incorrect. However, it is true
that blacks are what is known in swimmerese as "sinkers." Blacks
have a harder time staying afloat in water for two reasons, accord
ing to Ruff. First, and most important, they have a smaller lung
capacity for their size, and consequently have less air to displace
the water. This smaller lung capacity does not affect their endur
ance, though. Secondly, Ruff said, blacks are rarely obese when
they are young. Since fat people are more buoyant, black children
have a harder time learning to swim initially. However, as Ruff
pointed out, men are generally less buoyant than women and are
often faster swimmers. So buoyancy is less important than lung
capacity.
Finally Ruff noted that there are also social reasons for the small
number of black swimmers. The availability of pools in black
communities is much smaller than in white areas.

I need alterations to a good suede jacket I recently received as a
present. Can you suggest someone who does quality work in this
area at a reasonable price? - W.C.M.
Wilson's House of Suede and Leather recommends a place called
Senator's Cleaners at 512 Ellis Street in the City. They make side
alterations for $8. shoulder alterations for $16 and sleeve altera
tions for $5.
I would like to know who are the two people that drive around in a
