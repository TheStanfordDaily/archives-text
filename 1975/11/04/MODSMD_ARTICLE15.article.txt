# McDonald's hamburgers go to Hong Kong
## Menu includes Big Macs, french fries and tea 
### 
HONG KONG (Pacific News
Service) — The expression "as
American as apple pie" may
soon become "as Chinese as
apple pie," thanks to
McDonald's hamburgers' latest
foray into global franchising.
Ignoring warnings that its
food would not agree with
Chinese palates, the hamburger
empire has now established a
foothold in this British colony
where 9H percent of the 4.3 mill
ion residents are Chinese.

The first store was opened in
January — complete with a
Chinese Ronald McDonald
promoting Big Macs, french fries
and tea. Two more will open by
the end of this year. It is expected
there will eventually be about 20
here.
10,000 pies daily
Each month, the store has sold
more apple pies (about 10,000)
than any other of the chain's
3300 stores across the world.
Hamburger sales are totalling

about 7000 a day.
"We're doing better business
over-all than 90 percent of the
McDonald's in America," said
managing director Daniel Ng.
whom friends now call the
"Hamburger King of Hong
Kong."
Ng is especially proud be
cause McDonald's is proving
successful here while other
American fast-foot chains have
failed. The latest and largest flop
was Kentucky Fried Chicken,
which last year had to close
down the 11 stores it had opened
in 1973.
Food industry experts have
suggested various theories on
1 why Kentucky Fried failed while
, McDonald's is making it big.
One is poor management, in
cluding the precipitous 11-store
leap into the market.
Not 'finger-lickin' good'
Another is that Colonel San
ders didn't understand local cus
toms. According to this theory.
. the slogan "finger-lickin' good"
was a hindrance when translated
into Chinese, because the
Chinese don't lick their fingers
during or after eating. In fact,
they usually don't eat chicken
with their fingers at all, prefer

ring to use chopsticks.
A third theory is that some
thing in the batter was foreign
and didn't go down well with
local stomachs.
But it seems that all
McDonald's products are going
down well. The taste is identical
to McDonald's in America, as is
the preparation — right down to
the amount of grease in the
french fries.
Almost same menu
The menu is identical, too, ex
cept for the addition of tea as a
concession to Chinese eating
habits. Each item has been given
an equivalent Chinese name.
McDonald's itself comes out as
"Mak Don Now" in Chinese,
loosely (and promotionally)
translated as "to make at your
service."
All the food is imported from
the U.S. except the buns, but
they also taste the same since
they are made locally to
McDonald's strict specifica
tions.
Prices are comparable to those
in America: the equivalent of 32
cents for a regular hamburger,
and 70 cents for a Big Mac.
The high rate of apple pie sales
can probably be attributed to

noveltv. In America, Ng says, pie
sales aren't so high because
everyone's mom makes better
ones at home.
"Chinese mothers don't know
how to make apple pie, at least
not yet." he noted.
Hong Kong people don't know
how to make hamburgers either,
though they've been trying for a
number of vears.

That's what makes
McDonald's hamburgers seem
so good here. The others, one
English-language newspaper
wrote in praising the arrival of
the golden arches, are a "stringy,
rubbery ball of hash capped by a
slab of bullet-hard bun. that re
staurants have the audacity to
call a hamburger."
About one-half of Hong

Kong's population is 21 years of
age or younger, and McDonald's
long-range success hinges on
this group.
"We ignore the older Chinese
population as we can't expect
them to eat this." Ng says.
The strategy has so far proved
sound.
Hong Kong was the third
Asian location for McDonald's.

HONG KONG (Pacific News
Service) — The expression "as
American as apple pie" may
soon become "as Chinese as
apple pie," thanks to
McDonald's hamburgers' latest
foray into global franchising.
Ignoring warnings that its
food would not agree with
Chinese palates, the hamburger
empire has now established a
foothold in this British colony
where 9H percent of the 4.3 mill
ion residents are Chinese.

The first store was opened in
January — complete with a
Chinese Ronald McDonald
promoting Big Macs, french fries
and tea. Two more will open by
the end of this year. It is expected
there will eventually be about 20
here.
10,000 pies daily
Each month, the store has sold
more apple pies (about 10,000)
than any other of the chain's
3300 stores across the world.
Hamburger sales are totalling

about 7000 a day.
"We're doing better business
over-all than 90 percent of the
McDonald's in America," said
managing director Daniel Ng.
whom friends now call the
"Hamburger King of Hong
Kong."
Ng is especially proud be
cause McDonald's is proving
successful here while other
American fast-foot chains have
failed. The latest and largest flop
was Kentucky Fried Chicken,
which last year had to close
down the 11 stores it had opened
in 1973.
Food industry experts have
suggested various theories on
1 why Kentucky Fried failed while
, McDonald's is making it big.
One is poor management, in
cluding the precipitous 11-store
leap into the market.
Not 'finger-lickin' good'
Another is that Colonel San
ders didn't understand local cus
toms. According to this theory.
. the slogan "finger-lickin' good"
was a hindrance when translated
into Chinese, because the
Chinese don't lick their fingers
during or after eating. In fact,
they usually don't eat chicken
with their fingers at all, prefer

ring to use chopsticks.
A third theory is that some
thing in the batter was foreign
and didn't go down well with
local stomachs.
But it seems that all
McDonald's products are going
down well. The taste is identical
to McDonald's in America, as is
the preparation — right down to
the amount of grease in the
french fries.
Almost same menu
The menu is identical, too, ex
cept for the addition of tea as a
concession to Chinese eating
habits. Each item has been given
an equivalent Chinese name.
McDonald's itself comes out as
"Mak Don Now" in Chinese,
loosely (and promotionally)
translated as "to make at your
service."
All the food is imported from
the U.S. except the buns, but
they also taste the same since
they are made locally to
McDonald's strict specifica
tions.
Prices are comparable to those
in America: the equivalent of 32
cents for a regular hamburger,
and 70 cents for a Big Mac.
The high rate of apple pie sales
can probably be attributed to

noveltv. In America, Ng says, pie
sales aren't so high because
everyone's mom makes better
ones at home.
"Chinese mothers don't know
how to make apple pie, at least
not yet." he noted.
Hong Kong people don't know
how to make hamburgers either,
though they've been trying for a
number of vears.

The menu is identical, too, ex
cept for the addition of tea as a
concession to Chinese eating
habits. Each item has been given
an equivalent Chinese name.
McDonald's itself comes out as
"Mak Don Now" in Chinese,
loosely (and promotionally)
translated as "to make at your
service."
All the food is imported from
the U.S. except the buns, but
they also taste the same since
they are made locally to
McDonald's strict specifica

Prices are comparable to those
in America: the equivalent of 32
cents for a regular hamburger,
and 70 cents for a Big Mac.
The high rate of apple pie sales
can probably be attributed to

noveltv. In America, Ng says, pie
sales aren't so high because
everyone's mom makes better
ones at home.
"Chinese mothers don't know
how to make apple pie, at least
not yet." he noted.
Hong Kong people don't know
how to make hamburgers either,
though they've been trying for a
number of vears.

That's what makes
McDonald's hamburgers seem
so good here. The others, one
English-language newspaper
wrote in praising the arrival of
the golden arches, are a "stringy,
rubbery ball of hash capped by a
slab of bullet-hard bun. that re
staurants have the audacity to
call a hamburger."
About one-half of Hong

Kong's population is 21 years of
age or younger, and McDonald's
long-range success hinges on
this group.
"We ignore the older Chinese
population as we can't expect
them to eat this." Ng says.
The strategy has so far proved
sound.
Hong Kong was the third
Asian location for McDonald's.

HONG KONG (Pacific News
Service) — The expression "as
American as apple pie" may
soon become "as Chinese as
apple pie," thanks to
McDonald's hamburgers' latest
foray into global franchising.
Ignoring warnings that its
food would not agree with
Chinese palates, the hamburger
empire has now established a
foothold in this British colony
where 9H percent of the 4.3 mill
ion residents are Chinese.

The first store was opened in
January — complete with a
Chinese Ronald McDonald
promoting Big Macs, french fries
and tea. Two more will open by
the end of this year. It is expected
there will eventually be about 20
here.
10,000 pies daily
Each month, the store has sold
more apple pies (about 10,000)
than any other of the chain's
3300 stores across the world.
Hamburger sales are totalling

about 7000 a day.
"We're doing better business
over-all than 90 percent of the
McDonald's in America," said
managing director Daniel Ng.
whom friends now call the
"Hamburger King of Hong
Kong."
Ng is especially proud be
cause McDonald's is proving
successful here while other
American fast-foot chains have
failed. The latest and largest flop
was Kentucky Fried Chicken,
which last year had to close
down the 11 stores it had opened
in 1973.
Food industry experts have
suggested various theories on
1 why Kentucky Fried failed while
, McDonald's is making it big.
One is poor management, in
cluding the precipitous 11-store
leap into the market.
Not 'finger-lickin' good'
Another is that Colonel San
ders didn't understand local cus
toms. According to this theory.
. the slogan "finger-lickin' good"
was a hindrance when translated
into Chinese, because the
Chinese don't lick their fingers
during or after eating. In fact,
they usually don't eat chicken
with their fingers at all, prefer

ring to use chopsticks.
A third theory is that some
thing in the batter was foreign
and didn't go down well with
local stomachs.
But it seems that all
McDonald's products are going
down well. The taste is identical
to McDonald's in America, as is
the preparation — right down to
the amount of grease in the
french fries.
