# Doctor urges thorough labeling of over-the-counter medicines

### 
A Stanford physician says that
over-the-counter drugs should
be more completely labeled, in
cluding information about such
commonly consumed ingre
dients as caffeine and aspirin,
according to a release from the
Stanford Medical Center.
"Packaging and advertising of
non-prescription medicines are
woefully lacking in pertinent
facts," said Dr. William H. For
rest Jr., associate professor of
anesthesia.
Speaking before the monopoly
subcommittee of the Senate
Small Business Committee in
Washington, D.C. last week, For
rest called for more complete
labeling that would enable users
to directly associate the brand
name with its contents and their
effects.
Labels, he said, should in
clude a listing of every active in
gredient, giving the amount of
each dose in milligrams. They
should also give a brief common
definition of why an ingredient
is in the product, and list condi
tions which might alter the main
effect of the medicine.
He called for providing this in
formation in type much larger
than that now used to list ingre
dients, and placing all informa
tion on the outside of the pack
age, as well as in every adver
tisement.
He also recommended that
supervision of such advertising
be given to the Food and Drug

Administration, instead of the
Federal Trade Commission.
As an example, Forrest
pointed out that caffeine, like all
drugs that are affected by the
user's mood at the time, cannot
be guaranteed to produce the
same effect in every person, or in
the same person every time.
Almost a third of current
over-the-counter pain com
pounds contain some caffeine.

he said.
"One might expect medica
tion containing caffeine to have
less of a stimulant effect on a
heavy coffee drinker than on a
light coffee drinker or someone
who used no coffee at all," he
said.
Medication containing caf
feine should carry a warning that
it might, under certain circums
tances, have no effect or even the

opposite effect on coffee drink
ers, he said.
Using another example, he
said. "It is clear that certain in
dividuals should not take aspi
rin because it irritates their
stomachs and may even cause
ulceration and bleeding. And vet
you seldom see warnings about
these hazards on any aspirin bot
tle or in any advertisement for
medicine containing aspirin."
