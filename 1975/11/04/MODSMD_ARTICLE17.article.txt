"Our schools are out of con
trol." sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch told the Common
wealth Club in San Francisco
last Friday.
Dornbusch said evaluation of
performance is the basic process
in all systems of control. Serious
problems in the evaluation of
students, teachers and princi
pals cause schools to be uncon
trolled. he said.
Dornbusch defined two types
of organizations, based on re
search he has conducted with
Prof. W. Richard Scott,sociology
department chairman, and other
colleagues over the past 1U
years.

A bureaucratic organization
— government, Ceneral Motors,
the Bank of America — is one in
which "the plans and orders
come from above and. at least in
theory, are carried out by subor
dinates," Dornbusch said.
In a bureaucracy, evaluations
that affect workers' rewards and
penalties are made by organiza
tional superiors, he noted.
A profession, on the other
hand, is made up of people who
have mastered a complex body
of skills, he said. In medicine,
university teaching and other
professions, the key evaluations
come from other professionals
who share that body of skills.
Schools, Dornbusch said, are
"a mixture of the bureaucratic

and the professional systems —
and are not functioning very
well as either."
Turning to students. Dorn
busch summarized the findings
of a study he conducted in San
Francisco and suburban high
schools.
Some researchers and
policy-makers, he said, believe
that the reason for ethnic differ
ences in school performance is
the failure of minority students
and their parents to see educa
tion as important.
"Our findings indicate that
this is a myth," he declared.
"Yet there are no villains. To
change this sad situation will
take cooperative effort on a
system-wide basis," he said.
