## Hartford Ballet second-rate 
### JANICE ROSS 
Michael Uthoff, the artistic director of the
Hartford Ballet, recently commented that he
did not mind if his company was labeled
"second-rate Balanchine." This is an in
teresting statement coming from the idealis
tic and youthful director of a chamber dance
group that apparently lacks even a single
Balanchine-choreographed (or styled) bal
let in its repertoire.
After viewing the Hartford Ballet at their
Thursday evening performance in Memor
ial Auditorium, the implication of Uthoff's
statement became clear. IJthoff's company
is indeed "second-rate," but to call it
second-rate Balanchine is falsely modest
and misleading.
Currently Balanchine's New York City
Ballet represents the best American ballet
has to offer in both classic technique and
individual dominated repertory. Utholf's
three-year-old company has made an au
spicious start with its varied and imagina
tive repertoire, and one or two very talented
dancers, but they still lack that special spirit
and punch that marks a good company.
Strengths
The Hartford's strengths are the
Chilean-born Uthoff's clever choreography
and his wife and former Joffery colonist,
Lisa Bradley Uthoff's inventiveness is evi
dent in both his group dances, "Brahms
Variations" (1974)and "Antumalal" (1975).
Both dancers minimize the classic male

as-prop partnering; instead the majority of
the company's men attempt to dance with
the assurance and confidence of meaningful
characters.
"Brahms Variations" and "Antumalal"
also contained some delightfully inventive
lifts, like Judith Gosnell's backwards hand
spring into her partner's arms, and several
swift leaps that ended with the amazed bal
lerina caught in mid-air by her nimble part
ner.
Drawbacks
A major drawback to IJthoff's choreog
raphy however, is that it clearly requires a
seasoned professional like Lisa Bradley to
bring it to life. "Aves Mirabiles" (1973).
IJthoff's stunning duet for Bradley and
Clover Mathis, was the evening's most suc
cessful piece simply because the dancers
transcended the steps and started dancing!
Bradley is an enthralling dancer. She has
the slight build and steely strength of an
attenuated Giac.ometti figure, and the speed
and pliable upper torso of an ice skater.
Bradley moves with such unthinking ease
and obvious delight that watching her one
suddenly realizes what is meant by the joy
of dancing. Her dancing excites because she
is not only an extraordinary technician, but
a convincing actress as well.
Bogged down
Although the other dancers are also tech
nically capable, they frequently became
bogged down with the intricacy and diffi

culty ot what they were doing, failing to put
the audience or themselves at ease.
This was apparent in Antony Tudor's
"Little Improvisations" (1953), a whimsical
duet set to Schumann's "Scenes From
Childhood." Here the dancers tended to
rush the music instead of playing with it in
the teasing and spontaneous manner Tudor
intended.
The most arcane dance on Thursday's
program was Jennifer Muller's "White"
(1975), an enigmatic nightmare set to tradi
tional Japanese music.
Shallow chaos
Muller, a former lead dancer with Louis
Falco, obviously borrowed freely from
Falco's stylistic and thematic ideas.
Like much of Falco's work. Muller's
choreography alternates between utter
chaos and shallow meaning. Dressed in
stylized sleepwear, Bradley and four other
dancers washed hands, pulled hair and
writhed about the stage without generating
much thought or interest. "White" was a
sort of theatrical horror; its ugly move
ments, screeching score and punishing
length left one bored and irritated.
Despite its weaknesses one must be wary
of judging the Hartford Ballet by strictly
professional standards. As a fledgling reg
ional company Hartford is indisputably
strong. It's just that the claim of "second
rate Balanchine" always invites easy com
parison with the real thing.

The Hartford Ballet
Michael Uthoff, the artistic director of the
Hartford Ballet, recently commented that he
did not mind if his company was labeled
"second-rate Balanchine." This is an in
teresting statement coming from the idealis
tic and youthful director of a chamber dance
group that apparently lacks even a single
Balanchine-choreographed (or styled) bal
let in its repertoire.
After viewing the Hartford Ballet at their
Thursday evening performance in Memor
ial Auditorium, the implication of Uthoff's
statement became clear. IJthoff's company
is indeed "second-rate," but to call it
second-rate Balanchine is falsely modest
and misleading.
Currently Balanchine's New York City
Ballet represents the best American ballet
has to offer in both classic technique and
individual dominated repertory. Utholf's
three-year-old company has made an au
spicious start with its varied and imagina
tive repertoire, and one or two very talented
dancers, but they still lack that special spirit
and punch that marks a good company.
Strengths
The Hartford's strengths are the
Chilean-born Uthoff's clever choreography
and his wife and former Joffery colonist,
Lisa Bradley Uthoff's inventiveness is evi
dent in both his group dances, "Brahms
Variations" (1974)and "Antumalal" (1975).
Both dancers minimize the classic male

as-prop partnering; instead the majority of
the company's men attempt to dance with
the assurance and confidence of meaningful
characters.
"Brahms Variations" and "Antumalal"
also contained some delightfully inventive
lifts, like Judith Gosnell's backwards hand
spring into her partner's arms, and several
swift leaps that ended with the amazed bal
lerina caught in mid-air by her nimble part
ner.
Drawbacks
A major drawback to IJthoff's choreog
raphy however, is that it clearly requires a
seasoned professional like Lisa Bradley to
bring it to life. "Aves Mirabiles" (1973).
IJthoff's stunning duet for Bradley and
Clover Mathis, was the evening's most suc
cessful piece simply because the dancers
transcended the steps and started dancing!
Bradley is an enthralling dancer. She has
the slight build and steely strength of an
attenuated Giac.ometti figure, and the speed
and pliable upper torso of an ice skater.
Bradley moves with such unthinking ease
and obvious delight that watching her one
suddenly realizes what is meant by the joy
of dancing. Her dancing excites because she
is not only an extraordinary technician, but
a convincing actress as well.
Bogged down
Although the other dancers are also tech
nically capable, they frequently became
bogged down with the intricacy and diffi

culty ot what they were doing, failing to put
the audience or themselves at ease.
This was apparent in Antony Tudor's
"Little Improvisations" (1953), a whimsical
duet set to Schumann's "Scenes From
Childhood." Here the dancers tended to
rush the music instead of playing with it in
the teasing and spontaneous manner Tudor
intended.
The most arcane dance on Thursday's
program was Jennifer Muller's "White"
(1975), an enigmatic nightmare set to tradi
tional Japanese music.
Shallow chaos
Muller, a former lead dancer with Louis
Falco, obviously borrowed freely from
Falco's stylistic and thematic ideas.
Like much of Falco's work. Muller's
choreography alternates between utter
chaos and shallow meaning. Dressed in
stylized sleepwear, Bradley and four other
dancers washed hands, pulled hair and
writhed about the stage without generating
much thought or interest. "White" was a
sort of theatrical horror; its ugly move
ments, screeching score and punishing
length left one bored and irritated.
Despite its weaknesses one must be wary
of judging the Hartford Ballet by strictly
professional standards. As a fledgling reg
ional company Hartford is indisputably
strong. It's just that the claim of "second

parison with the real thing.
