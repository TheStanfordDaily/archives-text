# Kottke and Naftalin do it
## 
### JOHN STRAND 
The people who packed
Memorial Auditorium Saturday
Oct. 25 to hear the guitar-picking
wizardry of Leo Kottke and the
get-down piano of Mark Naftalin
did not leave disappointed.
The evening began with Nafta
lin at the piano; a potent blend of
slow, bemoaning blues and
fresh, original compositions that
really started things moving. He
capped his performance with a
soaring honky-tonk number that
evoked several wild whoops

from the clapping crowd.
Leo Kottke wasted no time in
showing why he was voted
World's Best Folk Guitarist by
Guitar Player Magazine.
Exclusively playing a 12-string
acoustic guitar, Kottke began
with some of his older material,
shifting from such intricate,
high-energy compositions as
"Vaseline Machine Gun," to
"Crow River Waltz" and other
slowly-swirling melodies. He
showed himself to possess quite
a capable singing voice in the
soulful Paul Seibel ballad,
"Louise" and the old traditional
arrangement of "Trouble in
Mind."
Kottke then took a few cuts
from his new album Chewing
Pine. "Can't Quite Hut It Into
Words" refers to "that most effi
cient tool of self-defense, the
fart." Another, "The Scarlatti
Rip-off," is a spicy conglomerate
of "everything that happened
during the Renaissance in Italy."
between tunes Kottke main-
I

tained the pace with his dry,
off-beat, country humor. "My
father-in-law started performing
originally with Lawrence Welk
who was playing for a seed com
pany in North Dakota. There was
a vacancy — the drummer was
beheaded in a car accident. It
was sheer creative genius on Mr.
Welk's part hiring my father-in
law as a drummer, but then it
was pretty creative of Bob, too,
for taking the job. seeing as he
was a violin player."
Pressed into two encores,
Kottke played a medley of "a
slow waltz, a cantata and a
spasm" that included his trans
position of Bach's "Jesu, Joy of
Man's Desiring" and then "Grim
to the Brim," a light, trapsing
piece off the Chewing Pine
album.
The people who were already
fans of Leo Kottke and Mark Naf
talin and those who became so
all left theauditorium fully satis
fied and refreshed after an even
ing of pure entertainment.

was pretty creative of Bob, too,
for taking the job. seeing as he
was a violin player."
Pressed into two encores,
Kottke played a medley of "a
slow waltz, a cantata and a
spasm" that included his trans
position of Bach's "Jesu, Joy of
Man's Desiring" and then "Grim
to the Brim," a light, trapsing
piece off the Chewing Pine
album.
The people who were already
fans of Leo Kottke and Mark Naf
talin and those who became so
all left theauditorium fully satis
fied and refreshed after an even
ing of pure entertainment.
The people who packed
Memorial Auditorium Saturday
Oct. 25 to hear the guitar-picking
wizardry of Leo Kottke and the
get-down piano of Mark Naftalin
did not leave disappointed.
The evening began with Nafta
lin at the piano; a potent blend of
slow, bemoaning blues and
fresh, original compositions that
really started things moving. He
capped his performance with a
soaring honky-tonk number that
evoked several wild whoops

from the clapping crowd.
Leo Kottke wasted no time in
showing why he was voted
World's Best Folk Guitarist by
Guitar Player Magazine.
Exclusively playing a 12-string
acoustic guitar, Kottke began
with some of his older material,
shifting from such intricate,
high-energy compositions as
"Vaseline Machine Gun," to
"Crow River Waltz" and other
slowly-swirling melodies. He
showed himself to possess quite
a capable singing voice in the
soulful Paul Seibel ballad,
"Louise" and the old traditional
arrangement of "Trouble in
Mind."
Kottke then took a few cuts
from his new album Chewing
Pine. "Can't Quite Hut It Into
Words" refers to "that most effi
cient tool of self-defense, the
fart." Another, "The Scarlatti
Rip-off," is a spicy conglomerate
of "everything that happened
during the Renaissance in Italy."
between tunes Kottke main-
I

tained the pace with his dry,
off-beat, country humor. "My
father-in-law started performing
originally with Lawrence Welk
who was playing for a seed com
pany in North Dakota. There was
a vacancy — the drummer was
beheaded in a car accident. It
was sheer creative genius on Mr.
Welk's part hiring my father-in
law as a drummer, but then it
was pretty creative of Bob, too,
for taking the job. seeing as he
was a violin player."
