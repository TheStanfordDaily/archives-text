OPENING NIGHT — Stanford's Drama Department opens
its 1975 season tonight with a performance of Frank
Wedekind's Spring Awakening , directed by third-year
doctoral student Andrew Mendelson.
Wedekind was a major influence on Brecht, but is perhaps
best known in the United States for the adaptation of his work
in the opera "Lulu" by Alban Berg. Spring Awakening is a
darkly comic attack on the dangers of sexual repression, but it
treats with equal frankness the dangers of unoridled sexual
expression and the exploration of adolescent sexuality.
The central roles of the three children, Melchoir, Moritz
and Wendla, are played by Warren Motley, David Bryant and
Amy Klatzkin, respectively. Constance Moffit, pictured
above, plays the role of Mrs. Gabor.
The production continues through Nov. 15intheNit
ery Theater on the Stanford campus. Tickets are available at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
