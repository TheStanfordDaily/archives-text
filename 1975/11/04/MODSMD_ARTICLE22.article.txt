# Bill Evans: best jazz of the year
## 
### RICHARD CROSS 
Playing "without crutches" (as Ahmad Jainal puts it), that is,
with only drums and bass, pianist Bill Evans treated Palo Alto
audiences to the best jazz they have heard this year.
And the appearance of the Evans trio allowed local audiences to
hear the two best bass players in jazz — Eddie Gomez and Ray
Brown.
Evans has invented a style, a manner of jazz that is distinctively
his, and found a bassist — the remarkable Eddie Gomez — who
finds Evans' style congenial. Together they play with uncanny
sensitivity and precision.
That both men can be superb soloists was attested to repeatedly.
But the emphasis was on melding piano, bass and drums into a
single sound, with no one instrument dominating the musical
alloy.
Mere technical virtuosity is no longer the staple of the piano
based jazz trio. The emphasis now is on creating the kind of sound
that Evans' critics have likened to a perfectly balanced mechanism.
Talents like Oscar Peterson will still entertain, but the future of the
jazz trio lies in the direction that Evans and others (Ahmad Jamal,
for instance) have taken — in the strategy of instrumental together
ness rather than in individual displays of technique.
Evans began each number by stating the melody and then freely
improvising upon it. His way of balancing phrases and varying
themes had a kind of sulky passion about it. He would then be
joined by Gomez and drummer Eliot Zigman.
The diminuitive Gomez looks like a munchkin next to his bass.
He straddles it at the head of the trio — the only instrumentalist
who actually looks out at the audience — like a man hanging on to
the bowsprit of a clipper, but he plays with the facility of a man
handling a cello. He would pick the instrument with a quick sharp
touch, tben bow it with superb tonal and dynamic control.
On all the numbers Zigman did more than merely back Evans and
Gomez up in a tasteful way. Though they did most of the solos,
Zigman's drum line was always an equal third part when they
played as a trio.
Often Evans or Gomez would back each other up with lines
parallel to the soloist's. Behind them the drums moved in and out of
different rhythms in a manner reminiscent of the way Joe Morello
(who also used to play with Evans) has played with Dave Brubeck.
Gomez's bass could also slip back and forth between its dual roles
as a rhythmic and melodic instrument, backing the piano for a few
bars, then suddenly and deftly duplicating the tones of the drums.
The Evans concert was the first of a series of jazz concerts to be
sponsored by the New Varsity Theatre. Palo Alto and Stanford
residents should capitalize on this unprecedented opportunity to
hear first-rate jazz just around the corner.
