# 'Sequoia' offers mixed fare

### RICHARD CROSS 
The spring/summer issue of
Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, treats its readers to a
mixed table of poetic offerings, a
bit of fictional flatulence and a
long but interesting interview
with Emeritus English Prof. Vir
gil K. Whitaker on Shakespeare.
The issue begins with Virginia
De Araujo's two poems "Letter to
Connie in the Maine Woods"
and "Canis Lupus." "Letters" is
a remarkably clear and compel
ling poem written in the lorm of
a supplication to a friend who
has fled her home, her family
and her friends.
To a tight form De Araujo
brings a good ear for sounds and
an honest way of making her
point stick — through the artful
combination of crisp imagery,
changes of scene and inter
worked motifs. The result is the
familiar push and pull of meter,
meaning and emotion.
Well-tuned
David Barton's "Surviving the
Cold" betrays above all a well
tuned ear. The poet sounds his
lines with musical and rhythmic
authority. The imagery at the be
ginning of the poem is both
beautiful and productive of an
idea whose denouement we
await with an aroused appetite.
However the poet fails to
maintain the momentum he has
accumulated and tjie poem loses
itself, gropes for the right finish.
By the end one has the impres

sion that the poet was content to
seek a strong effect and abandon
the harder task of resolving the
lovely dischord that had been set
up.
Mark Eaton's and Mark
Loughridge's poems share the
same problems. Besides lacking
sound rhythmic foundation,
both sprawl in useless imagistic
lassitude — though Loughridge
does achieve one notable suc
cess in the second part of his
"San Francisco Summer."
Regrettably, both poets have
acceded to the popular conven
tion of abandoning punctuation
and/or capitalization. It is a
gimmick intended to lend an
aura of authenticity and profes
sionalism to the poem — like
putting an eye-catching frame
around a dull painting. What is
not in a poem cannot be helped
out by such superficial devices.
Sincere
Gary Smith's "The September
Monarch" is a much more sin
cere attempt to wed emotional
and aesthetic imperatives. Un
fortunately. the poem is so close
to being in meter that it cannot
afford the rhythmic inconsisten
cies that run through it.
Scott Setrakian's "The Story of
the Story of Elmer" is, as the title
suggests, a picture of a picture, a
story about a young man who in
vents a character named Elmer
who is going to write a story.
Elmer, bewitched by the mari
juana muse, cannot keep his im

agined characters separate from
his reality, nor for that matter
can he keep tlieir identities from
becoming confused with his
author's. This idea — an extra
ordinarily difficult one to
good short story out of — enables
Setrakian to bounce erratically
from scene to scene.
Well handled
Some of the scenes and jokes
are amusing and well-handled
(Elmer caps his "You're the
Top" encomium on his
girlfriend's behind by calling it
"a toilet seat designer's wet
dream").
A quasi-moral consideration
begins to disturb the reflections
on Elmer's puddle brain, how
ever. We discover that the story
is not about writing a story after
all; it is a psychodrama about not
being able to write a traditional
kind of story — one with a plot,
characters and so on.
At this point Setrakian rushes
to a Parthian exit, thumb to his
nose, pulling down the curtain
of authorial invisibility behind
him. Elmer finally gets KO'ed by
the dope, and, as his last vestige
of brain percolates into the blank

page, he has a "great idea" —
presumably that ot writing the
story that has just been read.
Long joke
The story reads like a long
joke. Some of Setrakian's fan
tasies are funny, but mere humor
is not fiction. Because an author
chooses to mock the heroics of
writing a conventional story
does not relieve him of the re
sponsibility of writing a good
one.
The only big disaster in
Sequoia is Kenneth Rosen's
"Matin." a poem that tries to
hide a poetic cipher beneath an
all-too-familiar veneer of slick
inscrutability: in this case, a
eucharistic puzzler about a giant
pancake and the trinity who ate
it. In fact, the enigmas are faked.
The author does not bother to at
tempt anything of metrical, im
agistic, or thematic interest.
Readers should not be
ashamed if they cannot intro
duce this poetic farina into their
ears. The poem is adequately
punctuated, however, and
might, if dismembered and laid
out end to end in a paragraph,
serve as a reading selection on
the LSAT.

an honest way of making her
point stick — through the artful
combination of crisp imagery,
changes of scene and inter
worked motifs. The result is the
familiar push and pull of meter,
meaning and emotion.
Well-tuned
David Barton's "Surviving the
Cold" betrays above all a well
tuned ear. The poet sounds his
lines with musical and rhythmic
authority. The imagery at the be
ginning of the poem is both
beautiful and productive of an
idea whose denouement we
await with an aroused appetite.
However the poet fails to
maintain the momentum he has
accumulated and tjie poem loses
itself, gropes for the right finish.
By the end one has the impres

sion that the poet was content to
seek a strong effect and abandon
the harder task of resolving the
lovely dischord that had been set
up.
Mark Eaton's and Mark
Loughridge's poems share the
same problems. Besides lacking
sound rhythmic foundation,
both sprawl in useless imagistic
lassitude — though Loughridge
does achieve one notable suc
cess in the second part of his
"San Francisco Summer."
Regrettably, both poets have
acceded to the popular conven
tion of abandoning punctuation
and/or capitalization. It is a
gimmick intended to lend an
aura of authenticity and profes
sionalism to the poem — like
putting an eye-catching frame
around a dull painting. What is
not in a poem cannot be helped
out by such superficial devices.
Sincere
Gary Smith's "The September
Monarch" is a much more sin
cere attempt to wed emotional
and aesthetic imperatives. Un
fortunately. the poem is so close
to being in meter that it cannot
afford the rhythmic inconsisten
cies that run through it.
Scott Setrakian's "The Story of
the Story of Elmer" is, as the title
suggests, a picture of a picture, a
story about a young man who in
vents a character named Elmer
who is going to write a story.
Elmer, bewitched by the mari
juana muse, cannot keep his im

agined characters separate from
his reality, nor for that matter
can he keep tlieir identities from
becoming confused with his
author's. This idea — an extra
ordinarily difficult one to
good short story out of — enables
Setrakian to bounce erratically
from scene to scene.
Well handled
Some of the scenes and jokes
are amusing and well-handled
(Elmer caps his "You're the
Top" encomium on his
girlfriend's behind by calling it
"a toilet seat designer's wet
dream").
A quasi-moral consideration
begins to disturb the reflections
on Elmer's puddle brain, how
ever. We discover that the story
is not about writing a story after
all; it is a psychodrama about not
being able to write a traditional
kind of story — one with a plot,
characters and so on.
At this point Setrakian rushes
to a Parthian exit, thumb to his
nose, pulling down the curtain
of authorial invisibility behind
him. Elmer finally gets KO'ed by
the dope, and, as his last vestige
of brain percolates into the blank

page, he has a "great idea" —
presumably that ot writing the
story that has just been read.
Long joke
The story reads like a long
joke. Some of Setrakian's fan
tasies are funny, but mere humor
is not fiction. Because an author
chooses to mock the heroics of
writing a conventional story
does not relieve him of the re
sponsibility of writing a good
one.
The only big disaster in
Sequoia is Kenneth Rosen's
"Matin." a poem that tries to
hide a poetic cipher beneath an
all-too-familiar veneer of slick
inscrutability: in this case, a
eucharistic puzzler about a giant
pancake and the trinity who ate
it. In fact, the enigmas are faked.
The author does not bother to at
tempt anything of metrical, im
agistic, or thematic interest.
Readers should not be
ashamed if they cannot intro
duce this poetic farina into their
ears. The poem is adequately
punctuated, however, and
might, if dismembered and laid
out end to end in a paragraph,
serve as a reading selection on
the LSAT.

By the end one has the impres

sion that the poet was content to
seek a strong effect and abandon
the harder task of resolving the
lovely dischord that had been set
up.
Mark Eaton's and Mark
Loughridge's poems share the
same problems. Besides lacking
sound rhythmic foundation,
both sprawl in useless imagistic
lassitude — though Loughridge
does achieve one notable suc
cess in the second part of his
"San Francisco Summer."
Regrettably, both poets have
acceded to the popular conven
tion of abandoning punctuation
and/or capitalization. It is a
gimmick intended to lend an
aura of authenticity and profes
sionalism to the poem — like
putting an eye-catching frame
around a dull painting. What is
not in a poem cannot be helped
out by such superficial devices.
Sincere
Gary Smith's "The September
Monarch" is a much more sin
cere attempt to wed emotional
and aesthetic imperatives. Un
fortunately. the poem is so close
to being in meter that it cannot
afford the rhythmic inconsisten
cies that run through it.
Scott Setrakian's "The Story of
the Story of Elmer" is, as the title
suggests, a picture of a picture, a
story about a young man who in
vents a character named Elmer
who is going to write a story.
Elmer, bewitched by the mari
juana muse, cannot keep his im

agined characters separate from
his reality, nor for that matter
can he keep tlieir identities from
becoming confused with his
author's. This idea — an extra
ordinarily difficult one to
good short story out of — enables
Setrakian to bounce erratically
from scene to scene.
Well handled
Some of the scenes and jokes
are amusing and well-handled
(Elmer caps his "You're the
Top" encomium on his
girlfriend's behind by calling it
"a toilet seat designer's wet
dream").
A quasi-moral consideration
begins to disturb the reflections
on Elmer's puddle brain, how
ever. We discover that the story
is not about writing a story after
all; it is a psychodrama about not
being able to write a traditional
kind of story — one with a plot,
characters and so on.
At this point Setrakian rushes
to a Parthian exit, thumb to his
nose, pulling down the curtain
of authorial invisibility behind
him. Elmer finally gets KO'ed by
the dope, and, as his last vestige
of brain percolates into the blank

page, he has a "great idea" —
presumably that ot writing the
story that has just been read.
Long joke
The story reads like a long
joke. Some of Setrakian's fan
tasies are funny, but mere humor
is not fiction. Because an author
chooses to mock the heroics of
writing a conventional story
does not relieve him of the re
sponsibility of writing a good
one.
The only big disaster in
Sequoia is Kenneth Rosen's
"Matin." a poem that tries to
hide a poetic cipher beneath an
all-too-familiar veneer of slick
inscrutability: in this case, a
eucharistic puzzler about a giant
pancake and the trinity who ate
it. In fact, the enigmas are faked.
The author does not bother to at
tempt anything of metrical, im
agistic, or thematic interest.
Readers should not be
ashamed if they cannot intro
duce this poetic farina into their
ears. The poem is adequately
punctuated, however, and
might, if dismembered and laid
out end to end in a paragraph,
serve as a reading selection on
the LSAT.


COMING SOON' — ASSIJ Special Events presents two shows for November. Dr. Kiresign's
Theatre of Mystery and Dr. Lovecraft's Magical Medicine Show will appear Nov. Bin Memor
ial Auditorium. On Nov. 22 Stephen Stills, with special guests to be announced, will perform
in Maples Pavilion.
The spring/summer issue of
Sequoia, Stanford's literary
magazine, treats its readers to a
mixed table of poetic offerings, a
bit of fictional flatulence and a
long but interesting interview
with Emeritus English Prof. Vir
gil K. Whitaker on Shakespeare.
The issue begins with Virginia
De Araujo's two poems "Letter to
Connie in the Maine Woods"
and "Canis Lupus." "Letters" is
a remarkably clear and compel
ling poem written in the lorm of
a supplication to a friend who
has fled her home, her family
and her friends.
To a tight form De Araujo
brings a good ear for sounds and
an honest way of making her
point stick — through the artful
combination of crisp imagery,
changes of scene and inter
worked motifs. The result is the
familiar push and pull of meter,
meaning and emotion.
Well-tuned
David Barton's "Surviving the
Cold" betrays above all a well
tuned ear. The poet sounds his
lines with musical and rhythmic
authority. The imagery at the be
ginning of the poem is both
beautiful and productive of an
idea whose denouement we
await with an aroused appetite.
However the poet fails to
maintain the momentum he has
accumulated and tjie poem loses
itself, gropes for the right finish.

sion that the poet was content to
