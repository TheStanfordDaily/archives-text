# Springsteen battles myths
## 
### HARLEY PEYTON 
When Bruce Springsteen en
tered from stage right at the
Paramount Theatre last
weekend, he entered to battle all
the myths and hype that sur
round him; he strode out to at
tempt to climb the monumental
peaks of audience anticipation
that awaited rock 'n'roll's latest
messiah.
Time and Newsweek covers,
Springsteen buttons and tee
shirts, a massive promotional
campaign that had gone far
beyond excess — it was begin
ning to sour even the hard core
fanatics. But put a hold on the
crucifixion, because in those
two-and-a-half hours, Bruce
Springsteen blew the house
apart and then rebuilt it from
scratch in his own grand design.
The audience was still weav
ing to its seats when Bill Graham
casually announced "and now
Bruce Springsteen." Lights out
and a muted spot on center stage,
Roy Bittan's piano began the
familiar strains of "Thunder
Road" and a solo figure entered
the lit area and began playing
harmonica. The entire song was
done with only the piano as ac
companiment, a major change
from the songs rock'n'roll at

tack on record.
The audience wasn't sure just
how to react. Many were still
dazed at the prospect of seeing
the performer for the first time;
their reaction was good, but re
strained.
Magic
The tense atmosphere re
mained throughout the first
three numbers. Nervous chatter
and greetings punctuated the
first street rap. an involved in
troduction to "Spirits in the
Night."
But gradually the mass began
to wake up, the Time magazine
described "rush that you live
for" was starting to work its
magic and people listened to a
rock n' roll performer instead
of a media contrived image.
So from the nervous introduc
tion entered the second
part of the concert — the basic
Bruce-blows-you-away-and-
easy segment.
Playing songs from all three of
his albums, he danced and ro
manced the audience to its feet.
Perpetual motion
A study in perpetual motion,
he dashed from microphone to
microphone, stopping for a take
or two with Clarence Clemons.
his sax man and huge presence

in anall-white suit — street slick
to Springsteen's tee-shirt and
jeans. With each number the
crowd climbed ,\ little higher, as
Bruce and his E-Street Band
shifted into overdrive.
When he began "Rosalita,"
probably his most popular
number, everyone took to their
feet, the aisles began to fill and
rock 'n' roll jubilation reigned
supreme. What one might over
look in all this madness is the
brilliant playing of the E-Street
Band.
Those men can play rock 'n'
roll and they played it with a joy
and fervor that was contagious.
Most of the band has been to
gether since high school and it
shows — they play with a love
and respect for each other that is
inspiring.
Encores
The encores really comprised
a third section to the show, as

Springsteen broke into a medley
of Mitch Ryder hits — "C.C. Kid
der," "Devil With the Blue
Dress" and others. Each time he
left the stage the audience
brought him back until the total
reached four. For two of the re
turns he sang with only a piano
accompaniment — Bittan play
ing behind him on "Across The
River" and Bruce sitting down to
the keyboards himself on a
beautifully reworked "For You."
When it was over, he left with
the audience in his hip pocket.
Not one complaint could be
found. Many people said that it
had easily been the best perfor
mance they had ever seen.
Beyond the hype and
magazine covers there lies one
inescapableand joyous reality —
Bruce Springsteen can make you
dance and shout like no one else.
And that's what rock'n'roll is all
about.

Bruce and his E-Street Band
shifted into overdrive.
When he began "Rosalita,"
probably his most popular
number, everyone took to their

rock 'n' roll jubilation reigned

Springsteen broke into a medley
of Mitch Ryder hits — "C.C. Kid

left the stage the audience
brought him back until the total
reached four. For two of the re
turns he sang with only a piano

the keyboards himself on a
beautifully reworked "For You."
When it was over, he left with
the audience in his hip pocket.
Not one complaint could be
