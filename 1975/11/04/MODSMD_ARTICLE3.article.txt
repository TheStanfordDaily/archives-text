## 
### JACK VAUGHN 
The ASSU Senate last night tabled a
motion to ask Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons to look for alternatives to
the traditional Big Game Bonfire.
The motion, by undergraduate Kelly
Thompson.came in responseto Lyons'
written request to the Council of Presi
dents that the Senate offer its "consi
dered opinions" on the Bonfire issue.
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum.
cautioning that the Senate should not
"act hastily" on Lyons' letter, asked for
a postponement of the matter until
Monday.
Fraternity members, generally sup
portive of the Bonfire, readily accepted
Rosenbaum's suggestion to delay any
decision on the matter. Senator Tim
Conway,a Kappa Alpha member, got
unanimous support for his tabling mo
tion.
The Senate was able to postpone its
decision because of a Nov. 11 deadline
given by Lyons in his letter. The next
Senate meeting is Nov. 10.
Boathouse funds
In a 9-6 vote the Senate rejected a
proposal to authorize ASSU Financial
Manager Chris Cline to solicit funds
for improvement of the Lake Lagunita
Boathouse from the University.
The proposal, passed by the newlv
formed Senate Finance Committee,
called for construction of a floating
dock and increased beach area at tin;
Boathouse.
"We feel it is a frivolous expendi
ture," said Senator Timothy Cul
linane. "We should not ask the Uni
versity to spend funds on something it
they don't have to spend them." he
said.

Finance Committee Chairman Kevin
McDermott, supporting the proposal,
said that if the ASSIJ did not accept
funds from the University, "we'll
never see them again."
No guarantee
Cline reported that Ed Shaw, execu
tive assistant to the provost "probably
supports" the allocation of University
funds for the project but said that there
was "no guarantee" of funding.
Earlier, McDermott had noted that
the Senate approved $32,000 last April
for repairs "to bring the Boathouse up
to code," thus eliminating the ques
tion of ASSU funding for repairs.
The Senate approved unanimously a
loan of $1500 to Ramshead, described
by spokesman George McMillan as "a
consortium of dorm-centered drama

groups on campus." The group will
perform the musical Guys and Dolls
later this year, McMillan said.
ASSU Vice President Dave Galligan
reported that the Committee on Stu
dent Services (COSS) will create a
separate subcommittee on graduate
housing so that the present COSS Sub
committee on Student Housing can
operate with only undergraduate rep
resentatives.
The Senate selected four new mem
bers for the Nominations Committee.
They are: Chris Sierra, a doctoral can
didate in political science; Bernice
Zamora, a graduate in English; Larry
Litvak, a senior majoring in
economics; and Steve Vettel, an un
dergraduate.

"We feel it is a frivolous expendi
ture," said Senator Timothy Cul
linane. "We should not ask the Uni
versity to spend funds on something it
they don't have to spend them." he
said.

Finance Committee Chairman Kevin
McDermott, supporting the proposal,
said that if the ASSIJ did not accept
funds from the University, "we'll
never see them again."
No guarantee
Cline reported that Ed Shaw, execu
tive assistant to the provost "probably
supports" the allocation of University
funds for the project but said that there
was "no guarantee" of funding.
Earlier, McDermott had noted that
the Senate approved $32,000 last April
for repairs "to bring the Boathouse up
to code," thus eliminating the ques
tion of ASSU funding for repairs.
The Senate approved unanimously a
loan of $1500 to Ramshead, described
by spokesman George McMillan as "a
consortium of dorm-centered drama

groups on campus." The group will
perform the musical Guys and Dolls
later this year, McMillan said.
ASSU Vice President Dave Galligan
reported that the Committee on Stu
dent Services (COSS) will create a
separate subcommittee on graduate
housing so that the present COSS Sub
committee on Student Housing can
operate with only undergraduate rep
resentatives.
The Senate selected four new mem
bers for the Nominations Committee.
They are: Chris Sierra, a doctoral can
didate in political science; Bernice
Zamora, a graduate in English; Larry
Litvak, a senior majoring in
economics; and Steve Vettel, an un
dergraduate.
