# More campus crime reported

### KARL BOETTNER (First of two parts 
The number of major crimes on campus in
creased slightly during the 1974-75 academic year,
according to a report compiled by Jack Donals,
statistician for Stanford Police Services.
The study showed increases in reported crimes of
assault and battery, rape, burglary, drunk driving,
petty theft and stolen vehicles. The number of
bomb threats, sex crimes, robberies, bicycle thefts
and grand thefts decreased.
Marvin Herrington, director of police services,
said that the increase may reflect a national
trend and that other universities of Stanford's size
have experienced similar increases.
However, he attributed the comparatively low
absolute number of crimes at Stanford to police

work.
The decrease in the number of robberies is "not
significant," Herrington said, because police ex
pect variation in such statistics from year to year.
Despite decreases in bicycle thefts Herrington
called them a "serious problem."
"We're concerned about crimes against people,
and in my opinion, we're in pretty good shape in
those areas," Herrington said. He said that the rate
of crime increase is leveling off, but that the two
recent on-campus murders tend to distort the pic
ture in most people's minds. Victims of two other
murders are believed to have been picked up on
campus.
"For a population of (Stanford's) size, it's not
very nice to contemplate, but you're going to have a
murder now and then; it's just going tn happen,"

Herrington said. None of the murder cases has been
solved.
Cynthia Davis, director of the Center for Research
on Women (CROW) said that the police statistics on
rape were "way under" the actual number of on
campus rapes and assaults with intent to rape.
"Women traditionally haven't wanted to report
rapes because they were treated so inhumanely by
investigators," she said.
"There may well be many more rapes than are
reported," Herrington said. "Police Services has
three women on the force. We don't have a specific
woman assigned to rape cases. If there happens to
be a female officer around, she is assigned to handle
the case, but there's no hard and fast rule that
women must handle rape cases."
Sex crimes, as distinguished from rape, include
"indecent exposure, window peeping . . . that sort
of thing . . for the most part non-violent crimes,
unlike rape. You know, you always get your local
'wand waver.' Herrington commented.
The 1973-74 figure of 16 sex crimes, he said,
could possibly be attributed to the "streaking"
craze of that year.
Drunk driving arrest
The increase in drunk driving arrests, he said,
probably resulted from a police staft increase from
12 to 20 people over the past two years, and from
increased emphasis on traffic-law enforcement
since Police Services assumed responsibility from
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department. The
increase in the number of arrests probably did not
result from an increase in the number of drunk
drivers, Herrington added.
Police Services, however, has found "more par
ties and more drinking" on campus now than in
past years, he reported.
Herrington said the increase in the number of
assault and battery cases is "not significant."

according to a report compiled by Jack Donals,
statistician for Stanford Police Services.
The study showed increases in reported crimes of
assault and battery, rape, burglary, drunk driving,
petty theft and stolen vehicles. The number of
bomb threats, sex crimes, robberies, bicycle thefts
and grand thefts decreased.
Marvin Herrington, director of police services,
said that the increase may reflect a national
trend and that other universities of Stanford's size
have experienced similar increases.
However, he attributed the comparatively low
absolute number of crimes at Stanford to police

work.
The decrease in the number of robberies is "not
significant," Herrington said, because police ex
pect variation in such statistics from year to year.
Despite decreases in bicycle thefts Herrington
called them a "serious problem."
"We're concerned about crimes against people,
and in my opinion, we're in pretty good shape in
those areas," Herrington said. He said that the rate
of crime increase is leveling off, but that the two
recent on-campus murders tend to distort the pic
ture in most people's minds. Victims of two other
murders are believed to have been picked up on
campus.
"For a population of (Stanford's) size, it's not
very nice to contemplate, but you're going to have a
murder now and then; it's just going tn happen,"

Herrington said. None of the murder cases has been
solved.
Cynthia Davis, director of the Center for Research
on Women (CROW) said that the police statistics on
rape were "way under" the actual number of on
campus rapes and assaults with intent to rape.
"Women traditionally haven't wanted to report
rapes because they were treated so inhumanely by
investigators," she said.
"There may well be many more rapes than are
reported," Herrington said. "Police Services has
three women on the force. We don't have a specific
woman assigned to rape cases. If there happens to
be a female officer around, she is assigned to handle
the case, but there's no hard and fast rule that
women must handle rape cases."
Sex crimes, as distinguished from rape, include
"indecent exposure, window peeping . . . that sort
of thing . . for the most part non-violent crimes,
unlike rape. You know, you always get your local
'wand waver.' Herrington commented.
The 1973-74 figure of 16 sex crimes, he said,
could possibly be attributed to the "streaking"
craze of that year.
Drunk driving arrest
The increase in drunk driving arrests, he said,
probably resulted from a police staft increase from
12 to 20 people over the past two years, and from
increased emphasis on traffic-law enforcement
since Police Services assumed responsibility from
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department. The
increase in the number of arrests probably did not
result from an increase in the number of drunk
drivers, Herrington added.
Police Services, however, has found "more par
ties and more drinking" on campus now than in
past years, he reported.
Herrington said the increase in the number of
assault and battery cases is "not significant."
The number of major crimes on campus in
creased slightly during the 1974-75 academic year,
according to a report compiled by Jack Donals,
statistician for Stanford Police Services.
The study showed increases in reported crimes of
assault and battery, rape, burglary, drunk driving,
petty theft and stolen vehicles. The number of
