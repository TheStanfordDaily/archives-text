# Committee investigates lab death

### DAN FIDUCCIA 
The accident committee investigat
ing the accidental death of Charles
Hawley, graduate student in applied
physics,found that "the accident was
probably caused by (Hawley) contact
ing a capacitor charged to high vol
tage. The contact was made with his
hand or arm ..."
The committee of four engineers and
an engineering graduate student re
leased its finding of probable cause
yesterday. The electrocution occurred
in the High TemperatureGasdynamics
Laboratory Oct. 26.
After conducting several experi
ments. the committee specu
lated "that Hawley forgot at the time
of the accident that the capacitor was
being charged, or if aware that the
capacitor was charging, he did not
realize that it had reached a dangerous
voltage level." A capacitor is an elec
trical apparatus which stores electrical
energy.
The committee has forwarded its re
port to William Kays, dean of the
School of Engineering. Kays will for
ward the report to the University Panel
on Health and Safety, which will issue
its own report and any possible safety
recommendations.
The site of the accident,the Shock
Tube Facilty, has been reopened, al
though experiments similar to
Hawley's have not yet been resumed.
Robert Beth. University Director of
Insurance/Risk Management, said the
California State Division of Indus
trial Safety "will not issue a written
report."
