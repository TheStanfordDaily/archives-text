# Primate expert continues to collect data
## Jane Goodall puts Gombe crisis behind her 
### SALLY OURIEFF DAVID SARTORIS 
For Visiting Psychiatry Prof. Jane Goodall, the long
term effects of the Gombe kidnaping are just beginning to
settle in. As creator and director of the Gombe Stream
Research Center, she has undergone a major change in the
focus and orientation of her life and work.
However, Goodall is not one to waste energy lamenting
over misfortunes. She says she is anxious to pick up where
she left off. and to begin coping actively with her situa
tion.
"It is time to realize," she said, "that in spite of the
tragedy, tension and heartache of the kidnaping, the stu
dents are alive and safe. The data collecting and observa
tions at Gombe are able to continue. And the circums
tances have provided a much-needed opportunity for sit
ting down and analyzing the data of the past few years."
She may be tired and discouraged. but her energy never
slackens.
Foreign research prohibited
Since the kidnapings, the Tanzanian government has
prohibited all research by foreigners along the shore and
periphery of LakeTanganvika.This policy applies to the
Gombe center as well as toa neighboring Japanese facility.
Although Goodall can no longer conduct active re
search there, she is allowed to visit for a limited duration
of up to one week. In addition, when at her home in
Dar-es-Salaam. she is in constant radio communication
with the research facility.
However, the chimp and baboon research is being con
tinued at the center by a staff of Tanzanians trained at the
university in Dar-es-Salaam. Under the protection of a

six-to-10-member government security force, theyare still
free to conduct field observations according to the normal
schedule — 24 hours a day. six days a week.
Fortunately, with the exception of the kidnaped stu
dents' personal research notes (used as cigarette paper by
the rebels), the rest of the Gombe data was left perfectly
intact.
Dim possibilities
Goodall sadly comments that the possibility of Stanford
students ever returning to East Gombe is very dim.
"I wouldn't want to take the risk of that sort of thing ever
happening again," she says."I feel that never, ever will we
be able to build up the numbers of students that were there
in the past.
"This is very sad. particularly for students like Barbara
Smuts whose work had just begun."
For many others as well, plans and programs have been
drastically altered. However, according to Human Biology
Prof. David Hamburg, who was highly instrumental in the
founding of this student program, other types of field
opportunities are available. Although there are no acces
sible areas for chimp observation, baboon studies in the
more secure, central Tanzanian national parks are defi
nitely a possibility.
No energy
The creation of a totally new chimpanzee observation
center, perhaps in a different country of greater security,
seems a good solution to many outside people. However,
Goodall, still looking weary and drained from the past
experience, says,"I simply wouldn't have the energy to do
it all over again. The sheer value of the Gombe study lies in
its long-term nature. It is too bad that it happens to be in

such an insecure location."
One of the side effects of the Combe kidnaping was
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's questioning of the
involvement of W. Beverly Carter, U.S. ambassador to
Tanzania. Carter was a principle figure in the ransom
negotiations.
Shortly after the incident, Carter's scheduled appoint
ment as the new ambassador to Denmark was canceled.
Hamburg, also influential in the negotiations, notes,
"I am skeptical about the reason the government gave
for the change in Carter's appointment (i.e., that he com
promised the U.S. terrorism policy); however, the situa
tion has now been favorably resolved. He has been offered
another very good job in the state department and we are
very pleased it has turned out well for hirn."
Guidance role
When the student program was in existence at East
Combe, Goodall's role was more one of guidance than
anything else. One student explains, "Jane lived 'down
stairs'fby Lake Tanganyika),near the baboon beach troop.
Most of us lived 'upstairs'(further up the hill), closer to the
chimps. We went to her for specific guidance or as a
resource for our projects, but as far as our daily contact
with her. it tended to be limited."
Goodall's own projects required a good deal of her time.
Her immediate interests were, and continue to be, the
interaction between primate communities and troops. As
this is a very complex facet of primate l»ehavior, much
work still needs to be done. "One interesting event was
recently documented," Goodall says."The rare killing of a
female chimp by males of another community."
