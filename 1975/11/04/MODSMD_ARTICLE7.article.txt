# Keep theme houses
## 
### 
The Oct. 29 Daily column by
David Nimmerand Michael Rain
stated that the minority theme
houses on campus "all grant
admission priority on the basis
of birth" and that these houses,
besides perpetuating segrega
tion, "inhibit contact between
persons of different back
grounds because of their insular
nature."
Nimmer and Rain present an
argument that is based on dis
torted information which they
attempt to pass oft as fact.
Granted, minority students
have a residence priority "based
on birth." Hut that priority is li
mited to 50 percent of the total
space for each house.
Nimmerand Rain feel this pol
icy is "unconscionable," but is
anyone being shortchanged by
this supposedly segregationist
admissions policy? Theme
houses do not have non
minority students pounding on
their doors.
The fact that theme houses do
not perpetuate segregation is
evidenced by the percentage of
minorities currently living in
these houses: 140 from a total of
over 1000 minority under
graduates. The percentages of
minorities within the theme
houses are: 50 percent black in
Olivo-Magnolia. 35 percent
chicano in Zapata and 60 per
cent Asian-American in Junip
ero; hardly an oppressive major
ity, as the article implies.
This balanced distribution of
non-minoritv and minority in-

Lowery, et. a I

dividuals, in fact, promotes
"contact between persons of dif
ferent backgrounds."
The suggested dilution of the
small numbers of minorities
would not appreciably increase
the percentage of non-white stu
dents in University residences,
and the end result would be the
atomization of these students in
the community. More impor
tantly, the isolation of these
minority students would not be
conducive to any cross-cultural
exchange.
Ethnic group members alone
cannot express the full range of
their culture — ethnicity is ex
pressed through communities.
Their statement that members
of minority groups who wish to
live among others of their own
background hold "parochial de
sires" totally ignores thecultural
programs that these theme
houses provide for the entire
Stanford community.
Implicit in Nimmerand Rain's
assumption is the expectation
that cross-cultural exchange de
pends solely on the initiative of
minority students. All people
havea natural desire to maintain
their own culture, but when
minorities act upon this com
mon desire, they are labelled as
separatists.
Cultural exchange is a mutual
responsibility and theme houses
do their part.

Implicit in Nimmerand Rain's
assumption is the expectation
that cross-cultural exchange de
pends solely on the initiative of
minority students. All people
havea natural desire to maintain
their own culture, but when
minorities act upon this com

separatists.
Cultural exchange is a mutual
responsibility and theme houses
do their part.

The Oct. 29 Daily column by
David Nimmerand Michael Rain
stated that the minority theme
houses on campus "all grant
admission priority on the basis
of birth" and that these houses,
besides perpetuating segrega
tion, "inhibit contact between
persons of different back
grounds because of their insular
nature."
Nimmer and Rain present an
argument that is based on dis
torted information which they
attempt to pass oft as fact.
Granted, minority students
have a residence priority "based
on birth." Hut that priority is li
mited to 50 percent of the total
space for each house.
Nimmerand Rain feel this pol
icy is "unconscionable," but is
anyone being shortchanged by
this supposedly segregationist
admissions policy? Theme
houses do not have non
minority students pounding on
their doors.
The fact that theme houses do
not perpetuate segregation is
evidenced by the percentage of
minorities currently living in
these houses: 140 from a total of
over 1000 minority under
graduates. The percentages of
minorities within the theme
houses are: 50 percent black in
Olivo-Magnolia. 35 percent
chicano in Zapata and 60 per
cent Asian-American in Junip
ero; hardly an oppressive major
ity, as the article implies.
This balanced distribution of
non-minoritv and minority in-

Lowery, et. a I

dividuals, in fact, promotes
"contact between persons of dif
ferent backgrounds."
The suggested dilution of the
small numbers of minorities
would not appreciably increase
the percentage of non-white stu
dents in University residences,
and the end result would be the
atomization of these students in
the community. More impor
tantly, the isolation of these
minority students would not be
conducive to any cross-cultural
exchange.
Ethnic group members alone
cannot express the full range of
their culture — ethnicity is ex
pressed through communities.
Their statement that members
of minority groups who wish to
live among others of their own
background hold "parochial de
sires" totally ignores thecultural
programs that these theme
houses provide for the entire
Stanford community.
