# Revelation of faculty pay needed
## 
### 
Although many academics
deplore needless secrecy in bus
iness and government, many tac
itly condone secrecy in univer
sities. Stanford professors, for
example, have seldom spoken
out against the administration's
refusal to reveal faculty and ad
ministrative salaries.
The University currently pub
lishes only the mean — not me
dian — salary statistics of its pro
fessors. In the School of
Humanities and Sciences,
means are given according to
rank (assistant, associate and full
professor) and according to area
(natural sciences, social sciences
and humanities) but not accord
ing to department.
The University's refusal to
publish salary medians accord
ing to department is potentially
unfair to professors.
Education Prof. Edward Tex
tor, president of the Stanford
chapter of the American Associ
ation of University Professors
(AAUP) told the Daily last week
that department chairmen are
potentially able to persuade fa
culty members to forego salary
increases since they are unaware
of how their salaries compare
with those of other professors.
No conspiracy
Textor emphasizes that he is
sure this refusal does not involve
any organized conspiracy by the
administration. But he said that
in some cases, chairmen proba
bly have taken advantage of sec
recy about salaries to deny raises
to deserving professors.
"Secrecy is a cloak for possible
exploitation." Textor said. "It is
all good and well to say that con
fidentiality protects the dignity
of individual professors, but it
also permits the administrators
to pull the wool over theireyes."
Administrators argue that the
publication of mean salaries is
adequate to enable professors to
compare their salaries with
those of other professors.
* But the mean is not as reveal
ing as the median, since in every

department, a few well known
professors make salaries that are
much higher than those of others
of the same rank in the depart
ment.
Furthermore, the
administration's refusal to pro
vide a departmental break-down
of salaries is potentially unfair to
professors. If professors in one
department were favored over
those in another, no non
administrator would ever know
that this abuse had occurred.
Abuses possible
While there is e no evidence
that such unfairness has taken
place, it seems unnecessary for
the administration to allow a
system to exist that could allow
such abuses.
The refusal to reveal faculty
salaries is especially unfair to
junior professors in the profes
sional schools, where professors
have what is known as "high
outside marketability" for their
skills.
Their ignorance of what
salaries they might expect with
more seniority hinders them in
deciding whether or not to ac
cept more lucrative positions
outside academia.
Deep roots
The refusal of the administra
tion to reveal faculty salaries has
its roots deep in the past. Secrecy
about salaries probably grew out
of a view of the academic life as a
quasi-religious calling.
Public discussion of mundane
salaries therefore seemed in bad
taste. Professors were expected
to pursue their careers for the joy
of learning rather than to make
money.

It is still true today that the
intellectual life is a high calling.
Most professors have chosen it
for non-financial reasons, since
most could make more money in
other vocations.
But salaries do exist and for
the administration to refuse to
discuss them in any detail is to
ignore reality. Paradoxically,
this secrecy may actually prom
ote intrigue and speculation that
distracts scholars from their real
work.
Textor noted last week that
"we (faculty) are inhibited from
being a community of scholars
when we fear we are being rip
ped off."
Fortunately, there are signs
that Textor and other
likeminded professors plan to
start calling attention to prob

lems inherent in salary secrecy.
In a survey recently sent by the
AAUP to professors of all ranks,
more than about one-third of re
spondents said they would like
to have the administration exp
lore the possibility of releasing
more detailed salary informa
tion.
But the administration should
not merely release a little
information. In order to avoid
any abuses and inequities, the
administration should publicize
all information about faculty
salaries.
There is no excuse for conti rul
ing secrecy.
