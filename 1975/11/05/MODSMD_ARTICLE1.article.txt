# Law Lounge to stop ads
## Lyons cites TDS competition 
### WARREN LEIGHT 
Kood vendors in the Law School
Lounge have been forced to cease <id
vertisi ng their operations becausethey
threaten to hike business away from
the tinancially troubled TDS.Inc. food
outlets in Tresidder Union and Encina
An ad placed in the last month Daily
bv tin; Lounge's law-student operators
drew objections from Tresidder chief
Dan Williams, an associate dean of
student affairs.
"I called its attention to (Dean of
Student Affairs) James Lyons and ob
jected to it." Williams said. "The satel
lite eating areas on campus have taken

business away from Tresidder. con
tributing to the Union's deficit. I felt it
shortsighted to let these operations
grow."
University subsidies
Lyons ordered the Law Lounge and
other lounges in academic buildings
not to advertise, reasoning that lounge
operations benefit from University
subsidized overhead costs and thus are
able to compete unfairly price-wise
with the autonomous TDS operations.
TDS outlets such as the Transition
must pay all overhead costs and are
expected to remain open at non-peak
hours. Lyons said.
As a result, an "agreement was
carved out" to limit the lounges' ad
vertising. Lyons said.
'Unspoken threats
Members of the Law Association,
who operate the Law Lounge, have ac
quiesced in Lyons' request, and are re
luctant to criticize it publicly because
of "unspoken threats of overhead as
sessments which, if instituted, could
end the lounges."
One student summarized their
views, noting."To isolate the lounges
and their facilities is unfair. They are
providing an alternative, a meeting
place for law or biz students, and a
means of interaction between grad
students and undergrads."
financial considerations mitigate
the lounges' benefit, according to Wil
liams. "There is great value in the
lounges — comraderie, convenience
— but they ought not compete for
non-professional .school
business.People should realize there is
a financial consequence to the Union."
Competition has affected
Tresidder's business. William said.
"Our sales dip as the less-expensive
satellites grow," he added.
Diversity and atmosphere
A Law Lounge source, however,
countered. "The Lounge doesn't com
pete on prices; people come for diver
sity and the atmosphere." Neverthe
less, the lounge did boast 10-cent cof
fee in its Daily advertisement.
Atmosphere, however, was cited
frequently as a positive factor by un
dergrads eating at the Law Lounge.

Sophomore Whitney Hatch stopped
chewing his roast beef to note, "Tre
sidder is a great place for a 'never yel
lows' floor wax ad. but as a place to
eat . . . forget it." Others agreed.
Williams claimed he is currently
drawing up budget recommendations
for improvements in the Transition's
atmosphere, but that it needs a large
enough return on the investment to
warrant the outlay — return in the
form of customers.
Although Tresidder outlets and the
End na Commons are operated by TDS,
Inc., the University is obligated to fi
nance a portion of the annual deficits
of the operations. As part of its effort to
erase the red ink, Stanford is attempt
ing to bolster patronage at TDS
facilities.

business away from Tresidder. con
tributing to the Union's deficit. I felt it
shortsighted to let these operations
grow."
University subsidies
Lyons ordered the Law Lounge and
other lounges in academic buildings
not to advertise, reasoning that lounge
operations benefit from University
subsidized overhead costs and thus are
able to compete unfairly price-wise
with the autonomous TDS operations.
TDS outlets such as the Transition
must pay all overhead costs and are
expected to remain open at non-peak
hours. Lyons said.
As a result, an "agreement was
carved out" to limit the lounges' ad
vertising. Lyons said.
'Unspoken threats
Members of the Law Association,
who operate the Law Lounge, have ac
quiesced in Lyons' request, and are re
luctant to criticize it publicly because
of "unspoken threats of overhead as
sessments which, if instituted, could
end the lounges."
One student summarized their
views, noting."To isolate the lounges
and their facilities is unfair. They are
providing an alternative, a meeting
place for law or biz students, and a
means of interaction between grad
students and undergrads."
financial considerations mitigate
the lounges' benefit, according to Wil
liams. "There is great value in the
lounges — comraderie, convenience
— but they ought not compete for
non-professional .school
business.People should realize there is
a financial consequence to the Union."
Competition has affected
Tresidder's business. William said.
"Our sales dip as the less-expensive
satellites grow," he added.
Diversity and atmosphere
A Law Lounge source, however,
countered. "The Lounge doesn't com
pete on prices; people come for diver
sity and the atmosphere." Neverthe
less, the lounge did boast 10-cent cof
fee in its Daily advertisement.
Atmosphere, however, was cited
frequently as a positive factor by un
dergrads eating at the Law Lounge.

Sophomore Whitney Hatch stopped
chewing his roast beef to note, "Tre
sidder is a great place for a 'never yel
lows' floor wax ad. but as a place to
eat . . . forget it." Others agreed.
Williams claimed he is currently
drawing up budget recommendations
for improvements in the Transition's
atmosphere, but that it needs a large
enough return on the investment to
warrant the outlay — return in the
form of customers.
Although Tresidder outlets and the
End na Commons are operated by TDS,
Inc., the University is obligated to fi
nance a portion of the annual deficits
of the operations. As part of its effort to
erase the red ink, Stanford is attempt

facilities.
