# Minorities' complaints still misunderstood
## 
### 
from letters to the Daily in re
cent weeks, it seems apparent
that two old controversies will
soon return to haunt us anew.
First, there will be another
round of critiques of ethnic
theme houses. Second, with the
Big Game against Cal approach
ing, there will be cries of "Bring
back the Indians!"
Both issues will be pressed by
•disproportionately white con
stituencies. and although much
of the fuel for the debate will be
furnished by an undercurrent of
racism, more of the controversy
will result simply from a lack of
understanding.
The second issue is easier to
address than the first.
Stanford students are justifi
ably annoyed at having to root
tor a football team with no mas
cot. After all. when "Cardinal" is
only the color, there is little
room for originality.
But the idea that students
would be much more enthusias
tic about a team called the In
dians is absurd: They would
cheer a team that won; they boo
one and are bored by one which
fails to do so.
More to the point, however, it
is important to recall why the
Indian was eliminated as the
team's symbol. Ethnic
stereotypes are intrinsically ra
cist. Intent is unimportant.
Hence, the statement that all
Asian Americans are geniuses is
no less racist than that that all
blacks are lazy.
What it meant
Defenders of the Indian mas
cot try to explain that no offense
was intended toward the Native
American community. In fact,
they say. the Indian symbolized
braverv. strength, power and so
forth. How. they ask, can anyone
be offended?
The Native American com
munity was generally offended,
and said so. Moreover, others
with ethnic sensitivities ob
jected.
Imagine a team called the
Northern Alabama Nigras. sym
bolizing swiftness ("They all
can run fast!"), cunning ("And
they (ihvuys finds ways to get
around the rules.") and an abil

ity to laugh at adversity ("Didn't
they sing in the cotton fields?").
How could anyone be offended?
Word attacked
Ethnic minorities generally
have problems enough without
being set up for public ridicule
as mascots of teams. It is dow
nright hypocritical for people to
support such a mascot while
doing nothing for the oppressed
people in the community.
But that mindset has many
similarities to the one which ob
jects to the "segregation" im
plicit in theme houses for ethnic
cultu res.
"Segregation" is a funny
word. It refers to prohibiting one
group, based on some identifi
able characteristic, from using
facilities which another such
group can use freely.
Somehow, it seems too strong
a word for a voluntary effort by
an ethnic minority to preserve
much of its culture within a
somewhat alien, white envi
ronment.
No one is required to live in a
theme house; no one is prohi
bited from doing so. And its
criteria for "preferential admis
sion" are more objective than
those of fraternities and at least
as objective as the nebulous con
cept of "present residence prior
ity."
Cultural pluralism
It is unfortunate that so many
white people have such a hard
time understanding the neces
sity or reasoning behind cultural
pluralism. Really, they need
look no further than the writings
of one of their own, Jean-Paul
Sartre, in Black Orpheus. He
discusses at length the need for
an "antiracist" isolation to com
bat a racist one.
But such a debate need not be
couched in purely philosophical
terms. Surely any group should
be able to do its best to per
petuate its culture, not necessar
ily as a totally separate entity,
hut as a part of a larger whole.
The University's ethnic
minorities are trying to do ex
actly that: allow cultures to co
exist. The University administ
ration has seen fit to assist in this
effort by establishing houses

where large groups of students
from one ethnic group can live
and work together.
Some have drawn unfavorable
analogies with the French
I louse. There, everyone wanting
the plush surroundings must
evince an interest in French cul
ture.
Why so terrible?
But in the minority theme
houses — Casa Zapata. Junipero.
Olivo-Magnolia and, to a lesser
extent, Gavilan — "only" half
the residents are necessarily
members of the minority group.
Why is this so terrible? (None of
this should imply any criticism

of the French House, but only of
the analogy )
However, the criticism of
theme houses at any time should
not be so terribly surprising.
Frequently, it stems from an ap
parently uniquely white idea
that equality must mean assimi
lation. that no subcultures can
coexist within the larger one. in
short, that to treat all people as
equal means to treat them all as
white.
Hut then, perhaps there really
are those who would like to see
the University's housing system
as one. big white theme house
with (as the letter from some
Whitman residents proudly
noted) only six percent
minorities —carefully trained as
white, of course. The only excep
tion would be those cute little
red men leading the football
team onto the field.
