Mothers pay, too
Editor:
Regarding the headline tor tin
article on tuition increases
printed in the Oct. 31 Daily
which read "D.ul will pay. claim
students." I would like to note
that my mother pays for as much
of my tuition as my father.
In fact, the mothers of many
Stanford students work and pay
part or all of their children's tui
tion. Therefore, the title to your
article was .1 poor choice.

Indecisive Senate
Well, our incomparable ASSI'
Senate has proved once again
that indecisiveness is as integral
,i part of our student government
as it is on the football team.
It seems that the Bonfire ques
tion is beyond its intelligence, as
evidenced by its quick wit ted
decision to forget the whole
thing until the next senate meet
ing.
There are several rumors cir
culating about the reason for the
delay. Some say ASSI! President
Lee Rosenbaum had a date.
Others say Tom Conway sec
onded the- motion to delay a de
cision because they were screw
ing in .1 light bulb at the kA
house and they needed help
turning the ladder.
Regardless of the reason. I'm
sure all the senators are thinking
about the problem right now.
But it not. 1 have a suggestion.
Why don't we ask the student
body to limit its driving on Fri
day and Saturday to an absolute
minimum. Then reserve special
parking areas next to the
stadium for cars containing four
or more people. Cars with fewer
would be forced to park in less
desirable areas, bike Mountain
View.
Now. if we did this lor the two
remaining games. I'm sure it
would negate the amount of pol
lution introduced into the envi
ronment by the Bonfire.
So come on now, senators,
(live the student body a reason
why this wouldn't work.
