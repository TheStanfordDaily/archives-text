# The 						band is disgusting
## 
### 
The athletic department has created a monster
that is biting the hand that is feeding it.
The pride and joy of Saturday afternoons, the
Leland Stanford Junior Marching Band
(LSJt 1MB), has gotten out of hand. The act ions and
remarks of this organization are deplorable.
Several years ago. the band was original, clever,
a pride to Stanford athletics and school spirit
Now it is simply grotesque and disgraceful.
There is not one formation that should not be
censored.
The half-time entertainment is disgusting and
in very poor taste. The formations are lewd and
unimaginative. The spell-outs, filthy.
The more clever the entertainment, the less
filthy it has to be.
The band has done little to give support or en
courage school spirit in a constructive manner.
Weall may despise theTrojan marching band, but
one can feel the school spirit it generates as it
marches onto the field
The band is to blame for a lot of the hard feelings
between students and participating athletes. This
is not only trim during football, but true especially
during basketball games.

cause this is the least home-town crowd in the
Pac-8.
Saturday. Oct. 25. I overheard remarks which
made me wish that I were a Trojan.
As the Washington State University football
team was entering the stadium, many hand mem
bers who were standing at the entranceway began
yelling, "Kill Cordova." "Hit No. 16," "Go get
him," and even one. "Hit Christiansen." I don't
mention this to embarrass our athletes.
This action is deplorable, disgusting, despica
ble and extremely immature. And I might add that
everyone of those cowardly brats was wearing a
mask at the time.
The band is a monster and it should be killed
now.
1 suggest cutting off all athletic department
funds retroactive to Oct. 25, 1975. And the band
should be put on probation for the rest ot the year.
I also strongly urge an official reprimand. The
situation has been growing worse and this latest
incident should be the last straw.
The band must be held responsible for its im
maturity.

As the Washington State University football
team was entering the stadium, many hand mem
bers who were standing at the entranceway began
yelling, "Kill Cordova." "Hit No. 16," "Go get
him," and even one. "Hit Christiansen." I don't
mention this to embarrass our athletes.
This action is deplorable, disgusting, despica
ble and extremely immature. And I might add that
everyone of those cowardly brats was wearing a
mask at the time.
The band is a monster and it should be killed
now.
1 suggest cutting off all athletic department
funds retroactive to Oct. 25, 1975. And the band
should be put on probation for the rest ot the year.
I also strongly urge an official reprimand. The
situation has been growing worse and this latest
incident should be the last straw.
The band must be held responsible for its im
maturity.
