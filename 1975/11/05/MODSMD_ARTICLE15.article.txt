## Joggers hit the (pant!) trail at Angell Field 
### DAVID SARTORIS 
In recent years, the jogger
has become a familiar sight
on streets and athletic fields
throughout America. Stan
lord is no exception — at the
prime times of noon and 5
p.m.. Angell Field may well
be the most popular place on
campus. Hundreds of other
runners are found panting
down campus roads and trails
at all hours of the day.
What is so attractive about
being in a great hurry to get
nowhere in particular? Jog
ging is a personal habit. Dif
ferent people do it for differ
ent reasons.
According to track coach G.
Payton Jordan Jr., the reasons
why people run are twofold:
"First, it gives the individual
the personal satisfaction of
doing something vitally im
portant.
"Second, running repres
ents an attempt to get into bet
ter physical condition or to
maintain fitness," he says.

"Most people do it for the
sheer joy of it."
'Frustrated'
A large number of under
graduate runners are what
might be termed "frustrated
athletes." One male student
says,"I played three sports in
high school, but found the
competition too tough here.
So. I took up running as a
freshman and have been at it
ever since."
Health-conscious indi
viduals make up a large per
centage of the jogging
populace. "Several years ago.
I realized that I was rapidly
going to pot at my desk job,"
says one staff member. "Now,
instead of smoking three or
four cigarettes at lunchtime,
I'm out here putting in three
or four miles."
The great majority of Stan
ford runners appear to be
waging their own battle of the
bulge.
"Beer and dorm food were
playing havoc with my sexy

build." one male jogger says.
"I wasn't about to give up
those pleasures, so 1 pay the
price with a little pain every
day at the track."
Pleasure
Although many runners
consider their habit a neces
sary chore, there are those
who derive extreme pleasure
and self-satisfaction from it.
As one jogger put it. "Run
ning makes me feel good
physically.
An ever-increasing number
of women have also incorpo
rated jogging into their lifes
tyles. "1 started running to
lose weight." one woman
notes. "At first it was a bur
den. but gradually I've
learned to love it."
The jogger's reason for
running is often as unique as
his stride;. One student sim
ply says. "Because it's there."
Another gasps. "Beats me."
The thoughts which cross
the runner's mind vary. One
says he imagines he's in the

Olympic stadium, "about to
collapse after winning the
marathon." Another male
runner admits that his moti
vation comes from following
female joggers.
Another familiar sight
around Angel 1 Field is
French Prof. Alphonse Juil
land. world record holder at
100 and 220 yards for men 50
and over.
"What makes me run?"
says Juilland. "A deep-seated
frustration — something like
an unconsuinmated love af
fair. I started running track
when 1 was sixteen. World
War 11 put a stop to it.
"If 1 had had a chance to
develop, to compete, to break
a few records, to make the
1942 European champion
ships or the aborted 1044
Olympics, that would have
been that. But it wasn't to be
and 1 was left with this long
ing. Here I am, a man in his
50s who conceals a teenager's
dream in his heart "

be the most popular place on
campus. Hundreds of other
runners are found panting
down campus roads and trails
at all hours of the day.
What is so attractive about
being in a great hurry to get
nowhere in particular? Jog
ging is a personal habit. Dif
ferent people do it for differ
ent reasons.
According to track coach G.
Payton Jordan Jr., the reasons
why people run are twofold:
"First, it gives the individual
the personal satisfaction of
doing something vitally im
portant.
"Second, running repres
ents an attempt to get into bet
ter physical condition or to
maintain fitness," he says.

"Most people do it for the
sheer joy of it."
'Frustrated'
A large number of under
graduate runners are what
might be termed "frustrated
athletes." One male student
says,"I played three sports in
high school, but found the
competition too tough here.
So. I took up running as a
freshman and have been at it
ever since."
Health-conscious indi
viduals make up a large per
centage of the jogging
populace. "Several years ago.
I realized that I was rapidly
going to pot at my desk job,"
says one staff member. "Now,
instead of smoking three or
four cigarettes at lunchtime,
I'm out here putting in three
or four miles."
The great majority of Stan
ford runners appear to be
waging their own battle of the
bulge.
"Beer and dorm food were
playing havoc with my sexy

build." one male jogger says.
"I wasn't about to give up
those pleasures, so 1 pay the
price with a little pain every
day at the track."
Pleasure
Although many runners
consider their habit a neces
sary chore, there are those
who derive extreme pleasure
and self-satisfaction from it.
As one jogger put it. "Run
ning makes me feel good
physically.
An ever-increasing number
of women have also incorpo
rated jogging into their lifes
tyles. "1 started running to
lose weight." one woman
notes. "At first it was a bur
den. but gradually I've
learned to love it."
The jogger's reason for
running is often as unique as
his stride;. One student sim
ply says. "Because it's there."
Another gasps. "Beats me."
The thoughts which cross
the runner's mind vary. One
says he imagines he's in the

Olympic stadium, "about to
collapse after winning the
marathon." Another male
runner admits that his moti
vation comes from following
female joggers.
Another familiar sight
around Angel 1 Field is
French Prof. Alphonse Juil
land. world record holder at
100 and 220 yards for men 50
and over.
"What makes me run?"
says Juilland. "A deep-seated
frustration — something like
an unconsuinmated love af
fair. I started running track
when 1 was sixteen. World
War 11 put a stop to it.
"If 1 had had a chance to
develop, to compete, to break
a few records, to make the
1942 European champion
ships or the aborted 1044
Olympics, that would have
been that. But it wasn't to be
