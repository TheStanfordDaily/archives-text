CLAREMONT. Calif. (AP) —
Controversial Communist,
feminist and black militant
Angela Davis resumes her career
as college teacher this week, and
the college that hired her is al
ready sorry about it.
The man who offered In-r the
job tit exclusive — and conserva
tive — Claremont Colleges has
been fired. Some officials say he
may have hired Davis to embar
rass Claremont.
Claremont's governing body
voted to withdraw the job offer,
but Davis had already signed the
contract.
She was not available for
comment yesterday, herattorney
said.
The announcement that she
would teach a series of weekend
classes on "Black Women and
the Development of the Black
Community" has brought
threats from alumni and donors
warning that endowments for
the half-dozen small, private and
very expensive colleges 30 miles
east of Los Angeles might be
cancelled.
Davis was hired at Claremont
by James Carrett. who was fired
last spring as director of the
Black Studies Center at the col
leges.
