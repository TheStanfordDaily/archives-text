### DAVE SARTORIS 
Stanford-in-Stanford, proposed re
sidential college program shelved last
spring, may become a reality in
1976-77. according to Assoc. English
Prof. William Chace.
Originally scheduled to begin this
quarter. Stanford-in-Stanford is de
signed to provide the opportunity for
students to engage in intellectual ac
tivity beyond the constraints of tradi
tional in-class education.
The program is intended to offer par
ticipating students closer interaction
with faculty members and sustained
collaboration with fellow' students.
Chace has suggested the program
focus on American studies next year.
He and Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy
were strong proponents of the program
for this year.
Although Chace said he would not
be able to participate in a live-in prog
ram because of family responsibilities,
he said he would "encourage other fa
culty members to participate." and
would discuss the matter with Relig
ions Studies Prof. William Clebsch,
who heads the American Studies
Committee.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affiars Larry
I lorton indicated he expects a decision
on a program for next year by mid
winter. "The COSS(Committeeon Ser
vices to Students) subcommittee on
housing is currently meeting to dis
cuss guidelines for evaluation of
theme house proposals. I am entirely
in favor of a residential study program
it a suitable focus can be found." he
commented.
Chace said. "The chances of estab
lishing some sort of program are good,
but not great. Lots of things must still
gel before this can be realistically
talked about as a program. My hopes,
as well as those of Kennedy and
Clebsch. are high, but it will be a
month or so before we can make any
definite statements."
According to former ASSU Presi
dent Mike Herman, the program's in
itiator. the plan for this year fell
through for several reasons.
"From the outset, our proposals
were plagued by bad press treatment
and criticism from the administration.
In addition, the manner in which the
program was described as well as the
focus on arms control and disarma
ment were apparently unattractive to
students." he said
In mid-July, Horton pledged finan
cial support for a new program, pro
vided sufficient student interest is
demonstrated. The Stanford-in-
Stanford program for this year vvtfs to
be funded jointly by the Office of Resi
dential Education and the Offices of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and the Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences. The projected cost was $7500.
