## Chris postpones QB decision 
### DAVE SMITH 
For the first time this season
Jack Christiansen is hedging.
"We haven't picked a starting
quarterback yet." the Cardinal
head football coach told tlx;
Northern California Football
Writers yesterday "We'll decide
on a starter someti me this week.
"We'll be playing each quar
terback 50 percent of the time
with the first team in practice,"
(ihris added. "It may just be that
we'll have to pick someone at
1 :29 on Saturday."
At 1 :30, of course, the (lards
wi II take on the I JSC Trojans in
the I.os Angeles Coliseum in
their last match with I JSC
mentor John McKay. Under
M< K.iv. the Trojans haven't lost
more than one game in the sea
son since 1971, but after their
20-14 loss to Cal Saturday, they
need a win to stay in the Pacific
Fight Race.
No Irick
So do the Cards, but Christian*
sen denied that delaying the
quarterback decision was a
stratagem designed to keep
McKay guessing. "It's nothing
sneaky." claimed Chris.
"They're going to throw the
same defense at us no matter
who we put in there."
Ch list ia nsen pronounced
himself not completely satisfied
with the play of either Card quar
terback. starter Mike Cordova or
Guy benjamin, in last weekend's
closer-than-expected 20-22 win
over ()regon State.
"They did some things that
need correcting," said Chris.
"And they'll definitely have to
correct them if we're going to
win this week."
Michel hack
Christiansen also announced
that Mike Michel, kept out of the
last two games because of a ham
string pull, would return as
punter for the I ISC game. "He's
been kicking 60- and 70-yarders
in practice," raved the Card
coach. The Stanford punting
game, though, is the worst in the
conference with a "punting effi
ciency" of 29 yards per kick.
Fven with the I JSC game com
ing up. however, Christiansen
had a hard time attracting atten
tion from (ial's Mike White, who

said he thought his star running
back. Chuck Muncie, should get
the Heisman Trophy.
"You know all the reasons
why.' said White. "I stuck my
neck out List year for Steve B.irt
kowski and I'm doing it again
this year. I think Chuck is the
hest in the country."
Muncie certainly won over the
writers this week after his
145-yard day against I'SC. The
Hear senior has been named to
IJPI's and AP's Backfield of the
Week, and earned Pac-8 and
Spurts Illustrated Offensive
Flayer of the Week citations.
Cardinal notes: Running back
Ron Inge and linebacker Dan
Francis, both starters, have been
going at half-speed in practice
because of mild injuries, but
should be ready for the
Trojans . . . The Cards' last USC
game in Los Angeles was a 27-20
loss, with Chris Limahelu of the
Rose Howl-bound Trojans kick
ing a 34-yard field goal in the last
second. . . .

forever, but Bonnie McColl provided an acceptable substitute by
donning a modest headdress during the Washington State-Stanford
game.
