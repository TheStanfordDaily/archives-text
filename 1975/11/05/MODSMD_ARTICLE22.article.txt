## Rose Bowl math 
### Paul Bauman 
After upset wins by California and Washington
over I'SC and UCLA respectively Saturday, it re
.illv looks as if the Pat itic Eight football season
will be more this year than a simple formality
resulting in a Rose Bowl bid for USC.
The Pac-8 race is so wide-open after last
weekend that even Washington's huge fullback.
Robin Earl, said after the Huskies' victory over
UCLA. "You bit I can smell roses."
Stanford. Cal, USC. UCLA and Washington are
all virtually tied for first place with one Pac-8 loss
each. Cal is technically tlit? leader, having played,
and won. one more Pac-8 game than the others. If
two teams tit; for the league lead, the winner of the
regular-season game between those two teams
would go to the Rose Bowl. If that game ended in a
tit;, the team with the best overall record would
go-
Stanford (3-1) would finish tirst in the Pacific
Eight if the Cards win their three remaining games
(USC, Oregon and (la I) and if I ISC] or anyone else
beats or ties UCLA. Whether Stanford can beat
both USC and Cal is debatable. Stanford could
conceivably lose to the Trojans Saturday and still
go to the Rose Bowl, but that would require no
fewer than five upsets throughout the Pac-8, in
cludingUCLA losses to Oregon and Oregon State.
Calchances good
Cal (4-1) has only Washington and Stanford
remaining tin its Pac-8 schedule. The Bears would

win tlu* Pac-8 with vic tories over those two teams
and with help probably from USC against UCLA,
both of which seem reasonable.
USC (3-1) will go to the Rose Howl if the Tro
jans win the rest of their games (Stanford.
Washington and UCLA) and if either Washington
or Stanford beats Cal.
UCLA (3-1) has a comparatively easy schedule
remaining — Oregon. Oregon State and USC. The
Bruins would play in the Rose Howl for the tirst
time since 1966 if thev win those games and if
somebody, probably Cal or USC'. disposes of
Washington. UCLA's only real obstacle then is
defeating USC.
Dogs to L.A.?
Washington (3-1) would make the trip south to
Pasadena with wins over its three opponents
Cal. USC and Washington State while some
body knocks off Stanford. Despite Karl's en
thusiasm. Washington will need a lot of luck,
much more ability than the Huskies have shown
to date and probably divine intervention to sweep
its last three games.
There's also a possibility that all five teams
could tie for the league lead with f>-2 records. In
such an event, the result would be the same old
story. USC would win the Pac-H because no team
would have swept all the other leaders and the
Trojans possess the season's best non-league re
cord.

go to the Rose Bowl, but that would require no
fewer than five upsets throughout the Pac-8, in
cludingUCLA losses to Oregon and Oregon State.
Calchances good
Cal (4-1) has only Washington and Stanford
remaining tin its Pac-8 schedule. The Bears would

win tlu* Pac-8 with vic tories over those two teams
and with help probably from USC against UCLA,
both of which seem reasonable.
USC (3-1) will go to the Rose Howl if the Tro
jans win the rest of their games (Stanford.
Washington and UCLA) and if either Washington
or Stanford beats Cal.
UCLA (3-1) has a comparatively easy schedule
remaining — Oregon. Oregon State and USC. The
Bruins would play in the Rose Howl for the tirst
time since 1966 if thev win those games and if
somebody, probably Cal or USC'. disposes of
Washington. UCLA's only real obstacle then is
defeating USC.
Dogs to L.A.?
Washington (3-1) would make the trip south to
Pasadena with wins over its three opponents
Cal. USC and Washington State while some
body knocks off Stanford. Despite Karl's en
thusiasm. Washington will need a lot of luck,
much more ability than the Huskies have shown
to date and probably divine intervention to sweep
its last three games.
There's also a possibility that all five teams
could tie for the league lead with f>-2 records. In
such an event, the result would be the same old
story. USC would win the Pac-H because no team
would have swept all the other leaders and the
Trojans possess the season's best non-league re
cord.

After upset wins by California and Washington
over I'SC and UCLA respectively Saturday, it re
.illv looks as if the Pat itic Eight football season
will be more this year than a simple formality
resulting in a Rose Bowl bid for USC.
The Pac-8 race is so wide-open after last
weekend that even Washington's huge fullback.
Robin Earl, said after the Huskies' victory over
UCLA. "You bit I can smell roses."
Stanford. Cal, USC. UCLA and Washington are
all virtually tied for first place with one Pac-8 loss
each. Cal is technically tlit? leader, having played,
and won. one more Pac-8 game than the others. If
two teams tit; for the league lead, the winner of the
regular-season game between those two teams
would go to the Rose Bowl. If that game ended in a
tit;, the team with the best overall record would
go-
Stanford (3-1) would finish tirst in the Pacific
Eight if the Cards win their three remaining games
(USC, Oregon and (la I) and if I ISC] or anyone else
beats or ties UCLA. Whether Stanford can beat
both USC and Cal is debatable. Stanford could
conceivably lose to the Trojans Saturday and still
go to the Rose Bowl, but that would require no
fewer than five upsets throughout the Pac-8, in
