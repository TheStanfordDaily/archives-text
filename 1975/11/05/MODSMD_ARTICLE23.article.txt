Judge Thomas Macßride.
"I am firing Mr. John Virga as co-counsel."
Fromme said in a one-sentence statement to the

court after a lengthy conversation at the judge's
bench with Macßride and attorneys in the case.
"1 thinkshe'sfoolish." MacHridesaid, "but if she
wants to do this, she's within her rights."

Virga for advice. Macßride said Virga could not act
as an attorney in the case unless Fromme were
evicted from the courtroom.

hope the panel is not respnsible for word leaking
out that Kissinger had the Central Intelligence
Agency supply arms to Kurdish rebels in Iraq.

Virga for advice. Macßride said Virga could not act
as an attorney in the case unless Fromme were
evicted from the courtroom.

give his country a nuclear-powered plant tor de
salinating water, a spokesman for the Arab leader
said yesterday.

Egyptian press.

be part of the $750 million aid package President

surprise request to change her plea when she said
only the Charles Manson clan could judge her.

court after a lengthy conversation at the judge's
bench with Macßride and attorneys in the case.

wants to do this, she's within her rights."
The judge said Fromme would have complete

Virga for advice. Macßride said Virga could not act
as an attorney in the case unless Fromme were
evicted from the courtroom.
