### WILLIAM ROSS 
Budget-cutting efforts this year have
enabled the University to pare its pro
jected $1.(5 million deficit 1975-76 to
$1.2 million. Provost William Miller
said last night on KZSU's Campus
Confnivnrc.
Miller said reductions in special
programs cuts in faculty and adminis
trative pay and the withholding of un
allocated funds by departments ena
bled the University to reduce its de
ficit.
He noted that similar cuts will be
necessary to minimize next year's de
ficit.
"We will takeall measures we can to
reduce the deficit because deficits
must be financed by money from the
endowment fund." Miller said.
The University's financial problems
have hit its building plans particularly
hard. Miller said.
Campaign for Stanford
He explained that while the
University's five-year. $300 million
Campaign for Stanford is ahead of
schedule for current expenses and is
on schedule for endowment, it has fal
len behind on building allocations.
Miller said the worst result is the
University's inability to start building
a proposed $20 million library.
He called the library "one of the
most crucial items in the campaign."
The University must continue to
raise tuition at a rate that outpaces in
flation to meet financial obligations,
the provost indicated.
"Our tuition is already below that of
a number of our competitors," Miller
said. "If we got ahead of them, then we
would haveto moderate our position."
Miller noted that next year's pro
jected tuition rate of $4303, proposed
to the Board of Trustees, "is only a
starting point." He said the final figure

might be slightly lower.
Miller said the administration has
reacted rather negatively" to informal
suggestions that it consider adopting a
contract tuition system, whereby stu
dents would pay a fixed amount for
four years.
He contended that the disparate
charges for different class levels might
be unfair to students.
"If I were a student. I don't think I'd
want a contract system." Miller said. "I
think students are better able to keep
the pressure on the administration for
lower tuition when they pay year by
year."
In other remarks. Miller contended
that "there is a very strong case for


William Miller
selecting a new dean of undergraduate
studies from within the University."
Present Dean James Gibbs has an
nounced he will leave the administra
tion next June.
Objections
Miller said the department in which
the new dean might teach after serving
in the administration could object to
hiring an outsider for the post. Miller
said departments would be wary of
someone isolated from the department
for several years only to be "suddenly
plunked into the department" without
previous experience there after serv
ing as dean.
He added that there are benefits to
hiring a dean who would be familiar
with the problems of the school and
has watched the office develop under
Cibbs.
The provost, whose new temporary
official residence at the Honeycomb
House has been challenged, volun
teered the information that he is rent
ing his personal residence, as well as
paying off the mortgage and taxes on
it.
Miller said this rental was in line
with University policy, which allows
officials of overseas campuses, among
others, to rent their houses while liv
ing in residences paid for by the Uni
versity.
