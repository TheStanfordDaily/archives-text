# Bonfire loss would upset IFC

### JACK VAUGHN 
Finding an alternative to the Big
Game Bonfire "would really screw us
up," Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
President Bob Ottilie said yesterday as
an opponent of the fire indicated the
event might yet be killed.
"We're really upset" that the request
from the Bay Area Pollution Control
District and the ASS LI Council of Pres
idents (COP) to find another type of
rally for the Nov. 22 game against
California "has come up so late," Ot
tilie said.
Although Bonfire planners "would
consider an alternative for next year,"
Ottilie claimed that preparations for
this year's event "will be completed by
next Monday except for building the
fire and erecting the stage." He said it
is now "too late for an alternative."
At the request of ASSIJ President
and Bonfire opponent Lee Rosenbaum,
the ASSU Senate Monday postponed
until Nov. 10 a decision on supporting
the Bonfire. Dean of Student Affairs
lames Lyons, in a letter to the COP. had
asked that Senate members "take the
time to consult with their con
stituents," before making a recom
mendation on the Bonfire.

Lyons said he set a Nov. 11 deadline
for the Senate response to the Bonfire
issue because supporters and oppo
nents of the celebration "weren't
speaking or listening to each other."
and the Senate needed an opportunity
to "get back to their constituents" on

the matter.
The Senate hadn't had the opportun
ity to study the question" before he
wrote to the COP. Lyons said.
Rosenbaum, who said he asked the
Senate to postpone its decision be
cause of Lyons' letter, agreed that "it's
going to be harder" organize an alter
native because of the week's delay on
the matter.
"But it's more important that the Se
nate be a representative body and not
make the decision "based on the pre
judices of some senators." he said.
Rosenbaum said he doesn't think Ot
tilie is "going to get very far with his
argument" that preparations for the
bonfire are too far advanced to call the
event off.
"They (Bonfire officials) have been
getting notice all along" that there is
opposition to the event. Rosenbaum
said.
Otti lie said the Bonfire's purpose has
been to "bring together the student
body, the faculty, staff and most im
portant perhaps the alumni." Alterna
tive celebrations, such as a dance at
Tresidder Union, would not "put to
gether as many people" as the Bonf ire,
said Otti lie.

California "has come up so late," Ot
tilie said.
Although Bonfire planners "would
consider an alternative for next year,"
Ottilie claimed that preparations for
this year's event "will be completed by
next Monday except for building the
fire and erecting the stage." He said it
is now "too late for an alternative."
At the request of ASSIJ President
and Bonfire opponent Lee Rosenbaum,
the ASSU Senate Monday postponed
until Nov. 10 a decision on supporting
the Bonfire. Dean of Student Affairs
lames Lyons, in a letter to the COP. had
asked that Senate members "take the
time to consult with their con
stituents," before making a recom
mendation on the Bonfire.

Lyons said he set a Nov. 11 deadline
for the Senate response to the Bonfire
issue because supporters and oppo
nents of the celebration "weren't
speaking or listening to each other."
and the Senate needed an opportunity
to "get back to their constituents" on

the matter.
The Senate hadn't had the opportun
ity to study the question" before he
wrote to the COP. Lyons said.
Rosenbaum, who said he asked the
Senate to postpone its decision be
cause of Lyons' letter, agreed that "it's
going to be harder" organize an alter
native because of the week's delay on
the matter.
"But it's more important that the Se
nate be a representative body and not
make the decision "based on the pre
judices of some senators." he said.
Rosenbaum said he doesn't think Ot
tilie is "going to get very far with his
argument" that preparations for the
bonfire are too far advanced to call the
event off.
"They (Bonfire officials) have been
getting notice all along" that there is
opposition to the event. Rosenbaum
said.
Otti lie said the Bonfire's purpose has
been to "bring together the student
body, the faculty, staff and most im
portant perhaps the alumni." Alterna
tive celebrations, such as a dance at
Tresidder Union, would not "put to
gether as many people" as the Bonf ire,
said Otti lie.

Finding an alternative to the Big
Game Bonfire "would really screw us
up," Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
President Bob Ottilie said yesterday as
an opponent of the fire indicated the
event might yet be killed.
"We're really upset" that the request
from the Bay Area Pollution Control
District and the ASS LI Council of Pres
idents (COP) to find another type of
rally for the Nov. 22 game against
California "has come up so late," Ot
