The openness of campus activity compounds
the difficulties of crime prevention here, accord
ing to Stanford Director of Police Services Mar
vin Herring ton.
Statistics in a report compiled by Police Ser
vices statistician lack Donals show a slight rise
in on-campus crime over the last year. Herring
ton said.
But. he added, the "bulk of crimes (at Stan
ford) are committed by off-campus people."
Locating the "hot beds" of crime on the sprawl
ing campus is "next to impossible." Herrington
said.
Close scrutiny of individuals who enter the
campus would be desirable, he said. But he
claimed it is impossible because of the expanse
of the campus, its multiple access ways, the loca
tion of the shopping center on University land
and the proximity of Highway 280.
Coed dorms
Herrington cited the advent of coed dorms as
another significant factor in increasing crime
here in recent years. The number of personal
theft began increasing at the time of the dorm
desegregation, he remarked.
"I'm not advocating going back to men's and
women's dorms, but the dormitories that are in
existence were built like barracks, with the idea
in mind that the dorm area would be closed off
by virtue uf sex. Now these buildings are being
used in a totally different manner." he said.

Police Services has found less theft, said Her
rington. in the Mirrielees apartments because
occupants are more conscientious about locking
doors. They are conscious of living in an apart
ment building, while dorm residents tend to
think of their rooms as buried safely in a build
ing.
"One of the things we try to get across to
(students) is to treat that hallway like it's a street
out front, because, for all intents and purposes,
the dormitories and hallways are free game.
Anyone can walk in there. And with mixed
sexes, nobody asks any questions;' nobody
knows." Herrington explained.
Anonymity
Another problem associated with Stanford,
according to Herrington. is simply that it's an
"anonvmous sort of place." Almost anyone, he
surmised, given the proper vehicle, garb and
rapport could steal a truckload of goods from
Stanford and no one would ask questions.
Crime rates so far this year don't provide a
very accurate picture of projected crime for
1975-76. Herrington said. But in general, crimes
against people are being controlled, he stated.
Herrington cited the four 1973 and 1974 campus
murders as exceptions.
He said he expected the rate of crimes against
property to increase in the future because the
slumping economy denies jobs to people who
would otherwise be employed and not inclined
to theft and burglary.
Examining drug usage. Herrington said mari

juana has "dropped off since its high poi nt in the
late 605." He said a combination of on- and off
campus individuals pushes drugs on campus.
'Very difficult'
"I'm sure we have students engaging in sel
ling marijuana but it's very difficult for us to run
down a person who sells a few joints now and
then. Somebody has tobeselling in real quantity
before we'll pick them up," he said.
Stanford has not always been plagued with
rising crime rates. Herrington said the
University's earlier, crime curve began to climb
in 1965 or 1966, rising faster each year. The rate
of crime increase reached its peak between 1968
and 1970, flattened out around 1971 and has
remained fairly steady since.
Crime rates at other universities have also fol
lowed this pattern, he said.
Herrington noted that he has only four people
on duty "on thereally heavyshifts"fora popula
tion of 30.000 and he stresed the dependence ol
Police Serices on Stanford students, faculty and
staff in reducing crime on campus.
Herrington said. "Stanford students are just
like everyone else" in terms of their conscienti
ousness in reporting crime. Although no studies
have been made on the matter, he estimated that
the rate of unreported crime at the University is
the same as in other parts of the country.
Herrington said he accepted the general accu
racy of the Donals report because the campus
population remained constant over the report
period, autumn 1973 to spring 1975.

(students) is to treat that hallway like it's a street
out front, because, for all intents and purposes,
the dormitories and hallways are free game.
Anyone can walk in there. And with mixed
sexes, nobody asks any questions;' nobody
knows." Herrington explained.
Anonymity
Another problem associated with Stanford,
according to Herrington. is simply that it's an
"anonvmous sort of place." Almost anyone, he
surmised, given the proper vehicle, garb and
rapport could steal a truckload of goods from
Stanford and no one would ask questions.
Crime rates so far this year don't provide a
very accurate picture of projected crime for
1975-76. Herrington said. But in general, crimes
against people are being controlled, he stated.
Herrington cited the four 1973 and 1974 campus
murders as exceptions.
He said he expected the rate of crimes against
property to increase in the future because the
slumping economy denies jobs to people who
would otherwise be employed and not inclined
to theft and burglary.
Examining drug usage. Herrington said mari

juana has "dropped off since its high poi nt in the
late 605." He said a combination of on- and off
campus individuals pushes drugs on campus.
'Very difficult'
"I'm sure we have students engaging in sel
ling marijuana but it's very difficult for us to run
down a person who sells a few joints now and
then. Somebody has tobeselling in real quantity
before we'll pick them up," he said.
Stanford has not always been plagued with
rising crime rates. Herrington said the
University's earlier, crime curve began to climb
in 1965 or 1966, rising faster each year. The rate
of crime increase reached its peak between 1968
and 1970, flattened out around 1971 and has
remained fairly steady since.
Crime rates at other universities have also fol
lowed this pattern, he said.
Herrington noted that he has only four people
on duty "on thereally heavyshifts"fora popula
tion of 30.000 and he stresed the dependence ol
Police Serices on Stanford students, faculty and
staff in reducing crime on campus.
Herrington said. "Stanford students are just
like everyone else" in terms of their conscienti
ousness in reporting crime. Although no studies
have been made on the matter, he estimated that
the rate of unreported crime at the University is
the same as in other parts of the country.
Herrington said he accepted the general accu
racy of the Donals report because the campus
population remained constant over the report
period, autumn 1973 to spring 1975.
Last of two ports
The openness of campus activity compounds
the difficulties of crime prevention here, accord
ing to Stanford Director of Police Services Mar
vin Herring ton.
Statistics in a report compiled by Police Ser
vices statistician lack Donals show a slight rise
in on-campus crime over the last year. Herring
ton said.
But. he added, the "bulk of crimes (at Stan
ford) are committed by off-campus people."
Locating the "hot beds" of crime on the sprawl
ing campus is "next to impossible." Herrington
said.
Close scrutiny of individuals who enter the
campus would be desirable, he said. But he
claimed it is impossible because of the expanse
of the campus, its multiple access ways, the loca
tion of the shopping center on University land
and the proximity of Highway 280.
Coed dorms
Herrington cited the advent of coed dorms as
another significant factor in increasing crime
here in recent years. The number of personal
theft began increasing at the time of the dorm
desegregation, he remarked.
"I'm not advocating going back to men's and
women's dorms, but the dormitories that are in
existence were built like barracks, with the idea
in mind that the dorm area would be closed off
by virtue uf sex. Now these buildings are being
used in a totally different manner." he said.

Police Services has found less theft, said Her
rington. in the Mirrielees apartments because
occupants are more conscientious about locking
doors. They are conscious of living in an apart
ment building, while dorm residents tend to
think of their rooms as buried safely in a build
ing.
"One of the things we try to get across to
(students) is to treat that hallway like it's a street

in 1965 or 1966, rising faster each year. The rate
of crime increase reached its peak between 1968
and 1970, flattened out around 1971 and has
remained fairly steady since.
Crime rates at other universities have also fol
lowed this pattern, he said.
Herrington noted that he has only four people
on duty "on thereally heavyshifts"fora popula
tion of 30.000 and he stresed the dependence ol
Police Serices on Stanford students, faculty and
staff in reducing crime on campus.
Herrington said. "Stanford students are just
like everyone else" in terms of their conscienti
ousness in reporting crime. Although no studies
have been made on the matter, he estimated that
the rate of unreported crime at the University is
the same as in other parts of the country.
Herrington said he accepted the general accu
racy of the Donals report because the campus
population remained constant over the report
period, autumn 1973 to spring 1975.
