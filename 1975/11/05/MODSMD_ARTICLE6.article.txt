### VLAE KERSHNER 
San Francisco voters, flaunting their
much prized individuality, yesterday
slapped the City's labor unions in the
face while catapulting labor's mayoral
candidate. Ceorge Moscone. into the
favorites spot.
Mocsone polled a surprisingly large
66,135 votes (31 percent) in the

two younger, more liberal candidates.
Labor lawyer Joseph Freitas Jr. won
election with 59,511 votes to 50,965
for civil rights activist Carol Silverand
only 49.649 for Ferdon.
Hut while liberal candidates fared
well, the voters also resoundingly
reacted against the August police and
firefighters strike by passing an al
phabet soup of anti-labor propositions.
Strikers will be fired
From now on. striking police or
