# Moscone bucks SF anti-labor trend
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
San Francisco voters, flaunting their
much prized individuality, yesterday
slapped the City's labor unions in the
face while catapulting labor's mayoral
candidate. Ceorge Moscone. into the
favorites spot.
Mocsone polled a surprisingly large
66,135 votes (31 percent) in the
11-person contest to succeed Mayor
Joseph Alioto. John Barbagelata. a con
servative supervisor, shocked most
observers by narrowly edging Dianne
Feinstein, president of the Board of
Supervisors, for the other position in a
Dec. 11 runoff.
Both Moscone, who got the liberal
vote, and Barbagelata. who capitalized
on dissatisfaction among the City's
taxpayers, took votes away from the

middle-of-the-road Feinstein. a former
ASSU President backed in this race by
both major San Francisco newspapers.
With 99 percent of the votes
counted. Harbagelata had 40,533 to
Feinstein's 39,331. Superior Judge
John Ertola and Republican State Sen.
Milton Marks, both moderates,
finished fourth and fifth with just over
30.000 votes each.
Sheriff's race
In the race for Sheriff, incumbent
Richard Hongisto. enjoying active
support from the (City's gay commun
ity. destroyed his most serious chal
lenger. Police Inspector Michael
Nevin. 95.945 to 30.800.
In the District Attorney's race,
10-year incumbent John Jay Ferdon
could do no better than third against
two younger, more liberal candidates.
Labor lawyer Joseph Freitas Jr. won
election with 59,511 votes to 50,965
for civil rights activist Carol Silverand
only 49.649 for Ferdon.
Hut while liberal candidates fared
well, the voters also resoundingly
reacted against the August police and
firefighters strike by passing an al
phabet soup of anti-labor propositions.
Strikers will be fired
From now on. striking police or
firefighters will be immediately fired.
In addition, city pay formulae have
been changed against the wishes of un-
ions and the mayor's emergency
power to offer contracts to public emp
loyes have been curtailed. Alternative
bills backed by labor lost by large mar
gins.
All six incumbent supervisors were
returned to office, as expected. The
supervisors won the applause of most
voters by taking a tough line against
strikers in August.
The Moscone-Harbagelata runoff
shapes up as an interesting one. as all
three major losers in the mayoral race
are considered ideologically between
the two candidates, and it's not known
how their votes will go.
Moscone's 24,000 vote lead, and the
immense vote civil libertarians got out
for Hongisto, puts him in the favorite's
role. Moscone is best known as spon
sor of legislation decriminalizing
marijuana.
Hut Harbagelata predicted victory,
saying that yesterday,"the votes on
the conservative side were split among
four people. When it comes one-on
one. I think I will prevail."

Joseph Alioto. John Barbagelata. a con
servative supervisor, shocked most
observers by narrowly edging Dianne
Feinstein, president of the Board of
Supervisors, for the other position in a
Dec. 11 runoff.
Both Moscone, who got the liberal
vote, and Barbagelata. who capitalized
on dissatisfaction among the City's
taxpayers, took votes away from the

middle-of-the-road Feinstein. a former
ASSU President backed in this race by
both major San Francisco newspapers.
With 99 percent of the votes
counted. Harbagelata had 40,533 to
Feinstein's 39,331. Superior Judge
John Ertola and Republican State Sen.
Milton Marks, both moderates,
finished fourth and fifth with just over
30.000 votes each.
Sheriff's race
In the race for Sheriff, incumbent
Richard Hongisto. enjoying active
support from the (City's gay commun
ity. destroyed his most serious chal
lenger. Police Inspector Michael
Nevin. 95.945 to 30.800.
In the District Attorney's race,
10-year incumbent John Jay Ferdon
could do no better than third against
two younger, more liberal candidates.
Labor lawyer Joseph Freitas Jr. won
election with 59,511 votes to 50,965
for civil rights activist Carol Silverand
only 49.649 for Ferdon.
Hut while liberal candidates fared
well, the voters also resoundingly
reacted against the August police and
firefighters strike by passing an al
phabet soup of anti-labor propositions.
Strikers will be fired
From now on. striking police or
firefighters will be immediately fired.
In addition, city pay formulae have
been changed against the wishes of un-
ions and the mayor's emergency
power to offer contracts to public emp
loyes have been curtailed. Alternative
bills backed by labor lost by large mar
gins.
All six incumbent supervisors were
returned to office, as expected. The
supervisors won the applause of most
voters by taking a tough line against
strikers in August.
The Moscone-Harbagelata runoff
shapes up as an interesting one. as all
three major losers in the mayoral race
are considered ideologically between
the two candidates, and it's not known
how their votes will go.
Moscone's 24,000 vote lead, and the
immense vote civil libertarians got out
for Hongisto, puts him in the favorite's
role. Moscone is best known as spon
sor of legislation decriminalizing
marijuana.
Hut Harbagelata predicted victory,
saying that yesterday,"the votes on
the conservative side were split among
four people. When it comes one-on
one. I think I will prevail."
San Francisco voters, flaunting their
much prized individuality, yesterday
slapped the City's labor unions in the
face while catapulting labor's mayoral
candidate. Ceorge Moscone. into the
favorites spot.

66,135 votes (31 percent) in the
11-person contest to succeed Mayor
