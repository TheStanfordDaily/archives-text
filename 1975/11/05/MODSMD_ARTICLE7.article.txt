"The new building will definitely
have a positive effect on the quality of
education at the Law School." accord
ing to Gary Bayer, assistant Law
School dean.
"People make great law schools hut
a poor facility, such as the one we had,
can become a constraint." he said.
"Our new facility will improve the de
sirability of working and studying
here."
Last year the Law School was ranked
sixth in a national poll released by
Chunge, a magazine of higher learn
ing. Many law professors, adminis
trators and students here believed
Stanford was underrated.
The magazine stated that an "inade
quate library hurts a school's reputa
tion." while "a large library is indica
tive of a strong academic climate in
which professional schools flourish."
Both students and faculty cited the
new library as a prime advantage in the
new building. "The old library didn't
pass American Bar Association re
quirements for tho seating of stu
dents," said Bayer. "We had to keep
one-third of our books in storage and
there was not any room to expand as
there is now."
'Easier to work in'
"The new library is much easier to
work in." said Nick Spaeth, a second
yearstudent. "Thereare plenty of seats
now. whereas in the old library seats
were sometimes hard to find."
"We had all the other elements of a
superior law school except an ade
quate building." said Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal.
"If you have the people, that's the
most important thing. However, if
there are not enough classrooms,
scheduling becomes so intense that
you cannot take advantage of all op
portunities to enhance education."
Friedenthal said the law school be
came a great bargain because it was
built before construction costs soared.
Desirability increased
As far as the prestige of the Law
School is concerned, both Friedenthal
and Baveragreedthat the new building
will increase the desirability ot the
school for both students and faculty.
"You can't help but be impressed by
the new building." said Alvin katz. a
second year student. "Such things as
the size of the new library and the

added classrooms will enhance the al
ready excellent reputation of the
school."
"Everyone's attitude is better in the
new surroundings." he said. "In tin 1
old building you couldn't find rooms
for student organizations and speak
ers. Now there are rooms for practi
cally every need."
"Overall, everyone is happy in the
new facility." added Bayer. "It is ,i
huge plus for the Law School. The
working environment is much better
and it certainly can't hurt the prestige
of the Law School."

for student organizations and speak
ers. Now there are rooms for practi
cally every need."
"Overall, everyone is happy in the
new facility." added Bayer. "It is ,i
huge plus for the Law School. The
working environment is much better
and it certainly can't hurt the prestige
of the Law School."
"The new building will definitely
have a positive effect on the quality of
education at the Law School." accord
ing to Gary Bayer, assistant Law
School dean.
"People make great law schools hut
a poor facility, such as the one we had,
can become a constraint." he said.
"Our new facility will improve the de
sirability of working and studying
here."
Last year the Law School was ranked
sixth in a national poll released by
Chunge, a magazine of higher learn
ing. Many law professors, adminis
trators and students here believed
Stanford was underrated.
The magazine stated that an "inade
quate library hurts a school's reputa
tion." while "a large library is indica
tive of a strong academic climate in
which professional schools flourish."
Both students and faculty cited the
new library as a prime advantage in the
new building. "The old library didn't
pass American Bar Association re
quirements for tho seating of stu
dents," said Bayer. "We had to keep
one-third of our books in storage and
there was not any room to expand as
there is now."
'Easier to work in'
"The new library is much easier to
work in." said Nick Spaeth, a second
yearstudent. "Thereare plenty of seats
now. whereas in the old library seats
were sometimes hard to find."
"We had all the other elements of a
superior law school except an ade
quate building." said Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal.
"If you have the people, that's the
most important thing. However, if
there are not enough classrooms,
scheduling becomes so intense that
you cannot take advantage of all op
portunities to enhance education."
Friedenthal said the law school be
came a great bargain because it was
built before construction costs soared.
Desirability increased
As far as the prestige of the Law
School is concerned, both Friedenthal
and Baveragreedthat the new building
will increase the desirability ot the
school for both students and faculty.
"You can't help but be impressed by
the new building." said Alvin katz. a
second year student. "Such things as
the size of the new library and the

added classrooms will enhance the al
ready excellent reputation of the
school."
"Everyone's attitude is better in the
new surroundings." he said. "In tin 1
old building you couldn't find rooms
for student organizations and speak
ers. Now there are rooms for practi
cally every need."
