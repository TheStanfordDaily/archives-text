We support the Stanford Gay People's Union (GPU)
recent proposal to add discrimination on the basis ot
"affectional or sexual preference" to the list of prohi
bited discriminatory practices at the Career Planning
and Placement Center (CPPC).
The proposal, supported last week by the ASSIJ Se
nate, is now under consideration by the Committee on
Student Services (COSJv).
Along with the CPPC's present policy excluding
employers who discriminate on the basis of race,
creed, national origin or sex, the proposal would give
voice to the University's commitment to quality and
freedom of expression within the Stanford commun
ity.
Further, a policy against anti-homosexual discrimi
nation would, as ASSIJ Vice-President Dave (jalligan
has said, serve as a "pressure tactic" to persuade dis
criminating employers to abandon their unfair prac
tices.
In order to identify those organizations which are
discriminating against homosexuals, we believe rep
resentatives of employers using the CPPC should be
required to sign a written statement affirming that their
companies or agencies do not discriminate.
This is necessary because, unlike other prohibited
categories for discrimination, sexual preference is not
recognized by state or federal law. Therefore dis
criminating employers are not required to publicly
announce their policies.
One of the effects of this proposal will be to end
military recruitment on campus.
We do not oppose the armed forces' presence on
campus per se. however. We merely oppose their pol
icy. displayed in recent courts-martial of career milit
ary men who happened to be homosexuals, ot denying
certain citizens the right to be employed because of
their sexual preference.
There are those who will argue that companies
should have the right to pick whomever they wish for
their staffs. Even if this is true, however, the University
does not have an obligation to grant such employers a
forum on campus.
This proposal is not a panacea. It will not. of itself,
remove the countless obstacles gay people face. But it
will assurethe gay community that it does not confront
these obstacles by itself.
