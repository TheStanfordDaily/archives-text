### 
Love and Death
Directed by Woody Allen
Allen, a frustrated seeker of truth, gets lost
among philosophical cobwebs of Tolstoy
and Dostoevsky with Diane Keaton, who is
merely frustrated. Less frenzied than his
earlier films, this is Woody Allen s most ma
ture piece of filmmaking. He even gets the
girl.****
Three Days Of The Condor
Directed by Sydney Pollack
Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway star in
this extremely timely CIA thriller, about an
employe who finds himself hunted by both
the public CIA and an internal organization
that has already slain his co-workers. While
it is not the most original spy thriller ever
produced, Redford as the man with no con
trol over his destiny (rather than as the
macho superman always in power) makes
this an interesting venture.*"
Let's Do It Again
Directed by Sidney Poitier
A "sequel ' bearing little resemblance to
Uptown Saturday Night, though both star
Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier. Trying to
raise money for their lodge, Cosby and
Poitier hypnotize a pipsqueak boxer (Jimmy
Walker) to make him a winner. Though
weak and hackneyed in spots, overall it is
funny and enjoyable.***
Nashville
Directed by Robert Altman
This tour de force covers several days in the
lives of about 20 characters caught up in the
Nashville scene We don't think it's the
American epic it is purported to be, but the
capsule performances of Henry Gibson, Lily
Tomlin and Roni Blakely are outstanding."*

Mahogany
Directed by Berry Gordy
The woman's picture of the '40s moder
nized, with Diana Ross terrific as the sec
retary who accidentally becomes a model
under the control of a psychotic Tony Per
kins. Also struggling through a stormy affair
with politician Billy Dee Williams, Ross ful
fills the talent evident in Lady Sings The
Blues. ***
Monty Python and the Holy
Grail
The six-man British comedy team spoofs a
King Arthur legend. If you aren't already
familiar with their humor, it may take you a
while to get used to it."
Lisztomania
Directed by Ken Russell
In the tradition of Russell's other films, an
over-done, over-rated conglomeration of
Russell's own ridiculous fantasies as sup
posedly happening to the 17th-century
composer Liszt and his companion Richard
Wagner, theoretically the first two pop
superstars of the world. Russell's obsession
with music has never been more
undesirable.*

Smile
Directed by Michael Ritchie
One of the three greatest films to be re
leased this year — also the quietest. Now in
a second-run, it is not to be missed. It is
social satire like Shampoo and Nashville,
but is far superior in its picture of contem
porary America as seen around a Young
American Miss Beauty Pageant. Bruce
Dern and Barbara Feldon star ****
Rollerball
Directed by Norman Jewison
A chilling look into the not-so-distant future
when corporations have taken over the
world and the masses are subdued by the
ultraviolent rollerball game, a conglomera
tion of roulette, motorcycling, roller derby
and hockey. James Caan plays the im
mensely popular Jonathan E. who becomes
powerful enough to challenge the reign of
the corporations.****
Jaws
Directed by Steven Spielberg
The most successful movie of all time
should not be dismissed as pure horror.
Beyond the excruciating suspense and gore
it is perhaps the best film to come out of
1975. The characterizations of Roy
Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw
and Lorraine Gary are excellent. In addition,
the cinematic effects of director Spielberg
are more stunning than any other film's in a
long time.****

French Connection II
Directed by John Frankenheimer
Trying to measure up to the quality of the
original is an impossible task, but Frank
enheimer has at least come close Gene
Hackman once again turns in a stellar per
formance as the dogged Popeye Doyle,
now traveling to Marseilles to capture Frog
One, his nemesis, who instead captures
him and makes him a heroin addict. The first
half of the film is excruciatingly slow, as
Popeye battles the French police and is
forced to quit heroin cold turkey. The sec
ond half of the picture switches into high
gear and never lets up until the final
second.***
Rooster Cogburn
Directed by Stuart Millar
A tired re-hashing of the old African Queen
plot, with Katie Hepburn playing almost ex
actly the same role as she did with Bogart.
She and John Wayne attempt to find the
criminals who killed her father and stole
some nitroglycerine, but it comes off as bor
ing and contrived. The sequel to True Grit. *
Hard Times
Directed by Walter Hill
Still another in a seemingly endless string of
Charles Bronson macho movies, this time
Mr. Personality playing a New Orleans
boxer. James Coburn adds a little support
as a gambler. Altogether a tedious and use
less movie.*

A Boy and His Dog
Directed by L.Q. Jones
A far-out science fiction story of a master
pet relationship after nuclear holocaust that
is not always confined to the human being
superior. Blood, the dog, communicates
with his master, Vic (Don Johnson) through
telepathy and has a highly developed sense
of smell. While this situation makes for
some funny and poignant moments, the
movie as a whole leaves a lot of questions
about how the world evolved to that state
unanswered. Not for discerning sci-fi
buffs."
Singin' In The Rain
Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene
Keily
The 1952 MGM musical that supplied the
world with some of the most magical musi
cal moments. A multi-faceted film showing
Hollywood both in the halcyon days of 1927
before and after sound arrived and in 1952
just before the days of TV when no expense
was spared for a lavish production. The
songs, Kelly's dancing and his superb per
formance as a Hollywood lover make the
picture worth seeing — again.""
The Other Side Of The Moun
tain
Directed by Larry Peerce
The story of almost-Olympic skier Jill Kin
mont, who became paralyzed after a 1955
skiing accident, is irreparably damaged by
expressionless acting by Marilyn Hassett as
Kinmont, a soapy and maudlin narration,
and an equally poor script. Beau Bridges is
also lacking in talent as her boyfriend.*
Funny Lady
Directed by Herbert Ross
Barbra Streisand returns as Fanny Brice,
her Oscar-winning role in Funny Girl. It you
don't look too closely at the gaping holes in
the picture, Streisand is beautiful and her
voice is overwhelming. James Caan pro
vides contrast and balance as Brice's sec
ond husband Billy Rose A glossy musical to
end all glossy musicals.""
Journey Into Fear
Directed by Daniel Mann
The most muddled mystery to come out in a
long time Oil company employe Graham
(Sam Waterston) is pursued by unknown
nemesis on a trip from Turkey to New York.
Exploitative violence, poor editing and a
choppy finale waste a fine cast of name
actors, including lan McShane, Shelley
Winters and Stanley Holloway.*
Hearts Of The West
Directed by Howard Zieff
A superb and original story of Gower Gulch
of Hollywood in the 19305, with Jeff Bridges
as young writer who speaks in exceedingly
flowery prose His associations with super
eccentric Hollywood and the pitfalls of suc
cess make for great entertainment. Excel
lent supporting roles by Alan Arkin, Andy
Griffith and Blythe Danner make this a
treat.""
The Fortune
Directed by Mike Nichols
One of the few really likable comedies that
has surfaced recently, edged with black
humor. It's the story of two con men out to
murder the heiress to a sanitary napkin for
tune and their bungled attempts are hilari
ous. Jack Nicholson's performance is one of
his best Warren Beatty reveals a talent for
comedy as the stuffy con man Newcomer
Stockard Channing sparkles as the
heiress ""
The Return of the Pink Panther
Directed by Blake Edwards
Coolly mincing his way through the intrigues
of international crime and the phonetic
hazards of renting a hotel "rum, Peter Sel
lers is at his bumbling best as Inspector
Ctouseau ""

this extremely timely CIA thriller, about an
employe who finds himself hunted by both
the public CIA and an internal organization

it is not the most original spy thriller ever

weak and hackneyed in spots, overall it is
funny and enjoyable.***

Lisztomania

In the tradition of Russell's other films, an
over-done, over-rated conglomeration of
Russell's own ridiculous fantasies as sup
posedly happening to the 17th-century
composer Liszt and his companion Richard
Wagner, theoretically the first two pop
superstars of the world. Russell's obsession
with music has never been more
undesirable.*

Smile
Directed by Michael Ritchie
One of the three greatest films to be re
leased this year — also the quietest. Now in
a second-run, it is not to be missed. It is
social satire like Shampoo and Nashville,

porary America as seen around a Young
American Miss Beauty Pageant. Bruce

Rollerball
Directed by Norman Jewison
A chilling look into the not-so-distant future
when corporations have taken over the
world and the masses are subdued by the
ultraviolent rollerball game, a conglomera
tion of roulette, motorcycling, roller derby
and hockey. James Caan plays the im
mensely popular Jonathan E. who becomes
powerful enough to challenge the reign of
the corporations.****
Jaws
Directed by Steven Spielberg
The most successful movie of all time
should not be dismissed as pure horror.
Beyond the excruciating suspense and gore
it is perhaps the best film to come out of
1975. The characterizations of Roy
Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw
and Lorraine Gary are excellent. In addition,
the cinematic effects of director Spielberg
are more stunning than any other film's in a

Trying to measure up to the quality of the

Hackman once again turns in a stellar per

now traveling to Marseilles to capture Frog
One, his nemesis, who instead captures
him and makes him a heroin addict. The first
half of the film is excruciatingly slow, as
Popeye battles the French police and is
forced to quit heroin cold turkey. The sec

gear and never lets up until the final
second.***
Rooster Cogburn
Directed by Stuart Millar
A tired re-hashing of the old African Queen
plot, with Katie Hepburn playing almost ex

A Boy and His Dog
Directed by L.Q. Jones
A far-out science fiction story of a master
pet relationship after nuclear holocaust that
is not always confined to the human being
superior. Blood, the dog, communicates
with his master, Vic (Don Johnson) through
telepathy and has a highly developed sense

this extremely timely CIA thriller, about an
employe who finds himself hunted by both
the public CIA and an internal organization

it is not the most original spy thriller ever
produced, Redford as the man with no con

In the tradition of Russell's other films, an
over-done, over-rated conglomeration of
Russell's own ridiculous fantasies as sup

composer Liszt and his companion Richard
Wagner, theoretically the first two pop
superstars of the world. Russell's obsession

Smile
Directed by Michael Ritchie
One of the three greatest films to be re
leased this year — also the quietest. Now in

social satire like Shampoo and Nashville,

porary America as seen around a Young
American Miss Beauty Pageant. Bruce

Rollerball
Directed by Norman Jewison
A chilling look into the not-so-distant future
when corporations have taken over the
world and the masses are subdued by the
ultraviolent rollerball game, a conglomera
tion of roulette, motorcycling, roller derby
and hockey. James Caan plays the im
mensely popular Jonathan E. who becomes
powerful enough to challenge the reign of
the corporations.****
Jaws
Directed by Steven Spielberg
The most successful movie of all time
should not be dismissed as pure horror.
Beyond the excruciating suspense and gore
it is perhaps the best film to come out of
1975. The characterizations of Roy
Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw
and Lorraine Gary are excellent. In addition,
the cinematic effects of director Spielberg
are more stunning than any other film's in a

Hackman once again turns in a stellar per

now traveling to Marseilles to capture Frog
One, his nemesis, who instead captures
him and makes him a heroin addict. The first

Popeye battles the French police and is
forced to quit heroin cold turkey. The sec

gear and never lets up until the final
second.***
Rooster Cogburn
Directed by Stuart Millar
A tired re-hashing of the old African Queen
plot, with Katie Hepburn playing almost ex

A Boy and His Dog

A far-out science fiction story of a master
pet relationship after nuclear holocaust that
is not always confined to the human being
superior. Blood, the dog, communicates
with his master, Vic (Don Johnson) through

The Fortune
Directed by Mike Nichols
One of the few really likable comedies that
has surfaced recently, edged with black
humor. It's the story of two con men out to
murder the heiress to a sanitary napkin for
tune and their bungled attempts are hilari
ous. Jack Nicholson's performance is one of
his best Warren Beatty reveals a talent for
comedy as the stuffy con man Newcomer

Love and Death
Directed by Woody Allen
Allen, a frustrated seeker of truth, gets lost
among philosophical cobwebs of Tolstoy

merely frustrated. Less frenzied than his
earlier films, this is Woody Allen s most ma
ture piece of filmmaking. He even gets the

Three Days Of The Condor
Directed by Sydney Pollack
Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway star in
this extremely timely CIA thriller, about an
employe who finds himself hunted by both
the public CIA and an internal organization
that has already slain his co-workers. While
it is not the most original spy thriller ever
produced, Redford as the man with no con
trol over his destiny (rather than as the
macho superman always in power) makes
this an interesting venture.*"
Let's Do It Again
Directed by Sidney Poitier
A "sequel ' bearing little resemblance to
Uptown Saturday Night, though both star
Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier. Trying to
raise money for their lodge, Cosby and
Poitier hypnotize a pipsqueak boxer (Jimmy
Walker) to make him a winner. Though
weak and hackneyed in spots, overall it is
funny and enjoyable.***
Nashville
Directed by Robert Altman
This tour de force covers several days in the
lives of about 20 characters caught up in the
Nashville scene We don't think it's the
American epic it is purported to be, but the
capsule performances of Henry Gibson, Lily
Tomlin and Roni Blakely are outstanding."*

Mahogany
Directed by Berry Gordy
The woman's picture of the '40s moder
nized, with Diana Ross terrific as the sec
retary who accidentally becomes a model
under the control of a psychotic Tony Per
kins. Also struggling through a stormy affair
with politician Billy Dee Williams, Ross ful
fills the talent evident in Lady Sings The
Blues. ***
Monty Python and the Holy
Grail
The six-man British comedy team spoofs a
King Arthur legend. If you aren't already
familiar with their humor, it may take you a
while to get used to it."
Lisztomania
Directed by Ken Russell
In the tradition of Russell's other films, an
over-done, over-rated conglomeration of
Russell's own ridiculous fantasies as sup
posedly happening to the 17th-century
composer Liszt and his companion Richard
Wagner, theoretically the first two pop
superstars of the world. Russell's obsession
with music has never been more
undesirable.*

Smile
Directed by Michael Ritchie
One of the three greatest films to be re
leased this year — also the quietest. Now in
a second-run, it is not to be missed. It is
social satire like Shampoo and Nashville,
but is far superior in its picture of contem
porary America as seen around a Young
American Miss Beauty Pageant. Bruce
Dern and Barbara Feldon star ****
Rollerball
Directed by Norman Jewison
A chilling look into the not-so-distant future
when corporations have taken over the
world and the masses are subdued by the
ultraviolent rollerball game, a conglomera
tion of roulette, motorcycling, roller derby
and hockey. James Caan plays the im
mensely popular Jonathan E. who becomes
powerful enough to challenge the reign of
the corporations.****
Jaws
Directed by Steven Spielberg
The most successful movie of all time
should not be dismissed as pure horror.
Beyond the excruciating suspense and gore
it is perhaps the best film to come out of
1975. The characterizations of Roy
Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw
and Lorraine Gary are excellent. In addition,
the cinematic effects of director Spielberg
are more stunning than any other film's in a
long time.****

French Connection II
Directed by John Frankenheimer
Trying to measure up to the quality of the
original is an impossible task, but Frank
enheimer has at least come close Gene
Hackman once again turns in a stellar per
formance as the dogged Popeye Doyle,
now traveling to Marseilles to capture Frog
One, his nemesis, who instead captures
him and makes him a heroin addict. The first
half of the film is excruciatingly slow, as
Popeye battles the French police and is
forced to quit heroin cold turkey. The sec
ond half of the picture switches into high
gear and never lets up until the final
second.***
Rooster Cogburn
Directed by Stuart Millar
A tired re-hashing of the old African Queen
plot, with Katie Hepburn playing almost ex
actly the same role as she did with Bogart.
She and John Wayne attempt to find the
criminals who killed her father and stole
some nitroglycerine, but it comes off as bor
ing and contrived. The sequel to True Grit. *
Hard Times
Directed by Walter Hill
Still another in a seemingly endless string of
Charles Bronson macho movies, this time
Mr. Personality playing a New Orleans
boxer. James Coburn adds a little support
as a gambler. Altogether a tedious and use
less movie.*

A Boy and His Dog
Directed by L.Q. Jones
A far-out science fiction story of a master
pet relationship after nuclear holocaust that
is not always confined to the human being
superior. Blood, the dog, communicates
with his master, Vic (Don Johnson) through
telepathy and has a highly developed sense
of smell. While this situation makes for
some funny and poignant moments, the
movie as a whole leaves a lot of questions
about how the world evolved to that state
unanswered. Not for discerning sci-fi
buffs."
Singin' In The Rain
Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene
Keily
The 1952 MGM musical that supplied the
world with some of the most magical musi
cal moments. A multi-faceted film showing
Hollywood both in the halcyon days of 1927
before and after sound arrived and in 1952
just before the days of TV when no expense
was spared for a lavish production. The
songs, Kelly's dancing and his superb per
formance as a Hollywood lover make the
picture worth seeing — again.""
The Other Side Of The Moun
tain
Directed by Larry Peerce
The story of almost-Olympic skier Jill Kin
mont, who became paralyzed after a 1955
skiing accident, is irreparably damaged by
expressionless acting by Marilyn Hassett as
Kinmont, a soapy and maudlin narration,
and an equally poor script. Beau Bridges is
also lacking in talent as her boyfriend.*
Funny Lady
Directed by Herbert Ross
Barbra Streisand returns as Fanny Brice,
her Oscar-winning role in Funny Girl. It you
don't look too closely at the gaping holes in
the picture, Streisand is beautiful and her
voice is overwhelming. James Caan pro

end all glossy musicals.""
Journey Into Fear
Directed by Daniel Mann
The most muddled mystery to come out in a
