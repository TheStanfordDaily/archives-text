# P.S. Your Cat is Dead
## Disasters plague Jimmy Zoole, but not the production

Disasters phigue Jimmy Zoole,
who loses his acting job,
girlfriend, novel manuscript —
and cat — in P.S. Your Cut Is
Dead, a provocative comedy by
James Kirkwood, now playing at
the Montgomery Playhouse in
San Francisco.
The play opens in total dark
ness, as Vito, a burglar, "drops
in" (literally, from the skylight)
on Jimmy's apartment for the
third time, exhibiting amazing
familiarity with theapartment as
he deftly maneuvers himself in
search of goods. However, he is
caught by fimmy, who, in his
fury, imprisons Vito by strap
ping him to the kitchen sink in
revenge. Out of this chance
meeting, Kirkwood takes us
through scene after scene of hi
larity, and succeeds in evoking
the pathos through the laughter.
Warren Burton gives an out
standing performance as Jimmy,
beginning with nervy, jerky
movements and a faltering
voice, portraying a jittery, inef
fectual, unsuccessful actor. He
visibly wilts as each new disas
ter strikes.
As the play progresses, how
ever, Jimmy becomes more
lively, enthusiastic, assertive
and confident. Burton also con
vincingly carries off the mo
ments when possible suicide,
sexual cruelty, menacing viol
ence and madness are hinted at.
Well balanced
Director Milton Katselas deli
cately balances the threatening
potentialities of violence and
homosexuality throughout the
play. He relentlessly keeps the
audience in suspense up to the
verv last sentence. This fine

sense of pacing is evident
throughout the play, which does
not have one dull moment.
The authentic-looking set by
Dwight Jackson effectively con
veys the atmosphere of the pri
vate world in which this inter
lude in the lives of the two pro
tagonists takes place.
Spectacular Vito
Jeff Druce as Vito is spectacu
lar in his delivery of the rapid
fire, witty lines. He has a re
markable sense of timing and his
lines are right on target.
He skillfully alternates bet
ween insolence and wile, as he
attempts to seduce Jimmy in
order to escape. The audience is
constantly kept guessing at
whether Vito is genuinely sin
cere, or whether he is saying
something just to trick Jimmy
into setting him free. His lively
facial expressions more than
make up for his immobility
throughout most of the play.
Cast party
At a party celebrating the
100 th performance of F.S. Your
Cat Is Dcud, the cast mingled
with the crowd.

After some champagne and
"birthday" cake, everyone re
laxed and the conversation
flowed.
Burton said he found that he
could readily empathize with
Jimmy's character, since he had
also experienced failures in his
acting career. He said he has
many interests in the arts, but
acting is the main driving force
in his life right now.
S.F. theater weak
Druce admitted that the thea
ter scene in the Bay Area did not
live up to his expectations, and
that he has a higher regard for
drama in Los Angeles.
The original version of P.S.
Your Cat Is Dead played in New
York and received unfavorable
reviews. James Kirkwood has
since made revisions on it, in
cluding a change in the ending.
On this second try, he has suc
ceeded in making this an in
triguing study of two extremely
engaging characters, and the
way in which they react to the
tension of this strange en
counter.
