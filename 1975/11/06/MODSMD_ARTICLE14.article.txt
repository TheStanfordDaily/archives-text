# Movie falls on hard times
## 
### Stephen Brown 
Charlesßronson has returned
once again in a movie practi
cally indistinguishable from his
previous efforts in cinema —
Hard Times.
In the movie Bronson appears
in New Orleans from nowhere in
1933.
As the title suggests, his fi
nancial situation is wholly in
adequate. which prompts the
characteristically free and unat
tached Bronson to journey to the
city to make some money. He
stumbles upon James Coburn,
who turns in a typical Coburn
performance — a moderately
good portrayal of the tough,
fearless cunning man of the
streets and alleys — who prom
otes illegal fights and gains his
livelihood on thebasis of his bet
ting upon the fighters.
The movie is then a rather
tedious, totally predictable
string of fights in which the vic
torious Bronson displays his
familiar coldness and singular
desire to watch out for number
one. The plot is as thin as (ill
Ireland's negligee, the photo
graphy mediocre, the music all
l)iit nonexistent and the charac
ters of only passing interest.
Naturally. Bronson leaves as
ambiguously as he arrived, say
ing, when queried as to where
he will now go, "North." In the
course of the movie we are
asked to believe that the insensi
tive. materialistic Bronson will
suddenly risk everything for
Coburn whom he has little

reason to help.
There are, however, some
uses for this movie, most of
which I feel reasonably certain
the producers did not consider. I
recommend this movie to any
one suffering from acute insom
nia or anxiety. For those of you.
too, who have grown tired of the
kung fu flicks, I feel that you
might find the violent engage
ments in this movie an interest
ing change of pace.

And furthermore, there is a
message for all persons consid
ering a career in medicine:
never mix opium with ether.
Yes, one of the characters is a
"doctor" who failed to progress
beyond his second year of medi
cal school due to his newfound
love for opium.
Certainly, the majority of
those who were impressed by
Bronson's performance in Deofh
Wish are likely to be disap
pointed by this latest movie.

tedious, totally predictable
string of fights in which the vic
torious Bronson displays his
familiar coldness and singular
desire to watch out for number
one. The plot is as thin as (ill
Ireland's negligee, the photo
graphy mediocre, the music all
l)iit nonexistent and the charac
ters of only passing interest.
Naturally. Bronson leaves as
ambiguously as he arrived, say
ing, when queried as to where
he will now go, "North." In the
course of the movie we are
asked to believe that the insensi
tive. materialistic Bronson will
suddenly risk everything for
Coburn whom he has little

reason to help.
There are, however, some
uses for this movie, most of
which I feel reasonably certain
the producers did not consider. I
recommend this movie to any
one suffering from acute insom
nia or anxiety. For those of you.
too, who have grown tired of the
kung fu flicks, I feel that you
might find the violent engage
ments in this movie an interest
ing change of pace.

And furthermore, there is a
message for all persons consid
ering a career in medicine:
never mix opium with ether.
Yes, one of the characters is a
"doctor" who failed to progress
beyond his second year of medi
cal school due to his newfound
love for opium.
Certainly, the majority of
those who were impressed by
Bronson's performance in Deofh
Wish are likely to be disap
pointed by this latest movie.
