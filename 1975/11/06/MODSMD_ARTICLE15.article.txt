# Play sparkles with 'desire'

Desire Under the Elms, the
American Conservatory
Theater's best play so far this
season, will enthrall most peo
ple. It features two brilliant act
ing performances — by Megan
Cole and Ray Reinhardt — in a
generally well-conceived pro
duction.
On the whole, director Alan
Fletcher has adhered faithfully
to playwright Eugene O'Neill's
script and stage directions,
without simplifying or souping
up the difficult, weighty play.
Desire moves slowly, carried
by latent tension and extraordi
nary depth of character rather
than eye-catching theatrics. An
audience which does not attend
closely will quickly grow rest
less.
O'Neill set the play in 1850,
but drew his themes and subject
matter almost directly from
Greek tragedy.
Rock-hard lead
Ephraim Cabot, 75, a proud,
defiant man, still vital and phys
ically awesome, fancies himself
as hard as the stones on his rock
bound New England farm. He
drives himself and his three sons
cruelly, hoarding his money and
working his wives to death.
Cabot's twisted Puritan relig
ion and avaricious love for his
farm provide the only emotional
outlets for his embittered soul.
Restless and lonely, he brings
home a 35-year-old wife, hand
some, sensual Abby Putnam,
who loathes Cabot but covets his
farm.
She schemes to strengthen her
claim to the property by bearing
a child she can foist off as Cabot's
— and so seduces Cabot's
25-year-old son Eben, a vengeful

farmhand, obsessed with
memories of his mother and vir
ulent hatred of his father.
Megan Cole projects the depth
and complexity of Abby palpa
bly, with her carriage, gesture
and expression. The audience
can almost taste and shiver with
her physical sensations, as well
as her fierce lust and crying need
for love. Cole delivers a superla
tive performance in a demand
ing role.
Ray Reinhardt too shows
near-perfect acting, manifesting
the strength and narrowness of
Ephraim Cabot without falling
into caricature.
The third lead, Daniel Kern,
does not do justice to his role. He
lacks Eben's sullen, brooding in
tensity and seems unable to

reach the emotional depth re
quired.
Fletcher falters
Director Fletcher's fidelity to
O'Neill lapses occasionally, in
troducing dissonance each time.
He overplays already obvious
sexuality, with unnecessary
primping by Abby and vague
hints of lechery when Ephraim
paws at her — both lacking in the
script.
People who complain of the
slowness of Desire Under the
Elms may fail to appreciate its
unusual power. Here classic
tragedy develops from the in
herent nature of the characters
and their world, something out
side their knowledge or control,
inexorably separate from envi
ronment and circumstance.

Cole and Ray Reinhardt — in a
generally well-conceived pro
duction.
On the whole, director Alan
Fletcher has adhered faithfully
to playwright Eugene O'Neill's
script and stage directions,
without simplifying or souping
up the difficult, weighty play.
Desire moves slowly, carried
by latent tension and extraordi
nary depth of character rather
than eye-catching theatrics. An
audience which does not attend
closely will quickly grow rest
less.
O'Neill set the play in 1850,
but drew his themes and subject
matter almost directly from
Greek tragedy.
Rock-hard lead
Ephraim Cabot, 75, a proud,
defiant man, still vital and phys
ically awesome, fancies himself
as hard as the stones on his rock
bound New England farm. He
drives himself and his three sons
cruelly, hoarding his money and
working his wives to death.
Cabot's twisted Puritan relig
ion and avaricious love for his
farm provide the only emotional
outlets for his embittered soul.
Restless and lonely, he brings
home a 35-year-old wife, hand
some, sensual Abby Putnam,
who loathes Cabot but covets his
farm.
She schemes to strengthen her
claim to the property by bearing
a child she can foist off as Cabot's
— and so seduces Cabot's
25-year-old son Eben, a vengeful

farmhand, obsessed with
memories of his mother and vir
ulent hatred of his father.
Megan Cole projects the depth
and complexity of Abby palpa
bly, with her carriage, gesture
and expression. The audience
can almost taste and shiver with
her physical sensations, as well
as her fierce lust and crying need
for love. Cole delivers a superla
tive performance in a demand
ing role.
Ray Reinhardt too shows
near-perfect acting, manifesting
the strength and narrowness of
Ephraim Cabot without falling
into caricature.
The third lead, Daniel Kern,
does not do justice to his role. He
lacks Eben's sullen, brooding in
tensity and seems unable to

reach the emotional depth re
quired.
Fletcher falters
Director Fletcher's fidelity to
O'Neill lapses occasionally, in
troducing dissonance each time.
He overplays already obvious
sexuality, with unnecessary
primping by Abby and vague
hints of lechery when Ephraim
paws at her — both lacking in the
script.
People who complain of the
slowness of Desire Under the
Elms may fail to appreciate its
unusual power. Here classic
tragedy develops from the in
herent nature of the characters
and their world, something out
side their knowledge or control,
inexorably separate from envi
ronment and circumstance.
