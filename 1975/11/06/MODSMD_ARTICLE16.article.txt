# 'Boys from Syracuse' —delightful comedy
## 
### BoB Henry 
"This is a comedy set in An
cient Greece," The Boys From
Syracuse begins, "and if it's
good enough for Shakespeare,
it's good enough for us." And for
the audience.
This exuberant musical
bounces merrily from song to
song as it tells the story of
Shakespeare's The Comedy Of
Errors. Two sets of identical
twins had been separated at
birth, but after much confusion
and many mistaken identities,
get re-united.
Antipholus of Syracuse and
his servant Dromio arrive in
Ephesus, where, unbeknownst
to them, their twins, also named
Antipholus and Dromio, reside.
The Syracusians are thought to
be the Ephesians again and
again, resulting in mis-delivered
clothes and jewelry, bewildered
wives and general pan
demonium.
Crisp direction by Chris Silva
moves the show along nicely.

keeping it fresh and lively
throughout. He has adapted well
to the almost semi-circular stage
and uses the many entrances in
the functional yet pleasing set
(uncredited in the inadequate
program) quite comically, with
madcap chases leading in and
out and around pillars, revolv
ing doors, streets and alleys.
Energetic choreography by
Mary-Cleere Haran makes the
frisky musical fun to watch,
while stylish costuming by
"studio 275" and Patese Love
craft only add to the frolicking
entertainment.
Acting and singing all fare
well as only the Sergeant (John
Pantoleon) and Antipholus of
Ephesus (David Marsh) lack
satisfactory voices. Both
Dromios perform wonderfully,
adding an irreverant air to the
production.
Adriana (Laura Packard), wife
of ArMpholus of Ephesus and
the be.»i singer in the cast, beauti
fully renders "Palling In Love
With Love" and joins her sister
Luciana (Stephanie Rhoads) and
Dromio of Ephesus's wife Luce
(Karen Knapp) in a pleasing
"Sing For Supper."
Barry Koron directs a small
but agreeable band through Ro
gers and Hart's 28 melodies, as
the orchestra smoothly accen
tuates the singers.
Fine acting by the entire cast,
excellent pacing, costuming and
choreography, good music and
singing, witty dialogue, and
first-class direction make The
Boys From Syracuse fun enter
tainment. Reasonable prices and
student rush tickets encourage
attendance.
The show will be at The New
Varsity Theatre in Palo Alto
until Dec. 7.
