The Stanford Art Gallery is
giving free tours through Lon
don and Paris — unfortunately.
In viewing R.P. Bonington's and
T.S. Boys's "The Picturesque
Townscape in Lithography"
through the tourist's eyes, the
Gallery has neglected the most
dramatic and definitive aspects
of "picturesque townscape."
As a genre it transcends the
Gallery's perspective — a de
lightful stroll through charming
European thoroughfares and
countrysides. During the period
of these lithographs
(1820-1850), industrialism and
its concomitant lifestyle brought
massive transformation of the
cities.
This evoked a nostalgic mood
in art — the entire old society
was decaying and artists found a
kind of picturesqueness in
death. The Gallery merely hints
at this definitive aspect, though
last year's "City Views: Urban
Themes in Art" at the Stanford
Art Museum illuminated it:
. . . the conflict between past
and present, between nostalgia
and hard reality, the banality of
life and the beauty of death was
the source of a special, melan
choly poetry.
Superficial setup
The Gallery's treatment of the
picturesque townscape is sur
prisingly more superficial than
that and consequently less in

teresting. Little is lost, though, if
the visitor can see through this.
On the other hand, the artistry
of Bonington and Boys can
hardly be questioned. The works
of both represent the rearing of
lithography in the romantic gen
eration, with quality unsurpas
sed until Toulouse-Lautrec and
Redon.
Boys claims the invention of
color lithography. While this is a
matter of some dispute, the
technique nonetheless repres
ents a milestone in lithography
and emphasizes the historical
significance of the exhibition.
Famous works shown
We see Bonington in Voyages
Pittoresques et romantiques
dans I'ancienn France, the
"single most important work of
theera of romantic lithography."
Likewise, the Gallery shows
Boys's most famous works, in
Picturesque Architecture of
Paris and Original Views of Lon
don As It Is.
Bonington and Boys, though
both English artists, represent
different artistic schools in the
romantic generation.
Bonington's training in the
French school, as a painter and
watercolorist, lent itself to
lithography rather late, but his
popularity flourished.
Boys, on the other hand, was
typical of the English school.
Without formal training, he be
came an artist while working

with an engraver. His success
was short-lived.
Despite their differences,
Bonington's and Boys's works
today stand among the finest of
the 19th-century lithographs —
of course they are enjoyable in
themselves. The exhibition can
be a quaint little nostalgia trip.
Highlights
When you go to see it, though,
look first at one of the opening
lithographs, View of the Tempio
di Cibe/e by Piranesi — the pre
cursor of the picturesque
townscape movement. Sense the
Temple's poetic resignation in
its decay.
When you get to Blackfriars
for Southwark Bridge (Plate VI),
look at the belching London
chimneys, at the industry on
either side of the bridge and at
the bridge itself — the only re
minder of an old monastery.
Sense not only the charm of the
orphan bridge but its poetic res
ignation of the past in its present
setting.
Your tour through the streets
of Paris and London sans
sunglasses and Polaroid will
then show you true "picturesque
townscape."
The exhibition continues
through Nov. 30.

of Bonington and Boys can
hardly be questioned. The works
of both represent the rearing of
lithography in the romantic gen
eration, with quality unsurpas
sed until Toulouse-Lautrec and
Redon.
Boys claims the invention of
color lithography. While this is a
matter of some dispute, the
technique nonetheless repres
ents a milestone in lithography
and emphasizes the historical
significance of the exhibition.
Famous works shown
We see Bonington in Voyages
Pittoresques et romantiques
dans I'ancienn France, the
"single most important work of
theera of romantic lithography."
Likewise, the Gallery shows
Boys's most famous works, in
Picturesque Architecture of
Paris and Original Views of Lon
don As It Is.
Bonington and Boys, though
both English artists, represent
different artistic schools in the
romantic generation.
Bonington's training in the
French school, as a painter and
watercolorist, lent itself to
lithography rather late, but his
popularity flourished.
Boys, on the other hand, was
typical of the English school.
Without formal training, he be
came an artist while working

with an engraver. His success
was short-lived.
Despite their differences,
Bonington's and Boys's works
today stand among the finest of
the 19th-century lithographs —
of course they are enjoyable in
themselves. The exhibition can
be a quaint little nostalgia trip.
Highlights
When you go to see it, though,
look first at one of the opening
lithographs, View of the Tempio
di Cibe/e by Piranesi — the pre
cursor of the picturesque
townscape movement. Sense the
Temple's poetic resignation in
its decay.
When you get to Blackfriars
for Southwark Bridge (Plate VI),
look at the belching London
chimneys, at the industry on
either side of the bridge and at
the bridge itself — the only re
minder of an old monastery.
Sense not only the charm of the
orphan bridge but its poetic res
ignation of the past in its present
setting.
Your tour through the streets
of Paris and London sans
sunglasses and Polaroid will
then show you true "picturesque
townscape."
The exhibition continues
through Nov. 30.

In viewing R.P. Bonington's and
T.S. Boys's "The Picturesque
Townscape in Lithography"
through the tourist's eyes, the
Gallery has neglected the most
dramatic and definitive aspects
of "picturesque townscape."
As a genre it transcends the
Gallery's perspective — a de
lightful stroll through charming
European thoroughfares and
countrysides. During the period
of these lithographs
(1820-1850), industrialism and
its concomitant lifestyle brought
massive transformation of the
cities.
This evoked a nostalgic mood
in art — the entire old society
was decaying and artists found a
kind of picturesqueness in
death. The Gallery merely hints
at this definitive aspect, though
last year's "City Views: Urban
Themes in Art" at the Stanford
Art Museum illuminated it:
. . . the conflict between past
and present, between nostalgia
and hard reality, the banality of
life and the beauty of death was
the source of a special, melan
choly poetry.
Superficial setup
The Gallery's treatment of the
picturesque townscape is sur
prisingly more superficial than
that and consequently less in

teresting. Little is lost, though, if
the visitor can see through this.

When you go to see it, though,
look first at one of the opening
lithographs, View of the Tempio
di Cibe/e by Piranesi — the pre
cursor of the picturesque
townscape movement. Sense the
Temple's poetic resignation in
its decay.
When you get to Blackfriars
for Southwark Bridge (Plate VI),
look at the belching London
chimneys, at the industry on
either side of the bridge and at
the bridge itself — the only re
minder of an old monastery.
Sense not only the charm of the
orphan bridge but its poetic res
ignation of the past in its present
setting.
Your tour through the streets
of Paris and London sans
sunglasses and Polaroid will
then show you true "picturesque
townscape."
The exhibition continues
through Nov. 30.
