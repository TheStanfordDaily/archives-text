"Catch the brightest stars,"
"You're gonna like us a lot."
With promises like these, the
three major television networks
unleashed their new season of
programs on the American TV
audience.
Unfortunately and perhaps
inevitably, they are a sorry lot
indeed. The mediocre quality of
the majority made the few de
cent shows seem all the more
precious.
But instead of dwelling on the
poor, let's at least start with the
good ones. There's plenty of
time for the bad later.
Joe and Sons (Channel 5,
Tuesdays at 8:30). One of the
sleepers of the new season, Joe
and Sons brings us a humorous
look into the lives of Papa Joe,
his two mildly rebellious sons,
and their unusual neighbors and
friends. Jerry Stiller, as a meddl
ing buddy, stands out with his
gifted comic ability and could
easily be given his own show. A
little ethnic humor, likable
characters, and some funny situ
ations all add up to a winner.
Ellery Queen (Channel 4,
Thursdays at 9). The famous de
tective is trotted out again but,
happily, this time, he's in better
shape. Mild-mannered Queen
(Jim Hutton) "aids" his father, a
New York police inspector
played by David Wayne, in solv
ing his weekly murder case. The
atmosphere of the '40s is re
created with reverence and each
whodunit features several out
standing character actors as sus
pects. With the help of good
writers, Ellery Queen manages
to make murder almost fun — to
watch, that is.
No, Honestly (Channel 9.
Saturdays at 10). This British
import features a charming cou
ple, C.D. and Clara, who re
minisce about their remarkable
exploits together. Each plot is

something out of a P.G.
Wodehouse novel. And like his
stories, it's not uproariously
hilarious but mildly amusing all
the same. One of the few shining
stars in an otherwise bleak
KQED program schedule.
Switch (Channel 5, Tuesdays
at 9). Eddie Albert and Robert
Wagner star as two private eyes
who invent elaborate con games

toassist their clients. Their ploys
are along the lines of Mission:
Impossible, far-fetched but en
tertaining, and Albert and
Wagner provide good charac
terizations. But the real star of
the series turns out to be veteran
character actor Charlie Callas.

programs on the American TV
audience.
Unfortunately and perhaps
inevitably, they are a sorry lot
indeed. The mediocre quality of
the majority made the few de
cent shows seem all the more
precious.
But instead of dwelling on the
poor, let's at least start with the
good ones. There's plenty of
time for the bad later.
Joe and Sons (Channel 5,
Tuesdays at 8:30). One of the
sleepers of the new season, Joe
and Sons brings us a humorous
look into the lives of Papa Joe,
his two mildly rebellious sons,
and their unusual neighbors and
friends. Jerry Stiller, as a meddl
ing buddy, stands out with his
gifted comic ability and could
easily be given his own show. A
little ethnic humor, likable
characters, and some funny situ
ations all add up to a winner.
Ellery Queen (Channel 4,
Thursdays at 9). The famous de
tective is trotted out again but,
happily, this time, he's in better
shape. Mild-mannered Queen
(Jim Hutton) "aids" his father, a
New York police inspector
played by David Wayne, in solv
ing his weekly murder case. The
atmosphere of the '40s is re
created with reverence and each
whodunit features several out
standing character actors as sus
pects. With the help of good
writers, Ellery Queen manages
to make murder almost fun — to
watch, that is.
No, Honestly (Channel 9.
Saturdays at 10). This British
import features a charming cou
ple, C.D. and Clara, who re
minisce about their remarkable
exploits together. Each plot is

something out of a P.G.
Wodehouse novel. And like his
stories, it's not uproariously
hilarious but mildly amusing all
the same. One of the few shining
stars in an otherwise bleak
KQED program schedule.
Switch (Channel 5, Tuesdays
at 9). Eddie Albert and Robert
Wagner star as two private eyes
who invent elaborate con games

toassist their clients. Their ploys
are along the lines of Mission:
Impossible, far-fetched but en
tertaining, and Albert and
Wagner provide good charac
terizations. But the real star of
the series turns out to be veteran
character actor Charlie Callas.
