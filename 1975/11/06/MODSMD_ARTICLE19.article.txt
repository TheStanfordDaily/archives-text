# 'Don Juan' stifles
## 
### reviewed BoB Henry 
Billed as "a feast of humor and
wit," the Venture Theater
Group's production of George
Bernard Shaw's Don /uari in Hell
(at the Showcase Theatre in San
Francisco) resembles more the
Christmas turkey carcass on
New Year's Day — mainly bone
with very few chunks of meat.
The story takes place in Hell,
and the Venture Group, like
most other productions, has all
four characters sit on stools on a
deserted stage and speak their
lines. This intensifies the stifling
debate-like nature of the play, as
the "action" is only Don Juan
explaining to his good friend the
Commander (who has just left
Heaven in favor of Hell) and to
Lucifer himself, why he must
leave Hell and go to Heaven.
The transportation poses no
problem for the travelers, the
path being more a mental strain
than a physical one. Don Juan,
who has spent a fair amount of
time in Hell, declares "Hell is
like the first act of a fashionable
play, before the complications
setin."Thepeoplein Hell havea
wonderful time, surrounded by
music, sculpture and "beauty,"
but Don Juan wants a challenge
in life.
Heaven offers that challenge
— contemplation of the nature of
happiness and the purpose of

life, for instance, which prompts
the Commander to choose the
complacency and easy living of
Hell.
Some of Shaw's irrepressible
wit surfaces in the script, but the
long, tedious tirades by Don Juan
only bore and do not fascinate.
Commonplace acting does not
help the burdensom dialogue.
Mary Ashburn Stephens as Dona
Ana, the Commander's daughter
whom Don Juan once tried to
seduce, cannot firmly establish
the character of one who resents
being sent to Hell after a virtuous
life.
Bill Rufford (the Commander)
and Bill Ackridge (Lucifer) wal
low in a swamp of mediocrity,
and Irving Israel cannot handle
the difficult, overbearing
speeches given Don Juan.
The play becomes a vehicle for
Shaw to announce his idea on
the worst place possible to go
after death — an obsequious lo
cation where one does not think,
only act and enjoy. Shaw states
that the only truly happy people
are philosophers, but the
philosopher in Don /uan in Hell
cannot communicate his distaste
of Hell and desire for thought
and contemplation in a captivat
ing manner.
The show plays every Wed
nesday through Nov. 19.
