# How to survive the trip to
## LOS ANGELES and what to do once you're there 
### Chris Baker 
If you're even considering going to Los
Angeles this weekend, then by all means
do it. The city itself is fascinating — and
getting there is half the fun.
To save the $45 air fare, get a group of
friends together and drive down. The fas
test route is Interstate 5 — probably the
most boring drive ever conceived. It's 400
miles of straight highway, surrounded by
nothing.
Or almost nothing. The gas stations are
rare, the emergency phones nonexistent.
As a result, prices are higher then any
where else in the state.
And while you're paying 70 cents a gal
lon for regular, you'll also discover that
the only food near the station comes from
vending machines. Take your choice
—stale sandwiches, candy or soda pop.
Suicidal stretch
Those starting the drive on Highway
101 will soon encounter "suicide drive,"
a 14-mile stretch where the speed limit is
a lethal 55. Conservationists have hin
dered rebuilding efforts.
The Pacheco Pass (from 101 to 1-5) is
scenic, though slow. Once on 1-5, you'll
discover that your gas gauge stays on full
for about 200 miles, then takes a serious
drop. That's because the road is very hot
during the day, and the gasoline evapo
rates.
You should get to Los Angeles in seven
hours if you keep the speed down to 55.
But the highway was designed for 70, and
with some luck, you can average 80.
These tricks have worked in the past:
—The California Highway Patrol (CHP)
uses late-model Dodges with a blue/red
bar on top. Check the top of your mirror
first.
—If you see a cop slow down going the
other direction, check your rearview mir
ror to be sure he hasn't turned around.
Cops like Buttonwillow
—Cops like to hide on freeway entr
ances and behind overpasses. Use caution
when approaching them. And slow down
around Kettlemen City and Buttonwillow
— that's where most of the cops hang out.
—The CHP also uses airplanes to catch
speeders during the day, so watch over
head.
You might even get buzzed by a crop
duster along the way. They like to play
jokes on drivers.
Macs in tops
The best restaurant on 1-5 is
McDonald's in Buttonwillow (it's also the
largest in California). Kettlemen City
counters with Country Kitchen — but it
serves the greasiest hamburgers around.
Crapevine Hill will be the last stretch of
your drive. Once you climb the 7-mile
incline, the driving is good. Halfway up,
you'll see the Los Angeles county limit
sign. Don't slow down, thinking Los
Angeles is just around the bend — you'll
be about an hour from the Civic Center.
Once you're in Los Angeles, you'll be
happy you brought a car.lf you fly. make
sure you know someone with a car, or
you'll spend a lot of time waiting for the
not-so-Rapid Transit District buses.
The compleat 1..A.
"Los Angeles" is probably the most
abused name in the world. The citv itself

has only about two-and-a-half million
persons, but the term takes in everything
from just south of Bakersfield to just north
of San Diego. So if a friend says he's from
L.A., make sure he doesn't mean
Cucamonga.
Once you arrive, you'll probably be
famished (Snik-Snaks do not a meal
make), but you'll have many eateries to
try.
For the best chili hotdogs and hambur
gers in the world, check out The
Original Tommy's. It's located at the in
tersection of Beverly and Rampart, right
off the Hollywood Freeway.
Once you get off the freeway you'll
probably curse the Daily for leading you
here. Tommy's is a small stand that's
open 24 hours and you have to stand up
while you eat. But there's always a line
because of the food. It's also cheap.
Made in (apan
For Mexican food, go to Alvera Street in
the heart of downtown Los Angeles. You
can explore the tourist stands pedling
genuine Mexican artifacts (imported from
Japan) while you're waiting for your
meal.
If you have a bit of money to spend, go
to The Great American Food and Bever
age Company in Santa Monica. They
make obscene ice-cream sundies (they
look like.Stanford Band formations), and
the speciality of the house — the planked
feast — is excellent. Plan to wait about
one hour for a table, but since everyone
who works there — kitchen help, dis
hwashers, etc. — must be able to entertain
in some way. you'll feel like it's only a
couple of minutes.
Restaurant Row
Restaurant Row in Beverly Hills offers
some of the best food in town, but the

prices are high. Everyone has probably
heard of Lawry's Restaurant, and it de
serves its name. The beef is super.
The original Brown Derby on Wilshire
Boulevard is nice to look at (yes, it is actu
ally a hat), but the food is overpriced.
And while you're on Wilshire, you
might feel like a drive to the beach. Just
take Wilshire west and you'll eventually
(about four hours later) wind up on the
Pacific Ocean. A much easier way to get to
the beach is to take the Santa Monica
Freeway to the Pacific Coast Highway.
Tinsel town
Hollywood isn't a city in its own right,
but you might want to take a walk down
Hollywood Boulevard. The Chamber of
Commerce spent untold sums of money
to honor the city by putting movie per
sonalities names in stars on the sidewalk.
They finally gave Charlie Chaplin his
own star a couple of years ago (they felt he
was about do die), and it's at the corner of
Hollywood and Vine.
But you'll probably see more transves
titesand hookers than stars on Hollywood
Boulevard. Mann's Chinese Theater is a
few yards west of Highland Avenue, and
you can see why Hollywood died by com
ing here. But you can try to match your
footprints with those of the stars.
Relieve the '50s
A drive down the Sunset Strip on Fri
day or Saturday night is a throwback to
the 19505. Traffic moves slower than the
Hollywood Freeway from mid-afternoon
on, but the atmosphere is strictly Hol
lywood.
And there's always the standard
Tourist fare. Los Angeles, which may be
the biggest real-life amusement park in

the country, has more amusement parks
per capita than any other city.
Everyone has probably heard of Disney
land, but it's still making money. It's open
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends. Take the
Santa Ana Freeway to Harbor Boulevard
and follow the signs. Universal studios
offers a good tour of the backlot television
sets (you can even part the Red Sea).
Nixon's favorite
Knott's Berry Farm is a conservative
(they recently held a dinner honoring
Richard Nixon) but good amusement
park. The new Roaring Twenties section
offers a roller coaster which will turn you
and your stomach upside down. Take the
Santa Ana Freeway to Beach Boulevard
and follow the signs.
And there's even a football game taking
place at the Los Angeles Memorial Col
iseum Saturday afternoon. You can reach
it by taking the Harbor Freeway south to
either Exposition or Santa Barbara
Boulevards and then going west. Parking
costs $2 in any state-owned lot, but it
costs $1 at USC, and the lots are easier to
leave.
And in case you have the time, the
world famous Rose Bowl is located in
Pasadena, just 15 miles north of the Col
iseum. Take the Pasadena Freeway North
to Orange Grove and go north to Seco
Street. The Bowl is down in the Arroyo
Seco.
It may be the only time you see it.
Another word of caution. Freeway
signs may be deceptive. A sign may say
north to Pasadena when it's actually
northeast. Just follow the freeway signs,
not your compass. Better still, get a Los
Angeles freeway map from the Auto Club.
Or use ours.

Nixon's favorite
Knott's Berry Farm is a conservative
(they recently held a dinner honoring
Richard Nixon) but good amusement
park. The new Roaring Twenties section
offers a roller coaster which will turn you
and your stomach upside down. Take the
Santa Ana Freeway to Beach Boulevard
and follow the signs.
And there's even a football game taking
place at the Los Angeles Memorial Col
iseum Saturday afternoon. You can reach
it by taking the Harbor Freeway south to
either Exposition or Santa Barbara
Boulevards and then going west. Parking
costs $2 in any state-owned lot, but it
costs $1 at USC, and the lots are easier to
leave.
And in case you have the time, the
world famous Rose Bowl is located in
Pasadena, just 15 miles north of the Col
iseum. Take the Pasadena Freeway North
to Orange Grove and go north to Seco
Street. The Bowl is down in the Arroyo
Seco.
It may be the only time you see it.
Another word of caution. Freeway
signs may be deceptive. A sign may say
north to Pasadena when it's actually
northeast. Just follow the freeway signs,
not your compass. Better still, get a Los
Angeles freeway map from the Auto Club.
Or use ours.

If you're even considering going to Los
Angeles this weekend, then by all means
do it. The city itself is fascinating — and
getting there is half the fun.
To save the $45 air fare, get a group of
friends together and drive down. The fas
test route is Interstate 5 — probably the
most boring drive ever conceived. It's 400
miles of straight highway, surrounded by
nothing.
Or almost nothing. The gas stations are
rare, the emergency phones nonexistent.
As a result, prices are higher then any
where else in the state.
And while you're paying 70 cents a gal
lon for regular, you'll also discover that
the only food near the station comes from
vending machines. Take your choice
—stale sandwiches, candy or soda pop.
Suicidal stretch
Those starting the drive on Highway
101 will soon encounter "suicide drive,"
a 14-mile stretch where the speed limit is
a lethal 55. Conservationists have hin
dered rebuilding efforts.
The Pacheco Pass (from 101 to 1-5) is
scenic, though slow. Once on 1-5, you'll
discover that your gas gauge stays on full
for about 200 miles, then takes a serious
drop. That's because the road is very hot
during the day, and the gasoline evapo
rates.
You should get to Los Angeles in seven
hours if you keep the speed down to 55.
But the highway was designed for 70, and
with some luck, you can average 80.
These tricks have worked in the past:
—The California Highway Patrol (CHP)
uses late-model Dodges with a blue/red
bar on top. Check the top of your mirror
first.
—If you see a cop slow down going the
other direction, check your rearview mir
ror to be sure he hasn't turned around.
Cops like Buttonwillow
—Cops like to hide on freeway entr
ances and behind overpasses. Use caution
when approaching them. And slow down
around Kettlemen City and Buttonwillow
— that's where most of the cops hang out.
—The CHP also uses airplanes to catch
speeders during the day, so watch over
head.
You might even get buzzed by a crop
duster along the way. They like to play
jokes on drivers.
Macs in tops
The best restaurant on 1-5 is
McDonald's in Buttonwillow (it's also the
largest in California). Kettlemen City
counters with Country Kitchen — but it
serves the greasiest hamburgers around.
Crapevine Hill will be the last stretch of
your drive. Once you climb the 7-mile
incline, the driving is good. Halfway up,
you'll see the Los Angeles county limit
sign. Don't slow down, thinking Los
Angeles is just around the bend — you'll
be about an hour from the Civic Center.
Once you're in Los Angeles, you'll be
happy you brought a car.lf you fly. make
sure you know someone with a car, or
you'll spend a lot of time waiting for the
not-so-Rapid Transit District buses.

"Los Angeles" is probably the most

For Mexican food, go to Alvera Street in

Hollywood isn't a city in its own right,

They finally gave Charlie Chaplin his
own star a couple of years ago (they felt he

Hollywood and Vine.
But you'll probably see more transves

you can see why Hollywood died by com
ing here. But you can try to match your
footprints with those of the stars.
Relieve the '50s
A drive down the Sunset Strip on Fri

But you'll probably see more transves

Relieve the '50s
A drive down the Sunset Strip on Fri
day or Saturday night is a throwback to
the 19505. Traffic moves slower than the
Hollywood Freeway from mid-afternoon
on, but the atmosphere is strictly Hol
lywood.
And there's always the standard
Tourist fare. Los Angeles, which may be
the biggest real-life amusement park in

the country, has more amusement parks
per capita than any other city.
Everyone has probably heard of Disney
land, but it's still making money. It's open
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends. Take the
Santa Ana Freeway to Harbor Boulevard
and follow the signs. Universal studios
offers a good tour of the backlot television
sets (you can even part the Red Sea).
Nixon's favorite
Knott's Berry Farm is a conservative
(they recently held a dinner honoring
Richard Nixon) but good amusement
park. The new Roaring Twenties section
offers a roller coaster which will turn you
and your stomach upside down. Take the
Santa Ana Freeway to Beach Boulevard
and follow the signs.
And there's even a football game taking
place at the Los Angeles Memorial Col
iseum Saturday afternoon. You can reach
it by taking the Harbor Freeway south to
either Exposition or Santa Barbara
Boulevards and then going west. Parking
costs $2 in any state-owned lot, but it
costs $1 at USC, and the lots are easier to
leave.
And in case you have the time, the
world famous Rose Bowl is located in
Pasadena, just 15 miles north of the Col
iseum. Take the Pasadena Freeway North
to Orange Grove and go north to Seco
Street. The Bowl is down in the Arroyo
Seco.
It may be the only time you see it.
Another word of caution. Freeway
signs may be deceptive. A sign may say
north to Pasadena when it's actually
northeast. Just follow the freeway signs,
not your compass. Better still, get a Los
Angeles freeway map from the Auto Club.
Or use ours.

If you're even considering going to Los
Angeles this weekend, then by all means
do it. The city itself is fascinating — and
getting there is half the fun.
To save the $45 air fare, get a group of
friends together and drive down. The fas
test route is Interstate 5 — probably the
most boring drive ever conceived. It's 400
miles of straight highway, surrounded by
nothing.
Or almost nothing. The gas stations are
rare, the emergency phones nonexistent.
As a result, prices are higher then any
where else in the state.
And while you're paying 70 cents a gal
lon for regular, you'll also discover that
the only food near the station comes from
vending machines. Take your choice
—stale sandwiches, candy or soda pop.
Suicidal stretch
Those starting the drive on Highway
101 will soon encounter "suicide drive,"
a 14-mile stretch where the speed limit is
a lethal 55. Conservationists have hin
dered rebuilding efforts.
The Pacheco Pass (from 101 to 1-5) is
scenic, though slow. Once on 1-5, you'll
discover that your gas gauge stays on full
for about 200 miles, then takes a serious
drop. That's because the road is very hot
during the day, and the gasoline evapo
rates.
You should get to Los Angeles in seven
hours if you keep the speed down to 55.
But the highway was designed for 70, and
with some luck, you can average 80.
These tricks have worked in the past:
—The California Highway Patrol (CHP)
uses late-model Dodges with a blue/red
bar on top. Check the top of your mirror
first.
—If you see a cop slow down going the
other direction, check your rearview mir
ror to be sure he hasn't turned around.
Cops like Buttonwillow
—Cops like to hide on freeway entr
ances and behind overpasses. Use caution
when approaching them. And slow down
around Kettlemen City and Buttonwillow
— that's where most of the cops hang out.
—The CHP also uses airplanes to catch
speeders during the day, so watch over
head.
You might even get buzzed by a crop
duster along the way. They like to play
jokes on drivers.
Macs in tops
The best restaurant on 1-5 is
McDonald's in Buttonwillow (it's also the
largest in California). Kettlemen City
counters with Country Kitchen — but it
serves the greasiest hamburgers around.
Crapevine Hill will be the last stretch of
your drive. Once you climb the 7-mile
incline, the driving is good. Halfway up,
you'll see the Los Angeles county limit
sign. Don't slow down, thinking Los
Angeles is just around the bend — you'll
be about an hour from the Civic Center.
Once you're in Los Angeles, you'll be
happy you brought a car.lf you fly. make
sure you know someone with a car, or
you'll spend a lot of time waiting for the
not-so-Rapid Transit District buses.

"Los Angeles" is probably the most

The original Brown Derby on Wilshire

And while you're on Wilshire, you

one hour for a table, but since everyone

hwashers, etc. — must be able to entertain
in some way. you'll feel like it's only a
couple of minutes.
Restaurant Row
Restaurant Row in Beverly Hills offers
some of the best food in town, but the

prices are high. Everyone has probably
heard of Lawry's Restaurant, and it de
serves its name. The beef is super.
The original Brown Derby on Wilshire
Boulevard is nice to look at (yes, it is actu
ally a hat), but the food is overpriced.
And while you're on Wilshire, you
might feel like a drive to the beach. Just
take Wilshire west and you'll eventually
(about four hours later) wind up on the
Pacific Ocean. A much easier way to get to
the beach is to take the Santa Monica
Freeway to the Pacific Coast Highway.
Tinsel town
Hollywood isn't a city in its own right,
but you might want to take a walk down
Hollywood Boulevard. The Chamber of
Commerce spent untold sums of money
to honor the city by putting movie per
sonalities names in stars on the sidewalk.
They finally gave Charlie Chaplin his
own star a couple of years ago (they felt he
was about do die), and it's at the corner of
Hollywood and Vine.
But you'll probably see more transves
titesand hookers than stars on Hollywood
Boulevard. Mann's Chinese Theater is a
few yards west of Highland Avenue, and
you can see why Hollywood died by com
ing here. But you can try to match your
footprints with those of the stars.
Relieve the '50s
A drive down the Sunset Strip on Fri
day or Saturday night is a throwback to
the 19505. Traffic moves slower than the
Hollywood Freeway from mid-afternoon
on, but the atmosphere is strictly Hol
lywood.
And there's always the standard
Tourist fare. Los Angeles, which may be
the biggest real-life amusement park in

the country, has more amusement parks
per capita than any other city.
Everyone has probably heard of Disney
land, but it's still making money. It's open
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends. Take the
Santa Ana Freeway to Harbor Boulevard
and follow the signs. Universal studios
offers a good tour of the backlot television
sets (you can even part the Red Sea).
Nixon's favorite
Knott's Berry Farm is a conservative
(they recently held a dinner honoring
Richard Nixon) but good amusement
park. The new Roaring Twenties section
offers a roller coaster which will turn you
and your stomach upside down. Take the
Santa Ana Freeway to Beach Boulevard
and follow the signs.
And there's even a football game taking
place at the Los Angeles Memorial Col
iseum Saturday afternoon. You can reach
it by taking the Harbor Freeway south to
either Exposition or Santa Barbara
Boulevards and then going west. Parking
costs $2 in any state-owned lot, but it
costs $1 at USC, and the lots are easier to
leave.
And in case you have the time, the
world famous Rose Bowl is located in
Pasadena, just 15 miles north of the Col
iseum. Take the Pasadena Freeway North
to Orange Grove and go north to Seco
Street. The Bowl is down in the Arroyo
Seco.
It may be the only time you see it.
Another word of caution. Freeway
signs may be deceptive. A sign may say
north to Pasadena when it's actually
northeast. Just follow the freeway signs,
not your compass. Better still, get a Los
Angeles freeway map from the Auto Club.
Or use ours.

If you're even considering going to Los
Angeles this weekend, then by all means
do it. The city itself is fascinating — and
getting there is half the fun.
To save the $45 air fare, get a group of
friends together and drive down. The fas
test route is Interstate 5 — probably the
most boring drive ever conceived. It's 400
miles of straight highway, surrounded by
nothing.
Or almost nothing. The gas stations are
rare, the emergency phones nonexistent.
As a result, prices are higher then any
where else in the state.
And while you're paying 70 cents a gal
lon for regular, you'll also discover that
the only food near the station comes from
vending machines. Take your choice
—stale sandwiches, candy or soda pop.
Suicidal stretch
Those starting the drive on Highway
101 will soon encounter "suicide drive,"
a 14-mile stretch where the speed limit is
a lethal 55. Conservationists have hin
dered rebuilding efforts.
The Pacheco Pass (from 101 to 1-5) is
scenic, though slow. Once on 1-5, you'll
discover that your gas gauge stays on full
for about 200 miles, then takes a serious
drop. That's because the road is very hot
during the day, and the gasoline evapo
rates.
You should get to Los Angeles in seven
hours if you keep the speed down to 55.
But the highway was designed for 70, and
with some luck, you can average 80.
These tricks have worked in the past:
—The California Highway Patrol (CHP)
uses late-model Dodges with a blue/red
bar on top. Check the top of your mirror
first.
—If you see a cop slow down going the
other direction, check your rearview mir
ror to be sure he hasn't turned around.
Cops like Buttonwillow
—Cops like to hide on freeway entr
ances and behind overpasses. Use caution
when approaching them. And slow down
around Kettlemen City and Buttonwillow
— that's where most of the cops hang out.
—The CHP also uses airplanes to catch
speeders during the day, so watch over
head.
You might even get buzzed by a crop
duster along the way. They like to play
jokes on drivers.
Macs in tops
The best restaurant on 1-5 is
McDonald's in Buttonwillow (it's also the
largest in California). Kettlemen City
counters with Country Kitchen — but it
serves the greasiest hamburgers around.
Crapevine Hill will be the last stretch of
your drive. Once you climb the 7-mile
incline, the driving is good. Halfway up,
you'll see the Los Angeles county limit
sign. Don't slow down, thinking Los
Angeles is just around the bend — you'll
be about an hour from the Civic Center.
Once you're in Los Angeles, you'll be
happy you brought a car.lf you fly. make
sure you know someone with a car, or
you'll spend a lot of time waiting for the
not-so-Rapid Transit District buses.
The compleat 1..A.
"Los Angeles" is probably the most
abused name in the world. The citv itself

has only about two-and-a-half million
persons, but the term takes in everything
from just south of Bakersfield to just north
of San Diego. So if a friend says he's from
L.A., make sure he doesn't mean
Cucamonga.
Once you arrive, you'll probably be
famished (Snik-Snaks do not a meal
make), but you'll have many eateries to
try.
For the best chili hotdogs and hambur
gers in the world, check out The
Original Tommy's. It's located at the in
tersection of Beverly and Rampart, right
off the Hollywood Freeway.
Once you get off the freeway you'll
probably curse the Daily for leading you
here. Tommy's is a small stand that's
open 24 hours and you have to stand up
while you eat. But there's always a line
because of the food. It's also cheap.

For Mexican food, go to Alvera Street in
the heart of downtown Los Angeles. You
can explore the tourist stands pedling

to The Great American Food and Bever
