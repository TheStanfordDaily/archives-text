# Toe-tapping jazz is back
## 
### John Strand 
Those who enjoy traditional
jazz belong at Palo Alto's Iron
Works restaurant this Sunday.
There, on alternate Sundays
from 4-8 p.m., the Magnolia Jazz
Band inspires toe-tapping and
leaves the audience glowing
with some of the finest old New
Orleans style Dixieland jazz to
be heard in the Bay Area.
The band arose spontaneously

about a year ago when several of
the group were asked to perform
together at Carl's restaurant in
San Jose. Fusing together the tal
ents of Robbie Schlosser
(coronet), Jim Borkenhagen
(trumpet), Jim Klippert (trom
bone) and four others, the Mag
nolia band has since played at
L'Ommie's and Victoria Gar
dens, both in Palo Alto, and has
been well-received at such jazz

showcases as the Old Sac
ramento Dixieland Jubilee and
the annual picnic of the New Or
leans Jazz Club of Northern
California.
The jazz played by the band
has its base in New Orleans in
the 19205. All good jazz requires
a "from the gut" feeling from its
players, and this is no exception.
It is an emotional style, both in
timate and loud, best exemp
lified by the renowned New Or
leans Preservation Hall Jazz
Band.
"It's an improvised ensemble
style," Schlosser explained,
"less commercial, less showy
than later styles. We try to state a
theme, then we improvise to
gether rather than individually.
We find it much more satisfying
that way."
The Magnolia band has a re
pertoire of about 180 tunes rang
ing from old favorites, "Ice
Cream Man" and "Sweet Geor
gia Brown," to slow spirituals
such as "Close To Me" and "Old
Rugged Cross." It also includes
several more current arrange
ments set in the '20s style.
"We've found that small
places are most conducive to the
type of music we play. For us,
the whole thing is sitting up
there, sweating, playing hard
and seeing people right down in
front of you dancing and enjoy
ing themselves. That feeling
would be lost in a large concert
hall with 5000 people out there,"
Schlosser said.
• He said the group's main con
cern is keeping the music alive,
so people are "aware that there is
an alternative to A 1 Hirt and Pete
Fountain. We just hope that
people will come down and
enjoy themselves."
