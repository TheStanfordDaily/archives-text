Since its inception in May 1973, the Berkeley-based Foot
loose Dance Company has quickly earned the reputation of
being one of the Bay Area's most innovative and adventure
some dance groups.
Eschewing the traditional proscenium stage, Footloose has
lived up to its name by performing anywhere from the futuris
tic University Art Museum to the slippery Villancourt Foun
tain.
Footloose recently performed in San Francisco in the second
of a four-part series of dance events being sponsored by the Old
First Church (located at the corner of Van Ness Avenue and
Sacramento Street in San Francisco).
Entitled "A Footloose Dance Event,'" the evening was a brief
but intriguing sampling of the company's technique, improvi
sational skills and repertory. As both a student at Julliard and
a former dance instructor at UC-Berkeley, Irene Nadel (the
company's artistic director) boasts a decidedly professional
background. It comes, then, as no surprise that Nadel extracts a
remarkable degree of competency from her dancers.
After a smooth demonstration of something called "Foot
loose modern dance technique" (which proved to be a skillful
blend of modern dance and classical ballet exercises), the
company launched into a cleverly structured improvisation.
Using the old wooden choir loft as background, the dancers
mimicked targets of bobbing heads and wiggling feet in a
shooting gallery. They ended with a mocking series of frozen
tableaux that bordered on the sacreligious in their teasing use
of the altar.
Indeed, much of the efficacy and charm of Nadel's choreog
raphy lies in its wry and unpredictable humor. It often seems
that just when one begins to enjoy the ease and sweep of the
movement, Nadel will throw in a political or social twist.
This unique brand of Nadel chicanery is especially evident
in "American Mindscape," a crazy collage of mimed mug
gings, soft-shoe routines and slow-motion football scrim
mages. In one memorable section Nadel recites a "Dear Amy"
advice letter while executing a bizarre combination of hand
signals and loose-jointed foot shuffles.
Nadel apparently enjoys this subtle juxtaposition of certain
elements because it allows her to play with the innate absur
dity of situations while still retaining a firm hold on the order
and structuring of her dances.
The Old First Church Dance Series will continue with the
Margaret Jenkins Dance Company on Nov. 14 and The Gwen
Lewis Afro-American Experience on Dec. 12. All perfor
mances are at the church at 10 p.m.
