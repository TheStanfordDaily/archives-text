## S.F. Symphony's autumn resident conductor discusses everything from Mozart to the musical use of computers 
### Richard Cross 
Amid the bizarre scenery of
the Stanford Artificial Intellig
ence Laboratory, conductor Nik
laus Wyss unveiled some of the
entertainment that awaits listen
ers at this month's Mozart festi
val of the San Francisco Sym
phony.
The festival, similar to one last
year that explored the music of
the Bach family, will feature
works from every musical genre
in which Mozart wrote except
grand opera and the mass.
"From time to time one tries to
demonstrate a musical style or
personality," said Wyss. "In this
case we are trying to feature
Mozart in as many different
fields as possible — symphony,
concerto, ballet, opera and 'en
tertainment' (namely, the "Six
German Dances").
Joining Wyss in the series of
three programs will be a host of
visiting and indigenous artists
including Alexander Schneider,
conductor and violinist, Christ
oph Eschenbach, conductor and
pianist, harpist Anne Adams,

flutist Paul Renzi, sopranos Elsa
Charlston and Raye Robinson
and tenor Daniel Parkerson.
With this impressive contingent
will be the improbably and in
famous P.n.Q. Bach — or Peter
Schickele, as he is known to
music historians.
Wyss and Schickele will col
laborate in what promises to be
the most unusual work offered in
the festival — "The Impresario,"
a kind of comic opera.
Because there are several
"original" texts of "The Impre
sario" to choose from, and be
cause the story of the harried
impresario (who must contend
with two jealous sopranos) is so
thoroughly at home in the mod
ern scene, it seemed appropriate
to call in Schickele to modernize
the text — and act as narrator.
"There is even one point at
which Peter has to sing," Wyss
noted with amusement.
Family helped
Wyss said that "The Impre
sario" is probably a "family af
fair," meaning that he suspects
some musical collusion — for

the sake of the sport — on the
part of Mozart's wife and sister.
"The Impresario" should not
be mistaken for minor Mozart,
however. Wyss noted that —
next to "The Magic Flute" — it
contains the most demanding (
and some of the most beautiful)
passages for the famale voice

that Mozart ever wrote.
VVyss, who spends his con
ducting time in Europe, Japan
and San Francisco, will also di
rect "Les Petits Riens," a ballet
that is a delightful succession of
brief vignettes, and the "Prague"
Symphony. (No. 38).
Festival tonight
Wyss's program will comprise
the third and last presented dur
ing the symphony's Mozart fes
tival. In separate programs Alex
ander Schneider and Christoph
Eschenbach will appear as con
ductors and soloists.

The first will play tonight at
the Flint Center (which Wyss de
scribes as acoustically "very
special") at I)e An/a College and
tomorrow at the Palace of Fine
Arts in San Francisco.
VVyss said that, from his point
of view at least, the future of
classical music is getting brigh
ter. He noted that each year he
has served as resident conductor
in San Francisco, audiences
have increased. He also men
tioned that the Japanese appetite
for classical music appeared lo
be insatiable.
The somewhat baffling con
junction of Wyss and the Artifi
cial Intelligence (i.e., computer)
Laboratory was explained by
Loren Rush, a worker at the
laboratory where research is
being done for the benefit of
composers and musicians. Work
has advanced to the point where
the sound of any musical in
strument can be duplicated by a
computer.
Computerized compositions
Thus, composers can now sit
down and compose at
computer-terminal keyboards.
Their compositions are limited,
however, to the more addition
and subtraction of sounds: The
problem of creating a phrase
comparable, say, to one of Jascha
Heifetz's is still to be solved.
Wyss confessed that he is still
a newcomer to artificial intellig
ence.
"I have trouble with the
signs," he commented some
what enigmatically.
Ruch indicated that Wyss was
referring to the intricacies of
computer programming,
mathematics and the physics of
sound waves.
"But I have a great interest in
this," Wyss continued. "It is
very important to my own
work."

personality," said Wyss. "In this
case we are trying to feature
Mozart in as many different
fields as possible — symphony,
concerto, ballet, opera and 'en
tertainment' (namely, the "Six
German Dances").
Joining Wyss in the series of
three programs will be a host of
visiting and indigenous artists
including Alexander Schneider,
conductor and violinist, Christ
oph Eschenbach, conductor and
pianist, harpist Anne Adams,

flutist Paul Renzi, sopranos Elsa
Charlston and Raye Robinson
and tenor Daniel Parkerson.
With this impressive contingent
will be the improbably and in
famous P.n.Q. Bach — or Peter
Schickele, as he is known to
music historians.
Wyss and Schickele will col
laborate in what promises to be
the most unusual work offered in
the festival — "The Impresario,"
a kind of comic opera.
Because there are several
"original" texts of "The Impre
sario" to choose from, and be
cause the story of the harried
impresario (who must contend
with two jealous sopranos) is so
thoroughly at home in the mod
ern scene, it seemed appropriate
to call in Schickele to modernize
the text — and act as narrator.
"There is even one point at
which Peter has to sing," Wyss
noted with amusement.
Family helped
Wyss said that "The Impre
sario" is probably a "family af
fair," meaning that he suspects
some musical collusion — for

the sake of the sport — on the
part of Mozart's wife and sister.
"The Impresario" should not
be mistaken for minor Mozart,
however. Wyss noted that —
next to "The Magic Flute" — it
contains the most demanding (
and some of the most beautiful)
passages for the famale voice

that Mozart ever wrote.
VVyss, who spends his con
ducting time in Europe, Japan
and San Francisco, will also di
rect "Les Petits Riens," a ballet
that is a delightful succession of
brief vignettes, and the "Prague"
Symphony. (No. 38).
Festival tonight
Wyss's program will comprise
the third and last presented dur
ing the symphony's Mozart fes
tival. In separate programs Alex
ander Schneider and Christoph
Eschenbach will appear as con
ductors and soloists.

The first will play tonight at
the Flint Center (which Wyss de
scribes as acoustically "very
special") at I)e An/a College and
tomorrow at the Palace of Fine
Arts in San Francisco.
VVyss said that, from his point
of view at least, the future of
classical music is getting brigh
ter. He noted that each year he
has served as resident conductor
in San Francisco, audiences
have increased. He also men
tioned that the Japanese appetite
for classical music appeared lo
be insatiable.
The somewhat baffling con
junction of Wyss and the Artifi
cial Intelligence (i.e., computer)
Laboratory was explained by
Loren Rush, a worker at the
laboratory where research is
being done for the benefit of
composers and musicians. Work
has advanced to the point where
the sound of any musical in
strument can be duplicated by a
computer.
Computerized compositions
Thus, composers can now sit
down and compose at
computer-terminal keyboards.
Their compositions are limited,
however, to the more addition
and subtraction of sounds: The
problem of creating a phrase
comparable, say, to one of Jascha
Heifetz's is still to be solved.
Wyss confessed that he is still
a newcomer to artificial intellig
ence.
"I have trouble with the
signs," he commented some
what enigmatically.
Ruch indicated that Wyss was
referring to the intricacies of
computer programming,
mathematics and the physics of
sound waves.
"But I have a great interest in
this," Wyss continued. "It is
very important to my own
work."

Amid the bizarre scenery of
the Stanford Artificial Intellig
ence Laboratory, conductor Nik
laus Wyss unveiled some of the
entertainment that awaits listen
ers at this month's Mozart festi
val of the San Francisco Sym
phony.
The festival, similar to one last
year that explored the music of
the Bach family, will feature
works from every musical genre
in which Mozart wrote except
grand opera and the mass.
"From time to time one tries to
demonstrate a musical style or

With this impressive contingent
will be the improbably and in
famous P.n.Q. Bach — or Peter
Schickele, as he is known to
music historians.
Wyss and Schickele will col
laborate in what promises to be
the most unusual work offered in
the festival — "The Impresario,"
a kind of comic opera.
Because there are several
"original" texts of "The Impre
sario" to choose from, and be
cause the story of the harried
impresario (who must contend
with two jealous sopranos) is so
thoroughly at home in the mod
ern scene, it seemed appropriate
to call in Schickele to modernize
the text — and act as narrator.
"There is even one point at
which Peter has to sing," Wyss
noted with amusement.
Family helped
Wyss said that "The Impre
sario" is probably a "family af
fair," meaning that he suspects
some musical collusion — for

the sake of the sport — on the
part of Mozart's wife and sister.
"The Impresario" should not
be mistaken for minor Mozart,
however. Wyss noted that —
next to "The Magic Flute" — it
contains the most demanding (
and some of the most beautiful)
passages for the famale voice

that Mozart ever wrote.
VVyss, who spends his con
ducting time in Europe, Japan
and San Francisco, will also di
rect "Les Petits Riens," a ballet
that is a delightful succession of
brief vignettes, and the "Prague"
Symphony. (No. 38).
Festival tonight
Wyss's program will comprise
the third and last presented dur
ing the symphony's Mozart fes
tival. In separate programs Alex
ander Schneider and Christoph
Eschenbach will appear as con
ductors and soloists.

The first will play tonight at
the Flint Center (which Wyss de
scribes as acoustically "very
special") at I)e An/a College and
tomorrow at the Palace of Fine
Arts in San Francisco.
VVyss said that, from his point
of view at least, the future of
classical music is getting brigh
ter. He noted that each year he
has served as resident conductor
in San Francisco, audiences
have increased. He also men
tioned that the Japanese appetite
for classical music appeared lo
be insatiable.
The somewhat baffling con
junction of Wyss and the Artifi
cial Intelligence (i.e., computer)
Laboratory was explained by
Loren Rush, a worker at the
laboratory where research is
being done for the benefit of
composers and musicians. Work
has advanced to the point where
the sound of any musical in
strument can be duplicated by a
computer.
Computerized compositions
Thus, composers can now sit
down and compose at
computer-terminal keyboards.
Their compositions are limited,
however, to the more addition
and subtraction of sounds: The
problem of creating a phrase
comparable, say, to one of Jascha
Heifetz's is still to be solved.
Wyss confessed that he is still
a newcomer to artificial intellig
ence.
"I have trouble with the
signs," he commented some
what enigmatically.
Ruch indicated that Wyss was
referring to the intricacies of
computer programming,
mathematics and the physics of
sound waves.
"But I have a great interest in
this," Wyss continued. "It is
very important to my own
work."
