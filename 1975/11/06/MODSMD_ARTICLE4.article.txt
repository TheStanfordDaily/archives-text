The California Actors Theatre
production of Our Town will
touch and amuse almost
everyone. Thornton Wilder's
play, although not a theatrical
tour de force, is hard to dislike.
Its relaxed geniality quickly
wins over an audience.
The production at the Old
Town Theater in Los Gatos com
plements this piquant mood
with smooth staging, a
thoroughly professional cast,
and a brilliant, engaging per
formance by Sandy McCallum.
Wilder, one of the first Ameri
can playwrights to abandon the
conventional "fourth wall" in
favor of nonrealistic, presenta
tional drama, employs a stage
manager as a general commen
tator, philosopher and master of
ceremonies.
McCallum plays this surpris
ingly difficult role perfectly,
with marvelous timing and an
engaging, gentle tone.
The stage manager presides
over three unremarkable scenes
from Grover's Corners. New
Hampshire, in 1901, 1904 and
1913.
The action itself is gentle, al
most benign. Characters suffer,
but they do not plunge into exis
tential crises; no one is mur
dered; and no conflict develops
on stage.
Wilder does not question the
order of the cosmos. He simply
pushes people to feel more
deeply, to thrill to ordinary mo
ments in their lives.
"Our Town is an attempt to
find a value above all price for
the smallest events in our daily
life," he wrote.
This untraditional attitude
necessarily constrains charac
terization. The people onstage
reveal little more than would
neighbors or casual friends.
This places unusual demands
on the actors, who must sustain
interest in the Gibbs and Webb
families without much room to
maneuver.
Although the people playing
adolescent children have minor
trouble remaining in character,
thecompanv generally does well
in this deceptively difficult play.
