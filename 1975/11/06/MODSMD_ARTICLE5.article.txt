Enderby's End, or The Clock
work Testament, by Anthony
Burgess, Alfred A. Knopf. $5.95.
For many years Anthony
Burgess was a major novelist
with minor sales. A few of his
books had found small but ap
preciative audiences, but in
America at least an enthusiastic
fan had to look long and hard to
find copies of all his novels.
Practically overnight Burgess
achieved a mass audience when
Stanley Kubrick released his
stunningly successful film, A
Clockwork Orange. Burgess'
many previous novels were re
printed, and his new books re
ceived increased attention. He
even received the two greatest
honors a consumer culture can
bestow on a living author — un
iform paperback reprints and a

Ployboy interview.
Unfortunately the success
created by Kubrick's film had
serious drawbacks. The con
troversy raging over the film
soon involved the author.
Critics, who had never read a
word Burgess wrote, blamed
him for things in Kubrick's free
adaptation. Burgess' novel-of
ideas became distorted into a so
cial manifesto of sex and viol
ence, and the innocent, though
pugnacious author was held re
sponsible.
Enderby's End, or The Clock
work Testament is a fic
tionalized account of Burgess'
encounter with success in
America. For this new book
Burgess has resurrected his most
lovable creation, the dyspeptic
poet Enderby, who has appeared
in three of his best previous
novels.
Enderby's success story is a
brilliant parody of Burgess' own
rise to popular acclaim. The un
witting Enderby initially sug
gests the unlikely venture of
turning Gerard Manley Hopkins'
modernistic religious poem,
"The Wreck of the Deutsch
land," into a movie.

Eventually a movie does
emerge, but it bears only the re
motest relation to Hopkins'
pious meditation. Instead a
cinematic nightmare full of sex
and sadism a la Visconti ap
pears, highlighted by adolescent
Nazi Storm Troopers raping
nuns. Needless to say. the film
becomes a great box office and
artistic success.
The movie instantly achieves
what Enderby's years of dedi
cated writing never did — suc
cess. The impecunious poet is
invited to teach creative writing
at Columbia, and out of necessity
he accepts.
In New York the constitution
ally incompetent Englishman
must face the modern City of
Man at its worst.
NYC traumatizes
He braves the terrors of the Big
Apple in all their forms — noc
turnal subway rides, frozen
foods, and television talk shows.
He is interviewed by a Christ
ian lesbian newspaper, prop
ositioned by a student and exp
lained by a psychiatrist. An irate
reader even tries to murder the
well-meaning poet.
But these horrors shrink in

comparison to his greatest
ordeal: The poor Enderby must
teach creative writing twice a
week to the big city's most
dangerous inhabitants, under
graduate poets.
Outsider's view
Burgess satirizes New York
culture with striking success.
His position as a foreigner speak
ing a nearly common tongue al
lows Burgess to pick up all of the
revealing details an American
author might miss. His portraits
of pop intellectuals are espe
cially brilliant.
In many ways Enderby's End

deals New York the same comic
blow that Burgess' compatriot
Evelyn Waugh dealt with Los
Angeles in The Loved One.
Enderby's End is the latest bat
tle in the endless intellectual
war between England and
America. For the last 300
years these nations
have examined and attacked
each other's cultures with the
care and vengeance only close
relatives can muster. Some of the
most enjoyable novels in English
from Dickens' Martin Chuz
zlewit to Waugh's The Loved
One have come out of this war.
Enderby's End is certainly not
a great novel. The book has many
weaknesses both in structure
and characterization. Yet the
novel rises above its individual
shortcomings and succeeds as a
very cogent intellectual drama.
Enderby's End displays both
depth and clarity. Whatever his
faults, Burgess is not a novelist
to ignore.
