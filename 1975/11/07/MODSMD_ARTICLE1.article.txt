# Predicts no 'major' pollution
## Study examines Bonfire 
### JOHN FREED 
Pollution from the Big Game Bonfire
will not be "of sufficient magnitude to
be a major factor" in determining
whether to hold the event this year, the
University Committee on Ecosystems
Management reported yesterday.
The report was hailed as a "break
through" by Bill Christopher, chair
man of the Bonfire Committee of the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC).
"We've heard from other organiza
tions that the pollution wasn't that
much. This is something . . . we've
been hoping for," Christopher said.
The ASSU Senate will vote Monday
on a "sense of the senate" resolution
regarding the Bonfire.

All five members of the ecosystems
committee, part of the University
Committee on Safety and Health, en
dorsed the one-paragraph statement
on the Bonfire.
Statement discounted
• Bonfire opponents discounted the
importance of the statement. ASSU
President Lee Rosenbaum explained
why.
"The environmental impact of the
fire certairdy is not major when com
pared to other forms of pollution in the
Bay Area, but it symbolizes a lack of
respect or concern of a greater mag
nitude about the world outside."
Rosenbaum said.
The ASSU Senate Council of Presi

dents has endorsed an alternate prop
osal, in which a bonfire one-tenth the
size of previous blazes would be held
in conjunction with a campus-wide
dance.
"I think to continue the Bonfire in its
current size is a flagrant disregard — or
sort of an extravagant display of our
lack of concern," Rosenbaum added.
Pharmacology Prof. Sumner Kal
man, chairman of the University
committee, said the committee re
ceived information from both Rosen
baum and the Bay Area Air Pollution
Control District.
Rough numbers' '
"I talked to a man from the district,
and he gave me some rough numbers
as to the amount of smog involved,"
Kalman said. "It was the sense of the
committee members that they did not
believe this would have enough of an
effect to (halt) the Bonfire."
Christopher predicted that opposi
tion in the senate — especially by
members of the ST AND slate — would
vanish because of the committee's re
port.
The senators "say we're not doing
anything to help the environment,"

Members of the American Association of University Pro
fessors called for various reforms.
Christopher alleged. "But 1 don't see
how even they (STAND members) can
vote against it now."
Two STAND slate members con
tacted last night gave several possible
reasons for opposition.
"It is very sad that the thing which
can bring the community together —
and this is supposed to be a creative
community — is to burn a pile of
junk," said Sarah Alfadl. a slate
member.
"I'm sureif thelFC promises toclean
up the lake, they will," Alfadl com
mented. "But there is nothing that can
be done about the ashes.. .. The ashes
which come down later (when the lake
fills) make it a considerably disgusting
concept for those who want to use the
lake."
Alfadl emphasized that her opinions
were not necessarily held by all mem
bers of her slate.

Members of the American Association of University Pro
fessors called for various reforms.
Christopher alleged. "But 1 don't see
how even they (STAND members) can
vote against it now."
Two STAND slate members con
tacted last night gave several possible
reasons for opposition.
"It is very sad that the thing which
can bring the community together —
and this is supposed to be a creative
community — is to burn a pile of
junk," said Sarah Alfadl. a slate
member.
"I'm sureif thelFC promises toclean
up the lake, they will," Alfadl com
mented. "But there is nothing that can
be done about the ashes.. .. The ashes
which come down later (when the lake
fills) make it a considerably disgusting
concept for those who want to use the
lake."
Alfadl emphasized that her opinions
were not necessarily held by all mem
bers of her slate.
Pollution from the Big Game Bonfire
will not be "of sufficient magnitude to
be a major factor" in determining
whether to hold the event this year, the
University Committee on Ecosystems
Management reported yesterday.
The report was hailed as a "break
through" by Bill Christopher, chair
man of the Bonfire Committee of the
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC).
"We've heard from other organiza
tions that the pollution wasn't that
much. This is something . . . we've
been hoping for," Christopher said.
The ASSU Senate will vote Monday
on a "sense of the senate" resolution
regarding the Bonfire.

All five members of the ecosystems
committee, part of the University
Committee on Safety and Health, en
dorsed the one-paragraph statement
on the Bonfire.
Statement discounted
• Bonfire opponents discounted the
importance of the statement. ASSU
President Lee Rosenbaum explained
why.
"The environmental impact of the
fire certairdy is not major when com
pared to other forms of pollution in the
Bay Area, but it symbolizes a lack of
respect or concern of a greater mag
nitude about the world outside."
Rosenbaum said.
The ASSU Senate Council of Presi

dents has endorsed an alternate prop
osal, in which a bonfire one-tenth the
size of previous blazes would be held
in conjunction with a campus-wide
dance.
"I think to continue the Bonfire in its
current size is a flagrant disregard — or
sort of an extravagant display of our
lack of concern," Rosenbaum added.
Pharmacology Prof. Sumner Kal
man, chairman of the University
committee, said the committee re
ceived information from both Rosen
baum and the Bay Area Air Pollution
Control District.
Rough numbers' '
"I talked to a man from the district,
and he gave me some rough numbers
as to the amount of smog involved,"
Kalman said. "It was the sense of the
committee members that they did not
believe this would have enough of an
effect to (halt) the Bonfire."
Christopher predicted that opposi
tion in the senate — especially by
members of the ST AND slate — would
