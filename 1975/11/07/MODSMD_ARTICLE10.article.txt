Decisive senate

Editor:
Jim Gaughran's Nov. 5
Daily letter about the ASSU Se
nate was unfair and scurrilous.
The senate was not indecisive; it
chose not to decide and for very
good reasons.
Perhaps the strongest
rationale for the senate's action
lies in Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyon's letter, which re
quested an expression of student
opinion from the senate by Nov.
11. The next senate meeting on
Nov. 10 will allow for this.
Furthermore, there was only
one copy of the bonfire resolu
tion at the last meeting. A week's
delay will enable all senators
and the news media to get
copies.
Although some were aware
that the senate would act on the
bonfire issue, it was quite
reasonably suggested that a
week's delay would allow more
people to be informed and ex
press their opinion.
Finally, the hour was late
when the bonfire resolution was
introduced and nearly all felt
that a more orderly and deliber
ate discussion could occur the
following week.
Under the circumstances, 1
think the senate acted quite re
sponsibly.

Chairman, ASSU Senate
New mascot
Editor:
Stephen Carter, in his Nov. 5
Daily column, is right.
If the Indian is offensive to
some as a mascot, we should try
to understand their feelings
rather than cramming the name
down their throats.
And if we are so desperately in
need of school spirit, why not
think up a new mascot.
