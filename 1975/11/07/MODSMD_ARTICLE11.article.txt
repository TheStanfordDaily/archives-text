Michael Roberts' Nov. 5 Daily column is so
absurd and inaccurate, yet so insulting, that on
first impression one can only believe that it was
written by a USC band member using a fake ad
dress in Palo Alto.
Yet. upon reflection, 1 think Roberts' consti
pated "world view" is more prevalent than many
Band members would like to admit and deserves
some comment.
The Band, like the football team, is not perfect;
no one person in the Band has the power to stop
another misguided individual from yelling
statements like "kill Cordova." One of the very
human aspects of the Band is that it allows its
members thefreedom to be frustrated at the team's
progress like anyone else in the stadium.
But to say that the Band is frustrated hardly
explains the situation.
Each Band member devotes a minimum of six
hours during the week and all day Saturday to his
playing. He also spends innumerable extra hours
fund raising at rallies because the University does
not see fit to provide the Band with operating
expenses.
Two points seem apparent. First, Band mem
bers like some return on their investment; they
want the team to win as much as anyone else.
Roberts doesn't seem to realize that practicing

David Lewis

for self-gratification can wear out an organization.
No one with less than a real interest in the team
would spend so much time mangling his grade
point average.
Secondly, the fact that the Band's funds are
provided by the students and other benefactors
means that we are first responsible to these people
when we plan our shows. I don't think Roberts has
talked to many students lately, but 1 believe the
fact that the students stand and cheer for the Band
as it enters the stadium indicates at least some
agreement with our management's policies.
The Band cannot help the fact that Roberts and
people like him cannot appreciate the thoroughly
satirical nature of the Band's shows. We are not
living in Waterloo, lowa.
What disturbs me most about the article,
though, is Roberts' very use of the language he
deplores: "The band is a monster and it should be
killed now."
Kill Cordova? Kill the Band? How ridiculous.
Until Roberts can summon the courage to peson
ally confront those persons in charge of the Band
(they don't bite, at least not in the usual way), the
Band will continue to provide its crwn distinctive
brand of entertainment.
(David Lewis , u senior in political science, is a
member of the Stanford Band.)
