# Can the budget be tightened any more
## Cost cuts imperil overseas study 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
"Programs may come and programs may go,
but where the overseas budget ax will fall, no
body knows." Such seems the refrain of ad
ministrators involved in the complex process
of deciding how to implement a proposed 50
percent cut in that part of the overseas budget
paid from University Ceneral Funds.
Provost Miller gave that approximate figure
last winter as a target to be reached by Sep
tember 1978. Presently about $1.5 million of
the total budget of $2 million is paid from Cen
eral Funds, the remainder shelled out by par
ticipants for room, board and fees.
The overseas budget was reduced by some
$200,000 this year, according to Assoc. Over
seas Studies Director Don Price. "Another
$100,000 in this year's budget can be readily
eliminated and will not recur for next year,"
Price added, citing retirements and one-time
capital expenses. This year's savings resulted
primarily from three moves.
Flight to the country
The Tours program moved from a country
facility to University of Tours dormitories,
with classes held in a large house. Vienna
made a similar move, using subsidized apart
ments for classes. And Beutelsbach also fol
lowed suit, by moving from the Weinstadt
countryside to city facilities, rented at sub
market rates from the community.
All moves resulted in sharp cuts in places for
Stanford students. Both Vienna and Beutels
bach cut their places from about 80 to 35, and
Tours spaces dropped from 80 to 50.
A long way remains to the total budget re
duction of $800,000 (in 1974 dollars) Miller
requested. Price said that campus closings are
"practically inevitable."

"It seems quite likely that some campus or
campuses somewhere will have to be closed,"
stated Education Prof. James March, chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Study Programs
(C-FSP). The C-FSP, an 11-member student
faculty committee, has responsibility for re
commending how the overseas monies should
be appropriated along with the Overseas Office
staff. It will probably report to the Faculty Se
nate and Provost on the budget cuts later this
fall.
Which campuses might be dropped is still
very much open, say the administrators. March
noted that bis committee has set an ideal
guideline of one program minimum in each
language area.
As four out of the nine programs — Bonn,
Berlin, Beutelsbach and Vienna — are in
Cerman-language areas, a cut there seems a
very strong possibility.
Administration cut, too
Overall student participation in overseas
campuses has increased 9.3 percent this year.
Price said that the increased number of stu
dents are being accomodated by a smaller ad
ministrative staff. The Tours program no
longer has a full-time director, and the
Beutelsbach program has a director only three
quarters out of the year. Vienna has never had a
full-time director.
While moves to cheaper city facilities from
the countryside have been a major cost-cutting
device, Overseas Studies Director Mark Man
call recently said he did not foresee furher
moves in this direction. Only Florence and
Cliveden remain outside cities.
Cliveden is based on the former Lord Astor's
estate and is subsidized by the British National

Trust. Florence is "low-cost, relatively speak
ing," according to Price.
Gifts from expatriates
In order to broaden the funding base, Price
said, gifts are being solicited from overseas
campus alumni and American businesses in
Europe. Stanford alumni now living in Europe
proved to be a poor source of funds, so he is
now checking out the prospect of fund-raising
from overseas alumni residing in the U.S.
In soliciting from overseas businesses he had
"some modest success, but it's not what I'd call
substantial.* We're not counting on any
gifts."
Much future action hinges on the ever
fluctuating dollar exchange rates. "They just
go up and down, and there's just no telling.
There has been some improvement since last
spring," Price said.
Price is due to issue a financial report to the
C-FSP later this month. March said his com
mittee cannot begin to really weigh specific
alternatives until he receives some "reasonable
cost figures."
The committee met with overseas directors
last week to get some administrative informa
tion.
"They were helpful in that they gave a lot of
information from the administrative side and
actually talked about possibilities of improv
ing their programs," Randy Dergerac, a student
on C-FSP, said.
Bergeracsaid he hopes the committee will be
able to sponsor a meeting of former overseas
students. He would also like to send out a ques
tionnaire to current overseas students.
One of the biggest problems in evaluating
the overseas programs, Burgerac noted, is just
that — they are overseas. "

inside these walls students worry about how cuts in the overseas programs will affect their
campus.

Cerman-language areas, a cut there seems a
very strong possibility.
Administration cut, too
Overall student participation in overseas
campuses has increased 9.3 percent this year.
Price said that the increased number of stu
dents are being accomodated by a smaller ad
ministrative staff. The Tours program no
longer has a full-time director, and the
Beutelsbach program has a director only three
quarters out of the year. Vienna has never had a
full-time director.
While moves to cheaper city facilities from
the countryside have been a major cost-cutting
device, Overseas Studies Director Mark Man
call recently said he did not foresee furher
moves in this direction. Only Florence and
Cliveden remain outside cities.
Cliveden is based on the former Lord Astor's
estate and is subsidized by the British National

Trust. Florence is "low-cost, relatively speak
ing," according to Price.
Gifts from expatriates
In order to broaden the funding base, Price
said, gifts are being solicited from overseas
campus alumni and American businesses in
Europe. Stanford alumni now living in Europe
proved to be a poor source of funds, so he is
now checking out the prospect of fund-raising
from overseas alumni residing in the U.S.
In soliciting from overseas businesses he had
"some modest success, but it's not what I'd call
substantial.* We're not counting on any
gifts."
Much future action hinges on the ever
fluctuating dollar exchange rates. "They just
go up and down, and there's just no telling.
There has been some improvement since last
spring," Price said.
Price is due to issue a financial report to the
C-FSP later this month. March said his com
mittee cannot begin to really weigh specific
alternatives until he receives some "reasonable
cost figures."
The committee met with overseas directors
last week to get some administrative informa
tion.
"They were helpful in that they gave a lot of
information from the administrative side and
actually talked about possibilities of improv
ing their programs," Randy Dergerac, a student
on C-FSP, said.
Bergeracsaid he hopes the committee will be
able to sponsor a meeting of former overseas
students. He would also like to send out a ques
tionnaire to current overseas students.
One of the biggest problems in evaluating
the overseas programs, Burgerac noted, is just
that — they are overseas. "


MONEY CRISIS—The Stanford campus in Beutelsbach, Germany appears peaceful, but
inside these walls students worry about how cuts in the overseas programs will affect their
campus.
"Programs may come and programs may go,
but where the overseas budget ax will fall, no
body knows." Such seems the refrain of ad
ministrators involved in the complex process
of deciding how to implement a proposed 50
percent cut in that part of the overseas budget
paid from University Ceneral Funds.
Provost Miller gave that approximate figure
last winter as a target to be reached by Sep
tember 1978. Presently about $1.5 million of
the total budget of $2 million is paid from Cen
eral Funds, the remainder shelled out by par
ticipants for room, board and fees.
The overseas budget was reduced by some
$200,000 this year, according to Assoc. Over
seas Studies Director Don Price. "Another
$100,000 in this year's budget can be readily
eliminated and will not recur for next year,"
Price added, citing retirements and one-time
capital expenses. This year's savings resulted
primarily from three moves.
Flight to the country
The Tours program moved from a country
facility to University of Tours dormitories,
with classes held in a large house. Vienna
made a similar move, using subsidized apart
ments for classes. And Beutelsbach also fol
lowed suit, by moving from the Weinstadt
countryside to city facilities, rented at sub
market rates from the community.
All moves resulted in sharp cuts in places for
Stanford students. Both Vienna and Beutels
bach cut their places from about 80 to 35, and
Tours spaces dropped from 80 to 50.
A long way remains to the total budget re
duction of $800,000 (in 1974 dollars) Miller
requested. Price said that campus closings are
"practically inevitable."

"It seems quite likely that some campus or
campuses somewhere will have to be closed,"
stated Education Prof. James March, chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Study Programs
(C-FSP). The C-FSP, an 11-member student
faculty committee, has responsibility for re
commending how the overseas monies should
be appropriated along with the Overseas Office
staff. It will probably report to the Faculty Se
nate and Provost on the budget cuts later this
fall.
Which campuses might be dropped is still
very much open, say the administrators. March
noted that bis committee has set an ideal
guideline of one program minimum in each
language area.

campus.
"Programs may come and programs may go,
but where the overseas budget ax will fall, no
body knows." Such seems the refrain of ad
ministrators involved in the complex process
of deciding how to implement a proposed 50
percent cut in that part of the overseas budget
paid from University Ceneral Funds.
Provost Miller gave that approximate figure
last winter as a target to be reached by Sep
tember 1978. Presently about $1.5 million of
the total budget of $2 million is paid from Cen
eral Funds, the remainder shelled out by par
ticipants for room, board and fees.
The overseas budget was reduced by some
$200,000 this year, according to Assoc. Over
seas Studies Director Don Price. "Another
$100,000 in this year's budget can be readily
eliminated and will not recur for next year,"
Price added, citing retirements and one-time
capital expenses. This year's savings resulted
primarily from three moves.
Flight to the country
The Tours program moved from a country
facility to University of Tours dormitories,
with classes held in a large house. Vienna
made a similar move, using subsidized apart
ments for classes. And Beutelsbach also fol
lowed suit, by moving from the Weinstadt
countryside to city facilities, rented at sub
market rates from the community.
All moves resulted in sharp cuts in places for
Stanford students. Both Vienna and Beutels
bach cut their places from about 80 to 35, and
Tours spaces dropped from 80 to 50.
A long way remains to the total budget re
duction of $800,000 (in 1974 dollars) Miller
requested. Price said that campus closings are
"practically inevitable."

"It seems quite likely that some campus or
campuses somewhere will have to be closed,"
stated Education Prof. James March, chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Study Programs
(C-FSP). The C-FSP, an 11-member student
faculty committee, has responsibility for re
commending how the overseas monies should
be appropriated along with the Overseas Office
staff. It will probably report to the Faculty Se
nate and Provost on the budget cuts later this
fall.
Which campuses might be dropped is still
very much open, say the administrators. March
noted that bis committee has set an ideal
guideline of one program minimum in each
language area.
As four out of the nine programs — Bonn,
Berlin, Beutelsbach and Vienna — are in
Cerman-language areas, a cut there seems a
very strong possibility.
Administration cut, too
Overall student participation in overseas
campuses has increased 9.3 percent this year.
Price said that the increased number of stu
dents are being accomodated by a smaller ad
ministrative staff. The Tours program no
longer has a full-time director, and the
Beutelsbach program has a director only three
quarters out of the year. Vienna has never had a
full-time director.
While moves to cheaper city facilities from
the countryside have been a major cost-cutting
device, Overseas Studies Director Mark Man
call recently said he did not foresee furher
moves in this direction. Only Florence and
Cliveden remain outside cities.
Cliveden is based on the former Lord Astor's
estate and is subsidized by the British National

Trust. Florence is "low-cost, relatively speak
ing," according to Price.
Gifts from expatriates
In order to broaden the funding base, Price
said, gifts are being solicited from overseas
campus alumni and American businesses in
Europe. Stanford alumni now living in Europe
proved to be a poor source of funds, so he is
now checking out the prospect of fund-raising
from overseas alumni residing in the U.S.
In soliciting from overseas businesses he had
"some modest success, but it's not what I'd call
substantial.* We're not counting on any
gifts."
Much future action hinges on the ever
fluctuating dollar exchange rates. "They just
go up and down, and there's just no telling.
There has been some improvement since last
spring," Price said.
Price is due to issue a financial report to the
C-FSP later this month. March said his com
mittee cannot begin to really weigh specific
alternatives until he receives some "reasonable
cost figures."
The committee met with overseas directors
last week to get some administrative informa
tion.
"They were helpful in that they gave a lot of
information from the administrative side and
actually talked about possibilities of improv
ing their programs," Randy Dergerac, a student
on C-FSP, said.
Bergeracsaid he hopes the committee will be
able to sponsor a meeting of former overseas
students. He would also like to send out a ques
tionnaire to current overseas students.
One of the biggest problems in evaluating
the overseas programs, Burgerac noted, is just
that — they are overseas. "
