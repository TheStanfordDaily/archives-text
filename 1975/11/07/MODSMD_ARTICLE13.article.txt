# Bonfire ignites (another) quarrel
## 
### STEPHEN CROILUS 
Seldom have so many had so much to say
about so little.
As in past years, the Big Game Rally Bonfire
is the subject of intense controversy. But this
year, more groups than ever have emerged to
take a stand on the Bonfire, scheduled for Nov.
21.
One segment of opinion maintains that the
Bonfire should go on as planned. The most
active proponents of this course are the mem
bers of the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), the
contemporary organizers of the Bonfire.
They contend that the Bonfire is one of the
few remaining traditions at Stanford that bring
the whole University community together: the
faculty, the undergraduates, the graduate stu
dents and the alumni.
IFC President Bob Ottilie has said that "it is
the only tradition that we have left that brings
so many people together... I would say close
to a thousand people participate out in the lake
bed just building it — that's almost more peo
ple than vote for the ASSU Senate."
The IFC also asserts that it is too late to
change the Bonfire this year. "The time for
alternatives was about four weeks ago," Ottilie

said a week ago.
Another segment of opinion says the Bonfire
should be dispensed with altogether. These
people are not united around any one person or
organization, but they do exist, as can be ascer
tained by listening to any informal discussion
about the Bonfire.
The third segment of opinion believes that
the Bonfire should be allowed to take place, but
on a reduced scale. The ASSU has advocated
this course since September.
The reason given in behalf of this latter
course is that it is a compromise between the
first two. The ASSU and other proponents of
compromise admit that it would hurt the Uni
versity to lose the tradition of the Bonfire, but
they contend that the University should show
some responsibility for the environment.
Jim Barstow, a member of the Stanford Con
servative group, noted that he would feel a lot
better going out and looking at a much smaller
Bonfire and feeling that I'd acted in a manner
that 1 felt was responsible.
A newcomer to the dispute, the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District is a body consist
ing of two representatives from each of the nine
counties of the Bav Area, with a staff of en

forcement officials. The representatives, com
prising a board, are elected officials, typically
mayors or aldermen, whose decisions about air
pollution and related matters are law in the
nine member counties.
The aspect of the issue that has caused the
most controversy is the question of how much
pollution the Bonfire actually causes.
One investigation was done by the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District. Its estimate of
the weight of the Bonfire is 200-300 tons.
But the Pollution Control district, the IFC,
and ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum agree that
whether the Bonfire releases one tenth or three
times as much pollution as is generated dailyat
San Francisco Airport is of relatively minor
importance.
Thomas Massey. assistant dean of students
said, "I've been convinced by talking to the
Pollution Control District that this thing (the
Bonfire) is not a big polluter; it's a symbolic
polluter."
But despite protests, there is every indication
that the Bonfire will burn as planned on Big
Came weekend.
And next year at this time, the controversy
about the Bonfire will probably flare up again.

FLAMING CONTROVERSY — The annual Bonfire has ignited yet another controversy this
year between rousers of Big Game spirit and environmentalists. But the Bonfire seems
destined to proceed on schedule on Nov. 21.
Seldom have so many had so much to say
about so little.
As in past years, the Big Game Rally Bonfire
is the subject of intense controversy. But this
year, more groups than ever have emerged to
take a stand on the Bonfire, scheduled for Nov.
21.
One segment of opinion maintains that the
Bonfire should go on as planned. The most
active proponents of this course are the mem
bers of the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), the
contemporary organizers of the Bonfire.
They contend that the Bonfire is one of the
few remaining traditions at Stanford that bring
the whole University community together: the
faculty, the undergraduates, the graduate stu
dents and the alumni.
IFC President Bob Ottilie has said that "it is
the only tradition that we have left that brings
so many people together... I would say close
to a thousand people participate out in the lake
bed just building it — that's almost more peo
ple than vote for the ASSU Senate."
The IFC also asserts that it is too late to
change the Bonfire this year. "The time for
alternatives was about four weeks ago," Ottilie

said a week ago.
Another segment of opinion says the Bonfire
should be dispensed with altogether. These
people are not united around any one person or
organization, but they do exist, as can be ascer
tained by listening to any informal discussion
about the Bonfire.
The third segment of opinion believes that
the Bonfire should be allowed to take place, but
on a reduced scale. The ASSU has advocated
this course since September.
The reason given in behalf of this latter
course is that it is a compromise between the
first two. The ASSU and other proponents of
compromise admit that it would hurt the Uni
versity to lose the tradition of the Bonfire, but
they contend that the University should show
some responsibility for the environment.
Jim Barstow, a member of the Stanford Con
servative group, noted that he would feel a lot
better going out and looking at a much smaller
Bonfire and feeling that I'd acted in a manner
that 1 felt was responsible.
A newcomer to the dispute, the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District is a body consist
ing of two representatives from each of the nine
counties of the Bav Area, with a staff of en

forcement officials. The representatives, com
prising a board, are elected officials, typically
mayors or aldermen, whose decisions about air
pollution and related matters are law in the
nine member counties.
The aspect of the issue that has caused the
most controversy is the question of how much
pollution the Bonfire actually causes.
One investigation was done by the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District. Its estimate of
the weight of the Bonfire is 200-300 tons.
But the Pollution Control district, the IFC,
and ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum agree that
whether the Bonfire releases one tenth or three
times as much pollution as is generated dailyat
San Francisco Airport is of relatively minor
importance.
Thomas Massey. assistant dean of students
said, "I've been convinced by talking to the
Pollution Control District that this thing (the
Bonfire) is not a big polluter; it's a symbolic
polluter."
But despite protests, there is every indication
that the Bonfire will burn as planned on Big
Came weekend.
And next year at this time, the controversy
about the Bonfire will probably flare up again.
