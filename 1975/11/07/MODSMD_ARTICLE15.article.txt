## Bender Room: Western culture tucked in a corner 
### GEOFF SAMUELS 
Tucked away on the seventh
floor of the Main Library is the
autographed manuscript of
Bach's "Suite in F Major." It is
enclosed in a large oaken chest,
which itself is hidden in the
Bender Room.
The Bender Room and its
stacks contain most of the rare
books , prints and manuscripts
in the University's possession. It
consists of several donated
manuscript and reference and
rare book collections.
The collections are not to be
confused with museum exhibits.
They are to be used for research.
Chief of Special Collections
Florian Shasky says that the col
lections are available for "any
serious student, scholar, or qual
ified person with reasonable
demands." All of which adds up
to an invitation to use the mater
ials .for papers of various sizes
and subjects.
It is perfectly acceptable if
someone only wishes to view a
work although there are limits.
The first edition of Newton's
Principia Mathematica is not
available for casual reading.
However, if one doesn't qualify
forstudying works, it is certainly
possible to qualify as a member
of the public, 4600 of whom
paraded through last year view
ing exhibits on such diverse sub
jects as Max Beerbohm, John
Steinbeck, incunabulum and
fine bindings.
Semblance of order
The stacks are closed, not out
of any desire to conceal skele
tons. but solely due to rarity, exp

lains Shasky. The books and
manuscripts are arranged such
that browsing would destroy anv
semblance of order, a policy
which underscores the inherent
research direction of the collec
tion.
Previously donated collec
tions include the Gunst Memor
ial Library of the Book Arts, the
Felton collection of English and
American literature the
Brasch-Newton collection, the
Memorial Library of. Music, the
Robinson collection of Ameri
can History and Government,
and the Hopkins Memorial Lib
rary.
In order to give a conception of
the size of the holdings, it should
be realized the rare book, man
uscript and reference collections
include over 60,000 volumes,
along with more than one-half
million manuscripts.
The Felton collection of En
glish and American literature is
one of the largest of the dona
tions. Designed to produce a
broad and comprehensive col
lection of 19th and 20th century
literature, it contains many fine
editions of the works of major
authors, along with numerous
examples of obscure to negligi
ble writers. Many rare first edi
tions have been inscribed by the
authors.
Foreign authors
Foreign authors include
Galsworthy, D.H. Lawrence,
Meredith. Scott and Trollop. An
interesting set of Dickens' works
includes a steel ingraving used
to produce a frontispiece illust

ration in one of the books.
One of the most rare acquisi
tions is the first edition of
Newton's Principia
Mathematica in the Brasch col
lection on Newton and the His
tory of Scientific Thought. The
collection traces the develop
ment of scientific concepts
through the accumulation of
roughly 4000 volumes, manus
cripts written by Newton, Halley
and Einstein.
It is exceptional enough to be
able to refer to first editions, but
it is outstanding when it is pos
sible to consult the autographed
manuscript itself. Such is the
case in the Memorial Library of
Music. Aside from first editions,
it contains manuscripts for
Brahm's "Tragic Overture,"
Cherubini's opera "Medee,"
BachV'Suite in F Major"and a
tenor aria from Handel's "Mes
siah."
In the extensive manuscript
collections are letters and liter
ary manuscripts by Jack London,
John Galsworthy, Somerset
Maugham, Ambrose Bierce and
D.H. Lawrence and papers from
farm labor organizer Ernesto
Galarza, Civil War General
E.O.C. Ord and the diplomat
Francis B. Loomis.
Marvelous collection
Most who have read
Steinbeck's Cannery Row have
felt a desire to go to Monterey
and see the remnants of the Row.
But for those who are interested
in the book, the University has
recently received a marvelous
collection, showing the forma
tion of the book from its concep

tion with the holograph manus
cript, through the galley proofs,
the proof copy and finally the
first edition.
Senior Library Specialist Os
walda Deva comments that aside

from the research value, the
room represents the apprecia
tion of a tradition. Glancing
about the room, it is difficult to
suppress the belief that Western
culture has been trapped and
compressed into bookshelves.

LADY CHATTERLEY'S AUTHOR—The Bender Room contains
several literary collections, including works by D.H. Lawrence.
The above letter was written bv Lawrence concerning the con
troversy surrounding his novel, "Ladv Chatterley's Lover." It
reads: "Dear Mrs Chambers 1 am sending you back your two
cheques of $20 each. It is useless trying to post 'Lady C.' to U.S.A.
— all held up — & dead loss. I'm so glad you got your two copies I
am furious at the fuss made over there in U.S.A. — even worse in
St. Louis & San Francisco & Santa Fe than in New York. My God —
don't people know what's natural & what isn't? VVe leave here next
Monday for Badenßaden. I shan't dare send my pictures to New
York now — they'd be confiscated too. What hypocrites! D.H.

Marvelous collection
Most who have read
Steinbeck's Cannery Row have
felt a desire to go to Monterey
and see the remnants of the Row.
But for those who are interested
in the book, the University has
recently received a marvelous
collection, showing the forma
tion of the book from its concep

tion with the holograph manus
cript, through the galley proofs,
the proof copy and finally the
first edition.

LADY CHATTERLEY'S AUTHOR—The Bender Room contains
several literary collections, including works by D.H. Lawrence.
The above letter was written bv Lawrence concerning the con
troversy surrounding his novel, "Ladv Chatterley's Lover." It
reads: "Dear Mrs Chambers 1 am sending you back your two
cheques of $20 each. It is useless trying to post 'Lady C.' to U.S.A.
— all held up — & dead loss. I'm so glad you got your two copies I
am furious at the fuss made over there in U.S.A. — even worse in
St. Louis & San Francisco & Santa Fe than in New York. My God —
don't people know what's natural & what isn't? VVe leave here next
Monday for Badenßaden. I shan't dare send my pictures to New
York now — they'd be confiscated too. What hypocrites! D.H.

PRIMITIVE PRESS—The Bender Room Press is one of the many
artifacts found in the Bender Room. Collections in the Room range
from manuscripts to priceless books.
Tucked away on the seventh
floor of the Main Library is the
autographed manuscript of
Bach's "Suite in F Major." It is
enclosed in a large oaken chest,
which itself is hidden in the
Bender Room.
The Bender Room and its
stacks contain most of the rare
books , prints and manuscripts
in the University's possession. It
consists of several donated
manuscript and reference and
rare book collections.
The collections are not to be
confused with museum exhibits.
They are to be used for research.
Chief of Special Collections
Florian Shasky says that the col
lections are available for "any
serious student, scholar, or qual
ified person with reasonable
demands." All of which adds up
to an invitation to use the mater
ials .for papers of various sizes
and subjects.
It is perfectly acceptable if
someone only wishes to view a
work although there are limits.
The first edition of Newton's
Principia Mathematica is not
available for casual reading.
However, if one doesn't qualify
forstudying works, it is certainly
possible to qualify as a member
of the public, 4600 of whom
paraded through last year view
ing exhibits on such diverse sub
jects as Max Beerbohm, John
Steinbeck, incunabulum and
fine bindings.
Semblance of order
The stacks are closed, not out
of any desire to conceal skele
tons. but solely due to rarity, exp

lains Shasky. The books and
manuscripts are arranged such
that browsing would destroy anv
semblance of order, a policy
which underscores the inherent
research direction of the collec
tion.
Previously donated collec
tions include the Gunst Memor
ial Library of the Book Arts, the
Felton collection of English and
American literature the
Brasch-Newton collection, the
Memorial Library of. Music, the
Robinson collection of Ameri
can History and Government,
and the Hopkins Memorial Lib
rary.
In order to give a conception of
the size of the holdings, it should
be realized the rare book, man
uscript and reference collections
include over 60,000 volumes,
along with more than one-half
million manuscripts.
The Felton collection of En
glish and American literature is
one of the largest of the dona
tions. Designed to produce a
broad and comprehensive col
lection of 19th and 20th century
literature, it contains many fine
editions of the works of major
authors, along with numerous
examples of obscure to negligi
ble writers. Many rare first edi
tions have been inscribed by the
authors.
Foreign authors
Foreign authors include
Galsworthy, D.H. Lawrence,
Meredith. Scott and Trollop. An
interesting set of Dickens' works
includes a steel ingraving used
to produce a frontispiece illust

Bach's "Suite in F Major." It is
enclosed in a large oaken chest,
which itself is hidden in the
Bender Room.
The Bender Room and its
stacks contain most of the rare
books , prints and manuscripts
in the University's possession. It
consists of several donated
manuscript and reference and
rare book collections.
The collections are not to be
confused with museum exhibits.
They are to be used for research.
Chief of Special Collections
Florian Shasky says that the col
lections are available for "any
serious student, scholar, or qual
ified person with reasonable
demands." All of which adds up
to an invitation to use the mater
ials .for papers of various sizes
and subjects.
It is perfectly acceptable if
someone only wishes to view a
work although there are limits.
The first edition of Newton's
Principia Mathematica is not
available for casual reading.
However, if one doesn't qualify
forstudying works, it is certainly
possible to qualify as a member
of the public, 4600 of whom
paraded through last year view
ing exhibits on such diverse sub
jects as Max Beerbohm, John
Steinbeck, incunabulum and
fine bindings.
Semblance of order
The stacks are closed, not out
of any desire to conceal skele
tons. but solely due to rarity, exp

lains Shasky. The books and
manuscripts are arranged such
that browsing would destroy anv
semblance of order, a policy
which underscores the inherent
research direction of the collec
tion.
Previously donated collec
tions include the Gunst Memor
ial Library of the Book Arts, the
Felton collection of English and
American literature the
Brasch-Newton collection, the
Memorial Library of. Music, the
Robinson collection of Ameri
can History and Government,
and the Hopkins Memorial Lib
rary.
In order to give a conception of
the size of the holdings, it should
be realized the rare book, man
uscript and reference collections
include over 60,000 volumes,
along with more than one-half
million manuscripts.
The Felton collection of En
glish and American literature is
one of the largest of the dona
tions. Designed to produce a
broad and comprehensive col
lection of 19th and 20th century
literature, it contains many fine
editions of the works of major
authors, along with numerous
examples of obscure to negligi
ble writers. Many rare first edi
tions have been inscribed by the
authors.
Foreign authors
Foreign authors include
Galsworthy, D.H. Lawrence,
Meredith. Scott and Trollop. An
interesting set of Dickens' works
includes a steel ingraving used
to produce a frontispiece illust

ration in one of the books.
One of the most rare acquisi
tions is the first edition of
Newton's Principia
Mathematica in the Brasch col
lection on Newton and the His
tory of Scientific Thought. The
collection traces the develop
ment of scientific concepts
through the accumulation of
roughly 4000 volumes, manus
cripts written by Newton, Halley
and Einstein.
It is exceptional enough to be
able to refer to first editions, but
it is outstanding when it is pos
sible to consult the autographed
manuscript itself. Such is the
case in the Memorial Library of
Music. Aside from first editions,
it contains manuscripts for
Brahm's "Tragic Overture,"
Cherubini's opera "Medee,"
BachV'Suite in F Major"and a
tenor aria from Handel's "Mes
siah."
In the extensive manuscript
collections are letters and liter
ary manuscripts by Jack London,
John Galsworthy, Somerset
Maugham, Ambrose Bierce and
D.H. Lawrence and papers from
farm labor organizer Ernesto
Galarza, Civil War General
E.O.C. Ord and the diplomat
Francis B. Loomis.
Marvelous collection
Most who have read
Steinbeck's Cannery Row have
felt a desire to go to Monterey
and see the remnants of the Row.
But for those who are interested
in the book, the University has
recently received a marvelous
collection, showing the forma
tion of the book from its concep

tion with the holograph manus
cript, through the galley proofs,
the proof copy and finally the
first edition.
Senior Library Specialist Os
walda Deva comments that aside

from the research value, the
room represents the apprecia
tion of a tradition. Glancing
about the room, it is difficult to
suppress the belief that Western
culture has been trapped and
compressed into bookshelves.

LADY CHATTERLEY'S AUTHOR—The Bender Room contains
several literary collections, including works by D.H. Lawrence.
The above letter was written bv Lawrence concerning the con
troversy surrounding his novel, "Ladv Chatterley's Lover." It
reads: "Dear Mrs Chambers 1 am sending you back your two
cheques of $20 each. It is useless trying to post 'Lady C.' to U.S.A.
— all held up — & dead loss. I'm so glad you got your two copies I
am furious at the fuss made over there in U.S.A. — even worse in
St. Louis & San Francisco & Santa Fe than in New York. My God —
don't people know what's natural & what isn't? VVe leave here next
Monday for Badenßaden. I shan't dare send my pictures to New
York now — they'd be confiscated too. What hypocrites! D.H.
