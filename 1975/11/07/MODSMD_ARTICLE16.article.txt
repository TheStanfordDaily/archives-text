## Georgetown tuition soars 
### KATHY BATTS 
Faced with massive cuts in federal aid. officials at Georgetown
University Medical School have expressed the fear that annual
tuition could jump up to $10-14,000 from its present level of $5000
in the next year.
Due to its location in the District of Columbia, Georgetown
received $5000 per student per year from the D.C. Health Man
power Act. The act expires on June 30,1970. Although Rep. Stuart
McKinney (R-Conn.) has offered to introduce legislation into the
House which would extend the bill, this would only alleviate
short-range goals, according to John Barasso, vice-president of the
Medical Student Body.
The act also provided Georgetown dental students with $3000
per year and George Washington University medical students with
$5000 per year. A total of $9,050,000 was given in aid last year,
Barasso told the Georgetown Hoya.
Long-range plans. Barasso said, include the possibility of stu
dents borrowing money from the university, should tuition reach
projected heights.
Another alternative, according to Medical Student Body Presi
dent Jack Mac Donald, is for the medical school to borrow money
'from as yet unnamed insurance companies.
Mac Donald told theHoya that up to $20,000 in federally-insured
loans could be made available to each student this way, if the
[student takes training courses in primary care, including prepara
tions for pediatricians, family practicioners and general interns.
The money problems stem from the school's location, said
Pauline Minstrv, medical center planning coordinator. "We don't
receive the substantial support that most schools get from their
state governments," Minstrv said. "The District simply doesn't
have enough money "
Minstry said she had been told two years ago, when the bill was
received, that the District would be able to fund the $9 million
program upon formation of home rule.
"Now," she said, "thev say they don't have the money."
