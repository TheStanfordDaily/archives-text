# Diplomats respond to terrorism with tighter security measures
## 
### The Associated Press 
In an age of terrorism, assassi
nations and political kidnap
ings, diplomats around the
world conduct their business
behind steel doors and under
heavy guard — extremely cauti
ous as to whom they let into their
offices.
—The U.S. Embassy in New
Delhi, India, is guarded 24 hours
a day by Indian police who live
in a tent outside the gate.
—The American ambassador
in Malaysia runs several miles
every morning for exercise, but
with a Marine guard jogging
alongside.
Carries gun
—In New York, an Israeli dip
lomat carries a gun, and when he
goes to a restaurant he asks for a
table with a view of the door and
the entire room.
—An ambassador in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, goes around
with a pistol in his belt.

—Passageways to high
echelon offices in some embas
sies and consulates are blocked
by iron gates, and two-way mir
rors and television scanners are
used to check on who enters dip
lomatic missions.
—Diplomats in some coun
tries are advised to mix up daily
routines and take different
routes to and from their offices
each day.
Assassinations
The question of diplomatic
security came to the fore earlier
this month when the Turkish
ambassadors in Paris and Vie
nna, Austria, were assassinated
— one in his office, the other in
an ambush of his car.
Few diplomats say the sec
urity precautions under which
they now operate interfere with
their work. Others say having
bodyguards from host countries
and special security arrange
ments sometimes is a nuisance

they have to put up with.
"The point is that it is up to us.
up to the ambassador, to decide
if we want to take these guards
everywhere," said Egyptian
Ambassador Abdel Monem
Shinnawi in Manila, the Philip
pines.

"They are not imposed upon
us. They do not interfere with
our work and they do not see
what we do 24 hours a day."
Diplomatic officials say they
do not want to discuss specific
security arrangements because
that would defeat their purpose.
