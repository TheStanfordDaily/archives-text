# Conservative students support 'Indian,' Bonfire

### MARK NASSUTTI 
Conservatives. Pictures of George
Wallace or the Midwest come to mind.
The word is commonly associated
with being old fashioned, with
traditionalism. But traditions in the
eyes of members of the Conservative
Student Union (CSU) aren't all that
bad.
The CSU is responsible for the
Arena newspaper, which broke the
story of Alexandr Solzhenitsvn's visit
to Stanford last spring. It periodically
sponsors speeches by prominent con
servatives, such as the speech by Wil
liam Buckley earlier this fall. It also
fielded a slate of candidates in a
somewhat successful race for the
ASSU Senate last month.
The campus organization maintains
a core of eight members who meet once
a week. French Prof. Alphonse Juil
land, an adviser to the group, said it
"usually starts out with about 35
members, but many drift off when time
comes to do some work for the organi
zation," such as distributing the
Arena.
For those who attend, the meetings
serve to redefine and support their
viewpoints, according to CSU Presi
dent Jim Simpson. "We come together
to reaffirm our convictions, to back

each other up to lick our wounds, so to
speak," after battles with campus radi
cals. liberals and libertarians.
The groups supports a return of the
Stanford Indian mascot, as well as
maintenance of the Big Game Bonfire.
It views the Bonfire as a traditional
event which helps to bring students
together.
Supports Iranian project
According to Simpson, the CSU also
supports the University's Iranian satel
lite project, finding it educational and
beneficial to the University.
Its paper, the Arena is published
two or three times a quarter, and re
ceives funding from wealthy Stanford
alumnus David Packard.who repor
tedly donated $400, and other friends
of the organization.
The CSU's high-budget campaign
for four ASSU Senate candidates ear
lier this year spotlighted several of the
group's stands. Two of its members,
freshman Dan Livingston and junior
David Sharp finished 19th and 20th in
the race, which made them Senate al
ternates. Thus far. however, they have
not been vocal in opposition to the
body's leftist majority.
But Simpson said Senator Bob Ot
tilie is a "closet conservative."

CONSERVATIVE AWAKENING?—Jim Simpson, Conservative Student
Union (CSU) President outlines his group's plans. Last month the CSU ran a
slate for the ASSU Senate posts. Two candidates won seats as alternates.
Some CSU foes are vocal in assailing
the organization. Bill Evers, graduate
student in political science and vice
president of the campus Libertarian
Society, claimed that "historically,
conservative groups arise in negative

response to what they consider radical
actions and opinions. Conservatism
therefore does not seem to have an
overall integrated doctrine."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said, "I cannot remember ever re
ceiving any kind of advice, opinion or
letter urging action (from the CSU) in
my time as dean. It is often the case that
student groups tend to speak to them
selves. There is not always the ability
or willingness to develop the facts to
address the issues well."
Lyons added he could not support
the CSU's move to reverse the
administration's abolishment of the
Indian mascot unless the group
brought up new arguments. "There
were compelling moral reasons to tak
ing the stand we did."
juilland admitted, "up to now, the
CSU has had very little effect, except
for the recent elections where 250 stu
dents voted for candidates with con
servative platforms." But he said he
sees some progress in the group's
cause.
"I feel the undergraduate student
body has become more tolerant, more
open to conservative viewpoints. In
1968 or thereabouts, if I presented a
conservative position in a hall, 1 would
be booed and whistled at."
