# Poloists head for L.A. weekend

### CHRIS KAMEL 
A perfect 3-0 conference re
cord. A 16-g lme winning streak.
A 17-1 season record. Stanford's
varsity waterpolo team puts all
these marks on the line this
weekend when it travels to Los
Agneles to play their most de
manding doubleheader of the
season. The Cards take on UCLA
today at 3 p.m. and USC Satur
day at 11 a.m.
Even though they are playing
two teams, the Cards are concen
trating only on UCLA.Although
Stanford has had a particularly
successful year in the Pacific-8
so far, the fact remains that the
Bruins are breathing down the
necks of the Cards with a 2-1
league record.
You can do all the mathema
tics and statistics you want, but
it still works out that this
weekend Stanford has to play
like a championship team. If the
Cards beat UCLA, and eventu
ally sweep the doubleheader,
Stanford will have clinched the
Pac-8 championship and will go
to the NCAA's. If they split the
two games, however, the Cards
could still conceivably lose the
Pac-8 title, these chances en
hanced if that loss is to the
Bruins.
On the line
The Pac-8 championship
would then depend on the out
come of the Cards' final league
game against Cal. The always
tough Golden Bears now have
their full complement of players,
since their big guns are back
from the Pan-American games.
One factor that the Cards will
be able to count on is the play of
four-year varsity poloer J.P.
Roberts, who was nursing a

muscle aggravation of the knee
earlier this week.
"When he's in there, things
just seem to happen," says
Coach Art Lambert.
Robert feels UCLA will be very
tough in their own pool.
Physical play
"They'll play physical, but
we'll have to stick it to them.
What I will do is try to work the
ball around the perimeter of the
goal on offense," he says.
"At my position of working at
the point on defense, I'll try to
draw the defensive man out with
me in order to get the ball into
the hole. If the man drops back,
as UCLA sometimes does, I'll
take the shot," notes the senior
captain fromPasadena.
Lambert hopes that many
things will be improved over the
previous Stanford-UCLA
matchup this year which ended
up in a 3-2 Card win.
In own pool
"We will have to score a lot
more goals to beat UCLA in their
own pool," says Lambert. "We
will be playing a tight, pressing
man-to-man defense, while
helping out Chris (Dorst) in the
goal."
The conditions of the game
will be noticeably different
down at UCLA. "The Bruin pool
is narrower than what we're
used to playing in. The fans also
crowd the side of the pool and
the referees can only officiate on
one side because of the layout
down there," Lambert remarks.
Lambert, however, says that in
order to win the Cards will have
to adjust to any situation that
they're faced with. He also in
dicated that he hopes that there
will be an adjustment in the

team's attitude.
"I hope that the guys have con
fidence in themselves. I have
more conficence in this game
than any other I've coached be

fore." As Lambert said in a team
meeting,"l hope UCLA has their
band there, and their pompon
girls, and their cheering fans,
because Iwant all of them to see
us win."
