# Cardinal task: sack of Troy

USC doesn't have much offen
sive imagination. All they do is
give the ball to one Richard
Lamar Bell, behind a wall of
blockers. But when you have the
best rusher (1354 yards) in the
nation, why change?
Bell, who carried the ball just
three times in the Trojan spring
game, now gets it 30 times a con
test. Oh sure, USC may break the
routine with a handoff to full
back Mosi Tatupu or a rare pass
from quarterback Vince Evans to
one of USC'a inept receivers, but
chances are Bell will get the call.
Stopping him will be the main
task Stanford faces when the
Cards travel to the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum to take on

the eighth-ranked Trojans at
1:30 p.m.
Big upset
The Trojans, as the entire na
tion knows by now, were upset
by California 28-14 in Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium last week.
And the Pacific Eight, as
everyone also knows, is not USC
Coach John McKay's private
hunting ground any more.
The Pac-8 race is as crowded
as the Pasadena Freeway at
mid-afternoon, with five teams
including the Cards and the Tro
jans tied for the conference lead.
Before the season most of the
Pac-8 coaches conceded another
Rose Bowl appearance to USC
and before last week it looked
like a strong bet. The Trojans had
won seven straight games, in
cluding a 24-17 win over over
rated Notre Dame. But that was
before that Cal upset.
Add a Rose Bowl bid to
Stanford's almost fanatic hatred
of Troy, and an estimated Col
iseum crowd of 65,000 should
see one of the best conference
football games of the
year. Stanford Coach Jack Christ
iansen knows it too.
Big game
"USC is always a big game for
us, and that's certainly the case
this time. The team that loses
tomorrow will just about be
eliminated from the Rose Bowl
race. The winner will be one of
the two or three teams in good
shape," he said.
Chris refused to name a start
ing quarterback until last night.
But his revelation shocked no
one.
"Mike Cordova will be the
starting quarterback. USC is the
kind of team we'll have to throw
against, and if Mike isn't throw
ing well we'll put in Benjamin.
We'll leave Cordova in as long as
he is moving the team.
Don't change horses
"It's the same sort of thing we
had last week. Something's
working and I don't want to
change it," said Christiansen.
Someone asked him about
Benjamin's feelings and he said,
"No one's happy on the bench,
but he'll get to play. It won't hurt

the team to have two quarter
backs. Both of them practiced
with the first team half of the
time this week."
Chris did admit that Benjamin
has practiced better this week
than ever before. "I've got more
confidence in him every week."
But he also said that Cordova
was throwing better than he has
all year.
Chris said he's not using the
quarterback selection as a ploy.
But whoever the quarterback,
McKay is worried about the Car
dinals.
The lame-duck coach, who
last week announced his accep
tance of the head coach job of
new Tampa NFL franchise next
year, heaped praise upon Stan
ford. "We'll face what has be
come one of the strongest Stan
ford teams in the past 10 years.

We've proven we have trouble
defending the pass, and Stanford
throws well, so draw your own
conclusions," McKay said.
Bite cougars
"In fact, Washington State
coach Jim Sweeney told me
Stanford might be the best team
he's faced all year," he added.
The Cards beat the Cougars
54-14, while the Trojans beat
them 28-10.
McKay must despise his cur
rent team, or at least he sounds
like he does. "Offensively, to
beat Stanford, we'll have to
block better, throw better and
catch better than we have been
—or hope Rick Bell can break
some long runs.
"As for defense we'll play
much better this week ... I
think." And then he quipped,

THE ONE TO STOP—Tailback Ricky Bell isn't the entire USC
offense, but theTrojans would be in awfully deep trouble without
him.The USC junior has piled up over 1300 rushing yards already
this season.
"We're going to bring tackling
back into the game plan."
Medical story
USC has been keeping the doc
tors busy this week. Flanker
Shelton Diggs, who was Evans'
favorite target, has been declared
out for the season with a
sprained shoulder. And Mike
Cordova take note: USC's best
defensive back, Clint Stozier,
who last week had 10 tackles
against Cal, is doubtful for
tomorrow's game.
But McKay always has at least
one super defensive lineman
and this year is no exception. At
0-foot-4 and 240 pounds. Trojan
defensivetackleCary Jeter, is not
exceptionally big, but Christian

sen says he's one of the best in
the country.
USC football seems to breed
streaks. Hut that Cal upset broke
nearly all of them. Only one re
mains — the men ot Troy haven't
lost in the Coliseum in 25 games.
The last team to beat the Trojans
in Los Angeles? John Ralston's
Stanford Indians (33-18) in 1971.
Let's not talk about 1973,
when Chris Limahelu kicked ,a
34-yard field goal, with three
seconds remaining, to give USC
a 27-26 win over Stanford and
keep that win streak alive.
But at times talk of a Stanford
upset sounds an awful lot like
the talk last year, when the Tro
jans marched into Stanford
Stadium and simply destroyed
the Cards 34-10.
