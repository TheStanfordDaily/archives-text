## Trojans too tough 
### 
Sniffing roses is certainly nice, but, unfortu
nately, that thrill should end for Stanford to
morrow evening. USC's Trojans may have
some vulnerabilities, but don't bet any money
that Stanford will penetrate them. (On second
thought, 11 points, the Nevada line, looks aw
fully tempting.)
Last week our forecaster bit the big nuke
with a 1-3 record, dropping his season per
centage down to .750 (18-of-24). But this
week, with some conservative guesstimates,
maybe he can improve and get back into form.
You heard it here first. Stanford just doesn't
have it this weekend, no matter who the start
ing quarterback is. The Trojans always find a
way to make the USC-UCLA game exciting,

and this year, it's going to take two straight
victories.
The California Bears are going to still be
fired up after last weekend, and should have
no problems making dog meat of the Washing
ton Huskies.
Don't listen to people who say Oregon will
upset UCLA. They're wrong.
And in a battle of two pitiful teams, look for
WSU to knock over Oregon State (despite the
fact that OSU just missed upsetting the Cards
last weekend.)
USC 24, Stanford 14
Cal 35, Washington 21
UCLA 28, Oregon 6
WSU 28, OSU 27
