# 'Big Match' tomorrow
## Booters fall again 
### JEFF WAHBA 
The Cardinal booters were
edged by an inexperienced Uni
versity of the Pacific team 2-1
Wednesday at Stanford to cul
minate a season of misfortune.
Stanford's record fell to 4-9-2
as the booters prepare for their
biggest game of the season, the
"Big Match," at Stanford
Stadium against Cal at 1:30 to
morrow.
"It was one of our worst games
of the season," halfback Mac
Taylor commented. Coalie
Bruce Mosbacher wasn't as po-

Lite when he said, "They're a ter
rible team and we were just
worse today."
Playing in front of their smal
lest crowd of the season, 15 spec
tators, the Cards quickly
showed Pacific's ineptitude.
The Cards were able to keep the
ball on the Pacific side of the
field for about three-fourths of
the first half, but despite re
peated shots on goal they only
managed one score.
The Stanford goal came after a
freak call when Pacific just mis
sed scoring. A loose ball was
picked up by Mosbacher in front
of the goal and as a Pacific player
ran by him, Mosbacher was cal
led for sticking out his leg.
Pacific was awarded an indi
rect kick on goal from ten feet
away. The kick just missed going
in as the Stanford wall of players
standing in front of the goal
didn't break.
Shortly thereafter, Taylor
scored on a 15-foot shot after the
UOP goalie had committed him
self. But two minutes later
Pacific had one of its rare shots
on goal and the Pacific center

beat Mosbacher to the left from
20 feet out.
The second half was much like
the first as Stanford kept up its
steady pressure, though the pas
sing game wasn't as steady. With
time running short Stanford
moved up the field more to keep
up the pressure but with four
minutes left the Cardinal offen
sive strategy backfired.
A Pacific forward got a pass at
mid-field and on a one-on-one
breakaway was able to score and
clinch the game.
"What can I say?" Coach Bert
Baldaccini commented dejec
tedly. "We had a lot of oppor
tunities and couldn't score, and
then they got a lucky break. We
should haveannihiliated them."
The "Big Match" Saturday
will be the Cards' third Pac-8
game. They already lost to USC
and tied UCLA.
"This is our most important
game of the season and the only
one in Stanford Stadium,"
Coach Fred Priddle stated.
Hopefully the game will draw
"enough to get the Stadium
again" for soccer use.
