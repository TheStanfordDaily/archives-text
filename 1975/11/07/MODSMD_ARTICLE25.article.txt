# Women volleyers succeed
## 
### 
Will the next varsity sport at
Stanford be women's volleyball?
After their win over 1974 North
ern California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference (NCIAC)
champions San Jose State, it
seems more likely.
Undefeated in five matches
the Stanford women's volleyball
team is having a great year. But
there is nowhere to go to prove
how good the spikers are.
The team has club varsity
status now, with regular gym
time, a paid coach and a limited
expense budget. But it does not
give the club a spot in a league
and a chance for post-season
play. Right not the Cards play
non-league games with NCIAC
teams including California Uni
versity of San Francisco and
Santa Clara.
On Oct. 24, the team met San
Jose State in a scrimmage. Stan
ford came out on top 15-12,
10-15, 15-8. San Jose is unde
feated in regular matches.
Head Coach Bruce Downing
directs the 13 women through
various types of drills. The drills
include serving practice, spik
ing, setting and some non-ball
drills such as dives and rolls. For
endurance, the players do jumps
at the net and run at the end of
practice.
Assisting Downing are four
volunteers. Three of these, Barb
Finn, Suzanne Murphy and
Nancy Daum, played for the
Stanford Volleyball team. The
other assistant is Jim Johnson.
