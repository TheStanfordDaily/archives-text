Moroccans march into Sahara
KILOMETER EIGHT, Inside Spanish Sahara —Tens of
thousands of Moroccans under a forest of red flags and
chanting glory to Allah, launched a peaceful human wave
assault on the Spanish Sahara yesterday. They trekked
more than five miles into the disputed, mineral-rich ter
ritory through blinding sandstorms under a baking desert
sun.
At the United Nations in New York, Spain told the
Security Council Morocco had warned it would continue
the march at the risk of high casualties and a "situation of
belligerency" unless Spain agreed immediately to
negotiate on transferring the territory to Morocco.
The council unaninously called onMorroccoto with
draw its marchers from the Spanish Sahara.
Congress settles on oil price plan
WASHINGTON — Congressional conferees reached ag
reement yesterday on an oil-pricing plan that would
gradually increase fuel prices after the 1976 elections. It
was unclear whether the legislation is acceptable to Presi
dent Ford.
The complex pricing plan is part of a broad energy bill
that Congress expects to approve next week. Its passage
and acceptance by Ford would end a 10-month stalemate

between the White House and the Democratic-controlled
Congress over setting a national energy policy.
The pricing proposal of the Senate-House conference
committee, which has been working on the energy bill
since Oct. 6, would result in a four-cent rollback in the
retail price of a gallon of gasoline within the next 14
months, economists estimate.
Rocky withdrew to spare Ford
WASHINGTON — Vice President Nelson Rockefeller
said yesterday he withdrew from President Ford's 1976
ticket to spare Ford from Republican "party squabbles"
that were complicating his campaign against the impend
ing challenge from Ronald Reagan.
Rockefeller told a nationally broadcast news conference
that Ford is "my candidate" for 1976 but indicated he
disagrees with the assessment by the President's cam
paign managers that his presence on the ticket would
damage Ford.
Spies read 1.8 million telegrams
WASHINGTON — Ignoring Ford administration pro
tests, the Senate Intelligence Committee disclosed yester
day a highly secret arrangement by which U.S. spies, for
30 years, read up to 1.8 million international telegrams a
year.
The release of information on the National Security
Agency's (NSA) "Project Shamrock" was the first time a
Senate committee has acted on its own to disclose clas
sified information that the executive branch wanted to
keep secret, committee staff members said.
The disclosure was made and defended by Sen. Frank
Church (D-Idaho). He said the information demonstrates
that Congress needs to write a basic law governing NSA
operations that would be si mi lar to the legal charter which
is intended to govern the Central Intelligence Agency.
