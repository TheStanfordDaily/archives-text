Accused of glorifying crime in 20th
Century-Fox's upcoming release
Lucky Lady, film company president
Dennis C. Stanfil 1 remarked last night
in Redwood Hall that his company is
merely following proven audience ap
peal.
The Cinema, according to Stanfill. is
one of the few art forms that doubles as
a business. The main obligation is to
the stockholders. "If you don't make a
profit, you get thrown out."
Accompanied by film clips of the
rum-runner film Lucky Lady. Stanfill

presented a capsule history and prop
osed a possible future for the Hol
lywood film industry.
Stanfill, who is also chairman of the
board of 20th Century-Fox, charac
terized the movie business as fluctuat
ing. In the past, it was subject to corpo
rate takeovers, and in the future it faces
such innovations as video-discs and
cable systems.
'Boom business'
Stanfill explained that the movies
traditionally do "boom business" dur
ing a recession. He said they represent
"the best 'getting-out-of-the-house'

value of any entertainment," since
they are less expensive than dining
and sports events. In addition to that,
they provide "escapism."
Fielding questions from the audi
ence, Stanfill asked for opinions on an
Irwin Allen film Fox is considering
financing â€” a $15 million super
disaster epic appropriately called The
Day The World Ended. Although the
response to the film was overwhelm
ingly negative, one woman did sug
gest a creative twist. She proposed,
"Instead of having Steve McQueen
save the heroine, why don't you have
the heroine save Steve McQueen?"
Stanfill, whose daughter is a fresh
man here, is also vice-president of fi
nance for the Times-Mirror Publishing
Company (publishers of the Los
Angeles Times, and board member
and treasurer of KCET-TV in Los
Angeles. He joined 20th Century-Fox
in 1969 as executive vice president of
finance.
