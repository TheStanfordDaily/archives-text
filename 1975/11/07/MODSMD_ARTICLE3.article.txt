# Men's center to show film, challenge masculine roles
## 
### BERT BOWER 
A documentary film exploring the
implications of growing up male in the
United States will spearhead the for
mation of the Everyman Center, a Uni
versity men's center.
Men's Lives, which will be shown
Sunday at 8 p.m. in Bishop Au
ditorium, "points out how men are
overly goal and work oriented at the
expense of their emotions," according
to psychology graduate student Todd
Tieger. He is working to develop the
center with Michael Bissell, a pathol
ogy intern, and Dave Shallenburger, a
student in the Business School.
The Everyman Center will organize
small groups on campus to give men
the opportunity to freely express their
problems, pressures and emotions.
Bissell said.
The goal of the center is "to establish
a new definition of masculinity," ac
cording to Shallenburger. He said all
men have theright to choose what they
want to do with their lives without
"being oppressed by their masculine
role in society."
'Competitive atmosphere'
Tieger said he believes that the re
spect a man gets within the "competi
tive atmosphere" of Stanford is di
rectly correlated to his individual
achievement and the amount of money
he makes.
Along with establishing small
groups to discuss male sex roles, the
Everyman Center will publish infor
mation for all Stanford men, set up
hypertensive screening to detect high
blood pressure, begin a men's file
series and possibly poll Stanford men
on their feelings concerning rape, ac
cording to its creators.
In addition, the center's creators
hope to establish open dialogue bet
ween gay and straight males at Stan
ford. "The fear of homosexuality is
something that keeps men apart," exp
lained Bisell. "We must go beyond our

fears and doubts about gays so that we
can help each other grow," he said.
Although generally supportive of
the men's movement. Mike Silverstein
from the Gay's People Union (GPU) is
skeptical. He said, "The movement
often romanticizes gays without
realizing the oppressed character of
gay men."
'Break stereotypes'
GPU member Frank Pitch, however,
sees similarities between the women's,
men's and gay movements.
Emily Leavitt, who co-taught a
SWOPSI-SCIRE workshop on women,
commented, "It's more important to
have a men's center than a women's

center simply because most men don't
have anywhere to go to get the support
they need to explore themselves."
Twelve men have already formed a
weekly men's group for Stanford stu
dents. Tieger, a member of the group,
admitted, "When I first joined the
group I was not able to express the
normal, human part of me. Now I can
express my emotions and affection for
other group members."
Shallenburger said, "I see men sel
ling themselves to companies on a
closed path to success, and I try to tell
them that they don't necessarily have
to compete for money, that there are
other alternatives."
