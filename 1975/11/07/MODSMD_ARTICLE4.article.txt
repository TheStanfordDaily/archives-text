# Profs debate Miller, urge tenure reform
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS BOB MARSHO 
The tenure process is excessively
secretive and sorely needs reform,
members of the Stanford chapter of
the American Association of Univer
sity professors (AAIIP) told Provost
William Miller yesterday at a meeting
in Meyer Library.
Several professors complained that
the Appointments and Promotions
(A&P) Committee members lack suffi
cient information to evaluate the scho
larship of tenure candidates and that
the dean of Humanities and Sciences
has excessive power to determine who
receives tenure.
Asst. Biology Prof. Craig Heller told
Miller that committee members often
are unable to determine the quality of
scholarship in fields outside their
own.
Miller compared the committee's
deliberations to that of a judge who
must rely on the testimony of expert
witnesses.
But Classics Prof. Mark Edwards
said, "Miller's analogy of the commit
tee to a judge is not precise because, in
the tenure process, a candidate has no
advocate. And the committee denies
the candidate an opportunity to
cross-examine a witness."
'False impression'
Miller, however, said that "saying
there is no advocate gives a false im
pression because there is a great deal of
interaction between the dean (of
Humanities and Sciences) and the de
partment which recommended a per
son for tenure."
Several faculty members suggested
that an observer from the tenure
candidate's department sit on the
committee's hearings to verify that the
procedure was fair to the candidate.
Heller explained the departmental
representative could act as a "resource
person" to inform the committee about
the standards of scholarship in the te
nure candidate's field.
Miller said having a departmental
representive on the committee might
make the process "more of an adver
sarial situation and less of a review
situation."
Miller agreed with Heller however,
that closer consultation between de
partments and the committee would
help relieve candidates' apprehen
sions about unfairness.
No consultation
Assoc. Classics Prof. Michael
Wigodsky charged later that a large
number of departmental tenure re

commendations never reach the com
mittee because the dean of Humanities
and Sciences is allowed to deny tenure
to professors without consulting the
committee.
Wigodsky said he is so disgusted
with the system that he will no longer
participate in his department's tenure
process.
Assoc. History Prof. Gavin Lang
muir complained that junior faculty
members are plagued by the inability
to predict whether they will receive
tenure and often are unaware of what
scholarly standards the committee ex
pects.
Miller agreed that the administra
tion should attempt to clarify tenure
standards.
'No one can predict'
But he warned that "no one can pre
dict perfectly what will happen in a
given case." He added that "no one
would want a formula" to determine
who receives tenure because such a
procedure would eliminate the
committee's ability to decide each case
on its particular merits.
Later in the meeting, professors told

Miller that the administration should
make more information available con
cerning faculty salaries.
Miller argued that such publication
would violate the University's policy
on privacy.
Miller then contended that "salaries
are supposed to be an incentive and
reward and their publication would
erode that incentive."
Social pressure
He argued that publication of
salaries might subject professors to so
cial pressure or embarrassment. He
noted that any professor is free to re
veal his salary to anyone.
Rebholz called Miller's contention
"illogical," arguing that if professors
know the salaries of colleagues, they
will work harder for higher salaries.
Professors also told Miller that the
administration should consider estab
lishing fixed terms for administrators
and urged a formal evaluation proce
dure for administrators.
Several faculty members argued that
the faculty is better able to choose
deans and department heads than is
the administration.
