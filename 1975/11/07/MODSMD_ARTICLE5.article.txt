# McCloskey in key role
## Buyer bill passes 
### CHARLIE HALL 
Ralph Nader's office warmly praised
Rep. Paul McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) last night for his key
role in passing a controversial bill to
establish a consumer protection
agency.
loan Claybrook. director of Nader's
congressional lobbying committee,
said the bill,passed in the House of
Representatives yesterday by a vote of
208-189, succeeded largely because of
an amendment by McCloskey, which
will eliminate all existing consumer
agencies as soon as the new agency is
established.
McCloskev's amendment passed by
a vote of 379-27.
"This is a tremendously important
legislative victory," Claybrook said,
adding that McCloskev's amendment
will "remove the stigma that this bill is
adding to government unnecessarily."
The legislation will establish a con
sumer advocacy agency for the next
three years with an annual appropria
tion of $10 million. The agency would
be empowered to collect information
from large companies, establish regu

iations and sue other federal agencies
in order to ensure the protection of
consumer interests.
Two obstacles
The bill faces two obstacles before
becoming law.
It must first go to committee to re
solve differences between it and a
similar bill passed earlier this year in
the Senate, if approved in a final ver
sion, the bill must be signed into law
by President Ford.
Ford, who along with other Repub
licans has sharply criticized
yesterday's legislation for adding to
federal bureaucracy, hud threatened to
veto the bill in its previous form. But
McCloskey's amendment should make
it harder for Ford to carry out his
threat, according to Claybrook.
"McCloskey's amendment will
weed out superfluous bureaucracy,"
she notes, "and if President Ford
means what he says about excessive
government, he should pass it."
Veto still expected
Claybrook said, however, that a
presidential veto is still expected de
spite McCloskey's amendment, and
she declined to make any predictions
on whether a F"ord veto can be overrid
den.
One of the major problems in pas
sing consumer legislation, she pointed
out, is that business interests are effec
tive in lobbying against such bills.
Should thebill clearall its obstacles,
the proposed agency would make a
tremendous impact for consumers,
Claybrook argued.
"Every day. decisions are made in
health, safety, oil and many otherareas
which affect the consumer. By acting
as a watchdog over other federal agen
cies, Nader's office hoped that a new
consumer office will make the federal
government more responsive to con
sumer interests." according to
Claybrook.
A spokesman for McCloskey agreed
with the Nader office's assessment,
saying that McCloskey's amendment
"was instrumental in getting several
Republican congressmen to vote for
the bill."

be empowered to collect information
from large companies, establish regu

iations and sue other federal agencies
in order to ensure the protection of
consumer interests.
Two obstacles
The bill faces two obstacles before
becoming law.
It must first go to committee to re
solve differences between it and a
similar bill passed earlier this year in
the Senate, if approved in a final ver
sion, the bill must be signed into law
by President Ford.
Ford, who along with other Repub
licans has sharply criticized
yesterday's legislation for adding to
federal bureaucracy, hud threatened to
veto the bill in its previous form. But
McCloskey's amendment should make
it harder for Ford to carry out his
threat, according to Claybrook.
"McCloskey's amendment will
weed out superfluous bureaucracy,"
she notes, "and if President Ford
means what he says about excessive
government, he should pass it."
Veto still expected
Claybrook said, however, that a
presidential veto is still expected de
spite McCloskey's amendment, and
she declined to make any predictions
on whether a F"ord veto can be overrid
den.
One of the major problems in pas
sing consumer legislation, she pointed
out, is that business interests are effec
tive in lobbying against such bills.
Should thebill clearall its obstacles,
the proposed agency would make a
tremendous impact for consumers,
Claybrook argued.
"Every day. decisions are made in
health, safety, oil and many otherareas
which affect the consumer. By acting
as a watchdog over other federal agen
cies, Nader's office hoped that a new
consumer office will make the federal
government more responsive to con
sumer interests." according to
Claybrook.
A spokesman for McCloskey agreed
with the Nader office's assessment,
saying that McCloskey's amendment
"was instrumental in getting several
Republican congressmen to vote for
the bill."
Ralph Nader's office warmly praised
Rep. Paul McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) last night for his key
role in passing a controversial bill to
establish a consumer protection
agency.
loan Claybrook. director of Nader's
congressional lobbying committee,
said the bill,passed in the House of
Representatives yesterday by a vote of
208-189, succeeded largely because of
an amendment by McCloskey, which
will eliminate all existing consumer
agencies as soon as the new agency is
established.
McCloskev's amendment passed by
a vote of 379-27.
"This is a tremendously important
legislative victory," Claybrook said,
adding that McCloskev's amendment
will "remove the stigma that this bill is
adding to government unnecessarily."
The legislation will establish a con
sumer advocacy agency for the next
three years with an annual appropria
tion of $10 million. The agency would
be empowered to collect information
from large companies, establish regu

iations and sue other federal agencies
in order to ensure the protection of
consumer interests.
