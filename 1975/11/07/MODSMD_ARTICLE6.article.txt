Since a color does not a mascot make, it's time Stan
ford had a new symbol to represent its athletic squads.
Ever since the elimination of the Indian four years ago,
Stanford has been one of the few schools in the nation
to be without a symbol.
Supposedly, as USC fans cheer for Tommy Trojan
and California or UCLA fans yell for Oski or Bruin bear,
Stanford fans are to become ecstatic at the sight of the
color red.
This isn't a plea to readopt thelndian. That symbol is
gone, and for good reasons.
The Daily is merely interested in establishing a new
mascot for Farm fans to rally behind.
To help achieve this goal, the Daily is now sponsor
ing a search for a new mascot.
If you have any ideas (other than Indian-related
symbols), submit a red and black cartoon, or an idea
that one of our cartoonists can draw, before Nov. 19.
Send each entry, along with name and telephone
number, to The New Mascot Selection Board, Stanford
Daily, Storke Student Publication Building, Stanford,
CA, 94305.
The best entries, as determined by a review board,
will be reprinted in the Daily's Stanford vs. Cal football
issue in ballot form so that fans can choose their own
favorite. Whether or not the Athletic Department or the
University adopts the winner for official purposes, the
Daily will use the winning mascot wherever Cardinal
is presently used.
We hope others will follow suit.
