In reply to Stella Saunders'
Oct. 31 Daily titled "Indian
pride," 1 feel that this title ex
actly describes the feelings of
almost all the students, alumni
and staff before the mascot was
changed to the Cardinal.
When the Indian was the mas
cot. a great sense of pride was
shown in it.
Very few, if any, students
made fun of the Indian. And
everyone in the country and
beyond knew of us as the Stan
ford Indians, a name that had
come to be respected.
For Indian is a firm and sound
name. It is a powerful symbol —
just like the Trojan and the
Bruin.
The Cardinal on the other
hand, is a name scoffed at across
the country — it is a very weak
name.
We also must think of past
Stanford followers. Three gener
ations of my family have come to
Stanford and are all still avid

followers of its athletic ac
tivities.
Alumni and trustees across
the country have all spent years
and dollars supporting, building
and contributing to this great
university. They have been
proud to call us the Indians
during those years.
I'm sure that they would all
like to see the "re-incarnation"
of the Indian and for a good
reason.
Today the best fan response to
cheers at football games comes
during the Band's "Indian pre
lude." And I feel that a lot of the
fan dissention about the football
team has come about because we
don't have a respectable mascot.
The Indian is not degrading to
the Native Americans. A school
of Stanford's renown having the
Indian as its mascot can only in
crease one's respect for Native
Americans.
