# Brown's style: government-by-crisis?
## 
### 
Speculation is increasing that
Gov. Jerry Brown will emerge
from a deadlocked convention
next summer as the youngest
Democratic presidential
nominee since "Boy Orator of
the Platte" William Jennings
Bryan. Even those political
analysts who scoff at this possi
bility do not scoff at the possibil
ity he may actively seek the
nomination before long.
Recent articles in a number of
national publications have de
scribed Brown as representing a
new species of politician — lib
erals who believe the
government's role in promoting
social welfare ought to be care
fully circumscribed, lest New
York's fate become our own. Ac
cording to recent polls Brown is
rapidly growing in popularity
among both McGovern and
Reagan voters in California.
Given these facts, it seems
crucial that liberals come to
terms with Brown and the at
titudes he exemplifies.
My first inclination is to sup
port Brown. Brown was a leader
in the 1968 Eugene McCarthy
presidential campaign when
being for McCarthy was in many
circles tantamount to treason. He
was a backer of Cesar Chavez's
fight to bring decency to Califor
nia agriculture before it was par
ticularly chic.
Prop. 9
He was also a proponent of
measures like Prop. 9 before
Watergate, and his performance
as California Secretary of State in
dealing with campaign reform
and related issues was nothing
short of superb.
His personal lifestyle is, to say
the least, admirable; he has for
saken limousines, mansions and
pay increases.
His style of governing is cer
tainly unusual, and seems to be
effective so far. It remains to be
seen, however, whether this
style of governing will work in
the long term.
He eschews the traditional

political "obligations" of gover
nors. The most recent example of
this was his refusal
to take time off to woo site
seekers for the Democratic
Party national convention.
However, by disdaining such
rituals he may in the long run
alienate those politicians whose
cooperation he needs to govern
effectively. There are already
growing reports that members of
the state legislature are becom
ing angry at Brown's unpredict
able and abnormal political be
havior.
Brown's attitude towards
compromise is an example of
this abnormal behavior.
Limited appearances
His public appearances are
limited to those he feels will
have positive educative as well
as political effects, such as his
dialogue on collective bargain
ing issues with teachers at a re
cent union convention. This is
laudable and is in keeping with
his self-proclaimed gadfly role
— as is his penchant for asking
awkward questions of
policymakers at Board of Re
gents and other meetings.
His leadership style is in
tensely personal. Instead of let
ting subordinates do the hard
jobs and rushing in to reap the
credit, he gets involved in the
details of policy determination.
The farmworkers bill, for ex
ample, was thrashed out in his
office during a number of gruel
ling sessions lasting late into the
evening. In advance of delibera
tions on this and other issues
(e.g., the budget) he devoured
mounds of information on the

subject.
All of which points up a prob
lem. By necessity this is a one
thing-at-a-time strategy for prob
lem solving.
While such a strategy seems
conducive to making significant
changes in a few areas instead of
merely incremental changes in
many areas, it also seems condu
cive to governinent-by-crisis.
That is, it encourages dealing
with those issues for which im
mediate solutions are de
manded.
There are three problems with
this strategy. First, not all prob
lems are likely to lead to crises.
Secondly, by waiting so long a
problem may grow to unsolvable
proportions. Examples of such
problems include poverty, edu

cation and pollution.
Still a third problem with
government-by-crisis is that
government may tend to deal
only with issues championed by
identifiable interest groups. Not
all issues belong to identifiable
constituencies; tax reform is
such an issue.
Given Brown's personal in
volvement in details, one won
ders who is responsible for over
all policy coordination and for
keeping tabs on long-term and
subtle problems. Also, what are
the implications of Brown's style
for solving interrelated
problems such as environmental
damage and energy shortage?
