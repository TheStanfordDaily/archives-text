# Cards outplay USC (and this time win!)
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
LOS ANGELES — At the time
they picked it, the people who
came up with the USC Trojans'
motto "We'll survive in '75"
might not have seemed very op
timistic.
But after Stanford had bashed
ninth-ranked USC 13-10 Satur
day, anyone who expected the
Trojans to last beyond about
Nov. 29 must have been count
ing on USC's accepting a bid to
the Fiesta Bowl.
But Stanford in the Rose
Bowl? It just might be in the
script.
After all, if the Cards could use
what Coach Christiansen called
"a Hollywood script" complete
with that old favorite, the last
second L.A. field goal, and a full
cast of goats-turned-heroes to
beat the Trojans, what was to
stop them from going all the
way?
McKay bitter
Certainly not Trojan Coach John
McKay, whose last game ever
against Stanford left his ego al
most as bruised as his players.
"They out-muscled us all the
way," said McKay. "They just
came right through, and we hit
them with our press clippings."
"Give credit for this win to the
defense," said Stanford Coach
Jack Christiansen. But the Cards
couldn't have gained revenge on
the team that has kept them from
the Rose Bowl seven times in the
last decade without a familiar
pair of last-second saviors: quar
terback Guy Benjamin and
kicker Mike Langford.

Benjamin, whose string of 18
consecutive games,as Stanford's
second-string quarterback may
finally be snapped, came in to
replace Mike Cordova early in
the second quarter. He with
stood a strong USC rush and oc
casionally fumble-fingered Card
receivers to complete 15 of 29
passes — and, as usual, he saved
his best for last.
Savann grabs one
After freshman cornerback
Savann Thompson had inter
cepted a USC pass and been tack
led in the midst of a furious fist
fight at the Trojan 38, Benjamin
had only 59 seconds to move the
team out of one of the most un
satisfyng — and potentially
deadly — ties in Stanford foot
ball history.
It seemed at first as if he
wouldn't need half that much
time. On the Cards' first play he
drilled a 14-yard pass to tight
end Ted Pappas, and then Ben
jamin, back to throw under no
pressure from the Trojans, de
cided to run and sprinted out of
bounds at the USC 15.
There were still 36 seconds to
play. Stanford fans may have
been waiting for Benjamin to try
a few tosses ino the end zone, but
Christiansen had other ideas.
Three running plays and 31 sec
onds of play later, Langford trot
ted on the field to do what he
seems to do best: kick a game
ending field goal.
For a dramatic game-winning
field goal, Langford's 37-yarder
was certainly subjected to a lot of
locker-room analysis. It didn't

wobble and just barely cleared
the cross-bar like Langford's
Cal-killing kick last season.
Getting even
And after all, USC had beaten
the Cards twice on field goals
during recent seasons.
"This one has to rate as one of
the all-time clutch field goals,"
said Christiansen. "Of course,
Rod Garcia's kick that won the
Rose Bowl was pretty good, too."
But Christiansen did call Lan
ford "one of the best field-goal
kickers in the country." There
were times during Saturday's
game when that statement might
have been more widely ques
tioned than it was after the win
ning kick.
The Trojan supporters, proba
bly two-thirds of the 68,000 Col
iseum fans, didn't get a chance to
do much besides gasp during the
first few minutes of play. First,
after the Cards had stalled, there
was a miraculous 70-yard punt
by Stanford's Tom Lynn that
sent the Trojans back to their 15.
Bell wrung
And then theTrojans' national
rushing leader Ricky Bell, was
smashed for losses on two of his
first four carries by ends Duncan
McColl and John Harris. The
fans were really seeing only a
preview of the Cards' savage
rushing defense that threw USC
ball-carriers for losses on 12 of
the Trojans' first 23 plays.
On the same drive Bell groped
unsuccessfully for a weak pitch
out from quarterb3ck Vince
Evans, and Card safety Gerald
Wilson fell on it at the SC 32.
From there it was four plays by
the Cordova-directed offense
into easy field goal range on the
USC 5, but Langford's kick mis
sed narrowly.
Langford atoned for his earlier
muff with a 55-yard line drive
after a USC punt was partly
blocked by the same kind of Car
dinal rush that had dumped
Oregon State the week before.
Break out
But on the next play Ricky Bell,
who had been held to seven
yards on seven carries, finally
broke loose. It was hardly a pic
ture play. Bell bashed into Evans
on the handoff, stumbled past a
few defenders and was in the
clear, a few steps ahead of
freshman cornerback Larry
Reynolds.
They raced down the field
stride for stride. "I knew I wasn't
gaining on him," said Reynolds.
"We were getting down to the
goal line, and I had to do some

thing."
Reynolds' perfectly-timed
full-length sprawl enabled him
to grab Bell's ankle, and the Tro
jan tailback staggered for a few
steps and then fell face-first on
the Stanford four yard line. On
the next play, McColl recovered
Evans' fumble, and the Trojans
were still shut out.
Mike Cordova fell on his own
fumble on his last play of the
game, and on the next series Ben
jamin couldn't move the team,
either. Then USC's sprinter
Junior Lee escaped single cover
age by Savann Thompson for a
68-yard touchdown bomb.
Inge tosses
The Cards, sparked by half
back Ron Inge's pass to Tony
Hill, drove down to the SC 18,
fumbled, and then mounted
another drive behind Benjamin's
passing. Inge rolled around end
and leaped into the end zone,
landing on his head for the Stan

ford score a few plays before half
time.
The Cardinal script for the
second half called for ball
control,dropped key passes and
two missed field goals, but the
defense got the starring role. De
spite a couple of USC drives that
were all Ricky Bell, who had 195
yards on the day, players like
McColl and Dan Francis and Geb
Church and Bruce Barker held
the Trojans to only a field goal.
Which brings us to the last
minute and a half, with Thomp
son racing down the sideline a
half-step behind SC end Randy
Simmrin.
"I looked up and saw the ball
coming," said Thompson.
"What was I thinking? Shit, pick
it off!"
He did, and gave way to Guy
Benjamin and the offense. And a
few plays later, it was time for
the Trojans to cave in, and Lang
ford to propel the Cards into the
two-game race for the Rose
Bowl.
