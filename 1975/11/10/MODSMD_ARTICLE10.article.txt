# Abolish the honor code
## 
### Richard Fearon 
Stanford has long prided itself
for being one of the few univer
sities in the nation that still
supervises test-taking through
an honor code. Almost without
fail, references to the University
remark on the "uniqueness" of
this system of supervision.
But a closer look at the func
tioning of the Honor Code indi
cates why it is such a "unique"
institution — for the system is
ineffective. Because of its inher
ent unworkability, one is led to
conclude that thecodeshould be
abolished.
Although no quantitative data
concerning the proportion of
undergraduates who cheat have
been compiled, all indications
are that a very sizable group has
violated the code in the past.
University Ombudsman John
D. Goheen said in his annual re
port for last year, that, after in
vestigating the issue, he found
considerable disregard for the
Honor Code. Coheen's report,
along with doubts held by a
number of people in student
government, has prompted the
University to reassess the effi
cacy of the code.
Yet, apart from any quantita
tive measure of the number who
have violated the Honor Code, it
is inherently incapable of keep
ing people from cheating.
Untold tales
A 1974 study conducted at UC
Davis found that 75.4 percent of
the undergraduates would not
report another student cheating.
And although the composition
of the Stanford student body is
undoubtedly somewhat differ
ent from UC Davis, one suspects
these figures probably do not
deviate too radically from views
of Stanford students.
However, if some students are
not concerned about the advan
tage students who violate have,
what about the other group of
students? This second group is
bring hurt by the refusal to report
cheaters.

It is hardly fair for some pre
med red-hot to have to compete
with someone taking the test
with the assistance of notes. This
is clearly apodictic.
Secondly, it is very difficult to
detect all but the most flagrant
instances of cheating.
When one is taking an impor
tant test, he generally is under
substantial time pressure. He
hardly has time to spend looking
around the room at other stu
dents.
Apprehension unlikely
Consequently, his infrequent
scrutinties of the other test
takers greatly diminish the
chances of a cheater being ap
prehended. This especially
holds true if students are cheat
ing in a subtle way; indeed it
would requirea great deal of vig
ilance to discover such tactics.
Another serious indictment of
the present Honor Code ar
rangement is the method of re
porting violations.
With the lengthy timed exams
characteristic of most Stanford
classes, one has little time to
spend doing things other than
taking the exam.
When one is trying to do well
on an exam, he is not willing to
spend the necessary time to re
port students violating the code.
For, usually professors return to
their offices, which may be many
minutes away.
Yet, if one waits until after
class to report the violation, he
finds it almost impossible to
identify the transgressor unless
he happens to previously know
that person's name.

Therefore, it is an almost im
possible task to concentrate on
an important exam and also to
turn in those people one hap
pens to see cheating.
Extra time?
And even if one were given
extra time to compensate for the
time spent reporting the viola
tion, it is unreasonable to expect
nine students to go through that
much trouble while trying to
concentrate upon an important
test.
Lastly, even if one is ap
prehended cheating and his case
is duly adjudicated, the penalty
imposed is likely to be minis
cule.
Of the eight students caught
and tried last year, five were
suspended for one quarter, one
was censured and the other two
were placed on probation —
hardly very draconian measures.
What is to deter a potential chea
ter if all he receives is a slight
reprimand?
Merely meting out harsher
judgements, as some propose, is
hardly sufficient to restore the
code's efficacy.
Students will cheat as much
with harsh penalties as with the
current small penalties. For they
know that their chances of being
caught are exceedingly small.
The remedy
The remedy for the Honflr
Code's faults is to institute a sys
tem of proctoring — as has re
cently been done at Johns Hop
kins University.
Hopkins' 51-year-old
honor system was abolished this
year because it was found to be
ineffective.
Proctors would be able to de
tect cheating much more effi
ciently than the average student
taking a test. A proctor would be
able to pay close attention and
through his diligence, might
even detect less obvious vio
lators.

Although students would still
discover ways to evade the sys
tem, it would nevertheless be a
huge improvement.
As much as one may enjqy the
freedom the Honor Code confers,
one cannot deny the system's un
justness. It is time we admit its
deficiencies and institute re
forms.

institution — for the system is
ineffective. Because of its inher
ent unworkability, one is led to
conclude that thecodeshould be
abolished.
Although no quantitative data
concerning the proportion of
undergraduates who cheat have
been compiled, all indications
are that a very sizable group has
violated the code in the past.
University Ombudsman John
D. Goheen said in his annual re
port for last year, that, after in
vestigating the issue, he found
considerable disregard for the
Honor Code. Coheen's report,
along with doubts held by a
number of people in student
government, has prompted the
University to reassess the effi
cacy of the code.
Yet, apart from any quantita
tive measure of the number who
have violated the Honor Code, it
is inherently incapable of keep
ing people from cheating.
Untold tales
A 1974 study conducted at UC
Davis found that 75.4 percent of
the undergraduates would not
report another student cheating.
And although the composition
of the Stanford student body is
undoubtedly somewhat differ
ent from UC Davis, one suspects
these figures probably do not
deviate too radically from views
of Stanford students.
However, if some students are
not concerned about the advan
tage students who violate have,
what about the other group of
students? This second group is
bring hurt by the refusal to report
cheaters.

It is hardly fair for some pre
med red-hot to have to compete
with someone taking the test
with the assistance of notes. This
is clearly apodictic.
Secondly, it is very difficult to
detect all but the most flagrant
instances of cheating.
When one is taking an impor
tant test, he generally is under
substantial time pressure. He
hardly has time to spend looking
around the room at other stu
dents.
Apprehension unlikely
Consequently, his infrequent
scrutinties of the other test
takers greatly diminish the
chances of a cheater being ap
prehended. This especially
holds true if students are cheat
ing in a subtle way; indeed it
would requirea great deal of vig
ilance to discover such tactics.
Another serious indictment of
the present Honor Code ar
rangement is the method of re
porting violations.
With the lengthy timed exams
characteristic of most Stanford
classes, one has little time to
spend doing things other than
taking the exam.
When one is trying to do well
on an exam, he is not willing to
spend the necessary time to re
port students violating the code.
For, usually professors return to
their offices, which may be many
minutes away.
Yet, if one waits until after
class to report the violation, he
finds it almost impossible to
identify the transgressor unless
he happens to previously know
that person's name.

Therefore, it is an almost im
possible task to concentrate on
an important exam and also to
turn in those people one hap
pens to see cheating.
Extra time?
And even if one were given
extra time to compensate for the
time spent reporting the viola
tion, it is unreasonable to expect
nine students to go through that
much trouble while trying to
concentrate upon an important
test.
Lastly, even if one is ap
prehended cheating and his case
is duly adjudicated, the penalty
imposed is likely to be minis
cule.
Of the eight students caught
and tried last year, five were
suspended for one quarter, one
was censured and the other two
were placed on probation —
hardly very draconian measures.
What is to deter a potential chea
ter if all he receives is a slight
reprimand?
Merely meting out harsher
judgements, as some propose, is
hardly sufficient to restore the
code's efficacy.
Students will cheat as much
with harsh penalties as with the
current small penalties. For they
know that their chances of being
caught are exceedingly small.
The remedy
The remedy for the Honflr
Code's faults is to institute a sys
tem of proctoring — as has re
cently been done at Johns Hop
kins University.
Hopkins' 51-year-old
honor system was abolished this
year because it was found to be
ineffective.
Proctors would be able to de
tect cheating much more effi
ciently than the average student
taking a test. A proctor would be
able to pay close attention and
through his diligence, might
even detect less obvious vio
lators.

Although students would still
discover ways to evade the sys
tem, it would nevertheless be a
huge improvement.
As much as one may enjqy the
freedom the Honor Code confers,
one cannot deny the system's un
justness. It is time we admit its
deficiencies and institute re
forms.

port for last year, that, after in
vestigating the issue, he found
considerable disregard for the
Honor Code. Coheen's report,
along with doubts held by a
number of people in student
government, has prompted the
University to reassess the effi
cacy of the code.
Yet, apart from any quantita
tive measure of the number who
have violated the Honor Code, it
is inherently incapable of keep
ing people from cheating.
Untold tales
A 1974 study conducted at UC
Davis found that 75.4 percent of
the undergraduates would not
report another student cheating.
And although the composition
of the Stanford student body is
undoubtedly somewhat differ
ent from UC Davis, one suspects
these figures probably do not
deviate too radically from views
of Stanford students.
However, if some students are
not concerned about the advan
tage students who violate have,
what about the other group of
students? This second group is
bring hurt by the refusal to report
cheaters.

It is hardly fair for some pre
med red-hot to have to compete
with someone taking the test
with the assistance of notes. This
is clearly apodictic.
Secondly, it is very difficult to
detect all but the most flagrant
instances of cheating.
When one is taking an impor
tant test, he generally is under
substantial time pressure. He
hardly has time to spend looking
around the room at other stu
dents.
Apprehension unlikely
Consequently, his infrequent
scrutinties of the other test
takers greatly diminish the
chances of a cheater being ap
prehended. This especially
holds true if students are cheat
ing in a subtle way; indeed it
would requirea great deal of vig
ilance to discover such tactics.
Another serious indictment of
the present Honor Code ar
rangement is the method of re
porting violations.
With the lengthy timed exams
characteristic of most Stanford
classes, one has little time to
spend doing things other than
taking the exam.
When one is trying to do well
on an exam, he is not willing to
spend the necessary time to re
port students violating the code.
For, usually professors return to
their offices, which may be many
minutes away.
Yet, if one waits until after
class to report the violation, he
finds it almost impossible to
identify the transgressor unless
he happens to previously know
that person's name.

Therefore, it is an almost im
possible task to concentrate on
an important exam and also to
turn in those people one hap
pens to see cheating.
Extra time?
And even if one were given
extra time to compensate for the
time spent reporting the viola
tion, it is unreasonable to expect
nine students to go through that
much trouble while trying to
concentrate upon an important
test.
Lastly, even if one is ap
prehended cheating and his case
is duly adjudicated, the penalty
imposed is likely to be minis
cule.
Of the eight students caught
and tried last year, five were
suspended for one quarter, one
was censured and the other two
were placed on probation —
hardly very draconian measures.
What is to deter a potential chea
ter if all he receives is a slight
reprimand?
Merely meting out harsher
judgements, as some propose, is
hardly sufficient to restore the
code's efficacy.
Students will cheat as much
with harsh penalties as with the
current small penalties. For they
know that their chances of being
caught are exceedingly small.
The remedy
The remedy for the Honflr
Code's faults is to institute a sys
tem of proctoring — as has re
cently been done at Johns Hop
kins University.
Hopkins' 51-year-old
honor system was abolished this
year because it was found to be
ineffective.
Proctors would be able to de
tect cheating much more effi
ciently than the average student
taking a test. A proctor would be
able to pay close attention and
through his diligence, might
even detect less obvious vio
lators.

Although students would still
discover ways to evade the sys
tem, it would nevertheless be a
huge improvement.
As much as one may enjqy the
freedom the Honor Code confers,
one cannot deny the system's un
justness. It is time we admit its
deficiencies and institute re
forms.

Stanford has long prided itself
for being one of the few univer
sities in the nation that still
supervises test-taking through
an honor code. Almost without
fail, references to the University
remark on the "uniqueness" of
this system of supervision.
But a closer look at the func
tioning of the Honor Code indi
cates why it is such a "unique"
institution — for the system is
ineffective. Because of its inher
ent unworkability, one is led to
conclude that thecodeshould be
abolished.
Although no quantitative data
concerning the proportion of
undergraduates who cheat have
been compiled, all indications
are that a very sizable group has
violated the code in the past.
