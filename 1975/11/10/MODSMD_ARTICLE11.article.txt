As a USC graduate now work
ing at Stanford, 1 am amused at
the amount of time, energy and
space that is set aside in the
Daily to cultivate a "hate SC"
campaign.
In an age of "future shock"
change, 1 am glad to have a few
traditions left to honor. 1 am
proud to stand and cheer when
the Trojan band strikes up "Con
quest" or Traveller 11 lopes
around the stadium (a beautiful
animal that Stanford students
saw fit to barrage with garbage
on their last visit to the Col
iseum).
USC students and alumni find
spirit in their school and teams
and aren't against Stanford or
anyone else.

Insulting ad
Editor:
The ad appearing on page
three of the Nov. 5 Daily must be
a mistake.
The Indian as he appears here
is an insult to us all. If this is
what is available at the stores
listed, then these stores will no
longer have my patronage.
Stanford's image as noble In
dians on the field or on the
courts was hard to give up. But
the reasons given by our ad
ministration for so doing are
wise, compassionate and maybe
should be printed once more in
the Daily.
The efforts by some to subvert
the decision are not admirable. I
ask that the feathers stay on the
bird, the three types of red-hot
Indian T shirts be worn else
where than at Stanford and that
the Dollies find other "accepta
ble" headdresses for the Big
Game.
