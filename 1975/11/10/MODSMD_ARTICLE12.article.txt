# Why Alice didn't
## 
### 
On Oct. 29, the working
women of the United States un
ited their efforts to participate in
"Alice Doesn't Day." The pur
pose of this strike (sponsored by
the National Organization for
Women) was to prove, by
boycotting labor of any kind,
female strength in the working
forces. It was promptly labeled a
failure. Why?
In recent times of prosperity,
namely the 19605, many move
ments were on the brink of their
flights to success — that is, rec
ognition and understanding of
their cause resulting in a gradual
change in society.
The women's movement was
at the top of that list. But just as
the dollar began its devaluation,
so the interest in numerous
movements declined.
Immediately, citizens became
preoccupied with their own
state of being and the mere
thought of considering alterna
tions in lifestyles was almost a
luxury.
The majority of people no
longer had the energy to gener
ate interest in 'causes.' They
were too worried where their
next meal was coming from.

As a result, the women's
movement, in many essential re
spects, remains in a 'holding pat
tern.'
Although invisible to the
naked eye, this silent period of
growth is the actual sustenance
of the movement itself. Its posi
tion at this time, will determine
the nature of its flight in the fu
ture.
Now, an increasing number of
people are realizing, maybe con
tinually so, that without
women's participation in the
economy, there would be no
economy. The society would
cease to exist without women's
cooperation, not only in the
working world, but also at home,
where women's participation is
not yet fully recognized.
Perhaps in comparison with
some of the more flamboyant
methods of protest in the 19605,
'Alice Doesn't Day' appeared to
be a failure because it was a
sophisticated form of dissent.
It is precisely this reason why
'Alice Doesn't Day' was a suc
cess.

women's participation in the
economy, there would be no
economy. The society would

Perhaps in comparison with
some of the more flamboyant

'Alice Doesn't Day' appeared to
be a failure because it was a
sophisticated form of dissent.
It is precisely this reason why
'Alice Doesn't Day' was a suc
cess.
