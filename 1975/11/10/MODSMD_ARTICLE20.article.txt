# Pre-kick moments foggy for Langford
## 
### RON BECK 
LOS ANGELES—If you could
have heard Mike Langford in the
locker room describing his feel
ings before he kicked the win
ning field goal against USC, you
would think he was crazy.
"There wasn't too much time
to think. 1 just went in and
kicked it,"he said. "I was pretty
relaxed, though. I didn't feel
much pressure."
But when asked how the time
out Stanford had called right be
fore the kick affected him, Lang
ford responded "Time out?
There was a time out?"
Apparently the final moments
of Stanford's incredible 13-10
upset victory of the Trojans
were hazy in Langford's mem
ory. But it was all clear to fresh
man defensive back Savann
Thompson, whose interception
of a Trojan pass with less than
two minutes to play set up
Langord's kick. Thompson had
earlier been beaten by USC
flanker Junior Lee for the
Trojan's only touchdown.
Making amends
"I felt I had to make it up to the
team." he recalled. "After my
lapse 1 had to play all out for the
rest of the game. 1 couldn't have
lived if we ended up tying or los

ing."
Head Coach Jack Christiansen
understood the torture Thomp
son was feeling after giving up
the touchdown. "It was good for
him to make that key intercep
tion. He's young, and if he hadn't
made that, all he would have re
membered about this game
would have been (the) touch
down, which was his responsi
bility."
"Our defense gets the credit
for the victory," Christiansen
continued. "They played their
asses off. They hustled. They hit.
"We told them before the
game that if they didn't hit USC
at the line of scrimmage, their
backs would be gone. We hit
(Ricky) Bell as powerfully as I've
ever seen in all my years of
coaching and playing. Our de
fense just hung in there."
In fact, of Bell's 35 total car
ries, two went for no gains and
on ten attempts he was dropped
for losses. Defensive end Duncan
McColl, whose eight solo and
two assisted tackles led the
Cards, said, "In big games like
this, you play your heart out."
Different mood
The Trojans were decidedly
less joyous in their locker room,
as they realized that the Rose
Bowl would have to wait until
next season. "Stanford played
well all day," grumbled IJSC
Coach John McKay, "and we
didn't."
Ricky Bell complimented the
Stanford defense. "They were
the second best defense we've
faced all year, after Notre Dame,"
the nation's leading rusher
commented. "They're probably
better than Cal."
Trojan quarterback Vince
Evans agreed with Bell. "Yeah,
they're second only to Notre
Dame. We anticipated that
they'd be tough, but we weren't
ready for this."
"We made a lot of mistakes
that we should never have
made," Evans added.
McKay was more blunt. In re
ference to a fourth-down play
with less than five minutes in the
game on which the Trojans
failed to get a first down, McKay
said,"lt really doesn't matter be
cause we probably would have
messed up the next play any
way."

him to make that key intercep
tion. He's young, and if he hadn't
made that, all he would have re
membered about this game
would have been (the) touch
down, which was his responsi
bility."
"Our defense gets the credit
for the victory," Christiansen
continued. "They played their
asses off. They hustled. They hit.
"We told them before the
game that if they didn't hit USC
at the line of scrimmage, their
backs would be gone. We hit
(Ricky) Bell as powerfully as I've
ever seen in all my years of
coaching and playing. Our de
fense just hung in there."
In fact, of Bell's 35 total car
ries, two went for no gains and
on ten attempts he was dropped
for losses. Defensive end Duncan
McColl, whose eight solo and
two assisted tackles led the
Cards, said, "In big games like
this, you play your heart out."
Different mood
The Trojans were decidedly
less joyous in their locker room,
as they realized that the Rose
Bowl would have to wait until
next season. "Stanford played
well all day," grumbled IJSC
Coach John McKay, "and we
didn't."
Ricky Bell complimented the
Stanford defense. "They were
the second best defense we've
faced all year, after Notre Dame,"
the nation's leading rusher
commented. "They're probably
better than Cal."
Trojan quarterback Vince
Evans agreed with Bell. "Yeah,
they're second only to Notre
Dame. We anticipated that
they'd be tough, but we weren't
ready for this."
"We made a lot of mistakes
that we should never have
made," Evans added.
McKay was more blunt. In re
ference to a fourth-down play
with less than five minutes in the
game on which the Trojans
failed to get a first down, McKay
said,"lt really doesn't matter be
cause we probably would have
messed up the next play any
way."
LOS ANGELES—If you could
have heard Mike Langford in the
locker room describing his feel
ings before he kicked the win
ning field goal against USC, you
would think he was crazy.
"There wasn't too much time
to think. 1 just went in and
kicked it,"he said. "I was pretty
relaxed, though. I didn't feel
much pressure."
But when asked how the time
out Stanford had called right be
fore the kick affected him, Lang
ford responded "Time out?
There was a time out?"
Apparently the final moments
of Stanford's incredible 13-10
upset victory of the Trojans
were hazy in Langford's mem
ory. But it was all clear to fresh
man defensive back Savann
Thompson, whose interception
of a Trojan pass with less than
two minutes to play set up
Langord's kick. Thompson had
earlier been beaten by USC
flanker Junior Lee for the
Trojan's only touchdown.
Making amends
"I felt I had to make it up to the
team." he recalled. "After my
lapse 1 had to play all out for the
rest of the game. 1 couldn't have
lived if we ended up tying or los

ing."
Head Coach Jack Christiansen
understood the torture Thomp
son was feeling after giving up
the touchdown. "It was good for
him to make that key intercep
tion. He's young, and if he hadn't
made that, all he would have re
membered about this game
would have been (the) touch
