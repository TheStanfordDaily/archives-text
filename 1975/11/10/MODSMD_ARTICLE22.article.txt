# Poloists split in Los Angeles

I.OS ANGELESâ€”Stanford
seems to have a tradition for
dramatic finishes. Of course the
first thing you think of is this
weekend's 13-10 Stanford vic
tory over USC, on a Mike Lang
ford field goal, with only sec
onds remaining. But the Cardi
nal waterpolo team has also set
up a very exciting season end
ing, as it split its Southern
California doubleheader this
weekend. Stanford fought back
from a 6-3 deficit, but threw the
ball away with 4(J* seconds left
and lost to UCLA on Friday, 7-6,
but got revenge by beating USC,
11-7, the next day.
The Bruins' victory at the ex
pense of the Cards snapped,
Stanford's 16 game win streak,
but more important dropped
Stanford to 4-1 in the Pacific-
Eight and a first place tie with
UCLA. And so, the Big Game
weekend will be even bigger for
the pyloers as they meet Califor
nia on November 22. This
matchup is the all-or-nothing
game for the Cards. A win will
most likely send Stanford to the
NCAA.
"1 didn't want it to come down
to our last game of the season,
but the guys knew what they had
to do against UCLA," said Coach
Art Lambert. "We had too many
mental lapses and just played
like we didn't want to win."
10 ejection fouls
What compounded the team's
below-par play was the numer
ous fouls, some totally inevi
dent, that were called against
them by the referees. This re
sulted in a total of ten ejection
fouls, with Marty Davis being
thrown out of the game midway
through the fourth quarter. Ac
cording to Lambert, half ot the
fouls that were called he did not
see, but that was no excuse for
his team's play.
Stanford found itself behind
early, at 3-1 midway through the
second quarter, as the Cards mis
sed scoring opportunities on
three separate occasions when
they had a man advantage. The
teams then exchanged goals for a
4-2 halftime margin. Stanford's
two first half tallies came from a
ten foot bullet from Paul Clark
and a Drew McDonald score
with one and a half minutes re
maining in the half.
Stanford pulled back to 4-3 on
a a Doug Burke penalty shot in
the third period but two UCLA
scores within a minute shut the
lid at 6-3. Stanford made one last
effort, however, to keep their
win streak alive with goals by
Clark, Davis, and J. P. Roberts to

make the score 7-6, but the Cards
mistakes caught up with them as
they threw the ball and the game
away with 40 seconds left when
they had a chance for the tie.
The Cards did not play ex
ceedingly better at USC, but then
again the conditions were not
quite that inspiring. The USC
pool resembled something out of
an Edgar Allan Poe novel, as
gargoils lined the four corners of
the pool. It didn't take the Cards
long to make it even more of a
nightmare for the Trojans. The
closest USC got to the Cards was
3-2 in the second quarter, before
Stanford exploded by as much as
a three goal advantage, at 9-5.
Davis and Burke led a well
balanced Stanford offense with
three goals apiece.
"I'm just glad to get out of
here," said Lambert after the
game, "but we have a lot to talk
about with the way we played
this weekend."
"We have one big one left. Cal
has all their men back from the
Pan-American games and
they're only one game behind us
in the loss column, so they'll be
ready for us. "
