Booters win
Inspired by its largest crowd
of the season, Stanford's soccer
team edged Cal, 2-1, in Stanford
Stadium Saturday.
Playing their own "Big
Game," the Cards captured the
Pellas trophy (soccer's equival
ent of The Axe) before 2000 fans
"We played great," Coach Bert
Baldaccini said after the game.
The Cards outshot andouthus
tled Cal, picking on the Bears'
goalie, who Baldaccini called
"shaky."
Center-forward Phil Wright
tallied the first goal early in the
first half, drilling in a shot from
about 30 feet out.
Cal came back with a goal from
Jim Carlson, but Mac Taylor won
the game for Stanford, when he
took a perfect throw-in from Jim
Melamed, and flicked the ball
into the goal.
The game was marked by
countless foul calls, but halfback
Robby Robb noted "We were
tired, and when you're tired,
there's a tendency to lag behind
your man and foul him."
Friday, the Cards lost 4-0 to
Simon Fraser, a Canadian Col
lege, that forward Glenn Christ

ofori called, "a team that would
be in the top ten in the U.S."
After the game, hordes of
pre-pubescent fans swarmed the
field, getting autographs from
their heroes.

the end, it was the Cards who
managed to put the points on the
scoreboard.

eroom at halftime leading by a

comfortable 28-13 margin, and
never was in trouble in the sec
ond half.,.
Next Friday's game at Gal's

Booters win
Inspired by its largest crowd
of the season, Stanford's soccer
team edged Cal, 2-1, in Stanford
Stadium Saturday.
Playing their own "Big
Game," the Cards captured the
Pellas trophy (soccer's equival
ent of The Axe) before 2000 fans
"We played great," Coach Bert
Baldaccini said after the game.
The Cards outshot andouthus
tled Cal, picking on the Bears'
goalie, who Baldaccini called
"shaky."
Center-forward Phil Wright
tallied the first goal early in the
first half, drilling in a shot from
about 30 feet out.
Cal came back with a goal from
Jim Carlson, but Mac Taylor won
the game for Stanford, when he
took a perfect throw-in from Jim
Melamed, and flicked the ball
into the goal.
The game was marked by
countless foul calls, but halfback
Robby Robb noted "We were
tired, and when you're tired,
there's a tendency to lag behind
your man and foul him."
Friday, the Cards lost 4-0 to
Simon Fraser, a Canadian Col
lege, that forward Glenn Christ

ofori called, "a team that would
be in the top ten in the U.S."
After the game, hordes of
pre-pubescent fans swarmed the
field, getting autographs from
their heroes.

the end, it was the Cards who

comfortable 28-13 margin, and
never was in trouble in the sec
