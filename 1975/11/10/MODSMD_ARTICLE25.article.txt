# Pac-8 roundup
## UCLA, Cal win 
### CHRIS BAKER 
UCLA quarterback. John Sci
arra failed to complete the one
pass that he threw against
Oregon, while California quar
terback Joe Roth threw for a
record-breaking 380 yards
against Washington, but the
Bruins and Bears along with
Stanford are still in the Rose
Bowl Race.
The Bruins ran inside, inside
and outside a leaky Oregon de
fense for 479 yards and a 50-17
rout. Sciarra. with 109 yards
rushing; Wendell Tyler, 125 and
Eddie Ayers 89; just followed
behind Coach Dick Vermeil's
two offensive lines.
Cher in Berkeley, the Golden
Bears showed that they can win
without Chuck Munice. Muncie
sprained an ankle in the first
quarter and missed 21 minutes,
but he still ran for 87 yards.
Best passing game
Without Muncie, Cal went to
the air displaying its best single
passing game ever. Roth com
pleted 24 of 36 passes for 380
yards. Cal's offense, number one
in college football, gained 522
yards to the Huskies' 286, but
despite the Colden Bears' impre
ssive offensive performance,
Washington almost won the
game.
With a 27-24 lead late in the
fourth quarter, Roth threw an in
terception. his fourth of the sea
son, to give Washington one
more chance.
But the Huskies failed to take
it in. On a fourth down from the
Cal 24-yard line. Washington
coach Don James went for the
touchdown. The Dogs failed to
score and Cal came away with a
27-24 win.
If Washington had managed to
tie Cal, Stanford could have tied
Cal in the Big Came and still
gone to the Rose Bowl "Our
kicker's range has been from
about the 20," said James. "It
was a must win game for us. A tit;
wouldn't have helped." Well it

would have helped someone
else.
Dogs eliminated
Cal now has a 5-1 record going
into the Big (lame. They take a
break from Pac-8 action next
week, traveling to the Air Force
Academy to take on the Cadets in
a meaningless game. Washing
ton is now 3-2 and has been
eliminated from the conference
race.
Maybe Dee Andros should
have retired at the start of the
season. Andros. who last week
announced his retirement, won
his final gameat home,a 7-0 win
over Washington State.
The Cougars fumbled twice
and threw an interception to
give the Beavers the win. OSU
killed the Cougars' last drive
with an interception as time ran
out. It was the Beavers' first win
of the season, while Washington
State drops to 2-7.
It you're still wondering about
the Rose Bowl math, here it is.
Rose Bowl math
—If UCLA wins its next two
games against Oregon State and
USC, it will go to the Rose Bowl,
regardless of what happens to
the other teams.
—California must defeat Stan
ford in tin; Big (lame on Nov. 22
in Stanford Stadium and hope
USC beats UCLA the following
week.
—Stanford must defeat the
Colden Bears in the Big Came
and then hope USC heats UCLA
the next week.
