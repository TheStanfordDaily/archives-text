AGADIR, Morocco — King Hassan II announced

colony to the United Nations, which U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt VValdheim had proposed
earlier as a temporary solution.

legations involving Internal Revenue Service

Franco's health improves
MADRID, Spain — Gen. Francisco Franco was
reported making "positive progress" yesterday, 48
hours after his second major abdominal operation
in four days. His doctors said they were astonished.
Although under sedation and still listed in "very
grave" condition, Franco, who will be 83 next
month, appeared to be pulling back again from the
brink of death. Though holding out no hope of
recovery, his medical bulletins reported no post
operative threats or complications.
Dr. Manuel Hidalgo Huertas, at Franco's side
since he fell ill three weeks ago, denied published
reports that he had cut out most of Franco's
stomach Friday night after finding a cancer there.
Fromme allowed back in court
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Lynette Fromme gets a
chance to return to court today if she promises to
stop disrupting her trial with demands that con
victed mass murderer Charles Manson be allowed
to testify.
Fromme, 27, is charged with attempting to assas
sinate President Ford as he walked near the
California Capitol. She is a devout follower of Man
son, who was convicted with four other female fol
lowers in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate
and six other persons, and has insisted that her trial
is meaningless without him.
"I can't put on my defense without Manson,"
Fromme said during Friday's court session, and she
interrupted the prosecution's opening statement to
warn, "It's gonna get bloody" unless Manson is
allowed t j leave prison to testify.
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Macßride
banished Fromme from court Friday and said she
could no longer serve as her own attorney. He ap
pointed John Virga, whom Fromme fired as her

Co-counsel last Tuesday, as defense attorney for the
remainder of the trial.
Attack disrupts Lisbon rally
LISBON, Portugal — Premier Jose de Azevedo
condemned spreading political violence yesterday,
then was forced to abort a speech when a pro
government rally dissolved in a volley of tear gas
grenades and gunshots. Portugal's armed forces
remained on alert status for a second day.
He had been addressing a pro-government crowd
of about 20,000 for nearly an hour when banners
caught on fire and tear gas grenades, possibly deto
nated by an opponent of the regime, went off.

Franco's health improves
MADRID, Spain — Gen. Francisco Franco was
reported making "positive progress" yesterday, 48
hours after his second major abdominal operation
in four days. His doctors said they were astonished.
Although under sedation and still listed in "very
grave" condition, Franco, who will be 83 next
month, appeared to be pulling back again from the
brink of death. Though holding out no hope of
recovery, his medical bulletins reported no post
operative threats or complications.
Dr. Manuel Hidalgo Huertas, at Franco's side
since he fell ill three weeks ago, denied published
reports that he had cut out most of Franco's
stomach Friday night after finding a cancer there.
Fromme allowed back in court
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Lynette Fromme gets a
chance to return to court today if she promises to
stop disrupting her trial with demands that con
victed mass murderer Charles Manson be allowed
to testify.
Fromme, 27, is charged with attempting to assas
sinate President Ford as he walked near the
California Capitol. She is a devout follower of Man
son, who was convicted with four other female fol
lowers in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate
and six other persons, and has insisted that her trial
is meaningless without him.
"I can't put on my defense without Manson,"
Fromme said during Friday's court session, and she
interrupted the prosecution's opening statement to
warn, "It's gonna get bloody" unless Manson is
allowed t j leave prison to testify.
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Macßride
banished Fromme from court Friday and said she
could no longer serve as her own attorney. He ap
pointed John Virga, whom Fromme fired as her

Co-counsel last Tuesday, as defense attorney for the
remainder of the trial.

Franco's health improves
MADRID, Spain — Gen. Francisco Franco was
reported making "positive progress" yesterday, 48
hours after his second major abdominal operation
in four days. His doctors said they were astonished.
Although under sedation and still listed in "very
grave" condition, Franco, who will be 83 next
month, appeared to be pulling back again from the
brink of death. Though holding out no hope of
recovery, his medical bulletins reported no post
operative threats or complications.
Dr. Manuel Hidalgo Huertas, at Franco's side
since he fell ill three weeks ago, denied published
reports that he had cut out most of Franco's
stomach Friday night after finding a cancer there.
Fromme allowed back in court
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Lynette Fromme gets a
chance to return to court today if she promises to
stop disrupting her trial with demands that con
victed mass murderer Charles Manson be allowed
to testify.
Fromme, 27, is charged with attempting to assas
sinate President Ford as he walked near the
California Capitol. She is a devout follower of Man
son, who was convicted with four other female fol
lowers in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate
and six other persons, and has insisted that her trial
is meaningless without him.
"I can't put on my defense without Manson,"
Fromme said during Friday's court session, and she
interrupted the prosecution's opening statement to
warn, "It's gonna get bloody" unless Manson is
allowed t j leave prison to testify.
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Macßride
banished Fromme from court Friday and said she
could no longer serve as her own attorney. He ap
pointed John Virga, whom Fromme fired as her

Co-counsel last Tuesday, as defense attorney for the
remainder of the trial.
