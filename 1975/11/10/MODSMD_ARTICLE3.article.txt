## Hearst competent for trial 
### 
Patricia Hearst was found compe
tent to stand trial last Friday, a ruling
based in part on a psychiatric report by
Assistant Psychiatry Prof. Donald
Lunde.
Hearst goes to court today for ar
raignment on federal bank robbery
charges following the ruling by U.S.
District Judge Oliver J. Carter.
Carter said the reports of Lunde and
two other court appointed psychiat
rists "provided a psychiatric profile of
what is clearly a troubled young
woman," but that "in the aggregate
they warrant the conclusion that the
defendant is competent to stand trial."
Lunde said in his report, "It is my
opinion that she has a rational as well

charges and proceedings against her."
Hearst is charged with helping
members of the Symbionese Libera

branch of $10,690 in Sacramento nine
weeks after her kidnapping.
'Diminished' ability
"It is my opinion that she is compe

defense, but that her ability to do so is
somewhat diminished because of the
nature of her present emotional state,"
Lunde said.
Hearst was "able to describe the
bank robbery charge and seemed con
versant with the fact that there was a

distinction between this federal
charge and other possible state
charges," according to Lunde.
Carter said that Lunde, Dr. Seymour
Pollack and court appointed
psychologist Margaret Singer agreed
that their examinations revealed no
evidence of psychosis or other mental
disease or defect that would deprive
Hearst of competency.
Court appointed psychiatrist Louis
West disagreed. He said she found

Hearst suffering from a "traumatic
neurosis" evidenced by a spotty, hazy
memory and that she was unable to
fully cooperate in her defense.
Voluntary memory lapses?
Carter said, "The reports of Lunde
and Pollack evidence their disagree
ment with Dr. West's diagnosis of an
involuntary memory lapse on the part
of the defendant." Pollack indicated
her memorv lapses could be voluntarv
