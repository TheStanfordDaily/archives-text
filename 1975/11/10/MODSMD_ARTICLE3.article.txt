## Hearst competent for trial 
### 
Patricia Hearst was found compe
tent to stand trial last Friday, a ruling
based in part on a psychiatric report by
Assistant Psychiatry Prof. Donald
Lunde.
Hearst goes to court today for ar
raignment on federal bank robbery
charges following the ruling by U.S.
District Judge Oliver J. Carter.
Carter said the reports of Lunde and
two other court appointed psychiat
rists "provided a psychiatric profile of
what is clearly a troubled young
woman," but that "in the aggregate
they warrant the conclusion that the
defendant is competent to stand trial."
Lunde said in his report, "It is my
opinion that she has a rational as well
as a factual understanding of the
charges and proceedings against her."
Hearst is charged with helping
members of the Symbionese Libera
tion Army (SLA) rob a Hibernia Bank

branch of $10,690 in Sacramento nine
weeks after her kidnapping.
'Diminished' ability
"It is my opinion that she is compe
tent to cooperate rationally in her own
defense, but that her ability to do so is
somewhat diminished because of the
nature of her present emotional state,"
Lunde said.
Hearst was "able to describe the
bank robbery charge and seemed con
versant with the fact that there was a

distinction between this federal
charge and other possible state
charges," according to Lunde.
Carter said that Lunde, Dr. Seymour
Pollack and court appointed
psychologist Margaret Singer agreed
that their examinations revealed no
evidence of psychosis or other mental
disease or defect that would deprive
Hearst of competency.
Court appointed psychiatrist Louis
West disagreed. He said she found

Hearst suffering from a "traumatic
neurosis" evidenced by a spotty, hazy
memory and that she was unable to
fully cooperate in her defense.
Voluntary memory lapses?
Carter said, "The reports of Lunde
and Pollack evidence their disagree
ment with Dr. West's diagnosis of an
involuntary memory lapse on the part
of the defendant." Pollack indicated
her memorv lapses could be voluntarv
to avoid incriminating statements.
Pollack said Hearst was "realisti
cally cautious about describing those
SLA experiences that might incrimi
nate her and most of her present reluc
tance to discuss these events is now
conciously controlled."
West's report contained evidence
that Hearst "can recall specific details
of her experience," up to the time of
the bank robbery, said Carter.
"It nevertheless ascribes her confu
sion as to names and events fol
lowing that period to an emotional de
bility. It is hard to reconcile — and Dr.
West does not convincingly explain —
the apparent selective quality of the
defendant's memory during this
period," said the judge.
Though Carter held that Hearst was
competent to stand trial, he did not
suggest that she is not in need of
psychiatric therapy. He said Hearst
could receive such treatment by a
psychiatrist of her own choosing. The
treatment must be given in the San

Mateo County Jail where she is now
being held and not in a private hospital
as advocated by Hearst's attorneys.
Therapy encouraged
"In reaching the decision that the
defendant is presently competent, the
court does not mean to intimate that
she is not in need of psychiatric
therapy. The court encourages the
commencement and continuation of
such treatment," said Carter.
Hearst will appear in court today to
enter her plea to the armed bank rob
bery charges and have a trial date set.
Her attorneys are expected to ask that
trial be delaved until next vear.
