# Vandalism investigated by police
## 
### DAVE ANSLEY 
The Stanford police are investigat
ing a suspect in connection with a rash
of recent vandalism acts on campus.
No charges have been filed in the case,
which involves ten separate incidents
reported last week.
Most incidents involved damage to
cars, including broken windows and
snapped-off antennas and wipers.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton said he believes broken windows
in Jordan and Zapata are also con
nected to the case. There are several
reasons to believe the vandalism was
possibly committed by one individual.
He said reports of damage came from
a relatively small area — from the
Cowell Cluster, Stern and part of the
Row.
Also, the vandalism occurred dur
ing a short time span, from Monday
night to Wednesday, although some of
the reports weren't received until
Thursday, Herrington said.
'Not atypical'
"It's not atypical that someone goes
out and raises a lot of trouble one even
ing. They get drunk or something and
run down streets banging on win
dows," he added.
Wine bottles were found near the
scenes of at least two incidents. The
Zapata window was broken when a
bicycle was thrown through it.
The suspect, whom Herrington
would not identify, was apprehended
on Tuesday but was released because
of a lack of incriminating information.
'Same person'
"We're still looking at the same per
son as a suspect in the case. There may
be more than one person involved, but
we don't know," Herrington said.
Three people were reported running
from the scene of the Jordan breakage.
A Jordan resident grabbed one, but he
broke away. The three then ran in the
direction of Stern.
Herrington reported that the inves
tigation is continuing. "Some evi
dence is being examined by a crime
laboratory and there are other leads we
are pursuing ourselves." However, he
added, "Any results are liable to take a
while. It could be a couple of weeks
before we have any information, or
anyone is charged."
