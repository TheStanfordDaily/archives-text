# Former official decries China policy
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
John Service, former State Department official,
stated Friday night that America is "following a
dangerous, shortsighted policy" in regard to China.
Service spoke before a packed Annenberg Au
ditorium audience of almost 300 on "The Shanghai
Communique: U.S.-China Relations Since Nixon's
Visit," He discussed American relations with the
Peking and Taiwan governments.
Service said, "really little has changed" since the
Shanghai Communique was issued in February.
1972 by President Richard Nixon and the People's
Republic of China.
"There are now liaison offices in Washington and
Peking, but neither has true diplomatic
status: . . . China does not have the most-favored
nation status for trade and hasn't been given any

export credits," Service said.
Service remarked that on the other hand, the U.S.
still has the 1954 defense treaty with Taiwan,
which ended the American policy of recognizing
the territorial integrity of China. The U.S. is also
still giving cash credits and participating in cash
sales of military surplus with Taiwan.
"We have a higher priority for Taiwan than the
mainland; we don't challenge that Taiwan is a part
of China but our continuing relations (with
Taiwan) challenge this," Service explained.
He said that, in addition to trade, China wants
some sort of agreement with the U.S. about Russia.
"One of the reasons China won't discuss the
Taiwan situation is that China is really concerned
with Russia, so they won't break with the U.S. over
Taiwan," noted Service.

Service also commented that "(Secretary of State
Henry) Kissinger sees all foreign relations as a bar
gaining process. Washington wants them to get so
mad that they'll bargain, but the Chinese won't
play."
Service said he expects no immediate change in
American policy. "Zero will be accomplished by
(President) Ford's visit next month and no one ex
pects anything."
Service also talked about Ford's recent Cabinet
and staff changes.
"It's interesting that (Secretary of Defense James)
Schlesinger wanted better relations with China. It
doesn't matter who replaces (U.S. emissary to Pek
ing George) Bush because Kissinger handles per
sonally relations with any country of strategic im
portance," said Service.

"There are now liaison offices in Washington and
Peking, but neither has true diplomatic
status: . . . China does not have the most-favored
nation status for trade and hasn't been given any

export credits," Service said.
Service remarked that on the other hand, the U.S.
still has the 1954 defense treaty with Taiwan,
which ended the American policy of recognizing
the territorial integrity of China. The U.S. is also
still giving cash credits and participating in cash
sales of military surplus with Taiwan.
"We have a higher priority for Taiwan than the
mainland; we don't challenge that Taiwan is a part
of China but our continuing relations (with
Taiwan) challenge this," Service explained.
He said that, in addition to trade, China wants
some sort of agreement with the U.S. about Russia.
"One of the reasons China won't discuss the
Taiwan situation is that China is really concerned
with Russia, so they won't break with the U.S. over
Taiwan," noted Service.

Service also commented that "(Secretary of State
Henry) Kissinger sees all foreign relations as a bar
gaining process. Washington wants them to get so
mad that they'll bargain, but the Chinese won't
play."
Service said he expects no immediate change in
American policy. "Zero will be accomplished by
(President) Ford's visit next month and no one ex
pects anything."
Service also talked about Ford's recent Cabinet
and staff changes.
"It's interesting that (Secretary of Defense James)
Schlesinger wanted better relations with China. It
doesn't matter who replaces (U.S. emissary to Pek
ing George) Bush because Kissinger handles per
sonally relations with any country of strategic im
portance," said Service.
