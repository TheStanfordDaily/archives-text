# Committee forms to find new dean
## 
### 
A search committee for a new dean
of undergraduate studies will be
formed within a few weeks. The com
mittee will consist of five faculty
members and three students.
The new dean will replace Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs,
whose resignation becomes effective
Aug. 31, 1976. Gibbs, who will then
take a year long sabbatical, will return
to teach in the Anthropology Depart
ment in 1977.
Provost William Miller, who is or
ganizing the search committee, has
talked to the University Committee on
Committees about choosing faculty
representatives. He has also asked the
ASSU Committee on Nominations to
recommend three students.
ASSU Vice President Dave Galligan,
chairman of the ASSU Committee on
Nominations, said, "when the provost
first started talking to us, he wanted
the search committee to have five fa

culty members and two students. After
some lobbying ... we ended up get
ting three student representatives on
the committee."
Interviewing students
The committee is interviewing stu
dents who have worked closely with
the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies in the past. It will
submit nominations at the ASSU Se
nate meeting tonight.
The search committee, when or
ganized, will formulate its own criteria
for the selection process.
However, budget constraints and
the inability to offer tenure to an ad
ministrator limit the search to Stanford
faculty members, according to Pat
Kirk, administrative assistant to the
provost.
She added, "The provost feels there
is no compelling reason to look out
side of the University. He is working
under the assumption that there are
several people on campus who are al
ready qualified."
Provost's choice
The committee will submit a list of
candidates to the provost by late Feb
ruary or early March. He will then
select the new dean from that list.
The new undergraduate dean will be
working in closer conjunction with the
provost. According to Provost Miller's
remarks to the Faculty Senate on Oct.
16, he is following the recommenda
tions of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies and appointing the
undergraduate dean as a vice provost
also.
"The added office will supposedly
increase the prestige of the Office of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies in
the University," explained Galligan.
"It will also give the new dean more
control over the allotment of money."
