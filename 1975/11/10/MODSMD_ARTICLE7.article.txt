# Flicks still popular despite price jump
## 
### STEVEN CRANE 
Although one-third fewer season
passes were sold this year than last
year, attendance figures for the
ASSU Sunday Flicks have re
mained exceptionally high in spite
of a 50 percent increase in the ticket
price, according to Flicks Manager
Lunda Helmstadter. Since the 75
cent price isn't keeping many peo
ple at home on Sunday night, she
said it is making the Flicks very luc
rative for the ASSU.
According to incomplete figures
released by Helmstadter, the first
six showings have already netted
about $2742. With six films remain
ing, the Flicks could easily earn a
total of $5400 this fall for the ASSU,
as long as the average $450 per film
profit margin continues, she said.
Helmstadter said the Flicks cur
rently enjoy a 20 percent rate of re
turn.
Although the Flicks may be mak
ing big bucks this fall, Helmstadter
said she still believes the price hike
was warranted. "Without a 75 cents
admission this summer," she
claims, "we would have lost bet
ween $1300 and $1700 due to gen
erally low attendence. And to have
broken even, we would have had to
charge 69 cents. As it was, we only

made about $500 total profit for the
whole summer."
Last spring, the Flicks showed a
$600 deficit, and barely broke even
last winter quarter. Helmstadter
said the losing trend could only
have been reversed by raising the
price.
However, an ASSU Senate finan
cial report submitted last winter by
former Flicks Manager Rocky
Barber indicated the Flicks had
earned $1720 in the three quarters
prior to spring. Thus, even with the
$600 loss, the Flicks probably still
managed to finish the year over
$1000 in the black.
Some of the additional profits
generated by the higher price have
been spent on such things as a $550
popcorn machine, which Helm
stadter said was needed to provide
Flick-goers with fresh popcorn.
An estimated $300 of refresh
ments stolen from a closet in
Memorial Auditorium last week
have also drained some of the pro
fits.
Most of the new-found monies
have gone into the general ASSU
"services" such as Special Events,
the Lecture Note Service and the
Travel Service.


MONEY'S NO OBJECT —Despite ticket price increases, people are still turning out for the ASSU Sunday
Flicks in large numbers. With the price increase, the Flicks are in the black financially and making
money.
ASSU vice President Dave Calligan
said he was pleasantly surprised that
the new rate is making a considerable
profit. Citing rumors that the Univer
sity may slash the ASSU budget as
much as 50 percent next year in re
sponse to an overall money pinch the
University now faces, Galligan said
that Flicks profits could ease the fund
ing cut, if it comes.
The question remains, though,
whether the traditionally break-even
Flicks should make a profit at all.
In a memo to the ASSU Senate dated
January 15, 1975, former ASSU Finan
cial Manager Frank Olivieri suggested
that if the Flicks' operating reserves
were sufficiently high, the ASSU
should "use future profits to effect
price reductions for services per
formed."
If Olivieri's suggestion were to be
he?eded, the Flicks would require an
alternative pricing scheme.

Although one-third fewer season
passes were sold this year than last
year, attendance figures for the
ASSU Sunday Flicks have re
mained exceptionally high in spite
of a 50 percent increase in the ticket
price, according to Flicks Manager
Lunda Helmstadter. Since the 75
cent price isn't keeping many peo
ple at home on Sunday night, she
said it is making the Flicks very luc
rative for the ASSU.
According to incomplete figures
released by Helmstadter, the first
six showings have already netted
about $2742. With six films remain
ing, the Flicks could easily earn a
total of $5400 this fall for the ASSU,
as long as the average $450 per film
profit margin continues, she said.
Helmstadter said the Flicks cur
rently enjoy a 20 percent rate of re
turn.
Although the Flicks may be mak
ing big bucks this fall, Helmstadter
said she still believes the price hike
was warranted. "Without a 75 cents
admission this summer," she
claims, "we would have lost bet
ween $1300 and $1700 due to gen
erally low attendence. And to have
broken even, we would have had to
charge 69 cents. As it was, we only

made about $500 total profit for the
whole summer."
Last spring, the Flicks showed a
$600 deficit, and barely broke even
last winter quarter. Helmstadter
said the losing trend could only
have been reversed by raising the
price.
However, an ASSU Senate finan
cial report submitted last winter by
former Flicks Manager Rocky
Barber indicated the Flicks had
earned $1720 in the three quarters
prior to spring. Thus, even with the
$600 loss, the Flicks probably still
managed to finish the year over
$1000 in the black.
Some of the additional profits
generated by the higher price have
been spent on such things as a $550
popcorn machine, which Helm
stadter said was needed to provide
Flick-goers with fresh popcorn.
An estimated $300 of refresh
ments stolen from a closet in
Memorial Auditorium last week
have also drained some of the pro
fits.
Most of the new-found monies
have gone into the general ASSU
"services" such as Special Events,
the Lecture Note Service and the
Travel Service.


MONEY'S NO OBJECT —Despite ticket price increases, people are still turning out for the ASSU Sunday
Flicks in large numbers. With the price increase, the Flicks are in the black financially and making
money.
ASSU vice President Dave Calligan
said he was pleasantly surprised that
the new rate is making a considerable
profit. Citing rumors that the Univer
sity may slash the ASSU budget as
much as 50 percent next year in re
sponse to an overall money pinch the
University now faces, Galligan said
that Flicks profits could ease the fund
ing cut, if it comes.
The question remains, though,
whether the traditionally break-even
Flicks should make a profit at all.
In a memo to the ASSU Senate dated
January 15, 1975, former ASSU Finan
cial Manager Frank Olivieri suggested
that if the Flicks' operating reserves
were sufficiently high, the ASSU
should "use future profits to effect
price reductions for services per
formed."
If Olivieri's suggestion were to be
he?eded, the Flicks would require an
alternative pricing scheme.
