# For bi-lingual voting
## 
### 
It seems incredible that An
drew Bridges' Nov. 4 Daily
column stated that the Justice
Department's order to offer
bilingual ballots "opens the door
to severe fragmentization of our
society."
He contends that it is the so
cial obligation of a citizen to
know his country's official lan
guage. Bridges thus implies that
to speak any language but En
glish in the U.S. is to be "un-
American."
In that case we should wish
Bridges the best of luck in learn
ing the English language. Ac
cording to the Funk & Wagnalls
Standard College Dictionary of
1963 there is no such word as
"fragmentization."
Careless errors or illiterate
pomposity aside, Bridges' basic
assumption is that the av
ailabiity of ballots written only
ih English would serve as an in
centive to learn English. In order
to vote, he would mandate that
people have to know the lan
guage.
Bridges thus assumes firstly
that people want to vote and
subsequently that non-English
speaking people share that same
interest in voting.
Few persons vote
" Yet few people are registered
to vote and only a portion of re
gistered voters participates in
any given election.
One can instead contend that
the greatest incentive to learn
English stems not from a desire
to use the ballot box but from the
difficulties of living day-to-day
in an English-speaking society.
Bridges himself wrote that "if
one expects to function as a citi
zen, one must know thecommon
language well enough to act as a
citizen."
If someone has no desire to
learn English for use in his daily
life, why should that person
want to learn it simply to vote in
an electoral system perhaps as
foreign to him or to her as the
language on the ballot?
Incentives fail
It would seem that the incen
tives to vote have not generated
an overwhelming response. In
stead of freezing out people who

have difficulty in understanding
the ballot, we might do better
and help to integrate them into
our society through the voting
booth.
Perhaps if those people be
come interested in the political
system, they will become more
interested in t other aspects of
society and be more strongly
motivated to learn English.
Bridges would have us believe
that a minority of people voting
maybe once a year threatens to
destroy some sort of slender
thread of "nationality" unifying
this country.
It is only another step to say
that everyone must also be cul
turally identical and that any
thing different or foreign
threatens a shared nationality.
Factor of unity
It would seem on the contrary
that an increased interest and
participation in society which
could result from the use of
bilingual ballots are unifying
and not divisive factors.
Bridges should note that the
new law applies only to lan
guages spoken by more than five
percent of the electorate; in San
Francisco ballots would be writ
ten in English, Spanish, and
some form of Chinese.
Bridges' final point claims
that the use of bilingual ballots
may have "ominous" implica
tions. If citizens could not un
derstand English, then they
would not be responsible for ob
serving a law written just in En
glish.
Laws not read
Since when do most people
ever bother to read laws? Some
people even contend that our
country's laws are not written in
English but in "legalese."
Bridges concludes by moan
ing that "our law code would
have to be translated into every
conceivable language to satisfy
the needs of all citizens."
This country claims ideals of
doing just that â€” serving the
needs of all citizens, whether
through bilingual drivers' hand
books. bilingual education or
bilingual ballots.
