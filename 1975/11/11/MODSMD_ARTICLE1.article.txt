Spevak emphasized that the commit

suggestions from faculty and students.
"If there are any feelings positive or

THE HOLY GRAIL—If you want Big Game tickets, you'd
better get in line today. A great many students,aalumni
and fans were out purchasing tickets yesterday. "We're

speaker.
"No single group of students or fa
culty can have the final say," Rosenz
weig added. "But somebody has to
make a final decision,, and that re
sponsibility ultimately rests with Pres
ident (Richard) Lyman."
Availability important
Rosenzweig, a committee member,
said, "We haven't ruled anybody out
yet." Rosenzweig indicated that the
possibilities will be narrowed down
according to their availability, speak
ing ability, and interest appeal.
The selection committee expects to
come up with a final rating of prospec
tive speakers which will be submitted
to Lyman for final approval, according
to Assistant to the President William
Stone, another committee member.
"We hope to finalize the decision
soon so that we don't lose our choice to
any of the other 2000 other schools we
are competing with for speakers." said
Stone.
Woody Allen had been overv\holm

ingly the leading choice for com
mencement speaker in a poll con
ducted by the senior class officers dur
ing registration in September.
Students and the Administration
have argued over whether Allen's ap
pearance at commencement exercises
would detract from the seriousness of
the ceremony.
According to Stone and Rosenz
weig, Allen's secretary had been con
tacted and indicated that Allen would
have no desire to speak at any college
commencement exercises. If this is
true, then the possibility of having
Allen is "highly improbable," accord
ing to Rosenzweig.
The Selection Committee will meet
again Thursday, at which time names
in consideration will be reduced to a
more workable number.
