Kudos for Band
Editor:
Michael Roberts' criticism of
the Stanford Band (Daily. Nov.
5) are ones we would expect to
hear in Ann Arbor, University
Park. Los Angeles or Corvallis,
but not in Palo Alto. '
The Band has accurately
characterized the mood of this
campus since the anti-war years,
and it probably developed its
remarkable anti-establishment
character at that time.
It has dared to be different
from the puppet bands and
marching tin soldiers we see at
those football factories of the
Midwest and South.
The Band has dared to mock
this society's norms and make
fun of its often blundering gov
ernment through formations and
music. This great band is a tri
bute to this great University and
we should encourage its deter
mined resolution, rather than
giveit an "official reprimand"as
Roberts would have us do.
Furthermore, Roberts' state
ment that the Band "is to blame
for a lot of the hard feelings bet
ween students and participating
athletes" is an insult to
Stanford's students. Are not
Band members students?
If memory serves, it wasn't just
the Stanford Band that booed in
recent games when Jack Christ
iansen, Mike Cordova, et al,
managed to botch another game.
Would Roberts have us re
primand the student body as
well?
Have you tried Bakersfield
State, Roberts? 1 understand it

has a wholesome looking and
sound band that plays all the
"right" music and never insults
anyone.

Editor:
Michael Roberts should be
ashamed of himself!
In the framework of his col
umn, he indulges in every vile
and contemptible action that he
accuses the Band of.
He makes me wonder if
perhaps the middle-class sense
of justice isn't a bit out of kilter.
The Band does not create stu
dent apathy. Rather, it attempts
to overcome the inherent lack of
student spirit by presenting an
interesting and entertaining
show.
It is too much to expect that it
will always be successful in this
enterprise. It is, after all, an
amalgam of egocentric, imma
ture college students, as Roberts
himself has stated. I like the
Stanford Band. My status as a
member of the Band tends to
push me in that direction.
I look forward to continuing to
bring irreverence to the overly
sanctimonious social phenome
non of football. I am sorry that
he doesn't share my feelings,
but I would like to suggest that
he make his future criticism con
structive, rather than inane.

Commencement
Editor:
I have been following with

some interest the current con
troversy over the 1976 com
mencement speaker, and I am
disappointed to learn that the
Daily has taken a typically snide,
sarcastic, insensitive and gener
ally destructive view of the situ
ation.
I, for one, am quite sympathe
tic to University administrators
when they say they don't want
Woody Allen as the speaker.
After all, last June they managed
to attract Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a buffoon of truly in
ternational stature. Why should
they settle for anything less this
year?
We alumni simply do not un
derstand the continual carping
over this issue by the senior
class. What's the matter with you
kids?
Your refusal to listen to a great
statesman like Moynihan while
baking your brains out in 100
degree heat for the greater glory
of the University is an all-too
common symptom of the im
maturity of this younger genera
tion. You've had it too soft, that's
all.
The fact that you've invested
$14,000 in tuition over the past
four years hardly gives you the
right to participate in such
high-level decision-making.
I urge everyone involved in
this silly protest to lend a more
understanding ear to the ad
ministrators. After all. for years
and years they've handled dif
ficult and perplexing questions
like parking and the housing
draw in a fashion that should
convince evervone of their sin

cerity, not to mention intellig
ence.

Yellow journalism
Editor:
Recently the Daily has printed
some articles and columns of
doubtful taste. We refer specifi
cally to the "Under Covers" col
umn by Dave Ansley and Jack
Hall's feature entitled "In search
of the ultimate rub."
Are the graphic questions and
descriptions in "Under Covers"
intended to help people with
genuine sexual problems? If so,
we question the authority of
Ansley to advise in these per
sonal matters.
This job requires the compe
tency of a trained professional. If
they are intended solely for
humor, we question their appeal
to the audience of a newspaper
with the diverse circulation of
the Daily.
Yellow journalism such as "In
search of the ultimate rub" won't
increase the Daily's popularity
or circulation. We think its read
ers would rather see these spaces
used to cover some of the many
interesting, informative campus
events and stories of human in
terest.
Normally we enjoy reading
the Daily. Ironically. Hall's sec
ondary headline. "True confes
sions," might be a more approp
riate title for an otherwise fine
publication.

Open Hanna House
Editor:
The house recently donated by
the Hannas to Stanford is of great
architectural interest, but at pre
sent very few of us have any
chance of seeing it.
Also, there has been discus
sion about the cost of maintain
ing it. With these points in mind
I would like to suggest that the
University open the house for a
short time for all to charge ad
mission. The profits could go to
maintaining the house.
If this is a success, the house
could be opened in the future
when it is empty between oc
cupants.

Inaccurate article
Editor:
I would like to comment on
certain discrepancies in the arti
cle which appeared in the Nov. 6
Daily concerning the issue of
additional financial aid for
minority students.
First, the article seems to
imply that I made statements in
February regarding employment
which were contradicted the fol
lowing month.
The article fails to note that the
statements to the American As
sociation for the Advancement
of Science were made in Feb.
1974, not 1975; and the state
ments made in March, were
made in March. 1975, more than
12 months later.
More importantly, the article
fails to point out that the state
ments on the one hand related to
employment throughout the IJn

ited States and that the later
statements were made in respect
to black students graduating
from Stanford.
The statements quoted in the
article were taken from the con
text of two separate studies per
taing to two different sets of data
regarding separate subjects.
