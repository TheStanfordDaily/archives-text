# Bonfire defense given

Recent articles attacking the
bonfire have, unintentially or
otherwise, clouded the facts and
confused the issue.
Much of the abuse taken by the
bontire and its supporters is
based on unfounded attacks by
uninformed sources. Failure of
the bonfire's opponents, espe
cially those of the stature of
Council of President member
Lee Rosenbaum, to acquaint
themselves with the facts on this
issue is appalling.
In an attempt to balance the
scales l would like to present the
following facts:
—It has been argued that the
bonfire should not be supported
financially by the University,
though it is fairly well known
that the bonfire has a positive
public relations effect regarding
the local community.
In fact, this is one of the big
gest community relations events
of the year. This hardly seems to
classify the bonfire as "com
pletely wasteful."
—The bonfire is the only
University-wide event where
students have the opportunity to
meet each other and have a good
time (unless you consider foot
ball games a meeting ground —
which is questionable, at best).
—The scum around the lake
this spring was attributed by
some misinformed people to last
year's bonfire.
This is a totally unfounded ac
cusation. Simple observation of
the lake the previous two years,
when the scum existed and the
bonfire didn't, should be enough
to confute this ridiculous argu
ment.
After last year's bonfire, an
environmental specialist did
survey the area. He found dam
age to the environment to be neg
ligible.
—It has been argued that the
bonfire is artificial and un
natural. Suffice it to say that
Lake Lagunita itself is man
made.
—Opponents of the bonfire
point to the recent letter from the
Bay Area Pollution Board asking
that an alternative be devised. It
should be stressed that this re
quest was based on complaints
by private citizens who thought
the bonfire polluted too much.
No mention is made whether
these complaints have even the
slightest basis. In light of last
year's environmental survey, I
sincerely doubt it.
—The bonfire has been at
tacked as being solely a frater
nity activity.
This is interesting in light of
the fact that people like Brian
Brause (freshman. Cardenal) are
not only members of the commit
tee. but are responsible for a
number of important activities.
Jim Polk (senior, Soto) is also an
active member of the committee.
Future non-fraternity addi
tions to the committee are wel
come at any time.
—It has been argued that no
altenative to the bonfire has been
sought. This is also fallacy.
In fact, at the first meeting of
the bonfire committee this very
possibility was with the rep
resentatives of Theta Chi being
the leading advocates of an al
ternative. Simply, no satisfac
tory alternative could be de
vised.
In light of these facts, rational
opposition to the bonfire fades
away. Only prejudiced, political
attacks remain.
