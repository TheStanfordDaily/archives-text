## From felafel sandwiches to journalism lecturer Marion Lewenstein juggles teaching, writing and family 
### LAURA KENNEDY 
Marion Lewenstein never sits
down — not unless she has a
typewriter, a newspaper or a
felafel sandwich in front of her.
And while teaching her class
on editorial techniques here,
Lewenstein, a lecturer in the
Communication Department,
never sits down. Instead of
placidly lecturing, she juggles
interviewing tips and her
philosophy on journalism with
personal critiques of last week's
assignment.
In the same adept manner,
Lewenstein juggles teaching
with the demands of her family
and the one to 10 articles a
month she continues to write as
a freelance writer.

Before she received her ap
pointment to Stanford this
summer, Lewenstein had just as
busy a schedule. She ran the
still-thriving Mediterranean
Sandwich Shop in Palo Alto
which specializes in Arab felafel
sandwiches.
Restauranteur
Lewenstein first dreamed of
opening her own restaurant
when she was an 18-year-old
waitress. After she was married,
she encountered Arabian food
while on a family trip to Israel.
With the same precision she
might use in researching an arti
cle, Lewenstein calculated the
success rates of restaurants, con
sulted a former editor at Sunset
magazine and finally opened a

small shop. After three years, she
sold the restaurant to a former
Stanford Business School
graduate.
However, Lewenstein's first
love remains journalism. She
says that being a reporter has
been"the aim of my life as far
back as lean remember."
Lewenstein, 48, also had her
first contact with journalism at
18 when she became a secretary
for the Women's Wear Daily
branch of Fairchild Publications
in San Francisco. Her only ex
perience in the garment industry
had been as a clerk in a store back
in her native Cleveland, and as a
secretary with a garment man
ufacturer.
Nevertheless, in nine months

she became a reporter for
Women's Wear Daily. Even as a
cub reporter, she got to interview
such luminaries as Nelson Rock
efeller and Andrei Gromyko,
who were negotiating trade ag
reements of importance to the
garment industry.
Glamour wore off
However, Lewenstein says,
"The glamour of being a fashion
reporter at 19 soon wore
off . . . What I really enjoyed was
hard news."
She was able to cover both
fashion and hard news by
switching to another Fairchild
publication, Home Furnishings
Daily. She worked there for
seven years.
Lewenstein's specialty now is
not fashion, but science writing.
After she married her engineer
husband, Harry, in 1955, "I
wanted to work in the same field
as my husband," she says. She
persuaded her reluctant pub
lishers that a woman without an
engineering background could
cover science, and started to
work for Electronic News
shortly after her marriage .
When her first child, Bruce,
was born in 1958, Lewenstein
says,"I thought 1 was quitting
forever to become a mother with
a capital 'M'."
Freelancing
Although she had a daughter.
Bailey, five years later, Lewens

tein continued tofreelance, writ
ing for such publications as Post
Graduate Medicine, Electronics
Weekly, Fortune and Time. She
still continues writing while she
is teaching.
Lewenstein, who never went
to college herself, says she en
joys her teaching job "more than

I would have anticipated." Her
appointment is only for a year,
subject to renewal.
Lewenstein considers the new
crop of journalism students as
"better trained and much more
conscious of the amount of in
formation that's out there," but

adds that they do not emphasize
proper grammar and spelling
enough.
As for her own class, Lewens
tein does not let them forget her
own simple requirement for a
good writer: "I admire those who
are able to say what they want to
say."

awhile — next to her typewriter, of course.
