Are there any radio stations in
this area which broadcast that
excellent British radio comedy
series, "The Goon Show"? If so,
who and when? Does any station
broadcast other British comedy
programs, such as "My Word" or
"fust A Minute"?-P.T.
KQED does broadcast "The
Coon Show" on Mondays at 4:30
p.m. and again on Fridays at 9:30
p.m. We couldn't locate the
other two shows.

Why are there no lighted tennis
courts on campus? Will there
ever be?-A.M.
Like everything else, the ques
tion of lighted tennis courts is
"just a matter of money," accord
ing to Coach Dick Could. The
University has considered light
ing the courts, and has even had
a price estimate figured for the
Lag, Encina and varsity (three
championship and eight lower)
courts. Providing adequate (but
not championship) lighting for
these courts would cost approx
imately $5000 per court, Could
said. However, he did add that
the project is under serious con
sideration.
★ * *
Whenever we change from stan
dard to daylightsavings lor
back), we are supposed to set our
clocks ahead or back at 2 a.m.
Why 2 a.m.? Who made this
decision?-K.A.
The date and time of the be
ginning of daylightsavingstime
are set by the U.S. Congress. The
2 a.m. cut-off was chosen simply

to avoid confusion, according to
an aide at Rep. Paul McCloskey's
office. Since most people are in
bed at this time, the hour can
jump forward or backward al
most unnoticeable. Were it sud
denly to become 4 at 3 in the
afternoon (or 3 at 4 in the after
noon) things might get a little
mixed-up.
* * *
Why are the street lights always
turned on, even during the day
time, around the law school? I
thought that we were trying to
save money. -M.C.W.
We are, accordng to Jason
Mavis, director of plant services.
He was surprised to hear that the
lights did stay on, and promised
to get them turned off im
mediately. The University out
side lights are on time clocks,
which often break, Mavis said.
He would appreciate being
notified by anyone who spots
lights which are on in the day
time.
* * *
What is the average course load
of a Stanford student? J.W.
The Registrar's office says that
the average student completes
about 16 units per quarter.

FOOTNOTE: Anne Saplin, in
the General Secretary's Office,
recommends another place for
alterations on suede and leather.
The woman is a dressmaker
named Trudie, and her shop is
located on the second floor of the
Stanford Barn.

Nestled in a small corner of the
Daily office, the official "Bug
Me" desk isn't hard to find. We
have a diverse and willing staff
which is always ready to
thoroughly research even the
most trivial question. So please
bug us. Send your questions to

The date and time of the be
ginning of daylightsavingstime
are set by the U.S. Congress. The
2 a.m. cut-off was chosen simply

to avoid confusion, according to
an aide at Rep. Paul McCloskey's
office. Since most people are in
bed at this time, the hour can
jump forward or backward al
most unnoticeable. Were it sud
denly to become 4 at 3 in the
afternoon (or 3 at 4 in the after
noon) things might get a little

Why are there no lighted tennis
courts on campus? Will there
ever be?-A.M.
Like everything else, the ques
tion of lighted tennis courts is
"just a matter of money," accord
ing to Coach Dick Could. The
University has considered light
ing the courts, and has even had
a price estimate figured for the
Lag, Encina and varsity (three
championship and eight lower)
courts. Providing adequate (but
not championship) lighting for
these courts would cost approx
imately $5000 per court, Could
said. However, he did add that
the project is under serious con
sideration.
