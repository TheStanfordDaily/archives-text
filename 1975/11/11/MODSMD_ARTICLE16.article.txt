# No effective male chemical contraceptive for another 10 years, researcher predicts
## 
### DAVE SARTORIS 
Development of an effective
chemical contraceptive for men
is at least 10 years away, accord
ing to Dr. Charles Alvin Paulsen,
professor of medicine and
chairman of the Department of
Endocrinology at the University
of Washington.
Paulsen, one of the nation's
most prominent research an
drologists, was a guest lecturer
in the course "Biosocial Aspects
of Birth Control" last week.
"There are three basic ap
proaches to the problem of male
contraception. One can attempt
to interfere with sperm matura
tion, inhibit gonadotropin se
cretion, or inhibit sper
matogenesis directly."
He added that any acceptable
drug must guarantee full recov
ery of fertility upon termination
of its use.
Paulsen discussed the results
of a recent NIH-funded study

done under his direction at the
University of Washington
School of Medicine. One combi
nation of daily oral doses of
Danazol and monthly testos
terone injections yielded re
duced sperm counts in 85 per
cent of subjects and complete
azoospermia in 23 percent.
Side effects avoided
"I consider this a viable ap
proach to male fertility control.
Not only was complete reversi
bility obtained, but side effects
common to earlier chemical
methods, such as loss of libido,
weight gain, blood clotting and
nervous system disorders, were
avoided," he commented.
However, Paulsen added that
large doses of Danazol were re
quired for absorption by the
small intestine, making the cost
of this method rather high.
A follow-up study is now un
derway, with the hope of obtain

ing sufficient hard data toformu
late a benefit/risk ratio.
"We presently plan to do
pharmacological studies and
clinical trials with this method.
If the product proves to be effec
tive, studies will be initiated on
rhesus monkeys or baboons.
Field testing in human males is
at least 10 years distant, how
ever," said Paulsen.
The University of Washington

research team is presently the
only group investigating male
chemical contraception in the
United States. Studies have been
conducted at laboratories in
West Berlin, New Delhi and Au
stria, and two other American
institutions recently received
funding for male contraceptive
research.
"The New Delhi group is ex
perimenting with an anti

androgen compound which ap
pears to inhibit sperm penetra
tion of the cervical mucous,"
said Paulsen.
The future for non-chemical
male contraception is also bleak,
according to Paulsen.
"The National Institute of
Health has terminated all grants
for reversible vasectomy studies,
since this method produced un
favorable results in animal trials.'

Side effects avoided
"I consider this a viable ap
proach to male fertility control.
Not only was complete reversi
bility obtained, but side effects
common to earlier chemical
methods, such as loss of libido,
weight gain, blood clotting and
nervous system disorders, were
avoided," he commented.
However, Paulsen added that
large doses of Danazol were re
quired for absorption by the
small intestine, making the cost
of this method rather high.
A follow-up study is now un
derway, with the hope of obtain

ing sufficient hard data toformu
late a benefit/risk ratio.
"We presently plan to do
pharmacological studies and
clinical trials with this method.
If the product proves to be effec
tive, studies will be initiated on
rhesus monkeys or baboons.
Field testing in human males is
at least 10 years distant, how
ever," said Paulsen.
The University of Washington

research team is presently the
only group investigating male
chemical contraception in the
United States. Studies have been
conducted at laboratories in
West Berlin, New Delhi and Au
stria, and two other American
institutions recently received
funding for male contraceptive
research.
"The New Delhi group is ex
perimenting with an anti

androgen compound which ap
pears to inhibit sperm penetra
tion of the cervical mucous,"
said Paulsen.
The future for non-chemical
male contraception is also bleak,
according to Paulsen.
"The National Institute of
Health has terminated all grants
for reversible vasectomy studies,
since this method produced un
favorable results in animal trials.'

STILL LOOKING —Researchers have yet to find an effective chem
ical contraceptive for men, according to Dr. Charles Alvin
Paulsen, professor of medicine and chairman of the Department of
Endocrinoloby at the University of Washington. Lecturing in the
"Biosocial Aspects of Birth Control" course last week, Paulsen
predicted that the development of such a contraceptive is at least
10 years away.

"There are three basic ap

He added that any acceptable
drug must guarantee full recov

of its use.
Paulsen discussed the results
of a recent NIH-funded study

done under his direction at the
University of Washington
School of Medicine. One combi
nation of daily oral doses of
Danazol and monthly testos
terone injections yielded re
