# Eggs may not be harmful for most healthy people

SACRAMENTO (AP) — New
research at the University of
California at Los Angeles seems
to indicate that eggs won't hurt
you if you're healthy and don't

have a cholesterol problem —
which most people don't.
Under the present state mar
keting order for egg producers,
which expires Dec. 31, the state

Egg Advisory Board financed a
$20,000 research project at
UCLA, headed by nutritionist
Roslyn Alfin-Slater and her hus
band biochemist Grant Slater.
Slater said there was some
slight evidence that coronary
heart disease may not be caused
by high cholesterol, even though
there is a positive corollation be
tween the two.
"There's a question of cause
and effect. Maybe something
else is damaging the blood ves
sels, and cholesterol accumu
lates as a protective
mechanism," he said.
Most egg producers say they
are having one of the worst, if not
the worst, year in history.
