## In the Nitery 'Spring': a good sign of life 
### MEG WALKER 
The Stanford Drama Department's pre
sentation of Spring Awakening, a play by
Frank Wedekind, shows the imagination,
intensity and depth of a very successful
production. The strength of the acting and
the inventiveness of the staging relieve
Wedekin's rather heavy symbolism and
long length.
Spring Awakening follows the develop
ment of adolescent youths as they explore
and try to understand their natural instincts
and sexual nature.
Set in the late lßth century amid all
the provincialism and trivialities of a very
traditional society, this task leads to some
complicated and often confusing scenes.
However, the play focuses on the tragic
outcome that the youths must suffer in exp
loring their relationships and instincts; as a
result Spring Awakening has a powerful
impact.
Inquisitive youth
Warren Motley shows appropriate ele
ments of frustration and sincerity in his por
trayal of Melchior Gabor. An inquisitive
youth possessing a very philosophical
temperament, Melchior is condemned as a
moral degenerate by his narrow minded
teachers and parents.
Motley's earnest and sensitive acting
shows Melchior's determination to find out
"what we're really supposed to be doing in
this world." With his strong acting, Motley
refuses to let his character be daunted by a

distorted society and shows that he must
struggle until he finds the truth.
Melchior does indeed manage to retain
his freedom of spirit as compared with his
troubled schoolmate Moritz Steifel, played
by David Martel Bryant. Moritz exists shak
ily in two worlds; he cannot reconcile the
dictatorial academic world that he forces
himself to keep up with and the natural
world of sensual pleasures that he is so fas
cinated but ashamed by.
Bryant achieves just the right amount of
intensity when he shows how Moritz is the
victim of his false education and is driven to
suicide. In a death scene that could easily
have been overacted, Bryant conveys such a
sense of realism and inevitable despair that
one is easily ashamed and almost feels re
sponsible for the restrained and purist soci
ety Moritz is surrounded by — a warning
that Wedekind was aiming for in the lesson
of his play.
Reunion
Motley and Bryant reunite Melchior and
Moritz in a graveyard scene that borders on
the grotesque and supenatural. Here the two
actors show the technique and concentra
tion that is so valuable in preventing the
play from alienating the audience.
The coordination that Motley and Bryant
display throughout the play is brought to a
climax here as Melchior decides to keep
struggling through life and leaves Moritz
trying to convince himself-he is happy ob
serving humans struggle in their confusion.

Most of Melchior's struggling involves
his encounters with Wendla Bergmann.
played by Amy Klatzkin. Klatzkin gives her
character all the innocence and vivacity
needed to show the dangers of a society
flooded with provincialism and conven
tion — the audience can easily relate to the
tragedy of Wendla's early and unnecessary
death.
Too studied
Though Klatzkin's energy is essential in
her portrayal perhaps it disappears at times
into traditional stage acting; her intensity
tends to be too studied.
The play calls for numerous scene
changes —a procedure that could interfere
with the progress of the acting. The prob
lems of staging are all avoided by the use of
simple and inventive props and the unclut
tered stage allows the audience to focus on
the meaning of the action.
The heaviness of the play is relieved by
bits of ironic humor coupled with imagina
tive acting. One scene in particular, which
takes place in the staff room, shows just
such creativity. A group of arrogant profes
sors parade into the classroom where they
plan to question Melchior; they are so over
whelmed by their passion for the mundane
and trivial that the whole scene is a medley
of vigorous nodding and passionate stutter
ing.
Spring Awakening is being
presented in the Nitery and will continue
through Saturday.
