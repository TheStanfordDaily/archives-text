# Study recommends use of female staff to help rape victims through interviews

### LAURA KENNEDY 
A year-long study on rape by the Palo Alto Police
Department and a private consulting firm recom
mended that specially trained female investigators
be available to help rape victims deal with the
police department, hospital and district attorney.
The study, released earlier this week, was based
on interviews with 68 rape victims, some of whom
were Stanford students.
Only 35 of the victims had reported their rapes to
the police, according to Sgt. Mike Mee of the Palo
Alto Police Department (PAPD).
The PAPD already allows rape victims to specify
the interviewer's sex but women reporting a rape to
the Stanford Police Services (SPS), may have a
female interviewer only if a female officer is serving
on that shift.
Chief Marvin Herrington of the SPS said that if a
male officer thought an "assault and battery" were

actually a rape, he would call in a policewoman —
if a woman were on duty at that time.
Women officers
The SPS employs three women out of a deputized
force of 27. The Palo Alto force of 100 officers in
cludes 11 women. T'he PAPD has no female inves
tigators, but Mee, who worked on the study, said he
is "pretty certain" one will be hired by next year.
However, all women and some men on the PAPD
have had special rape treatment training. The
PAPD is retaining Approach Associates, which did
the study, to train the rest of the force.
Herrington said the Stanford police received
only the rape treatment training taught in basic
training.
The rape victims interviewed for the study gave
the PAPD high ratings, but other county agencies
were criticized. For instance, victims brought to the

Valley Medical Center in San Jose have had to wait
as long as an hour, researchers discovered.
Stanford Medical Center
However, Mee said that most Palo Alto victims
were sent to the Stanford Medical Center, where
they usually do not have to wait. The Center has
introduced special treatment rooms and an evi
dence form to ease the interviewing process for the
victim.
The report pointed out that victims have to repeat
their stories 10 times. Mee said he hoped that bet
ter coordination between agencies would reduce
the need for repetition.
The study also recommended that hospitals
should have a victim care specialist in the
emergency room. Mee said this person would be
"probably a nurse who will have received special
training." He reported that the Stanford Medical
