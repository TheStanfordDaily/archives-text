# Heavy-handed Players' 'Hay Fever' ranks at the bottom of amateur theater
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Amateur and community the
ater groups around Stanford
range from excellent to awful. If
their production of Noel
Coward's Hay Fever is represen
tative, the Woodside Village
Players rank at the bottom.
Even Coward devotees will
sleep through this tedious,
heavy-handed social satire. The
cast emphasizes the play's
weaknesses with feeble charac
terization, stumbling delivery of
lines and mechanical acting.
Coward wrote his oppres
sively vitriolic comedy about the
Bliss family, four boorish Lon
don snobs who manipulate their
guests as amusing pawns.
The family entertains itself by
staging emotional charades of
divorce, marriage and promis
cuity after dinner and forgetting
their bizarre games by breakfast.
Actors in such an acerbic sa
tire must show enough eccen
tricities of character and enough
elan to keep the audience awake.
These barely seem awake them
selves.
All are surprisingly well-cast,
but none seem able to accept the

absurdity of the play enough to
slip into their roles. Perhaps
type-casting, or the irony of pre
senting this play in snobbish,
class-conscious Woodside, has
inhibited them.
At any rate, they perform dra
bly in a play which demands free
characterization.
Predictably, the best of the lot
are the four who play guests in
the Bliss country household:
Chuck Woodruff, Amanda
Reynolds, Anne Buelteman, and
Steven Thurin.
Their characters, all necessar
ily shallow and brittle, still re
tain some aspects of normalcy,
and so are easier to portray.
The members of the family,
cast in neurotically odd roles, all
recite their lines by rote. Indeed,
they sometimes fail even at that
— the production is marred by
an unusual number of muffed
lines, a sign of fast rehearsal and
careless study.
Perhaps it is unfair to chastize
an amateur production so se
verely. But in fairness to the au
dience, only friends and rela
tives of the cast should attend.
They play is not worth the trou
ble for anyone else.

absurdity of the play enough to
slip into their roles. Perhaps
type-casting, or the irony of pre
senting this play in snobbish,
class-conscious Woodside, has
inhibited them.
At any rate, they perform dra
bly in a play which demands free
characterization.
Predictably, the best of the lot
are the four who play guests in
the Bliss country household:
Chuck Woodruff, Amanda
Reynolds, Anne Buelteman, and
Steven Thurin.
Their characters, all necessar
ily shallow and brittle, still re
tain some aspects of normalcy,
and so are easier to portray.
The members of the family,
cast in neurotically odd roles, all
recite their lines by rote. Indeed,
they sometimes fail even at that
— the production is marred by
an unusual number of muffed
lines, a sign of fast rehearsal and
careless study.
Perhaps it is unfair to chastize
an amateur production so se
verely. But in fairness to the au
dience, only friends and rela
tives of the cast should attend.
They play is not worth the trou
ble for anyone else.

Amateur and community the
ater groups around Stanford
range from excellent to awful. If
their production of Noel
Coward's Hay Fever is represen
tative, the Woodside Village
Players rank at the bottom.
Even Coward devotees will
sleep through this tedious,
heavy-handed social satire. The
cast emphasizes the play's
weaknesses with feeble charac
terization, stumbling delivery of
lines and mechanical acting.
Coward wrote his oppres
sively vitriolic comedy about the
Bliss family, four boorish Lon
don snobs who manipulate their
guests as amusing pawns.
The family entertains itself by
staging emotional charades of
divorce, marriage and promis
cuity after dinner and forgetting
their bizarre games by breakfast.
Actors in such an acerbic sa
tire must show enough eccen
tricities of character and enough
elan to keep the audience awake.
These barely seem awake them
selves.
All are surprisingly well-cast,
but none seem able to accept the

absurdity of the play enough to
slip into their roles. Perhaps
type-casting, or the irony of pre
senting this play in snobbish,
class-conscious Woodside, has
inhibited them.
At any rate, they perform dra
bly in a play which demands free
