# 'Hurry Tomorrow' indicts system of mental care
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
How thin is the dividing line between sane and
insane? Aberrant behavior is regarded by those in
power as "crazy," and one has to look no further
than the case of Patty,Tania to see the latest man
ifestation of that attitude.
"That girl must have been crazy to do those
things," is both the popular mythology and a de
fense of the charges against her. However, after
seeing the film Hurry Tomorrow last Wednesday
evening at the New Varsity in Palo Alto, one
might be less inclined to casually commit people
to psychiatric wards at the slightest sign of
aberrant behavior.
The 76-minute documentary by filmmakers
Richard Cohen and Kevin Rafferty was filmed
over a five-week period in a locked ward at Met
ropolitan State Hospital in Los Angeles. During
that time, 25 hours of film was exposed and after
editing, what's left is a powerful indictment of the
current system of handling the psychologically
disturbed.
Not insane
Remember, the people in the film aren't crimi
nally insane, but in many cases realized they had
problems and went looking for help. The "help"
they get in most cases seems to be a large helping
of tranquilizing drugs, given in oral or injection
form.
The patients are then left to shamble about the
ward, watch TV, doze or play ping-pong in bet
ween meals or an occasional conference with the
resident psychiatrist.
How does one get out of the place? According to
the psychiatrist, it's easy. "When they stop asking
to get out, that's when we release them," the doc
tor says in all seriousness.
Forced drugs
If patients don't want the daily dosage of
Thorazine or Proloxin. the dosage is fcfrced on
them. If they resist, they are punished by being
strapped to a bed in an isolated room. It's not a
pretty picture, but there are supposedly many

places that are much worse.
In this ward, the brutality is not so much physi
cal as mental: a psychic brutality of indifference.
The psychiatric technicians who administer the
drugs and the discipline to the patients seem
bored and uncaring, in their own way as oblivious
to the "real" world as the patients. The head doc
tor seems pleased that his ward is orderly and that
no one is beaten or physically abused.
He also seems to feel that all his patients need
some kind of drug to help thein regain their men
tal balance. The idea that drugs could be hinder
ing patients' recovery never enters his mind.
Numbing repetition
All thesefacets ofa mental wardareshown with
no narration, with almost numbing repetition. As
with Frederick Wiseman (the premier maker of
cinema-veritedocumentaries such as Titficut Fol
lies, High School, Welfare).Cohen and Rafferty let
the edited film itself make the points, and it does
score a lot.
Technically, though, it is less impressive.
Sound quality is poor in many of the sequences
and identification of various persons and scenes
flash so briefly on the screen they seem intended
to be subliminal messages more than anything
else.
What the audience is left with then is an hour
plus of cinema that racks up a lot of important
points, but never delivers the clincher. There are
no discussions of any other methods of control
ling, treating or "curing" (if such a thing is possi
ble) the mentally disturbed.
People are seen only in a hospital setting (with
two minor exceptions) and consequently the au
dience is unable to judge just how much help (be
it drugs or whatever) these people need or want.
As a ptolemic against forced drugging and in
difference, the movie succeeds in arousing some
sympathy. Still, it does not give enough evidence
to convict the entire mental health treatment
program beyond a reasonable doubt.

disturbed.
Not insane
Remember, the people in the film aren't crimi
nally insane, but in many cases realized they had
problems and went looking for help. The "help"
they get in most cases seems to be a large helping
of tranquilizing drugs, given in oral or injection
form.
The patients are then left to shamble about the
ward, watch TV, doze or play ping-pong in bet
ween meals or an occasional conference with the
resident psychiatrist.
How does one get out of the place? According to
the psychiatrist, it's easy. "When they stop asking
to get out, that's when we release them," the doc
tor says in all seriousness.
Forced drugs
If patients don't want the daily dosage of
Thorazine or Proloxin. the dosage is fcfrced on
them. If they resist, they are punished by being
strapped to a bed in an isolated room. It's not a
pretty picture, but there are supposedly many

places that are much worse.
In this ward, the brutality is not so much physi
cal as mental: a psychic brutality of indifference.
The psychiatric technicians who administer the
drugs and the discipline to the patients seem
bored and uncaring, in their own way as oblivious
to the "real" world as the patients. The head doc
tor seems pleased that his ward is orderly and that
no one is beaten or physically abused.
He also seems to feel that all his patients need
some kind of drug to help thein regain their men
tal balance. The idea that drugs could be hinder
ing patients' recovery never enters his mind.
Numbing repetition
All thesefacets ofa mental wardareshown with
no narration, with almost numbing repetition. As
with Frederick Wiseman (the premier maker of
cinema-veritedocumentaries such as Titficut Fol
lies, High School, Welfare).Cohen and Rafferty let
the edited film itself make the points, and it does
score a lot.
Technically, though, it is less impressive.
Sound quality is poor in many of the sequences
and identification of various persons and scenes
flash so briefly on the screen they seem intended
to be subliminal messages more than anything
else.
What the audience is left with then is an hour
plus of cinema that racks up a lot of important
points, but never delivers the clincher. There are
no discussions of any other methods of control
ling, treating or "curing" (if such a thing is possi
ble) the mentally disturbed.
People are seen only in a hospital setting (with
two minor exceptions) and consequently the au
dience is unable to judge just how much help (be
it drugs or whatever) these people need or want.
As a ptolemic against forced drugging and in
difference, the movie succeeds in arousing some
sympathy. Still, it does not give enough evidence
to convict the entire mental health treatment
program beyond a reasonable doubt.

STAR ATTRACTIONS—David Martel Bryant as Moritz Steifel and Warren Motley as Melchior
Gabor are part of the reason why the Drama Department's production of Spring Awakening is so
good.
How thin is the dividing line between sane and
insane? Aberrant behavior is regarded by those in
power as "crazy," and one has to look no further
than the case of Patty,Tania to see the latest man
ifestation of that attitude.
"That girl must have been crazy to do those
things," is both the popular mythology and a de
fense of the charges against her. However, after
seeing the film Hurry Tomorrow last Wednesday
evening at the New Varsity in Palo Alto, one
might be less inclined to casually commit people
to psychiatric wards at the slightest sign of
aberrant behavior.
The 76-minute documentary by filmmakers
Richard Cohen and Kevin Rafferty was filmed
over a five-week period in a locked ward at Met
ropolitan State Hospital in Los Angeles. During
that time, 25 hours of film was exposed and after
editing, what's left is a powerful indictment of the
current system of handling the psychologically
disturbed.
