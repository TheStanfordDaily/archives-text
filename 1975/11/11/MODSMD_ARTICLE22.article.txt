# At Winterland
## Starship flies 
### KATHY ROSS 
In a triumphant return to Winterland last weekend, it was hard to
believe that Jefferson Starship had ever been out of the center of the
City's rock culture. As Jefferson Airplane had once acted as
spokesman for the drug-centered Haight/Ashbury world in the
hippie sixties, its reincarnation has met with instant success: two
new top-rated albums, "Dragon Fly" and "Red Octopus," have
carried the group even beyond its former popularity.
The evening opened with "Mirror,"an excellent soul-funk group
featuring the strong, lusty vocals of three women with a sound
similar to that of Laßelle.
Country Joe Mac Donald followed with some excellent cuts from
his recently released album and many of the old hits from the days
of Country Joe and the Fish. The crowd brought him back again and
again, even after a full hour and a half of music.
Highlights
Highlights were "Save the Whales," the opening number, "Oh
Jamaica," a pseudo-reggae tune that speaks of "smoking home
grown and drinking home-brew," and "Breakfast for Two," a long
and tender ballad including excellent guitar and sax solos.
The Winterland crowd consisted mostly of the new, younger
Starship followers lured more by such recent AM and FM hits as
"Miracles" and "Ride the Tiger" than by the memory of the
Airplane's classic "White Rabbit" or "Somebody to Love."
None were disappointed, however, as the Starship played a pow
erful blend of old and new which demonstrated all the diversity of
style that makes each number so exciting.
Impressive
Grace Slick and Marty Balm's insistently expressive voices are
undoubtedly the Starship's greatest assets. Slick, with her dramatic
movements and endless energy, is the one member of Jefferson
Airplane whom no one has forgotten, and her presence was a treat
in itself. Sheshared the vocals with Marty Balin, whosesmooth and
unusual voice held the audience enraptured through such master
pieces as "Miracles" and "There Will Be Love."
Lead guitarist Craig Chaquico's solos were also spellbinding,
especially on some of the new, unreleased cuts, "You're Not
Cuilty" and "Don't Shoot Me Down," and on Dragon Fly's "That's
For Sure."
Sorely missed was Papa John Creach, who plays violin exten
sively on both of the new albums. His absence was not acknow
ledged or explained, but was surely noticed.
