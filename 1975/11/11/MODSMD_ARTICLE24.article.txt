# Absurd Firesign Theatre makes incoherent sense
## 
### KAREN CAESAR 
The humor of the Firesign
Theatre has always been a trifle
off-beat and Saturday night in
Memorial Auditorium half the
Firesign Theatre. Phil Austin
and David Ossman, amused
Stanford audiences (for the fifth
year in a row) with their partially
incoherent craziness.
The "theme" of the show cen
tered around the four legendary
towns of Heater. Hooker. Hell
mouth and Duckburg, Califor
nia, and they spent the entire
evening cruising back and forth,
referring to events previously
mentioned, events not previ
ously mentioned, events that
made no sense and events on
their albums.
The opening portion had Dr.
H. P. Lovecraft (actually Phil
Austin) and his Magical
Medicine Show in an old west
California town displaying mag
ical tricks that were absolutely
incredible and puns that were
absolutely outrageous.
Telling tales of the 2000 year
old "Spe-king man," pushing
his exotic elixir (designed to
make "eyes white, teeth bright,
and childbirth a pleasure") and
revealing that "statistics prove
that four out of five doctors is 80
percent," Lovecraft thoroughly
amazed the audience with his
feats of magic, his verbal trip
ups, his dove that did yoga and
his cream of mushroom cookies.

A travelog-talk show came
next, starring Bob Hind, a rather
kinky host with an indescriba
ble. very slight German(?), but
nonetheless strange, accent. An
interview with Andy Airsock of
Hooker. California, ensued, and
together they pointed out the
more unusual sights in the area,
e.g.. a giant cement dinosaur
with clocks for eyes. (Bob: "Is it a
historical monument?" Andy:
"No, it's a liquor store.")
A much loved Firesign
Theatre character made his ap
pearance when, "From the City
of Angels, out of the smog, into
the ozone," emerged Nick
Danger, private eye.
After a fifteen minute inter
mission, Austin (with guitar)
and Ossman came back on stage
to do a completely unexpected,
half-serious dialogue on Native
Americans. One could say this
was out of place, but when deal
ing with the Firesign, everything
is a little out of place.
However, this little episode
was unusually so. The audience
sat there wondering if they were
still in Mem Aud, not sure
whether or not they were sup
posed to laugh.
This part of the show was con
siderably less successful than
the first part.But it did succeed
in making the audience uncom
fortable, uncertain of the point

and totally confused.
As if they sensed this, they
suddenly reverted back to Hell
mouth and back to their props,
i.e., back to the ridiculous,
where they are most at home.
Satirizing local and national
newscasts (with Harold
Hiphugger and Charles Trust
worthy) and using a game
show format (will you pick Story
no. 1. Story no. 2, or Story no. 3 ?
Let me tell you first a little bit
about Story no. 2 . . . ). they
spoke of the Environmental Re
duction Agency and politician
Kissingrockofordefeller, utiliz
ing the material on Indians and
material from the first part of the
show.
Brought back for an encore
they said they were unprepared
for. Austin and Ossman then
proceeded to push the National
Surrealist Party's candidate for
president, George C. Papoon.
("We know he has the animal
vote.") The' 76 Campoonfor Pa
poon" works out of the 55 local
"cocoons" that have opened up
all over the country. The whole
idea brings back momories of
"Pat Paulsen for President" and
the '68 campoon, uh. campaign.
Firesign Theatre humor is
bizarre but infectious, and Au
stin and Ossman are two ex
tremely witty and talented men
with a pronounced appreciation
and talent for Ihe absurd.

Firesign Theatre humor is
bizarre but infectious, and Au
stin and Ossman are two ex
tremely witty and talented men
with a pronounced appreciation
and talent for Ihe absurd.
The humor of the Firesign
Theatre has always been a trifle
off-beat and Saturday night in
Memorial Auditorium half the
Firesign Theatre. Phil Austin
and David Ossman, amused
Stanford audiences (for the fifth
year in a row) with their partially
incoherent craziness.
The "theme" of the show cen
tered around the four legendary
towns of Heater. Hooker. Hell
mouth and Duckburg, Califor
nia, and they spent the entire
evening cruising back and forth,
referring to events previously
mentioned, events not previ
ously mentioned, events that
made no sense and events on
their albums.
The opening portion had Dr.
H. P. Lovecraft (actually Phil
Austin) and his Magical
Medicine Show in an old west
California town displaying mag
ical tricks that were absolutely
incredible and puns that were
absolutely outrageous.
Telling tales of the 2000 year
old "Spe-king man," pushing
his exotic elixir (designed to
make "eyes white, teeth bright,
and childbirth a pleasure") and
revealing that "statistics prove
that four out of five doctors is 80
percent," Lovecraft thoroughly
amazed the audience with his
feats of magic, his verbal trip
ups, his dove that did yoga and
his cream of mushroom cookies.

A travelog-talk show came
next, starring Bob Hind, a rather
kinky host with an indescriba
ble. very slight German(?), but
nonetheless strange, accent. An
interview with Andy Airsock of
Hooker. California, ensued, and
together they pointed out the
more unusual sights in the area,
e.g.. a giant cement dinosaur
with clocks for eyes. (Bob: "Is it a
historical monument?" Andy:
"No, it's a liquor store.")
A much loved Firesign
Theatre character made his ap
pearance when, "From the City
of Angels, out of the smog, into
the ozone," emerged Nick
Danger, private eye.
After a fifteen minute inter
mission, Austin (with guitar)
and Ossman came back on stage
to do a completely unexpected,
half-serious dialogue on Native
Americans. One could say this
was out of place, but when deal
ing with the Firesign, everything
is a little out of place.
However, this little episode
was unusually so. The audience
sat there wondering if they were
still in Mem Aud, not sure
whether or not they were sup
posed to laugh.
This part of the show was con
siderably less successful than
the first part.But it did succeed
in making the audience uncom
fortable, uncertain of the point

and totally confused.
As if they sensed this, they
suddenly reverted back to Hell
mouth and back to their props,
i.e., back to the ridiculous,
where they are most at home.
Satirizing local and national
newscasts (with Harold
Hiphugger and Charles Trust
worthy) and using a game
show format (will you pick Story
no. 1. Story no. 2, or Story no. 3 ?
Let me tell you first a little bit
about Story no. 2 . . . ). they
spoke of the Environmental Re
duction Agency and politician
Kissingrockofordefeller, utiliz
ing the material on Indians and
material from the first part of the
show.
Brought back for an encore
they said they were unprepared
for. Austin and Ossman then
proceeded to push the National
Surrealist Party's candidate for
president, George C. Papoon.
("We know he has the animal
vote.") The' 76 Campoonfor Pa
poon" works out of the 55 local
"cocoons" that have opened up
all over the country. The whole
idea brings back momories of
"Pat Paulsen for President" and
the '68 campoon, uh. campaign.
