Australian PM dismissed
CANBERRA, Australia — Australia was thrown
into politicalturmoiltoday with the unprecedented
removal of Prime Minister Cough Whitlam by the
governor-general, Sir John Kerr.
In a statement read in Parliament and distributed
to the press, Kerr said Whitlam's inability to get
appropriation bills through Parliament left him no
alternative but to dismiss Whitlam's Labor gov
ernment.
He called on Malcolm Fraser, leader of the oppos
ition Conservatives, to form a caretaker government
until national elections can be held for both the
Senate and House of Representatives.
Kerr is both an appointee of the Labor govern
ment and the representative of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth 11.
Whitlam, responding to his sacking, told the
House of Representatives that he should remain in
office. He argued that the Senate had passed the
controversial appropriations bill and, "there is no
longer a deadlock."
The opposition-controlled Senate had approved
the money bill a few minutes earlier, but only after
Fraser had been named to head a caretaker govern
ment.
It was the first time in Australian history that a
government has been denied funds to govern by a
hostile Senate and the first time a prime minister
was sacked by the governor.-general.
Kissinger knocks Soviets
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer yesterday blamed the Soviet Union for a
serious split that has brought negotiations on a new
neclear arms limitation treaty to a virtual halt.
Kissinger acknowledged in a news conference
that Moscow had rejected the latest American
proposal for an agreement to restrict the number of
nuclear weapons possessed by the two superpow
ers.
He said, "it doesn't mean that the chasm is very
wide or is unbridgeable." However, Kissinger went
on. the United States is not prepared to make
further proposals until the Russians make a serious
response to current U.S. thinking.
"We are prepared to look for an honorable com
promise," the secretary said, "but it is up to the
Soviet Union to be prepared also to make a com
promise."
Kissingeralso told newsmen that there will be no
summit meeting in the United States between Pres
ident Ford and Soviet Communist party leader
Leonid Brezhev until there is a strategic arms limi
tation talks (SALT) treaty.
Judge enters Hearst plea
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge yesterday
entered a plea of innocent for Patricia Hearst and set
Dec. 15 for her trial on federal bank robbery and
weapons charges.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Oliver Carter acted after
Hearst's attorney refused to plead, disputing the
judge's finding that she is competent to stand trial.
Attorney Albert Johnson challenged the judge's
interpretation of psychiatrists' reports on Hearst's
mental state and asked that all the doctors who
examined her be brought to court.
Carter at first balked at the idea, saying he had
already given attorneys the chance to have tes
timony from the doctors, but the counsel refused.
Johnson indicated the defense team had been
certain the judge would draw a ruling of incompe

tency from the reports and was stunned when he
issued his ruling Friday.
"We did not choose to cross-examine the
psychiatrists because we agreed with their find
ings," he said. "Your honor's findings so distorted
those reports that it now requires a hearing."
Hearst, pale and silent throughout the hearing,
smiled at her parents as she entered the courtroom.
It was her first acknowledgement of their presence
at any of her court appearances since her arrest.
Fromme banished again
SACRAMENTO — Lynette Fromme, blindfold
ing herself and forcing a deputy marshal to carry
her into the courthouse, was banished again yes
terday from the court where she is being tried on
charges of trying to kill President Ford.
Meanwhile, jurors were shown how the gun
Fromme allegedly pointed at Ford could have
clicked without a shot being attempted.
The 27-year-old Charles Manson follower re
fused to promise U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Macßride that she would refrain from future dis
ruptions.
Last Friday she was twice removed from the court
after trying to plead guilty and demanding that
Manson be allowed to testify. She also vowed that
she would have to be carried from the jailhouse to
court.
Unions increase donations
WASHINGTON — With election day still nearly
a year away, AFL-CIO unions are making tens of
thousands of dollars in political donations to sup
porters of a controversial bill to increase the bar
gaining power of construction trades unions.
A sample group of 18 AFL-CIO political commit
tees gave a total of $93,495 to 78 House members
who supported the bill when it passed the House
last July, government reports show.
In the Senate, where a filibuster is being waged
against the bill, $15,000 from the same groups went
to Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.), who is head of
the Labor Committee and a sponsor of the bill.
The pattern of giving seems likely to continue as
organized labor gears up its political donations.
In the last few days alone, the carpenters' union,
with $80,000 in its political coffers at last report,
filed official notice of intent to donate money to 24
House members who voted for the bill.
The union listed no intended donations to oppo
nents of the measure.
Election law debated
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court was told
yesterday by proponents of the new election reform
law that it is aimed at stopping an "arms race of
political contributions," but opponents said it cuts
off free speech because, "money talks."
"It is speech," said Justice Potter Stewart during
very close questioning from the bench. "Speech is
money, and money is speech."
In an unusual four and one-half hours of oral
argument on the case, opponents charged that Con
gress stacked the 1974 Federal Elections Campaign
Act in favor of political incumbents and made it
harder for challengers.
Yale Law Prof. Ralph Winter said the law allows
congressmen to send out millions of dollars worth
of politically helpful mail under the franking
privilege while denying the same financial break to
their opponents.

NY gov. makes new proposal
NEW YORK — Gov. Hugh Carey has stitched
together a complex new proposal — involving new
state and city taxes, and help from banks and the
federal government — to keep New York City from
default and stabilize the state's own shaky finances.
New York City residents, who already have the
highest sales taxes in the country, would be faced
with a one-cent sales tax increase, to nine cents on
the dollar.
As state officials worked on the plan yesterday,
Deputy White House Press Secretary William
Greener repeated President Ford's promise to vote
what the President has termed a "bail-out" of New
York City.
The new Carey plan would reduce the minimum
$4 billion in federal loan guarantees previously
sought by the city to
1.5 billion to $2 billion.
To make up the difference, the plan would re
quire heavy support from banks, other investors
and taxpayers.
Kansas City beats Dallas
DALLAS — Kansas City and Dallas fumbled 12
times in their nationally televised stumblethon.
The Chiefs got back three of their mistakes and
pocketed all five of Dallas' gifts, cashing three of
them into touchdowns.
The result was a 34-31 victory over the Cowboys.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Slightly warmer days.
Lows tonight in upper 30s and 40s. Highs today and
tomorrow in the 60s.

Fromme banished again
SACRAMENTO — Lynette Fromme, blindfold
ing herself and forcing a deputy marshal to carry
her into the courthouse, was banished again yes
terday from the court where she is being tried on
charges of trying to kill President Ford.
Meanwhile, jurors were shown how the gun
Fromme allegedly pointed at Ford could have
clicked without a shot being attempted.

Macßride that she would refrain from future dis
ruptions.
Last Friday she was twice removed from the court
after trying to plead guilty and demanding that
Manson be allowed to testify. She also vowed that
she would have to be carried from the jailhouse to
court.
Unions increase donations
WASHINGTON — With election day still nearly
a year away, AFL-CIO unions are making tens of
thousands of dollars in political donations to sup
porters of a controversial bill to increase the bar
gaining power of construction trades unions.
A sample group of 18 AFL-CIO political commit
tees gave a total of $93,495 to 78 House members
who supported the bill when it passed the House
last July, government reports show.
In the Senate, where a filibuster is being waged
against the bill, $15,000 from the same groups went
to Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.), who is head of
the Labor Committee and a sponsor of the bill.
The pattern of giving seems likely to continue as
organized labor gears up its political donations.
In the last few days alone, the carpenters' union,
with $80,000 in its political coffers at last report,
filed official notice of intent to donate money to 24
House members who voted for the bill.
The union listed no intended donations to oppo
nents of the measure.
Election law debated
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court was told
yesterday by proponents of the new election reform
law that it is aimed at stopping an "arms race of
political contributions," but opponents said it cuts
off free speech because, "money talks."
"It is speech," said Justice Potter Stewart during
very close questioning from the bench. "Speech is
money, and money is speech."
In an unusual four and one-half hours of oral
argument on the case, opponents charged that Con
gress stacked the 1974 Federal Elections Campaign
Act in favor of political incumbents and made it
harder for challengers.
Yale Law Prof. Ralph Winter said the law allows
congressmen to send out millions of dollars worth
of politically helpful mail under the franking
privilege while denying the same financial break to
their opponents.

NY gov. makes new proposal
NEW YORK — Gov. Hugh Carey has stitched
together a complex new proposal — involving new
state and city taxes, and help from banks and the
federal government — to keep New York City from
default and stabilize the state's own shaky finances.
New York City residents, who already have the
highest sales taxes in the country, would be faced
with a one-cent sales tax increase, to nine cents on
the dollar.
As state officials worked on the plan yesterday,
Deputy White House Press Secretary William
Greener repeated President Ford's promise to vote
what the President has termed a "bail-out" of New
York City.
The new Carey plan would reduce the minimum
$4 billion in federal loan guarantees previously
sought by the city to
1.5 billion to $2 billion.
To make up the difference, the plan would re
quire heavy support from banks, other investors
and taxpayers.
Kansas City beats Dallas
DALLAS — Kansas City and Dallas fumbled 12
times in their nationally televised stumblethon.

Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Slightly warmer days.
Lows tonight in upper 30s and 40s. Highs today and

Australian PM dismissed
CANBERRA, Australia — Australia was thrown
into politicalturmoiltoday with the unprecedented
removal of Prime Minister Cough Whitlam by the
governor-general, Sir John Kerr.
In a statement read in Parliament and distributed
to the press, Kerr said Whitlam's inability to get
appropriation bills through Parliament left him no
alternative but to dismiss Whitlam's Labor gov
ernment.
He called on Malcolm Fraser, leader of the oppos
ition Conservatives, to form a caretaker government
until national elections can be held for both the
Senate and House of Representatives.
Kerr is both an appointee of the Labor govern
ment and the representative of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth 11.
Whitlam, responding to his sacking, told the
House of Representatives that he should remain in
office. He argued that the Senate had passed the
controversial appropriations bill and, "there is no
longer a deadlock."
The opposition-controlled Senate had approved
the money bill a few minutes earlier, but only after
Fraser had been named to head a caretaker govern
ment.
It was the first time in Australian history that a
government has been denied funds to govern by a
hostile Senate and the first time a prime minister
was sacked by the governor.-general.
Kissinger knocks Soviets
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer yesterday blamed the Soviet Union for a
serious split that has brought negotiations on a new
neclear arms limitation treaty to a virtual halt.
Kissinger acknowledged in a news conference
that Moscow had rejected the latest American
proposal for an agreement to restrict the number of
nuclear weapons possessed by the two superpow
ers.
He said, "it doesn't mean that the chasm is very
wide or is unbridgeable." However, Kissinger went
on. the United States is not prepared to make
further proposals until the Russians make a serious
response to current U.S. thinking.
"We are prepared to look for an honorable com
promise," the secretary said, "but it is up to the
Soviet Union to be prepared also to make a com
promise."
Kissingeralso told newsmen that there will be no
summit meeting in the United States between Pres
ident Ford and Soviet Communist party leader
Leonid Brezhev until there is a strategic arms limi
tation talks (SALT) treaty.
Judge enters Hearst plea
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge yesterday
entered a plea of innocent for Patricia Hearst and set
Dec. 15 for her trial on federal bank robbery and
weapons charges.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Oliver Carter acted after
Hearst's attorney refused to plead, disputing the
judge's finding that she is competent to stand trial.
Attorney Albert Johnson challenged the judge's
interpretation of psychiatrists' reports on Hearst's
mental state and asked that all the doctors who
examined her be brought to court.
Carter at first balked at the idea, saying he had
already given attorneys the chance to have tes
timony from the doctors, but the counsel refused.
Johnson indicated the defense team had been
certain the judge would draw a ruling of incompe

NY gov. makes new proposal
NEW YORK — Gov. Hugh Carey has stitched
together a complex new proposal — involving new
state and city taxes, and help from banks and the
federal government — to keep New York City from
default and stabilize the state's own shaky finances.
New York City residents, who already have the
highest sales taxes in the country, would be faced
with a one-cent sales tax increase, to nine cents on
the dollar.
As state officials worked on the plan yesterday,
Deputy White House Press Secretary William
Greener repeated President Ford's promise to vote
what the President has termed a "bail-out" of New
York City.
The new Carey plan would reduce the minimum
$4 billion in federal loan guarantees previously
sought by the city to
1.5 billion to $2 billion.
To make up the difference, the plan would re
quire heavy support from banks, other investors
and taxpayers.
Kansas City beats Dallas
DALLAS — Kansas City and Dallas fumbled 12

Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Slightly warmer days.
Lows tonight in upper 30s and 40s. Highs today and

Australian PM dismissed
CANBERRA, Australia — Australia was thrown
into politicalturmoiltoday with the unprecedented
removal of Prime Minister Cough Whitlam by the
governor-general, Sir John Kerr.
In a statement read in Parliament and distributed
to the press, Kerr said Whitlam's inability to get
appropriation bills through Parliament left him no
alternative but to dismiss Whitlam's Labor gov
ernment.
He called on Malcolm Fraser, leader of the oppos
ition Conservatives, to form a caretaker government
until national elections can be held for both the
Senate and House of Representatives.
Kerr is both an appointee of the Labor govern
ment and the representative of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth 11.
Whitlam, responding to his sacking, told the
House of Representatives that he should remain in
office. He argued that the Senate had passed the
controversial appropriations bill and, "there is no
longer a deadlock."
The opposition-controlled Senate had approved
the money bill a few minutes earlier, but only after
Fraser had been named to head a caretaker govern
ment.
It was the first time in Australian history that a
government has been denied funds to govern by a
hostile Senate and the first time a prime minister
was sacked by the governor.-general.
Kissinger knocks Soviets
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer yesterday blamed the Soviet Union for a
serious split that has brought negotiations on a new
neclear arms limitation treaty to a virtual halt.
Kissinger acknowledged in a news conference
that Moscow had rejected the latest American
proposal for an agreement to restrict the number of
nuclear weapons possessed by the two superpow
ers.
He said, "it doesn't mean that the chasm is very
wide or is unbridgeable." However, Kissinger went
on. the United States is not prepared to make
further proposals until the Russians make a serious
response to current U.S. thinking.
"We are prepared to look for an honorable com
promise," the secretary said, "but it is up to the
Soviet Union to be prepared also to make a com
promise."
Kissingeralso told newsmen that there will be no
summit meeting in the United States between Pres
ident Ford and Soviet Communist party leader
Leonid Brezhev until there is a strategic arms limi
tation talks (SALT) treaty.
Judge enters Hearst plea
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge yesterday
entered a plea of innocent for Patricia Hearst and set
Dec. 15 for her trial on federal bank robbery and
weapons charges.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Oliver Carter acted after
Hearst's attorney refused to plead, disputing the
judge's finding that she is competent to stand trial.
Attorney Albert Johnson challenged the judge's
interpretation of psychiatrists' reports on Hearst's
mental state and asked that all the doctors who
examined her be brought to court.
Carter at first balked at the idea, saying he had
already given attorneys the chance to have tes
timony from the doctors, but the counsel refused.
Johnson indicated the defense team had been
certain the judge would draw a ruling of incompe

tency from the reports and was stunned when he
issued his ruling Friday.
"We did not choose to cross-examine the
psychiatrists because we agreed with their find
ings," he said. "Your honor's findings so distorted
those reports that it now requires a hearing."
Hearst, pale and silent throughout the hearing,
smiled at her parents as she entered the courtroom.
It was her first acknowledgement of their presence
at any of her court appearances since her arrest.
Fromme banished again
SACRAMENTO — Lynette Fromme, blindfold
ing herself and forcing a deputy marshal to carry
her into the courthouse, was banished again yes
terday from the court where she is being tried on
charges of trying to kill President Ford.
Meanwhile, jurors were shown how the gun
Fromme allegedly pointed at Ford could have
clicked without a shot being attempted.
The 27-year-old Charles Manson follower re
fused to promise U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Macßride that she would refrain from future dis
ruptions.
Last Friday she was twice removed from the court
after trying to plead guilty and demanding that
Manson be allowed to testify. She also vowed that
she would have to be carried from the jailhouse to
court.
Unions increase donations
WASHINGTON — With election day still nearly
a year away, AFL-CIO unions are making tens of
thousands of dollars in political donations to sup
porters of a controversial bill to increase the bar
gaining power of construction trades unions.
A sample group of 18 AFL-CIO political commit
tees gave a total of $93,495 to 78 House members
who supported the bill when it passed the House
last July, government reports show.
In the Senate, where a filibuster is being waged
against the bill, $15,000 from the same groups went
to Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.), who is head of
the Labor Committee and a sponsor of the bill.
The pattern of giving seems likely to continue as
organized labor gears up its political donations.
In the last few days alone, the carpenters' union,
with $80,000 in its political coffers at last report,
filed official notice of intent to donate money to 24
House members who voted for the bill.
The union listed no intended donations to oppo
nents of the measure.
Election law debated
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court was told
yesterday by proponents of the new election reform
law that it is aimed at stopping an "arms race of
political contributions," but opponents said it cuts
off free speech because, "money talks."
"It is speech," said Justice Potter Stewart during
very close questioning from the bench. "Speech is
money, and money is speech."
In an unusual four and one-half hours of oral
argument on the case, opponents charged that Con
gress stacked the 1974 Federal Elections Campaign
Act in favor of political incumbents and made it
harder for challengers.
Yale Law Prof. Ralph Winter said the law allows

Judge enters Hearst plea
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge yesterday
entered a plea of innocent for Patricia Hearst and set
Dec. 15 for her trial on federal bank robbery and
weapons charges.
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Oliver Carter acted after
Hearst's attorney refused to plead, disputing the
judge's finding that she is competent to stand trial.
Attorney Albert Johnson challenged the judge's
interpretation of psychiatrists' reports on Hearst's
mental state and asked that all the doctors who
examined her be brought to court.
Carter at first balked at the idea, saying he had
already given attorneys the chance to have tes
timony from the doctors, but the counsel refused.
Johnson indicated the defense team had been
certain the judge would draw a ruling of incompe

tency from the reports and was stunned when he
issued his ruling Friday.
"We did not choose to cross-examine the
psychiatrists because we agreed with their find
ings," he said. "Your honor's findings so distorted
those reports that it now requires a hearing."
Hearst, pale and silent throughout the hearing,
smiled at her parents as she entered the courtroom.
It was her first acknowledgement of their presence
at any of her court appearances since her arrest.
Fromme banished again
SACRAMENTO — Lynette Fromme, blindfold
ing herself and forcing a deputy marshal to carry
her into the courthouse, was banished again yes

she would have to be carried from the jailhouse to
court.
Unions increase donations
WASHINGTON — With election day still nearly
a year away, AFL-CIO unions are making tens of
thousands of dollars in political donations to sup
porters of a controversial bill to increase the bar
gaining power of construction trades unions.
A sample group of 18 AFL-CIO political commit
tees gave a total of $93,495 to 78 House members
who supported the bill when it passed the House
last July, government reports show.
In the Senate, where a filibuster is being waged
against the bill, $15,000 from the same groups went
to Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.), who is head of
the Labor Committee and a sponsor of the bill.
The pattern of giving seems likely to continue as
organized labor gears up its political donations.
In the last few days alone, the carpenters' union,
with $80,000 in its political coffers at last report,
filed official notice of intent to donate money to 24
House members who voted for the bill.
The union listed no intended donations to oppo
nents of the measure.
Election law debated
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court was told
yesterday by proponents of the new election reform
law that it is aimed at stopping an "arms race of
political contributions," but opponents said it cuts
off free speech because, "money talks."
"It is speech," said Justice Potter Stewart during
very close questioning from the bench. "Speech is
money, and money is speech."
In an unusual four and one-half hours of oral
argument on the case, opponents charged that Con
gress stacked the 1974 Federal Elections Campaign
Act in favor of political incumbents and made it
harder for challengers.
Yale Law Prof. Ralph Winter said the law allows
congressmen to send out millions of dollars worth
of politically helpful mail under the franking
privilege while denying the same financial break to
their opponents.

NY gov. makes new proposal
NEW YORK — Gov. Hugh Carey has stitched
together a complex new proposal — involving new
state and city taxes, and help from banks and the
federal government — to keep New York City from
default and stabilize the state's own shaky finances.
New York City residents, who already have the
highest sales taxes in the country, would be faced
with a one-cent sales tax increase, to nine cents on
the dollar.
As state officials worked on the plan yesterday,
Deputy White House Press Secretary William
Greener repeated President Ford's promise to vote
what the President has termed a "bail-out" of New
York City.
The new Carey plan would reduce the minimum
$4 billion in federal loan guarantees previously
sought by the city to
1.5 billion to $2 billion.
To make up the difference, the plan would re
quire heavy support from banks, other investors
and taxpayers.

Australian PM dismissed
CANBERRA, Australia — Australia was thrown
into politicalturmoiltoday with the unprecedented
removal of Prime Minister Cough Whitlam by the
governor-general, Sir John Kerr.
In a statement read in Parliament and distributed
to the press, Kerr said Whitlam's inability to get
appropriation bills through Parliament left him no
alternative but to dismiss Whitlam's Labor gov
ernment.
He called on Malcolm Fraser, leader of the oppos
ition Conservatives, to form a caretaker government
until national elections can be held for both the
Senate and House of Representatives.
Kerr is both an appointee of the Labor govern
ment and the representative of Britain's Queen
Elizabeth 11.
Whitlam, responding to his sacking, told the
House of Representatives that he should remain in
office. He argued that the Senate had passed the
controversial appropriations bill and, "there is no
longer a deadlock."
The opposition-controlled Senate had approved
the money bill a few minutes earlier, but only after
Fraser had been named to head a caretaker govern
ment.
It was the first time in Australian history that a
government has been denied funds to govern by a
hostile Senate and the first time a prime minister
was sacked by the governor.-general.
