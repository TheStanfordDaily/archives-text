### PETER KRETZMAN 
Stanford police arrested and booked
a suspect Sunday, charging him with
the knife assault that afternoon of a
woman walking near the Stanford
Stadium.
The suspect. John Arthur Monroe.
22, was booked on two accounts, as
sault with a deadly weapon and as
sault with intent to kill. Actual trial
charges will be determined by the dis
trict attorney, according to Marvin
Herrington, director of the Stanford
Police Services (SPS).
Herrington said that the woman was
walking with a friend, also female,
near the corner of Galvez and Campus
Sts. around 2 p.m., when a man ac
costed them with a knife.
One of the women ran away im
mediately, said Herrington, while the
other struggled with the attacker.

Neither woman was stabbed, Herring
ton said, although the victim was later
taken for an examination by a doctor.
The women's screams drew people
to the scene, according to Herrington,
and the attacker fled. Witnesses
notified SPS, and officers obtained a
description of the suspect and his veh
icle.
Palo Alto Police Department officers
apprehended the man very rapidly,
said Herrington, and Stanford police
arrested the suspect after determining
that "enough evidence had been ob
tained" to warrant arrest.
Herrington refused to release the
names of the two women, although he
did say that they were "Stanford as
sociated."
He said Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department has assumed investiga
tion of the matter.
