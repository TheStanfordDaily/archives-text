# ASSU Senate says 'no' on Bonfire
## 
### JACK VAUGHN 
The ASSU Senate last night recom
mended that the traditional Big Game
Bonfire at Lake Lagunita be aban
doned.
The resolution, asking that Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons "investi
gate and implement alternatives" to
the Bonfire, and advising that "the
Bonfire not take place," passed by an
11-7 vote.
"To continue the traditional Bonfire
in its monstrous magnitude of recent
years is an exercise in conspicuous de
struction," ASSU President Lee
Rosenbaum said in a prepared state
ment.
Speaking for the Council of Presi
dents, which opposed the Bonfire.
Rosenbaum added that he would sup
port a compromise which combines a
fire approximately one-tenth the size
of the planned event with a dance at
Tresidder Union.
Rosenbaum said the compromise
was based on Lyons' belief that the
Nov. 21 event was too far alnng to be
canceled for this year. He said it is
"likely that Lyons will institute the
compromise," making way for a phas
ing out of the Bonfire next year.
Unites people
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Presi
dent and Bonfire supporter Bob Ot
tilie. speaking against the resolution,

called the Bonfire an "affair that brings
together students faculty, staff,
alumni and the Palo Alto community.
No other function brings so many peo
ple together."
Bonfire Chairman Bill Christopher
complained because the resolution
came up only 11 days before the event.
"The time for an alternative was a
month or three weeks ago," said Chris
topher. "We're right in the middle of it
now," he said.
Debate on the resolution centered on
rhe pollution allegedly caused by de
bris in the lake and smoke generated
by the fire, as well as on the symbolic
value of the Bonfire.
"I had a great time last year" at the
Bonfire, said Sen. Sarah Alfadl, a
Bonfire opponent, but, "there's no way
you can clean up all the ashes and
scum.
"I don't see why we can't have a
smaller Bonfire to let our pyromaniacs
have a good time and let the rest of us
have a dance." Alfadl said.
Scum due to inexperience
Sen. Kevin McDermott, a Bonfire
supporter, said the scum left in the
lake after last year's Bonfire resulted
because of inexperience among Bonfir
officials. "The IFC did not know how
to keep the scum from forming because
we hadn't had a Bonfire in two years,"
he said.

McDermott and other Bonfire advo
cates stressed that Bonfire officials
were taking greater precautions this
year.
"All that can be done to clean up the
lake will be done." Christopher said.
Christopher explained that, "the lef
tover debris will be buried . . . im
mediately after the fire by a hired
dumping company."
The Bonfire has become a "semi
religious event" to its supporters, ac
cording to graduate Sen. Bruce Re
znick, speaking against the Bonfire. "It
is silly, destructive, wasteful and un
imaginative," Reznick said.
Complex logic
McDermott said he didn't "under
stand the logic" of Bonfire opponents
who feel the event is destructive yet
support a compromise which includes
a small fire. "I'm not asking that the
Senate support the Bonfire." he said.
"1 just don't want the Senate to stop it."
Rosenbaum reported that a group of
students and administrators last week
approached seven Palo Alto mer
chants mentioned in an adver
tisement in the Daily calling for the
return of the Indian as Stanford's mas
cot. to object to the ad.
"The merchants were unaware" of
the current controversy over the mas
cot. Rosenbaum said. He said the ad
was part of a campaign by the New

Founders League, a "right-wing
alumni group," to return the Indian.
Ottilie objected to Rosenbaum's par
ticipation in the ad controversy. "It
takes us back to the days of the late'6os
and early 70s when the COP spent
their time representing only their own
pet political interests," he said.
Counter ad
Rosenbaum later said the students
and administrators, at Lyons' sugges
tion, were originally going to put a
countering ad in the Daily supporting
"a boycott of the merchants," but they
decided instead to "go talk to them
first."
In other action, the Senate:
—Voted 15-1 to give $125 to the Ad
Hoc Committee on Hungerfor the Nov.
24 National Day of Fasting.
—Rejected the nominations of three
students. Rosenbaum. Senate Deputy
Chairman Elizabeth Larkam and Lisa
Lang, to the committee which will
search for a replacement for retiring
Dean of Undergraduate Studies lames
Gibbs. Some senators said the selec
tion process had not been well enough
advertised.
—Defeated 11-5 a resolution urging
students to picket the Career Planning
and Placement Center over the
Univesity's opening of the Center to
recruiters from the National Security
Auencv.

DOUSING THE BONFIRF—ASSU Senators Bob Ottilie and Tim Conway
(right) prepare strategy during a recess before the senate took up the
bonfire issue. By a vote of 11-7, the senate voted to endorse a resolution
proposed by the ASSU Council of Presidents opposing the traditional
Big Game bonfire.
The ASSU Senate last night recom
mended that the traditional Big Game
Bonfire at Lake Lagunita be aban
doned.
The resolution, asking that Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons "investi
gate and implement alternatives" to
the Bonfire, and advising that "the
Bonfire not take place," passed by an
11-7 vote.
"To continue the traditional Bonfire
in its monstrous magnitude of recent
years is an exercise in conspicuous de
struction," ASSU President Lee
Rosenbaum said in a prepared state
ment.
Speaking for the Council of Presi
dents, which opposed the Bonfire.
Rosenbaum added that he would sup
port a compromise which combines a
fire approximately one-tenth the size
of the planned event with a dance at
Tresidder Union.
Rosenbaum said the compromise
was based on Lyons' belief that the
Nov. 21 event was too far alnng to be
canceled for this year. He said it is
"likely that Lyons will institute the
compromise," making way for a phas
ing out of the Bonfire next year.
Unites people
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Presi
dent and Bonfire supporter Bob Ot
tilie. speaking against the resolution,

called the Bonfire an "affair that brings
together students faculty, staff,
alumni and the Palo Alto community.
No other function brings so many peo
ple together."
Bonfire Chairman Bill Christopher
complained because the resolution
came up only 11 days before the event.
"The time for an alternative was a
month or three weeks ago," said Chris
topher. "We're right in the middle of it
now," he said.
Debate on the resolution centered on
rhe pollution allegedly caused by de
bris in the lake and smoke generated
by the fire, as well as on the symbolic
value of the Bonfire.
"I had a great time last year" at the
Bonfire, said Sen. Sarah Alfadl, a
Bonfire opponent, but, "there's no way
you can clean up all the ashes and
scum.
"I don't see why we can't have a
smaller Bonfire to let our pyromaniacs
have a good time and let the rest of us
have a dance." Alfadl said.
Scum due to inexperience
Sen. Kevin McDermott, a Bonfire
supporter, said the scum left in the
lake after last year's Bonfire resulted
because of inexperience among Bonfir
officials. "The IFC did not know how
to keep the scum from forming because
we hadn't had a Bonfire in two years,"
he said.

McDermott and other Bonfire advo
cates stressed that Bonfire officials
were taking greater precautions this
year.
"All that can be done to clean up the
lake will be done." Christopher said.
Christopher explained that, "the lef
tover debris will be buried . . . im
mediately after the fire by a hired
dumping company."
The Bonfire has become a "semi
religious event" to its supporters, ac
cording to graduate Sen. Bruce Re
znick, speaking against the Bonfire. "It
is silly, destructive, wasteful and un
imaginative," Reznick said.
Complex logic
McDermott said he didn't "under
stand the logic" of Bonfire opponents
who feel the event is destructive yet
support a compromise which includes
a small fire. "I'm not asking that the
Senate support the Bonfire." he said.
"1 just don't want the Senate to stop it."
Rosenbaum reported that a group of
students and administrators last week
approached seven Palo Alto mer
chants mentioned in an adver
tisement in the Daily calling for the
return of the Indian as Stanford's mas
cot. to object to the ad.
"The merchants were unaware" of
the current controversy over the mas
cot. Rosenbaum said. He said the ad
was part of a campaign by the New

Founders League, a "right-wing
alumni group," to return the Indian.
Ottilie objected to Rosenbaum's par
ticipation in the ad controversy. "It
takes us back to the days of the late'6os
and early 70s when the COP spent
their time representing only their own
pet political interests," he said.
Counter ad
Rosenbaum later said the students
and administrators, at Lyons' sugges
tion, were originally going to put a
countering ad in the Daily supporting
"a boycott of the merchants," but they
decided instead to "go talk to them
first."
In other action, the Senate:
—Voted 15-1 to give $125 to the Ad
Hoc Committee on Hungerfor the Nov.
24 National Day of Fasting.
—Rejected the nominations of three
students. Rosenbaum. Senate Deputy

In other action, the Senate:

Hoc Committee on Hungerfor the Nov.
24 National Day of Fasting.
—Rejected the nominations of three
students. Rosenbaum. Senate Deputy
Chairman Elizabeth Larkam and Lisa

DOUSING THE BONFIRF—ASSU Senators Bob Ottilie and Tim Conway
(right) prepare strategy during a recess before the senate took up the
bonfire issue. By a vote of 11-7, the senate voted to endorse a resolution
proposed by the ASSU Council of Presidents opposing the traditional
Big Game bonfire.
The ASSU Senate last night recom
mended that the traditional Big Game
Bonfire at Lake Lagunita be aban
doned.
The resolution, asking that Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons "investi
gate and implement alternatives" to
the Bonfire, and advising that "the
Bonfire not take place," passed by an
11-7 vote.
"To continue the traditional Bonfire
in its monstrous magnitude of recent
years is an exercise in conspicuous de
struction," ASSU President Lee
Rosenbaum said in a prepared state
ment.
Speaking for the Council of Presi
dents, which opposed the Bonfire.
Rosenbaum added that he would sup
port a compromise which combines a
fire approximately one-tenth the size
of the planned event with a dance at
Tresidder Union.
Rosenbaum said the compromise
was based on Lyons' belief that the
Nov. 21 event was too far alnng to be
canceled for this year. He said it is
"likely that Lyons will institute the
compromise," making way for a phas
ing out of the Bonfire next year.
Unites people
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) Presi
dent and Bonfire supporter Bob Ot
tilie. speaking against the resolution,

called the Bonfire an "affair that brings
together students faculty, staff,
alumni and the Palo Alto community.
No other function brings so many peo
ple together."
Bonfire Chairman Bill Christopher
complained because the resolution
came up only 11 days before the event.
"The time for an alternative was a
month or three weeks ago," said Chris
topher. "We're right in the middle of it
now," he said.
Debate on the resolution centered on
rhe pollution allegedly caused by de
bris in the lake and smoke generated
by the fire, as well as on the symbolic
value of the Bonfire.
"I had a great time last year" at the
Bonfire, said Sen. Sarah Alfadl, a
Bonfire opponent, but, "there's no way
you can clean up all the ashes and
scum.
"I don't see why we can't have a
smaller Bonfire to let our pyromaniacs
have a good time and let the rest of us
have a dance." Alfadl said.
Scum due to inexperience
Sen. Kevin McDermott, a Bonfire
supporter, said the scum left in the
lake after last year's Bonfire resulted
because of inexperience among Bonfir
officials. "The IFC did not know how
to keep the scum from forming because
we hadn't had a Bonfire in two years,"
he said.

McDermott and other Bonfire advo
cates stressed that Bonfire officials
were taking greater precautions this
year.
"All that can be done to clean up the
lake will be done." Christopher said.
Christopher explained that, "the lef
tover debris will be buried . . . im
mediately after the fire by a hired
dumping company."
The Bonfire has become a "semi
religious event" to its supporters, ac
cording to graduate Sen. Bruce Re
znick, speaking against the Bonfire. "It
is silly, destructive, wasteful and un
imaginative," Reznick said.
Complex logic
McDermott said he didn't "under
stand the logic" of Bonfire opponents
who feel the event is destructive yet
support a compromise which includes
a small fire. "I'm not asking that the
Senate support the Bonfire." he said.
"1 just don't want the Senate to stop it."
Rosenbaum reported that a group of
students and administrators last week
approached seven Palo Alto mer
chants mentioned in an adver
tisement in the Daily calling for the
return of the Indian as Stanford's mas
cot. to object to the ad.
"The merchants were unaware" of
the current controversy over the mas
cot. Rosenbaum said. He said the ad
was part of a campaign by the New

Founders League, a "right-wing
alumni group," to return the Indian.
Ottilie objected to Rosenbaum's par
ticipation in the ad controversy. "It
takes us back to the days of the late'6os
and early 70s when the COP spent
their time representing only their own
pet political interests," he said.
Counter ad
Rosenbaum later said the students
and administrators, at Lyons' sugges
tion, were originally going to put a
countering ad in the Daily supporting
"a boycott of the merchants," but they
decided instead to "go talk to them
first."
