# U.N. vote calls Zionism 'racist'
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS,N.Y.(AP) — The
General Assembly adopted an Arab
inspired resolution last night declar
ing that, "Zionism is a form of racism
and racial discrimination."
The vote on the bitterly fought issue
was 72-35 with 32 abstentions. The
United States opposed the resolution.
The vote on the anti-Zionism meas
ure followed affirmative action by the
Assembly earlier yesterday on two
pro-Palestinian resolutions that drew a
heated reaction from Israel.
One of the approved resolutions,
adopted by a vote of 93-18 with 27
abstentions, in effect bypasses Sec
urity Council decisions about Israel's
right to existence and stresses instead
the rights of the Palestinians to return
to their homes and property. Israel
criticized the resolution as aimed at its
destruction.
The other resolution calls for the
participation of the Palestine Libera
tion Organization (PLO) "in all efforts,
deliberations and conferences on the
Middle East" held under U.N. au
spices. The vote was 101-8 with 25 abs
tentions.
U.S. opposition
The United States voted against both
measures.
In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yit
zhak Rabin flatly rejected the resolu
tions, saying they "sabotage efforts to
achieve peace between Israel and Arab
states."
He added that Israel will not cooper
ate with any committee established to

enforce an earlier resolution ensuring
the Palestinians' right to sovereignty
and relocation on land in what is now
Israel, and will not talk, with the PLO.
World-wide repercussions
One European reprsentative said he
feared the Assembly action would
touch off hostile attitudes toward the
U.N. in the U.S. Congress, among the
public and throughout Western
Europe.
Clarence Mitchell, a U.S. delegate to
theU.N., predicted "very punitive" ac
tion by Congress.
The Congress has the power to
withhold approval of U.S. financial
contributions and assessments for the
budgets of the United Nations and the
specialized agencies.
Sen. Henry Jackson (ID-Wash.), who
sits on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said Congress should "ex
amine means by which we can re
spond to the vote."
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), said, "1
can only deplore this unfortunate and
untimely action by the General As
sembly. The consequences of the vote
may well be a full reappraisal of the
United States' participation and its
role in funding the U.N.
"For the General Assembly to affirm
the resolution is not only deplorable, it
indicates a disturbing and negative
trend at the U.N. which must be re
sisted. A resistance that ought to in
clude the political and economic
leverage possessed by the United
States," Udall concluded.

achieve peace between Israel and Arab
states."
He added that Israel will not cooper
ate with any committee established to

enforce an earlier resolution ensuring
the Palestinians' right to sovereignty
and relocation on land in what is now
Israel, and will not talk, with the PLO.
World-wide repercussions
One European reprsentative said he
feared the Assembly action would
touch off hostile attitudes toward the
U.N. in the U.S. Congress, among the
public and throughout Western
Europe.
Clarence Mitchell, a U.S. delegate to
theU.N., predicted "very punitive" ac
tion by Congress.
The Congress has the power to
withhold approval of U.S. financial
contributions and assessments for the
budgets of the United Nations and the
specialized agencies.
Sen. Henry Jackson (ID-Wash.), who
sits on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said Congress should "ex
amine means by which we can re
spond to the vote."
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), said, "1
can only deplore this unfortunate and
untimely action by the General As
sembly. The consequences of the vote
may well be a full reappraisal of the
United States' participation and its
role in funding the U.N.
"For the General Assembly to affirm
the resolution is not only deplorable, it
indicates a disturbing and negative
trend at the U.N. which must be re
sisted. A resistance that ought to in
clude the political and economic
leverage possessed by the United
States," Udall concluded.
UNITED NATIONS,N.Y.(AP) — The
General Assembly adopted an Arab
inspired resolution last night declar
ing that, "Zionism is a form of racism
and racial discrimination."
The vote on the bitterly fought issue
was 72-35 with 32 abstentions. The
United States opposed the resolution.
The vote on the anti-Zionism meas
ure followed affirmative action by the
Assembly earlier yesterday on two
pro-Palestinian resolutions that drew a
heated reaction from Israel.
One of the approved resolutions,
adopted by a vote of 93-18 with 27
abstentions, in effect bypasses Sec
urity Council decisions about Israel's
right to existence and stresses instead
the rights of the Palestinians to return
to their homes and property. Israel
criticized the resolution as aimed at its
destruction.
The other resolution calls for the
participation of the Palestine Libera
tion Organization (PLO) "in all efforts,
deliberations and conferences on the
Middle East" held under U.N. au
spices. The vote was 101-8 with 25 abs
tentions.
U.S. opposition
The United States voted against both
measures.
In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yit
zhak Rabin flatly rejected the resolu
tions, saying they "sabotage efforts to
achieve peace between Israel and Arab
states."
He added that Israel will not cooper
ate with any committee established to

enforce an earlier resolution ensuring
