# Quinlan decision
## 'No right to die' 
### 
MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) — A
Superior Court judge ruled yesterday
that Karen Anne Quinlan must be kept
alive with a mechanical life-support
system because, "there is no constitu
tional right to die."
Judge Robert Muir, Jr. said the deci
sion on whether to turn off the re
spirator that has kept the 21-year-old
woman alive since she lapsed into a
coma nearly seven months ago must be
left up to her doctors, not the courts, or
the church or her parents.
Joseph Quinlan had made an emo
tional appeal during a five-day hearing
before Nuir that his daughter be al
lowed to "die with dignity."
But Nuir ruled in his 44-page opin
ion that, "the nature, extent and dura
tion of care is the responsibility of the
physician. What justification is there
to remove it Trom the control of the
medical profession and place it in the
hands of the courts?"
Physicians bound
He said physicians are bound to pro
long life as long as they can.
"There is a duty to continue the
life-assisting apparatus if within the
treating physician's opinion it should
be done," the judge said.
Muir said Joseph Quinlan "impre
ssed me as a very sincere, moral, ethi
cal and religious person" and that the
father "is obviously anguished over
his decision to terminate what he con
siders the extraordinary care of his
daughter."
The father reciprocated. He told a

news conference after the judge's ver
dict that he thought Muir "showed
courage in saying the matter belonged
with the physicians and the family.
But we had been praying for him to
show even more courage — to go all
the way."
Mother speaks
His wife said the legal proceedings
were "something we felt we must do
morally. We had alrady done every
thing medically and spiritually. So we
had to take it to the courts."
Doctors have said Karen Quinlan
would die within a week if her re
spirator were disconnected.
Because of the father's anguish and
inner conflict over his daughter's
treatment, Muir said he — Quinlan —
should not be permitted to participate
in the "day-to-day decisions of her fu
ture care and treatment."
He appointed the father as guardian
of his daugher's property but con
tinued the appointment of attorney
Daniel Osburn as the young woman's
personal guardian to make decisions
in medical matters. Osburn is a local
attorney who was not previously ac
quainted with the Quinlan family.
After Muir's decision was an
nounced, Quinlan attorney Paul Arm
strong told reporters that the family
had not decided whether to appeal the
ruling. Headded that a decision would
be made "within a few days."
Joseph Quinlan said he was "sur
prised, in a way." by the judge's rul
ing.

spirator that has kept the 21-year-old
woman alive since she lapsed into a
coma nearly seven months ago must be
left up to her doctors, not the courts, or
the church or her parents.
Joseph Quinlan had made an emo
tional appeal during a five-day hearing
before Nuir that his daughter be al
lowed to "die with dignity."
But Nuir ruled in his 44-page opin
ion that, "the nature, extent and dura
tion of care is the responsibility of the
physician. What justification is there
to remove it Trom the control of the
medical profession and place it in the
hands of the courts?"
Physicians bound
He said physicians are bound to pro
long life as long as they can.
"There is a duty to continue the
life-assisting apparatus if within the
treating physician's opinion it should
be done," the judge said.
Muir said Joseph Quinlan "impre
ssed me as a very sincere, moral, ethi
cal and religious person" and that the
father "is obviously anguished over
his decision to terminate what he con
siders the extraordinary care of his
daughter."
The father reciprocated. He told a

news conference after the judge's ver
dict that he thought Muir "showed
courage in saying the matter belonged
with the physicians and the family.
But we had been praying for him to
show even more courage — to go all
the way."
Mother speaks
His wife said the legal proceedings
were "something we felt we must do
morally. We had alrady done every
thing medically and spiritually. So we
had to take it to the courts."
Doctors have said Karen Quinlan
would die within a week if her re
spirator were disconnected.
Because of the father's anguish and
inner conflict over his daughter's
treatment, Muir said he — Quinlan —
should not be permitted to participate
in the "day-to-day decisions of her fu
ture care and treatment."
He appointed the father as guardian
of his daugher's property but con
tinued the appointment of attorney
Daniel Osburn as the young woman's
personal guardian to make decisions
in medical matters. Osburn is a local
attorney who was not previously ac
quainted with the Quinlan family.
After Muir's decision was an
nounced, Quinlan attorney Paul Arm
strong told reporters that the family
had not decided whether to appeal the
ruling. Headded that a decision would
be made "within a few days."
Joseph Quinlan said he was "sur
prised, in a way." by the judge's rul
ing.
MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) — A
Superior Court judge ruled yesterday
that Karen Anne Quinlan must be kept

system because, "there is no constitu
tional right to die."

spirator that has kept the 21-year-old
