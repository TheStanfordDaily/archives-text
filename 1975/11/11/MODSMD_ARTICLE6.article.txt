# Overseas budget

News of drastic cuts in the
Overseas Studies Office budget
signals the necessity of over
whelming changes necessary in
the structure of the program. As
yet, Mark. Mancall, director of
Overseas Studies, has not de
vised a satisfactory resolution of
the problem (Daily, Oct. 7). I
would like to put forth a plan for
general consideration.
The overseas campuses are
subject to certain expenses uni
que in the University budget.
The cost of transporting students
to the campuses and of leasing
non-University buildings and
land are major costs, as are
the costs of maintaining faculty
families overseas.
Even the costs of bureaucratic
details mount â€” the mailing of
issues of the Daily overseas, the
telegraphing of vote tallies at
elections, even the everyday
mailing and telephoning bet
ween foreign and home cam
puses cause special expenses.
The basic problefh of the Stan
ford overseas campuses is that
they are overseas. Let the recent
"grand opening" of the French
theme house give us the inspira
tion for revamping the Overseas
(Campuses program. Here is my
proposal.
Eliminate Cowell
Do away with the current
housing groups in Cowell Clus
ter 11. Whitman, ATO, ZAP, and
Alpha Sig will become Stanford
in France, Germany, Austria and
Italy, respectively. Terra will be
reserved for the smaller prog
rams, such as those of Paris and
Berlin.
Stanford in England should be
located in Wilbur Hall (all of it)
to maintain the sense of spa
ciousness of Cliveden House.

Certain structural
would have to be made in these
houses. For instance, two
storerooms in Alpha Sig need to
be converted to bars (one for
beer, the other for espresso) in
order to maintain the Florentine
standard of luxury; a pool
should be added nearby as well.
Academic standards should
be relaxed in keeping with tradi
tional Overseas Studies policy;
language requirements would be
eliminated once and for all.
These two measures would as
sure continued popularity for
these centers among Stanford
students.
Field trips
There remains the problem of
what to do about field trips.
One solution would be to
abandon them altogether and to
invite as guests for dinner stu
dents from countries to which
the centers are dedicated. This
way, the level of cultural interac
tion between Stanford students
and foreign students would be
about the same here as in
Europe.
Wine would be provided with
meals for the Tours and Florence
houses, beer for Beutelsbach, ale
for Cliveden and strudel for the
Vienna center in order to rein
force the cultural validity of the
program by culinary means.
With such a plan all the major
extraordinary costs of the over
seas campuses would be elimi
nated and the program would be
greatly streamlined. Great cost
cuts could be effected without
any erosion of the academic and
cultural benefits these campuses
offer. ,
