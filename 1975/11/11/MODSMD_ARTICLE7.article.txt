I understand from the Oct. 30
Daily article entitled "COSS
holds off decision on gay job dis
crimination" that the present
policy of this university denies
placement facilities to prospec
tive employers who discrimi
nate in their hiring practices on
the basis of "race, creed, sex or
national origin."
That posture is, of course,
mandated by federal law. What
is disturbing is the implication
that Dean Thomas Ehrlich of the
Law School opposes extension
of the policy to include dis
crimination on the basis of sex
ual orientation.
It is difficult for me to believe
that Ehrlich, a leading liberal
and humanist, and the Stanford
Law School, preeminent in legal
education in this country, would
adopt a considered position that
the University should continue
to facilitate employment dis
crimination against any minor
ity group.
As a gay person, I am acutely
aware of the disabilities suffered
by the gay community and its
struggle to be free from dis
crimination because of sexual
orientation. In my view, it is ob

ligatory for the academic com
munity and particularly the
legal academy, not only to de
plore discrimination, but to ac
tively utilize its resources to dis
courage and eliminate it in
whatever form it may be man
ifested.
The courts and many legisla
tive bodies are coming to ack
nowledge and enforce society's
responsibilities to assure all citi
zens equal employment oppor
tunity consistent with their
training and abilities. I believe
that the law schools have a uni
que opportunity and obligation
to further implimentation «112 that
policy.
Stanford should be in the
forefront. It can demonstrate its
commitment to the civil liberties
of all minorities by refusing, in
this case, to permit itself to be
used to perpetuate discrimina
tion against gay persons.
Acting only in response to
legal compulsion does not, in
my judgment, fulfill its respon
sibilities.
