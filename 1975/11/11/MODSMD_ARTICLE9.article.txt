# President should have open term
## 
### 
Too many critics of university adminis
trators complain about lack of inspired
leadership while denouncing adminis
trators who remain in office for more than a
few years.
While long service in office is not neces
sarily positively correlated with high qual
ity service, long tenure at the highest levels
can help an administrator cultivate the type
of professionalism necessary for successful
leadership.
It is therefore unfortunate that university
presidents have generally reached the point
where they feel obligated to apologize if
they remain in office for more than a half
dozen years and usually resign after a de
cade.
President Richard Lyman, for example,
assured the University upon taking office in
1970 that he planned to serve for a max
imum of only 10 years.
Yale's Kingman Brewster has announced
plans to retire soon; he has served for 11
years. And Robert Hornung of Brown re
cently quit after 10 years, explaining that he
did not believe in long terms for presidents.
Issue highlighted
Although the issue of administrative te
nure has long been a matter of concern in
this University, the release this month of a
faculty survey taken by the Stanford chapter
of the American Association of University
Professors (AAUP) seems likely to trigger
open and intense discussion of the issue
during the coming year.
In the survey, approximately 40 percent
of the 158 respondents said they would like
to see "exploration of the possibility that all
senior administrators — such as the presi
dent, provost, and various deans — might
shift from the present open-ended ap
pointment basis to appointments for fixed
terms, subject to possible limited reap
pointment after formal evaluation."
Although the AAUP has not formally an
nounced support for this position and less

than six percent of all Stanford faculty
members endorsed this position, it would
not be surprising if those faculty members
holding this view would attempt to call at
tention to the issue of administrative terms.
But there are several problems inherent in
giving top administrators fixed terms.
Vision narrowed
First, frequent turnover in the office of
president and provost would eliminate the

opportunity for top administrators to carry
through long term, comprehensive plans for
the University.
Likewise, a highly competent adminis
trator might be replaced by a mediocrity. If
an administrator is doing a great job, why
should he not continue indefinitely in of
fice?
Many of the achievements of this Univer
sity are attributable to the strong leadership
provided by David Starr Jordan, who served
as president from 1891 to 1913, and Wallace
Sterling, who served from 1949 to 1968. If
either had quit after five or 10 years his
important work might never have been ac
complished.
Sterling, for example, started an ambiti
ous program of University expansion that
took nearly two decades to guide to comple
tion. Since many of Sterling's plans — such
as the Medical School — were his own vis
ions and were opposed by other more
short-sighted administrators, it seems un
likely that they would have been carried

through without Sterling's continuation in
office.
No tenure
Furthermore, as Provost William Miller
pointed out at a meeting with the AAUP last
Friday, no administrator — in contrast to
senior faculty members — has formal tenure
in his job. It is therefore possible for public
pressure at any time to force the resignation
of an incompetent administrator.
One can carry this argument a step further
and note that the lack of terms for adminis
trators actually makes it more possible to
remove an unqualified administrator from
office.
If a university president does not have a
fixed term, he cannot respond to calls for
resignation by saying he ought to finish his
term. For example, if the ill-fated President
Kenneth Pitzer had been appointed to a
fixed term in 1968, he might have doggedly
insisted upon toughing out his term rather
than wisely quitting in 1970.
Significantly, the 1969 Study of Educa
tion at Stanford, which supported
fixing terms for deans and department
heads, opposed establishing terms for the
president and provost, for many of the same
reasons listed above.
University administrators have often
been decried in recent years as unimagina
tive bureaucrats. Their alleged lack of vis
ion has been compared to the greatness
exhibited by Jordan, William Harper of
Chicago, Nicholas Murray Butler of Colum
bia and Charles Eliot of Harvard early in this
century.
While few persons would advocate re
storing the autocratic methods, of those
men, academia needs their type of vision.
Circumscribing the abilities of high ad
ministrators by limiting their terms is no
vvay to encourage a creative administration.

remove an unqualified administrator from
office.
If a university president does not have a
fixed term, he cannot respond to calls for
resignation by saying he ought to finish his
term. For example, if the ill-fated President
Kenneth Pitzer had been appointed to a
fixed term in 1968, he might have doggedly
insisted upon toughing out his term rather
than wisely quitting in 1970.
Significantly, the 1969 Study of Educa
tion at Stanford, which supported
fixing terms for deans and department
heads, opposed establishing terms for the
president and provost, for many of the same
reasons listed above.
University administrators have often
been decried in recent years as unimagina
tive bureaucrats. Their alleged lack of vis
ion has been compared to the greatness
exhibited by Jordan, William Harper of
Chicago, Nicholas Murray Butler of Colum
bia and Charles Eliot of Harvard early in this
century.
While few persons would advocate re
storing the autocratic methods, of those
men, academia needs their type of vision.
Circumscribing the abilities of high ad
ministrators by limiting their terms is no
vvay to encourage a creative administration.

Too many critics of university adminis
trators complain about lack of inspired
leadership while denouncing adminis
trators who remain in office for more than a
few years.
While long service in office is not neces
sarily positively correlated with high qual
ity service, long tenure at the highest levels
can help an administrator cultivate the type
of professionalism necessary for successful
leadership.
It is therefore unfortunate that university
presidents have generally reached the point
where they feel obligated to apologize if
they remain in office for more than a half
dozen years and usually resign after a de
cade.
President Richard Lyman, for example,
assured the University upon taking office in
1970 that he planned to serve for a max
imum of only 10 years.
Yale's Kingman Brewster has announced
plans to retire soon; he has served for 11
years. And Robert Hornung of Brown re
cently quit after 10 years, explaining that he
did not believe in long terms for presidents.
Issue highlighted
Although the issue of administrative te
nure has long been a matter of concern in
this University, the release this month of a
faculty survey taken by the Stanford chapter
of the American Association of University
Professors (AAUP) seems likely to trigger
open and intense discussion of the issue
during the coming year.
In the survey, approximately 40 percent
of the 158 respondents said they would like
to see "exploration of the possibility that all
senior administrators — such as the presi
dent, provost, and various deans — might
shift from the present open-ended ap
pointment basis to appointments for fixed
terms, subject to possible limited reap
pointment after formal evaluation."
Although the AAUP has not formally an
nounced support for this position and less

than six percent of all Stanford faculty
members endorsed this position, it would
not be surprising if those faculty members
holding this view would attempt to call at
tention to the issue of administrative terms.
But there are several problems inherent in
giving top administrators fixed terms.
Vision narrowed
First, frequent turnover in the office of
president and provost would eliminate the

opportunity for top administrators to carry
through long term, comprehensive plans for
the University.
Likewise, a highly competent adminis
trator might be replaced by a mediocrity. If
an administrator is doing a great job, why
should he not continue indefinitely in of
fice?
Many of the achievements of this Univer
sity are attributable to the strong leadership
provided by David Starr Jordan, who served
as president from 1891 to 1913, and Wallace
Sterling, who served from 1949 to 1968. If
either had quit after five or 10 years his
important work might never have been ac
complished.
Sterling, for example, started an ambiti
ous program of University expansion that
took nearly two decades to guide to comple
tion. Since many of Sterling's plans — such
as the Medical School — were his own vis
ions and were opposed by other more
short-sighted administrators, it seems un
likely that they would have been carried

through without Sterling's continuation in
office.
No tenure
Furthermore, as Provost William Miller
pointed out at a meeting with the AAUP last
Friday, no administrator — in contrast to
senior faculty members — has formal tenure
in his job. It is therefore possible for public
pressure at any time to force the resignation
of an incompetent administrator.

through long term, comprehensive plans for
the University.
Likewise, a highly competent adminis
trator might be replaced by a mediocrity. If
an administrator is doing a great job, why
should he not continue indefinitely in of
fice?
Many of the achievements of this Univer
sity are attributable to the strong leadership
provided by David Starr Jordan, who served
as president from 1891 to 1913, and Wallace
Sterling, who served from 1949 to 1968. If
either had quit after five or 10 years his
important work might never have been ac
complished.
Sterling, for example, started an ambiti
ous program of University expansion that
took nearly two decades to guide to comple
tion. Since many of Sterling's plans — such
as the Medical School — were his own vis
ions and were opposed by other more
short-sighted administrators, it seems un
likely that they would have been carried

through without Sterling's continuation in
office.
No tenure
Furthermore, as Provost William Miller
pointed out at a meeting with the AAUP last
Friday, no administrator — in contrast to
senior faculty members — has formal tenure
in his job. It is therefore possible for public
pressure at any time to force the resignation
of an incompetent administrator.
One can carry this argument a step further
and note that the lack of terms for adminis
trators actually makes it more possible to
remove an unqualified administrator from
office.
If a university president does not have a
fixed term, he cannot respond to calls for
resignation by saying he ought to finish his
term. For example, if the ill-fated President
Kenneth Pitzer had been appointed to a
fixed term in 1968, he might have doggedly
insisted upon toughing out his term rather
than wisely quitting in 1970.
Significantly, the 1969 Study of Educa
tion at Stanford, which supported
fixing terms for deans and department
heads, opposed establishing terms for the
president and provost, for many of the same
reasons listed above.
University administrators have often
been decried in recent years as unimagina
tive bureaucrats. Their alleged lack of vis
ion has been compared to the greatness
exhibited by Jordan, William Harper of
Chicago, Nicholas Murray Butler of Colum
bia and Charles Eliot of Harvard early in this
century.
While few persons would advocate re
storing the autocratic methods, of those
men, academia needs their type of vision.
Circumscribing the abilities of high ad
ministrators by limiting their terms is no
vvay to encourage a creative administration.

Too many critics of university adminis
trators complain about lack of inspired
leadership while denouncing adminis
trators who remain in office for more than a
few years.
While long service in office is not neces
sarily positively correlated with high qual
ity service, long tenure at the highest levels
can help an administrator cultivate the type
of professionalism necessary for successful
leadership.
It is therefore unfortunate that university
presidents have generally reached the point
where they feel obligated to apologize if
they remain in office for more than a half
dozen years and usually resign after a de
cade.
President Richard Lyman, for example,
assured the University upon taking office in
1970 that he planned to serve for a max
imum of only 10 years.
Yale's Kingman Brewster has announced
plans to retire soon; he has served for 11
years. And Robert Hornung of Brown re
cently quit after 10 years, explaining that he
did not believe in long terms for presidents.
Issue highlighted
Although the issue of administrative te
nure has long been a matter of concern in
this University, the release this month of a
faculty survey taken by the Stanford chapter
of the American Association of University
Professors (AAUP) seems likely to trigger
open and intense discussion of the issue
during the coming year.
In the survey, approximately 40 percent
of the 158 respondents said they would like
to see "exploration of the possibility that all
senior administrators — such as the presi
dent, provost, and various deans — might
shift from the present open-ended ap
pointment basis to appointments for fixed
terms, subject to possible limited reap
pointment after formal evaluation."
Although the AAUP has not formally an
nounced support for this position and less

than six percent of all Stanford faculty
members endorsed this position, it would
not be surprising if those faculty members
holding this view would attempt to call at
tention to the issue of administrative terms.
But there are several problems inherent in
giving top administrators fixed terms.
Vision narrowed
First, frequent turnover in the office of
president and provost would eliminate the

opportunity for top administrators to carry
through long term, comprehensive plans for
the University.
Likewise, a highly competent adminis
trator might be replaced by a mediocrity. If
an administrator is doing a great job, why
should he not continue indefinitely in of
fice?
