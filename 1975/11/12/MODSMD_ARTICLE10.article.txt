# Law, practice differ
## What's the real drinking age? 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
California's most erratically
enforced law — the statute set
ting the drinking age at 21 —
looks as if it'sgoing tostay on the
books for at least two more years.
Legislative efforts to lower the
legal drinking age to 18 failed
again this summer, but mana
gers of local liquor establish
ments say not everyone follows
the present law as well as they
do.
Assemblyman Thomas Cline
"merely was going to place on
the November ballot a proposi
tion that the drinking age be
lowered to 18." according to
Cline's legislative aide, Frances

Molina.
"But this summer, the bill was
defeated on the floor of the As
sembly, 49-24," Molina noted.
Disbelief
"He can't believe it," she con
tinued. "It's the first time in
many years that the measure
didn't at least pass the first
house.
"Now the bill can't be rein
troduced until a new assembly is
formed, which would be in
1977," she said.
In the interim, minors are
going to find it a challenge to get
by on illegal buying, liquor store
managers say.
"1 don't think anyone would

intentionally jeopardize the in
vestment it takes to rnn a liquor
store by selling to a minor," one
manager said.
Heavy fines
"The fine for a first offense de
pends on the amount of volume
you're doing," he explained,
"hut the first one's usually about
$250. After that they get much
stiffer, and your license may be
revoked. I paid one of $2000 15
years ago, and never again."
He noted that "lots of minors
come in, just continually. 1 guess
they're hoping they don't get
asked for IDs.
"If the drinking age were low
ered, we'd sell to the younger
people," he added. "It's a matter
of survival. But it's, not some
thing I'd like to see. 1 just don't
think they're mature enough."
Mom-and-Pop
Another local liquor store
manager also opposed a lower
ing of the drinking age, but said
"some of the mom-and-pop type
grocery stores may sell to
minors. They've got a small vol
ume and high markup, and they
need the business. But legiti
mate liquor stores just don't
need that kind of business."
He added that "I've got a col
lection of fake IDs that you
wouldn't believe. There are well
over a hundred of them."
Identification problems
would multiply if the drinking
age were lowered to 18, an emp
loye at a nearby tavern pre
dicted.
"The difference between 18
and 21 is relatively dramatic in
terms of physiognamy and per
sonal character," he said. "I can
pick out theunder-21s now,but I
don't think I could tell a 1 5-year
old from an 18-year-old."
Vacations
The employe said his tavern
had experienced no difficulties
with the Department of Al
coholic Beverage Control, "be
cause we do most of the policing
ourselves. But," he continued, "I
know of two other places around
here that are a lot less strict. At
one of them, the owner takes a

two-month vacation every time
he gets busted."
An employe at that tavern said
"we don't have anywhere near as
much trouble as we did a year
ago, when we had to check IDs so
damn close." He speculated that
minors are "now doing their

drinking at house parties, which
is fine with me."
And as long as the legal drink
ing age nominally remains at 21,
most students under 21 will
probably continue to do their
drinking at "house parties" ac
ross the campus.

of state drivers license, a bartender just has to check the Drivers
License Guide to see if the ID really is legitimate. "I wouldn't be
without it," one bartender said.

troduced until a new assembly is

In the interim, minors are
going to find it a challenge to get

"1 don't think anyone would

manager said.
Heavy fines
"The fine for a first offense de
pends on the amount of volume
you're doing," he explained,
"hut the first one's usually about
$250. After that they get much
stiffer, and your license may be
revoked. I paid one of $2000 15
years ago, and never again."
He noted that "lots of minors
come in, just continually. 1 guess
they're hoping they don't get
asked for IDs.
"If the drinking age were low
ered, we'd sell to the younger
people," he added. "It's a matter
of survival. But it's, not some
thing I'd like to see. 1 just don't
think they're mature enough."
Mom-and-Pop
Another local liquor store
manager also opposed a lower
ing of the drinking age, but said
"some of the mom-and-pop type
grocery stores may sell to
minors. They've got a small vol
ume and high markup, and they
need the business. But legiti
mate liquor stores just don't
need that kind of business."
He added that "I've got a col
lection of fake IDs that you
wouldn't believe. There are well
over a hundred of them."
Identification problems
would multiply if the drinking
age were lowered to 18, an emp
loye at a nearby tavern pre
dicted.
"The difference between 18
and 21 is relatively dramatic in
terms of physiognamy and per
sonal character," he said. "I can
pick out theunder-21s now,but I
don't think I could tell a 1 5-year
old from an 18-year-old."
Vacations
The employe said his tavern
had experienced no difficulties
with the Department of Al
coholic Beverage Control, "be
cause we do most of the policing
ourselves. But," he continued, "I
know of two other places around
here that are a lot less strict. At
one of them, the owner takes a

two-month vacation every time
he gets busted."
An employe at that tavern said
"we don't have anywhere near as
much trouble as we did a year
ago, when we had to check IDs so
damn close." He speculated that
minors are "now doing their

drinking at house parties, which
is fine with me."
And as long as the legal drink
ing age nominally remains at 21,
most students under 21 will
probably continue to do their
drinking at "house parties" ac
ross the campus.

you're doing," he explained,
"hut the first one's usually about
$250. After that they get much
stiffer, and your license may be
revoked. I paid one of $2000 15
years ago, and never again."
He noted that "lots of minors
come in, just continually. 1 guess
they're hoping they don't get
asked for IDs.
"If the drinking age were low
ered, we'd sell to the younger
people," he added. "It's a matter
of survival. But it's, not some
thing I'd like to see. 1 just don't
think they're mature enough."
Mom-and-Pop
Another local liquor store
manager also opposed a lower
ing of the drinking age, but said
"some of the mom-and-pop type
grocery stores may sell to
minors. They've got a small vol
ume and high markup, and they
need the business. But legiti
mate liquor stores just don't
need that kind of business."
He added that "I've got a col
lection of fake IDs that you
wouldn't believe. There are well
over a hundred of them."
Identification problems
would multiply if the drinking
age were lowered to 18, an emp
loye at a nearby tavern pre
dicted.
"The difference between 18
and 21 is relatively dramatic in
terms of physiognamy and per
sonal character," he said. "I can
pick out theunder-21s now,but I
don't think I could tell a 1 5-year
old from an 18-year-old."
Vacations
The employe said his tavern
had experienced no difficulties
with the Department of Al
coholic Beverage Control, "be
cause we do most of the policing
ourselves. But," he continued, "I
know of two other places around
here that are a lot less strict. At
one of them, the owner takes a

two-month vacation every time
he gets busted."
An employe at that tavern said
"we don't have anywhere near as
much trouble as we did a year
ago, when we had to check IDs so
damn close." He speculated that
minors are "now doing their

drinking at house parties, which
is fine with me."
And as long as the legal drink
ing age nominally remains at 21,
most students under 21 will
probably continue to do their
drinking at "house parties" ac
ross the campus.



THE BARTENDER'S BIBI.E—If confronted by a dubious looking out
of state drivers license, a bartender just has to check the Drivers
License Guide to see if the ID really is legitimate. "I wouldn't be
without it," one bartender said.
