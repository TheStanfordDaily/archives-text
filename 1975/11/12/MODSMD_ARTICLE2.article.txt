# Frat tasters puzzle over beers
## 
### TIM W. FERGUSON 
One can indeed tell European beer from the lower
priced domestic brew, a panel of Stanford experts has
determined.
Converging on the Daily office for a scientific sampl
ing of campus tastes, representatives of nine fraternities
proved that imported Heinecken was discernible to the
discerning drinker.
Asked to sort out six brands from unmarked cups, the
frat rats generally fared poorly, but five were able to spot
the Heinecken.
A case of five
"Bring in a case of that number five," Delta Upsilon's
Mike Mcßride said, referring to the coded Heinecken.
"That was great."
"No way, 'cause that stuff's horrible," replied Kappa
Alpha's Tim Conway, embarrassing the proud connois
seurs of his lakeside house.
Mcßride wrote on his scoresheet beside number five,
"There's only one Heinecken." John Percival of Delta
Kappa Epsilon also noted the difference. "Much more
body, taste than other beers. By far better than (the)
other, American beers," he wrote of Heinecken.
Percival tied for the taste championship with Todd
Anderson of Delta Tau Delta, but both got only three of
six right. Contestants had great difficulty distinguish
ing among five American brands: Michelob, Budweiser,
Coors, Old Milwaukee and Olympia.
All the same
"They all taste the same," complained Anderson.
"Are you sure you didn't poor all the same beer into
different cups?" questioned fellow champion Percival
(before the results were in).
The Anheuser-Busch breweries suffered the most
embarrassing setback of the evening when only one
panelist correctly identified their top-of-the-line

Michelob.
Sigma Chi's Tom Maravilla said of his disguised
Michelob, "This is the one that's terrible." Two other
drinkers complained of its "green" color, and some
mistook it for the budget-priced Old Milwaukee.
Special abuse
Refined tongues were able to single out Old Mil
waukee for special abuse, however. "Tastes metallic,not
as mellow," wrote the Dekes' Percival. "Number one
loses. Even if it's free, I don't want anymore," wrote
Conway about Old Milwaukee. After a few sips, he
declared "Throw this shit away!"
TheCoors mystique survived the test, as four guzzlers
spotted the Rocky Mountain elixir.
Pueblo, Colo, native Maravilla, however, failed to
identify Coors after claiming he had "grown up on the
stuff."
It may be the water which makes Olympia distinctive,
but the fraternity men found nothing special about it.
Only one correctly named it, and three substituted
Budweiser in its place.
Other finishers
Trailing Percival and Anderson with two correct
answers each were Maravilla, Mcßride, Mark Mueller of
Kappa Sigma and James Edwards of Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon.
Conway and Dan Burd of Theta Xi picked only one
right, while Tom Vasquez of Alpha Delta Phi missed
them all.
Contest authorities, however, placed Vasquez ahead
of representatives of Beta Theta Pi. Theta Delta Chi and
Phi Delta Theta. who failed to show up. President Ron
Pelligrini of Zeta I'si, meanwhile, was judged last for
assigning drinking a priority lower than another vice,
which caused his absence as well.

"No way, 'cause that stuff's horrible," replied Kappa
Alpha's Tim Conway, embarrassing the proud connois
seurs of his lakeside house.
Mcßride wrote on his scoresheet beside number five,
"There's only one Heinecken." John Percival of Delta
Kappa Epsilon also noted the difference. "Much more
body, taste than other beers. By far better than (the)
other, American beers," he wrote of Heinecken.
Percival tied for the taste championship with Todd
Anderson of Delta Tau Delta, but both got only three of
six right. Contestants had great difficulty distinguish
ing among five American brands: Michelob, Budweiser,
Coors, Old Milwaukee and Olympia.
All the same
"They all taste the same," complained Anderson.
"Are you sure you didn't poor all the same beer into
different cups?" questioned fellow champion Percival
(before the results were in).
The Anheuser-Busch breweries suffered the most
embarrassing setback of the evening when only one
panelist correctly identified their top-of-the-line

Michelob.
Sigma Chi's Tom Maravilla said of his disguised
Michelob, "This is the one that's terrible." Two other
drinkers complained of its "green" color, and some
mistook it for the budget-priced Old Milwaukee.
Special abuse
Refined tongues were able to single out Old Mil
waukee for special abuse, however. "Tastes metallic,not
as mellow," wrote the Dekes' Percival. "Number one
loses. Even if it's free, I don't want anymore," wrote
Conway about Old Milwaukee. After a few sips, he
declared "Throw this shit away!"
TheCoors mystique survived the test, as four guzzlers
spotted the Rocky Mountain elixir.
Pueblo, Colo, native Maravilla, however, failed to
identify Coors after claiming he had "grown up on the
stuff."
It may be the water which makes Olympia distinctive,
but the fraternity men found nothing special about it.
Only one correctly named it, and three substituted
Budweiser in its place.
Other finishers
Trailing Percival and Anderson with two correct
answers each were Maravilla, Mcßride, Mark Mueller of
Kappa Sigma and James Edwards of Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon.
Conway and Dan Burd of Theta Xi picked only one
right, while Tom Vasquez of Alpha Delta Phi missed
them all.
Contest authorities, however, placed Vasquez ahead
of representatives of Beta Theta Pi. Theta Delta Chi and
Phi Delta Theta. who failed to show up. President Ron
Pelligrini of Zeta I'si, meanwhile, was judged last for
assigning drinking a priority lower than another vice,
which caused his absence as well.

One can indeed tell European beer from the lower
priced domestic brew, a panel of Stanford experts has
determined.
Converging on the Daily office for a scientific sampl
ing of campus tastes, representatives of nine fraternities
proved that imported Heinecken was discernible to the
discerning drinker.
Asked to sort out six brands from unmarked cups, the
frat rats generally fared poorly, but five were able to spot
the Heinecken.
A case of five
"Bring in a case of that number five," Delta Upsilon's
Mike Mcßride said, referring to the coded Heinecken.
"That was great."

Alpha's Tim Conway, embarrassing the proud connois
