# San Jose pub serves beer, band, boredom
## 
### RIV WEBER 
(Editor's note: Two months ago. Son lose State made headlines by
becoming the first state college or university to sell an alcoholic
beverage on campus. Since then, other schools including San
Francisco State have followed the Spartan's lead. Even Stanford is
considering a pub.J

Pitchers of dark beer center
piece the tables, and a two-man
band provides another diver
sion. but the lifeless drinkers
around you make this tavern a
disappointment.
You're working on a pitcher of
beer at San Jose State's Spartan
Pub, and you're startled by how
quiet everyone is and by how
few students have come in. A
bartender says the average cus
tomer is 27 years old; tonight
they look even older.
Except for the beer, the Spar
tan seems like just another cam
pus eatery.
It's been two months since the
Spartan became the first estab
lishment to serve liquor on a
state university campus. And
how has this pioneering pub
been doing? An employe assures
you things have improved since
a rushed opening.
Commuter school
The waiters say Wednesday
and Thursday nights are big for
the dorm crowd, but when you
stop by on Friday, its clear why
San Jose is called a "commuter
school." Wherever the students
go on weekends, it's not the
Spartan Pub.
Versatile Bertram Washington
strikes you as the most lively
person in the Spartan. Doorman,
waiter and pretzlemaker, he con
fronts you with his life story.
"There's not a person in here
who don't know who 1 am," he
says.
Rowdies
"Rowdy" types are asked to
leave by Bouncer Bertram. A
mother and daughter begin to
get excited as they discuss their
problems. Washington coolly.

but forcefully sends them out.
"If something (the pub) be
longs to the students, it's like
their living room, and you
wouldn't mess up your
momma's house, would ya?" he
explains.
The pub is a nonprofit organi
zation, and Donna the waitress
says laughing, "I don't know
where the money goes."
Big name bands
She listens to tonight's
guitarists for a moment, then
turns to you and says"I hope
they use the money to get some
big name bands. 1 know we're
losing customers to other nearby
pubs with better bands."
There's a wide selection of
beers, including dark and light
Pabst and Qlvmpia. Coors, Bud,
and Michelob on tap, and
Heinecken for the refined palate.
The dark beers flow quickest,
followed by the Golden, Col
orado special. That jumbo
pitcher was yours for under $2.
A Playgirl pinup of a virile fel
low catches your eye. And to
keep Mr. Reynolds happy,
there's a foldout of last year's Oc
tober playmate only a few inches
away.
Peanut shells
If you can't drink beer without
something to eat, take your pick
of peanuts, pretzels or a sand
wiches at the deli counter. Just
be sure to put your peanut shells
iu the designated containers, or
Washington will come have
words with you.
Donna, working at the pub
since day one. believes the only
way to make students feel this is
the campus pub "is if you give
them something." Looking
around, you wonder what they
have to give.
