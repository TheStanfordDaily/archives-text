# ...as pub plans here hit snag

### GEORGE ANDERS 
Generalissimo Franco is near
death, Teddy Kennedy won't
run for President, and plans to
put a pub in Tresidder Union
have hit a new snag.
So what else is new? Well this
time the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board (ABC) has de
cided to hold a formal hearing on
a proposal to establish "Little
Iceland's Pub" at Tresidder. ac
cording to Bob Caselli, director
of food services at Tresidder.
Earlier, Caselli had said lie ex
pected little difficulty getting
the pub approved by the ABC.
But, Caselli recalled "We were
required for one month to post
public notice of our intention to
serve alcohol on the premises.
"During that period, anyone
could file a protest and request a

formal hearing," he added.
"Well one student did. It was
only a moral protest, and in ten
tative conversations with the
ABC I got the impression that
there are no legal grounds for the
protest. But it still requires a
hearing."
Caselli noted that the ABC
does not have to finish the hear
ing until Jan. 21. "But they're
usually quite quick about these
things, and I'd expect a decision
by the beginning of December,"
he said.
If the proposal is approved,
Caselli said the next step would
be to make a detailed cost study
to decide whether a pub would
be profitable. "It's conceivable
that it wouldn't be, and we'd
have to stop right there." Caselli
said. "But right now our gut feel

ing is that it would be financially
successful."
Plans for the pub are still ten
tative, Assoc. Dean of Students
Dan Williams said, but beer will
be the strongest beverage served.
"ABC won't grant a license for
wine or anything stronger for the
kind of operation we're plan
ning." Caselli said.
The pub would be located in
what's now Tresidder's game
room, Caselli said. "We'd move
out the pool tables, relocate the
pinball machines, and serve hot
sandwiches and pretzles and
other foods that compliment
beer," Caselli said.
"We'd put the pinball
machines in a room with a sepa
rate entry, so minors could
enter," he added.
