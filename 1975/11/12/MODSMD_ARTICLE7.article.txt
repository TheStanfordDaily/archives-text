There was no "Welcome to

This building housed the

is done in casks at the upper

WINE HAVEN — Tlio Ridge wine cellar is exactly

ground for new wine. The air is cool, damp and

The back wall of the cellar continually seeps
water onto the floor, which in the summer creates
a small stream across the cellar. But in the winter
the stream becomes "a veritable river!" The walls

WINE HAVEN — Tlio Ridge wine cellar is exactly

filled with the smell of wine soaked wood.
The back wall of the cellar continually seeps

a small stream across the cellar. But in the winter
the stream becomes "a veritable river!" The walls
of the cellar are the original masonry laid in
