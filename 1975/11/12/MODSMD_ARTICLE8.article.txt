# Bar tour features antiques, carved tables and booze
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on
the foivn -famous saying inscribed in the
grooves of many "455."
A night or even an afternoon "on the
town" will cost the most frugal Stanford
student a few bucks these days. Hut due to
the proliferation of new drinking estab
lishments, it doesn't cost much to get
there.
It's still a good sweaty bike ride to the
Alpine Beer Gardens on Alpine Road.
There an eclectic crowd of businessmen
on long lunch hours, students, dogs and
people who live in the hills of Portola
Valley or La Honda lounge in the sun and
drink beer.
Inside there are a few pinball machines
to occupy the people who don't like the
outdoors. A small space at the bar and a
few tables wait for rainy days, but the bulk
of the crowd is usually in the spacious
beer garden, which consists of many old
picnic tables and benches.
Begging dogs
There's always a compliment of dogs
both inside and outside the fence that en
closes the outdoor garden. The dogs are
accomplished beggars, getting more meat
a day than a six-pack of Alpo.
"1 cofrie up here to catch some sun and
drink some beer," said a Stanford under
grad who requested anonymity. "I should
spend more time studying," he said, and
laughed. In his hand was a plasticcup full
of beer that has become a trademark of

Zot's as the place is fondly known.
Trademarks of a different kind are plen
tiful at one of the newest drinking spots
near Stanford. Antiques are the trademark
of the Antique Restaurant, which serves
plenty of beer, wine and music to a pre
dominantly young crowd.
On a recent weekend evening a
guitarist performing that evening was
heard to say, "There's a lot of college
coeds here," in a matter of fact way.
Folding chairs
Matter of fact is the way many of the
antiques are treated. Waiters carry them
around and set them up as if they were
aluminum folding chairs.
Much of the restaurant area is taken up
by enclosed booths, leaving little space
for the entertainers or dancers. However,
lack of space doesn't seem to impede cus
tomers or the waitresses, who eventually
get to everyone.
"It beats the Muzak at the bank, and its a
lot looser here," a willowy waitress re
marked as she balanced a trayful of beer
bottles and glasses. Loose but rustic
seems to have made a success of this
newest addition to Stanford's drinking
places.
Harder spirits
The Gatehouse, another new spot, fea
tures harder spirits in addition to wine
and beer. It's full of antiques, but they are
treated in a less cavalier fashion than
those in the Antique. Here the mood is
more subdued, even dressy, although no

special costume is needed for admission
to the bar.
"This is the closest thing to going to
San Francisco," said a dark-haired Stan
ford coed, enjoying a late-night libation.
"It's not nearly so raucous as some other
places." she contined, "so it's more relax
ing to come here."
Indeed, everything is refined, and it's
not the place to come for any whooping
and hollering. It's more a place for quiet
conversations and more intimate mo
ments. The bar. visible from the street,
always looks neat and clean, and the seats
always seem to be occupied.
Beer heaven
The closest, most talked-about beer
drinkers haven (or is it heaven?) is the
Oasis, just over the San Francisquito
creek in Menlo Park. The sign is very

small for a place serving such a large vol
ume of beer and burgers.
At any time of the day burgers are fry
ing and beer is being quaffed. In addition,
there are some under 21 types who try to
bluff their way in without proper identifi
cation.
But it's all part of the ambience of the
place, where generations of Stanford stu
dents have left calling cards carved in the
booths and tables. Carving is encouraged,
not frowned upon, so when alums come
back for their 10th or 25th reunion, they
can still locate the message they left in
their undergrad days.
No big deal
Children can get in, but only with par
ents and then only to eat the food and
drink the soft drinks. Once one gets in, it's
not really sudi a big deal. The place is
very informal, noisy and furnished in
early American decrepit.
Nothing is falling apart, but everything
is carved up and looks well used. There is
a small outdoor garden, not nearly as
large as Zot's, but it's burgers and beer
that people come to eat and drink from
miles around.


A BUSY NIGHT—As usual, the Oasis' ambience has drawn a full
house. The Menlo Park tavern is prohahly the most talked about one in the Mid-Peninsula.

Matter of fact is the way many of the
antiques are treated. Waiters carry them
around and set them up as if they were
aluminum folding chairs.
Much of the restaurant area is taken up
by enclosed booths, leaving little space
for the entertainers or dancers. However,
lack of space doesn't seem to impede cus
tomers or the waitresses, who eventually
get to everyone.
"It beats the Muzak at the bank, and its a
lot looser here," a willowy waitress re
marked as she balanced a trayful of beer
bottles and glasses. Loose but rustic
seems to have made a success of this
newest addition to Stanford's drinking
places.
Harder spirits
The Gatehouse, another new spot, fea
tures harder spirits in addition to wine
and beer. It's full of antiques, but they are
treated in a less cavalier fashion than
those in the Antique. Here the mood is
more subdued, even dressy, although no

special costume is needed for admission
to the bar.
"This is the closest thing to going to
San Francisco," said a dark-haired Stan
ford coed, enjoying a late-night libation.
"It's not nearly so raucous as some other
places." she contined, "so it's more relax
ing to come here."
Indeed, everything is refined, and it's
not the place to come for any whooping
and hollering. It's more a place for quiet
conversations and more intimate mo
ments. The bar. visible from the street,
always looks neat and clean, and the seats
always seem to be occupied.
Beer heaven
The closest, most talked-about beer
drinkers haven (or is it heaven?) is the
Oasis, just over the San Francisquito
creek in Menlo Park. The sign is very

small for a place serving such a large vol
ume of beer and burgers.
At any time of the day burgers are fry
ing and beer is being quaffed. In addition,
there are some under 21 types who try to
bluff their way in without proper identifi
cation.
But it's all part of the ambience of the
place, where generations of Stanford stu
dents have left calling cards carved in the
booths and tables. Carving is encouraged,
not frowned upon, so when alums come
back for their 10th or 25th reunion, they
can still locate the message they left in
their undergrad days.
No big deal
Children can get in, but only with par
ents and then only to eat the food and
drink the soft drinks. Once one gets in, it's
not really sudi a big deal. The place is
very informal, noisy and furnished in
early American decrepit.
Nothing is falling apart, but everything
is carved up and looks well used. There is
a small outdoor garden, not nearly as
large as Zot's, but it's burgers and beer
that people come to eat and drink from
miles around.


A BUSY NIGHT—As usual, the Oasis' ambience has drawn a full
house. The Menlo Park tavern is prohahly the most talked about one in the Mid-Peninsula.

INSTANT MANHOOD—A few beers at the Oasis tavern can bring out the best in
anyone.
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on
the foivn -famous saying inscribed in the
grooves of many "455."
A night or even an afternoon "on the
town" will cost the most frugal Stanford
student a few bucks these days. Hut due to
the proliferation of new drinking estab
lishments, it doesn't cost much to get
there.
It's still a good sweaty bike ride to the
Alpine Beer Gardens on Alpine Road.
There an eclectic crowd of businessmen
on long lunch hours, students, dogs and
people who live in the hills of Portola
Valley or La Honda lounge in the sun and
drink beer.
Inside there are a few pinball machines
to occupy the people who don't like the
outdoors. A small space at the bar and a
few tables wait for rainy days, but the bulk
of the crowd is usually in the spacious
beer garden, which consists of many old
picnic tables and benches.
Begging dogs
There's always a compliment of dogs
both inside and outside the fence that en
closes the outdoor garden. The dogs are
accomplished beggars, getting more meat
a day than a six-pack of Alpo.
"1 cofrie up here to catch some sun and
drink some beer," said a Stanford under
grad who requested anonymity. "I should
spend more time studying," he said, and
laughed. In his hand was a plasticcup full
of beer that has become a trademark of

Zot's as the place is fondly known.
Trademarks of a different kind are plen
tiful at one of the newest drinking spots
near Stanford. Antiques are the trademark
of the Antique Restaurant, which serves
plenty of beer, wine and music to a pre
dominantly young crowd.
On a recent weekend evening a
guitarist performing that evening was
heard to say, "There's a lot of college
coeds here," in a matter of fact way.

ing and beer is being quaffed. In addition,
there are some under 21 types who try to
bluff their way in without proper identifi
cation.
But it's all part of the ambience of the
place, where generations of Stanford stu
dents have left calling cards carved in the
booths and tables. Carving is encouraged,
not frowned upon, so when alums come
back for their 10th or 25th reunion, they
can still locate the message they left in
their undergrad days.
No big deal
Children can get in, but only with par
ents and then only to eat the food and
drink the soft drinks. Once one gets in, it's
not really sudi a big deal. The place is
very informal, noisy and furnished in
early American decrepit.
Nothing is falling apart, but everything
is carved up and looks well used. There is
a small outdoor garden, not nearly as
large as Zot's, but it's burgers and beer
that people come to eat and drink from
miles around.


A BUSY NIGHT—As usual, the Oasis' ambience has drawn a full
house. The Menlo Park tavern is prohahly the most talked about one in the Mid-Peninsula.

INSTANT MANHOOD—A few beers at the Oasis tavern can bring out the best in
anyone.
Oh Lord, won't you buy me a night on
the foivn -famous saying inscribed in the
grooves of many "455."
A night or even an afternoon "on the
town" will cost the most frugal Stanford
student a few bucks these days. Hut due to
the proliferation of new drinking estab
lishments, it doesn't cost much to get
there.
It's still a good sweaty bike ride to the
Alpine Beer Gardens on Alpine Road.
There an eclectic crowd of businessmen
on long lunch hours, students, dogs and
people who live in the hills of Portola
Valley or La Honda lounge in the sun and
drink beer.
Inside there are a few pinball machines
to occupy the people who don't like the
outdoors. A small space at the bar and a
few tables wait for rainy days, but the bulk
of the crowd is usually in the spacious
beer garden, which consists of many old
picnic tables and benches.
Begging dogs
There's always a compliment of dogs
both inside and outside the fence that en
closes the outdoor garden. The dogs are
accomplished beggars, getting more meat
a day than a six-pack of Alpo.
"1 cofrie up here to catch some sun and
drink some beer," said a Stanford under
grad who requested anonymity. "I should
spend more time studying," he said, and
laughed. In his hand was a plasticcup full
of beer that has become a trademark of

Zot's as the place is fondly known.
Trademarks of a different kind are plen
tiful at one of the newest drinking spots
near Stanford. Antiques are the trademark
of the Antique Restaurant, which serves
plenty of beer, wine and music to a pre
dominantly young crowd.
On a recent weekend evening a
guitarist performing that evening was
heard to say, "There's a lot of college
coeds here," in a matter of fact way.
Folding chairs
Matter of fact is the way many of the
antiques are treated. Waiters carry them
around and set them up as if they were
aluminum folding chairs.
Much of the restaurant area is taken up
by enclosed booths, leaving little space
for the entertainers or dancers. However,
lack of space doesn't seem to impede cus
tomers or the waitresses, who eventually
get to everyone.
"It beats the Muzak at the bank, and its a
lot looser here," a willowy waitress re
marked as she balanced a trayful of beer
bottles and glasses. Loose but rustic
seems to have made a success of this
newest addition to Stanford's drinking
places.
Harder spirits
The Gatehouse, another new spot, fea
tures harder spirits in addition to wine
and beer. It's full of antiques, but they are
treated in a less cavalier fashion than
those in the Antique. Here the mood is
more subdued, even dressy, although no

special costume is needed for admission
to the bar.
"This is the closest thing to going to
San Francisco," said a dark-haired Stan
ford coed, enjoying a late-night libation.
"It's not nearly so raucous as some other
places." she contined, "so it's more relax
ing to come here."
Indeed, everything is refined, and it's
not the place to come for any whooping
and hollering. It's more a place for quiet
conversations and more intimate mo
ments. The bar. visible from the street,
always looks neat and clean, and the seats
always seem to be occupied.
Beer heaven
The closest, most talked-about beer
drinkers haven (or is it heaven?) is the
Oasis, just over the San Francisquito
creek in Menlo Park. The sign is very

small for a place serving such a large vol
ume of beer and burgers.
