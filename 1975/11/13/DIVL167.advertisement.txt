EVEN FUNNIER THAN THE FIRST ONE!
Last year one of the finest comedies in a long time came out of
France called "THE TALL BLOND MAN WITH ONE BLACK SHOE!'
and introduced a zany new comedian, Pierre Richard. Directed by
Yves Robert, the film received unanimous raves but only in a few
places did the word get out to a wide audience.
Now Richaid and Robert have teamed up again in "THE RETURN
OF THE TALL BLOND MAN!' And they have proven that a sequel
can be just as funny as the original.
In its short time in release critics have called "THE RETURN even
funnier than the original and have compared Richard with every
one from Jacques Tati to Peter Sellers. In this one the madcap
Richard proceeds to drive the CIA completely bananas. It doesn't
matter if you didn't see the first one, "THE RETURN OF THE TALL
BLOND MAN WITH ONE BLACK SHOE" is a brand new evening of
insanity.
