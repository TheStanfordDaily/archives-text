French Connection II
Directed by John Frankenheimer
Trying to measure up to the quality of the
original is an impossible task, but Frank
enheimer has at least come close. Gene
Hackman once again turns in a stellar per
formance as the dogged Popeye Doyle,

now traveling to Marseilles to capture Frog
One, his nemesis, who instead captures
him and makes him a heroin addict. The first
half of the film is excruciatingly slow, as
Popeye battles the French police and is
forced to quit heroin cold turkey. The sec
ond half of the picture switches into high
gear and never lets up until the final
second "*

The Other Side Of The Moun
tain
Directed by Larry Peerce
The story of almost-Olympic skier Jill Kin
mont, who became paralyzed after a 1955
skiing accident, is irreparably damaged by
expressionless acting by Marilyn Hassett as
Kinmont, a soapy and maudlin narration,
and an equally poor script. Beau Bridges is
also lacking in talent as her boyfriend."
Three Days Of The Condor
Directed by Sydney Pollack
Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway star in
this extremely timely CIA thriller, about an
employe who finds himself hunted by both
the public CIA and an internal organization
that has already slain his co-workers. While
it is not the most original spy thriller ever
produced, Redford as the man with no con
trol over his destiny (rather than as the
macho superman always in power) makes
this an interesting venture.""
A Boy and His Dog
Directed by L.Q. Jones
A far-out science fiction story of a master
pet relationship after nuclear holocaust that
is not always confined to the human being
superior. Blood, the dog, communicates
with his master, Vic (Don Johnson) through
telepathy and has a highly developed sense
of smell. While this situation makes for
some funny and poignant moments, the
movie as a whole leaves a lot of questions
about how the world evolved to that state
unanswered. Not for discerning sci-fi
buffs.*"
