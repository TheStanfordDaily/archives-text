# 'Condor' — suspenseful spy flick
## 
### 
reviewed by Marcv Stovall
Spy movies in one form or
anothe. have always been a Hol
lywood staple. Typically these
films featured a dashing hero
who, accompanied by a lovely
heroine, ran around trying to ob
tain some top-secret information
from a foreign government or
keep a valuable secret from fal
ling into the wrong hands.
It used to be that the enemy
was clearly defined: He was on
the "other side," trying to do
harm to "our side." Now, how
ever, the times are not so simple
and Americans are just as likely
to be endangered by their own
network of spies as by anybody
else's.
Thus we have Three Days of
the Condor, a new film starring
Robert Redford and Faye Duna
way, which attempts to deal
with the dangers of a complex
organization like the Central In
telligence Agency (CIA).
Though the plot is sometimes
confusing and director Sidney
Pollack lets some scenes become
cliched, Three Days of the
Condor is a successful suspense
film. Redford — code-named
"Condor" — works for an obs
cure branch of the CIA that reads
material published throughout
the world, putting it into CIA
computers.
One p.m. — none well
Redford returns from lunch
one day to find his six co
workers murdered. It soon seems
that the CIA (and everybody
else) is out to kill him, too, so
Redford goes on the run until he
can figure out what's going on.
kidnaping Faye Dunaway en
route.
After all the twists and com
plications. when the action is re
solved and the secrets unco
vered it all seems too simple.
If the plot is hard to follow, the
acting saves the movie. Both
Redford and Dunaway have
parts not typically associated
with their names.
'Condor' flounders
Redford usually plays a
romantic hero or tough guy who
is completely in charge needing
only a smile to charm his way

out of trouble. But as Condor he
is at the mercy of forces he
doesn't understand, and his
fright and confusion are believa
ble.
Dunaway is wonderful in a
role quite different from the
elegant Evelyn Mulray of
Chinatown. She has some great
lines that on their own make the
movie worthwhile.

While Three Days of the
Condor is not a profound movie,
it is frightening in the same way
The Conversation is frightening:
conjuring images of surveillance
and intelligence gone out of con
trol. Three Days of the Condor
pulls into its action, so if you're
looking for a suspenseful flick
and want to see Robert Redford
use his acting talents, this is it.
