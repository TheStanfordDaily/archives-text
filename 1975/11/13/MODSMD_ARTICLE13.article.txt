# Movie classics come cheaper by the 100s
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Ever since Congress denied
television advertising time to
cigarette companies, the adver
tising firms handling tobacco
accounts have been devising
radical new ways of keeping
cigarette names in the public
conscious.
This year's prize for most
public-spirited and imaginative
program goes to Philip Morris,
manufacturers of Benson &
Hedges 100s, among other
cigarettes. They are sponsoring
the "Benson & Hedges 100" —
100 of the greatest movie classics
from 1930 to 1955.
The "Benson & Hedges 100"
begins tomorrow at midnight in
San Francisco with five initial
movies, one each Friday and
Saturday night for five weeks,
starting with Gene Kelly and
Rita Havworth in Cover Girl.
The innovations of Benson &
Hedges that take this festival
beyond familiarity are the price
and the extra added attractions

at the theater.
The price is as economic as
they come — 99 cents, which in
cludes not only a brand-new
print of the movie but also
period newsreels, cartoons and a
movie shorts from the exact year
the movie was released, provid
ing a true trip back into time.
Walking into the Metro
Theatre on Union Street on Fri
days and Saturdays at midnight
from now until December will be
like stepping onto a time
machine, enabling one to see ex
actly what one's parents and
grandparents saw, for almost the
same price.
One other question remains
unanswered, though. When was
the last time you were walking
down Union Street in San Fran
cisco at midnight with nothing
to do? How many people are
going to be willing to go out at
midnight especially for this en
tertainment package? Only time
will tell.
