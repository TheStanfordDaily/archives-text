# 'Tooth of Crime' shows fast-paced brilliance

It's no secret that avant-garde artforms
are often baffling, and Sam Shepard's
award-winning play Tooth of Crime
which opened last Friday in Berkeley is
no exception.
Ostensibly, Tooth of Crime is the story
of an aging pop singer waiting in his
mansion for a young gypsy who is coming
to challenge him for his possessions and
power. Tooth of Crime is like a Tom
Wolfe-styled trivia quiz. The brilliant bon
mots and split-second verbal punches
force the audience to think, associate and
react simultaneously.
Actually Tooth confronts the audience
on several different levels. The intriguing
set, designed by sculptor Anthony Au
stin, is a stunning allegory by itself, a sort
of Monopoly game for delinquents.
The performing area is a baby-blue box
ing ring with a huge dice-shaped chair
complete with an attached stick-shift,
surrounded by a sidewalk of marked
squares.
All the play's action occurs within this
roped-in arena, and Hoss, the aging rock
star, is the central figure. Indeed Hoss is
apparently a "mob"-created rock hero, a
captive in his own game. He relies on
astrological charts and a doctor pushing
heroin and methadrine to maintain his
supremacy and insanity.
On one level Shepard's play is a bril
liant mixture of the best of the Clockwork
Orange and Tommy genre. The characters
act. sing, kill and speak a lightning-fast
hip jive that would put a tobacco au
ctioneer to shame.
Although the play's opening act is
highlighted by first-rate singing and live
accompaniment, the second act contains
the real climax. In it, the two competing
rock heroes, Hoss and Crow — the gypsy
contender — square off and verbally jab

each other to the breaking point.
James Dean, a Magic Theater regular,
plays Hoss with his usual expertise and
deft timing. The rest of the cast, including
Ebbe Roe Smith as the ultra-hip Crow,
and Sigrid Wurschmidt as Hoss's woman,
also give exceptionally strong singing
and acting performances.
The play runs a little long; including
one intermission, it was just short of
two-and-one-half hours.
Nonetheless, "meaning and
message"-minded viewers will find
Tooth of Crime full of political, social and
cultural allegories.
Performances continue at 8:30 p.m. on
Fridays and Saturdays, and at 7 p.m. on
Sundays through Dec. 7 at the Cat's Paw
Palace, Berkeley.
