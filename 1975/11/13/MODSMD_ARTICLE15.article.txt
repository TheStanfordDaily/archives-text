# Denver pollutes Xmas music scene
## 
### 
reviewed by Dave Ansley
According to a recent Associated Press
story, "Despite its reputation for clean
mountain air and bright, sparkling sun
shine, Denver's air is as polluted as any in
the country, experts say." It would seem
that John Denver's songs have perhaps
been exaggerating the cleanliness just a
bit.
But after listening to the Country Boy's
latest album, Rocky Mountain Christmas,
the city should blame its singing
namesake for a good portion of the foul
air.
Don't get me wrong. 1 proudly admit to
liking John Denver, but hereally blew this
one. Commercial production is one of the
chief causes of dirty air, and this album is
one of the best examples of blatant com
mercialism around.
Christmas albums are nothing unusual
— everyone from Andy Williams to

Johnny Cash has put one out — but how
many different ways can you sing "Silent
Night"? The entire alhum is Christmas
oriented, and out of 12 cuts, only two
were written by Denver. Colorado's poet
laureate didn't get much of a chance to
show his stuff.
The album does demonstrate that he is
maturing, however. His voice is notice
ably stronger, with a vibrancy and rich
ness not heard on much of his earlier
work. In addition, Rocky Mountain
Christmas features a lot more string ar
rangements in the backup instrumentals
tTian in other albums. It's too bad they
make his Christmas songs sound a lot like
everyone else's Christmas songs.
Denver performs such old favorites as
"Oh. Holy Night," "Silver Bells," "Away
in a Manger " and "What Child is This."
Traditionalist song lovers who enjoy his
voice might go for the album. But thev

will probably be put off by such ballads as
"Daddy, Don't Get Drunk This Christ
inas" and "Christmas for Cowboys." The
country crowd might enjoy those, but
shun the other bland renditions.
The only traditional song worthy of
air-play is his countrified version of
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." You
have to hear it to believe how funny it
sounds. Somehow, guitars at the North
I'ole just don't make it.
We didn't need a Christmas album,
especially when Denver could be direct
ing his talents into much more pleasura
ble music. I suspect that he (with a lot of
prompting from RCA) decided to make a
quick buck by putting out a record that
would please everyone. Unfortunately
most of the album is a disappointment.
And who wants to be in that kind "of
mood at Christmas?

tTian in other albums. It's too bad they
make his Christmas songs sound a lot like
everyone else's Christmas songs.
Denver performs such old favorites as
"Oh. Holy Night," "Silver Bells," "Away
in a Manger " and "What Child is This."
Traditionalist song lovers who enjoy his
voice might go for the album. But thev

will probably be put off by such ballads as
"Daddy, Don't Get Drunk This Christ
inas" and "Christmas for Cowboys." The
country crowd might enjoy those, but
shun the other bland renditions.
The only traditional song worthy of
air-play is his countrified version of
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." You
have to hear it to believe how funny it
sounds. Somehow, guitars at the North
I'ole just don't make it.
We didn't need a Christmas album,
especially when Denver could be direct
ing his talents into much more pleasura
ble music. I suspect that he (with a lot of
prompting from RCA) decided to make a
quick buck by putting out a record that
would please everyone. Unfortunately
most of the album is a disappointment.
And who wants to be in that kind "of
mood at Christmas?

According to a recent Associated Press
story, "Despite its reputation for clean
mountain air and bright, sparkling sun
shine, Denver's air is as polluted as any in
the country, experts say." It would seem
that John Denver's songs have perhaps
been exaggerating the cleanliness just a
bit.
But after listening to the Country Boy's
latest album, Rocky Mountain Christmas,
the city should blame its singing
namesake for a good portion of the foul
air.
Don't get me wrong. 1 proudly admit to
liking John Denver, but hereally blew this
one. Commercial production is one of the
chief causes of dirty air, and this album is
one of the best examples of blatant com
mercialism around.
Christmas albums are nothing unusual
— everyone from Andy Williams to

Johnny Cash has put one out — but how
many different ways can you sing "Silent
Night"? The entire alhum is Christmas
oriented, and out of 12 cuts, only two
were written by Denver. Colorado's poet
laureate didn't get much of a chance to
show his stuff.
The album does demonstrate that he is
maturing, however. His voice is notice
ably stronger, with a vibrancy and rich
ness not heard on much of his earlier
work. In addition, Rocky Mountain
Christmas features a lot more string ar
rangements in the backup instrumentals
