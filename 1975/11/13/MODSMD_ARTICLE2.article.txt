# Daniel Spoerri wants to feed you a roast-beef turkey with chocolate gravy
## 
### Mary Anderson 
While a patron studies the
menu, champagne glasses clink
at the corner table of the restaur
ant. The waiter — looking like
some small-town newspaper
man — inquires, "Would you
like a little Renoir with your
pheasant?"
The scene would delight
artist/chef Daniel Spoerri,
creator of "Eat Art." A firm be
liever in "serving" art to the pub
lic, Spoerri on a given day could
create anything from turkeys
made out of roast beef to gravy
made from chocolate.
It all began in 1963, when
"Galerie J" in Paris became the
"Restaurant de la Galerie J."
Spoerri was the creative chef,
and his art pieces — involving
various kitchen utensils — deco
rated the walls. Art critics acted
as waiters, so they could "feed"
art to consumers.
To this end, Spoerri has done
what he can to make art palatable
— which, to him, means weird.
For example, he opened his re
cent lecture at the San Francisco
Museum of Art with his bizarre
film Resurrection.

According to Spoerri,
Resurrection is a "film back
wards from man shit to cow
shit." It traces the excretion of
human waste back to the act of
eating, then to preparation of a
steak, then to the slaughter of a
cow, then to the cow being fat
tened for the kill, then to eating
and, again, excreting.
Andy Warhol once joined
Spoerri and others in presenting
"31 Variations of a Meal" at the
Parisian gallery/restaurant. The
variations — artistically render
ing many facets of one idea, in
this case a meal — are important
to Spoerri.
In fact, Spoerri has been in the
vanguard of a whole new artistic
trend, called "new realism."
And when Spoerri says
"realism," he means it. He de
nounces artists who create paint
ings which look like photo
graphs.
Pragmatic view
"They spend eight months to
come to the same result as a
photograph . . . like a Zen situa
tion," Spoerri says."I would just
blow up the photograph."

Artistic realism, to Spoerri. is
discovery. If, say, he came upon
a worker's bench with tools, he
might simply fix it to hang from
a wall, as it is.
"At a certain moment, I decide
to 'fix' a certain given moment,
found, without any change by
myself . . . an apparently unar
tistic decision," Spoerri says.
Sharing reality
Spoerri calls these works
"snare pictures," because he
snares, or traps, something from
life in them.
From the snare picture came
the food picture — "abstract
composition of different colored
vegetables and fruits" — and
then. Eat Art.
As he demonstrated via
Kesurrection, Spoerri is a man
fascinated with cycles. His artis
tic life has, to some extent, come
full circle — his latest works in
clude a cake which was an actual
three-dimensional replica of a
snare picture, a digestible work
of art.
Reality threatens
Spoerri's motto is "Attention:
Artwork." His art, he says,
should not just be looked at — it
should provoke a reaction,
something to affect the viewer's
concept of a potentially danger
ous reality.
A rather dramatic past may
have caused Spoerri's constant
study of the questions of reality
and life. His father, a priest
turned Protestant missionary,
was killed by Nazis. Spoerri has
lived in France, Rumania and
Switzerland, and has traveled
extensively.
Spoerri once decided to be
come a missionary in Tibet. He
studied ballet and pantomime,
creating (with Jean Tinguely) the

first mobile ballet scenery.
He has also taught jazz
choreography and is interested
in theatre. So when he first set up
shop with his Restaurant Spoerri
in Dusseldorf in 1968, his
friends were relieved to see him
finally settle down.
Were they wrong. Spoerri's
subsequent efforts to popularize
art have led to appearances on
European television and interna
tional recognition with his
worldwide Eat Art galleries.
Spoerri was recently artist-in

residence at the San Francisco
Art Institute; he catered an Eat
Art banquet while here. And,
characteristically, the unex
pected occurred — a food fight.
What had begun as a highbrow
affair became, to Spoerri, a
source of ridicule.
But Eat Art lives on. Spoerri is
still writing, directing, teaching
and "feeding" art to the public
— in fact, his current Bay Area
display is at San Francisco's
European Gallery through Dec.
6.
