# Stevenson, Inge, Finley
## Card running's back 
### CHRIS BAKER 
When Stanford Coach Jack Christiansen told
the football writers assembled for the Stanford
football press clinic this August, that he was put
ting in the 1-formation to get the ball to Ron Inge
was a classy tailback, but who the hell was going
to be in the backfield with him? The I-formation
requires an experienced back — not a jour
neyman. And at the start of the season, that's what
Stanford had, two journeymen runningbacks.
Hut the journeymen, Don Stevenson and John
Finley, have beccome members of the union.
While the ground attack will always play second
fiddle to the passing game on the Farm, this year it
carried its own share of the load. Opposing
coaches, as if reading from the same prepared
statement, have all praised the Stanford running
attack saying, "You've got to respect it."
Earned respect
The respect is well earned. The Cards have ac
cumulated 1521 yards on the ground this season
— 200 more than last year's total. And Stanford
has finally moved out of last place in conference
rushing statistics, an honor it held for the last two
seasons. Christiansen may not be an advocate of
"three yards and a cloud of dust football." but this
year the Cardinals are averaging 4.5 yards per
rush.
Stevenson says the improved running game is a
result of better blocking. "I think the coordination
(between thebackfield and line) is getting better."
Finley says it's because of the number of times the
Cards are running. "We're rushing more plays
this year. The coaches have confidence in us."
Although Stevenson and Finley compete
against each other for playing time, they both root
for each other when one is out of the game. "We've
got two different styles, "says Stevenson. "But
we're both doing well." Number 36 has rushed for

552 yards this season, while Finley has accumu
lated 2HB yards and he hasn't lost a yard. Inge,
helped by a 150 yard performance against
Washington State has piled up 412 yards this sea
son. Even diminuitive Gary Lynn has rushed for
over 100 yards this season.
Run compliments pass
But Oklahoma, Stanford ain't. "We're the oppo
site of most teams," says Finley. "If you take a
team like us and a team like Oklahoma, they'll run
the ball 80 times and we'll pass 30 times. We use
running to compliment the passing."
Today, against an Oregon squad that is last in
conference rushing defense, Stanford figures to
come out running. But assistant coach Dave (Sur
rey says the Card philosophy is still to pass.
"We'll continue to establish some kind of ground
game to compliment the pass. USC couldn't have
beaten us last year without passing."
And, without the pass, they didn't this year.
Inge knows the philosophy hasn't changed on
the Farm. "Weare still going to put the ball in the
air. It's never been equal, but we are rushing for
more yards this season. The confidence is there."
Simplified attack
Christiansen simplified his rushing attack
against Army and Stanford scored 67 points. "As
long as I can remember, we've been awfully slow
getting our rushing game strong," he said.
"Putting in the I didn't help that much at first,
but we didn't work on it as much at the start of the
season," Chris added.
The offensive line if fired up for the rushing
attack as well. "Whenever we break one, the line
is really up." says Inge. "That's something that's
been lacking in the past." Stevenson thanks the
lineaftereach big gainer. But he hasn't taken them
out to dinner like O.J. Simpson does. "If I was
making $175,000 a year I'd take them out."
