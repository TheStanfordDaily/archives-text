# 'Double' plays defense
## Larry Reynolds mirrors brother's achievements 
### RON BECK 
Oregon fans with discerning eyes might he
puzzled as they watch Stanford's right cornerback
— number 22. If they get a good look at him
without his helmet on, they might even think
they're just imagining things.
Stanford's Larry Reynolds, one of only two
freshmen starting for the Cardinals, looks nearly
identical to his older brother Don. a former
Oregon runningback star.
But while Don excelled at running away, from
people, Larry's forte is catching people. "Larry's
shown amazing progress." says Football Coach
Jack Christiansen. "We know that he can catch
just about anybody."
And there are at least 60,000 fans who wouldn't
argue with Christiansen about that, lust one play
after Mike Langford hit a first quarter field goal to
give the Cards a 3-0 first quarter lead in last week's
Stanford upset of USC, Ricky Bell, the nation's
leading rusher, bounced off Trojan quarterback
Vince Evans behind the line of scrimmage on a
miscue and improvised.
Sole pursuer
64 yards later. Bell was being pursued only by
Reynolds, who had cut across the field and was
lunging for Bell's legs. Reynolds lay flat on the
ground after his dive, while Bell stumbled for
ward another five yards to the Stanford four-yard
line where he fell to his knees. On the next play,
Evans fumbled the ball.
"1 wasn't really thinking that that was Ricky
Bell in front of me," the 5-11,180-pound native of
Corvallis said. "1 was acting on instinct, but there
was no way I was going to let him score without
my trying for him."
According to Reynolds, exciting moments like
that and his treatment as a Stanford football player
are making him enjoy football more. "I like it a lot
now." he said, "Before it used to be good, but
baseball was always my favorite."
Reynolds was ail-Oregon in both football and
baseball during his high school, and after being

selected in the eighth round of baseball's free
agent draft by the Minnesota Twins he had a
number of options to choose.
"We didn't Icnow what Larry would do," exp
lained Stanford Baseball Coach Ray Young. "He
ended up turning down a $25,000- plus bonus out
of high school. One scout said that if his team (had
the rights to Reynolds), they would've offered him
a lot more money to sign."
Numerous choices
Reynolds was an Oregon fan when his brother
starred there, lived across the street from Oregon
State, was recruited by a number of schools, and
also had a chance to start a pro baseball career. But
in the end he chose Stanford.
"Here I knew I could play baseball and football
and also get an education," he said. "The money
was tempting, but'coming out of high school it's
not so much.
"The Coaches (who recruited him) were really
honest about the place. I knew I couldn't do any
better."
Reynolds has a chance to star in both sports at
Stanford, according to each coach.
Good experience
"From everything we've heard, Larry's a fine
baseball prospect. Possibly the best recommenda
tion he's got going for him is that he played with
that Fairbanks, Alaska team during the summer,"
Young said, in reference to the summer league
that a number of Stanford players participate in
each year.
"I'm looking forward to him coming in and
having a good shot at a starting spot," he added.
Christiansen's sentiments were the same. "We
try to get the four best people in the defensive
backfield, and as Larry got better, we started shift
ing people around." he said.
"With his speed, athletic ability and quickness
we can start him right now. People thought he
wasn't big enough, but we think he is."
And if there's anyone who disagrees, they can
ask Rickv Bell
