# Struggling Ducks face the odds... ...and, odds are, they'll take another drubbing today
## 
### DAN PYNE 
The best way to write a pregame
story about the University of
Oregon, I've found, is to take ev
erything that can lie said about the
fighting Ducks, cut the comments
into pieces, put them in a large hat
and bake in an oven preheated to
450 degrees for twenty minutes.
The nasty comments (and there
could be a lot of them) tend to sink
to the bottom. Then, when you go
to write the story, see, you just
start pulling comments out of the
hat (be careful, it will still be hot)
and put them down on a sheet of
yellow copy paper:
★ Oregon is 2-7 in overall games,
1-4 in the conference with a
lone victory over Washington
State, and has been drubbed
62-7 by Oklahoma and 50-17 by
UCLA last weekend.
★ The Ducks possess the third
ranked passer in the Pacific
Eight, Jack Henderson, who is
sixth in total offense, and
among the top ten passers in
the country.
★ The Duck defense is the second

best in the conference, and is
responsible for holding San
lose State to five points and
USC to 17 points earlier this
★ season. The Duck passing de
fense has allowed only 08.2
yards in the air per game . . .
but then. UCLA only passed
once against them.
★ Unfortunately, the Oregon of
fense averages a meagre 11
points per game, which may
explain why it only scored in
double figures once in its first
seven games.
In essence, the most notable
comment that can be made about
Oregon is that they are the only
thing keeping USC in Rose Bowl
contention. Stanford will be com
ing into the game in top form after
its upset of vaunted USC last
weekend, led by a new starting
quarterback and presumablv
backed by not-quite-as-cynical
anymore fans.
Oh yes. but if the Cards manage
to bungle this one those funny lit
tle flowers are going to look quite
distant. Which is why Head Coach

lack Christiansen said, "There is
no way I can over-emphasize how
important (today's) game is to us.
If we want to have any chance to
represent the conference in the
Rose Bowl, we have to win this
game."

and bake in an oven preheated to
450 degrees for twenty minutes.
The nasty comments (and there
could be a lot of them) tend to sink
to the bottom. Then, when you go
to write the story, see, you just
start pulling comments out of the
hat (be careful, it will still be hot)
and put them down on a sheet of
yellow copy paper:
★ Oregon is 2-7 in overall games,
1-4 in the conference with a
lone victory over Washington
State, and has been drubbed
62-7 by Oklahoma and 50-17 by
UCLA last weekend.
★ The Ducks possess the third
ranked passer in the Pacific
Eight, Jack Henderson, who is
sixth in total offense, and
among the top ten passers in
the country.
★ The Duck defense is the second

best in the conference, and is
responsible for holding San
lose State to five points and
USC to 17 points earlier this
★ season. The Duck passing de
fense has allowed only 08.2
yards in the air per game . . .
but then. UCLA only passed
once against them.
★ Unfortunately, the Oregon of
fense averages a meagre 11
points per game, which may
explain why it only scored in
double figures once in its first
seven games.
In essence, the most notable
comment that can be made about
Oregon is that they are the only
thing keeping USC in Rose Bowl
contention. Stanford will be com
ing into the game in top form after
its upset of vaunted USC last
weekend, led by a new starting
quarterback and presumablv
backed by not-quite-as-cynical
anymore fans.
Oh yes. but if the Cards manage
to bungle this one those funny lit
tle flowers are going to look quite
distant. Which is why Head Coach

lack Christiansen said, "There is
no way I can over-emphasize how
important (today's) game is to us.
If we want to have any chance to
represent the conference in the
Rose Bowl, we have to win this
game."

The best way to write a pregame
story about the University of
Oregon, I've found, is to take ev
erything that can lie said about the
fighting Ducks, cut the comments
into pieces, put them in a large hat
and bake in an oven preheated to
450 degrees for twenty minutes.
