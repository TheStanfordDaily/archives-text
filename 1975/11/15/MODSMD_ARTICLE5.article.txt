# The
						center of attention
## Bill Reid makes a go at the pros 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
When Stanford alumnus Bill Reid reported to
the San Francisco 49ers' training camp in July, he
had only a slightly better chance of playing in the
National Football League than Ronald McDonald.
The prognosis on his football future was "termi
nal."
After all. what would any NFL team in its right
mind want with a center who's too short and too
slow by professional standards, who was neg
lected in the 1074 NFL draft and who was never
named so much as All-Pacific Eight Honorable
Mention at Stanford?
Yet, in a turn of events as miraculous as San
Francisco's upset of the Los Angeles Rams last
Sunday. the49ers traded away their regular center,
four-time All-Pro Forrest Blue, and named Reid to
start as the season opened in September. Reid has
started all season for San Francisco except for a few
games which he missed due to injury.
The unlikely story began with a stint in the
now-defunct World Football League after Reid
graduated from Stanford in 1973. The Long Beach

native played one year for the Southern California
Sun as center and guard, gained some professional
experience and then decided to give the NFL a try.
Asked for tryouts
Reid wrote letters to all 2fi NFL. teams asking for
a tryout. "The49ers replied first." he said. "Jack
White, who 1 guess is the vice president and gen
eral manager, was really interested and everything
worked out really well. Some other teams wrote
back and said, 'Sure, we'll contact you later' — that
sort of thing."
In making San Francisco's roster, the 6-foot-l,
240-pound rookie compensated for his deficien
cies with good blocking, intelligence and desire.
Reserved enthusiasm
Reid said he was "excited, but concerned" about
playing for49ers. "With it comes a lot of responsi
bility. I wanted to fulfill their (the4oers') expecta
tions of me."
Reid said the trading of Blue to the Baltimore
Colts "put a lot of pressure on me. 1 had to fill in
where he left off."
