# The 						center of attention
## Bill Reid makes a go at the pros 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
When Stanford alumnus Bill Reid reported to
the San Francisco 49ers' training camp in July, he
had only a slightly better chance of playing in the
National Football League than Ronald McDonald.
The prognosis on his football future was "termi
nal."
After all. what would any NFL team in its right
mind want with a center who's too short and too
slow by professional standards, who was neg
lected in the 1074 NFL draft and who was never
named so much as All-Pacific Eight Honorable
Mention at Stanford?
Yet, in a turn of events as miraculous as San
Francisco's upset of the Los Angeles Rams last
Sunday. the49ers traded away their regular center,
four-time All-Pro Forrest Blue, and named Reid to
start as the season opened in September. Reid has
started all season for San Francisco except for a few
games which he missed due to injury.
The unlikely story began with a stint in the
now-defunct World Football League after Reid
graduated from Stanford in 1973. The Long Beach

native played one year for the Southern California
Sun as center and guard, gained some professional
experience and then decided to give the NFL a try.
Asked for tryouts
Reid wrote letters to all 2fi NFL. teams asking for
a tryout. "The49ers replied first." he said. "Jack
White, who 1 guess is the vice president and gen
eral manager, was really interested and everything
worked out really well. Some other teams wrote
back and said, 'Sure, we'll contact you later' — that
sort of thing."
In making San Francisco's roster, the 6-foot-l,
240-pound rookie compensated for his deficien
cies with good blocking, intelligence and desire.
Reserved enthusiasm
Reid said he was "excited, but concerned" about
playing for49ers. "With it comes a lot of responsi
bility. I wanted to fulfill their (the4oers') expecta
tions of me."
Reid said the trading of Blue to the Baltimore
Colts "put a lot of pressure on me. 1 had to fill in
where he left off."
The 49er center exhibited no
feelings of pressure or responsi
bility as lie talked last week in the
49er locker room. In fact, his at
titude about where he finds him
self seems almost as bizarre as
how he got there.
Reid sits on a stool, leans back
against a rail and listens as he is
reminded that the odds on a free
agent (a player who is not drafted)
making the NFL are extremely
small.
He nods.
Reid is further reminded that
the odds on a free-agent starting in
the NFL can be detected only with
a high-powered lens.
"Yeah," he says, not particu
larly impressed at defeating the
percentages.
"1 just wanted to play football,"
Reid said. "I didn't think about
making the team or starting. I just
wanted to do my best and let
things work out from there."
Not pro material
Stanford's Jack Christiansen,
who coached Reid in college, exp
lained his ex-student's acent to
the NFL as capitalizing on an op
portunity. Christiansen said he

did not see pro potential in Reid at
Stanford because of his lack of size
and speed.
"The pros today are looking for
6-5 centers with speed to lead the
outside sweeps and who can make
the long snaps," Christiansen
said. "Reid's different from what
you'd really like in a center. He
doesn't really Tit the mold. Yet he
was a guy who was worth a tryout
and he made the best of it.
"He has good enough agility,
size and strength," Christiansen
added. "He did an outstanding job
in two years for us. He played so
well, that when I coached in the
Blue-Cray Classic (a post-season
all-star game in Montgomery,
Ala.) 1 took him along."
Although he said he was famil
iar with the Mike Cordova-Cuy
Benjamin controversy, Reid de
clined to offer an opinion on who
should start.
Watching the reporter continue
to frantically take down notes,
Reid asked, "What are you writing
— a hook?"
Not quite. If so, who'd even be
lieve Bill Reid's story is non
fiction?

Reid said the trading of Blue to the Baltimore
Colts "put a lot of pressure on me. 1 had to fill in
where he left off."
The 49er center exhibited no
feelings of pressure or responsi
bility as lie talked last week in the
49er locker room. In fact, his at
titude about where he finds him
self seems almost as bizarre as
how he got there.
Reid sits on a stool, leans back
against a rail and listens as he is
reminded that the odds on a free
agent (a player who is not drafted)
making the NFL are extremely
small.
He nods.
Reid is further reminded that
the odds on a free-agent starting in
the NFL can be detected only with
a high-powered lens.
"Yeah," he says, not particu
larly impressed at defeating the
percentages.
"1 just wanted to play football,"
Reid said. "I didn't think about
making the team or starting. I just
wanted to do my best and let
things work out from there."
Not pro material
Stanford's Jack Christiansen,
who coached Reid in college, exp
lained his ex-student's acent to
the NFL as capitalizing on an op
portunity. Christiansen said he

did not see pro potential in Reid at
Stanford because of his lack of size
and speed.
"The pros today are looking for
6-5 centers with speed to lead the
outside sweeps and who can make
the long snaps," Christiansen
said. "Reid's different from what
you'd really like in a center. He
doesn't really Tit the mold. Yet he
was a guy who was worth a tryout
and he made the best of it.
"He has good enough agility,
size and strength," Christiansen
added. "He did an outstanding job
in two years for us. He played so
well, that when I coached in the
Blue-Cray Classic (a post-season
all-star game in Montgomery,
Ala.) 1 took him along."
Although he said he was famil
iar with the Mike Cordova-Cuy
Benjamin controversy, Reid de
clined to offer an opinion on who
should start.
Watching the reporter continue
to frantically take down notes,
Reid asked, "What are you writing
— a hook?"
Not quite. If so, who'd even be
lieve Bill Reid's story is non
fiction?
When Stanford alumnus Bill Reid reported to
the San Francisco 49ers' training camp in July, he
had only a slightly better chance of playing in the
National Football League than Ronald McDonald.
The prognosis on his football future was "termi
nal."
After all. what would any NFL team in its right
mind want with a center who's too short and too
slow by professional standards, who was neg
lected in the 1074 NFL draft and who was never
named so much as All-Pacific Eight Honorable
Mention at Stanford?
Yet, in a turn of events as miraculous as San
Francisco's upset of the Los Angeles Rams last
Sunday. the49ers traded away their regular center,
four-time All-Pro Forrest Blue, and named Reid to
start as the season opened in September. Reid has
started all season for San Francisco except for a few
games which he missed due to injury.
The unlikely story began with a stint in the
now-defunct World Football League after Reid
graduated from Stanford in 1973. The Long Beach

native played one year for the Southern California
Sun as center and guard, gained some professional
experience and then decided to give the NFL a try.
Asked for tryouts
Reid wrote letters to all 2fi NFL. teams asking for
a tryout. "The49ers replied first." he said. "Jack
White, who 1 guess is the vice president and gen
eral manager, was really interested and everything
worked out really well. Some other teams wrote
back and said, 'Sure, we'll contact you later' — that
sort of thing."
In making San Francisco's roster, the 6-foot-l,
240-pound rookie compensated for his deficien
cies with good blocking, intelligence and desire.
