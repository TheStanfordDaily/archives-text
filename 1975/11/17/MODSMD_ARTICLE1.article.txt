# Imparting the Red C'
## 
### 
Big Game Week is upon us. Aside from an increase in ticket sales, the
other sure indicator is usually spread throughout the trees near the post
office. Or bubbling up in the fountain at White Plaza. Or spelled out in lye
on the field of Stanford Stadium.
Individuals are already beginning to promote the Big Game on their
rival's campus. The trees next to the post office were toilet-papered Friday
morning by Gal students (who, incidently, were apprehended by the Stan
ford police).
Stanford fans were forced to endure the sight of "Go Cal-Beat Stanford
| burned into the grass at the Stadium while watching the Stanford-Oregon
I contest. And, undoubtedly, somebody will fill up the campus bird baths
| with blue soap again this year.
£ It's a tradition.
| Five intrepid Stanford students exacted some small retribution on their
I Berkeley peers when they "hit" the hallowed "Big G" which looms out of
I the side of Tightwad Hill. It used to be gold. Now it is red. Cardinal red.
| Two gallons of paint and a six pack of Goors beer (which was used as
I thinner when the naint ran low) did the trick. It was the first time in four
I years that any Stanford students had made it to the top of the hill to paint
I the "C". Other attempts during that time had ended in failure (and threats
| on individual's lives by Gal's Axe Gornmittee).
| But if people thought previous years were bad — prank-wise, this week
I should top them all. Almost needless to say, in addition to battling for the
| rights to the revered "Axe" for another 12 months, something more imper
ii tant is at stake.
| The winner could go to the Rose Bowl.
