# Residence priority system is unfair
## 
### 
The Committee on Services to
Students' (COSS) Subcommittee
on Residence is currently in the
process of reevaluating the pres
ent residence priority system.
It's about time.
Although the present resi
dence priority system does not
affect a person's chances of
being assigned to campus hous
ing, it does markedly influence
one's opportunity to be assigned
to a popular living facility; any
inequity in obtaining such a
priority would therefore have to
be strongly supported.
The COSS Subcommittee is

beginning by examining the
priority as it applies to freshmen,
but any conclusion reached on
this particular issue is likely to
influence future consideration
of the priority system as it ap
plies to all undergraduates.
The disadvantage of present
residence priority is clear as
stated above: it promotes un
equal opportunity to live in
popular housing.
Continuity advantage
The principal advantageof the
current priority system is that it
enhances continuity of student
membership in each house from

one year to the next which might
aid programming.
The disadvantage as it applies
to freshmen is straightforward.
A frosh is placed (according to
his preference if possible) into
either an all-freshman or a four
class dormitory, which is either
single-sex or coed on each floor.
Come May and the spring
housing draw, those in all
freshman houses receive no
priority while others can remain
in their dorm the following year
simply by drawing on campus.
(With the guaranteed system,
therefore, a person living in
Lagunita freshman year could be
assured of two more successive
years there, probably in singles.)
The Burbank blahs
Because of the disparity in
"livableness" of four-class
houses as measured by their
popularity in the housing draw,
freshmen assigned to Burbank or
Trancos can be considered to be
treated unfairly compared to
those in Roble or Eucalypto
(Lagunita), even though all
would receive present residence
priority.
Though singles, which attract
students to Roble and Laguinta,
may not be best to fulfill the pur
pose of residential education,
they 1) do exist and 2) are popu
lar. And they should be distri
buted as equally as possible. It is
clear that present residence
priority inhibits the equality of
opportunity to attain popular
campus housing.

Greeks set example

But one must not overlook the
aforementioned advantage of the
priority system. Continuity pro
vides a certain amount of prog
ramming experience and can aid
in bringing the members of the
house together. Fraternities are
the best example of this.
But too much continuity can
lead to stagnation and difficul
ties in incorporating new mem
bers into the living group. It is
easier to stay among one's own
group of friends than make new
ones.
Under the first year of the

guaranteed housing plan, it ap
peared that a great deal mure
people than previously were
reassigned to their present resi
dence. In fact, as noted above,
this seems to be built into the
system so that when it takes full
effect there will be even more
continuity than at present.
Random selection
Furthermore, when a group of
students are randomly put to
gether, as in freshman dorms,
the Delt house two years ago and
Hurlburt House last year, the
people have found little trouble
in joining together to make a
solid living group. It can be done
without much continuity.
Unless it can be clearly de
monstrated that continuity pro
motes advantageous conditions
far better than minimal con
tinuity would, this argument
alone does not support the
awarding of present residence
priority.
While the system would still
not guarantee perfect equity be
cause of the chancy housing
draw, eliminating present resi
dence priority for freshmen and
upperclassmen is a necessary
step in this direction, perhaps
the only step that can realisti
cally be taken toward giving
everyone equable housing.
