# Senate impotent

Brad Krevoy
The workings of the ASSIJ Se
nate these past few weeks have
greatly disturbed me. Not only
has it stooped to the same level
of petty politics that has plagued
the senate in years past, but even
worse, it has failed to recognize
and correct its lack of power and
influence before the administra
tion.
Take, for example, the Bonfire
issue.
The Council of Presidents
(COP) and senators who op
posed the Bonfire did so on sym
bolic. rather than ecological
grounds. The COP stated that:
"The pollution caused by the fire
might not be much in compari
son to that of the Bay Area, but it
symbolizes a conscious refusal
by people at Stanford to recog
nize the more important con
cerns of the 'real' world."
In essence then, this argument
is not centered on environmen
tal effects, but rather on the wan
ton destruction of the event.
Yet, as the senate debate pro
ceeded, the very side that op
posed the Bonfire on symbolic
grounds, proposed as an alterna
tive a Bonfire reduced in size.
This alternative is the ultimate
in hypocrisy.
Instead of discussing agree
able alternatives, or even com
promising on the event itself, the
two factions divided. By a vote of
11-7 the Bonfire was doused.
The senate that theoretically
represents you and rne made a
decision. Although many might
not agree with the decision (in
cluding myself), the decision
nonetheless stands. By fiat,
every student voted against the
Bonfire.
Now however, despite the se
nate vote, the administration has
stated that the Bonfire will go on.
This raises my second concern
regarding student government.
What the hell good is student
government if our decisions
(whether they be good or bad,
and in this case bad) are disre
garded? Why then do we even
need a senate?
The lesson to be learned from
these past few weeks is two-fold.
First, as students we must get
our own house in order — mean
ing that pressure should be di
rected at our elected representa
tives to make them more respon
sible and aware of student sen
timent.
Second, and more important,
is the question of student power.
The student senate voted not to
have a Bonfire; yet the administ
ration has decided to have one
anyway.
If we are to have a meaningful
student government, then we
must be willing to swallow the
pill (howeversour it may be)and
accept the mandate of the senate,
and oppose the administration's
decision on moral grounds.
Our lifeline depends on it.

regarding student government.
What the hell good is student
government if our decisions
(whether they be good or bad,
and in this case bad) are disre
garded? Why then do we even
need a senate?
The lesson to be learned from
these past few weeks is two-fold.
First, as students we must get
our own house in order — mean
ing that pressure should be di
rected at our elected representa
tives to make them more respon
sible and aware of student sen
timent.
Second, and more important,
is the question of student power.
The student senate voted not to
have a Bonfire; yet the administ
ration has decided to have one
anyway.
If we are to have a meaningful
student government, then we
must be willing to swallow the
pill (howeversour it may be)and
accept the mandate of the senate,
and oppose the administration's
decision on moral grounds.
Our lifeline depends on it.

The workings of the ASSIJ Se
nate these past few weeks have
greatly disturbed me. Not only
has it stooped to the same level
of petty politics that has plagued
the senate in years past, but even
worse, it has failed to recognize
and correct its lack of power and
influence before the administra
tion.
Take, for example, the Bonfire
issue.
The Council of Presidents
(COP) and senators who op
posed the Bonfire did so on sym
bolic. rather than ecological
grounds. The COP stated that:
"The pollution caused by the fire
might not be much in compari
son to that of the Bay Area, but it
symbolizes a conscious refusal
by people at Stanford to recog
nize the more important con
cerns of the 'real' world."
In essence then, this argument
is not centered on environmen
tal effects, but rather on the wan
ton destruction of the event.
Yet, as the senate debate pro
ceeded, the very side that op
posed the Bonfire on symbolic
grounds, proposed as an alterna
tive a Bonfire reduced in size.
This alternative is the ultimate
in hypocrisy.
Instead of discussing agree
able alternatives, or even com
promising on the event itself, the
two factions divided. By a vote of
11-7 the Bonfire was doused.
The senate that theoretically
represents you and rne made a
decision. Although many might
not agree with the decision (in
cluding myself), the decision
nonetheless stands. By fiat,
every student voted against the
Bonfire.
Now however, despite the se
nate vote, the administration has
stated that the Bonfire will go on.
This raises my second concern
regarding student government.
What the hell good is student
government if our decisions

and in this case bad) are disre
garded? Why then do we even
