Message to Congress
Dec. 18, 1893
HONOLULU, (Pacific News
Service) One hundred years ago,
the people and land of Hawaii
were indissolubly linked
through a monarchy whose
offspring were called
Hawaiians.
In 1892, the U.S. Minister to
Hawaii successfully conspired
with a handful of non-Hawaiian
sugar growers to overthrow the
•Hawaiian monarchy and forci
bly separate the people from the
land.
Now, through an association
called ALOHA (Aboriginal
Lands of Hawaii), native
Hawaiians are asking Congress
to pay $1 billion in reparations
for Hawaiian lands taken by the
U.S. after it annexed Hawaii in
1898. Among other rights, they
are seeking control of 2.5 million
acres of land — now valued at
$76 billion — originally owned
by the Hawaiian monarchy.
"Since the arrival of Captain
Cook (in 1778),the natives have
steadily lost what was theirs to
enjoy," says ALOHA President
Arthur Kinney. "The native
Hawaiian is near extinction. His
blood is diffused among the
blood of other races. Hawaiians
have lost their land, their life and
their culture."
Founded in 1971, ALOHA has
been a spearhead of a growing
activist movement among native
Hawaiians on the issue of land
use. Facing the possibility of
total urbanization, native
Hawaiians are now trying to
reinstill a traditional respect for
their land.
A gift to share
In ancient Hawaii, the land
was like sunlight and water — a
gift from the gods for all men to
share. Land was to be used, not
owned.
Today, all but five percent of
Hawaii's land is in the hands of
either 72 large private landow
ners — who control nearly half
the land in the state — or of the
government. Twenty percent of
Hawaii's land is held by only
four private landowners.
Native Hawaiians, who
largely occupy the bottom rung
of the state's socio-economic
order, own little of the land and
must lease it from large property

holders.
The haoles (pronounced
"howlies" and meaning whites)
who gained control of the land
from the natives were the sons of
missionaries and traders who
came to the islands in the 19th
century. By most accounts, they
used deceit and economic man
ipulation to take control.
"Go to Boston"
Giving advice on how to ac
quire land in Hawaii, the
Honalulu Times remarked in
1850: "Go to Boston and be ap
pointed a missionary."
By 1898, three out of every
four acres were owned by haoles
and their businesses, and a plan
tation economy controlled by
haoles emerged to dominate the
island's social, economic and
political life.
In 1920, Congress established
the Hawaiian Homes Commis
sion (HHC), reserving 200,000
acres of land to lease to natives
Hawaiian blood at one dollar per
year rent.
But the Hawaii sugar industry,
highly organized politically,
saw to it that all sugar cane land
and land under previous homes
tead occupation was exempted
from the HHC program. Because
the sugar industry had already
acquired most of the good and
even marginally productive land
in Hawaii, the HHC land was
among the poorest on the islands
and much of it unfit for agricul
ture.
Vacant or leased
In the 55 years since, less than
25 percent of the promised
200,000 acres has been deli
vered. The remainder is either
vacant or leased lor private or
commercial use — some to polit
ically prominent non-natives.
As of this year, there are only
2283 native Hawaiians on the
land and 4600 on the waiting
list. Some have been waiting
more than 25 years.
Two key battles in the last five
years have symbolized the issue
of land use in Hawaii. The first,
in the Kalama Valley, is regarded
as the spark that ignited activist
land-use movements like
ALOHA.
Five years ago, the Kalama
Valley was an agricultural area
15 miles from Honolulu on the
southern coast of the island of
Oahu. Most residents made their
livings as small farmers. When
the owners of the valley, the
Bishop Estate, tried to clear out
the residents for land develop
ment, pig farmer George Santos
and five other valley residents
defied eviction notices for a year.

Eviction

When Santos refused to obey
his final eviction notice, 50 riot
equipped police offices in nine
squad cars evicted Santos and
arrested him and 32 supporters
for trespassing.

Today the Kalama Valley is a
high-priced residential neigh
borhood, joining other elite bed
room communities.
The Bishop Estate now con
trols 18 percent of all privately
owned land in Hawaii, holdings
valued at nearly $600 million.
The latest land use battle has
centered on the Waiahole and
Waikane valleys, on the north
ern coast of Oahu. The popula
tion, nearly half of whom are of
native blood, and some of whom
have had families living there
since the 1850s, are currently
fighting a housing development
that would transform the

valley's small farms into sub
divisions.
The Waiahold and Waikane
valley farmers have now gone to
court to fight eviction notices
served by the owners, the heirs
of the huge McCandless fortune.
But the farmers don't believe
they have much chance in court.
In similar confrontations, the
landowners and developers
have nearly always won.
Meanwhile, according to Sen.
Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, the re
parations bill now in Congress
backed by ALOHA is unrealistic
in its size and has practically no
chance of passing.
By an act of war, committed with
the participation of a diplomatic
representative of the United
States and without authority of
Congress, the Government of a
feeble hut friendly and confiding
people has "been overthrown. A
substantial wrong has thus been
done which a due regard for our

Message to Congress
Dec. 18, 1893
HONOLULU, (Pacific News
Service) One hundred years ago,
the people and land of Hawaii
were indissolubly linked
through a monarchy whose
offspring were called
Hawaiians.
In 1892, the U.S. Minister to
Hawaii successfully conspired
with a handful of non-Hawaiian
sugar growers to overthrow the
•Hawaiian monarchy and forci
bly separate the people from the
land.
Now, through an association
called ALOHA (Aboriginal
Lands of Hawaii), native
Hawaiians are asking Congress
to pay $1 billion in reparations
for Hawaiian lands taken by the
U.S. after it annexed Hawaii in
1898. Among other rights, they
are seeking control of 2.5 million
acres of land — now valued at
$76 billion — originally owned
by the Hawaiian monarchy.
"Since the arrival of Captain
Cook (in 1778),the natives have
steadily lost what was theirs to
enjoy," says ALOHA President
Arthur Kinney. "The native
Hawaiian is near extinction. His
blood is diffused among the
blood of other races. Hawaiians
have lost their land, their life and
their culture."
Founded in 1971, ALOHA has
been a spearhead of a growing
activist movement among native
Hawaiians on the issue of land
use. Facing the possibility of
total urbanization, native
Hawaiians are now trying to
reinstill a traditional respect for
their land.
A gift to share
In ancient Hawaii, the land
was like sunlight and water — a
gift from the gods for all men to
share. Land was to be used, not
owned.
Today, all but five percent of
Hawaii's land is in the hands of
either 72 large private landow
ners — who control nearly half
the land in the state — or of the
government. Twenty percent of
Hawaii's land is held by only
four private landowners.
Native Hawaiians, who
largely occupy the bottom rung
of the state's socio-economic
order, own little of the land and
must lease it from large property

holders.
The haoles (pronounced
"howlies" and meaning whites)
who gained control of the land
from the natives were the sons of
missionaries and traders who
came to the islands in the 19th
century. By most accounts, they
used deceit and economic man
ipulation to take control.
"Go to Boston"
Giving advice on how to ac
quire land in Hawaii, the
Honalulu Times remarked in
1850: "Go to Boston and be ap
pointed a missionary."
By 1898, three out of every
four acres were owned by haoles
and their businesses, and a plan
tation economy controlled by
haoles emerged to dominate the
island's social, economic and
political life.
In 1920, Congress established
the Hawaiian Homes Commis
sion (HHC), reserving 200,000
acres of land to lease to natives
Hawaiian blood at one dollar per
year rent.
But the Hawaii sugar industry,
highly organized politically,
saw to it that all sugar cane land
and land under previous homes
tead occupation was exempted
from the HHC program. Because
the sugar industry had already
acquired most of the good and
even marginally productive land
in Hawaii, the HHC land was
among the poorest on the islands
and much of it unfit for agricul
ture.
Vacant or leased
In the 55 years since, less than
25 percent of the promised
200,000 acres has been deli
vered. The remainder is either
vacant or leased lor private or
commercial use — some to polit
ically prominent non-natives.
As of this year, there are only
2283 native Hawaiians on the
land and 4600 on the waiting
list. Some have been waiting
more than 25 years.
Two key battles in the last five
years have symbolized the issue
of land use in Hawaii. The first,
in the Kalama Valley, is regarded
as the spark that ignited activist
land-use movements like
ALOHA.
Five years ago, the Kalama
Valley was an agricultural area
15 miles from Honolulu on the
southern coast of the island of
Oahu. Most residents made their
livings as small farmers. When
the owners of the valley, the
Bishop Estate, tried to clear out
the residents for land develop
ment, pig farmer George Santos
and five other valley residents
defied eviction notices for a year.

Eviction

When Santos refused to obey
his final eviction notice, 50 riot
equipped police offices in nine
squad cars evicted Santos and
arrested him and 32 supporters
for trespassing.

Today the Kalama Valley is a
high-priced residential neigh
borhood, joining other elite bed
room communities.
The Bishop Estate now con
trols 18 percent of all privately
owned land in Hawaii, holdings
valued at nearly $600 million.
The latest land use battle has
centered on the Waiahole and
Waikane valleys, on the north
ern coast of Oahu. The popula
tion, nearly half of whom are of
native blood, and some of whom
have had families living there
since the 1850s, are currently
fighting a housing development
that would transform the

valley's small farms into sub
divisions.
The Waiahold and Waikane
valley farmers have now gone to
court to fight eviction notices
served by the owners, the heirs
of the huge McCandless fortune.
But the farmers don't believe
they have much chance in court.
In similar confrontations, the
landowners and developers
have nearly always won.
Meanwhile, according to Sen.
Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, the re
parations bill now in Congress
backed by ALOHA is unrealistic
in its size and has practically no
chance of passing.
By an act of war, committed with
the participation of a diplomatic
representative of the United
States and without authority of
Congress, the Government of a
feeble hut friendly and confiding
people has "been overthrown. A

Message to Congress
Dec. 18, 1893
HONOLULU, (Pacific News
Service) One hundred years ago,
the people and land of Hawaii
were indissolubly linked
through a monarchy whose
offspring were called
Hawaiians.
In 1892, the U.S. Minister to
Hawaii successfully conspired
with a handful of non-Hawaiian
sugar growers to overthrow the
•Hawaiian monarchy and forci
bly separate the people from the
land.
Now, through an association
called ALOHA (Aboriginal
Lands of Hawaii), native
Hawaiians are asking Congress
to pay $1 billion in reparations
for Hawaiian lands taken by the
U.S. after it annexed Hawaii in
1898. Among other rights, they
are seeking control of 2.5 million
acres of land — now valued at
$76 billion — originally owned
by the Hawaiian monarchy.
"Since the arrival of Captain
Cook (in 1778),the natives have
steadily lost what was theirs to
enjoy," says ALOHA President
Arthur Kinney. "The native
Hawaiian is near extinction. His
blood is diffused among the
blood of other races. Hawaiians
have lost their land, their life and
their culture."
Founded in 1971, ALOHA has
been a spearhead of a growing
activist movement among native
Hawaiians on the issue of land
use. Facing the possibility of
total urbanization, native
Hawaiians are now trying to
reinstill a traditional respect for
their land.
A gift to share
In ancient Hawaii, the land
was like sunlight and water — a
gift from the gods for all men to
share. Land was to be used, not
owned.
Today, all but five percent of
Hawaii's land is in the hands of
either 72 large private landow
ners — who control nearly half
the land in the state — or of the
government. Twenty percent of
Hawaii's land is held by only
four private landowners.
Native Hawaiians, who
largely occupy the bottom rung
of the state's socio-economic
order, own little of the land and
must lease it from large property

holders.
The haoles (pronounced
"howlies" and meaning whites)
who gained control of the land
from the natives were the sons of
missionaries and traders who
came to the islands in the 19th
century. By most accounts, they
used deceit and economic man
ipulation to take control.
"Go to Boston"
Giving advice on how to ac
quire land in Hawaii, the
Honalulu Times remarked in
1850: "Go to Boston and be ap
pointed a missionary."
By 1898, three out of every
four acres were owned by haoles
and their businesses, and a plan
tation economy controlled by
haoles emerged to dominate the
island's social, economic and
political life.
In 1920, Congress established
the Hawaiian Homes Commis
sion (HHC), reserving 200,000
acres of land to lease to natives
Hawaiian blood at one dollar per
year rent.
But the Hawaii sugar industry,
highly organized politically,
saw to it that all sugar cane land
and land under previous homes
tead occupation was exempted
from the HHC program. Because
the sugar industry had already
acquired most of the good and
even marginally productive land
in Hawaii, the HHC land was
among the poorest on the islands
and much of it unfit for agricul
ture.
Vacant or leased
In the 55 years since, less than
25 percent of the promised
200,000 acres has been deli
vered. The remainder is either
vacant or leased lor private or
commercial use — some to polit
ically prominent non-natives.
As of this year, there are only
2283 native Hawaiians on the
land and 4600 on the waiting
list. Some have been waiting
more than 25 years.
Two key battles in the last five
years have symbolized the issue
of land use in Hawaii. The first,
in the Kalama Valley, is regarded
as the spark that ignited activist
land-use movements like
ALOHA.
Five years ago, the Kalama
Valley was an agricultural area
15 miles from Honolulu on the
southern coast of the island of
Oahu. Most residents made their
livings as small farmers. When
the owners of the valley, the
Bishop Estate, tried to clear out
the residents for land develop
ment, pig farmer George Santos
and five other valley residents
defied eviction notices for a year.

Eviction

When Santos refused to obey
his final eviction notice, 50 riot
equipped police offices in nine
squad cars evicted Santos and
arrested him and 32 supporters
for trespassing.

Today the Kalama Valley is a
high-priced residential neigh
borhood, joining other elite bed
room communities.
The Bishop Estate now con
trols 18 percent of all privately
owned land in Hawaii, holdings
valued at nearly $600 million.
The latest land use battle has
centered on the Waiahole and
Waikane valleys, on the north
ern coast of Oahu. The popula
tion, nearly half of whom are of
native blood, and some of whom
have had families living there
since the 1850s, are currently
fighting a housing development
that would transform the

valley's small farms into sub
divisions.
The Waiahold and Waikane
valley farmers have now gone to
court to fight eviction notices
served by the owners, the heirs
of the huge McCandless fortune.
But the farmers don't believe
they have much chance in court.
In similar confrontations, the
landowners and developers
have nearly always won.
Meanwhile, according to Sen.
Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, the re
parations bill now in Congress
backed by ALOHA is unrealistic
in its size and has practically no
chance of passing.
By an act of war, committed with
the participation of a diplomatic
representative of the United
States and without authority of
Congress, the Government of a
feeble hut friendly and confiding
people has "been overthrown. A
