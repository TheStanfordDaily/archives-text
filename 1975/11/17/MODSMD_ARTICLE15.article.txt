### MARK NASSUTTI 
Portugal must not become another Chile,
26-year-old Joan Ferreria de Sousa, a Portuguese
revolutionary and member of the country's Left
Socialist Movement (LSM), told a Stanford
audience.
Before an overflow crowd in the Meyer Library
Forum room last week, Ferreira viewed the pres
ent situation in Portugal and expressed concern
over several major problems confronting the
country's revolutionary movement.
Termed "farther left than communism" in
Ferreira's introduction, the LSM has as its major
purpose the arming and organization of the peo
ple to overthrow the presently ineffective sixth
government, he said.
The major problems facing the LSM are the
threats of all-out civil war and foreign interven
tion in the country's affairs, Ferreira claimed.
The LSM is composed of revolutionary
Catholics and young union members, according
to P'erreria. As of now it is a minority group, he
admitted, but he said it is very influential in the
Army, which is the key to control of the country.
The slogan of the LSM is "popular power," he

said.
One member of the audience, a recent visitor to
Portugal, commented that "the man on the street
does not know what to believe. Everything he
hears is contradicted the next minute by some
thing else. Everybody is running around trying to
hurt each other. Thq people seemed to know that a
new Chile was on the way.
The issue hinges around the fact that "there is
an organized right and an unorganized left. The
right has financial support while the left does
not," he said. He added that an economic crisis
was going to bring the issue to a head. He de
scribed the present situation as "total chaos."
Ferreira commented that out of the six govern
ments since the revolution began, none could ac
complish its goals.
"Yesterday, the prime minister of the sixth gov
ernment was beseiged by 20,000 laborers de
manding higher wages. The government bombed
the army-held radio stations with paratroopers,
but when the paratroopers landed, they met with
the soldiers and the people there and decided to
join them. They arrested their officers and threw
them out" just as the ATmy had done before them.
"They refused to support the government."

The issue hinges around the fact that "there is
an organized right and an unorganized left. The
right has financial support while the left does
not," he said. He added that an economic crisis
was going to bring the issue to a head. He de
scribed the present situation as "total chaos."
Ferreira commented that out of the six govern
ments since the revolution began, none could ac
complish its goals.
"Yesterday, the prime minister of the sixth gov
ernment was beseiged by 20,000 laborers de
manding higher wages. The government bombed
the army-held radio stations with paratroopers,
but when the paratroopers landed, they met with
the soldiers and the people there and decided to
join them. They arrested their officers and threw
them out" just as the ATmy had done before them.
"They refused to support the government."
