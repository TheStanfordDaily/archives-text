## Yes, Virginia, they're coming Tie-break rule puts scotchers in nationals 
### JOHN ROOS 
"When you want something as badly as we
wanted to go to Virginia, there's no way you're
going to be stopped."
Betsy Morris, captain of the victorious Stanford
field hockey team, said it all after her scotchers
defeated San Diego State Saturday to clinch the
number two ranking in the West Coast Conference
and a berth in the Collegiate Field Hockey Nation
als.
San Jose State, which defeated the Cards Friday,
captured the top spot in the Regionals played at
Roble Field with a 3-0 record. Stanford finished
with two wins and one loss.
Although the Cards were clearly one of the
more skilled teams in the competition, Stanford's
"nervousness and inexperience showed through
out the whole tournament," according to Assis
tant Coach Carla Soracco.
But the Cards "were able to hang in there,"
Soracco added, and "along with a little luck"
were able to come up with the crucial two wins
needed to send them on their way to Harrison
burg, Virginia over Thanksgiving weekend.
Stanford easily defeated its first opponent, Col
den West Junior College, by a 4-0 score.
Then, in front of 350 fans Friday afternoon,
Stanford faced its toughest conference foe, San
Jose St. In a regular season match last month, the
two teams tied 1-1. This match also ended in a 1-1
tie, but the Spartans were declared the winners on
the basis of "penetration time," a method that
determines which team has had more offensive
control.
San Jose controlled the ball throughout the first
half, even though Stanford's Kathy Levinson
scored the only goal in the first 30 minutes of play.

In a rough second half which resulted in two
Spartan injuries, the pressure got to the young
Stanford team.
After San Jose's Annette Espinosa tied the score
midway through the half, the scotchers "mentally
panicked and completely stopped thinking."
analyzed Coach Shirley Schoof.
"We didn't work together at all after that," said
Morris. "We all wanted the game so much that
everyone tried to win it themselves."
The scotchers were mentally prepared for San
Diego State on Saturday. "We had to win it be
cause I wanted to go home for Thanksgiving,"
defensive player Janie Soyster, a native of Vir
ginia, commented.
Twelve minutes after the start of the game,
Mandy Read scored Stanford's first and only goal.
But only one minute into the second half, Robin
Ramsey pushed one past goalie Morris for San
Diego State and the Stanford fans feared that the
previous day's close loss to San Jose State would
be repeated.
The scotchers first-half offensive control gave
them a penetration time that exceeded that of San
Diego State by only one minute and fifteen sec
onds.
The victory left Stanford with the most success
ful field hockey team in its history. One spectator
at the Regionals, Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don, said he "fully expects them to come home
with the championship." But Soracco played it
safer, "I would rather not make any predictions at
this time."
The scotcher's successful season has led to
speculation about a more intensive recruiting
program. But, as Hargadon commented, "Why re
cruit when they come naturally like this?"

Betsy Morris, captain of the victorious Stanford
field hockey team, said it all after her scotchers
defeated San Diego State Saturday to clinch the
number two ranking in the West Coast Conference
and a berth in the Collegiate Field Hockey Nation
als.
San Jose State, which defeated the Cards Friday,
captured the top spot in the Regionals played at
Roble Field with a 3-0 record. Stanford finished
with two wins and one loss.
Although the Cards were clearly one of the
more skilled teams in the competition, Stanford's
"nervousness and inexperience showed through
out the whole tournament," according to Assis
tant Coach Carla Soracco.
But the Cards "were able to hang in there,"
Soracco added, and "along with a little luck"
were able to come up with the crucial two wins
needed to send them on their way to Harrison
burg, Virginia over Thanksgiving weekend.
Stanford easily defeated its first opponent, Col
den West Junior College, by a 4-0 score.
Then, in front of 350 fans Friday afternoon,
Stanford faced its toughest conference foe, San
Jose St. In a regular season match last month, the
two teams tied 1-1. This match also ended in a 1-1
tie, but the Spartans were declared the winners on
the basis of "penetration time," a method that
determines which team has had more offensive
control.
San Jose controlled the ball throughout the first
half, even though Stanford's Kathy Levinson
scored the only goal in the first 30 minutes of play.

In a rough second half which resulted in two
Spartan injuries, the pressure got to the young
Stanford team.
After San Jose's Annette Espinosa tied the score
midway through the half, the scotchers "mentally
panicked and completely stopped thinking."
analyzed Coach Shirley Schoof.
"We didn't work together at all after that," said
Morris. "We all wanted the game so much that
everyone tried to win it themselves."
The scotchers were mentally prepared for San
Diego State on Saturday. "We had to win it be
cause I wanted to go home for Thanksgiving,"
defensive player Janie Soyster, a native of Vir
ginia, commented.
Twelve minutes after the start of the game,
Mandy Read scored Stanford's first and only goal.
But only one minute into the second half, Robin
Ramsey pushed one past goalie Morris for San
Diego State and the Stanford fans feared that the
previous day's close loss to San Jose State would
be repeated.
The scotchers first-half offensive control gave
them a penetration time that exceeded that of San
Diego State by only one minute and fifteen sec
onds.
The victory left Stanford with the most success
ful field hockey team in its history. One spectator
at the Regionals, Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don, said he "fully expects them to come home
with the championship." But Soracco played it
safer, "I would rather not make any predictions at
this time."
The scotcher's successful season has led to
speculation about a more intensive recruiting
program. But, as Hargadon commented, "Why re
cruit when they come naturally like this?"
