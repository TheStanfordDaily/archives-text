# Cards survive dismal half, remain in Rose Bowl race
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
If some of the Stanford Cardinals were
trying to embarass the people who had writ
ten and said good things about them all
week, they certainly succeeded on Satur
day.
The Cards did manage to beat Oregon,
33-30, but both teams played so erratically
that it was'difficult to tell the Pacific Eight
weakling from the Rose Bowl contender.
And the big stars of last week's Card upset of
USC looked mortal again — at best.
—Mike Langford, last week's concensus
hero, missed the only field goal he tried, a
51-yarder, by about 15 yards.
—AF Lineman of the Week Duncan
McColl must have figured he had enough
press clippings: he was in on just two tack
les all game, and never came close to sack
ing Oregon's Jack Henderson.
—After a brilliant beginning, quarterback
Cuy Benjamin gave the fans that had pro
vided three standing ovations a rest. He
threw three interceptions in thesecond half,
almost enough to give the Ducks a win in
Benjamin's first start this season.
—Savann Thompson, the Cards, fresh
man cornerback who had grabbed the key
interception against USC, was burned a
number of times in single-coverage situa
tions, including back-to-back bombs of 41
and 44 yards.
—And the entire Card defense, which
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen lauded
after the USC win, took a giant step back
wards, looking almost as disorganized as it
had in the Cards' 36-34 loss to San Jose State
Sept. 27.

In short, it was a typical Cardinal perfor
mance against a "Northwest Nothing"
team. "We're just thankful to get out of there
alive," said Christiansen, after his team had
found a way to make a rout into a nervte
wracking squeaker for the third time this
season.
After halftime it looked as if the Stanford
Band's abduction of the Oregon baton
twirler (and the Duck bandsmen's subse
quent retaliation) would provide the last
real attraction for fans who weren't in
terested in seeing another dull Army-fctyle
massacre.
Benjamin had completed six of eight pas
ses, and even when he threw into the mid
dle of the Oregon defense — as on a 41-yard
play to Tony Hill — the Cards still came up
with the ball. The only Webfoot score was a
field goal after punter Tom Lynn's knee
touched the ground on the Stanford nine.
Fumbling flatfeet
The Ducks had helped out by fumbling
the first two Card punts, and losing both to
Stanford's Alex Karakozoff. Ray Anderson's
65-yard punt return spring, two perfect Ben
jamin passes and a one-yard keeper gave the
Cards a 26-3 halftime lead.
"I don't know what I told my team at
halftime," said Oregon coach Don Read. "I
don't think it was anything special, but
right now I wish I could remember it."
Whatever it was, it didn't work im
mediately.TheCards immediately increased
their lead to 33-3, and then the Ducks got
going.
Webfoot Greg Bauer, whose eight recep
tions helped drop Stanford's Hill from first

to third place in the Fac-8 receiving stand
ings, caught a 65-yard pass to set up one
Duck touchdown, and Benjamin's first in
terception helped the Ducks get another.
Savann works out
Oregon kept working on the Cardinal
pass defense, especially on freshman
Thompson, who was beaten long and short
during all four Duck touchdown drives.
With over nine minutes to go in the final
period, quarterback Jack Henderson had
brought the Ducks to within three points of
Stanford.
"We weren't just picking on Thompson,"
said Henderson. "We were throwing to
whoever was open. I think Stanford might
have been feeling a little too comfortable
with that lead at halftime."
The Ducks, shut off by Stanford's double
coverage with five minutes to go in the half,
gave up the football for the last time. Benja
min, helped by the Cards' best running of
the day from Donny Stevenson, John Finley
and Sig Ostrom, led Stanford on a long drive
that used up the rest of the game.
"This game will stick in my mind," said a
somewhat demoralized Benjamin, "until
we see the game films and make correc
tions."
That may not seem like a long time, but
it's probably longer than most Card fans will
bother with it. After all, a win against a
"Northwest Nothing," however close, is
still something Stanford takes for granted.
At least the fans who bought up all the re
maining Big Came tickets but stayed home
on Saturday seemed to — and so, at times,
did the football team.
