# Card poloists win twice, lose to Irvine
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team, which ran up a 16-game
winning streak before having it
snapped by UCLA a week ago,
won two of three games this
weekend in what resembled a
waterpolo marathon. The Cards,
4-1 in the Pac-8 and 21-3 overall,
played the three gomes in Â«i
22-hour time period.
"I would never do it again,"
said coach Art Lambert. "Last
year at this time we needed the
game experience, but this year
we didn't and I could not change
the schedule."
In the tripleheader, a Stanford
squad, without offensive threat
Rick fohannsen due to illness,
beat UC-Santa Barbara and Cal
State Long Beach on Friday.
They lost, however, to UC
lrvine, which Lambert termed
one of the three best teams in
California. 11-5, the next day.
"The guys were upset that
they lost to Irvine especially
since we had beaten them al
ready this season, but they were
completely wiped out after the
two games the day before,"
Lambert said.
This was illustrated early in
the Irvine game as the Cards fell
behind 3-0 at the end of the first
quarter. The only offensive
thrust Stanford could muster
during the contest was three
goals in thefourth period, twoby
Marty Davis and one by Tom
Angelo, but that was only
enough to neutralize Irvine's
fourth period scoring output.
The Cards, however, just
could not continue the offensive
scoring they showed the previ
ous day in wins overllC-Santa
Barbara, 12-7,and Cal State Long
Beach, 7-5.
Stanford made it 2-0 against
Santa Barbara this season as
Doug Burke's three third-quarter
goals paced a ten-goal second
half blitz after Stanford found it
self behind 3-1 at halftime.
Only a few hours later the
Cards traveled to Long Beach to
meet Tim Shaw and company.
Against Cal State Long Beach,
the Cards jumped out fast and
mounted a 3-1 first quarter score
behind two Tom Elson goals.
Chris Dorst preserved the lead
with three blocked shots.
Exactly what position are the
Cards in, you ask? Well, this
weekend California's Golden
Bears, at full strength with their
two top scorers back from the
Pan-American games, defeated
UCLA, 8-7. The Bruins were
previously in a tie for first place
in the Pac-8 with Stanford.
Therefore, the Cards are pres
ently all alone atop the Pac-8
with California and UCLA one
game behind. The Cards' last
league game pits them against
California on. appropriately, Big
Game day. Stanford defeated the
Bears earlier in the league season
up at Berkeley, 12-8. and 10-7 in
the finals of the Northern
California Aquatics Invitational
tournament.
