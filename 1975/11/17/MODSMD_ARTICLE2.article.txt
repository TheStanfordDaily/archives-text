# Microfilm, students suffer
## Heating troubles UGLY 
### STEVE SCHILLER 
Meyer Undergraduate Library
(UGLY) has "definite heating prob
lems." including extremes of hot and
cold, according to Librarian Elizabeth
Salzar.
The heat on several occasions has
reached 80 degrees in many parts ot
the building, and the Audio Library is
often warmer. However, "my greatest
concern is in the basement area" be
cause of possible damage to microfilm
in storage, Salzar said.
On several occasions, library offi
cials have opened the fourth floor ter
race doors to cool down the building.
John C. Heyeck, finance and plan
ning officer for University libraries,
first became aware of the temperature
problem through the response to an
undergraduate student survey mailed
out last year.
Meyer like a vault
"Meyer is built like a vault," Heyeck
said, pointing to the lack of opening
windows in the building. The problem

is "how we can make the facility more
comfortable." UGLY also has noise
problems which are being studied, ac
cording to Heyeck.
UGLY's heating controls were
checked last Thursday by Robert
McKnight, Plant Services manager of
utilities and a controls consultant
hired by the University.
Although they "could find nothing
radically wrong," they found one
thermostat set for 75 degrees, which is
higher than the University policy of 68
degrees, according to McKnight.
McKnight has decided to change the
schedule of heating for UGLY. The
present schedule, controlled by Plant
Services' energy-monitoring IBM Sys
tem Seven computer, calls for a large
delivery of heat once per day. in
the morning.
Two deliveries
McKnight will study the possibility
of delivering the heat in smaller quan
tity twice daily, in the morning and
again in the late afternoon. Other than

this action, no other possible solutions
are under consideration at this time,
according to McKnight.
During the summer, Plant Services
worked to repair the heating systems
of many of the University's other lib
raries, including Main Library.
Plant Services replaced many of the
original steam traps on the radiators
and cleaned the system in Main Lib
rary, which was plagued by extremes
of hot and cold. As a result, the prob
lems there have been corrected, ac
cording to Heyeck.

hired by the University.
Although they "could find nothing
radically wrong," they found one
thermostat set for 75 degrees, which is
higher than the University policy of 68
degrees, according to McKnight.
McKnight has decided to change the
schedule of heating for UGLY. The
present schedule, controlled by Plant
Services' energy-monitoring IBM Sys
tem Seven computer, calls for a large
delivery of heat once per day. in
the morning.
Two deliveries
McKnight will study the possibility
of delivering the heat in smaller quan
tity twice daily, in the morning and
again in the late afternoon. Other than

this action, no other possible solutions
are under consideration at this time,
according to McKnight.
During the summer, Plant Services
worked to repair the heating systems
of many of the University's other lib
raries, including Main Library.
Plant Services replaced many of the
original steam traps on the radiators
and cleaned the system in Main Lib
rary, which was plagued by extremes
of hot and cold. As a result, the prob
lems there have been corrected, ac
cording to Heyeck.

ter underline problems of overheating in Meyer Under- graduate Library. Minor adjustments are planned.
Meyer Undergraduate Library
(UGLY) has "definite heating prob
lems." including extremes of hot and
cold, according to Librarian Elizabeth
Salzar.
The heat on several occasions has
reached 80 degrees in many parts ot
the building, and the Audio Library is
often warmer. However, "my greatest
concern is in the basement area" be
cause of possible damage to microfilm
in storage, Salzar said.
On several occasions, library offi
cials have opened the fourth floor ter
race doors to cool down the building.
John C. Heyeck, finance and plan
ning officer for University libraries,
first became aware of the temperature
problem through the response to an
undergraduate student survey mailed
out last year.
Meyer like a vault
"Meyer is built like a vault," Heyeck
said, pointing to the lack of opening
windows in the building. The problem

is "how we can make the facility more
comfortable." UGLY also has noise
problems which are being studied, ac
cording to Heyeck.
UGLY's heating controls were
checked last Thursday by Robert
McKnight, Plant Services manager of
utilities and a controls consultant
hired by the University.
