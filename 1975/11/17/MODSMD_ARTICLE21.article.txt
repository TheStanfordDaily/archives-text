# Pac-8 roundup
## USC accepts bowl bid 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Liberty Bowl officials surpris
ingly announced yesterday that
USC, a team which has lost three
conference games, has been in
vited to play in the Memphis
classic. The Trojans have ac
cepted the offer.
After USC's 8-7 loss to
Washington Saturday, the feel
ing among some players was that
the Trojans didn't deserve a
bowl bid.
"A bowl?" asked Trojan tail
back Kicky Bell. "The way we
played, I don't know. UCLA is
the best team in the Pac-8 right
now. If we continue to beat our
selves, I don't think it would be a
good idea to go to a bowl."
Bell got his yards against the
Huskies — 190 on 40 carries, br
inging his nation-leading total to
1739 and eclipsing O.J.
Simpson's Pac-8 season record
•by 30 yards.
Lost lead
USC went into the fourth quar
ter with a 7-0 lead but gave up a
safety on a high snap from center
and a 49-yard Dog touchdown
drive. The Trojans still had two
chances to win it. Glenn Walker
came on to kick a 26-yard field
goal, but Washington blocked it.
Then SC quarterback Mike San
ford fumbled away the snap at

the Washington 26 in the final
minute.
Who said USC will beat UCLA
because Bruin quarterback John
Sciarra can't pass? The Trojans
may still win the Nov. 28 show
down, but Sciarra proved that he
can throw in whipping Oregon
State 31-9.
Sciarra completed 10 of 16
passes for 247 yards and one
touchdown — a 46-yard play to
tight end Ricky Walker.
UCLA needs only to beat the Tro
jans in their cross town matchup
to gain its first Rose Bowl invita
tion since 1966.
Bears to bowl?
California made itself even
more attractive to the bowl peo
ple with a 31-14 romp over Air
Force Saturday. Golden Bear
quarterback Joe Roth threw four
touchdown passes, including a
63-yarder to Wesley Walker.
Chuck Muncie had a game-high
144 yards rushing.

Cal comes into the Big Game
as the nation's leading total
offenseteam. Roth threw for 303
yards against the Falcons.
Up in frigid Fullman, Wash.
Jim Sweeney's Washington State
Cougars snapped a seven-game
losing streak, trouncing Idaho
84-27. Six players scored twice
for the Cougars and kicker
Chuck Diedrick booted a record
12 extra points.
