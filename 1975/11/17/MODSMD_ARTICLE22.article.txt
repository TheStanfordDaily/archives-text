### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Paced by their Kenyan trium
virate, the Washington State
Cougars claimed their fourth
Pacific Eight cross country
crown in five years Saturday at
the Stanford Golf Course. By
polishing off defending NCAA
champion Oregon, the Cougars
served warning that they will be
gunning for the NCAA title next
Monday at Penn State.
Sophomore Joshua Kimento
led VVSU Saturday by copping
the individual title, collapsing at
the finish line with a time of
27:48.6. Kimento's Kenyan
teammates, John Ngeno and
Sampson Kimoinbwa, finished
second and fourth respectively.
Kurt Beckman and Phil English,
the only other Cougar finishers,
both placed among the top 10
finishers.
Stanford's hopes of qualifying
for this year's NCAA meet were
dashed when the Cards finished
fifth with a score of 130. The top
Stanford finisher was Jack Bel
lah. who placed 19th. School
record-holder Tony Sandoval
was hampered by severe
stomach cramps and finished a
disappointing 22nd.
Only one of the Cardinal's
seven runners, freshman Jerry
Emory, was able to improve
upon his time from the Stanford
Invitational run here four weeks
ago. Emory posted a time of
29:53 to finish 24th. Roughly
1200 spectators turned out for
the race.
