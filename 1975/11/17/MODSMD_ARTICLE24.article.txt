Carter defeats Wallace
ORLANDO, Fla. — Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy
Carter easily won a straw presidential poll of dele
gates at the Democratic state convention yesterday,
knocking Alabama Gov. George Wallace to a sur
prising third place.
Carter, a 51-year-old peanut farmer from Plains,
Ga., has been campaigning hard in Florida, making
thepopularty contest a two-way tug of war between
himself and Wallace.
Charter called his victory "a good omen for the
Florida primary" and predicted he would win the
March 9 contest. "It's the result of hard work during
the last eight months," he said through his press
aide.
Carter polled 697 votes, or 67 percent of the 1035
ballots cast by delegates to the first Florida Democ
ratic convention since the turn of the century.
Wallace claimed only 57 votes, or 6 percent, a
sharp contrast to his 1972 presidential primary
showing when he captured 42 percent of Florida's
vote.
Franco's condition grave
MADRID. Spain — Generalissimo Francisco
Franco remained in very grave condition yesterday
as Spanish newspapers debated whether it was
humane to continue keeping him alve by artificial
means.
A midday medical bulletin indicated the
82-year-old Franco could survive for hours,
perhaps days.
His life was dependent on coagulants, a kidney
machine, an artificial respirator and the combined
efforts of 26 physicians.
Press commentators questioned the humanity of
keeping the general alive since power has already
been vested temorarily in his chosen successor.
Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon, whose future as
Spain's king is assured constitutionally.
Israel objects to conference
JERUSALEM — Israel has told the United States
it objects to attending the Geneva Mideast peace
conference if the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) is invited to take part, it was announced
yesterday.
Israel also insists that Syria renew the mandate of
the U.N. buffer force on the Golan Heights before
the peace conference is called into session, said a
communique following an Israeli cabinet meeting.
The communique said Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin informed the cabinet of this position after the
Soviet Union asked Washington to reconvene the
conference with the participation of the PLO.
The Israeli statement stopped short of an outright
refusal to attend the conference if the PLO is in
vited. Israeli officials say privately that the Palesti
nians could attend as members of the Jordanian
delegation. Some observers here see a possibility of

compromise if the guerrilla movement recognizes
Israel and renounces the use of force.
Home rule for Scotland, Wales
LONDON — Britain's Labor party government is
putting final touches on plans to reverse 288 years
of history and hand back partial self-government to
the 5.2 million people of Scotland.
It also plans an elected assembly for the 2.7 mill
ion people of Wales.
Some of Britain's 635 law-makers in the House of
Commons in London are asking if all this is thestart
of the breakup of Britain, even though Prime Minis
ter Harold Wilson has assured them, "There is no
question of any proposals for the breakup of the
United Kingdom."
The man in charge of Parliament's team on de
volution. as the subject has come to be known, is
Edward Short, leader of the House of Commons,
who says it will be "the most important constitu
tional document of this century."
Devolution means the surrender of authority
from a central government to a regional authority.
Under pressure from Scottish and Welsh
nationalist parties calling for more independence,
the Laborites promised that their government "will
create elected assemblies for Scotland and Wales."
New York: "De facto default"
ALBANY, N.Y. — The moratorium on payment
of New York City notes passed by the state legisla
ture has been called a de facto default by observers
in the financial community.
A moratorium that will affect only individuals
and not banks was approved Friday at a special
session of the New York Legislature. It is the only
section of the $6.6 billion rescue plan Gov. Hugh
Carey has proposed that has yet been taken up by
the lawmakers.
The moratorium is considered a key in obtaining
some kind of federal intervention in the financial
crisis, particularly since President Ford has said
there would be no federal aid prior to a default.
The measure allows the city to refuse to redeem at
face value the $1.6 billion in short-term debt due
between now and next June — giving noteholders
the choice of taking new notes or waiting three
years to be paid for the present notes.
Rosenberg papers published
NEW YORK — The late P'BI Director J. Edgar
Hoover and other top law enforcement officials re
commended mercy for convicted spy Ethel Rosen
berg prior to her execution, government documents
reveal.
The documents showed that Hoover,

U.S. Atty. Gen. J. Howard NlcGrath and James Ben
nett, director of the Bureau of Prisons, all opposed
her execution.
Mrs. Rosenberg and her husband Julius were put
to death at Sing Sing prison in 1953 after they were
convicted of supplying atomic secrets to the Soviet
Union.
Other declassified documents alleged that Julius
Rosenberg confessed his guilt to a cellmate whom
he had tried to recruit for a Russian spy ring.
Rosenberg publicly maintained his innocence.
The Rosenberg papers were made public as a re
sult of a suit filed under the Freedom of Information
act by the couple's two sons, Michael and Robert
Meeropol, who have launched a campaign to prove
their parents innocent.
Among the documents was a memorandum from
Hoover to McGrath on April 2, 1951. "This woman
is the mother of two small children," Hoover said of
Ethel Rosenberg. "As the wife of Julius Rosenberg
she would, in a sense, be presumed to be acting
under the influence of her husband."
Weicker: "Enforce full penalty"
NEW YORK — Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said
yesterday that he thinks Congress should carry its
contempt citation against Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger through to the final stage
—imprisonment.
He said the secretary "feels there is one set of
rules for Kissinger and another for the democracy
called the United States of America."
The Connecticut Republican said Kissinger has
"to understand that we do things in the open and
that in the end, the American people have to pay the
bill and have a right to know."
Weicker added that his own vote was one of
seven in the Senate against Kissinger's confirma
tion as secretary.
The House Select Committee on Intelligence
voted Friday to cite Kissinger for failure to reply to
three subpoenas for documents on covert United
States intelligence operations.
A majority of the43s member body must approve
the citation before it is turned over to the Justice
Department for investigation. Conviction could
bring a year in jail and a $1000 fine on each of the
three counts.

section of the $6.6 billion rescue plan Gov. Hugh
Carey has proposed that has yet been taken up by
the lawmakers.
The moratorium is considered a key in obtaining
some kind of federal intervention in the financial
crisis, particularly since President Ford has said
there would be no federal aid prior to a default.
The measure allows the city to refuse to redeem at
face value the $1.6 billion in short-term debt due
between now and next June — giving noteholders
the choice of taking new notes or waiting three
years to be paid for the present notes.
Rosenberg papers published
NEW YORK — The late P'BI Director J. Edgar
Hoover and other top law enforcement officials re
commended mercy for convicted spy Ethel Rosen
berg prior to her execution, government documents
reveal.
The documents showed that Hoover,

U.S. Atty. Gen. J. Howard NlcGrath and James Ben
nett, director of the Bureau of Prisons, all opposed
her execution.
Mrs. Rosenberg and her husband Julius were put
to death at Sing Sing prison in 1953 after they were
convicted of supplying atomic secrets to the Soviet
Union.
Other declassified documents alleged that Julius
Rosenberg confessed his guilt to a cellmate whom
he had tried to recruit for a Russian spy ring.
Rosenberg publicly maintained his innocence.
The Rosenberg papers were made public as a re
sult of a suit filed under the Freedom of Information
act by the couple's two sons, Michael and Robert
Meeropol, who have launched a campaign to prove
their parents innocent.
Among the documents was a memorandum from
Hoover to McGrath on April 2, 1951. "This woman
is the mother of two small children," Hoover said of
Ethel Rosenberg. "As the wife of Julius Rosenberg
she would, in a sense, be presumed to be acting
under the influence of her husband."
Weicker: "Enforce full penalty"
NEW YORK — Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said
yesterday that he thinks Congress should carry its
contempt citation against Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger through to the final stage
—imprisonment.
He said the secretary "feels there is one set of
rules for Kissinger and another for the democracy
called the United States of America."
The Connecticut Republican said Kissinger has
"to understand that we do things in the open and
that in the end, the American people have to pay the
bill and have a right to know."
Weicker added that his own vote was one of
seven in the Senate against Kissinger's confirma
tion as secretary.
The House Select Committee on Intelligence
voted Friday to cite Kissinger for failure to reply to
three subpoenas for documents on covert United
States intelligence operations.
A majority of the43s member body must approve
the citation before it is turned over to the Justice
Department for investigation. Conviction could
bring a year in jail and a $1000 fine on each of the
three counts.

Carter defeats Wallace
ORLANDO, Fla. — Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy
Carter easily won a straw presidential poll of dele
gates at the Democratic state convention yesterday,
knocking Alabama Gov. George Wallace to a sur
prising third place.
Carter, a 51-year-old peanut farmer from Plains,
Ga., has been campaigning hard in Florida, making
thepopularty contest a two-way tug of war between
himself and Wallace.
Charter called his victory "a good omen for the
Florida primary" and predicted he would win the
March 9 contest. "It's the result of hard work during
the last eight months," he said through his press
aide.
Carter polled 697 votes, or 67 percent of the 1035
ballots cast by delegates to the first Florida Democ
ratic convention since the turn of the century.
Wallace claimed only 57 votes, or 6 percent, a
sharp contrast to his 1972 presidential primary
showing when he captured 42 percent of Florida's
vote.
Franco's condition grave
MADRID. Spain — Generalissimo Francisco
Franco remained in very grave condition yesterday
as Spanish newspapers debated whether it was
humane to continue keeping him alve by artificial
means.
A midday medical bulletin indicated the
82-year-old Franco could survive for hours,
perhaps days.
His life was dependent on coagulants, a kidney
machine, an artificial respirator and the combined
efforts of 26 physicians.
Press commentators questioned the humanity of
keeping the general alive since power has already
been vested temorarily in his chosen successor.
Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon, whose future as
Spain's king is assured constitutionally.
Israel objects to conference
JERUSALEM — Israel has told the United States
it objects to attending the Geneva Mideast peace
conference if the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) is invited to take part, it was announced
yesterday.
Israel also insists that Syria renew the mandate of
the U.N. buffer force on the Golan Heights before
the peace conference is called into session, said a
communique following an Israeli cabinet meeting.
The communique said Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin informed the cabinet of this position after the
Soviet Union asked Washington to reconvene the
conference with the participation of the PLO.
The Israeli statement stopped short of an outright
refusal to attend the conference if the PLO is in
vited. Israeli officials say privately that the Palesti
nians could attend as members of the Jordanian
delegation. Some observers here see a possibility of

compromise if the guerrilla movement recognizes
Israel and renounces the use of force.
Home rule for Scotland, Wales
LONDON — Britain's Labor party government is
putting final touches on plans to reverse 288 years
of history and hand back partial self-government to
the 5.2 million people of Scotland.
It also plans an elected assembly for the 2.7 mill
ion people of Wales.
Some of Britain's 635 law-makers in the House of
Commons in London are asking if all this is thestart
of the breakup of Britain, even though Prime Minis
ter Harold Wilson has assured them, "There is no
question of any proposals for the breakup of the
United Kingdom."
The man in charge of Parliament's team on de
volution. as the subject has come to be known, is
Edward Short, leader of the House of Commons,
who says it will be "the most important constitu
tional document of this century."
Devolution means the surrender of authority
from a central government to a regional authority.
Under pressure from Scottish and Welsh
nationalist parties calling for more independence,
the Laborites promised that their government "will
create elected assemblies for Scotland and Wales."

Franco's condition grave
MADRID. Spain — Generalissimo Francisco
Franco remained in very grave condition yesterday
as Spanish newspapers debated whether it was
humane to continue keeping him alve by artificial
means.
A midday medical bulletin indicated the
82-year-old Franco could survive for hours,
perhaps days.
His life was dependent on coagulants, a kidney
machine, an artificial respirator and the combined
efforts of 26 physicians.
Press commentators questioned the humanity of
keeping the general alive since power has already
been vested temorarily in his chosen successor.
Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon, whose future as
Spain's king is assured constitutionally.
Israel objects to conference
JERUSALEM — Israel has told the United States
it objects to attending the Geneva Mideast peace
conference if the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) is invited to take part, it was announced
yesterday.
Israel also insists that Syria renew the mandate of
the U.N. buffer force on the Golan Heights before
the peace conference is called into session, said a
communique following an Israeli cabinet meeting.
The communique said Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin informed the cabinet of this position after the
Soviet Union asked Washington to reconvene the
conference with the participation of the PLO.
The Israeli statement stopped short of an outright
refusal to attend the conference if the PLO is in
vited. Israeli officials say privately that the Palesti
nians could attend as members of the Jordanian
delegation. Some observers here see a possibility of

compromise if the guerrilla movement recognizes
Israel and renounces the use of force.
Home rule for Scotland, Wales
LONDON — Britain's Labor party government is
putting final touches on plans to reverse 288 years
of history and hand back partial self-government to
the 5.2 million people of Scotland.
It also plans an elected assembly for the 2.7 mill
ion people of Wales.
Some of Britain's 635 law-makers in the House of
Commons in London are asking if all this is thestart
of the breakup of Britain, even though Prime Minis
ter Harold Wilson has assured them, "There is no
question of any proposals for the breakup of the
United Kingdom."
The man in charge of Parliament's team on de
volution. as the subject has come to be known, is
Edward Short, leader of the House of Commons,
who says it will be "the most important constitu
tional document of this century."
Devolution means the surrender of authority
from a central government to a regional authority.
Under pressure from Scottish and Welsh
nationalist parties calling for more independence,
the Laborites promised that their government "will
create elected assemblies for Scotland and Wales."
New York: "De facto default"
ALBANY, N.Y. — The moratorium on payment
of New York City notes passed by the state legisla
ture has been called a de facto default by observers
in the financial community.
A moratorium that will affect only individuals
and not banks was approved Friday at a special
session of the New York Legislature. It is the only
section of the $6.6 billion rescue plan Gov. Hugh
Carey has proposed that has yet been taken up by
the lawmakers.
The moratorium is considered a key in obtaining
some kind of federal intervention in the financial
crisis, particularly since President Ford has said
there would be no federal aid prior to a default.
The measure allows the city to refuse to redeem at
face value the $1.6 billion in short-term debt due
between now and next June — giving noteholders
the choice of taking new notes or waiting three
years to be paid for the present notes.
Rosenberg papers published
NEW YORK — The late P'BI Director J. Edgar
Hoover and other top law enforcement officials re
commended mercy for convicted spy Ethel Rosen
berg prior to her execution, government documents
reveal.
The documents showed that Hoover,

U.S. Atty. Gen. J. Howard NlcGrath and James Ben
nett, director of the Bureau of Prisons, all opposed
her execution.
Mrs. Rosenberg and her husband Julius were put
to death at Sing Sing prison in 1953 after they were
convicted of supplying atomic secrets to the Soviet
Union.
Other declassified documents alleged that Julius
Rosenberg confessed his guilt to a cellmate whom
he had tried to recruit for a Russian spy ring.
Rosenberg publicly maintained his innocence.
The Rosenberg papers were made public as a re
sult of a suit filed under the Freedom of Information
act by the couple's two sons, Michael and Robert
Meeropol, who have launched a campaign to prove
their parents innocent.
Among the documents was a memorandum from
Hoover to McGrath on April 2, 1951. "This woman
is the mother of two small children," Hoover said of
Ethel Rosenberg. "As the wife of Julius Rosenberg
she would, in a sense, be presumed to be acting
under the influence of her husband."
Weicker: "Enforce full penalty"
NEW YORK — Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said
yesterday that he thinks Congress should carry its
contempt citation against Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger through to the final stage
—imprisonment.
He said the secretary "feels there is one set of
rules for Kissinger and another for the democracy
called the United States of America."
The Connecticut Republican said Kissinger has
"to understand that we do things in the open and
that in the end, the American people have to pay the
bill and have a right to know."
Weicker added that his own vote was one of
seven in the Senate against Kissinger's confirma
tion as secretary.
The House Select Committee on Intelligence
voted Friday to cite Kissinger for failure to reply to
three subpoenas for documents on covert United
States intelligence operations.
A majority of the43s member body must approve
the citation before it is turned over to the Justice
Department for investigation. Conviction could
bring a year in jail and a $1000 fine on each of the
three counts.

Carter defeats Wallace
ORLANDO, Fla. — Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy
Carter easily won a straw presidential poll of dele
gates at the Democratic state convention yesterday,
knocking Alabama Gov. George Wallace to a sur
prising third place.
Carter, a 51-year-old peanut farmer from Plains,
Ga., has been campaigning hard in Florida, making
thepopularty contest a two-way tug of war between
himself and Wallace.
Charter called his victory "a good omen for the
Florida primary" and predicted he would win the
March 9 contest. "It's the result of hard work during
the last eight months," he said through his press

berg prior to her execution, government documents
reveal.
The documents showed that Hoover,

U.S. Atty. Gen. J. Howard NlcGrath and James Ben
nett, director of the Bureau of Prisons, all opposed
her execution.
Mrs. Rosenberg and her husband Julius were put
to death at Sing Sing prison in 1953 after they were
convicted of supplying atomic secrets to the Soviet
Union.
Other declassified documents alleged that Julius
Rosenberg confessed his guilt to a cellmate whom
he had tried to recruit for a Russian spy ring.
Rosenberg publicly maintained his innocence.
The Rosenberg papers were made public as a re
sult of a suit filed under the Freedom of Information
act by the couple's two sons, Michael and Robert
Meeropol, who have launched a campaign to prove
their parents innocent.
Among the documents was a memorandum from
Hoover to McGrath on April 2, 1951. "This woman
is the mother of two small children," Hoover said of
Ethel Rosenberg. "As the wife of Julius Rosenberg
she would, in a sense, be presumed to be acting
under the influence of her husband."
Weicker: "Enforce full penalty"
NEW YORK — Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said
yesterday that he thinks Congress should carry its
contempt citation against Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger through to the final stage
—imprisonment.
He said the secretary "feels there is one set of
rules for Kissinger and another for the democracy
called the United States of America."
The Connecticut Republican said Kissinger has
"to understand that we do things in the open and
that in the end, the American people have to pay the
bill and have a right to know."
Weicker added that his own vote was one of
seven in the Senate against Kissinger's confirma
tion as secretary.
The House Select Committee on Intelligence
voted Friday to cite Kissinger for failure to reply to
three subpoenas for documents on covert United
States intelligence operations.
A majority of the43s member body must approve
the citation before it is turned over to the Justice
Department for investigation. Conviction could
bring a year in jail and a $1000 fine on each of the
three counts.

Carter defeats Wallace
ORLANDO, Fla. — Former Georgia Gov. Jimmy
Carter easily won a straw presidential poll of dele
gates at the Democratic state convention yesterday,
knocking Alabama Gov. George Wallace to a sur
prising third place.
Carter, a 51-year-old peanut farmer from Plains,
Ga., has been campaigning hard in Florida, making
thepopularty contest a two-way tug of war between
himself and Wallace.
Charter called his victory "a good omen for the
Florida primary" and predicted he would win the
March 9 contest. "It's the result of hard work during
the last eight months," he said through his press
aide.
Carter polled 697 votes, or 67 percent of the 1035
ballots cast by delegates to the first Florida Democ
ratic convention since the turn of the century.
Wallace claimed only 57 votes, or 6 percent, a
sharp contrast to his 1972 presidential primary
showing when he captured 42 percent of Florida's
vote.
Franco's condition grave
MADRID. Spain — Generalissimo Francisco
Franco remained in very grave condition yesterday
as Spanish newspapers debated whether it was
humane to continue keeping him alve by artificial
means.
A midday medical bulletin indicated the
82-year-old Franco could survive for hours,
perhaps days.
His life was dependent on coagulants, a kidney
machine, an artificial respirator and the combined
efforts of 26 physicians.
Press commentators questioned the humanity of
keeping the general alive since power has already
been vested temorarily in his chosen successor.
Prince Juan Carlos de Borbon, whose future as
Spain's king is assured constitutionally.
Israel objects to conference
JERUSALEM — Israel has told the United States
it objects to attending the Geneva Mideast peace
conference if the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) is invited to take part, it was announced
yesterday.
Israel also insists that Syria renew the mandate of
the U.N. buffer force on the Golan Heights before
the peace conference is called into session, said a
communique following an Israeli cabinet meeting.
The communique said Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin informed the cabinet of this position after the
Soviet Union asked Washington to reconvene the
conference with the participation of the PLO.
The Israeli statement stopped short of an outright
refusal to attend the conference if the PLO is in
vited. Israeli officials say privately that the Palesti
nians could attend as members of the Jordanian
delegation. Some observers here see a possibility of

compromise if the guerrilla movement recognizes
Israel and renounces the use of force.
Home rule for Scotland, Wales
LONDON — Britain's Labor party government is
putting final touches on plans to reverse 288 years
of history and hand back partial self-government to
the 5.2 million people of Scotland.
It also plans an elected assembly for the 2.7 mill
ion people of Wales.
Some of Britain's 635 law-makers in the House of
Commons in London are asking if all this is thestart
of the breakup of Britain, even though Prime Minis
ter Harold Wilson has assured them, "There is no
question of any proposals for the breakup of the
United Kingdom."
The man in charge of Parliament's team on de
volution. as the subject has come to be known, is
Edward Short, leader of the House of Commons,
who says it will be "the most important constitu
tional document of this century."
Devolution means the surrender of authority
from a central government to a regional authority.
Under pressure from Scottish and Welsh
nationalist parties calling for more independence,
the Laborites promised that their government "will
create elected assemblies for Scotland and Wales."
New York: "De facto default"
ALBANY, N.Y. — The moratorium on payment
of New York City notes passed by the state legisla
ture has been called a de facto default by observers
in the financial community.
A moratorium that will affect only individuals
and not banks was approved Friday at a special
session of the New York Legislature. It is the only
section of the $6.6 billion rescue plan Gov. Hugh
Carey has proposed that has yet been taken up by
the lawmakers.
The moratorium is considered a key in obtaining
some kind of federal intervention in the financial
crisis, particularly since President Ford has said
there would be no federal aid prior to a default.
The measure allows the city to refuse to redeem at
face value the $1.6 billion in short-term debt due
between now and next June — giving noteholders
the choice of taking new notes or waiting three
years to be paid for the present notes.
