Federal student grant and loan prog
rams might be expanded and other
programs such as Work Study re
duced. according to senior Tom
Naylor, recently appointed to the na
tional Advisory Council on Financial
Aid to Students.
The only student on the 21-member
council. Naylor returned last week
from the first of three meetings this
year in Washington. D.C. He will serve
a three-year term on the council,
which reviews federal financial aid
programs and makes annual recom
mendations to the Department of
Health. Education and Welfare (HEW).
"Congress and HEW are trying to
expand BEOC (Basic Educational Op
portunity Crants, given to low-income
students), but if they don't get more
money, the grants will drop," Naylor
explained. "Work Study and other
programs might be cut to fund BEOC,
and the Direct Cuaranteed) Student
Loans might be phased out."
Naylor's specific job on the council
will be to investigate the issue of aid to
individual students versus aid to in
stitutions and submit an issue paper at

the February council meeting. In April
the council will compile the reports of
all the members and submit the annual
report and recommendations to Con
gress and HEW by June.
No decisive power
"The council has no real decision
making power," Naylor said. When
Congress created the council, it man
dated that at least one member be a
student. Naylor was nominated by
Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) and ap
pointed by former Secretary of Health.
Education and Welfare Casper Wein
berger.
Last year, under the chairmanship of
Roger Freeman of the Hoover Institu
tion, the council submitted its first
"annual report" since its creation in
1965. It is awaiting response on its 21
recommendations from the U.S.
Commissioner of Education.
No federal relief is in sight for
middle-income students and their
families, according to Naylor. "Be
cause of the inflation and general na
tional economic problems, the gov
ernment is giving more and more
money to the low-income students.
The middle class is having to finance
the low-income group in private uni
versities, and the upper-income group
in state schools," he said.
Tax credits for middle-income stu
dents and increases in the tuition at
state schools would ease the squeeze
on the middle class, Navlor suggested.
No major changes in federal finan
cial aid programs are foreseen by Uni
versity Director of Financial Aid,
Robert Huff who said, "1 think the
same programs will exist, hopefully
improved, and at the same level."
"The BEOG is important because it
gives students access to college, while
the loan and- work programs offer a
choice between colleges," he con
tinued.
Huff pointed out that a bill currently
in Congress that would give some fed
eral aid on the basis of merit as well as
need and offer part-time work to stu
dents regardless of need has been criti
cized.
"There are limited funds, so they go
to the needv first," he concluded.
