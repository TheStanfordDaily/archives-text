# Student aid policies called 'not equitable'
## 
### BERT BOWER 
An investigation of the Advisory
Committee on Undergraduate Admis
sions and Financial Aid (CUAFA)
conducted by three students has con
cluded that Stanford's financial aid
policies are "not equitable or accord
ing to need in the least."
Dan Howard, ASSU Vice president
Josie Jaramillo and Mike Kieschnick,
an ASSU committee staff assistant.
The three students probed the
University's categories for rewarding
financial aid and discovered that "II A"
students (the top five percent academ
ically) have one half to two thirds less
self-help requirements than most other
students on financial aid.
lIA students are those who have ex
ceptionally high grade point averages
(CPA's) and Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) scores as opposed to the 118
category admitted for (diversity) and
lIC average admittee qualifications.
An additional category, VLI (very low
income students), exists for those stu
dents fropi low income families such
as a three-child family with an income
below $9,070.
Scholarship, self help
Financial aid usually combines a
scholarship 1 and a self-help require
ment — the amount paid by the stu
dent through working or taking out a
loan.

Over a four year period lIA students
pay a maximum of $2400 in self help,
while 118 students maximum is $4000,
lI.C students' $6200 and VLI students'
$2850. Minority students are expected
to pay four-fifths of the amount listed
in each respective category; thus
minority VLI students' self-help max
imum is slightly lower than that for lIA
students.
After a student's non-minority pa
rental contribution is determined, the
University allots financial need in the
self-help category. If need exists
beyond the self-help maximum, scho
larships are then awarded.
The authors of the report offer a sim
ple solution to what they see as a
"basic inequity." They urge the elimi
nation of the categories, lIA, 118, lIC
and the formation of one general cat
gory which would include transfer
students. They would retain, however,
the VLI category.
Reduce minority self help
In addition, they recommended that
the amount of self-help required by
minorities be decreased.
"lIA students are generally those
who come from comfortable, middle
class backgrounds with excellent
academic and extra-curricular oppor
tunities," said Howard. The report,
however, shows that lIA students have
lower self-help maximums than most

VLI students.
Based on that finding, the report
concludes "To award comparable fi
nancial aid to a student with an upper
class background and excellent educa
tional credentials (CPA, SAT) as to a
VLI student who probahlv attended an
inferior public school is not equitable
or according to need."
Director of Financial Aids, Robert
Huff said he understood "the thrust of
the report as recommending that stu
dent aid be used to solve social prob
lems." He declared, however, that,
"financial aid and Stanford is used
only to attract the most academically
talented students."
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon,
reacted more strongly to the Howard
Report, calling it "an absurd position,
a totally political position."
Hargadon's opinion
He said his conception of financial
aid differed from the report's conclu
sions. "I happen to think it(aid) should
be used to enhance the University
academically. Aid is rewarded to bring
the most capable students here, not to
reward the least qualified and penalize
the most qualified student "
The report, however, questioned the
"extreme effort made by the 11niversity
to attract students with credentials
that look good on paper." Citing a
