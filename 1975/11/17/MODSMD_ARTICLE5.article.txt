# Decal sales spur confrontation
## Indian mascot controversy flares 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Stanford Indian mascot con
troversy, a virtually dead issue for the
past three years, surfaced again last
week as the campaign to revive the
school symbol shifted into high gear.
Stanford Indian decals, costing 50
cents, were offered for sale openly at
Saturday's Stanford-Oregon game
and under-the-counter throughout
the week at various University Av
enue stores.
With the Big Game approaching,
several thousand decals already have
been sold, according to alumnus
Lowell Berry, vice president of the
New Founders League.
A conservative alumni group, the
New Founders League has sponsored
the decal, claiming that removal of
the Native American mascot was a
political move, not supported by the
majority of students or alumni.
Opponents louder
Meanwhile, opponents of the In
dian symbol, including University
President Richard Lyman and ASSU
President Lee Rosenbaum, have
stepped up their rhetoric against the
decal and its proponents.
Lyman Wednesday labeled efforts
to bring the Indian back "crude,"
while Rosenbaum described the
symbol as "offensive."
Early last week, groups of students, '
including Rosenbaum, visited the
seven merchants selling the Indian
decals. The students protested and
indicated they might picket the
stores and boycott businesses offer
ing Stanford Indian paraphernalia.

In addition, a resolution firmly op
posing the return of the Indian is ex
pected at tonight's ASSU Senate
meeting.
Restoration sought
"We're not trying to create turmoil,
but we hopethat the net result of this
is sooner or later that the Indian will
be restored," Berry said in an inter-

view last week. "The Indian is alive
and in the hearts of a lot of alumni."
Berry cited the mascot issue as a
focal point for alumni who are dis
gruntled with the University policies
and administration. He said he has
had "reports" of numerous alumni
withholding donations from Stan
ford since the Indian's demise, in-

eluding one man who has refused to
contribute $250,000.
Despite economic threats from
alumni. anti-Indian forces in the
Administration remain determined.
"I don't even regard an Indian
symbol as even the remotest possibil
ity," Dean of Students Affairs James
Lyons told the Daily. "Nobody likes
to lose financial support, but I don't
know of any alternative. We're not
going to adopt ethnic slogans or mas
cots for money.
'Insensitive cruelty'
"There's a fundamental insensi
tive cruelty on the part of those who
would bring the Indian back. A sig
nificant group of Stanford students
are deeply, morally hurt by the In
dian symbol. And it's wrong that
they should be hurt," Lyons said.
Lyons' office has spearheaded the
Administration's counter-attack
against the Indian revival. After the
Dollies wore feathered headbands at
the Washington State-Stanford game
Oct. 25, they were summoned by
Lyons' assistant Alan Strain to dis
cuss the "appropriateness" of the
feathers.
Lyons' office has also contacted
band manager Bill Wick and asked
that the group drop the pre-gamefan
fare, the "thunderchickens" chant,
the traditional ax formation and the
"Scalp Song," in addition to changes
in the Dollies' uniforms.
Strain asked the Hand to make a
public statement that it did not sup
port the Indian mascot. Me also sug
gested that the University establish
an ad hoc committee to consider alt
erations in the Dollies' dresses and
revision of the Band's standard
routines, according to Wick.
Wick responded, "If there are any
changes in the Band, we'll make
them ourselves. We don't want to of
fend anyone, but we're not going to
dump the fanfare without something
better to replace it."
Wick added that he felt the Band
could not make a public statement
against the Indian symbol because,
"the Band isn't one person. It's a loi
of people with a lot of different opin
ions.
"I don't think it's so much that stu
dents want the Indian. I think the\
just want something they can get be
hind," he said.
Dolly Terry Elms agreed, adding
that, "the only way to curb (the In
dian revival) is to get a new mascot
for students to get excited about."
