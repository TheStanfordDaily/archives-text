# Where the Indian went
## 
### 
It could easily be missed by the
casual historian tracing the events of
spring. 1972. Amid the tumult of the
most violent anti-war demonstra
tions ever to occur at Stanford, the
Indian was eliminated as the mascot
of athletic teams here.
Earlier in the 19705, under pres
sure from a group of Native American
students, the Bookstore stopped sel
ling emblems containing a big-nosed
caricature of an Indian brave. It was
replaced by the "dignified" counte
nance of fl tribal chief.
A petition from 55 Native Ameri
can students in February, 1972 ar
gued that even the "proud" emblem
obscured the plight of their race, and
they demanded that it be removed.
President Richard Lyman, after first
arguing that the symbol "might
further the cause of Native Ameri
cans." said h' 1 was "more and more
persuaded"hvthegroup's argument.
Timm Williams, who as the danc
ing Prince Lightfoot personified the
symbol, objected to any change and

defended his own background as
genuine. His Yurok tribesmen wrote
Lyman urging him to keep the sym
bol.
The ASSU Senate voted 18-4 in
March. 1972 to abandon the Indian,
and set up a committee to select a
new mascot.
On April 20. Lyman officially
abolished the Indian symbol, later
stating that it did not reflect the
status of modern Native Americans.
By this time opposition to the
change had mounted in some quar
ters. Students supporting the old
mascot took the matter to a referen
dum, with 58 percent of the voting
students backing the Indian. The bal
lot was ignored.
The mascot committee chose
"Thunderchickens" as the new sym
bol, but a negative response from the
Athletic Department blocked accep
tance, The issue drifted, and the
name "Cardinals." which preceded
"Indians," was unofficially reins
tated.
