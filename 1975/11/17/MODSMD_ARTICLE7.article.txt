# U.N. vote wrong

The United Nations anti-
Zionist resolution is a senseless
and self-defeating document
which can have only negative
results for the Arab cause. The
reaction in the United States,
however, has been equally irra
tional, and potentially danger
ous.
The U.N. resolution did not
represent a "rebirth of Hit
lerism," as some have charged.
Nor was it simply a spontaneous
eruption of anti-Semitism. The
resolution was a sign of frustra
tion and growing despairat what
the Arab nations and their allies
perceive to be Israeli intransig
ence against a just settlement in
the Middle East. #
For eight years they have
sought restoration of territory
captured by Israel in 19(>7 and
recognition of the Palestinians'
right toa homeland of theirown.
The Israeli government has re
fused even to recognize the grie
vances of the Palestinians and
has repeatedly announced its de
termination to retain the Golan
Heights and Jerusalem.
Israel has insisted that it will
not negotiate with nations that
do not recognize Israel's right to
exist, although it is difficult to
see what could be lost through
such negotiation.
Hut there have recently been
unmistakable signs of softening
of the Arab position. Last sum
mer, the London representative
of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLQ) expressed wil
lingness to accept the legitimacy
of Israel within its pre-19(>7 bor
ders provided that Israel recog
nize the right of Palestinians to
their own state.
Ben Seaver of the American
Friends Service Committee re
ported after a recent tour of the
Middle East that a major PLO
spokesman in Lebanon made a
similar statement and that his
position was supported "with
out equivocation" by officials in
Egypt. Jordan and Syria.
To my knowledge, there has
been no movement on the part of

the Israeli government to im
plement, or even discuss, these
proposals.
If the anti-Zionist resolution
was an irrational cry of outrage,
American response was no more
constructive.
There have been demands that
the United States withdraw from
U.N. agencies and cut its finan
cial contributions, as if crippling
our one international forum of
fers any hope of dissolving the
bitterness expressed in that
forum. In an especially illogical
move, the United States an
nounced that it will not partici
pate in a U.N. campaign against
racism next year.
Hut even more disturbing is
the apparent lack of recognition
by Americans that the U.N. re
solution was an unfortunate
outgrowth of legitimate grie
vances, and that these grie
vances cannot be left to smoul
der until another, and- perhaps
final, war breaks out.
There is a widespread ten
dency to assume that the Israeli
government can do no wrong
and that any criticism of its
policies is a threat aimed at
Israel's survival. Ironically,
within Israel itself there is con
siderable criticism of the
government's unwillingness to
seek a settlement with the Pales
tinians.
Those of us who feel commit
ted to Israel's survival, and to the
survival of traditional Jewish
values, should ask what actually
can be accomplished by angry
petitions, protests against the
U.N. and cries of "Never again!"
Israel will live only if it can
find peace with its neighbors.
Peace can come, not by means of
Pershing missiles, but through a
lessening of tensions among the
people involved. There are those
on both sides in the Middle East
who are attempting to build a re
lationship of trust between
Arabs and Jews.
