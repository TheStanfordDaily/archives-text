# Must C-UAFA be Hargadon's puppet?
## 
### 
Howard, et al.

Events of the past year have clearly de
monstrated that students do not have ade
quate input into basic decisions affecting
their education. Our dissatisfaction with
this state of affairs led us to begin a review of
the entire committee system.
We chose to examine C-UAFA (the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid) first because of its central
position in the University in that it deter
mines the composition of the student body.
C-UAFA is a committee of the Academic
Cofincil and is composed of seven faculty
members, three students, and two ex-officio
members from the administration: Fred
Hargadon, dean of Admissions, and Robert
Huff, director of Financial Aids.
Although its charge specifically gives it
the responsibility of establishing policy for
admissions and financial aids, the commit
tee traditionally has been little more than a
rubber stamp for Hargadon and his policies.
How could this situation arise and what can
or should be done about it?
Lack of experience
C-UAFA has been plagued by many prob
lems, some of which it shares with other
University committees. Most notable of
these is the lack of experience and know
ledge on the part of faculty and student
members.
Another factor limiting C-UAFA's effec
tiveness in the past has been its extremely
limited number of meetings. Last year, in a
period of tremendous flux within the Uni
versity, and especially within the realm of
financial aids, the committee met only six
times.
Hargadon guards files
The committee has been further hindered
by the total confidentiality of the admis
sions process at Stanford. Although ideally
the committee members are privy to all in
formation regarding admissions and finan
cial aid (except a student's actual file), they
are totally dependent on Hargadon for in
formation on admissions and he can relate
or withhold as much information as serves
his purpose.

Civen this dependence, it is no wonder
that the committee has diminished into a
rubber stamp for his policies.
The charge to the committee became of
increasing importance to some of the mem
bers last year as they became uncomfortable
with the role that they were playing on
C-UAFA. The events of the year regarding
financial aid for minority students and
other substantive issues had caused many
students and special interest groups to look
to C-UAFA for explanations and assur
ances.
These committee members felt strongly
the committee's lack of information and ex
pertise on questions regarding criteria
policies and the actual effects of these
policies on admissions and financial aids.
Admitting the expertise of Hargadon,
David Asai, a student C-UAFA member last
year, attempted to propose a satisfactory
merger between the dean's expertise and
the committee's policy responsibility. At a
meeting on April 15 Asai suggested a revi
sion in the way high schools would be
selected for recruiting, a subject that had
been known only to the dean in the past.
Unfortunately, his proposals were never
discussed as Hargadon launched into a
protracted personal attack that quelled all
discussion. He told the committee that it
had no business dealing with "his" policies
because it did not know the issues; and he
informed the committee that he could either
talk about how admissions works or he
could do admissions, implying that he had
no time or responsibility for the former.
Intolerable situation
We find this situation intolerable. Admis
sions at Stanford do not exist to satisfy the
ego of one man who believes himself to be
the "gatekeeper" of the University (Faculty
Senate. Feb. 21).
We recognize Hargadon's capability as an
administrator, but to allow the admissions
process to remain a one man show is to
invite the possibility of stagnation, and a
student body composed of one man's notion
of excellence.

A single person's judgment is vulnerable
to personal prejudices and limitations of
experience which ultimately will be re
flected in the student body. This danger
would be markedly decreased by a commit
tee decision on admissions.
On the basis of our investigation we have
several reforms to suggest in the current
structure of C-UAFA and the admissions
process. We recommend that the veil of con
fidentiality over every aspect of the admis
sions and financial aid process be lifted for
C-UAFA members so that the committee
:an more effectively pursue its duties, and
so that it can become the policy making
body that it was intended to he.
VVe also recommend that C-UAFA meet
more often so that its tendency to be an
accessory after the fact may be alleviated.
We further recommend that the committee
make mandatory at least one meeting per
quarter without ex-officio members present,
in the hope that discussion may flow more
freely without their obstructing influence.
Finally we propose the formation of a
committee composed of two faculty mem
bers, two students, one representative from
the offices of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies and the Dean of Admissions which
would have final authority over under
graduate admission.
This would insure input from different
and fresh viewpoints into the admissions
process, and would be the most effective
means of combatting the present danger of
an increasingly homogeneous student
body.
In this and other tasks, we hope that the
new membership of C-UAFA this year can
work more effectively tOgetherand stem the
movement towards an increasingly elite
University.
