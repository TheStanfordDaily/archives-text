The quality behind the name...
KENWOOD RECEIVERS
KENWOOD quality starts deep inside every KENWOOD receiver:
With sophisticated new engineering concepts like direct
coupling, tape-through circuitry, and a phase-lock-loop in the
MPX section. With top-grade transistors, oversized heat sinks,
extra-large power transformers. With exceptional control
flexibility and ample provision for an expansive sound system.
The quality behind the name KENWOOD is the quality you
will enjoy in better performance and greater dependability for
years to come.
