# Blakley sings 'nicely'
## 
### JEFF EHRLICH 
Ronnee Blakley, the woman, the
artist, the Stanford graduate, has
come out with a new album for
Warner Bros., entitled Welcome.
The album's nice, like a lot of al
bums that are nice. But Blakley
herself gives the impression of
someone quite special.
The general public "disco
vered" her recently. She played
Barbara Jean in the movie
Nashville. Unfortunately,
Nashville gave practically no
concept of the real Ronnee Blakley
(except, perhaps, by the fact that
she was the only one of the actors
portraying country singers who
could actually sins).
Before Nashville, she was (as
she is now) a singer-songwriter
who wrote music for various film
scores.
A little over two years ago she
released her first album, on
Elektra Records.
In a live performance in San
Diego a few months after its re
lease she gave an incredibly en
joyable show, including some
songs from the album.
The songs sounded quite good
being sung then and there by her
— though they wouldn't be of the
same calibre if just heard from the
record.
She accompanied herself on
piano, playing what seemed like
rational, introspective love bal
lads in a style somewhere between
Carole King and Laura Nyro.
She's got a nice voice. Not ex
ceptional, or particularly unique,
but — well, "right."
Like her voice and performing,
her new album isn't exceptional
or incredible, but it's "nice."

It includes two of the songs she
wrote for Nashiville, and most of r
the album is similarly country
flavored. V
The most important parts of
Welcome are her lyrics.
Like many women songwriters,
she writes of her lips and downs
with love. It's not easy to figure
out just where she's at with love
and lovers, but thelyricsindicated
one who falls in love easily and
enjoys it while it's there, struggles
with being possessive or posses
sed, and accepts both her and her
lover's sexual non-exclusiveness
even if with a tinge of reluctance.
In "Please." she fears rejection
for speaking up: "Won't you put
me up . . . to look not touch." My
"Young Man," she tells her young
lover not to expect too much: "My
friend. I don't want to pretend/
That I love you more than I do I
Please say it's alright and I'll see

you tonight. . . But please don't
wait for mo outside my door."
And in the title song, she offers
acceptance to her best lover for the
sake of togetherness: "I don't care
where you've been 11 don't care if
you're late/ If you had an early
date/ But I want you to fit me in. . .
Honey, come over and be with
me."
Blakley's uniqueness lies in
these lyrics, in her particular ap
proach to love compared with
most other songwriters.
She is never bitter, not like the
intense bitterness of Dory Previn,
the mild bitterness of Janis lan, or
the seemingly self-indulgent bit
terness of Joni Mitchell. And
when you have a notion of who
Blakley is, to hear her sing her
lyrics is something very nice,
simple as the album generally
sounds. It is Ronnee Blakley her
self who is unique and excep
tional.
