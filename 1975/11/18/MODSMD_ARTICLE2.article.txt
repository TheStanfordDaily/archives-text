# It's worth it to care for those costly discs

After you've decided which
components to buy, which fea
tures you like best and what
brand you can afford, there's one
more aspect of stereo accessories
you had better consider: the re
cords.
The most expensive stereo out
fit around won't improve your
sound reproduction a bit if they
are in lousy condition. Techni
cians have not yet designed
equipment that can overcome
warps, ignore scratches, and play

through baked-on Baby Ruth.
You don't have to be ultra
fastidious — you don't need to
wear velvet gloves or use an air
filter to keep dust down, for ex
ample. All it takes is caution and
careful handling to let your al
bums stay sounding pure and
clean for ages.
A little kindness
First of all, be kind to your re
cords when you store them. Don't
stack them on top of each other;
stand them vertically. This helps

prevent warping. Don't leave
them near heat or in sunlight —
that gives them the bends too.
They've even been known to warp
when left sitting for an afternoon
on the turntable near a window.
When you take the record out of
the jacket, keep your pinkies off
the playing surface. Otherwise the
sound won't be much better than
dragging the tone arm across your
fingers themselves. Hold it by the
edges or the label.
When you put the record back
into the jacket, it's a good idea to
make sure the opening in the
paper liner doesn't line up with
the album cover opening edge.
Otherwise your Stones could roll
accidentally under your roomie's
bed and never be seen again.
Sound affected
The sound is also adversely af
fected by dust. It doesn't matter
how clean your room is — records
will attract every speck that isn't
glued down, through the miracle
of static electricity.
You can buy all sorts of gadgets
for combating this peril, and their
effectiveness correlates roughly
with their price. You can try anti
static cloths, brushes that fit on
the tone arm, dry hand-held
brushes, wet hand-held brushes
and Hoover vacuum cleaners.
One source of gradual deteriora
tion of your record is the needle
itself. Diamond being harder than
plastic, the grooves will slowly
grow wider and deeper, and you'll
notice the difference in sound.
When the entire record is a
scratchy monotone it's probably
time to buy a new one.
Less damage
To cut down on this damage, get
a light-tracking cartridge. A half
gram is about the lightest you can

obtain.
However, if your record is
warped, a light cartridge can
bounce right out of the groove,
which is another reason for not
leaving albums in the oven over
night.
And last — be careful to whom

you lend your albums. Make
sure they take even better care of
records than you do. Playing Kris
bee with them once can ruin them
forever, so don't take chances. Be
nice to theirs, too. In this business,
record-breaking achievements
aren't appreciated.

A NO-NO — Putting grubby fingers on record albums won't in
crease the albums' longevity, but it ivill create a good excuse for
buying new albums.
