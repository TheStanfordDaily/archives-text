# Neil Young hits a new artistic low
## 
### JEFF EHRLICH 
Noil Young has just released his third straight bad album in what
has turned out to be one of the most amazing artistic declines in rock
and folk-rock history.
Zuma is every bit as poor as its predecessors: Tonight's (he Night
(released earlier this year) and last year's On the Bench, all of which
feature poor singing, boring (if not downright sloppy) musicianship
and largely uninteresting songs. Sad evidence from a man who used to
be one of the truly incredible artists in the business.
Remember Young? He was the guy with the unique "shaky voice"
(as he himself described it in a song on Tonight's the Night) that was
high, clear, sometimes chilling, sometimes peaceful. His lyrics had a
very poetic quality; they were sometimes mysterious and often lone
some. He came up with simple yet original melodies that all managed
to sound good.
Musical attributes
This combination of musical attributes produced a number of great
songs with Buffalo Springfield in the late '60s, some fine material as
part of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in the early 70s and four high
quality solo albums between 1969 and 1972 — the studio masterpiece
Neil Young, the electric classic Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere
with backup band Crazy Horse, the relatively quiet After The Cold
Hush, and the countrified Harvest.
His lead guitar prowess had gone way down between the recordings
of Everybody Knows and Honest. And in 1973, he contracted laryn
gitis, and then sang on an extensive tour without having completely
recovered from it. His voice always seemed fragile, and his ruthless
straining of it on that tour did it in — for good, it seems.
The first evidence was all too clear on his fifth solo album, Time
Fades Away, a live album from the '73 tour. The songs (all previously
unrecorded) were still reasonably good, but Young's degenerated
voice, along with poor playing from his backup band, made Time
Fades Away a fairly unpalatable album.
Poor voice
Young sang on that '73 tour without any consideration of how poor
his voice sounded, or what further damage he might be doing to it. His
next album. On the Reach, showed a tragically thinned voice. Al
though a cleanly produced work. Beach featured surprisingly poor
songs.
The following album, Tonight's the Night featured a re-assembled
Crazy Horse sounding very loose and ragged. The songs continued to
be poor, anil his voice was as pitiable as ever.
Young has now released Zumu, and the singing remains wretched.
Crazy Horse's playing is as ragged as it was on Tonight's the Night —
Young has'really succeeded in turning it into a garage band.
Young himself takes up lead guitar again, but his playing is cautious
compared to the guts and frenzy displayed on Everybody Knows This
Is Nowhere, with his sudden fast bursts.
His lyrics and music on Zumu (and on the previous two albums) is
about as inspired as his voice. His words have lost their poetic quality,
are often quite unprofound, and sometimes vague-without-being
mysterious. Now and then he has something interesting to say. but
such moments are rare.
One good song
Zumu contains exactly one good song, an acoustic number called
"Pardon My Heart." It's melody is based on the pretty three-chord
pattern used in The Grateful Dead's rendition of "Know You Rider."
The pace of "Pardon My Heart" is slow and very similar to "The Old
Laughing Lady" from his first solo album.
The lyrics are a lament of a love gone bad: "it's a sad
communication/when one isn't giving/and one pretends to receive,"
but one which the singer isn't quite prepared to give up: "you brought
it all on/but it feels so wrong/no, no, don't believe this song."
Two epics
Zumu contains two "epics," i.e. long songs. "Danger Bird" and
"Cortez the Killer" are bores. "Danger Bird" is a straight steal of the
chord-pattern and pace of Robin Trower's "Hannah." The lyrics are
vague, and much of the singing is buried beneath the instruments.
"Cortez the Killer" is one of the slowest songs Young has ever
played. The story is a scattered narrative about the beauty of the
Aztecs and their cultural rape by Cortez and his men.
The album's last song is an acoustic washout called "Through My
Sails" that features Crosby. Stills & Nash on backup vocal. It is easily
the worst C-S-N-Y harmony arrangement ever recorded — though
they didn't have much of a song to work with
Nobody in their right mind should buy Zumu. If you're curious
about it, check out the I'M radio stations, who are already playing it
more than it deserves.

and folk-rock history.
Zuma is every bit as poor as its predecessors: Tonight's (he Night
(released earlier this year) and last year's On the Bench, all of which
feature poor singing, boring (if not downright sloppy) musicianship
and largely uninteresting songs. Sad evidence from a man who used to
be one of the truly incredible artists in the business.
Remember Young? He was the guy with the unique "shaky voice"
(as he himself described it in a song on Tonight's the Night) that was
high, clear, sometimes chilling, sometimes peaceful. His lyrics had a
very poetic quality; they were sometimes mysterious and often lone
some. He came up with simple yet original melodies that all managed
to sound good.
Musical attributes
This combination of musical attributes produced a number of great
songs with Buffalo Springfield in the late '60s, some fine material as
part of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in the early 70s and four high
quality solo albums between 1969 and 1972 — the studio masterpiece
Neil Young, the electric classic Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere
with backup band Crazy Horse, the relatively quiet After The Cold
Hush, and the countrified Harvest.
His lead guitar prowess had gone way down between the recordings
of Everybody Knows and Honest. And in 1973, he contracted laryn
gitis, and then sang on an extensive tour without having completely
recovered from it. His voice always seemed fragile, and his ruthless
straining of it on that tour did it in — for good, it seems.
The first evidence was all too clear on his fifth solo album, Time
Fades Away, a live album from the '73 tour. The songs (all previously
unrecorded) were still reasonably good, but Young's degenerated
voice, along with poor playing from his backup band, made Time
Fades Away a fairly unpalatable album.
Poor voice
Young sang on that '73 tour without any consideration of how poor
his voice sounded, or what further damage he might be doing to it. His
next album. On the Reach, showed a tragically thinned voice. Al
though a cleanly produced work. Beach featured surprisingly poor
songs.
The following album, Tonight's the Night featured a re-assembled
Crazy Horse sounding very loose and ragged. The songs continued to
be poor, anil his voice was as pitiable as ever.
Young has now released Zumu, and the singing remains wretched.
Crazy Horse's playing is as ragged as it was on Tonight's the Night —
Young has'really succeeded in turning it into a garage band.
Young himself takes up lead guitar again, but his playing is cautious
compared to the guts and frenzy displayed on Everybody Knows This
Is Nowhere, with his sudden fast bursts.
His lyrics and music on Zumu (and on the previous two albums) is
about as inspired as his voice. His words have lost their poetic quality,
are often quite unprofound, and sometimes vague-without-being
mysterious. Now and then he has something interesting to say. but
such moments are rare.
One good song
Zumu contains exactly one good song, an acoustic number called
"Pardon My Heart." It's melody is based on the pretty three-chord
pattern used in The Grateful Dead's rendition of "Know You Rider."
The pace of "Pardon My Heart" is slow and very similar to "The Old
Laughing Lady" from his first solo album.
The lyrics are a lament of a love gone bad: "it's a sad
communication/when one isn't giving/and one pretends to receive,"
but one which the singer isn't quite prepared to give up: "you brought
it all on/but it feels so wrong/no, no, don't believe this song."
Two epics
Zumu contains two "epics," i.e. long songs. "Danger Bird" and
"Cortez the Killer" are bores. "Danger Bird" is a straight steal of the
chord-pattern and pace of Robin Trower's "Hannah." The lyrics are
vague, and much of the singing is buried beneath the instruments.
"Cortez the Killer" is one of the slowest songs Young has ever
played. The story is a scattered narrative about the beauty of the
Aztecs and their cultural rape by Cortez and his men.
The album's last song is an acoustic washout called "Through My
Sails" that features Crosby. Stills & Nash on backup vocal. It is easily
the worst C-S-N-Y harmony arrangement ever recorded — though
they didn't have much of a song to work with
Nobody in their right mind should buy Zumu. If you're curious
about it, check out the I'M radio stations, who are already playing it
more than it deserves.

Zuma is every bit as poor as its predecessors: Tonight's (he Night
(released earlier this year) and last year's On the Bench, all of which
feature poor singing, boring (if not downright sloppy) musicianship
and largely uninteresting songs. Sad evidence from a man who used to
be one of the truly incredible artists in the business.
Remember Young? He was the guy with the unique "shaky voice"
(as he himself described it in a song on Tonight's the Night) that was
high, clear, sometimes chilling, sometimes peaceful. His lyrics had a
very poetic quality; they were sometimes mysterious and often lone
some. He came up with simple yet original melodies that all managed
to sound good.
Musical attributes
This combination of musical attributes produced a number of great
songs with Buffalo Springfield in the late '60s, some fine material as
part of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in the early 70s and four high
quality solo albums between 1969 and 1972 — the studio masterpiece
Neil Young, the electric classic Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere
with backup band Crazy Horse, the relatively quiet After The Cold
Hush, and the countrified Harvest.
His lead guitar prowess had gone way down between the recordings
of Everybody Knows and Honest. And in 1973, he contracted laryn
gitis, and then sang on an extensive tour without having completely
recovered from it. His voice always seemed fragile, and his ruthless
straining of it on that tour did it in — for good, it seems.
The first evidence was all too clear on his fifth solo album, Time
Fades Away, a live album from the '73 tour. The songs (all previously
unrecorded) were still reasonably good, but Young's degenerated
voice, along with poor playing from his backup band, made Time
Fades Away a fairly unpalatable album.
Poor voice
Young sang on that '73 tour without any consideration of how poor
his voice sounded, or what further damage he might be doing to it. His
next album. On the Reach, showed a tragically thinned voice. Al
though a cleanly produced work. Beach featured surprisingly poor
songs.
The following album, Tonight's the Night featured a re-assembled
Crazy Horse sounding very loose and ragged. The songs continued to
be poor, anil his voice was as pitiable as ever.
Young has now released Zumu, and the singing remains wretched.
Crazy Horse's playing is as ragged as it was on Tonight's the Night —
Young has'really succeeded in turning it into a garage band.
Young himself takes up lead guitar again, but his playing is cautious
compared to the guts and frenzy displayed on Everybody Knows This
Is Nowhere, with his sudden fast bursts.
His lyrics and music on Zumu (and on the previous two albums) is
about as inspired as his voice. His words have lost their poetic quality,
are often quite unprofound, and sometimes vague-without-being
mysterious. Now and then he has something interesting to say. but
such moments are rare.
One good song
Zumu contains exactly one good song, an acoustic number called
"Pardon My Heart." It's melody is based on the pretty three-chord
pattern used in The Grateful Dead's rendition of "Know You Rider."
The pace of "Pardon My Heart" is slow and very similar to "The Old
Laughing Lady" from his first solo album.
The lyrics are a lament of a love gone bad: "it's a sad
communication/when one isn't giving/and one pretends to receive,"
but one which the singer isn't quite prepared to give up: "you brought
it all on/but it feels so wrong/no, no, don't believe this song."
Two epics
Zumu contains two "epics," i.e. long songs. "Danger Bird" and
"Cortez the Killer" are bores. "Danger Bird" is a straight steal of the
chord-pattern and pace of Robin Trower's "Hannah." The lyrics are
vague, and much of the singing is buried beneath the instruments.
"Cortez the Killer" is one of the slowest songs Young has ever
played. The story is a scattered narrative about the beauty of the
Aztecs and their cultural rape by Cortez and his men.
The album's last song is an acoustic washout called "Through My
Sails" that features Crosby. Stills & Nash on backup vocal. It is easily
the worst C-S-N-Y harmony arrangement ever recorded — though
they didn't have much of a song to work with
Nobody in their right mind should buy Zumu. If you're curious
about it, check out the I'M radio stations, who are already playing it
more than it deserves.
