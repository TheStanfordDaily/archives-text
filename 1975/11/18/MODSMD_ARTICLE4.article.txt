# How to choose the perfect stereo
## 
### JOHN GARLICH 
Stereo has become a more im
portant part of everyone's lives,
and any time that interest picks up
in a profitable field, manufactur
ers rush to introduce new lines
boasting "state of the art" equip
ment. Through the maze of con
flicting reports, specifications
and advertisements the consumer
is asked to choose his ultimate
system.
There are three types of systems
which the buyer can select. The
compacts are those systems com
bining a changer, AM/FM receiver
and usually an eight-track tape
player in an all-in-one console.
Generally, two small speakers
are included, sometimes being di
rectly connected to the unit, other
times separate.
These systems range in price
from $150-$4OO and generally
produce music about as well as a
nice car stereo. They provide
sound but are not intended for the
perfectionist.
Service problems
Buyers should avoid these sys
tems due to inherent service prob
lems. If one piece goes bad your
whole system is in the shop. For a
little more money one can get into
components that are better made
and sound a lot better.
This brings us to the inter
mediate stage of equipment.
These systems range in price from
$400-$2OOO. This gear is the most
heavily advertised and conse
quently is considered by most
people as the "hot" equipment.
The name brands are many:
Pioneer, Sherwood. Sony, Har
mon Kardon, Kenwood, Altec, Bic
Venturi and so on.
Because of the price range, most
buyers start with these systems —
and it is in this area that people

make their mistake. How should
the buyer choose his equipment?
Stereo stores
Part of the problem are the
stereo stores. Most shops sell by
first demonstrating the big name
receivers followed by comparing
speakers and then the turntable or
cassette deck.
This is backwards in some re
spects. The pieces of equipment
that are most influential in affect
ing the sound are the cartridge
and the speakers. (The cartridge is
often incorrectly referred to as the
"needle.")
Unfortunately the cartridge is
often neglected and "thrown in
with the deal." Yet along with
speakers they produce the most
marked change in sound. Choos
ing a cartridge from specifications
is next to useless. All cartridges
will claim to reproduce the audi
ble spectrum with no problems.
However, even though
"specifications" will be the same,
sound is quite different. How do
you find out which cartridge to
choose? You listen.
Esoteric gear
Stores catering to the more
esoteric expensive gear will often
have a turntable with two or three
tone arms. Using this technique
you can flip a switch to hear one
cartridge and then another.
A simpler method is to set up
two turntables (preferably the
same) and play the same album
simultaneously. You'll hear the
difference.
Best bets are the B&O MMC
6000 ($100), ADC SL,M II or the
Sonus ($100), the B&P SPI2 ($B5)
and any of a number of cartridges
such as Shure Staton. or Ortofon
that list for about $75.
If you want a good inexpensive
cartridge that is durable, the
Shure M 95 ED is okay.

' But why save money on a car
tridge? For another $25 to $50 yoi
can improve your system 100
percent!
Turntables are the next selec
tion. Here again most stereo deal
ers mislead the public. Rumble,
wow and flutter are problems that
are given much attention and con
sequently it is in these areas that
the vast majority of turntables
excel.
As long as these criteria are
satisfied so that they are in the in
audible range, the most important
feature is the tone arm.
Low mass of the tone arm is a
must for good cartridges and good
tracking, whether or not the stylus
("needle") can follow the record's
groove.
Changers are usually a waste of
money as few people will stack
their records.
Superior names
Either the Phillips 212 ($200) or
the B&O 3000 ($300), which in
cludes an excellent cartridge, are
far superior to the Duals and Gar
rards — the so called top lines. In
fact, Dual and Garrard have a
much higher mark-up and that is
often where most of your "dis
count" comes from.
Receivers are next. Don't pay a
lot of money for lots of power. The
reason for the power is to allow
you to play speakers at high vol
ume with little distortion.
Most speakers today only re
quire 10-15 watts of power at
normal listening levels. You
should probably want between 20
and 35 watts RMS per channel.
If your speakers require more
power thanthis, they probably are
in the audiophile (stereo de
votees) class and cost between
$600-$2OOO.
Up until very recently, most
name brand receivers were basi

cally the same. Sony has just come
out with a new type of transistor
that is a relative breakthrough.
It lias the capability of "surg
ing", i.e., it will flow with the
music in order to hold down dis
tortion.
This is an oversimplification of
their VFET transistor yet de
scribes its function.
Another new breakthrough is
Harman Kardon's receiver line
which has very low distortion rat
ings and can reproduce sine and
square wave (sound spectra) like
amplifiers four or five times the
price.
Speaker specifications
The Harmon Kardon 4308 or
the 3308 are probably the best re
ceivers as the Sony is still rela
tively new.
Speakers should only be picked
through listening
tests.Specifications are only a
check to make sure they are not
terrible. From there you rely on
your ear.
But many people don't know
what to listen for. Big bass ends
with large woofers and high harsh
tweeters are often pushed on the
public as the "hot equipment."
Reproduce sound
Speakers are supposed to re
produce sound. not color it. When
comparing speakers volume
levels must be the same. If a pi irof
speakers is louder than the other it
will sound "better." If volume
levels are not equal you cannot
fairly compare them.

An excellent test is to hook up a
microphone into the system and
have a friend alternately talking
into the mike and away from it,
through thespeakersand "live." If
the voice sounds too bassy, or
"warm" or too high and "harsh"
the speaker colors the sound.
The reason for accurate repro
duction without the boomy bass
or the harsh highs is listener
fatigue. Over playing the music
which once sounded so good will
begin to irritate until you finally
turn the stereo off.
The Epicure (not EPI)
l()s($109 a piece) or the Avid
103s. ($165 a piece) are good buys.
Discounts
As far as "discounts" you will
find the greatest savings in sys
tems prices — buy aquantityof
goods and get the best deal. The
biggest discounts are on selected
systems where the dealer can
match his highest profit-margin
equipment together.
You cannot outwit the dealer —
he knows his cost and conse
quently will offer you deals in
conjunction with a percentage of
profit he wants. You might get
more monev off fine piece of
equipment because it has a lower
cost (and probably is not as good)
but the percentage of profit will be
the same.
Volume buying gets the best
deals. Even the non-discounted
equipment, generally the finer
equipment, can be obtained at re
duced prices if bought in quan
tities.

goods and get the best deal. The
biggest discounts are on selected
systems where the dealer can

You cannot outwit the dealer —
he knows his cost and conse

it makes sense to thoroughly check them out before forking over the bucks.

LISTEN IN — Headphones are just one of the many accessories
that can he purchased with the rest of the equipment.
Stereo has become a more im
portant part of everyone's lives,
and any time that interest picks up
in a profitable field, manufactur
ers rush to introduce new lines
boasting "state of the art" equip
ment. Through the maze of con
flicting reports, specifications
and advertisements the consumer
is asked to choose his ultimate
system.
There are three types of systems
which the buyer can select. The
compacts are those systems com
bining a changer, AM/FM receiver
and usually an eight-track tape
player in an all-in-one console.
Generally, two small speakers
are included, sometimes being di
rectly connected to the unit, other
times separate.
These systems range in price
from $150-$4OO and generally
produce music about as well as a
nice car stereo. They provide
sound but are not intended for the
perfectionist.
Service problems
Buyers should avoid these sys
tems due to inherent service prob
lems. If one piece goes bad your
whole system is in the shop. For a
little more money one can get into
components that are better made
and sound a lot better.
This brings us to the inter
mediate stage of equipment.
These systems range in price from
$400-$2OOO. This gear is the most
heavily advertised and conse
quently is considered by most
people as the "hot" equipment.
The name brands are many:
Pioneer, Sherwood. Sony, Har
mon Kardon, Kenwood, Altec, Bic
Venturi and so on.
Because of the price range, most
buyers start with these systems —
and it is in this area that people

make their mistake. How should
the buyer choose his equipment?
Stereo stores
Part of the problem are the
stereo stores. Most shops sell by
first demonstrating the big name
receivers followed by comparing
speakers and then the turntable or
cassette deck.
This is backwards in some re
spects. The pieces of equipment
that are most influential in affect
ing the sound are the cartridge
and the speakers. (The cartridge is
often incorrectly referred to as the
"needle.")
Unfortunately the cartridge is
often neglected and "thrown in
with the deal." Yet along with
speakers they produce the most
marked change in sound. Choos
ing a cartridge from specifications
is next to useless. All cartridges
will claim to reproduce the audi
ble spectrum with no problems.
However, even though
"specifications" will be the same,
sound is quite different. How do
you find out which cartridge to
choose? You listen.
Esoteric gear
Stores catering to the more
esoteric expensive gear will often
have a turntable with two or three
tone arms. Using this technique
you can flip a switch to hear one
cartridge and then another.
A simpler method is to set up
two turntables (preferably the
same) and play the same album
simultaneously. You'll hear the
difference.
Best bets are the B&O MMC
6000 ($100), ADC SL,M II or the
Sonus ($100), the B&P SPI2 ($B5)
and any of a number of cartridges
such as Shure Staton. or Ortofon
that list for about $75.
If you want a good inexpensive
cartridge that is durable, the
Shure M 95 ED is okay.

' But why save money on a car
tridge? For another $25 to $50 yoi
can improve your system 100
percent!
Turntables are the next selec
tion. Here again most stereo deal
ers mislead the public. Rumble,
wow and flutter are problems that
are given much attention and con
sequently it is in these areas that
the vast majority of turntables
excel.
As long as these criteria are
satisfied so that they are in the in
audible range, the most important
feature is the tone arm.
Low mass of the tone arm is a
must for good cartridges and good
tracking, whether or not the stylus
("needle") can follow the record's
groove.
Changers are usually a waste of
money as few people will stack
their records.
Superior names
Either the Phillips 212 ($200) or
the B&O 3000 ($300), which in
cludes an excellent cartridge, are
far superior to the Duals and Gar
rards — the so called top lines. In
fact, Dual and Garrard have a
much higher mark-up and that is
often where most of your "dis
count" comes from.
Receivers are next. Don't pay a
lot of money for lots of power. The
reason for the power is to allow
you to play speakers at high vol
ume with little distortion.
Most speakers today only re
quire 10-15 watts of power at
normal listening levels. You
should probably want between 20
and 35 watts RMS per channel.
If your speakers require more
power thanthis, they probably are
in the audiophile (stereo de
votees) class and cost between
$600-$2OOO.
Up until very recently, most
name brand receivers were basi

cally the same. Sony has just come
out with a new type of transistor
that is a relative breakthrough.
It lias the capability of "surg
ing", i.e., it will flow with the
music in order to hold down dis
tortion.
This is an oversimplification of
their VFET transistor yet de
scribes its function.
Another new breakthrough is
Harman Kardon's receiver line
which has very low distortion rat
ings and can reproduce sine and
square wave (sound spectra) like
amplifiers four or five times the
price.
Speaker specifications
The Harmon Kardon 4308 or
the 3308 are probably the best re
ceivers as the Sony is still rela
tively new.
Speakers should only be picked
through listening
tests.Specifications are only a
check to make sure they are not
terrible. From there you rely on
your ear.
But many people don't know
what to listen for. Big bass ends
with large woofers and high harsh
tweeters are often pushed on the
public as the "hot equipment."
Reproduce sound
Speakers are supposed to re
produce sound. not color it. When
comparing speakers volume
levels must be the same. If a pi irof
speakers is louder than the other it
will sound "better." If volume
levels are not equal you cannot
fairly compare them.

An excellent test is to hook up a
microphone into the system and
have a friend alternately talking
into the mike and away from it,
through thespeakersand "live." If
the voice sounds too bassy, or
"warm" or too high and "harsh"
the speaker colors the sound.
The reason for accurate repro
duction without the boomy bass
or the harsh highs is listener
fatigue. Over playing the music
which once sounded so good will
begin to irritate until you finally
turn the stereo off.
The Epicure (not EPI)
l()s($109 a piece) or the Avid
103s. ($165 a piece) are good buys.

it makes sense to thoroughly check them out before forking over the bucks.

LISTEN IN — Headphones are just one of the many accessories
that can he purchased with the rest of the equipment.
Stereo has become a more im
portant part of everyone's lives,
and any time that interest picks up
in a profitable field, manufactur
ers rush to introduce new lines
boasting "state of the art" equip
ment. Through the maze of con
flicting reports, specifications
and advertisements the consumer
is asked to choose his ultimate
system.
There are three types of systems
which the buyer can select. The
compacts are those systems com
bining a changer, AM/FM receiver
and usually an eight-track tape
player in an all-in-one console.
Generally, two small speakers
are included, sometimes being di
rectly connected to the unit, other
times separate.
These systems range in price
from $150-$4OO and generally
produce music about as well as a
nice car stereo. They provide
sound but are not intended for the
perfectionist.
Service problems
Buyers should avoid these sys
tems due to inherent service prob
lems. If one piece goes bad your
whole system is in the shop. For a
little more money one can get into
components that are better made
and sound a lot better.
This brings us to the inter
mediate stage of equipment.
These systems range in price from
$400-$2OOO. This gear is the most
heavily advertised and conse
quently is considered by most
people as the "hot" equipment.
The name brands are many:
Pioneer, Sherwood. Sony, Har
mon Kardon, Kenwood, Altec, Bic
Venturi and so on.
Because of the price range, most
buyers start with these systems —
and it is in this area that people

make their mistake. How should
the buyer choose his equipment?
Stereo stores
Part of the problem are the
stereo stores. Most shops sell by
first demonstrating the big name
receivers followed by comparing
speakers and then the turntable or
cassette deck.
This is backwards in some re
spects. The pieces of equipment
that are most influential in affect
ing the sound are the cartridge
and the speakers. (The cartridge is
often incorrectly referred to as the
"needle.")
Unfortunately the cartridge is
often neglected and "thrown in
with the deal." Yet along with
speakers they produce the most
marked change in sound. Choos
ing a cartridge from specifications
is next to useless. All cartridges
will claim to reproduce the audi
ble spectrum with no problems.
However, even though
"specifications" will be the same,
sound is quite different. How do
you find out which cartridge to
choose? You listen.
Esoteric gear
Stores catering to the more
esoteric expensive gear will often
have a turntable with two or three
tone arms. Using this technique
you can flip a switch to hear one
cartridge and then another.
A simpler method is to set up
two turntables (preferably the
same) and play the same album
simultaneously. You'll hear the
difference.
Best bets are the B&O MMC
6000 ($100), ADC SL,M II or the
Sonus ($100), the B&P SPI2 ($B5)
and any of a number of cartridges
such as Shure Staton. or Ortofon
that list for about $75.
If you want a good inexpensive
cartridge that is durable, the
Shure M 95 ED is okay.

' But why save money on a car
tridge? For another $25 to $50 yoi
can improve your system 100
percent!
Turntables are the next selec
tion. Here again most stereo deal
ers mislead the public. Rumble,
wow and flutter are problems that
are given much attention and con
sequently it is in these areas that
the vast majority of turntables
excel.
As long as these criteria are
satisfied so that they are in the in
audible range, the most important
feature is the tone arm.
Low mass of the tone arm is a
must for good cartridges and good
tracking, whether or not the stylus
("needle") can follow the record's
groove.
Changers are usually a waste of
money as few people will stack
their records.
Superior names
Either the Phillips 212 ($200) or
the B&O 3000 ($300), which in
cludes an excellent cartridge, are
far superior to the Duals and Gar
rards — the so called top lines. In
fact, Dual and Garrard have a
much higher mark-up and that is
often where most of your "dis
count" comes from.
Receivers are next. Don't pay a
lot of money for lots of power. The
reason for the power is to allow
you to play speakers at high vol
ume with little distortion.
Most speakers today only re
quire 10-15 watts of power at
normal listening levels. You
should probably want between 20
and 35 watts RMS per channel.
If your speakers require more
power thanthis, they probably are
in the audiophile (stereo de
votees) class and cost between
$600-$2OOO.
Up until very recently, most
name brand receivers were basi

cally the same. Sony has just come
out with a new type of transistor
that is a relative breakthrough.
It lias the capability of "surg
ing", i.e., it will flow with the
music in order to hold down dis
tortion.
This is an oversimplification of
their VFET transistor yet de
scribes its function.
Another new breakthrough is
Harman Kardon's receiver line
which has very low distortion rat
ings and can reproduce sine and
square wave (sound spectra) like
amplifiers four or five times the
price.
Speaker specifications
The Harmon Kardon 4308 or
the 3308 are probably the best re
ceivers as the Sony is still rela
tively new.
Speakers should only be picked
through listening
tests.Specifications are only a
check to make sure they are not
terrible. From there you rely on
your ear.
But many people don't know
what to listen for. Big bass ends
with large woofers and high harsh
tweeters are often pushed on the
public as the "hot equipment."
Reproduce sound
Speakers are supposed to re

Speaker specifications
The Harmon Kardon 4308 or
the 3308 are probably the best re
ceivers as the Sony is still rela
tively new.
Speakers should only be picked
through listening
tests.Specifications are only a
check to make sure they are not
terrible. From there you rely on
your ear.
But many people don't know
what to listen for. Big bass ends
with large woofers and high harsh
tweeters are often pushed on the
public as the "hot equipment."
Reproduce sound
Speakers are supposed to re
produce sound. not color it. When
comparing speakers volume
levels must be the same. If a pi irof
speakers is louder than the other it
will sound "better." If volume
levels are not equal you cannot
fairly compare them.

An excellent test is to hook up a
microphone into the system and
have a friend alternately talking
into the mike and away from it,
through thespeakersand "live." If
the voice sounds too bassy, or
"warm" or too high and "harsh"
the speaker colors the sound.
The reason for accurate repro
duction without the boomy bass
or the harsh highs is listener
fatigue. Over playing the music
which once sounded so good will
begin to irritate until you finally
turn the stereo off.

As far as "discounts" you will

biggest discounts are on selected
systems where the dealer can

You cannot outwit the dealer —
he knows his cost and conse

STEREO EVERYWHERE — There are a multitude of names and types of equipment on the markrt, and
it makes sense to thoroughly check them out before forking over the bucks.

LISTEN IN — Headphones are just one of the many accessories
that can he purchased with the rest of the equipment.
Stereo has become a more im
portant part of everyone's lives,
and any time that interest picks up
in a profitable field, manufactur
ers rush to introduce new lines
boasting "state of the art" equip
ment. Through the maze of con
flicting reports, specifications
and advertisements the consumer
is asked to choose his ultimate
system.
There are three types of systems
which the buyer can select. The
compacts are those systems com
bining a changer, AM/FM receiver
and usually an eight-track tape
player in an all-in-one console.
Generally, two small speakers
are included, sometimes being di
rectly connected to the unit, other
times separate.
These systems range in price
from $150-$4OO and generally
produce music about as well as a
nice car stereo. They provide
sound but are not intended for the
perfectionist.
Service problems
Buyers should avoid these sys
tems due to inherent service prob
lems. If one piece goes bad your
whole system is in the shop. For a
little more money one can get into
components that are better made
and sound a lot better.
This brings us to the inter
mediate stage of equipment.
These systems range in price from
$400-$2OOO. This gear is the most
heavily advertised and conse
quently is considered by most
people as the "hot" equipment.
The name brands are many:
Pioneer, Sherwood. Sony, Har
mon Kardon, Kenwood, Altec, Bic
Venturi and so on.
Because of the price range, most
buyers start with these systems —
and it is in this area that people

make their mistake. How should
the buyer choose his equipment?
Stereo stores
Part of the problem are the
stereo stores. Most shops sell by
first demonstrating the big name
receivers followed by comparing
speakers and then the turntable or
cassette deck.
This is backwards in some re
spects. The pieces of equipment
that are most influential in affect
ing the sound are the cartridge
and the speakers. (The cartridge is
often incorrectly referred to as the
"needle.")
Unfortunately the cartridge is
often neglected and "thrown in
with the deal." Yet along with
speakers they produce the most
marked change in sound. Choos
ing a cartridge from specifications
is next to useless. All cartridges
will claim to reproduce the audi
ble spectrum with no problems.
However, even though
"specifications" will be the same,
sound is quite different. How do
you find out which cartridge to
choose? You listen.
Esoteric gear
Stores catering to the more
esoteric expensive gear will often
have a turntable with two or three
tone arms. Using this technique
you can flip a switch to hear one
cartridge and then another.
A simpler method is to set up
two turntables (preferably the
same) and play the same album
simultaneously. You'll hear the
difference.
Best bets are the B&O MMC
6000 ($100), ADC SL,M II or the
Sonus ($100), the B&P SPI2 ($B5)
and any of a number of cartridges
such as Shure Staton. or Ortofon
that list for about $75.
If you want a good inexpensive
cartridge that is durable, the
Shure M 95 ED is okay.

' But why save money on a car
tridge? For another $25 to $50 yoi
can improve your system 100
percent!
Turntables are the next selec
tion. Here again most stereo deal
ers mislead the public. Rumble,
wow and flutter are problems that
are given much attention and con
sequently it is in these areas that
the vast majority of turntables
excel.
As long as these criteria are
satisfied so that they are in the in
audible range, the most important
feature is the tone arm.
Low mass of the tone arm is a
must for good cartridges and good
tracking, whether or not the stylus
("needle") can follow the record's
groove.
Changers are usually a waste of
money as few people will stack
their records.
Superior names
Either the Phillips 212 ($200) or
the B&O 3000 ($300), which in
cludes an excellent cartridge, are
far superior to the Duals and Gar
rards — the so called top lines. In
fact, Dual and Garrard have a
much higher mark-up and that is
often where most of your "dis
count" comes from.
Receivers are next. Don't pay a
lot of money for lots of power. The
reason for the power is to allow
you to play speakers at high vol
ume with little distortion.
Most speakers today only re
quire 10-15 watts of power at
normal listening levels. You
should probably want between 20
and 35 watts RMS per channel.
If your speakers require more
power thanthis, they probably are
in the audiophile (stereo de
votees) class and cost between
$600-$2OOO.
Up until very recently, most
name brand receivers were basi

cally the same. Sony has just come
out with a new type of transistor
that is a relative breakthrough.
It lias the capability of "surg
ing", i.e., it will flow with the
music in order to hold down dis
tortion.
This is an oversimplification of
their VFET transistor yet de
