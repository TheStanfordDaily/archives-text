Puy-o-lu: A secret or private
payment for the promotion of a
pro(Ju( (. sun ice. ate., through tha
abuse of one's position, influence,
or facilities.
In 15)74 the record ;md tape in
dustry accounted tor over two hill
ion dollars in sales — more in
come than movies and sports
events combined. Two billion dol
lars in an industry that, through
mergers and consolidations, is be
coming increasingly monolithic,
with more control being exercised
by a handful of record companies.
Uy competing with each other,
they compete for one thing — air
play on AM and I'M stations ac
ross the country. Without airplay,
a record's chances for successful
sales are almost non-existent.
Airplay is critical for the intro
duction of new artists, and the
continued sales of established ar
tists.
To get airplay, record com
panies rely upon promotion,

which includes payola. The
front-line troops of the record
companies are the promotional
men (and women) who are re
sponsible lor getting their com
panies' product into the radio sta
tions in their areas, as well as
prominent display in key record
stores.
The legal tools to help in their
endeavors are posters, free promo
tional copies to the music director
and (if the station/market is big
enough) the air staff.
Also legal are "gifts" such as
tree patches, key rings, concert
tickets and tee-shirts promoting
the artist in question.
Columbia records has budgeted
over $ 150,000 to promote Bruce
Springsteen's Born To Hun LP,
with favorable results. This is the
first level of promotion.
Level two is the follow-up cam
paign, ads in the trade papers
(Billboard, Cashbox, Record
World) and in publications such
as Boiling Stone and Cream.

The combined effect of airplay
and promotion is to (in theory)
start a snowball effect, with the
record gaining more momentum,
increasing sales and higher and
higher chart positions.
In other words, a hit.
There is only one problem.
Billboard, the number-one chart
newspaper, receives in a week be
tween 55 and 80 LPs just for re
view. Forty-fives are put out in
quantities of 8000 per year.
With the average top 40 stations
down to a playlist of 30 songs
(some like WABC-AM, New York,
are down to a playlist of 15 songs)
the odds are long indeed of break
ing into the top 100.
Odds reduced
The odds are further reduced
when one realizes that on any
given week a station will receive
20 to 25 LPs and 25 to 30 45s and
that the music director (unless he
is a superman) doesn't have time
to review each and every LP and
45.
The music directors of many
stations are just one of the jocks
with a title, overworked and un
derpaid; the main reason they are
music directors is because they
have been there longer than any
one else. They may know very lit
tle of music, its roots, history or
background.
Since they don't have the time
or the experience, directors must
rely upon the charts and various
tip sheets (Bill Gavin out of San
Francisco is regarded as one of the
best) to determine what records
will beadded toreceiveairplay on
their stations.
In order to get airplay across the

country, a record company needs
only to get airplay on a few major
stations in the lop markets.
Snowball effect
This will create the snowball ef
fect, with the other stations in
other markets jumping on the
bandwagon once a record has
been broken in the top markets
and deemed a "hit."
So, in reality exposure in the
top-10 markets will serve to ex
pose most of the remaining mar
kets in the country.
In the past years, however, a
new factor has been added intothe
promotion business.
With rising costs of groups,
equipment, management, sec
urity,etc..many concert halls have
either closed (Fillmore East and
West) or converted into discos,
where the major costs are fixed,
and one-shot (permits, lights,
sound equipment, etc.).
Disco entertainment
The emergence of the disco as a
main source of entertainment has
in turn resulted in some records
receiving play first in discos and
then crossing over into radio airp
lay.
"In New York, as many as
20,000 (records) go to a single
disco in a week," reports Rolling

Stone.
Unlike radio stations, discos arc
not licensed by the FCC and are,
therefore, not regulated by payola
laws. A disco receives promo
copies 112 rom the record companies,
and since there arc usually only
two to three people responsible
for the music, the temptation to
ofter these people payola is
enormous.
I.egal payola
No story would be complete
without mention of Clive Davis,
past president of Columbia Re
cords ($.140 million in sales in
1972. 22 percent of the U.S. rock
market), current president of
Arista (formerly Bell) Records.
Clive was fired by CBS in May.
1973 for allegedly misusing
$94,000 in company money.
The main charge of payola was
left for a grand jury to decide. At
this writing the jury hasn't
even decided whether to call
upon Davis as a witness, let
alone decide whether payola was
involved at CBS.
To take the air staff in a major
market to dinner and charge it to
the company's expense account is
not only payola, but a common
business practice, perfectly legal
in every sense of the word.
