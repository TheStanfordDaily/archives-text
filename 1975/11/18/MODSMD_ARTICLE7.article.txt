# Elton John has a funky new group
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
1 le's famous in the rock world for his outrageous
sequined costumes and super-high platform
shoes. He owns over 200 pairs of glasses (worth
over $40,000), including a pair that has battery
operated miniature windshield wipers. In concert,
he's known for his high-stepping antics including
playing with his feet and jumping and dancing on
top of the piano.
But he says he wants to change all that.
To "tone down the flamboyance" multimil
lionaire pianist-composer Elton John has aban
doned some of his more gaudy outfits, engaged
himself in sports (notably tennis and soccer) and
taken up direction of his fledgling record com
pany, Rocket Records.
And along with his "new" image, Elton has a
new band.
Not much difference
At first glance, Elton's new band doesn't seem
that much different from his old one. Lyricist Ber
nie Taupin (Elton's partner in 11 platinum albums
and six gold singles) is still cranking out verseafter
verse. Guitarist Davey Johnstone, perhaps one of
the most underrated lead guitars in the business, is
still there, as is percussionist Ray Cooper.
Two of the new band's members, guitarist Caleb
Quaye and drummer Roger Pope have cut several
albums with Elton in his early days; so they're not
unfamiliar to the "EJ" sound. Bassist Ken Pas
sarelli replaces Dee Murray and new keyboard
man james Newton Howard fills in with electric
piano and synthesizer (parts that Elton himself
used to play).
What's different is the band's feel — it's more
kick-ass with a heavier rock emphasis and back
beat. Elton's new seven-piece band is stronger:
meatier guitar riffs, louder percussion, the flexibil
ity of two keyboards.
On Elton's current tour. "Rock of the Westies,"
he and his band have won both popular and criti
cal acclaim. The tour has been sold out without
advertising in each of the 15 cities scheduled.
'Impeccable' sound
And Rolling Stone's Ben Edmonds described the
band's sound in concert as "impeccable. They
generated a sound big enough to match the
stadium proportions of Elton's stardom."
The question remains, will Elton change his
music along with his changes in image and sup
porting musicians?
The answer lies in the album Rock of the
Westies. which has so far received mixed reviews.

The name Rock of (he Westies should be taken
literally; that is, the album's basic fare is heavy,
driving rock.
And the album's emphasis on rock may signal a
new phase in Elton's career. In his six years as a
solo artist, Elton has switched from a contempla
tive, folk-song style (Elton |ohn, Ttimhleiveed
Connection, Madman Across the Water) to his
well-received honky style (Honky Chateau) to a
mish-mash of gimmick songs ("Bennie and the
Jets" and "Island Girl"), introspective songs
("Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy")
and harder rock ("Saturday Night's Alright tor
Fighting" and "Bitch is Back").
Rock for fun
No longer in music for the money (he's loaded),
no longer climbing the ladder of rock superstar
dom (he's at the top), Elton may be ready to do just
what he wants to do. rock — for the fun of it.
John himself admitted to Rolling Stone this
summer that he dropped long-time associates
Nigel Olsson (drums) and Dee Murray (bass) to
give his band a more "funky" sound.
Olsson's and Murray's replacements are impor
tant signs of change. The two sidemen had been
with Elton almost from the beginning and they
comprised his only backup during his first full
blown American tour in 1970.
Admittedly, however, the band sounds funkier
without Olsson's intricate,stylized drumming and
without Murray's slower, more deliberate bass
work.
Musical criticism
Elton has drawn criticism that he sold his audi
ence out by producing mediocre, middle-of-the
road, commercial rock on Hock of the Westies,
while waiting for the royalties to roll in. (See the
Daily review by Peter Kretzman in the Oct. 30 issue
of Spectrum.)
Elton offers a response in People Magazine:
"(Criticism) is one of the things that made success
difficult for me to adjust to emotionally. But I'm
immune to criticism now. Besides, I like that term
(middle-of-the-road). It means my music appeals
to a wide variety of people, which is what's impor
tant."
And this hard rock style may be the last phase of
Elton's star-studded career. He's just about done
everything in music — and he is philosophical
about his career:
"I can only do this for so long, you know. 1 don't
feature myself singing 'Crocodile Rock' when I'm
34."

The name Rock of (he Westies should be taken
literally; that is, the album's basic fare is heavy,
driving rock.
And the album's emphasis on rock may signal a
new phase in Elton's career. In his six years as a
solo artist, Elton has switched from a contempla
tive, folk-song style (Elton |ohn, Ttimhleiveed
Connection, Madman Across the Water) to his
well-received honky style (Honky Chateau) to a
mish-mash of gimmick songs ("Bennie and the
Jets" and "Island Girl"), introspective songs
("Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy")
and harder rock ("Saturday Night's Alright tor
Fighting" and "Bitch is Back").
Rock for fun
No longer in music for the money (he's loaded),
no longer climbing the ladder of rock superstar
dom (he's at the top), Elton may be ready to do just
what he wants to do. rock — for the fun of it.
John himself admitted to Rolling Stone this
summer that he dropped long-time associates
Nigel Olsson (drums) and Dee Murray (bass) to
give his band a more "funky" sound.
Olsson's and Murray's replacements are impor
tant signs of change. The two sidemen had been
with Elton almost from the beginning and they
comprised his only backup during his first full
blown American tour in 1970.
Admittedly, however, the band sounds funkier
without Olsson's intricate,stylized drumming and
without Murray's slower, more deliberate bass
work.
Musical criticism
Elton has drawn criticism that he sold his audi
ence out by producing mediocre, middle-of-the
road, commercial rock on Hock of the Westies,
while waiting for the royalties to roll in. (See the
Daily review by Peter Kretzman in the Oct. 30 issue
of Spectrum.)
Elton offers a response in People Magazine:
"(Criticism) is one of the things that made success
difficult for me to adjust to emotionally. But I'm
immune to criticism now. Besides, I like that term
(middle-of-the-road). It means my music appeals
to a wide variety of people, which is what's impor
tant."
And this hard rock style may be the last phase of
Elton's star-studded career. He's just about done
everything in music — and he is philosophical
about his career:
"I can only do this for so long, you know. 1 don't
feature myself singing 'Crocodile Rock' when I'm
34."

Elton John's funky new group


Elton John
1 le's famous in the rock world for his outrageous
sequined costumes and super-high platform
shoes. He owns over 200 pairs of glasses (worth
over $40,000), including a pair that has battery
operated miniature windshield wipers. In concert,
he's known for his high-stepping antics including
playing with his feet and jumping and dancing on
top of the piano.
But he says he wants to change all that.
To "tone down the flamboyance" multimil
lionaire pianist-composer Elton John has aban
doned some of his more gaudy outfits, engaged
himself in sports (notably tennis and soccer) and
taken up direction of his fledgling record com
pany, Rocket Records.
And along with his "new" image, Elton has a
new band.
Not much difference
At first glance, Elton's new band doesn't seem
that much different from his old one. Lyricist Ber
nie Taupin (Elton's partner in 11 platinum albums
and six gold singles) is still cranking out verseafter
verse. Guitarist Davey Johnstone, perhaps one of
the most underrated lead guitars in the business, is
still there, as is percussionist Ray Cooper.
Two of the new band's members, guitarist Caleb
Quaye and drummer Roger Pope have cut several
albums with Elton in his early days; so they're not
unfamiliar to the "EJ" sound. Bassist Ken Pas
sarelli replaces Dee Murray and new keyboard
man james Newton Howard fills in with electric
piano and synthesizer (parts that Elton himself
used to play).
What's different is the band's feel — it's more
kick-ass with a heavier rock emphasis and back
beat. Elton's new seven-piece band is stronger:
meatier guitar riffs, louder percussion, the flexibil
ity of two keyboards.
On Elton's current tour. "Rock of the Westies,"
he and his band have won both popular and criti
cal acclaim. The tour has been sold out without
advertising in each of the 15 cities scheduled.
'Impeccable' sound
And Rolling Stone's Ben Edmonds described the
band's sound in concert as "impeccable. They
generated a sound big enough to match the
stadium proportions of Elton's stardom."
The question remains, will Elton change his
music along with his changes in image and sup
porting musicians?
The answer lies in the album Rock of the

Elton John's funky new group


Elton John
1 le's famous in the rock world for his outrageous
sequined costumes and super-high platform
shoes. He owns over 200 pairs of glasses (worth
over $40,000), including a pair that has battery
operated miniature windshield wipers. In concert,
he's known for his high-stepping antics including
playing with his feet and jumping and dancing on
top of the piano.
But he says he wants to change all that.
To "tone down the flamboyance" multimil
lionaire pianist-composer Elton John has aban
doned some of his more gaudy outfits, engaged
himself in sports (notably tennis and soccer) and
taken up direction of his fledgling record com
pany, Rocket Records.
And along with his "new" image, Elton has a
new band.
Not much difference
At first glance, Elton's new band doesn't seem
that much different from his old one. Lyricist Ber
nie Taupin (Elton's partner in 11 platinum albums
and six gold singles) is still cranking out verseafter
verse. Guitarist Davey Johnstone, perhaps one of
the most underrated lead guitars in the business, is
still there, as is percussionist Ray Cooper.
Two of the new band's members, guitarist Caleb
Quaye and drummer Roger Pope have cut several
albums with Elton in his early days; so they're not
unfamiliar to the "EJ" sound. Bassist Ken Pas
sarelli replaces Dee Murray and new keyboard
man james Newton Howard fills in with electric
piano and synthesizer (parts that Elton himself
used to play).
What's different is the band's feel — it's more
kick-ass with a heavier rock emphasis and back
beat. Elton's new seven-piece band is stronger:
meatier guitar riffs, louder percussion, the flexibil
ity of two keyboards.
On Elton's current tour. "Rock of the Westies,"
he and his band have won both popular and criti
cal acclaim. The tour has been sold out without
advertising in each of the 15 cities scheduled.
'Impeccable' sound
And Rolling Stone's Ben Edmonds described the
band's sound in concert as "impeccable. They
generated a sound big enough to match the
stadium proportions of Elton's stardom."
The question remains, will Elton change his
music along with his changes in image and sup
porting musicians?
The answer lies in the album Rock of the
Westies. which has so far received mixed reviews.

The name Rock of (he Westies should be taken
literally; that is, the album's basic fare is heavy,
driving rock.
And the album's emphasis on rock may signal a
new phase in Elton's career. In his six years as a
solo artist, Elton has switched from a contempla
tive, folk-song style (Elton |ohn, Ttimhleiveed
Connection, Madman Across the Water) to his
well-received honky style (Honky Chateau) to a
mish-mash of gimmick songs ("Bennie and the
Jets" and "Island Girl"), introspective songs
("Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy")
and harder rock ("Saturday Night's Alright tor
Fighting" and "Bitch is Back").
Rock for fun
No longer in music for the money (he's loaded),
no longer climbing the ladder of rock superstar
dom (he's at the top), Elton may be ready to do just
what he wants to do. rock — for the fun of it.
John himself admitted to Rolling Stone this
summer that he dropped long-time associates
Nigel Olsson (drums) and Dee Murray (bass) to
give his band a more "funky" sound.
Olsson's and Murray's replacements are impor
tant signs of change. The two sidemen had been
with Elton almost from the beginning and they
comprised his only backup during his first full
blown American tour in 1970.
Admittedly, however, the band sounds funkier
without Olsson's intricate,stylized drumming and
without Murray's slower, more deliberate bass
work.
Musical criticism
Elton has drawn criticism that he sold his audi
ence out by producing mediocre, middle-of-the
road, commercial rock on Hock of the Westies,
while waiting for the royalties to roll in. (See the
Daily review by Peter Kretzman in the Oct. 30 issue
of Spectrum.)
Elton offers a response in People Magazine:
"(Criticism) is one of the things that made success
difficult for me to adjust to emotionally. But I'm
immune to criticism now. Besides, I like that term
(middle-of-the-road). It means my music appeals
to a wide variety of people, which is what's impor
tant."
And this hard rock style may be the last phase of
Elton's star-studded career. He's just about done
everything in music — and he is philosophical
about his career:
"I can only do this for so long, you know. 1 don't
feature myself singing 'Crocodile Rock' when I'm
34."
