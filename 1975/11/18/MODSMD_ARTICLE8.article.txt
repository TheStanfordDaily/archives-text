# Local record stores: something for everyone
## 
### KATHY ROSS 
The Peninsula has never been
noted for its record stores, but be
tween the 10 or 12 stores in the
Stanford area, you're bound to be
able to find what you're looking
for.
Whether it's low prices, a
browsable atmosphere, easy ac
cessibility by bike, or a friendly
salesperson you're after, you can
get satisfaction: unless, of course,
you're looking for all of the above
in the same record store.
The following is a survey of
some of the more popular disc
shops around, which have been
visited incognito for a true feeling
of customer treatment and then
called by telephone for some addi
tional facts and figures.

BANANA RECORDS — 3159 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto. 493-1100.
Open Mon.-Fri. from 10-10, Sat.
from 10-9:30, and Sun. from
12-7:30.
The familiar oversized wooden
building block on El Camino may
have had you wondering how
anyone could breathe in there,
and more important, how there
could be room for much of a selec
tion. You might be pleasantly sur
prised, if you're brave enough to
venture inside the box.
The Banana has a cozy, personal
atmosphere and the salesperson is
usually willing to play any record
you want to preview before fork
ing over the bucks.
Specialty of the house is jazz,
although all types of music are av

ailable for a regular price of $4.99
($6.98 list). There's always a sale
of one sort or another, with prices
going down to $3.99, $3.66 and
even $3.58. Proximity to Stanford
is one of its advantages.
THE RECORD FACTORY — 1347
El Camino Real West, Mountain
View. 969-3582. Open
Sun.-Thurs. from 10-10, Fri. and
Sat. 10-12.
If you're willing to take a
15-minute drive south on El
Camino, the newest member of the
Record Factory chain is one of the
most pleasant and lowest priced
stores in the area.
Specializing in rock, the Fac
tory sells at an everyday price of
$4.98, but the sale price is the

lowest in Northern California:
$3.58. Tliere are always at least 50
LPs on sale including many new
releases and the store carries a
good variety of rock tee-shirts,
rock magazines and smoker's
goodies (including books on how
to grow your own).
The salespeople are friendly,
the sound system and acoustics
are great and the hanging ferns,
posters and nice carpeting com
bine to make the Record Factory a
perfect hangout for record store
freaks.
One warning though: the rules
about personal checks are very
rigid. A Stanford I.D. won't do.
You must have two credit cards in
addition to your driver's license,
and your local address must be

printed on the check. No excep
tions.
THE WHEREHOUSE — 1915 El
Camino Real, Mountain View.
961-9882. Open Mon.-Thurs. from
10-10, Fri. 10-12, Sat. 10-10, and
Sun. 10-8.
A few blocks closer to Stanford
is the Wherehouse, a large, well
stocked store fairly comparable to
the Record Factory (except in in
terior decor). The sales folks here
are excellent: they know their
stuff and are willing to help.
Best selections are rock and
classical.
There's not as .much soul, blues,
jazz, or imports as one might like,
but they have a very good selec
tion nonetheless.
The everyday price is up to
$4.96, due to what the manager
describes as record
manufacturer's inflation. Appa
rently, the vinyl used to make re
cords is an oil derivative, and
when oil prices went up, it indi
rectly affected record prices.
Sales at the Wherehouse give
the customer a good deal in spite
of inflation, with flexible prices
going down to a low of $3.66 and
about 60 LPs on sale in an average
week. Major new releases are al
ways on sale for two weeks after
release and other sale albums are
changed weekly.
The manager says that the
Wherehouse's strongest point is
its "appeal to a broader spectrum
of people. People over 30 feel
comfortable here, not out of
place." For all its supermarket at
mosphere, the Wherehouse gives
the customer a good price which
makes it worth the trip.
DISCOUNT RECORDS — 915 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park.
323-9005. Open Mon.-Fri. from
10-9, Sat. 10-6. Sun. 10-5.
Discount Records deserves its
name least of all the stores sur
veyed. but has several redeeming
characteristics that justify its high
price of $5.29 for a single IP. It has
one of the best classical selections
in the Peninsula, and in fact 30
percent of its sales are in classi
cal music on all labels.
The jazz selection is also among
the finest and the staff is particu
larly knowledgeable in these two
areas. Popular albums are on sale
periodically for $3.99, and occa
sionally as low as $3.66.
HAL S MUSIC CENTER — San
Antonio Shopping Center.
941-1111. Open Mon.-Sat. from
10-9, Sun. 10-5.
Hal's is currently in the process
of moving from one location in
San Antonio Center to another
one. closer to Sears, and will be
opening there Nov. 20. with a
grand opening on Nov. 28.
Ninety percent of the regular
stock is specially priced at $3.99!
The stock is composed mainly of
pop. with many imports and the
shop sells musical instruments
and stereos as well as records'.
Guitars are a specialty.
Sounds like a good place to
check out, once the store settles in
its new home.
