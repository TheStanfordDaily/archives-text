# Records: hottest scene in music

### PETER KRETZMAN 
Rock. Jazz. Pop. Classical.
They're all available on the
largest-selling music medium
around — records. Beginning
with the rise of rock and roll, LP
records in particular, with their
relatively low price and easy
playability, have burgeoned into a
heavily-promoted and lucrative
industry.
"It's a pretty competitive world,
selling records," says Bob Caires.
assistant manager of Wherehouse
Records in Mountain View. And

salesmen from other stores agree
emphatically when discussing
their store's policies on sales and
pricing.
"Right now, most of our sales
are rock and roll," Caires says.
"We find that current R & R re
leases tend to sell more than ev
erything else combined — for ex
ample, the latest album by a given
star such as John Denver or Elton
John will outsell everything else
that that artist has done," he adds.
Response to competitiveness
"But some things stay on sale
longer than others — it depends

on the nature of the album. We
find that some of the harder rock is
bought really quickly after re
lease. Other albums that sell con
sistently well for a longer period
of time may stay on sale for over a
month," Caires explains.
A trend noticed by several re
cord stores in the area is that
heavier rock is selling much less
than it used to. Salesmen say that
the listening audience seems to be
leaning more towards "middle
of-the-road" music, such as Seals
and Crofts, America or Loggins
and Messina.

Caires cites Elton John and John
Denver as two of the store's big
gest sellers. "Face it,"he says
"Elton John's latest release can
always be counted on to be a mill
ion seller."
As for promotion and its effect
on record sales, he notes that
"things on sale and not on ad
don't sell as well as things that are
both on sale and on ad."
Commenting on Bruce
Springsteen's promotional
phenomenon, Caires says thai
Springsteen has "been selling
ever since his new, heavily
promoted album came out.
Pubulicity sometimes really
seems to work."
Most buyers range in age from
high school to college, with the
record stores in the immediate
Palo Alto area getting a lot of col
lege business.

"The really young ones,
though, say of around junior high
age, tend to buy 455, not albums,"
according to Caires. "This is prob
ably because they don't have as
much money as the older kids."
A salesman from another record
store, though, commented that the
"junior high kids seem to buy
more of the Elton John type of
thing, while older kids go more for
such things as Jefferson Airp
lane."
Jazz, according to Caires, is
usually purchased by college-age
people, with some of the "hotter
(jazz albums) going as well as the
pop stuff. For the most part,
though, our jazz sales are some
where in between our rock sales
and our classical sales."
Wherehouse still sells one or
two Beatle albums per day. Caires
says. And classical albums also go
at about that pace.

though, our jazz sales are some
where in between our rock sales
and our classical sales."
Wherehouse still sells one or
two Beatle albums per day. Caires
says. And classical albums also go
at about that pace.
Rock. Jazz. Pop. Classical.
They're all available on the
largest-selling music medium
around — records. Beginning
with the rise of rock and roll, LP
records in particular, with their
relatively low price and easy
playability, have burgeoned into a
heavily-promoted and lucrative
industry.
"It's a pretty competitive world,
selling records," says Bob Caires.
assistant manager of Wherehouse
Records in Mountain View. And

salesmen from other stores agree
emphatically when discussing
their store's policies on sales and
pricing.
"Right now, most of our sales
are rock and roll," Caires says.
"We find that current R & R re
leases tend to sell more than ev
erything else combined — for ex
ample, the latest album by a given
star such as John Denver or Elton
John will outsell everything else
that that artist has done," he adds.
Response to competitiveness
"But some things stay on sale
longer than others — it depends

on the nature of the album. We
find that some of the harder rock is
bought really quickly after re
lease. Other albums that sell con
sistently well for a longer period
of time may stay on sale for over a
month," Caires explains.
A trend noticed by several re
cord stores in the area is that
heavier rock is selling much less
than it used to. Salesmen say that
the listening audience seems to be
leaning more towards "middle
of-the-road" music, such as Seals
and Crofts, America or Loggins
and Messina.

Caires cites Elton John and John
Denver as two of the store's big
gest sellers. "Face it,"he says
"Elton John's latest release can
always be counted on to be a mill
ion seller."
As for promotion and its effect
on record sales, he notes that
"things on sale and not on ad
don't sell as well as things that are
both on sale and on ad."
Commenting on Bruce
Springsteen's promotional
phenomenon, Caires says thai
Springsteen has "been selling
ever since his new, heavily
promoted album came out.
Pubulicity sometimes really
seems to work."
Most buyers range in age from
high school to college, with the
record stores in the immediate
Palo Alto area getting a lot of col
lege business.

"The really young ones,
though, say of around junior high
age, tend to buy 455, not albums,"
according to Caires. "This is prob
ably because they don't have as
much money as the older kids."
A salesman from another record
store, though, commented that the
"junior high kids seem to buy
more of the Elton John type of
thing, while older kids go more for
such things as Jefferson Airp
lane."
Jazz, according to Caires, is
usually purchased by college-age
people, with some of the "hotter
(jazz albums) going as well as the
pop stuff. For the most part,
though, our jazz sales are some
where in between our rock sales
and our classical sales."
