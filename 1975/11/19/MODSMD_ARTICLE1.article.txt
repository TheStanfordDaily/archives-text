# Buckley Law causes change in PTRs
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Students now have the opportunity
to request that their academic records
be kept from student representatives
on various University honors commit
tees.
Exercising this option requires
checking off a "yes" box in response to
a newly introduced statement on
winter quarter advance Permits To Re
gister (PTRs). The statement reads "1
object to student participation in
committees reviewing my records to
award prizes and honors."
According to Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton, "this question is di
rectly attributable to the Buckley
Amendment. Under the amendment, a
student cannot look at the records of
another student if he (the second stu
dent) objects."
He said members of the Registrar's
Office became aware earlier this quar
ter that the University was not comply
ing with this provision of the act. "But
this question should fill the gap,"
Houghton said.
The list
A list of all the people who answer
affirmatively will be compiled by the
Registrar's Office, Houghton added,
and "will be available for committee
use in winter quarter."
He said the list will be used by two
sub-committees of the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve

ment, the subcommittee on depart
mental honors, the group determining
the Dinkelspiel and Gores awards and
by Phi Beta Kappa.
"I don't think this is that important a
deal," Houghton said. "We don't an
ticipate getting that many objections,
and I think the committees will be able
to evaluate those candidates sepa
rately."
Phi Beta Kappa Secretary Dan Price
said "Two parts of our selection pro
cedure involve students. First, we
have a student screening committee
that has access to all the records of
juniors and seniors with high enough
grade levels to be eligible for Phi Beta
Kappa. They look at transcripts with
the names blacked out.
Enough anonymity?
"I certainly hope this anonymity is
enough under the Buckley Amend
ment," he said. "We're expecting a rul
ing on it soon."
Two students also sit on the Phi Beta
Kappa executive council, which
makes final selections.
