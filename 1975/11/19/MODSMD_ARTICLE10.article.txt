# Mascot insults
## 
### 
We, the members of MEChA,
vehemently oppose the re
instatement of the Indian as a
mascot for Stanford. We believe
that the efforts of certain alumni
and students to re-instate the In
dian represent an irresponsible
and callous disregard for Native
Americans not only at Stanford
but also throughout the nation.
That the issue has continued
to persevere is uo surprise to the
chicano community for we also
have suffered from the disgrace
and injustice of racial
stereotypes such as, "lazy, dirty,
sneaky, banditos," and those
presently perpetrated by Chico
and the Man.
Similarly, the Native Ameri
cans have also been the victims
of racial stereotypes such as
"Indian giver" and the "Noble
Savage."
The present move to re-instate
the Indian at Stanford can be
seen in the same light as previ
ous racist stereotypes because it
attempts to characterize all Na
tive Americans with "Ug" faces
composed of bulbous noses,
protruding foreheads, and high
cheekbones, which are all top
ped by a "war bonnet."
The Native Americans are by
no means a homogenous group
and any attempt to portray them
as such is a distortion of reality,
based on Hollywood stereotypes
and cultural bias in our educa
tion systems.
Furthermore, if (he Indian
symbol returns, so will "Prince
Lightfoot." In the words of the
Native Americans at Stanford in

Eddie Sosa

1972, "Lightfootis especially in
sulting to the Plains Indian stu
dents, for the mascot's dances
and costumes are improperly
designed after their traditional
practices and dress.
"These students have been
raised to have a deep regard for
their traditional dances and a
great deal of respect for the dan
cers who have earned the honor
of performing the tribal rites.
Lightfoot's actions on the foot
ball field indeed make a mockery
of these religious practices."
This issue does not belong on
any ballot. It is not a matter to
vote on. The votes of all the Stan
ford community could never jus
tify the degradation of the Native
American people.
The Stanford community
should live up to its responsibil
ity in this matter. As a prestigi
ous institution which sup
posedly prides itself on liberal
education, Stanford should be at
the forefront in the efforts to
breakdown racist stereotypes
rather than re-inforce them.
However, in the event that
people persist in their efforts to
bring back the Indian, we will
join our Native American
brothers and sisters in their
struggle.
We will not allow the students
or alumni of this institution to
degradeany Third World people
by lowering them to the status of
a "mascot."
