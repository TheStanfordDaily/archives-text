Recent talk of a new mascot for
our athletic teams coupled with
cries from some older alumni to
"bring back the Stanford Indian"
may be puzzling to current stu
dents, few of whom were enrol
led in 1972 when the ASSU Se
nate voted to abolish the practice
of using the Indian as an official
mascot.
This action, subsequently en
dorsed by President Richard
Lyman for the University, was
taken in response to a petition
signed by our Native American
students, virtually all of whom
found the use of the Indian as a
mascot repugnant.
Most of us would agree that we
should not choose a mascot or
symbol that offends the sen
sibilities of any ethnic group.
Indeed, it is largely irrelevant to
inquire why a group is offended.
One may argue that no disre
spect is intended; unfortunately,
as we all know, what one intends
to communicate in any transac
tion between persons is not
necessarily the message that is
received, and it is the latter that
counts.
Even though we grant this
point, many alumni will con
tinue to insist that having an In
dian mascot was innocent good
fun and that Native Americans
should accept or welcome it. In
the face of this pressure, it is well
for all of us in the campus com
munity to try to understand —
with both mind and heart — why
Indian students at Stanford and
elsewhere don't feel that way.
Patronizing symbol
One of Webster's definitions
of a mascot is as follows: "a small
boy chosen to accompany a team
to its contests, typically wearing
its uniform and usually obliged
to perform such chores as fetch
ing water, tending bats, etc."
In a world of small boys, such
a position may evoke respect and
envy;in the world of adults, it
elicits, at best, patronizing
amusement.
More generally, a mascot is de
fined as "an animal, person, or
thing regarded as a good luck
omen." This scarcely makes the
idea of being a mascot any more
attractive: most human beings
do not cover roles that can be
played equally well by animals
or things, and since we all know
that luck is not really conjured
by symbols, it is all a big joke.
Now there is nothing wrong
with jokes — unless they hurt or
offend people: if they do, they
should not be told, certainly not
in the presence of those who can
be injured.
It has been suggested that we
view the Indian as a symbol
rather than a mascot, a semantic
exercise that can be perfored as
well on Oskie the Bear, and all

one's human dignity.
Ugly charicatures
There was, however, a special
torment for our Native American
students in being assaulted day
after day with misshappen cari
catures of their people on
bumber stickes, kiosks, and
football programs.
They knew that no minority
group in America suffers higher
morbidity and mortality rates,
greater poverty, more social dis
integration, more prejudicial
treatment. Keenly, sometimes
guiltily aware of the oppor
tunities and amenities they
enjoy which are not shared by
their people as a whole,
Stanford's Native American stu
dents feel a deep commitment to
improve the lot of their people.
One step in this process is to
alter the prevailing attitude of
the nation toward Indians, to
educate the public about their
suffering and their desparate
needs. The ever-present image of
the happy little warrior with
feathers in his hair is clearly
counter-productive.
Cultural tension
More than any other group of
students, Native Americans en
dure a painful tension between
two cultures. They hold values
that are different and sometimes
incompatible with the dominant
middle-class values, religious
beliefs which the controlling
Christian society has belittled
and sought to destroy.
Many of them learned native
languages only to be forced to
forget them in government-run
schools. Their chants, dances,
and ceremonial dress often have
religious or cultural meanings
which are grotesquely perverted
when these are used to amuse
crowds at athletic events.
Since the first white man set
foot on the continent, Indians
have been misunderstood, mis
represented, and mistreated. If
not dtepicted as a cruel and bar
baric savage, he was apt to be
seen as ignorant, shiftless, de
praved, and alcoholic. In our lit
erature, the "good" Indian rein
forced these stereotypes by con
trast, and even he was usually
tarnished.
Having been robbed and
cheated by whites for two cen
turies, an Indian cannot be criti
cized if he resists being co-opted
to entertain affluent white fans
on Saturday afternoons.
