## Return to semesters needed 
### 
The statement of Philosophy Prof. Patrick
Suppes (Daily, Nov. 14) that the debate con
cerning the semester system has been "laid
to rest ior at least a generation" calls to mind
a declaration bv Neville Chamberlain in
1938.
Like the earlier pronouncement it was
unwise, for the concessions implied in such
a remark are too great. In this case homage
has been paid to a venerable Stanford in
stitution —inertia —at the expense of a
needed reevaluation of the present state of
education.
In 1969, the Report to the University of
the Study of Education at Stanford recom
mended the adoption of a semester calendar
which included "a two week reading
period, free of scheduled academic respon
sibilities prior to the examination period."
The study reasoned that the longer term
would allow greater absorption of material,
.benefit the University financially, and pro
vide a fortnight in which students could
"concentrate on their self-directed work or
review, synthesize, and reflect on what they
have learned, each at his own pace."
Calendar alternatives
These recommendations are reviewed in
the recent report of Task Forcelll, a commit
tee charged with examining the "economic
educational impact" of various calendar al
ternatives including the semester system.
Consideration of the 1969 Report was
highly subjective, for the committee has re
fused to accept the validity of arguments

concerning opinions of educational effec
tiveness.
Ideas regarding the quality of instruction
are passed off as philosophical; the propos
als tor change are dismissed for containing
"a number of categorical imperatves."
Task Force 111 did serve the calendar de
bate by investigating the financial aspects of
a change and by pointing out that a signific
ant portion of the faculty is dissatisfied with
the present quarter system.
The former contribution revealed that a
switch to the semester calendar would save
the University a minimum of $30,000 a year
in printing, labor, and computer costs.
Sizable sum
This would seem to be a sizable sum,
being equivalent to the tuition payments of
approximately eight students. It could, for
example, underwrite the elusive Hon
eycomb House visiting professorship.
Still, the committee summarizes tnat "we
have been unable to detect possible cost sav
ings which would result from a reorganiza
tion of instruction from quarters to semes
ters."
In considering a reform of the calendar,
however, the issue of money is of secondary
importance next to any educational benefits
which might result from a change. Task
Force 111 conducted a limited poll and found
the split between calendar preferences
closly follows departmental affiliations.
Humanities professors on the whole pre
fer the semester for reasons which, in addi-

tion to those in the SES report, include av
oiding the loss of momentum which comes
from oeing limited by shorter periods, a
freedom to assign more written work, the
opportunity for closer contact with stu
dents, and theabilityto more accurately and
effectively evaluate an individual's prog
ress.
The proponents for the quarter system are
divided into many camps. Some do not
wish to "rock the boat" and fear that a
change in academic calendar will present
too many additional responsibilities, e.g.,
re-designing courses, to their already sub
stantial burdens.
Flexibility preferred
Others prefer the flexibility which quar
ters offer in scheduling and in course offer
ings. Many professors, particularly those in
engineering and the sciences, wish to be
able to distribute information in conve
nient, quarter-sized packages.
Clearly there is room for discussion, one
which must come to terms with individuals'
concepts of education without resorting to
Kantian terminology.
Some common ground may emerge
which could provide a basis for reform. The
advantages of a semester system would
perhaps most readily affect the humanities,
for these departments attempt to instill and
enhance skills of synthesis, writing and re
search which the constraints of a quarter
system too often inhibit.
