# New woes demand new leaders

(The following is the first in a
series of columns solicited by
the Daily from 1976 presidential
candidates. Other columns will
appear on this page from time to
time.)
It's enough to make a person
skeptical. As I have worked in
Washington, I have listened to
debate over whether recession or
inflation was our most serious
economic illness, watched as
one group, then another, rushed
forward with cures and
counter-cures for the energy
shortage and the food shortage
and the shortage of belief in the
integrity of government and read
the endless post-mortem ac
counts of why we were so vul
nerable to the Arab oil embargo
and how that might have been
prevented.
It boils down to a failure of
leadership.
Certainly, both the Congress
and the President are to blame.
Little, if any, leadership was
shown by either branch of gov
ernment.
Congress and the President, at
one crucial time or another
each were uncertain about what
was wrong, unable to propose a
definitive solution, unaware of
the danger until the problem was
at hand. »
Diversity and unity
But, whoever heard of a
charismatic Congress? Who ex
pects the 535 members of Con
gress to speak with the clear,
single voice that is needed to
lead us out of our present dif
ficulties?
The American people expect
more, though,from their Presi
dent. They expect wise leader
ship, a clear sense of direction.
And, until recent years, they
have received it.
But this Administration,
which has been in office since
1969. has failed to govern with
either wisdom or foresight. It has
bounced from crisis to crisis. It

has reacted to the problems of
the moment. It is without
specific goals. It is without sen
sible plans.
It needs to be replaced.
I am seeking office as Presi
dent of the United States because
I think I can offer leadership
which is at once candid, unaf
raid and positive — the kind of
leadership that has been mis
sing.
The paramount issue is
economic recovery. And that
means jobs — jobs at decent
wages with a chance to fully de
velop one's talents.
Yet, the issues are more pro
found than that —for America's
immediate agenda must always
be related to America's enduring
promises.
Certainly, the most urgent
need is to get peoste ( back to
work.
But we must also restore an
economic system which pro
vides diversity of opportunity
for earning a living and gives
meaning to the dream of indi
vidual independence.
Independence
We must have individual in
dependence:
—for those who choose to
labor in our factories and in our
mines, a stable and fair income
in a safe working environment.
—for those who choose to op
erate small businesses, an as
surnce that diligent work will
bring with it a reasonable chance
for success;
—for those who wish to farm
the land, the assurnce that the
necessary time and effort will
enable them to successfully live
off the land;
—for those who chose profes
sions. a guarantee that quality
education and training will be
available;
—for those overtaken by seri
ous illness, protection from the
spectre of financial ruin;
—for those who have reached

retirement age, confidence in the
adequacy of their income and
the security of their surround
ings;
—and, for all people, men and
women, black, brown, yellow
and white, rich and poor, young
and old there must be full, fair
and equal application and en
forcement of the law of the land.
Again, jobs are our most im
mediate need. But economic op
portunty and individual inde
pendence must remain our fun
damental goals.
Limits of power
In foreign policy, America's
performance must also relate to
America's promise.
We have been forced, pain
fully, to recognize the limits of
power. And, while the United
States must remain militarily
secure and a formidable world
leader, we must also be a far
sighted leader.
We must have a foreign policy
which gives as much weight to
interdependence as it does to
military strength.
Sadly, this world is not so
peaceful a place that we can now
beat the guns into plowshares.
Rather, the world is made up of
nation states which fear each
other, but which need each
other.
And, it is this question of
needs which we must bring to
the front: the need in this coun
try for a steady supply of raw
materials; the need for greater
trading opportunities for Ameri
can products.
I seek the office of President as
a Democrat — as a member of a
party whose goals were forged
by some of the greatest leaders of
the western world: Woodrow
Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt,
Harry Truman. John Kennedy
and Lyndon Johnson. Our
party's commitment is to the
people; its history is one of suc
cess in time of economic crisis.
I bring to this campaign a

Lloyd Bentsen

background which embraces
military service inWorld War II;
membership in both the House
of Representatives and the Se
nate; and sixteen years as a pri
vate citizen, building a business
away from the nation's capital.
Our problems demand a broad
outlook; I submit my career and
my record as evidence of such an
outlook.
Franklin Roosevelt said in
1932 that one who believes in
new standards of government for
meeting new prolems and in the
translation of forward looking
thought into practical action,
must welcome a chance to do his
share towards that end.
I welcome the chance to do my
share.

Limits of power
In foreign policy, America's
performance must also relate to
America's promise.
We have been forced, pain
fully, to recognize the limits of
power. And, while the United
States must remain militarily
secure and a formidable world
leader, we must also be a far
sighted leader.
We must have a foreign policy
which gives as much weight to
interdependence as it does to
military strength.
Sadly, this world is not so
peaceful a place that we can now
beat the guns into plowshares.
Rather, the world is made up of
nation states which fear each
other, but which need each
other.
And, it is this question of
needs which we must bring to
the front: the need in this coun
try for a steady supply of raw
materials; the need for greater
trading opportunities for Ameri
can products.
I seek the office of President as
a Democrat — as a member of a
party whose goals were forged
by some of the greatest leaders of
the western world: Woodrow
Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt,
Harry Truman. John Kennedy
and Lyndon Johnson. Our
party's commitment is to the
people; its history is one of suc
cess in time of economic crisis.
I bring to this campaign a

Lloyd Bentsen

background which embraces
military service inWorld War II;
membership in both the House
of Representatives and the Se
nate; and sixteen years as a pri
vate citizen, building a business
away from the nation's capital.
Our problems demand a broad
outlook; I submit my career and
my record as evidence of such an
outlook.
Franklin Roosevelt said in
1932 that one who believes in
new standards of government for
meeting new prolems and in the
translation of forward looking
thought into practical action,
must welcome a chance to do his
share towards that end.
I welcome the chance to do my

It's enough to make a person
skeptical. As I have worked in
Washington, I have listened to
debate over whether recession or
inflation was our most serious
economic illness, watched as
one group, then another, rushed
forward with cures and
counter-cures for the energy
shortage and the food shortage
and the shortage of belief in the
integrity of government and read
the endless post-mortem ac
counts of why we were so vul
nerable to the Arab oil embargo
and how that might have been
prevented.
It boils down to a failure of
leadership.
Certainly, both the Congress
and the President are to blame.
Little, if any, leadership was
shown by either branch of gov
ernment.
Congress and the President, at
one crucial time or another
each were uncertain about what
was wrong, unable to propose a
definitive solution, unaware of
the danger until the problem was
at hand. »
Diversity and unity
But, whoever heard of a
charismatic Congress? Who ex
pects the 535 members of Con
gress to speak with the clear,
single voice that is needed to
lead us out of our present dif

The American people expect
more, though,from their Presi

ship, a clear sense of direction.
And, until recent years, they
have received it.
But this Administration,
which has been in office since
1969. has failed to govern with
either wisdom or foresight. It has

It needs to be replaced.
I am seeking office as Presi

I think I can offer leadership

1932 that one who believes in
new standards of government for
meeting new prolems and in the
translation of forward looking
thought into practical action,
must welcome a chance to do his
share towards that end.
I welcome the chance to do my
share.

It's enough to make a person
skeptical. As I have worked in
Washington, I have listened to
debate over whether recession or
inflation was our most serious
economic illness, watched as
one group, then another, rushed
forward with cures and
counter-cures for the energy
shortage and the food shortage
and the shortage of belief in the
integrity of government and read
the endless post-mortem ac
counts of why we were so vul
nerable to the Arab oil embargo
and how that might have been
prevented.
It boils down to a failure of
leadership.
Certainly, both the Congress
and the President are to blame.
Little, if any, leadership was
shown by either branch of gov
ernment.
Congress and the President, at
one crucial time or another
each were uncertain about what
was wrong, unable to propose a
definitive solution, unaware of
the danger until the problem was
at hand. »
Diversity and unity
But, whoever heard of a
charismatic Congress? Who ex
pects the 535 members of Con
gress to speak with the clear,
single voice that is needed to
lead us out of our present dif
ficulties?
The American people expect
more, though,from their Presi
dent. They expect wise leader
ship, a clear sense of direction.
And, until recent years, they
have received it.
But this Administration,
which has been in office since
1969. has failed to govern with
either wisdom or foresight. It has
bounced from crisis to crisis. It

has reacted to the problems of
the moment. It is without
specific goals. It is without sen
sible plans.
It needs to be replaced.
I am seeking office as Presi
dent of the United States because
I think I can offer leadership
which is at once candid, unaf
raid and positive — the kind of
leadership that has been mis
sing.
The paramount issue is
economic recovery. And that
means jobs — jobs at decent
wages with a chance to fully de
velop one's talents.
Yet, the issues are more pro
found than that —for America's
immediate agenda must always
be related to America's enduring
promises.
Certainly, the most urgent
need is to get peoste ( back to
work.
But we must also restore an
economic system which pro
vides diversity of opportunity
for earning a living and gives
meaning to the dream of indi
vidual independence.
Independence
We must have individual in
dependence:
—for those who choose to
labor in our factories and in our
mines, a stable and fair income
in a safe working environment.
—for those who choose to op
erate small businesses, an as
surnce that diligent work will
bring with it a reasonable chance
for success;
—for those who wish to farm
the land, the assurnce that the
necessary time and effort will
enable them to successfully live
off the land;
—for those who chose profes
sions. a guarantee that quality
education and training will be
available;
—for those overtaken by seri
ous illness, protection from the
spectre of financial ruin;
—for those who have reached

retirement age, confidence in the
adequacy of their income and
the security of their surround
ings;
—and, for all people, men and
women, black, brown, yellow
and white, rich and poor, young
and old there must be full, fair
and equal application and en
forcement of the law of the land.
Again, jobs are our most im
mediate need. But economic op
portunty and individual inde
pendence must remain our fun
damental goals.
Limits of power
In foreign policy, America's
performance must also relate to
America's promise.
We have been forced, pain
fully, to recognize the limits of
power. And, while the United
States must remain militarily
secure and a formidable world
leader, we must also be a far
sighted leader.
We must have a foreign policy
which gives as much weight to
interdependence as it does to
military strength.
Sadly, this world is not so
peaceful a place that we can now
beat the guns into plowshares.
Rather, the world is made up of
nation states which fear each
other, but which need each
other.
And, it is this question of
needs which we must bring to
the front: the need in this coun
try for a steady supply of raw
materials; the need for greater
trading opportunities for Ameri
can products.
I seek the office of President as
a Democrat — as a member of a
party whose goals were forged
by some of the greatest leaders of
the western world: Woodrow
Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt,
Harry Truman. John Kennedy
and Lyndon Johnson. Our
party's commitment is to the
people; its history is one of suc
cess in time of economic crisis.
I bring to this campaign a

Lloyd Bentsen

background which embraces
military service inWorld War II;
membership in both the House
of Representatives and the Se
nate; and sixteen years as a pri
vate citizen, building a business
away from the nation's capital.
Our problems demand a broad
outlook; I submit my career and
my record as evidence of such an
outlook.
