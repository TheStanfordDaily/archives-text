We are writing this column
with a sense of disgust and dis
belief. On Nov. 13, in Meyer Lib
rary, we witnessed the most re
pulsive kind of fraternity "fun"
— something one can never
quite believe until having had
the bad fortune to see it fir
sthand.
The gentlemen of the Kappa
Alpha fraternity treated scores of
people to a display of their col
lective bad taste. For those who
missed the production, a brief
description:
At 9:30 p.m. a crowd gathered
on the three levels surrounding
the open inner court of Meyer
Library. About 10 minutes later,
all studying had stopped as
everyone came to see what was
going to happen.
At that point, a KA boy appar
ently imitating a retarded senior
citizen came hobbling in, loudly
begging someone to "buy my
balloons."
It's refreshing to see that in
spite of the many recent attempts
to make our society aware of the
low status and often horrifying
life conditions of the aged, the
members of KA cling faithfully
to the old age-ist stereotype and
cheerfully continue to mock the
elderly.
But perhaps the KA boy did
not intend his performance to be
a portrait of the retarded old
man. If we're wrong about the
intended age, our apologies to
KA — denigrating the elderly is
one thing, but who cares about a
few fun pokes at the retarded?.
The next portion of the show
was dedicated to a tribute to Na
tive Americans, as three face
painted, brave warriors who
oped into view. Again, another
faithful portrayal of a stereotype,
and further confirmation of the
level of social consciousness of
KA.
In accord with the laws of
showmanship, KA saved the
best till last, and for a finale we
wre treated to a rendition of
Alouette which celebrated the
virtues of KA's "Dream Woman"
— complete with "running
sores, rude stretch marks, swing
ing tits, one club foot" and the
unbearably cute final line,
"Have you ever made her
come?"
Wild laughter. Applause. End
of performance. Exit KA boys.
Beyond embarrassment, there
was a sense of outrage. We were
disgusted that the denigration of
the old, the retarded, Indians,
and women was seen as a source
of such humor, not only by the
KA boys, but by the eager audi
ence who lined the balconies.
As women, we were repelled
by how little respect and power
women as a group command. It
would have been unthinkable
for the KA boys to have directed
such a sickening parody at
another minority group.
Their ridicule of minorities,
the handicapped and th« elderly
took much more oblique form.
Any hopes w§ had that the ado
lescent male view of female sex
uality had changed during this
decade were destroyed by the
performance and its reception.
It sickens us to see our sex
ridiculed in this way.
It saddens us to see the aware
ness of these Stanford men at
such an abysmal level.
Most of all, it frightens us to
see that, despite the social and
political activism of our own col
lege years, the men of the 1970's
choose to focus their gathered
energies in this kind of demonst
ration.
