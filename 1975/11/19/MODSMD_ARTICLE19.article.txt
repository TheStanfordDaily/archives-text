## Say cheese! Shutter bug 'click' develops 
### DAVE ANSLEY 
So — your brotherlent you his
35mm camera and you'd like to
try your hand at photography,
but you couldn't get into Art 70.
Or — you used to take sports
pictures for the high school
newspaper, and want to do some
developing and printing, but
don't have time this year for an
official class in the subject.
Or — you're an almost-pro
photog with the entire Nikon
system, and lots of great ideas for
award-winning pictures, but no
money for an elaborate dark
room.
What you need is someplace to
go on campus, where you can
develop, print and mount pic
tures to your heart's content and
not have to worry about yoyr
skill, any assignments, or the
cost of a Durst enlarger. Well,
that place does exist — it's
known as the Stanford Photo
graphy Club.
Former trunk room
Tucked away in a musty
corner of the Wilbur basement,

the club has been in existence,
and growing steadily, for almost
10 years. What used to be a trunk
room now houses a well
equipped darkroom complex.
According to Jim Spirakis,
president of the club, "Our pur
pose is to provide a decent dark
room to everybody."

Club mem
bers have ac
cess to a film
developing
darkroom, a
black-and
white printing
darkroom with
four enlargers,
a color print
ing darkroom
with its owr
enlarger, tem
perature-con-

trolled water, a drying closet, a
print dryer, a dry-mount press
and all the chemicals they need.
For $10 per quarter ($l5 the
first time) the club's 170 mem
bers can work any time of the
day, seven days a week.

"You can come down here and
workalonefor hours—all night,
if you want," one member
claims.
The club is relatively au
tonomous in relation to the Uni
versity — since paying off an
ASSU loan for equipment and
improvement, the most official

contact they
have received is
an occasional
request for a
statement of
their purpose or
budget, says
Spirakis. It op
erates on a
non-profit basis,
with a $1500
quarterly
budget.
The dark-

room's biggest draw
backs are its compactness, and
the claustrophobic effect as
sociated with being surrounded
by steam pipes (there are 38 in
the ceiling of one room alone).
But what little space there is, is

utilized completely. Any room
that's not filled with equipment
is papered with instructions.
The darkroom boasts several
special" features as well. The en
larging stations are all indepen
dent. which means white light
can be turned on over an en
larger. One station can be used
by people in wheelchairs. Nit
rogen gas at each en larger can
remove dust from negatives.
Film tank loading is done in a
small phone-booth size dark
room, which allows the film
developing to be done with room
lights. Members can store their
own specially brewed chemicals
if they prefer. Each room even
has its own telephone.
Beginning and color photo
graphy classes are taught during
the first six weeks of each quar
ter. Other classes are arranged
when interest warrants it. Sev
eral weeks ago, the club spon
sored a lecture and demonstra
tion on camera care with a re
pairman from a nearby photo
graphy store.
