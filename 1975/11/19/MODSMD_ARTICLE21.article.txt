What is the average length of a
penis? Does it make any differ
ence how big mine is?
Fundamentals of Human
Sexuality says,"The average
penis is three to four inches long
when flaccid and somewhat
more than six inches in erection.
Its diameter in the relaxed state
is about IVi inches and increases
another 'A-inch in erection.
Penises can however be consid
erably smaller or larger. Erect
penises larger than 13 inches
have been measured."
The Joy of Sex answers your
second question: "Size has abso
lutely nothing to do with their
serviceability in intercourse or
— since female orgasm doesn't
depend on getting deeply into
the pelvis — with capacity to
satisfy a partner, though many
women are turned on by the idea
of a large one, and a few say they
feel more. The unstretched vag
ina is only four inches long any
way. If anything, thickness mat
ters more. Nor has flaccid size
anything to do with erect

size. . . . There is no way of 'en
larging' a penis. Size doesn't dif
fer appreciably between 'races,'
nor correlate with big muscles
elsewhere. Nor, except in very
rare cases, is a penis too big for a
woman — the vagina will take a
full-term baby."

Reader Reaction:
I want to add a comment about
your answer to a student who
asked what he or she should do if
not sure about his or her sexual
ity (Nov. 5). You recommended
talking to counselors at the
Bridge, the GPU or the peer
counselors at Cowell.
For the sake of a few students
who may be unwilling or un
comfortable in talking to their
peers, you might have included
that professional counselors are
also available at Counseling and
Psychological Services. This
lists all the options available and
allows the student to make the
appropriate choice.
(This service is available at
Cowell.)
