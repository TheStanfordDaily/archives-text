## Chris mute on starting QB Cal prepares for Guy 
### DAVE SMITH 
BERKELEY — California's JV quarterback, Eric
Anderson, stands over center, wearing a cardinal
jersey with "GUY" taped in white letters across
the back.
Anderson takes the snap from his puny lineman
and drops back a few steps as Cal's starting defen
sive line comes storming in. "Go get him, dam
mit," yells an assistant coach. "Go get Guy!"
While Stanford's Jack Christiansen hasn't
named a starting quarterback for the Big Game,
the Golden Bear coaches seemed to have some
ideas at yesterday's practice. And if the real Guy
Benjamin has as hard a time Saturday as his
stand-in did at theCal practice . . . but then again,
Stanford's Guy doesn't have 5-foot-8 tackles
blocking for him.
Chris mum
Christiansen didn't mention Benjamin or the
other sometime Stanford starter, Mike Cordova, in
his annual pre-Big Game address to the Northern
California Football Writers yesterday."The quar
terback controversy isn't what filled the
stadium," said Chris. "The fans are coming to see
the most prestigious, critical, pressure-packed
Big Game in 25 years.
"We're well aware of that, and we know that our
defense has its biggest challenge of the year," he
added. "We became aware a little too soon — like
after halftime of the Oregon game."
Because Cal's win over Air Force last week gave
the Bears a better record than the Cards for the
season, a tie in the Big Game gives Cal priority

over the Cards for the Pacific Eight's Rose Bowl
berth. Predictably, Cal's Mike White said he
would play for a tie, and Christiansen said he
wouldn't.
No field goal
"If a field goal can tie it, and we're anywhere on
the field, we'll go for the touchdown,"'said Chris.
"If you see us lining up in field goal formation,
it'll be a fake."
Various interested statisticians have unearthed
a large number of miscellaneous reasons why this
year's Big Game is "bigger" than in recent sea
sons. This is the first season since 1949 (or 1937, if
you accept White's version) that both Big Game
opponents still have a chance of going to the Rose
Bowl.
And according to Stanford's ticket sellers, this
is the first time since the mid-1920s that every seat
has been sold for a Big Game at Stanford Stadium.
As for the Golden Bears, who haven't been to a
Rose Bowl since 1959: they'll probably be favored
by anywhere from four to seven points, mostly
because of their nation-leading offense that has
been averaging over 455 yards a game.
Chuck Muncie, the Bears' tailback and North
ern California Offensive Player of the Year, is con
fident that the Bears can avenge last year's Stan
ford upset. "Oh, I expect Stanford to be tough," he
declared after practice yesterday. "But not super
tough."
But they're likely to be tougher than the small
players in red jerseys that Muncie was racing past
yesterday.
