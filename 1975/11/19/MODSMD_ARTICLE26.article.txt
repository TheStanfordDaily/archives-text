# Robb urges new attitudes toward soccer
## 
### JEFF WAHBA 
The Stanford soccer team
(5-12-2), which suffered through
possibly its worst year in coach
Fred Priddle's 21-year Cardinal
coaching career, will be losing a
host of outstanding seniors next
year. Possibly the biggest loss
will be that of halfback Robby
Robb.
Robb (who will be graduating
Phi Betta Kappa in December)
and halfback Mac Taylor were
the mainstays of a Cardinal de
fense which recorded three
shutouts this year.
A four-year letter man in soc
cer, Robb'ssoccer background is
what you would expect from a
top athlete on a major college
team. He started playing league
soccer in sixth grade and was a
standout on his prep school team
in Massachusettes. Robb has
coached during the summer for
youth league teams and has also
played European soccer. Robb
plays in the Mens' Peninsula
League now that the Stanford
soccer season is over.
With that type of background,
one would have expected Robb
to attend a college soccer pow
erhouse. "Like all the other guys
on the team we didn't come to
Stanford to play soccer," Robb
said. "The attraction was the
academic program. It just hap

pened that in my year Stanford
accepted several students who
just happened to have strong
soccer backgrounds.
"It's a shame though that Stan
ford doesn't try to build a better
soccer program. The thing is
that it really wouldn't take more
money on the athletic
department's part, just a differ
ent attitude about soccer from
them."
Department woes
Robb spelled out several
things the athletic department
could have done to improve the
soccer situation this year. "They
could have let us play the San
Jose Earthquakes (a pro team)
and we would have given a
clinic and probably made a sub
stantial amount from admission.
Instead, we weren't allowed to
play the Earthquakes and so they
went up to Berkeley and had a
successful game with Cal.
"The athletic department

could and should do a lot of
other little things like help with
publicity, let us use Stanford
Stadium more often (it was used
just once this year, and the hoot
ers made about $1000 in their
game with Cal), maybe help with
admissions more and let us
travel with the football team so
we can get some non-local com
petition. In general, the athletic
department should just try to
make it seem that we have a
strong program."
Even though Robb has his
complaints about the soccer
program, he said his four years
on the team have "been a lot of
fun.
Good years
"I don't think 1 could have en
joyed my years at Stanford with
out a good balance between
academics and athletics," Robb
said. "Although this year has
been a real disappointment,
especially since we were hurt by

ineligibilities and injuries, it has
been really great playing with
the same bunch of guys for four
years."
And Robb's plans after gradu
ation? "Well, I might see if I can
play with a pro team. I'vealready
gotten a tryout offer with the
Boston Minutemen and the pro
draft will be coming up in
January."
Robbs' career plans also lie
outside athletics. "I've applied

to the top law schools and hope
to enter next September," he
said.
The future for Stanford soccer
is not so bright in Robbs' eyes
though. "I'm afraid they might
eventually phase soccer out at
Stan/ord," he said. With half the
roster returning next year and
fewer than half the starters com
ing back, "the team might have a
hard time winning any games,"
Robb said.
