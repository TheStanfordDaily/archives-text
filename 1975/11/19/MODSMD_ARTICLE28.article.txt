# Card JV gridders end season at 4-2
## 
### JIM MOLLER 
Stanford's JV football team lost
its final game of the season last
Friday afternoon, bowing to the
Cal JV's 45-39.
The game provided a show
case for two fine freshmen quar
terbacks in Cal's Eric Anderson
and Stanford's Turk Schonert.
Anderson completed 30 of 57
passes for 458 yards and six
touchdowns. Schonert did very
well himself, completing 20 out
of 37 passes for 327 yards and
three touchdowns.
The loss left the Cards 4-2 for
the season. Head Coach Doug
Single said his team "played
well all season long," noting that
both Stanford losses were "de
cided in the last minute of the
game by a combined total of
seven points."
The losses were especially
disappointing in that Singlesaid
he felt he had the better team in
both games. In fact. Single says
there are a number of players on
this year's team with the poten
tial to become varsity players
next fall.
Foremost among them is tight
end Marty Smith who Single
said "has an excellent opportun
ity to make a bid for a starting
spot on the varsity next fall."
Smith, 6-foot-6 and 225 pounds,
will be vying for the position
which will be vacated by the
graduation of this year's starting
tight end Ted Pappas.
Two other receivers, John Fyle
and Vince Mulroy, should be

getting a long look from varsity
coach Jack Christiansen and his
staff in spring practice.
Schonert will be in the unen
viable position of playing be
hind three outstanding quarter
backs in Guy Benjamin, Mike
Cordova and Steve Dils.
"Schonert played exceptionally
well as the season progressed,
but is probably a year away,"
Single said.
Playing along with Schonert
in this year's backlield were
Phil Francis and Bill Anderson.
Both backs were impressive
throughout the season and each
has a chance to replace graduat
ing senior Sig Ostrom on the var
sity roster.
Three players on the offensive
line appear to have varsity po
tential. One of them, Dan
McCann, played linebacker all
season until the final game
against Cal, when he switched to
offensive center. McCann made
this adjustment so well that
Single feels he has a chance to
challenge for the starting posi
tion next fall.
Defensively, Brad Slinkard is
one to watch. Slinkard has ad
justed well after moving from
defensive end to noseguard.
Linebacker Jack Moller led the
JV defense in tackles and should
challenge for a spot on the var
sity travelling squad. Among
this year's defensive backs,
Keith Burcham probably has the
inside track on making the var
sity.

ity to make a bid for a starting
spot on the varsity next fall."
Smith, 6-foot-6 and 225 pounds,
will be vying for the position
which will be vacated by the
graduation of this year's starting
tight end Ted Pappas.
Two other receivers, John Fyle
and Vince Mulroy, should be

getting a long look from varsity
coach Jack Christiansen and his
staff in spring practice.
Schonert will be in the unen
viable position of playing be
hind three outstanding quarter
backs in Guy Benjamin, Mike
Cordova and Steve Dils.
"Schonert played exceptionally
well as the season progressed,
but is probably a year away,"
Single said.
Playing along with Schonert
in this year's backlield were
Phil Francis and Bill Anderson.
Both backs were impressive
throughout the season and each
has a chance to replace graduat
ing senior Sig Ostrom on the var
sity roster.
Three players on the offensive
line appear to have varsity po
tential. One of them, Dan
McCann, played linebacker all
season until the final game
against Cal, when he switched to
offensive center. McCann made
this adjustment so well that
Single feels he has a chance to
challenge for the starting posi
tion next fall.
Defensively, Brad Slinkard is
one to watch. Slinkard has ad
justed well after moving from
defensive end to noseguard.
Linebacker Jack Moller led the
JV defense in tackles and should
challenge for a spot on the var
sity travelling squad. Among
this year's defensive backs,
Keith Burcham probably has the
inside track on making the var
sity.
Stanford's JV football team lost
its final game of the season last
Friday afternoon, bowing to the
Cal JV's 45-39.
The game provided a show
case for two fine freshmen quar
terbacks in Cal's Eric Anderson
and Stanford's Turk Schonert.
Anderson completed 30 of 57
passes for 458 yards and six
touchdowns. Schonert did very
well himself, completing 20 out
of 37 passes for 327 yards and
three touchdowns.
The loss left the Cards 4-2 for
the season. Head Coach Doug
Single said his team "played
well all season long," noting that
both Stanford losses were "de
cided in the last minute of the
game by a combined total of
seven points."
The losses were especially
disappointing in that Singlesaid
he felt he had the better team in
both games. In fact. Single says
there are a number of players on
this year's team with the poten
tial to become varsity players
next fall.
Foremost among them is tight
end Marty Smith who Single
said "has an excellent opportun
ity to make a bid for a starting
spot on the varsity next fall."
