Eldridge Cleaver returns to U.S.
NEW YORK — Renouncing his revolutionary past, Eldridge
Cleaver flew home from Paris yesterday, ending seven years on the
run. The former Black Panther leader, depicted as resigned to
imprisonment, was immediately taken into custody by the FBI.
Cleaver's transatlantic flight, on which he had been accom
panied by three FBI agents, landed at Kennedy Airport, where
three more agents met the plane. In addition, U.S. Customs agents
joined in forming a human barrier as some 75 reporters sought to
interview the one-time black revolutionary.
Already in custody, Cleaver, 39, was placed under formal arrest
after he left the plane.
In a letter to the New York Times written before he left Paris and
published yesterday. Cleaver said:
"With all its faults, the American political system is the freest
and most democratic in the world. The system needs to be im
proved, with democracy spread to all areas of life, particularly the
economic.
"All these changes must be conducted through our established
institutions and people with grievances must find political
methods for obtaining redress."
Meanwhile, Cleaver's one time Black Panther comrades dis
associated themselves from him. David Dußeis, editor of the
party's weekly newspaper, said Cleaver no longer is a Black
Panther.
Rumsfeld okayed for defense post
WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed President Ford's
choice of Donald Rumsfeld as the nation's new secretary of de
fense by a vote of 95 to 2 yesterday.
Both senators casting negative votes, Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and
Richard Stone (D-Fla.) said they were protesting the way Ford
fired Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger 16 days earlier and
replaced him ITH Rumsfeld, the White House chief of staff.
Much of the 30-minute debate was taken up with speeches
praising the outgoing secretary. After the confirmation vote, he
Senate by voice vote passed a resolution commending
Schlesinger.
Considered shrewd and ambitious, the 43-year-old Rumsfeld is
expected to work more closely with the White House than the
ousted Schlesinger. He has been mentioned as a possible vice
presidential candidate next year, a prospect he declined to rule out
during his confirmation hearing.
The lopsided vote capped a speedy confirmation process. The

Senate Armed Services Committee approved him unanimously
last Thursday after one-and-a-half days of hearing in which he was
the only witness.
QE-2 searched for IRA explosives
HAMPTON, England — Police and soldiers yesterday wound
up abow-to-stern search of the luxury liner Queen Elizabeth 2 and
said they found no explosives.
But they did not abandon the theory that the ship had been used
to smuggle terrorist explosives from the United States to England,
and authorities asked the FBI to help find the New York connec
tion for the shipment.
Police said the FBI was helping to establish the "complete
supply line from America to London," where recent bombings
have blamed on the Irish Republic Army (IRA).
In London last night, a bomb shattered another fashionable
London restaurant and hospitals said two persons were killed.
Scotland Yard put the total casualties at 31.
The blast was the second at an exclusive London restaurant in a
week and the latest in a bombing campaign blamed on Irish ter
rorists that began Aug. 27. The primary targets have been the |
eating places and residential areas of the titled and rich.
In the last three months six persons have been killed and 167
people injured in bombings in London. The attacks have been \
blamed on the IRA, which is trying to force the British government ]
to withdraw from Northern Ireland, opening the way to unite the
province with the Irish republic. j

Rumsfeld okayed for defense post
WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed President Ford's
choice of Donald Rumsfeld as the nation's new secretary of de
fense by a vote of 95 to 2 yesterday.
Both senators casting negative votes, Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and
Richard Stone (D-Fla.) said they were protesting the way Ford
fired Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger 16 days earlier and
replaced him ITH Rumsfeld, the White House chief of staff.
Much of the 30-minute debate was taken up with speeches
praising the outgoing secretary. After the confirmation vote, he
Senate by voice vote passed a resolution commending
Schlesinger.
Considered shrewd and ambitious, the 43-year-old Rumsfeld is
expected to work more closely with the White House than the
ousted Schlesinger. He has been mentioned as a possible vice
presidential candidate next year, a prospect he declined to rule out
during his confirmation hearing.
The lopsided vote capped a speedy confirmation process. The

Senate Armed Services Committee approved him unanimously
last Thursday after one-and-a-half days of hearing in which he was
the only witness.

HAMPTON, England — Police and soldiers yesterday wound
up abow-to-stern search of the luxury liner Queen Elizabeth 2 and
said they found no explosives.

to smuggle terrorist explosives from the United States to England,

Police said the FBI was helping to establish the "complete
supply line from America to London," where recent bombings

In London last night, a bomb shattered another fashionable
London restaurant and hospitals said two persons were killed.
Scotland Yard put the total casualties at 31.
The blast was the second at an exclusive London restaurant in a
week and the latest in a bombing campaign blamed on Irish ter
rorists that began Aug. 27. The primary targets have been the |
eating places and residential areas of the titled and rich.
In the last three months six persons have been killed and 167
people injured in bombings in London. The attacks have been \
blamed on the IRA, which is trying to force the British government ]
to withdraw from Northern Ireland, opening the way to unite the
province with the Irish republic. j

WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed President Ford's
choice of Donald Rumsfeld as the nation's new secretary of de
fense by a vote of 95 to 2 yesterday.
Both senators casting negative votes, Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and
Richard Stone (D-Fla.) said they were protesting the way Ford
fired Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger 16 days earlier and
replaced him ITH Rumsfeld, the White House chief of staff.
Much of the 30-minute debate was taken up with speeches
praising the outgoing secretary. After the confirmation vote, he
Senate by voice vote passed a resolution commending
Schlesinger.

during his confirmation hearing.
The lopsided vote capped a speedy confirmation process. The

Senate Armed Services Committee approved him unanimously
last Thursday after one-and-a-half days of hearing in which he was

Committee to delete officials name
WASHINGTON — The Senate intelligence committee agreed
yesterday not to name a former CIA official linked to plots to kill
foreign leaders so its final report would not be delayed by a court
battle.
In a surprise reversal of its earlier position, the committee
notified the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that
it would delete the former official's name from its report.
That action abruptly ended legal efforts by the ex-CIA employe
to force the committee to keep his name secret.
The committee's 400-page report is at the Government Printing
Office where employes were waiting for a court decision on
whether to print it with or without the former official's name.
The committee confirmed that the former official was one of two
witnesses who had immunity. The only two witnes
ses who received such a grant were Dr. Sidney Gettlieb, former
director of technical services for the CIA, and Robert Maheu, a
former aide to Howard Hughes. Maheu was represented by a Las
Vegas, Nev., attorney and has publicly admitted his role in a 1961
"'it to kill Castro.
Pac-8 has chance for Fiesta Bowl
PALO ALTO — If the Fiesta Bowl still needs a guest team after
this weekend'scollegefootball games, "I think they'll come to us,"
Pacific-8 Executive Director Wiles Hallock said yesterday.
The Pac-8 co-champion or runner-up team would be available to
face the Western Athletic Conference champ, Arizona State or
Arizona, in the Dec. 26 bowl game at Tempe, Ariz.
But Fiesta Bowl officials' first choice is the loser of Saturday's
game between Big Eight powers Oklahoma and Nebraska. If the
loser is Oklahoma, the Pac-8 will be shut out.
However, Nebraska players voted against accepting a Fiesta
Bowl bid, saying they wanted the outright Big Eight title and
Orange Bowl berth or nothing.
He sized up the conference's chances of getting three teams into
bowl games — Southern Cal is headed for the Liberty Bowl —at
the final weekly meeting of the Northern California Football Writ
ers Association.
