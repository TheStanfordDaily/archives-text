# Letter urged M.L. King's suicide
## FBI defamation campaign revealed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)â€”The staff of a
Senate committee said yesterday that
the FBI waged a campaign against the
late Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., in
cluding sending a letter which King
interpreted as a suggestion he commit
suicide.
The campaign to destroy King's in
fluence also included the planting of
16 electronic bugs and eight wiretaps
and an effort to hand pick and promote
a successor to him as the nation's most
influential black leader, committee
lawyers said.
The disclosures came as the top
lawyers of the Senate Intelligence
Committee detailed FBI efforts to in
vestigate, infiltrate and discredit
thousands of persons in groups rang-

ing from the Ku Klux Klan and the
Communist Party to the Women's lib
eration movement.
Chief counsel F.A.O. Schwarz 111
and minority counsel Curtis Smothers
said the full extent of the FBl's ac
tivities may never be known because
most of director J. Edgar Hoover's per
sonal files were destroyed shortly after
his death in 1972.
Disrupting personal lives
The staff lawyers gave the most
complete account to date of the FBl's
counter-intelligence (Cointel) prog
rams. which were aimed at disrupting
the personal lives of members of al-'
leged terrorist, radical or new left
groups by causing them to lose their
jobs, fight among themselves or be ar-

rested by local police.
They documented several attempts
at destroying the marriages of such
persons through anonymous letters
written by FBI agents.
In the case of King, Smothers tes
tified that a draft of the anonymous
letter his wife received was found at
FBI headquarters in the file of deputy
director William Sullivan.
The lawyers said Sullivan maintains
the draft letter was planted in his files
tfy persons attempting to discredit
him.
No denial by FBI
They added the FBI does not dispute
its authorship of the letter or the fact it
was delivered to King.
King received the letter just 34 days
before he was to receive the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1965, an event which
Schwarz said generated intense FBI ef
forts to find information to discredit
King.
Schwartz said the letter "includes
materials the FBI had gathered illeg
ally or improperly through tapes and
bugs and so forth." Sen. Walter Mon
dale (D-Minn.) said some of the bugs
were installed in King's hotel room.
The letter read in part:
"King, there is only one thing left for
you to do. You know what it is. You
have just 34 days in which to do it.
'You are done'
"Thisexact number has been selected
for a specific reason. It has definite
practicalsignificance. You are done.
There is but one way out for you."
The rest of the letter was not read
because of privacy reasons,the lawyers
said.
They said King himself interpreted
the letter as a clear suggestion that he
commit suicide.
Smothers read from FBI memos in
which he said the bureau outlined its
objective of taking King "off his
pedestal and reducing him completely

in influence."
The bureau earmarked a man of its
own choosing, a person who was not a
civil rights leader, to take King's place
as "a new national Negro leader."
Schwarz and Smothers later de
clined to identify the person con
cerned, saying that he asked to remain
anonymous.
'Shocked and astonished*
That person was never told by the
FBI of the role some proposed he play
and was "shocked and astonished"
when committee staff members re
layed the information to him,
Smothers said.
A former FBI agent, meanwhile,told
the House Intelligence Committee ac
ross the Capital that he believes he was
asked to help the FBI try to prevent the
election of black Rep. Andrew Young
(D-Ga.) in 1972.
Arthur Murtagh told the House
committee his supervisor in the FBI
Atlanta bureau told him Washington
wanted him to obtain samples of
Young's handwriting.
Murtagh said he refused and told the
supervisor, "I know damned well it
was going to be used in an unrecorded
counter-intelligence operation to de
stroy Mr. Young's chances of getting
elected to the House of Representa
tives."
In other testimony, a New Jersey
contractor said he reported plans for
an assault on the Camden, N.J., draft
office in 1971 to the FBI and asserted
that the FBI turned him into a pro
vocateur to encourage the raid.
Robert Hardy said he tried to get the
FBI to stop the raid in advance but
instead said 100 FBI agents were
brought into the area to wait for the
event.
He asserted that the FBI told him
"that the new orders had come directly
from the little White House in Califor
nia."
The House committee's chairman.
Rep. Otis Pike (D-N.Y.) disclosed that
an FBI report shows either a telephone
call or some other communication to
Pike's administrative assistant was in
tercepted by the FBI apparently in
1972.
