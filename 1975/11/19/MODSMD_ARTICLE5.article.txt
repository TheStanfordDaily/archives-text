# Board reverses previous vote
## PA School Board ends anti-gay ban 
### ROB LENCE 
The Palo Alto school board last night reversed a previ
ous decision and banned discrimination against
homosexuals in hiring.
In a 3-2 vote, the board agreed to reinstate the categories
"sexual orientation," "political beliefs," "marital status"
and "handicap" in its official anti-discrimination person
nel policy. The Board had voted Oct. 21 to delete these
items from the proposed policy.
Board members Jean Amick, Rebecca Morgan and James
Steele voted to include the items in the policy while
Donald Hammond and Royce Cole voted against the in
clusion.
Cole said he voted against the items because it could
lead to the formation of gay teachers' unions at the schools
"encouraged by Stanford's gay coalitions."
Laughs from the audience
Cole, who was met with laughs from the audience, said
that such a policy might encourage a gay teacher to gather
gay students around him.
"We don't discriminate against heterosexuals or
homosexuals," said Cole. "What we do discriminate
against is all sexuality on the campuses."

Cole moved to table the motion but did not receive a
seconding vote.
Steele, who reversed his vote of Oct. 21, said he origi
nally voted against the inclusion because it might lead to
the advocacy of homosexuality in the schools.
"I have since talked to several homosexuals who said it
would hurt their movement if there was any advocacy of
homosexuality in the classroom," said Steele. "I do feel
that any such advocacy should be disciplined," he added.
Code prevents advocacy
Steele said the Palo Alto school code would prevent any
advocacy of homosexuality in the schools in spite of the
inclusion of sexual orientation in its nondiscrimination
policy.
Seventeen people had expressed a desire to address the
board, but board president Rebecca Morgan called for a
"straw vote" claiming that "many may not want to speak if
we approve the inclusion of the items."
One person, however, wished to speak against the in
clusion. Joseph Harrington, a Palo Alto citizen, told the
board that "justice for homosexuals shouldn't be purch
ased at a grave injustice to children."
