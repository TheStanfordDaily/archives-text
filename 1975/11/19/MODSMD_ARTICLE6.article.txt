# Education center has 10th birthday
## Researchers study learning difficulties 
### DENNIS FRANKS 
The Stanford Center for Research and Development in Teaching
(SCRDT) will mark its 10th anniversary today with a reception hosted by
the School of Education.
The center conducts research on teaching methods in elementary and
secondary schools, ways of improving school organization to improve
teaching, and teaching in bilingual and bicultural settings.
The center is currently conducting a major technical assistance project
in 26 poverty-area school sites. A new joint project with a San Jose school
involves teachers and community members in researching problem solv
ing methods.
Center members include faculty from the School of Education and the
Sociology Department. They are aided by graduate student research assis
tants and supporting staff.
SCRDT, established under U.S. Office of Education sponsorship, began
its work in a Welch Road office building. Quarters in the school of Educa
tion building and rented space in Palo Alto schools supplemented the tight
accommodations.
The present $4 million building, next to the law school, has been the
headquarters for staff members since 1972. It was constructed with federal
funds.
From a funding base of approximately $750,000 in 1965 from the Office
of Education and a grant from the Kettering Foundation, SCRDT support
has grown to nearly $2 million for this fiscal year.
"The past 10 years have seen real changes in education R&D (research
and development) — changes perhaps not as rapid as some critics might
have wished, but nevertheless impressive to those of us profesionally
involved in education," Education School Dean Arthur Coladarci said.
Many prominent educators from state, local and private agencies, as
well as members of the Stanford community, will attend the reception
today from 4 to 6 in the SCRDT building.
