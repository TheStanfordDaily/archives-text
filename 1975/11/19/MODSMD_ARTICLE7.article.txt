Stanford Stadium may be the site of
a rock concert this year that will fea
ture some of "the largest talents in the
world," ASSU Financial Manager
Chris Cline said last night.
"Feelers" have been sent out and
some responses received for such an
event in the "100,000-seat facility,"
Cline said on KZSU's Campus
Conference. He did not name any of
the "talents."
ASSU Special Events, which hand
les concerts, has not been making the
"big bucks" it did last year, and has
"experienced a slight loss," said Cline.
"This is due to advertising spending
overruns," he admitted. "It was proba
bly my fault or (Special Events Direc
tor) Randy Phillips' fault for not over
seeing the spending."
Ticket prices for students may "re
main high," he continued. "Students
want and demand superstar talent. We
want to bring in the best and you can't
do it without high ticket prices."
The Steven Stills concert this Satur

day in Maples Pavilion "will probably
make some money" for the ASSU, he
claimed.
Cline said he anticipates a
$7000-8000 profit on the Stills concert,
which "is about what we expected."
But, he added, "This is provided we
have a sellout. As it is now, we are
2000 tickets short of a sellout, but ex
pect to sell them by the weekend."
Other new ASSU projects under
consideration include the possibility
of opening a food concession or ice
cream parlor on campus.
Because of "severe space con
straints" at Tresidder Memorial Union
and possible "food-retailing competi
tion" from the Transition, Cline said
such a project could not be located in
Tresidder. He mentioned the possibil
ity of housing the new operations in
the Stanford Boathouse.
The Boathouse
Commenting on the status of the
Boathouse, Cline said that $15,000
from the ASSU reserve fund was
matched by $15,000 from the provost's
plant renovation fund to "bring the
Boathouse up to safety standards."
Cline said another fee assessment
may be upcoming to raise the $4000
necessary to "improve the Boathouse
over the minimum standards."
Asked whether the ASSU was con
sidering opening a campus pub, Cline
replied that Tresidder "beat the
ASSU" to declaring an "intent to sell
alcoholic beverages."
Complete ASSU takeover of the
Transition's food operation would be
costly, said Cline.
"I haven't really looked at it seri
ously and I don't think the ASSU
would like to have such an albatross
around its neck."
'Big Bucks'
Responding to questions about the
ASSU's "big bucks" orientation in re
cent months, Cline said, "The ASSU
has only been a profit-making organi
zation over the last two years." He
claimed this did not show a "trend"
towards money-making.
Cline added, however, that "if we
make profits this year, this issue will
be reviewed."
The ASSU receives "substantial
amounts" of money from the Dean of
Student Affairs' Office to pay salaries
and Cline predicted that a possible
$40,000 of the subsidy may be cut
within the year.
"What this means is that some pro
jects now operating without paying
overhead will now have to do so," said
Cline.
