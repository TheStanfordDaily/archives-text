# Ford may announce change in NYC policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Ford was reported yesterday to be un
changed "at this hour" in his opposi
tion to pending legislation to aid New
York City.
But Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said
Ford appears to be close to some kind
of aid.
Javits said, after a meeting among
Ford and Republican members of Con
gress from New York, that the federal
government probably would help to
fill New York City's cash flow re
quirements of $1.5 billion for the com
ing year.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said the
President will make a statement today
on New York City, but added that the
"time, place, format and content has
not yet been decided."
Ford has opposed the bills in Con
gress providing federal loan .guaran
tees for New York City, but has indi
cated interest in efforts to develop a
rescue plan under which the city
would need short-term money for sea
sonal reasons.
Cash crunch in Philly
Meanwhile, the city of Philadelphia
faced a cash crunch after it failed to sell
$25 million in general obligation
bonds.
Money from the sale of the 20-year
bonds, to sell at interest as high as 9.5
percent, was to be used for operating
expenses. But there were no takers on
the bonds and City Finance Director
Lennox Moak blamed the bond failure
on New York City's fiscal crisis.
Ford against bail-out
At the White House, Nessen said
Ford's position on the New York City
crisis "at this hour is precisely what it
was Nov. 13." Ford said on that date
that there would be no federal bailout
of New York City and suggested that
the federal bankruptcy laws be revised
so the city could file for reorganiza
tion.
Ford has said the city and state
should take vigorous action to handle

the matter.
A compromise House bill providing
financial aid for New York City was
worked out over the weekend.
The compromise
It would extend New York City $3
billion in loan guarantees, with a
seven-year limit, and restrict the
amount of federal rulings on day-to
day operations of New York City.
An administration source said
Monday night that Ford is leaning to
ward a $2.5 billion, short-term meas
ure.

amount of federal rulings on day-to
day operations of New York City.
An administration source said
Monday night that Ford is leaning to
ward a $2.5 billion, short-term meas
ure.
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Ford was reported yesterday to be un
changed "at this hour" in his opposi
tion to pending legislation to aid New
York City.
But Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said
Ford appears to be close to some kind
of aid.
Javits said, after a meeting among
Ford and Republican members of Con
gress from New York, that the federal
government probably would help to
fill New York City's cash flow re
quirements of $1.5 billion for the com
ing year.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said the
President will make a statement today
on New York City, but added that the
"time, place, format and content has
not yet been decided."
Ford has opposed the bills in Con
gress providing federal loan .guaran
tees for New York City, but has indi
cated interest in efforts to develop a
rescue plan under which the city
would need short-term money for sea
sonal reasons.
Cash crunch in Philly
Meanwhile, the city of Philadelphia
faced a cash crunch after it failed to sell
$25 million in general obligation
bonds.
Money from the sale of the 20-year
bonds, to sell at interest as high as 9.5
percent, was to be used for operating
expenses. But there were no takers on
the bonds and City Finance Director
Lennox Moak blamed the bond failure
on New York City's fiscal crisis.
Ford against bail-out
At the White House, Nessen said
Ford's position on the New York City
crisis "at this hour is precisely what it
was Nov. 13." Ford said on that date
that there would be no federal bailout
of New York City and suggested that
the federal bankruptcy laws be revised
so the city could file for reorganiza
tion.
Ford has said the city and state
should take vigorous action to handle

the matter.
A compromise House bill providing
financial aid for New York City was
worked out over the weekend.
The compromise
It would extend New York City $3
billion in loan guarantees, with a
seven-year limit, and restrict the
amount of federal rulings on day-to
day operations of New York City.
An administration source said
Monday night that Ford is leaning to
ward a $2.5 billion, short-term meas
ure.
