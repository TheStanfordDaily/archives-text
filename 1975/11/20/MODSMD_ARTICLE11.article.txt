# 'Dog Day' highlights isolation
## 
### Howard Baldwin 
Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (John
Cazale, Pacino's brother in The
Godfather, Parts I and II) attempt
to rob a small bank in Brooklyn
with all the finesse of Laurel and
Hardy.
Sonny, and ex-convict and a
homosexual, has reached the
end of his financial rope and
needs money for his boyfriend's
sex-change operation. The
homosexuality angle is handled
with appropriate reverence and
tastefulness, though.
Sonny bungles the robbery,
and the law quickly forms a
Sugarland Express-type cordon
around the bank, in which
Sonny and Sal are holding the
employes hostage.

Director Sidney Lumet and
actor A 1 Pacino took the true
story of a unique and uncorrup
tible New York police officer
named Frank Serpico and turned
it into a moving and memorable
motion picture.
Now, for a second time, tbey
have taken the story of real peo
ple and turned it into a fascinat
ing character study of men and
the inflexible society they are
forced to live in.
Dog Day Afternoon is the story
of a bank robbery that almost oc
curred one hot August afternoon
(when Sirius, the Dog Star, is
closest to the earth, increasing
the temperature) in 1973.

The tense negotiations that
relay back and forth between
Sonny inside and Moretti
(Charles Durning), the cop out
side, are only the facade for an
underlying theme of Dog Day A f
ternoon. It emphasizes every
time Moretti must repeat his or
ders to his policemen the lack of
communication in this world.
One wonders when Sonny is
speaking by phone to his wife,
his boyfriend and his mother
how they manage to live in such
total unresponsiveness to
eachother's words and feelings.
Each of them speaks as if he
were talking to a wall, not ex
pecting answers but just want
ing to be listened to.
Lumet has expertly woven his
social message about communi
cation in among the fascinating
progress of the robbery,so neatly
as to be completely acceptable
and unobtrusive. He has out
done himself.
Working with a very touchy
subject, he makes the audience
care about the two lovers trying
to survive in a dynamic world
that often moves too quickly for
them. In their telephone conver
sations, full of pain and selfish
ness, all sexual distinctions dis
appear and they seem to us two
lovers unable to live both with or
without each other.
Three of the actors stand out
among fantastic performances.
Pacino's Sonny is no less great
than his portrayals of Michael
Corleone, Frank Serpico and
Lion in Scarecrow. He captures
the intelligence, frenzy and
naivete of the character super
bly.
Durning's Moretti is so
human, so natural, that the actor
deserves far more recognition
than he now has. A Best Sup
porting Actor nomination is in
order. Penny Allen, as the bank's
head teller is stupendous.
The"R"rating is mostly due to
a lot of profanity, which most of
the 8-year-olds I know use regu
larly.
