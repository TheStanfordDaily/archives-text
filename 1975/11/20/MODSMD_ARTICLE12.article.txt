# Mozart festival should be a treat

### Richard Cross 
Persons attending the final
days of this year's San Francisco
Symphony Mozart Festival
should be in for a treat. Tonight's
performance at De Anza's Flint
Center and tomorrow's at San
Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts
will feature "The Impresario,"
narrated by Peter Schickele, the
famed PDQ Bach.
The festival has presented a

different program of Mozart
works each week since Nov. 6.
At the first one, renowned vio
linist Alexander Schneider pres
ided over a delectatious evening
of the brighter side of Mozart.
Schneider, who was second
violinist with the Budapest
String Quartet for 34 years and
co-founder (with Pablo Casals)
of the Prades, France, summer
festivals, doubled as conductor
and soloist all evening.
The evening began with
Schneider conducting a string
ensemble in the Serenade in G
Major, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.
The symphony's performance of
this extremely popular work was
perhaps their weakest of the
evening.
Schneider's interpretation
was big and vigorous, but it was

troubled by some rather glafing
intonation problems in the vio
lins and an overall failure of the
ensemble's sections to find the
unison so necessary in the per
formance of this piece.
In the next work Schneider
tookup his violin and was joined
by the principal oboist and the
full symphony in the merry Di
vertimento in D Major (K 251).
Schneider, conducting the or
chestra from his soloist's chair,
played and conducted with un
matched vigor and profes
sionalism.
His own solos were lucid and
commanding, a joy to hear. The
oboist had a sweet tone and
counterpointed Schneider's
solos admirably.
After the intermission the
symphony settled down to the

rather more serious Concerto for
Flute, Harp and Orchestra in C
Major, which was composed in
Paris midway in Mozart's life
and incorporates elements of the
musical scene in that city in the
late 18th century.
Soloists were Paul Renzi,
flutist, and Anne Adams, harpist
â€” both accomplished virtuosos.
Their solos, and the sensitivity
with which they were com
plemented by the symphony.

produced the most striking re
sult of the evening. The graceful
andantino was especially
noteworthy.
The concert concluded with
the whimsical and less well
known Six German Dances,
which were composed during
the last four years of Mozart's
life. These little pieces show
Mozart making witty and fetch
ing use of the popular court and
salon music of the time.
