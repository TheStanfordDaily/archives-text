# CBS' ax chops out a winner

### John Staley 
Beacon Hill is dead. After two
months of a doomed struggle for
survival, the show has been axed
by CBS. Switch will take its
Tuesday 10 p.m. slot.
Beacon Hill will be missed,
not so much for its variable qual
ity, but for its overall unusual
character. It was refeshingly dif
ferent from all of the usual cop
and doctor programs which
monopolize the network prog
ramming schedules.
Patterned after the popular
British Upstairs, Downstairs
series, the show tried to intert
wine the lives of an upper class
Boston family of the '20s with
those of their staff of servants.
Once in a while, it was success
ful; often it was not. But the Las
siter household was almost al
ways entertaining all the same.
The creators of the program
painstakingly tried to recreate
the atmosphere of the period.
Critics questioned the authentic
ity of their results. Perhaps they
were right; perhaps the atmos
phere was overdone and not
completely realistic. But, even if
this is true, in the end the atmos
phere did provide the viewer
with a fascinating glimpse into
that decade.
The real blame for the show's
artistic failure, though, should
be placed on the script writers.
They took interesting, complex
characters and put them into
dull, soap opera-type plots. Ben
jamin and Mary Lassiter, their
offspring and their servants were
all trapped in stagnant situations
which gave them no room to de
velop as characters.
As the essence of the program
was its people, they all suffo
cated for lack of fresh material,
and took the quality of the show
with them.
According toCBS head Robert
Wood, the network regarded
Beacon Hill as a "bold prog
ramming experiment." Whether
it really was is irrelevant. What
is important is that CBS may
now be discouraged from trying
any more experiments. In its
place, the network may now give
us more Tony Orlando and
Dawns and Medical Centers.
That is too bad.
Recent Nielsen ratings
showed Beacon Hill near the
bottom of the list of network
shows. One really wonders
about the taste of the American
public when they consistently
put Phyllis near the top of the
list.
Even with their faults, the Las
siters will be missed.
