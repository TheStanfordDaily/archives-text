# Surfing revival
## The
						beach music of the early '60s makes a return 
### Jim Tranquada 
During my first week at college, when 1
told people where I was from, they invari
ably smiled and said, "Pasadena — Little
Old Ladies, right?"
The Beach Blanket Bingo image of
California has never really disappeared —
"surfers riding their wild boards, and
sun-kissed bikini belles lolling on golden
sands." The mystical Surf City of Spring
1964 lives on. when Jan and Dean's "The
Little Old Lady From Pasadena" was
number three on the charts and the Beach
Boys ruled the waves.
Three or four years ago, if a person
foolishly announced he liked the Beach
Boys, he was immediately labeled as un
sophisticated and musically simple
minded. This summer the Beach Boys,
with Chicago, made an almost triumphal
tour of the United States, playing their
"simple-minded" music to large, en
thusiastic crowds everywhere.
The resurgence of the Beach Boys, and
the type of music they fostered, is partly
because of the general trend of rediscov
ery and re-evaluation of the music of the
'fibs. Rock is no longer so self-consciously
artistic, nor immersed in a search for
deeper meanings.
To the average listener, "surf music" is
the Beach Boys, everything from their
first 1961 single — "Surfin* " — to "Cood
Vibrations," their last big hit in 1966. But
the romantic haze that now surrounds the
music has obscured its origins.
Frowned upon
In the early '60s, at the height of the
craze, the surfing establishment looked

down on beach music. John Severson,
publisher of Surfer magazine, was par
ticularly vocal.
"Ten years ago, surfers were looked up
to as good, clean cut athletes," Severson
said. Then "around 1960, trouble started
with the surfing music. The music has
nothing to do with surfing, and it gave us
a bad name."
Surfing music, like practically every
thing else, was exploitable, and much of
its popularity was self-generated and
crassly commercial. Capitol Records
pushed the Beach Boys' surfer image
mercilessly — long after it had ceased to
be valid. In fact, Dennis Wilson is the only
member of the group who has ever surfed.
Meet the Beatles
Singers like Chubby Checkers and Bo
Diddley cut surfing albums. But by the
time "He's My Blond-Headed Blue-Eyed
Whompie Stompie Surfer Boy" hit the top

of the Australian charts, early in 1964,
another group called the Beatles was ar
riving on the scene.
The market for songs about 94-year-old
ladies in one-piece topless bathing suits
hadvanished. Nikolas Venet, the Beach
Boys' first producer, told what it was like.
"Lots of people kept trending them.
Like, 'That's a hit. that's it, hut now that's
out.' That was a lot of shit." he said.
"They would say. 'Well, surfing is off.
you know, dead — or car stuff is dead.' "
But the Beach Boys, inextricably linked
with summer and the beach by those first
early years — 1961 to 1964 had created a
timeless, untouchable land of escape.
The Beach Boys have served as the nuc
leus of the surf revival. Even without re
leasing a new album in over two years,
they have become one of America's top
touring groups. Two compilations of old
ies, Endless Summer and Spirit of

America, have done extremely well.
Johnny Rivers' remake of "Help Me
Rhonda" took off on the charts this sum
mer.
The Troggs have a strange new version
of "Good Vibrations," and Flash Cadillac
and the Continental Kids have followed
the trend in their newest album.
The national resurgence of the
"California sound" has led to a more local
phenomenon: All the old instrumental
bands are enjoying a new popularity.
Dick Dale and the Del Tones are the pre
mier band of this type.
For three years, Dale. "King of the Surf
Guitar." played at the legendary Re
ndezvous Ballroom in Balboa, pulling in
more than 4000 people a night. Dale,
along with contemporaries like the Sur
faris. the Challengers and the Marketts,
made a comeback two years ago at the
