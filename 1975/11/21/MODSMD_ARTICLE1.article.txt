Fraternity members went to
work yesterday on the Big Game
Bonfire, implanting six telephone
poies in the Lake Lagunita bed to
serve as a frame for the 25-foot
structure.
Round-the-clock construction
and guarding will continue until
the blaze is lit at 7 tonight, follow
ing a 6:30 p.m. rally. (Bonfire or
ganizers originally had indicated a
7 p.m. start).
Pete Lazetich, defensive star of
the 1972 Rose Bowl win over
Michigan, is scheduled to deliver
the history of the Axe.
Following the rally, the Stanford
Band will depart for San
Francisco's Nob Hill, playing there
until 8:30 and then marching to
Ghiradelli Square.
