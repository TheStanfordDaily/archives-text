# Democratic nomination: some scenarios
## 
### 
With Alabama Gov. George
Wallace's long-anticipated de
claration last week as a candi
date for President, the number of
Democratic presidential hope
fuls reached ten. Since this is
likely to be the maximum
number who will compete
through early spring, it is
worthwhile to see how things
are now shaping up.
For unrepentant McGover
nites, the situation appears very
dismal indeed. All signs point to
a conservative Democratic
nominee.
One measure of a campaign's
health is the amount of money
raised. Two campaigns' bank
balances presently outstrip all
others by a wide margin.
Jackson hinds
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.)
has a bank balance over $1.25
million and still rising.
Wallace's fund-raising opera
tion has never completely stop
ped since 1968. It features both
merchandising of such items as
t-shirts and hats, and strident
mail appeals.
The Wallace balance is cur
rently estimated at three
quarters of a million dollars, and
now that he is a declared candi
date it will likely leap higher.
It is worth noting that these
figures represent only money in
the bank.
Jackson and Wallace have al
ready spent over $2 million
between them. Each has,
for example, paid for an impres
sive media stockpile.
Starving campaigns
By contrast, the other eight
campaigns are starving for dol
lars. Each has raised an average
of less than a half-million dol
lars, and has spent almost the en
tire amount just to keep going.
Wallace and Jackson presently
rank one-two in both name rec
ognition and popularity surveys
among announced candidates.
The other candidates lag far be
hind, and without money are
going to find improving their
standings enormously difficult.
In the wake of Watergate,
Congress voted to provide fed
eral matching funds to candi
dates. One must raise $5000 in at
least 20 states through indi
vidual contributions of under

$250 to qualify for these funds.
Above this $100,000 floor,
candidates' small contributions
are matched dollar-for-dollar up
to five million dollars. These
funds will be available begin
ning Jan. 1, and it appears all 10
will qualify.
However, these infusions of
money are not likely to close the
existing dollar gap between
Jackson and Wallace, and the
other candidates. Wallace is
likely to get the most matching
money, and Jackson will get a lot
as well.
Furthermore, many of the
other candidates have already
"spent" their matching funds.
Rep. Morris Udall, (D-Ariz.) for
example, has arranged to pay
this year's bills upon receipt of
his matching funds next year.
Bentsen campaign
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas)
has also been spending more
than he's taking in. He now has
less than $200,000 on hand and
this sum is rapidly being de
pleted.
Even for those who have not
already promised their matching
funds to creditors, it is estimated
that matching funds will only
provide enough money to get
through the first three primaries:
New Hampshire, Massachusetts
and Florida.
Attention is likely to be fo
cused on the Republican race in
New Hampshire, especially with
Wallace staying out. Therefore,
the Democratic winner there is
not likely to reap the publicity
bonus like that received by
McCarthy in 1968 and by
McGovern in 1972.
Wallace prospects
The following two primary
states are ones in which Wallace
has solid prospects of getting
either a victory or a narrow de
feat.
In the light of these facts, Jack
son has adopted a "layback"

strategy. He will make a substan
tial effort in Massachusetts, but
will make no other strong bid
until Pennsylvania's April 27
primary.
Jackson hopes to beat Wallace
in Massachusetts, while the
other hopefuls are crushed by
Wallace and exhaust their funds
in early primaries: e.g.,Sanford
in North Carolina, Carter in
Florida, Udall in Wisconsin.
Only candidate
Thus, Jackson will proclaim
himself the only candidate who
can beat Wallace; and he hopes
to go on to prove it by winning in
California, New Jersey , Ohio,
Maryland and Michigan.
Waiting anxiously for Jackson
to falter, especially in Maryland
and Michigan, is Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.). He has re
portedly decided to enter the
California primary in case
Jackson's momentum is stopped
before June, at which time Hum
phrey will pick up the anti-
Wallace banner.
Of course, a lot could happen

in the next six months to wreck a
Jackson or Humphrey scenario.
Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho),
expected to announce his candi
dacy in January, could avoid the
early bloodletting due to his late
start and emerge in the middle
and late primaries as a liberal al
ternative.
Nevertheless, the conclusion
is inescapable that it will be
next-to-impossible for a liberal
candidate to emerge McGovern
like from the present field.
A recent development bolsters
this conclusion: New York Gov.
Hugh Carey is keeping every
body away from the April 6 New
York primary by running as a
favorite son in this historically
liberal state.
Faced with the prospect of
choosing between Wallace and
Jackson or Humphrey, at the
New York convention, liberals
can only gnash their teeth and
pray for deliverance.
