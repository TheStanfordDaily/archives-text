The United Nation's General
Assembly's decision to adopt an
anti-Zionism resolution was
aimed at deploring the political
manifestation of that concept in
the Middle East which led to the
expulsion of the Palestinian
people from their homes and
their continued dispersion and
exile.
The wrong which was done to
these people needs to be righted.
Nothing can be further from
the truth than asserting that this
resolution constitutes an or
ganized attack on Judaism as a
religion or the followers of the
Jewish faith as people.
The Arabs — both Muslims
and Christians — have lived to
gether with the people of the
Jewish faith for centuries.
The Muslim people share
many spiritual and cultural links
with them.
We do recognize and respect
Jewish contributions to human
progress.
Our hands are not guilty of the
holocaust which the Jewish
people suffered during the pres
ent century nor for their age-old
sufferings from prejudice and
racist arrogance.

The Nov. 19 Daily contained a
column about the behavior of the
Kappa Alpha (KA) pledges at
Meyer Library last Thursday
evening.
I felt a bit guilty because, as a
pledge of another fraternity, 1
went into Meyer Friday evening
dressed as a "nerd." I had to lead
a cheer praising our house, and
then I was carried out on the
others' shoulders.
After reading the article, 1
realized that my actions surely
offended these groups:
—nerds, because of my ap
pearance,
—the fraternities, since the
cheer I led was clean,
—Native Americans, because I
surely offended them in some
way, and
—the two graduate student
girls who wrote the letter about
the KAs, because I acted like an
asshole.
