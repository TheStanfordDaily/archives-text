# Respect Indian heritage

In 1970, when 22 Native American under
graduates and five graduate students enrolled at
Stanford University for the first time, of im
mediate concern to these students was the degrad
ing image of Native Americans which was perpet
rated by the Stanford Indian symbol.
The students met with members of the Univer
sity administration, athletic department, books
tore, bike shop, band, dollies and other campus
groups. The students' purpose was to inform the
University community that the symbol should be
abolished because, despite the honorable inten
tions cited by supporters, use of the symbol was a
racist statement about Indian peoples in America.
Aside from the humor (good natured or not) of
caricatures, racism, intentional or not, lies in the
stereotype of the "dignified" or "noble" Indian.
First, characteristics of dignity or nobleness are
inherent to individuals, not bestowed on persons
or groups by others.
Second, just as all Jews are not thrifty, and all
whites are not college educated, all Indians are
not blessed with being noble. More importantly to
us, the gloss of the "dignified" or "noble" Indian
ignores the ignoble treatment of Indians by white,
black, brown or yellow immigrants, past and pre
sent.
Some campus groups and others, such as some
alumni, advocate return of the Stanford Indian

symbol or mascot.
In our attempt to educate others on this issue we
again take precious time away from our studies. It
is these studies which we hope will prepare us to
eventually improve economic, social, and legal
situations of our peoples.
Present Native American students at Stanford,
and many native groups in this area, deplore the
idea of returning to the insensitive use of the Stan
ford Indian symbol.
This symbol represents the dehumanization of
Indian people today, in favor of a Hollywood
image. This is not the way we were and not the
way we are now.
In addition to racial aspects, religious concepts
are at issue. What some people apparently do not
realize is the sacredness of many things to Indian
people.
To witness the secularization of our dances and
songs is the most commercial ridicule we are
asked to endure. Be assured we do not make light
of Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or other religions;
we only ask others not to dishonor our religious
concerns by making them secular symbols.
We have rightful heritages which are revered;
they are being destroyed by exploitation when
taken out of context.

we only ask others not to dishonor our religious
concerns by making them secular symbols.
We have rightful heritages which are revered;
they are being destroyed by exploitation when
taken out of context.

In 1970, when 22 Native American under
graduates and five graduate students enrolled at
Stanford University for the first time, of im
mediate concern to these students was the degrad
ing image of Native Americans which was perpet
rated by the Stanford Indian symbol.
The students met with members of the Univer
sity administration, athletic department, books
tore, bike shop, band, dollies and other campus
groups. The students' purpose was to inform the
University community that the symbol should be
abolished because, despite the honorable inten
tions cited by supporters, use of the symbol was a
racist statement about Indian peoples in America.
Aside from the humor (good natured or not) of
caricatures, racism, intentional or not, lies in the
stereotype of the "dignified" or "noble" Indian.
First, characteristics of dignity or nobleness are
inherent to individuals, not bestowed on persons
or groups by others.
Second, just as all Jews are not thrifty, and all
whites are not college educated, all Indians are
not blessed with being noble. More importantly to
us, the gloss of the "dignified" or "noble" Indian
ignores the ignoble treatment of Indians by white,
black, brown or yellow immigrants, past and pre
sent.
Some campus groups and others, such as some
alumni, advocate return of the Stanford Indian

symbol or mascot.
In our attempt to educate others on this issue we
again take precious time away from our studies. It
is these studies which we hope will prepare us to
eventually improve economic, social, and legal
situations of our peoples.
Present Native American students at Stanford,
and many native groups in this area, deplore the
idea of returning to the insensitive use of the Stan
ford Indian symbol.
This symbol represents the dehumanization of
Indian people today, in favor of a Hollywood
image. This is not the way we were and not the
way we are now.
In addition to racial aspects, religious concepts
are at issue. What some people apparently do not
realize is the sacredness of many things to Indian
people.
To witness the secularization of our dances and
songs is the most commercial ridicule we are
asked to endure. Be assured we do not make light
of Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or other religions;
we only ask others not to dishonor our religious
concerns by making them secular symbols.
We have rightful heritages which are revered;
they are being destroyed by exploitation when
taken out of context.
