# Mascot issue divides senate
## 
### JACK VAUGHN 
Two weeks ago, those with most to lose in
seeing a tradition end sat at the back> of the
ASSU Senate, drinking Michelob and jeering
their opponents. They lost.
Last Monday, those with most to lose in se
eing a tradition revived sat in the same spot
and told the senate that "ignorance seems to be
an excuse here â€” an excuse for racism."They
won.
The first group was made up of fraternity
men who staged an impromptu beer party as
they watched the senate recommend to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons that the Big Game
Bonfire run by the fraternities be discon
tinued.
Lyons decided, after getting other views on
the event and discussing with Bonfire officials
how best to phase out the fire gradually, that he
would reduce tonight's blaze to 35 percent of
its original strength.
The second group was a delegation of Native
Ameicans, affiliated with the Native American
Cultural Center, who helped move the senate
to denounce the effort by an alumni group, the
New Founders' League, to restore the Indian
mascot.
In trying to shelve the Indian, however, the
senate blurred an already confused situation in
which three separate polls of the student body
are planned, none of which has a binding
effect on the new mascot's identity.
The first, a Daily poll printed inside
tomorrow's Big Game football issue, will in
clude ideas submitted by students and Daily
staffers, excluding the Indian. The winner will
be used by the Daily to identify University
athletic teams, regardless of the athletic
department's decision on adopting the change.
The Daily poll has the advantage that it in
cludes faculty, staff, students, alumni and
other game-going friends of the University in
its decision.
But the Daily poll leaves out the large por
tion of the student body which for whatever
reason won't be going to the Big Game.
In attempting to get the entire student opin
ion, the senate decided to hold a referendum
on Dec, 3-4 which would include ideas
brought to a committee of senators, fraternity
men, Daily and KZSU staffers, Band represen
tatives and ex officio members from the Coun
cil of Presidents and the athletic department.
Again, the Indian would not be a choice.
In addition to these two attempts to find a
new mascot, a group of conservative students
is circulating a petition, requiring five percent
of the students' signature, to place the return of
the Indian as a separate issue on the November
special election ballot.
This third poll, similar to one taken in 1972,
when the ASSU first withdrew its support for
the Indian, will probably have little effect.
President Richard Lyman, has said he will not
allow the Indian back, and there is a wide
spread feeling in the senate that the Indian's
return is not "a democratic issue," as Sen. Tim
Cullinane said Monday.
Other senators, whose feelings may not be so
strong, see the Indian as a dead issue. "I think
we would be banging our heads against the
wall if we t-ry to bring back the Indian," said
Sen. Tim Conway, who will be on the ASSU
mascot selection committee.
But conservative senate members, such as

Sen. Bob Ottilie and senate alternates Dan
Livingston and Dave Sharp, believe the stu
dent body should decide the matter. Bitterly
assailed by Native American representativs for
promoting "racism" in the senate, the conser
vatives continued to press the body to avoid
making a statement on the matter and allow the
upcoming vote attest to student feelings.
"You (Indian mascot opponents) seem to
think that because you have the power in the
student body right now, you have the right to
tell the rest of us what to think," Livingston
charged. "The student body has the right to
decide what the mascot will be, no matter how
detestable you think that choice is."
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum has said
that, while the Senate has a geat deal of author
ity in ASSU decision-making, it has very little
in determining University policy. Lyons' deci
sion to allow the Bonfire to continue in the face
of Senate opposition brought that point home
to the members. As a result, the Senate passed a
hastily-composed resolution expressing its
"disgust" with Lyons' decision. Like the first
resolution, however, it will have little effect on
tonight's event.
Again, in the debate over the Indian, the
senate was forced to realize that, whatever the
result of its upcoming poll, it is up to the athle
tic department and Lyman to decide the ques
tion. Indeed, the ASSU election has less im
mediate effect than the football issue Daily
poll, which will at least determine how Uni
versity teams are referred to in the newspaper.
The senate's strongest roadblocks are inter
nal, however. Ottilie, Livingston and Sharp
oppose any senate action on issues where the
student body as a whole can be polled. They
realize that, on many issues which transcend
normal ASSU affairs, such as Bonfire pollution
and Indian racism, they will be in the minority
in the senate. At the same time, they feel the
student body as a whole is behind them.

This group wins its greatest support when
the senate takes up issues suBh as the de
nouncement of the National Security Agency
or the United Nations Zionism resolution. As
Sen. Chris Suczek said Monday, "I don't feel at
all qualified to decide on issues which do not
involve University business and are definitely
a matter of personal opinion."
Though the senate's resolution on Zionism
passed over this objection, several senators
have voiced their opposition to the senate's
involvement in national affairs. They feel both
unwilling to commit the student body and
powerless to effect any change in policy made
in Washington through ASSU action.
The senate is also beginning to feel that
sense of weakness in effecting any change at
the University.
