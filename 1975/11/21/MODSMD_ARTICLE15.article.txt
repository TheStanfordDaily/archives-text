# Elitism charged
## Aid policy attack strategy planned 
### BERT BOWER 
Stanford's admissions and financial aids
policies have traditionally been created and
controlled by the administration with little or
no student input.
However, far from critically evaluating the
administration's performance, contented stu
dents have eased into their Stanford education
with the attitude, "Well I've gotten in, who the
hell cares about the University's policies?"
But, according to the Howard Report, there
may be a lot more to care about than meets the
eye.
Admissions, the report contends, is a near
monopoly in the hands of Admissions Dean
Fred Hargadon, who has screened out numbers
of creative, free thinking individuals and has

created an "ivory tower environment" at Stan
ford.
Furthermore, student aid policies tend to
discriminate against lower class backgrounds
by offering large financial inducements to stu
dents from comfortable, middle class back
grounds, according to the report.
Will the wall crumble?
The report is a crack in the near impregnable
walls of the University's admissions and fi
nancial aid structure. Whether that crack will
widen and finally expose the inner workings
of University policies, or whether it will
quickly and efficiently be patched up by a pro
tective administration,largely depends on the
skill of the report's authors to mobilize support
and present a viable argument to the Stanford
community.
The first challenge facing the small nucleus
of students behind the investigation is to edu
cate students and faculty on the details and
polemic nature of their proposals.These inc
lude reducing the admissions power of a few
administrators by setting up an admissions
committee of students, faculty and adminis
trators, eliminating all discriminatory
categories in the financial aid structure and
removing the confidentially of high school re
cruiting.
Political conclusions
When Hargadon criticized these proposals
as "totally political" he was not mistaken. The
very nature of the report's conclusions is
political in that they threaten the status quo
with some basic structural changes.
Hargadon is justifiably squeamish about the
proposals; any suggestion that his control be
lessened and the policies he has helped form
be challenged is certainly threatening.
But before Hargadon and other adminis
trators are faced with serious pressures to
change University policy, consciousness
must be raised. Undoubtedly the biggest obsta
cle to overcome is an inert student body. Where
will support be found among a self-satisfied
group of students?
The minority community should be a source
of strength, especially the well organized Stu

dents for Equity group. The proposals of the
report include increasing minority student
population and decreasing self-help to
minorities.
Incremental change bores
Radical groups, such as the Alliance for Rad
ical Change, might support an effort to change
University policy. But as the proposals are re
formist, not revolutionary, it is questionable
whether radicals will put much effort
into what they see as half way measures.
An endorsement of the Howard Report in the
ASSU Senate would greatly enhance the valid
ity of efforts to change the existing structure.
The report may face rough ground in the
Budget Committee, especially from Sen. Kevin
McDermottwho is weary of Senate reform, but
ultimately the report is sure to be endorsed by
the progressive sector of the Senate.
If the reform movement fails to gain the sup
port of students who are more concerned with
their individual goals than the goal of a diver
sified student body, it will most likely turn to
the faculty.
By convincing the faculty that they no longer
have control over admission and student aid
policies which determine the social fabric of
their university, some support may be gained.
Direction of effort
Most likely this effort will be directed to
wards the Committee on Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aids (C —UAFA). But
it C—UAFA members can bear the brunt
of criticism and be convinced that their power
is minimal as long as Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff dominate the
committee, as the report contends, the possi
bility of winning their support is highly feasi
ble.
Wherever reformers gain support it will only
be after an uphill battle. Social change in a
selective university such as Stanford, where
the attitude of academic superiority is pre
dominate, will require tremendousamountsol
energy.
As Hargadon pointed out: "They (the au
thors of the report) want a different university
academically. But students come here because
this is not an average university."

no student input.
However, far from critically evaluating the
administration's performance, contented stu
dents have eased into their Stanford education
with the attitude, "Well I've gotten in, who the
hell cares about the University's policies?"
But, according to the Howard Report, there
may be a lot more to care about than meets the
eye.
Admissions, the report contends, is a near
monopoly in the hands of Admissions Dean
Fred Hargadon, who has screened out numbers
of creative, free thinking individuals and has

created an "ivory tower environment" at Stan
ford.
Furthermore, student aid policies tend to
discriminate against lower class backgrounds
by offering large financial inducements to stu
dents from comfortable, middle class back
grounds, according to the report.
Will the wall crumble?
The report is a crack in the near impregnable
walls of the University's admissions and fi
nancial aid structure. Whether that crack will
widen and finally expose the inner workings
of University policies, or whether it will
quickly and efficiently be patched up by a pro
tective administration,largely depends on the
skill of the report's authors to mobilize support
and present a viable argument to the Stanford
community.
The first challenge facing the small nucleus
of students behind the investigation is to edu
cate students and faculty on the details and
polemic nature of their proposals.These inc
lude reducing the admissions power of a few
administrators by setting up an admissions
committee of students, faculty and adminis
trators, eliminating all discriminatory
categories in the financial aid structure and
removing the confidentially of high school re
cruiting.
Political conclusions
When Hargadon criticized these proposals
as "totally political" he was not mistaken. The
very nature of the report's conclusions is
political in that they threaten the status quo
with some basic structural changes.
Hargadon is justifiably squeamish about the
proposals; any suggestion that his control be
lessened and the policies he has helped form
be challenged is certainly threatening.
But before Hargadon and other adminis
trators are faced with serious pressures to
change University policy, consciousness
must be raised. Undoubtedly the biggest obsta
cle to overcome is an inert student body. Where
will support be found among a self-satisfied
group of students?
The minority community should be a source
of strength, especially the well organized Stu

dents for Equity group. The proposals of the
report include increasing minority student
population and decreasing self-help to
minorities.
Incremental change bores
Radical groups, such as the Alliance for Rad
ical Change, might support an effort to change
University policy. But as the proposals are re
formist, not revolutionary, it is questionable
whether radicals will put much effort
into what they see as half way measures.
An endorsement of the Howard Report in the
ASSU Senate would greatly enhance the valid
ity of efforts to change the existing structure.
The report may face rough ground in the
Budget Committee, especially from Sen. Kevin
McDermottwho is weary of Senate reform, but
ultimately the report is sure to be endorsed by
the progressive sector of the Senate.
If the reform movement fails to gain the sup
port of students who are more concerned with
their individual goals than the goal of a diver
sified student body, it will most likely turn to
the faculty.
By convincing the faculty that they no longer
have control over admission and student aid
policies which determine the social fabric of
their university, some support may be gained.
Direction of effort
Most likely this effort will be directed to
wards the Committee on Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aids (C —UAFA). But
it C—UAFA members can bear the brunt
of criticism and be convinced that their power
is minimal as long as Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff dominate the
committee, as the report contends, the possi
bility of winning their support is highly feasi
ble.
Wherever reformers gain support it will only
be after an uphill battle. Social change in a
selective university such as Stanford, where
the attitude of academic superiority is pre
dominate, will require tremendousamountsol
energy.
As Hargadon pointed out: "They (the au
thors of the report) want a different university
academically. But students come here because
this is not an average university."

dents have eased into their Stanford education
with the attitude, "Well I've gotten in, who the
hell cares about the University's policies?"
But, according to the Howard Report, there
may be a lot more to care about than meets the
eye.
Admissions, the report contends, is a near
monopoly in the hands of Admissions Dean
Fred Hargadon, who has screened out numbers
of creative, free thinking individuals and has

created an "ivory tower environment" at Stan
ford.
Furthermore, student aid policies tend to
discriminate against lower class backgrounds
by offering large financial inducements to stu
dents from comfortable, middle class back
grounds, according to the report.
Will the wall crumble?
The report is a crack in the near impregnable
walls of the University's admissions and fi
nancial aid structure. Whether that crack will
widen and finally expose the inner workings
of University policies, or whether it will
quickly and efficiently be patched up by a pro
tective administration,largely depends on the
skill of the report's authors to mobilize support
and present a viable argument to the Stanford
community.
The first challenge facing the small nucleus
of students behind the investigation is to edu
cate students and faculty on the details and
polemic nature of their proposals.These inc
lude reducing the admissions power of a few
administrators by setting up an admissions
committee of students, faculty and adminis
trators, eliminating all discriminatory
categories in the financial aid structure and
removing the confidentially of high school re
cruiting.
Political conclusions
When Hargadon criticized these proposals
as "totally political" he was not mistaken. The
very nature of the report's conclusions is
political in that they threaten the status quo
with some basic structural changes.
Hargadon is justifiably squeamish about the
proposals; any suggestion that his control be
lessened and the policies he has helped form
be challenged is certainly threatening.
But before Hargadon and other adminis
trators are faced with serious pressures to
change University policy, consciousness
must be raised. Undoubtedly the biggest obsta
cle to overcome is an inert student body. Where
will support be found among a self-satisfied
group of students?
The minority community should be a source
of strength, especially the well organized Stu

dents for Equity group. The proposals of the
report include increasing minority student
population and decreasing self-help to
minorities.
Incremental change bores
Radical groups, such as the Alliance for Rad
ical Change, might support an effort to change
University policy. But as the proposals are re
formist, not revolutionary, it is questionable
whether radicals will put much effort
into what they see as half way measures.
An endorsement of the Howard Report in the
ASSU Senate would greatly enhance the valid
ity of efforts to change the existing structure.
The report may face rough ground in the
Budget Committee, especially from Sen. Kevin
McDermottwho is weary of Senate reform, but
ultimately the report is sure to be endorsed by
the progressive sector of the Senate.
If the reform movement fails to gain the sup
port of students who are more concerned with
their individual goals than the goal of a diver
sified student body, it will most likely turn to
the faculty.
By convincing the faculty that they no longer
have control over admission and student aid
policies which determine the social fabric of
their university, some support may be gained.
Direction of effort
Most likely this effort will be directed to
wards the Committee on Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aids (C —UAFA). But
it C—UAFA members can bear the brunt
of criticism and be convinced that their power
is minimal as long as Hargadon and Director of
Financial Aids Robert Huff dominate the
committee, as the report contends, the possi
bility of winning their support is highly feasi
ble.
Wherever reformers gain support it will only
be after an uphill battle. Social change in a
selective university such as Stanford, where
the attitude of academic superiority is pre
dominate, will require tremendousamountsol
energy.
As Hargadon pointed out: "They (the au
thors of the report) want a different university
academically. But students come here because
this is not an average university."

PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE — These ASSU senators are busy discussing the pressing
issues of the University. They not only find themselves divided on the issues, however, Dut they
question how effective the senate really is. Pictured from the left are Sen. Tim Conway, Dan
Livingston, senate alternate, and Senators Bob Ottilie and Elizabeth Larkam.
