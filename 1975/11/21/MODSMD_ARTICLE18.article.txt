## The 						Axe is soon to come out of hiding 
### CHRIS BAKER 
In one corner of the steamy,
ramped Memorial Stadium
ressing room, reporters jostled
ir position, pushing Stanford
icker Mike Langford into his
icker, as he described his Cal
lling kick, for what seemed
ke the 10th time.
And in the other corner, the
ig Game Axe lay unattended —
1 easy target for thieves.
If Gal students had any semb
nce of intelligence, the Axe
ould still be hidden in some
irgotten alcove on the Berkeley
impus, instead of resting com
>rtably in the vault of Wells
argo Bank.
It will be brought out tonight
I the Big Game bonfire, as
hunderchicken Pete Lazetich
icounts the Axe legend.
Billy Erb
Why, Billy Erb would be
roud. Oh, he's the quarterback
ho took us to the 1952 Rose
owl.
No, you're dead wrong. Al
lough Erb's picture doesn't
ang next to Jim Plunkett's, or
ven Mike Gordova's, in the
)otball office, he's done more

for the Big Game than anyone.
It was Erb who started this
nonsense. And 75 years later, the
Axe:
—has been stolen eight times.
—been fought over at sword
point.
—caused cancellation of clas
ses for two days in 1930.
And all this over a 10-pound
broad Axe with a 15-inch blade.
Actually the Axe yell preceeded
the Axe. Since 1896 it had been
used to symbolically taunt Gal.
But after losing the first two
games of a three-game baseball
series to the Bears, Billy Erb
came up with the marvelous idea
of getting a real Axe.
Bonfire ritual
So in 1899, Erb brought an un
sharpened broad Axe to a pre
game bonfire and in a satanic
like ritual chopped np a dummy
bear. Charlie Manson would
have loved it.
Erb took the Axe up to the
game in San Francisco and cut
up blue and gold ribbons in his
idle pre-game hours. During the
game, which Stanford lost 9-7,
Erb walked around giving Gol
den Bear rooters a free sample of

his new improved razor.
After the contest Erb entrusted
the Axe to a group of guards in
cluding former Arizona Sen.
Carl Hayden. They were no
match for a Cal mob which in
cluded Bear football player Paul
Castlehun. The Cal people grab
bed it, then Stanford's Frank

Strout snatched it away momen
tarily, but it was taken from
his hands by Cal "wonder
quarterback" Jim Hooper.
It remained in Berkeley for 31
years, locked in a bank vault and
was brought out for Cal rallies in
an armored car.
Enter the Immortal 21. On

April 3,1930, after three years of
planning, this group returned
the Axe to its rightful owners.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
followed the armed truck back to
the bank, and posing as news
paper photographers, asked the
Cal freshmen guarding the
Trophy to pose for pictures.
But when the flashbulbs went
off, theCal idiots discovered that
they were teargas bombs. The
next day one Berkeley professor
said,"Gentlemen,this shows the
value of chemical warfare."
Howard Avery snatched the
Axe in the confusion which fol
lowed and tossed it into the back
of a rented Hertz car and headed
for the Farm.
Highest award
The Immortal 21 was awarded
the highest award that can be
bestowed upon a Stanford stu
dent — block "S"letters—and
they won the gratitude of all
Stanford alumni.
But Cal students were talking
of violence, and officials from
both schools signed a pact, mak
ing the Axe the Big Game trophy.
Thefts continued occasion
ally, but it was not until two

years ago that another grand
theft occured. Residents of Theta
Delta Chi, calling themselves the
"Infamous Three," imitated Cal
Coach Mike White and asked to
pick up the Axe for photos at the
Big Game luncheon at Ming's
Restaurant.
'Infamous Three'
Dave Silteanu and Tim Con
way arrived at the Cal student
Union, where the Axe is kept in a
nuclear-attack-proof case after
Cal wins, and asked for the Axe.
But the Cal Axe Commission had
taken the Axe down for
safekeeping. The pair convinced
the Union manager to call the
Axe Commission and produce
the Axe.
But there was one hitch. The
Cal people demanded that the
Axe ride in their car. Thinking
fast, Mat Conway, Tim's older
brother, used his last dime to call
for reinforcements at Ming's. But
when the car pulled into Ming's
there were no Theta Delts.
Suddenly they came out from
behind the parked cars and it
was no contest. The Axe was
back and Stanford has kept it
legally ever since.
