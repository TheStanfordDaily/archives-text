## UCLA gets right to dorm room drinking 
### KATHY BATTS 
The right to privacy — at least in respect to drinking — has been
granted to UCLA dormitory residents. Residence hall adminis
trators last week ruled that students' rooms are private and there
fore exempt from a California Business and Professional Code law
that forbids consumption of alcohol by minors in public places.
Although a legal opinion stated that both rooms and hallways are
private, the residence authorities decided hallways still fall under
the legal constraints against providing liquor to minors, the Daily
Bruin said last week.
The new policy allows the consumption of alcohol by all resi
dents in their dorm rooms, and by 21-year-olds in "controlled
situations," which require identification checks and administra
tive approval.
The rule, in effect since Nov. 10, comes after two years of study by
a committee of administrators and dormitory presidents. The resi
dence halls' Policy Review Board took the committee's proposal to
UCLA Vice Chancellor Norman Miller.
The Bruin said the committee had contacted the Los Angeles city
attorney, the UC police department and other UC campuses about
their dorm drinking policies.
