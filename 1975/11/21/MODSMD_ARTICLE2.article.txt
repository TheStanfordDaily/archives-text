# Law tuition surcharge restored

Law School students will begin pay
ing a four to seven percent tuition sur
charge next year above the projected
$4;}(J3 University-wide tuition. The
rise in tuition is due to inflation and
larger costs, according to Assoc. Law
School Dean Keith Mann.
The Law School charged the extra
tuition amount, called a differential,
during the 19605. "When tuition
started rising sharply, we dropped the
differential. Now we're reluctantly re
storing it," Mann said.
The increase in tuition was first an
nounced last spring, and notice of it
was included in letters to this year's
entering Law School class.
"The differential will be used as
operating money, not capital funds,"
explained Mann. He added that none
of this money will be used for the new
law school building.
Due to the University's deficit gap
closing program, the Law School, like
all other departments and schools, has
been cutting its budget since its share
of the general operating funds has
been cut. "We've also tried to raise our
income by restricting the differential
and slightly increasing our student
body," said Mann.
Because of the extra tuition increase,
student financial aid will also rise to
offset the increase, according to Mann.
Mann remarked that the Business
School and the Medical School have
had differentials in effect during the
past years.
Mann said, "Business, medical and
law students are being asked to pay
more in tuition than undergraduates
because of their higher income expec
tations."
The exact amount of the Law School
differential will be announced at the
December Board of Trustees meeting,
when next year's general tuition will
be also be announced.
One of the reasons the differential
was deferred a year "was so that it
would hit our second-year class for
only one year," Mann added.
