SACRAMENTO (AP) — California political
leaders of both parties predicted Ronald Reagan
— who formally entered the race yesterday for
Republican nomination for president — will be a
formidable opponent for President Ford.
Most Democrats were critical of Reagan, as were
some Republicans.
Former San Francisco Mayor George Christ
opher, whom Reagan defeated in the GOP guber
natorial primary of 1966, said he would probably
support "a good Democrat" before endorsing
either Ford or Reagan.
Christopher said Reagan, a two-term California
governor, is "more rhetoric than substance, and a
lot of beautiful cliches that sound good. I wonder
if this is what the Republican party needs."
Can't support Ford
But Christopher said he can't support Ford
either. "I considered Mr. Ford inept, both in
rhetoric and management."
Both Reagan's friends and foes in California
predicted a close race between Ford and Reagan,
with Reagan's campaigning skills overcoming
much of Ford's advantage as the incumbent.
Leaders of both parties emphasized the former
actor's skill as a speaker and campaigner.
One leader of Ford's California campaign, Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger, said that Reagan "is an at
tractive and formidible candidate," but that Ford
will beat Reagan next year.
"I am disappointed he is going to run,"

Younger said of Reagan. "I think that Ford will
win the nomination, but he will have a more dif
ficult time with opposition."
'Shot in the arm'
But state Sen. Dennis Carpenter, co-chairman
with Younger of Ford's California campaign, said
he welcomed "a good primary between two good
candidates. Our party needs a shot in the arm. In
this context, it will be helpful."
He added, "I think the President will win."
Most California Republican leaders still are of
ficially neutral in the Reagan-Ford contest, but
friendly to Reagan.
"He represents a viewpoint of concern about
the way in which the federal government is in
truding in the lives of citizens," said George
Deukmejian, GOP floor leader in the state Senate.
Presenting viewpoint
"He will be articulating that viewpoint proba
bly better than any other political leader in the
country."
Former California Gov. Edmund G. "Pat"
Brown, the Democratic incumbent in 1966, lost to
Reagan by one million votes despite a 15 percent
Democratic registration edge.
"1 think Ronald Reagan should be the favorite
despite Ford's incumbency. Reagan is a very ef
fective campaigner, as I discovered," said Brown.
"1 think Reagan is a very sincere man and a very
honest man. But I think his election as president
would be very tragic," he added.
