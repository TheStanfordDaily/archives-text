# 'Daily' welcomes its alumni home
## 
### 
Tonight, for the first time in more than 40 years, (according to
an old-time editor) the Daily is holding a reunion. To com
memorate the occasion, which will bring back staffers from as
far back as 1923, we've assembled eight of the more memor
able front pages of our 84 years.
The first selection is, of course, the 1906 earthquake, which
was the biggest story ever run in the old Daily Palo Alto (called
the "Dippy"). By 1928, Stanford was old enough to have one of
its grads become President - and celebrated accordingly.
Other pages recall the great day in 1930 that Stanford
stole ... er, regained, the axe after 31 years in Berkeley; the
biggest scoop of the Scandal Boys of '38; the invasion of
Normandy; the abortive 1957 Daily strike after the student
government made the mistake of trying to meddle in our editor
elections; the special JFK assassination issue; and one of the
most violent days of the 1970 strike.
