# How Golden Bears and Cards match up
## 
### 
Offenses: Stanford's Jack
Christiansen ran the Cardinal of
fense under John Ralston in
1970. California's Mike White
ran it in 1971 before defecting to
Berkeley. So while the 1975
Cards and Bears don't have
exactly the same plays and for
mations, they're awfully similar.
Cal's has cranked out a nation
leading 455 yards per game, but
the Cards have scored a few more
points (30 per game).
Running Game: The Bears'
Chuck Muncie, a definite Heis
man Trophy candidate, is the
School's all-time leading rusher
and ttie key to the Cal offense. To
go with his impressive statistics
(1294 yards this season) Muncie
now has a lavish 10-page booklet
put out by the Cal athletic de
partment to lure Heisman votes.
Last year the Cards held the
6 J. 220 pound Bear back to 43
yards. This year his lowest total
is 89, and he's caught 35 passes
and thrown for almost 100 yards
on two option passes. But one of
his best blockers, fullback Tom
Newton, is injured and may not
start. Newton has run for over
500 yards.
For the first time in recent
memory. Stanford is not the
worst rushing team in the Pac-8.
Fullbacks Don Stevenson and
John Finley have combined for
959 yards. Halfback Ron Inge has
been troubled by a thigh bruise,
but is scheduled to start. His
little-used backups are Sig Os

trom and Gary Lynn.
Passing Game: Cal master
minds have been trying to pin
the nickname "Telegraph Joe"
on their junior quarterback Joe
Roth, the league's leading pas
ser. Broadway Joe — or even Bart
— he probably ain't, but Roth
passed for 380 yards against a
Washington pass defense that is
statistically better than
Stanford's.
Much of Roth's success is due
to what is probably the best set of
receivers in the country.
Troublesome Steve Rivera, the
split end who made Stanford de
fenders cardinal-faced last year,
has caught an astounding 38
passes in his last fourgames.The
other Bear wide receiver,
sprinter Wesley Walker, likes to
run bomb patterns — and his
hands are almost as good as his
legs.
By popular acclaim, Guy Ben
jamin is Stanford's starter this
week. It's the first time Benjamin
has ever started back-to-back
games at Stanford. Probably his
most impressive statistic (aside
from his 59 percent completion
average) is his eight touchdown
throws in only 105 attempts. The
Cards lead the league in TD pas
ses, including 11 by Mike Cor
dova, now Benjamin's backup.
USC Coach John McKay
thinks the Cards' Tony Hill is
better than Rivera or Walker.
He'll see lots of double coverage,
with Benjamin looking for split

end Bill Singler (23 catches) or
sure-handed tight end Ted Pap
pas (25), as well as Inge (27) and
Hill (48).
Trick plays: The Cards held
closed practices twice this week.
Defenses: Everyone expects
both to be in a lot of trouble, even
if it's pouring rain. Both Stan
ford and Cal managed to crunch
USC, but neither could stop
UCLA. And neither has faced an
offense as good as its Big Game

opponent's.
Cal's three-man line features
nose guard Paul von der
Mehden, who gets more public
ity than the others, although
probably only because he's a
senior. The Bears' best defender,
according to Mike White, is
linebacker Phil Heck. He has two
interceptions and leads the team
in tackles. But the rest of the Cal
defense hasn't proved itself.
Stanford's Duncan McColl,

who seems to come up with his
best performances against good'
teams, leads a Card line that will
have its most difficult chore of
the year. Last year McColl and
now-departed teammate Pat
Donovan keyed a Stanford de
fense that kept Steve Bartkowski
at bay.
Bands: Here's one contest that
doesn't figure to be close. Gal's
band leads the league only in
conductors, with four.
