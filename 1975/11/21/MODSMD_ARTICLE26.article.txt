## Oski bites dust

Our prognosticator is trying to save his job
after the last few miserable weeks. In fact, if he
bombs out this weekend, the Great Cardinal
probably won't ever let him make another pre
diction.
Here goes nothing. That's right, Oregon
over Oregon State and Washington over
Washington State in the battles of the "North
west Nothings."
But you didn't really care about those any
way. Here's the one that counts.
Cal's Golden Bears enter Stanford Stadium
tomorrow as two-point favorites. And they
should be. They've got one of the most
talented and varied offenses in the league,
and, frankly, they're a better all-around team
than the Cards.
But it's rare that the best team carries any
sort of advantage into the Big Game. Anything
can happen, and to appease everyone who's

been going bananas recently, it's going to be
Stanford 27, Cat 24. Start the fireworks. Throw
down the Roses.
But don't spend too much money celebrat
ing, because next week UCLA will stomp USC
and claim the Rose Bowl bid for itself. Oh well.
One more thing. You've heard that, if some
things work out right and some don't, the
Cards could be headed for the Fiesta Bowl.
Well, forget it. Nebraska would have to lose
to Oklahoma for that to happen, and unless
Vince Ferragamo decides to transfer again,
there's no way.
You didn't want to go to Tempe, Ariz., any
way.
