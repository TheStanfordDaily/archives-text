# Chris contemplates Big one
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The sun had just faded, as the
red-jacketed man approached
the Stanford training quarters
yesterday. The reporter almost
didn't recognize him, but it was
Cardinal Coach Jack Christian
sen.
He seemed to be absorbed in
thought as he walked — as if he
were contemplating which trick
play to use in the 78th Big Game,
tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. in Stan
ford Stadium.
Stopping, he started to talk to
the reporter. There weren t any
revelations. After all, this is it —
the BIG GAME.
"Everything's been said. Cal
has great personnel, a lot of their
team is the same they had last
year. About the only difference
isthe quarterback,"said Chris. He
seemed subdued, almost as if he
had fust finished watching film
studies of Cal's top rated offense.
Closed session
Earlier in the week, he had
closed practice, saying he was
putting in a few trick plays that
the Alumni send in during the
season. Stanford has always
gone to its bag of tricks in the
important games — like the fake

punts in the 1971 Rose Bowl and
in last year's Big Game. "This is
the type of game where you don't
hold anything back, so you've
got to have everything available,
from the fake punt to the fake
field goal."
Cal is statistically ahead of
Stanford in almost every categ
ory. Its offense,which is leading
the NCAA in total offense (4556
yards) statistics, can only be de
scribed as awesome. The Bears
are the best balanced team Stan
ford has or will face this year.
Everyone has heard of super
back Chuck Muncie (1294 yds.
on 198 carries) and"Telegraph"
Joe Roth (112 completions in
203 attempts for 1717 yds.), but
Stanford fans still haven't forgot
ten unheralded Oregon quarter
back Jack Henderson, who tore
the Cards apart last week.
Holy Ducks!
"God, if Oregon can do that to
us, just think what Cal will do,"
said one fan after last week. And
Oregon didn't have two of the
best receivers in the country.
Chubby-faced Steve Rivera,
whose acrobatic catches amazed
Card rooters last year, is leading
the conference with 53 recep

tions for 737 yards and tour
touchdowns. And at flanker is
Wesley Walker, who's only
caught 31 passes, but has turned
eight of them into touchdowns
and gained 714 yards.
Cal is almost too good. But the
Golden Bears use the same of
fense that Stanford runs, so the
Card defense should be familiar
with it. "In order to win the ball
game we'll have to perform up to
our capabilities in some areas
and over our capabilities in
othes," said (Jiris. A big task in
the Big Game. But last year
seemed impossible, too. and the
Cards pulled off a 22-20 last sec
ond heist.
If it comes down to a last
second field goal this year it
might be Cal kicker Jim Breech
instead of the familiar right foot
of Mike Langford. A tie would
not help Stanford at all in the
race for the Roses, because Cal
has a better overall record than
the Cards.
Go for it
"If there are four to five mi
nutes let we'll kick a field goal,
but at some point in time later in
the gamewe'llgo for it."
But Chris hopes it won't come
down to that. And his offense
may prevent that. Stanford's god

— Guy Benjamin — is starting at
quarterback. "I probably
couldn't have gotten
into or out of the stadium, if I
hadn't started Benjamin,"
laughed Chris on Wednesday.
Benjamin is the quarterback
this week, unlike last week
when Christiansen said Benja
min would share playing tim
with Mike Cordova. But Cordov
will still come in if Guy can
move the team.
Benjamin may not have tl
services of running back Rc
Inge, who has been hamper*
with a pulled thigh. "He sa
he's ready and we're hopef
he'll be able to play."
Everything has been said.
