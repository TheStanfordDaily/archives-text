# Biggest match
## Poloists play Cal 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
The curtain rises: Stanford's
varsity waterpolo team is pres
ently in first place in the Pac-8
standings with a 4-1 record fol
lowing California's 8-7 win the
previous week over UCLA. Cal
and UCLA are tied for second
place with a 3-2 record. Stanford
meets California tomorrow at 11
a.m. at the deGuerre pool com
plex in their league match-up.
This is not the beginning of
some fictitious play concocted
by Stanford's drama depart
ment. For the first time in eleven
years, the Cards actually find
themselves capable of winning
the Pac-8 conference.
If the Cards win, they take the
league crown and will go to the
NCAA tournament along with a
second Pac-8 selection. If they
lose, and taking into account
that UCLA beats hapless USC
there will be a three-team tie for
first place between Stanford,
California, and UCLA with two
teams arbitrarily getting the nod
to the NCAA.
"At first 1 heard that there
might be a playoff between the
three teams since if we lose to

Cal, the three squads would have
identical 2-2 records against
each other. But now I hear that
they might select two out of the
three and I'm not sure whether
we'll be one of them or not.
They're going to see what hap
pens in this game first," said
coach Art Lambert.
The Cards have run up a 2-0
record against the Golden Bears
(his season, with one win com
ing in pre-season and one in
Pac-8 play.
These wins are very mislead
ing by themselves, however.
Even with these two losses Cal
appears to be the favorite in
tomorrow's matchup.
But regardless of who's picked
over whom the final score
should be very close as Stanford
and Cal are similar in many
ways. On Saturday fans will see
two very disciplined teams.
Both will try to work fromthe
hole — passing the ball to the
man in the whole and then
breaking toward the net expect
ing the pass for the shot on goal.
Both will also probably use a
full-court pressing defense to try
to force the other into turnovers.

AND HE CAN BLOCK, TOO—Don Stevenson started the year as a n
unproven second-string fullback — and now he's the Cards' lead
ing rusher, averaging a solid 4.8 yards per carry Stevenson had
100-yard games against Army and Washington, but he says he
liked beating USC best.
