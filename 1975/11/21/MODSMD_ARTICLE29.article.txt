# Bart, Roth â€” Cal quarterback dynasty
## 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Cal has done it
again . . . pulled a star quarter
back out of its hat.
First it was Steve Bartkowski.
Before last year, Bart was known
only by his immediate family, if
to them. One All-American sea
son later, he became the first
draft choice of the National
Football League.
Now it's Joe Roth. Known only
as a "JC transfer" at the begin
ning of the season, Roth, a
junior, has shown himself to be
possibly the most outstanding
quarterback prospect in the
country.
In many respects, Roth's de
velopment has been more im
pressive than Bartkowski's was.
Operation
For beginners, Roth is lucky to
be playing at all. He was oper
ated on for cancer two years ago

after a malignant cyst was disco
vered behind his left ear.
Unlike Bartkowski, Roth
didn't open the season as the
Bears' number one quarterback.
Fred Besana did, partly because
he was more familiar with Cal's
offense than the newcomer Roth.
Since taking over as Cal's star
ter in the third game of the year,
Roth has led the Bears to seven
wins in their last eight games,
become the ninth leading passer
in the country and the Pacific
Eight leader in total offense,
thrown for an average of 277
yards in his last four games and
thrown 13 touchdown passes.
I le needs just one more in the Big
(lame to tie Cal's single season
record of 14, set by Craig Morton
in 1963.
AP player
Roth was named the As
sociated Press Offensive Player
of the Week after completing 24
of 36 passes for a school-record
380 yards two weeks ago against
a Washington defense which
ranked fourth nationally.
"It ranks as good as any single
game performance by either Jim
Plunkett or Steve Bartkowski,"

said Cal coach Mike White, who
has coached them both. "He hit
24 of 36 passes, and seven were
dropped. He threw every type of
pass imaginable."
Cal All-American candidate
Chuck Muncie places Roth
above Bartkowski in ability.
The best
"Roth's the best," Muncie
said. "Bartkowski had some
great days, but Joe has surpassed
him. He should be All-American
right now and the Heisman win
ner next season."
Roth assesses his play very
cautiously. "I think I can say I'm
definitely improving over the
past several games. I understand
the offense a lot better now and
I'm throwing theball crisperand
sharper.
"We have a beautifully en
gineered offense. There's always
a play to go to. depending on
what the defense is doing."
Paul Hackett, Cal's quarter
back coach and one of those re
sponsible for developing the
Bear offense, said Roth's success
has had residual effects.
"The real contribution Joe has
made in helping turn things

around (from two early season
losses) is that he has taken some
of the i re.ssure off of Muncie.
Chui.k is a great player, but he
can't do it alone. Now a team
preparing for us just can't key on
Muncie; they have to watch out
for out Roth-Rivera combina
tion."
And Stanford thought it was
lucky when Bartkowski
graduated . . .
