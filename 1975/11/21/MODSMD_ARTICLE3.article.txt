# Senate committee implicates U.S. in foreign assassination attempts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Senate intelligence commit
tee yesterday implicated U.S. officials in at least eight
schemes to kill Cuba Premier Fidel Castro and one to
murder former Congo leader Patrice Lumumba.
The committee said devices used ranged from poison to
explosives to high-powered rifles.
The U.S. government was also implicated in the 1961
assassination of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo and
was aware of plots against South Vit'liumfcv* President
Ngo Dinh Diem and Chilean army chief Rene Schneider in
which "the risk of death" existed, the committee said.
The 11-member panel headed by Sen. Frank Church
(D-Idaho) also said it came across "evidence of CIA in
volvement in plans to assassinate President Sukarno of
Indonesiaand 'Papa Doc' Duvalier of Haiti." Assassina
tion plots against Castro "sometimes contemplated action
against Raul Castro and Che Gueverra" as well, the com
mittee found.
Only the Castro brothers are still alive. However, the
committee concluded that "no foreign leaders were killed
as a result of assassination plots initiated by officials of the
United States."
'American principles'
The committee sharply condemned the use of assassi na
tion, except in wartime, as "incompatible with American
principles, international order and morality." It called on
Congress to pass a law banning its use as an instrument of
national policy.
The report stated that there was enough evidence "to
permit a reasonable inference that the 1960 plot to assas
sinate Lumumba was authorized by President
Eisenhower" but it stopped short of a final conclusion.
The committee also said that "there was insufficient

evidence" that PresidentsEisenhower, Kennedy or John
son orany of their closeadvisers authorized theassassina
tion of Castro.
The committee said it could find no other evidence that
a president had authorized U.S. participation in an assas
sination. However, the committee held out the possibility
that various presidents may have purposely obscured
their involvement in assassinations.
'Ultimate responsibility'
Regardless of whether or not presidents knew of the
plots, "as chief executive officer of the United States, each
must bear the ultimate responsibility for the activities of
his subordinates," the committee added.
The 346-page report, fruit of a still-incomplete, six
month investigation, was released by the committee after
the Senate refused to accede to a vigorous campaign by the
Ford administration to have it kept secret. President Ford
wrote Senate leaders yesterday that publication would not
be in the national interest.
Hut after discussing the question for nearly four hours in
a closed session, the Senate refused to vote either to block
or endorse the report.
A spokesman for the CIA said he did not anticipate any
early response to the publication or contents of the Senate
committee's report because "not a soul out here except
one officer has read the thing. We don't even have a copy."
The committee "found concrete evidence of at least
eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro
from 1960 to 1965" using a variety of devices which "ran
the gamut from high-powered rifles to poison pills, poison
pens, deadly bacterial powders and other devices which
strain the imagination."

The report stated that there was enough evidence "to
permit a reasonable inference that the 1960 plot to assas
sinate Lumumba was authorized by President
Eisenhower" but it stopped short of a final conclusion.
The committee also said that "there was insufficient

evidence" that PresidentsEisenhower, Kennedy or John
son orany of their closeadvisers authorized theassassina
tion of Castro.
The committee said it could find no other evidence that
a president had authorized U.S. participation in an assas
sination. However, the committee held out the possibility
that various presidents may have purposely obscured
their involvement in assassinations.
'Ultimate responsibility'
Regardless of whether or not presidents knew of the
plots, "as chief executive officer of the United States, each
must bear the ultimate responsibility for the activities of
his subordinates," the committee added.
The 346-page report, fruit of a still-incomplete, six
month investigation, was released by the committee after
the Senate refused to accede to a vigorous campaign by the
Ford administration to have it kept secret. President Ford
wrote Senate leaders yesterday that publication would not
be in the national interest.
Hut after discussing the question for nearly four hours in
a closed session, the Senate refused to vote either to block
or endorse the report.
A spokesman for the CIA said he did not anticipate any
early response to the publication or contents of the Senate
committee's report because "not a soul out here except
one officer has read the thing. We don't even have a copy."
The committee "found concrete evidence of at least
eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro
from 1960 to 1965" using a variety of devices which "ran
the gamut from high-powered rifles to poison pills, poison
pens, deadly bacterial powders and other devices which
strain the imagination."
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Senate intelligence commit
tee yesterday implicated U.S. officials in at least eight
schemes to kill Cuba Premier Fidel Castro and one to
murder former Congo leader Patrice Lumumba.
The committee said devices used ranged from poison to
explosives to high-powered rifles.
The U.S. government was also implicated in the 1961
assassination of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo and
was aware of plots against South Vit'liumfcv* President
Ngo Dinh Diem and Chilean army chief Rene Schneider in
which "the risk of death" existed, the committee said.
The 11-member panel headed by Sen. Frank Church
(D-Idaho) also said it came across "evidence of CIA in
volvement in plans to assassinate President Sukarno of
Indonesiaand 'Papa Doc' Duvalier of Haiti." Assassina
tion plots against Castro "sometimes contemplated action
against Raul Castro and Che Gueverra" as well, the com
mittee found.
Only the Castro brothers are still alive. However, the
committee concluded that "no foreign leaders were killed
as a result of assassination plots initiated by officials of the
United States."
'American principles'
The committee sharply condemned the use of assassi na
tion, except in wartime, as "incompatible with American
principles, international order and morality." It called on
Congress to pass a law banning its use as an instrument of
national policy.
