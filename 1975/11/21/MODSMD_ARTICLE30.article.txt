The women's swim team
splashed to an easy victory in a
dual meet at deCuerre pool on
Wednesday, gliding past F>esno
(107-29) and Chico State
(124-13) in an impressive dis
play of depth and versatility.
The Cards amply fulfilled the
primary objective of the meet,
according to coach Jim Gaug
hran, as "at least 20" swimmers
qualified for the upcoming
Northern California Champion
ship Conference.
It was an especially gratifying
afternoon for Rose Storm, who
confirmed predictions by qual
ifying for the Nationals in three
events. She bettered the National
qualifying times in both the 50
and the 100 meter breast stroke
with times of 32.6 and 1:11.4 re
spectively. and went on to clock
a 25.5 to secure a Nationalsberth
in the 50 free as well.
The youthful team, described
by Gaughran as having "an
overbalance of freshmen" with
"ten out of the 20 girls possibly
going to the conference champ
ionships" being team new
comers, is also characterized by
its outstanding depth and great
potential for point accumula
tion. â€”Ellen Sofio
