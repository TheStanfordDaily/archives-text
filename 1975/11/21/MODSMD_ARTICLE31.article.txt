# Card back Stevenson aims to run by Bears
## 
### GARY SPRAGUE 
It's axiomatic that Stanford
can throw the football. Corner
barkc. frnm Los Angeles to State
College, Pa., will tell you that.
But who ever heard of a running
game doun on the Farm?
This year, however, the flock
of Cardinal running backs are
kicking up a little dust of their
own While the ground game
still does not rival the aerial at
tack, Stanford's 171 yard-per
game rushing average is a lethal
weapon in Stanford's offensive
arsenal.
The largest contributor to the
revitalized rushing game is full
back Don Stevenson. Running
inside to complement Ron Inge's
outside attack. Stevenson has
amassed a team-leading 614
yards so far this season. It is no
coincidence that the renaissance
of rushing at Stanford closely
parallels the development of
Stevenson as a running back.
Split duties
A 6-foot-l 210 pound junior
pre-med from Mt. Carmel High
in Los Angeles, Stevenson
shares fullback duties with
sophomore John Finley. He de
nies that he has nailed down the
starting slot, and sees the com
petition at the position as bene
ficial. "Both can contribute a lot
to the team," says Stevenson. "If
either slacks off, the other will
come up to do the job. He's push
ing me, and I guess I'm pushing
him. I'm looking forward to hav
ing the same situation next
year."
Stevenson's reasons for choos
ing Stanford echo a familiar
theme among Cardinal athletes:
the chance to play major college
football at a superior academic

institution. Although he was re
cruited as a defensive back,
Stevenson was given the oppor
tunity to try fullback on the
freshman team. He's been at that
position ever since.
After spending last year as a
third-string player, Stevenson is
determined to make the most of
his present opportunities. He
states frankly, "I'm succeeding
beyond my wildest dreams.
Good player
"I have always felt that I was a
good player," says Stevenson,
"and 1 wanted everyone else to
realize it. I felt the coaches
would realize it, then the
players. I like the fans to ap
preciate what I'm doing too."
Stevenson also addressed the
complicated question ol why he
plays football. The reasons are
many and have changed over
time. "It used to be fun," says
Stevenson. "That's why I started
playing. Pure fun. As I get older,
there are a lot of things in it be
sides pure fun.
"There's a feeling of control;
the harder I work at it the better I
become. I like to know that hard
work will pay off; I like being in
control.
Ego
"And there's an ego factor too.
I like to get out there and hear

people cheering for you. You
hear people cheering against
you too, but you know that's he
cause you are good."
Despite the personal reasons
for playing football, Stevenson
places team achievements over
personal ones. "The victories 1
enjoyed most," he says, "were
against USC and the tie with
Michigan 1 didn't feel that my
performance was that excep
tional, but 1 enjoyed the total vic
tory more than anything 1 did."
Every game holds some spe
cial significance for Stevenson.
"There hasn't been a game
where 1 haven't been psyched
up," he says. "For example, if
tbe game's in Los Angeles, it's
home, so I'll know guvs on the
other team. Or I'll think of re
cruiting and what the schools
did or didn't do. Or I'll set per
sonal goals. Sometimes I feel like
I can run, run, run and no one
can tackle me."
Stevenson is looking for Stan
ford to run, run, run this
weekend. The running game
will be important in opening up
Stanford's offense. While the
Cards must still throw to win, an
established ground attack will
do much to open up the airways.
And for the first time in several
years, the Cards have the runners
to do the trick.

would realize it, then the
players. I like the fans to ap
preciate what I'm doing too."
Stevenson also addressed the
complicated question ol why he
plays football. The reasons are
many and have changed over
time. "It used to be fun," says
Stevenson. "That's why I started
playing. Pure fun. As I get older,
there are a lot of things in it be
sides pure fun.
"There's a feeling of control;
the harder I work at it the better I
become. I like to know that hard
work will pay off; I like being in
control.
Ego
"And there's an ego factor too.
I like to get out there and hear

people cheering for you. You
hear people cheering against
you too, but you know that's he
cause you are good."
Despite the personal reasons
for playing football, Stevenson
places team achievements over
personal ones. "The victories 1
enjoyed most," he says, "were
against USC and the tie with
Michigan 1 didn't feel that my
performance was that excep
tional, but 1 enjoyed the total vic
tory more than anything 1 did."
Every game holds some spe
cial significance for Stevenson.
"There hasn't been a game
where 1 haven't been psyched
up," he says. "For example, if
tbe game's in Los Angeles, it's
home, so I'll know guvs on the
other team. Or I'll think of re
cruiting and what the schools
did or didn't do. Or I'll set per
sonal goals. Sometimes I feel like
I can run, run, run and no one
can tackle me."
Stevenson is looking for Stan
ford to run, run, run this
weekend. The running game
will be important in opening up
Stanford's offense. While the
Cards must still throw to win, an
established ground attack will
do much to open up the airways.
And for the first time in several
years, the Cards have the runners
to do the trick.
It's axiomatic that Stanford
can throw the football. Corner
barkc. frnm Los Angeles to State
College, Pa., will tell you that.
But who ever heard of a running
game doun on the Farm?
This year, however, the flock
of Cardinal running backs are
kicking up a little dust of their
own While the ground game
still does not rival the aerial at
tack, Stanford's 171 yard-per
game rushing average is a lethal
weapon in Stanford's offensive
arsenal.
The largest contributor to the
revitalized rushing game is full
back Don Stevenson. Running
inside to complement Ron Inge's
outside attack. Stevenson has
amassed a team-leading 614
yards so far this season. It is no
coincidence that the renaissance
of rushing at Stanford closely
parallels the development of
Stevenson as a running back.
Split duties
A 6-foot-l 210 pound junior
pre-med from Mt. Carmel High
in Los Angeles, Stevenson
shares fullback duties with
sophomore John Finley. He de
nies that he has nailed down the
starting slot, and sees the com
petition at the position as bene
ficial. "Both can contribute a lot
to the team," says Stevenson. "If
either slacks off, the other will
come up to do the job. He's push
ing me, and I guess I'm pushing
him. I'm looking forward to hav
ing the same situation next
year."
Stevenson's reasons for choos
ing Stanford echo a familiar
theme among Cardinal athletes:
the chance to play major college
football at a superior academic

institution. Although he was re
cruited as a defensive back,
Stevenson was given the oppor
tunity to try fullback on the
freshman team. He's been at that
position ever since.
After spending last year as a
third-string player, Stevenson is
determined to make the most of
his present opportunities. He
states frankly, "I'm succeeding
beyond my wildest dreams.

"I have always felt that I was a
