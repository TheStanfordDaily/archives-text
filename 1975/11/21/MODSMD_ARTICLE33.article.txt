Reagan announces candidacy
MIAMI — Ronald Reagan announced his candidacy
yesterday for the Republican presidential nomination and
then encountered a man wielding a toy pistol as he shook
hands after the first rally of his campaign.
Secret Service agents grabbed the man and hustled
Reagan away. The former California governor appeared
unshaken.
The Secret Service identified the man as Michael Lance
Carvin, 20, of Pompano, Fla.
Agents had been guarding Reagan for only half a day
when the incident occurred at a hotel near the Miami
Airport.
Carvin was questioned by agents at the hotel, then taken
to Secret Service headquarters in downtown Miami, a
Reagan spokesman said.
Bob Newbrand, special agent in charge of the local
Secret Service office, said Carvin was charged with in
timidating a presidential candidate and with assaulting a
federal officer.
Cost of living increases again
WASHINGTON — Inflation accelerated in October as
sharply higher grocery prices pushed the cost of living up
seven-tenths of one percent, the government said yester
day.
Last month's price increase was the third highest this
year and followed increases of only two-tenths of a per
cent in August and five-tenths of a percent in September,
the Labor Department said.
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said that the
profitability of American corporations after paying taxes
showed the biggest increase in 25 years for the three
months ended in September.
The profits increase, which many economists consider
essential if corporate spending is to join consumer spend
ing in lifting the economy out ot the recession, amounted
to $11.9 billion, or i6.9 percent.
U.S. proposes Mideast talks
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said yesterday that Malcolm Toon, the U.S. Ambassadorto
Israel, was being recalled to discuss prospects for new
negotiations in the Middle East.
Kissinger also said during foreign aid testimony before
a Senate appropriations subcommittee that the United
States is proposing to the Soviet Union the convening of
"multilateral" talks on peace in the troubled region.
The U.S. position is in response to a Soviet note calling

for the reopening of the Geneva peace conference with
participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Kissinger confirmed also that Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin is expected to visit Washington in January.
Egyptian President Anv\ar Sadat completed a state visit
recently.
State moves toward NYC aid
ALBANY, N.Y. — New York Gov. Hugh Carey said
yesterday that state officials were "very close" to arrang
ing $150 million in financing to stave off a New York City
default next week.
Meanwhile, the state legislature put off action for at
least a day on tax increases considered essential to gain
President Ford's support for federal aid to avert default.
Carey had sought quick action on city tax increases to
secure federal aid to help the city avert default in the
December. But Democratic legislative leaders told him
yesterday that a sales tax was adamantly opposed by their
rank and fild legislators.
Aides to legislative leaders were studying various
"nuisance" ♦ax proposals on automobiles, beauty parlors,
liquor and other items in an effort to avoid an unpopular
one-cent increase in the city sales tax, currently eight
cents on the dollar.
Kissinger in contempt?
WASHINGTON — The House intelligence committee
voted yesterday to move ahead with at least one contempt
citation against Secretary of State Henry Kissinger despite
President Ford's protest that the action "involves grave
matters affecting our conduct of foreign policy."
However, Chairman Otis Pike (D-N.Y.) said the commit
tee would not press two other contempt citations against
Kissinger if Ford's advisors delivered promised docu
ments.
The three contempt citations approved by the commit
tee last week must be approved by the full House before
they could be turned over to a U.S. attorney for prosecu
tion.

year and followed increases of only two-tenths of a per
cent in August and five-tenths of a percent in September,

ing in lifting the economy out ot the recession, amounted

U.S. proposes Mideast talks

said yesterday that Malcolm Toon, the U.S. Ambassadorto

negotiations in the Middle East.

a Senate appropriations subcommittee that the United
States is proposing to the Soviet Union the convening of
"multilateral" talks on peace in the troubled region.
The U.S. position is in response to a Soviet note calling

for the reopening of the Geneva peace conference with
participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Kissinger confirmed also that Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin is expected to visit Washington in January.
Egyptian President Anv\ar Sadat completed a state visit

State moves toward NYC aid
ALBANY, N.Y. — New York Gov. Hugh Carey said
yesterday that state officials were "very close" to arrang
ing $150 million in financing to stave off a New York City
default next week.
Meanwhile, the state legislature put off action for at
least a day on tax increases considered essential to gain
President Ford's support for federal aid to avert default.
Carey had sought quick action on city tax increases to
secure federal aid to help the city avert default in the
December. But Democratic legislative leaders told him
yesterday that a sales tax was adamantly opposed by their
rank and fild legislators.
Aides to legislative leaders were studying various
"nuisance" ♦ax proposals on automobiles, beauty parlors,
liquor and other items in an effort to avoid an unpopular
one-cent increase in the city sales tax, currently eight
cents on the dollar.
Kissinger in contempt?
WASHINGTON — The House intelligence committee
voted yesterday to move ahead with at least one contempt
citation against Secretary of State Henry Kissinger despite

tee would not press two other contempt citations against
Kissinger if Ford's advisors delivered promised docu
ments.
The three contempt citations approved by the commit
tee last week must be approved by the full House before
they could be turned over to a U.S. attorney for prosecu
tion.
