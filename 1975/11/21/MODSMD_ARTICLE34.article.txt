# Indian mascot banner waves over Cal
## Zetes pull pranks on Bears 
### 
Big Came fever reached new heights
ol prankishness yesterday as 25 mem
bers of Stanford's Zeta Psi fraternity
combined to unravel a 65-foot-long
banner from the top of UC-Berkeley's
Campanile tower.
Comprised of bed sheets sewn to
gether, the verticle sign read "Indians"
and contained a sketch of the former
Stanford mascot.
While his brothers unveiled the
sign, legendary Zete hero Ed Snate
stole his way into the carillon room,
chiming out the Mickey Mouse Club

theme song for 20 minutes as a large
crowd gathered beneath. One profes
sor, attempting to administer a mid
term to her students, shouted at Snate
to abate the nuisance.
The plan unfolded in early after
noon as 15 Zetes paid a dime each to
ride an elevator to the top ot the
307-foot bell tower, while 10 remained
below to guard against reprisals.
Malicious mischief charges
A swarm of police arrived on the
scene, however, as soon as the unusu
ally loud music began. But none of the

intruders was arrested, although a
warrant was issued for Snate's arrest
on malicious mischief charges, result
ing from his alleged snipping of the
Campanile switchboard telephone
lines.
Two unsuspecting women students
at Cal were trapped at the ton of the
tower with the Zete contingent when
police first cordoned off the building.
According to one Zete, one of them
was overheard saying, "You know,
you can tell they're Stanford guys.
They look more intelligent than our
guys."
Police escorted the Zetes out of the
tower's front door, through a crowd of
some 200 enraged Berkeleyites. The
culprits' names were recorded, and
warnings issued that any return to
Berkeley within 72 hours would con
stitute their automatic arrest.
A fraternity spokesman said the
group "didn't want to offend Native
Americans" with the content of its
display. "We were just showing an in
terest in returning a symbol of pride to
Stanford."
