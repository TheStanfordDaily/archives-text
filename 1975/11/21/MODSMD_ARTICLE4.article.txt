# Different views on Indian mascot
## Native Americans join debate 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Native Americans have entered the
dispute over whether an Indian mascot
should be reinstated here.
Members of the Stanford
American Indian Organization(SAlO)
have been staging teach-ins at dorms
across the campus explaining the op
position to an Indian mascot, and are
planning an additional one day, ac
cordind to SAIO member Benjamin
Atencio.
Native Americans Timm Williams
and Princess Pale Moon (Rita Thiel
man) are scheduled to make appear
ances tonight at the Bonfire "urging
students to support a dignified Indian
mascot," according to Pale Moon.
Williams performed as "Prince
Lightfoot" at football games prior to
1972. Pale Moon is a member of the

American Tribal Council of Santa
Clara County.
'Informing students'
Atencio said SAIO "has been in
forming students why we stand
against the mascot. We're trying to get
better communication. So far we've
gotten a pretty good response. We've
covered Gavilan, Madera and Roble,
and are trying to plan another teach-in
Friday (today)."
Pale Moon said earlier plans to
march in front of President Richard
Lyman's house were called off. "We
don't want to appear militant by mak
ing a big scene in front of his house,"
she explained.
Some 13 Native American organiza
tions in the Hay Area have come out
against restoration of an Indian mas
cot. "We knew we had this support,"

Atencio noted, "but it's nice to get it
written down, especially since there
have been attempts to split the Indian
people."
Pale Moon said she is seeking "to
give the student body another chance
to vote on whether they want an Indian
mascot or not." She added she was
considering a presentation along with
