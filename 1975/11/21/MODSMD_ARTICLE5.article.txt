# Senior seeks black frat here
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Teddy Harris, a senior majoring in
civ 1 engineering, is heading a move
ment to start a predominantly black
fraternity on campus.
Harris, a member of the black frater
nity Alpha Phi Alpha for a year and
now affiliated with its San Jose State
chapter, has been working since the
beginning of this quarter to organize a
chapter at Stanford.
Through Harris' efforts, there are
now three black undergraduate
pledges.
Harris said his immediate goal is to
gather enough members to become an
officially registered organization. The
ASSU requires that a minimum of five
individuals be members of a group in
order for it to quality as an official or
ganization, Harris said.
No discrimination
Discrimination on the basis of race
by any such group would not be al
lowed, administration officials say.
"The administration will not bend
with regards to this policy," said
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton.
According to its Stanford pledges,
however, Alpha Phi Alpha does main
tain some white members.
Harris said he believes there are
many potential pledges at Stanford,
but he said that the fraternity's lack of
exposure and rigorous pledge program
tend to slow the fraternity's expansion.

"We'd like to have a hundred mem
bers by next quarter, but that's nut pos
sible," he said. "We've got to keet the
quality (of new pledges) up and at the
same time keep people doing well in
school." He said some pledges find it
dittii:ult to do all their studying anil to
work towards acceptance into the
fraternity at the same time.
"It's also amazing and a shame that
very few people have heard of Alpha
Phi Alpha, even in the black commun
ity." Harris said.
'Bad reputation'
He also said that the general decline
of popularity of fraternities is a prob
lem with which Alpha Phi Alpha must
deal. "This is basically because of the
attitude in the West," he said. "Frater
nities right now have a bad reputation
based on past performances," he said
"People think they dwell on
trivialities and they have no purpose
except to drink and party and have a
good time.
"Alpha Phi Alpha doesn't fit that
mold. We are a service organization
designed to help others and help
others within the group," Harris
added.
"People might feel that fraternities
on campus tend to fragment the stu
dent body. This isn't the case. It (the
Alpha Phi Alpha experience) broadens
your horizons and you just feel like
you have much more to offer." he
noted.

tend to slow the fraternity's expansion.

"We'd like to have a hundred mem
bers by next quarter, but that's nut pos
sible," he said. "We've got to keet the
quality (of new pledges) up and at the
same time keep people doing well in
school." He said some pledges find it
dittii:ult to do all their studying anil to
work towards acceptance into the
fraternity at the same time.
"It's also amazing and a shame that
very few people have heard of Alpha
Phi Alpha, even in the black commun
ity." Harris said.
'Bad reputation'
He also said that the general decline
of popularity of fraternities is a prob
lem with which Alpha Phi Alpha must
deal. "This is basically because of the
attitude in the West," he said. "Frater
nities right now have a bad reputation
based on past performances," he said
"People think they dwell on
trivialities and they have no purpose
except to drink and party and have a
good time.
"Alpha Phi Alpha doesn't fit that
mold. We are a service organization
designed to help others and help
others within the group," Harris
added.
"People might feel that fraternities
on campus tend to fragment the stu
dent body. This isn't the case. It (the
Alpha Phi Alpha experience) broadens
your horizons and you just feel like
you have much more to offer." he
noted.
Teddy Harris, a senior majoring in
civ 1 engineering, is heading a move
ment to start a predominantly black
fraternity on campus.
Harris, a member of the black frater
nity Alpha Phi Alpha for a year and
now affiliated with its San Jose State
chapter, has been working since the
beginning of this quarter to organize a
chapter at Stanford.
Through Harris' efforts, there are
now three black undergraduate
pledges.
Harris said his immediate goal is to
gather enough members to become an
officially registered organization. The
ASSU requires that a minimum of five
individuals be members of a group in
order for it to quality as an official or
ganization, Harris said.
No discrimination
Discrimination on the basis of race
by any such group would not be al
lowed, administration officials say.
"The administration will not bend
with regards to this policy," said
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton.
According to its Stanford pledges,
however, Alpha Phi Alpha does main
tain some white members.
Harris said he believes there are
many potential pledges at Stanford,
but he said that the fraternity's lack of
exposure and rigorous pledge program
tend to slow the fraternity's expansion.
