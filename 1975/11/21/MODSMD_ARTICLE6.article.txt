# Ford campaign lacks funds, former aide Packard says
## 
### CHARLIE HALL 
President Ford is having difficulty
raising money and building a cam
paign organization, according to weal
thy alumnus and former trustee David
Packard, who stepped down earlier
this month as Ford's national finance
chairman.
Packard noted in a Daily interview
that there has been "a great deal of
apathy" towards Ford's election bid,
and that the fundraising job was
"much more difficult than I had an
ticipated when I took the job in July."
Packard held his position only three
months before quitting the campaign.
A part of Ford's problem, he argued,
is the 1974 campaign finance law,
which prohibits individual contribu
tions to political campaigns of more
than $1000.
"In 1972," he pointed out, "the Re
publican party was able to raise about
$30 million from 400 people." Under
the new law, he said, "the most you
can get from 400 people is $400,000."
Packard concedes however, that "all
sorts of factors" beyond the new fi

nance law have proved troublesome to
the President's election effort. One, he
said, is former Gov. Ronald Reagan's
candidacy, which has caused a split
among the OOP's conservative donors.
In addition, the widespread feeling
that Ford will not need much backing
to fend off his primary opponents has
contributed heavily to apathy, Packard
claimed. The President is hampered by
a feeling "that he's up there and has a
good deal of visibility and that he can
probably win the party nomination
without too much effort," he added.
Ford's personal weaknesses have
hurt the drive as well, Packard said.
"Ford has done very well in terms of
what he has accomplished, but at the
same time you would have to say he
hasn't caught fire so far. People like
him; they have confidence in him, but
they haven't been inspired by him."
Actions such as Ford's firing of both
former Defense Secretary James
Schlesinger and CIA Director William
Colby have also created an impression
that not all of the President's actions
are fully thought through, according to
Packard.
Poor timing
Criticizing the haste of Ford's move,
former Deputy Defense Secretary Pac
kard argued that "all those moves that
were made were moves that had a cer
tain logic behind them, but looking
back on it I think it would have been
better if they had been timed a little
more carefully.
"This is one example where a little
more careful consideration of the im
plications might have resulted in tim
ing that would have been indicative of
a better command of the situation."
Another major weakness hindering
the President, Packard said,is that "he

has riot brought together as strong <i
group of advisers as 1 would like him
to." Packard said he sympathizes with
Ford's desire to surround himself with
people he trusts personally but warns
that "sometimes those people are not
the most knowledgeable."
If Ford cannot generate more en
thusiasm in the coming months, there
could be severe problems ahead, Pack
ard said. Although he said he thinks
the President will gain the Republican
nomination, Packard expressed fears
that a Reagan victory either in New
Hampshire or Florida "would make
the whole primary campaign much
more difficult."
Polls show problems
Recent polls in Florida havoshown a
close struggle between Ford and
Reagan, and Packard said Ford's sup
porters "have had difficulty in putting

an organization together in New
Hampshire and Florida, which is an
indication that there are some prob
lems there."
Despite Ford's present difficulties,
Packard warmly praised Ford's per
formance in office thus far. "If you
consider that he has had a hostile Con
gress and that he has been nhle to deal
with that Congress effectively, he has
accomplished a great deal more than
many thought he would."
