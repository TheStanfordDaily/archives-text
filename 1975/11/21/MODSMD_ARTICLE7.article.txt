Deputy Administrator Robert Fri of the federal
Energy Research and Development Administration
(ERDA) yesterday called the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) "precious to national re
search" while dedicating SLAC's new computation
center.
Ceremonies were held in the lobby of the $2.9 mill
ion building.
A replacement for the now-defunct Atomic Energy
Commission, ERDA is engaged in basic research, Fri
said.
"Basic research is always the forerunner of practi
cal knowledge." Fri said. He stressed the importance
of pure scientific research by adding, "Our purpose is
to pursue knowledge on the nature of the universe."
Characters of change
Provost William Miller introduced Fri and em
phasized the importance of SLAC personnel. He cited

ments as an example of people acting as "characters
of change."
The federally-financed computation center was
completed on time and under budget. according to
officials. Construction of the 50,000 stjuaie-foot,
three-story building began in the summer of 1974
when Miller was working at SLAC.
Albert Hoover and Associates of Palo Alto designed
the structure to accommodate its large computers.
$20 million
Stanford operates SLAC] and tin; linear accelerator
under contract with ERDA. The computation c enter is
equipped with over $20 million worth of computers,
used to analyze results of experiments in elementary
particle physics.
Some 90 scientists and technicians from SLAC's
Computational Research Group and the Center for
Information Processing operate the center.
This marks the first time SLAC computers and per
sonnel have been consolidated in one place. a< ford
