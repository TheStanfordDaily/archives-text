We have all heard the ghastly
stories of malnutrition and star
vation or seen the specter of
hunger displayed with disquiet
ing reality in our magazines and
newspapers as well as on our
television screens.
As the National Day of Fasting
approaches us on Nov. 24, we no
doubt cringe at the latest figures
concerning the plight of nearly
one-half of the world's entire
population.
There is no question that there
is a disturbingly large number of
people for whom mere subsis
tence is a harsh yoke. Today, in
Bengaladesh alone, 10,000 peo
ple will die.
Yet perhaps our initial con
cern should begin with our own
situation — as individuals and
as a nation. Perhaps the National
Day of Fasting can provide us
with a reflection of ourselves,
the reality of which we can no
longer afford to avoid.
IJiet foods
We live in a country which has
given the majority of its citizens
enough food and ease to make
diet foods and high cholesterol a
national obsession. Even those
among us with "normal" diets
typically consume more nut
rients and proteins —as well as
dyes and preservatives — than
our bodies can possibly utilize.
In contrast, there are people
who live here without enough
income to purchase sufficient
food for their families, let alone
candy during the holidays.
Acccording to the 1970 cen
sus, 7.4 million black Americans
were living in poverty, and
one-half of our couples over 65
must survive on less than $3000
per year. It is sad beyond telling
that these people must struggle
to maintain a trace of dignity.
Just how much tood and ease
is appropriate in a country with
Appalachia, for example; or in a
world, if you prefer, with Ben
galadesh and sub-Saharan Af
rica?
Wasted food
To move closer to this com
munity, the Food Service esti-

mates that approximately 10
percent of the food that is actu
ally dished out is never eaten.
Were we not even concerned
about out own waste in the midst
of immense suffering, should we
not be aware that such waste is
unnecessarily inflating our
board costs?
Without looking any farther
than our own wallets, it is no
exaggeration to suppose that our
board fees might be 10 percent
lower were we more conscienti
ous about our consumption
habits.
How much more unsettling is
it to find that the very food to
which we look for nourishment
is somehow related to the
hyperactivity of our children or
the heart conditions of our
middle-aged?
Imagine the results if we were
to regulate our consumption in
accordance with a realistic rela
tionship to the world's re
sources.
Some questions
Would our leaders then find it
acceptable to devise tentative
plans for seizing oil from the
Middle East? Would they find it
acceptable — in appealing to the
popular consumptive mentality
— to assure the future of our
"luxuries?"
Would not our food service be
able to offer us a sound diet at a
considerably reduced rate?
During the Food Day obser
vance last April, 1472 students,
one-half of the food service sub
scribers, fasted and many others
from private residences joined.
During the National Day of Fast
ing on Nov. 24 there will be
another fast, accompanied by
many activities including
speakers, discussion groups,
movies and slide shows.
Perhaps we can use these op
portunities to examine what our
own everyday lives and habits
mean — to us, if not to our hun
gry fellow men, women and
children.
