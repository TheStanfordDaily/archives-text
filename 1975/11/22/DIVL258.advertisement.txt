This is the big one—the Pulsar Big Time.
The bigger face with the bolder look gives you a fast grasp of
the time—and this new Pulsar gives it to you without lifting a fin
ger. Just a flick of your wrist flashes the time.
There's a button to push for the exact second, another for the
month and day.
In stainless steel—brawny new band and all— very modestly
| priced at $295. |
