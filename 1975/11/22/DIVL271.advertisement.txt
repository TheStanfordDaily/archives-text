For those of you vaguely interested in the more traditional
memories of the big game, following are the words to two
nostalgic songs of note:
'Come Join The Band'
Come join the band
And give a cheer for Stanford red.
Throughout the land,
Our banners waving overhead.
Stanford for you,
Our loyal comrades brave and true
With might and main, sing this refrain,
Forever and forever, Stanford red.
'The Dirty Golden Bear'
The dirty golden hear
Is losing all his hair
His teeth are out
He's got the gout
He don't know what it's all about
His eyes are made of glass
He's losing all his class
So take your dirty golden bear

For those of you vaguely interested in the more traditional
memories of the big game, following are the words to two
nostalgic songs of note:
'Come Join The Band'
Come join the band
And give a cheer for Stanford red.
Throughout the land,
Our banners waving overhead.
Stanford for you,
Our loyal comrades brave and true
With might and main, sing this refrain,
Forever and forever, Stanford red.
'The Dirty Golden Bear'
The dirty golden hear
Is losing all his hair
His teeth are out
He's got the gout
He don't know what it's all about
His eyes are made of glass
He's losing all his class
So take your dirty golden bear
POCOOOOOOCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCOOOOOOOOOOOOO^I
