# Card seniors eye pros
## Farm NFL prospects are valuable, but few 
### JIM MOLLER 
"Wait until next year" is normally a cry of an
guish reserved for losers. Yet this year one hears
these words uttered by Stanford fans, coaches and
players alike. This seems out of character for a
team which is going into the last game of their
season in the midst of a three-way dog fight for the
Pacific Eight conference championship and a
chance to go to the Rose Bowl.
"We're a young team," explains defensive coor
dinator Norb Hecker. "Most of our players are
sophomores and juniors. This team has a bright
future ahead of it." Which means that next year the
Cards may be even better.
But for a number of players on the team their last
year of intercollegiate football is quickly drawing
to a close. There are only a few graduating players
from this year's team who will be going on and
attempting to make the grade in professional foot
ball. The two most prominent of these players are
Mike Langford and Geb Church.
Langford is probably Stanford's number one pro
prospect this year. Few Stanford fans will forget
when Langford won the Big Game last year with a
50-yard field goal as time expired. Earlier this year
Mike kicked the winning field goal against USC
with only six seconds remaining on the clock. This
ability to come through in the clutch has not gone
unnoticed by the pro scouts.
"Langford is definitely a good pro prospect,"
said a San Francisco 49ers official, Jim Mulgoon.
"There are other players around with stronger legs
than Langford, but he has proven he can kick
under pressure." Hecker feels that Mike will be "a
very good choice by someone."
The other solid Stanford pro prospect is
linebacker Geb Church. At 6-foot-3 and 205
pounds, Geb is probably not big enough to play a
linebacker position in the pros. The pro teams that
have contacted Stanford about Geb have talked
about moving him to free safety. The 49ers feel that
Church is "fast enough and tough enough to cover

the big tight ends in the pros."
Church, a three-year starter for the Cards, runs a
4.8 forty and has excellent range. Hecker, who
intercepted 23 passes himself during six seasons
in the NFL before becoming head coach of the
Atlanta Falcons and finally defensive coordinator
at Stanford, feels that Church "would make an
outstanding free safety. Given a chance he is a very
good prospect."
Mulgoon felt that there were other Cardinal
players who would be drafted; center Todd Ander
son is one. This was Anderson's first full season at
center where "he played well all year long," Mul
goon said.
Two other pro prospects from the offensive line
are Tom Tipton, a 6-foot-3, 244 pound guard and
tight end Ted Pappas. Both players should get a
chance according to Mulgoon, although neither
may be drafted very high.
Initially surprising is Mulgoon's belief that third
string quarterback Jerry Wadvogel will probably
go sometime late in the draft. Mulgoon points out
however, that "although we (the 49ers) haven't
seen Wadvogel play since last year, he's got a
strong arm and it would be worthwhile for some
one to bring him to training camp." This statement
is even less surprising considering the fact that in
Wadvogel's only start of his career at Stanford he
completed 21 of 40 passes for 227 yards and a
touchdown in the Card's 21-16 loss to Michigan
last year. Not bad credentials for a "third string"
quarterback.
Mulgoon's basic opinion that Stanford has a
number of excellent college players, but no out
standing pro prospects. Cal, he countered, has
some outstanding prospects (such as Chuck Mun
cie and Steve Rivera) but not as many good college
players. When Mulgoon discusses excellent col
lege players he talks about players like Billy Sing
ler, Ray Anderson, A 1 Tenßruggencate, Sig Os
trom, Dan Francis and Gerald Wilson. These are
the players that have turned the team around from
a disappointing 1-3-1 start to a 6-3-1 record and a
share of the conference lead.

some outstanding prospects (such as Chuck Mun
cie and Steve Rivera) but not as many good college
players. When Mulgoon discusses excellent col
lege players he talks about players like Billy Sing
ler, Ray Anderson, A 1 Tenßruggencate, Sig Os
trom, Dan Francis and Gerald Wilson. These are
the players that have turned the team around from
a disappointing 1-3-1 start to a 6-3-1 record and a
share of the conference lead.
"Wait until next year" is normally a cry of an
guish reserved for losers. Yet this year one hears
these words uttered by Stanford fans, coaches and
players alike. This seems out of character for a
team which is going into the last game of their
season in the midst of a three-way dog fight for the
Pacific Eight conference championship and a
chance to go to the Rose Bowl.
"We're a young team," explains defensive coor
dinator Norb Hecker. "Most of our players are
sophomores and juniors. This team has a bright
future ahead of it." Which means that next year the
Cards may be even better.
But for a number of players on the team their last
year of intercollegiate football is quickly drawing
to a close. There are only a few graduating players
from this year's team who will be going on and
attempting to make the grade in professional foot
ball. The two most prominent of these players are
Mike Langford and Geb Church.
Langford is probably Stanford's number one pro
prospect this year. Few Stanford fans will forget
when Langford won the Big Game last year with a
50-yard field goal as time expired. Earlier this year
Mike kicked the winning field goal against USC
with only six seconds remaining on the clock. This
ability to come through in the clutch has not gone
unnoticed by the pro scouts.
"Langford is definitely a good pro prospect,"
said a San Francisco 49ers official, Jim Mulgoon.
"There are other players around with stronger legs
than Langford, but he has proven he can kick
under pressure." Hecker feels that Mike will be "a
very good choice by someone."
The other solid Stanford pro prospect is
linebacker Geb Church. At 6-foot-3 and 205
pounds, Geb is probably not big enough to play a
linebacker position in the pros. The pro teams that
have contacted Stanford about Geb have talked
about moving him to free safety. The 49ers feel that
Church is "fast enough and tough enough to cover

the big tight ends in the pros."
Church, a three-year starter for the Cards, runs a
4.8 forty and has excellent range. Hecker, who
intercepted 23 passes himself during six seasons
in the NFL before becoming head coach of the
Atlanta Falcons and finally defensive coordinator
at Stanford, feels that Church "would make an
outstanding free safety. Given a chance he is a very
good prospect."
Mulgoon felt that there were other Cardinal
players who would be drafted; center Todd Ander
son is one. This was Anderson's first full season at
center where "he played well all year long," Mul
goon said.
Two other pro prospects from the offensive line
are Tom Tipton, a 6-foot-3, 244 pound guard and
tight end Ted Pappas. Both players should get a
chance according to Mulgoon, although neither
may be drafted very high.
Initially surprising is Mulgoon's belief that third
string quarterback Jerry Wadvogel will probably
go sometime late in the draft. Mulgoon points out
however, that "although we (the 49ers) haven't
seen Wadvogel play since last year, he's got a
strong arm and it would be worthwhile for some
one to bring him to training camp." This statement
is even less surprising considering the fact that in
Wadvogel's only start of his career at Stanford he
completed 21 of 40 passes for 227 yards and a
touchdown in the Card's 21-16 loss to Michigan
last year. Not bad credentials for a "third string"
quarterback.
Mulgoon's basic opinion that Stanford has a
number of excellent college players, but no out
standing pro prospects. Cal, he countered, has
some outstanding prospects (such as Chuck Mun
cie and Steve Rivera) but not as many good college
players. When Mulgoon discusses excellent col
lege players he talks about players like Billy Sing
ler, Ray Anderson, A 1 Tenßruggencate, Sig Os
