# Bart's return axed 49ers
## 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Former Cal All-American and
Atlanta Falcon quarterback Steve
Bartkowski returns to the Bay
Area next week for the second
time this season, this trip
probably won't be quite as reward
ing as the previous one. Last
month, the Falcons beat the San
Francisco 49ers, 17-3, at Candles
tick Park. Next Sunday, however,
Atlanta will be in Oakland to play
the Raiders in one of the National
Football League's more blatant
mismatches.
Bartkowski, the first player cho
sen in the most recent pro draft,
has helped revive an Atlanta of
fense that ranked last in the NFL
last year. The Falcons averaged
just 7.9 points per game last year,
and scored 10 points or less in 10
of their 14 games. Atlanta's
greatest offensive output in 1974
was 17 points against Pittsburgh,
of all teams.
"Our basic attitude is that that's
all in the past," Bart said. "We're
starting out anew. It's us against
the world more or less. The press
was down on us last year and
rightfully so."
Bartkowski started in all of
Atlanta's games this season until
injuring his elbow a few weeks
ago. He should return to the start
ing lineup tomorrow against the
Denver Broncos.
About his adjustment to pro
football, Bart said "I am pleased
with my progress, but not with my
performance. I'm not very satis
fied if I can't get over 50 percent
(completions) passing.
"The coaches have been great. I
make mistakes and they leave me

in there. I feel fortunate to have a
guy like (ex-Cleveland Browns
quarterback) Bill Nelsen on the
sidelines helping me out."
Bart said he has continued to
follow Cal football. "I've been
watching (Cal) all the time. If
there's a better tailback in the na
tion than Chuck Muncie, I've
never seen him. If he doesn't win
the Heisman Trophy I'll be sur
prised. I've seen other guys play
and there's just nobody like old
Muncie."
Bartkowski apparently doesn't
miss playing on the West Coast. In
fact, he has adjusted so well to At
lanta that he already says, "ya'll."
"I'm being treated pretty well
down in Atlanta," he said. "If I
had to pick a place to play outside
the Bay Area, that'd be the place.
Right now I wouldn't trade At
lanta for anything.
"I love the Bay Area and I love
Atlanta. I'm going to have a tough
time deciding where to live in the
off-season."
