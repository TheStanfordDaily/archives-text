# And in this corner...
## Gerald Wilson is unpublicized, not unnoticed

"Be silent and safe - silence never
betrays you."
-John Boyce O'Reilly
The quarterbacks are drowning
in editorials and the receivers
make headlines every other week.
The defensive backs, meanwhile,
remain the most invisible men on
the team.
Most players are recognized
each time they do something
right, but the only time a defen
sive back draws attention is when
he has done something wrong. So
each one must face the paradox of
finding his greatest recognition in
anonymitv.
Gerald Wilson, the soft-spoken
safety for Stanford, has lived with
this fate and fared better than
most. After the Cardinals' "upset"
tie with "Michigan early in the sea

son, Wilson was named NCAA de
fensive back-of-the-week. Four
weeks later Gerald was again rec
ognized; this time as Pacific-8 de
fensive back-of-the-week for his
performance in the Washington
game.
But despite these accolades,
Wilson plays in relative obscurity.
At times early in the season, most
notably during the San Jose game,
the defensive backfield wasn't as
obscure as they might have liked
to be.
"We play a little worse each
year against San Jose State. It is
easy for them to get up for us,"
Wilson says. He noted that the op
posite was true of Stanford. "We
can't get up for every game. We sat
back and waited for someone else
to do our job."
The second half of last week's

game against Oregon saw a simi
lar letdown in the secondary. "We
lack the killer instinct," said Wil
son referring to Stanford's inabil
ity to put away the Ducks after
being on top 33-3. Wilson's con
clusion was, "We play good
enough to win."
That is all any Stanford fan can
hope for in today's Big Game. The
secondary should have its hands
full with Cal All-American pros
pect Steve Rivera. Wilson and his
defensive co-horts, however have
prepared nothing special to stop
Rivera this afternoon. "If we over
play Rivera, Cal has Wesley
Walker on the other side. And we
can't overplay the pass when they
have Muncie in the backfield."
Defensive backfield coach Wil
liw Shaw indicated that Wilson
will be spending much of this af
ternoon covering tight end George
Freitas. When naming the differ
ences between Wilson's play last
year and this year Shaw mentiond
one thing, "Confidence. Gerald's
had the ability all along. This year
he has the confidence to put the
ability to work."
Wilson has proved himself cap
able of producing the big play.
Against Washington, Wilson
made the tackle that saved a
touchdown late in the game on a
fifty yard pass play from Chris
Rowland to Scott Phillips.
Wilson's biggest attribute as a
safety, however, is his consis
tency, according to Shaw. This
consistency is evidence in the de
fensive statistics where Wilson's
71 tackles lead all secondary men
and place him six overall on the
team.
Shaw says enthusiastically of
Wilson's coachabiity, "He's
super, fie works hard and that's
why he's so consistent. You can
see that had work in his studies
too. When he graduates in June he
will receive both his BA and MA."
Wilson is receiving his degrees in
economics. He would like to work
for a year or two and then attend
business school.
Today Gerald Wilson will not
have much time to contemplate
his future. There is a great sense of
immediacy in the job cut out for
him. It is a demanding job and
even when peformed correctly
may not result in more than a
paragraph of praise. But for Gerald
Wilson the highest form of praise
may simply be continued
anonymity.
