# Cordova's fall: a case of paradise lost
## the new number two speaks from a different perspective 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
A group of Stanford students
were discussing football and the
Big Came at dinner earlier this
week. Inevitably, Mike Cordova
and Guy Benjamin became the
subjects of the conversation.
"I think the greatest thing that
could happen in the Big Game
would be if Benjamin started and
Cordova came in toward the end
to win it for Stanford," said one
student sympathetic to Cordova.
"Are you a friend of Cordova's
or something?" responded
another Card fan. The implication
was that only a personal friend
would wish Cordova well.
Such is Mike Cordova's im
mense appeal on the Farm. Some
day, even an opposing player may
be accorded as much adverse at
tention as he has received from
many Stanford fans.

Talking to a reporter outside the
Cards' locker room, Cordova does
not show the enthusiasm one
might expect from a player whose
team is playing for the Rose Bowl.
He just doesn't smile a lot. Cor
dova gives the impression of
someone trying his best to main
tain a positive attitude in a largely
hostile environment.
About the boos from the Stan
ford student section which often
greet a Cordova incompletion, the
junior quarterback says,"I try not
to let it bother me. But looking at
the films and what I've done
lately, I don't know, maybe it has.
Maybe some of that stuff has rub
bed off on me."
Cordova said he doesn't under
stand why people boo. "I've never
in my life booed anybody, because
I don't think it's fair. I wouldn't
boo guys playing a tennis match

or guys playing IM volleyball.
They're just people trying to do
the best they can, and have fun
doing something they like to do."
Neither did Cordova say he ap
preciated being "badmouthed" by
the press. He told the reporter,
"When you told me you were from
the Daily, I had a good idea not to
talk to you. You guys haven't done
me any good."
Cordova said that, while the
fans and the press haven't taken
the fun out of the game for him,
he'd probably rather play on the
road than at Stanford Stadium.
"Like you said, it seems like
whatever I do, I get booed around
here," Cordova said. "I think it
would probably be my natural in
stinct to want to play somewhere
else.
"... I still enjoy the game. It's
my favorite thing to do. It (the bo
oing) is just an externality I've got
to put out of my mind."
Cordova said coach Jack Christ
iansen has started Benjamin at
quarterback recently "to appease"
the student body and alumni, and
not because Cordova was playing
badly.
"I feel I've played really well up
until the Washington game. After
that, I don't really feel I was given
a fair chance to play.
"In every game I came out of, I
was ahead. Benjamin never went
into a game when he was behind.
So I don't think it (being removed)
was because I was playing bad."
Cordova criticized
Christiansen's present policy of
alternating quarterbacks in the
same game, even when it means
additional playing time for him.
Cordova said he didn't like going
into the Oregon game last
weekend in the second quarter
after Benjamin had built a 19-0
lead.
"I don't like playing in those
situations," Cordova said. "If the
quarterback's doing the job, then
let him play. I didn't like it when
Guy came in for me, and I don't
like doing it to him. I don't think
it's right either way."
The season turned around for
both Cordova and Stanford in the
USC game. Cordova was put in an

interesting position as the Cards
became legitimate Rose Bowl con
tenders with him on the sidelines
(Benjamin played most of the
game). He said not having contri
buted as much as he had hoped in
the game was of secondary impor
tance.
"I was really glad we won,"
Cordova said. "That was the main
thing. Hell, we beat SC and we've
got a good shot at the Rose Bowl."
And so Benjamin starts today,
but Cordova is likely to play. The
Big Game will definitely elimi
nate either Cal or Stanford from
the Rose Bowl race. Whether even

it can overshadow Stanford's
quarterback controversy is some
thing else again.
