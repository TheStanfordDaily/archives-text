# DiBiaso, Cards bring back the 'hoops'
## for both Stanford and its new coach this could be a long basketball season 
### BOB DEAN 
Amid all the publicity about the Big
Game and a possible Rose Bowl bid, the
Stanford Athletic D> partment would like
to remind everyone that the Cards are also
fielding a basketball team this winter.
Overshadowed by the exploits of the
football team, Stanford's cagers have in
deed been practicing for the past five and
one half weeks. This Wednesday they will
open their schedule against the Au
stralian Nationals. The official season
opener is Saturday against Nevada Reno.
Both games are at Maples Pavilion at 8 p.m.
In addition to ushering in a brand new
season, Stanford also welcomes new head
coach, Dick Dißiaso, replacing Howie
Dallmar, who resigned after 21 years.
Dißiaso, who has trouble containing his
enthusiasm, promises an exciting brand of
basketball. "I've always been associated
with aggressive, pressing, quick teams," he

says. "It's an exciting style of play for the
fans and players."
Fresh off the Notre Dame campus where
he was an assistant, Dißiaso faces a night
marish rebuilding program. Gone are four
starters from last year's 12-14 team. In
cluded in that foursome is All-American
Center Rich Kelley, who is now exploring
Bourbon Street, and playing for the New
Orleans Jazz.
But Dißiaso isn't discouraged. "I'm just
happy to be able to compete in one of the
best conferences in the country, and also
coach at one of the truly outstanding
academic institutions in the world."
Since joining the Stanford ranks last
spring, Dißiaso has wasted little time in
recruiting talent. New to Stanford fans this
year will be freshman guards Wolfe Perry
and Paul Giovacchini, and JC forwards
George Schader (B-foot-6) and Jeff McHugh
(6-8).

The lone returning starter from last
year's squad is 6-8 forward and captain Ed
Schweitzer. While averaging 15.5 points
and 8 rebounds, Schweitzer also grabbed
second team All Pac-8 honors. "The nuc
leus of our team begins with Ed," says Di-
Biaso. "I'm just amazed everyday in prac
tice to see how many times he happens to
be around the ball." With the loss of Kelley,
Schweitzer will be looked to even more.
Also back are guards Jay Carter (4.3 ppg.)
and Mike Bratz (4.9 ppg.) each of who were
impressive spot starters a year ago, and
6-11 center Tim Patterson (7.5 ppg.).
"I expect Jay to develop into an outstand
ing defensive guard. He'll be considered
one of the best in the Pac-8 this year. Bratz,
who is a great outside shooter and leaper,
has already been deemed floor 'general.' I
prefer to call him my floor general, rather
than quarterback," joked Dißiaso. "1 don't
want to start another controversy after

football season."
In addition to rebuilding, Dißiaso also
faces a challenging schedule. "Last year
Stanford's schedule was rated the fourth
toughest in the nation," says the new
coach, "and this year's is equally difficult."
While having to play all the Pac-8 teams
twice, the Cardinals will also face USF,
Minnesota, Marquette, and Hawaii.
Despite the awesome list of opponents
Dißiaso remains optimistic. "We're not so
concerned about predicting wins or losses
as we are about being successful," he said.
"All we're trying to do is play to our poten
tial and work, to our maximum. If we do that
and don't win, we're still successful — it's
just a matter of talent."

open their schedule against the Au
stralian Nationals. The official season
opener is Saturday against Nevada Reno.
Both games are at Maples Pavilion at 8 p.m.
In addition to ushering in a brand new
season, Stanford also welcomes new head
coach, Dick Dißiaso, replacing Howie
Dallmar, who resigned after 21 years.
Dißiaso, who has trouble containing his
enthusiasm, promises an exciting brand of
basketball. "I've always been associated
with aggressive, pressing, quick teams," he

says. "It's an exciting style of play for the
fans and players."
Fresh off the Notre Dame campus where
he was an assistant, Dißiaso faces a night
marish rebuilding program. Gone are four
starters from last year's 12-14 team. In
cluded in that foursome is All-American
Center Rich Kelley, who is now exploring
Bourbon Street, and playing for the New
Orleans Jazz.
But Dißiaso isn't discouraged. "I'm just
happy to be able to compete in one of the
best conferences in the country, and also
coach at one of the truly outstanding
academic institutions in the world."
Since joining the Stanford ranks last
spring, Dißiaso has wasted little time in
recruiting talent. New to Stanford fans this
year will be freshman guards Wolfe Perry
and Paul Giovacchini, and JC forwards
George Schader (B-foot-6) and Jeff McHugh
(6-8).

The lone returning starter from last
year's squad is 6-8 forward and captain Ed
Schweitzer. While averaging 15.5 points
and 8 rebounds, Schweitzer also grabbed
second team All Pac-8 honors. "The nuc
leus of our team begins with Ed," says Di-
Biaso. "I'm just amazed everyday in prac
tice to see how many times he happens to
be around the ball." With the loss of Kelley,
Schweitzer will be looked to even more.
Also back are guards Jay Carter (4.3 ppg.)
and Mike Bratz (4.9 ppg.) each of who were
impressive spot starters a year ago, and
6-11 center Tim Patterson (7.5 ppg.).
"I expect Jay to develop into an outstand
ing defensive guard. He'll be considered
one of the best in the Pac-8 this year. Bratz,
who is a great outside shooter and leaper,
has already been deemed floor 'general.' I
prefer to call him my floor general, rather
than quarterback," joked Dißiaso. "1 don't
want to start another controversy after

football season."
In addition to rebuilding, Dißiaso also
faces a challenging schedule. "Last year
Stanford's schedule was rated the fourth
toughest in the nation," says the new
coach, "and this year's is equally difficult."
While having to play all the Pac-8 teams
twice, the Cardinals will also face USF,
Minnesota, Marquette, and Hawaii.
Despite the awesome list of opponents
Dißiaso remains optimistic. "We're not so
concerned about predicting wins or losses
as we are about being successful," he said.
"All we're trying to do is play to our poten
tial and work, to our maximum. If we do that
and don't win, we're still successful — it's
just a matter of talent."
