# Winter seasons near
## Swimmers, fencers expect strong seasons again 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Don't take that heavy course
load next quarter for the winter
sports promise to take up where
their fall counterparts left off. One
phrase summarizes the general
outlook, "Young and exciting."
Stanford's men's swimming
team, which is expected to finish
in the top five of the nation will try
to fill the holes left by graduated
sprinter Dean Anderson and back
stroker Randy Whitchurch, and
last year's sensation Mike Bruner
who is training for the coming
Olympic trials, with a team that
Coach Jim Gaughran has rated as
the best overall in depth in Stan
ford history.
Returning to action will be vete
rans John Mencken, who holds all
NCAA, American, and world re
cords in the breaststroke along
with Stanford record holder in the
50 and 100 meter freestyle, junior
Dave Fairbank.
The women's team resembles
that of the men's in that it too has
improved its chances for the 1976
AIAW Collegiate Championships
with the likes of freshman Jo Har
shbarger, American record
holder for the 1950 freestyle
and backstroker Leslie Crozier,
who coach Gaughran rates
as the top women backstroker
in Stanford history.
They will be joining national
point winners Vicki Hays, back
strokeand individual medley,and
Ann Brodell, middle distance
freestyle.
Stanford's men's wrestling
team will try to improve last year's
15-9 dual meet record, the best in
Stanford history and its sixth
place showing in the Pac-8. Even
though the Cards lost champion
Chris Horpel through graduation,
coach Joe DeMeo has called this
year's team the best balanced he's
had to work with.
"As a team we are stronger this
year. There are not as many out
standing individuals, but I look to
John Govea and Ken Krebs to lead
the team to an improved showing
this year," he said.
In men's gymnastics, the Cards
still boast the three-time NCAA
side-horse champion Ted Marcy,
however the team as a whole lost

two vital components in Dean
Anderson and Hector Neff.
"In losing Dean and Hector, we
have been quite weak in the all
around category. We will have to
try to improve on the parallel and
high bars before we can compete
with the likes of Cal," said Coach
Sadao Hamada.
Still in a rebuilding period after
the loss last year of captain Larry
Lieberman and three other
players, the Stanford rugby team
will try to boost the 6-8-1 record it
posted last season.
Due to lack of experience, most
of the Cardinal output will come
from graduates Eric Cross and
Gary Kheote and senior John Car
roll in building Stanford into a
serious contender in the Northern
California Rugby Football Union.
Stanford's men's and women's
fencing squads come off of an out
standing season last year in pre
paring for this year's competition.

In the men's division, the Cards,
who finished first overall in the
Norcal Conference and second
overall in the Western Intercol
legiate Conference are paced by
returning fencers Steve Walt and
Dennis Leybold. The women will
be led by captain Marie Fiatarone
and a squad that finished third in
the Norcals behind league leader
Cal.
Rounding out the season's pic
ture is an improved women's bas
ketball squad. Boasting the tallest
team in their newly-formed divi
sion, the women will attempt to
better their forth place finish in
the NClACtournamentlast season.
The women's team will once
again rely on veterans Sukie jack
son, Katy Levinson, and Maggie
Nelson for their offensive output
in their attempt to beat their
toughest opposition Cal State
Chico for the North League
championship.

who is training for the coming
Olympic trials, with a team that
Coach Jim Gaughran has rated as
the best overall in depth in Stan
ford history.
Returning to action will be vete
rans John Mencken, who holds all
NCAA, American, and world re
cords in the breaststroke along
with Stanford record holder in the
50 and 100 meter freestyle, junior
Dave Fairbank.
The women's team resembles
that of the men's in that it too has
improved its chances for the 1976
AIAW Collegiate Championships
with the likes of freshman Jo Har
shbarger, American record
holder for the 1950 freestyle
and backstroker Leslie Crozier,
who coach Gaughran rates
as the top women backstroker
in Stanford history.
They will be joining national
point winners Vicki Hays, back
strokeand individual medley,and
Ann Brodell, middle distance
freestyle.
Stanford's men's wrestling
team will try to improve last year's
15-9 dual meet record, the best in
Stanford history and its sixth
place showing in the Pac-8. Even
though the Cards lost champion
Chris Horpel through graduation,
coach Joe DeMeo has called this
year's team the best balanced he's
had to work with.
"As a team we are stronger this
year. There are not as many out
standing individuals, but I look to
John Govea and Ken Krebs to lead
the team to an improved showing
this year," he said.
In men's gymnastics, the Cards
still boast the three-time NCAA
side-horse champion Ted Marcy,
however the team as a whole lost

two vital components in Dean
Anderson and Hector Neff.
"In losing Dean and Hector, we
have been quite weak in the all
around category. We will have to
try to improve on the parallel and
high bars before we can compete
with the likes of Cal," said Coach
Sadao Hamada.
Still in a rebuilding period after
the loss last year of captain Larry
Lieberman and three other
players, the Stanford rugby team
will try to boost the 6-8-1 record it
posted last season.
Due to lack of experience, most
of the Cardinal output will come
from graduates Eric Cross and
Gary Kheote and senior John Car
roll in building Stanford into a
serious contender in the Northern
California Rugby Football Union.
Stanford's men's and women's
fencing squads come off of an out
standing season last year in pre
paring for this year's competition.

In the men's division, the Cards,
who finished first overall in the
Norcal Conference and second
overall in the Western Intercol
legiate Conference are paced by
returning fencers Steve Walt and
Dennis Leybold. The women will
be led by captain Marie Fiatarone
and a squad that finished third in
the Norcals behind league leader
Cal.
Rounding out the season's pic
ture is an improved women's bas
ketball squad. Boasting the tallest
team in their newly-formed divi
sion, the women will attempt to
better their forth place finish in
the NClACtournamentlast season.
The women's team will once
again rely on veterans Sukie jack
son, Katy Levinson, and Maggie
Nelson for their offensive output
in their attempt to beat their
toughest opposition Cal State
Chico for the North League
championship.
