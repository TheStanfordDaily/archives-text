# Notes from the Band
## 
### BLAINE E. PALMER 
The L. Stanford, Jr. U. M. Band is extremely
proud this week to have the honor of revealing, to
the Students, Alumni, Cal Weenies, and all our
spectators, the new Stanford Mascot. It is with
great humility and a basic lack of decency that we
salute the Personification of our Fighting Spirit
which will lead us into the battle both on the field
of play and in the classroom, our new symbol: The
Stanford Tree.
This mighty shaft, emblazoned on the Stanford
Seal, symbolizes with nobility the spirit of Inde
pendence, Valor, and Steadfastness that are the
trademark of Stanford Athletic Endeavor.
And it's organic.
"EL PALO ALTO" — the Big Stick — actually a
mutant bean plant which grew to unheard ot size
and escaped from Luther Burbank's garden, travel
led up the cost astride a great Desert Banana Slug,
which had been terrorizing the Creamy Caramelita
Nuns, establishing at that time their mission, nes
tled in the foothills, on the spotvvhere the Wilbur
Food Service now stands. The Tree harnassed the
awesome talents of the Banana Slug to its own
purposes, thereby becoming the object of the
Nuns' appreciation, as well as the object of the
rather unusual rites they performed in connection
with their vows of celibacy. Although the Order
has long since disappeared, it has left its legacy,
and the traditions are still carried on. Legend has it
that should the honor of a Stanford Woman be
besmirched, the spirits of the Creamy C-lites will
rise up, take the offender and tie him to El Palo
Alto, the earth shall shake, and a fissure open up
totally swallowing up the Tree and its helpless
victim, both disappearing forever into the Bio De
partment. where men shall weep and gnash their
teeth.
PRE-GAME SHOW
The Pre-game will begin with the usual

FANFARE and the forming of Stanford's tradi
tional TREE. To provide equal time for those who
continue to kiss Axe, we form the other symbol of
Stanford Fighting Spirit. Next we salute the Gol
den Weenies of the University of Kalifornia, with
spellout KAL KAN(t). Declaring our intention to
turn the Weenies into dog meat, we inform them
that YOU'RE NO GOOD.
And then to depict Stanford's future, we spell
out ROSES, with a Big S for Stanford, urging fans:
DON'T YOU WORRY 'BOUT A THING.
The Band then continues as usual, forming the
U.S.A. for our NATIONAL ANTHEM, and leaving
the field with WE'RE AN AMERICAN BAND.
HALFTIME SHOW
The Halftime will present a look at the Stanford
Mascot: Past, Possible, and Future.
Our first formation, taken from a suggestion that
we become the "Integrals," we form the Integral of
eto the x, or J"e x . Beginning to see the pos
sibilities for this idea, we play I THINK I SEE THE
LIGHT.
Secondly we form a "Poorboy" sandwich, an
ironical reference, bringing out the best of our
well-founded elitism against public schools. Joe
Stanford buys his way to higher education and
earns himself the right to say AND I DON'T WANT
NOBODY (who doesn't play polo to be my
roommate!).
Next a Cobra rising out of a basket, to symbolize
the one-time Stanford (East) Indian, whose magi
cal charming powers on the Skin Flute have
earned him a spot PLAYING IN THE BAND.
And finally, we will present to the fans our new
mascot, who will be unveiled during the halftime,
to the strains of a familiar Lumberjack song, the
Incomparables then marching into our salute to
the new symbol with the spellout BIG STICK rec
ognizing the TREE, with YOU'RE SO WONDER
FUL, SO MARVELOUS.
