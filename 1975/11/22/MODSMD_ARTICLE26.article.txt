The crowd settles itself onto the
warm benches, when suddenly an
explosion resounds through the
stadium. The fans turn towards
the exits, fearing that an earth
quake is about to swallow the
stadium. But in the next instant,
the University of California
marching band swarms on to the
field and entrenches itself on the
gridiron in perfect formation. The
members stand erect, their heads
held high, their bodies clothed in
identical glistening uniforms. The
California fanfare rings out with
crystal clarity, matching the pre
cision of the band.
As the Stanford band straggles
on to the field, the fans acknow
ledge that the earthquake has fi
nally struck. The members are a
portrait of entropy, lovable in
their dishevelment. They drag
themselves onto the grass, collid
ing with one another as they
search aimlessly for their proper
positions. The gorilla, the football
helmet, and the female doll being
devoured by a "Jaws" tuba, make
it clear that the unifying theme of
Stanford's band is defiant absur
dity. Only their music defies this
recklessness.

To the average layman on the
street, U.C. Berkeley represents
student activism, and the accom
panying revolutionary disregard
for conventional values. On the
other hand, Stanford University
has traditionally been associated
with wealth and conservatism. To
look at the regimented discipline
of the Cal band versus the care
free insolence of Stanford's band,
the contradiction between each
band and the traditional character
of its student body could not be
more ironic.
Stanford's band prides itself for
its cocky, audacious humor. Re
cent routines, such as tributes to
Patty Hearst and the CIA, and an
erotic rendition of the Soyuz-
Apollo docking mission, give
ample evidence of their foolhar
diness. Although comedy is an in
tegral part of the Cal band as well,
this band generally confines its
humor amoung its own members.
For example, one present
member tells the story of cymbals
player Lucien Simon, Cal class of
'34, whose cognomen has been
enshrined over the years as
"Cymbal Simon."
The Cal band's major function is
to instill football spirit in the Cal
rooters. The members see them
selves as an essential element of
the Berkeley athletic scene; the
band and the teams are inextrica
bly tied. The LSJUMB prides itself
in its irreverence. It views itself as
an independent entity, worthy of
praise whether associated with a
team, or entertaining crowds on
its own.
There can be no doubt that both
Cal and Stanford students love
their bands. The question circulat
ing around certain Stanford cir
cles is whether Stanford loves its
band more than its team.

erotic rendition of the Soyuz-
Apollo docking mission, give
ample evidence of their foolhar
diness. Although comedy is an in
tegral part of the Cal band as well,
this band generally confines its
humor amoung its own members.
For example, one present
member tells the story of cymbals
player Lucien Simon, Cal class of
'34, whose cognomen has been
enshrined over the years as
"Cymbal Simon."
The Cal band's major function is
to instill football spirit in the Cal
rooters. The members see them
selves as an essential element of
the Berkeley athletic scene; the
band and the teams are inextrica
bly tied. The LSJUMB prides itself
in its irreverence. It views itself as
an independent entity, worthy of
praise whether associated with a
team, or entertaining crowds on
its own.
There can be no doubt that both
Cal and Stanford students love
their bands. The question circulat
ing around certain Stanford cir
cles is whether Stanford loves its
band more than its team.
The crowd settles itself onto the
warm benches, when suddenly an
explosion resounds through the
stadium. The fans turn towards
the exits, fearing that an earth
quake is about to swallow the
stadium. But in the next instant,
the University of California
marching band swarms on to the
field and entrenches itself on the
gridiron in perfect formation. The
members stand erect, their heads
held high, their bodies clothed in
identical glistening uniforms. The
California fanfare rings out with
crystal clarity, matching the pre
cision of the band.
As the Stanford band straggles
on to the field, the fans acknow
ledge that the earthquake has fi
nally struck. The members are a
portrait of entropy, lovable in
their dishevelment. They drag
themselves onto the grass, collid
ing with one another as they
search aimlessly for their proper
positions. The gorilla, the football
helmet, and the female doll being
devoured by a "Jaws" tuba, make
it clear that the unifying theme of
Stanford's band is defiant absur
dity. Only their music defies this
recklessness.

To the average layman on the
street, U.C. Berkeley represents
student activism, and the accom
panying revolutionary disregard
for conventional values. On the
other hand, Stanford University
has traditionally been associated
with wealth and conservatism. To
look at the regimented discipline
of the Cal band versus the care
free insolence of Stanford's band,
the contradiction between each
band and the traditional character
of its student body could not be
more ironic.
Stanford's band prides itself for
its cocky, audacious humor. Re
cent routines, such as tributes to
Patty Hearst and the CIA, and an
erotic rendition of the Soyuz-
Apollo docking mission, give
ample evidence of their foolhar
diness. Although comedy is an in
