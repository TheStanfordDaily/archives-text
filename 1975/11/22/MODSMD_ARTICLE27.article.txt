The Race for the Roses heads toward the wire, with Stanford, Cal
and UCLA vying for the first place finish. All the Pacific Eight teams
engage in their traditional big game rivalries, which means all previ
ous records, statistics, and standings can be thrown out, because, as
the cliche goes, anything can happen.
California and Stanford have the spotlight this weekend as UCLA
and USC wait until November 28 for their crosstown clash. In the
Northwest, Oregon State takes on Oregon in the Civil War at Eugene,
while Washington State visits Washington in the battle for the Apple
Trophy.
UCLA will, of course, try to avenge the 34-9 rout it suffered last year
at the hands of USC, and that's all that has to happen to enable the
Bruins to go to the Rose Bowl. If they do so, John McKay will be
departing with a 3-4 conference record and sitting in an unaccus
tomed spot — fifth place. Eor once USC is the underdog, and Stanford
fans, despite their deep down hatred of the Trojans, better hope USC
can get it together if the Cards win today.
Ricky Bell rushed for 190 yards in the Trojans' 8-7 loss to Washing
ton. breaking O.J. Simpson's Pac-8 rushing record with 1739 yards. He
needs only 143 yards to break the NCAA record of 1881 held by Ed
Marinaro.
The Bruins, coming off a 31-9 triumph over Oregon State, are led by
quarterback John Sciarra and runningback Wendell Tyler. Sciarra,
with help, unleashed an aerial attack against the Beavers of 247 yards
and Wendell Tyler eclipsed the 1000-yard rushing mark last week.
If Sciarra and Tyler get the passing and running together, Stanford
and Cal will probably be watching the Rose Bowl on TV. On the other
hand, for John McKay to lose four in a row would take a major
misalignment in his astrological chart. McKay likes losing almost as
much as he likes playing in Stanford Stadium.
Both Washington and Washington State are coming off big wins
from last week. The Huskies scored on a safety and a 12-yard run by
freshman Creg Martin to stun USC; the victory marking the first time
since 1964 Washington has defeated both UCLA and USC in one
season. Washington State, winless in the conference, took all its frust
rations out on Idaho by erupting for 84 points. In that 84-27 win the
Cougars scored four touchdowns in the first quarter, four touchdowns
in the second quarter, three in the third and tacked on one in the
fourth.
Washington State, by the way, provided both Oregon and Oregon
State with its only conference victories and the Ducks and Beavers
will swim in Eugene to see who can better that 1-5 mark. Oregon
should have gained a lot of confidence after narrowly losing to Stan
ford 33-30. In that game Duck quarterback Jack Henderson blitzed the
Stanford secondary for 283 yards. Chuck Wills kept Oregon number
one in the conference in pass defense by intercepting two Guy Benja
min passes. The Ducks should waddle out ahead despite it being the
last game for Oregon State Coach Dee Andros, who leaves after but
another illustrious season in rainy Corvallis.
