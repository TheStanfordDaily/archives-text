The matchup
SERIES: Stanford leads with 36 Big Game victories to Gal's 31, the
game has ended in a deadlock 10 times. Stanford has won 11 of the
past 15 games, including last-year's contest in Berkeley.
COACHES: California Head Coach Mike White is in his fourth year on
the hill, and has an even 21-21-1 record. Stanford's Jack Christiansen
is also in his fourth year as head coach with a 24-16-3 record. Both
were assistants under John Ralston on the Farm during the Rose Bowl
years: Chris holds the Big Game edge with two wins in three games.
PASSING: Stanford is generally known as the "passing team" of the
Pacific Eight (probably because it is always passing by Rose Bowl
chances) but this year the team with the throwing stats is Cal. The
Bears' Joe Roth took over the Cal offense from Fred Besana at the
beginning of the season and Roth's performance to date has been
superb. He's thrown 13 touchdown passes and completed over 55
percent of his passes in leading the Golden Bears to a 5-1 conference
record. Number two, Fred Besana, got the nod at the beginning of the
season but was replaced when Roth proved more effective. In any case,
Basana lost close contests to number 10-ranked Colorado and West
Virginia, with an over-50 percent completion average.
Stanford lurks close behind Cal in passing offense, and admittedly
has the edge in numbers of quarterbacks with three. Mike Cordova
started amidst controversy for half the season, was at one time the
nation's leading passer, and led Stanford to an upset tie of Michigan
earlier this year.
It is Guy Benjamin who has electrified the crowds, however, and
appeased alumni with clutch performances in his spotty appearances
this season. Benjamin started and won against USC, and in his brief
season has thrown eight TD passes and completed almost 60 percent
of his throws. Benjamin was partially credited for last year's come
from-behind Big Game win. He's the starter today for the Cards, and
has the fans' confidence. For what it's worth. Meanwhile, Jerry Wald
vogel, the Cards' third-string tosser, continues as half of the game
winning field goal team and part-time headset wearer.
RECEIVING: Receiving and Steve Rivera have become pretty close to
the same thing over the past two seasons, as Cal's tack-fingered wide
receiver may be responsible for much of Cal's passing success. If you
throw it at him — even near him — he catches it. Which is always nice.
Wesley Walker is the Bears' secondary wide receiver, secondary only
because he hasn't caught as many passes as Rivera. Walker runs a 9.6
100, and averages 23 yards per reception. Chuck Muncie is also a
frequent Roth target.
The Cards' ace has been Tony Hill, who everyone calls "All-
American material"and who says he learned a lot from watching
Stanford's slower but trickier Bill Singler. Hill has caught 6 TD passes,
and is not much slower than Walker. Singler is quick and deceptive,
averaging 15 yards per catch. The Cards also throw to tight end Ted
Pappas who, at 6-foot-4, can get short yardage well, and runningback
Ron Inge.
RUSHING: Running is Chuck Muncie's business, and he's got a
monopoly on it. With 1294 yards gained this season the Heisman
Trophy is in sight. He adds an extremely dangerous versatility to the
Cal offense, which may be why they're number one in yardage in the
NCAA. Fullback Tom Newton is used for blocking, but has managed
to maintain a five-yards-per-carry average coming into today's game.
Stanford's running game has never been anything to write home
about, or even write about, but in the last half of the season it has
admittedly improved. Don Stevenson, Ron Inge and John Finley have
all been rushing well enough to make any defense wary. USC found
that out quickly. So did Army. But Cardinal coaches admit the Stan
ford running game is used primarily to open up the passing attack.
That fact may explain some of the success.
DEFENSE: Though Big Game scores are never outrageous, neither
Stanford nor Cal has an impressive, awesome, or overpowering de
fense . . . normally. Cal's defensive motivations seem to lay primarily
in preventing an opponent from outscoring the Bear offense, allowing
but 21 points a game while the offense averages 28. It will have to stop
a team that averages 31.
Stanford's defense has shown a recent uncanny ability to rise to the
occasion, thwarting the vaunted USC running game and coming up
with key series over the past few games. It has lapses, however, as in
last week's nightmarish pass coverage of Oregon, which can prove
fatal. The Cards will need to button up both the Bears' passing and the
Bears' running.
PUNTING: Cal's Greg Cummins averages 36 yards per punt
Stanford's proposed starter, Mike Michel, averages 32 (including one
left-footed -5 yarder, under extreme pressure against San Jose
State .. .).
KICKING: Mike Langford may have won the Big Game and a few other
big games for the Cardinals, but Cal's little Jim Breech is equally
competent. He's slightly better, statistically, than Langford in the field
goal department with 9 of 16 attempts while Langford is 9-18. Con
sider them equally devastating.
