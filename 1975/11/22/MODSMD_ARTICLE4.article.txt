# Cardinals face Bear facts today
## Cal has the stats, but it may take more to win this Big Game

BOULDER, Colorado (Sep
tember 13, 1975) — There was
something incongruous about the
California Golden Bears playing
Colorado at Folsom field. It was a
mismatch, one of three Mickey
Mouse football games the Buffs
had lined up before their Hig Eight
conference season commenced.
The fans were keyed (i.e. guzzled
to the gizzards) but mostly for a
romping victory by the favored

Golden Buffs, and a brief appear
ance by Ralphie and the guys in
the Leder's Western Wear outfits
who run around after her and get
trampled and all sorts of other
big-time college football colorful
activities.
But then a few guys named
Muncie and Rivera and Walker
came out on the field and made it
something else. Cal lost eventu
ally, 34-27, but it was close, and
even sleepy-eyed Buff Coach Bill

Mallory was impressed.
Now we're at the other end of
the season, at the BIG CAME
where all the fans are KEYED (i.e.
guzzled to the gizzard) because
this COULD BE the game for all
the ROSES and is, in any case, fil
led with axes and pranks and rah
rah and people running around
and getting trampled and all sorts
of other BIC TIME college football
activities.
But this time the situation is dif
ferent. Cal is the favorite by two
points, and at stake is more than a
touch of non-conference pride.
For the first time since 1949 both
teams are coming into this game
with a chance to represent the
Pacific Eight in the Rose Bowl.
"It has to be one of the biggest
Big Cames ever," said Cardinals
Head Coach Jack Christiansen last
week. "It's the biggest I've ever
been involved in during my eight
years at Stanford."
Cal has come a long way from
Boulder, most of it uphill. After
losing the first two games of the
season the Bears have rattled off
seven victories with but one loss
to (of course) UCLA, and are in
possession of one of the more im
pressive offenses in the NCAA. Joe
Roth has taken up where Steve
Bartkowski left off and put the
Bears atop the Pacific Eight in

total offense, and atop the nation
in net offensive yardage. The run
ning of Chuck Muncie compli
ments Roth's passing and gives
Cal a well-balanced attack. If they
have a weakness, it will be on de
fense.
The Cards will need every
clutch defensive play they can get,
and a good performance from
still-starting quarterback Cuy
Benjamin, his receivers and his
runni ngbacks. Chris put it
bluntly. "In order to win the ball
game we'll have to perform up to
our capabilities in some cases, and

above our capabilities in others.
The big thing will be to avoid mis
takes."
The big thing will be to win.
It seems pretty unreal, for either
school, to look back at how the
season began and where the sea
son has led. One of college
football's greatest rivalries (as
Gary Cavalli put it) returns for the
78th time, and it's definitely a Big
Game. Though the significance of
this game can be nullified by the
antics of those tumbling USCTro
jans, the name of the game, for a
day, is ROSE HOWL.
