## Benjamin shuns the hero guise 
### MARSHA ROBERTSON 
Everybody knows that an au
thentic football hero is the kind of
guy who drinks beer for breakfast,
lives in a letterman's jacket and
throws his fist through the wall if
a party starts to bore him. At Ohio
State, he receives personal checks
in the mail from satisfied alumni
and his favorite class at Alabama
is "The History of Sport."
But for some reason, Stanford
has never caught on. They keep
recruiting players who want to
take microbiology, spend the
summer in Europe or build their
own stereo speakers.
Stretched out on a leather couch
in a dark brown sweater and jeans,
Guy Benjamin shakes the hair out
of his eyes and admits that he does
own a letterman's jacket, but that's
where the comparison ends.
It is also where the Benjamin
fans begin. Swept up on the
shoulders of every student,
sportswriter and ticket scalper
within a 50-mile radius, he has
been called a saint, a celebrity, a
national monument and half the
senior class would like to draft
him as their commencement
speaker in June. If things continue
to get out of hand, he'll soon be
credited with the cure for the
common cold.
As Stanford's number one quar
terback, Guy Benjamin will head
onto the field today starting the

game and ending the season all at
the same time. He may be the only
athlete in the history of the school
to receive a standing ovation sim
ply for tying his shoes on the
sidelines. And although the Stan
ford quarterback controversy
made more noise this season than
the Stanford marching tubas, both
Mike Cordova and Guy Benjamin
have remained relatively silent
throughout. The same guy who
became an unsung hero at mid
season has become an unseen hero
as well.
Stopping between screams after
Stanford's revenge upon USC, one
student admitted, "I love
Benjamin . . . but I wouldn't rec
ognize him if he was standing in
front of me."
"I guess people do think that
I'm kind of a loner," says Guy.
"But I'd rather have a good time
with a few friends than cruise the
frats and talk football every
weekend. I'm glad to see people
are excited about the game, but by
Saturday night, I've had enough
football and I'm ready to relax."
Although Benjamin has
emerged victorious in Coach
Christiansen's version of musical
chairs, Guy knows that Cordova
will be in the running again next
year, and he is hesitant about ex
pressing his views.
"I know everyone is waiting for
me to speak out and say exactly

what I've been thinking all year
. . . about Christiansen . . . and
about Cordova, but I'm not going
to plaster my ideas around Palo
Alto for everyone to hear. People
who want to hear that can read the
National Enquirer if that's the
kind of thing they're into."
Early in the season, the fan's
favorite pastime was trying to
outguess Coach Christiansen's
motives for starting Cordova.
Many students gave up and in
sisted that Mike was his adopted
son, but several suggested that
Benjamin was too independent for
the coach, and apt to take more
risks than number 16. Still others,
such as Glenn Dickey, of the San
Francisco Chronicle, emphasized
the difference in their attitudes
during practice, proposing that
Cordova hustled, while Benjamin
only ran through the motions.
Guy replies, "I try to be an ag
gressive player on the field and 1
like to call theplays. But ifl ignore
a call, 1 have to have a pretty good
reason for doing it. As for Dickey's
theories about practice, I really
think he was on a crusade against
Chris and I resented being put in
the middle."
As a political science major who
is surrounded by teammates who
are often pre-meds or pre-law,
Benjamin is willing to admit that
he is pre-professional football. "I
don't have any big plans to be a
lawyer or a doctor and football is
something I might be a success
at."
Last year, Guy couldn't decide
whether to move into Delta Tau
Delta (football headquarters) or
Columbae (center for political

change). "I finally ended up at the
Delt House — they don't exactly
have a mad rush — and took a
room by the fire escape for a quick
exit. Those guys are all my
friends. 1 spend 75 percent of my
time with them, but still it's good
to get away.
This quarter, Guy rooms off

campus with Jerry YValdvogel,
Stanford's third QB. "We're both
pretty much alike," says Wald
vogel, "Schizophrenic ... a quar
terback has to be."
Benjamin explains, "We all be
come very aggressive on the field.
1 get violent — that's the nature of
the game. But off the field neither
of us are anything like that."
As an honors biology student,
Waldvogel is sill labeled as the
team's "student-athlete." He
frowns. "Still? I thought 1 was the
rowdy, happy-go-lucky lover."
Guy has taken full advantage of
Stanford programs and attended
Stanford-in-England during last
year's winter quarter. Although
comparatively few football
players attend overseas campuses,
he says,"The coaches didn't re
ally object. They thought it was a
nice idea, but I'm sure they would
have rather seen me stay here and
lift weights. I really learned a lot
overseas and I have a different
pespective on the U.S. But 1 only
stayed one quarter. So I could
come back for spring practice."
As a player with plenty of pres
sure ahead before the next spring
practice, Benjamin shifts the con
versation away from football.
Leaning across a table in his living
room, he picks up Waldvogel's
electric guitar.

Waldvogel chokes back a laugh.
"What are you trying to do? Give
away our fantasy?"
Benjamin stands and turns up
the volume on the stereo. "I don't
know if you're ready for this . . .
but Jerry and I have this fantasy
about being in a rock group . . .
onstage at Winterland." In fact all
these interviews remind me of a
song called "Top of the Pops" by
the Kinks."
He picks up the album cover
and tosses it on the table.
"And (J woman recognized me
and started to scream
This all seems like a crazy dream
I've been invited out to dinner
with a prominent queen
And now I've got friends that I
never knew 1 had before

It's strange how people want you
when your record's high
'Cause when it drops down, they
just pass you by
Now my agent just called and said
to me
"Son . . . you record just got lo
Number One."
