It was a muggy mid-July day,
when ABC brought its College
Football '75 promotion day to San
Francisco. The traveling road
show included such pre-season
stars as UCLA quarterback John
Sciarra and Pitt runningback
Tony Dorsett.
Even with a resume, Chuck
Muncie would have been as in
congruous as the bartender mix
ing drinks.
The promotion was, in the
words of one ABC executive, "a
chance to meet the Heisman
Trophy candidates." Someone fi
nally remembered that the Bay
Area also has a couple of good
football players and invited Cal,
Stanford and San Jose State to
send someone.
It's a good thing too. For
everyone on the ABC tour has
faded from Heisman Trophy con
sideration, faster than most of
Playboy Magazine sportswriter
Anson Mount's pre-season All-

Americans.
When Golden Bear Coach Mike
White and Muncie walked into
the room, only a few writers put
down their free drinks long
enough to say hello. Later, after
the stars had finished speaking,
Muncie was virtually ignored.
"Who's that guy?" asked a
sportswriter, devouring his prime
rib.
Today, just four months later,
Cal's Athletic Department is put
ting out a slick 18-page booklet
touting Muncie as its Heisman
Trophy candidate.
But just a few days before the
Big, Big, Big . . . Game, Muncie
doesn't seem that different from
the guv who walked into a room
full of sportswriters this July.
"I just want to win. I was never
built up to be a Heisman, so it's not
all that exciting to me," said Mun
cie.
Last year he gained just 45 yards
against a stingy Stanford defense
and Cal lost the game by a foot —
Mike Langford's right — in the
closing seconds. "That hurt, but
you have to give Stanford credit,"
said Muncie. "My first couple of

years, it (the Big Came) really
didn't impress me. Now I'm ex
cited. It's the Big Game."
Muncie gained 14:1 yards in
Cal's upset of LJSC and caught five
passes for 62 yards. He also
brought out Trojan Coach John
McKay's wit. "Muncie's a great
big youngster. He looks like the
side of a house running on the side
of the field," said McKay.
"He runs outside well, runs in
side well, he's blocking better
now and he catches the ball well
. . . He's an excellent, excellent
player."
Some might have doubted that
statement just a year ago. Sure,
Muncie had gained 791 yards
rushing, but he had only two
100-yard rushing games. Besides,
the Colden Bears had almost all
everything Steve Bartkowski re
writing the Cal passing records
last year.
"I wasn't worried about losing
Bart (this year)," said Muncie.
"It's different though. Having him
took some of the pressure off me,
but 1 have taken up some of the
slack."
