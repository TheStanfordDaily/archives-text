# Two hurt in Bonfire disturbance
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
A drunken crowd composed mainly
of youths hurled bottles and rocks at
firefighters and injured one police of
ficer following last Friday night's Big
Game Bonfire at Lake Lagunita,
Robert McKenzie, 20, of Los Altos
Hills was booked early Saturday morn
ing at the North Santa Clara County Jail
on one charge of assault with a deadly
weapon on a police officer. McKenzie
is still in custody with bail set at
$3000.
Five juveniles were cited with fail
ure to disperse and resisting arrest and
were then released to their parents cus
tody.
The problems began around 9 p.m.,
when most of the Bonfire's 5000 spec
tators had left. "At that time there were
only 500 to 800 people remaining.
They were all drunk or stoned, throw
ing things and running into the fire,"
said Bob Ottilie, Inter Fraternity Coun
cil president.
Security insufficient
Ottilie said the 20 fraternity sec
urity men and five hired police offices
were unable to restrain the crowd.
Bonfire organizers had estimated that
there would only be about 50 people
still at the Bonfire around 9 p.m. just as
with last year's crowd.
After sensing that the security force
was inadequate, "I called the Stanford
police and the Palo Alto police. They
requested the fire department to extin
guish the fire," Ottilie said.
After the police and fire trucks ar
rived, the firefighters found them
selves targets of the crowd. Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer of Stanford Police Services
then declared the gathering an unlaw
ful assembly, and most of the juveniles
left the area. The firefighters departed
the scene after dousing the remains of
the Bonfire.
Stanford police officer Wayne War
wick was struck by a rock in the back of
the head. One fraternity security man
was injurd by a bottle. He was taken to
Stanford Hospital and released.
Dispersion finished
Sixteen Stanford officers, Palo Alto
police and Santa Clara County sheriff's
deputies finished dispersing the re
maining youths around 10 p.m.
"The fraternity security guards
grabbed a few of the rock throwers for
the police, and one fraternity man also
identified (McKenzie)," Ottilie said.
Ottilie added that he had requested
two weeks ago that the fire department
extinguish the blaze at 9 p.m., but they
informed him that the fire should be
allowed to burn itself out. "Next year
we'd like to have the fire put out at 8:30
or 9 when the inside has burned out
and before the crowd gets unruly," he
said.

Ottilie pointed out that "the crowd
behavior was as bad as last year, and
three people got hurt then. This year
nobody in the crowd got hurt with our
security arrangements." He also said,
"1 don't regret calling in the police.
They did a great job."
