# Minority admissions quotas unfair
## 
### 
Minority admissions and financial aid are
issues which have been widely discussed in
recent years.
After extensive debate, standards for ap
portioning financial aid at Stanford were
revised somewhat last year. However,
minority admissions policies, here and at
other U.S. universities, still need to be reex
amined.
To avoid confusion, a definition of
"quota" is needed. I am using this word as
"an arbitrary exemption from standard pol
icy."
Also keep in mind that "minorities" is
being used here in a very strict sense. The
word refers to people who are in a minority
because of any factor (e.g. height, race, sex,
age or language, to name just a few.)
Different basis
According to a report of University Af
firmative Action officer Robert Rosenzweig
"they (minority students of Stanford) have
been admitted on the basis of academic re
cords that would probably have caused a
non-minority student to be rejected. Every
school reporting operates this way as a mat
ter of policy."
The use of such admission quotas is a
form of reverse discrimination.
Minority admission quotas are wrong for
one irrefutable reason: discrimination can
only be against individuals, not against
groups. Likewise, individuals discriminate
against individuals, not groups against
groups.
Injustices can be redressed only for those
individuals who have suffered them. Giving
preferential treatment to members of a
minority group to countervail discrimina
tion against others of the same minority is
clearly unjust.
For such an advantage fails to rectify the
wrong suffered by the first person,while
giving gratuitous help to the second.
Standard of fairness
One must remember that the right trans
gressed by discrimination is not one's
rights as a member of a group, but rather the

right to be judged by a common standard of
merit. Any unfairness is caused by depart
ing from this uniform standard.
Rather than amending past transgres
sions, quotas merely change the target of
such discrimination from a minority group
to those outisde that group—clearly a case
of reverse discrimination.
All presently feasible quota systems give
preferential treatment to a few highly visi
ble minorities. This policy ignores the
myriad of minority groups in the world
today, many of whom could claim past dis
crimination.
Why is it just to reduce the number of
Moroccan midgets admitted in order to
admit more chicanos? Or why should one
admit fewer Jewish cowboys in favor of
women?
Infinite number
Unless an almost infinite number of
minority groups were given special quotas,
a quota system would be inherently biased.
One must also question whether quota
systems ignore inherent differences among
peoples. For example, because of the oppor
tunity for most women to be homemakers in
exchange for financial support (an option
unavailable to most men),it is probable that
a smaller number of women would decide
to enter advanced University programs?
A quota to correct this imbalance of men
would not 3olve the problem, for it ignores
the free will of women.
Yet another problem with quotas is the
suspicions some may harbor that a minority
student was admitted on the basis of less

stringent qualifications than applied to
other students.
Thomas Sowell, a black economics pro
fessor at UCLA, questions "what good is
going to come from lower standards that
will make 'black' equivalent to 'substan
dard' in the eyes of black and white students
alike? Can you imagine that this is going to
reduce racism?" (The Balancing Act,
George Roche III).
Compare performances
Nor is it valid to point to those minority
students admitted under special auspices
who have done well. To be a fair compari
son, one would have to examine how well
those better qualified students denied ad
mission would have performed.
The object of any admissions policy
should be to admit students of potential and
diversity, regardless of whether conditions
outside the students' control have militated
against their receiving a good education.
Thus, a fair admissions policy should take
into account inferior educational oppor
tunities and cultural disadvantages (and
hence, a lower level of performance on tests)
for all individuals, rather than merely giv
ing preferential treatment to students of any
one race or sex.
After all, is it fair to admit the son of a
wealthy black doctor by the lower standards
used to judge other blacks? Or should
Appalachian whites be considered on an
equal basis with all other whites?
Admitting on the basis of minority status
students with only slightly weaker
academic records than the majority is also
justified to some extent, as a University
should make an effort to bring diversity to
its student body. It should take into ac
count minority status just as it considers
geographical regions and special skills.
However, setting significantly less rigor
ous admissions standards for minority
groups is clearly reverse discrimination.

Minority admissions and financial aid are
issues which have been widely discussed in
recent years.
After extensive debate, standards for ap
portioning financial aid at Stanford were
revised somewhat last year. However,
minority admissions policies, here and at
other U.S. universities, still need to be reex
amined.
To avoid confusion, a definition of
"quota" is needed. I am using this word as
"an arbitrary exemption from standard pol
icy."
Also keep in mind that "minorities" is
being used here in a very strict sense. The
word refers to people who are in a minority
because of any factor (e.g. height, race, sex,
age or language, to name just a few.)
Different basis
According to a report of University Af
firmative Action officer Robert Rosenzweig
"they (minority students of Stanford) have
been admitted on the basis of academic re
cords that would probably have caused a
non-minority student to be rejected. Every
school reporting operates this way as a mat
ter of policy."
The use of such admission quotas is a
form of reverse discrimination.
Minority admission quotas are wrong for
one irrefutable reason: discrimination can
only be against individuals, not against
groups. Likewise, individuals discriminate
against individuals, not groups against
groups.
Injustices can be redressed only for those
individuals who have suffered them. Giving
preferential treatment to members of a
minority group to countervail discrimina
tion against others of the same minority is
clearly unjust.
For such an advantage fails to rectify the
wrong suffered by the first person,while
giving gratuitous help to the second.
Standard of fairness
One must remember that the right trans
gressed by discrimination is not one's
rights as a member of a group, but rather the

right to be judged by a common standard of
merit. Any unfairness is caused by depart
ing from this uniform standard.
Rather than amending past transgres
sions, quotas merely change the target of
such discrimination from a minority group
to those outisde that group—clearly a case
of reverse discrimination.
All presently feasible quota systems give
preferential treatment to a few highly visi
ble minorities. This policy ignores the
myriad of minority groups in the world
today, many of whom could claim past dis
crimination.
Why is it just to reduce the number of
Moroccan midgets admitted in order to
admit more chicanos? Or why should one
admit fewer Jewish cowboys in favor of
women?
Infinite number
Unless an almost infinite number of
minority groups were given special quotas,
a quota system would be inherently biased.
One must also question whether quota
systems ignore inherent differences among
peoples. For example, because of the oppor
tunity for most women to be homemakers in
exchange for financial support (an option
unavailable to most men),it is probable that
a smaller number of women would decide
to enter advanced University programs?
A quota to correct this imbalance of men
would not 3olve the problem, for it ignores
the free will of women.
Yet another problem with quotas is the
suspicions some may harbor that a minority
student was admitted on the basis of less

stringent qualifications than applied to
other students.

wrong suffered by the first person,while
giving gratuitous help to the second.
Standard of fairness
One must remember that the right trans
gressed by discrimination is not one's
rights as a member of a group, but rather the

right to be judged by a common standard of
merit. Any unfairness is caused by depart
ing from this uniform standard.
Rather than amending past transgres
sions, quotas merely change the target of
such discrimination from a minority group
to those outisde that group—clearly a case
of reverse discrimination.
All presently feasible quota systems give
preferential treatment to a few highly visi
ble minorities. This policy ignores the
myriad of minority groups in the world
today, many of whom could claim past dis
crimination.
Why is it just to reduce the number of
Moroccan midgets admitted in order to
admit more chicanos? Or why should one
admit fewer Jewish cowboys in favor of
women?
Infinite number
Unless an almost infinite number of
minority groups were given special quotas,
a quota system would be inherently biased.
One must also question whether quota
systems ignore inherent differences among
peoples. For example, because of the oppor
tunity for most women to be homemakers in
exchange for financial support (an option
unavailable to most men),it is probable that
a smaller number of women would decide
to enter advanced University programs?
A quota to correct this imbalance of men
would not 3olve the problem, for it ignores
the free will of women.
Yet another problem with quotas is the
suspicions some may harbor that a minority
student was admitted on the basis of less

stringent qualifications than applied to
other students.
Thomas Sowell, a black economics pro
fessor at UCLA, questions "what good is
going to come from lower standards that
will make 'black' equivalent to 'substan
dard' in the eyes of black and white students
alike? Can you imagine that this is going to
reduce racism?" (The Balancing Act,
George Roche III).
Compare performances
Nor is it valid to point to those minority
students admitted under special auspices
who have done well. To be a fair compari
son, one would have to examine how well
those better qualified students denied ad
mission would have performed.
The object of any admissions policy
should be to admit students of potential and
diversity, regardless of whether conditions
outside the students' control have militated
against their receiving a good education.
Thus, a fair admissions policy should take
into account inferior educational oppor
tunities and cultural disadvantages (and
hence, a lower level of performance on tests)
for all individuals, rather than merely giv
ing preferential treatment to students of any
one race or sex.
After all, is it fair to admit the son of a
wealthy black doctor by the lower standards
used to judge other blacks? Or should
Appalachian whites be considered on an
equal basis with all other whites?
Admitting on the basis of minority status
students with only slightly weaker
academic records than the majority is also
justified to some extent, as a University
should make an effort to bring diversity to
its student body. It should take into ac
count minority status just as it considers
geographical regions and special skills.
However, setting significantly less rigor
ous admissions standards for minority
groups is clearly reverse discrimination.

Minority admissions and financial aid are
issues which have been widely discussed in
recent years.
After extensive debate, standards for ap
portioning financial aid at Stanford were
revised somewhat last year. However,
minority admissions policies, here and at
other U.S. universities, still need to be reex
amined.
To avoid confusion, a definition of
"quota" is needed. I am using this word as
"an arbitrary exemption from standard pol
icy."
Also keep in mind that "minorities" is
being used here in a very strict sense. The
word refers to people who are in a minority
because of any factor (e.g. height, race, sex,
age or language, to name just a few.)
Different basis
According to a report of University Af
firmative Action officer Robert Rosenzweig
"they (minority students of Stanford) have
been admitted on the basis of academic re
cords that would probably have caused a
non-minority student to be rejected. Every
school reporting operates this way as a mat
ter of policy."
The use of such admission quotas is a
form of reverse discrimination.
Minority admission quotas are wrong for
one irrefutable reason: discrimination can
only be against individuals, not against
groups. Likewise, individuals discriminate
against individuals, not groups against
groups.
Injustices can be redressed only for those
individuals who have suffered them. Giving
preferential treatment to members of a
minority group to countervail discrimina
tion against others of the same minority is
clearly unjust.
For such an advantage fails to rectify the
wrong suffered by the first person,while
giving gratuitous help to the second.
