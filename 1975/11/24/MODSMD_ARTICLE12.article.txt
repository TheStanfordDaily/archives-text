# Zionism encourages racist acts
## 
### 
First of two parts
In today's world, we are
watching a revival of classical
anti-semitism and the birth of
another form of racism: anti-
Arabism.
Anti-semitism has been im
planted in the Moslem world as a
consequence of the creation of
the state of Israel. This is a fact
which is especially worth point
ing out because, historically,
Islam has always been more
open toward the Jews than the
Christian world and has never
adopted the pogroms and in
quisition characteristic of the
West.
The growth of anti-semitism
in the Moslem world can be at
tributed to the confusion created
by Zionists regarding anti-
Zionism as anti-semitism.
Since according to Zionist
doctrine, all the Jews of the
world are children of Israel, any
hostility shown towards this
state time, a manifestation of
anti-semitism, some persons
argue.
This schematisation is absurd,
willful and dangerous. It not
only aims at paralyzing anti-
Zionists by making them out to
be anti-semites but, above all, it
breeds anti-semitism.
Anti-semitism is necessary for
the survival of Zionism, and this
confusion can only feed and en
courage it.
For* some time now, another
branch of semites has become

the target of racial discrimina
tion.
Two million Palestinian Arab
refugees — wasting their lives in
huddled camps on United Na
tions reslief of around 10 cents
per day — are pitiful spectacles
of this discrimination. These
people, who were once inde
pendent, self-supporting and
prosperous, have been made
beggers by being dispossessed of
their life-time homes and pos
sessions.
They have been hopelessly
forsaken in primitive and iso
lated camps, scattered around
the periphery of their traditional
land and forbidden to return.
Burden of guilt
Morris Stein and Abraham
Zichrony of Third Force move
ment in Israel wrote in 1961 in
connection with the trial of
Adolf Eichmann: "With deep
sorrow and shame we ask: does
Israel, which for 13 years has
been imposing exile and misery
on hundreds-of-thousands of
men, women and children,
whose only guilt is that they are
Arabs: which has deprived her
inhabitants of elementary
human rights, confiscated most
of their lands and forces them to
beg for a permit for every move
in the country, have the moral
right to sit in judgement?
Do they not approve, not
tacitly but quite loudly the in
human actions of their govern
ment? Are there many Jewish
houses in Israel that do not har

bor Arab property? Do not the
Kibbutzim build "socialism" on
robbed Arab land?"
Anti-racism
Faced with both anti-semitism
and anti-Arabism, an anti-racist
solution forthePalestinian prob
lem has real meaning only if it is
based on fundamental post
ulates.
To begin with, anti-racism
must proceed from an absolute
refusal of all forms of discrimi
nation. There is no justification
for discrimination: neither re
ligious belief, nor suffering, and
even less so torture, genocide.
Those who have been victims
of discrimination are all the
more to be condemned when the
roles are reversed.
The late historian Arnold
Toynbee wrote: "If the heinous
ness of sin is to be measured by
the degree to which the sinner is
sinning against the light that
God has vouchsafed to him, the
Jews had even less excuse in
1948 for evicting Palestinian
Arabs from their homes than
Nebuchadnezzar and Titus and
Hadrian and the Spanish and
Portuguese inquisitions had had
for uprooting, persecuting and
exterminating Jews in Palestine
and elsewhere.
"In 1948 the Jews knew, from
personal experience, what they
were doing: and it was their sup
reme tragedy that the lessons
learned by them from their en
counter with the Nazi Gentiles
should have been not to eschew

Syed Mohammed Tariq

but to imitate some of the evil
deeds that the Nazis had com
mitted against the Jews."
(Syed Mohammad Tariq is a
graduate student in petroleum
engineering.)
