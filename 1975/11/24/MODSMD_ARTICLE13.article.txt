Bad sportsmanship
Editor:
A Saturday afternoon of good
clean ail-American football. Ma!
More likely a grudge match bet
ween two local third grade clas
ses. Every year the Stanford-Cal
game deteriorates into the most
vicious display of unsportsman
like conduct.
This year it happened to upset
me more than most because I was
a victim. ,
At the end of half time 1 was
pelted in the chest by an orange
that was thrown extremely hard
— which split on impact. It suc
ceeded — in greatly hurting me
and covering my camera equip
ment with orange drippings.
The sense of injustice and out
rage was great — because 1 felt 1
had done nothing to deserve
this. And later when I found out
the orange had been thrown by a
Stanford Bandsman, it was
even greater.
Imagine getting "hit" by one's
own side. 1 guess 1 was lucky it
was the chest — had it been a
foot higher it would have been a
broken nose or a severely dam
aged eye.
When will people grow up?
And when will the security at
the games improve? Its a sad
statement on college football
when one is not safe on the fild.

In response to the article sub
mitted by "Princess" Pale Moon.
I would first like to point out that
she is not a Stanford Native
American student nor an
alumna. I find it difficult to be
lieve that she strongly identifies
with the problems of being an
Indian at a school where one is
associated with the school mas
cot.
The Native Americans here do
not do not want to be Stanford's
Indians.
The battles we have fought
here and outside of this school
do not reflect the same battles
which Stanford athletics must
fight. Our concern is the preser
vation of self-identity and relig
ion.
My Indian pride comes from
being an Indian, and not from
having my"lndianess"bestowed
upon me by non-Indians. Pale
moon reinforces the Hollywood
stereotype, which is not rep
resentative of the realty of Native
Americans today at Stanford or
elswhere.
I, for one, am tired of seeing
people like Pale Moon
(Rity Tillman) and Prince Light
foot (Tim Williams) exploit and
capitalize on Native American
heritage. It seems they enjoy the
spotlight.

I hear quite a few of the chil
dren down there are trying to
reinstate the Indian mascot. I
don't know whether to laugh or
cry.
•
I was so proud of us when we
had the intelligence and the
open-mindedness to change it in
response to thearticulateand pa
tient pleas of the Native Ameri
can students.
I shall be very ashamed of my
school if the move to reinstate
the Indian mascot is successful.

ment with orange drippings.
The sense of injustice and out
rage was great — because 1 felt 1
had done nothing to deserve
this. And later when I found out
the orange had been thrown by a
Stanford Bandsman, it was
even greater.
Imagine getting "hit" by one's
own side. 1 guess 1 was lucky it
was the chest — had it been a
foot higher it would have been a
broken nose or a severely dam
aged eye.
When will people grow up?
And when will the security at
the games improve? Its a sad
statement on college football
when one is not safe on the fild.

In response to the article sub
mitted by "Princess" Pale Moon.
I would first like to point out that
she is not a Stanford Native
American student nor an
alumna. I find it difficult to be
lieve that she strongly identifies
with the problems of being an
Indian at a school where one is
associated with the school mas
cot.
The Native Americans here do
not do not want to be Stanford's
Indians.
The battles we have fought
here and outside of this school
do not reflect the same battles
which Stanford athletics must
fight. Our concern is the preser
vation of self-identity and relig
ion.
My Indian pride comes from
being an Indian, and not from
having my"lndianess"bestowed
upon me by non-Indians. Pale
moon reinforces the Hollywood
stereotype, which is not rep
resentative of the realty of Native
Americans today at Stanford or
elswhere.
I, for one, am tired of seeing
people like Pale Moon
(Rity Tillman) and Prince Light
foot (Tim Williams) exploit and
capitalize on Native American
heritage. It seems they enjoy the
spotlight.

I hear quite a few of the chil
dren down there are trying to
reinstate the Indian mascot. I
don't know whether to laugh or
cry.
•
I was so proud of us when we
had the intelligence and the
open-mindedness to change it in
response to thearticulateand pa
tient pleas of the Native Ameri
can students.
I shall be very ashamed of my
school if the move to reinstate
the Indian mascot is successful.

A Saturday afternoon of good
clean ail-American football. Ma!
More likely a grudge match bet
ween two local third grade clas
ses. Every year the Stanford-Cal
game deteriorates into the most
vicious display of unsportsman
like conduct.
This year it happened to upset
me more than most because I was
a victim. ,
At the end of half time 1 was
pelted in the chest by an orange
that was thrown extremely hard
— which split on impact. It suc
ceeded — in greatly hurting me
and covering my camera equip
ment with orange drippings.
