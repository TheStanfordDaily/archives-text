million a day more than it is has
been taking in since July 1. a re
port by state Controller Ken Cory
revealed last week.
Cory also reported that indi
vidual taxpayers are paying 21
percent more than last year in
personal income tax. while cor
porations are paying 21 percent
less.
Those are highlights of a re
port of income and spending for
the period of July 1 through Oct.
31.
California spent $547 million
more than it took in from re
venues in the first 122 days of the
1975-76 fiscal vear, Corv re

ported.
State officials said business
profits have been down due to
the recession, but that indi
vidual income tax receipts are
up — in part because cost-of
living raises boost taxpayers into
higher brackets.
Legislative Analyst A. Alan
Post said he expects the state to
recover during the final eight
months of the fiscal year and
wind up next June with a deficit
for the year of about $!15() mill
ion.
That would still leave a surp
lus of $453 million: Tradition
ally, revenues peak in thesecond
half of each fiscal vear.
