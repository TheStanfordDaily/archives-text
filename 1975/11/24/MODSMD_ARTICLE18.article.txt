## Cal waits, Cards wonder after Bears go wild 
### RON BECK 
Muncie. Muncie. Muncie. Muncie. Mun
cie.
California's sensational tailback Chuck
Muncie singlehandedly wilted any hopes
Stanford had of roses Saturday when he
took on the tasks of running, catching and
passing to lead the Bears to a humiliating
48-15 crushing of the Cardinals.
Muncie did everything but kick field
goals for Cal. He ran in three touchdowns,
caught a fourth and passed for a fifth, im
pressing 88,000 Stanford Stadium fans and
a potential score of Heisman Trophy voters.
The senior All-American-to-be rushed for
166 yards in the game (127 in the first half
alone), caught four Joe Roth passes and laid
up a beautiful toss to Wesley Walker that
went for 46 yards and a score.
"He'd help out our running game a bit,"
Stanford quarterback Guy Benjamin under
stated after the game.

And that's precisely what the Cards
would have needed to even come close to
keeping pace with the explosive Cal of
fense. The Bear offense racked up 488 yards
against the overpowered Card defense —
268 passing and 220 rushing. Meanwhile,
Stanford's combination of runners ground
out a total of 67 yards on 23 carries, forcing
Benjamin to go to the air consistently.
Actually, with or without a running
game, the Cards would have been forced to
play catch-up ball for the entire game. After
only seven minutes of play, Cal scored and
was ahead to stay.
The Cards' first possession ended after
three consecutive Don Stevenson runs
failed to get a first down. Mike Michel,
punting for the first time in four weeks,
kicked the ball from out of the Stanford en
dzone to the Cards'own 32-yard line. Roth
lofted the ball to Chuck Muncie seven plays
later to lead off the scoring.

Another three-play Cardinal offensive
series followed by a punt, and again the
Bears took over with good field position.
Starting at midfield, Cal needed only eight
plays before Muncie's 16-yard ramble up
the middle pushed the score to 14-0.
Stanford hit right back, however, when
three consecutive Benjamin passes culmi
nated with a picture-perfect 38-yard touch
down strike to Tony Hill. But the extra point
attempt was blocked, and the eight-point
Stanford deficit was the smallest it would be
for the rest of the game.
A called-back Cal touchdown and a mis
sed field goal attempt gave the Cards pos
session with only 16 seconds left in the half.
Benjamin's bomb attempt on the first play
was intercepted and run back to the Stan
ford 21. Bear kicker Jim Breech again came
in, and, with eight seconds left, kicked a
field goal that left thefirst half scoreat 27-6.
