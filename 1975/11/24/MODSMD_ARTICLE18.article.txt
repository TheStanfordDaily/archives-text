## Cal waits, Cards wonder after Bears go wild 
### RON BECK 
Muncie. Muncie. Muncie. Muncie. Mun
cie.
California's sensational tailback Chuck
Muncie singlehandedly wilted any hopes
Stanford had of roses Saturday when he
took on the tasks of running, catching and
passing to lead the Bears to a humiliating
48-15 crushing of the Cardinals.
Muncie did everything but kick field
goals for Cal. He ran in three touchdowns,
caught a fourth and passed for a fifth, im
pressing 88,000 Stanford Stadium fans and
a potential score of Heisman Trophy voters.
The senior All-American-to-be rushed for
166 yards in the game (127 in the first half
alone), caught four Joe Roth passes and laid
up a beautiful toss to Wesley Walker that
went for 46 yards and a score.
"He'd help out our running game a bit,"
Stanford quarterback Guy Benjamin under
stated after the game.

And that's precisely what the Cards
would have needed to even come close to
keeping pace with the explosive Cal of
fense. The Bear offense racked up 488 yards
against the overpowered Card defense —
268 passing and 220 rushing. Meanwhile,
Stanford's combination of runners ground
out a total of 67 yards on 23 carries, forcing
Benjamin to go to the air consistently.
Actually, with or without a running
game, the Cards would have been forced to
play catch-up ball for the entire game. After
only seven minutes of play, Cal scored and
was ahead to stay.
The Cards' first possession ended after
three consecutive Don Stevenson runs
failed to get a first down. Mike Michel,
punting for the first time in four weeks,
kicked the ball from out of the Stanford en
dzone to the Cards'own 32-yard line. Roth
lofted the ball to Chuck Muncie seven plays
later to lead off the scoring.

Another three-play Cardinal offensive
series followed by a punt, and again the
Bears took over with good field position.
Starting at midfield, Cal needed only eight
plays before Muncie's 16-yard ramble up
the middle pushed the score to 14-0.
Stanford hit right back, however, when
three consecutive Benjamin passes culmi
nated with a picture-perfect 38-yard touch
down strike to Tony Hill. But the extra point
attempt was blocked, and the eight-point
Stanford deficit was the smallest it would be
for the rest of the game.
A called-back Cal touchdown and a mis
sed field goal attempt gave the Cards pos
session with only 16 seconds left in the half.
Benjamin's bomb attempt on the first play
was intercepted and run back to the Stan
ford 21. Bear kicker Jim Breech again came
in, and, with eight seconds left, kicked a
field goal that left thefirst half scoreat 27-6.

Tony Hill scoring on a 38-yard touchdown pass from Guy Benjamin.
No one scored in the third quarter, despite a first
and goal situation for the Cards on the Cal 4-yard
line. On first down, running back John Finley
bucked into the line for no gain. Benjamin bob
bled the ball on second down, and only had time
to spot running back Cary Lynn, a secondary re
ceiver on the play. Lynn went for only two yards
while two receivers waited uncovered in the end
zone.
A quarterback keeper and a Stevenson line
plunge on fourth down failed to move the ball past
the 1-yard line.
The Bears were no more successful, though,
and only gained two yards in three downs. On
fourth, down theCal center intentionally snapped
the ball out of the endzone for a safety.
Plan backfired
The plan to keep Stanford out of scoring range
backfired, however, when the Cards took the kic
koff and immediately completed six passes in
eight plays. Jim Jenke caught the last completion
in the endzone, and Stanford seemed to have the
momentum, despite the 27-15 score.
"The way we were moving the ball," Benjamin
recalled, "if.we hadn't been stopped at the goal,
we would've only been down by five and it would
have been a different game."
But Roth prevented Stanford from coming back
when he found Wesley Walker 46 yards down
field on the Card 9. Muncie again ran the ball in
for a score.
Cal kicker Steve Mashl then topped the ball on
the kickoff. Stanford took possession on its own

47-yard line but was stopped a few plays later
when another Benjamin pass was intercepted.
No run tough
"It's hard to pass when the defense knows you
have to pass," Benjamin explained. "We'd been
saying all week that we would have to run, but
they shut us off."
Adding insult to injury, Muncie capped the en
suing Cal drive by throwing a halfback option
pass directly into Walker's hands for yet another
score.
Cal scored once more on freshman Paul Jones'
6-yard run, making the final score 48-15.
The loss knocked the Cards out of the Rose Bowl
race, and gave them a 6-4-1 final season record.
Cal's 6-1 Pacific-Eight Conference record assures
them of at least a tie for first place in the final
league standings. If USC beats UCLAFriday night,
the Bears would be the undisputed league champ
ions and meet Ohio State in the Rose Bowl.
If UCLA wins, however, the Bruins would go to
the Rose Bowl. So the Bears have to wait until this
weekend before they can decide their New Year's
day plans.
Muncie, who also has the Heisman Trophy to
think about, is "just going to relax this week.
Maybe head up to the mountains."
Roth said that he will be taking a different ap
proach. "I'm going to be glued to the tube Friday
night," he laughed.
Cardinal Notes: Saturday's was the most lop
sided Big Came since Stanford won 41-0 in
1930 . . . Cal finished the season at 8-3, the Bears'
best record since 1952 when they went
8-2 . . . Tony Hill caught seven passes to bring his
season total to 55, third best in Stanford
history . . .
Cal receiver Steve Rivera's 57 catches this year
broke his own record by one . . . Muncie's four
touchdowns tied a Cal record set by Don Johnson
against Minnesota in 1952 . . . Roth's touchdown
pass gave him 14 for the season, equalling the Cal
record set by Craig Morton in 1963 . . .
Stanford's defense sacked Roth three times —
the most against Cal this year . . . Muncie's
46-yard touchdown pass to Walker improved his
season passing statistics to three completions in
three attempts for 143 yards . . .
Cal converted 14 of 18 third-down
situations . . . Cal didn't turn the ball over at all
while Stanford suffered two fumbles and four in
terceptions. Cal coach Mike White said after the
game, "We lead the Pac-8 by quite a margin in
fewest turnovers, which is kind of amazing when
you consider all the trash we throw into our
offense" . . .
This amount of "Cardinal Notes" matches the
Daily record and the length of the entire game
story exceeds by three paragraphs the previous
record, set in 1936 after a game against
Columbia . . .
