# Poloists lose, tie for Pac-8 crown
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
It all started back in mid-
September, and for the Cardinals
these last nine weeks of inten
sive work have resulted in a
Pacific-8 championship â€” at
least a third of it anyway.
The Stanford varsity water
polo team's 7-5 loss to defending
NCAA champion UC-Berkeley
Saturday coupled with UCLA's
win over USC has set up a
three-way first-place tie at 3-2
between Stanford, Cal and

UCLA. It marked the first time
since 1964 that the Cards
claimed the Pac-8 crown.
As opposed to last year's three,
only two teams will make the
trip to Long Beach for the NCAA
championships this year. Which
two is still up in the air. At press
time, no announcement had
been made even though there
were several rumors on the
method of selection. These
ranged from a playoff between
the three teams to a decision

based on goal differences.
With a win, the Cards would
not have had to worry about all
the alternatives of the three-way
tie since they would have
claimed sole possession of first
place. But Stanford was playing
a different Cal team than the one
it had beaten 11-7 in the NorCal
championships and then 12-8 up
at Berkeley. The Bears' attack
was strengthened with the re
turn of seniors John Svenson and
Paul Bogan and coach Pete
Cutino, who returned to action
from the Pan-American games in
Mexico City.
Third in row
The Cards' loss, and the Bears'
third straight league win after
starting off with a 0-2 Pac-8
mark, actually came in the third
quarter. At that time Stanford
was without startersDoug Burke,
who was lost from action in the
first quarter due to an eye injury,
and Paul Clark, whom coach Art
Lambert pulled from the lineup
in the middle of the second quar
ter when Clark picked up his
second major foul. (Three major
fouls by a player results in the
player's ejection from the game.)
"It was quite a blow to play
without two of our starters and
that affected our play," said
Lambert. This was aptly illus
trated as the Cards looked like
two entirely different teams in
the first and second halves.
Defensively, the only consis
tency that Stanford could muster
was in containing Cal when the
Bears had a man advantage in
the pool. The Cards only allowed
one score in the six times the
situation arose. Stanford, aided
by goalie Chris Dorst's five
blocked shots, kept Cal's offense
in check during the first half.
"I just told them to continue
what they are doing," said Lam
bert at halftime, but the Cards

could not keep it going as Cal
seemed to find more holes in the
Card net than Chuck Muncie
found in Stanford's defensive
line. The offense paralled the
defense's turnabout as the sec
ond half offensive attack of the
Cards was marred by poor pas
sing.
Halftime lead
The Cards came out of the
locker room with a 3-2 half-time
lead and "upset" written all over
their faces, but two Cal goals
turned the game around, giving
the Bears a 4-3 lead at the end of
the third quarter.
Cal's Svenson added another
tally (one of four that day) and all
the Cards could do in the last
few minutes was trade goals with
the Bears on scores by John Paul
Roberts and Marty Davis.
"We were definite underdogs,
but the thing that upset me was
that we gave the game to them,"
Lambert explained."We were
ahead a couple of times in the
first half but let them catch up
with us."
Last game
The game marked the final
home game for Stanford seniors
Roberts and Tom Elson. Lambert
called Roberts "a player that
makes things happen" when the
latter scored two of his three
goals within 45 seconds in the
second quarter.
The Cards will now have to
play a waiting game. Stanford
should be notified no later than
today of the committee's deci
sion of who will go to the
NCAAs.
"I hope that we go not only for
the team but for John (Roberts)
and Tom (Elson)," Lambert said.
"They are not only super players
but super guys. I'd like to see
them go out winners."
Last year the Card's finished
sixth in the NCAA playoffs.
