# U.S.-China relations shaky
## 
### JEFF EHRLICH 
Although he found it "surprising
that things have gone as well as they
have so far," Political Science Prof.
John Lewis said last week he fears
trouble ahead for newly-renewed
U.S.-China relations. But, Lewis said
in a lecture at Tresidder Union last
week, "there are many who don't share
this view."
Lewis, a Sinologist who has written
a number of books on China and vis
ited there several times, was a member
of the Congressional delegation which
visited the country last August.

According to Lewis, the Chinese
government is "raising questions"
about the stability of the U.S. govern
ment, while the U.S. is generally un
sure of what is happening in China and
of what direction the Chinese leader
ship will be taking in the future.
The Ford administration is in a
"waiting" position regarding relations
with China, said Lewis. It is apparently
uncertain of the attitudes held by new
personalities in the Chinese govern
ment. For example, the man who will
probably succeed Premier Chou En-lai
(who has terminal cancer), is much

less amenable to relations with the
U.S. than was Chou.
Block Soviets
Lewis made it clear that the main
interest in diplomatic relations for
both the U.S. and China is to block
Soviet power. He described the Soviet
Union as a common enemy, and he
quoted Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer as saying that the U.S. and
China "have no choice but to work to
gether" with regard to the U.S.S.R.
Lewis pointed out that the Chinese
government has "questioned" the
SALT talks with the U.S.S.R., as well
as U.S.-U.S.S.R. detente. The Chinese
were also suspicious about the recent
shake-up in the Ford Administration
Cabinet, especially the firing of De
fense Secretary James Schlesinger.
According to Lewis, the Chinese felt
that Schlesinger was one official who
dealt with the Soviets "realistically."
The Cabinet shake-up also promp
ted the Chinese to question why the
U.S. "presumed to settle our (China's)
border dispute" with the U.S.S.R. at
last year's summit conference at Hel
sinki, Lewis said.
A major indication of China's dis
pleasure with the U.S. is their cutbacks
in export purchases, said Lewis. The
annual Chinese purchase of cotton and
grain from the U.S. has been reduced
from $900 million worth in 1972 to a
current level of $300 million. But this
fact isn't of significant importance to
the U.S. government, Lewis said.
Bilateral business
Lewis quoted Secretary Kissinger as
saying that matters of trade exchange
— "bilateral business" — weren't as
important to relations as the "strategic
calculus" involved in planning
mutual blockage of Soviet power.
Lewis also reported that China's
worker's militia "has vastly increased
since 1972. and has gradually taken
over police duties — maintaining pub
lic order and public discipline" —
from the People's Liberation Army.
The militia trains two months out of
the year on such equipment as tanks
and mortars, and the training includes
use of grenades and other live ammun
ition. he said.
The Chinese are relying on the
militia to lessen the need for the U.S. to
bolster them against Soviet attack,
Lewis said. A large branch of the
militia forms a "ready reserve" against
military ground attack, while a larger
ratio of China's military budget has
been recently allocated for naval pro
curement, largely because of the
Soviet Union's conduct of naval exer
cises last spring.
Another reason for Chinese reluc
tance to have cultural exchange with
the U.S. is their fear that the values of
Chinese youth will be corrupted.
Lewis quoted the vice-mayor of Shan
ghai as saying that the Chinese youth
make up a major portion of the "dif
ficult to educate" segment of the popu
lation. The vice-mayor also indicated
that China's youth are "not revolutio
nary" and have been getting "petty
bourgeois" notions and adopting
Western values. This was blamed par
tially on sailors and tourists "who
carry cameras and radios."
Although he found it "surprising
that things have gone as well as they
have so far," Political Science Prof.

Cabinet, especially the firing of De
fense Secretary James Schlesinger.
According to Lewis, the Chinese felt
that Schlesinger was one official who
dealt with the Soviets "realistically."
The Cabinet shake-up also promp
ted the Chinese to question why the
U.S. "presumed to settle our (China's)
border dispute" with the U.S.S.R. at
last year's summit conference at Hel
sinki, Lewis said.
A major indication of China's dis
pleasure with the U.S. is their cutbacks
in export purchases, said Lewis. The
annual Chinese purchase of cotton and
grain from the U.S. has been reduced
from $900 million worth in 1972 to a
current level of $300 million. But this
fact isn't of significant importance to
the U.S. government, Lewis said.
Bilateral business
Lewis quoted Secretary Kissinger as
saying that matters of trade exchange
— "bilateral business" — weren't as
important to relations as the "strategic
calculus" involved in planning
mutual blockage of Soviet power.
Lewis also reported that China's
worker's militia "has vastly increased
since 1972. and has gradually taken
over police duties — maintaining pub
lic order and public discipline" —
from the People's Liberation Army.
The militia trains two months out of
the year on such equipment as tanks
and mortars, and the training includes
use of grenades and other live ammun
ition. he said.
The Chinese are relying on the
militia to lessen the need for the U.S. to
bolster them against Soviet attack,
Lewis said. A large branch of the
militia forms a "ready reserve" against
military ground attack, while a larger
ratio of China's military budget has
been recently allocated for naval pro
curement, largely because of the
Soviet Union's conduct of naval exer
cises last spring.
Another reason for Chinese reluc
tance to have cultural exchange with
the U.S. is their fear that the values of
Chinese youth will be corrupted.
Lewis quoted the vice-mayor of Shan
ghai as saying that the Chinese youth
make up a major portion of the "dif
ficult to educate" segment of the popu
lation. The vice-mayor also indicated
that China's youth are "not revolutio
nary" and have been getting "petty
bourgeois" notions and adopting
Western values. This was blamed par
tially on sailors and tourists "who
carry cameras and radios."
Although he found it "surprising
that things have gone as well as they
have so far," Political Science Prof.
John Lewis said last week he fears
trouble ahead for newly-renewed
U.S.-China relations. But, Lewis said
in a lecture at Tresidder Union last
week, "there are many who don't share
this view."
Lewis, a Sinologist who has written
a number of books on China and vis
ited there several times, was a member
of the Congressional delegation which
visited the country last August.

According to Lewis, the Chinese
government is "raising questions"
about the stability of the U.S. govern
ment, while the U.S. is generally un
sure of what is happening in China and
of what direction the Chinese leader
ship will be taking in the future.
The Ford administration is in a
"waiting" position regarding relations
with China, said Lewis. It is apparently
uncertain of the attitudes held by new
personalities in the Chinese govern
ment. For example, the man who will
probably succeed Premier Chou En-lai
(who has terminal cancer), is much

less amenable to relations with the
U.S. than was Chou.
Block Soviets
Lewis made it clear that the main
interest in diplomatic relations for
both the U.S. and China is to block
Soviet power. He described the Soviet
Union as a common enemy, and he
quoted Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer as saying that the U.S. and
China "have no choice but to work to
gether" with regard to the U.S.S.R.
Lewis pointed out that the Chinese
government has "questioned" the
SALT talks with the U.S.S.R., as well
as U.S.-U.S.S.R. detente. The Chinese
were also suspicious about the recent
shake-up in the Ford Administration
Cabinet, especially the firing of De

Another reason for Chinese reluc
tance to have cultural exchange with
the U.S. is their fear that the values of
Chinese youth will be corrupted.
Lewis quoted the vice-mayor of Shan
ghai as saying that the Chinese youth
make up a major portion of the "dif
ficult to educate" segment of the popu
lation. The vice-mayor also indicated
that China's youth are "not revolutio
nary" and have been getting "petty
bourgeois" notions and adopting
Western values. This was blamed par
tially on sailors and tourists "who
carry cameras and radios."
