# Card wrestlers open season at SJ State
## 
### MARK FUNK 
Boasting five Pacific Eight
veterans and an impressive
group of freshman recruits, the
Stanford wrestling team opens
its season tonight at San Jose
State.
Head coach Joe DeMeo, re
turning to the helm after a sum
mer with the U.S. National Team
at the Minsk, U.S.S.R. World
Wrestling Championships, said
his team was coming along well
for the opening match and ex
pected them to give San Jose
State — a team which has been a
■Bay Area power the past few
years — a run for its money.
"We have some fine individu
als returning," DeMeo said.
"And a number of freshmen
should help us, too." DeMeo
said that this was probably the
best freshman group he has ever
recruited here.
The freshmen will join return
ing lettermen Lester Yoshida,
Craig Reynolds, Roy Tolles and
John Govea at San Jose State to
morrow night. \
DeMeo said he expects

Reynolds and Govea, who
finished third in the Pac-8 tour
nament last year and earned a
trip to the NCAA champion
ships, to lead the team this year.
Reynolds, who will compete
at 167, has matured after barely
missing placing in the Pac-8s
last year, according to DeMeo.
"He's looking really strong in
practice," DeMeo said.
Top freshmen include
118-pounder Mike King, Eric
Sommers at 142 and
190-pounder Jim Gebers. The
top recruit may very well be at
142, however, where Jim Spang
ler, an All-California high school
wrestler, is battling returning
letterman Mark Yancey for the
starting position. "This Spang
ler is good," DeMeo said. "He'll
have to fill some big shoes,
though." Spangler will be taking
over for graduated Ken Krebs,
who won a trip to the NCAA
tournament last year.
The Cards will open at home a
week from Tuesday against
Stanislaus State at Encina Gym.
