# Rose Bowl roundup
## More roses for Ohio St. 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Call up the Pasadena Tourna
ment of Roses Association and
ask them to take down that
stupid sign over the Rose Bowl.
Re-name the Rose Bowl the Ohio
State Bowl.
The Buckeyes will make it
four Pasadena trips in a row after
beating Michigan, 21-14, Satur
day before a record crowd of
105,543 in Michigan Stadium.
The Wolverines did almost
everything needed to win. They
held Ohio State tailback Archie
Griffin to a meager 46 yards, end
ing his streak of 31 straight
100-yard performances.
Defense folds
But when it really mattered,
the Michigan defense couldn't
stop Buckeye quarterback Cor
nelius Greene. Ohio State had
played conservatively through
out the first three quarters and

the stats showed it. Michigan
outgained Ohio State 361 yards
to 208 in total offense.
Behind 14-7 in the fourth
quarter, lovable Buckeye coach
Woody Hayes, who may retire at
the end of this season if he wins
the national championship, al
lowed Greene to pass.
On a third-and-ten situation at
his own 20, Greene fired a
17-yard pass to wingback Brian
Baschnagel. With the most im
portant OSU drive of the year
saved, Greene marched the Buc
keyes 80 yards in 11 plays. Full
back Pete Johnson's three-yard
run knotted the score at 14-14
with 3:18 left in the game.
Wolves to Florida
Michigan coach Bo Schem
bechler knew that a tie would
only send his Wolverines to
Florida for New Year's, so he de
cided to gamble. On first down,
Michigan quarterback Rick
Leach was sacked for a nine-yard
loss and then came the play that
sealed the Wolverines' appear
ance in the Orange Bowl.
Leach fired a pass into the
hands of Ohio State safety Ray
Griffin, who was defending the
family honor by making up for
brother Archie's bad day and he
returned the ball 29 yards to the
Michigan three.
From there Johnson scored his
second touchdown in 61 sec
onds to put Ohio State in the
Rose Bowl again.
So Schembechler's dream of
playing in another bowl besides
the Rose Bowl, will come true
this Jan. 1, when the Wolverines
meet Oklahoma in the Orange
Bowl. Hayes will make the trip to
Pasadena to face either UCLA or
California.
UCLA needs win
UCLA needs to beat USC on
Friday evening in Los Angeles to
set up the rematch with the
Bucks. The Bruins lost a 40-21
game to Ohio State in October.

California better hope USC
wins. Nebraska re-polled its
players after losing to Oklahoma
35-10 Saturday, and decided to
accept a Fiesta Bowl invitation.
So unless USC beats UCLA, Cal
may go nowhere.
The Northwest Nothings,"
who are going nowhere, had
their own civil wars this
weekend, and about the only
good things that happened were
the sellout crowds.
Dogs' comeback
Washington came back to beat
hapless Washington State 28-27,
in a contest which may have
been Cougar coach Jim
Sweeney's last. The Cougars had
a 27-14 lead and were threaten
ing to score again when
Washington safety A 1 Burleson
picked off a WSU pass and
sprinted 93 yards for a touch
down.
After forcing the Cougars to
punt on the next series, quarter
back Chris Rowland hit Robert
Gaines on a 78-yard pass to give
the Huskies the 28-27 win.
Oregon beat Oregon State
14-7, before the largest Duck
crowd of the season. George
Bennett, who ran for 129 yards
on 34 carries, scored the win
ning touchdown on a 3-yard run
early in the third quarter.
