# Cards praise Muncie
## Cal Rose Bowl caliber-Chris 
### DAVE SMITH 
Before Saturday's Big Came,
Stanford's football players and
coaches maintained that there
was nothing left to say. But after
they had watched California pile
up the largest score in Big Came
history, there seemed even less
that the Cardinals needed to say.
"It was their day," said coach
Jack Christiansen to a small
group of reporters. "I think
they're definitely a Rose Bowl
team." And the Card players
couldn't help but agree, shower
ing praise on the Bears and run
ning back Chuck Muncie.
"Muncie's unbelievable," said
flanker Tony Hill, repeating a
common sentiment. "He's the
best back I've ever seen." Stan
ford linebackers Geb Church,

Dan Francis and Kay Cardinalli
put it a little differently, but not
much.
"He's by far the toughest back
I've ever tackled," said Car
dinalli. And since there were no
"crucial" plays to analyze and
no games to look forward to this
season, some of the Cards trans
ferred their pre-game Hose Bowl
hopes to the Bears.
Pappas impressed
"They have an outstanding
football team," said tight end
Ted Pappas. "I hope they go to
the Rose Bowl." Reserve quarter
back Jerry Waldvogel added,
"They're the only team that has a
chance to beat Ohio State."
In front of the Cal dressing
room, a group of Bear Backers
singing and mugging for TV

cameramen with the Axe, the
Big Game trophy, made more
noise than coach Mike White
and the Cal players. And for Cal
players, the joy of beating Stan
ford and of clinching the Bears'
first Pacific Kight championship
in over a decade was tempered
by the knowledge that they'd
have to wait a week to find out
whether the Bears will go to the
Rose Bowl.
"I'll probably go down to L.A.
and cheer for USC," said Chuck
Muncie every time he was asked
how he would spend next Fri
day. If the Trojans upset UCLA
the Bears will spend New Year's
in Pasadena. If not, Muncie,
wide receiver Steve Rivera, and
the rest of the Cal seniors have
played their last college game.
Rooting for SC
"I'm going to cheer harder
than I've ever rooted in my life,"
said White. "I'd hate to have our
season end here." Backup quar
terback Fred Besana concurred.
"A Rose Bowl ring would look
awfully good there," he said,
pointing to the appropriate
finger. "Of course 1 think SC will

beat UCLA. Everybody's been
saying we're a team of destiny."
Muncie and quarterback Joe
Roth each attracted a huge
crowd of newsmen, who tripped
over each other to ask Muncie
about his Heisman Trophy
hopes, and to ask Roth about
Muncie.
"It'd be a shame if he didn't get
it," said Roth. "He's the best I've
ever played with, for oragainst."
And White continued his
season-long campaign for Mun
cie: "If there's a better college
player in the country . . ■ well,
there can't be, Chuck has done it
all."
Both Roth and White credited
Stanford's blitzing pass rush.
"They wereknocking Joearound
like a billiard ball out there,"
said White.
And though the day seemed
about as gloomy as possible for
the Cards, one Stanford player
impressed White greatly. "Guy
Benjamin is an excellent, excel
lent passer," said White. "Any
time you can do what he did
against a defense that's looking
for a pass every play, you've got
exceptional ability."

AN UNUSUAL SIGHT—CaI running back Chuck Muncie is
brought to earth by Cardinal defensive backs Larry Reynolds (22)
and Rich Waters (43) after skirting end for a sizeable gain. Often as
not Saturday, Stanford defenders were forced to try and stop the
Heisman Trophy candidate about ten yards beyond the line of
scrimmage. Balloting for the Heisman Trophy ended at midnight
last night, and Muncie should be in the top three when the results
are announced.
