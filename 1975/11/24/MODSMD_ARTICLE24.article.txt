Voting questioned in SF
SAN FRANCISCO—The results of elections de
ciding the fates of ballot propositions worth mill
ions of dollars to San Francisco taxpayers have
been called into question because sufficient num
bers of votes have been found to be potentially
fraudulent.
The San Francisco Examiner in a copyrighted
story yesterday quoted California Secretary of State
March Fong Eu as saying she would move for an
independent audit of San Francisco voter rolls if
"local officials are indifferent or reluctant to act."
The story said fraudulent votes apparently had
been cast by city employes.
The newspaper said its reporters conducted a
detailed inspection of the official records of 10,000
city employes, an investigation that "brought into
serious question whether two ballot propositions
costing taxpayes an added 59 cents per $100 asses
sed valuation on the tax rate were legally ap
proved."
Of the 10,000 employes and pensioners checked,
the paper said 3900 had out-of-town addresses, that
946 of these voted in San Francisco in 1974 and in
many cases in earlier elections.
The paper questioned the passage of Prop. E on
the Nov. 1973 ballot which gave a 20 percent in
crease in pension benefits to city workers. This cost
taxpayers $7.6 million a year and passed by a slim
1308 vote margin.
The other matter questioned was Prop. M on the
Nov. 1974 ballot which increased police and fire
pension benefits by $7.7 million a year. This passed
by 3060 votes.
Lebanon truce dissolves
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon's infant cease-fire
collapsed in bloodshed yesterday, leaving at least
29 persons dead and 85 wounded in Beirut alone.
Fighting also was reported in the northern city of
Tripoli and the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, but
there was no immediate word on casualties. A
police radio call from Baalbek, 40 miles northeast of
Beirut, said 500 Moslem militiamen were attacking
the town hall.
Lebanese premier Rashid Karami announced the
truce Saturday night — the 13th in eight months of
civil war. But one discouraged policeman said:
"The cease-fire never even got off the ground."
Lebanon's outgunned and outnumbered security
forces have given up all pretense of trying to inter
vene between warring Christian and Moslem street
gangs. Tanks and armored personel carriers con
fined their presence to Beirut's shrinking safe'zone,
pulling back whenever gunfire sounded too close.
The 18,000-man army has not been committed
since the civil war began last April, because Karami
and the nation's Christian president, Suleiman
Franjieh, both fear that the army might split into
Christian and Moslem factions.
The spreading street war underlined the
hopelessness of a French mediation mission by
former French Premier Maurice Couve de Murville.
Lebanese politicians had to travel by armored car to
confer with him at the French Embassy, near one
sniper zone in the center of Beirut.
Saturday mail to stop?
WASHINGTON — The Postal Service may con
sider stopping Saturday mail deliveries if other

economy moves are not sufficient to cut millions of
dollars in losses, a spokesman said last night.
Hequoted Postmaster General Benjamin F. Bailar
as saying that is something "that might have to be
considered if we can't turn it around with other
economy measures."
Another measure that might be considered, he
said, is the curtailment of special delivery.
Bailer said last week the Postal Service is speed
ing up its process of closing rural post offices to
save money.
NY relief efforts continue
ALBANY, N.Y. — With Gov. Hugh Carey's $200
million plan to avert a default by New York City
next month in serious jeopardy, the New York
Legislature resumes efforts today to enact a city tax
increase that might put the proposal back together.
But as negotiations on the tax package continued
yesterday, there was no evidence of a breakthrough
in the partisan deadlock that blocked legislative
approval of the taxes Saturday night.
President Ford said last Wednesday he would
decide early this week whether the state and city
had taken enough "further steps toward fiscal re
sponsibility" to justify a reconsideration of federal
aid to help the city avoid default.
Five of the nation's Republican governors said
yesterday at the Republican Governors Association
conference in Wichita, Kansas that they oppose a
federal bailout of New York City, at least until the
city has made stringent efforts to solve its financial
problems.
Rightists mourn Franco
VALLEY OF THE FALLEN, Spain — Gen. Fran
cisco Franco was buried yesterday in a vast under
ground basilica cut into the side ofa granitemoun
tain as legions of civil war veterans and young
rightists gave the Fascist salute and thundered,
"Long Live Franco!"
Wearing the blue shirts of the Falange, more than
100,000 rightists massed at this monument to those
who died in the 1936-39 civil war.
A single cry of "Long Live the King!" was heard
amid the shouts of "Long Live Franco!" But no
voice was raised against the 37-year-old King Juan
Carlos I, Franco's chosen heir, whose installation
Saturday returned Spain to a monarchy after 44
years. He is expected to try to guide the nation away
from the authoritarian style of Franco, who died
Thursday.
UFW ends Capitol sit-in
SACRAMENTO — A group of United Farm
Worker demonstrators, after starting a sit-in at Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr.'s office Thursday afternoon,
marched out early yesterday with no explanation.
The demonstrators were protesting against the
firings of union members by growers.
The demonstrators say that California growers
fird 1165 farm workers for union activity in Sep
tember and October, the first two months that the
slate's new farm labor election law was in effect.
They also demanded theremoval of Walter Kintz,
general counsel of the state Agricultural Labor Re
lations Board.
Brown told the demonstrators he couldn't legally
solve their problems.

Fire burns L.A. forest
LOS ANGELES — A rampaging fire in the
Angeles National Forest erupted into a 9,000-acre
inferno that damaged or destroyed at least two
dozen buildings yesterday.
Inspector Connie Melton of the Los Angeles City
Fire Department said eyewitnesses told firemen the
buildings were located in the La Paloma Flats area
above Tujunga.
Winds in the lower canyons were gusting to 25 or
30 miles an hour, but the fire was being fanned by
gusts of 50 miles an hour along the tops of ridges.
The National Weather Service said the winds
would continue through the night, spreading
southward in the morning.
JFK, Ike aware of CIA plots?
WASHINGTON, D.C. — David W. Belin, former
executive director of the CIA Commission Investig
ation headed by Vice President Nelson A. Rockefel
ler said yesterday he believes that both Presidents
Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy were
aware of assassination plots on foreign leaders,
especially Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
Belin said on the CBS-TV "Face the Nation"
program that because the then-head of the CIA,
Allen W. Dulles, was the brother of then-Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles during the Eisenhower
years, and because Robert F. Kennedy was the at
torney general during his brother's administration,
he "assumed" the presidents were aware of the
plots.
He added that the 347-page report issued Thurs
day by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
appeared to be "a thorough job," but he felt it went
"easy" on past presidents and their knowledge of
assassination plots.
Fromme to decide defense
SACRAMENTO — Her loyalty to Charles Man
son weighed against the possibility of a life term in
prison, Lynette Fromme decides today whether to
testify in her own defense against charges of trying
to kill President Ford.
Fromme's lawyer says the 27-year-old defendant
has refused to take the witness stand so far for the
same reason she has stayed out of court during the
trial — Manson's absence.
"She's indicated this is not her trial because she
cannot have members of the Manson family pres
ent," attorney John Virga told reporters last Friday.
Earlier, he had told U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Macßride he would rest his case after only
one day and six witnesses — if Fromme continued
her refusal to testify.
Her testimony is crucial to the central issue of the
case — Fromme's intent when she confronted Ford
with a .45-caliber pistol in a park near the state
Capitol on Sept. 5.

dozen buildings yesterday.
Inspector Connie Melton of the Los Angeles City
Fire Department said eyewitnesses told firemen the
buildings were located in the La Paloma Flats area
above Tujunga.
Winds in the lower canyons were gusting to 25 or

The National Weather Service said the winds

JFK, Ike aware of CIA plots?
WASHINGTON, D.C. — David W. Belin, former
executive director of the CIA Commission Investig
ation headed by Vice President Nelson A. Rockefel
ler said yesterday he believes that both Presidents
Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy were
aware of assassination plots on foreign leaders,
especially Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
Belin said on the CBS-TV "Face the Nation"
program that because the then-head of the CIA,
Allen W. Dulles, was the brother of then-Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles during the Eisenhower
years, and because Robert F. Kennedy was the at
torney general during his brother's administration,
he "assumed" the presidents were aware of the
plots.
He added that the 347-page report issued Thurs
day by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
appeared to be "a thorough job," but he felt it went
"easy" on past presidents and their knowledge of
assassination plots.
Fromme to decide defense
SACRAMENTO — Her loyalty to Charles Man
son weighed against the possibility of a life term in
prison, Lynette Fromme decides today whether to
testify in her own defense against charges of trying
to kill President Ford.
Fromme's lawyer says the 27-year-old defendant
has refused to take the witness stand so far for the
same reason she has stayed out of court during the
trial — Manson's absence.
"She's indicated this is not her trial because she
cannot have members of the Manson family pres
ent," attorney John Virga told reporters last Friday.
Earlier, he had told U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Macßride he would rest his case after only
one day and six witnesses — if Fromme continued
her refusal to testify.
Her testimony is crucial to the central issue of the
case — Fromme's intent when she confronted Ford
with a .45-caliber pistol in a park near the state
Capitol on Sept. 5.

Voting questioned in SF
SAN FRANCISCO—The results of elections de
ciding the fates of ballot propositions worth mill
ions of dollars to San Francisco taxpayers have
been called into question because sufficient num
bers of votes have been found to be potentially
fraudulent.
The San Francisco Examiner in a copyrighted
story yesterday quoted California Secretary of State
March Fong Eu as saying she would move for an
independent audit of San Francisco voter rolls if
"local officials are indifferent or reluctant to act."
The story said fraudulent votes apparently had
been cast by city employes.
The newspaper said its reporters conducted a
detailed inspection of the official records of 10,000
city employes, an investigation that "brought into
serious question whether two ballot propositions
costing taxpayes an added 59 cents per $100 asses
sed valuation on the tax rate were legally ap
proved."
Of the 10,000 employes and pensioners checked,
the paper said 3900 had out-of-town addresses, that
946 of these voted in San Francisco in 1974 and in
many cases in earlier elections.
The paper questioned the passage of Prop. E on
the Nov. 1973 ballot which gave a 20 percent in
crease in pension benefits to city workers. This cost
taxpayers $7.6 million a year and passed by a slim
1308 vote margin.
The other matter questioned was Prop. M on the
Nov. 1974 ballot which increased police and fire
pension benefits by $7.7 million a year. This passed
by 3060 votes.
Lebanon truce dissolves
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon's infant cease-fire
collapsed in bloodshed yesterday, leaving at least
29 persons dead and 85 wounded in Beirut alone.
Fighting also was reported in the northern city of
Tripoli and the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, but
there was no immediate word on casualties. A
police radio call from Baalbek, 40 miles northeast of
Beirut, said 500 Moslem militiamen were attacking
the town hall.
Lebanese premier Rashid Karami announced the
truce Saturday night — the 13th in eight months of
civil war. But one discouraged policeman said:
"The cease-fire never even got off the ground."
Lebanon's outgunned and outnumbered security
forces have given up all pretense of trying to inter
vene between warring Christian and Moslem street
gangs. Tanks and armored personel carriers con
fined their presence to Beirut's shrinking safe'zone,
pulling back whenever gunfire sounded too close.
The 18,000-man army has not been committed
since the civil war began last April, because Karami
and the nation's Christian president, Suleiman
Franjieh, both fear that the army might split into
Christian and Moslem factions.
The spreading street war underlined the
hopelessness of a French mediation mission by
former French Premier Maurice Couve de Murville.
Lebanese politicians had to travel by armored car to
confer with him at the French Embassy, near one
sniper zone in the center of Beirut.

NY relief efforts continue
ALBANY, N.Y. — With Gov. Hugh Carey's $200
million plan to avert a default by New York City
next month in serious jeopardy, the New York
Legislature resumes efforts today to enact a city tax
increase that might put the proposal back together.
But as negotiations on the tax package continued
yesterday, there was no evidence of a breakthrough
in the partisan deadlock that blocked legislative
approval of the taxes Saturday night.
President Ford said last Wednesday he would
decide early this week whether the state and city
had taken enough "further steps toward fiscal re
sponsibility" to justify a reconsideration of federal
aid to help the city avoid default.
Five of the nation's Republican governors said
yesterday at the Republican Governors Association
conference in Wichita, Kansas that they oppose a
federal bailout of New York City, at least until the
city has made stringent efforts to solve its financial
problems.
Rightists mourn Franco
VALLEY OF THE FALLEN, Spain — Gen. Fran
cisco Franco was buried yesterday in a vast under
ground basilica cut into the side ofa granitemoun
tain as legions of civil war veterans and young
rightists gave the Fascist salute and thundered,
"Long Live Franco!"
Wearing the blue shirts of the Falange, more than
100,000 rightists massed at this monument to those
who died in the 1936-39 civil war.
A single cry of "Long Live the King!" was heard
amid the shouts of "Long Live Franco!" But no
voice was raised against the 37-year-old King Juan
Carlos I, Franco's chosen heir, whose installation
Saturday returned Spain to a monarchy after 44
years. He is expected to try to guide the nation away
from the authoritarian style of Franco, who died
Thursday.
UFW ends Capitol sit-in
SACRAMENTO — A group of United Farm
Worker demonstrators, after starting a sit-in at Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr.'s office Thursday afternoon,
marched out early yesterday with no explanation.
The demonstrators were protesting against the
firings of union members by growers.
The demonstrators say that California growers
fird 1165 farm workers for union activity in Sep
tember and October, the first two months that the
slate's new farm labor election law was in effect.
They also demanded theremoval of Walter Kintz,
general counsel of the state Agricultural Labor Re
lations Board.
Brown told the demonstrators he couldn't legally
solve their problems.

NY relief efforts continue
ALBANY, N.Y. — With Gov. Hugh Carey's $200
million plan to avert a default by New York City
next month in serious jeopardy, the New York
Legislature resumes efforts today to enact a city tax
increase that might put the proposal back together.
But as negotiations on the tax package continued
yesterday, there was no evidence of a breakthrough
in the partisan deadlock that blocked legislative
approval of the taxes Saturday night.
President Ford said last Wednesday he would
decide early this week whether the state and city
had taken enough "further steps toward fiscal re
sponsibility" to justify a reconsideration of federal
aid to help the city avoid default.
Five of the nation's Republican governors said
yesterday at the Republican Governors Association
conference in Wichita, Kansas that they oppose a

Rightists mourn Franco
VALLEY OF THE FALLEN, Spain — Gen. Fran
cisco Franco was buried yesterday in a vast under
ground basilica cut into the side ofa granitemoun
tain as legions of civil war veterans and young
rightists gave the Fascist salute and thundered,
"Long Live Franco!"
Wearing the blue shirts of the Falange, more than
100,000 rightists massed at this monument to those
who died in the 1936-39 civil war.
A single cry of "Long Live the King!" was heard
amid the shouts of "Long Live Franco!" But no
voice was raised against the 37-year-old King Juan
Carlos I, Franco's chosen heir, whose installation
Saturday returned Spain to a monarchy after 44
years. He is expected to try to guide the nation away
from the authoritarian style of Franco, who died
Thursday.
UFW ends Capitol sit-in
SACRAMENTO — A group of United Farm
Worker demonstrators, after starting a sit-in at Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr.'s office Thursday afternoon,
marched out early yesterday with no explanation.
The demonstrators were protesting against the
firings of union members by growers.
The demonstrators say that California growers
fird 1165 farm workers for union activity in Sep
tember and October, the first two months that the
slate's new farm labor election law was in effect.
They also demanded theremoval of Walter Kintz,
general counsel of the state Agricultural Labor Re

Brown told the demonstrators he couldn't legally
solve their problems.

Fire burns L.A. forest
LOS ANGELES — A rampaging fire in the
Angeles National Forest erupted into a 9,000-acre
inferno that damaged or destroyed at least two
dozen buildings yesterday.
Inspector Connie Melton of the Los Angeles City
Fire Department said eyewitnesses told firemen the
buildings were located in the La Paloma Flats area
above Tujunga.
Winds in the lower canyons were gusting to 25 or
30 miles an hour, but the fire was being fanned by
gusts of 50 miles an hour along the tops of ridges.
The National Weather Service said the winds
would continue through the night, spreading

JFK, Ike aware of CIA plots?
WASHINGTON, D.C. — David W. Belin, former
executive director of the CIA Commission Investig

Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy were
aware of assassination plots on foreign leaders,
especially Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
Belin said on the CBS-TV "Face the Nation"
program that because the then-head of the CIA,
Allen W. Dulles, was the brother of then-Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles during the Eisenhower
years, and because Robert F. Kennedy was the at
torney general during his brother's administration,
he "assumed" the presidents were aware of the
plots.
He added that the 347-page report issued Thurs
day by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
appeared to be "a thorough job," but he felt it went
"easy" on past presidents and their knowledge of
assassination plots.
Fromme to decide defense
SACRAMENTO — Her loyalty to Charles Man
son weighed against the possibility of a life term in
prison, Lynette Fromme decides today whether to
testify in her own defense against charges of trying
to kill President Ford.
Fromme's lawyer says the 27-year-old defendant
has refused to take the witness stand so far for the
same reason she has stayed out of court during the
trial — Manson's absence.
"She's indicated this is not her trial because she
cannot have members of the Manson family pres
ent," attorney John Virga told reporters last Friday.
Earlier, he had told U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Macßride he would rest his case after only
one day and six witnesses — if Fromme continued
her refusal to testify.
Her testimony is crucial to the central issue of the
case — Fromme's intent when she confronted Ford
with a .45-caliber pistol in a park near the state
Capitol on Sept. 5.

Voting questioned in SF
SAN FRANCISCO—The results of elections de
ciding the fates of ballot propositions worth mill
ions of dollars to San Francisco taxpayers have
been called into question because sufficient num
bers of votes have been found to be potentially
fraudulent.
The San Francisco Examiner in a copyrighted
story yesterday quoted California Secretary of State
March Fong Eu as saying she would move for an
independent audit of San Francisco voter rolls if
"local officials are indifferent or reluctant to act."
The story said fraudulent votes apparently had
been cast by city employes.
The newspaper said its reporters conducted a
detailed inspection of the official records of 10,000
city employes, an investigation that "brought into
serious question whether two ballot propositions
costing taxpayes an added 59 cents per $100 asses
sed valuation on the tax rate were legally ap
proved."
Of the 10,000 employes and pensioners checked,
the paper said 3900 had out-of-town addresses, that
946 of these voted in San Francisco in 1974 and in
many cases in earlier elections.
The paper questioned the passage of Prop. E on
the Nov. 1973 ballot which gave a 20 percent in
crease in pension benefits to city workers. This cost
taxpayers $7.6 million a year and passed by a slim
1308 vote margin.
The other matter questioned was Prop. M on the
Nov. 1974 ballot which increased police and fire
pension benefits by $7.7 million a year. This passed
by 3060 votes.
Lebanon truce dissolves
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon's infant cease-fire
collapsed in bloodshed yesterday, leaving at least
29 persons dead and 85 wounded in Beirut alone.
Fighting also was reported in the northern city of
Tripoli and the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, but
there was no immediate word on casualties. A
police radio call from Baalbek, 40 miles northeast of
Beirut, said 500 Moslem militiamen were attacking
the town hall.
Lebanese premier Rashid Karami announced the
truce Saturday night — the 13th in eight months of
civil war. But one discouraged policeman said:
"The cease-fire never even got off the ground."
Lebanon's outgunned and outnumbered security
forces have given up all pretense of trying to inter
vene between warring Christian and Moslem street
gangs. Tanks and armored personel carriers con
fined their presence to Beirut's shrinking safe'zone,
pulling back whenever gunfire sounded too close.
The 18,000-man army has not been committed
since the civil war began last April, because Karami
and the nation's Christian president, Suleiman
Franjieh, both fear that the army might split into
Christian and Moslem factions.
The spreading street war underlined the
hopelessness of a French mediation mission by
former French Premier Maurice Couve de Murville.
Lebanese politicians had to travel by armored car to
confer with him at the French Embassy, near one
sniper zone in the center of Beirut.
Saturday mail to stop?

Lebanon truce dissolves
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon's infant cease-fire
collapsed in bloodshed yesterday, leaving at least
29 persons dead and 85 wounded in Beirut alone.
Fighting also was reported in the northern city of
Tripoli and the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, but
there was no immediate word on casualties. A
police radio call from Baalbek, 40 miles northeast of
Beirut, said 500 Moslem militiamen were attacking
the town hall.
Lebanese premier Rashid Karami announced the
truce Saturday night — the 13th in eight months of
civil war. But one discouraged policeman said:
"The cease-fire never even got off the ground."
Lebanon's outgunned and outnumbered security
forces have given up all pretense of trying to inter
vene between warring Christian and Moslem street
gangs. Tanks and armored personel carriers con
fined their presence to Beirut's shrinking safe'zone,
pulling back whenever gunfire sounded too close.
The 18,000-man army has not been committed
since the civil war began last April, because Karami
and the nation's Christian president, Suleiman
Franjieh, both fear that the army might split into
Christian and Moslem factions.
The spreading street war underlined the
hopelessness of a French mediation mission by
former French Premier Maurice Couve de Murville.
Lebanese politicians had to travel by armored car to
confer with him at the French Embassy, near one
sniper zone in the center of Beirut.
Saturday mail to stop?

NY relief efforts continue
ALBANY, N.Y. — With Gov. Hugh Carey's $200
million plan to avert a default by New York City
next month in serious jeopardy, the New York
Legislature resumes efforts today to enact a city tax
increase that might put the proposal back together.
But as negotiations on the tax package continued
yesterday, there was no evidence of a breakthrough
in the partisan deadlock that blocked legislative
approval of the taxes Saturday night.
President Ford said last Wednesday he would
decide early this week whether the state and city
had taken enough "further steps toward fiscal re
sponsibility" to justify a reconsideration of federal
aid to help the city avoid default.
Five of the nation's Republican governors said
yesterday at the Republican Governors Association
conference in Wichita, Kansas that they oppose a
federal bailout of New York City, at least until the
city has made stringent efforts to solve its financial
problems.
Rightists mourn Franco
VALLEY OF THE FALLEN, Spain — Gen. Fran
cisco Franco was buried yesterday in a vast under
ground basilica cut into the side ofa granitemoun
tain as legions of civil war veterans and young
rightists gave the Fascist salute and thundered,
"Long Live Franco!"
Wearing the blue shirts of the Falange, more than
100,000 rightists massed at this monument to those
who died in the 1936-39 civil war.
A single cry of "Long Live the King!" was heard
amid the shouts of "Long Live Franco!" But no
voice was raised against the 37-year-old King Juan
Carlos I, Franco's chosen heir, whose installation
Saturday returned Spain to a monarchy after 44
years. He is expected to try to guide the nation away
from the authoritarian style of Franco, who died
Thursday.
UFW ends Capitol sit-in
SACRAMENTO — A group of United Farm
Worker demonstrators, after starting a sit-in at Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr.'s office Thursday afternoon,
marched out early yesterday with no explanation.
The demonstrators were protesting against the
firings of union members by growers.
The demonstrators say that California growers
fird 1165 farm workers for union activity in Sep
tember and October, the first two months that the
slate's new farm labor election law was in effect.
They also demanded theremoval of Walter Kintz,
general counsel of the state Agricultural Labor Re

Brown told the demonstrators he couldn't legally
solve their problems.

Fire burns L.A. forest
LOS ANGELES — A rampaging fire in the
Angeles National Forest erupted into a 9,000-acre
inferno that damaged or destroyed at least two
dozen buildings yesterday.
Inspector Connie Melton of the Los Angeles City
Fire Department said eyewitnesses told firemen the
buildings were located in the La Paloma Flats area
above Tujunga.
Winds in the lower canyons were gusting to 25 or
30 miles an hour, but the fire was being fanned by
gusts of 50 miles an hour along the tops of ridges.
The National Weather Service said the winds

JFK, Ike aware of CIA plots?
WASHINGTON, D.C. — David W. Belin, former
executive director of the CIA Commission Investig

Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy were
aware of assassination plots on foreign leaders,
especially Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
Belin said on the CBS-TV "Face the Nation"
program that because the then-head of the CIA,
Allen W. Dulles, was the brother of then-Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles during the Eisenhower
years, and because Robert F. Kennedy was the at
torney general during his brother's administration,
he "assumed" the presidents were aware of the
plots.
He added that the 347-page report issued Thurs
day by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
appeared to be "a thorough job," but he felt it went
"easy" on past presidents and their knowledge of
assassination plots.
Fromme to decide defense
SACRAMENTO — Her loyalty to Charles Man
son weighed against the possibility of a life term in
prison, Lynette Fromme decides today whether to
testify in her own defense against charges of trying
to kill President Ford.
Fromme's lawyer says the 27-year-old defendant
has refused to take the witness stand so far for the
same reason she has stayed out of court during the
trial — Manson's absence.
"She's indicated this is not her trial because she
cannot have members of the Manson family pres
ent," attorney John Virga told reporters last Friday.
Earlier, he had told U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Macßride he would rest his case after only
one day and six witnesses — if Fromme continued
her refusal to testify.
Her testimony is crucial to the central issue of the
case — Fromme's intent when she confronted Ford
with a .45-caliber pistol in a park near the state
Capitol on Sept. 5.

Voting questioned in SF
SAN FRANCISCO—The results of elections de

been called into question because sufficient num

The San Francisco Examiner in a copyrighted

"local officials are indifferent or reluctant to act."

city employes, an investigation that "brought into

Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy were
aware of assassination plots on foreign leaders,
especially Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.
Belin said on the CBS-TV "Face the Nation"
program that because the then-head of the CIA,
Allen W. Dulles, was the brother of then-Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles during the Eisenhower
years, and because Robert F. Kennedy was the at
torney general during his brother's administration,
he "assumed" the presidents were aware of the
plots.
He added that the 347-page report issued Thurs
day by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
appeared to be "a thorough job," but he felt it went
"easy" on past presidents and their knowledge of
assassination plots.
Fromme to decide defense
SACRAMENTO — Her loyalty to Charles Man
son weighed against the possibility of a life term in
prison, Lynette Fromme decides today whether to
testify in her own defense against charges of trying
to kill President Ford.
Fromme's lawyer says the 27-year-old defendant
has refused to take the witness stand so far for the
same reason she has stayed out of court during the
trial — Manson's absence.
"She's indicated this is not her trial because she
cannot have members of the Manson family pres
ent," attorney John Virga told reporters last Friday.
Earlier, he had told U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Macßride he would rest his case after only
one day and six witnesses — if Fromme continued
her refusal to testify.
Her testimony is crucial to the central issue of the
case — Fromme's intent when she confronted Ford
with a .45-caliber pistol in a park near the state
Capitol on Sept. 5.
