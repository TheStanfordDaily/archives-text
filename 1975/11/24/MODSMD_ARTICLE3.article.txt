# Japan could build nuclear armaments

### DAVE SARTORIS 
Japan presently has the technology
to develop atomic weapons as rapidly
as any current non-nuclear nation, but
probably will not do so, according to
John Emerson, former U.S. ambas
sador to Japan.
His remarks here last week accom
panied a showing of the film
Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the
Asian-American Film Series.
Emerson added that he did not an
ticipate such development in the im
mediate future.
"In the first place, Japanese public
opinion against nuclear involvement
of any sort is still strongly supported
by memories of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki," he said. "A recent survey
indicated that 77 percent of the popu
lation supports the doctrine that Japan
will not possess, make, or permit nuc
lear arms to be brought into the coun
try."
No retaliation
Nuclear development would be
futile for Japan because it lacks a
second-strike capability, Emerson
continued. "Japan is a nation about the
size of California with an extremely
concentrated population, and as a re
sult is extremely vulnerable to nuclear
attack. A single weapon of sufficient
size could severely incapacitate any
provisions for retaliation which were
present.

"I see no justifiable reason why the
Japanese should want nuclear
weapons. They presently have an ade
quate military defense force to handle
peacetime needs. And. should more
serious threats to national security
arise. Japan is protected by the United
States nuclear umbrella through the
provisions of the security treaty," he
said.
Emerson devoted much of his talk to
arguments on the necessity of using
the atomic bomb to end World War II
in the Pacific.
Emerson indicated that there were a
number of top Japanese officials who
felt that the war should be ended when
the nation's situation became critical
in mid-1945.
Avoidable use
"If the United States could have em
phasized that the terms of our 'uncon
ditional surrender' might include pre
servation of the Emperorship, use of
the atomic bomb might have been av
oided," Emerson claimed. "More ag
gressive Japanese factions in govern
ment failed to recognize this possibil
ity. and hence, strongly objected to the
Potsdam Declaration of July 26,1945."
/ Emerson rejected the belief of some
historians that the atomic bomb was
dropped primarily to scare the Rus
sians. "Foremost in our minds at that
time was to end the war as quickly as
