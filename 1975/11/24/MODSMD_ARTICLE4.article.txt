# Further investigation of RFK murder urged
## Lowenstein wants help 
### RON SEGE 
Expressing anxiety over the future of
an investigation which he hoped
would prove that Sirhan Sirhan was
not the lone assassin of Robert Ken
nedy, former Rep. Allard Lowenstein
(D-N.Y.) said Friday, "We have carried
it (the investigation) as far as we can
without help.
"There is no way, unless there is
support, for a half-dozen people to
make this thing come alive when the
district attorney of Los Angeles, the
attorney general of California, the only
newspaper of general circulation in
Los Angeles (the Times), the police
department and the general structure
of the government refuses to help at
best, and tries to stop us more gener
ally," Lowenstein said.
Lowenstein's lament to an audience
at the Meyer Library Forum Room
came in the wake of a recent test-firing
of bullets from Sirhan's gun which, ac
cording to ballistic specialists, found
no substantial evidence to indicate the

presence of a second gun rti the Ken
nedy shooting.
The "second gun" hypothesis is the
cornerstone of Lowenstein's theory
about the case. He had campaigned for
the test firing of Sirhan's gun for some
time before Superior Court Judge
Robert Wenke ordered it earlier this
year.
Inaccurate reports
Lowenstein complained Friday that
widespread reports that the test had
discounted the two-gun theory were
inaccurate. He claimed that the ballis
tics panel was split on some findings
and that it found there was insufficient
evidence to determine the number of
guns used.
Formerly Dean of Student Affairs
here and more recently an aide to Gov.
Edmund G. Brown Jr.. Lowenstein ap
peared on campus for the second time
in a year to generate support for his
investigation.
His aim, he said, was "to invoke
some activity here which one hopes

would spread out until finally some
thing reasonable is done in the state of
California."
Lowenstein told of what he called a
new development in the case: last
week's declaration by former Los
Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent
Bugliosi that new inconsistencies in
the case have been found.
More than eight
Bugliosi contends that more than
eight bullets were fired in the pantry of
the Ambassador Hotel the night of the
assassination. Because Sirhan's gun
could hold only eight bullets, such a
finding would indicate the presence of
a second gun.
Lowenstein said that five bullets
were recovered from bystanders and
two from Kennedy, while three bullet
holes were found in the ceiling panels,
one in the senator's jacket shoulder
and one in his chest. Bugliosi
theorized that more than eight bullets
were responsible for the damages.
Bugliosi also pointed to a news
photo taken shortly after the assassina
tion which showed two policemen
pointing to another bullet hole in the
pantry door. The photo was never re
leased, and police denied its validity
claiming the photo was fabricated,
Bugliosi said. A phone call to the offic
ers revealed that there was indeed a
hole there and that a bullet was inside,
he added.
But when he attempted to get a
signed statement from the officers on
the matter, Bugliosi said, city officials
ordered them not to make any state
ments.
LAPD uncooperative
Lowenstein commented, "When the
Los Angeles Police Department disco
vered that two police officers ... on
duty . . . looking for evidence as
sociated with the assassination . . .
found and reported that they found a
bullet in a door (which makes nine bul
lets), instead of attempting to cooper
ate, the LAPD instructed the officers
not to issue a statement."

the officers to ask about the bullet,
state Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger and
the Los Angeles district attorney ob
jected, Lowenstein said. Both claimed
that the inquiry must be halted be
cause of excessive cost.
Pointing to what he called another
major discrepancy in the case, Low
enstein said that an autopsy on Ken
nedy showed that the fatal bullet en
tered from behind at a distance of one
inch, while "no witness places the
muzzle of Sirhan's gun closer than one
to three feet."
The present court order which al
lowed a test-firing of the Sirhan gun
only applies to physical evidence and
does not allow a re-hearing of tes
timony, Lowenstein said, thus pre
venting an examination of the firing
range discrepancy.
