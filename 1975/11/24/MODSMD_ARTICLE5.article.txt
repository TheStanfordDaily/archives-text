# 'Don't cut student services budget'
## Task force reports 
### CHARLIE HALL 
Attempts to reduce the University's
operating deficit by cutting funds for
non-academic student services and ac
tivities will not prove very fruitful, ac
cording to a study by Task Force II of
the Budget Priorities Commission.
The task force, appointed last spring
to see whether major cuts in University
expenditures on student services are
feasible, argued that, "there is little
'fat' " to be removed from the student
services budget.
"The committee didn't argue that
there are no more cuts to be made, but
that the things that are left to be cut
will hurt," according to Assoc.
Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen, a
member of the task force.
The committee argued that a large
scale slashing of student service fund
ing is inadvisable for two reasons.
First, the task force argued, "a great
many economies have been adopted"
already, leaving little room for further
cutting. Second, the group noted, the
University's total expenditures on

student services and activities account
for less than five percent of the money
spent each year out of general funds, so
even a total elimination of student ser
vices will have only a minimal impact
on Stanford's attempts to cut its
operating deficit.
Across the board
The committee report recom
mended a reduction in scale for all
student services and activities, rather
than abolishing some so that others
may survive at their present level. Al
though the committee suggested few
specific cuts, two suggestions have
been under fire.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz criti
cized a task force recommendation
that the University consider charging
his department more money for the
maintenance of athletic facilities. Cur
rently, 20 percent of the operation and
maintenance costs are paid out of the
intercollegiate athletics budget.
"Quite frankly, the athletic depart
ment is supporting a lot of things
which don't show up in the budget,"
Ruetz said yesterday. Ruetz claims that
some revenue from intercollegiate
sports is being used to pay for Univer
sity physical education programs.
Under the present policy, the sum
that sports teams must pay the Univer
sity is based on the average amount of
time that they use the facilities.'Last
year, these fees paid approximately
one-fifth of the $447,000 needed to
maintain Stanford's athletic facilities.
The committee's rationale for its re
commendation was that although in
tercollegiate teams use Stanford
facilities for a relatively small amount
of time, many of the facilities would
not even exist were it not for the pres
ence of intercollegiate athletic squads.
The overwhelming majority
. . It is hard to imagine construct
ing the stadium and Maples Pavillion
for intramural sports," the report said.

"Since intercollegiate athletics and
physical education are the primary
justification for the facilities, their
budgets should assume the over
whelming majority of the costs," the
study argues.
The report suggested that the Athle
tic Department could pay the added
costs by pruning some of its expendi
tures and by increasing ticket prices
for spectator sports.
Ruetz claimed that any attempt by
the University to shift a large share of
facility costs onto his department will
cause "a substantial elimination of
whole sports, both men's and
women's, and maybe of personnel
within the department."
Ruetz added that increases in ticket
prices represent an inadequate solu
tion, saying that, "many of the com
mittee members aren't familiar with
the problems that are faced competing
with professional athletic teams (for
spectators)."
Lounge rent
The task force also recommended
that the Budget Priorities Commission
examine the controversial possibility
of the University charging rent to pro
fessional school lounges.
Because the lounges, whose sales to
taled an estimated $350,000 last year,
are not presently billed for their use of
University space, they are in effect re
ceiving a business subsidy, the report
commented.
Some supporters of the lounges
have argued that having to pay a fee for
University space will penalize a valu
able student service.
The task force study also investi
gated funding of counseling, health
care and psychological services. It said
that student surveys showed sufficient
use to justify their present level of
funding, but suggested that theCowell
infirmary might be eliminated if a
suitable substitution could be found.
