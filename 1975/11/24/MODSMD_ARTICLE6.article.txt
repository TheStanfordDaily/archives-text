# Liberal arts jobs hardest to find
## 
### TERENCE MEALMAN 
Stanford students have a "funda
mental advantage" in today's competi
tive job market, but liberal arts
graduates still face an especially tight
employment situation, according to
Ralph Keller, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC).
"Our people are different in the
sense that people are looking for
them," Keller said, and the CPPC ex
ists to facilitate the "looking" process
at both ends.
According to the 1973-4 Annual Re
port of the CPPC, a total of 416 organi
zations from business, industry, gov
ernment and education visited Stan
ford to conduct more than 9000 inter
views.
But the report states that, "the least
successful candidates (in securing
positions) were those who completed
liberal arts degree programs and who
prepared to teach in the public schools
. . . the most successful candidates
were those who prepared themselves
for positions relating to business and
engineering."
Use constant
The number and diversity of stu
dents using the center "tends to run

about the same from year to year," Kel
ler said, although unofficial reports
indicated increasing use of the Center
by liberal arts graduates.
Most employers are "looking for
someone to fit something rather spe
cial," said Keller, noting the
specialized needs of many businesses
such as IBM and General Motors. The
overall job squeeze has been created by
an apparent excess of college
graduates, Keller said.
"Our job is to help students to know
and understand these problems," Kel
ler said. Toward that end, the CPPC
schedules self-assessment workshops,
seminars on resume writing, inter
views with potential employers and
approximately 3000 hours (yearly) of
one-to-one counseling. Students in
terviewed at the Center reported satis
faction with the aid they have received
from the CPPC.
"If it weren't for the Placement
Center, I would have to send out all
kinds of resumes," said Tom Halbert,
graduate student in chemistry.
Organizational center
"The Placement Center provides an
organizational center," Halbert con
tinued. "I know where to come with
out having to go visiting all over the
country."
William Weaver, a graduate student
in English on his first visit to the CPPC,
said he expected the center "to obtain
connections that don't exist else
where" while acting as "specialists
who know where the jobs are."
Although Weaver will proceed with
his own efforts to secure a job, he views
the Placement Center as "another av
enue to search out a job when jobs are
scarce ... 1 wouldn't fee! as if 1 had
searched out all possible choices un
less I had come here."
Keller also claimed "considerable
evidence" of business satisfaction
with the CPPC and the students ob
tained through the center's program.

The number and diversity of stu
dents using the center "tends to run

about the same from year to year," Kel
ler said, although unofficial reports
indicated increasing use of the Center
by liberal arts graduates.
Most employers are "looking for
someone to fit something rather spe
cial," said Keller, noting the
specialized needs of many businesses
such as IBM and General Motors. The
overall job squeeze has been created by
an apparent excess of college
graduates, Keller said.
"Our job is to help students to know
and understand these problems," Kel
ler said. Toward that end, the CPPC
schedules self-assessment workshops,
seminars on resume writing, inter
views with potential employers and
approximately 3000 hours (yearly) of
one-to-one counseling. Students in
terviewed at the Center reported satis
faction with the aid they have received
from the CPPC.
"If it weren't for the Placement
Center, I would have to send out all
kinds of resumes," said Tom Halbert,
graduate student in chemistry.
Organizational center
"The Placement Center provides an
organizational center," Halbert con
tinued. "I know where to come with
out having to go visiting all over the
country."
William Weaver, a graduate student
in English on his first visit to the CPPC,
said he expected the center "to obtain
connections that don't exist else
where" while acting as "specialists
who know where the jobs are."
Although Weaver will proceed with
his own efforts to secure a job, he views
the Placement Center as "another av
enue to search out a job when jobs are
scarce ... 1 wouldn't fee! as if 1 had
searched out all possible choices un
less I had come here."
Keller also claimed "considerable
evidence" of business satisfaction
with the CPPC and the students ob
tained through the center's program.
Stanford students have a "funda
mental advantage" in today's competi
tive job market, but liberal arts
graduates still face an especially tight
employment situation, according to
Ralph Keller, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC).
"Our people are different in the
sense that people are looking for
them," Keller said, and the CPPC ex
ists to facilitate the "looking" process
at both ends.
According to the 1973-4 Annual Re
port of the CPPC, a total of 416 organi
zations from business, industry, gov
ernment and education visited Stan
ford to conduct more than 9000 inter
views.
