C BERKELEY — The young man |
E sat down on a bench in Sproul Plaza
band opened up the Daily'
gCalifornian; "Shit man. This can't
► be true."
► He was only one of 5000 Univer-
F sity of California (UC) students to be
F puzzled by the main headline of
[Friday's special edition of the cam
pus paper. "NCAA Nixes Rose
Bowl: Bears Back On Probation"
screamed the front page.
In the Athletic Department, the
switchboard lit up with calls asking
about the story. "The whole cam-"
pus is in a tizzy," fretted Athletic \
Director Dave Maggard's secretary.
"People are going crazy. They don't
know what to think."
Seven thousand copies of the
troublesome issue, actually a bogus
edition prepared by Daily staffers,
were taken to Berkeley Friday.
But only 5000 copies were distri
buted before the hoax was disco- .
vered by a member of the Cal Rally ,
Committee.
Eight members of the Daily
created the issue last week. The
issue was partially paid for by con- '
itributions from Daily staffers.
