What is happening here?
Since when does a minority have
decision making power over a
majority?
I support the current petition
circulating which is calling for a
special election ballot to prove
that a majority of currently en
rolled students are in favor of re
storing of the faculty and alumni
are also in favor of such a move.
If it is their association to the
term "mascot" which the Native
Americans or their representa
tives object to, let us not cloud
this issue with immediate refer
ences to witless billygoats or to
inane-looking bulldogs named
"Spike," but rather consider a
dictionary definition of the term
"mascot" — "a person, animal or
object supposed to bring good
luck."
The Stanford Indian is as sim
ple as it's definition; it is a mas
cot. It very simply represents the
students of this University and
their spirit. It is insignificant and
unrelated to the dignity of a race
of people.
If the members of a race choose
to associate themselves with this
insignificance, it is soley of
their own doing and through
their own misinterpretations,
and therefore the fault lies with
them.
Faulty interpretations
It is pathetic that so many are
forced to surrender something
they treasure so much as a direct
result of a ruling based on these
pessimistic, second-guess in
terpretations of a few.
I doubt very seriously if any of
that majority who are in favor of
restoring the Stanford Indian are
in any way, directly or indi
rectly, in favor of destroying re
spect for Native Americans. Nor
are they in favor of making fun of
them. If this were the case, we
would be simultaneously de
grading ourselves because this
mascot also stands a symbol

Marc Harris

which represents us as students
of excellence it represents.
Perspective needed
Let us keep things in their
proper perspective. It is also
preposterous to firmly believe
that the cartoon drawing of the
Stanford Indian or that "women
in little short skirts, dancing
around" is in any way reflective
of or directed at the Native
American culture.
Those persons who choose
this interpretation are only ex
pressing a manifestation of in
security in their own self-respect
as a group. True respect and dig
nity in one's culture or group is a
product of the self respect of the
individuals which comprise the
group. It cannot be derived by a
simple fabrication of external
factors to give the impression of
respect and dignity.
Wrong correlations
If the Native American faction
feel it necessary to correlate the
selection of the Indian as our
mascot and themselves as a cul
tural group, there is an equally
valid; if, in fact, it is not the true
interpretation they may choose
to take.
That is, I should think they
would feel honored that as dis
tinguished and institution as
Stanford and the ma
jprity of the students attending it
are so emphatically choosing to
restore the Stanford Indian and
have it represent them.
Because of the preceeding
considerations, I urge all stu
dents, pro and con, to support
the special election. This sup
port, of course, does not neces
sarily indicate one's preferences
in this issue, but rather expresses
a belief in and support of the
democratic process. I say let the
interpretations of the majority
decide this issue.

Faulty interpretations
It is pathetic that so many are
forced to surrender something
they treasure so much as a direct
result of a ruling based on these
pessimistic, second-guess in
terpretations of a few.
I doubt very seriously if any of
that majority who are in favor of
restoring the Stanford Indian are
in any way, directly or indi
rectly, in favor of destroying re
spect for Native Americans. Nor
are they in favor of making fun of
them. If this were the case, we
would be simultaneously de
grading ourselves because this
mascot also stands a symbol

Marc Harris

which represents us as students
of excellence it represents.
Perspective needed
Let us keep things in their
proper perspective. It is also
preposterous to firmly believe
that the cartoon drawing of the
Stanford Indian or that "women
in little short skirts, dancing
around" is in any way reflective
of or directed at the Native
American culture.
Those persons who choose
this interpretation are only ex
pressing a manifestation of in
security in their own self-respect
as a group. True respect and dig
nity in one's culture or group is a
product of the self respect of the
individuals which comprise the
group. It cannot be derived by a
simple fabrication of external
factors to give the impression of
respect and dignity.
Wrong correlations
If the Native American faction
feel it necessary to correlate the
selection of the Indian as our
mascot and themselves as a cul
tural group, there is an equally
valid; if, in fact, it is not the true
interpretation they may choose
to take.
That is, I should think they
would feel honored that as dis
tinguished and institution as
Stanford and the ma
jprity of the students attending it
are so emphatically choosing to
restore the Stanford Indian and
have it represent them.
Because of the preceeding
considerations, I urge all stu
dents, pro and con, to support
the special election. This sup
port, of course, does not neces
sarily indicate one's preferences
in this issue, but rather expresses
a belief in and support of the
democratic process. I say let the
interpretations of the majority
decide this issue.

dent in biological sciences.)
What is happening here?
Since when does a minority have
decision making power over a
majority?
I support the current petition
circulating which is calling for a
special election ballot to prove
that a majority of currently en
rolled students are in favor of re
storing of the faculty and alumni
are also in favor of such a move.
If it is their association to the
term "mascot" which the Native
Americans or their representa
tives object to, let us not cloud
this issue with immediate refer
ences to witless billygoats or to
inane-looking bulldogs named
"Spike," but rather consider a
dictionary definition of the term
"mascot" — "a person, animal or
object supposed to bring good
luck."
The Stanford Indian is as sim
ple as it's definition; it is a mas
cot. It very simply represents the
students of this University and
their spirit. It is insignificant and
unrelated to the dignity of a race
of people.
If the members of a race choose
to associate themselves with this
insignificance, it is soley of
their own doing and through
their own misinterpretations,
and therefore the fault lies with
them.
