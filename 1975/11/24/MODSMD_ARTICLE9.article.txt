Since it is now very much in
vogue to piously proffer opin
ions concerning the Indian
issue, I would like to add my
commentary to the growing list
of once read and forever forgot
ten articles and letters.
It is important for the reader to
understand from the outset that I
do not advocate the return of the
big-nosed, braided and highly
offensive Indian head symbol.
I do, however, fail to see how
the figure of a majestic Indian in
full headdress can be labelled of
fensive. This same type of head
was used on national coins for
many years until the much more
appropriate, no doubt less offen
sive, and certainly much more
representative heads of Lincoln
and Jefferson was substituted.
Soon perhaps the symbols of
the Atlanta Braves, the Kansas
City Chiefs and the Washington
Redskins will be purged through
the efforts of an emphathic
group of Stanford students car
rying their cause beyond
the halls of academia and into
the lives of the less enlihtened.
Boycott threatened
The Palo Alto merchants have
recently been threatened with a
boycott of their stores by the
Stanford community of they sell
Indian decals. Now who would
dare speak for the entire Stan
ford community or even the stu
dent body on an issue of such
minor relevance to most of the
campus?
Why yes, it's the familiar ban
ner of the Council of Presidents.
What a travesty these elected of
ficials have made of the democ
ratic process, employing com
mon blackmail tactics to get
their way.
It is hard to acknowledge that
these four sanctimonious indi
viduals represent the Stanford
student body when only 30 per
cent of that body elected them.
Instead of these and other indi
viduals standing on soap boxes
in the name of the students, the
most obviously fair way to de
cide the issue is through a re
ferendum.
When I was the elections
commissioner in 1972, we held
such a referendum to determine
whether the Indian was to be in
or out. A not so surprising 60
percent of those who voted
wished to retain the Indian and
over 10 percent of the remaining
40 percent didn't care to cast
their votes in protest of such a
waste of time.
Minority rights
I agree that the majority
should not abuse the rights of the
minority on this or any other
issue.but why shouldthe major
ity allow itself to be pushed
around by a small and overly
vocal minority?
The majority seems to be most

Mike Nilsson

of the Stanford community (in
cluding alumni) who cannot
understand what all the fuss is
about and probably wouldn't
give a damn if it did.
The minority seems to consist
of two distinct factions. On one
side we have a solid group of
nostalgic alumni and students
who have fond memories of Pr
ince Lightfoot, the band playing
"Redskin," we have a group of
neophytic individuals with
guilty liberal consciences. The
latter are the ones who leave
movie theaters outraged after se
eing the very popular films de
picting cruel white bastards
cheating and killing Indians to
satisfy their greed for land and
wealth.
They are content knowing
they don't do anything like their
ancestors did.
More attention
We should really pay more at
tention to the opinions of the
group the Indian mascot is sup
posed to be ridiculing, namely
the Native American.
Timm Williams (Prince Light
foot) received many letters from
tribes in the Arizona-California
and Pacific Northwest areas stat
ing that their people would
be proud and not insulted if
Stanford retained the Indian as
its symbol. However, certain de
cision makers have chosen to lis
ten to other groups of "con
cerned," "insulted" and unre
lated people.
After all, Stanford wouldn't
want a mascot having the divine
condemnation of the United
Campus Christian Ministry, the
divided disapproval of the
ASSU Senate or the solid Third
World castigation of MEChA.
This whole issue is being taken
far too seriously by people who
have no right to feel of
fended.
Let the campus members of
the Native American nation and
the tribes themselves tell
us what they think without
being goaded by other Third
World peoples.
Oliphant's cartoons
Stop to think how the subjects
of Oliphant's lampooning pen
feel when they see themselves
with large chins, huge lips and
protruding noses. Maybe we
should be more serious about the
business of life.
Let's stop making fun of each
other because we never know
which minority group we might
be offending or even who consti
tutes the current "oppressed
minority group." We are stuck
with a piece of Stanford's past
and it cannot be ignored.
The democratic process dic
tates as it does concerning all
popular disputes: let the people
decide.

commissioner in 1972, we held
such a referendum to determine
whether the Indian was to be in
or out. A not so surprising 60
percent of those who voted
wished to retain the Indian and
over 10 percent of the remaining
40 percent didn't care to cast
their votes in protest of such a
waste of time.
Minority rights
I agree that the majority
should not abuse the rights of the
minority on this or any other
issue.but why shouldthe major
ity allow itself to be pushed
around by a small and overly
vocal minority?
The majority seems to be most

Mike Nilsson

of the Stanford community (in
cluding alumni) who cannot
understand what all the fuss is
about and probably wouldn't
give a damn if it did.
The minority seems to consist
of two distinct factions. On one
side we have a solid group of
nostalgic alumni and students
who have fond memories of Pr
ince Lightfoot, the band playing
"Redskin," we have a group of
neophytic individuals with
guilty liberal consciences. The
latter are the ones who leave
movie theaters outraged after se
eing the very popular films de
picting cruel white bastards
cheating and killing Indians to
satisfy their greed for land and
wealth.
They are content knowing
they don't do anything like their
ancestors did.
More attention
We should really pay more at
tention to the opinions of the
group the Indian mascot is sup
posed to be ridiculing, namely
the Native American.
Timm Williams (Prince Light
foot) received many letters from
tribes in the Arizona-California
and Pacific Northwest areas stat
ing that their people would
be proud and not insulted if
Stanford retained the Indian as
its symbol. However, certain de
cision makers have chosen to lis
ten to other groups of "con
cerned," "insulted" and unre
lated people.
After all, Stanford wouldn't
want a mascot having the divine
condemnation of the United
Campus Christian Ministry, the
divided disapproval of the
ASSU Senate or the solid Third
World castigation of MEChA.
This whole issue is being taken
far too seriously by people who
have no right to feel of
fended.
Let the campus members of
the Native American nation and
the tribes themselves tell
us what they think without
being goaded by other Third
World peoples.
Oliphant's cartoons
Stop to think how the subjects
of Oliphant's lampooning pen
feel when they see themselves
with large chins, huge lips and
protruding noses. Maybe we
should be more serious about the
business of life.
Let's stop making fun of each
other because we never know
which minority group we might
be offending or even who consti
tutes the current "oppressed
minority group." We are stuck
with a piece of Stanford's past
and it cannot be ignored.
The democratic process dic
tates as it does concerning all
popular disputes: let the people
decide.
(Michael Nilsson is a 1974 Stan
ford graduate.)
Since it is now very much in
vogue to piously proffer opin
ions concerning the Indian
issue, I would like to add my
commentary to the growing list
of once read and forever forgot
ten articles and letters.
It is important for the reader to
understand from the outset that I
do not advocate the return of the
big-nosed, braided and highly
offensive Indian head symbol.
I do, however, fail to see how
the figure of a majestic Indian in
full headdress can be labelled of
fensive. This same type of head
was used on national coins for
many years until the much more
appropriate, no doubt less offen
sive, and certainly much more
representative heads of Lincoln
and Jefferson was substituted.
Soon perhaps the symbols of
the Atlanta Braves, the Kansas
City Chiefs and the Washington
Redskins will be purged through
the efforts of an emphathic
group of Stanford students car
rying their cause beyond
the halls of academia and into
the lives of the less enlihtened.
Boycott threatened
The Palo Alto merchants have
recently been threatened with a
boycott of their stores by the
Stanford community of they sell
Indian decals. Now who would
dare speak for the entire Stan
ford community or even the stu
dent body on an issue of such
minor relevance to most of the
campus?
Why yes, it's the familiar ban
ner of the Council of Presidents.
What a travesty these elected of
ficials have made of the democ
ratic process, employing com
mon blackmail tactics to get
their way.
It is hard to acknowledge that
these four sanctimonious indi
viduals represent the Stanford
student body when only 30 per
cent of that body elected them.
Instead of these and other indi
viduals standing on soap boxes
in the name of the students, the
most obviously fair way to de
cide the issue is through a re
ferendum.

condemnation of the United
Campus Christian Ministry, the
divided disapproval of the
ASSU Senate or the solid Third
World castigation of MEChA.
This whole issue is being taken
far too seriously by people who
have no right to feel of
fended.
Let the campus members of
the Native American nation and
the tribes themselves tell
us what they think without
being goaded by other Third
World peoples.
Oliphant's cartoons
Stop to think how the subjects
of Oliphant's lampooning pen
feel when they see themselves
with large chins, huge lips and
protruding noses. Maybe we
should be more serious about the
business of life.
Let's stop making fun of each
other because we never know
which minority group we might
be offending or even who consti
tutes the current "oppressed
minority group." We are stuck
with a piece of Stanford's past
and it cannot be ignored.
The democratic process dic
tates as it does concerning all
popular disputes: let the people
decide.

Since it is now very much in
vogue to piously proffer opin
ions concerning the Indian
issue, I would like to add my
commentary to the growing list
of once read and forever forgot
ten articles and letters.
It is important for the reader to
understand from the outset that I
do not advocate the return of the
big-nosed, braided and highly
offensive Indian head symbol.
I do, however, fail to see how
the figure of a majestic Indian in
full headdress can be labelled of
fensive. This same type of head
was used on national coins for
many years until the much more
appropriate, no doubt less offen
sive, and certainly much more
representative heads of Lincoln
and Jefferson was substituted.
Soon perhaps the symbols of
the Atlanta Braves, the Kansas
City Chiefs and the Washington
Redskins will be purged through
the efforts of an emphathic
group of Stanford students car
rying their cause beyond
the halls of academia and into
the lives of the less enlihtened.
Boycott threatened
The Palo Alto merchants have
recently been threatened with a
boycott of their stores by the
Stanford community of they sell
Indian decals. Now who would
dare speak for the entire Stan
ford community or even the stu
dent body on an issue of such
minor relevance to most of the
campus?
Why yes, it's the familiar ban
ner of the Council of Presidents.
What a travesty these elected of
ficials have made of the democ
ratic process, employing com
mon blackmail tactics to get
their way.
It is hard to acknowledge that
these four sanctimonious indi
viduals represent the Stanford
student body when only 30 per
cent of that body elected them.
Instead of these and other indi
viduals standing on soap boxes
in the name of the students, the
most obviously fair way to de
cide the issue is through a re
ferendum.
When I was the elections
commissioner in 1972, we held
such a referendum to determine
whether the Indian was to be in
or out. A not so surprising 60
percent of those who voted
wished to retain the Indian and
over 10 percent of the remaining
40 percent didn't care to cast
their votes in protest of such a
waste of time.
Minority rights
I agree that the majority
should not abuse the rights of the
minority on this or any other
issue.but why shouldthe major
ity allow itself to be pushed
around by a small and overly
vocal minority?
The majority seems to be most

Mike Nilsson

of the Stanford community (in
cluding alumni) who cannot
understand what all the fuss is
about and probably wouldn't
give a damn if it did.
The minority seems to consist
of two distinct factions. On one
side we have a solid group of
nostalgic alumni and students
who have fond memories of Pr
ince Lightfoot, the band playing
"Redskin," we have a group of
neophytic individuals with
guilty liberal consciences. The
latter are the ones who leave
movie theaters outraged after se
eing the very popular films de
picting cruel white bastards
cheating and killing Indians to
satisfy their greed for land and
wealth.
They are content knowing
they don't do anything like their
ancestors did.
More attention
We should really pay more at
tention to the opinions of the
group the Indian mascot is sup
posed to be ridiculing, namely
the Native American.
Timm Williams (Prince Light
foot) received many letters from
tribes in the Arizona-California
and Pacific Northwest areas stat
ing that their people would
be proud and not insulted if
Stanford retained the Indian as
its symbol. However, certain de
cision makers have chosen to lis
ten to other groups of "con
cerned," "insulted" and unre
lated people.
