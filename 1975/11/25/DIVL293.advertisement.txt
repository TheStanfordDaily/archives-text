Graduates of this program serve in key
policy planning and analysis positions in
city, state, and federal government, major
community agencies, and research or
ganizations in the United States and
Canada.
The program's faculty represents a
unique blend of academic achievement
and practical exposure to the problems
of government at the federal, state and
local levels. The courses and laboratories
in the program are organized into five
areas. Three are related to specific fields
of knowledge—urban environments, pol
icy-making, and programs and services.
Two are skills oriented—analytic skill and
problem solving.
A key feature of the program is a series
of problem-solving laboratories in which
teams of students work on actual major
policy problems currently facing policy
makers in urban government. Student
laboratory reports have included recom
mendations for policy on urban neighbor
hood health services to a congressman;
