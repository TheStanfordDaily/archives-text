## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
Anthony "Tony" Alexander, owner of Tony's Shoe
Shop on White Flu/a, has "been served with a three-day
notice to quit (the premises) "by the University Hoard of
Turstees via the Office of Business and Finance, according
to Adrian Arirna, assistant to the staff counsel.
Alexander owes the University $874.70 in delinquent
rent for the months of May through November, 1975. His
lease expired this summer and has not been renewed. The
rent tor the shop, located behind the Career Flanning and
Placement Center, is $125.00 a month, up from the 1974
rent of $113.00 per month.
He also owes $129.87 in assessed property taxes and
$137.66 in late land taxes to Santa Clara County.
Alexander received the notice last Thursday, but he
owns his own equipment and has continued to operate his
business in the University-owned quarters.
A female faculty member has offered to help Alexander
pay $1000 of his debt, and a student also offered some
money. But, Alexander said, "I don't want to say (who
they are). I'm still thinking about their offers."
Not much time
"I earn about $1000 a month. But there's been sickness
in my family, and business isn't good right now.
"I'm just working to make the money to pay the bill or
get moving money. Three days doesn't leave you much
time at all to try to do anything." Alexander said.

He has worked at the shop for 29 years, first as an
employe and then as proprietor.
Robert Augsburger, vice president for business and fi
nance and signatory of the letter dated Nov. 19, was unav
ailable tor comment yesterday. However, Arima said that
the three-day notice to quit is the first step in "statutory
procedure" to give a tenant warning of default.
"The next legal step would be to file a complaint against
an unlawful detainer," said Arima. The University can
then claim possession of the shop. If it did. a new shoe
shop proprietor would probably be found. Arima said.
"Various procedures for settlement can be considered."
said Arima. According to Alexander, who has talked with
Director of Plant Services Jason Mavis and Secretary to the
University Frederick Clover prior to and after the receipt
of the letter last Thursday, a settlement is uncertain.
Much discussion
"There were a number of discussions prior to the send
ing of the letter," said Mavis. "I don't feel free to disclose
what went on in them, as it's his (Alexander's) personal
business."
If he is evicted, Alexander said, "I'd have no other place
to go. This may force my wife to go back to work."
Alexander's wife, who was hospitalized in 1973,1974 and
for three months this summer, also repairs shoes. The
University will not be responsible for relocating Alexan
der, Arima said.

get moving money. Three days doesn't leave you much
time at all to try to do anything." Alexander said.

He has worked at the shop for 29 years, first as an
employe and then as proprietor.
Robert Augsburger, vice president for business and fi
nance and signatory of the letter dated Nov. 19, was unav
ailable tor comment yesterday. However, Arima said that
the three-day notice to quit is the first step in "statutory
procedure" to give a tenant warning of default.
"The next legal step would be to file a complaint against
an unlawful detainer," said Arima. The University can
then claim possession of the shop. If it did. a new shoe
shop proprietor would probably be found. Arima said.
"Various procedures for settlement can be considered."
said Arima. According to Alexander, who has talked with
Director of Plant Services Jason Mavis and Secretary to the
University Frederick Clover prior to and after the receipt
of the letter last Thursday, a settlement is uncertain.
Much discussion
"There were a number of discussions prior to the send
ing of the letter," said Mavis. "I don't feel free to disclose
what went on in them, as it's his (Alexander's) personal
business."
If he is evicted, Alexander said, "I'd have no other place
to go. This may force my wife to go back to work."
Alexander's wife, who was hospitalized in 1973,1974 and
for three months this summer, also repairs shoes. The
University will not be responsible for relocating Alexan
der, Arima said.
