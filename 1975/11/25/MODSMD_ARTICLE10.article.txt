# Library catalogue staff harrassed
## 
### 
(First of two parts)
There are areas of the Univer
sity where few outsiders penet
rate.
One of them is the Main
Library's Catalogue Department,
where books are prepared for the
reader's use. It is barred from the
eyes of the curious by signs read
ing "staff only."
What goes on behind those
closed doors, however, may be of
interest to faculty, students and
others who work in a community
presumably dedicated to human
and intellectual values.
Over 50 people work in this
department, the library's largest.
Most of them are women, almost
half of them professional lib
rarians and all are dedicated to
the service of the University.
It is exacting work that often
requires considerable erudition,
capacities for research and intel
lectual curiosity. It is work that
calls for able and understanding
coordination, collegial coopera
tion and responsibly exercised
freedom from petty harrassment
— all lamentably absent from
our department.
Liberties curtailed
Small but important human
comforts and liberties are cur
tailed. Insulting and demeaning
procedures are imposed on the
staff, who often feel they are in a
penal colony, not a university
library.
Indeed, several of my col
leagues. refugees from com
munist countries, recently ex
pressed shock that in a country
that had represented freedom for

them they had found, in the
Stanford Library, conditions that
recreated for them the experi
ence of the same repressive and
dehumanizing regimes they
thought they had escaped.
Space permits only a few ex
amples, symptomatic of a long
catalogue of petty insults.
One of our first communica
tions from our new department
head, Larry Leonard, was a
memo forbidding us to read the
Daily at our desks, even during
our so-called "break" time.
'Tardy Slips'
In our department, profes
sionals "late" by 30 minutes are
supposed to fill out little blue
"tardy slips," as they are called
bv Asst. Director Allen Vea
ner (a practice, incidentally, not
only debasing but illegal).
C)ur productivity is measured
in piece-work, that is, the
number of titles catalogued. A
rare 10-volume set involving
lengthy research counts the
same as a pamphlet.
These statistics are, to say the
least, highly manipulated by
both staff and administration.
The quality of our work is thus
measured by a process even a
child would rebel against.
Time studies, or "checks," are
regularly conducted with a di
rective that reads: "Record your
time in 10-minute intervals, e.g.
10. 20, 30, 60, 80, 90, 120. There
are 480 minutes in a working
day."
Enforces dishonesty
This idiocy is an invitation to
produce fiction and. with many

of our other practices, inevitably
leads honorable, otherwise hon
est people to lie, cheat and dis
tort as an automatic part of their
working lives.
Perhaps the most cruelly ab
surd harassment has been to de
prive us of all but one telephone
with an outside line — and that
never to be used for a personal
call, except in cases of
"emergency." Adding insult to
injury, that single phone is
mounted in a room the size of a
football field, an exact 35 inches
outside the ever-open door of
our department head.
For cases that fall short of war
or earthquake we must line up at
a distant, very public pay phone.
The cost is several dollars in staff
time for a call that would other
wise cost Stanford only five
cents and an immeasurably
heavy toll in staff morale.
Refusal to communicate
One of the most frustrating as
pects of all this, which prompts
my column to the Daily, is our
administrators' intransigent re
fusal to communicate with their
staff — their own colleagues.
They meet with silence and re
buff all attempts at finding
reasonable solutions.
Their actions are divisive, and
we have learned that the cost of
speaking out may be high.
We are not unanimous, and
our views span the range from
those of us who write, in effect:
"Dear Boss. 1 just love it under
these conditions, and when you
give out the raises, please re
member I said so. Gratefully

Use Giraud

yours," to those of us who see in
all this a painful and needless
waste of the talents, the energies
and good will of many people
who would like to work at Stan
ford in an atmosphere of dignity,
mutual trust and cooperation.

For cases that fall short of war
or earthquake we must line up at
a distant, very public pay phone.
The cost is several dollars in staff
time for a call that would other
wise cost Stanford only five
cents and an immeasurably
heavy toll in staff morale.
Refusal to communicate
One of the most frustrating as
pects of all this, which prompts
my column to the Daily, is our
administrators' intransigent re
fusal to communicate with their
staff — their own colleagues.
They meet with silence and re
buff all attempts at finding
reasonable solutions.
Their actions are divisive, and
we have learned that the cost of
speaking out may be high.
We are not unanimous, and
our views span the range from
those of us who write, in effect:
"Dear Boss. 1 just love it under
these conditions, and when you
give out the raises, please re
member I said so. Gratefully

Use Giraud

yours," to those of us who see in
all this a painful and needless
waste of the talents, the energies
and good will of many people
who would like to work at Stan
ford in an atmosphere of dignity,
mutual trust and cooperation.
(Lise Giraud is a cataloguer in
the Main Library.)
(First of two parts)
There are areas of the Univer
sity where few outsiders penet
rate.
One of them is the Main
Library's Catalogue Department,
where books are prepared for the
reader's use. It is barred from the
eyes of the curious by signs read
ing "staff only."
What goes on behind those
closed doors, however, may be of
interest to faculty, students and
others who work in a community
presumably dedicated to human
and intellectual values.
Over 50 people work in this
department, the library's largest.
Most of them are women, almost
half of them professional lib
rarians and all are dedicated to
the service of the University.
It is exacting work that often
requires considerable erudition,
capacities for research and intel
lectual curiosity. It is work that
calls for able and understanding
coordination, collegial coopera
tion and responsibly exercised
freedom from petty harrassment
— all lamentably absent from
our department.
Liberties curtailed
Small but important human
comforts and liberties are cur
tailed. Insulting and demeaning
procedures are imposed on the
staff, who often feel they are in a
penal colony, not a university
library.
Indeed, several of my col
leagues. refugees from com
munist countries, recently ex
pressed shock that in a country
that had represented freedom for

them they had found, in the
Stanford Library, conditions that
recreated for them the experi
ence of the same repressive and
dehumanizing regimes they
thought they had escaped.
Space permits only a few ex
amples, symptomatic of a long
catalogue of petty insults.
One of our first communica
tions from our new department
head, Larry Leonard, was a
memo forbidding us to read the
Daily at our desks, even during
our so-called "break" time.
'Tardy Slips'
In our department, profes
sionals "late" by 30 minutes are
supposed to fill out little blue
"tardy slips," as they are called
bv Asst. Director Allen Vea
ner (a practice, incidentally, not
only debasing but illegal).
C)ur productivity is measured
in piece-work, that is, the
number of titles catalogued. A
rare 10-volume set involving
lengthy research counts the
same as a pamphlet.
These statistics are, to say the
least, highly manipulated by
both staff and administration.
The quality of our work is thus
measured by a process even a
child would rebel against.
Time studies, or "checks," are
regularly conducted with a di
rective that reads: "Record your
time in 10-minute intervals, e.g.
10. 20, 30, 60, 80, 90, 120. There
are 480 minutes in a working
day."
Enforces dishonesty
This idiocy is an invitation to
produce fiction and. with many

of our other practices, inevitably
leads honorable, otherwise hon
est people to lie, cheat and dis
tort as an automatic part of their
working lives.
Perhaps the most cruelly ab
surd harassment has been to de
prive us of all but one telephone
with an outside line — and that
never to be used for a personal
call, except in cases of
"emergency." Adding insult to
injury, that single phone is
mounted in a room the size of a
football field, an exact 35 inches
outside the ever-open door of
our department head.

rare 10-volume set involving
lengthy research counts the
same as a pamphlet.
These statistics are, to say the
least, highly manipulated by
both staff and administration.
The quality of our work is thus
measured by a process even a
child would rebel against.
Time studies, or "checks," are
regularly conducted with a di
rective that reads: "Record your
time in 10-minute intervals, e.g.
10. 20, 30, 60, 80, 90, 120. There
are 480 minutes in a working
day."
Enforces dishonesty
This idiocy is an invitation to
produce fiction and. with many

of our other practices, inevitably
leads honorable, otherwise hon
est people to lie, cheat and dis
tort as an automatic part of their
working lives.
Perhaps the most cruelly ab
surd harassment has been to de
prive us of all but one telephone
with an outside line — and that
never to be used for a personal
call, except in cases of
"emergency." Adding insult to
injury, that single phone is
mounted in a room the size of a
football field, an exact 35 inches
outside the ever-open door of
our department head.
For cases that fall short of war
or earthquake we must line up at
a distant, very public pay phone.
The cost is several dollars in staff
time for a call that would other
wise cost Stanford only five
cents and an immeasurably
heavy toll in staff morale.
Refusal to communicate
One of the most frustrating as
pects of all this, which prompts
my column to the Daily, is our
administrators' intransigent re
fusal to communicate with their
staff — their own colleagues.
They meet with silence and re
buff all attempts at finding
reasonable solutions.
Their actions are divisive, and
we have learned that the cost of
speaking out may be high.
We are not unanimous, and
our views span the range from
those of us who write, in effect:
"Dear Boss. 1 just love it under
these conditions, and when you
give out the raises, please re
member I said so. Gratefully

Use Giraud

yours," to those of us who see in
all this a painful and needless
waste of the talents, the energies
and good will of many people
who would like to work at Stan
ford in an atmosphere of dignity,
mutual trust and cooperation.

(First of two parts)
There are areas of the Univer
sity where few outsiders penet
rate.
One of them is the Main
Library's Catalogue Department,
where books are prepared for the
reader's use. It is barred from the
eyes of the curious by signs read
ing "staff only."
What goes on behind those
closed doors, however, may be of
interest to faculty, students and
others who work in a community
presumably dedicated to human
and intellectual values.
Over 50 people work in this
department, the library's largest.
Most of them are women, almost
half of them professional lib
rarians and all are dedicated to
the service of the University.
It is exacting work that often
requires considerable erudition,
capacities for research and intel
lectual curiosity. It is work that
calls for able and understanding
coordination, collegial coopera
tion and responsibly exercised
freedom from petty harrassment
— all lamentably absent from
our department.
Liberties curtailed
Small but important human
comforts and liberties are cur
tailed. Insulting and demeaning
procedures are imposed on the
staff, who often feel they are in a
penal colony, not a university
library.
Indeed, several of my col
leagues. refugees from com
munist countries, recently ex
pressed shock that in a country
that had represented freedom for

them they had found, in the
Stanford Library, conditions that
recreated for them the experi
ence of the same repressive and
dehumanizing regimes they
thought they had escaped.
Space permits only a few ex
amples, symptomatic of a long
catalogue of petty insults.
One of our first communica
tions from our new department
head, Larry Leonard, was a
memo forbidding us to read the
Daily at our desks, even during
our so-called "break" time.
'Tardy Slips'
In our department, profes
sionals "late" by 30 minutes are
supposed to fill out little blue
"tardy slips," as they are called
bv Asst. Director Allen Vea
ner (a practice, incidentally, not
only debasing but illegal).
