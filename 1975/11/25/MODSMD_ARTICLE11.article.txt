# Vote on Indian not warranted
## 
### 
Many persons here apparently have yet to
learn the simple truism that the majority is
not always right and does not always de
serve to have its way.
Opponents of the University's 1972 deci
sion to abolish the Indian symbol argue that
the mascot should be reinstated because a
majority of students and alumni support its
reinstatement. Although this argument has
several flaws, it is probably correct that
most students and alumni want the Indian
reinstated.
In a student referendum on the issue May
11-12. 1972, some 1755 students voted in
favor of the Indian mascot and only 1298
opposed it. There is little reason to believe
that another referendum would produce
much different results.
If anything, the apparent decline in con
cern for the problems of minorities during
the past three years indicates that even more
students would favor the mascot.
Alumni opinion
Alumni opinion is more difficult to
gauge. A 1973 poll by the right-wing, pro-
Indian New Founders League showed that
91 percent of alumni opposed the abolition
of the Indian symbol. Only one percent of
the University's alumni responded to the
poll, which was sent to about one-fourth of
the alumni. One can assume, however, that
most alumni probably wanted the mascot
retained.
But those supporters of the symbol who
like to talk about a majority favoring it fail to
recognize that majority support of student
and alumni for the Indian mascot is far less
significant than majority support among
Native Americans for its abandonment.
Native Americans should certainly have
control over the use of their own race as an
athletic symbol. If they find the mascot in
sulting. it shouldn't matter much what the
rest of us think.
This leads to another faulty contention of
those who support reinstatement. They
often contend that the Indian symbol is no
more offensive than is the use of the Vikings

by a Minnesota team or Notre Dame's use of
Fighting Irish as a symbol.
But this analogy is wrong. There are no
Vikings in the world; the culture of
present-day Scandinavians is vastly differ
ent from that of their Viking forebearers.

Use of the symbol is thus no more insulting
to them than use of the "Neanderthal" as a
synonym for "stupid" is insulting to resi
dents of Germany's Neander Valley.
In contrast to these examples, Native
Americans are close to the Indian traditions
that are vulgarized and distorted in the
football game antics surrounding the mas
cot.
If for example, the Cardinal symbol refer
red to Roman Catholic cardinals, Catholics
would rightly object to the mockery of their
religion on the football field.
Yet just because Native American cus
toms appear more primitive than Roman
Catholic customs to many persons raised in
the traditions of European culture, the sac
red rites of the Native Americans have been
appropriated for use in half time shows.
As for Notre Dame's use of the Fighting
Irish, it is essential to note that the symbol in
no way mocks Irish culture. More impor
tantly, the Irish themselves helped select
the symbol.
Native Americans, however, were not
consulted when the Indian was chosen as
Stanford's mascot.
The selection of the symbol is seldom dis
cussed by proponents of the return of the
Indian, probably because it would weaken

their case. First, the symbol was not chosen
until 1930. Hence, it has been used only
during half of Stanford's history and thus
does not qualify as an extremely old tradi
tion.
Furthermore, the symbol was selected
almost single-handedly by then Coach
Glenn "Fop" Warner, so its selection hardly
represented some great groundswell of
support among students and alumni of the
period.
Critics of Fresident Richard Lyman's de
cision to drop the Indian as a symbol of the
University's teams say he acted alone and
arbitrarily. Both of these assertions are un
true.
Lyman's support
Lyman had the support of a large number
of students and the majority of the ASSU
Senate members. A majority of faculty
members probably supported him; even the
New Founders League poll showed that 62
percent of faculty members favored his de
cision.
More importantly, he believed that the
deep sense of humiliation among Stanford's
Native American students at retaining the
symbol far outweighed any momentary
pique that thousands of students and
alumni would feel at its removal.
Lyman thus acted as a leader should act.
He did not base his decision on opinion
polls or referenda. Rather, he did what he
thought was best by protecting a minority
against the unfair attitude of a majority.
Widespread opposition to Lyman's deci
sion does not weaken its Tightness any more
than widespread opposition to school de
segregation invalidated the Supreme
Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of
Education of Topeka.
The decision to abandon the Indian was
sound. Despite the opposition of many —
probably most — students and alumni, it
should not be reversed.

ent from that of their Viking forebearers.

Use of the symbol is thus no more insulting
to them than use of the "Neanderthal" as a
synonym for "stupid" is insulting to resi
dents of Germany's Neander Valley.
In contrast to these examples, Native
Americans are close to the Indian traditions
that are vulgarized and distorted in the
football game antics surrounding the mas
cot.
If for example, the Cardinal symbol refer
red to Roman Catholic cardinals, Catholics
would rightly object to the mockery of their
religion on the football field.
Yet just because Native American cus
toms appear more primitive than Roman
Catholic customs to many persons raised in
the traditions of European culture, the sac
red rites of the Native Americans have been
appropriated for use in half time shows.
As for Notre Dame's use of the Fighting
Irish, it is essential to note that the symbol in
no way mocks Irish culture. More impor
tantly, the Irish themselves helped select
the symbol.
Native Americans, however, were not
consulted when the Indian was chosen as
Stanford's mascot.
The selection of the symbol is seldom dis
cussed by proponents of the return of the
Indian, probably because it would weaken

their case. First, the symbol was not chosen
until 1930. Hence, it has been used only
during half of Stanford's history and thus
does not qualify as an extremely old tradi
tion.
Furthermore, the symbol was selected
almost single-handedly by then Coach
Glenn "Fop" Warner, so its selection hardly
represented some great groundswell of
support among students and alumni of the
period.
Critics of Fresident Richard Lyman's de
cision to drop the Indian as a symbol of the
University's teams say he acted alone and
arbitrarily. Both of these assertions are un
true.
Lyman's support
Lyman had the support of a large number
of students and the majority of the ASSU
Senate members. A majority of faculty
members probably supported him; even the
New Founders League poll showed that 62
percent of faculty members favored his de
cision.
More importantly, he believed that the
deep sense of humiliation among Stanford's
Native American students at retaining the
symbol far outweighed any momentary
pique that thousands of students and
alumni would feel at its removal.
Lyman thus acted as a leader should act.
He did not base his decision on opinion
polls or referenda. Rather, he did what he
thought was best by protecting a minority
against the unfair attitude of a majority.
Widespread opposition to Lyman's deci
sion does not weaken its Tightness any more
than widespread opposition to school de
segregation invalidated the Supreme
Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of
Education of Topeka.
The decision to abandon the Indian was
sound. Despite the opposition of many —
probably most — students and alumni, it
should not be reversed.

Many persons here apparently have yet to
learn the simple truism that the majority is
not always right and does not always de
serve to have its way.
Opponents of the University's 1972 deci
sion to abolish the Indian symbol argue that
the mascot should be reinstated because a
majority of students and alumni support its
reinstatement. Although this argument has
several flaws, it is probably correct that
most students and alumni want the Indian
reinstated.
In a student referendum on the issue May
11-12. 1972, some 1755 students voted in
favor of the Indian mascot and only 1298
opposed it. There is little reason to believe
that another referendum would produce
much different results.
If anything, the apparent decline in con
cern for the problems of minorities during
the past three years indicates that even more
students would favor the mascot.
Alumni opinion
Alumni opinion is more difficult to
gauge. A 1973 poll by the right-wing, pro-
Indian New Founders League showed that
91 percent of alumni opposed the abolition
of the Indian symbol. Only one percent of
the University's alumni responded to the
poll, which was sent to about one-fourth of
the alumni. One can assume, however, that
most alumni probably wanted the mascot
retained.
But those supporters of the symbol who
like to talk about a majority favoring it fail to
recognize that majority support of student
and alumni for the Indian mascot is far less
significant than majority support among
Native Americans for its abandonment.
Native Americans should certainly have
control over the use of their own race as an
athletic symbol. If they find the mascot in
sulting. it shouldn't matter much what the
rest of us think.
This leads to another faulty contention of
those who support reinstatement. They
often contend that the Indian symbol is no
more offensive than is the use of the Vikings

by a Minnesota team or Notre Dame's use of
Fighting Irish as a symbol.
But this analogy is wrong. There are no
Vikings in the world; the culture of
present-day Scandinavians is vastly differ
ent from that of their Viking forebearers.

Many persons here apparently have yet to
learn the simple truism that the majority is
not always right and does not always de
serve to have its way.
Opponents of the University's 1972 deci
sion to abolish the Indian symbol argue that
the mascot should be reinstated because a
majority of students and alumni support its
reinstatement. Although this argument has
several flaws, it is probably correct that
most students and alumni want the Indian
reinstated.
In a student referendum on the issue May
11-12. 1972, some 1755 students voted in
favor of the Indian mascot and only 1298
opposed it. There is little reason to believe
that another referendum would produce
much different results.
If anything, the apparent decline in con
cern for the problems of minorities during
the past three years indicates that even more
students would favor the mascot.
Alumni opinion
Alumni opinion is more difficult to
gauge. A 1973 poll by the right-wing, pro-
Indian New Founders League showed that
91 percent of alumni opposed the abolition
of the Indian symbol. Only one percent of
the University's alumni responded to the
poll, which was sent to about one-fourth of
the alumni. One can assume, however, that
most alumni probably wanted the mascot
retained.
But those supporters of the symbol who
like to talk about a majority favoring it fail to
recognize that majority support of student
and alumni for the Indian mascot is far less
significant than majority support among
Native Americans for its abandonment.
Native Americans should certainly have
control over the use of their own race as an
athletic symbol. If they find the mascot in
sulting. it shouldn't matter much what the
rest of us think.
This leads to another faulty contention of
those who support reinstatement. They
often contend that the Indian symbol is no
more offensive than is the use of the Vikings

by a Minnesota team or Notre Dame's use of
Fighting Irish as a symbol.
But this analogy is wrong. There are no
Vikings in the world; the culture of
present-day Scandinavians is vastly differ
ent from that of their Viking forebearers.

Use of the symbol is thus no more insulting
to them than use of the "Neanderthal" as a
synonym for "stupid" is insulting to resi
dents of Germany's Neander Valley.
In contrast to these examples, Native
Americans are close to the Indian traditions
that are vulgarized and distorted in the
football game antics surrounding the mas
cot.
If for example, the Cardinal symbol refer
red to Roman Catholic cardinals, Catholics
would rightly object to the mockery of their
religion on the football field.
Yet just because Native American cus
toms appear more primitive than Roman
Catholic customs to many persons raised in
the traditions of European culture, the sac
red rites of the Native Americans have been
appropriated for use in half time shows.
As for Notre Dame's use of the Fighting
Irish, it is essential to note that the symbol in
no way mocks Irish culture. More impor
tantly, the Irish themselves helped select
the symbol.
Native Americans, however, were not
consulted when the Indian was chosen as
Stanford's mascot.
The selection of the symbol is seldom dis
cussed by proponents of the return of the
Indian, probably because it would weaken

their case. First, the symbol was not chosen
until 1930. Hence, it has been used only
during half of Stanford's history and thus
does not qualify as an extremely old tradi
tion.
Furthermore, the symbol was selected
almost single-handedly by then Coach
Glenn "Fop" Warner, so its selection hardly
represented some great groundswell of
support among students and alumni of the
period.
Critics of Fresident Richard Lyman's de
cision to drop the Indian as a symbol of the
University's teams say he acted alone and
arbitrarily. Both of these assertions are un
true.
Lyman's support
Lyman had the support of a large number
of students and the majority of the ASSU
Senate members. A majority of faculty
members probably supported him; even the
New Founders League poll showed that 62
percent of faculty members favored his de
cision.
More importantly, he believed that the
deep sense of humiliation among Stanford's
Native American students at retaining the
symbol far outweighed any momentary
pique that thousands of students and
alumni would feel at its removal.
