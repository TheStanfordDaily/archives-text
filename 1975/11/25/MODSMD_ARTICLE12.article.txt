Mascot vote

Editor:
ASSU Sen. Bruce Reznick
recently commented that "there
are some things that are not sub
ject to the democratic process;
some rights are inalienable, such
as the right not to be made fun
of."
If that statement is indicative
ot the latest senate debate, then
that somewhat less-than-august
body deserved Sen. Dan
Livingston's retort th.it the
senate's resolution reflected
"the elitism and arrogance of
people who don't think the stu
dent body knows what it is talk
ing about."
Reznick's statement repres
ents a frightening rationale
which logically extends itself to
the imposition of values on those
people whose values are not
deemed "proper."Though 1 will
not deny the senate's right to
state its position through resolu
tion. 1 do disagree with its re
fusal to allow the student body to
voice its opinion oil crucial is
sues.
To wit: if the mascot issue is to
be settled, let it be retired by a
decisive vote of the student
body.
If, as seems to be Reznick's
implication, the Stanford stu
dents should not be allowed to
vote because they are not capa
ble of exercising their franchise
in a responsible, intelligent
manner, then I argue that there is
not a group in society that can be
allowed its franchise.
The senate should not be argu
ing the merits of whether
to let the student body vote.
Rather it should be finding
ways to get the student body to
participate in voting. Given a
large turnout at the polls and the
continued intelligent arguments
of those who have been articulat
ing the issues both in the Daily
and around campus, the right
and proper conclusion will
emerge.

Indian logic
Editor:
As a first year graduate stu
dent, I have viewed the current
debate on the school "mascot"
with a mixture of amusement
and bewilderment.
The logic used in rejecting In
dians as the name for the
school's athletic teams seems
obscure at best. While the origi
nal caricature of the Indian
could be viewed as demeaning,
the revision of the Indian to a
tribal chief certainly cannot.
Do the Native American mem
bers of the student body also ob
ject to the NBA champion Gol
den State Warriors? Perhaps if
Stanford football teams were
consistently ranked in the na
tional Top 10, the name Indian
would be viewed by the dissi
dent population in a different
light.
At any rate, if the reasons for
rejecting the name Indian are
valid, then 1 could hardly blame
the Roman Catholic segment of
the student population if it be
came incensed over the current
name Cardinal,as it obviously is
demeaning to an important seg
ment of Roman Catholic clergy
