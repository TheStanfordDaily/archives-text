## The 						Fred Harris campaign: Populism in a Winnebago 
### MARK FUNK 
Citizens should know by Jan. 12 if a candidate who has toured America in a
Winnebago camper can win delegates to a national convention. On that date,
Democrat Fred Harris, who calls himself the "people's" candidate for President,
will see how the people of lowa received his unorthodox campaign style during a
tour through the state.
Harris has barnstormed across the country in a camper with his wife and daugh
ter, starting at Washington,D.C.,(where these pictures were taken) and finishing in
San Francisco. In between, he worked the kankakees, the Decators and the Debu
ques of middle America — places where the more traditional presidential candi
dates usually do not stop — in order to gain support for his candidacy and populist
viewpoints.
"The last time we had a citizen president was Harry Truman,".the former Ok
lahoma senator told a crowd in Dubuque, lovva. "It's about time we had another
one." And when somebody asked him about the style of his campaign, Harris said.
"And if you're going to be a citizen president, you'd better start out being a citizen
candidate."
