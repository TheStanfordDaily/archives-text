The focus of my concern is (he humble shoe repair shop on cam
pus. which seems to charge not so humble prices. Asa laiv student,
1 spend countless hours pacing through library stacks, and my
shoes wear out in no time at all. Recently 1 had a pair of ordinary
shoes re-heeled ivith rubber heels and no special work. When J
picked up the shoes I was charged $5 - no tax, no receipt. I paid my
fiver, thinking that it seemed a bit steep, and as I walked away from
the shop, I overheard one man tell the other, "1 got five dollars for
that one!" Was I ripped off, or am I just not in tune with the latest
trends in inflation? Couldn't the University ask the shop to post a
standard price list, or at least a prominent sign saying "Caveat
Emptor"? -R.S.S.
The University can and will. Jason Mavis, director of Plant Ser
vices, said that his office can make suggestions to the legal staff in
the Office of Business and Finance (which draws it up) about the
terms of the lease for the shoe shop, and will be happy to insist on a
price list. Incidentally, the lease, which is renewed annually, ex
pired during the summer, so your request may be granted sooner
than you think.
However, we don't think you were ripped off too much. Re
heeling prices in this area range from $4.25 to $5.50. Ironically,
though, the $4.25 price was quoted to us by the good old campus
shoe shop.

about evacuation plans in case of a nuclear reactor accident in
Sacramento. There is a document which covers all evacuation
procedures for California nuclear power plants. It is entitled "State
of California Nuclear Power Plant Emergency Response Plan" and
is available from the Energy Information Center on Panama Street.
