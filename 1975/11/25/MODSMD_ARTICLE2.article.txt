# Chile captive Flores offered post here

### JANICE BRESSLER 
Fernando Flores, a former Chilean
cabinet minister held captive by that
nation's military junta, has been of
fered a research associate's position
here in computer science and opera
tions research.
Imprisoned since the September,
1973, coup in which Marxist President
Salvador Allende was assassinated,
Flores is the only officer of the Allende
cabinet remaining in Chile.
He is also a noted computer scientist
and developed a computer based
economic information system for the
entire Chilean economy.
"It is a great loss to the world for the
profession skills of an accomplished
scientist to be wasted behind prison
walls," said Computer Science De
partment Chairman Robert Floyd.
Floyd, who has been working to free
Flores since last winter, said the
Chilean government has made no di
rect response to University expres
sions of interest in Flores' release.
No release
The State Department has reported
Chile does not intend to release Flores,
although he has been offered a U.S.
visa.
In a letter to Floyd, Herman
Schwember, recently in prison with
Flores and now in London, wrote that
the existing Chilean government has
made every effort to bring charges
against Flores but has not yet suc
ceeded.
Schwember said Flores has been
"thoroughly investigated concerning
his political, economic and adminis
trative responsibilities: his tax situa
tion and his family life have been
closely scrutinized and so far nothing
has proved that he might have commit
ted any crime." Flores, 32, is married
and the father of fivechildren.
Sally Lilienthal, national secretary
of Amnesty International, a world

wide organization seeking freedom for
political prisoners, said that the junta
is presently attempting to charge
Flores with having armed insurgents
over the past two years. "This is ab
surd," Lilienthal commented, "as
Flores has been in prison for the past
two years."
A distinguished attorney has volun
teered to try to visit Flores in Chile and
learn firsthand the government's in
tentions in his case.
Situation urgent
"I think the situation is urgent,"
Floyd said. "Reports from recent fel
low prisoners indicate that Flores is
being mistreated and isbegining to de
spair." He is being held at Tres Alamos
prison near Santiago.
Floyd added that he fears "the pos
sibility of Flores being tried in a secret
military tribunal. Such tribunals repu
tedly lack the legal protestions tradi
tional in Chilean civil court."

walls," said Computer Science De
partment Chairman Robert Floyd.
Floyd, who has been working to free
Flores since last winter, said the
Chilean government has made no di
rect response to University expres
sions of interest in Flores' release.
No release
The State Department has reported
Chile does not intend to release Flores,
although he has been offered a U.S.
visa.
In a letter to Floyd, Herman
Schwember, recently in prison with
Flores and now in London, wrote that
the existing Chilean government has
made every effort to bring charges
against Flores but has not yet suc
ceeded.
Schwember said Flores has been
"thoroughly investigated concerning
his political, economic and adminis
trative responsibilities: his tax situa
tion and his family life have been
closely scrutinized and so far nothing
has proved that he might have commit
ted any crime." Flores, 32, is married
and the father of fivechildren.
Sally Lilienthal, national secretary
of Amnesty International, a world

wide organization seeking freedom for
political prisoners, said that the junta
is presently attempting to charge
Flores with having armed insurgents
over the past two years. "This is ab
surd," Lilienthal commented, "as
Flores has been in prison for the past
two years."
A distinguished attorney has volun
teered to try to visit Flores in Chile and
learn firsthand the government's in
tentions in his case.
Situation urgent
"I think the situation is urgent,"
Floyd said. "Reports from recent fel
low prisoners indicate that Flores is
being mistreated and isbegining to de
spair." He is being held at Tres Alamos
prison near Santiago.
Floyd added that he fears "the pos
sibility of Flores being tried in a secret
military tribunal. Such tribunals repu
tedly lack the legal protestions tradi
tional in Chilean civil court."
