## Orchestra: it's a treat 
### RICHARD CROSS 
The Stanford Chamber Orchestra proved to a
large audience at Dinkeispiel Auditorium Sunday
afternoon that what Dorothy always says when
she comes back from Oz is true: there's no place
like home.
Musical gluttons who made the trek up to the
Palace of Fine Arts last Friday to hear the San
Francisco Symphony abuse Mozart would have
been happier if they had fasted until Sunday and
then stuffed themselves on the Chamber
Orchestra's excellent and ambitious bill of fair.
Conductor Mark Starr chose an unusual and
difficult program for his Orchestra. Without ques
tion, Handel's "Concerto Crosso, Op. fi, No. 5 in 1)
major," which began the program, was the
Orchestra's most impressive effort.
The work was played very briskly and with
great expressiveness. The three soloists — Susan
Freier and Sharon Cooper, violins, and Peter Shel
ton, cello —played beautifully. The ease and pre
cision with which the orchestra played paid tri
bute to Handel's compositional genius.
The Mozart "Adagio and Fugue in

C minor" proved to be harder work. The technical
difficulties of the fugal form occasionally eluded
the capacities of certain sections, but the Or
chestra made up for this deficiency by the sen
sitivity with which it discovered the lyrical and
quintessentially Mozartian character of this work.
Samuel Barber's "knoxville Summer" was a
delight indeed. Soprano Helene Joseph-Weil sang
admirably and rendered James Agee's libretto in
telligently. The Orchestra performed the moody,
chatoyant instrumental complement to her solo
ably and energetically.
The Brahms "Serenade, Op. 6 in A major" for
string ensemble(minus violins) and woodwind
choir was the least satisfying result of the after
noon. A lack of rapport between the woodwinds
and strings precluded an elastic and lyrical in
terpretation of this work.
All things considered, the Chamber Orchestra's
performance augurs well. Musical epicures will
not want to overlook their next performance.
