# 'Chappie': a few laughs
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Trying to explain the humor in
the November issue of the
Chaparral, one of its con
tributors said "the biggest laugh
is that peopleare paying 25 cents
for it."
He was being overly cynical.
There are some other big laughs
in the Chappie. But parts of the
issue are only a little more enter
taining than last quarter's Time
Schedule.
Some of the articles are
anemic re-writes of jokes we've
all heard by now.
Others try so hard to match the
Motional Lampoon's brand of
gross humor that they end up
being an unfunny string of re
pulsive images.
Mechanization?
Part of the problem is the
issue's theme, "mechanization."
It's the kind of theme you'd ex
pect to encounter during half
time at a USC" game. And it does
take a little extra to come up with
machine jokes.
Particularly stale offerings in
clude an editorial calling for
cancellation of the Big Came in
order to reduce pollution. Fine,
except that a pioneering pur
veyor of sarcasm, the Palo Alto
Times, ran a nearly identical
editorial two days before the
November issue came out.
In case some readers didn't
have any wise-asses in their
eighth grade history classes, an
article on the history of
mechanization suggests mixing
vermouth with Eli Whitney's
cotton gin to make a martini.
Hee-haw!
The magazine is partly re

deemed by a bawdy rewrite of
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar,
done by Koy Skogstrom. What
was a tragedy has become a
hilarious string of remarks about
sexual inadequacy.
At one point Cleopatra tells
Mark Antony:
Oh Antony thou wouldst be
sure a pleaser
Wert thou to have a column
such us Caesar
Alas, before thy core a
pinhole go pes!
At orgies thou are sent to
get the grapes
Skogstrum has also tucked in
subtle puns like naming a
character Euripides Phartz and
these surface on re-reading.
The other article that makes an
effort to justify the Chaparral's
price is a racist parody of a
Danny Dunn story. In it, the
clean-cut whiz kid is now under
the tutelage of William Schock
ley (inventor of the resistor).
Hauling slag
Accused of being racist.
Danny retorts "There are a lot of
dumb white people too. and 1
can't see why society tries to
educate them when they could

be hauling slag somewhere, or
donating their livers to an organ
bank."
An article entitled "Once
Around the Quadraplegic" fea
tures a picture of a man with two
artificial limbs writhing on the
ground. A balloon above his
head reads "Get the oil can again
Marge!"
Another story, by "Tom
McKill," tells of testing a Mes
serschmit Roland rocket firing
unit, by blowing up a busload of
illegal aliens.
Gross? For sure. Redeemingly
so? Be serious. Instead of being
appealingly absurd, these stories
sound like they were culled from
a wire service.
Fake letters and ads, usually
the best part of a humor
magazine, are only fair in the
Chap a rral.
Legitimate ads are the key to
the issue. With over 12 pages of
ads, the issue paid for itself be
fore a single copy was sold.
Considering ail the problems
with the "humor" in the
November issue, one hopes that
the biggest laughs in upcoming
issues won't be inside jokes.

Trying to explain the humor in
the November issue of the
Chaparral, one of its con
tributors said "the biggest laugh
is that peopleare paying 25 cents
for it."
He was being overly cynical.
There are some other big laughs
in the Chappie. But parts of the
issue are only a little more enter
taining than last quarter's Time
Schedule.
Some of the articles are
anemic re-writes of jokes we've
all heard by now.
Others try so hard to match the
Motional Lampoon's brand of
gross humor that they end up
being an unfunny string of re
pulsive images.
Mechanization?
Part of the problem is the
issue's theme, "mechanization."
It's the kind of theme you'd ex
pect to encounter during half
time at a USC" game. And it does
take a little extra to come up with
machine jokes.
Particularly stale offerings in
clude an editorial calling for
cancellation of the Big Came in
order to reduce pollution. Fine,
except that a pioneering pur
veyor of sarcasm, the Palo Alto
Times, ran a nearly identical
editorial two days before the
November issue came out.
In case some readers didn't
have any wise-asses in their
eighth grade history classes, an
article on the history of
mechanization suggests mixing
vermouth with Eli Whitney's
cotton gin to make a martini.
Hee-haw!
The magazine is partly re

deemed by a bawdy rewrite of
Shakespeare's Julius Caesar,
done by Koy Skogstrom. What
was a tragedy has become a
hilarious string of remarks about
sexual inadequacy.
At one point Cleopatra tells
Mark Antony:
Oh Antony thou wouldst be
sure a pleaser
Wert thou to have a column
such us Caesar
Alas, before thy core a
pinhole go pes!
At orgies thou are sent to
get the grapes
Skogstrum has also tucked in
subtle puns like naming a
character Euripides Phartz and
these surface on re-reading.
The other article that makes an
effort to justify the Chaparral's
price is a racist parody of a
Danny Dunn story. In it, the
clean-cut whiz kid is now under
the tutelage of William Schock
ley (inventor of the resistor).
Hauling slag
Accused of being racist.
Danny retorts "There are a lot of
dumb white people too. and 1
can't see why society tries to
educate them when they could

be hauling slag somewhere, or
donating their livers to an organ
bank."
An article entitled "Once
Around the Quadraplegic" fea
tures a picture of a man with two
artificial limbs writhing on the
ground. A balloon above his
head reads "Get the oil can again
Marge!"
Another story, by "Tom
McKill," tells of testing a Mes
serschmit Roland rocket firing
unit, by blowing up a busload of
illegal aliens.
Gross? For sure. Redeemingly
so? Be serious. Instead of being
appealingly absurd, these stories
sound like they were culled from
a wire service.
Fake letters and ads, usually
the best part of a humor
magazine, are only fair in the
Chap a rral.
Legitimate ads are the key to
the issue. With over 12 pages of
ads, the issue paid for itself be
fore a single copy was sold.
Considering ail the problems
with the "humor" in the
November issue, one hopes that
the biggest laughs in upcoming
issues won't be inside jokes.
