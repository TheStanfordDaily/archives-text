# Tommy & Dickie: like old times

### RON BECK 
SAN CARLOS—Except for the grey hair on the younger brother,
and a lot less hair on the elder, watching the Smothers Brothers
perform during their three-day run at the Circle Star Theatre last
weekend was exactly like watching Sunday night television over
six years ago.
The patter was still the same, the props hadn't changed, and
the brothers were just as funny as they used to be. It was an unex
pected surprise, however, because they've had some rough times
recently. The combo's attempted return to TV failed miserably last
summer, and a recent engagement in Las Vegas was allegedly
canceled by dissatisfied hotel management.
But the pair went to what they do best, and parleyed Tom's subtle
humor with Dick's straight responses into a fairly tight hour and a
half of comedy
"My brother is a member of our family through artificial anima
tion," explained Tom, always playing the role of the jealous sibling
("Mother always liked you best").
Tom's intentionally screwed-up malapropisms and out-of-tune
singing led the pair into a selection of some of their finest skits.
Anyone who remembers the ill-fated CBS series that ran from
1966-69 will be familiar with the guitar and string-bass skits that
work so well for the brothers.
The Smothers pair is still rather bitter about the cancellation
("All the anguish is gone. We got really uptight, but now we're
more mellow and laid back. Everything's changed so we can look
back in retrospect and," Tom delivers the line with .1 long pause,
"get pissed off."), but seemed to be enjoying the tour they're pres
ently on.
They aren't slated for any more Bay Area appearances in the near
future, but the San lose natives have a habit of popping up unexpec
tedly in the area.
And if they stick to the material that they know is effective,
they're well-worth watching.
