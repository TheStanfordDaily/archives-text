# Stills pleases the crowd

### JEFF EHRLICH 
Stephen Stills gave a trium
phant performance last Saturday
night in Maples Pavilion. And
the surprise appearance of
Stephen's old love-and-hate
musical partner Neil Young re
sulted in a fine show that would
make any Buffalo Springfield or
Crosby, Stills. Nash and Young
devotee proud.
Mark Volman and Howard
Kaylan (Flo and Eddie, respec
tively), vocalists for The Turtles
in the mid-60's and then for
Frank Zappa's "Mothers of In
vention" in 1970 and '71,
opened the show presenting an
outrageous parody of the
rock'n'roll business that required
a relaxed sense of humor and a

slightly open mind to ap
preciate: "Now this is a cheap
little concert, and I'm just a
cheap little guy."
The alarmingly fat Volman is
hilarious in his every stage
move, including Pete
Townshend-type jumps and
annswings on his guitar. The
slightly paunchy and com
pletely grey-haired Kaylan is the
ultimate dirty-old-man of a rock
singer. And much of their mater
ial is sex-oriented.
It seems many a young girl
took offense to Volman's excel
lent mockery of Joni Mitchell
vocals and lyrics ("Oh I've had
Neil and Stephen and David
and Graham and Jackson and
The Eagles too/and maybe 1 can
have you"). Volman also did a
near-perfect David Crosby imita
tion that seemed to goover most
people's heads.
Flo & Eddie treated the audi
ence to three well-performed
Turtles hits: "It Ain't Me Babe"
(their first), "Elenore" (their last)
and "Happy Together" (their
biggest).
Loose and funky
Stills and band opened with a
slightly loose, slightly funkie,
more party-type version of
"Love the One You're With,"
went into a good recital of the
very pretty "johnny's Garden "
and played a fine and faithful
version of "Wooden Ships,"
lifted by Stills' exchange of licks
with second guitarist Donnie
Dacus during the song's instru
mental break.
Stills then got out a banjo and
went through "Know You Got to
Run " and then played a new
song in a bluesy slide guitar
style, "Tree Top Flyer."
At this point the show turned
to gold — Neil Young joined
Stills on stage and they seemed
truly happy to see each other.

They performed "Everybody's
Talkin" (the Midnight
Cowboy song) and another new
Stills song, "Buyin' Time,"
which is his latest American
politics rap. Young exchanged
acoustic leads with Stills, but
stayed mostly in the background
of these songs and didn't sing.
Acoustic medley
Stills and Young concluded
the acoustic set with "Do for the
Others," then an excellent fast
acoustic medley of the rock trad
itionals "Crossroads" and "You

Can't Catch Me " and Stills' old
reliable political indictment
"Word Game" (which he used to
dedicate to Spiro Agnew, but
this time dedicated to Ronald
Reagan — "I mean, can you im
agine that turkey being Presi
dent?").
The show's final electric seg
ment featured with a boogie in
strumental by the band, an in
troduction of the players by
conga percussionist Joe Lala
("We call ourselves the Macho
Guinea Pigs") and a rock song

featuring Dacus on vocals called
"Going to the Country."
In a surprise finale, the group
was joined by Flo & Eddie for the
electric version of "Suite: )udy
Blue-Eyes." Unlikely and unbe
lievable though it seemed, this
was actually quite an approp
riate move, as Volinan and
Kaylan are among the music bus
iness best harmony artists, as are
David Crosby and Graham Nash.
And it turned out to be one of
that song's best live vocal rendi
tions.

In a surprise finale, the group
was joined by Flo & Eddie for the
electric version of "Suite: )udy
Blue-Eyes." Unlikely and unbe
lievable though it seemed, this
was actually quite an approp
riate move, as Volinan and
Kaylan are among the music bus
iness best harmony artists, as are
David Crosby and Graham Nash.
And it turned out to be one of
that song's best live vocal rendi
tions.
Stephen Stills gave a trium
phant performance last Saturday
night in Maples Pavilion. And
the surprise appearance of
Stephen's old love-and-hate
musical partner Neil Young re
sulted in a fine show that would
make any Buffalo Springfield or
Crosby, Stills. Nash and Young
devotee proud.
Mark Volman and Howard
Kaylan (Flo and Eddie, respec
tively), vocalists for The Turtles
in the mid-60's and then for
Frank Zappa's "Mothers of In
vention" in 1970 and '71,
opened the show presenting an
outrageous parody of the
rock'n'roll business that required
a relaxed sense of humor and a

slightly open mind to ap
preciate: "Now this is a cheap
little concert, and I'm just a
cheap little guy."
The alarmingly fat Volman is
hilarious in his every stage
move, including Pete
Townshend-type jumps and
annswings on his guitar. The
slightly paunchy and com
pletely grey-haired Kaylan is the
ultimate dirty-old-man of a rock
singer. And much of their mater
ial is sex-oriented.
It seems many a young girl
took offense to Volman's excel
lent mockery of Joni Mitchell
vocals and lyrics ("Oh I've had
Neil and Stephen and David
and Graham and Jackson and
The Eagles too/and maybe 1 can
have you"). Volman also did a
near-perfect David Crosby imita
tion that seemed to goover most
people's heads.
Flo & Eddie treated the audi
ence to three well-performed
Turtles hits: "It Ain't Me Babe"
(their first), "Elenore" (their last)
and "Happy Together" (their
biggest).
Loose and funky
Stills and band opened with a
slightly loose, slightly funkie,
more party-type version of
"Love the One You're With,"
went into a good recital of the
very pretty "johnny's Garden "
and played a fine and faithful
version of "Wooden Ships,"
lifted by Stills' exchange of licks
with second guitarist Donnie
Dacus during the song's instru
mental break.
Stills then got out a banjo and
went through "Know You Got to
Run " and then played a new
song in a bluesy slide guitar
style, "Tree Top Flyer."
At this point the show turned
to gold — Neil Young joined
Stills on stage and they seemed
truly happy to see each other.

They performed "Everybody's
Talkin" (the Midnight
Cowboy song) and another new
Stills song, "Buyin' Time,"
which is his latest American
politics rap. Young exchanged
acoustic leads with Stills, but
stayed mostly in the background
of these songs and didn't sing.
Acoustic medley
Stills and Young concluded
the acoustic set with "Do for the
Others," then an excellent fast
acoustic medley of the rock trad
itionals "Crossroads" and "You

Can't Catch Me " and Stills' old
reliable political indictment
"Word Game" (which he used to
dedicate to Spiro Agnew, but
this time dedicated to Ronald
Reagan — "I mean, can you im
agine that turkey being Presi
dent?").
The show's final electric seg
ment featured with a boogie in
strumental by the band, an in
troduction of the players by
conga percussionist Joe Lala
("We call ourselves the Macho
Guinea Pigs") and a rock song

featuring Dacus on vocals called
"Going to the Country."
In a surprise finale, the group
was joined by Flo & Eddie for the
