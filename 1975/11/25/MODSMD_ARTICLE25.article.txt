# Urbaniak well-received
## 
### ADLAI ALEXANDER 
The Keystone Korner in San
Francisco was filled to capacity
two weeks ago as Michal Ur
baniak and his band Fusion
3 —featuring Urzula
Dudziak—performed two well
received sets.
Fusion 3 is comprised of Ur
baniak on electric violin and a
new electric woodwind instru
ment called a lyricon, his wife
Urzula Dudziak on vocals and
electric percussion, Bud Wil
liams on drums, Basil Fearring
ton on bass, Joe Caro on guitar
and Tom Garvin on the
keyboards.
The program was typical Ur
baniak all the way: highly intri
cate melody lines resulting in
exciting modal soloing by Ur
baniak, Caro, Garvin and best of
all Dudziak. Urzula stunned the
audience with her extraordinary
vocal abilities and consummate

skill on electric percussion, a re
latively new phase of percus
sion.
The first set started off with
"Chinatown" which is also the
initial cut on the latest Urbaniak
album titled Fusion 3. The meter
of this song is 7/4 but in noway is
it awkward to listen to and its
funky rhythm prompts many
toes to tap despite its unique
time signature.
Next on the menu was "Rok
sanna." This tune features the
vocal abilities of Dudziak— who
won a place in the prestigious
Down Boat critics poll this year.
In this tune she sings in unison
with the other instruments of the

band over an extremely compli
cated melody line without a
flaw.
The rest of the show was com
prised of older intriguing Ur
baniak material.
The only discernible flaw of
the Fusion 3 act was stated quite
eloquently by someone in the
audience: "If you've heard one
Urbaniak song, you've heard 'em
all." Despite the technical skills
of the band they tend to be quite
monotonous in actual perfor
mance. The formula is basically
the same from song to song and
this tends to produce a yawn or
two during the course of the
show.
