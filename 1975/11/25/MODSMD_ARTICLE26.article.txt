France approves work on canal
PARIS — The French government moved yesterday to
start work on completion of a canal from the North Sea to
the Mediterranean, a project barkening back to the dreams
of the Roman Empire under Nero.
President Valery Oiscard d'Estaing, ordering a go-ahead
on technical studies and land acquisition, said the plan
"puts the whole of industrial Europe in direct communi
cation with the Mediterranean at a time when the coun
tries of the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf are developing
and industrializing."
Giscard d'Estaing is going ahead under strong political
pressure and in spite of at least one report saying it will be
uneconomical.
A study undertaken by the equipment ministry, and
quoted by the newsmagazine L'Express, said revenues
from the waterway would cover only 20 percent of the
outlay in 50 years. To break even, the report said, there
would have to be 50 million tons of traffic when the canal
opens, as opposed to the projected load of 9.8 million tons
in 1990.
The plan's backers say it will create about 100,000 jobs
in addition to those coming out of the actual canal con
struction project between Malhouse in Alsace, and St.
Symphorien at the head of the Rhone River.
Warfare continues in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslem-Christian warfare inten
sified yesterday leaving at least 91 persons killed and 188
wounded in the last 72 hours.
Snipers again took up positions in the Mour Tower,
Beirut's tallest building, putting all the luxury hotels in
their gun sights.
Angry politicians walked out of a meeting of Lebanon's
National Reconciliation Committee when President
Suleiman Franjieh and Interior Minister Camille Cha
moun failed to appear. Mortars thudded nearby.
A weary Premier Rashid Karami said he had done what
he could, but "one hand cannot clap alone." He hinted he
might resign unless the private armies of Christians and
Moslems end their eight-month-old civil war.
L.A. brushfire rages out of control
LOS ANGELES — A wind-whipped brushfire raged
over the city's rural northern hillsides yesterday, chasing
hundreds of residents from their homes and creating an
eerie, yellow firecloud that choked Los Angeles more than
the thickest smog.
Gov. Edmund brown Jr. declared a state of emergency in
the stricken area, the San Gabriel Mountains just north of
Los Angeles, where hardly any rain has fallen since June.
Gloomy fire officials said containment was not in sight.
Health officials warned persons with respiratory dis
eases to stay inside with their windows and doors closed
and said students should avoid exercising. A weather
statellite photo showed that the cloud extended 200 miles
into the Pat:ifOcean, pushed by dry Santa Ana winds.
Prison hostages freed
NEW YORK — Five guards held hostage by rebellious
inmates at Rikers Island city prison were freed unharmed
yesterday after officials agreed to demands for improved
conditions at the over-crowded and isolated jail in the East
River.

The peace terms that brought an end to the 17-hour
disturbance, which began Sunday night when inmates
used home-made weapons to seize control of the jail, were
greeted angrily by guards, who declined to identify them
selves in talking with reporters.
"Next week they'll give them the keys," said one. "They
proved they can take this place over whenever they want
it.and you can bet they will," declared another guard.
In the tentative pact, the inmates won amnesty from
criminal charges or prison disciplinary action, a special
panel on inmate grievances, an attempt to ease overcrowd
ing, more relaxed visiting conditions and a periodic in
spection by news media of the fulfillment of the agree
ment.
Mandel indicted for fraud
BALTIMORE — Marvin Mandel, who succeeded Spiro
Agnew as governor of Maryland in 1969, was named
yesterday in a 24-count federal indictment accusing him
of engaging in a "corrupt relationship" with five other
persons.
Mandel, 55, and the others allegedly devised and exe
cuted a scheme to defraud state agencies, according to a
written statement issued by Jervis Finney, the U.S.
attorney for Maryland.

France approves work on canal

quoted by the newsmagazine L'Express, said revenues
from the waterway would cover only 20 percent of the
outlay in 50 years. To break even, the report said, there
would have to be 50 million tons of traffic when the canal
opens, as opposed to the projected load of 9.8 million tons
in 1990.
The plan's backers say it will create about 100,000 jobs
in addition to those coming out of the actual canal con
struction project between Malhouse in Alsace, and St.

Warfare continues in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslem-Christian warfare inten
sified yesterday leaving at least 91 persons killed and 188
wounded in the last 72 hours.
Snipers again took up positions in the Mour Tower,
Beirut's tallest building, putting all the luxury hotels in
their gun sights.
Angry politicians walked out of a meeting of Lebanon's
National Reconciliation Committee when President
Suleiman Franjieh and Interior Minister Camille Cha
moun failed to appear. Mortars thudded nearby.
A weary Premier Rashid Karami said he had done what
he could, but "one hand cannot clap alone." He hinted he
might resign unless the private armies of Christians and
Moslems end their eight-month-old civil war.
L.A. brushfire rages out of control
LOS ANGELES — A wind-whipped brushfire raged
over the city's rural northern hillsides yesterday, chasing
hundreds of residents from their homes and creating an
eerie, yellow firecloud that choked Los Angeles more than
the thickest smog.
Gov. Edmund brown Jr. declared a state of emergency in
the stricken area, the San Gabriel Mountains just north of
Los Angeles, where hardly any rain has fallen since June.
Gloomy fire officials said containment was not in sight.
Health officials warned persons with respiratory dis
eases to stay inside with their windows and doors closed
and said students should avoid exercising. A weather
statellite photo showed that the cloud extended 200 miles
into the Pat:ifOcean, pushed by dry Santa Ana winds.
Prison hostages freed
NEW YORK — Five guards held hostage by rebellious
inmates at Rikers Island city prison were freed unharmed
yesterday after officials agreed to demands for improved
conditions at the over-crowded and isolated jail in the East
River.

The peace terms that brought an end to the 17-hour
disturbance, which began Sunday night when inmates
used home-made weapons to seize control of the jail, were
greeted angrily by guards, who declined to identify them
selves in talking with reporters.
"Next week they'll give them the keys," said one. "They
proved they can take this place over whenever they want
it.and you can bet they will," declared another guard.
In the tentative pact, the inmates won amnesty from
criminal charges or prison disciplinary action, a special
panel on inmate grievances, an attempt to ease overcrowd
ing, more relaxed visiting conditions and a periodic in
spection by news media of the fulfillment of the agree
ment.
Mandel indicted for fraud
BALTIMORE — Marvin Mandel, who succeeded Spiro

Mandel, 55, and the others allegedly devised and exe
cuted a scheme to defraud state agencies, according to a
written statement issued by Jervis Finney, the U.S.

France approves work on canal
PARIS — The French government moved yesterday to
start work on completion of a canal from the North Sea to
the Mediterranean, a project barkening back to the dreams

President Valery Oiscard d'Estaing, ordering a go-ahead

"puts the whole of industrial Europe in direct communi

sified yesterday leaving at least 91 persons killed and 188
wounded in the last 72 hours.
Snipers again took up positions in the Mour Tower,
Beirut's tallest building, putting all the luxury hotels in
their gun sights.
Angry politicians walked out of a meeting of Lebanon's
National Reconciliation Committee when President
Suleiman Franjieh and Interior Minister Camille Cha
moun failed to appear. Mortars thudded nearby.
A weary Premier Rashid Karami said he had done what
he could, but "one hand cannot clap alone." He hinted he
might resign unless the private armies of Christians and
Moslems end their eight-month-old civil war.
L.A. brushfire rages out of control
LOS ANGELES — A wind-whipped brushfire raged
over the city's rural northern hillsides yesterday, chasing
hundreds of residents from their homes and creating an
eerie, yellow firecloud that choked Los Angeles more than
the thickest smog.
Gov. Edmund brown Jr. declared a state of emergency in
the stricken area, the San Gabriel Mountains just north of
Los Angeles, where hardly any rain has fallen since June.
Gloomy fire officials said containment was not in sight.
Health officials warned persons with respiratory dis
eases to stay inside with their windows and doors closed
and said students should avoid exercising. A weather
statellite photo showed that the cloud extended 200 miles
into the Pat:ifOcean, pushed by dry Santa Ana winds.
Prison hostages freed
NEW YORK — Five guards held hostage by rebellious
inmates at Rikers Island city prison were freed unharmed
yesterday after officials agreed to demands for improved
conditions at the over-crowded and isolated jail in the East
River.

The peace terms that brought an end to the 17-hour
disturbance, which began Sunday night when inmates
used home-made weapons to seize control of the jail, were
greeted angrily by guards, who declined to identify them
selves in talking with reporters.
"Next week they'll give them the keys," said one. "They
proved they can take this place over whenever they want
it.and you can bet they will," declared another guard.
In the tentative pact, the inmates won amnesty from
criminal charges or prison disciplinary action, a special
panel on inmate grievances, an attempt to ease overcrowd
ing, more relaxed visiting conditions and a periodic in
spection by news media of the fulfillment of the agree
ment.

cuted a scheme to defraud state agencies, according to a
