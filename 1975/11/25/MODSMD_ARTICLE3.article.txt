# Ford should worry
## Prof calls Reagan a threat 
### RON BECK JOHN ROOS 
Former California Gov. Ronald
Reagan's candidacy for the Republican
nomination for President poses a "de
finite threat to President Ford's elec
tion chances," according to Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall.
Reagan officially announced his
candidacy last Thursday in a move
that came as no surprise to political
observers.
Although Reagan has the potential
to knock Ford out of the race, exp
lained Marshall, there areat least three
reasons why Ford has an edge.
"The pros and the people with in
fluence in the Republican party would
be reluctant to say that they have to
sack their own man," Marshall said.
"They don't want to admit that the
party can't come up with a good man."
Moderate candidate
Second, Marshall said, "The pros
have their eyes on the general election.
They'll want to come up with a candi
date who is in the center of the geneal
populace's way of thinking, not just
that of the center of the party."
Reagan seems to be more conserva
tive than Ford, according to Marshall.
But the country's conservatives are not

as coordinated as they were during
Barry Goldwater's 1964 Presidential
campaign, "which makes Reagan not
quite the shining knight leading a
group of zealots as was Goldwater,"
Marshall said.
According to Newsweek,Reagan ap
pears to have strong support in the first
three presidential primaries: Florida,
New Hampshire and North Carolina.
However, "Reagan will have to win
the first two and make a good showing
in all of the first four or five, just like
Gene McCarthy started to do against
Johnson in 1968" if he is to displace
Ford, Marshall said.
Foreign policy important
"Of course," he added, "if things
suddenly go bad on detente. Ford
would be seen as having been mud
dleheaded, which would give Reagan
more credibility than he's got now.
"But if he lost the first primary, it
would take some sort of foreign policy
failure to save his candidacy," Mar
shall said.
According to Political Science Prof.
John Manley, "None of the primaries
will be determinative.
"Reagan won't be able to topple
Ford before the convention," Manley
said.
Problematic chances
"His chances are problematic at
best. But if Ford should drop signific
antly in the Gallup poll or if the
economy should go in a downward
swing, the situation may change," he
said.
Marshall said Reagan's significant
advantage over Ford in personality
could help him overcome his party

drawbacks. "His strongest point is a
curtain forcefulness about bis charac
ter.
"When LBJ said Ford 'couldn't walk
and chew gum at the same time,' it Was
obviously a gross exaggeration. But
the public does see a little truth in that.
"His campaign seems to avoid
specific issues, so I guess he's going to
try and win on the image of being
someone who doesn't disagree with
Ford but as someone who can do a
better job," Marshall said.

best. But if Ford should drop signific
antly in the Gallup poll or if the
economy should go in a downward
swing, the situation may change," he
said.
Marshall said Reagan's significant
advantage over Ford in personality
could help him overcome his party

drawbacks. "His strongest point is a
curtain forcefulness about bis charac
ter.
"When LBJ said Ford 'couldn't walk
and chew gum at the same time,' it Was
obviously a gross exaggeration. But
the public does see a little truth in that.
"His campaign seems to avoid

try and win on the image of being
someone who doesn't disagree with
Ford but as someone who can do a
better job," Marshall said.
Former California Gov. Ronald
Reagan's candidacy for the Republican
nomination for President poses a "de
finite threat to President Ford's elec
tion chances," according to Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall.
Reagan officially announced his
candidacy last Thursday in a move
that came as no surprise to political
observers.
Although Reagan has the potential
to knock Ford out of the race, exp
lained Marshall, there areat least three
reasons why Ford has an edge.
"The pros and the people with in
fluence in the Republican party would
be reluctant to say that they have to
sack their own man," Marshall said.
"They don't want to admit that the
party can't come up with a good man."
Moderate candidate
Second, Marshall said, "The pros
have their eyes on the general election.
They'll want to come up with a candi
date who is in the center of the geneal
populace's way of thinking, not just
that of the center of the party."
Reagan seems to be more conserva

Barry Goldwater's 1964 Presidential
campaign, "which makes Reagan not
quite the shining knight leading a
group of zealots as was Goldwater,"
Marshall said.
According to Newsweek,Reagan ap

three presidential primaries: Florida,
New Hampshire and North Carolina.
However, "Reagan will have to win
the first two and make a good showing
in all of the first four or five, just like
Gene McCarthy started to do against
Johnson in 1968" if he is to displace
Ford, Marshall said.
Foreign policy important

suddenly go bad on detente. Ford
would be seen as having been mud

more credibility than he's got now.
"But if he lost the first primary, it
would take some sort of foreign policy
failure to save his candidacy," Mar

According to Political Science Prof.
John Manley, "None of the primaries
will be determinative.
