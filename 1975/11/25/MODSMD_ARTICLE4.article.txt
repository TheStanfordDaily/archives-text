# Doctors hear report showing high transplant survival rate
## 
### JAN PEPPER 
The results of heart transplant re
search conducted by a team of doctors
at the Medical Center were presented
last week at the American Heart
Association's 48th annual Scientific
Session in Anaheim.
The Stanford team, under the direc
tion of Dr. Norman Shumway, has
achieved a one-vear survival rate of 47
percent for heart transplant patients,
said Dr. Sharon Hunt, a member of the

team. Thirty-two of Stanford's 90 heart
transplant patients are still alive. The
longest survived for six years; four
lived more than five years after the
transplant.
Hunt said at the meeting that heart
transplants have proven their worth in
prolonging and improving life. "Our
results are now roughly comparable to
kidney transplant survival rates.
"Since survival rates were not very
good about six or seven years ago, it

narrowed down to one medical center
to do research on heart transplants,"
said Hunt. "It appears that heart trans
plants are not the great answer that it
was at first thought they were. How
ever, many problems which were in
surmountable five years ago have been
surmounted," she said.
Infection threat
"The major killer now of our pa
tients is infection," continued Hunt.
"The drugs that suppress the body's
immunity to rejection of the foreign
heart also suppress the body's immun
ity to infection. These patients are
much more susceptible to infection
than you or I," she said.
However, Hunt said the operation
"increases the length of survival in our
carefully selected group of patients."
This group is composed of very sick
heart patients, usually bed-ridden,
who have a predicted lifespan of about
six months.
Another research team at the Stan
ford School of Medicine has found that
people with sleep apnea — periodic
breathing obstruction during sleep —
have abnormal heart rhythms that can
lead to death while they are asleep.
Stanford's John Schroeder, Chris
tian Guilleminault. Kenneth Lehrman
and F. Blair Simmons, in collaboration
with Dr. Ara Tilkian. formerly of Stan
ford and now teaching at UCLA, report
that these irregular heart rhythms can
be completely reversed.
Sleepiness
"The main complaint of the patients
who were referred to the sleep clinic
was excessive daytime sleepiness."
explained Schroeder. "We monitored
their heart rhythms during the night
and found that many have severe ab
normalities of heart rhythm.
"Sleep apnea occurs when the upper
airway collapses, resulting in a buil
dup of carbon dioxide. With some pa
tients. the changes in the nervous sys
tem (which result)cause abnormalities
in the heart rhythm, which can lead to
sudden death." he continued.
Eight of the 16 patients studied were
given a tracheotomy, a surgical open
ing into the windpipe below the voice
box, with a valve which can be opened
or closed by the patients. With the
valve open at night, the rhythm ab
normalities disappeared.
"There is some suggestion that this
may be a problem in crib deaths," men
tioned Schroeder. This possibility
is yet to be studied.
Call sooner
Another study directed by
Schroeder showed that people take too
long to get to the hospital when they
have a heart attack.
"Most of the problem is that people
take too long to call for help or are
afraid to call." Schroeder said.
"Spending more money on improved
transportation is not going to help
these people make the decision to go to
the emergency room faster. It is impor

tant that they be educated to recognize
the warning signals."
Transportation tookonlv 17 minutes
on the average, but findings showed
that (i6 percent of the patients had
waited more than three hours after
they developed chest pain before
reaching the hospital.
Survey findings presented to the
session by Dr. William Haskell, a
physiologist at the Stanford Medical
Center showed that medically super
vised exercise programs for heart pa
tients appear to be relatively safe.
Supervision the key
However, the key element for suc
cessful exercise training is medical
supervision, said Haskell. "A medical
evaluation and electro-cardiogram
should be required prior to the exer
cise. and a cardiovascular-trained
nurse or physician should be in atten
dance who can give immediate care if
necessary," he said.

Br. John Farquhar. director of the
Stanford Heart Disease Prevention
Program, reported to the session that
mass media campaigns can help peo
ple to eat correctly and to stop smok
ing. lowering their risk of heart attack,
according to the second year results of
a three-year study of three Northern
California communities. The results
were "much better than we had pre
dicted." Farquhar said.
Random samples of persons 35-59
years old in the three communities re
sponded most to printed media, suid
Farquhar.
"We uncovered a great deal of ig
norance. such as the fact that most
people did not know that there is a
much greater danger of getting a heart
attack rather than lung disease as a re
sult of smoking."
"I think the results are very optimis
tic about the ability of people to learn
when they are given information in the
right way that will help them to im
prove their health." continued Far
quhar. "I think they trusted our infor
mation coming from a source such as
Stanford, and therefore were able to
use it beneficially."

last week at the American Heart
Association's 48th annual Scientific
Session in Anaheim.
The Stanford team, under the direc
tion of Dr. Norman Shumway, has
achieved a one-vear survival rate of 47
percent for heart transplant patients,
said Dr. Sharon Hunt, a member of the

team. Thirty-two of Stanford's 90 heart
transplant patients are still alive. The
longest survived for six years; four
lived more than five years after the
transplant.
Hunt said at the meeting that heart
transplants have proven their worth in
prolonging and improving life. "Our
results are now roughly comparable to
kidney transplant survival rates.
"Since survival rates were not very
good about six or seven years ago, it

narrowed down to one medical center
to do research on heart transplants,"
said Hunt. "It appears that heart trans
plants are not the great answer that it
was at first thought they were. How
ever, many problems which were in
surmountable five years ago have been
surmounted," she said.
Infection threat
"The major killer now of our pa
tients is infection," continued Hunt.
"The drugs that suppress the body's
immunity to rejection of the foreign
heart also suppress the body's immun
ity to infection. These patients are
much more susceptible to infection
than you or I," she said.
However, Hunt said the operation
"increases the length of survival in our
carefully selected group of patients."
This group is composed of very sick
heart patients, usually bed-ridden,
who have a predicted lifespan of about
six months.
Another research team at the Stan
ford School of Medicine has found that
people with sleep apnea — periodic
breathing obstruction during sleep —
have abnormal heart rhythms that can
lead to death while they are asleep.
Stanford's John Schroeder, Chris
tian Guilleminault. Kenneth Lehrman
and F. Blair Simmons, in collaboration
with Dr. Ara Tilkian. formerly of Stan
ford and now teaching at UCLA, report
that these irregular heart rhythms can
be completely reversed.
Sleepiness
"The main complaint of the patients
who were referred to the sleep clinic
was excessive daytime sleepiness."
explained Schroeder. "We monitored
their heart rhythms during the night
and found that many have severe ab
normalities of heart rhythm.
"Sleep apnea occurs when the upper
airway collapses, resulting in a buil
dup of carbon dioxide. With some pa
tients. the changes in the nervous sys
tem (which result)cause abnormalities
in the heart rhythm, which can lead to
sudden death." he continued.
Eight of the 16 patients studied were
given a tracheotomy, a surgical open
ing into the windpipe below the voice
box, with a valve which can be opened
or closed by the patients. With the
valve open at night, the rhythm ab
normalities disappeared.
"There is some suggestion that this
may be a problem in crib deaths," men
tioned Schroeder. This possibility
is yet to be studied.
Call sooner
Another study directed by
Schroeder showed that people take too
long to get to the hospital when they
have a heart attack.
"Most of the problem is that people
take too long to call for help or are
afraid to call." Schroeder said.
"Spending more money on improved
transportation is not going to help
these people make the decision to go to
the emergency room faster. It is impor

tant that they be educated to recognize
the warning signals."
Transportation tookonlv 17 minutes
on the average, but findings showed
that (i6 percent of the patients had
waited more than three hours after
they developed chest pain before
reaching the hospital.
Survey findings presented to the
session by Dr. William Haskell, a
physiologist at the Stanford Medical
Center showed that medically super
vised exercise programs for heart pa
tients appear to be relatively safe.
Supervision the key
However, the key element for suc
cessful exercise training is medical
supervision, said Haskell. "A medical
evaluation and electro-cardiogram
should be required prior to the exer
cise. and a cardiovascular-trained
nurse or physician should be in atten
dance who can give immediate care if
necessary," he said.

Br. John Farquhar. director of the
Stanford Heart Disease Prevention
Program, reported to the session that
mass media campaigns can help peo
ple to eat correctly and to stop smok
ing. lowering their risk of heart attack,
according to the second year results of
a three-year study of three Northern
California communities. The results
were "much better than we had pre
dicted." Farquhar said.
Random samples of persons 35-59
years old in the three communities re
sponded most to printed media, suid
Farquhar.
"We uncovered a great deal of ig
norance. such as the fact that most
people did not know that there is a
much greater danger of getting a heart
attack rather than lung disease as a re
sult of smoking."
"I think the results are very optimis
tic about the ability of people to learn
when they are given information in the
right way that will help them to im
prove their health." continued Far
quhar. "I think they trusted our infor
mation coming from a source such as
Stanford, and therefore were able to
use it beneficially."

tion of Dr. Norman Shumway, has
achieved a one-vear survival rate of 47
percent for heart transplant patients,
said Dr. Sharon Hunt, a member of the

team. Thirty-two of Stanford's 90 heart
transplant patients are still alive. The
longest survived for six years; four
lived more than five years after the
transplant.
Hunt said at the meeting that heart
transplants have proven their worth in
prolonging and improving life. "Our
results are now roughly comparable to
kidney transplant survival rates.
"Since survival rates were not very
good about six or seven years ago, it

narrowed down to one medical center
to do research on heart transplants,"
said Hunt. "It appears that heart trans
plants are not the great answer that it
was at first thought they were. How
ever, many problems which were in
surmountable five years ago have been
surmounted," she said.
Infection threat
"The major killer now of our pa
tients is infection," continued Hunt.
"The drugs that suppress the body's
immunity to rejection of the foreign
heart also suppress the body's immun
ity to infection. These patients are
much more susceptible to infection
than you or I," she said.
However, Hunt said the operation
"increases the length of survival in our
carefully selected group of patients."
This group is composed of very sick
heart patients, usually bed-ridden,
who have a predicted lifespan of about
six months.
Another research team at the Stan
ford School of Medicine has found that
people with sleep apnea — periodic
breathing obstruction during sleep —
have abnormal heart rhythms that can
lead to death while they are asleep.
Stanford's John Schroeder, Chris
tian Guilleminault. Kenneth Lehrman
and F. Blair Simmons, in collaboration
with Dr. Ara Tilkian. formerly of Stan
ford and now teaching at UCLA, report
that these irregular heart rhythms can
be completely reversed.
Sleepiness
"The main complaint of the patients
who were referred to the sleep clinic
was excessive daytime sleepiness."
explained Schroeder. "We monitored
their heart rhythms during the night
and found that many have severe ab
normalities of heart rhythm.
"Sleep apnea occurs when the upper
airway collapses, resulting in a buil
dup of carbon dioxide. With some pa
tients. the changes in the nervous sys
tem (which result)cause abnormalities
in the heart rhythm, which can lead to
sudden death." he continued.
Eight of the 16 patients studied were
given a tracheotomy, a surgical open
ing into the windpipe below the voice
box, with a valve which can be opened
or closed by the patients. With the
valve open at night, the rhythm ab
normalities disappeared.
"There is some suggestion that this
may be a problem in crib deaths," men
tioned Schroeder. This possibility
is yet to be studied.
Call sooner
Another study directed by
Schroeder showed that people take too
long to get to the hospital when they
have a heart attack.
"Most of the problem is that people
take too long to call for help or are
afraid to call." Schroeder said.
"Spending more money on improved
transportation is not going to help
these people make the decision to go to
the emergency room faster. It is impor

tant that they be educated to recognize
the warning signals."
Transportation tookonlv 17 minutes
on the average, but findings showed
that (i6 percent of the patients had
waited more than three hours after
they developed chest pain before
reaching the hospital.
Survey findings presented to the
session by Dr. William Haskell, a
physiologist at the Stanford Medical
Center showed that medically super
vised exercise programs for heart pa
tients appear to be relatively safe.
Supervision the key
However, the key element for suc
cessful exercise training is medical
supervision, said Haskell. "A medical
evaluation and electro-cardiogram
should be required prior to the exer
cise. and a cardiovascular-trained
nurse or physician should be in atten
dance who can give immediate care if
necessary," he said.

Br. John Farquhar. director of the
Stanford Heart Disease Prevention
Program, reported to the session that
mass media campaigns can help peo
ple to eat correctly and to stop smok
ing. lowering their risk of heart attack,
according to the second year results of
a three-year study of three Northern
California communities. The results
were "much better than we had pre
dicted." Farquhar said.
Random samples of persons 35-59
years old in the three communities re
sponded most to printed media, suid
Farquhar.
"We uncovered a great deal of ig
norance. such as the fact that most
people did not know that there is a
much greater danger of getting a heart
attack rather than lung disease as a re
sult of smoking."
"I think the results are very optimis
tic about the ability of people to learn
when they are given information in the
right way that will help them to im
prove their health." continued Far
quhar. "I think they trusted our infor
mation coming from a source such as
Stanford, and therefore were able to
use it beneficially."
The results of heart transplant re
search conducted by a team of doctors
at the Medical Center were presented
last week at the American Heart
Association's 48th annual Scientific
Session in Anaheim.
