# Doctors hear report showing high transplant survival rate

The results of heart transplant re
search conducted by a team of doctors
at the Medical Center were presented
last week at the American Heart
Association's 48th annual Scientific
Session in Anaheim.
The Stanford team, under the direc
tion of Dr. Norman Shumway, has
achieved a one-vear survival rate of 47
percent for heart transplant patients,
said Dr. Sharon Hunt, a member of the

team. Thirty-two of Stanford's 90 heart
transplant patients are still alive. The
longest survived for six years; four
lived more than five years after the
transplant.
Hunt said at the meeting that heart
transplants have proven their worth in
prolonging and improving life. "Our
results are now roughly comparable to
kidney transplant survival rates.
"Since survival rates were not very
good about six or seven years ago, it

narrowed down to one medical center
to do research on heart transplants,"
said Hunt. "It appears that heart trans
plants are not the great answer that it
was at first thought they were. How
ever, many problems which were in
surmountable five years ago have been
surmounted," she said.
Infection threat
"The major killer now of our pa
tients is infection," continued Hunt.
"The drugs that suppress the body's
immunity to rejection of the foreign
heart also suppress the body's immun
ity to infection. These patients are
much more susceptible to infection
than you or I," she said.
However, Hunt said the operation
"increases the length of survival in our
carefully selected group of patients."
This group is composed of very sick
heart patients, usually bed-ridden,
who have a predicted lifespan of about
six months.
Another research team at the Stan
ford School of Medicine has found that
people with sleep apnea — periodic
breathing obstruction during sleep —
have abnormal heart rhythms that can
lead to death while they are asleep.
Stanford's John Schroeder, Chris
tian Guilleminault. Kenneth Lehrman
and F. Blair Simmons, in collaboration
with Dr. Ara Tilkian. formerly of Stan
ford and now teaching at UCLA, report
that these irregular heart rhythms can
be completely reversed.
Sleepiness
"The main complaint of the patients
who were referred to the sleep clinic
was excessive daytime sleepiness."
explained Schroeder. "We monitored
their heart rhythms during the night
and found that many have severe ab
normalities of heart rhythm.
"Sleep apnea occurs when the upper
airway collapses, resulting in a buil
dup of carbon dioxide. With some pa
tients. the changes in the nervous sys
tem (which result)cause abnormalities
in the heart rhythm, which can lead to
sudden death." he continued.
