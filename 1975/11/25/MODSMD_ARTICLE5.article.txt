# 700 forego food for national fast
## 
### RIV WEBER 
Hundreds of students took part in
various aspects of yesterday's National
□ay of Fasting, which included films,
a slide show and a panel discussion on
the contemporary food crisis.
An estimated 700 to 800 students
with meal plans participated in the fast
by turning in their meal cards. Twice
this number joined last April's fast,
held in honor of the World Food Con
ference in Rome.
The National Day of Fasting, as de
creed by the 93rd Congress, was de
signated intentionally during Thank
sgiving week, "when temptation is
greatest to spend in excess on food,"
the proclamation says.
Seminary Intern Joanne Peterson
and an ad hoc Committee on Hunger
worked with a $000 budget, including
$125 from the ASSU, to organize the
day's activities.
Increased awareness
Peterson cited increased awareness
as the goal of yesterday's activities,
with an absence of the peer pressure
felt by many of last April's fasters.
"Today is the symbolic spearhead of
the rest of the year's activities," Peter
son said. Projected activities, accord
ing to Peterson, include "study groups
in the dorms, a SWOPSI course I will
be teaching on Personal Lifestyles and
Clobal Realities, a Miles for Meals
walk on Feb. 28, a CROP (Community
Hunger Appeal of Church World Ser
vices) teach-in in the spring, and a
possible Harry Chapin benefit perfor
mance in February."
As a prologue to the day, Wayne
Larocque attended the National Uni
versity Conference on Hunger last
weekend in Austin, Texas. His trip was
funded by the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
Larocque. a senior majoring in So
cial Thought and Institutions, de
scribed the conference as "very power
ful," with virtually all colleges in the
nation represented.
Last summer, Larocque traveled
with the Church World Service to the
Sahel, an underdeveloped region of
the sub-Sahara that is struggling with
drought and famine.
Panel discussion
Theday'sactivities concluded with a
panel discussion on the contemporary
food crisis. Prof. Bruce Johnson, of the

Food Research Institute, began tin 1
discussion before an audience of ap
proximately 50 people last night.
"The chronic lack of food cannot be
solved with shipments of food." John
ston said. He recommended a
"gradual, progressive modernization"
of underdeveloped countries as an al
ternative to the capital intensive mod
ernization policies which tend to
"displace labor."
Cooperative for American Relief
Everywhere (CARE) representative
Frederick Shaw, another panelist,

said, "Last year we delivered $5 worth
(of aid) for every dollar given.
"People who give money to
can designate what to do with it,"
Shaw continued.
More efficient
The cessation of "government to
government" programs of donating
aid has added to the efficienty of com
modity distribution, Shaw explained.
Underdeveloped countries of the
Third World have been using inap
propriate capital-intensive techni
ques, inappropriate theoretical tools of
neo-classicism and have been without
the understanding of capitalist de
velopment. said Asst. Prof. Tetteh Kofi
of the Food Research Institute.
Kofi recommends the implementa
tion of a "buffer stock system," con
trolled by a central agency. Countries
may sell their surpluses to this world
agency, and thus move toward
stabilizing the food prices that .ire now
acting as a disincentive to production
in the underdeveloped countries.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy concluded the panel dis
cussion by addressing the ethical
problems of food aid. Describing him
self as a semi-liberal, he said, "the
primary responsibility to act is with
those who are capable of providing
aid." Abernethy's goal is "distribu
tional justice."
