# Language courses maintain enrollment
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Enrollment in foreign language
courses here has remained essentially
constant, contrary to a nation-wide
trend towards declining enrollment.
Figures released by the Registrar's
Office show that total graduate and
undergraduate enrollment in French,
Italian. Spanish. Portugese and Greek
classes rose between the 1972-73
school year and the 1974-75 school
year.
Meanwhile, enrollment figures
dropped for German. Slavic and Latin
language courses in the same period.
Overall enrollment in the eight lan
guages declined 0.3 percent.
Nationally, the Chronicle of Higher
Education reported Nov. 3 that under
graduate enrollment in all foreign lan
guages had dropped 6.2 percent in the
same interval.
Reasons offered
Language department chairmen of
fered various reasons for the success of
foreign language programs here.
Prof. Alphonse Juilland, chairman
of the French and Italian Department,
said, "at other schools, there's been a
large enrollment decline when lan
guages were no longer required for
graduation. But we have the kind of
students who will take a course
whether it's required or not."
Many students will take French or
Italian "in order to get suitable prep

aration to go overseas.
"Another reason we're inching up,"
Juilland said, "is because we have ex
cellent programs at the first and sec
ond year level. A lot of the professors
have received awards for excellence in
teaching at the University level."
Spanish rise
Enrollment in Spanish courses here
rose 31.1 percent between September
1974 and June 1975. Robert Ball, assis
tant professor of Spanish and Por
tugese said this is partly because,
"Spanish is a much more useful lan
guage in the Southwestern U.S.than,
say. German or French."
He added that, "we're getting more
Spanish surname people going to col
lege here, and they want to prefect
their national language skills.
"Plus," he said, "there's an increas
ing awareness of the political and cul
tural importance of Latin America.
Spanish and Portugese provide entr
ances to that culture."
Enrollment in Ancient Greek lan
guage classes here has increased 25.2
percent, although Latin classes have
seen a 5.9 percent decline during the
period.
Return to basics
Prof. Mark Edwards, chairman of the
Classics department, said the rise in
Greek enrollment happened because,
"once the Vietnam business was out of
the way. students returned to basic
things, and classics is the most basic
thing there is."
The rise in Greek enrollment, he
said, "was partly due to the Christian
revival, since there are Christian con
notations to studying Creek."
Edwards also noted that, "we take
considerable care in selecting our in
structors. We don't pass the beginning
language classes to graduate students.
I think this has a lot to do with the rise.'
Enrollment in German language
classes fell 21.2 percent during the two
year period, going from 1725 students
enrolled (highest of the languages) to
1393 enrollees.
Back to normal
Frof. Walter Lohnes, German de
partment chairman, said this drop
should be interpreted as a return to
normality. "For some years, we had
an abnormally large number of stu
dents. You'll notice that across the
country, French usually draws far
more students than German. Well, that
wasn't the case with us."
Lohnes said that "during a period of
declining language enrollment, stu
dents switched from German, which
they considered a hard language, to
French or Spanish, which were consi
dered easier languages."
But he added, "we seem to be bot
toming out. Enrollment in German 1
this quarter has shown a resounding
increase."

"Another reason we're inching up,"
Juilland said, "is because we have ex

have received awards for excellence in
teaching at the University level."
Spanish rise
Enrollment in Spanish courses here
rose 31.1 percent between September
1974 and June 1975. Robert Ball, assis
tant professor of Spanish and Por
tugese said this is partly because,
"Spanish is a much more useful lan
guage in the Southwestern U.S.than,
say. German or French."
He added that, "we're getting more
Spanish surname people going to col
lege here, and they want to prefect
their national language skills.
"Plus," he said, "there's an increas
ing awareness of the political and cul
tural importance of Latin America.
Spanish and Portugese provide entr
ances to that culture."
Enrollment in Ancient Greek lan
guage classes here has increased 25.2
percent, although Latin classes have
seen a 5.9 percent decline during the
period.
Return to basics
Prof. Mark Edwards, chairman of the
Classics department, said the rise in
Greek enrollment happened because,
"once the Vietnam business was out of
the way. students returned to basic
things, and classics is the most basic
thing there is."
The rise in Greek enrollment, he
said, "was partly due to the Christian
revival, since there are Christian con
notations to studying Creek."
Edwards also noted that, "we take
considerable care in selecting our in
structors. We don't pass the beginning
language classes to graduate students.
I think this has a lot to do with the rise.'
Enrollment in German language
classes fell 21.2 percent during the two
year period, going from 1725 students
enrolled (highest of the languages) to
1393 enrollees.
Back to normal
Frof. Walter Lohnes, German de
partment chairman, said this drop
should be interpreted as a return to
normality. "For some years, we had
an abnormally large number of stu
dents. You'll notice that across the
country, French usually draws far
more students than German. Well, that
wasn't the case with us."
Lohnes said that "during a period of
declining language enrollment, stu
dents switched from German, which
they considered a hard language, to
French or Spanish, which were consi
dered easier languages."
But he added, "we seem to be bot
toming out. Enrollment in German 1
this quarter has shown a resounding
increase."
Enrollment in foreign language
courses here has remained essentially
constant, contrary to a nation-wide
trend towards declining enrollment.
Figures released by the Registrar's
Office show that total graduate and
undergraduate enrollment in French,
Italian. Spanish. Portugese and Greek
classes rose between the 1972-73
school year and the 1974-75 school
year.
Meanwhile, enrollment figures
dropped for German. Slavic and Latin
language courses in the same period.
Overall enrollment in the eight lan
guages declined 0.3 percent.
Nationally, the Chronicle of Higher
Education reported Nov. 3 that under
graduate enrollment in all foreign lan
guages had dropped 6.2 percent in the
same interval.
Reasons offered
Language department chairmen of
fered various reasons for the success of
foreign language programs here.
Prof. Alphonse Juilland, chairman
of the French and Italian Department,
said, "at other schools, there's been a
large enrollment decline when lan
guages were no longer required for
graduation. But we have the kind of
students who will take a course
whether it's required or not."
Many students will take French or
Italian "in order to get suitable prep

aration to go overseas.
