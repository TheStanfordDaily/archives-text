## Financial aid 
### 
The Howard Report, an investigation of the advisory
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aids (C-UAFA), has again raised the issue of fi
nancial aid allocation and the charges that scholar
ships, loans and jobs are not distributed equitably.
Serious inequities do exist in the University's pres
ent financial aids policies, and a revision is necessary:
—The total amount of financial aid a student re
ceives should be determined solely by that student's
financial need. Need is the only fair criterion to estab
lish whether a student deserves $500 or $5000 in help.
—Once the University has determined how much
financial aid a student deserves, subjective factors can
be used to decide how that aid is distributed. Students
receive a package which may include a direct grant or
scholarship, loans and a job.
However, the University's current category system
for financial aid distribution is inequitable and should
be replaced. Specifically, the lIA (academic excel
lence), 118 (diversity) and lIC (average) categories
should be dumped.
The University should not reward academic excel
lence by drawing money from the central financial aid
pool.
Instead, academic prowess could be recognized
much as athletic ability is singled out. A program of
independent academic scholarships, parallel to exist
ing football or basketball scholarships, could be estab
lished to attract the most academically talented stu
dents without draining the University's financial aid
resources.
—Further, the University has a responsibility to give
a little extra help to students who come from disadvan
taged backgrounds, whether these students are minor
ity group members or Caucasians.
In determining these students' financial aid pack
ages, the University should take cultural and educa
tional factors into account and lessen, on an indi
vidual basis, the requirement for work during the
school year.
Students from disadvantaged backgrounds, with
poorer secondary education and/or language barriers,
should be allowed to spend more time studying here
and less time working to pay for their education.
The important difference between this recommen
dation and the University's present policy is the flexi
bility to treat each person individually rather than as a
member of a group, making financial aids more equita
ble on a case-by-case basis.
True, the methods for ascertaining the effects of
"culture shock"andhence,for determining the need of
increased direct financial assistance are, at best, hazy.
Thus, the University should study the effects of cul
tural deprivation in an attempt to provide additional
financial aid guidelines.
—Of the present financial aid categories, only the
VLI (very low income) category should be retained,
since it is a category essentially based on need.
