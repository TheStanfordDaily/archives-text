# Zionist wrongs

(Second of two parts)
L'et us see where Zionism
stands in the background of
anti-racism.
By opposing the assimilation
of Jews and non-Jews, it encour
ages the individualization and
isolation of the Jews in every soc
iety. Starting from an acceptance
of racism, it does not fight
against racism as such but only
against certain racists.
And. as it remains at the level
of those against whom it is fight
ing, its option does not go
beyond the limits of racism.
Since anti-racism is an absolute
refusal to discriminate between
Jews and non-Jews, it cannot
help being contradictory to
Zionism.
For the call to non
assimilation is a call to discrimi
nation and in itself constitutes
one aspect of racism. Conse
quently. foran anti-racist there is
no other course but to refuse and
combat the structure of a state
which is based on this form of
racial discrimination.
Escalates racism
By combating racism with ra
cism. the Zionist movement does
not arrest the progress of racism.
Rather it constitutes an escala
tion of the racism.
The Zionist crusade has pre
pared the conditions for counter
crusades of the same nature. The
call to mobilize the masses to
drive the Jews out of Palestine is
the reactionary Arab counterpart
to the Zionist aggression.
It equally deserves condemna
tion. It would not solve the
Palestinian problem, but would
replace Palestinian Arabs with
Palestinian Jews.
Any anti-racist solution
should defend all Palestinian
people against all forms of ra
cism.
One formula
Only one formula can be de
fended from an anti-racist stand
point. This would embrace all
the original inhabitants of Pales
tine and their descendents. as
well as all those who. for what-

Syed Mohammed Tariq

ever reason, have become in
habitants of the present state of
Israel.
This could be realized by the
following measures:
— All Palestinian exiles and
their descendents should be al
lowed to return to their country
of origin.
— The "Law of Return"
should be abolished. A Jew from
the United States has no more
political right in the state of the
Palestinian people than a Christ
ian from Europe or a Moslem
from Pakistan.
— The state should be a secu
lar state with equal rights for all,
irrespective of race, religion,
color or sex. It should also be
devoted to the abolition of
economic exploitation and so
cial antagonisms.
Being an ethnic or religious
majority never gives a right to
privileges or to the limitation of
the rights of the minority. Even
less does it give such a right
when this majority has been ac
quired by a process of uprooting
and colonization.
No compatibility
There can be no compatibility
between anti-racism and the
constitutionalization of the
privileges of a race or religion.
Any solution based on the
above fundamental principles
has a good chance of bringing
peace to the Middle East.
There are two parties in the
conflict. Unless they agree on
peaceful coexistence, the only
way to end the impasse is for one
party to wipe the other out.
Twenty-fiVe years is long
enough to realize that the Pales
tinian people cannot be disin
tegrated by dispersion or
humiliation. Instead they have
gained a deeper awareness of
themselves and their struggle
has become more intense with
time — a struggle which is
bound to succeed.

By opposing the assimilation
of Jews and non-Jews, it encour
ages the individualization and
isolation of the Jews in every soc
iety. Starting from an acceptance
of racism, it does not fight
against racism as such but only
against certain racists.
And. as it remains at the level
of those against whom it is fight
ing, its option does not go
beyond the limits of racism.
Since anti-racism is an absolute
refusal to discriminate between
Jews and non-Jews, it cannot
help being contradictory to
Zionism.
For the call to non
assimilation is a call to discrimi
nation and in itself constitutes
one aspect of racism. Conse
quently. foran anti-racist there is
no other course but to refuse and
combat the structure of a state
which is based on this form of
racial discrimination.
Escalates racism
By combating racism with ra
cism. the Zionist movement does
not arrest the progress of racism.
Rather it constitutes an escala
tion of the racism.
The Zionist crusade has pre
pared the conditions for counter
crusades of the same nature. The
call to mobilize the masses to
drive the Jews out of Palestine is
the reactionary Arab counterpart
to the Zionist aggression.
It equally deserves condemna
tion. It would not solve the
Palestinian problem, but would
replace Palestinian Arabs with
Palestinian Jews.
Any anti-racist solution
should defend all Palestinian
people against all forms of ra
cism.
One formula
Only one formula can be de
fended from an anti-racist stand
point. This would embrace all
the original inhabitants of Pales
tine and their descendents. as
well as all those who. for what-

Syed Mohammed Tariq

ever reason, have become in
habitants of the present state of
Israel.
This could be realized by the
following measures:
— All Palestinian exiles and
their descendents should be al
lowed to return to their country
of origin.
— The "Law of Return"
should be abolished. A Jew from
the United States has no more
political right in the state of the
Palestinian people than a Christ
ian from Europe or a Moslem
from Pakistan.
— The state should be a secu
lar state with equal rights for all,
irrespective of race, religion,
color or sex. It should also be
devoted to the abolition of
economic exploitation and so
cial antagonisms.
Being an ethnic or religious
majority never gives a right to
privileges or to the limitation of
the rights of the minority. Even
less does it give such a right
when this majority has been ac
quired by a process of uprooting
and colonization.
No compatibility
There can be no compatibility
between anti-racism and the
constitutionalization of the
privileges of a race or religion.
Any solution based on the
above fundamental principles
has a good chance of bringing
peace to the Middle East.
There are two parties in the
conflict. Unless they agree on
peaceful coexistence, the only
way to end the impasse is for one
party to wipe the other out.
Twenty-fiVe years is long
enough to realize that the Pales
tinian people cannot be disin
tegrated by dispersion or
humiliation. Instead they have
gained a deeper awareness of
themselves and their struggle
has become more intense with
time — a struggle which is
bound to succeed.
