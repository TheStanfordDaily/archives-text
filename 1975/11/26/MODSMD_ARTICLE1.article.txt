# Debate continues on mascot question
## Prince Lightfoot, Pale Moon may reverse stance on issue 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Prince Lightfoot and Pale Moon,
Native Americans who have advo
cated the return of the Indian mas
cot to Stanford, indicated yesterday
they are each considering reversing
theirstance on the mascot question.
Lightfoot (Timm Williams), a
Yurok Indian, told the Daily
yesterday that hi-s decision not to
encourage the Indian symbol is
"under consideration. I've been
talking with other tribal members.
There are many things to be thought
out."
Both Lightfoot and Pale Moon
(Rita Thielman), a Cherokee Indian,
have spoken with members of the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO) which has vocally
opposed a move by some alumni
and students to reinstate the mas
cot. "I now have a better under
standing of what they are seeking,
and I hope they have a better under
standing of my involvement,"
Lightfoot said.
Lightfoot was a personification
of the symbol for 21 years until its
abolition in 1972.
SAIO member Benjamin Atencio
said his organization and Lightfoot
were divided because of "misin
formation and lack of communica
tion" prior to the meetings.
We have respect
Now, Atencio said, "we have re
spect for what they (Lightfoot and
Palo Moon) say. and we hope they
have respect for what we say."
However. Pale Moon said that
while some Native Americans here
have listened to her views, others
"have shown great hostility to me. I
don't want to be intimidated by
them."

Pale Moon said she will have to
"deal with my own feelings of hurt
in dealing with the Native Ameri
cans (here)" before she can come to
a decision on the Indian symbol. "I
plan to write a statement soon to
clarify some points and to repeat
others," she said.
Lightfoot said that his decision
on the Indian symbol is a difficult
one to make because, "there is no
way to erase 21 years of involve
ment when I performed that service
of being the Stanford Indian. They
(SAIO members) felt that my ap
pearance (as a personification of
the mascot) was agitating. I don't
agree. Many colleges, universities
and high schools in this country
maintain the Indian name.
A difficult problem
"Everyone is entitled to their own
opinions on who is at fault." Light
foot said. "It's a difficult problem,
and it need never have been. I
wouldn't have been here (at Stan
ford) if I didn't think it was all
right."
In a related development, Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Gwen
Shunatona said she had talked with
Pale Moon about possible outbreaks
of violence at the Bonfire and Big
Game if Pale Moon made an ap
pearance.
"There was a personal concern
on my part." Shunatona said. "I
emphasized (to Pale Moon) that at
the Bonfire and Big Game everyone
is having a good time and that there
is a lot of alcohol and that someone
might not know what they were
doing and hurt someone."
Atencio added that the SAIO
wanted to insure Pale Moon's safety
at the Bonfire and the Big Game.

don't want to be intimidated by
them."

Pale Moon said she will have to
"deal with my own feelings of hurt
in dealing with the Native Ameri
cans (here)" before she can come to
a decision on the Indian symbol. "I
plan to write a statement soon to
clarify some points and to repeat
others," she said.
Lightfoot said that his decision
on the Indian symbol is a difficult
one to make because, "there is no
way to erase 21 years of involve
ment when I performed that service
of being the Stanford Indian. They
(SAIO members) felt that my ap
pearance (as a personification of
the mascot) was agitating. I don't
agree. Many colleges, universities
and high schools in this country
maintain the Indian name.
A difficult problem
"Everyone is entitled to their own
opinions on who is at fault." Light
foot said. "It's a difficult problem,
and it need never have been. I
wouldn't have been here (at Stan
ford) if I didn't think it was all
right."
In a related development, Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Gwen
Shunatona said she had talked with
Pale Moon about possible outbreaks
of violence at the Bonfire and Big
Game if Pale Moon made an ap
pearance.
"There was a personal concern
on my part." Shunatona said. "I
emphasized (to Pale Moon) that at
the Bonfire and Big Game everyone
is having a good time and that there
is a lot of alcohol and that someone
might not know what they were
doing and hurt someone."
Atencio added that the SAIO
wanted to insure Pale Moon's safety
at the Bonfire and the Big Game.

Saturday's Big Game. The Band came out in favor of
adopting a tree as the new Stanford mascot.
Prince Lightfoot and Pale Moon,
Native Americans who have advo
cated the return of the Indian mas
cot to Stanford, indicated yesterday
they are each considering reversing
theirstance on the mascot question.
Lightfoot (Timm Williams), a
Yurok Indian, told the Daily
yesterday that hi-s decision not to
encourage the Indian symbol is
"under consideration. I've been
talking with other tribal members.
There are many things to be thought
out."
Both Lightfoot and Pale Moon
(Rita Thielman), a Cherokee Indian,
have spoken with members of the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO) which has vocally
opposed a move by some alumni
and students to reinstate the mas
cot. "I now have a better under
standing of what they are seeking,
and I hope they have a better under
standing of my involvement,"
Lightfoot said.
Lightfoot was a personification
of the symbol for 21 years until its
abolition in 1972.
SAIO member Benjamin Atencio
said his organization and Lightfoot
were divided because of "misin
formation and lack of communica
tion" prior to the meetings.
We have respect
Now, Atencio said, "we have re
spect for what they (Lightfoot and
Palo Moon) say. and we hope they
have respect for what we say."
However. Pale Moon said that
while some Native Americans here
have listened to her views, others
"have shown great hostility to me. I
don't want to be intimidated by
them."

Pale Moon said she will have to
"deal with my own feelings of hurt
in dealing with the Native Ameri
cans (here)" before she can come to
a decision on the Indian symbol. "I
plan to write a statement soon to
clarify some points and to repeat
