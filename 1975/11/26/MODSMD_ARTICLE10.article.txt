# Farewell, Douglas
## 
### 
Justice William Douglas' decision to retire from
the Supreme Court marks the end of a long, disting
uished career.
Douglas, for almost 37 years, has served as the
court's most uncompromising civil libertarian. He has
consistently upheld rights of the individual — a posi
tion all too uncommon on the Supreme Court.
Indeed, with Douglas' departure, the Court remains
composed largely of conservative justices, whose past
record indicates they will take a decidedly more re
strictive philosophy than Douglas.'
We recommend that Douglas' vacancy be filled with
another advocate of civil liberties. Such a voice is es
sential if the Court is to maintain its devotion to indi
vidual freedom.
One person we definitely hope President Ford will
not choose is Solicitor General Robert Bork. Bork's
advocacy of government wiretapping is disturbing, as
it is indicative of his willingness to violate personal
freedom.
