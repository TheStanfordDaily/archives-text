# Indian mascot fans lack logic
## 
### 
Three weeks ago in this space. I analyzed
some aspects relating racism and misunder
standing in the University, and applied
them to two controversies: the movement to
"Bring back the Indian," and the since
ended debate over theme houses.
Unfortunately, attempts to appeal to
people's sensitivity and compassion have
apparently failed. Not only has the clamor
to return the old mascot not died down,
even in the wake of the Big Game disaster,
but it seems to have increased. The unin
itiated observer might feel that proponents
of the Indian mascot had not read the seri
ous critiques of their views.
Take, for example, the Nov. 24 Daily,
which contained no fewer than two col
umns supporting the Indian's return. Before
this week, it appeared perhaps the last word
had been said. Saturday's game and the
newest columns make clear that this is not
the case.
When usually intelligent people refuse to
listen to reason, the only solution seems to
pick apart their arguments — expose the
fallacies, as it were,for all to see.
Marc Harris' column is rampant with
such fallacies.
No obligation
He argues that Stanford's Native
Americans have no obligation to associate
themselves with such an "insignificant"
matter as a mascot. This is true. They could
sit back and and allow others to poke fun at
their heritage, to set their traditions up to
public ridicule.
It's difficult to rise above such a conflict
when it is rammed down one's throat at
every opportunity. Whether the mascot is
an "Ugh" (which many alumni, judging by
their buttons, must favor), or an allegedly
"dignified" stereotype, it remains equally
destructive to a valuable, precious and mis

understood heritage.
Harris calls it "pathetic" that alumni and
students must "surrender something they
treasure so much" as they do the Indian.
How sad. More tragic still, though, that he
would ask Native Americans to surrender
their dignity and pride (which they
treasure) by ignoring such a blatant affront.
Such idiocy climaxes when vendors
hawk Indian buttons and students and

alumni give self-styled "war-whoops," all
to the steady beat of "Redskin." This, too,
should naturally be ignored, Harris would
doubtlessly argue.
Original errors
Mike Nilsson's column, which ran right
below Harris', repeats some of the same er
rors, but also comes up with some original
ones.
For example, Nilsson berates the ASSU
Council of Presidents for daring to "speak
for the entire Stanford community or even
the student body on an issue of such minor
relevance to most of the campus." He notes,
correctly, that only 30 percent of the stu
dents elected the council.
But in a totally illogical jump, he then
points out that 60 percent of those voting in
a 1972 referendum did not wish to eliminate
the Indian, so it should be restored. True
enough (the actual figure was about 58 per

cent), but he neglects to mention two items.
First, the ballot question was worded
—intentionally, no doubt — in such a way
that those with no opinion would vote the
same way as those in favor of retaining the
symbol ("Are you in favor of eliminating the
Indian?").
Second, only 3325 students voted —
about one-fourth of the student body — and
an even smaller percentage than that which
elected the current Council of Presidents.
Lack of input?
He also argues that the local Native
Americain community has not had its say on
the issue, that other's have spoken for it.
While I speak only for myself, I think Nils
son could find,on this pageof the Daily for
the last three years, sufficient refutation of
that point.
Finally, he suggests that satire cease.
Does not the Daily's own cartoonist,
Oliphant, often caricature and lapoon peo
ple, he asks? But this is an unfair compari
son, because although the answer is yes,
Oliphant does it with the clear intention of
stating an opinion, with knowledge and de
sire to ridicule and lampoon.
His final point, that the majority must
always rule, was a defense often given by
defenders of lynching and other forms of
mob violence. If the people should always
rule, then why have police or National
Guardsmen halt rioting when it occurs? Or
why have courts?
Refuting such specious arguments may
seem a trivial rhetorical exercise at best, but
until the supporters of the Indian mascot
become more logical and sensitive, it
should continue.

mob violence. If the people should always
rule, then why have police or National
Guardsmen halt rioting when it occurs? Or
why have courts?
Refuting such specious arguments may
seem a trivial rhetorical exercise at best, but
until the supporters of the Indian mascot
become more logical and sensitive, it
should continue.

Three weeks ago in this space. I analyzed
some aspects relating racism and misunder
standing in the University, and applied
them to two controversies: the movement to
"Bring back the Indian," and the since
ended debate over theme houses.
Unfortunately, attempts to appeal to
people's sensitivity and compassion have
apparently failed. Not only has the clamor
to return the old mascot not died down,
even in the wake of the Big Game disaster,
but it seems to have increased. The unin
itiated observer might feel that proponents
of the Indian mascot had not read the seri
ous critiques of their views.
Take, for example, the Nov. 24 Daily,
which contained no fewer than two col
umns supporting the Indian's return. Before
this week, it appeared perhaps the last word
had been said. Saturday's game and the
newest columns make clear that this is not
the case.
When usually intelligent people refuse to
listen to reason, the only solution seems to
pick apart their arguments — expose the
fallacies, as it were,for all to see.
Marc Harris' column is rampant with
such fallacies.
No obligation
He argues that Stanford's Native
Americans have no obligation to associate
themselves with such an "insignificant"
matter as a mascot. This is true. They could
sit back and and allow others to poke fun at
their heritage, to set their traditions up to
public ridicule.
It's difficult to rise above such a conflict
when it is rammed down one's throat at
every opportunity. Whether the mascot is
an "Ugh" (which many alumni, judging by
their buttons, must favor), or an allegedly
"dignified" stereotype, it remains equally
destructive to a valuable, precious and mis

understood heritage.
Harris calls it "pathetic" that alumni and
students must "surrender something they
treasure so much" as they do the Indian.
How sad. More tragic still, though, that he
would ask Native Americans to surrender
their dignity and pride (which they
treasure) by ignoring such a blatant affront.
Such idiocy climaxes when vendors
hawk Indian buttons and students and

alumni give self-styled "war-whoops," all
to the steady beat of "Redskin." This, too,
should naturally be ignored, Harris would
doubtlessly argue.
Original errors
Mike Nilsson's column, which ran right
below Harris', repeats some of the same er
rors, but also comes up with some original
ones.
For example, Nilsson berates the ASSU
Council of Presidents for daring to "speak
for the entire Stanford community or even
the student body on an issue of such minor
relevance to most of the campus." He notes,
correctly, that only 30 percent of the stu
dents elected the council.
But in a totally illogical jump, he then
points out that 60 percent of those voting in
a 1972 referendum did not wish to eliminate
the Indian, so it should be restored. True
enough (the actual figure was about 58 per

cent), but he neglects to mention two items.
First, the ballot question was worded
—intentionally, no doubt — in such a way
that those with no opinion would vote the
same way as those in favor of retaining the
symbol ("Are you in favor of eliminating the
Indian?").
Second, only 3325 students voted —
about one-fourth of the student body — and
an even smaller percentage than that which
elected the current Council of Presidents.
Lack of input?
He also argues that the local Native
Americain community has not had its say on
the issue, that other's have spoken for it.
While I speak only for myself, I think Nils
son could find,on this pageof the Daily for
the last three years, sufficient refutation of
that point.
Finally, he suggests that satire cease.
Does not the Daily's own cartoonist,
Oliphant, often caricature and lapoon peo
ple, he asks? But this is an unfair compari
son, because although the answer is yes,
Oliphant does it with the clear intention of
stating an opinion, with knowledge and de
sire to ridicule and lampoon.
His final point, that the majority must
always rule, was a defense often given by
defenders of lynching and other forms of
mob violence. If the people should always
rule, then why have police or National
Guardsmen halt rioting when it occurs? Or
why have courts?
Refuting such specious arguments may

Three weeks ago in this space. I analyzed
some aspects relating racism and misunder
standing in the University, and applied
them to two controversies: the movement to
"Bring back the Indian," and the since
ended debate over theme houses.
Unfortunately, attempts to appeal to
people's sensitivity and compassion have
apparently failed. Not only has the clamor
to return the old mascot not died down,
even in the wake of the Big Game disaster,
but it seems to have increased. The unin
itiated observer might feel that proponents
of the Indian mascot had not read the seri
ous critiques of their views.
Take, for example, the Nov. 24 Daily,
which contained no fewer than two col
umns supporting the Indian's return. Before
this week, it appeared perhaps the last word
had been said. Saturday's game and the
newest columns make clear that this is not
the case.
When usually intelligent people refuse to
listen to reason, the only solution seems to
pick apart their arguments — expose the
fallacies, as it were,for all to see.
Marc Harris' column is rampant with
such fallacies.
No obligation
He argues that Stanford's Native
Americans have no obligation to associate
themselves with such an "insignificant"
matter as a mascot. This is true. They could
sit back and and allow others to poke fun at
their heritage, to set their traditions up to
public ridicule.
It's difficult to rise above such a conflict
when it is rammed down one's throat at
every opportunity. Whether the mascot is
an "Ugh" (which many alumni, judging by
their buttons, must favor), or an allegedly
"dignified" stereotype, it remains equally
destructive to a valuable, precious and mis

understood heritage.
Harris calls it "pathetic" that alumni and
students must "surrender something they
treasure so much" as they do the Indian.
How sad. More tragic still, though, that he
would ask Native Americans to surrender
their dignity and pride (which they
treasure) by ignoring such a blatant affront.
Such idiocy climaxes when vendors
hawk Indian buttons and students and

alumni give self-styled "war-whoops," all
to the steady beat of "Redskin." This, too,
should naturally be ignored, Harris would
doubtlessly argue.
Original errors
Mike Nilsson's column, which ran right
below Harris', repeats some of the same er
rors, but also comes up with some original
ones.
For example, Nilsson berates the ASSU
Council of Presidents for daring to "speak
for the entire Stanford community or even
the student body on an issue of such minor
relevance to most of the campus." He notes,
correctly, that only 30 percent of the stu
dents elected the council.
But in a totally illogical jump, he then
points out that 60 percent of those voting in
a 1972 referendum did not wish to eliminate
the Indian, so it should be restored. True
enough (the actual figure was about 58 per

cent), but he neglects to mention two items.
First, the ballot question was worded
—intentionally, no doubt — in such a way
that those with no opinion would vote the
same way as those in favor of retaining the
symbol ("Are you in favor of eliminating the
Indian?").
Second, only 3325 students voted —
about one-fourth of the student body — and
an even smaller percentage than that which
elected the current Council of Presidents.
Lack of input?
He also argues that the local Native
Americain community has not had its say on
the issue, that other's have spoken for it.
While I speak only for myself, I think Nils
son could find,on this pageof the Daily for
the last three years, sufficient refutation of
that point.
Finally, he suggests that satire cease.
Does not the Daily's own cartoonist,
