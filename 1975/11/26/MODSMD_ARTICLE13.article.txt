(Second of (wo parts)
An administration, such as the
library's, that forbids its staff to
read the Daily, makes it fill
out "tardy slips," removes its
telephones and resolutely
dodges dialogue, will force the
spotlight turned upon itself.
Two grievances were recently
filed about the "tardy slips" and
telephones. Director of Libraries
David Weber, to whom the grie
vance was referred for impartial
adjudication, could or would not
deal with it and appointed Asst.
Director Allen Veaner as the
hearing officer.
Veaner adafnantly refused to
admit the 30-35 witnesses and
observers who came— a most po
lite and peaceful crowd — ex
cept in individual interviews in
camera. This is an obviously in
timidating procedure hardly
necessitated by the confidential
ity of the subject.
As Emil Sarpa, director of per
sonnel, told me, it is "very
threatening to an administrator"
to see 30 members of his staff
together like that.
Fear seems to prevail every
where in the Library. While the
staff fears its "bosses" and sel
dom voices out loud the discon
tent so freely heard in private,
the administrators feel
"threatened" by the staff.
They refer to themselves, in
para-military fashion, as "line
officers." and think up ever more
repressive measures toward "the
enemy." presumably their staff.
Their heavy ammunition is their
power to over-pay and promote.
Ours, the Catalogue Depart
ment. has four administrators.
They cost the University close to
$100,000 a year. They do no
cataloguing.
Their functions include rap
ping our knuckles, initialing

our "tardyslips',' monitoring our
phone conversations and ad
ministering our $500,000 a year
catalogue automation program.
This program,in the able hands
of our chief and the gung-ho
morale of our department, has
resulted in a 25 percent annual
reduction in output.
If to these costs are added the
salaries of Veaner and Weber, it
is quite a hefty sum for a univer
sity in sore straits to be paying
for mismanagement.
Our own pay is not so lavish.
The Commission on Lib
rarianship at Stanford, ap
pointed by Weber himself,
studied the situation for three
years and discovered that of five
libraries (Columbia, Harvard
Yale, Cornell and Stanford) ours
had by far the lowest — as it has
among area libraries, too.
All our administrators, of
course, were men until about a
year ago, when a grievance on
sexism was filed against the Lib
rary. Since then, a few female
appointments have been made.
Weber's ideas on affirmative
action are set down in his July 1,
1974 memo to Provost William
Miller: "Over the coming 10
years (we should) raise the 2.6
percent that are presently black
to a minimum of 3 percent ... to
strive . . . for at least 2 percent
with a Spanish
surname . . . There also should
be no less than 25 percent of our
department heads and at least 20
percent of the directorships oc
cupied by women" — who form
80 percent of our profession!
A recent —and healthy— sug
gestion before the American As
sociation of University Profes
sors for the evaluation of ad
ministrators seems supremely
applicable to the Library.

Rumor pegs Weber and Vea
ner in the $30,000 to $40,000
category. If that is wrong, I
should be glad to be corrected.
They should disclose their
salaries.
After all, they know — in fact,
they set — ours. By what right
this double standard? .
We docilely submit to their
right to "evaluate" us, no matter
what their qualifications and the
resulting insult to us, and
meekly swallow the myth that
pay is given on merit. Whatever
the criteria, merit is surely sel
dom one of them.
They have us bamboozled into
thinking of them as sacrosanct,
their perquisites as inviolate and
their actions, no matter how
counterproductive, as justified.

Use Giraud

Conditions have been bad in
the Catalogue Department for
years. The administration has
known this.
It is the custom to keep these
things hushed up — for the ad
ministrators out of obvious self
interest and for the objects of
their mismanagement out of pa
tient genteel convention.
But it is not fair that the vic
timization of many should pay
for the face-saving of a few. What
we are saving, with our hides,
are the faces of a handful of
overpaid, incompetent and self
serving men, little concerned
with our welfare.
I think this is a cover-up we
need not participate in.
