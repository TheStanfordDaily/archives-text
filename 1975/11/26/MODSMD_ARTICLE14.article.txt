Israeli rights
Editor:
Syed Mohammed Tariq's arti
cle entitled "Zionism encour
ages racist acts" is disturbing
because it has some truth in it.
but is on the whole untrue.
There are indeed complex
problems which revolve around
the existence of Israel, including
how much land was bought
rather than taken, the role of re
ligion in the affairs of state, the
treatment of minority groups
and the escalating militarism on
both sides.
And yet the smug warning, to
those of us ()ews. not Zionists)
who lost families and homes in
the Nazi era, that we are even
more culpable is part of the old
game of "blaming the victim." If
anti-Zionism really is not anti-
Semitism, then how can we exp
lain the pressure on large corpo
rations, from wealthy investors
in the Arab world, to refuse to
hire Jews?
How can we account for the
recent decision by Saudi Arabia
to refuse to hire jews, women
and blacks for a road building
project in which it is recruiting
white American men? How are
we to understand Egyptian
threats to "run Israel into the
sea?"
And what are we to make of
relentless attacks on the civilian
population of Israel and other
civilians around the world?
There may indeed be ine
quities in the current situation,
and I am saddened by the
bloodshed on both sides. Yet
where indeed were the Jews to
go in the wake of the fascist
slaughter?
My hope is that Jews and
Arabs will live as brothers. But
the right of self determination
applies to both, and as long as
many Arabs discriminate,
threaten extermination and
practice murder, the fighting
will escalate.

Self-confidence
Editor:
In response to√üichardFearon's
Nov. 24 Daily column on minor
ity admissions, 1 wish to add
another aspect of the problem.
Who benefits from this reverse
discrimination? Certainly not
the University and definitely not
the individual student.
I do not speak from condes
cension, but rather from experi
ence. The University does not
benefit because its standards are
lowered, and following close
behind is its reputation.
The student does not benefit
by being placed among students
that are more qualified to rigor
ously compete in the difficult
Stanford atmosphere. Even
though I am not a minority, there
are times in my classes, listening
to discussions, that I wonder
whether or not I am as capable as
my classmates.
I shudder to think how a
minority student, admitted by
less rigorous standards than I,
may feel.
To give Stanford that "liberal"
appearance, the admissions of
fice is doing the minority stu
dents a genuine disservice by
accepting them into a school that
often seems especially designed
to erode self-confidence.
