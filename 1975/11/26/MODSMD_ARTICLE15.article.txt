# Retain minority standards

### 
Richard Fearon's outrage at
reverse discrimination (Daily,
Nov. 24) only clouds the issues.
Clearly the differential, and
partially preferentia-1, treatment
accorded minorities is reverse
discrimination. However,
Fearon's contention that this
perpetrates an injustice by deny
ing the right of minorities to "be
judged by a common standard of
merit" is naive.
Differential treatment of some
minority groups is predicated on
the belief that without such
treatment, they will be denied
the right to be judged by the
"appropriate" reflect the best of
their potential.
In fact, it has been well
documented that common stan
dards (e.g., standardized tests)

yield biased results for some dis
advantaged groups, causing
members of those groups to re
ceive lower scores.
Differential selection proces
ses for blacks and other
minorities will not mean that
minorities will be considered
substandard unless professors
grade minorities differently
(i.e., preferentially).
If the theory is that some
minorities can do college work
but that they have been denied
the opportunity to clearly de
monstrate their potential, then
even if they require tutoring, the
unbiased evaluation of their col
lege course work will be a test of
their ability (i.e., realized poten
tial).
Fearon did not contend, and I
hope that he would not contend,
that the minorities who attend

Beto Brunn

his elitist University have hin
dered his academic progress.
Indeed, Fearon gives no indi
cation of how well the sup
posedly inferior minority stu
dents have fared in the class
room. Such an analysis of their
academic work is the approp
riate basis from which to criti
cize differential treatment in the
selection process.
Other standards have effec
tively detected students with
large, unrealized potentials and
persuaded the Admissions Of
fice that they are worthy of at
tending Stanford. We should
admit, without a quota, as many
such students as we find, even if
we must provide some remedial
preparation to help them after
they arrive here.

preparation to help them after
