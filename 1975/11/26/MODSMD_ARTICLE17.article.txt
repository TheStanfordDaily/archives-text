## Martial arts here: not quite like 'Kung Fu' 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
Take a cooking class but don't learn how to
cook. Take a skiing class but don't learn how to
ski. Illogical, you say? Practitioners of the martial
arts here claim this is wholly logical.
"Don't talk about self-defense," exclaims Kuo
Lien Ying, a Tai Chi instructor. "The purpose of
the Tai Chi is for you to be healthy. When your
body is healthy, it will take care of itself."
Thus, one takes a martial art, but not really to
learn self defense.
Some of Ying'sTai Chi students say good health
was their motivation.
This "something" within, according to David
Brown, an Aikido student, "is your spirit, your ki.
Your body expresses your spirit and the spirit
grows even when the body fails."
The "knock-out, fight-to-the-finish" martial art
fights that are so loudly promoted today seem
contrary to the gentle, spiritual nature of the mar
tial arts.
Bastards
"Those guys who fight with gloves . . . it's a 100
percent bastardization of everything!" declares
Mike Mcßay, a Shoto-Kan (Japan style) karate
student.
"Thefakes getall theexposureand intimate the
wrong ideas," adds Louis Saekow, also of the
Shoto-Kan school. "Within our own classes, we
tell students that is not what they're going to do.
We want to dispell all this violence."
One reason for the spread of wrong concep
tions, says Mcßay, is that those "who do know the
true art form aren't actively campaigning."
Adds Saekow, "We don't reach vast audiences.
Most of our teaching is through our classes."
Except for Tai Chi, all the martial art classes
involve working, grappling or sparring with part
ners. Such work is not violent at all, the represen
tatives claim.
Learning technique
"Sparring helps develop your technique. You
learn by sparring with a partner," says Saekow.
"Working with a partner brings in the third
dimension," explains F'egelow. "He's unpredict
able so you learn to respond quickly."

"I wanted to practice a sport with my wife. I also
wanted to become more flexible.' comments
Ph.D. candidate. Jacques Rolfo.
"1 don't feel so tight," adds Marilyn Miller ot
Lomar. "If I wanted self-defense, I'd take karate."
Mike Peterson, a Kenpo Karate (Chinese Karate)
student says that while "our style is more vigor
ous" than Tai Chi or some other forms of martial
arts, it's main goal is not self-defense but
'spiritual growth'."
George Pegelow, a Kenpo instructor says all
martial arts "stress basic techniques. We try to

avoid being hurt. We try to escape. To injure or
kill is regrettable."
Hard vs. soft
These techniques are employed in either the
"hard" or "soft" style schools.
"The hard, or external system, emphasizes
punching, kicking, throwing, cutting or using a
weapon," says Brown. "The soft, or internal sys
tem, emphasizes the state of mind, heart and spirit

and is more concerned with directing energy flow
through meditation and deep breathing."
Brown said that though initially the emphases
are different, "both paths (ultimately) merge."
Hard stylists, once they have learned techni
ques, concentrate on improving the "quality" of
the techniques through meditation. Soft stylists,
on the other hand, once they have learned their
internal qualities, begin to "manifest" them in
form.
Aikido and Tai Chi are soft styles, while Kenpo,
Shoto-Kan, Judo andTaeKwonDo are hard styles.

Pegelow quotes a passage from the Daru Jin, a
philosophy book of human activity, as saying the
"inaction or the right action" is what is aimed for.
Bill Laven, a Tae Kwon Do instructor, says the
art "made me more aware of what I really am. 1
learned how to concentrate; channel and direct
my energy. I'm getting closer and closer to that
something within me."
Tai Chi instructor, Martin Lee, says his classes

are split equally between males and females while
there is a noted majority of males in most of the
other "hard" style martial arts. The reason, sug
gests Saekow, is that males like the physical as
pect of the art.
Says Mcßay, "Martial arts are infinitely better
than sports."
Saekow agrees. "We don't try to weed out 'bad
players.' All we ask is that students do their best.
They are encouraged to stay."
Homogeneity
"Aikido is a homogeneous activity," says
Brown. "It's unique in that junior and senior fa
culty. students and staff come together to learn on
the same level. We're clumsy and inept, but we
grow together. Who you are outside of the hall
doesn't make a damn bit of difference."
Sandra Holmes, a student of Shoto-Kan, started
her training four years ago in Hawaii when her
brother who was taking it at the time encouraged
her to "come along."
"In Hawaii, people are polite most of the time,"
she notes, "whereas here, people are different."
Sandra says she appreciates the "courtesy and
etiquette" that is so much a part of the Japanese
martial arts.
"Every black belt I've met has been so good,
kind and gentle. You know they wouldn't hurt a
fly," she says.
School shopping
For the person unfamiliar with the various
schools of martial arts, choosing the school that
suits his personal preference can be done by re
searching and actually attending some of the clas
ses offered on campus.
"People get tied up with words," says I'egelow.
It's a waste of energy. I take Kenpo, but so what?
The word Kenpo can only express so much."
Each of the six schools emphasizes physical
and mental development, increased awareness,
working in harmony with oneself and others and
finding the "essence" within.
"The essence tends to blur (the schools) while
names tend to make sharp," says Pegelow.
But whatever your inclination, each school of
fers an opportunity to find your own "essence."

"Those guys who fight with gloves . . . it's a 100
percent bastardization of everything!" declares
Mike Mcßay, a Shoto-Kan (Japan style) karate
student.
"Thefakes getall theexposureand intimate the
wrong ideas," adds Louis Saekow, also of the
Shoto-Kan school. "Within our own classes, we
tell students that is not what they're going to do.
We want to dispell all this violence."
One reason for the spread of wrong concep
tions, says Mcßay, is that those "who do know the
true art form aren't actively campaigning."
Adds Saekow, "We don't reach vast audiences.
Most of our teaching is through our classes."
Except for Tai Chi, all the martial art classes
involve working, grappling or sparring with part
ners. Such work is not violent at all, the represen
tatives claim.
Learning technique
"Sparring helps develop your technique. You
learn by sparring with a partner," says Saekow.
"Working with a partner brings in the third
dimension," explains F'egelow. "He's unpredict
able so you learn to respond quickly."

"1 don't feel so tight," adds Marilyn Miller ot
Lomar. "If I wanted self-defense, I'd take karate."
Mike Peterson, a Kenpo Karate (Chinese Karate)
student says that while "our style is more vigor
ous" than Tai Chi or some other forms of martial
arts, it's main goal is not self-defense but
'spiritual growth'."
George Pegelow, a Kenpo instructor says all
martial arts "stress basic techniques. We try to

avoid being hurt. We try to escape. To injure or
kill is regrettable."
Hard vs. soft
These techniques are employed in either the
"hard" or "soft" style schools.
"The hard, or external system, emphasizes
punching, kicking, throwing, cutting or using a
weapon," says Brown. "The soft, or internal sys
tem, emphasizes the state of mind, heart and spirit

and is more concerned with directing energy flow
through meditation and deep breathing."
Brown said that though initially the emphases
are different, "both paths (ultimately) merge."
Hard stylists, once they have learned techni
ques, concentrate on improving the "quality" of
the techniques through meditation. Soft stylists,
on the other hand, once they have learned their
internal qualities, begin to "manifest" them in
form.
Aikido and Tai Chi are soft styles, while Kenpo,
Shoto-Kan, Judo andTaeKwonDo are hard styles.

Pegelow quotes a passage from the Daru Jin, a
philosophy book of human activity, as saying the
"inaction or the right action" is what is aimed for.
Bill Laven, a Tae Kwon Do instructor, says the
art "made me more aware of what I really am. 1
learned how to concentrate; channel and direct
my energy. I'm getting closer and closer to that
something within me."
Tai Chi instructor, Martin Lee, says his classes

are split equally between males and females while
there is a noted majority of males in most of the
other "hard" style martial arts. The reason, sug
gests Saekow, is that males like the physical as
pect of the art.
Says Mcßay, "Martial arts are infinitely better
than sports."
Saekow agrees. "We don't try to weed out 'bad
players.' All we ask is that students do their best.
They are encouraged to stay."
Homogeneity
"Aikido is a homogeneous activity," says
Brown. "It's unique in that junior and senior fa
culty. students and staff come together to learn on
the same level. We're clumsy and inept, but we
grow together. Who you are outside of the hall
doesn't make a damn bit of difference."
Sandra Holmes, a student of Shoto-Kan, started
her training four years ago in Hawaii when her
brother who was taking it at the time encouraged
her to "come along."
"In Hawaii, people are polite most of the time,"
she notes, "whereas here, people are different."
Sandra says she appreciates the "courtesy and
etiquette" that is so much a part of the Japanese
martial arts.
"Every black belt I've met has been so good,
kind and gentle. You know they wouldn't hurt a
fly," she says.
School shopping
For the person unfamiliar with the various
schools of martial arts, choosing the school that
suits his personal preference can be done by re
searching and actually attending some of the clas
ses offered on campus.
"People get tied up with words," says I'egelow.
It's a waste of energy. I take Kenpo, but so what?
The word Kenpo can only express so much."
Each of the six schools emphasizes physical
and mental development, increased awareness,
working in harmony with oneself and others and
finding the "essence" within.
"The essence tends to blur (the schools) while
names tend to make sharp," says Pegelow.
But whatever your inclination, each school of
fers an opportunity to find your own "essence."

Aikido — the soft-style martial art.
Take a cooking class but don't learn how to
cook. Take a skiing class but don't learn how to
ski. Illogical, you say? Practitioners of the martial
arts here claim this is wholly logical.
"Don't talk about self-defense," exclaims Kuo
Lien Ying, a Tai Chi instructor. "The purpose of
the Tai Chi is for you to be healthy. When your
body is healthy, it will take care of itself."
Thus, one takes a martial art, but not really to
learn self defense.
Some of Ying'sTai Chi students say good health
was their motivation.
This "something" within, according to David
Brown, an Aikido student, "is your spirit, your ki.
Your body expresses your spirit and the spirit
grows even when the body fails."
The "knock-out, fight-to-the-finish" martial art
fights that are so loudly promoted today seem
contrary to the gentle, spiritual nature of the mar
tial arts.

dimension," explains F'egelow. "He's unpredict
able so you learn to respond quickly."

"1 don't feel so tight," adds Marilyn Miller ot
Lomar. "If I wanted self-defense, I'd take karate."
Mike Peterson, a Kenpo Karate (Chinese Karate)
student says that while "our style is more vigor
ous" than Tai Chi or some other forms of martial
arts, it's main goal is not self-defense but
'spiritual growth'."
George Pegelow, a Kenpo instructor says all
martial arts "stress basic techniques. We try to

avoid being hurt. We try to escape. To injure or
kill is regrettable."
Hard vs. soft
These techniques are employed in either the
"hard" or "soft" style schools.
"The hard, or external system, emphasizes
punching, kicking, throwing, cutting or using a
weapon," says Brown. "The soft, or internal sys
tem, emphasizes the state of mind, heart and spirit

and is more concerned with directing energy flow
through meditation and deep breathing."
Brown said that though initially the emphases
are different, "both paths (ultimately) merge."
Hard stylists, once they have learned techni
ques, concentrate on improving the "quality" of
the techniques through meditation. Soft stylists,
on the other hand, once they have learned their
internal qualities, begin to "manifest" them in
form.
Aikido and Tai Chi are soft styles, while Kenpo,
Shoto-Kan, Judo andTaeKwonDo are hard styles.

Pegelow quotes a passage from the Daru Jin, a
philosophy book of human activity, as saying the
"inaction or the right action" is what is aimed for.
Bill Laven, a Tae Kwon Do instructor, says the
art "made me more aware of what I really am. 1
learned how to concentrate; channel and direct
my energy. I'm getting closer and closer to that
something within me."
Tai Chi instructor, Martin Lee, says his classes

are split equally between males and females while
there is a noted majority of males in most of the
other "hard" style martial arts. The reason, sug
gests Saekow, is that males like the physical as
pect of the art.
Says Mcßay, "Martial arts are infinitely better
than sports."
Saekow agrees. "We don't try to weed out 'bad
players.' All we ask is that students do their best.
They are encouraged to stay."
Homogeneity
"Aikido is a homogeneous activity," says
Brown. "It's unique in that junior and senior fa
culty. students and staff come together to learn on
the same level. We're clumsy and inept, but we
grow together. Who you are outside of the hall
doesn't make a damn bit of difference."
Sandra Holmes, a student of Shoto-Kan, started
her training four years ago in Hawaii when her
brother who was taking it at the time encouraged
her to "come along."
"In Hawaii, people are polite most of the time,"
she notes, "whereas here, people are different."
Sandra says she appreciates the "courtesy and
etiquette" that is so much a part of the Japanese
martial arts.
"Every black belt I've met has been so good,
kind and gentle. You know they wouldn't hurt a
fly," she says.
School shopping
For the person unfamiliar with the various
schools of martial arts, choosing the school that
suits his personal preference can be done by re
searching and actually attending some of the clas
ses offered on campus.
"People get tied up with words," says I'egelow.
It's a waste of energy. I take Kenpo, but so what?
The word Kenpo can only express so much."
Each of the six schools emphasizes physical
and mental development, increased awareness,
working in harmony with oneself and others and
finding the "essence" within.
"The essence tends to blur (the schools) while
names tend to make sharp," says Pegelow.
But whatever your inclination, each school of
fers an opportunity to find your own "essence."

Aikido — the soft-style martial art.
Take a cooking class but don't learn how to
cook. Take a skiing class but don't learn how to
ski. Illogical, you say? Practitioners of the martial
arts here claim this is wholly logical.
"Don't talk about self-defense," exclaims Kuo
Lien Ying, a Tai Chi instructor. "The purpose of
the Tai Chi is for you to be healthy. When your
body is healthy, it will take care of itself."
Thus, one takes a martial art, but not really to
learn self defense.
Some of Ying'sTai Chi students say good health
was their motivation.
This "something" within, according to David
Brown, an Aikido student, "is your spirit, your ki.
Your body expresses your spirit and the spirit
grows even when the body fails."
The "knock-out, fight-to-the-finish" martial art
fights that are so loudly promoted today seem
contrary to the gentle, spiritual nature of the mar
tial arts.
Bastards
"Those guys who fight with gloves . . . it's a 100
percent bastardization of everything!" declares
Mike Mcßay, a Shoto-Kan (Japan style) karate
student.
"Thefakes getall theexposureand intimate the
wrong ideas," adds Louis Saekow, also of the
Shoto-Kan school. "Within our own classes, we
tell students that is not what they're going to do.
We want to dispell all this violence."
One reason for the spread of wrong concep
tions, says Mcßay, is that those "who do know the
true art form aren't actively campaigning."
Adds Saekow, "We don't reach vast audiences.
Most of our teaching is through our classes."
Except for Tai Chi, all the martial art classes
involve working, grappling or sparring with part
ners. Such work is not violent at all, the represen
tatives claim.
Learning technique
"Sparring helps develop your technique. You
learn by sparring with a partner," says Saekow.

dimension," explains F'egelow. "He's unpredict
