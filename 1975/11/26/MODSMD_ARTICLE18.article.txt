How do sperm banks procure sperm? What technique is used? How
many banks are there, and how can a Stanford student contribute
sperm?
Sorry, but sperm banks aren't exactly an up-and-coming thing —
there aren't very many at all. Dr. Richard Lee, a gynecologist at the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic says he knows of only two in the state —
one in San Francisco, the other in Los Angeles. But the nearby one
is used only for vasectomy patients who want to have their cake and
eat it too. Patients have samples of their ejaculate deep-frozen, and,
if they later decide to have kids, a few tenths of a cc are thawed out
and used for artificial insemination.
What are the different kinds of lubricating jellys, and how can you
use them without being gross? Where can I get them?
Lubricating jellys are used to cut down on friction during vaginal
and anal intercourse. According to the pharmacist at Preuss Phar
macy. the most well-known brand is K-Y Jelly, made by Johnson
and Johnson. He assures that it is sterile and water-soluble, so it
won't leave funny stains on the sheets. A tube sells for about $1.25,
and it is available at most drug stores.
To keep from being gross, the best advice I've heard comes from
someone who has used jellys: "Don't use any more than you have
to, and make the application of the jelly part of your fore-play."
A Cowell source does not recommend the use of vaseline as a
lubricant, because it can corrode diaphragms and condoms.
