# The 						cloud in the silver lining
## Selling TV abroad means money ... and problems 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AF) — Kojak takes a lick of
his lollipop and bawls out a suspect in fluent
German; Dr. Welby examines a patient and de
livers his diagnosis in Spanish; Matt Dillon
lumbers into the Longbranch Saloon and mut
ters "bon/our" to Kitty.
Such sights and sounds have become famil
iar to American tourists locked in overseas
hotel rooms on rainy nights. Almost every
where a traveler goes nowadays, he can find
American television, usually in unfamiliar
languages.
The spread of the U.S. product abroad has
helped bring prosperity to American television
companies —,and also a growing number of
problems.
The problems include; nationalism, which
limits the number of foreign programs; local
censorship, particularly of scenes depicting
violence; and foreign competition.
Gone are the days when a film salesman
could travel from country to country unload
ing all his Wares.
Bewildering selection
As the backlog of American television grows
larger and programming of other major coun
tries becomes more sophisticated, foreign
buyers have a sometimes bewildering selec
tion to choose from.
"Very often a new series will appear on
foreign television at the same time it is released
here," says Robert- Bramson of Universal.
"Our new series Switch is appearing in most
other English-speaking markets simultane
ously with or before the showings on CBS.
"That is essential in Canada. Since many
Canadians along the border can receive U.S.
television, Canadian sponsors don't want
shows that have been shown weeks before. So
Canada has a 'pre-release' system to precede
the American broadcasts."
Australia illustrates tiie problem of the na

tion seeking to retain or promote a national
identity.
50 percent rule
"Australia has had a ruling that 50 percent of
the programming must be produced within the
country," says Universal's Bramson.
"Now the government says it is raising the
percentage to 75. Other countries also have
quotas, but they find that they are difficult
economically. It is far more expensive to pro
duce local shows than it is to buy American
series."
All of the television sellers agree that the
major markets are making their buys with grea
ter care — and taking less.
"It's rare that you can sell a season's product
in Kurope anymore," says Norman Horowitz of
Columbia Pictures Television. "France or
Germany might pick six segments of a series,
show them and then quit — no reruns."
Censorship also plays a role in what series
are bought, especially censorship of violence.
No violence
Brazil, for example, limits violence to shows
appearing after 10 p.m. England understanda
bly'wants no shows about bombings. Mexico
bans plots about dope, bombs, assassinations
and prison breaks.
Arab countries have taboos against kissing,
drinking, adultery, as well as anything notice
ably Jewish. The long television movie QB VII
wasn't even offered to the Arabs.
Anti-Jewish attitudes can be extreme: the
Nakia series was refused by one Arab nation
because the lawman wore a six-pointed badge,
resembling the Jewish star.
Which American series sell best overseas?
"Animals and outdoor pictures are the most
salable," says Richard Harper of 20th
Century-Fox. "Audiences everywhere can re
late to animals: there's no language barrier."
Columbia's Horowitz agrees: "Born Free in

my view will be the most successful show ab
road in the history of American television. We
expect to sell it in virtually every TV market in
the world. This despite the fact that NBC can
celled the show after 13 segments. I wish I had
100."
The Disney hour may hold long-run honors
abroad. It regularly appears in 55 to 60 coun
tries and has played Canada for 21 years, Mex
ico and Australia for 19.
The venerable I Love Lucy still plays all over
the world and remains a favorite in Latin
America, partly because of co-star Desi Arnaz.
Fox continues to get mileage out of Batman,
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and Dobie
Gillis. France bought the 500 episodes of
Peyton Place.
Disney's Zorro remains a hit in Latin
America — Venezuela has played thecomplete
package eight times. But Spain has never
bought it. perhaps because of how the Spanish
rulers of early California were portrayed.
Which American series are hard to sell to
foreign buyers?
Comedy hard to sell
"Comedy shows are the most difficult as a
general rule," says Charles McGregor of
Warner Brothers. "Some of the American
humor just doesn't translate to foreign audi
ences."
Uncomplicated family shows from
television's earlier days like Father Knows Best
and The Donna Reed Show, have done well
abroad. So have gimmick shows like
Bewitched and / Dream of Jeannie.
But the new breed of sitcoms —All in the
Family, the Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Bob
Newhart Show, Barney Miller — has limited
appeal internationally.
"A show likeM-A-S-H with its sophisticated
humor is not easily translatable," admitted
Fox's Harper.

"We waited two or three years until moving
into Latin America, finally finding a good wri
ter who could translate the series into Spanish
while retaining its natural flavor."
American series aimed at Spanish-speaking
countries are dubbed in Mexico City. Simi
larly, shows are dubbed in Germany, Italy, Fr
ance and other major countries, so that native
nuances can be preserved.
Subtitles cheaper
Dubbing is expensive, and smaller countries
use subtitles or a narration that describes the
action and the dialogue in the native language.
Russian television is so far undented by the

American product. The Russians want to barter
with their own programs, rather than pay lees;
no deal, says the Americans.
One American production company esti
mates that 10 percent of its television revenue
comes from abroad. Expenses are heavy and tee
collections can be irregular. But foreign sales
continue to be important. Explains llniversal's
Bramson:
"Because of deficit financing, we can't make
a profit from original runs on the American
networks. So we must rely on one, interna
tional sales, and two. reruns or syndication.
We need both to make a profit."
