# Cowell statistics:
## Pregnancies increasing here 
### KAREN CAESAR 
An increase in the number of pre
gnancies here reflects an apparent na
tional trend toward giving up the birth
control pill, Cowell Student Health
Center statistics reveal.
"From the start of fall quarter, 1974
to mid-November, 1974, 82 pregnancy
tests were done, and 12 were positive.
This year, fall quarter started one week
later. By mid-November, 103 tests had
been done, and 30 were positive. So
you can draw your own conclusions,"
said Dr. John Dorman, a physician at
the Health Center.
"My speculation is that the use of
the Pill has gone down. People either
aren't using anything, or what they're
using, they're using sporadically;.you
can see that by the number of pregnan
cies," said Dorman.
But Dorman thinks the Pill is still
used by most women seeking effective
birth control. "1 still say the majority
use the Pill — I can't give you exact
figures," he said. Approximately 60 to
70 percent of the women who obtain
their contraceptives through Cowell
are on the Pill, he estimated.
Most effective
"The best birth control method is
different for each individual," Dorman
said, but "there is no question that the
Pill is the most effective." However, if
a woman takes the Pill and worries
constantly about what it might or

might not be doing to her, it obviously
is not the best overall method for her,
Dorman said.
The use of the intra-uterine device
(lUD) has also declined. "There is a
definite increase in infections of the
uterus and Fallopian tubes in women
with lUD's, and women who haven't
had kids seem to show more suscepti
bility to lUD-related infections," said
Dorman.
Sterility, one of the most severe pos
sible aftereffects of infections of the
reproductive organs, can result from
scar tissue blocking the Fallopian
tubes, preventing the egg from travel
ing to the uterus to be fertilized or im
planted in the uterine wall.
Statistics indicate that many women
are uncomfortable with the lIJD. In
1974, 142 lUDs were inserted in pa
tients at Cowell. and at least 76 were
removed by patient request. So far, in
1975, 81 were inserted, and at least 35
were removed. Consequently, Cowell
physicians are increasingly reluctant
to use any lUD (they come in various
forms) in women who haven't had
children.
Worry more
"It tends to worry the doctor more,"
said Dorman, "just the idea that you
may be putting something into some
body that might not let them have
kids."

The controversial "morning-after"
pill is not intended for use on a regular
basis. Five pills must be taken twice a
day for five days after intercourse has
occurred. The estrogen level in these
pills make this "roughly equivalent to
fifty birth control pills." said Dorman.
The "morning-after" pill "change(s)
the endometrial lining of the uterus in
such a way that when the fertilized egg
comes down from the Fallopian tubes,
it won't be implanted but will just be
expelled." said Dorman.
But users of the morning-after pill
should definitely plan on getting an
abortion anyway because of the possi
ble effects on a surviving embryo of
Diethyl Stilbesterol (DES), the main
ingredient in one form of the
morning-after pill. Researchers disco
vered that women who took DES dur
ing the '50s to maintain an endangered
pregnancy have daughters who show
an increased tendency toward de
veloping vaginal cancer during
adolescence. Consequently. "DES as
the morning after pill will probably
soon be banned by the FDA for human
use . . . Cowell will not use it any
further," said Dorman.
Cowell receives calls regarding the
"morning-after" pill fairly often, about
two or three times a day on weekends,
especially on Saturday. Sunday and
Monday mornings, Dorman said.

abortion anyway because of the possi
ble effects on a surviving embryo of
Diethyl Stilbesterol (DES), the main
ingredient in one form of the
morning-after pill. Researchers disco
vered that women who took DES dur
ing the '50s to maintain an endangered
pregnancy have daughters who show
an increased tendency toward de
veloping vaginal cancer during
adolescence. Consequently. "DES as
the morning after pill will probably
soon be banned by the FDA for human
use . . . Cowell will not use it any
further," said Dorman.
Cowell receives calls regarding the
"morning-after" pill fairly often, about
two or three times a day on weekends,
especially on Saturday. Sunday and
Monday mornings, Dorman said.
An increase in the number of pre
gnancies here reflects an apparent na
tional trend toward giving up the birth
control pill, Cowell Student Health
Center statistics reveal.
"From the start of fall quarter, 1974
to mid-November, 1974, 82 pregnancy
tests were done, and 12 were positive.
This year, fall quarter started one week
later. By mid-November, 103 tests had
been done, and 30 were positive. So
you can draw your own conclusions,"
said Dr. John Dorman, a physician at
the Health Center.
"My speculation is that the use of
the Pill has gone down. People either
aren't using anything, or what they're
using, they're using sporadically;.you
can see that by the number of pregnan
cies," said Dorman.
But Dorman thinks the Pill is still
used by most women seeking effective
birth control. "1 still say the majority
use the Pill — I can't give you exact
figures," he said. Approximately 60 to
70 percent of the women who obtain
their contraceptives through Cowell
are on the Pill, he estimated.
Most effective
"The best birth control method is
different for each individual," Dorman
said, but "there is no question that the
Pill is the most effective." However, if
a woman takes the Pill and worries
constantly about what it might or

might not be doing to her, it obviously
is not the best overall method for her,
Dorman said.
The use of the intra-uterine device
(lUD) has also declined. "There is a
definite increase in infections of the
uterus and Fallopian tubes in women
with lUD's, and women who haven't
had kids seem to show more suscepti
bility to lUD-related infections," said
Dorman.
Sterility, one of the most severe pos
sible aftereffects of infections of the
reproductive organs, can result from
scar tissue blocking the Fallopian
tubes, preventing the egg from travel
ing to the uterus to be fertilized or im
planted in the uterine wall.
Statistics indicate that many women
are uncomfortable with the lIJD. In
1974, 142 lUDs were inserted in pa
tients at Cowell. and at least 76 were
removed by patient request. So far, in
1975, 81 were inserted, and at least 35
were removed. Consequently, Cowell
physicians are increasingly reluctant
to use any lUD (they come in various
forms) in women who haven't had
children.
Worry more
"It tends to worry the doctor more,"
said Dorman, "just the idea that you
may be putting something into some
body that might not let them have
kids."

The controversial "morning-after"
pill is not intended for use on a regular
basis. Five pills must be taken twice a
day for five days after intercourse has
occurred. The estrogen level in these
pills make this "roughly equivalent to
fifty birth control pills." said Dorman.
The "morning-after" pill "change(s)
the endometrial lining of the uterus in
such a way that when the fertilized egg
comes down from the Fallopian tubes,
it won't be implanted but will just be
expelled." said Dorman.
But users of the morning-after pill
should definitely plan on getting an
abortion anyway because of the possi
ble effects on a surviving embryo of
Diethyl Stilbesterol (DES), the main
ingredient in one form of the
morning-after pill. Researchers disco
