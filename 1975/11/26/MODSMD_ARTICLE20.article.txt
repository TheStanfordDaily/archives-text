# Loch Ness monster 'ugly'

LONDON (AP) — The Loch Ness monster
"is an ugly creature with rough skin, a long
neck and a hideous, revolting head," ac
cording to a young British law student who
says he has seen color photographs taken by
an American research team.
The pictures, cited by at least one eminent
British naturalist to prove the existence of
the legendary beast, were the result of three
years of photographing beneath the murky
depths of Loch Ness, which cuts a 25-mile
gash through the Scottish highlands.
The team was led by Robert Rines, a pa
tent attorney and dean of Franklin Pierce
Law Center in Concord, N.H.
Some of its findings were disclosed
Saturday in a copyrighted story in the Bos
ton Globe.The pictures are to be shown Dec.
10 at a press conference during a sym
posium in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Law student Nicholas Whitchell, 22, who

helped the researchers and chronicled the
expedition, gave a newsman a rough de
scription of what the pictures show.
'Must not say more'
But he added, "I must not say more than
that because an understanding has been
given to the Americans that no disclosure
will be made of the photographic results of
the expedition" before the Edinburgh sym
posium which is to be highlighted by the
press conference.
The symposium of eminent scientists is to
hear a report of the Rines expedition, ex
amine the photographs and offer their as
sessments of what sort of animal they show.
British naturalist Sir Peter Scott, among
the handful of people who have seen the
pictures so far, said Saturday night the
photos helped convince him the Loch Ness
monster is a living prehistoric reptile — or
rather a family of them.
