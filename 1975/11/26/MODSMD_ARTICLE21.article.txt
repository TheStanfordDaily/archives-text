# Study says increase in oil prices will have little impact in long run
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Al
though the increase in world oil
prices dealt the United States
and other industrialized nations
a severe blow in 1974 and 1975,
the long-run impact will be
small, a new study published by
the Brookings Institution said
Sunday.
"In the long run, paying
today's high oil prices need not
prevent these countries from re
suming a healthy rate of
economic expansion and should
have only a modest effect on the
growth of living standards," said
the study from Brookings, a pri
vate research organization.

But the study also contends
that one-half of the deep reces
sion that started last year re
sulted from the four-fold in
crease in world oil prices, and
the failure of economic planners
in the industrial world to prop
erly cushion the impact on their
economies.
One of the editors of the study,
Charles L. Schultze of Brook
ings, said the United States and
other nations overreacted to the
threat of inflation and failed to
foresee the potential for reces
sion.
"All over the world, we com
pletely sacrificed employment

to keep inflation down," he told
a news conference.
Had authorities known how
bad the recession would be, he
said, they probably would have
accepted higher rates of inflation
and done more to stimulate emp
loyment.
A second editor, Edward R.
Fried of Brookings, said:
"There is reason to think there
will be a gradual erosion of
price" for oil, brought about by
reduced demand for oil in the
industrial world and increased
supplies of energy in nations
outside the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries

(OPEC).
The 10 percent increase in oil
prices announced by OPEC ear
lier this year did not fully offset
inflation to that point, he said.
The study is published as a
book by Brookings entitled
Higher Oil Prices and the World
Economy. Economists from the
United States, Western Europe
and Japan contributed to the
work.
A major conclusion of the
study is that the large recessio
nary and inflationary consequ
ences of the 1973 oil price in
crease have passed their peak
and should diminish steadily
over the next several years.
By 19H0, it said, the cost of
foreign oil will be nearly fully
offset for the U.S. economy
through increased job-creating
export activity and by invest
ment in domestic energy
sources.
But the American standard of
living will be somewhat less
than it otherwise might have
been had oil prices remained at
their pre-1973 price of about
$2.75 a barrel, it said.

crease have passed their peak
and should diminish steadily
over the next several years.
By 19H0, it said, the cost of
foreign oil will be nearly fully
offset for the U.S. economy
through increased job-creating
export activity and by invest
ment in domestic energy
sources.
But the American standard of
living will be somewhat less
than it otherwise might have
been had oil prices remained at
their pre-1973 price of about
$2.75 a barrel, it said.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Al
though the increase in world oil
prices dealt the United States
and other industrialized nations
a severe blow in 1974 and 1975,
the long-run impact will be
small, a new study published by
the Brookings Institution said
Sunday.
"In the long run, paying
today's high oil prices need not
prevent these countries from re
suming a healthy rate of
economic expansion and should
have only a modest effect on the
growth of living standards," said
the study from Brookings, a pri
vate research organization.

But the study also contends
that one-half of the deep reces
sion that started last year re
sulted from the four-fold in
crease in world oil prices, and
the failure of economic planners
in the industrial world to prop
erly cushion the impact on their
economies.
One of the editors of the study,
Charles L. Schultze of Brook
ings, said the United States and
other nations overreacted to the
threat of inflation and failed to
foresee the potential for reces
sion.
"All over the world, we com
pletely sacrificed employment

to keep inflation down," he told
a news conference.
Had authorities known how
bad the recession would be, he
said, they probably would have
accepted higher rates of inflation
and done more to stimulate emp
loyment.
A second editor, Edward R.
Fried of Brookings, said:
"There is reason to think there
will be a gradual erosion of
price" for oil, brought about by
reduced demand for oil in the
industrial world and increased
supplies of energy in nations
outside the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries

(OPEC).
The 10 percent increase in oil
prices announced by OPEC ear
lier this year did not fully offset
inflation to that point, he said.
The study is published as a
book by Brookings entitled
Higher Oil Prices and the World
Economy. Economists from the
United States, Western Europe
and Japan contributed to the
work.
A major conclusion of the
study is that the large recessio
nary and inflationary consequ
ences of the 1973 oil price in
crease have passed their peak
and should diminish steadily
over the next several years.
