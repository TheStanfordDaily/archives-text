# Even after long storage
## Vitamin C tablets safe 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — A major
Vitamin C manufacturer said last
week it has "conclusive scien
tific evidence that Vitamin Ctab
lets are both stable and safe even
after prolonged storage."
A study of the stability of
commercial Vitamin C tablets
stored under normal household
conditions was conducted by the
manufacturer, Hoffman-La
Roche, Inc., of Nutley, N.J.
The study was in response to a
charge last April of poor stabil
ity, of the formation of poten
tially harmful breakdown pro
ducts and a lack of suitable
analytical methods for study.
Using a wide range of laborat
ory approaches, Hoffman-La
Roche researchers concluded
that under normal storage condi
tions, commercial Vitamin C tab
lets are stable for more than five

years.
The researchers also said they
found that breakdown products
represent so small a percentage
of total content that they do not
pose a dietary or metabolic
hazard. They also said testing
methods have been available for
years.
The study was presented at a
meeting of the Academy of
Pharmaceutical Sciences in At
lanta by Dr. S.H. Rubin, head of
applied research at Hoffman-La
Roche and a lecturer in nutrition
at New York Medical College.
The study countered allega
tions made by I.J. Wilk, a
biochemist, then of the Univer
sity of the Pacific (UOP), Stock
ton , at a national meeting of
the American Chemical Society
in Philadelphia last April.
Officials at UOP said that Wilk

held an adjunct appointment at
the university's school of den
tistry in San Francisco last
April, but that the appointment
was no longer in effect.
Wilk, reached at his home by
telephone, said he could not
comment in detail without see
ing the study but said that his
paper "still stands." He said he
did not have any current affilia
tion.
One of the charges concerned
a breakdown product called ex
alic acid, which Wilk said was
thought to accelerate the forma
tion of kidney stones.
The researchers at Hoffman-La
Roche said Wilk had not actually
measured the exalic acid con
tent. They said they had found
only negligible amounts com
pared to what is normally con
sumed in the diet.

analytical methods for study.
Using a wide range of laborat
ory approaches, Hoffman-La
Roche researchers concluded
that under normal storage condi
tions, commercial Vitamin C tab
lets are stable for more than five

years.
The researchers also said they
found that breakdown products
represent so small a percentage
of total content that they do not
pose a dietary or metabolic
hazard. They also said testing
methods have been available for
years.
The study was presented at a
meeting of the Academy of
Pharmaceutical Sciences in At
lanta by Dr. S.H. Rubin, head of
applied research at Hoffman-La
Roche and a lecturer in nutrition
at New York Medical College.
The study countered allega
tions made by I.J. Wilk, a
biochemist, then of the Univer
sity of the Pacific (UOP), Stock
ton , at a national meeting of
the American Chemical Society
in Philadelphia last April.
Officials at UOP said that Wilk

held an adjunct appointment at
the university's school of den
tistry in San Francisco last
April, but that the appointment
was no longer in effect.
Wilk, reached at his home by
telephone, said he could not
comment in detail without see
ing the study but said that his
paper "still stands." He said he
did not have any current affilia
tion.
One of the charges concerned
a breakdown product called ex
alic acid, which Wilk said was
thought to accelerate the forma
tion of kidney stones.
The researchers at Hoffman-La
Roche said Wilk had not actually
measured the exalic acid con
tent. They said they had found
only negligible amounts com
pared to what is normally con
sumed in the diet.
