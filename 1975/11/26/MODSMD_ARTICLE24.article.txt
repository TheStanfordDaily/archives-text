## Cards play for national water polo, field hockey titles Scotchers battle in 'Virginny' 
### PERRY SIMON 
Suitcase in hand,
humming"Carry MeßacktoOle'
Virginny," Stanford's field hoc
key team headed east to Harris
burg, Va., yesterday to partici
pate in the first National Field
Hockey Championships over
Thanksgiving weekend.
The scotchers, who placed
second in the Western Regional
Tournament 10 days ago, will
join first-place San Jose State as
representatives of their confer
ence. The Cards will be up
against 14 of the strongest col
legiate field hockey teams in the
nation, representing nine geog
raphic regions.
The team expects a tough bat
tie, as eastern schools have tradi
tionally been strong in field hoc
key. Stanford will open against
William and Mary College to
morrow. Freshman scotcher Jes
sie Gerrard expects William and
Mary to be "a good taste of what
eastern teams are like.
Bill and Mary
"We've heard conflicting re
ports about the William and
Mary team,' she says. "But even
if we get by them, there are still
tougher teams to contend with."
Stanford's fiesty 15 scotchers
will carry a 4-0-1 regular season
record to Virginia. They barely
edged into the finals, tying both
San Jose State and San Diego
State during the regionals at
Stanford. San Jose State was
awarded the victory on the basis
of penetration time, while Stan
ford managed to sufficiently
penetrate San Diego State to gain
a berth in the Nationals.
Apparently, Stanford's show

ing in the regionals was not too
different from the performances
of some other teams this year.
Word has reached the Stanford
team that several eastern schools
also defeated their playoff rivals
on the basis of penetration time,
with as little as a one-second dif
ference deciding one match.
Morris wary
Team captain and goalie Betsy
Morris acknowledges the chal
lenge that faces Stanford's
scotchers. "We suspect that the
eastern teams will be tougher
than many of the teams we've
faced so far."
However, Morris senses a dif
ferent team attitude toward the
upcoming play-offs. "At the be
ginning of the season, all roads
pointed towards Virginia, and
we really felt the pressure during
the regionals. Though we're tak
ing the finals just as seriously,
the team doesn't seem as tense.
We play a much better game of
hockey when we don't let ten
sion burden us."
