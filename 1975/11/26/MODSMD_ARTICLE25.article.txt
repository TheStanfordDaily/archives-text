"Who's that coach out there on
the court?" asked the fan who'd
wandered into Maples Pavilion
this week.
The red-shirted coach, whose

voice resonated off the walls of
Maples, was first-year Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso. preparing
his Cards for their first tests of
the season — the Australian Na
tional Olympic team tonight at 8
and Nevada-Reno, Satur
day at 8 p.m. in Maples.
But the fan had good reason to
be confused. Dißiaso's aggres
sive style of play hasn't been

seen in the sedate confines of
Maples Pavilion for a hell of a
long time.
And Stanford's lineup is un
like anything fans have seen for
the past four years. Four starters,
including three-time All-Pac-
Eight center Rich Kelley, are
gone.
The only returning regular is
second team All-Pac-8 forward

Ed Schweitzer, who averaged
15.5 points and 8.0 rebounds per
game last year.
Tonight, against the Kan
garoos, Stanford will employ
two guards and three forwards.
Jay Carter, who hit five straight
jumpers to spark the Cards'
67-66 upset win over USC last
year, will start at one guard, and
junior Mike Bratz will be
Stanford's quarterback . . . er
floor general (Dißiaso doesn't
want to start his own quarter
back controversy).
Tim Patterson 6-foot-ll is
listed at center, but he'll actually
join Schweitzer and junior col
lege transfer George Schader at
forward.
Patterson, a 52.5 percent shoo
ter last year, averaged 7.5 points
and had four games over 20
points playing in relief of
Schweitzer and Kelly last year.
Shader (6-6, 215) earned first
team JC Ail-American honors at
Mt. San Antonio College last
year, averaging 22.8 points and
10 rebounds per game.
But Dißiaso actually has a
starting eight. Three newcomers
will push for playing time. The
best is probably freshman guard
Wolfe Perry (6-2, 178), who led
Oakland Tech to a 19-6 record
last year, averaging 15 points
and six assists per game.
Freshman guard Paul Giovac
chini and JC transfer Jeff
McHugh round out the new
comers.
The Cards will have more
speed than the track team, and
Dißiaso plans to use it. "We're
going to take advantage of our
quickness at guard by picking up
our opponents out further," said
Di Biaso. "We want to force them
away from the basket, make
them start their offense outside
and upset their tempo."
