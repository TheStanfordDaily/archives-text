# On Wednesday morning
## Chris, QB II: a silver lining 
### Tim W. Ferguson 
1 guess I'm one of those "99 percent" of
Stanford fans whom Jack Christiansen says
don't know what they're talking about when
commenting on Cardinal (a.k.a. "Tree")
football. *
But I don't need expertise in diagraming
end-arounds to say that there's a couple of
pretty good guys who've taken a lot of un
necessary personal abuse during the just
ended campaign. One is Christiansen. The
other is quarterback Mike Cordova.
My criticism of Christiansen in the past is
on record, and I'll stand by it. What impor
tance is lent to it is up to the reader; an
analogy could be made, 1 suppose, to my
critiquing a concert pianist based on
whether I liked the sound of his music.
But the judgment of Chris by his players is
a more weighty one when determining
whether this man is the right one to coach
Stanford football. And their answer is a near
unanimous "yes."
Different atmosphere
Athletics here take place in a rarefied at
mosphere: where classes often take
priority over game preparation; where a
chance to study overseas is seen, even in
coaches' offices, as preferable to a quarter of
weight training; where student-athletes are
allowed to speak and act freely.
Such freedom for his players often is a
constraint for a coach. Some can't operate
under those limitations.
Christiansen seems to be able to live with

it. He didn't much like it when Guy Benja
min used to complain over his lack of play
ing time. He still resents it (and shows it)
when journalists advise him on how to run
the football team.
But usually he manages to redeem himself,
like last Friday night at the Bonfire, when he
announced to a crowdwhich had booed him
vociferously just weeks before that "by
popular demand" Benjamin would start at
quarterback against California.
Chris still wins
Through the boos, the midterms, the
tough competitors down south and the re
strictive admissions standards, Chris has
managed to win. Never often enough to get
to the Rose Bowl, but usually in the Pacific
Eight's upper division.
He says his role is that of a teacher, not a
general, and Jack Christiansen's students
have generally graded him "A."
What this year has taught Mike Cordova is
how fickle is a fan's affection. Two years ago
he was billed as the new Jim Plunkett, and
Cordova said observers should reserve
judgment. Now, again, he wishes fans
would show more reserve in their vocal ap
praisals.
For the cheers of 1973 became the re
stlessness of 1974 and the boos in 1975.
With each jeer came more pressure, and-
Cordova grew tighter. He admitted he'd
rather play away from home. By his last
appearance of the season, in a brief second

quarter stint against Oregon, the wonder
athlete had been reduced to a helpless giant.
Cordova calm
Through it all Cordova put forth a solid
front, throwing no temper tantrums and
maintaining the type of team leadership
which caused Christiansen to favor him in
the first place.
Cordova even smiled bravely and clapped
Friday night as Chris led cheers for the man
who had beaten him out at quarterback,
besting him in a contest which Cordova
doesn't regard as a fair one.
That we learn from an interview pub
lished in last Saturday's Daily. Asked point
blank, Cordova finally speaks his mind, in
the tradition of Stanford athletes.
Cordova is rightfully upset with the
shabby treatment he's gotten from his fel
low students, but he's wrong in saying he
"wasn't given a fair chance to play."
I really believe that it was because they
thought that Benjamin had not been given a
fair shake, and not because they so disliked
Cordova, that fans so insensitively treated
number 16 each week.
Cordova has a chance to beat out his rival
next year with a good deal of pressure lifted
from his shoulders. If he does so in a battle
that fans can believe is a fair one, Cordova
can once again become Stanford's favorite
son.

the tradition of Stanford athletes.
Cordova is rightfully upset with the
shabby treatment he's gotten from his fel
low students, but he's wrong in saying he
"wasn't given a fair chance to play."
I really believe that it was because they
thought that Benjamin had not been given a
fair shake, and not because they so disliked
Cordova, that fans so insensitively treated
number 16 each week.
Cordova has a chance to beat out his rival
next year with a good deal of pressure lifted
from his shoulders. If he does so in a battle
that fans can believe is a fair one, Cordova
can once again become Stanford's favorite
son.

1 guess I'm one of those "99 percent" of
Stanford fans whom Jack Christiansen says
don't know what they're talking about when
commenting on Cardinal (a.k.a. "Tree")
football. *
But I don't need expertise in diagraming
end-arounds to say that there's a couple of
pretty good guys who've taken a lot of un
necessary personal abuse during the just
ended campaign. One is Christiansen. The
other is quarterback Mike Cordova.
My criticism of Christiansen in the past is
on record, and I'll stand by it. What impor
tance is lent to it is up to the reader; an
analogy could be made, 1 suppose, to my
critiquing a concert pianist based on
whether I liked the sound of his music.
But the judgment of Chris by his players is
a more weighty one when determining
whether this man is the right one to coach
Stanford football. And their answer is a near
unanimous "yes."
Different atmosphere
Athletics here take place in a rarefied at
mosphere: where classes often take
priority over game preparation; where a
chance to study overseas is seen, even in
coaches' offices, as preferable to a quarter of
weight training; where student-athletes are
allowed to speak and act freely.
Such freedom for his players often is a
constraint for a coach. Some can't operate
under those limitations.
Christiansen seems to be able to live with

it. He didn't much like it when Guy Benja
min used to complain over his lack of play
ing time. He still resents it (and shows it)
when journalists advise him on how to run
the football team.
But usually he manages to redeem himself,
like last Friday night at the Bonfire, when he
announced to a crowdwhich had booed him
vociferously just weeks before that "by
popular demand" Benjamin would start at
quarterback against California.
Chris still wins
Through the boos, the midterms, the
tough competitors down south and the re
strictive admissions standards, Chris has
managed to win. Never often enough to get
to the Rose Bowl, but usually in the Pacific
Eight's upper division.
He says his role is that of a teacher, not a
general, and Jack Christiansen's students
have generally graded him "A."
What this year has taught Mike Cordova is
how fickle is a fan's affection. Two years ago
he was billed as the new Jim Plunkett, and
Cordova said observers should reserve
judgment. Now, again, he wishes fans
would show more reserve in their vocal ap
praisals.
For the cheers of 1973 became the re
stlessness of 1974 and the boos in 1975.
With each jeer came more pressure, and-
Cordova grew tighter. He admitted he'd
rather play away from home. By his last
appearance of the season, in a brief second

quarter stint against Oregon, the wonder
athlete had been reduced to a helpless giant.
Cordova calm
Through it all Cordova put forth a solid
front, throwing no temper tantrums and
maintaining the type of team leadership
which caused Christiansen to favor him in
the first place.
Cordova even smiled bravely and clapped
Friday night as Chris led cheers for the man
who had beaten him out at quarterback,
besting him in a contest which Cordova
doesn't regard as a fair one.
That we learn from an interview pub
lished in last Saturday's Daily. Asked point
blank, Cordova finally speaks his mind, in
the tradition of Stanford athletes.
