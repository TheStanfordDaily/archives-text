# Poloists meet Arizona in NCAAs
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
For the second straight year
under coach Art Lambert.
Stanford's varsity water polo
team will travel to Long Beach
for the NCAA championships
this Friday and Saturday.
The Cards will be trying to bet
ter last year's sixth-place finish
in the eight-team tournament,
but will be without the regular
season's leading scorer, fresh
man Doug Burke, who was lost
for the season when he received
an elbow in the eye during the
first quarter of last
week's game against Cal.
"Doug's loss will definitely
hurt us, but we should be able to
overcome it if we are the team 1
know we are. I'll probably
change a couple of our players
around. It'll also change our
six-on-five situations," said
Lambert, pointing to a black
board covered with play diag
rams.
Stanford, Cal and UCLA were
all invited to the NCAAs this
year when Michigan and Buck
nell were not allowed to go be
cause they have club teams. The
Cards' overall record placed
them among the top seeds of the
tourney and they subsequently
received a good draw.
Draw critical
"The draw is very important
in this tournament. Last season,
for example, we had to play
UCLA because of our draw. This
season, however, our play is
natually more deserving of a
good draw," Lambert explained.
Stanford will meet Arizona
first Friday at 12:20 p.m. at Bel
mont Plaza Pools in Long Beach
and then a UC-Irvine squad,
which Lambert ranks as the
tournament's second seed, later
at 9 p.m. If both these games re
sult in Stanford victories, the
Cards will advance to the

championships.
According to Lambert. Irvine
presents the only obstacle to the
championship match for the
Cards. Stanford has only man
aged a 1 -2 record against the An
teaters. The last loss came two
weeks ago when the Cards
played UCI as their third game in
a 22-hour time period.
New strategy
Drew McDonald, a junior from
Orinda, says the Cards will
be playing Irvine differently
than during the regular season.
"We are going to size our
selves up more man-to-man with
them as we did against oppo
nents last summer. If we can stop
their two big scorers, then we
figure we'll stop their team."
According to Lambert, UCI
has three guys that have been on
the National team in Gary
Fi'gueroa and Nick Baba, and
goalie Guy Antley. "Against
most teams we will play in the
tournament, if we stop top scor
ers, we will probably stop their
offense," he said. In the two pre
vius Stanford-Irvine contests,
Figueroa and Baba accounted for
14 of the 18 Irvine scores.
Mac Donald plan
"For instance, what I'll try to
do is stop the man I am guarding,
the man in the hole," McDonald
said, "by slowing him down as
he breaks down the pool to set up
the offense. That way, they'll
have to put someone not as
adept in as their setter."
If the Cards get past Irvine.
Stanford will probably meet the
winner of the Cal-UCLA
matchup for the crown Saturday
night at 8:45 p.m.
"We're actually like gears
right now; we haven't quite
meshed yet," Lambert said. "If
things start to fall into place for
us during this tournament we'll
go all the way."
