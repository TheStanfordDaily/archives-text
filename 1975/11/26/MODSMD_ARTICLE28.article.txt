# Chris interested in pros but has no plans to quit
## 
### RON BECK 
Despite a story in yesterday
afternoon's San Francisco Ex
aminer that implied otherwise,
Head Football Coach Jatk Christ
iansen is not preparing to resign.
The article, headlined "Chris
cups ear for pro job offer," made
references to Christiansen's de
sires for a pro football coaching
job.
But it is evident that Christ
iansen did not intend to imply
that he was quitting his Stanford
job.
"The quotes are right," Christ
iansen said after the story came
out. "It's just that I'm not ac
tively seeking any new job," as
the article attempted to indicate.
"1 don't know where things like

this get started.
"I told the reporter that if the
right job was offered to me, I
would take it. But 1 never said I
was quitting," he commented.
"The only day I ever thought of
leaving the university was when
the fans booed me over the quar
terback thing — but that was
only for that one day."
Christiansen had come under
fire f rom the fans and press last
month over his choice of quar
terbacks, but by the end of the
season had elected to change his
selection. "By popular de
mand," Christiansen said, he
chose Guy Benjamin to start over
his original first choice, Mike
Cordova.
Before the change, however,

there had been increasing specu
lation as to whether or not Chris
tiansen would be fired. Al
though Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz officially said he was not
considering the possibility, he
did say that it could be done.
Ruetz reaffirmed his previous
position yesterday. "Jack's got
my backing all the way
through,"hesaid. "Afterarough
start, the team did quite well."
"In fact," Ruetz added, "if you
compare Jack's first years with
John Ralston's (Christiansen's
predecessor), you'll find that
Jack's win-loss record is even
better."
Christiansen said in the
Examiner story that "I do not
plan to resign, but if someone
came along with an offer that I
felt I simply couldn't refuse,
then I would leave Stanford.
"I am not aggressively looking
for another job, but there are sev
eral open in the pros now —
Seattle, New Orleans and the
New York Jets — and there may
be others before long,
"If the right offer came along
from any of these, I would cer
tainly have to consider it."
Yesterday afternoon, Christ
iansen noted that he hasn't yet
been approached by any pro
teams. "I don't even know if
they've started looking for any
body," he said.

Pappas was chosen to play in the Hula Bowl all-star game in
Honolulu Jan. 10.
Despite a story in yesterday
afternoon's San Francisco Ex
aminer that implied otherwise,
Head Football Coach Jatk Christ
iansen is not preparing to resign.
The article, headlined "Chris
cups ear for pro job offer," made
references to Christiansen's de
sires for a pro football coaching
job.
But it is evident that Christ
iansen did not intend to imply
that he was quitting his Stanford
job.
"The quotes are right," Christ
iansen said after the story came
out. "It's just that I'm not ac
tively seeking any new job," as
the article attempted to indicate.
"1 don't know where things like

this get started.
"I told the reporter that if the
right job was offered to me, I
would take it. But 1 never said I
was quitting," he commented.
"The only day I ever thought of
leaving the university was when
the fans booed me over the quar
terback thing — but that was
only for that one day."
Christiansen had come under
fire f rom the fans and press last
month over his choice of quar
terbacks, but by the end of the
season had elected to change his
selection. "By popular de
mand," Christiansen said, he
chose Guy Benjamin to start over
his original first choice, Mike
Cordova.
Before the change, however,

there had been increasing specu
lation as to whether or not Chris
tiansen would be fired. Al
though Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz officially said he was not
considering the possibility, he
did say that it could be done.
Ruetz reaffirmed his previous
position yesterday. "Jack's got
my backing all the way
through,"hesaid. "Afterarough
start, the team did quite well."
"In fact," Ruetz added, "if you
compare Jack's first years with
John Ralston's (Christiansen's
predecessor), you'll find that
Jack's win-loss record is even
better."
Christiansen said in the
Examiner story that "I do not
plan to resign, but if someone
came along with an offer that I
felt I simply couldn't refuse,
then I would leave Stanford.
"I am not aggressively looking
for another job, but there are sev
eral open in the pros now —
Seattle, New Orleans and the
New York Jets — and there may
be others before long,
"If the right offer came along
from any of these, I would cer
tainly have to consider it."
Yesterday afternoon, Christ
iansen noted that he hasn't yet
been approached by any pro
teams. "I don't even know if
they've started looking for any
body," he said.
