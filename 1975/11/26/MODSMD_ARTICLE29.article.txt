Swimmers sweep
The Stanford women's swim
ming team swept its three oppo
nents in a meet yesterday at the
deGuerre Fools. The Cards de
feated San Jose State, 99-37,
Hayward State. 111-25, and the
University of the Pacific, 118-18.
Freshman Barb Beck qualified
for the Nationals at Miami in
March with a time of 1:11.5 in
the 100-meter breast stroke.
The swimmers will compete
next in the NCIAC Champion
ships at San Francisco State Dec.
5 and 6. "We'll probably wipe
everyone out," said Coach Kathy
Daggett.
Wrestlers lose twice
This year's Stanford wrestling
team made a rather inauspicious
debut Monday night, losing two
matches in San Jose. Inexperi
ence and early season injuries
hurt the Cards as they suc
cumbed to San Jose State, 31-9,
and Sacramento State, 27-21.
Stanford mentor Joe DeMeo
lauded three of his wrestlers for
good performances despite the
losses. DeMeo said freshman
Mike King, and lettermen Craig
Reynolds and Roy Tolles were
particularly impressive.
King, wrestling in the
118-pound division, lost 9-6
against San Jose State, but came
back with an 8-2 win against
Sacramento State. Reynolds and
Tolles were Stanford's only
double winners.
Reynolds bested his San Jose
State opponent, 8-6, and then
had a rest when Sac State for
feited at 167 pounds. Tolles, a
177-pounder, got Stanford's
only pin of the night in the third
period against Sacramento State.
He had an earlier 10-3 decision
in his San Jose State match.
Frosh standout Jim Spangler,
an all-state wrestler from Await
High School in Santa Clara, suf
fered his second recent concus
sion Monday, but now appears
to be healthy. DeMeo expects

Spangler to be ready next Tues
day night when Stanford begins
its home season with a match
against Stanislaus State and
Sonoma State at 7:30 in the En
cina Gym.

Women harriers to race
With just three competitive
meets under its belt, Stanford's
first-year women's cross country
team will participate in the Na
tional AAU Women's Cross
Country Championships in
Belmont this Saturday. And if
the past is any indicator of the
future, Stanford will hold its
own on the three-mile Crystal
Springs course.
The women made a rather
memorable entry into the com
petitive running scene in mid-
October by besting the field at
the Stanford Invitational to
claim team honors. Later, in the
Davis Invitational they placed a
close second to the host Aggies.
This weekend the women will
be running against such top
teams as the Sap Jose Cindergals,
the West Valley Track Club and
the Los Angeles Track Club,
which features national record
holder Julie Brown.
But Stanford has a highly
competent squad of its own. Led
by freshman Ann Thrupp, a bas
ketball player who stopped play
ing to run with the team, the
Cardinals should fare rather
well. Complementing Thrupp
are sophomore Kristen Whets

tone, junior Linda Ames, fresh
man Phyllis Hironaka, junior
Lourdes Hernandez and sopho
more Sandy Briscoe.
Briscoe, an international race
walker, women's Coach George
Berry, and cross country Coach
Marshall Clark were primarily
responsible for the organization
of the team. Both Briscoe and
Berry would like to see the
women harriers assume varsity
status next year.
"There are nine freshmen and
sophomores on the team who
have the potential to be excellent
runners," Berry said, "but as it is
now, they can't even get lockers
or showers near our practice
areas. Also, they might be able to
attend other meets since there
aren't that many teams in this
area."

'Muncie not registered'
KGO Sports Director John
O'Reilly last night reported that
California running back Chuck
Muncie is not a registered stu
dent at the University of Califor
nia: that the only Registrar's list
ing for the name Muncie, is
Harry Vance Muncie.
"Chuck is just a nickname in
the press book," said Cal Sports
Information Director John
McCasey. "He (O'Reilly) doesn't
know that Chuck's real name is
Harry Vance Muncey. Muncie is
registered for 14 units and he's
an accredited first quarter
senior."

Cal Faculty Representative
Robert Steidel, who is responsi
ble for checking the eligibility of
Bear student-athletes, said,
"What KGO tried to do is look
him up at the registrar's office
under Charles Muncie and when
they didn't find him. they
thought they had a scoop. Mun
cie is registered for 14 units."
O'Reilly also said that Muncie
and four other Cal football
players have not been attending
class. Steidel says that there's no
way to tell. "Whether he's going
to class is his business. You can't
really look into it under the
Buckley Amendment. He is re
gistered. We know it.the Pac-8
knows it and the University
knows it."
NCAA eligibility rules require
that a player be registered at the
school he's playing for and that
he complete a certain number of
units in the period preceeding
the season. The rules do not say
anything about requiring a
player to go to class.
