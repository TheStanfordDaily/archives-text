# Frat alumni question 12 percent rent hike
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Stung by a 12 percent rent increase
for most University fraternities, mem
bers of the Inter-fraternity Alumni
Council (IFAC) have raised questions
concerning ambiguous sections of the
informal leasing agreements between
the houses and the University.
At a meeting a week ago, IFAC re
quested administration representa
tives to provide a statement itemizing
the charges included in the bills given
to each fraternity at the start of each
quarter.
In the past, one non-itemized bill
has been presented to each fraternity
for rent and general upkeep. Now,
chiefly because of questions raised
about the nature of the 12 percent in
crease in rent imposed this quarter, the
student housing office is preparing the
requested breakdown of the autumn
quarter bills.
Assistant Housing Manager Chet

Choy said that housing rates were in
creased by a uniform 12 percent for all
University-owned housing on cam
pus.
Exceptions
All fraternity houses except the
Sigma Chi and Theta Xi houses are
owned by the University and leased
under an informal "letter of under
standing" from the University.
Formal leases would be unfavorable
for tax purposes, according to Choy,
who explained that under the existing
arrangement the Internal Revenue
Service considers fraternity houses to
be educational facilities.
Members of houses bound by "let
ters of understanding" have raised
several questions about what is co
vered in the agreement.
"The big problem is not fairness or
unfairness but just plain ambiguity.
No one seems to know what services
we deserve or what duties we're sup
posed to perform," said Phi Delta
Theta house manager Tim Wylder.
Equalize costs
Inter-Fraternity Council President
Bob Ottilie said that, "there is a feeling
among many fraternity members that
what the University is attempting to do
is equalize the cost of University hous
ing as opposed to fraternity housing.
"They (administrators) think they
can justify everything, and that may
well be, but what's important to us is
that had we knoyvn where some of
these increases were coming from, we
might have challenged some of them
and not requested some (of the ser
vices) that we're getting."
Choy claimed that all the increases
over the last 12 years are fully justified.
He compared the 1963-64 annual rate
of $19,830 for the cluster houses (near
Cowell Health Center and along Lake
Lagunita and Campus Drive) with the
current rate of $28,735, saying that he
thinks, "a 45 percent increase over a 13
year period is not excessive."

Choy said that he had heard of only
one request by a fraternity for a reduc
tion of University services, and it was
not granted.
Land status
Alpha Delta Phi treasurer Ted
Schlafly said he felt that the question
of whether the land surrounding the
fraternity houses is included in the
agreements should be clarified.
"We thought we had leased our
land. We thought our parking lot came
with the house, but it apparently
doesn't, which is why they've given us
$15 tickets for parking in our own lot."
