Coup attempted in Lisbon
LlSBON—Portugal Pro-Communist paratroopers seized
four air bases in an armed rebellion yesterday, but loyalist
commandos rallied to President Francisco da Costa
Gomes, and the revolt appeared near collapse.
Costa Gomes called the revolt "an attempted coup" and
declared a state.of siege- for the Lisbon region with a
midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew and a suspension of civil liber
ties. The siege declaration replaced a less-rigorous state of
emergency decreed earlier in the day.
The commandos, backed by armored cars and moving
quickly after dusk, surrendered two of the bases last night
and the rebels surendered without a fight, the government
announced.
Wage policy critiqued
WASHINGTON — The government can do very little to
influence wages and prices, but can easily plunge the
nation into recession while trying, a new publication from
the Brookings Institution said yesterday.
The inability to do anything about wages results partly
from the government's own payroll practices, which do
not respond to downward changes in the economy, said
Robert Hall, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
Economist George Perry, also writing for Brookings,
said that contrary to what many people believe, large
wage increases may result more from labor's attempt to
capture a greater share of the national wealth than at
tempts to offset a rising cost of living.
Spain to free political captives
MADRID, Spain — The Spanish government yesterday
lifted fines levied against more than 30 Roman Catholic

priests for criticizing the Franco regime and was reported
about to grant a wide amnesty to prisoners held for politi
cal and labor offenses.
Both moves were described as a celebration of the as
cension of 37-year-old King Juan Carlos I, Spain's new
chief of state.
N.Y. escapes default
ALBANY, N.Y. —The state legislature, major New York
City banks and city employe union leaders all agreed
yesterday to the key elements of Cov. Hugh Carey's $9.4
billion plan to end the city's prolonged fiscal crisis.
And in Washington, a Ford administration source told
the Associated Press that President Ford has decided to
endorse a federal aid plan which would help the city
surmount its cash flow problems and perhaps provide the
final element needed to insure the city will not default.
The source refused to give details of the Ford plan but said
it would be announced today.
However, William Seidman, Ford's economic adviser,
cautioned that Ford had reached no final decision on a
New York City legislative plan.
Kissinger, Brezhnev may confer
DETROIT — Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said
yesterday he may meet personally with Soviet leaders in
an effort to break a deadlock on negotiations to limit the
spread of nuclear weapons.
Kissinger, speaking at a news conference, said the two
nations currently are at an impasse in the talks over count
ing Soviet Backfire bombers and American cruise mis
siles.
But he said the United States is willing to soften its
demands if the Soviets do likewise, addingthat once the
bomber-cruise missile impasse is breached, an arms limi
tation agreement could come "reasonably rapidly."
