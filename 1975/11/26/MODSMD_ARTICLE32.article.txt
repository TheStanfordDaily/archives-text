### KEVIN CHILDRESS 
A random sampling by two under
graduates indicates that 56 percent of
213 students surveyed feel the ASSU
Senate and Council of Presidents have
not attempted to present the views of
the student body to the public; 36 per
cent said they did; 10 percent said they
did not know.
Forty-five percent wanted to keep
the Bonfire in some form, but 40 per
cent opposed the Bonfire, while 15
percent "don't care."
The survey was conducted by Russ
Ridder, a junior in engineering, and
Dick Stark, a sophomore in Human
Biology.
On the mascot question, 46 percent
said the Indian mascot is "a symbol of
racism"; 39 percent said it was not.
Fifty-two percent also said that, "cer
tain alumni and students have shown
very poor taste and insensitivity in the
campaign to bring back the Indian,"
while 32 percent disagreed.
A majority (55%) favored retention
of the Honor Code; 25 percent did not.
Abolition of the code would not "have

a significant effect on reducing cheat
ing," said 19 percent; 21 percent said it
would.
Start said Asst. Statistics Prof. Tom
Sager said the survey would be fairly
reflective of the general student popu
lation. A quick check showed that the
percentages of minorities and dorm
dwellers responding seemed to com
pare accurately with actual enroll
ment.
The survey found 76 percent of
those polled either satisfied or very
satisfied with their student housing,
while only 14 percent expressed dis
satisfaction. Some 53 percent termed
the housing system "reasonably equit
able," 29 percent said it was not and
18 percent did not know.
The students ranked the grading
system and student housing as deserv
ing of the most attention during the
last month.
The resurrection of the "D" grade
was not "a proper approach to grade
inflation," according to 43 percent,
while 38 percent disagreed with that
assessment.
