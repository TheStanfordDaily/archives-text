# Mascot committee selects seven referendum choices
## 
### JACK VAUGHN 
The ASSIJ mascot selection
committee last night chose seven
candidates for next week's student
poll on a new athletic symbol.
The group chose: Trees, Se
quoias, Huns, Robber Barons, Rail
roaders, Spikes and Cardinals.
Composed of representatives
from the ASSU Senate, the Band,
KZSU.the Athletic Department, the
Inter-Fraternity Council and the
Daily, the panel narrowed an origi
nal list of 55 names to the final
seven.
Students will vote for a first and
second choice in the Dec. 3-4 elec
tion, according to committee
chairman Tim Conway. Two points
will be given for a first choice selec
tion and one point for a second
choice.
Two step
Conway proposed the two-step
procedure to "make the second
choice look good," he said. "If the
majority of the students chooses
Robber Barons, and the administra
tion has objections, there will be a
strong second choice."
The committee rejected several
suggestions, such as Titans and
Cowboys, because other schools
use them. "We think Stanford is a
little bit different, and we should
have a mascot that is a little bit dif
ferent," Conway said.
Frivolous suggestions
The committee rejected several of
the more frivolous suggestions,
such as the Squirrels, Romping Red
Rhinos, and Peninsula Creamers, to
avoid giving opposing teams fuel

for poking fun at the University.
"We're opening ourselves up to a
Jot" in selecting a name like the
Squirrels, a Band representative,
Tom Banducci, said.
Conway said the list of candi
dates was "based on the sugges
tions that came to the Daily" plus
others submitted to him from the
University community. The Daily's
group, used in a poll in Saturday's
Big Game football issue, were
selected by a committee of Daily
staffers, Dolly, Band and KZSU rep-
Jhe Indian was not al
lowed on cither < ommittec's list.
Referendum
However, a proposed referendum
would ask student opinion on the
return of the Indian. A petition to
put'the issue on the ballot has gar
nered69B signatures according to
petition circulator Jim Simpson.
"They (the ASSU elections com
mission) asked for 600 signatures"
to put the referendum on the ballot,
Simpson said. He said election offi
cials "haven't checked the signa
tures yet," but expects them to be
adequate.
Though Simpson said he fears a
positive vote on the Indian "won't
carry any weight" because of Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig's rejection of the
former mascot, "at least it will let
him (Rosenzweig) know where the
students stand."
He added that the student deci
sion will "also let the ASSU Senate
know where it stands as representa
tive of the student body." The se
nate has voted 17-1 to reaffirm its
1972 stand against the Indian.

tions that came to the Daily" plus
others submitted to him from the
University community. The Daily's
group, used in a poll in Saturday's
Big Game football issue, were
selected by a committee of Daily
staffers, Dolly, Band and KZSU rep-
Jhe Indian was not al
lowed on cither < ommittec's list.
Referendum
However, a proposed referendum
would ask student opinion on the
return of the Indian. A petition to
put'the issue on the ballot has gar
nered69B signatures according to
petition circulator Jim Simpson.
"They (the ASSU elections com
mission) asked for 600 signatures"
to put the referendum on the ballot,
Simpson said. He said election offi
cials "haven't checked the signa
tures yet," but expects them to be
adequate.
Though Simpson said he fears a
positive vote on the Indian "won't
carry any weight" because of Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig's rejection of the
former mascot, "at least it will let
him (Rosenzweig) know where the
students stand."
He added that the student deci
sion will "also let the ASSU Senate
know where it stands as representa
tive of the student body." The se
nate has voted 17-1 to reaffirm its
1972 stand against the Indian.
The ASSIJ mascot selection
committee last night chose seven
candidates for next week's student
poll on a new athletic symbol.
The group chose: Trees, Se
quoias, Huns, Robber Barons, Rail
roaders, Spikes and Cardinals.
Composed of representatives
from the ASSU Senate, the Band,
KZSU.the Athletic Department, the
Inter-Fraternity Council and the
Daily, the panel narrowed an origi
nal list of 55 names to the final
seven.
Students will vote for a first and
second choice in the Dec. 3-4 elec
tion, according to committee
chairman Tim Conway. Two points
will be given for a first choice selec
tion and one point for a second
choice.
Two step
Conway proposed the two-step
procedure to "make the second
choice look good," he said. "If the
majority of the students chooses
Robber Barons, and the administra
tion has objections, there will be a
strong second choice."
The committee rejected several
suggestions, such as Titans and
Cowboys, because other schools
use them. "We think Stanford is a
little bit different, and we should
have a mascot that is a little bit dif
ferent," Conway said.
Frivolous suggestions
The committee rejected several of
the more frivolous suggestions,
such as the Squirrels, Romping Red
Rhinos, and Peninsula Creamers, to
avoid giving opposing teams fuel

for poking fun at the University.
"We're opening ourselves up to a
Jot" in selecting a name like the
Squirrels, a Band representative,
Tom Banducci, said.
Conway said the list of candi
dates was "based on the sugges
tions that came to the Daily" plus
others submitted to him from the
University community. The Daily's
group, used in a poll in Saturday's
