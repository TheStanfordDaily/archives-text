# Lyman blasts aid critics

### WILLIAM ROSS 
Attracting highly qualified students
to Stanford should remain the main
goal of the financial aid program, Pres
ident Richard Lyman declared last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
Lyman attacked a report written by
three students, led by Dan Howard,
who investigated the admissions
policies of the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial
Aid (C-UAFA). The report concluded
that academic admissions criteria
place low income students at a disad
vantage and should be abolished.
"The report rushes to conclusions
that are not yet justified," Lyman said.
"It tries to turn the whole process up
side down and make socio-economic
mix the main criteria for aid, while
decreasing the importance of
academic factors. This seems to me
like the wrong tone."
Lyman contended that because the
report was "very ad hominem and very
unwilling to admit that there is
another point of view," it is doubtful
that C-UAFA will seriously study the
report in its present form.
But Lyman said that, "there is plenty
of room for discussion and debate" on
the general issues raised by the How
ard Report and that it "should be a
stimulus to discussion."
According to Lyman, the University
would not be able to attract highly
qualified students if it did not offer its
best students financial incentives in
cases where students were financially
pressed.
"The report says it doesn't make
sense to try to get the very best stu
dents to come here, and 1 cannot agree
with that," Lyman said.
Students in the very low income
category must provide $2850 in self
help while at Stanford, compared to
$2400 for those students in the highest
academic category and $4600 and
$6200 for those in the next two
categories of academic desirability.
Lyman also criticized the Howard
Report's contention that Admissions
Dean Fred Hargadon exercises too
much power over the admissions and
financial aid processes.
"It is not true that Hargadon controls
all information regarding admis
sions," Lyman said. "Indeed, there is
much information that he is at pains to
get out."
Lyman said he opposed the report's
recommendation to create an "off
beat" admissions office which would
save 100 to 200 spaces each year for
students with qualifications other than
high grade point averages and SATs.
According to Lyman, the admis
sions process office already admits
many students with relatively low
GPAs and SATs who display special
talents.

Attracting highly qualified students
to Stanford should remain the main
goal of the financial aid program, Pres
ident Richard Lyman declared last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
Lyman attacked a report written by
three students, led by Dan Howard,
who investigated the admissions
policies of the Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial
Aid (C-UAFA). The report concluded
that academic admissions criteria
place low income students at a disad
vantage and should be abolished.
"The report rushes to conclusions
that are not yet justified," Lyman said.
"It tries to turn the whole process up
side down and make socio-economic
mix the main criteria for aid, while
decreasing the importance of
academic factors. This seems to me
like the wrong tone."
Lyman contended that because the
report was "very ad hominem and very
unwilling to admit that there is
another point of view," it is doubtful
that C-UAFA will seriously study the
report in its present form.
But Lyman said that, "there is plenty
of room for discussion and debate" on
the general issues raised by the How
ard Report and that it "should be a
stimulus to discussion."
According to Lyman, the University
would not be able to attract highly
qualified students if it did not offer its
best students financial incentives in
cases where students were financially
pressed.
"The report says it doesn't make
sense to try to get the very best stu
dents to come here, and 1 cannot agree
with that," Lyman said.
Students in the very low income
category must provide $2850 in self
help while at Stanford, compared to
$2400 for those students in the highest
academic category and $4600 and
$6200 for those in the next two
categories of academic desirability.
Lyman also criticized the Howard
Report's contention that Admissions
Dean Fred Hargadon exercises too
much power over the admissions and
financial aid processes.
"It is not true that Hargadon controls
all information regarding admis
sions," Lyman said. "Indeed, there is
much information that he is at pains to
get out."
Lyman said he opposed the report's
recommendation to create an "off
beat" admissions office which would
save 100 to 200 spaces each year for
students with qualifications other than
high grade point averages and SATs.
According to Lyman, the admis
sions process office already admits
many students with relatively low
GPAs and SATs who display special
talents.
