# McCloskey issues challenge to Reagan
## 
### CHARLIE HALL 
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) has challenged former Cov.
Ronald Reagan to a series of debates
and says he will actively campaign
against Reagan in February's New
Hampshire GOP primary.
McCloskey issued the challenge in a
letter last Friday following Reagan's
announcement last week that he will
seek to win the Republican presiden
tial nomination next year.
McCloskey said he isn't sure
whether Reagan will accept his offer,
but a campaign aide commented that
McCloskey's challenge is an expres
sion of his anger at Reagan's candidacy
and that he has little hope of a positive
response.
McCloskey, in a conversation yes
terday with the Daily, accused Reagan
of speaking in "glittering

generalities," insisting that the former
governor should be pinned down on
specific issues.
Unintelligible position
"I don't think Reagan can stand
close cross-examination," McCloskey
said, describing Reagan's position on
federal aid to New York as unintelligi
ble.
"He's said that he doesn't want to
see God-fearing New York taxpayers
penalized, but on the other hand says
that he doesn't want mismanagement
rewarded. When you hear something
like that, you don't know where he
stands."
McCloskey insisted that his offer
should in no way preclude President
Ford from debating with Reagan. "I'm
not suggesting he (Ford) shouldn't go
to New Hampshire and debate. Ford
should," he said. McCloskey added,
however, that he sympathizes with
Ford's desire to avoid becoming too
directly involved in the New Hamp
shire campaign.
McCloskey strongly emphasized
thatjhe is not unconditionally endors
ing Ford. "This is not a campaign for
Ford. It's a campaign against Reagan,"
he asserted.
Although McCloskey has said he ag
rees with the President on only 60 per
cent of the issues and that he's not cer
tain he will vote for Ford in the general
election, he said that Reagan's nomi

nation would be disaster for the GOP.
If Reagan was nominated, McClos
key predicted, "it would drive me and
many others like me out of the party."
In addition, McCloskey maintained
that conservative domination of the
GOP has damaged the Republicans.
"If the Reagan wing should control
the party for the next 10 years," he
maintained, "it would end any hope of
moderating the Republican party."
McCloskey called Reagan, "thebiggest
threat to come down the road in a long
time," terming the former governor's
views on gun control as being "to the
right of Genghis Khan."

GOP has damaged the Republicans.
"If the Reagan wing should control
the party for the next 10 years," he
maintained, "it would end any hope of
moderating the Republican party."
McCloskey called Reagan, "thebiggest
threat to come down the road in a long
time," terming the former governor's
views on gun control as being "to the
right of Genghis Khan."
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) has challenged former Cov.
Ronald Reagan to a series of debates
and says he will actively campaign
against Reagan in February's New
Hampshire GOP primary.
McCloskey issued the challenge in a
letter last Friday following Reagan's
announcement last week that he will
seek to win the Republican presiden
tial nomination next year.
McCloskey said he isn't sure
whether Reagan will accept his offer,
but a campaign aide commented that
McCloskey's challenge is an expres
sion of his anger at Reagan's candidacy
and that he has little hope of a positive
response.
McCloskey, in a conversation yes
terday with the Daily, accused Reagan
of speaking in "glittering

generalities," insisting that the former
governor should be pinned down on
specific issues.
Unintelligible position
"I don't think Reagan can stand
close cross-examination," McCloskey
said, describing Reagan's position on
federal aid to New York as unintelligi
ble.
"He's said that he doesn't want to
see God-fearing New York taxpayers
penalized, but on the other hand says
that he doesn't want mismanagement
rewarded. When you hear something
like that, you don't know where he
stands."
McCloskey insisted that his offer
should in no way preclude President
Ford from debating with Reagan. "I'm
not suggesting he (Ford) shouldn't go
to New Hampshire and debate. Ford
should," he said. McCloskey added,
however, that he sympathizes with
Ford's desire to avoid becoming too
directly involved in the New Hamp
shire campaign.
McCloskey strongly emphasized
thatjhe is not unconditionally endors
ing Ford. "This is not a campaign for
Ford. It's a campaign against Reagan,"
he asserted.
Although McCloskey has said he ag
rees with the President on only 60 per
cent of the issues and that he's not cer
tain he will vote for Ford in the general
election, he said that Reagan's nomi

nation would be disaster for the GOP.
If Reagan was nominated, McClos
key predicted, "it would drive me and
many others like me out of the party."
In addition, McCloskey maintained
that conservative domination of the
GOP has damaged the Republicans.
