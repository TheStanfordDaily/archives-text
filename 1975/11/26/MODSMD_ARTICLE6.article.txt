# McCloskey issues challenge to Reagan

### CHARLIE HALL 
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) has challenged former Cov.
Ronald Reagan to a series of debates
and says he will actively campaign
against Reagan in February's New
Hampshire GOP primary.
McCloskey issued the challenge in a
letter last Friday following Reagan's
announcement last week that he will
seek to win the Republican presiden

McCloskey said he isn't sure
whether Reagan will accept his offer,
but a campaign aide commented that
McCloskey's challenge is an expres

and that he has little hope of a positive
response.
McCloskey, in a conversation yes

of speaking in "glittering

generalities," insisting that the former
governor should be pinned down on
specific issues.

"I don't think Reagan can stand
close cross-examination," McCloskey
said, describing Reagan's position on
federal aid to New York as unintelligi

"He's said that he doesn't want to
see God-fearing New York taxpayers
penalized, but on the other hand says
that he doesn't want mismanagement
rewarded. When you hear something
like that, you don't know where he
stands."
McCloskey insisted that his offer
should in no way preclude President
Ford from debating with Reagan. "I'm
not suggesting he (Ford) shouldn't go
to New Hampshire and debate. Ford
