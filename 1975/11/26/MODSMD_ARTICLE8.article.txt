## Inaction? 
### 
The University's recent inability to meet its affirma
tive action goals may be a signal of even greater prob
lems in years to come.
The most recent University reports show the Univer
sity drastically behind in its projections for the hiring
and promotion of minority and women employes and
faculty.
Just last month Vice Provost Arthur Bienenstock told
the Faculty Senate that a leveling off of the appoint
ment of blacks, chicanos and women to faculty posi
tions could indicate a "faltering on the part of the
University towards affirmative action."
Continued "faltering" over the next few years could
have serious consequences. The Federal government
could cut off new Federal funding or even "disbar" the
University, making it ineligible for any Federal monies
whatsoever.
It's time that the Universitystepsupits commitment
to recruiting and maintaining a balanced faculty and
staff. Affirmative action goals must be met now, before
economic hardships and budget cuts force dramatic
hiring slowdowns or even across-the-board hiring
freezes.
Action now could prevent disaster later.
