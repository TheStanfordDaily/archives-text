# FBI shocks

A Senate investigation committee revealed last week
that agents of the FBI carried on a series of defamation
campaigns aimed at the leaders of the civil rights
movement and both left-wing and right-wing political
parties. We both condemn and deplore these activities.
The anonymous letter which the FBI sent to the late Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr., urging that he commit suicide
is particularly appalling.
No one, especially agents and officers of the federal
government, should try to stifle internal dissent. The
airing of differing and unpopular opinions, especially
in the political realm, has long been a symbol of this
nation. Attempts to quell new and radical views viol
ates those principles which are eloquently and care
fully stated in the Constitution â€” the very Constitution
those FBI officials were supposedly sworn to uphold.
We urge that the Justice Department begin its own
investigation of these felonies. Any current or former
FBI officials, regardless of present government posi
tion or past service to the nation, who are found to have
engaged in these felonious acts should be indicted and
brought to trial.
Some of these FBI officials now being linked to the
activities now in question were among those law en
forcement officials in the late 1960s who bitterly de
nounced the dissidents and radicals for their criminal
acts and did their best to make sure that these law
breakers were brought to trial. Now it is time for these
new lawbreakers to experience the same justice.
