# UN extends Mid-East buffer mandate

### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (AP) —
The U.N. Security Council adopted a
resolution last night extending the
mandate of the U.N. buffer force bet
ween Israeli and Syrian troops on the
Golan Heights for another six months
and scheduling a Middle East debate
Jan. 12.
The resolution was a compromise
proposed by four nonaligned nations.
It was aimed at solving the major
stumbling block in renewal of the
mandate — the thorny problem of the
Palestine Liberation Organization's
(PLO) participation in the debate.
Syria at first had demanded that the
resolution call for such participation,
which the United States opposed.
The PLO was not mentioned in the
compromise resolution but the four
nations proposed that the council
president read a statement saying it
was "the understanding of the major
ity of the Security Council" that the
PLO whould be invited to take part.
Syria accepted wording
Diplomatic sources and Syria had
accepted the wording of the resolu
tion, and U.S. Ambassador Daniel P.
Moynihan told a reporter he had "fi

nally got it all together."
The compromise resolution —
proposed by Guyana, Cameroon,
Mauritania and Tanzania — extends
the peacekeeping mandate six months
and calls for a "debate on the Middle
East problem including the Palesti
nian question, taking into account all
relevant United Nations resolutions."
The United States rejected an earlier
proposal which had mentioned "re
levant General Assembly" resolutions
because of a Nov. 10 resolution by the
General Assembly which said the PLO
was to be invited to all U.N. delibera
tions on the Middle East.
An Arab diplomat explained the
American haggling over the PLO par
ticipation by saying, "They know they
can't stop it but they don't want to be
associated with it."
Unconditional consent
Israel had consented uncondition
ally to extending the life of the U.N.
Golan Heights force, and Israeli
Foreign Minister Yigal Allon said in
Jerusalem that "Syria and its suppor
ters in the Security Council will carry
the responsibility if the mandate is not
extended."

Moynihan and Syrian Ambassador
Mouaffak Allaf stepped in Saturday
night after nonaligned members of the
council failed to produce a resolution
that would work. For two days the
nonaligned members, with one assist
from France, dreamed up one formula
after another but none that both sides
would buy.

The Americans insisted that the
presidential statement on the PLO par
ticipation in the debate say it was the
understanding of "a majority of the
council" instead of the understanding
of "the council." It left the United
States free to say it was in a minority
that did not share such an understand
ing.


SHOPPING STRETCH — The University planning office has proposed a
200,000 square foot expansion in the Stanford shopping center. At present it
covers 1.05 million square feet. The planning, being done by the Arm of Bull,

200,000 square foot expansion in the Stanford shopping center. At present it
covers 1.05 million square feet. The planning, being done by the Arm of Bull,
Field, Volkmann and Stockwell, is for the first general expansion to the center

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (AP) —
The U.N. Security Council adopted a
resolution last night extending the
mandate of the U.N. buffer force bet
ween Israeli and Syrian troops on the
Golan Heights for another six months
and scheduling a Middle East debate
Jan. 12.
The resolution was a compromise
proposed by four nonaligned nations.
It was aimed at solving the major
stumbling block in renewal of the
mandate — the thorny problem of the
Palestine Liberation Organization's
(PLO) participation in the debate.
Syria at first had demanded that the
resolution call for such participation,
which the United States opposed.
The PLO was not mentioned in the
compromise resolution but the four
nations proposed that the council
president read a statement saying it
was "the understanding of the major
ity of the Security Council" that the
PLO whould be invited to take part.
Syria accepted wording
Diplomatic sources and Syria had
accepted the wording of the resolu
tion, and U.S. Ambassador Daniel P.
Moynihan told a reporter he had "fi

nally got it all together."
The compromise resolution —
proposed by Guyana, Cameroon,
Mauritania and Tanzania — extends
the peacekeeping mandate six months
and calls for a "debate on the Middle
East problem including the Palesti
nian question, taking into account all
relevant United Nations resolutions."
The United States rejected an earlier
proposal which had mentioned "re
levant General Assembly" resolutions
because of a Nov. 10 resolution by the
General Assembly which said the PLO
was to be invited to all U.N. delibera
tions on the Middle East.
An Arab diplomat explained the
American haggling over the PLO par
ticipation by saying, "They know they
can't stop it but they don't want to be
associated with it."
Unconditional consent
Israel had consented uncondition
ally to extending the life of the U.N.
Golan Heights force, and Israeli
Foreign Minister Yigal Allon said in
Jerusalem that "Syria and its suppor
ters in the Security Council will carry
the responsibility if the mandate is not
extended."

Moynihan and Syrian Ambassador
Mouaffak Allaf stepped in Saturday
night after nonaligned members of the
council failed to produce a resolution
that would work. For two days the
nonaligned members, with one assist
from France, dreamed up one formula
after another but none that both sides
would buy.

The Americans insisted that the
presidential statement on the PLO par
ticipation in the debate say it was the
understanding of "a majority of the
council" instead of the understanding
of "the council." It left the United
States free to say it was in a minority
that did not share such an understand
ing.
