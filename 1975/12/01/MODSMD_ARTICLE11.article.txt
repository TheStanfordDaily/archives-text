# Financial aid incentives: new questions
## 
### 
The issue of minority admissions and fi
nancial aid is not so easily resolved as either
its opponents or proponents would like to
believe it is.
That the two areas, admission and finan
cial aid, are dependently connected should
not be taken for granted, as was the case last
year during the discussion of policy
changes.
But when Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon begins with the assumption that fi
nancial aid "should be used to enhance the
University academically," it is clear that
from the University's perspective this con
nection exists.
Of course, Hargadon's contention must be
seriously questioned, as it has been most
recently by the so-called Howard report and
by the Daily Editorial Board.
It is important to understand the
University's financial aid allocation system
in order to access its impact.
Self-help and loans
The amount of money that the University
expects the students' parents to pay is ini
tially determined, based strictly on need.
Aid is then given by a combination of a
scholarship and "self-help," the latter of
which the student pays by working or tak
ing a loan.
One area of controversy involves those
students in the top five percent academi
cally (classified IIA) who have one half to
two-thirds less self-help requirements than
other students on aid. It is clear that they
receive preferential treatment.
But it is doubtful that these students are

attracted to Stanford because of its aid pack
age, rather than other considerations such
as academic quality. I have not seen any
statistics to verify that aid is an important
consideration when choosing a college
among those considered most academically
inclined.

Furthermore, whether Stanford should
attempt to attract those students with high
CPAs and SAT scores by offering financial
inducements regardless of whether aid in
fluences one's decision is highly debatable.
Student diversity
Another area of disagreement surrounds
those students in the "IIB" category who are
considered to be important to attract to the
University for so-called "diverse reasons."
such as outstanding achievement in music.
The students in this group are expected to
pay almost twice as much self-help as those
most academically "talented," but pay quite
a bit less than those in the "IIC" category
(students with average qualifications). The
same objections raised above apply here.
The greatest controversy surrounds aid to

minority students, who must pay four-fifths
of the self-help expected in each category.
One argument used last year to support this
special consideration was that it was an in
dication that the University is interested in
attracting minority students.
Indeed, those minority students in the lIC
category would be paying only slightly
more than students in 118, who were consi
dered worthy of attracting for various
reasons.
But there are a lot better reasons to give
special consideration in financial aid to cer
tain groups or individuals than simply to
attract them to Stanford, as if the University
couldn't attract qualified students regard
less.
Disadvantaged persons
One of the best reasons seems to be that
those who come from disadvantaged back
grounds would benefit greatly by being able
to spend more time studying and less time
working to pay for his or her education.
Whether or not it is possible to judge stu
dents on an individual basis to determine
how disadvantaged the person is remains
highly questionable. But that's another arti
cle.
Unless cogent arguments are presented to
justify giving financial aid as an incentiveto
attract students the University considers
desirable to attract, the current system
should be changed.
