# Resolution has deeper meaning

### 
The United Nations' anti-
Zionism resolution has encour
aged reactions rooted in errone
ous assumptions from both
Zionists and anti-Zionists.
To clearly understand the re
solution, an understanding
about Zionism is essential. It is
also very important to under
stand how the anti-Zionism re
solution addresses itself to solv
ing the Middle East conflict.
Zionism is Jewish
nationalism, but Zionism in
cludes more than nationalistic
ideology. Zionism is three mill

ion Jews living in Israel today.
The reality of the Middle East
politics is that Israel is not wil
ling to be diplomatically re
placed by a "Democratic Secular
Palestinian State." The only
means for replacing Israel with
another state is exterminating Is
rael.
Created in 1948 by the United
Nations, Israel is entitled to
self-determination. No political
or diplomatic action short of war
will eliminate Israel and
Zionism because Israel has a
legitimate right to exist.
Zionist elimination
The Arab solution to the Mid
dle East conflict is the elimina
tion of Zionism. The resolution
that was passed, accepted the
principle that "international
cooperation and peace require
the achievement of national lib
eration and independence, the
elimination of colonialism and
neocolonialism, foreign occupa
tion. Zionism, apartheid, and ra
cial discrimination in all its
forms as well as the recognition
of the dignity of peoples and
their right to self
determination."
This excerpt from the anti-
Zionism resolution is contradic
tory because it states that inter
national peace can be achieved
by eliminating Zionism. We do
not need any profound insight to
realize that Zionism cannot be
eliminated peacefully.
The history of war in the Mid
dle East during the past 27 years
is indicative of the method
needed to eliminate Zionism.
There have been no significant
political changes to suggest that
at this time diplomacy can be ef
fectively used to physically
eliminate Israel.
More contradictions
The other contradictory part of
the resolution is that the resolu

tion calls for the elimination of
Zionism while at the same time
it recognizes the dignity of peo
ples and their right to self
determination.
Is there any possible way that
Zionism could be eliminated
and at the same time affirm the
dignity of Israel and its right to
self-determination? It strains my
imagination to conceptualize
such a plan.
Anti-Semetism does not mean
being critical of either Israel or
Judaism. Anti-Semetism means
demanding something from the
Jew that is not demanded of
other people.
In South Africa, apartheid can
be eliminated without eliminat
ing South Africa. In Israel, the
elimination of Zionism means
the elimination of Israel as a
state.
The real tragedy of the anti-
Zionist resolution is not its effect
on the United States or Israel; the
tragic effect is on the Palestinian.
The grounds of moderation and
compromise have been terribly
eroded by this resolution.
Reluctance on land
It is obvious that Israel will be
terribly reluctant to give up more
land or to make important com
promises when the intentions of
the Arab states are clear. No
political compromise can eradi
cate Zionism, and so the Middle
East conflict is deadlocked and
stagnant.
The Palestinian living in re
fugee camps under Arab regimes
(there are no refugee camps in
Israel) will continue to exist in a
pitiful condition. The world will
see more terror from the Palesti
nians because they have no op
tions.
The Palestinian has been man
ipulated by the Arab govern
ments, and the Palestinian
seems condemned to refugee

status because the Arab govern
ments are not willing to com
promise with Israel.
The Middle East conflict is not
characterized by one side being
right and the other side being
wrong.
The conflict involves both
Palestinian and Israeli with
legitimate rights and claims. The
only solution achieved peace
fully will entail a compromise by
both sides, and the solution will
not be achieved through
eliminating the Israeli for the
sake of the Palestinian.
