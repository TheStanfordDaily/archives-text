Kudos for Miller
Editor:
Financial panic among uni
versities can happen. Columbia
sold some of its land to gain $5
million dollars in new revenue.
Brown's endowment has been
used for operating expenses and
it has now been depleted to a
level that is dangerous.
At Cornell the conflict bet
ween the "faculty" and the "ad
ministration" continues and a
report now recommends that
Cornell proceed with the dissol
ution of its Academic Senate.
At Stanford panic does not
happen. We learned from the last
meeting of the Board of Trustees
on Nov. 11 that our shor
tage for the operating budget has
been reduced from a projected
level of $1.6 million to a much
lower figure of $216,000.
Why is it different here at
Stanford? Part of the answer
(and in my opinion the major
part) is the attention given to
fiscal affairs by Provost William
Miller. He has devoted his ener
gies to the financial problems of
our University and it is now
clear that his program for budget
control is logical and effective.
The work necessary to solve
these problems is something that
most of us would find difficult.
He deserves our gratitude for
doing it so well.

Asians oppose mascot
Editor:
Although it is true that we
Asian-American students have
no real sense of the torment the
Native-Americans on campus
feel, we can definitely relate to
the use of ethnic names in de
rogatory stereotypes.
Because we understand that
the selection of the Indian was
arbitrary in that any ethnic
group could have been selected
as the mascot, we cannot help
but denounce the use of ethnic
names in such a capacity.
Therefore, let it be known that
because Native-Americans vig
orously oppose the return of the
Indian as Stanford's athletic
symbol, the Stanford Asian Stu
dents Coordinating Committee
supports their efforts wholehear
tedly and encourages the Stan
ford community to oppose the
return of the mascot.

Majority not right
Editor:
Much of what William Ross
said in his Nov. 25 Daily
column, "Vote on Indian not
warranted" makes sense. How
ever, I would like to carry Ross's
argument a few steps further.
Whether or nbt Notre Dame's
"Fighting Irish" mascot was
selected by persons of Irish des
cent is not important. That mas
cot should be abandoned for it
stereotypes the Irish person as a
drunken, brawling "mick" who
must be hauled off in a paddy
wagon.
This vulgar stereotype is of
fensive to any sensitive and ware
person.
Indeed, any mascot name that
stereotypes any group of people,
living or dead, should be elimi
nated. The roots of ethnic and
racial discrimination are in such
stereotypes.
