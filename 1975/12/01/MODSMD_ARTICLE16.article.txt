# Businesses plan to leave Berkeley

BERKELEY (AP) â€” After a fi
nancially sour season, many
Berkeley businesses, also tired of
being hounded by the famous
university city's highly vocal
minority, are thinking of getting
out of town.
A poll conducted by
Berkeley's planning department
found 12 percent definitely pre
paring to leave and another 25
percent thinking about it.
Ninety percent say high taxes
are driving business out of what
they feel has become a "hostile"
community.
The city has long been hailed
around the world as the home of
one of the most progressive
campuses of the University of
California.
With Berkeley's tax rate in
creasing 20 cents a year, federal
aid for the city is drying up at a
time when Berkeley leads the

state in total education tax as
sessments: $17 per 100 assessed
valuation.
That compares with $14.85 for
Oakland, $11.50 for San Fran
cisco and $13.13 for Hayward.
The high taxes discourage the
council from raising assess
ments, yet the city is predicted to
bein fora deficit ranging from $5
million to $13 million by 1983.
Paul Harberts, president of the
Berkeley Chamber of Commerce,
said. "Its difficult to make long
range plans. We don't know
where the city is being led."
UC journalism Prof. Joseph
Lyford says Berkeley is a fairly
intolerant city in which he finds
"great posturing" at the political
level.
"The city council is not good
at resisting the tumultuous
minorities," he said.
