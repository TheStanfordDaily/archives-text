SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
sheriff of Sacramento County
wants a $76,500 federal grant to
fight what he calls a "very real
threat" of terrorism in the state
capital during the 1976 bi
centennial celebration.
Duane Lowe said the money
would help create a three-man
"Urban Terrorism Investigation
Unit."
Lowe, in an interview yester
day in the Sacramento Bee, said
he fears for the safety of top state
officials during 1976.
He said he has warned Cov.
Edmund Brown Jr.'s security
chief "to be careful" and to re
mind the governor that "he is not
invulnerable."
Lowe cited comments from
state and federal authorities that
political terrorism will increase
during the U.S. bicentennial.
"We suspect — from intellig

ence we've received — that the
entire state of California is
smouldering with urban
guerilla-tvpe attitudes." Lowe
said.
"I'm particularly concerned,
since this is the seat of govern
ment. Here's where all the state's
constitutional officers reside —
right here in this community.
"I think the threat is very
real." he added.
"We've got to get a handle on
it. find out what's happening.
The grant will give us funds to
evaluate it. Is there a real threat?
And if so, how great is it?"
The grant application to the
U.S. Law Enforcement Assis
tance Administration was first
submitted last May and has been
approved by the Sacramento Re
gional Area Planning Commis
sion.
