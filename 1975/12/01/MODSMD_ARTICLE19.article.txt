## Cagers sweep first two games 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Last year it took a "Maples
Miracle," consecutive wins over
UCLA and USC, to get fans really
enthused about Stanford basket
ball. That lasted for about a
week.
Well, lo and behold, there
were the fans on their feet at Ma
ples Saturday night raising an
uproar after guard Mike Bratz
had made two consecutive steals
in Stanford's first official game
of the season. And again when
junior college transfer George
Schader missed a shot, pulled
down his own rebound in a
crowd and put up another shot,
this time good.
Something about the 1975-76
Cards is different. Maybe it's
first-year Head Coach Dick Di-
Biaso. Maybe it's his coaching

philosophy of teamwork, hustle
and opportunistic play. Or
maybe it's the new Cards —
freshmen Wolfe Perry and Paul
Giovacchini, and JC transfers
Schader and Jeff McHugh.
All seemed tocontributealong
with holdovers Bratz, Ed
Schweitzer and Tim Patterson,
to Stanford's exhibition win over
the Australian National Olympic
team, 89-75, Wednesday night,
and its official victory over the
University of Nevada at Reno,
94-70, Saturday.
Mr. Dutside
Bratz may have emerged as the
outside shooter Stanford has
sought for so long. The 6-foot-2
junior made 15 of 25 field goal
attempts, almost all from the
outside, for 33 points in the two
games, and added 12 assists.

After a somewhat languid first
half against Reno, Bratz revived
the Cards. "We said we had to do
something to change," Dißiaso
said, "but ive didn't do it. Bratz
did."
Stanford led all the way after
the first few minutes, but Reno
came to within one point at
56-55 with 12:50 remaining.
Then Bratz went to work.
Sets up
First came a steal to set up a
Perry layin. Bratz subsequently
made another theft and Stanford
scord again. Bratz then hit a
16-foot jumper, was fouled and
made the free throw to complete
the three-point play. After one
more Bratz basket, this one from
20 feet, Stanford was up 69-59
and the Cards progressively
added to that margin the rest of

the game.
The Cards took an early lead in
the first half, scoring 15 straight
points to lead 19-7 as the Wolf
Pack went into hibernation.
Reno woke up with about 13 mi
nutes left in the half and got the
ball inside to center Edgar Jones
and forward Herb Billups.
Long bounds
That worked for a while, but
the Wolf Pack couldn't use Jones
as much as it might have. Patter
son, Schweitzer and Schader
clogged up the middle effec
tively and, as Dißiaso said,
"Reno took long shots, and with
long shots, you get long re
bounds."
Jones' inexperience inhibited
his own effectiveness. The 6-10
freshman from New Jersey, who
averaged 14 blocked shots a

game last year in high school,
jumps as if he's on a trampoline
— not a hardwood floor. Jones
can block most any shot from
any position and usually did
against Stanford. His aerial an
tics resulted in a gift of at least 10
points to the Cards on goaltend
ing calls.
Jones criticized the two offi
cials after the game. "They ain't
used to nobody jumping. Stan-

ford played well — all seven of
them."
Where's dad?
About Patterson, who was
guarding him most of the night,
Jones said, "Which one of the re
ferees is his father?"
Jones and 6-8 Pete Padget,
who has led the West Coast Ath
letic Conference in rebounds
three consecutive years, were
expected to dominate in that de
partment, but Schweitzer and
Schader outplayed them under
the boards. Schweitzer led both
teams with 12 rebounds, while
Schader pulled down nine,
Padgett 11 and Jones eight.
Stanford shot well all evening,
especially in the second half
when the Cards hit on 59 percent
of their field goal attempts.
Schweitzer led all scorers with

24 points on eight of 13 from the
field. Schader, who missed his
first nine shots against Australia,
muscled his way to the basket to
score and showed finesse from
the perimeter in totalling 22
points in just 25 minutes on
eight of 15 shots and six of six
from that line. McHugh, 6-8
played less but showed good
mobility scoring from medium
range.
Stanford overcame a slow start
and terrible free throw shooting
(46 percent) to defeat Australia
Wednesday. Leading only 41-40
at halftime, the Cards later got
the fast break going behind Bratz
and Giovacchini to pull away.
Patterson led the Cards with
19 points on nine of 12 from the
floor. Perry, whose Marques
Johnson-like moves may make

him Stanford's most crowd
pleasing player, scored 12 points
off the bench.
Dißiaso substituted freely, to
say the least, in both games and
plans to continue to do so. He
demands intensity and periodi
cally rests his players to help
them retain it. His shuttle system
is a masterpiece of rapid transit
technology, as players leave and
enter with remarkable regular
ity. BART should be as efficient.
The Cards will help Santa
Clara dedicate its Thomas Leavv
Activities Center in a game
against the Broncos at 8 tonight.
Santa Clara will present a variety
of sports demonstrations and
exhibitions beginning at 6 p.m.
to show the versatility of the new
facility.
