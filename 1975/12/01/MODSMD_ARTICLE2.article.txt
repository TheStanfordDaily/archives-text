# Budget interactions seen as equitable
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Current budgetary interactions bet
ween Stanford's central administra
tion and various professional schools
here are generally equitable, con
cludes a recent report by Task Force VI
of the University Budget Priorities
Commission.
"We found no indication that any
thing is really out of line," said
Aeronautics and Astronautics Prof.
Daniel Bershader, head of the task
force. "I think we made a serious at
tempt to examine the budgetary rela
tionships between the administration
and the schools, and it looks like a
pretty good job is being done there."
Despite overall satisfaction with the
status quo, the task force recom
mended, among other things, the es
tablishment of a special group to re
view the budgetary guidelines and
procedures of the School of
Humanities and Sciences (H&S).
Such a group would be composed of
members of the University Budget
Priorities Commission, President
Richard Lyman and Provost William
Miller.
ABF system
H&S is one school that is not under
an "allocation by formula" (ABF) sys
tem of fund allocation. ABF, according
to Bershader, basically represents a
multi-year type of fund allocation.
Other schools not on ABF operate
under "income from 'general funds'
(obtained) via year-to-year negotia
tions with the University." he said.
The Stanford Schools of Business
and Medicine are currently under the
ABF system.
The task force report found that
"schools .... excepting H&S. not on
ABF arrangements feel that their
yearly budget negotiations with the
provost and his staff result in generally
equitable general funds financing,
considering the budgetary restrictions
being faced by Stanford University.
"The deans of these schools see no
important advantages of ABF and do
not presently desire such arrange
ments," the report added.
However, another task force recom
mendation suggested the "implemen

tation of two or three-year budget
planning at various levels in the non-
ABF schools."
H&S is special
Consideration of H&S was disting
uished from other schools by the task
force "because of its central position
and function in the University . . . and
because of its size and conglomerate
composition."
Citing a study done by Vice Presi
dent Fred Terman, the task force listed
various advantages and disadvantages
of the ABF system.
Advantages included better basis for
long range budget planning, max
imum incentive for developing in
come sources and improving produc
tivity of the associated school.
Disadvantages included the fact that
poor fundraising or poor expenditure
control must be borne by the particular
school under ABF, whereas without
ABF, it would be borne by the Univer
sity.
Recommendations
The report made various recom
mendations changing H&S budgetary
procedures without necessarily put
ting that school on a formula basis of
income allocation. Those recommen
dations included:
— providing H&S with a longer
budgetary time frame "to give it more
predictability for planning purposes."
— considering a reduction of the
"line item control" by the provost over
H&S budget requests.
— providing greater incentives to
H&S as a whole and to individual de
partments within H&S.
— giving the H&S dean greater au
tonomy and incentives for improving
efficiency, rationalizing programs, re
ducing number of courses, enhancing
use of faculty, etc.
The task force also discussed the
terminology of the funding systems. It
finally recommended that the Univer
sity "consider a better terminology to
replace 'allocation by formula,' " find
ing the word "formula" unsuitable.
