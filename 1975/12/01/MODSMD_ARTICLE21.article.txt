# Rose Bowl wrapup
## Bruins sneak in 
### CHRIS BAKER 
LOS ANCELES—It was not a
very nice evening for football in
the Memorial Coliseum. Eighty
thousand fans huddled in their
seats, warming their hands,
watching one of the most inartis
tic football games in Pacific
Eight history.
UCLA won 25-22, but it didn't
deserve to. Then again neither
did USC. The Bruins fumbled
the ball a record 11 times and
lost eight of them. The Trojans
cashed in on only once, on Kicky
Bell's second touchdown and a
Bell two-point conversion,
which made the score 25-22 as
the fourth quarter opened. At
that point it looked like USC
could still pull it off and send
California to the Rose Bowl.
First Bruin kicker Brett White
missed a 44-yard field goal, but
USC had to punt. Then UCLA
halfback Wendell Tyler fumbled
the ball away for the fourth time.
Tyler was pulled after this mis
cue, but he had a good night
when he was able to hold on,

earring 17 times for 130 yards to
break Kermitt Johnson's one sea
son UCLA rushing record of
1129.
But USC missed a 52-yard
field goal attempt. Still it looked
like the Trojans would somehow
manage to win it, much as they
had done for 16 years under
lame-duck coach John McKay.
White, continuing his attempt to
win goat-of-the-game honors,
fumbled a wide snap in punt
formation, and IJSC's Rod Mar
tin picked it up at the UCLA 18
and ran it into the endzone.
But faster than USC mascot
Traveler II could race onto the
field, officials signaled that it
wasn't a touchdown; college
rules don't allow running with a
fumble.
SC still couldn't take it in, as
Vince Evans, who had passed
well in the first quarter, threw
two incompletions in an O-for-14
streak.
So 3V2 minutes remained and
all UCLA had to do was maintain
control of the ball. Then came
fumble number eight, this one
committed by Kenny Lee, who
entered the game when Tyler
was pulled.
USC needed only a field goal
to tie the game and send the
J'ac-B's best representative-Cal
to Pasadena. After three succes
sive Evans incompletes, he fi
nally managed to hit Dennis
Thurman for 22 yards and get a
first down by a yard.
Evans found Bell on a swing
pass for seven yards and Bell
raced out of bounds at the IJCLA
37 to stop the clock at 0:34. From
there UCLA somehow managed
to hold and with 21 seconds
UCLA had the ball again. It was
all over.
U-C-L-A is in the Rose Bowl
for the first time since 1966 and
Cal is going nowhere.
It was anything but a good
night for McKay, who:
—lost his final USC game in

the Coliseum.
—dropped four conference
games in a row, the first time this
has happened to USC since
1922.
—saw his Heisman Trophy
candidate. Ricky Bell, fall six
yards short of Ed Marinaro's
NCAA season rushing mark. Bell
gained 136 yards against the
Bruins, giving him 1881 for the
season.
