# Rose Bowl wrapup
## Bruins sneak in 
### CHRIS BAKER 
LOS ANCELES—It was not a
very nice evening for football in
the Memorial Coliseum. Eighty
thousand fans huddled in their
seats, warming their hands,
watching one of the most inartis
tic football games in Pacific
Eight history.
UCLA won 25-22, but it didn't
deserve to. Then again neither
did USC. The Bruins fumbled
the ball a record 11 times and
lost eight of them. The Trojans
cashed in on only once, on Kicky
Bell's second touchdown and a
Bell two-point conversion,
which made the score 25-22 as
the fourth quarter opened. At
that point it looked like USC
could still pull it off and send
California to the Rose Bowl.
First Bruin kicker Brett White
missed a 44-yard field goal, but
USC had to punt. Then UCLA
halfback Wendell Tyler fumbled
the ball away for the fourth time.
Tyler was pulled after this mis
cue, but he had a good night
when he was able to hold on,

earring 17 times for 130 yards to
break Kermitt Johnson's one sea
son UCLA rushing record of
1129.
But USC missed a 52-yard
field goal attempt. Still it looked
like the Trojans would somehow
manage to win it, much as they
had done for 16 years under
lame-duck coach John McKay.
White, continuing his attempt to
win goat-of-the-game honors,
fumbled a wide snap in punt
formation, and IJSC's Rod Mar
tin picked it up at the UCLA 18
and ran it into the endzone.
But faster than USC mascot
Traveler II could race onto the
field, officials signaled that it
wasn't a touchdown; college
rules don't allow running with a
fumble.
SC still couldn't take it in, as
Vince Evans, who had passed
well in the first quarter, threw
two incompletions in an O-for-14
streak.
So 3V2 minutes remained and
all UCLA had to do was maintain
