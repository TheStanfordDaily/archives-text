# Grapplers go tomorrow
## 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
Popular interest in wrestling has come a long
way since the days when Gorgeous George was
the only wrestler readily identifiable by the
American public. During the last Olympiad col
legians such as Dan Gable and Chris Taylor
created an enthused national following for
amateur wrestling.
Those who seek the same kind of excitement
that Gable, Taylor, and others provided in Munich
should make a point to come out and watch
Stanford's grapplers open the home season to
morrow night against Stanislaus State and
Sonoma State. The matches begin at 7:30 in the
Encina Gym.
Tomorrow night will be the first chance Stan
ford wrestling followers have had to watch prom
ising freshman Jim Spangler of Santa Clara.
Spangler, an all-state wrestler in high school,
will be trying to fill the shoes of graduated stand
out Ken Krebs in the 142-pound weight class.
Spangler was injured early last week, but Coach
Joe DeMeo expects him to be ready to go tomorrow
night.
Two Stanford wrestling veterans, Craig
Reynolds and Roy Tolles, will be putting unde

feated marks on the line tomorrow night. Both
emerged unscathed from earlier matches with San
Jose State and Sacramento State.
Wrestling Notes: Sophomore Gary Lynn, one of
this year's brightest prospects, will probably not
havea chance to step on the mat this season. Lynn,
a backup running back for the Cardinal gridders,
incurred an ankle injury during the Big Game
which required an operation last week. It is ex
pected to sideline him for the entire season.
