# Poloists fourth in NCAA tourney
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
LOS ANGELES — The arena
at Belmont Plaza Olympic Pools
suddenly grew quiet as the last
of the crowd filed out. Only the
members of the Stanford varsity
water polo team remained. Some
were standing, some sitting, but
all of their faces, including the
face of second-year Stanford
coach Art Lambert, showed the
same thing — the look of defeat.
The Cards had just lost their
NCAA semifinal game to UC Ir
vine, 9-8. Stanford finished
fourth behind third-year NCAA
champion Cal, the best showing
by a Stanford water polo squad
and two nptches better than last
year's sixth-place finish. The
Cards, however, wanted it all,
and they were possibly one goal
away from having it, too.
Stanford teams traditionally
don't seem to understand what
the word "underdog" means.
UC-lrvine was the definite favo
rite against the Cards since the
Aggies have three players, in
cluding their goalie, who have
played for the national team.
These odds were enhanced,
since Stanford had lost its lead
ing scorer Doug Burke because
of an eye injury and had three
freshmen competing in the
NCAAs, two of whom were to
play a majority of the time for the
Cards.
More problems
Stanford's problems were not
to end here, however. The Cards
seemed to be outnumbered all
night and if that didn't help their
chances, the fact that they lost
three different players, includ

ing two starters, after goals that
brought them to within one
point of the Aggies, surely
didn't.
Overall, the officials called 12
ejection fouls, which were criti
cal when considering the times
at which they were called.
Twelve times the opposition had
a man advantage on offense, and
due to the goaltending of Chris
Dorst and steals by Drew
McDonald. Irvine capitalized on
only half of them.
Stanford, having to play
catch-up since the beginning of
the second quarter, pulled
within a goal at 7-6 on Paul
Clark's score with a minute gone
in the fourth quarter. Only a few
seconds later, freshman Tommy
Angelo left the game with his
third ejection, to join captain
John Paul Roberts on the bench.
Roberts had been called for his
third foul right after Marty
Davis' score had drawn the
Cards to within one goal at 6-5.
No score
UCI could not score on the op
portunity, however, as
McDonald implemented one of
his many steals that stopped
Irvine's man-advantage situa
tion. Johannsen then became the
third Card, and second in a mi
nute and a half, to be thrown out.
The Aggies took the advantage
this time to extend their lead to
8-6.
The Cards still had two mi
nutes left for that familiar Stan
ford miracle, but it never hap
pened Friday night. Davis' shot,
when Stanford had a man advan
tage, ricocheted off the top of the
net. With 36 seconds left,
McDonald brought the Cards to
within one goal at 9-8, but Irvine
managed to run out the clock
and with that the Cardinals'
championship hopes.
"I have never been more proud
of a team than I have been with
this one. Never during the game
did they give up. They deserved
this game, but the officiating was

the poorest I've ever seen." said
coach Art Lambert.
Cards on top
As was the Cardinal trademark
during the season against Irvine.
Stanford jumped out for the first
lead on a goal by Johannsen with
only a minute and a half gone in
the game, but were caught at 2-2
as an Irvine shot spun in off the
hand of goalie Dorst to neut
ralize Johannsen'stwo first quar
ter scores, and mark the last time
that the Cards were to keep pace
with UCI.
In the Cards' next battle
against UCLA for third place, the
Cards seemed to act out the old
Stanford script of the night be
fore. The Cards scored first on a
bullet from McDonald with two
minutes to go in the first quarter
but lost captain Roberts and sub
sequently their first quarter lead
when the official ruled that
Roberts had made an illegal
entry into the pool, giving him
his second ejection.
UCLA's three second-period
scores gave the Bruins a 3-1 half
time lead. The third quarter was
conversely all Stanford. The
Cards pulled up even with the
Bruins on scores by McDonald
and a penalty shot by Davis to tie
the score at 3-3.
Refs come on
But in the fourth quarter, enter
the referees. Stanford lost
Roberts for the game and the
second time in the tournament
on a four-meter violation with
only a minute and a half gone in
the period. Stanford managed to
pull even on another penalty
shot by Davis, but four minutes
later the Cards fell behind to stay
on two UCLA tallies to make the
score 6-4.
During this time Stanford had
two more obvious scoring op
portunities than did the Bruins
but could not convert them.
Analogous to the Irviile game,
Clark's goal with 29 seconds re
maining gave the Cards one last
flicker of light but the Bruins

quickly doused that as they stal
led the remaining seconds for
the victory.
"I just don't know how many
ways you can lose a waterpolo
game. We could have scored like
that last Clark goal all day. but
we weren't alert enough to hit
the open man." said Lambert.
"We just beat ourselves."
In the Cards'opening and only
tournament victory, 15-3 over
Arizona. Roberts and Johannsen
led the balanced Stanford offen
sive attack with three goals
apiece while goalie Frank
Forencich did not allow an

Arizona score until two and a
half minutes left in the first half.
"1 just wish that we could have
won the championship for John
(Roberts) and Tom (Elson). They
have contributed so much to this
team." said Lambert. "1 thought
that the freshmen that we
brought really did fine. The ma
jority of our playing time had a
squad mainly of sophomores
and freshmen in the pool." Hello
ing Lambert's overall senti
ments. one departing Stanford
fan said, "Just wait until next
vear."
