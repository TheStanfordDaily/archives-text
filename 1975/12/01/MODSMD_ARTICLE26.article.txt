Allende's nephew sentenced to death
SANTIAGO, Chile — The underground Revolutionary Left
Movement yesterday condemned to death its two top leaders —
one of them a nephew of the late Marxist President Salvador
Allende — and ordered "its militants and . . . revolutionaries of
the entire world, to execute the sentences however, whenever and
where they can."
In a declaration sent from hiding to local newspapers and
foreign news agencies, the Central Committee of MIR, as it is
known by its Spanish initials, said Andres Pascal Allende. 32, the
leader of the organization, and his principal aide, Nelson Guiter
rez, 31, violated standing orders when they.sought asylum in two
Santiago diplomatic missions with their female companions Nov.
7.
The declaration said both men were expelled from MIR "for
life" and charged with "treason against the party, the working
class and the people and also desertion and cowardice."
In addition to being expelled from the party, Pascal Allende
and Guiterrez — both founders of MIR in 1965 — were con
demned to death for "gravely damaging the development of the
Chilean and worldwide revolutionary movement and also for the
fact that their seeking of asylum effectively helps the junta dic
tatorship."
Spanish amnesty branded 'an insult'
MADRID — Spain's most powerful leftist, Marcelino Camacho,
was released from prison yesterday by King Juan Carlos and
immediately denounced the king's amnesty as "an insult."
Camacho said he would lead a campaign to free all political
prisoners, even if it means prison again. He charged the amnesty
decreed by the new Spanish leader last week affected only 10
percent of the nation's estimated 2000 political prisoners.
"This famous amnesty is an insult," Camacho told a news
conference a few hours after his release.
Meeting with foreign newsmen in Madrid lawyer's office,
Camacho said the giant underground trade union network he
heads also opposes the monarchy as a replacement for 36 years of
iron-fisted rule by Gen. Francisco Franco.
"The prince swore to uphold the principles of the regime. The
principles are nothing but Fascism and I have been fighting that
all my life." the 57-year-old labor organizer said.
Democratic mayors adopt urban plan
MIAMI BEACH — Democratic mayors adopted an urban policy
statement yesterday in their first effort to write a plank of the
party's national platform. The mayors also accused President
Ford and former President Richard Nixon of waging an unde
clared war on cities.
The National Conference of Democratic Mayors, formed two
years ago and claiming 1100 members, adopted the policy state
ment by a series of voice votes. In brief debate they rejected an
effort to water down a call for national health insurance and
added an amendment to endorse enforcement of court-ordered
school desegregation, including busing.
The mayors, now formally an adjunct to the Democratic Na
tional Committee, hope to have their document written into the
party's 197(: national platform.
"In 1972 the urban issue was the forgotten issue of the cam

paign, and we're here to see that that doesn't happen again," said
Mayor Henry Maier of Milwaukee, president of the conference.

Israel gives oil fields
r
ABU RUDEIS, Sinai Desert — Israel surrendered the last of its
' oil production yesterday morning, giving up the million-dollar
a-day Abu Rudeis oilfields for return to Egypt.
* At a kitchen table set up in the sand, the Israelis signed over the
J 'Gulf of Suez oil corridor— which they captured more than eight
i years ago — to Italian technicians and U.N. troops to hold for 24
hours.
J Under the Sept. 1 truce accord engineered by Secretary of State
■ Henry A. Kissinger, Egyptian civilian authorities return today to
the 72-mile strip of desert they lost in the 1967 Middle East war.
r Relinquishing the 86 Abu Rudeis wells leaves Israel totally
'■> dependent on oil from Iran, and an American guarantee that fuel
supplies will be maintained despite boycotts or shortages.
i "We were running a business of one million dollars a day here,"
" said Elisha Roih, Israel's field manager at Abu Rudeis.
! "But the sacrifice isn't the money — it's the oil," he told news
! men. "Oil is energy, and energy is independence and security."
Abu Rudeis and the Ras Sudr fields to the north, which Israel
surrendered to Egypt last month, were virtually Israel's only oil
source, supplying more than half the country's oil needs since
1967. The Israelis have pumped more than 250 million barrels
from the fields.
Ford travels to China
ANCHORAGE — President Ford headed for China via Japan
yesterday after altering a speech text to suggest he stands with
Peking in opposing a Soviet military expansion in Asia.
In remarks he prepared for an appearance Saturday in Fair
; banks, Alaska, Ford spoke of a basic mutual American-Chinese
"pledge to peace in Asia."
In delivering the address to some 5000 well-wishers, however,
the President dropped the reference to peace and said instead,
"Our mutual opposition to military expansion in Asia is basic."
In Chinese eyes, at least, any talk of opposing military expan
sion is taken as an unmistakable reference to the Soviet Union,
which maintains large numbers of troops along its sometimes
disputed border with China.
Earthquake, tidal wave sweep Hawaii
HILO, Hawaii — "I was stuck. I was drowning. Somehow I just
came out free."
From his hospital bed here, 13-year-old Timothy Twigg-Smith
remembered desperate moments of shaking, falling land and on
> rushing sea water at Halape Beach where one man was killed and
another reported missing during earthquakes and tidal waves
Saturday.
It was the only loss of life reported as the island of Hawaii — the
largest in the Hawaiian chain — was jolted by sharp tremors and
hit by huge waves. Property damage was estimated at more than
$1 million.
Police said Dr. James Mitchel of Hilo was killed in the Halape
Beach incident and Michael Cruz, 26, of Mountain View, Hawaii,
was reported missing after part of the beach plunged below sea

level.
Chris Cameron, chief ranger at Hawaii Volcanoes National
Park, said the coastal land fell below sea level as the island was
rocked by a quake that registered 7.2 on the Richter scale. Water
surged across campgrounds, sweeping most of some three dozen
campers to higher grounds.
The geological spasms began at 3:36 a.m. Saturday with a quake
registering 5.5 on the Richter scale. It was followed at 4:48 a.m. by
the 7.2 shock, which broke windows in downtown Hilo and
shook buildings in Honolulu. 200 miles awav.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number, for example from
5.5 to 6.5, means the ground motion is 10 times greater. Some
experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30 times
greater.
That jolt also triggered tidal waves and touched off a minor
eruption in the active Kilauea Crater, which burst out with 30 foot
lava fountains along a half mile long crack.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. A little warmer. Lows in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs both days mid 50s to lower 60s. Winds
variable to 15 mph.

Ford travels to China
ANCHORAGE — President Ford headed for China via Japan
yesterday after altering a speech text to suggest he stands with
Peking in opposing a Soviet military expansion in Asia.
In remarks he prepared for an appearance Saturday in Fair
; banks, Alaska, Ford spoke of a basic mutual American-Chinese
"pledge to peace in Asia."
In delivering the address to some 5000 well-wishers, however,
the President dropped the reference to peace and said instead,
"Our mutual opposition to military expansion in Asia is basic."
In Chinese eyes, at least, any talk of opposing military expan
sion is taken as an unmistakable reference to the Soviet Union,
which maintains large numbers of troops along its sometimes
disputed border with China.
Earthquake, tidal wave sweep Hawaii
HILO, Hawaii — "I was stuck. I was drowning. Somehow I just
came out free."
From his hospital bed here, 13-year-old Timothy Twigg-Smith
remembered desperate moments of shaking, falling land and on
> rushing sea water at Halape Beach where one man was killed and
another reported missing during earthquakes and tidal waves
Saturday.
It was the only loss of life reported as the island of Hawaii — the
largest in the Hawaiian chain — was jolted by sharp tremors and
hit by huge waves. Property damage was estimated at more than
$1 million.
Police said Dr. James Mitchel of Hilo was killed in the Halape
Beach incident and Michael Cruz, 26, of Mountain View, Hawaii,
was reported missing after part of the beach plunged below sea

level.
Chris Cameron, chief ranger at Hawaii Volcanoes National
Park, said the coastal land fell below sea level as the island was
rocked by a quake that registered 7.2 on the Richter scale. Water
surged across campgrounds, sweeping most of some three dozen
campers to higher grounds.
The geological spasms began at 3:36 a.m. Saturday with a quake
registering 5.5 on the Richter scale. It was followed at 4:48 a.m. by
the 7.2 shock, which broke windows in downtown Hilo and
shook buildings in Honolulu. 200 miles awav.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number, for example from
5.5 to 6.5, means the ground motion is 10 times greater. Some
experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30 times
greater.
That jolt also triggered tidal waves and touched off a minor
eruption in the active Kilauea Crater, which burst out with 30 foot
lava fountains along a half mile long crack.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. A little warmer. Lows in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs both days mid 50s to lower 60s. Winds
variable to 15 mph.
Allende's nephew sentenced to death
SANTIAGO, Chile — The underground Revolutionary Left
Movement yesterday condemned to death its two top leaders —
one of them a nephew of the late Marxist President Salvador
Allende — and ordered "its militants and . . . revolutionaries of
the entire world, to execute the sentences however, whenever and
where they can."
In a declaration sent from hiding to local newspapers and
foreign news agencies, the Central Committee of MIR, as it is
known by its Spanish initials, said Andres Pascal Allende. 32, the
leader of the organization, and his principal aide, Nelson Guiter
rez, 31, violated standing orders when they.sought asylum in two
Santiago diplomatic missions with their female companions Nov.
7.
The declaration said both men were expelled from MIR "for
life" and charged with "treason against the party, the working
class and the people and also desertion and cowardice."
In addition to being expelled from the party, Pascal Allende
and Guiterrez — both founders of MIR in 1965 — were con
demned to death for "gravely damaging the development of the
Chilean and worldwide revolutionary movement and also for the
fact that their seeking of asylum effectively helps the junta dic
tatorship."
Spanish amnesty branded 'an insult'
MADRID — Spain's most powerful leftist, Marcelino Camacho,
was released from prison yesterday by King Juan Carlos and
immediately denounced the king's amnesty as "an insult."
Camacho said he would lead a campaign to free all political
prisoners, even if it means prison again. He charged the amnesty
decreed by the new Spanish leader last week affected only 10
percent of the nation's estimated 2000 political prisoners.
"This famous amnesty is an insult," Camacho told a news
conference a few hours after his release.
Meeting with foreign newsmen in Madrid lawyer's office,
Camacho said the giant underground trade union network he
heads also opposes the monarchy as a replacement for 36 years of
iron-fisted rule by Gen. Francisco Franco.
"The prince swore to uphold the principles of the regime. The
principles are nothing but Fascism and I have been fighting that
all my life." the 57-year-old labor organizer said.
Democratic mayors adopt urban plan
MIAMI BEACH — Democratic mayors adopted an urban policy
statement yesterday in their first effort to write a plank of the
party's national platform. The mayors also accused President
Ford and former President Richard Nixon of waging an unde
clared war on cities.
The National Conference of Democratic Mayors, formed two
years ago and claiming 1100 members, adopted the policy state
ment by a series of voice votes. In brief debate they rejected an
effort to water down a call for national health insurance and
added an amendment to endorse enforcement of court-ordered
school desegregation, including busing.
The mayors, now formally an adjunct to the Democratic Na
tional Committee, hope to have their document written into the
party's 197(: national platform.
"In 1972 the urban issue was the forgotten issue of the cam

paign, and we're here to see that that doesn't happen again," said
Mayor Henry Maier of Milwaukee, president of the conference.

5.5 to 6.5, means the ground motion is 10 times greater. Some
experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30 times
greater.
That jolt also triggered tidal waves and touched off a minor

Allende's nephew sentenced to death
SANTIAGO, Chile — The underground Revolutionary Left
Movement yesterday condemned to death its two top leaders —
one of them a nephew of the late Marxist President Salvador
Allende — and ordered "its militants and . . . revolutionaries of
the entire world, to execute the sentences however, whenever and
where they can."
In a declaration sent from hiding to local newspapers and
foreign news agencies, the Central Committee of MIR, as it is
known by its Spanish initials, said Andres Pascal Allende. 32, the
leader of the organization, and his principal aide, Nelson Guiter
rez, 31, violated standing orders when they.sought asylum in two
Santiago diplomatic missions with their female companions Nov.
7.
The declaration said both men were expelled from MIR "for
life" and charged with "treason against the party, the working
class and the people and also desertion and cowardice."
In addition to being expelled from the party, Pascal Allende
and Guiterrez — both founders of MIR in 1965 — were con
demned to death for "gravely damaging the development of the
Chilean and worldwide revolutionary movement and also for the
fact that their seeking of asylum effectively helps the junta dic
tatorship."
Spanish amnesty branded 'an insult'
MADRID — Spain's most powerful leftist, Marcelino Camacho,
was released from prison yesterday by King Juan Carlos and
immediately denounced the king's amnesty as "an insult."
Camacho said he would lead a campaign to free all political
prisoners, even if it means prison again. He charged the amnesty
decreed by the new Spanish leader last week affected only 10
percent of the nation's estimated 2000 political prisoners.
"This famous amnesty is an insult," Camacho told a news
conference a few hours after his release.
Meeting with foreign newsmen in Madrid lawyer's office,
Camacho said the giant underground trade union network he
heads also opposes the monarchy as a replacement for 36 years of
iron-fisted rule by Gen. Francisco Franco.
"The prince swore to uphold the principles of the regime. The
principles are nothing but Fascism and I have been fighting that
all my life." the 57-year-old labor organizer said.
Democratic mayors adopt urban plan
MIAMI BEACH — Democratic mayors adopted an urban policy
statement yesterday in their first effort to write a plank of the
party's national platform. The mayors also accused President
Ford and former President Richard Nixon of waging an unde
clared war on cities.
The National Conference of Democratic Mayors, formed two
years ago and claiming 1100 members, adopted the policy state
ment by a series of voice votes. In brief debate they rejected an
effort to water down a call for national health insurance and
added an amendment to endorse enforcement of court-ordered
school desegregation, including busing.
The mayors, now formally an adjunct to the Democratic Na
tional Committee, hope to have their document written into the
party's 197(: national platform.
"In 1972 the urban issue was the forgotten issue of the cam

paign, and we're here to see that that doesn't happen again," said
Mayor Henry Maier of Milwaukee, president of the conference.

Israel gives oil fields
r
ABU RUDEIS, Sinai Desert — Israel surrendered the last of its
' oil production yesterday morning, giving up the million-dollar
a-day Abu Rudeis oilfields for return to Egypt.
* At a kitchen table set up in the sand, the Israelis signed over the
J 'Gulf of Suez oil corridor— which they captured more than eight
i years ago — to Italian technicians and U.N. troops to hold for 24
hours.
J Under the Sept. 1 truce accord engineered by Secretary of State
■ Henry A. Kissinger, Egyptian civilian authorities return today to
the 72-mile strip of desert they lost in the 1967 Middle East war.
r Relinquishing the 86 Abu Rudeis wells leaves Israel totally
'■> dependent on oil from Iran, and an American guarantee that fuel
supplies will be maintained despite boycotts or shortages.
i "We were running a business of one million dollars a day here,"
" said Elisha Roih, Israel's field manager at Abu Rudeis.
! "But the sacrifice isn't the money — it's the oil," he told news
! men. "Oil is energy, and energy is independence and security."
Abu Rudeis and the Ras Sudr fields to the north, which Israel
surrendered to Egypt last month, were virtually Israel's only oil
source, supplying more than half the country's oil needs since
1967. The Israelis have pumped more than 250 million barrels
from the fields.
Ford travels to China
ANCHORAGE — President Ford headed for China via Japan
yesterday after altering a speech text to suggest he stands with
Peking in opposing a Soviet military expansion in Asia.
In remarks he prepared for an appearance Saturday in Fair
; banks, Alaska, Ford spoke of a basic mutual American-Chinese
"pledge to peace in Asia."
In delivering the address to some 5000 well-wishers, however,
the President dropped the reference to peace and said instead,
"Our mutual opposition to military expansion in Asia is basic."
In Chinese eyes, at least, any talk of opposing military expan
sion is taken as an unmistakable reference to the Soviet Union,
which maintains large numbers of troops along its sometimes
disputed border with China.
Earthquake, tidal wave sweep Hawaii
HILO, Hawaii — "I was stuck. I was drowning. Somehow I just
came out free."
From his hospital bed here, 13-year-old Timothy Twigg-Smith
remembered desperate moments of shaking, falling land and on
> rushing sea water at Halape Beach where one man was killed and
another reported missing during earthquakes and tidal waves
Saturday.
It was the only loss of life reported as the island of Hawaii — the
largest in the Hawaiian chain — was jolted by sharp tremors and
hit by huge waves. Property damage was estimated at more than
$1 million.
Police said Dr. James Mitchel of Hilo was killed in the Halape
Beach incident and Michael Cruz, 26, of Mountain View, Hawaii,
was reported missing after part of the beach plunged below sea

level.
Chris Cameron, chief ranger at Hawaii Volcanoes National
Park, said the coastal land fell below sea level as the island was
rocked by a quake that registered 7.2 on the Richter scale. Water
surged across campgrounds, sweeping most of some three dozen
campers to higher grounds.
The geological spasms began at 3:36 a.m. Saturday with a quake
registering 5.5 on the Richter scale. It was followed at 4:48 a.m. by
the 7.2 shock, which broke windows in downtown Hilo and
shook buildings in Honolulu. 200 miles awav.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number, for example from

Israel gives oil fields
r
ABU RUDEIS, Sinai Desert — Israel surrendered the last of its
' oil production yesterday morning, giving up the million-dollar
a-day Abu Rudeis oilfields for return to Egypt.
* At a kitchen table set up in the sand, the Israelis signed over the
J 'Gulf of Suez oil corridor— which they captured more than eight
i years ago — to Italian technicians and U.N. troops to hold for 24
hours.
J Under the Sept. 1 truce accord engineered by Secretary of State
■ Henry A. Kissinger, Egyptian civilian authorities return today to
the 72-mile strip of desert they lost in the 1967 Middle East war.
r Relinquishing the 86 Abu Rudeis wells leaves Israel totally
'■> dependent on oil from Iran, and an American guarantee that fuel
supplies will be maintained despite boycotts or shortages.
i "We were running a business of one million dollars a day here,"
" said Elisha Roih, Israel's field manager at Abu Rudeis.
! "But the sacrifice isn't the money — it's the oil," he told news
! men. "Oil is energy, and energy is independence and security."
Abu Rudeis and the Ras Sudr fields to the north, which Israel
surrendered to Egypt last month, were virtually Israel's only oil
source, supplying more than half the country's oil needs since
1967. The Israelis have pumped more than 250 million barrels
from the fields.
Ford travels to China
ANCHORAGE — President Ford headed for China via Japan
yesterday after altering a speech text to suggest he stands with
Peking in opposing a Soviet military expansion in Asia.
In remarks he prepared for an appearance Saturday in Fair
; banks, Alaska, Ford spoke of a basic mutual American-Chinese
"pledge to peace in Asia."
In delivering the address to some 5000 well-wishers, however,
the President dropped the reference to peace and said instead,
"Our mutual opposition to military expansion in Asia is basic."
In Chinese eyes, at least, any talk of opposing military expan
sion is taken as an unmistakable reference to the Soviet Union,
which maintains large numbers of troops along its sometimes
disputed border with China.
Earthquake, tidal wave sweep Hawaii
HILO, Hawaii — "I was stuck. I was drowning. Somehow I just
came out free."
From his hospital bed here, 13-year-old Timothy Twigg-Smith
remembered desperate moments of shaking, falling land and on
> rushing sea water at Halape Beach where one man was killed and
another reported missing during earthquakes and tidal waves
Saturday.
It was the only loss of life reported as the island of Hawaii — the
largest in the Hawaiian chain — was jolted by sharp tremors and
hit by huge waves. Property damage was estimated at more than
$1 million.
Police said Dr. James Mitchel of Hilo was killed in the Halape
Beach incident and Michael Cruz, 26, of Mountain View, Hawaii,
was reported missing after part of the beach plunged below sea

level.
Chris Cameron, chief ranger at Hawaii Volcanoes National
Park, said the coastal land fell below sea level as the island was
rocked by a quake that registered 7.2 on the Richter scale. Water
surged across campgrounds, sweeping most of some three dozen
campers to higher grounds.
The geological spasms began at 3:36 a.m. Saturday with a quake
registering 5.5 on the Richter scale. It was followed at 4:48 a.m. by
the 7.2 shock, which broke windows in downtown Hilo and
shook buildings in Honolulu. 200 miles awav.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number, for example from
5.5 to 6.5, means the ground motion is 10 times greater. Some
experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30 times
greater.
That jolt also triggered tidal waves and touched off a minor
eruption in the active Kilauea Crater, which burst out with 30 foot
lava fountains along a half mile long crack.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. A little warmer. Lows in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs both days mid 50s to lower 60s. Winds
variable to 15 mph.
Allende's nephew sentenced to death
SANTIAGO, Chile — The underground Revolutionary Left
Movement yesterday condemned to death its two top leaders —
one of them a nephew of the late Marxist President Salvador
Allende — and ordered "its militants and . . . revolutionaries of
the entire world, to execute the sentences however, whenever and
where they can."
In a declaration sent from hiding to local newspapers and
foreign news agencies, the Central Committee of MIR, as it is
known by its Spanish initials, said Andres Pascal Allende. 32, the
leader of the organization, and his principal aide, Nelson Guiter
rez, 31, violated standing orders when they.sought asylum in two
Santiago diplomatic missions with their female companions Nov.
7.
The declaration said both men were expelled from MIR "for
life" and charged with "treason against the party, the working
class and the people and also desertion and cowardice."
In addition to being expelled from the party, Pascal Allende
and Guiterrez — both founders of MIR in 1965 — were con
demned to death for "gravely damaging the development of the
Chilean and worldwide revolutionary movement and also for the
fact that their seeking of asylum effectively helps the junta dic
tatorship."
Spanish amnesty branded 'an insult'
MADRID — Spain's most powerful leftist, Marcelino Camacho,
was released from prison yesterday by King Juan Carlos and
immediately denounced the king's amnesty as "an insult."
Camacho said he would lead a campaign to free all political
prisoners, even if it means prison again. He charged the amnesty
decreed by the new Spanish leader last week affected only 10
percent of the nation's estimated 2000 political prisoners.
"This famous amnesty is an insult," Camacho told a news
conference a few hours after his release.
Meeting with foreign newsmen in Madrid lawyer's office,
Camacho said the giant underground trade union network he
heads also opposes the monarchy as a replacement for 36 years of
iron-fisted rule by Gen. Francisco Franco.
"The prince swore to uphold the principles of the regime. The
principles are nothing but Fascism and I have been fighting that
all my life." the 57-year-old labor organizer said.
Democratic mayors adopt urban plan
MIAMI BEACH — Democratic mayors adopted an urban policy
statement yesterday in their first effort to write a plank of the
party's national platform. The mayors also accused President
Ford and former President Richard Nixon of waging an unde
clared war on cities.
The National Conference of Democratic Mayors, formed two
years ago and claiming 1100 members, adopted the policy state
ment by a series of voice votes. In brief debate they rejected an
effort to water down a call for national health insurance and
added an amendment to endorse enforcement of court-ordered
school desegregation, including busing.
The mayors, now formally an adjunct to the Democratic Na
tional Committee, hope to have their document written into the
party's 197(: national platform.
"In 1972 the urban issue was the forgotten issue of the cam

paign, and we're here to see that that doesn't happen again," said
Mayor Henry Maier of Milwaukee, president of the conference.
