# Mascot
## 
### 
The Daily has decided not to go ahead with its plan to use its
mascot selection contest to choose the mascot it will use when
referring to Stanford athletic teams.
While several hundred responses were received, massive
bloc voting by persons taking bundles of the Stanford-Cal
football issue invalidated the results.
The Daily does not, as of now, have a policy on whether to
accept the results of the ASSU referendum Dec. 3-4 as binding,
but the paper will in no case use any mascot which caricatures
a racial or other group.
