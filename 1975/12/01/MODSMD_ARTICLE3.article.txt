Legal procedures to evict Anthony
"Tony" Alexander from his shoe re
pair business "are proceeding" de
spite the fact that students and faculty
have been donating money to help
Alexander with his debt, according to
Plant Services Director Jason Mavis.
"I definitely know that legal pro
ceedings are moving on to the next
stage to have him evicted," said Mavis
last night. This next step would be a
filed complaint against an unlawful
detainer.
Mavis said he was unaware Alexan
der had received money from students
and faculty and said the effect it would
have on legal proceedings "depends
on how much he receives."
Mavis said it is up to Alexander to
seek a time extension to pay his debt
through Adrian Arima, assistant to the
staff counsel.
"It's possible" that Alexander could
seek an extension, said Mavis, "but 1
don't know if it would be granted."
Alexander's court'
Mavis indicated that the legal coun
sel would "probably come back to me
and I'd have to decide" whether to give
Alexander an extension. "But the ball
is definitely in his (Alexander's)
court."

"They (the administration) haven't
called on me," said Alexander, who
received a three-day notice to quit the
premises on Thursday, Nov. 20 signed
by Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance.
"I don't know who to talk to. The
Daily knows more about what's going
on than I do," Alexander said.
Alexander owes the University
$874.70 in back rent for the shop and
$267.53 in land and property taxes.
Arima, who was aware of the monet
ary offers to Alexander, said
Wednesday,"There's no need for them
(Plant Services) to call on us for use of
our legal counsel," if Plant Services
reached an agreement with Alexander
over the weekend.
There were no meetings between
Alexander, Plant Services or the coun
sel over the weekend.
Lease expired
Arima said an added "complica
tion" is that Alexander's lease, which
is drawn up monthly, has expired.
"He's got to work out something with
Plant Services."
Alexander said he asked "someone"
at Memorial Church "to take care of the
money people have been giving me.
With that and what I've got, we're
going to get a bundle together (to pay

the bill)," he said. He did not say how
much money had been collected.
The shop, if vacated, will probably
be used for academic rather than retail
purposes, according to Mavis. "1 know
there are a lot of departments who
need and can use the space," he said.
'Academic use'
"The space will revert to the
provost's office under the control of
(Ex'ecutie Assistant to the Provost) Ed
Shaw and his assistant, Amy Blue.
They will see that it will be put to some
academic use," he said.
"I was just so surprised," said Alex
ander about the money offers. "I
thought we were going to just die out,
and that people didn't care. But they
came right on in. People are wonder
ful."
"You know, since that article came
out (Daily, November 25) people have
been stopping by and offering money
to pay the bill," said Alexander. "One
professor offered me a hundred dol
lars."
The shoe shop on White Plaza, "to
my understanding, wasn't originally
built to be a retail structure," said
Mavis. "I don't really know. I had
heard that it used to be part of the old
bookstore."
