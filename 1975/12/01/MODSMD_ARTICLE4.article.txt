# SWOPSI, SCIRE class size levels
## 
### ANN POLLOCK TIM W. FERGUSON 
Enrollments in SWOPS! (Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Is
sues), and SCIRE (Student Center for
Innovation in Research and Educa
tion) and other extradepartmental
programs (EDPs) have steadied, after
fluctuating wildly during the forma
tive years.
Peaking in 1970-71, total EDP en
rollment declined to a low point in
1973-74 and now is slowly rebound
ing. The program enrollments have
fluctuated for different reasons, how
ever, and respective EDP directors at
tach little significance to the figures.
They maintain that other considera
tions must be weighed more heavily
when the Faculty Senate deliberates
the future of EDPs at its meeting this
week.
SWOPSI, which grew out of SCIRE
in 1969-70, enrolled 504 students in 42
classes that year. After the Cambodian
invasion that spring, enrollment in
politically-oriented SWOPSI zoomed
to 949 in 56 classes for the next
academic year.
Transition
A "period of transition" followed in
1971-72, according to Laura Selznick,
assistant to the assistant dean of un
dergraduate studies. Political interest
subsided and new SWOPSI Director
Dan Lewis emphasized program
initiated, ratherthan student-initiated,
courses. Enrollment dived to 422 stu

dents, while the number of classes
dropped only to 53.
Since that year. SWOPSI enrollment
has hovered near the 700 mark yearly
with approximately 60 courses of
fered. although last year's enrollment
dropped 10 percent from 1973-74. Un
official figures from this fall indicate
the 700 figure will be reached again.
SCIRE enrollments have varied even
more widely. The program began with
31 students and eight courses in
1969-70, then attracted over 300 stu
dents a year with up to 66 courses for
each of the next three years.
In 1973-74, however, enrollment
dropped to 71 and course offerings de
clined to 23. A slight rise to 91 and 31,
respectively, occurred last year.
Selznick said SCIRE officials were
"not terribly critical of what (course
ideas were) coming in" during the
years SCIRE burgeoned. "The concept
of group projects got out of hand."
Balloon burst
The balloon burst in 1973-74 when
interest in SCIRE withered. The
program's policy board, then adminis
tering SCIRE in lieu of a director, also
tightened up on offerings, Selznick
said.
Another cause of the dropoff was an
elimination of overlap between SCIRE
and the Undergraduate Specials (US)
program, with the latter picking up the
duplicate programs, present SCIRE Di
rector Alice Supton said.
But even though US picked up the
overlap in 1973-74, that year marked
US's enrollment low point. When it
included senior colloquia in 1969-70,
US included 3631 students in 136
courses.
With the loss of the colloquia and
the transfer of the popular Human
Sexuality and Sleep and Dreams
courses to regular departments, US
shrank to 1085 students in 83 courses
in 1973-74.
US enrollment up
The program's enrollment rose by 60
percent last year, however, and pre
liminary figures for this fall indicate it
will maintain this new level. Course
offerings during the increase have re
mained virtually constant in number.
Enrollment in the remaining EDP,
Urban Studies, has remained a factor
of the number of course offerings
through the six-year period, and now
totals some 250 a year for 25 courses.
Administrators of the programs are
vehement in discounting enrollment
as a criterion for judging EDP success.
"We don't look at enrollment as a
test of success because we put size re
strictions on our classes," said present
SWOPSI Director Andy Parnes. "It's a
rare course that has more tlAn 15 stu
dents."
Limited size
SWOPSI's charge, adopted by the
Faculty Senate three years ago, limits
the program to 25 courses a quarter
with no more than 15 students per in
structor.
Supton said SCIRE successes may
actually decrease its enrollment, be
cause one function of the program is to
locate regular departments to sponsor
innovative courses suggested to
SCIRE.
"Looking at enrollment figures is no
measure of success because those fig
ures don't reflect the number of people
we influence." Supton said. "We have
an impact on a considerable consti
tuency of students. The number of stu
dents we affect indirectly as well as
not-so-indirectly is great."
Supton also pointed to last year's
SCIRE-sponsored Biology Bridge, say
ing that 300 students were aided by the
project but not actually' enrolled in
SCIRE.
An ad hoc panel appointed by Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James Cibbs
recommended last month that the
EDPs retain their autonomy from es
tablished University departments and
be provided "a stable financial base."
"It's too early to tell what effects the
panel's report will have," Parnes said.

Enrollments in SWOPS! (Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Is
sues), and SCIRE (Student Center for
Innovation in Research and Educa
tion) and other extradepartmental
programs (EDPs) have steadied, after
fluctuating wildly during the forma
tive years.
Peaking in 1970-71, total EDP en
rollment declined to a low point in
1973-74 and now is slowly rebound
ing. The program enrollments have
fluctuated for different reasons, how
ever, and respective EDP directors at
tach little significance to the figures.
They maintain that other considera
tions must be weighed more heavily
when the Faculty Senate deliberates
the future of EDPs at its meeting this
week.
SWOPSI, which grew out of SCIRE
in 1969-70, enrolled 504 students in 42
classes that year. After the Cambodian
invasion that spring, enrollment in
politically-oriented SWOPSI zoomed
to 949 in 56 classes for the next
academic year.
Transition
A "period of transition" followed in
1971-72, according to Laura Selznick,
assistant to the assistant dean of un
dergraduate studies. Political interest
subsided and new SWOPSI Director
Dan Lewis emphasized program
initiated, ratherthan student-initiated,
courses. Enrollment dived to 422 stu

dents, while the number of classes
dropped only to 53.
Since that year. SWOPSI enrollment
has hovered near the 700 mark yearly
with approximately 60 courses of
fered. although last year's enrollment
dropped 10 percent from 1973-74. Un
official figures from this fall indicate
the 700 figure will be reached again.
SCIRE enrollments have varied even
more widely. The program began with
31 students and eight courses in
1969-70, then attracted over 300 stu
dents a year with up to 66 courses for
each of the next three years.
In 1973-74, however, enrollment
dropped to 71 and course offerings de
clined to 23. A slight rise to 91 and 31,
respectively, occurred last year.
Selznick said SCIRE officials were
"not terribly critical of what (course
ideas were) coming in" during the
years SCIRE burgeoned. "The concept
of group projects got out of hand."
Balloon burst
The balloon burst in 1973-74 when
interest in SCIRE withered. The
program's policy board, then adminis
tering SCIRE in lieu of a director, also
tightened up on offerings, Selznick
said.
Another cause of the dropoff was an
elimination of overlap between SCIRE
and the Undergraduate Specials (US)
program, with the latter picking up the
duplicate programs, present SCIRE Di
rector Alice Supton said.
But even though US picked up the
overlap in 1973-74, that year marked
US's enrollment low point. When it
included senior colloquia in 1969-70,
US included 3631 students in 136
courses.
With the loss of the colloquia and
the transfer of the popular Human
Sexuality and Sleep and Dreams
courses to regular departments, US
shrank to 1085 students in 83 courses
in 1973-74.
US enrollment up
The program's enrollment rose by 60
percent last year, however, and pre
liminary figures for this fall indicate it
will maintain this new level. Course
offerings during the increase have re
mained virtually constant in number.
Enrollment in the remaining EDP,
Urban Studies, has remained a factor
of the number of course offerings
through the six-year period, and now
totals some 250 a year for 25 courses.
Administrators of the programs are
vehement in discounting enrollment
as a criterion for judging EDP success.
"We don't look at enrollment as a
test of success because we put size re
strictions on our classes," said present
SWOPSI Director Andy Parnes. "It's a
rare course that has more tlAn 15 stu
dents."
Limited size
SWOPSI's charge, adopted by the
Faculty Senate three years ago, limits
the program to 25 courses a quarter
with no more than 15 students per in
structor.
Supton said SCIRE successes may
actually decrease its enrollment, be
cause one function of the program is to
locate regular departments to sponsor
innovative courses suggested to
SCIRE.
"Looking at enrollment figures is no
measure of success because those fig
ures don't reflect the number of people
we influence." Supton said. "We have
an impact on a considerable consti
tuency of students. The number of stu

the program to 25 courses a quarter
with no more than 15 students per in
structor.
Supton said SCIRE successes may
actually decrease its enrollment, be
cause one function of the program is to
locate regular departments to sponsor
innovative courses suggested to
SCIRE.
"Looking at enrollment figures is no
measure of success because those fig
ures don't reflect the number of people
we influence." Supton said. "We have
an impact on a considerable consti
tuency of students. The number of stu
dents we affect indirectly as well as
not-so-indirectly is great."
Supton also pointed to last year's
SCIRE-sponsored Biology Bridge, say
ing that 300 students were aided by the
project but not actually' enrolled in
SCIRE.
An ad hoc panel appointed by Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James Cibbs
recommended last month that the
EDPs retain their autonomy from es
tablished University departments and
be provided "a stable financial base."
"It's too early to tell what effects the
panel's report will have," Parnes said.
Enrollments in SWOPS! (Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Is
sues), and SCIRE (Student Center for
Innovation in Research and Educa
tion) and other extradepartmental
programs (EDPs) have steadied, after
fluctuating wildly during the forma
tive years.
Peaking in 1970-71, total EDP en
rollment declined to a low point in
1973-74 and now is slowly rebound
ing. The program enrollments have
fluctuated for different reasons, how
ever, and respective EDP directors at
tach little significance to the figures.
They maintain that other considera
tions must be weighed more heavily
when the Faculty Senate deliberates
the future of EDPs at its meeting this
week.
SWOPSI, which grew out of SCIRE
in 1969-70, enrolled 504 students in 42
classes that year. After the Cambodian
invasion that spring, enrollment in
politically-oriented SWOPSI zoomed
to 949 in 56 classes for the next
academic year.
Transition
A "period of transition" followed in
1971-72, according to Laura Selznick,
assistant to the assistant dean of un
dergraduate studies. Political interest
subsided and new SWOPSI Director
Dan Lewis emphasized program
initiated, ratherthan student-initiated,
courses. Enrollment dived to 422 stu

dents, while the number of classes
dropped only to 53.
Since that year. SWOPSI enrollment
has hovered near the 700 mark yearly
with approximately 60 courses of
fered. although last year's enrollment
dropped 10 percent from 1973-74. Un
official figures from this fall indicate
the 700 figure will be reached again.
SCIRE enrollments have varied even
more widely. The program began with
31 students and eight courses in
1969-70, then attracted over 300 stu
dents a year with up to 66 courses for
each of the next three years.
In 1973-74, however, enrollment
dropped to 71 and course offerings de
clined to 23. A slight rise to 91 and 31,
respectively, occurred last year.
Selznick said SCIRE officials were
"not terribly critical of what (course
ideas were) coming in" during the
years SCIRE burgeoned. "The concept
of group projects got out of hand."
Balloon burst
The balloon burst in 1973-74 when
interest in SCIRE withered. The
program's policy board, then adminis
tering SCIRE in lieu of a director, also
tightened up on offerings, Selznick
said.
Another cause of the dropoff was an
elimination of overlap between SCIRE
and the Undergraduate Specials (US)
program, with the latter picking up the
duplicate programs, present SCIRE Di
rector Alice Supton said.
But even though US picked up the
overlap in 1973-74, that year marked
US's enrollment low point. When it
included senior colloquia in 1969-70,
US included 3631 students in 136
courses.
With the loss of the colloquia and
the transfer of the popular Human
Sexuality and Sleep and Dreams
courses to regular departments, US
shrank to 1085 students in 83 courses
in 1973-74.
US enrollment up
The program's enrollment rose by 60
percent last year, however, and pre
liminary figures for this fall indicate it
will maintain this new level. Course
offerings during the increase have re
mained virtually constant in number.
Enrollment in the remaining EDP,
Urban Studies, has remained a factor
of the number of course offerings
through the six-year period, and now
totals some 250 a year for 25 courses.
Administrators of the programs are
vehement in discounting enrollment
as a criterion for judging EDP success.
"We don't look at enrollment as a
test of success because we put size re
strictions on our classes," said present
SWOPSI Director Andy Parnes. "It's a
rare course that has more tlAn 15 stu
dents."
Limited size

Faculty Senate three years ago, limits
the program to 25 courses a quarter
