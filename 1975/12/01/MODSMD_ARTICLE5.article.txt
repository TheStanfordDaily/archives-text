# ERA praised by 'Status of Women' chairperson

### KARL BOETTNER 
The Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) is a "hard-core political issue"
and one that "will be with us for some
time," Anita Miller, chairperson for
the California State Commission on
the Status of Women, told 50 people in
the Meyer Library forum room last
week.
Miller discussed the meaning of the
amendment, it's effect on the status of
women and political realities sur
rounding its final passage in her
speech, sponsored by SWOPSI.
The text of the ERA, she explained,
basically says that "equality of rights
under the law shall not be denied on
account of sex. The purpose of the
proposed amendment to the United
States Constitution is to define the
rights of women in this country."
The ERA seeks to eliminate sex as a
criterion for evaluation of people in
this society. Miller pointed out that
discrimination based on sex was given
legality by the words in the Declara
tion of Independence, "We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal."
"Basically, the ERA will require that
government treat all people equally."
she said. It has nothing to do with de
fining the role of women in personal
relationships. Mutual support laws,
presently in effect, will not be affected,
she said.
Support
She said there is a willingness on the
part of the courts to interpret "sup
port" as not simply the money income
of the couple or the family, but as "all

the energy devoted to maintaining the
household." The courts will not inter
vene as long as the man and woman
stay together.
Miller said the ERA would have al
most no effect on child support and
alimony. Also, according to Miller, the
ERA will make social security benefits
available to both men and women,
more equitably and liberally.
Miller said there is still a strong cor
relation between years of education
and occupational level and income.
Even though women receive 43 per
cent of the bachelor's degrees issued
by colleges each year, 30 percent of the
master's degrees and 18 percent of the
doctorates, Miller said there "still
tends to be discrimination against
women on admissions and on moneys
made available" to women and men
for their educations.
Since 75 percent of higher educa
tional institutions are publicly funded,
ratification of the ERA will inevitably
bring changes in this situation."
Other matters
The ERA will be felt in other matters
as well. Miller said. If the draft is reins
tated, women would be included, she
said. The ERA will seek removal of
inequities in the police and prison sys
tem, such as arresting procedures, sen
tencing and treatment in prisons. She
said segregated restroom and sleeping
facilities will remain unaffected by the
ERA, since issues of this nature are
included under rights to privacy.
Miller emphasized, "There is a great
deal of difference between a constitu

time."
