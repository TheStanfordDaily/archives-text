# Land issues

### 
With candidates entering the
1976 presidential campaign at a
breakneck rate, attention has
turned to individual stands on
the major issues of the election.
Thus far, emphasis has been
placed upon such topics as de
tente, inflation, big government,
energy, women's rights, gun
control and busing. A much
more urgent problem with far
reaching consequences has re
ceived only brief consideration:
environmental preservation.
The importance of this issue is
demonstrated by a disturbing
trend which has manifested it
self during the past several
years. In the frequent confronta
tions between growth advocates
and conservationists, the latter
have increasingly emerged as
the losers.
Examples of this tendency are
not difficult to find. Despite
years of opposition and numer
ous alternate proposals, oil will
soon be flowing southward from
Alaska through a less-than-safe
pipeline. Some 56 atomic power
stations are currently in opera
tion in the United States,and the
present administration desires
200 by 1985.
Similifrly, U.S. District Judge
David Williams recently gave
approval for the Interior De
partment to lease 1.25 million
acres of ocean bottom land off
the coast of southern California
to oil companies.
In upholding his position,
Williams emphasized the "great
techniques in platform drilling
and improved methods of oil

capture." The seagulls and other
wildlife of Santa Barbara most
certainly know otherwise.
Even apparent victories for
environmentalists are in actual
ity often defeats. National park
and monument land, usually
thought of as immune to the ons
laught of industrial growth, is in
reality threatened.
The National Park Service re
cently conceded for the first time
that logging activity is causing
harm to Redwood National Park.
Death Valley National Monu
ment, already severely scarred
by strip mining operations, an
nually endures some 200 new
claims and about 1200 addi
tional acres of rampant destruc
tion.
In view of these and countless
other examples, it is clear that
the environment should be one
of the major issues of not only
the upcoming presidential elec
tion, but of state and local ones
as wejl.
Specifically, increased con
cern for conservation must come
in the form of comprehensive
environmental impact state
ments on all actions proposed by
industry and government. In ad
dition, more stringent enforce
ment of rules governing en
vironmental quality is essential.
Failure to adopt such policies
in the near future will render not
only the conservationists, but all
Americans, losers in the long
run.
