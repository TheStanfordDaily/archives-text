When we first began to rtfad
Jeff Ehrlich's somewhat
euphoric account of the Stephen
Stills concert in the Nov. 23
Daily, our initial reaction was to
wonder if we had attended the
same concert.
As we proceeded to read
through the review, however, we
realized that the events de
scribed by Ehrlich vaguely re
sembled the events which we
had witnessed in Maples Pavil
ion.
Stephen Stills certainly was
present. Neil Young really did
make a guest appearance.
After that, however, the simi
larity ends. What Ehrlich depicts
as a pleasant evening of good,
old-fashioned fun was actually
four hours of tension, disap
pointment and unnecessary has
sles.
Bad management
To begin with, the ASSU Spe
cial Events could not have man
aged the concert any worse if it
had been making a conscienti
ous effort. The crowd, already
restless because the gates didn't
open until 7:30 p.m., was forced
to enter Maples almost single file
so that the ticket-takers could
check for the bottles and cans
which inevitably ended up in
side anyway.
The concert began with a good
percentage of the crowd still
standing outside. This, however,
was probably a blessing in dis
guise. At least those, standing
outside did not have to endure
the truly repulsive display put
on bv Flo and Eddie.

Cook, Daniels

What Ehrlich mildly describes
as "an outrageous parody of the
rock 'n roll business" was actu
ally blatant bad taste in its purest
form.
We think that Ehlrich grossly
underrates the sensibilities of
the audience when he claims
that only "many a young girl
took offense" to the antics of Flo
and Eddie.
Restless crowd
It is fortunate that Stills
opened the concert with a set
done on electric guitar since,
after the opening act, the crowd
was hardly in a mood to settle
down and listen to acoustic.
As it turned out, however, the
crowd never actually got in the
mood for acoustical music. Sev
eral times during the acoustical
set, Stills had to ask the crowd to
quiet down so that he could hear
himself sing.
The actions of the crowd must
be attributed partly to general
rudeness and partly to the in
adequate sound system set up in
Maples that caused those in the
balconies to yell out requesting
that the microphones be turned
up.
In his description of the per
formance put on by Stills and
Young, Ehrlich is correct: there
was certainly a show of fine
musicianship. But to describe
the general atmosphere as
"triumphant" is to exaggerate
greatly what took place at the
concert.

side anyway.
The concert began with a good
percentage of the crowd still
standing outside. This, however,
was probably a blessing in dis
guise. At least those, standing
outside did not have to endure
the truly repulsive display put
on bv Flo and Eddie.

Cook, Daniels

What Ehrlich mildly describes
as "an outrageous parody of the
rock 'n roll business" was actu
ally blatant bad taste in its purest
form.
We think that Ehlrich grossly
underrates the sensibilities of
the audience when he claims
that only "many a young girl
took offense" to the antics of Flo
and Eddie.
Restless crowd
It is fortunate that Stills
opened the concert with a set
done on electric guitar since,
after the opening act, the crowd
was hardly in a mood to settle
down and listen to acoustic.
As it turned out, however, the
crowd never actually got in the
mood for acoustical music. Sev
eral times during the acoustical
set, Stills had to ask the crowd to
quiet down so that he could hear
himself sing.
The actions of the crowd must
be attributed partly to general
rudeness and partly to the in
adequate sound system set up in
Maples that caused those in the
balconies to yell out requesting
that the microphones be turned
up.
In his description of the per
formance put on by Stills and
Young, Ehrlich is correct: there
was certainly a show of fine
musicianship. But to describe
the general atmosphere as
"triumphant" is to exaggerate
greatly what took place at the
concert.

When we first began to rtfad
Jeff Ehrlich's somewhat
euphoric account of the Stephen
Stills concert in the Nov. 23
Daily, our initial reaction was to
wonder if we had attended the
same concert.
As we proceeded to read
through the review, however, we
realized that the events de
scribed by Ehrlich vaguely re
sembled the events which we
had witnessed in Maples Pavil
ion.
Stephen Stills certainly was
present. Neil Young really did
make a guest appearance.
After that, however, the simi
larity ends. What Ehrlich depicts
as a pleasant evening of good,
old-fashioned fun was actually
four hours of tension, disap
pointment and unnecessary has
sles.
Bad management
To begin with, the ASSU Spe
cial Events could not have man
aged the concert any worse if it
had been making a conscienti
ous effort. The crowd, already
restless because the gates didn't
open until 7:30 p.m., was forced
to enter Maples almost single file
so that the ticket-takers could
check for the bottles and cans
which inevitably ended up in
