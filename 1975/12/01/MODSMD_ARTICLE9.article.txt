# Anti-Zionism: the big lie
## 
### 
Some people, it seems, view the recent anti-
Zionist United Nations resolution as an irrational
act, born of frustration, that can only hurt the Arab
cause. 1 agree that the resolution hurts the real
interests of the Arab peoples, but I am afraid that it
is right in line with the aims of the Arab govern
ments.
The Arab governments would still like to "drive
Israel into the sea," if they could. That was their
announced goal only eight years ago, in 1967, and
it takes incredible naivete to think that in the 1973
Yom Kippur War the Arab armies would have
stopped at the pre-1967 borders.
Only recently have Egypt and Syria ever given
lip service to Israel's right to exist. I hope that in
time this lip service may evolve into real accep
tance, but that is a long way off. The evidence is
the recent U.N. resolution.
The Arabs are not Nazis, but they are using
tactics used by Adolph Hitler in his attempt at
genocide. One of Hitler's tactics was the big lie. If
a lie is big enough, loud enough, and deals with
emotional enough issues, it stands a good chance
of being believed, even if it is utterly absurd.
One of Hitler's most successful uses of the big
lie was to label Jews as "sub-human" (i.e.,
dangerous animals, not people). This lie
legitimized the genocide, both by removing any
question of human rights for Jews, and by prevent-

ing other people from worrying who might be
next.
The U.N. resolution is also a big lie. There have
been honest arguments against Zionism, but this
is not one of them. Zionism is the movement for a
state where the majority culture is Jewish and
which can serve as a haven for Jews, in the place
where such a state once existed.
This is no more racist than the desire for a Pales
tinian state to which all Palestinians can return.
What this resolution does is to brand not only the
present government of Israel, but any possible
Jewish state, to be a "sub-state," without rights
and fairgameforany form of hatred oraggression.
Thus, the U.N. resolution is not just an irra
tional , inconsequential act. It is part of the attempt
to destroy Israel and its people. The United Na
tions, formed to combat aggression, is being used
as a tool of aggression.
The many states that cynically supported the
resolution in return for promises of oil or because
of other political pressures will clearly not be
impressed by a few speeches by the United States.
If the United States does not resist the big lie tactic
in the United Nations with strong, concrete ac
tion. then both the United Nations and Israel will
be that much closer to destruction.

The U.N. resolution is also a big lie. There have
been honest arguments against Zionism, but this
is not one of them. Zionism is the movement for a
state where the majority culture is Jewish and
which can serve as a haven for Jews, in the place
where such a state once existed.
This is no more racist than the desire for a Pales
tinian state to which all Palestinians can return.
What this resolution does is to brand not only the
present government of Israel, but any possible
Jewish state, to be a "sub-state," without rights
and fairgameforany form of hatred oraggression.
Thus, the U.N. resolution is not just an irra
tional , inconsequential act. It is part of the attempt
to destroy Israel and its people. The United Na
tions, formed to combat aggression, is being used
as a tool of aggression.
The many states that cynically supported the
resolution in return for promises of oil or because
of other political pressures will clearly not be
impressed by a few speeches by the United States.
If the United States does not resist the big lie tactic
in the United Nations with strong, concrete ac
tion. then both the United Nations and Israel will
be that much closer to destruction.

Some people, it seems, view the recent anti-
Zionist United Nations resolution as an irrational
act, born of frustration, that can only hurt the Arab
cause. 1 agree that the resolution hurts the real
interests of the Arab peoples, but I am afraid that it
is right in line with the aims of the Arab govern
ments.
The Arab governments would still like to "drive
Israel into the sea," if they could. That was their
announced goal only eight years ago, in 1967, and
it takes incredible naivete to think that in the 1973
Yom Kippur War the Arab armies would have
stopped at the pre-1967 borders.
Only recently have Egypt and Syria ever given
lip service to Israel's right to exist. I hope that in
time this lip service may evolve into real accep
tance, but that is a long way off. The evidence is
the recent U.N. resolution.
The Arabs are not Nazis, but they are using
tactics used by Adolph Hitler in his attempt at
genocide. One of Hitler's tactics was the big lie. If
a lie is big enough, loud enough, and deals with
emotional enough issues, it stands a good chance
of being believed, even if it is utterly absurd.
One of Hitler's most successful uses of the big
lie was to label Jews as "sub-human" (i.e.,
dangerous animals, not people). This lie
legitimized the genocide, both by removing any
question of human rights for Jews, and by prevent-
