Now in easy to ski
away from the crowds!
Here's a brand-new book about America's fastest-growing winter sport.
In clear and simple language (with plenty of illustrations), it discusses equip
ment, clothing, waxing. It contains a map of Northern California ski touring areas,
phone numbers for road and weather conditions, and much, much more.
Until now, you would have gone to many sources for all this information. The
book is non-technical and concise, for beginners and advanced skiers — an ideal
companion to carry in your car or pack.
