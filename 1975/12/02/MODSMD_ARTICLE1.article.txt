# Commission tells ASSU:
## 'No public budget sessions' 
### JACK VAUGHN 
The Budget Priorities Commission
(BPC) is not considering scheduling
open meetings on "faculty and staff
salaries or budgets for specific de
partments," according to BPC Chair
man Patrick Suppes.
In a presentation before the ASSU
Senate last night, though, Suppes kept
open the possibility of "public discus
sion" on broad questions of budget
priorities.
Public hearings on specific depart
mental cuts to be recommended by the
commission would "generate a great
deal of animosity," Suppes said. "The
only type of cut you could talk about in
an open hearing would be an across
the board cut that would end up in
mediocrity" for all programs, Suppes
said.
Every cut "that is a possibility
would appear to those affected as a
likelihood" if preliminary commis
sion considerations were publicly
aired, said Vice Provost forßudget and
Planning Raymond Bacchetti, a com
mission member. "This would have an
enormous effect on morale" among fa
culty and staff members, he said.
Result of privacy
However, commission member
Mike Kieschnick, an ASSU committee
staff assistant, told the Senate that the
result of private discussions on budget
priorities has been "a totally unedu
cated public" unable to see the com
plete budget picture.

As a result, "the reaction of the stu
dent body and faculty is always
against" proposed cuts, Kieschnick
said. "A long-range goal should be to
have an educated public," he said.
Responding to Senate questioning
on proposed tuition hikes, Suppes
said, "the present policy is to increase
student tuition slightly beyond the in
crease in the Consumer Price Index."
The additional tuition is designed
"so there will be a fund for University
improvements," Suppes explained. "It
didn't seem to us a good idea to have
zero money available in a crunch
period for improvements," Bacchetti
said.
Financial reports
Bacchetti said he has asked depart
ments heads for reports on the finan
cial statuses of their offices. These re
ports will include suggestions for de
partmental budget trimming and the
impace of cuts on effectiveness and af
firmative action priorities, he said.
The need for budget trimming, Sup
pes said, stems from "a gap of $10 mill
ion on a steady-state basis between in
come aYid outflow" in the University
budget. The commission and the
Provost's Office have worked on "clos
ing the gap" and creating a budget
equilibrium, he said.
Despite cuts made last year by the
administration, a $2 million gap re
mains, said Suppes. Deciding "whose
favorite program or department or ser
vice is going to have to take some cuts"

will not be "a simple matter," he
added.
"There was a lot of concern in the
Faculty Senate over whether the gap is
going to be closed in the faculty of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,"
Suppes said.
Suppes said the commission does
"not have a list of what the administra
tion might do" in ordering budget
cuts, based on the commission's re
commendations. But, "there are areas
where you might say 'well, we can do
without these' " and maintain
academic quality, he said.
He mentioned the phasing out of the
undergraduate architecture depart
ment last year as an example of how
programs can be eliminated.

"There was a lot of concern in the
Faculty Senate over whether the gap is
going to be closed in the faculty of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,"
Suppes said.
Suppes said the commission does
"not have a list of what the administra
tion might do" in ordering budget
cuts, based on the commission's re
commendations. But, "there are areas
where you might say 'well, we can do
without these' " and maintain
academic quality, he said.
He mentioned the phasing out of the
undergraduate architecture depart
ment last year as an example of how
programs can be eliminated.

budget discussions will not be open to the public. He
added, however, that his commission will entertain pub
lic debate on general questions of budget priorities.
The Budget Priorities Commission
(BPC) is not considering scheduling
open meetings on "faculty and staff
salaries or budgets for specific de
partments," according to BPC Chair
man Patrick Suppes.
In a presentation before the ASSU
Senate last night, though, Suppes kept
open the possibility of "public discus
sion" on broad questions of budget
priorities.
Public hearings on specific depart
mental cuts to be recommended by the
commission would "generate a great
deal of animosity," Suppes said. "The
only type of cut you could talk about in
an open hearing would be an across
the board cut that would end up in
mediocrity" for all programs, Suppes
said.
Every cut "that is a possibility
would appear to those affected as a
likelihood" if preliminary commis
sion considerations were publicly
aired, said Vice Provost forßudget and
Planning Raymond Bacchetti, a com
mission member. "This would have an
enormous effect on morale" among fa
culty and staff members, he said.
Result of privacy
However, commission member
Mike Kieschnick, an ASSU committee
staff assistant, told the Senate that the
result of private discussions on budget
priorities has been "a totally unedu
cated public" unable to see the com
plete budget picture.

As a result, "the reaction of the stu
dent body and faculty is always
against" proposed cuts, Kieschnick
said. "A long-range goal should be to
have an educated public," he said.
Responding to Senate questioning
on proposed tuition hikes, Suppes
said, "the present policy is to increase
student tuition slightly beyond the in
crease in the Consumer Price Index."
The additional tuition is designed
"so there will be a fund for University
improvements," Suppes explained. "It
didn't seem to us a good idea to have
zero money available in a crunch
period for improvements," Bacchetti
said.
Financial reports
Bacchetti said he has asked depart
ments heads for reports on the finan
cial statuses of their offices. These re
ports will include suggestions for de
partmental budget trimming and the
impace of cuts on effectiveness and af
firmative action priorities, he said.
The need for budget trimming, Sup
pes said, stems from "a gap of $10 mill
ion on a steady-state basis between in
come aYid outflow" in the University
budget. The commission and the
Provost's Office have worked on "clos
ing the gap" and creating a budget
equilibrium, he said.
Despite cuts made last year by the
administration, a $2 million gap re
mains, said Suppes. Deciding "whose
favorite program or department or ser
vice is going to have to take some cuts"

will not be "a simple matter," he
added.
