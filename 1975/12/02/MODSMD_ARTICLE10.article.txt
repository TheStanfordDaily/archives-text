# Admit students on academic ability
## 
### 
Among the absurdities that sprang up in
academia a few years ago was the idea that
grades, test scores and extra-curricular ac
tivities were not necessarily adequate
criteria for judging candidates for admis
sion to colleges,
Consequently, a number of private col
leges encouraged applicants to submit their
handiwork to admissions committees as
evidence of special talent.
After a few admissions deans suffered in
digestion from homemade cakes sent in by
high school seniors who could not under
stand basic algebra or inflect simple verbs
— much less cook — the colleges returned
to their old admissions procedures.
Like the deans who spent their days tast
ing rancid pastries, the three students who
recently investigated Stanford's financial
aid policies for the Advisory Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid (C-UAFA) have displayed a dangerous
lack of concern for maintaining academic
ability as the primary basis for admission to
the University.
Special talents
The Howard Report's contention that
more students should be admitted for un
conventional reasons is unacceptable for
two reasons. First, paper records are gener
ally the best indication of academic ability.
In cases where other factors are an indica
tion, the University already takes such fac
tors into consideration by admitting stu
dents with special qualities or talents.
Furthermore, this is an academic institu
tion, so nonacademic skills, should not be a
major basis for admission. Applicants with
such skills shbuld enter special schools
where they could develop their special tal
ents, rather than attend a liberal arts college.

The report's main contention is that the
University is wrong to award financial aid
to students for academic reasons, since this
places at a disadvantage low income stu
dents who have not had the chance to estab-

. i"l'<il lib J' ."I Illimnwwiv
lish strong records.
Therefore, the Howard Report advocates
abolishing the academic categories for aid.
The current system allows students in the
top academic category to contribute a max
imum of only $2400 in self-help to their
educational expenses over four years while
students in the lowest catgory must contri
bute a maximum of $6200.
The report, however, recommends re
taining a special category for "low-very low
income students," who must contribute
only $2850 to self-help.
Formula for disaster
As many administrators have pointed
out, the Howard Report's recommendation
for abolishing financial incentives for the
academically best qualified students is a
formula for academic disaster.
While it is true that only 15 percent of the
students who do not attend Stanford go to
other schools because they receive more
generous financial aid packages, this per
centage would inevitably expand if Stan
ford stopped offering incentives.

The Howard Report's logic is analogous
to reasoning that because few
students refuse to attend Stanford because
they don't like the housing system, closing
all the dorms would not damage the
University's attractiveness.
The Howard Report, however, is right to
question the extent to which the
University's financial aid policies are dis
couraging low income students from at
tending Stanford. Especially at a time when
tuition is outpacing inflation, there is a real
danger that low income persons will be exc
luded from Stanford for financial reasons.
More study needed
The Howard Committee should have dis
covered how many low-income students
cannot attend Stanford because they are not
given enough financial aid incentives. The
committee could then have recommended
appropriate readjustment of the $2850
self-help requirement.
Hopefully, the Howard Report will in
spire a renewed effort by the administration
to attract a more economically diverse stu
dent body.
The report also has rightly called atten
tion to the University's provision of virtu
ally no financial aid for transfer students.
Perhaps the report will be the first step to
ward reform in this area.
The Howard Report is well researched
and raises some provocative questions. It
deserves a much better reception from the
administration than the hostile criticism it
has incurred. But its basic contentions are
unacceptable because they would weaken
the University's academic quality.
