# Bicentennial Commission: a fraud?
## 
### 
David Deacon

The People's Bicentennial
Commission (PBC), newly active
in the Bay Area, proclaims that it
proudly follows in the tradition
of the American revolutionaries
of 1776. Yet, despite its claims
that it supports a natural exten
sion of the ideals of the founding
fathers, the PBC is in fact a
socialist organization whose
very purpose is to undermine the
principles of government those
revolutionaries fought for.
Supporters of socialism are no
novel phenomena in today's soc
iety, and this group would
hardly deserve notice but for the
deceitful methods which are
being used to accomplish its
goals. For the PBC is attempting
to achieve a recognition it does
not deserve through both distor
tion of our country's ideological
origins, and misrepresentation
of the Commission's own goals.
A quote from the founder of
the PBC, Jeremy Rifkin, illumi
nates the purpose of the organi
zation. Commentator M. Stanton
Evans writes:
"The point of the exercise
was stressed a few years back by
New Leftist Jeremy Rifkin, who

declared that the Bicentennial
should produce a 'campaign de
signed to create a revolutionary
consciousness,' linking 'Thomas
Paine, Sam Adams and Benja
min Rush with Lenin, Mao, Che
and the struggle of all oppressed
people in the world.' "
Needless to say, this statement
appears nowhere in the PBC's
literature.
Unwitting conscription
The danger of this group lies
in the unwitting conscription of
serious individuals as prop
agandists for the New Left.
While it is true that the PBC
does make some good points,
and often plays up legitimate ills
(indeed this is part of its
method), the overall thrust of its
"educational materials" is to
perpetrate a gigantic fraud upon
the American public.
The methods of the PBC fit
into four broad categories.
First, the PBC claims to advo
cate a natural extension of the
intellectual and political views
held by our original legislators.
The absurdity of this claim is
easily demonstrated.
In its document called
Common Sense II (we are now
being linked to Thomas Paine)
appears the statement:
"Free enterprise can only be
I really free if we. the American
people, join together, and demo
cratically choose what is to be
produced, how it is to be pro
duced, and how the rewards are
to be allocated."
Socialist state
In other words we are being
asked to establish a socialist
state (without, of course, calling
it that) where our livelihood is to
be dictated by "the people," in
order that we may be "really"
free.
Second, America's ideological
origin is misrepresented as
being "democracy," i.e. unli
mited majority rule.
The PBC apparently has not
yet learned that the American
system of government had its

roots in the moral principle
stated in the Declaration of In
dependence that a man should
be free by right from initiation of
force by other men, including
the Government.
Or that the elaborate system
of checks'and balances was de
vised to prevent a power-hungry
individual (or a greedy majority)
from violating the rights of the
smallest minority on earth: the
individual.
Communist rhetoric
Third, with communist
rhetoric (never labelled as such),
the PBC attacks large corpora
tions as the cause of all our
economic problems.
And it says that we should re
member our American tradition,
heed the words of Karl Marx, and
establish "economic democ
racy." The attempt to link the
Marxist doctrine of class warfare
with the revolution is too
ridiculous to mention further.
However, the attempt to estab
lish that the only alternative to
more-of-the-same-from-Wash
ington is socialism should not be
allowed to succeed.
The PBC correctly points out
that if the patriots of 1776 could
see our present political system
they would raise a storm of pro
test. But when these men fought
King George's armies, they
fought for individual rights: they
fought to guarantee the right of
the rich man to his larger prop
erty as well as the right of the
poor man to his smaller prop
erty.
The PBC is fighting for the.
"right" to take your money
whether you're rich or poor.
Fourth, in an attempt to
sugar-coat its ideology, the PBC
sneaks it in without identifying
it for what it is.
Avoids usage
It carefully avoids criticizing
individualism, meticulously
shuns the terms "collectivism,"
or "communism," and uses
favorably terms such as "free en
terprise" to describe quite the

opposite.
As Eric Veyhl writes in MIT
student newspaper Ergo:
"If the spokesmen for the
PBC think that its goals are valid,
then ... let them have the cour
age to come out and proclaim
openly to the people: 'We are op
posed to the individualism on
which this country was founded:
we are opposed to the idea of
inalienable individual rights; we
think the individual is subordi
nate to the collective — and that
his life and work are to be dic
tated by the group's demands.
We think the Bicentennial is a
good time to destroy the last re
mnants of individualism and
political freedom in this
country . ..
"And let them see how far they
get."

his life and work are to be dic

We think the Bicentennial is a

The People's Bicentennial
Commission (PBC), newly active
in the Bay Area, proclaims that it
proudly follows in the tradition
of the American revolutionaries
of 1776. Yet, despite its claims
that it supports a natural exten
sion of the ideals of the founding
fathers, the PBC is in fact a
socialist organization whose
very purpose is to undermine the
principles of government those
revolutionaries fought for.
Supporters of socialism are no
novel phenomena in today's soc
iety, and this group would
hardly deserve notice but for the
deceitful methods which are
being used to accomplish its
goals. For the PBC is attempting
to achieve a recognition it does
not deserve through both distor
tion of our country's ideological
origins, and misrepresentation
of the Commission's own goals.
A quote from the founder of
the PBC, Jeremy Rifkin, illumi
nates the purpose of the organi
zation. Commentator M. Stanton
Evans writes:
"The point of the exercise
was stressed a few years back by
New Leftist Jeremy Rifkin, who

declared that the Bicentennial
should produce a 'campaign de
signed to create a revolutionary
consciousness,' linking 'Thomas
Paine, Sam Adams and Benja
min Rush with Lenin, Mao, Che
and the struggle of all oppressed
people in the world.' "
Needless to say, this statement
appears nowhere in the PBC's
literature.
Unwitting conscription
The danger of this group lies
in the unwitting conscription of
serious individuals as prop
agandists for the New Left.
While it is true that the PBC
does make some good points,
and often plays up legitimate ills
(indeed this is part of its
method), the overall thrust of its
"educational materials" is to
perpetrate a gigantic fraud upon
the American public.
The methods of the PBC fit
into four broad categories.
First, the PBC claims to advo
cate a natural extension of the
intellectual and political views
held by our original legislators.
The absurdity of this claim is
easily demonstrated.
In its document called
Common Sense II (we are now
being linked to Thomas Paine)
appears the statement:
"Free enterprise can only be
I really free if we. the American
people, join together, and demo
cratically choose what is to be
produced, how it is to be pro
duced, and how the rewards are
to be allocated."
Socialist state
In other words we are being
asked to establish a socialist
state (without, of course, calling
it that) where our livelihood is to
be dictated by "the people," in
order that we may be "really"
free.
Second, America's ideological
origin is misrepresented as
being "democracy," i.e. unli
mited majority rule.
The PBC apparently has not
yet learned that the American
system of government had its

roots in the moral principle
stated in the Declaration of In
dependence that a man should
be free by right from initiation of
force by other men, including
the Government.
Or that the elaborate system
of checks'and balances was de
vised to prevent a power-hungry
individual (or a greedy majority)
from violating the rights of the
smallest minority on earth: the
individual.
Communist rhetoric
Third, with communist
rhetoric (never labelled as such),
the PBC attacks large corpora
tions as the cause of all our
economic problems.
And it says that we should re
member our American tradition,
heed the words of Karl Marx, and
establish "economic democ
racy." The attempt to link the
Marxist doctrine of class warfare
with the revolution is too
ridiculous to mention further.
However, the attempt to estab
lish that the only alternative to
more-of-the-same-from-Wash
ington is socialism should not be
allowed to succeed.
The PBC correctly points out
that if the patriots of 1776 could
see our present political system
they would raise a storm of pro
test. But when these men fought
King George's armies, they
fought for individual rights: they
fought to guarantee the right of
the rich man to his larger prop
erty as well as the right of the
poor man to his smaller prop
erty.
The PBC is fighting for the.

the Government.
Or that the elaborate system
of checks'and balances was de
vised to prevent a power-hungry
individual (or a greedy majority)
from violating the rights of the
smallest minority on earth: the
individual.
Communist rhetoric
Third, with communist
rhetoric (never labelled as such),
the PBC attacks large corpora
tions as the cause of all our
economic problems.
And it says that we should re
member our American tradition,
heed the words of Karl Marx, and
establish "economic democ
racy." The attempt to link the
Marxist doctrine of class warfare
with the revolution is too
ridiculous to mention further.
However, the attempt to estab
lish that the only alternative to
more-of-the-same-from-Wash
ington is socialism should not be
allowed to succeed.
The PBC correctly points out
that if the patriots of 1776 could
see our present political system
they would raise a storm of pro
test. But when these men fought
King George's armies, they
fought for individual rights: they
fought to guarantee the right of
the rich man to his larger prop
erty as well as the right of the
poor man to his smaller prop
erty.
The PBC is fighting for the.
"right" to take your money
whether you're rich or poor.
Fourth, in an attempt to
sugar-coat its ideology, the PBC
sneaks it in without identifying
it for what it is.
Avoids usage
It carefully avoids criticizing
individualism, meticulously
shuns the terms "collectivism,"
or "communism," and uses
favorably terms such as "free en
terprise" to describe quite the

opposite.
As Eric Veyhl writes in MIT
student newspaper Ergo:
"If the spokesmen for the
PBC think that its goals are valid,
then ... let them have the cour
age to come out and proclaim
openly to the people: 'We are op
posed to the individualism on
which this country was founded:
we are opposed to the idea of
inalienable individual rights; we
think the individual is subordi
nate to the collective — and that
his life and work are to be dic
tated by the group's demands.
We think the Bicentennial is a
good time to destroy the last re
mnants of individualism and
political freedom in this
country . ..
"And let them see how far they
get."

The People's Bicentennial
Commission (PBC), newly active
in the Bay Area, proclaims that it
proudly follows in the tradition
of the American revolutionaries
of 1776. Yet, despite its claims
that it supports a natural exten
sion of the ideals of the founding
fathers, the PBC is in fact a
socialist organization whose
very purpose is to undermine the
principles of government those
revolutionaries fought for.
Supporters of socialism are no
novel phenomena in today's soc
iety, and this group would
hardly deserve notice but for the
deceitful methods which are
being used to accomplish its
goals. For the PBC is attempting
to achieve a recognition it does
not deserve through both distor
tion of our country's ideological
origins, and misrepresentation
of the Commission's own goals.
A quote from the founder of
the PBC, Jeremy Rifkin, illumi
nates the purpose of the organi
zation. Commentator M. Stanton
Evans writes:
"The point of the exercise
was stressed a few years back by
New Leftist Jeremy Rifkin, who

declared that the Bicentennial
should produce a 'campaign de
signed to create a revolutionary
consciousness,' linking 'Thomas
Paine, Sam Adams and Benja
min Rush with Lenin, Mao, Che
and the struggle of all oppressed
people in the world.' "
Needless to say, this statement
appears nowhere in the PBC's
literature.
Unwitting conscription
The danger of this group lies
in the unwitting conscription of
serious individuals as prop
agandists for the New Left.
While it is true that the PBC
does make some good points,
and often plays up legitimate ills
(indeed this is part of its
method), the overall thrust of its
"educational materials" is to
perpetrate a gigantic fraud upon
the American public.
The methods of the PBC fit
into four broad categories.
First, the PBC claims to advo
cate a natural extension of the
intellectual and political views
held by our original legislators.
The absurdity of this claim is
easily demonstrated.
In its document called
Common Sense II (we are now
being linked to Thomas Paine)
appears the statement:
"Free enterprise can only be
I really free if we. the American
people, join together, and demo
cratically choose what is to be
produced, how it is to be pro
duced, and how the rewards are
to be allocated."
Socialist state
In other words we are being
asked to establish a socialist
state (without, of course, calling
it that) where our livelihood is to
be dictated by "the people," in
order that we may be "really"
free.
Second, America's ideological
origin is misrepresented as
being "democracy," i.e. unli
mited majority rule.
The PBC apparently has not
yet learned that the American
system of government had its

roots in the moral principle
stated in the Declaration of In
dependence that a man should
be free by right from initiation of
force by other men, including
the Government.
Or that the elaborate system
of checks'and balances was de
vised to prevent a power-hungry
individual (or a greedy majority)
from violating the rights of the
