Minority admissions
Editor:
I am writing to correct one
error of fact and one of context in
Richard Fearon's Nov. 24 Daily
column "Minority admissions
quotas unfair."
I am not, never have been, and
if possible, never will be the
University Affirmative Action
officer. 1 don't know how that
notion got started, but since it
has appeared twice in the Daily
recently I thought 1 would try —
in vain, no doubt — to persuade
someone that it's not true.
The error of context is this:
Fearon correctly quotes from a
report of mine of several years
ago to the effect that minority
students have been admitted to
Stanford largely on a preferen
tial basis, i.e., with records that
probably would not have won
admission for non-minority ap
plicants.
What follows in my report is
"... with several minor excep
tions, all Schools claim to be
admitting only students who are
judged capable of performing
satisfactorily in the curriculum
as it stands."
Others may judge whether
that makes a legal or a moral dif
ference. As a matter of fact, how
ever, it puts minority applicants
into the same judgment area as
are other applicant groups
whom the University chooses to
prefer, for example, skilled ath
letes, faculty children and
perhaps others.

Misconceptions
Editor:
David Spiegel's Nov. 26 Daily
letter entitled "Israeli rights"
fails to appreciate the basic con
clusion of Syed Tariq's article
(Daily, Nov. 24) "Zionism en
courages racist acts": the Pales
tinian problem should be solved
on the basis of non-racism rather
than Zionism.
First, Spiegel mentions that
Tariq's article is "on the whole
untrue" while he fails to give
any reason why he thinks so.
Second, he says that the Arab
countries discriminate between
Jews and non-Jews and gives the
example that Saudi Arabia re
fuses to hire Jews, women and
blacks.
In the San Francisco
Chronicle (Nov. 20) it is written
that "misunderstandings and
lack of information led to con
clusions that women blacks and
Jews would be barred from a
state jobs program with Saudi
Arabia," and "officials said they
now believe Californians of any
race, creed, nationality, religion
and sex would be able to partici
pate in overseas job programs if
successfully negotiated."
However, Saudi Arabia
doesn't allow the participation
of anyone adhering to Zionism,
and it is justified in doing so.
This is analogous to the United
States' refusal to allow Cuban
communists to enter and work in
the United States.
Spiegel knows how difficult
it was for the Jews when they lost
families and homes in the Nazi
era, and he should not allow the
same thing to happen to the
Palestinians.
All people have the same right
to live and prosper. I hope that
Palestine will be home for the
Jews, Christians and Moslems
who lived there in the past.
The Palestinian problem must
be solved if a peace is sought in
the Middle East, and the Palesti
nians must return to their
homes.
