## Alex Dallin moves from advising politicians to teaching undergrads 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
"l don't know why anyone would want
to interview me. I don't think I'm very
interesting," claims soft-spoken Alexan
der Dallin with a slight German accent.
Dallin is a professor of history and
political science here as well as a senior
research fellow at Hoover Institution. A
renowned Soviet expert, he resigned as
State Department intelligence consultant
five years ago, in protest over the Vietnam
war.
Dallin is tanned and stocky. His hair
line has receded to near the middle of his
head and wisps of gray mix with his black
hair near the part.
He controls a fat cigar in his left hand
and occasionally puffs on it, sending
smoke wafting up to the ceiling of his
office.
Russian and Soviet studies
Dallin's main field is Russian history
and Soviet studies. This quarter he is
teaching Political Science 136, "Soviet
Foreign Policy."
"Alex has a national and international
reputation in his field as a historian and a
political scientist," says Political Science
Prof. Robert North.
History Prof. Terrence Emmons, says
Dallin is "one of the half-dozen people in
the U.S. considered to be at the top of the
Russian studies field."
A student calls him "an international
scholar."
Dallin, 51, says his father wanted him

to become an engineer. "I wasn't really
sure what I wanted to do. So my first two
years in college I took general survey type
courses. Then World War 11 broke out and
I went into the army."
While in the army from 1943 to 1946, he
interrogated prisoners of war, including
some German diplomats. He also acted as
an interpreter between American and
Russian troops.
"I was the only one in the group who
knew any Russian since my parents were
from Russia," he explains.
International relations
His wartime experiences convinced
him to major in international relations
upon his return to City College in New
York, where he received his B.S. degree in
1947, He received his M.A. and Ph.D
from Columbia in 1948 and 1953 respec
tively.
"If I was starting now, 1 might not go
into the same field," says the Fhi Beta
Kappa. "There's always a certain tension
involved; you have to watch what goes on
throughout the world and read the new
publications that come out every year."
Indeed, the tension sometimes shows
on his face, which looks more like a
diplomat's than a professor's. He has the
hardened eyes that peer knowingly from
behind black-rimmed glasses, the same
kind of nervous laugh and the same de
liberate way of speaking.
Dallin, a native of Berlin, has met Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger "twice be

fore he was secretary of state and twice
since."
"Kissinger is a complicated man,"
muses Dallin as he rests his chin on his
right palm and makes a V with his fingers
around his nose.
Vietnam disagreement
"I like some things he has done and
have strongly objected to others. 1 see his
Soviet Union and China policies as im
provements over the past, hut 1 didn't
agree with his Vietnam policy," he says.
Dallin, a member of the Council of
Foreign Relations, resigned in 1970 as a
continuing consultant to the State
Department's Bureau of Intelligence and
Research in protest over the "whole Viet
nam business."
The next year he came to Stanford after
spending 15 years as a professor of inter
national relations at Columbia. Here he
has concentrated mainly on under
graduate instruction while at Columbia
he taught mostly graduate courses.
"I had to change my style of teaching
somewhat when I came here because I
found it harder to teach undergrads than
grad students," he says.
"I enjoy supervising doctorates and se
eing the results when my students get out
into'society," he adds.
Shrewd
Gordon Craig, former chairman of the
History Department, says Dallin is "a
shrewd problem solver, is unflappable,
efficient, cooperative and unassuming.

"In our departmental meetings I usu
ally kept my eye on him. If 1 saw his face
light up, then 1 was apt to call on him to
hear what he had to say."
Craig says Dallin's best work, German
Rule in Russia: 1941-1945, had a great
effect on him when he read it. "I've even
quoted it liberally in some of my books."
Dallin, a member of the American Civil
Liberties Union, has written two other
books: The Soviet Union at the United
Nations and The Soviet Union and Dis
armament.
Chess player
Occasionally, he invites a colleague
over to play a chess game. A few years ago
he studied a book of famous chess
matches. "It's easy to play a lousy game,"
he says with a smile, "but much harder to
play a very good game.
"I wish 1 had more hobbies, but usually
1 seem to be too busy to enjoy them," he
adds soberly.
And what often keeps him busy are the
many trips he takes. He has been to
Europe many times, to Russia three times,
to the Mideast, to India and to Japan
among other places.
He says his most interesting trip
"would have to be my trip to the Kremlin
in 1959," he says as his eyes light up. "I
went as the Soviet expert with a group of
U.S. governors who didn't know beans
about Russian. 1 got a chance to talk to
Khrushchev and the other top Soviet
leaders."
