W'/iat causes tlle popping noise when knuckles ure "cracked"? My
roommate claims it is the release of gas in the joints; I say he needs
more sleep. What do you think? -W.S.
Your somnolent roommate is absolutely right. The following
explanation of joint-cracking is courtesy of Visiting Anatomy Prof.
Mortenson:
When some annoying person like your roommate cracks his
knuckles, he draws the two surfaces of the joint apart. These two
surfaces are normally separated by a film of fluid. As a result of
pulling them apart, gas is drawn from the adjacent tissues into the
joint space, creating a little gas bubble in the joint. The drawing-out
of this bubble causes the pop. Until the bubble is reabsorbed into
the tissue the joint cannot be "cracked" again.

Is there anywhere in the area that haircutting lessons are given? Or
is if against union policy? Since the price of haircuts, especially for
men, is rising so fast, it would seem like a really practical course!
-P.M.
You can't learn to cut hair unless you attend a registered beauty
college and get a license from the State Board of Cosmetology. The
whole process costs you over $700, and there's a state examination
at the end.
However before you make any rash career decisions, you should
know that one doesn't slide through beauty college as if it were
Stanford. There are at least 1600 hours of required beauty instruc
tion which include the following: 130 hours of written and practi
cal theory classes (covering subjects like the proper formation of
pincurls); 10 hours of chemistry; 20 hours learning the cosmetol
ogy acts and related regulations; 25 hours of modeling (letting
fellow students work on your hair); 25 hours of reception and desk
work; 100 hours of haircutting and styling; 375 hours of hairdres
sing; 200 hours of chemical waving and straightening; 100 hours of
hair coloring; 75 hours of facials; 100 hours of manicures; and 24
hours of "laboratory" (cleaning the haircutting lab).
Then and only then does the state allow you to work in an
honest-to-goodness beauty salon.
Personally I'd pursue something less demanding. Why not be a
pre-med?
