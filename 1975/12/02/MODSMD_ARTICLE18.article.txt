WASHINGTON (AF) â€” AgriculUire Secretary Earl Butz said
yesterday that he thinks it is time to talk more seriously about
helping poor Third World countries through joint U.S. investment
ventures, possibly including partnership funds from the oil-rich
Mideast.
Also Butz told a news conference, the idea of "joint ventures"
with private U.S. businesses seems to be attractive in several East
ern European Socialist countries which he visited last month.
The ventures would involve U.S. businesses, foreign govern
ments and possibly funds from the Middle East oil nations.
Butz spent almost three weeks seeing agricultural and govern
ment leaders in Iran, Israel, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary and
Poland. He returned Saturday following a meeting in London.
