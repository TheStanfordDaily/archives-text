## San Francisco Symphony & Opera: not up to par Mozart Festival: misperformed 
### RICHARD CROSS 
What is worse than pathetic? Why, P.D.Q. Bach,
of course. Or so one would think if he had not
heard the San Francisco Symphony at the Palace
of Fine Arts in San Francisco. The concert, the last
third of the Symphony's three-part Mozart Festi
val, sounded as if Peter Schickele (P.D.Q. Bach)
had master-minded the whnln fiasco, rather than
just the second half of it.
The Symphony arrayed itself in ignominy by its
misperformance of the "Symphony No. 39 in E
Flat Major, K. 543," the first of the three great
symhonies that Mozart composed at the end of his
life.
Tonal quality varied tremendously, especially
in the strings. Attacks at the beginning of phrases
were muddled. The Symphony played uncer
tainly, as if they were not familiar with the music.
Conductor Niklaus Wyss, who is not a theatrical
conductor, struggled to guide the orchestra to
ward some unifying musical idea of which he
alone, unfortunately, was aware. It was, as P.D.Q.
Bach would say, a piece for conductor vs. or
chestra. . , .
Low-point
The little allegro of the third movement might
hae been a distinct musical high-point but for
some lackadaisical playing by the principal
clarinetist. One had the impression that the piece
had not been practiced enough.
With the first half of the program now safely
behind them, the Symphony welcomed Peter
Schickele aboard to assist them in a new version
of Mozart's "The Impresario." Composed in 1786,
this work was originally a prolix mini-opera that
caricatures the impresario's task of engaging per
formers and presenting entertainment.
Schickele's adaption of "The Impresario"
lasted only slightly longer than his introduction
to it — a lengthy joke-alogue about opera as insan

ity. Schickele's own libretto was nothing but in
anity, however. The plot of "The Impresario" was
reduced so much that it was the least tangible
reason for the presence of th ree si ngers, a conduc
tor and an orchestra on stage with Peter Schickele.
Abominable sound
Musically, there was little more to justify their
presence. Elsa Charlton as Madame Goldentrill
gave a performance so bad that at first one thought
that she was supposed to sound abominable. Her
voice was remarkably frail, her runs a barrage of
out-of-tune notes, her pronunciation incom
prehensible.
Faye Robinson as Miss Silverpeal gave a perfor
ance that was as good as Miss Charlton's was bad.
She showed a brilliant soprano voice that knew no
limitations except for some uneasiness in her
lower register. One wondered what ironic inten
tion the Symphony's real impresario could have
had in mind when he cast Robinson opposite
Charlston.
Tenor Daniel Parkerson was adequate as Mr.
Angel.
Uninspired
Even Peter Schickele's contribution to the even
ing, which should have been harmlessly amusing,
was notably uninspired. About half of his material
consisted of salacious double entendres like, "I'm
sure that your pear-shaped tones will equal your
pear-shaped . . . " It sounded as if he were doing a
routine for an opera tour at Caesar's Palace.
The San Francisco Symphony's "Impresario"
was neither opera nor"Singspiel" (the Carman
name for the genre of this work). Similarly, the
audience discovered that because a reputable or
chestra plays music that Mozart wrote does not
guarantee that they will hear Mozart played.

life.
Tonal quality varied tremendously, especially
in the strings. Attacks at the beginning of phrases
were muddled. The Symphony played uncer
tainly, as if they were not familiar with the music.
Conductor Niklaus Wyss, who is not a theatrical
conductor, struggled to guide the orchestra to
ward some unifying musical idea of which he
alone, unfortunately, was aware. It was, as P.D.Q.
Bach would say, a piece for conductor vs. or
chestra. . , .
Low-point
The little allegro of the third movement might
hae been a distinct musical high-point but for
some lackadaisical playing by the principal
clarinetist. One had the impression that the piece
had not been practiced enough.
With the first half of the program now safely
behind them, the Symphony welcomed Peter
Schickele aboard to assist them in a new version
of Mozart's "The Impresario." Composed in 1786,
this work was originally a prolix mini-opera that
caricatures the impresario's task of engaging per
formers and presenting entertainment.
Schickele's adaption of "The Impresario"
lasted only slightly longer than his introduction
to it — a lengthy joke-alogue about opera as insan

ity. Schickele's own libretto was nothing but in
anity, however. The plot of "The Impresario" was
reduced so much that it was the least tangible
reason for the presence of th ree si ngers, a conduc
tor and an orchestra on stage with Peter Schickele.
Abominable sound
Musically, there was little more to justify their
presence. Elsa Charlton as Madame Goldentrill
gave a performance so bad that at first one thought
that she was supposed to sound abominable. Her
voice was remarkably frail, her runs a barrage of
out-of-tune notes, her pronunciation incom
prehensible.
Faye Robinson as Miss Silverpeal gave a perfor
ance that was as good as Miss Charlton's was bad.
She showed a brilliant soprano voice that knew no
limitations except for some uneasiness in her
lower register. One wondered what ironic inten
tion the Symphony's real impresario could have
had in mind when he cast Robinson opposite
Charlston.
Tenor Daniel Parkerson was adequate as Mr.
Angel.
Uninspired
Even Peter Schickele's contribution to the even
ing, which should have been harmlessly amusing,
was notably uninspired. About half of his material
consisted of salacious double entendres like, "I'm
sure that your pear-shaped tones will equal your
pear-shaped . . . " It sounded as if he were doing a
routine for an opera tour at Caesar's Palace.
The San Francisco Symphony's "Impresario"
was neither opera nor"Singspiel" (the Carman
name for the genre of this work). Similarly, the
audience discovered that because a reputable or
chestra plays music that Mozart wrote does not
guarantee that they will hear Mozart played.

|.S. BACH HE AlN'T—Peter Schickele, also known as P.D.Q. Bach,
narrated Mozart's "The Impresario" in the final part of the San
Francisco Symphony's Mozart festival. His inane and insane con
tributions to the evening created an absurd joke-alogue that only a
mother could love.
What is worse than pathetic? Why, P.D.Q. Bach,
of course. Or so one would think if he had not
heard the San Francisco Symphony at the Palace
of Fine Arts in San Francisco. The concert, the last
third of the Symphony's three-part Mozart Festi
val, sounded as if Peter Schickele (P.D.Q. Bach)
had master-minded the whnln fiasco, rather than
just the second half of it.
The Symphony arrayed itself in ignominy by its
misperformance of the "Symphony No. 39 in E
Flat Major, K. 543," the first of the three great
symhonies that Mozart composed at the end of his
life.
