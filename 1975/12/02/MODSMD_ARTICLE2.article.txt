# Prof terms China trip symbolic but useless

### PHILIP FEDER 
President Ford's trip to China this
week "will have a symbolic rather than
substantive" impact on Sino-
American relations, said Assoc. His
tory Prof. Lyman Van Slyke.
"From Ford's standpoint, he is try
ing to have greater visibility in foreign
affairs so that it doesn't appear that
(Secretary of State Henry) Kissinger
has taken over," Van Slyke told the
Daily last night.
"The Chinese, and especially Mao
(Tse-tung) and Chou (En-lai) want to
set China oh a path for the future."
China's now aged leaders —Mao is
nearly 82 and in poor health, and Chou
is seriously ill at 77 — want to "certify
as part of their legacy the principle of
detente with the United States," said
Van Slyke. "They (the Chinese leader
ship) want to do what they can to keep
the radicals — those who dislike the
idea of detente with the U.S. — impo
tent," he added.
Stumbling block
U.S. recognition of the Taiwan re
gime continues to be the major stumbl
ing block to a "normalzed relation
ship" with China, Van Slyke said.
But, "this visit reaffirms that both
sides will go ahead on the current
basis" of recognition of Taiwan, he
said.
A political scientist here, Asst. Prof.
Harry Harding, insisted that this Ford
trip is not a good time to announce
restoration of full diplomatic relations
with China.
"Provided we reach a fair and just
resolution of Sino-American differ
ences over Taiwan," said Harding, "I
would propose that we complete the
normalization of relations with the

People's Republic of China within the
next two years."
Harding made that recommendation
to a subcommittee of the House Inter
national Relations Committee last
month.
Ford wary
AccordingtoVan Slyke,Ford maybe
wary of making a decision on the
Taiwan issue because of domestic
political considerations. If he agrees to
full diplomatic relations with the Pek
ing government, the CIOP's right wing
might charge that Ford "sold out" the
Nationalist Chinese government in
Taiwan.
Peking, on the other hand, will want
Ford's reassurance that Soviet-
American detente will not result in in
creased Russian domination in
Europe. Most experts contend that
China wants a militarily strong United
States in order to preoccupy the Soviet
Union with areas other than the Sino-
Soviet border.
At the first state dinner, Deputy
Premier Teng Hsiao-ping almost lec
tured Ford on the subject of the Soviet
Union and detente. It is our detente
policy that is the subject of Peking's
paranoia," said Assoc. History Prof.
Mark Mancall.
"Certainly the Soviet Union issue is
central" to Ford's China trip, said Van
Slyke.
Harding said, "What is at stake, in
short, is the future of our new relation
ship with China. It is important that
the progress achieved over the last six
years not be undone, and that the U.S.
not return to a situation in which there
is a possibility of military conflict with
China in those parts of Asia where our
interests conflict."

American relations, said Assoc. His
tory Prof. Lyman Van Slyke.
"From Ford's standpoint, he is try
ing to have greater visibility in foreign
affairs so that it doesn't appear that
(Secretary of State Henry) Kissinger
has taken over," Van Slyke told the
Daily last night.
"The Chinese, and especially Mao
(Tse-tung) and Chou (En-lai) want to
set China oh a path for the future."
China's now aged leaders —Mao is
nearly 82 and in poor health, and Chou
is seriously ill at 77 — want to "certify
as part of their legacy the principle of
detente with the United States," said
Van Slyke. "They (the Chinese leader
ship) want to do what they can to keep
the radicals — those who dislike the
idea of detente with the U.S. — impo
tent," he added.
Stumbling block
U.S. recognition of the Taiwan re
gime continues to be the major stumbl
ing block to a "normalzed relation
ship" with China, Van Slyke said.
But, "this visit reaffirms that both
sides will go ahead on the current
basis" of recognition of Taiwan, he
said.
A political scientist here, Asst. Prof.
Harry Harding, insisted that this Ford
trip is not a good time to announce
restoration of full diplomatic relations
with China.
"Provided we reach a fair and just
resolution of Sino-American differ
ences over Taiwan," said Harding, "I
would propose that we complete the
normalization of relations with the

People's Republic of China within the
next two years."
Harding made that recommendation
to a subcommittee of the House Inter
national Relations Committee last
month.
Ford wary
AccordingtoVan Slyke,Ford maybe
wary of making a decision on the
Taiwan issue because of domestic
political considerations. If he agrees to
full diplomatic relations with the Pek
ing government, the CIOP's right wing
might charge that Ford "sold out" the
Nationalist Chinese government in
Taiwan.
Peking, on the other hand, will want
Ford's reassurance that Soviet-
American detente will not result in in
creased Russian domination in
Europe. Most experts contend that
China wants a militarily strong United
States in order to preoccupy the Soviet
Union with areas other than the Sino-
Soviet border.
At the first state dinner, Deputy
Premier Teng Hsiao-ping almost lec
tured Ford on the subject of the Soviet
Union and detente. It is our detente
policy that is the subject of Peking's
paranoia," said Assoc. History Prof.
Mark Mancall.
"Certainly the Soviet Union issue is
central" to Ford's China trip, said Van
Slyke.
Harding said, "What is at stake, in
short, is the future of our new relation
ship with China. It is important that
the progress achieved over the last six
years not be undone, and that the U.S.
not return to a situation in which there
is a possibility of military conflict with
China in those parts of Asia where our
interests conflict."
President Ford's trip to China this
week "will have a symbolic rather than
substantive" impact on Sino-
American relations, said Assoc. His
tory Prof. Lyman Van Slyke.
