# 'Werther': miscalculated
## 
### RICHARD CROSS 
Debussy paid Jules Massenet's musical abilities an ironic tribute
when he called "Werther" a sacrilege of literary art; so did George
Bernard Shaw when he wrote: "... he (Massenet) has succeeded
in keeping up the interest of a libretto consisting of four acts and of
a love-lorn tenor who has only two active moments, one when he
tries to ravish a kiss from the fair (heroine) . . . and the other when
he shoots himself behind the scenes."
In the novel that inspired the opera. Goethe saved his hero from
pathos by surrounding him and his fate with an ironic haze. Opera,
however, is not the place for the delicate business of ironic exami
nation. Rather understandably, the enraptured Massenet did away
with the ironic arena. One hundred twelve vears after its appear
ance, the bare sentimental skeleton of Goethe's novel was exhumed
by Massenet and his librettists and put to music.
The tension between Werther's incredible passion and its
hopelessness, his beloved Charlotte's struggle to restrain herself
from giving way to his passion — these ideas are bard enough to
depict dramaticallvthrough the fairly crude medium of the opera.
Hut to attempt to do so without a plot is impossible.
In the San Francisco Opera's production of "Werther" tenor
Giacomo Aragall did all that one man could to allay the effects of
Massenet's musical suicide. He portrayed the romantic hero sym
pathetically without turning him into emotional spaghetti. His
singing and acting were bold, fiery and talented. He was superb as
the emotional miscreant who traumatizes every scene with his
inspired despondency.
Conductor Elyakum Shapirra did full justice to Massenet's often
beautiful score. Largely because of his and Aragall's efforts, the
production was a satisfying experience.
Heather Harper as Charlotte, Werther's love-object, bad much too
diin a voice to be effective opposite the Promethean Aragall. Her
Charlotte was too lustreless to be credible as the inspiration of
Werther's hyperventilated affections.
Albert, the implausible obstacle to Werther's desires who shuf
fles on and off the stage to aggravate the hero's misery and sing his
modest baritone parts, was played by theqapablebut uncompelling
Ronald Hedlund.
In sum, the production must be regarded as a noble miscalcula
tion, whose failings are not entirely Massenet's.
