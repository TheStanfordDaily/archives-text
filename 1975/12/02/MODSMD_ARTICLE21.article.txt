# Spinners spin a web of gold

### JACYN LEWIS EASTER MILLER 
Bubbling over with en
thusiasm and excitement. The
Spinners spun a web of gold
around an appreciative Thank
sgiving audience at the Circle
Star Theatre.
The lead tenor and newest
member of the group, Phillipe
Wynne, exemplified the spirit
and style which led the group to
its 1971 comeback. Beckoning
all to identify with his experi
ences in love, Wynne wooed and
charmed the audience, moving it
to tears as well as laughter.
No less impressive were the
other members of the group:
bassist Pervis Jackson, baritone
Henry Fambrough and tenors
Billy Henderson and Bobby
Smith. They all delighted the
crowd with their uniquely re
freshing and well-balanced
harmony. The Spinners' entire
act (voice and choreography) re
flected the versatility and con
trast which have popularized

them through the years.
The show was highlighted by
the renditions of "Sadie," "Love
Don't Love Nobody" and
"Mighty Love." Somewhat dis
appointing was their latest hit,
"Games People Play" and their
1972 gold records, "I'll Be
Around" and "Could It Be I'm
Falling In Love." Partially due to
Smith's flat pitch, these songs
lacked the luster and sparkle
characteristic of the other selec
tions.
Following these weak spots,
however, Wynne consistently
returned the show to its former
magnificence by intricately
prancing and balladeering ac
ross the stage.
Special guest star Nancy Wil
son displayed a style of her own,
living up to her reputation as one
of the world's foremost female
blues artists. She skillfully used
both voice and microphone, es
tablishing a close rapport with
the audience.
