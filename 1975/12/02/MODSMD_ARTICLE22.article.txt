# Fowles' stories disappoint
## 
### DANA GIOIA 
John Fowles' new collection of
short stories, The Ebony Tower,
is a major disappointment. Al
though the stories are written
with the same graceful assur
ance that has made Fowles' pre
vious hooks so enchanting, no
story in the present volume has
any of the author's usual power.
The stories are all perfectly
told but what is being told is
often rather dull. What heigh
tens the disappointment is that
until now each of Fowles' books
of fiction had been getting prog
ressively better.
In this volume there are five
"longish" short stories. All of
them have problematic endings.
Two are mysteries without defi
nite solutions. One is a transla
tion from the medieval French
with a Christianized ending that
Fowles claims is a later addition.
The best one
The best story in the volume is
"The Enigma" which concerns

the unexplained disappearance
of a Conservative member of Par
liament. The facts about the
man's disappearance never
point to any solution, but one of
the characters makes an interest
ing speculation about the mys
tery.
Fowles is clearly fascinated by
having the characters in his fic
tion realize they are part of
someone else's story.
Self-consciousness
Such self-consciousness about
writing does not save the other
stories in The Ebony Tower. The
techniques that animate the
stories of Nabokov and Borges
only deaden Fowles' work.
Fie would probably be more
successful copying early Henry
James than in aping Alain
Robbe-Grillet. Fowles' strongest
gifts are his insights into the
psychology of sex and his beaut
ifully lucid style.
Fowles has always relied too

heavily on ideas to animate his
fiction. Two stories in this vol
ume, the title story, "The Ebony
Tower," and "Poor Koko" suffer
from deadly moments when the
action stops entirely and the
characters talk in colorless ab
stractions.
Cumbersome
Fowles uses the cumbersome
apparatus of the novel-of-ideas.
But unlike an Anthony Burgess
or Thomas Mann, he cannot
make the ideas live.
Too great a concern with tech
nique also spoils another story,
"The Cloud." Fowles tries to tell
most of the story from an obje
ctive, external point of view.
The story moves in little
splotches of cinematic present
tense. The characters' thoughts
and motivations — always
Fowles' strongest points in tel
ling a story — vanish. The
myriad of details never quite
coheres into a successful story.
