Laotian government ends
VIENTIANE, Laos — King Savang Vathana of
Laos has decided to abdicate, and the Com
munists controlling the country are preparing to
announce the end of the 19-month-old coalition
government, informed sources said today.
The end of the coalition government means the
ouster of the neutralist premier, Prince Souvanna
Phouma, the sources said.
The 74-year-old prince, who has headed the
Laotian government for 13 years, has been virtu
ally powerless since the Communist Pathet Lao
took control of the government last spring.
Last Friday, thousands of demonstrators ap
parently organized by the Pathet Lao marched
through the streets of Vientiane calling for an end
to the coalition and the removal of Souvanna
Phouma.
A broadcast from Hanoi yesterday, quoting the
Pathet Lao's Khaosan news agency, said a new
"administrative committee" in Vientiane has
adopted a program "aimed at the complete aboli
tion of the old corrupt regime . . . and the build
ing of a new regime in which the people are
masters."
Israel boycotts U.N. debate
NEW YORK — Israel agreed to keep the United
Nations buffer force on the Golan Heights, but the
government angrily denounced the U.N. Sec
urity Council for "surrender to Syrian extortion"
and declared it will take no part in the council's
Mideast debate next month because the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) will be invited.
In an eleventh hour compromise Sunday, the
council agreed to Syria's demand that the PLO be
included in the debate next Jan. 12 and Syria
accepted a six-month extension of the U.N. Golan
force.
A Palestinian spokesman at the United Nations
said the council had thus recognized the PLO "as
the sole representative of the people of Pales
tine," as the General Assembly did last year.
Israeli officials privately voiced concern that
the United States had failed to veto the resolution
or at least abstain from the vote. They said the
government found only "partly satisfactory" an
undisclosed explanation cabled to Jerusalem by
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, the
umbrella organization for Palestinian guerrillas.
The U.N. resolution, passed 13-0, did not spec

ifically invite the PLO to the Mideast debate. But
a compromise statement read by the counci 1 pres
ident said it was "the understanding of the major
ity" that the guerrilla leadership would be asked
to participate. U.S. Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan said the United States was not part of
the majority but that it "can't veto" an invitation
to the PLO'.
OK seen for N.Y.C. aid
WASHINGTON — Congress, back from its
Thanksgiving recess, shifted its legislative gears
yesterday to give a quick start to President Ford's
$2.3 billion loan plan for short-term aid to New
York City.
House leaders agreed, in effect, to scrap the bill
the House was to take up today and substitute,
without a break in schedule, the Ford proposal.
Majority Whip John McFall (D-Calif.), told
reporters that the measure, now that it has Ford's
backing, would have easy sailing.
Possible trouble loomed in the Senate, how
ever. Sen. James Allen (D-Ala.), who has op
posed efforts he said would "reward bad man
agement," said in a weekend speech in Mobile,
Ala., he will attempt to filibuster the measure.
Cutting off a filibuster could require the vote of
60 senators to impose closure of debate. Sen.
Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.), acting Democratic
Leader, said he expects no difficulty in breaking
any filibuster on the issue.
Beame says he's still boss
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — New York Mayor Ab
raham Beame denied yesterday that new state
controls over budget decisions in his financially
shaky city had taken operation of the city out of
his hands.
"The mayor of New York is still the manager of
the city." he told newsmen at the annual meeting
of the National League of Cities here. "He still
runs the city and determines priorities. He hires
and fires, and develops programs."
In return for state aid to help avert a New York
City default, a board composed of state officials,
city officials including Beame, and private
businessmen has been given authority over
spending levels and borrowing policy in the city.
The feeling of some other mayors was most
succinctly put by League President Carlos Rom
ero Barcelo, Republican mayor of San Juan,

Puerto Rico. "Mayor Beame no longer runs New
York, and no other city wants to be in that situa
tion," Romero said.
Beame asserted, however, that the board "does
not determine priorities. The} don't have any
input in telling me how money is to be spent

ally powerless since the Communist Pathet Lao
took control of the government last spring.
Last Friday, thousands of demonstrators ap
parently organized by the Pathet Lao marched
through the streets of Vientiane calling for an end
to the coalition and the removal of Souvanna
Phouma.
A broadcast from Hanoi yesterday, quoting the
Pathet Lao's Khaosan news agency, said a new
"administrative committee" in Vientiane has
adopted a program "aimed at the complete aboli
tion of the old corrupt regime . . . and the build
ing of a new regime in which the people are
masters."
Israel boycotts U.N. debate
NEW YORK — Israel agreed to keep the United
Nations buffer force on the Golan Heights, but the
government angrily denounced the U.N. Sec
urity Council for "surrender to Syrian extortion"
and declared it will take no part in the council's
Mideast debate next month because the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) will be invited.
In an eleventh hour compromise Sunday, the
council agreed to Syria's demand that the PLO be
included in the debate next Jan. 12 and Syria
accepted a six-month extension of the U.N. Golan
force.
A Palestinian spokesman at the United Nations
said the council had thus recognized the PLO "as
the sole representative of the people of Pales
tine," as the General Assembly did last year.
Israeli officials privately voiced concern that
the United States had failed to veto the resolution
or at least abstain from the vote. They said the
government found only "partly satisfactory" an
undisclosed explanation cabled to Jerusalem by
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, the
umbrella organization for Palestinian guerrillas.
The U.N. resolution, passed 13-0, did not spec

ifically invite the PLO to the Mideast debate. But
a compromise statement read by the counci 1 pres
ident said it was "the understanding of the major
ity" that the guerrilla leadership would be asked
to participate. U.S. Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan said the United States was not part of
the majority but that it "can't veto" an invitation
to the PLO'.
OK seen for N.Y.C. aid
WASHINGTON — Congress, back from its
Thanksgiving recess, shifted its legislative gears
yesterday to give a quick start to President Ford's
$2.3 billion loan plan for short-term aid to New
York City.
House leaders agreed, in effect, to scrap the bill
the House was to take up today and substitute,
without a break in schedule, the Ford proposal.
Majority Whip John McFall (D-Calif.), told
reporters that the measure, now that it has Ford's
backing, would have easy sailing.
Possible trouble loomed in the Senate, how
ever. Sen. James Allen (D-Ala.), who has op
posed efforts he said would "reward bad man
agement," said in a weekend speech in Mobile,
Ala., he will attempt to filibuster the measure.
Cutting off a filibuster could require the vote of
60 senators to impose closure of debate. Sen.
Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.), acting Democratic
Leader, said he expects no difficulty in breaking
any filibuster on the issue.
Beame says he's still boss
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — New York Mayor Ab
raham Beame denied yesterday that new state
controls over budget decisions in his financially
shaky city had taken operation of the city out of
his hands.
"The mayor of New York is still the manager of
the city." he told newsmen at the annual meeting
of the National League of Cities here. "He still
runs the city and determines priorities. He hires
and fires, and develops programs."
In return for state aid to help avert a New York
City default, a board composed of state officials,
city officials including Beame, and private
businessmen has been given authority over
spending levels and borrowing policy in the city.
The feeling of some other mayors was most
succinctly put by League President Carlos Rom
ero Barcelo, Republican mayor of San Juan,

Puerto Rico. "Mayor Beame no longer runs New
York, and no other city wants to be in that situa
tion," Romero said.
Beame asserted, however, that the board "does

Israel boycotts U.N. debate
NEW YORK — Israel agreed to keep the United
Nations buffer force on the Golan Heights, but the
government angrily denounced the U.N. Sec
urity Council for "surrender to Syrian extortion"
and declared it will take no part in the council's
Mideast debate next month because the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) will be invited.
In an eleventh hour compromise Sunday, the
council agreed to Syria's demand that the PLO be
included in the debate next Jan. 12 and Syria
accepted a six-month extension of the U.N. Golan
force.
A Palestinian spokesman at the United Nations
said the council had thus recognized the PLO "as
the sole representative of the people of Pales
tine," as the General Assembly did last year.
Israeli officials privately voiced concern that
the United States had failed to veto the resolution
or at least abstain from the vote. They said the
government found only "partly satisfactory" an
undisclosed explanation cabled to Jerusalem by
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, the
umbrella organization for Palestinian guerrillas.
The U.N. resolution, passed 13-0, did not spec

ifically invite the PLO to the Mideast debate. But
a compromise statement read by the counci 1 pres
ident said it was "the understanding of the major
ity" that the guerrilla leadership would be asked
to participate. U.S. Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan said the United States was not part of
the majority but that it "can't veto" an invitation
to the PLO'.
OK seen for N.Y.C. aid
WASHINGTON — Congress, back from its
Thanksgiving recess, shifted its legislative gears
yesterday to give a quick start to President Ford's
$2.3 billion loan plan for short-term aid to New
York City.
House leaders agreed, in effect, to scrap the bill
the House was to take up today and substitute,
without a break in schedule, the Ford proposal.
Majority Whip John McFall (D-Calif.), told
reporters that the measure, now that it has Ford's
backing, would have easy sailing.
Possible trouble loomed in the Senate, how
ever. Sen. James Allen (D-Ala.), who has op
posed efforts he said would "reward bad man
agement," said in a weekend speech in Mobile,
Ala., he will attempt to filibuster the measure.
Cutting off a filibuster could require the vote of
60 senators to impose closure of debate. Sen.
Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.), acting Democratic
Leader, said he expects no difficulty in breaking
any filibuster on the issue.
Beame says he's still boss
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — New York Mayor Ab
raham Beame denied yesterday that new state
controls over budget decisions in his financially
shaky city had taken operation of the city out of
his hands.
"The mayor of New York is still the manager of
the city." he told newsmen at the annual meeting
of the National League of Cities here. "He still
runs the city and determines priorities. He hires
and fires, and develops programs."
In return for state aid to help avert a New York
City default, a board composed of state officials,
city officials including Beame, and private
businessmen has been given authority over
spending levels and borrowing policy in the city.
The feeling of some other mayors was most
succinctly put by League President Carlos Rom
ero Barcelo, Republican mayor of San Juan,

Puerto Rico. "Mayor Beame no longer runs New
York, and no other city wants to be in that situa
tion," Romero said.
Beame asserted, however, that the board "does

In an eleventh hour compromise Sunday, the
council agreed to Syria's demand that the PLO be
included in the debate next Jan. 12 and Syria
accepted a six-month extension of the U.N. Golan
force.
A Palestinian spokesman at the United Nations
said the council had thus recognized the PLO "as
the sole representative of the people of Pales
tine," as the General Assembly did last year.
Israeli officials privately voiced concern that
the United States had failed to veto the resolution
or at least abstain from the vote. They said the
government found only "partly satisfactory" an
undisclosed explanation cabled to Jerusalem by
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, the
umbrella organization for Palestinian guerrillas.
The U.N. resolution, passed 13-0, did not spec

ifically invite the PLO to the Mideast debate. But
a compromise statement read by the counci 1 pres
ident said it was "the understanding of the major
ity" that the guerrilla leadership would be asked
to participate. U.S. Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan said the United States was not part of
the majority but that it "can't veto" an invitation
to the PLO'.
OK seen for N.Y.C. aid
WASHINGTON — Congress, back from its
Thanksgiving recess, shifted its legislative gears
yesterday to give a quick start to President Ford's
$2.3 billion loan plan for short-term aid to New
York City.
House leaders agreed, in effect, to scrap the bill
the House was to take up today and substitute,
without a break in schedule, the Ford proposal.
Majority Whip John McFall (D-Calif.), told
reporters that the measure, now that it has Ford's
backing, would have easy sailing.
Possible trouble loomed in the Senate, how
ever. Sen. James Allen (D-Ala.), who has op
posed efforts he said would "reward bad man
agement," said in a weekend speech in Mobile,
Ala., he will attempt to filibuster the measure.
Cutting off a filibuster could require the vote of
60 senators to impose closure of debate. Sen.
Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.), acting Democratic
Leader, said he expects no difficulty in breaking
any filibuster on the issue.
Beame says he's still boss
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — New York Mayor Ab
raham Beame denied yesterday that new state
controls over budget decisions in his financially
shaky city had taken operation of the city out of
his hands.
"The mayor of New York is still the manager of
the city." he told newsmen at the annual meeting
of the National League of Cities here. "He still
runs the city and determines priorities. He hires
and fires, and develops programs."
In return for state aid to help avert a New York
City default, a board composed of state officials,
city officials including Beame, and private
businessmen has been given authority over
spending levels and borrowing policy in the city.
The feeling of some other mayors was most
succinctly put by League President Carlos Rom
ero Barcelo, Republican mayor of San Juan,

Puerto Rico. "Mayor Beame no longer runs New
York, and no other city wants to be in that situa
tion," Romero said.
Beame asserted, however, that the board "does
not determine priorities. The} don't have any
input in telling me how money is to be spent
