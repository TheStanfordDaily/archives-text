# Chinese warn of detente dangers; Ford starts talks with leaders today

PEKING (AP)—President Ford begins talks today with
Chinese leaders who, at the start of his visit, warned him
about what they see as the dangers of detente with the
Soviet Union.
The warning note was sounded by Vice Premier Teng
Hsiao-ping in a toast at a lavish banquet at which Ford was
honored just four hours after his arrival yesterday.
Teng, without mentioning the Soviet Union directly,
referred to it as "the country which most zealously
preaches peace but is the most dangerous source of war."
The vice premier, who is acting as premier during the
illness of Chou En-lai, added, "rhetoric about detente
cannot cover up the stark reality of the growing danger of
war."
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford con
sidered Teng's remarks "frank but nonprovocative." Ford
offered no banquet toast of his own but did give a speech.
With American officials having indicated before Ford
left Washington that the President and his hosts were
unlikely to agree about detente, Ford and Teng found
common ground in pledging continued efforts to nor
malize relations between their countries and to oppose big

power hegemony, or the domination of neighbors through
military force.
Teng made direct mention of former President Richard
Nixon's role in re-establishing diplomatic contacts bet
ween China and the United States. Because of Chinese
affection for Nixon, it was considered significant that
Ford's airport welcome Monday afternoon was somewhat
more elaborate than Nixon received when he made his
trail-blazing trip nearly four years ago.
That the Chinese leadership attached great importance
to Ford's visit seemed underscored by the appearance of
Chairman Mao Tse-tung's wife, Chiang Ching, to pose
with him before the welcoming banquet held in the mas
sive Great Hall of the People. Chiang Ching had not been
seen in public for several months.
Perhaps more remarkable was the appearance at the
picture-taking session of Chu Teh, a leader of the Chinese
army who, as chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, is regarded as China's closest
equivalent to a president.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told reporters that in
all his visits to China he had never before met the
89-year-old Chu Teh.
