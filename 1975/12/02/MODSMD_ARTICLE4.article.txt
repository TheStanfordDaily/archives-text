# Committee suggests end to frosh draw priorities
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Starting with the 1977 spring's
draw, freshmen should no longer be
allowed present residence priority, the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) Subcommittee on Residences
recommended yesterday.
The recommendation, contained in
a resolution unanimously approved by
the four-member . subcommittee,
would end the advantage given to
freshmen living in four-class dor
mitories of returning to the residence
for the sophomore year.
Subcommittee Chairman Paul
Sobotka explained that the resolution
seeks to eliminate priority inequalities
between all-freshmen and four-class
dormitory residents.
"For a long time it (the system) has
been recognized as inequitable," said
Sobotka, who scheduled the item early
on this year's agenda.
Free choice
"It is our hope that freshmen will
choose their freshman experience
based solely on what they want for that
year and not subsequent living experi
ences," he said.
Most opponents of the recommenda
tion expressed concern that the con
tinuity of certain houses would be af
fected if the freshmen were not granted
priority to return, Sobotka explained.
He cited Cedro's theater program as an
example of a continuing house activity
in a four-class dorm.
The subcommittee's resolution does
not affect minority theme houses,
Sobotka pointed out, because theme
house residents are granted other
priorities in addition to present resi
dence preferences. The panel found
that, "the continuity that is important
in minority theme houses will be pre
served."
The resolution should reach COSS
next week, and COSS Chairman Dan
Poston predicted that the full commit
tee "will probably accept (the recom
mendation) at face value."
Poston added that COSS usually fol
lows the recommendations of its sub

committees because, "they've done
the background."
Following COSS approval, the re
solution would proceed to Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton.
"I would assume that he would ac
cept it," Poston said, adding that Hor
ton will probably seek the opinions of
resident fellows. "All the resident fel
lows have expressed their approval,"
Poston said.
The subcommittee mailed letters to
students soliciting feedback on the
issue three weeks ago and received a
petition signed by more than 300
freshmen in favor of eliminating the
priority.
Self interest
Subcommittee member Tom Peery
found that most arguments for retain

ing the present system "were made
from what people personally have to
gain." According to Sobotka, the most
vigorous supporters of the present sys
tem were residents of Lagunita and
Rohle.
The staff and resident assistants in
Lagunita and Rohle were among the
strongest supporters of the resolution.
Sobotka said the staff found the lack of
turnover was "severely limiting the
amount of new input" in Lagunita and
Roble.
The subcommittee decided not to
make its recommendation effective
until next autumn because of opposi
tion among this year's freshmen.
"Freshmen have come to expect that
they will return to their dorms,"

next week, and COSS Chairman Dan
Poston predicted that the full commit
tee "will probably accept (the recom
mendation) at face value."
Poston added that COSS usually fol
lows the recommendations of its sub

committees because, "they've done
the background."
Following COSS approval, the re
solution would proceed to Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton.
"I would assume that he would ac
cept it," Poston said, adding that Hor
ton will probably seek the opinions of
resident fellows. "All the resident fel
lows have expressed their approval,"
Poston said.
The subcommittee mailed letters to
students soliciting feedback on the
issue three weeks ago and received a
petition signed by more than 300
freshmen in favor of eliminating the
priority.
Self interest
Subcommittee member Tom Peery
found that most arguments for retain

ing the present system "were made
from what people personally have to
gain." According to Sobotka, the most
vigorous supporters of the present sys
tem were residents of Lagunita and
Rohle.
The staff and resident assistants in
Lagunita and Rohle were among the
strongest supporters of the resolution.
Sobotka said the staff found the lack of
turnover was "severely limiting the
amount of new input" in Lagunita and
Roble.
The subcommittee decided not to
make its recommendation effective
until next autumn because of opposi
tion among this year's freshmen.
"Freshmen have come to expect that
they will return to their dorms,"
Sobotka said.
Starting with the 1977 spring's
draw, freshmen should no longer be
allowed present residence priority, the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) Subcommittee on Residences
recommended yesterday.
The recommendation, contained in
a resolution unanimously approved by
the four-member . subcommittee,
would end the advantage given to
freshmen living in four-class dor
mitories of returning to the residence
for the sophomore year.
Subcommittee Chairman Paul
Sobotka explained that the resolution
seeks to eliminate priority inequalities
between all-freshmen and four-class
dormitory residents.
"For a long time it (the system) has
been recognized as inequitable," said
Sobotka, who scheduled the item early
on this year's agenda.
Free choice
"It is our hope that freshmen will
choose their freshman experience
based solely on what they want for that
year and not subsequent living experi
ences," he said.
Most opponents of the recommenda
tion expressed concern that the con
tinuity of certain houses would be af
fected if the freshmen were not granted
priority to return, Sobotka explained.
He cited Cedro's theater program as an
example of a continuing house activity
in a four-class dorm.
The subcommittee's resolution does
not affect minority theme houses,
Sobotka pointed out, because theme
house residents are granted other
priorities in addition to present resi
dence preferences. The panel found
that, "the continuity that is important
in minority theme houses will be pre
served."
The resolution should reach COSS
next week, and COSS Chairman Dan
Poston predicted that the full commit
tee "will probably accept (the recom
mendation) at face value."
Poston added that COSS usually fol
lows the recommendations of its sub

committees because, "they've done
