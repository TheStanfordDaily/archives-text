# Secretary criticizes 'capricious' rate hikes
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
Describing increases in the Univer
sity employe car insurance rates as
"highly capricious," an Institute of
Communications Research secretary,
Libbv Kirk-Fulton, is examining other
University employe insurance rates to
determine if there is any basis for legal
action against the University's au
tomobile insurance agent.
University employes may purchase
Fireman's Fund automobile insurance
through the San Francisco insurance
brokerage Marsh and McLennan and
have the payments deducted directly
from their paychecks. This insurance
was the cheapest available until this
year, according to Kirk-Fulton.
Kirk-Fulton charges that the rates for
certain individuals for the 1976 fiscal
year have been raised excessively be
cause under the existing agreement,
"Marsh and McLennan has to insure
everyone who applies as a Stanford

employe," and therefore cannot accept
or reject applications on the basis of
their driving records.
Fred Lewis, a Marsh and McLennan
representative, said he was not at lib
erty to give out any information or
comment on the company's arrange
ment with Stanford without consult
ing the management of his company.

Kirk-Fulton has run a classified ad
vertisement in the Daily since last
Monday in an attempt to learn how
many University employes were hit
with unusual increases in their insur
ance rates. She said if there are enough
"erratic cases" she will consider "fol
lowing the case through" legally.As of
yesterday, she had learned of ten such
cases.
She cited the example of an emp
loye with a "clean driving record"
whose rate increased $90 for next year,
another employe whose rate went up
more than 50 percent, her own case in
which the rate was increased by almost
80 percent, and the case of a professor
whose rate doubled.
"They sent us a letter telling us that
the rates would go up," she said, "but
in no way did they give us an indica
tion that they would go up (as much as)
78.5 percent.
Undeserved
"I feel . . . that they are making me
pay penalties for something which
didn't happen ... If I'd had moving
(traffic) violations or an accident, I'd
have no quarrel. But nothing has hap
pened."
Kirk-Fulton said she checked with
the Insurance Information Institute in
San Francisco and found that insur
ance rates for the San Francisco area
went up an average of 15 to 28 percent
this year. She said that Best told her
that the average increase for Stanford
employes was 28 percent.
She also said that three insurance
companies with whom she checked,
State Farm, AAA and Fireman's Fund,
received upwards of 20 calls each from
Stanford employes in the last week,
asking about rates.
In her attempts to explain the rate
increases, Kirk-Fulton said she found
both Best and Marshal and McLennan
"evasive." "They (Marshal and
McLennan) said that they paid out
more in claims last year, and therefore,
they had to tighten up on rules and
regulations . . . But (they) would not
define that accurately."

that the average increase for Stanford
employes was 28 percent.
She also said that three insurance
companies with whom she checked,
State Farm, AAA and Fireman's Fund,
received upwards of 20 calls each from
Stanford employes in the last week,
asking about rates.
In her attempts to explain the rate
increases, Kirk-Fulton said she found
both Best and Marshal and McLennan
"evasive." "They (Marshal and
McLennan) said that they paid out
more in claims last year, and therefore,
they had to tighten up on rules and
regulations . . . But (they) would not
define that accurately."
Describing increases in the Univer
sity employe car insurance rates as
"highly capricious," an Institute of
Communications Research secretary,
Libbv Kirk-Fulton, is examining other
University employe insurance rates to
determine if there is any basis for legal
action against the University's au
tomobile insurance agent.
University employes may purchase
Fireman's Fund automobile insurance
through the San Francisco insurance
brokerage Marsh and McLennan and
have the payments deducted directly
from their paychecks. This insurance
was the cheapest available until this
year, according to Kirk-Fulton.
Kirk-Fulton charges that the rates for
certain individuals for the 1976 fiscal
year have been raised excessively be
cause under the existing agreement,
"Marsh and McLennan has to insure
everyone who applies as a Stanford

employe," and therefore cannot accept
or reject applications on the basis of
their driving records.
Fred Lewis, a Marsh and McLennan
representative, said he was not at lib
erty to give out any information or
comment on the company's arrange
ment with Stanford without consult
ing the management of his company.

Kirk-Fulton has run a classified ad
vertisement in the Daily since last
Monday in an attempt to learn how
many University employes were hit
with unusual increases in their insur
ance rates. She said if there are enough
"erratic cases" she will consider "fol
lowing the case through" legally.As of
yesterday, she had learned of ten such
cases.
She cited the example of an emp
loye with a "clean driving record"
whose rate increased $90 for next year,
another employe whose rate went up
more than 50 percent, her own case in
which the rate was increased by almost
80 percent, and the case of a professor
whose rate doubled.
"They sent us a letter telling us that
the rates would go up," she said, "but
in no way did they give us an indica
tion that they would go up (as much as)
78.5 percent.
Undeserved
"I feel . . . that they are making me
pay penalties for something which
didn't happen ... If I'd had moving
(traffic) violations or an accident, I'd
have no quarrel. But nothing has hap
pened."
Kirk-Fulton said she checked with
the Insurance Information Institute in
San Francisco and found that insur
ance rates for the San Francisco area
went up an average of 15 to 28 percent
this year. She said that Best told her
that the average increase for Stanford
employes was 28 percent.
