## Mascot vote 
### 
This week, the student body has an opportunity to
select a new mascot for its athletic teams: provided that
the University approves its choice. Students also have
a chance to express an opinion about an old one.
On the first, and perhaps more important, part of the
ballot, we urge students to vote a resounding "No" on
the question of whether to recommend the return of the
Indian as the school's mascot, and thus lay this issue to
rest once and for all.
The University showed an unusual amount of good
sense in ridding Stanford of the mascot almost four
years ago, and the reasons cited then remain valid
today. Any type of mascot relating to the Native
American heritage, whether a tasteless and silly "Ugh"
caricature, or an allegedly more "dignified" Indian,
complete with headdress, remains a stereotype and an
unfair and unfortunate one.
No group of people should be forced to see its tradi
tions ridiculed, especially at a prominent institution of
higher learning.
We believe that all students should vote, and vote
"No," so that there will be no question as to where the
student body stands on the issue. Anything less than a
full turnout may yield unrepresentative results.
We fear this latter possibility especially because of
the use to which such an unrepresentative response
might be put by the New Founders League (NFL). We
have heard the League's arguments, but do not agree.
Moreover, we seriously doubt whether the NFL repres
ents a fair cross-section of alumni opinion.
The second half of the ballot asks students to vote on
one of seven choices, the winner of which the ASSU
will then present to the University. We strongly feel
the Stanford Sequoia is most in keeping with the spirit
and traditions of the University. The mighty Sequoia
has long been on the Stanford emblem. We recommend
that students vote only for this, listing no second
choice.
We also find it unfortunate, that an ASSU Senate
Mascot Selection committee which saw fit to preclude
the Indian from its ballot then added yet another racist
stereotype, the Hun. In its most recent usage, the word
was a generic term for all Germans and things German
during World War I.
At that time, even the German language was forbid
den in schools, and German-Americans were ruth
lessly discriminated against by the society. We hope
students will ignore it entirely.
Another poor choice on the committee's list is the
Stanford Robber Barons. While no one can deny the
connection between this symbol and the University's
founding, it does not reflect the reality of the Univer
sity today.

rest once and for all.
The University showed an unusual amount of good
sense in ridding Stanford of the mascot almost four
years ago, and the reasons cited then remain valid
today. Any type of mascot relating to the Native
American heritage, whether a tasteless and silly "Ugh"
caricature, or an allegedly more "dignified" Indian,
complete with headdress, remains a stereotype and an
unfair and unfortunate one.
No group of people should be forced to see its tradi
tions ridiculed, especially at a prominent institution of
higher learning.
We believe that all students should vote, and vote
"No," so that there will be no question as to where the
student body stands on the issue. Anything less than a
full turnout may yield unrepresentative results.
We fear this latter possibility especially because of
the use to which such an unrepresentative response
might be put by the New Founders League (NFL). We
have heard the League's arguments, but do not agree.
Moreover, we seriously doubt whether the NFL repres
ents a fair cross-section of alumni opinion.
The second half of the ballot asks students to vote on
one of seven choices, the winner of which the ASSU
will then present to the University. We strongly feel
the Stanford Sequoia is most in keeping with the spirit
and traditions of the University. The mighty Sequoia
has long been on the Stanford emblem. We recommend
that students vote only for this, listing no second
choice.
We also find it unfortunate, that an ASSU Senate
Mascot Selection committee which saw fit to preclude
the Indian from its ballot then added yet another racist
stereotype, the Hun. In its most recent usage, the word
was a generic term for all Germans and things German
during World War I.
At that time, even the German language was forbid
den in schools, and German-Americans were ruth
lessly discriminated against by the society. We hope
students will ignore it entirely.
Another poor choice on the committee's list is the
Stanford Robber Barons. While no one can deny the
connection between this symbol and the University's
founding, it does not reflect the reality of the Univer
sity today.
This week, the student body has an opportunity to
select a new mascot for its athletic teams: provided that
the University approves its choice. Students also have
a chance to express an opinion about an old one.
On the first, and perhaps more important, part of the
ballot, we urge students to vote a resounding "No" on
the question of whether to recommend the return of the
Indian as the school's mascot, and thus lay this issue to
rest once and for all.
