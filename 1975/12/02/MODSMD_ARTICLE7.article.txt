# Equality in Israel

Harold Harowitz

The mind is boggled by the
fact that the Arab countries,
along with others, have the au
dacity to link Israel with racial
discrimination and therefore
call for the dismemberment of
the state. This is a case of the
murderer demanding the death
penalty for everyone else.
Let us briefly look at some of
the categories under which we
can contrast discrimination be
tween the Israeli and Arab
societies.
Political freedom — Arabs liv
ing in Israel have formed two na
tional political parties and con
sistently elect members to the Is
raeli parliament. In Syria, Jews
are not allowed to vote.
Religious freedom — All mos
ques in Israel are controlled and
administered by Moslems.
When the Old City if Jerusalem
was in Jordanian hands, tomb
stones from Jewish cemeteries in
the area were used to set the
foundations of The Holyland
Hotel.
Arabic papers
Freedom of speech —There
are numerous Arabic daily
newspapers printed and sold in
Israel. In Syria, there is a law
prohibiting the publication of
any materials in Hebrew.
Freedom of commerce
—Arabs in Israel can and do join
the trade unions in Israel and are
protected by the same
minimum-wage laws. Jews liv
ing in Syria are forbidden to
work anywhere but in the Jewish
ghetto in Damascus and can
only work for other Jews.
Freedom of movement — Is
rael maintains an open-border

policy between the administered
territories and Israel, between
the administered territories and
contiguous Arab states, and di
rectly between Arab countries
and Israel. Egypt denies Israelis
entry to the country.
Freedom of immigration —
All non-Jews can and do become
Israeli citizens by following
identical citizenship applica
tions as immigrants wishing to
take out U.S. citizenship. Egypt
does not allow Jews even to take
out resident visas.
No capital punishment
Political prisoners —Israel
does not sentence terrorists to
death, as capital punishment has
been outlawed. Iraq, among
othes, hangs those found
"guilty" of verbally supporting
Israel's right to exist.
Efforts to solve the Palestinian
problem — Israel refuses to sit
across the negotiating table from
Palestinian Liberation Organiza
tion head Yassar Arafat. He has
repeatedly called for the dis
memberment of the state of Is
rael. But would Congress
negotiate with those Native
Americans calling for destruc
tion of the United States?
Israel has, on the other hand,
poured millions of development
dollars into the West Bank (all in
grants and loans as opposed to
ownership) and has increased
the standard of living there more
than fourfold. Palestinians "liv
ing" in Arab states are confined
to the squalor of refugee camps.
The reader is left to draw his
own conclusions.

are numerous Arabic daily
newspapers printed and sold in
Israel. In Syria, there is a law
prohibiting the publication of
any materials in Hebrew.
Freedom of commerce
—Arabs in Israel can and do join
the trade unions in Israel and are
protected by the same
minimum-wage laws. Jews liv
ing in Syria are forbidden to
work anywhere but in the Jewish
ghetto in Damascus and can
only work for other Jews.
Freedom of movement — Is
rael maintains an open-border

policy between the administered
territories and Israel, between
the administered territories and
contiguous Arab states, and di
rectly between Arab countries
and Israel. Egypt denies Israelis
entry to the country.
Freedom of immigration —
All non-Jews can and do become
Israeli citizens by following
identical citizenship applica
tions as immigrants wishing to
take out U.S. citizenship. Egypt
does not allow Jews even to take
out resident visas.
No capital punishment
Political prisoners —Israel
does not sentence terrorists to
death, as capital punishment has
been outlawed. Iraq, among
othes, hangs those found
"guilty" of verbally supporting
Israel's right to exist.
Efforts to solve the Palestinian
problem — Israel refuses to sit
across the negotiating table from
Palestinian Liberation Organiza
tion head Yassar Arafat. He has
repeatedly called for the dis
memberment of the state of Is
rael. But would Congress
negotiate with those Native
Americans calling for destruc
tion of the United States?
Israel has, on the other hand,
poured millions of development
dollars into the West Bank (all in
grants and loans as opposed to
ownership) and has increased
the standard of living there more
than fourfold. Palestinians "liv
ing" in Arab states are confined
to the squalor of refugee camps.

The mind is boggled by the
fact that the Arab countries,
along with others, have the au
dacity to link Israel with racial
discrimination and therefore
call for the dismemberment of
the state. This is a case of the
murderer demanding the death
penalty for everyone else.
Let us briefly look at some of
the categories under which we
can contrast discrimination be
tween the Israeli and Arab
societies.
Political freedom — Arabs liv
ing in Israel have formed two na
tional political parties and con
sistently elect members to the Is
raeli parliament. In Syria, Jews
are not allowed to vote.
Religious freedom — All mos
ques in Israel are controlled and
administered by Moslems.
When the Old City if Jerusalem
was in Jordanian hands, tomb
stones from Jewish cemeteries in
the area were used to set the
foundations of The Holyland
Hotel.
