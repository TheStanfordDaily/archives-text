AN OPEN LETTER TO THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY STUDENT BODY:
Through the discovery and integration of certain principles, a contemporary innovator and ideological giant has
made it possible for individuals to build RATIONAL AND MORAL SOLUTIONS TO ALL OF MANKIND'S MOST
CHALLENGING SOCIETAL PROBLEMS!
A physicist, his monumental intellectual achievements have now enabled you to promote your thinking to a
considerably higher level, thereby giving much greater potential meaning and significance to your own ac
complishments. Because these concepts have such profound relevance to your lives and the future of our entire
civilization, I'm thrilled to call their existence to your attention.
These ideas, naturally, remain the property of their author, who does not want any notoriety. Accordingly, this
letter may at times seem vague, but is designed to preclude the possibility of promiscuous disclosure. The ideas
are so important they will increasingly influence the lives of all men in the centuries to come, and in my opinion,
have ensured his role in "The Ascent of Man" as the most prominent of them all.
Because of the universal importance of this scientist, I might suggest that readers retain this issue of the Stanford
Daily in your files for future reference.
Because major innovators throughout history have all too often been subjected to various forms of attack by the
"masses", access to these truly magmficient concepts will be limited exclusively to those individual achievers and
entrepeneurs having the highest degrees of integrity, curiosity, rationality and character, as determined by this
writer. Using VANGUARD 21 as a filtering mechanism, I hope that many of you who choose to respond meet the
required criteria, and go on to help build a better world in which all of mankind can live in Freedom.
Opportunities for high-caliber, qualified individuals are literally unlimited, and you will be introduced to the
greatest possible wealth that one could ever hope to acquire.
I bring you this "good news" because events throughout the world community in the past several years have led
untold millions of skeptical, disillusioned, frustrated and otherwise bewildered people to conclude that man is not
capable of dealing with an overwhelming array of seemingly insurmountable global problems in a rational and
moral manner. As I indicated at the beginning, this is not true.
With inflation, terrorism, war, "Big Brother", riots, the so-called energy "crisis", pollution of the environment,
repression, unemployment lines and economic upheaval, taxes, lack of respect for property, urban decay, van
dalism, financial crises, bureaucracy, and all other social ailments and forms of coercion - the questionable
future of our species has often looked rather bleak. The threats of major catastrophe or even total extinction
continue to haunt us.
If you as an individual can relate to the aforementioned personal qualities, and desire to live in a positive, just and
durable social structure in which Freedom prevails, and in which the individual's incentive to create, to achieve
and to accomplish will flourish as never before, then an exciting, profitable and challenging future awaits you.
Please enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your inquiry.
Should you eventually qualify, you can join a select group of individuals who are investing their talents and
energies in the name of progress, thereby quietly ushenng in THE MOST MARVELOUS MOMENT OF MAN!

Daily in your files for future reference.
Because major innovators throughout history have all too often been subjected to various forms of attack by the
"masses", access to these truly magmficient concepts will be limited exclusively to those individual achievers and
entrepeneurs having the highest degrees of integrity, curiosity, rationality and character, as determined by this
writer. Using VANGUARD 21 as a filtering mechanism, I hope that many of you who choose to respond meet the
required criteria, and go on to help build a better world in which all of mankind can live in Freedom.
Opportunities for high-caliber, qualified individuals are literally unlimited, and you will be introduced to the
greatest possible wealth that one could ever hope to acquire.
I bring you this "good news" because events throughout the world community in the past several years have led
untold millions of skeptical, disillusioned, frustrated and otherwise bewildered people to conclude that man is not
capable of dealing with an overwhelming array of seemingly insurmountable global problems in a rational and
moral manner. As I indicated at the beginning, this is not true.
With inflation, terrorism, war, "Big Brother", riots, the so-called energy "crisis", pollution of the environment,
repression, unemployment lines and economic upheaval, taxes, lack of respect for property, urban decay, van
dalism, financial crises, bureaucracy, and all other social ailments and forms of coercion - the questionable
future of our species has often looked rather bleak. The threats of major catastrophe or even total extinction
continue to haunt us.
If you as an individual can relate to the aforementioned personal qualities, and desire to live in a positive, just and
durable social structure in which Freedom prevails, and in which the individual's incentive to create, to achieve
and to accomplish will flourish as never before, then an exciting, profitable and challenging future awaits you.
Please enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your inquiry.
Should you eventually qualify, you can join a select group of individuals who are investing their talents and
energies in the name of progress, thereby quietly ushenng in THE MOST MARVELOUS MOMENT OF MAN!

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY STUDENT BODY:
Through the discovery and integration of certain principles, a contemporary innovator and ideological giant has
made it possible for individuals to build RATIONAL AND MORAL SOLUTIONS TO ALL OF MANKIND'S MOST
CHALLENGING SOCIETAL PROBLEMS!
A physicist, his monumental intellectual achievements have now enabled you to promote your thinking to a
considerably higher level, thereby giving much greater potential meaning and significance to your own ac
complishments. Because these concepts have such profound relevance to your lives and the future of our entire
civilization, I'm thrilled to call their existence to your attention.
These ideas, naturally, remain the property of their author, who does not want any notoriety. Accordingly, this
letter may at times seem vague, but is designed to preclude the possibility of promiscuous disclosure. The ideas
are so important they will increasingly influence the lives of all men in the centuries to come, and in my opinion,
have ensured his role in "The Ascent of Man" as the most prominent of them all.
Because of the universal importance of this scientist, I might suggest that readers retain this issue of the Stanford
Daily in your files for future reference.
