# Tours, Berlin axe programs for summer
## 
### STEVE SCHILLER 
The programs in Tours and Berlin
planned for the summer of 1976 have
been cancelled for academic and fi
nancial reasons, Assoc. Overseas
Studies Director Donald Price an
nounced yesterday.
The main problem, according to
Price, was difficulty in hiring suita
ble faculty for the summer, an unpopu
lar time to teach.
In addition, he said, no French stu
dents reside in the University of Tours
dormitories in the summer, which
would eliminate interaction between
French and Stanford students. Price
said that has been considered a valu
able part of the Tours program.
Berliners leave
Price said housing with local
families in Berlin would not be availa
ble over the summer, since many
families willing to board Stanford stu
dents spend the summer at their coun
try homes.
Neither summer program will be
reopened in the future for these
reasons, according to Price.
Price said Overseas Studies will
save $25,000 this year and, in the long
run, up to $35,000 per year because of
the cancellations. Although the Over
seas Office is planning to cut its budget
by 50 percent over three years, Price
emphasized that the decision was
prompted by "not so much financial as
academic" reasons.
Florence and Cliveden
The popular Florence and Cliveden
programs have experienced none of
the faculty or housing problems and
will continue next summer, Price said.
The Overseas Studies Office is ex
periencing a continuing increase in
applications. Although the cancella
tion of the Berlin and Tours summer
programs will reduce the total, Price
said he anticipates a nine percent rise
in the number of participants over last
year.
Price also said he expects longer
waiting listsand fiercer competition to
attend the campuses, noting a "surge
of interest for winter-spring." He urges
students to apply for fall quarter, when
they are "assured of a place."
