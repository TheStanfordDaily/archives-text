# FBI, Army promote terrorism
## 
### 
Recent investigations into the
illegal domestic operations of
American intelligence agencies,
most notably the FBI, CIA, IRS
and National Security Agency,
have focused almost exclusively
on the excessive zeal with which
these agencies spied, opened
mail and built files on millions
of Americans.
An even more frightening
story remains to be told: how
these agencies financed and di
rected right-wing terrorist
groups to destroy leftist political
opposition in America.
In mid-1973, in a little noticed
article, the New York Times
revealed that in 1971 the FBI
founded and financed the San
Diego-based paramilitary Secret
Army Organization (SAO).
The leader of the SAO, FBI in
former Howard Godfrey, "was
considered a 'firebrand' within
the organization and took a
'more militant line' than most
members," according to the
Times.
Murder plot
Godfrey later admitted in
court that he took part in an as
sasination attempt against leftist
planners of an anti-GOP de
monstration; one woman was
shot and her elbow was shat
tered. After the shooting, God
frey handed the gun over to his
FBI contact, who suppressed the
evidence for six months.
According to a study by the
American Civil Liberties Union,
the SAO carried out espionage,
vandalism, mail theft, bombings
and shootings on FBI instruc
tions.
A San Diego paper, The Door,
reported that SAO leaders even
met with Watergate saboteur
Donald Segretti to discuss plans
for kidnaping radicals who
might disrupt the GOP conven
tion planned for San Diego.
Only after the SAO blew up a
local movie theater did law en
forcement officials finally crack
down on the group. Until then,
the SAO had acted with impun
ity to terrorize suspected radi
cals.
As former Southern California

SAO coordinator Jerry Davis
summed it up after his convic
tion on charges of possession of
explosives: "You might say that
the SAO was a federally funded
antipoverty program for the
right wing."
Right-wing terror
A strikingly similar organiza
tion terrorized and disrupted
dissidents in Chicago â€” the Leg
ion of Justice, whose slogan was
"Treason must be punished."
The U.S. Army 113 th Military
Intelligence Group and the
Chicago Police Department fi
nanced and directed the
Legion's attacks on socialists,
blacks, antiwar activists and
community organizers.
Chicago police recently ad
mitted to conducting a massive
intelligence operation against
numerous community groups,
including the Citizens Action
Program (which opposed con
struction of a freeway favored by
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley),
and the Lawyers Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law,
founded by President John F.
Kennedy in 1963.
A Chicago grand jury recently
concluded that these operations
had "all the earmarks of a police
state." And the Legion of Justice
brought Chicago one step closer
to that nightmare.
Stolen documents
The Legion's activities first
came to light in Nov. 1973, when
a former Army intelligence
agent, John O'Brien, testified re
garding the Legion's efforts to
spy on and disrupt the Chicago
Seven defense, on behalf of the
Chicago police, Army Intellig
ence and the White House
(through convicted Watergate
saboteur G. Gordon Liddy).

O'Brien said intelligence re
ports on the case, based on stolen
documents, were sent to the Pen
tagon, FBI and the Secret Ser
vice.
In late 1969, Legion of Justice
members stormed the Chicago
offices of the Socialist Workers
Party. Armed with Mace and
chemical spray grenades sup
plied by the U.S. Army, they as
saulted four persons and stole
records and a cash box.
Over the course of the next
year, the Legion repeatedly
staged raids against leftist or
ganizations, in some cases brut
ally attacking their members and
sending them to the hospital.
The Legion also set off tear gas
grenades at performances of a
Russian dance company and a
Chinese acrobatic troupe.

Most amazingly, it committed
armed robbery against the Our
Lady of the Mount Church in
Cicero, 111. on June 27, 1970.
All of these activities, accord
ing to court testimony, were
sanctioned by the Chicago
police and even the U.S. Army.
Only this year has the hidden
story of Legion activities fully
come to light.
SAO and Legion of Justice are
almost certainly not unique, al
though they are the best known
examples of government
directed terrorist organizations.
The full extent of the horrors
perpetrated by the U.S. govern
ment against its citizens can
only be guessed.
