From the heart
Editor:
The greatest thing that has
ever happened to me is the
chance to thank the Stanford
community for its remem
brances of me during my recent
hospitalization.
During my 62 days in the hos
pital. the greatest medicine 1 re
ceived was the love and atten
tion I got from my many friends.
This alone gave me strength and
played a big part in my being
able to return home this week.
I received 716 cards, 52 bou
quets of flowers, two small trees,
two plaques, 11 boxes of candy,
seven cologne sets and about 50
pounds of fruit.
The telephone and the televi
sion set in my room were paid for
with the $100 given me by the
Black Students Union and the
Black Cultural Center.
1 also want to thank the hun
dreds of visitors 1 had. Further
more, 1 appreciate the food dis
posal I was given for my home
and 1 was pleased that the Fa
culty Club's board, manager and
staff stood by me 100 percent.
Once again, let me thank
everyone from the bottom of my
heart.

Martial arts
Editor:
1 was chagrined to discover
thatLori Matsukawa's feature ar
ticle on martial arts (Daily Nov.
26) failed to mention the innova
tive and immensely popular
self-defense curriculum de
veloped by Ronald Blankenhorn
of the Physical Education De
partment.
Blankenhorn, a master of six
martial art forms, has synth
esized a unique situation
oriented approach to self
defense from elementary princi
ples to karate, ju-jitsu, medita
tion, and common sense.
