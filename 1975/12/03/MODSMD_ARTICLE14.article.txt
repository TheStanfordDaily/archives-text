# Israel unfair to Arabs

### 
The U.N. Assembly resolution equating
Zionism with racism merely highlights an already
recognizable fact of international life today. The
main axiom of Zionism is that all Jews from all
over the world have a prescriptive right to settle in
Palestine.
An equally important constitutive principle of
the Zionist State is the denial of the right of native
Palestinian Arabs to their land and to self-deter
mination in that land.
Since Moslem and Christian Arabs living in the
state of Israel do not belong to the chosen race,
they are treated as second class citizens.
Successive leaders of Israel prior to the 1973
Yom Kippur war even denied the existence of any
Palestinian entity.
Israel claims to represent the Jews all over the
world by playing a "central role in Jewish life"; it
assumes the responsibility "for their safeguard
everywhere" "and invites all Jews to migrate"
from the countries they are living in with the
guarantee of obtaining citizenship even before
migration.
The U.N. resolution is based on no new discov
ery. The original philosophy of political Zionism
essentially envisaged a racial movement. And Is
raeli leaders have never concealed the fact that
Israel is reserved for persons belonging to the
Jewish race.

seas Jews have been the basic postulates of Israel's
political philosophy, and its leaders have been
candid enough to acknowledge this fact.
David Ben Gurion told his Mapai Party in 1952:
"1 accept to form the Cabinet on one condition —
to utilize all possible means to expand towards
the south."
Moshe Dayan told his people on Feb. 12, 1955:
"It lies upon the peoples' shoulder to prepare for
the war, but it lies upon the Israeli arm to carry out
the fight with the ultimate object of erecting the
Israeli empire."
Understandably, the effect of Zionism and
apartheid—universally condemned as the worst
form of man's cruelty to man — has been about the
same. In the land of apartheid, the 15 million
black inhabitants of the country have been hud
dled into wastelands, comprising no more than 13
percent of the land area, while the four million
white settlers have appropriated to themselves
the best of the lands.
While hundreds of thousands of original in
habitants, the Palestinians Arabs, were driven out
of the land through force or fraud, those still liv
ing there have no share in political power and are
excluded from the privileges allowed to Jews.
The Jewish faith is one thing; Zionism seeking
to usurp others' lands by war and massacre in the
name of race and religions quite another.
