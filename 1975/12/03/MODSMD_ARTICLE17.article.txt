## Financial finagling: 'Everyone cheats (except me)' 
### J. KELLY BUFTON 
When that friend who gets a
bundle of financial aid roars off
in his 1976 Porsche, do you ever
get the feeling he might have
fudged a bit declaring his par
ents' income to get that aid?
Or when the Financial Aids
Office turns down your request
for money do you ever wish you
hadn't been quite so honest on
that statement?
Sentiment on campus seems
to be widespread that cheating
on that all-important Parents'
Confidential Statement (PCS) is
at a fairly high level, but no one
can pinpoint any cases.
"Sure, lots of people cheat on
those things," one junior says,
"but not me."
National spotlight
Possibly, part of the reason for
this pervasive attitude is the
prevalence of national news on
the subject. Both Newsweek and
U.S. News and World Report
have recently covered the sub
ject, reporting it is a major prob
lem in most college financial
aids offices.
Possibly, students know more
specifics than they are willing to

reveal. But it is more probable
that students don't see any
checks on the accuracy of the
PCS, and therefore assume that it
is easy to cheat and is done all
the time.
However, according to Finan
cial Aids Director Robert Huff,
none of the above perceptions
are true â€” at least not at Stan
ford, and, he says, increasingly
across the country.
Huff says he strongly dislikes
the word "cheating" when dis
cussing the problem. He prefers
to talk about "inaccuracies,"
"misreporting" or "underesti
mation of income."
Scrutinized
Huff relates that the PCS forms
which come into his office go
through several stages of
scrutiny. First, the College Scho
larship Service (CSS), which
coordinates financial aid across
the country, reviews the applica
tion for aid and computes the pa
rental contribution based on the
PCS.
Second, Huff's staff checks the
PCS for all applicants and
changes the CSS estimation of
contribution if deemed neces-

sary. Third, Huff himself reads
all the PCS forms of incoming
freshmen.
At each stage of the process,
the parents' tax return can be re
quested from the parents to ver
ify information if any item seems
to be inconsistent.
"There are several built-in
checks in the PCS," Huff says,
which give his staff some basis
for requesting the returns.
"For instance," he notes, "if a
family reports a $4000 income
and a $100,000 house, we might
be a bit suspicious."
Subtle checks
Other built-in checks in the
PCS are "much more subtle,"
Huff says, adding that he doesn't
wish to elaborate on these other
checks for fear of reducing their
effectiveness.
Even after financial aid has
been granted. Huff says the Fi
nancial Aids Office maintains
checks on the accuracy of the
PCS. Two years ago, a random

sampling of income tax returns
was instituted. That year, i! 5
percent of the people getting aid
were requested to supply tax re
turns.
Now the percentage has been
lowered to around 10 percent,
Huff says, because of the low in
cidence of inaccuracies.
"We only find about eight per
cent of the people underestimate
their income to a significant de
gree," he adds. Surprisingly, the
office also finds almost the same
number who overestimate their
income.
Nationally, the picture is not
nearly as bright as the one Huff
paints for Stanford. The Educa
tional Testing Service, under
whose auspices the CSS oper
ates, recently released a study on
the accuracy of PCS forms conn
pared to tax reports.
The study reported that 17.9
percent of the families report
more income to IRS than to CSS,
while nine percent report less

income.
Among higher income brack
ets the problem is even greater.
Nearly 40 percent of those apply
ing, whose parents' income is in
the $20,000-30,000 bracket,
would be required to have a
higher parental contribution, if
IRS forms were used for finan
cial aid determination.
Huff states that one of the main
causes for "underestimation" is
the time lag between filing PCS
and income tax reports.
Huff says he feels that the CSS
ought to make filing of the PCS
with a tax statement mandatory
to alleviate many of its problems.
He further notes that because of
recent changes resulting in the
lowering of expectations of pa
rental contributions, the strain
on middle income brackets has
been lessened.
This, he claims, could elimi
nate some of the incentive to de
liberately underestimate in
come.
