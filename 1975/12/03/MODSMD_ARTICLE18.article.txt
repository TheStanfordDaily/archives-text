Is anal intercourse safe? How should it be performed?
Anal intercourse is, as The Joy Of Sex put it, "something which
nearly every couple tries once.'' Further experimentation depends
a lot on how long it takes before the woman can sit down again.
Some people find that it offers increased sensitivity and tightness,
but others just consider it a pain in the butt.
Anal intercourse cun cause injury, since the opening involved
was designed for output, not input; so the man should be extremely
gentle. "With the woman kneeling head down, lubricate the glans
of the penis with oil or Vaseline (saliva isn't good enough). Put the
glans to the spot and press gently and steadily, while she 'bears
down' to let it in. Go in slowly, never more than glans deep, and
take your friction on the pull rather than the push." (The Joy Of
Sex)
By the way, I'm obliged to tell you that anal sex is illegal in
California until January 1, and in most other states. Anal inter
course is legal in the following jurisdictions:
Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii,
Illinois, Maryland. Ohio and Oregon.
