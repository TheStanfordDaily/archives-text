# Hargadon blasts Howard Report
## 
### BERT BOWER 
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
severely criticized the conclusions of
the Howard Report, a recent student
investigation of admissions and finan
cial aid policies, during a KZSU Cam
pus Conference interview last night.
"The authors of the report seem to
make many assertions based on weak
evidence," Hargadon declared.
He blasted the report's allegation
that the intellectual atmosphere at
Stanford has become "an ivory tower
environment" dominated by wealthy
students. He accused the report of
using randomly chosen facts to back
up its arguments.
According to Hargadon, the report
has had "no particular impact" within
the administration. He said, however,
"It is legitimate to question the as
sumption that admission policies
should to be admit the most academi
cally talented students."

But he reiterated his belief that
Stanford's social responsibility is
"to provide a place for the most
academically able students to
flourish."
Responding to the report's assertion
that the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA) is merely his puppet, Har
gadon said, "I don't work for or against
C-UAFA. But 1 have a position of ongo
ing responsibility and if 1 exercise
poor judgment I can be fired."
The report claims that Hargadon is
the "gatekeeper" of the University be
cause he has the ultimate responsibil
ity to decide who is admitted or re
jected.
"I don't know where the authors of
the report got their information on
that," he declared. "The fact is, 1 don't
sit there and willy-nilly decide who
will be admitted. I have an exDeri-
enced staff and many guidelines to
help me."
The Howard Report states that
Stanford's admission policies screen
out "creative, free thinking" individu
als by emphasizing grade point aver
ages and Scholastic Apptitude Test
scores. The report recommends an
"offbeat admissions office" to reserve
150 spaces for students from "non
traditional" backgounds.
"Stanford doesn't need hula
hoopers," responded Hargadon. "In
fact, we should have a higher number

of intellectually gifted students on fi
nancial aid to increase intellectual
ferment."
He rejected the report's recommen
dation to set up an admissions com
mittee to include the dean of admis
sions, dean of undergraduate studies, a
faculty member and a student. The
committee would make final admis
sion decisions.
"It's more efficient to do admissions
with a professional staff. 1 don't think a
student or a faculty member could af
ford the time to do admissions in the
way it should be done," he said.
