# Crude oil substitute must be found soon
## 
### DAVE SARTORIS 
Very little time remains to find
a suitable replacement for crude
oil as an energy resource, ac
cording to Henry Linden, presi
dent of the Institute of Gas Tech
nology and an expert on coal
gasification.
Speaking Monday on the
"Technical and Economic Issues
in Energy Policy," Linden noted
that estimates of potential U.S.
supplies of natural gas and pet
roleum liquids have been re
vised downward quite sharply
during the last two years.
"The implication of this sup
ply projection is that world oil
prices can be expected to rise
precipitously in the relatively
near term," he said.
"A realistic estimate is that
our oil reserves will become
limiting within 25 years, too
short a time to develop an en
tirely new alternative," Linden
said, explaining that, "In the
past, it has taken about 60 years
to change from the predominant
use of one energy form to
another."
He observed that facts such as
these are incentive for the im
mediate development of synthe
tic fuels.
"There has been continuing
consensus that high-BTU gas

from coal will make a significant
contribution to U.S. energy sup
ply by 1985 (because) the six an
nounced gasification projects
plus planned expansions alone
would produce the equivalent of
750,000 barrels of oil per day,"
he said.
Linden pointed out several
advantages of converting coal to
synthetic fuels rather than to
electricity.
"Synthetic fuels afford much
higher thermal efficiency, and
may be produced at high load
factors in plants because they
can be stored relatively
cheaply," he said. "In addition,
the transportation cost of hy
drocarbon fuels is relatively low
compared with electricity."
However, Linden said alter
nate sources of energy supply
"most likely will come in the
form of either a nuclear or com
bined nuclear-solar economy."
He warned that low-cost
uranium resources would make
a negligible impact on total
world energy resources if li
mited to use in burner reactors. If
used in breeder reactors, how
ever, "total uranium oxide re
sources correspond to 10 to 15
times the energy supply in the
total remaining recoverable fos
sil fuel resources," he said.
