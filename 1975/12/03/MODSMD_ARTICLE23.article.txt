# Two losses, but...
## Scotchers play well 
### JOHN ROOS PERRY SIMON 
The scotchers of Stanford
University outwitted their
nationwide rivals last weekend
by knocking themselves out of
the national championships
quickly enough to enjoy a relax
ful Thanksgiving dinner in Har
risonburg, West Virginia.
Stanford dropped both its
games last Thursday, losing to
William and Mary, 5-1, in the
first round. Five hours later, they
were eliminated from the conso
lation bracket by losing to Woos
ter College of Ohio, 3-1.
Third-seeded William and
Mary proved to be the tougher of

Stanford's two opponents. A
mere three minutes into the
game, Stanford was already trail
ing by three goals.
"Stanford was startled at the
beginning of the game," said as
sistant coach Carla Soracco. "We
were almost overwhelmed by
the circumstances."
In the clouds
Goalie Betsy Morris put it dif
ferently. "We were completely
in the clouds during those first
few minutes."
But Stanford wouldn't say die.
After being blown away at the
outset, the Scotchers held their
own for the remainder of the
game, and were generally
pleased with their performance.
"Our team was resourceful
enough to fight back and stop the
game from becoming a rout," ac
cording to Soracco.
Still, Stanford was only able to
score one goal, trailing 4-0 in the
second half. It came from
scotcher Kathy Levinson, who
suffered a broken cheekbone and
was seeing double much of the
second half.
Evening sun
As the sun was setting over
Harrisonburg, the scotchers trot
ted on to the astroturf football
field to shake their sticks at
Wooster College.
Early in the second half, de
spite aggressive offensive play
by Stanford, Wooster had in
creased its lead to 3-0.
As a fitting tribute to the end of
a fine season, the scotchers were
treatedto a host of banquets,
parades, and sightseeing excur
sions during their five-day odys
sey, including a visit to Mon
ticello and a private sitting with
Abraham Lincoln at his memor
ial.
