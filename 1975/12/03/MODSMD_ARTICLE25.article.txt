# Broncos nudge Cards to unveil new pavilion
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Call it youth. Call it overconfi
dence. Call it a slippery ball . . .
Hell, take your pick. But it'll
still go down as coach Dick Di-
Biaso' first loss as Stanford bas
ketball mentor. The Cards
charitably handed Santa Clara a
70-67 win in the dedication
game of the Broncos' futuristic
$4.5 million Toso Pavilion
Monday night.
The Cards, who amazed Ma
ples Pavilion fans last week with
their aggressiveness, amazed
Santa Clara statisticians with2l
turnovers, 14 of which came in
the second half.
"We showed our youth to
night," said Dißiaso. "You don't
have turnovers when you're
playing as a team."
Early lead
Santa Clara got off to an early
lead, in a first half which saw the
advantage change hands five
times. But then guard Mike Bratz
showed that his last weekend
was no fluke as he began to hit
the 20-footers which dazed Ma
ples' crowd last weekend, and
the Cards moved to a 12-11 lead
after 6:42 of play. At that point,
Clara's 6-foot-5 guard Ves
ter Williams, whose 16 first-half
points kept the Broncos in the
ball game, moved Santa Clara to
a 20-14 lead.
But the Broncos hit as cold
spell, as Stanford ran off nine
straight points to gain the lead,
and hit another eight before
Santa Clara could score again.
The Cards, playing as a team,
•""la comfortable 43-34 lead, as
the Stanford Band returned
Santa Clara chants of "We are
SC," with "no you're not, you're
Santa Clara."
11-point edge
Stanford moved ahead by 11
points at 53-42 before the Bron

cos finally awoke in the second
half. This time it was Santa Clara
guard Mike Leslie who aroused
his teammates and the
standing-room-only crowd of
5000, with three 20-footers and a
steal.
"Robinson had a great first
half," said Santa Clara coach
Carrol Williams, "but he wore
himself out. Mike Leslie came in
for him and helped us against
the zone."
Santa Clara reeled off 27
points, while Stanford was col
lecting just 10 and turning over
the ball 14 times. For a while it
seemed that Santa Clara couldn't
miss, as jumper after jumper
cracked the porous Card zone.
Four-guard team
But Stanford, with a four
guard offense, still managed to
hold onto a 63-58 lead midway
through the period. Then the
roof — in this case the world's
third largest teflon-coated
fiberglass ceiling held in place
by fans — fell in for Stanford.
The Broncos held the Cards
scoreless foMVi minutes. An old
friend, retired Pacific Eight re
feree Ernie Filiberti, who has
been hired by the West Coast
Athletic Conference, returned to
greet Stanford, calling 22 Card
fouls to 12 for Santa Clara. For
ward George Schader was a
casualty, playing just 13 mi
nutes.
With eight minutes left Santa
Clara hit a free throw to move to
63-59. Then Leslie stole the ball
in Stanford's backcourt and hit a
layup —63-61. Enter Robinson,
well rested from his first half ex
ploits, to feed teammate Steve
McGee for the tying basket.
Then the Cards were unable to
get a basket in four trips down
court and it was 69-63 with 3:59
left. But maybe all the ear
shattering noise their own fans

were maing bothered the Bron
cos, as they tried to give the
game back to Stanford.
Santa Clara choke
Santa Clara missed free throw
after free throw while in a bonus
situation— five of six including
four of the firsj shots in one
plus-one situations and Stanford
moved to within two at 69-67.
But that was as close as Stanford
got. Freshman guard Paul
Giovacchini took the last Card
shot and it seemed to sum up the
whole game, rolling around the
rim and falling — the Broncos
had dedicated their basketball
showplace.
"This is the greatest win we've
had in this Pavilion," smiled
Williams after the game.
Dißiaso wasn't smiling over in
the visitors' dressing room.
"They came at us in the second
half and we didn't respond. We
couldn't get control of the tempo
of the game."
Stanford shot a meager 45.8
percent in the second half (11 of
24). But the real story lies in the
free throw column. Stanford was
awarded just six free
throws while the Broncos were
given 24.
Well, chalk this one up to in
experience, and bring on 12th
ranked USF and its seven-foot
freshman center Bill Cartwright
Friday evening in Maples.
Knowing Dißiaso, the Cards will
be ready.

times. But then guard Mike Bratz
showed that his last weekend
was no fluke as he began to hit
the 20-footers which dazed Ma
ples' crowd last weekend, and
the Cards moved to a 12-11 lead
after 6:42 of play. At that point,
Clara's 6-foot-5 guard Ves
ter Williams, whose 16 first-half
points kept the Broncos in the
ball game, moved Santa Clara to
a 20-14 lead.
But the Broncos hit as cold
spell, as Stanford ran off nine
straight points to gain the lead,
and hit another eight before
Santa Clara could score again.
The Cards, playing as a team,
•""la comfortable 43-34 lead, as
the Stanford Band returned
Santa Clara chants of "We are
SC," with "no you're not, you're
Santa Clara."
11-point edge
Stanford moved ahead by 11
points at 53-42 before the Bron

cos finally awoke in the second
half. This time it was Santa Clara
guard Mike Leslie who aroused
his teammates and the
standing-room-only crowd of
5000, with three 20-footers and a
steal.
"Robinson had a great first
half," said Santa Clara coach
Carrol Williams, "but he wore
himself out. Mike Leslie came in
for him and helped us against
the zone."
Santa Clara reeled off 27
points, while Stanford was col
lecting just 10 and turning over
the ball 14 times. For a while it
seemed that Santa Clara couldn't
miss, as jumper after jumper
cracked the porous Card zone.
Four-guard team
But Stanford, with a four
guard offense, still managed to
hold onto a 63-58 lead midway
through the period. Then the
roof — in this case the world's
third largest teflon-coated
fiberglass ceiling held in place
by fans — fell in for Stanford.
The Broncos held the Cards
scoreless foMVi minutes. An old
friend, retired Pacific Eight re
feree Ernie Filiberti, who has
been hired by the West Coast
Athletic Conference, returned to
greet Stanford, calling 22 Card
fouls to 12 for Santa Clara. For
ward George Schader was a
casualty, playing just 13 mi
nutes.
With eight minutes left Santa
Clara hit a free throw to move to
63-59. Then Leslie stole the ball
in Stanford's backcourt and hit a
layup —63-61. Enter Robinson,
well rested from his first half ex
ploits, to feed teammate Steve
McGee for the tying basket.
Then the Cards were unable to
get a basket in four trips down
court and it was 69-63 with 3:59
left. But maybe all the ear
shattering noise their own fans

were maing bothered the Bron
cos, as they tried to give the
game back to Stanford.
Santa Clara choke
Santa Clara missed free throw
after free throw while in a bonus
situation— five of six including
four of the firsj shots in one
plus-one situations and Stanford
moved to within two at 69-67.
But that was as close as Stanford
got. Freshman guard Paul
Giovacchini took the last Card
shot and it seemed to sum up the
whole game, rolling around the
rim and falling — the Broncos
had dedicated their basketball
showplace.
"This is the greatest win we've
had in this Pavilion," smiled
Williams after the game.
Dißiaso wasn't smiling over in
the visitors' dressing room.
"They came at us in the second
half and we didn't respond. We
couldn't get control of the tempo
of the game."
Stanford shot a meager 45.8
percent in the second half (11 of
24). But the real story lies in the
free throw column. Stanford was
awarded just six free
throws while the Broncos were
given 24.
Well, chalk this one up to in
experience, and bring on 12th
ranked USF and its seven-foot
freshman center Bill Cartwright
Friday evening in Maples.
Knowing Dißiaso, the Cards will
be ready.
Call it youth. Call it overconfi
dence. Call it a slippery ball . . .
Hell, take your pick. But it'll
still go down as coach Dick Di-
Biaso' first loss as Stanford bas
ketball mentor. The Cards
charitably handed Santa Clara a
70-67 win in the dedication
game of the Broncos' futuristic
$4.5 million Toso Pavilion
Monday night.
The Cards, who amazed Ma
ples Pavilion fans last week with
their aggressiveness, amazed
Santa Clara statisticians with2l

11-point edge
Stanford moved ahead by 11
points at 53-42 before the Bron

cos finally awoke in the second
half. This time it was Santa Clara
guard Mike Leslie who aroused
his teammates and the
standing-room-only crowd of
5000, with three 20-footers and a
steal.
"Robinson had a great first
half," said Santa Clara coach
Carrol Williams, "but he wore
himself out. Mike Leslie came in
for him and helped us against
the zone."
Santa Clara reeled off 27
points, while Stanford was col
lecting just 10 and turning over
the ball 14 times. For a while it
seemed that Santa Clara couldn't
miss, as jumper after jumper
cracked the porous Card zone.
Four-guard team
But Stanford, with a four
guard offense, still managed to
hold onto a 63-58 lead midway
through the period. Then the
roof — in this case the world's
third largest teflon-coated
fiberglass ceiling held in place
by fans — fell in for Stanford.
The Broncos held the Cards
scoreless foMVi minutes. An old
friend, retired Pacific Eight re
feree Ernie Filiberti, who has
been hired by the West Coast
Athletic Conference, returned to
greet Stanford, calling 22 Card
fouls to 12 for Santa Clara. For
ward George Schader was a
casualty, playing just 13 mi
nutes.
With eight minutes left Santa
Clara hit a free throw to move to
63-59. Then Leslie stole the ball
in Stanford's backcourt and hit a
layup —63-61. Enter Robinson,
well rested from his first half ex
ploits, to feed teammate Steve
McGee for the tying basket.
Then the Cards were unable to
get a basket in four trips down
court and it was 69-63 with 3:59
left. But maybe all the ear
shattering noise their own fans

were maing bothered the Bron
cos, as they tried to give the
game back to Stanford.
Santa Clara choke
Santa Clara missed free throw
after free throw while in a bonus
situation— five of six including
four of the firsj shots in one
plus-one situations and Stanford
moved to within two at 69-67.
But that was as close as Stanford
got. Freshman guard Paul
Giovacchini took the last Card
shot and it seemed to sum up the
whole game, rolling around the
rim and falling — the Broncos
had dedicated their basketball
showplace.
"This is the greatest win we've
had in this Pavilion," smiled
Williams after the game.
Dißiaso wasn't smiling over in
the visitors' dressing room.
"They came at us in the second
half and we didn't respond. We
couldn't get control of the tempo
of the game."
Stanford shot a meager 45.8
percent in the second half (11 of
24). But the real story lies in the
free throw column. Stanford was
awarded just six free
throws while the Broncos were
given 24.
Well, chalk this one up to in
experience, and bring on 12th
ranked USF and its seven-foot
freshman center Bill Cartwright
Friday evening in Maples.
Knowing Dißiaso, the Cards will
be ready.
Call it youth. Call it overconfi
dence. Call it a slippery ball . . .
Hell, take your pick. But it'll
still go down as coach Dick Di-
Biaso' first loss as Stanford bas
ketball mentor. The Cards
charitably handed Santa Clara a
70-67 win in the dedication
game of the Broncos' futuristic
$4.5 million Toso Pavilion
Monday night.
The Cards, who amazed Ma
ples Pavilion fans last week with
their aggressiveness, amazed
Santa Clara statisticians with2l
turnovers, 14 of which came in
the second half.
"We showed our youth to
night," said Dißiaso. "You don't
have turnovers when you're
playing as a team."
Early lead
Santa Clara got off to an early
lead, in a first half which saw the
advantage change hands five
times. But then guard Mike Bratz
showed that his last weekend
was no fluke as he began to hit
the 20-footers which dazed Ma
ples' crowd last weekend, and
the Cards moved to a 12-11 lead
after 6:42 of play. At that point,
Clara's 6-foot-5 guard Ves
ter Williams, whose 16 first-half
points kept the Broncos in the
ball game, moved Santa Clara to
a 20-14 lead.
But the Broncos hit as cold
spell, as Stanford ran off nine
straight points to gain the lead,
and hit another eight before
Santa Clara could score again.
The Cards, playing as a team,
•""la comfortable 43-34 lead, as
the Stanford Band returned
Santa Clara chants of "We are
SC," with "no you're not, you're
Santa Clara."
