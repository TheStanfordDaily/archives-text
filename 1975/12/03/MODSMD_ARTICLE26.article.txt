NEW YORK (AF) â€” Ohio State halfback Archie Griffin yes
terday became the first player ever to win the Heisman Trophy
twice. Griffin, the first 5000-yard career rusher in college foot
ball history, received 454 of 888 first-place votes to win the
college game's top individual award.
In a year when many observers saw California's 6-foot-3,
225-pound halfback Chuck Muncie as the outstanding player,
the balloting wasn't even close. Griffin, who stands 5-9 and
gained 1357 yards to Muncie's 1460, had 1800 points in the
balloting, over 1000 more than runner-up Muncie.
Griffin led in ballots collected from every section of the
country except the West Coast. Muncie captured 145 first
place votes and another Pacific Eight performer, national rush
ing leader Ricky Bell of USC, finished third with 70 first-place
votes.
Other placers were (4) Tony Dorsett, Pittsburgh; (5) Joe
Washington, Oklahoma; (6) Jimmy Dubose, Florida; (7) John
Sciarra, UCLA.
