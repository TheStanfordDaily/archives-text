House affirms NYC aid plan
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday approved Pres
ident Ford's $2.3 billion loan proposal to aid financially
stricken New York City and sent the measure to the Senate
where passage was expected despite a planned filibuster.
New York Mayor Abraham Beame said he expected
Senate approval within a week.
House passage was by a 213-203 vote.
The Ford plan, which will be offered as an amendment
to the $7 billion bill by Rep. William Stanton (R-Ohio),
would permit the federal government to make loans to the
city over the next three years.
Under the plan, the city would have to repay each loan

The city will have to pay an interest rate one percent
higher than the Treasury is paying for its own borrowings.
Unlike bills approved by both Senate and House bank
ing committees, the Ford measure would not apply to
other cities.
The bill faces a filibuster by Sen. James Allen (D-Ala.)
but backers in the Senate say they have the 60 votes neded
to stop the filibuster.
Ford meets with Chairman Mao
PEKING — President Ford said today his
hour-and-50-minute meeting with Chairman Mao Tse
tung produced "a significant conversation."
It was Ford's first public comment on yesterday's meet
ing, which was nearly twice as long as the 1972 talks
between Mao and then-President Richard Nixon.
Ford told Chinese officials and a small group of news
men: "It was a significant conversation. It covered a very
wide range of matters on the international scene as well as
our bilateral relations."
The meeting was held in the official residence of the
81-year-old founder of the People's Republic in Chung
nanhai Park, near the Forbidden City.
Mao will be 82 on Dec. 26 and reportedly has speech
difficulties, but he has seen a succession of state visitors in
recent months. Kissinger, who also had a long interview
with him in October, said his mind was clear and his grasp
of foreign affairs remarkable.
Moynihan criticizes Soviet actions
WASHINGTON — United Nations Ambassador Daniel
Moynihan said yesterday that Soviet military moves in
Angola show that the Russians intend to colonize Africa.
The ambassador also accused the Soviets of playing a

major part in the recent passage by the U.N. Assembly of a
resolution declaring Zionism, a movement for a national
Jewish homeland, to be a form of racism.
Moynihan said he believes the Soviets backed the
Zionism resolution to mask their own policies to Russian
Jews.
He said that in Africa the Soviets have brought Cuban
troops into Angola and have built military facilities on the
northeast coast.
Informant reveals FBI tasks
WASHINGTON — A top FBI official yesterday called
the campaign against the Ku Klux Klan the bureau's
"finest hour." But a one-time informant said agents rarely
acted to head off Klan attacks against blacks and civil
rights workers.
The informant, Gary Thomas Rowe Jr., who wore a hood
to mask his face, told the Senate Intelligence Committee
that FBI officials condoned his participation in acts of vio
lence while he was a Klan member from 1960 to 1965.
They also ordered him to gain information and sow dis
sension within the Klan by sleeping with the wives of as
many Klan members as possible, he said.

Senate approval within a week.
House passage was by a 213-203 vote.
The Ford plan, which will be offered as an amendment
to the $7 billion bill by Rep. William Stanton (R-Ohio),
would permit the federal government to make loans to the
city over the next three years.
Under the plan, the city would have to repay each loan
by the end of each fiscal year to qualify for another loan.
The city will have to pay an interest rate one percent
higher than the Treasury is paying for its own borrowings.
Unlike bills approved by both Senate and House bank
ing committees, the Ford measure would not apply to
other cities.
The bill faces a filibuster by Sen. James Allen (D-Ala.)
but backers in the Senate say they have the 60 votes neded
to stop the filibuster.
Ford meets with Chairman Mao
PEKING — President Ford said today his
hour-and-50-minute meeting with Chairman Mao Tse
tung produced "a significant conversation."
It was Ford's first public comment on yesterday's meet
ing, which was nearly twice as long as the 1972 talks
between Mao and then-President Richard Nixon.
Ford told Chinese officials and a small group of news
men: "It was a significant conversation. It covered a very
wide range of matters on the international scene as well as
our bilateral relations."
The meeting was held in the official residence of the
81-year-old founder of the People's Republic in Chung
nanhai Park, near the Forbidden City.
Mao will be 82 on Dec. 26 and reportedly has speech
difficulties, but he has seen a succession of state visitors in
recent months. Kissinger, who also had a long interview
with him in October, said his mind was clear and his grasp
of foreign affairs remarkable.

Jewish homeland, to be a form of racism.
Moynihan said he believes the Soviets backed the
Zionism resolution to mask their own policies to Russian
Jews.
He said that in Africa the Soviets have brought Cuban
troops into Angola and have built military facilities on the
northeast coast.
