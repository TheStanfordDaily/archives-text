# Linen strike continues; NLS considers rebate
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Suspension of National Linen
Service's campus operations because
of a strike will probably continue for at
least this week, according to Alex
McGregor, assistant manager of its San
Francisco plant.
A strike of truckdrivers, salesmen
and supervisors since Nov. 21 has pre
vented National from making its
weekly exchanges.
"Students should be able to get a
rebate for the weeks missed,"
McGregor said. He said management is
considering a plan by which students
"can just drop us a postcard" to claim
the refund.
McGregor added that students paid
by National to take care of distribution
within dorms "will be getting paid for
the weeks they miss."
Time cards
But Kim Hastings, a student emp
loye of the firm, said, "They haven't
been picking up our time cards." She
added that she had not been contacted
about being paid.
National's price to customers is set
until the end of this school year, but
McGregor said he expects increased

costs from settlement of the strike to
bring about "a small price increase
next year â€” a dollar or two, or maybe
just 75 cents."
Some dorms had enough extra clean
linen on hand before the strike to pro
vide limited exchange service last
week, but Hastings said the only way
students can get clean linen this week
"is to wash what they have."
Contract safe
Although McGregor expressed con
cern that continued price increases
would lead to National "pricing itself
out of the market," he said "there's no
chance" this one strike would cause
the University to drop its contract with
the company.
McGregor said he saw no end in
sight for the strike, and declined to
speculate on how long it would con
tinue. Only a few Bay Area plants are
involved, he noted.
"We offered the drivers a $50 a week
raise," McGregor explained, "and the
salesmen and supervisors a $75 a week
increase, but they turned us down." He
said he thought the disagreement was
primarily over seniority policy and a
grievance clause.
