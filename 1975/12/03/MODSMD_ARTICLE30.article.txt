# Voters to decide on mascot
## 
### JACK VAUGHN 
Students will choose a new mascot
and a committee to evaluate the Honor
Code in an ASSU special election
today and tomorrow.
Polls will be open from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. at the Post Office, Engineering
Corner and Physics Tank only.
Two proposals on the mascot will be
offered. One, a list of seven selections
by a committee designated by the
ASSU Senate, will ask students to
choose both a first and second choice.
A first choice will receive two points, a
second choice one.
The candidates will be Trees, Se
quoias, Spikes, Robber Barons, Huns,
Railroaders and Cardinals. The Indian
was excluded from consideration by
the senate.
Referendum on Indian
A referendum on the return of the
Indian mascot will also appear on the
ballot. The result of a petition by a stu
dent group headed by senior Jim
Simpson, the referendum will ask for a

yes or no decision on bringing back the
Indian.
The Stanford American Indian Or
ganization (SAIO) has been campaign
ing against the Indian's return, accord
ing to member Benjie Atencio. Atencio
said the group has held several
"teach-ins" in student residences and
has posted "seven or eight different
flyers giving different reasons" to op
pose the referendum.
"Red arm bands" will be worn by
referendum opponents. Atencio said.
Simpson said supporters of the In
dian have not done any organized
campaigning. "We feel that most peo
ple have made their minds on the

issue, and those who haven't won't be
voting," Simpson said.
'Its own merits'
"We'll let the issue rise or fall on its
own merits without spending any
money to promote it,"he added.
Eleven students are running for
three student positions on the Student
Conduct Legislative Council, which
will study and make recommenda
tions on the Honor Code.
Students running for the council are
Robert Bayless, Bruce Blakely, Donald
Burgess, Peter Cohen, Gregg De
nsmore, Dave Dick, Paul Helliker, Brad
Levin, John Motulsky, Dave Sharp and
Cathy Wittrock.
