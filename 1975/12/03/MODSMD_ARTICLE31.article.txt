## 
### 
A $4275 tuition for the 1976-77
academic year will be recommended
to the Board of Trustees at its meet
ing next week, according to Vice Pro
vost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti.
The recommended figure would be a
12.2 percent increase from this year's
tuition, and would break down into
$1425 per quarter.
At the October Board of Trustees
meeting, an estimated tuition of $4303
was announced.
"$4303 was an unrefined estimate.
We made analytical refinements and
$4275 seemed within the equilibrium
conditions and not troublesome
on other counts," explained Bacchetti.
Equilibrium refers to the long-term
financial planning system which the
University is currently using.
The $4275 figure will not become
official until the Board of Trustees ap
proves it.
