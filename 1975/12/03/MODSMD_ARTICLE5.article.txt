# Law library sets study policy
## 
### CHARLIE PARKER 
"Undergraduates are welcome to
use the Law Library occasionally,
when they need to use the materials.
However, we'd like to restrict its use as
a study hall," Law Prof. J. Myron
Jacobstein, head law librarian has told
the Daily.
"The Law Library is designed for
law students rather than under
graduates," he added.
Several undergraduates have re
cently expressed displeasure at being
turned away from the library. In a
November 20 letter to the Daily,
sophomore John Motulsky told of
being refused admittance at the door.
He said that that night "two-thirds of
the carrels were not being utilized"
and termed the policy "wasteful, un
necessary, (and) discriminatory."
Undergraduate Dave Wu told of
being turned away. "I was outraged. I
just sat and stared at the guy for half an
hour." He was eventually admitted.
Steve Fugaro, a junior living in

Serra, said, "A lot of people living in
Serra would like to use it" because the
law school is so close. "I don't under
stand the argument against under
graduates," he added.
Ways around it
Apparently, however, students have
found ways around the policy. One
junior gets in by saying she has to do a
paper for a law class. "I've never had
any trouble," she said, "1 always have
my stock excuse."
On Monday night, undergrads were
stopped at the door by a smiling assis
tant reference librarian, Joan Howland.
She asked students entering, "Excuse
me, are you a law student?" If they
were not, and stated that they did not
plan to use the legal materials, she told
them, "I'm sorry, we don't have
facilities for undergraduates to study
here. If you ever want to use our books,
please feel free to come."
Howland said, "We work on our PR
here. We try to be as nice about it as
possible."
Undergrads find the Law Library a
desirable place to study. It is virtually
silent in the carrel areas. Carpets sub
due footsteps. The carrels are large and
have high and deep walls.
Law students complained
For about three weeks under
graduates were permitted use of the
Law Library for studying. According
to Jacobstein, two problems de
veloped: the law students were finding
it hard to get places to work, and they
were complaining about the noise. The
restrictions came as a result.
Jacobstein stated that the library is
not like others on campus. "Most peo
ple do not understand the function of a
law library. Law students use the lib

rary in the same way that chemistry
students use a chemistry lab. The law
library is a laboratory for law stu
dents." Large numbers of people are
disruptive, he claimed.
Jacobstein suggested that the condi
tions in Meyer Undergraduate Library
be investigated to see why people are
trying to find other places to study.
He emphasized, "We are not trying
to be elitist. We want to encourage the
use of the library. We are just not
equipped for 5000 undergraduaes."

Ways around it
Apparently, however, students have
found ways around the policy. One
junior gets in by saying she has to do a
paper for a law class. "I've never had
any trouble," she said, "1 always have
my stock excuse."
On Monday night, undergrads were
stopped at the door by a smiling assis
tant reference librarian, Joan Howland.
She asked students entering, "Excuse
me, are you a law student?" If they
were not, and stated that they did not
plan to use the legal materials, she told
them, "I'm sorry, we don't have
facilities for undergraduates to study
here. If you ever want to use our books,
please feel free to come."
Howland said, "We work on our PR
here. We try to be as nice about it as
possible."
Undergrads find the Law Library a
desirable place to study. It is virtually
silent in the carrel areas. Carpets sub
due footsteps. The carrels are large and
have high and deep walls.
Law students complained
For about three weeks under
graduates were permitted use of the
Law Library for studying. According
to Jacobstein, two problems de
veloped: the law students were finding
it hard to get places to work, and they
were complaining about the noise. The
restrictions came as a result.
Jacobstein stated that the library is
not like others on campus. "Most peo
ple do not understand the function of a
law library. Law students use the lib

rary in the same way that chemistry
students use a chemistry lab. The law
library is a laboratory for law stu
dents." Large numbers of people are
disruptive, he claimed.
Jacobstein suggested that the condi
tions in Meyer Undergraduate Library
be investigated to see why people are
trying to find other places to study.
He emphasized, "We are not trying
to be elitist. We want to encourage the
use of the library. We are just not
equipped for 5000 undergraduaes."
"Undergraduates are welcome to
use the Law Library occasionally,
when they need to use the materials.
However, we'd like to restrict its use as
a study hall," Law Prof. J. Myron
Jacobstein, head law librarian has told
the Daily.
"The Law Library is designed for
law students rather than under
graduates," he added.
Several undergraduates have re
cently expressed displeasure at being
turned away from the library. In a
November 20 letter to the Daily,
sophomore John Motulsky told of
being refused admittance at the door.
He said that that night "two-thirds of
the carrels were not being utilized"
and termed the policy "wasteful, un
necessary, (and) discriminatory."
Undergraduate Dave Wu told of
being turned away. "I was outraged. I
just sat and stared at the guy for half an
hour." He was eventually admitted.
Steve Fugaro, a junior living in

Serra, said, "A lot of people living in
Serra would like to use it" because the
law school is so close. "I don't under
stand the argument against under
graduates," he added.
