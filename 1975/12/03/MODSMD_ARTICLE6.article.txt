# Israeli attack kills 75 people

### The Associated Press 
Israeli jets, dodging heat-seeking
missiles, attacked Palestinian refugee
camps and guerrilla bases yesterday in
northern and southern Lebanon.
Lebanese police officials reported 75
dead and 120 wounded.
The air strike was the heaviest by
Israel against Lebanon this year and
was in apparent reprisal for stepped
up Palestinian guerrilla raids on Israeli
border settlements.
The Israeli military command re
ported the Arabs retaliated by firing
rockets at four Israeli border settle
ments, injuring two men. Both were
villagers at Qiryat Shmonah and were
released after hospital treatment for
shrapnel wounds.
The Palestinian Command said
nearly half of the victims of the Israeli
air strikes were women and children.
The targets
Israel claimed the targets were ter
rorist bases, including the headquar
ters of the Syrian-backed Saiqa guer
rilla group. Witnesses reported, how
ever, that the bombs and rockets devas
tated civilian residential areas and one
refugee school as well as guerrilla
military installations.
Meanwhile in Jerusalem, Premier
Yitzhak Rabin and Israel was distres
sed by United States support for a U.N.
Security Council resolution to include
Palestinians in future peace efforts.
An Israeli military spokesman said
the raid underlined Tel Aviv's policy
of fighting Palstinian guerrillas "only
on the battlefield," and not politically
in the United Nations.
A Palestinian spokesman re
sponded, "This barbarous aggression
is not going to stop the march of the

Palestine revolution."
A government announcement
claimed Lebanese army anti-aircraft
guns unleashed a barrage which
"forced the enemy planes to stay at
extremely high altitudes and pre
vented them from zeroing in properly
to score hits."
But sources in the two northern
camps said offices of the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, Fatah
and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion were destroyed by rockets.
At the United Nations in New York,
Israel said it was ready to negotiate for
peace at any time but "only on the
basis of recognition of Israel's
sovereign rights." Ambassador Chaim
Herzog added, "We will not negotiate
our own suicide."
'Stream of hate'
Herzog claimed the PLO seeks to do
away with Israel. He said if the Arabs
are serious about peace negotiations,
"let them stop this horrible stream of
hate and invective that we hear day in
and day out in this assembly and let
them begin to behave like mature na
tions."
He spoke on the eve of a conference
called by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin two weeks after the U.N. General
Assembly condemned Zionism, the
ideology of Jewish statehood, as a form
of racism.
Jewish leaders from many countries
will gather in Jerusalem today to try
and forge a united front against the
onslaught by the Arabs and the Third
World.
Abut 170 representatives from North
and South America, Western Europe,
South Africa and Australia will attend
the two-day meeting.
