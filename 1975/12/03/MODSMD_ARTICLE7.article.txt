# Invited guest professor opts to teach in Germany
## 
### DANA CURRY 
Hermann Schwember, a prisoner of
the Chilean military junta who was in
vited last winter quarter to be a guest
professor here, has been released from
prison and is now teaching in Ger
many, according to Political Science
Prof. Richard Fagen.
Invited by the ASSU Guest Profes
sorship Board, Schwember, who holds
a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, had
been released and was "in the process
of considering Stanford's offer"when
he was re-arrested, Fagen said. After
his recent second release, he chose to
go to Germany instead of here for two
reasons, according to Fagen.
"Schwember was offered a longer
guarantee of work in Germany, and he
Was more comfortable there, being of

German extraction," Fagen said.
Suggestions for guest professors for
this spring quarter are now being
sought by members of the board.
Nearly $10,000 from last year's fee as
sessment are still available for the
post, according to senior Blythe Mick
elson, a committee member.
Program's origins
The guest professorship program
started about 10 years ago with the in
tent of bringing people to Stanford to
teach in areas students felt were
under-represented in the curriculum,
Mickelson said.
Residents of Columbae House
pushed a fee assessment in winter
1974 to bring South Vietnamese jour
nalist Nguyen Huu Thai to campus.
Thai was released from prison

shortly after the fee assessment was
approved, but he has not been allowed
to leave South Vietnam.
The board invited Schwember as an
alternative.
Choices
As for this year, Micihelson com
mented, "There is no mandate for a
political prisoner to be invited for
spring quarter." It could be a local per
son or a foreigner. We could go for one
person or have a few part-time
positions ..."
"Ideally, students, professors and
departments should come forward
with suggestions. Departments are
welcome to help fund the professor
ship," she added.
The Political Science Department,
which had planned to help sponsor
Schwember, has little money currently
available, Fagen said.
Only three of the five members of
this year's selection board have been
chosen, Mickelson noied. The other
two members are senior Andrea Halli
day and senior Gordon Wheat.
Board members
Two board members are supposed to
be selected by the ASSU Senate, and
one each is to be chosen by SWOPSI
(Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues), SCIRE (Student Center
for Innovation in Research and Educa
tion) and ARLO (Action Research
Liason Office). SCIRE and ARLO have
not yet selected their representatives

for this year's committee.
The committee is still functioning
without the additional members, Mic
kelson said. It has announced Dec. 8 as
the deadline for professorship sugges
tions "so we can send out letters over
Christmas," she explained.
The board will make recommenda
tions to the ASSU Senate concerning
the professorship for spring quarter. If
no one is attainable, the money will be
saved for a future quarter.
"If we don't get anyone for spring
quarter," said Mickelson, "my feeling
personally is that a new committee
should be chosen, composed of stu
dents who will be here next year and
will be able to start working right
away."
