# New faculty housing labeled 'congenial'
## 
### JOEY F. GEORGE 
For about six weeks, some 35
families have been living in the
Pearce Mitchell Houses, a group of
Campus Drive condominiums
commonly called the emeriti hous
ing.
Life there is characterized as
"very congenial" and "neighborly"
by Emeritus Education Prof. Paul
Hanna, chairman of the group that
planned the housing.
"We find it very delightful," said
Hanna.
Assoc. Registrar Robert Hough
ton, another resident, echoed
Hanna. He called the housing
"comfortable" and "a nice place to
live." "I think those who live here
like it," Houghton said.
Most residents moved from larger
single-family dwellings. Houghton
moved from a four-bedroom house.
"It's nice not having gardening and
the ongoing maintenance of a
house," he said.
Quality of life
The quality of life in the emeriti
housing, Hanna said, is much like it
was for residents before they en
tered the new complex. Houghton
added that the condominiums are
"like other campus housing."
Residence in the condominiums
is open only to faculty and the ad
ministrative staff. Admission is
handled through the housing office
in Encina Hall.
According to Hanna, "emeriti
housing" is a misnomer. He said as
many young or faculty live there as
do emeriti. It is a mixed commun
ity. with 20 condominiums re
served for junior faculty, he said.

Houghton said there is a room av
ailable in the complex for classes
for Pearce Mitchell residents. He
said classes could begin as early as
next quarter in "whatever (subjects)
we showed interest in and asked
for."
Recreation
Recreation plays an important
part in life in the complex. Resi
dents have at their access a pool,
hobby shop, photographic dark
room and a recreation hall for par

ties. According to Hanna, several
parties and barbecues have already
been held. Future social plans in
clude inviting groups of faculty to
visit the condominiums and a
gathering to "get acquainted with
the people across Mayfield."
"We have not been bothered by
riotous living on part of the student
group," said Hanna, and he expres
sed hope that his community has
not disturbed student life.

The complex was the subject of
heated debate when it was ap
proved two years ago. Many stu
dents objected to its placement on
the Row, and a student referendum
overwhelmingly opposed the
plans. Administrators overruled
the objections.
At present, only about half of the
condominiums are sold, but Hanna
said he expected them all to be fil
led by next summer.
