## Opinions editorial Bowl games 
### 
The Pacific Eight and Big Ten athletic conferences
this year for the first time are permitting football teams
other than the conference champions to appear in
post-season bowl games. While certainly a healthy
step, this year's bowl picture points up gross inequities
in the system.
Bad feelings left from the Big Game aside, it's
ridiculous that the California Golden Bears, with one
of the most powerful and exciting teams inthe country,
are not going to a bowl game.
UCLA earned the Rose Bowl berth fairly as confer
ence champion, but the other Pac-8 team heading for a
bowl finished no better than fifth, with a losing record
in conference play. That team, John McKay's USC Tro
jans, will put a four-game losing streak on the line in
the Liberty Bowl.
But the Bears, with the nation's leading offense, are
staying at home, despite being conference co
champions.
In order to avert future tragedies of this order, the
Pac-8 should adopt a rule similar to the Big Ten's. That
conference requires that the second place team accept
or reject a bowl bid before one can be offered to the
third place team, and so on. While this system is not
perfect, it would at least guarantee that the Pac-8 be
represented in bowls by its best teams.
