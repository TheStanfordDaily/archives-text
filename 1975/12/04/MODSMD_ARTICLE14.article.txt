# 'Swept Away' â€“ romantic study

### Ann Hoffman 
Italian Film Director Lina
Wertmuller, a former assistant to
Frederico Fellini. seems to hav.e
inherited his fascination for
isolating two diametrically op
posed personalities and depict
ing the chemical interaction
which ensues.
In her latest film, Swept A way
. . . by an unusual destiny in the
blue sea of August, Wertmuller
has created two characters who
are defined at first solely by their
opposing and stereotyped views
on politics and sex. But just as
Fellini did in his allegorical La
Strada, Wertmuller brilliantly
uses stereotypes for dramatic ef
fect, while allowing the charac
ters to achieve true individual
ity.
Rafaella, played by
Mariangela Melato, is a blond,
liberated, capitalist queen, tak

ing a pleasure cruise on the
Riveria. She passes the long
hours in the sun lampooning the
Communist Party to the amuse
ment of her friends and the pro
vocation of the ship's crew.
The object of her strongest in
vectives is the dark-haired,
mournful-eyed sailor Gennarino
(played by Giancarlo Giannini),
a dedicated communist and an
avowed male chauvinist.
Then, Wertmuller success
fully carries off an overworked
comic device. By virtue of their
mutual stubbornness, Rafaella
and Gennarino become lost at
sea in a small boat. They arrive
finally on a small, uninhabited
island where the social hierar
chies are at once inverted, and it
is Rafaella's turn to be subju
gated.
Wertmuller has already re
ceived criticism as a woman di
rector who creates a heroine so

willing to take the knocks and
bruises of sexism in its most
primitive form.
While Rafaella's submission
to her lover is undoubtedly too
simplisticat times, Wertmuller's
concern is not the issue of sex
ism, but with the idea of social
turntables and how quickly roles
can be reversed. Rafaella's exp
loitation of Gennarino at the
film's beginning is different
from his dominance on the is
land only in degree.
However, for all its satiric,
political intent, Swept Away is
tenaciously romantic. The pre
dominant image retained by the
viewer is not of Rafaella and
Gennarino resettled in their re
spective social niches on the
mainland, but as they were in the
film's most vivid scene, resting
in each other's arms, a combina
tion of light and dark against the
island sand.
