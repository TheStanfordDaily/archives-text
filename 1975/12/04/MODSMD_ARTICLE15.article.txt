# 'Ernest in Love' proves delightful
## 
### BOB Henry 
Trying to he red-hot and
playboy, or perhaps deadbeat
and magna cum laude
simultaneously? Then swoop
down upon Town in Los
Gatos and catch the California
Actors Theatre's production of
Ernest in Love.

The delightful musical, based
on Oscar Wilde's cavalcade of
wit and frivolity, The Impor
tance of Being Earnest, .shows
the difficulties of trying to be
two different people at the same
time.
The two leading characters,
lack Worthing (Carl Reggiardo)

and Algernon Moncrieff (Victor
Pappas), attempt to incorporate
both stable, stay-at-home as well
as dissipating-seducer types in
their personality.
Worthing behaves very prop
erly in the country, assumes tbe
identity of his fictitious brother
Ernest and plays wildly in the

city. Moncrieff alternates roles,
visiting his imaginary and
chronically ill friend, Bunburry,
in the country when he desires a
voluptuous wench or two.
Matters become complicated
when Moncrieff impersonates
Ernest just as Jack has had Ernest
die of a severe chill. The heroes
suffer a further setback when
their fiances declare that what
really assures their love is the
wonderful name of Ernest.
Ernest Worthing, now being
portrayed by two people and
loved by two beautiful women,
unfortunately does not exist.
Add a bitchy mother who refuses
to allow the wedding because of
undesirable lineage, and it takes
Wilde's miraculous ending to
ensure happiness.
Anne Croswell and Lee Pock
ers have added entertaining
lyrics and music to Wilde's

script, and actually enhance the
proceedings by giving the audi
ence moments of pleasant re
spite from the barrage of humor.
The "orchestra" consists of
only two pianos, but the small
theatre (capacity 300), the light
singing voices of the cast, the
humorous, clever lyrics, and the
crisp melodies make the
"piano-only" accompaniment
seem very appropriate.
Of the 13 songs, especially en
joyable is "A Handbag is Not a
Proper Mother," where Worth
ing tells his improbable life his
tory and his fiance's mother
claims his parentage is inade
quate for a son-in-law of hers.
Milton Lyons directs the
commendable cast well, with
only a few scenes lacking the
briskness and quick pacing the
show must have. Marcia
Frederick's appropriate cos
tumes add some spectacle to the
simple, yet quite enjoyable pro
duction, which will play
through Saturday.

"piano-only" accompaniment
seem very appropriate.
Of the 13 songs, especially en
joyable is "A Handbag is Not a
Proper Mother," where Worth
ing tells his improbable life his
tory and his fiance's mother
claims his parentage is inade
quate for a son-in-law of hers.
Milton Lyons directs the
commendable cast well, with
only a few scenes lacking the
briskness and quick pacing the
show must have. Marcia
Frederick's appropriate cos
tumes add some spectacle to the
simple, yet quite enjoyable pro
duction, which will play
through Saturday.

HI THERE — Peggy Schoditch plays Miss Prism and Sandy McCallum is Dr. Chasuble in the California
Actors Theatre production of "Ernest in Love," which piays through Saturday.
Trying to he red-hot and
playboy, or perhaps deadbeat
and magna cum laude
simultaneously? Then swoop
down upon Town in Los
Gatos and catch the California
Actors Theatre's production of
Ernest in Love.

The delightful musical, based
on Oscar Wilde's cavalcade of
wit and frivolity, The Impor
tance of Being Earnest, .shows
the difficulties of trying to be
two different people at the same
time.
The two leading characters,
lack Worthing (Carl Reggiardo)

and Algernon Moncrieff (Victor
Pappas), attempt to incorporate
both stable, stay-at-home as well
as dissipating-seducer types in
their personality.
Worthing behaves very prop
erly in the country, assumes tbe
identity of his fictitious brother
Ernest and plays wildly in the

city. Moncrieff alternates roles,
visiting his imaginary and
chronically ill friend, Bunburry,
in the country when he desires a
voluptuous wench or two.
Matters become complicated
when Moncrieff impersonates
Ernest just as Jack has had Ernest
die of a severe chill. The heroes
suffer a further setback when
their fiances declare that what
really assures their love is the
wonderful name of Ernest.
Ernest Worthing, now being
portrayed by two people and
loved by two beautiful women,
unfortunately does not exist.
Add a bitchy mother who refuses
to allow the wedding because of
undesirable lineage, and it takes
Wilde's miraculous ending to
ensure happiness.
Anne Croswell and Lee Pock
ers have added entertaining
lyrics and music to Wilde's

script, and actually enhance the
proceedings by giving the audi
ence moments of pleasant re
spite from the barrage of humor.
The "orchestra" consists of
only two pianos, but the small
theatre (capacity 300), the light
singing voices of the cast, the
humorous, clever lyrics, and the
crisp melodies make the
"piano-only" accompaniment
seem very appropriate.
Of the 13 songs, especially en
joyable is "A Handbag is Not a
Proper Mother," where Worth
ing tells his improbable life his
tory and his fiance's mother
claims his parentage is inade
quate for a son-in-law of hers.
