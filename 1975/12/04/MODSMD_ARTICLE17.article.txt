# Satiric anti-racism highlights Theroux's first try â€” '3 Wogs'
## 
### Dana Gioia 
"Wog" is an insulting British slang word for a
foreigner. Most often it is used to refer to the black
and oriental immigrants who came to England
from former colonies. In tone and connotation,
"wog" is not unlike the words "nigger" or"wop."
Alexander Theroux's Three Wogs consists of
three short novellas about poor foreigners in Eng
land. The stories are independent but themati
cally interlocked.
They begin among lower-class English but end
among the aristocracy, so that the book completes
a survey of contemporary English racism from the
open acrimony of the poor to the almost uncon
scious bigotry of the upper class.
Theroux's book deals with very serious moral
questions, but he delights as well as instructs his
reader. Three Wogs is no tract-novel. Like Dick
ons, Theroux proves that a writer need not act
somberly to be serious.
Darkly humorous
Three Wogs is an unabashedly comjc novel
whose dark humor attacks the smug English at
titude towards its non-Anglo-Saxon population.
Writing about England from the perspective of an
American, Theroux uncovers the petty provin
cialism underneath the rubble of an empire.
The three stories take place in three different
classes of Britons who interact with three differ
ent nationalities. In "Miss Proby Gets Hers"
Theroux creates a hilarious fantasy in which a
downtrodden Chinese grocer murders a low class
crone during a Fu Manchu movie. The storv un
folds as a superb parody of the old woman's racist
nightmare of the sinister oriental.
Who's civil?
In the second story, "Child Roland," a lower
middle class maintenance man meets an Indian
student in a railway terminal. As the Indian po

litely listens to the Englishman's vulgar and belli
gerent conversation, it becomes evident that
civilizing England might well become a black
man's burden.
The final story in the volume is certainly the
best, and it alone should establish Theroux as a
major new talent. "The Wife of God" concerns an
aristocratic Anglican clergyman who is in love
with his semi-literate black choirmaster. The Rev.
Which Therefore's repressed homosexual at
tachment finds expression in his attempt to dis
suade the singer from marrying a ballet dancer.
The stories have a major weakness. At times
Theroux's characters lose psychological credibil
ity. They become temporary vehicles for the
author's stylistic preoccupations.
Unreal humor
They do and say what Theroux wants them to
rather than such characters would conceivably
perform under the circumstances. These mo
ments usually make hilarious reading but they
mar the context of the story.
As a delightful bonus, the volume concludes
with a polemical essay entitled "Theroux Meta
phrastes." This ornately written attack on the
literary establishment exhibits an exuberance and
wit that is almost totally lacking in contemporary
literary criticism.
Three Wogs is probably one of the most impor
tant first novels by an American author in the last
five years. Most first books betray a beginning
author's tentative mastery of his own style.
But in his premier book, Theroux unveils an
unhesitating, fully-developed style of great dis
tinction. From the first to the last page the reader
knows he is in the hands of a careful craftsman.
Theroux is an author to watch.

Which Therefore's repressed homosexual at
tachment finds expression in his attempt to dis
suade the singer from marrying a ballet dancer.
The stories have a major weakness. At times
Theroux's characters lose psychological credibil
ity. They become temporary vehicles for the
author's stylistic preoccupations.
Unreal humor
They do and say what Theroux wants them to
rather than such characters would conceivably
perform under the circumstances. These mo
ments usually make hilarious reading but they
mar the context of the story.
As a delightful bonus, the volume concludes
with a polemical essay entitled "Theroux Meta
phrastes." This ornately written attack on the
literary establishment exhibits an exuberance and
wit that is almost totally lacking in contemporary
literary criticism.
Three Wogs is probably one of the most impor
tant first novels by an American author in the last
five years. Most first books betray a beginning
author's tentative mastery of his own style.
But in his premier book, Theroux unveils an
unhesitating, fully-developed style of great dis
tinction. From the first to the last page the reader
knows he is in the hands of a careful craftsman.
Theroux is an author to watch.
Three Wogs by Alexander Theroux; Godine
Press, $3.95.
"Wog" is an insulting British slang word for a
foreigner. Most often it is used to refer to the black
and oriental immigrants who came to England
from former colonies. In tone and connotation,
"wog" is not unlike the words "nigger" or"wop."
Alexander Theroux's Three Wogs consists of
three short novellas about poor foreigners in Eng
land. The stories are independent but themati
cally interlocked.
They begin among lower-class English but end
among the aristocracy, so that the book completes
a survey of contemporary English racism from the
open acrimony of the poor to the almost uncon
scious bigotry of the upper class.
Theroux's book deals with very serious moral
questions, but he delights as well as instructs his
reader. Three Wogs is no tract-novel. Like Dick
ons, Theroux proves that a writer need not act
somberly to be serious.
Darkly humorous
Three Wogs is an unabashedly comjc novel
whose dark humor attacks the smug English at
titude towards its non-Anglo-Saxon population.
Writing about England from the perspective of an
American, Theroux uncovers the petty provin
cialism underneath the rubble of an empire.
The three stories take place in three different
classes of Britons who interact with three differ
ent nationalities. In "Miss Proby Gets Hers"
Theroux creates a hilarious fantasy in which a
downtrodden Chinese grocer murders a low class
crone during a Fu Manchu movie. The storv un
folds as a superb parody of the old woman's racist
nightmare of the sinister oriental.
Who's civil?
In the second story, "Child Roland," a lower
middle class maintenance man meets an Indian
student in a railway terminal. As the Indian po

litely listens to the Englishman's vulgar and belli
gerent conversation, it becomes evident that
civilizing England might well become a black
man's burden.
The final story in the volume is certainly the
best, and it alone should establish Theroux as a
major new talent. "The Wife of God" concerns an
aristocratic Anglican clergyman who is in love
with his semi-literate black choirmaster. The Rev.
