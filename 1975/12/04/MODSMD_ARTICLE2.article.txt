The majestic bronze head of an ancient
African king, and enormous golden
angels, are two of many lures for art
tripping in San Francisco.
Within just a few downtown blocks, the
City's .creative milieu includes tap
dancing street jazz musicians; carolers in
satins and silks, sounding straight out of
Charles Dickens; a kilted bagpiper, and
corner flower vendors offering mistletoe
and roses.
"Flxotic and interesting art" is Charles
Cregory's emphasis at his new Callery in
Abercrombie & Fitch on Post Street. The
commemorative Renin bronze head in the
window announces the Gallery's location

on the first floor. The selection is diverse,
including museum quality pieces of Afri
can tribal art.
The most unusual works are a seated
figure and two bronze memorial heads of
Obas — elegant, intricate and rare exam
ples of lost-wax bronze casting from the
ancient cultures of Benin and Ife in
Nigeria.
A relief from an East Indian temple
celebrates sensuousness: its curving,
rounded interlocked figures are a tangible
introduction to another lifestyle. Two
graceful Bambara antelope headdresses
cry out to be worn and danced in; a Dogon
granary door presents the values of its


agricultural society. Carved Chinese
ivory netsuke — snuff bottles — fill a
glass case, each one a study in detail and
fantasy.
The potpourri of art works within the
Callery includes contemporary graphics
by artists like Picasso and Hen Shahn.
Fantastic and colorful angels float in
(lump's Christmas windows, glittering at
every passerby. The angels create a happy
magic, their golden figures extending the
entire length of each window with no vis
ible support. Their surfaces are complex,
treated in facets of bright solid colors.
The angels' faces are modern, but their
bodies glimmer like stained glass made
solid.
The parts of the angels' bodies seem to
be articulated, as if a hand could move
independently to strike its tambourine or
a wing could bend to guide the angel as it
swoops away.
Angels in the windows compete with
intriguing objects and experiences
everywhere—a comical mistletoe sale, a
crowd's enthusiasm watching a sax
ophonist tapdance to "Fat City" and
sidewalk drama when a tall turbaned
woman with bodyguards on either side
swept past leading a silver-gray Russian
wolfhound.
A ramble in the City can provide in
sights into art without the structure of a
museum. Art is accessible — a multi
dimensional celebration happening con
stantly.

The majestic bronze head of an ancient
African king, and enormous golden
angels, are two of many lures for art
tripping in San Francisco.
Within just a few downtown blocks, the
City's .creative milieu includes tap
dancing street jazz musicians; carolers in
satins and silks, sounding straight out of
Charles Dickens; a kilted bagpiper, and
corner flower vendors offering mistletoe
and roses.
"Flxotic and interesting art" is Charles
Cregory's emphasis at his new Callery in
Abercrombie & Fitch on Post Street. The
commemorative Renin bronze head in the
window announces the Gallery's location

on the first floor. The selection is diverse,
including museum quality pieces of Afri
can tribal art.
The most unusual works are a seated
figure and two bronze memorial heads of
Obas — elegant, intricate and rare exam
ples of lost-wax bronze casting from the
ancient cultures of Benin and Ife in
Nigeria.
A relief from an East Indian temple
celebrates sensuousness: its curving,
rounded interlocked figures are a tangible
introduction to another lifestyle. Two
graceful Bambara antelope headdresses
cry out to be worn and danced in; a Dogon
granary door presents the values of its


agricultural society. Carved Chinese
ivory netsuke — snuff bottles — fill a
glass case, each one a study in detail and
fantasy.
The potpourri of art works within the
Callery includes contemporary graphics
by artists like Picasso and Hen Shahn.
Fantastic and colorful angels float in
(lump's Christmas windows, glittering at
every passerby. The angels create a happy
magic, their golden figures extending the
entire length of each window with no vis
ible support. Their surfaces are complex,
treated in facets of bright solid colors.
The angels' faces are modern, but their
bodies glimmer like stained glass made
solid.
The parts of the angels' bodies seem to
be articulated, as if a hand could move

a wing could bend to guide the angel as it
