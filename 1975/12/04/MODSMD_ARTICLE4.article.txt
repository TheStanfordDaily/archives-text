# Life in the menagerie
## 
### J.A. Kodmur 
Steven Tight, a Stanford architecture
major, returned from the Florence cam
pus last year to spend the summer role
plaving the life of an artist.
His 38 ceramic animals, the result of a
nine-to-five, five-day-a-week schedule,
are clustered amusingly in the third
floor gallery at Livingston's in San
Francisco at Grant and Geary streets.
Tight's imaginatively crafted "Glaze
Menagerie" contains a penguin, a
hippo, a raccoon and a skunk as well as
mice, squirrels, frogs and fish. All of the
animals are carefully, realistically
sculptured and the variations in glazes
and surface textures are interesting.
The jagged edges of a bright blue-eyed
cat contrast with the sleek mounds of a
small coppery squirrel, while a green
hippo waits open-mouthed, its sharp
teeth adding another texture.
Three dignified rabbits dominate the
space. Kach is tall and real, their sense of
coloring and weight very natural and
appealing. One passerby petted the
gleaming smooth surface of a big
creamy white rabbit with a comically
bent ear and smiled as she whispered,
"It's alive!"
The glaze on a raccoon is absorbing in

an abstract sense. Tight developed a
painter's quality by his use of direc
tional striping, where gradations in
color follow those of shape. The
raccoon's back is a smooth mass of
browns and blacks and grays. An
angry-eyebrowed owl peers out over
two glossy creamy ducks, which double
as book-ends.
All of the animals are appealing,
without any awkwardness in execution.
Tight's background includes sculp
ture classes at the De Young Museum's
Summer Art School and at Stanford, as
well as seven months in Europe where
museum-going was inherent to his
traveling.
Tight sees himself as a craftsman, hav
ing created decorative pieces to be en
joyed which made his summer profita
ble as well. The animals range from $10
to $50, each one several days in the mak
ing.
Tight is a Pottery Associate at
Stanford's Wilbur Hall. He is enthusias
tic about ceramics, describing it as an
expressive form of art that depends on
malleable shapes, easily altered with re
sults immediately apparent.
