# ACT's 'Gorgeous' fantasy
## 
### Janice Ross 
General Gorgeous, Michael McClure's
two-act, cartoon drama, had its world
premiere at American Conservatory
Theatre in San Francisco, amid an audi
ence of critics, devotees and thrill
seekers.
The critics were there by necessity, the
devotees out of habit, and the thrill
seekers in the hope that McClure's newest
creation would live up to his past reputa
tion for kinky and daring theatre.
General Gorgeous is, in McClure's own
words, "an investigation of the probable
homelife of a comic book hero." The hero
is General Gorgeous, a milk-drinking,
Nordic good-guy, who is threatened by
the evil Blue Mutant and his two sexy
Pink Mutation assistants.
Gorgeous' home life includes a tennis
playing wife eager for babies, a fat Panda
bear maid, and two formerly heroic par
ents who now reside in a Miami retire
ment home.
Genius or folly
From a critical standpoint the casting ot
Nicholas Cortland as General Gorgeous is
either sheer genius or. more likely, sheer
folly. Cortland is a pretty-boy actor who
delivers every line with a flat Brooklyn
whine, giving an added "all-American
shallowness to the character of Gorgeous.
The rest of the cast, including Barbara
Dirickson as Pam. the Panda maid, and
Joy Carlin. as Mouse Woman, Gorgeous'
mother, were exceptional, lending an
added depth to McClure's otherwise in
tentionally two-dimensional characters.
General Gorgeous is. by McClure's own
admission, not an exceptionally pro
found or message laden play. Instead it is
like McClure's earlier works, Gorf and
Spider Rabbit — an alchemical fantasy,
blending imaginary and animal charac
ters in a science-fit tion world.
Fantastic world
In person, dressed in cowboy boots and
a three-piece suit, McClure is a very soft
spoken man who is prone to making
statements like. "When 1 walk down the
street I ( an see m\ self as an animal being
.... We really are all just bunny rabbits
. . . and tree shrews.
In addition to McClure's fertile imagi
nation and preoccupation with absurdity.

there is another key ingredient that sets
McClure's dramas apart — the costumes.
Robert Morgan, one of ACT's resident
costume designers, almost single
handedly invokes the McClure ambience
with his brilliantly effective costumes.
These costumes include the pink
mutation's bodysuits with wings, and
Gorgeous' magnificent silver cape which
can instantly metamorphose into a chair.
P,dward Hasting's direction is un
iformly good, except for the beginning of
the second act, when he allows lengthy
passages of McClure's comic hook
rhetoric to retard the action and conse
quently our interest.
General Gorgeous continues in reper
tory through January, at the Geary
Theatre.
