Stanford's Delta Tau Delta fraternity may have its own recent
history of problems, but compared to its USC counterpart, the
Stanford chapter is in fine shape.
According to an article in the Nov. 19 Daily Trojan, the Southern
California Delt chapter has been placed on probation for "alcohol
policy violation."
"Complaints of excessive noise and unsanctioned serving of
alcoholic beverages at a recent fraternity (party) led to the social
and disciplinary probation," the Daily Trojan said.
USC's official alcohol policy requires university authorization
for temporary possession of alcohol, and specifies that minors may
not be served alcohol at authorized parties. Additionally, the arti
cle explained, nonalcoholic beverages must also be available at
parties where liquor isbeing served, and the party must beclosed to
all nonmembers and uninvited guests.
The terms of the university ruling require the fraternity to remain
quiet after 11 p.m. on weekdays, and after midnight on Fridays and
Saturdays.
USC Delt President Rick Callahan termed the ruling "fair," but
noted that the fraternity's intentions were "totally honorable."
The Delt house is located on "Greek Row" next to the campus,
and, according to Callahan, the fraternity was trying to help Row
residents. "We really just wanted to perform a nonprofit service,"
Callahan told the Daily Trojan. "Rather than have people drive
around town with the possibility of them driving home after
they've been drinking, we thought it would be a good idea to keep
them on the Row."
The Stanford Delta Tau Delta chapter just came off of its own
probation this quarter, after a orffe-year suspension from campus
followed by a one-year probationary period for general rowdiness.
Stanford Delt President Art Estrada said that while he feels sorry
for his USC brothers, the two chapters are not very close. "We know
who they are and we're cordial to them, but we just don't interact,"
he said.
