# Voters axe Indian mascot; Robber Barons selected
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Students resoundingly defeated the
Stanford Indian as a school mascot in
the special referendum held yesterday
and Wednesday.
Of the 2770 students voting, pre
liminary results show only 855 (30.87
percent) supported the Indian, while
1915 (69.13 percent) were opposed.
As a replacement, the name Robber
Barons received the most first and sec
ond place votes (1664), followed
closely bv Sequoias (1598) and Trees
(1530).
The present symbol, Cardinals,
came in fourth (1309), while Railroad
ers, Spikes and Huns all finished well
below the top four choices.
Votes tentative
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Mike Murray indicated that the vote
totals were only tentative, pending
ASSU Senate approval. The Senate
will probably consider the matter next

vwek.
jThe referendum is not binding on
rife Athletic Department, and the Uni
versity has rejected the name Robber
narons once already, three years ago as
a substitute for Indians. Adminis
trators viewed the name Robber Ba
rons dimly, regarding it as slander
against railroad tycoon Leland Stan
ford, the University's founder.
Figures released early last night er
roneously show Sequoias as the new
mascot choice, with Robber Barons
second. However, Murray called the
Daily later and amended the prelimi
nary totals.
Murray explained that he held one
suspicious tally sheet aside when re
leasing the early totals. The sheet
turned out to be valid, and the results
changed.
Administration and Native
American spokesmen were pleased
with the vote on the Indian question.

but the Robber Baron choice drew fire
from several circles.
"I'm really encouraged," President
Richard Lyman said of the Indian vote.
"The results show a student awareness
of what the issues really were."
"I'm glad people were sensitive
enough to understand how we felt
about it," said Benjamin Atencio, rep
resentative of the campus Inter Tribal
Council and the Stanford American
Indian organization (SAIO).
"I'm just glad it's all over with,"
Atencio added. "1 hope it won't come
up again."
Controversy over?
But supporters of the Indian mascot,
including a representative from the
alumni group selling Indian decals,
indicated last night that the Stanford
Indian is far from dead.
Senior Jim Simpson, head of the
group that petitioned for the Indian
referendum, said the Indian revival
movement would suffer a "setback"
among students, but it might continue.
Alumnus Lowell Berry, spokesman
for the conservative New Founders'
League, blamed the Indian referendum
defeat on students' mistaken impres
sions from "hearing only one side of
the story. There was a lot of pressure
from the Administration.
"I don't think there will be a lot done
for another eight or nine months," he
added, "but the Indian will be back
next football season."
The Cardinal color may also be back
next football season, as mascot, de
spite the student preference.
University displeasure
"I guess I would be surprised if there
were no University displeasure with
Robber Barons," said Robert Rosenz
weig, the University's vice president
for public affairs.
"I think it's kind of silly, and I can't

see many people taking it seriously,"
Rosenzweig remarked.
Athletic Director joe Ruetz said ath
letic teams would shun mascots, re
gardless of the one chosen, and rely
more heavily on the name "Stanford."
"We'll just continue to use 'Stan
ford'anil not get involved in symbols,"
he said last night. "1 don't particularly
care for it (Robber Barons)."
Initial reaction to Robber Barons
from the Stanford band was also nega
tive. "It's really terrible," said LSJUMB
manager Kent Blumberg. who pre
dicted the nickname would be "fairly
unpopular" with others in the band.
The band selected Trees as the mas
cot at the Big Game last month, and
Blumberg said several bandsmen were
"sentimentally attached" to that name.
On the final ballot issue, Cathy VVit
trock, Gregg Densmore and Bruce
Blakely won seats on the Student Con
duct Legislative Council, which will
studv the Honor Code.

but the Robber Baron choice drew fire
from several circles.
"I'm really encouraged," President
Richard Lyman said of the Indian vote.
"The results show a student awareness
of what the issues really were."
"I'm glad people were sensitive
enough to understand how we felt
about it," said Benjamin Atencio, rep
resentative of the campus Inter Tribal
Council and the Stanford American
Indian organization (SAIO).
"I'm just glad it's all over with,"
Atencio added. "1 hope it won't come
up again."
Controversy over?
But supporters of the Indian mascot,
including a representative from the
alumni group selling Indian decals,
indicated last night that the Stanford
Indian is far from dead.
Senior Jim Simpson, head of the
group that petitioned for the Indian
referendum, said the Indian revival
movement would suffer a "setback"
among students, but it might continue.
Alumnus Lowell Berry, spokesman
for the conservative New Founders'
League, blamed the Indian referendum
defeat on students' mistaken impres
sions from "hearing only one side of
the story. There was a lot of pressure
from the Administration.
"I don't think there will be a lot done
for another eight or nine months," he
added, "but the Indian will be back
next football season."
The Cardinal color may also be back
next football season, as mascot, de
spite the student preference.
University displeasure
"I guess I would be surprised if there
were no University displeasure with
Robber Barons," said Robert Rosenz
weig, the University's vice president
for public affairs.
"I think it's kind of silly, and I can't

see many people taking it seriously,"
Rosenzweig remarked.
Athletic Director joe Ruetz said ath
letic teams would shun mascots, re
gardless of the one chosen, and rely
more heavily on the name "Stanford."
"We'll just continue to use 'Stan
ford'anil not get involved in symbols,"
he said last night. "1 don't particularly
care for it (Robber Barons)."
Initial reaction to Robber Barons
from the Stanford band was also nega
tive. "It's really terrible," said LSJUMB
manager Kent Blumberg. who pre
dicted the nickname would be "fairly
unpopular" with others in the band.
The band selected Trees as the mas
cot at the Big Game last month, and
Blumberg said several bandsmen were
"sentimentally attached" to that name.
On the final ballot issue, Cathy VVit
trock, Gregg Densmore and Bruce
Blakely won seats on the Student Con
duct Legislative Council, which will
studv the Honor Code.

Students resoundingly defeated the
Stanford Indian as a school mascot in
the special referendum held yesterday
and Wednesday.
Of the 2770 students voting, pre
liminary results show only 855 (30.87
percent) supported the Indian, while
1915 (69.13 percent) were opposed.
As a replacement, the name Robber
Barons received the most first and sec
ond place votes (1664), followed
closely bv Sequoias (1598) and Trees
(1530).
The present symbol, Cardinals,
came in fourth (1309), while Railroad
ers, Spikes and Huns all finished well
below the top four choices.
