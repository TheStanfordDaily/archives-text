# Remember Ford's role in Watergate
## 
### 
Recent revelations about FBI harassment
plots and CIA assassination plots have ap
parently driven from the American con
sciousness the conspiracy that gave rise to
all subsequent exposures — Watergate. This
conclusion is borne out by three facts.
First, the names of Rep. Charles Wiggins
(D-Cal.) and U.S. Solicitor Gen. Robert Bork
were submitted in all seriousness to the
American Bar Association as poten
tial Supreme Court nominees. When the list
of names was leaked to the press, there was
barely a gasp at the news that Wiggins and
Bork were on it.
Does no one remember Wiggins? He was
the chief defender of Richard Nixon before
the House Judiciary Committee.
"I've read all the evidence, and there's not
one shred of proof that links Watergate to
Richard Nixon . . . We're going to win this
thing," he proclaimed proudly.
Bork's actions
And Bork? He was the man who fired
Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox at the
whim of a terrified Nixon and thus became a
cog in the coverup.
His decision about the right course of ac
tion to follow contrasts sharply with that of
Nixon cabinet members Elliot Richardson
and William Ruckelshaus, both of whom
resigned rather than carry out the firing.
Second, Richard Nixon's repeated ex
pressions of his desire to become a roving
goodwill ambassador for America or an
elder statesman and spokesman for the GOP
elicit barely a scream, groan or even a
chuckle.
People forget that for months his public
ity men were putting out the story that he
was gravely ill and could not be moved.
This immobility lasted just long enough for
him to escape testifying under oath and
being cross-examined at the trial of his top
co-conspirators in December 1974.
Travel urge
Now that the heat has blown over, he is
positively bursting with desire to travel. Yet

no outrage is being expressed at his surpris
ing growth of wanderlust.
But the third and most persuasive piece of
evidence that the public has repressed the
events of June 1972 to January 1975 is sim
ply the extraordinary fact that Gerald Ford
is a viable candidate for President on the eve
of the primaries.
The fact that Ford was thought by a cor
rupt Nixon to be a worthy successor to the

felonious law and order advocate Spiro
Agnew is perhaps not in itself a crippling
indictment of Ford. Richardson was also a
Nixon appointee, and a few other persons of
quality managed to slip into the Nixon gov
ernment.
What ought, however, to irreparably
damage Ford's viability as a candidate is his
action of Sunday, Sept. 8,1974. On that day,
without waiting for a court to determine
Nixon's guilt, Ford issued a "full, free, and
absolute pardon to Richard Nixon for all
offenses against the United States which he
has committed or may have committed."
Two results
The pardon had two important results
(aside from letting Nixon retire to San
Clemente untouched and untouchable by
the law).
First, it meant that the Judiciary
Committee's impeachment votes stand as
the only verdict on Nixon's guilt by any
constituted institutional authority.
Nixon's resignation forestalled a Senate
vote on conviction, and Ford's pardon fores
talled a judicial determination of guilt. In

deed, Special Pro§ecutor Leon Jaworski re
fused months later to release an explicit
prosecutorial judgement on Nixon's guilt;
the pardon, Jaworski said, had made the
release of such a judgement legally impro
per.
Second, because it forever barred any
formal verdict, it made conceivable — and
even likely — the possibility that revisionist
historians of future years could picture
Nixon as a kind of Dreyfus or Andrew John
son: a man wronged by an intolerant soci
ety.
Furthermore, it can be expected that even
before the history books are written, mill
ions of misguided Americans will labor
under the delusion apparently shared by
Nixon himself: that he resigned because he
had lost too much support to govern.
Reversed his promise
Almost as reprehensible as the pardon it
self is the fact that in issuing it Ford went
back on his word. On Nov. 5, 1973, in con
firmation hearings before the Senate Rules
Committee, Ford was asked about a possible
pardon for the man who had picked him.
"I do not think the public would stand for
it,"he said to the American people. On Aug.
28, 1974, in his first news conference as
President, Ford said: "It would be unwise
and untimely even to comment on a poten
tial pardon until formal legal charges have
been lodged."
To be sure, these do not represent ironc
lad promises not to pardon Nixon, but they
were obviously calculated to reassure his
interrogators along those lines.
Democratic presidential candidates
would be doing a public service if at every
campaign stop they reminded the American
people about the Saturday Night Massacre,
the impeachment inquiry, Nixon's conve
nient illness, and most of all, the pardon.
But don't hold your breath.

ity men were putting out the story that he
was gravely ill and could not be moved.
This immobility lasted just long enough for
him to escape testifying under oath and
being cross-examined at the trial of his top
co-conspirators in December 1974.
Travel urge
Now that the heat has blown over, he is
positively bursting with desire to travel. Yet

no outrage is being expressed at his surpris
ing growth of wanderlust.
But the third and most persuasive piece of
evidence that the public has repressed the
events of June 1972 to January 1975 is sim
ply the extraordinary fact that Gerald Ford
is a viable candidate for President on the eve
of the primaries.
The fact that Ford was thought by a cor
rupt Nixon to be a worthy successor to the

felonious law and order advocate Spiro
Agnew is perhaps not in itself a crippling
indictment of Ford. Richardson was also a
Nixon appointee, and a few other persons of
quality managed to slip into the Nixon gov
ernment.
What ought, however, to irreparably
damage Ford's viability as a candidate is his
action of Sunday, Sept. 8,1974. On that day,
without waiting for a court to determine
Nixon's guilt, Ford issued a "full, free, and
absolute pardon to Richard Nixon for all
offenses against the United States which he
has committed or may have committed."
Two results
The pardon had two important results
(aside from letting Nixon retire to San
Clemente untouched and untouchable by
the law).
First, it meant that the Judiciary
Committee's impeachment votes stand as
the only verdict on Nixon's guilt by any
constituted institutional authority.
Nixon's resignation forestalled a Senate
vote on conviction, and Ford's pardon fores
talled a judicial determination of guilt. In

deed, Special Pro§ecutor Leon Jaworski re
fused months later to release an explicit
prosecutorial judgement on Nixon's guilt;
the pardon, Jaworski said, had made the
release of such a judgement legally impro
per.
Second, because it forever barred any
formal verdict, it made conceivable — and
even likely — the possibility that revisionist
historians of future years could picture
Nixon as a kind of Dreyfus or Andrew John
son: a man wronged by an intolerant soci
ety.
Furthermore, it can be expected that even
before the history books are written, mill
ions of misguided Americans will labor
under the delusion apparently shared by
Nixon himself: that he resigned because he
had lost too much support to govern.
Reversed his promise
Almost as reprehensible as the pardon it
self is the fact that in issuing it Ford went
back on his word. On Nov. 5, 1973, in con
firmation hearings before the Senate Rules
Committee, Ford was asked about a possible
pardon for the man who had picked him.
"I do not think the public would stand for
it,"he said to the American people. On Aug.
28, 1974, in his first news conference as
President, Ford said: "It would be unwise
and untimely even to comment on a poten
tial pardon until formal legal charges have
been lodged."
To be sure, these do not represent ironc
lad promises not to pardon Nixon, but they
were obviously calculated to reassure his
interrogators along those lines.
Democratic presidential candidates
would be doing a public service if at every
campaign stop they reminded the American
people about the Saturday Night Massacre,
the impeachment inquiry, Nixon's conve
nient illness, and most of all, the pardon.
But don't hold your breath.

Recent revelations about FBI harassment
plots and CIA assassination plots have ap
parently driven from the American con
sciousness the conspiracy that gave rise to
all subsequent exposures — Watergate. This
conclusion is borne out by three facts.
First, the names of Rep. Charles Wiggins
(D-Cal.) and U.S. Solicitor Gen. Robert Bork
were submitted in all seriousness to the
American Bar Association as poten
tial Supreme Court nominees. When the list
of names was leaked to the press, there was
barely a gasp at the news that Wiggins and
Bork were on it.
Does no one remember Wiggins? He was
the chief defender of Richard Nixon before
the House Judiciary Committee.
"I've read all the evidence, and there's not
one shred of proof that links Watergate to
Richard Nixon . . . We're going to win this
thing," he proclaimed proudly.
Bork's actions
And Bork? He was the man who fired
Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox at the
whim of a terrified Nixon and thus became a
cog in the coverup.
His decision about the right course of ac
tion to follow contrasts sharply with that of
Nixon cabinet members Elliot Richardson
and William Ruckelshaus, both of whom
resigned rather than carry out the firing.
Second, Richard Nixon's repeated ex
pressions of his desire to become a roving
goodwill ambassador for America or an
elder statesman and spokesman for the GOP
elicit barely a scream, groan or even a
chuckle.
People forget that for months his public
ity men were putting out the story that he
was gravely ill and could not be moved.

the law).
First, it meant that the Judiciary
Committee's impeachment votes stand as
the only verdict on Nixon's guilt by any
constituted institutional authority.
Nixon's resignation forestalled a Senate
vote on conviction, and Ford's pardon fores
talled a judicial determination of guilt. In

deed, Special Pro§ecutor Leon Jaworski re
fused months later to release an explicit
prosecutorial judgement on Nixon's guilt;
the pardon, Jaworski said, had made the
release of such a judgement legally impro
per.
Second, because it forever barred any
formal verdict, it made conceivable — and
even likely — the possibility that revisionist
historians of future years could picture
Nixon as a kind of Dreyfus or Andrew John
son: a man wronged by an intolerant soci
ety.
Furthermore, it can be expected that even
before the history books are written, mill
ions of misguided Americans will labor
under the delusion apparently shared by
Nixon himself: that he resigned because he
had lost too much support to govern.
Reversed his promise
Almost as reprehensible as the pardon it
self is the fact that in issuing it Ford went
back on his word. On Nov. 5, 1973, in con
firmation hearings before the Senate Rules
Committee, Ford was asked about a possible
pardon for the man who had picked him.
"I do not think the public would stand for
it,"he said to the American people. On Aug.
28, 1974, in his first news conference as
President, Ford said: "It would be unwise
and untimely even to comment on a poten
tial pardon until formal legal charges have
been lodged."
To be sure, these do not represent ironc
lad promises not to pardon Nixon, but they
were obviously calculated to reassure his
interrogators along those lines.
Democratic presidential candidates
would be doing a public service if at every
campaign stop they reminded the American
people about the Saturday Night Massacre,
the impeachment inquiry, Nixon's conve
nient illness, and most of all, the pardon.
But don't hold your breath.

Recent revelations about FBI harassment
plots and CIA assassination plots have ap
parently driven from the American con
sciousness the conspiracy that gave rise to
all subsequent exposures — Watergate. This
conclusion is borne out by three facts.
First, the names of Rep. Charles Wiggins
(D-Cal.) and U.S. Solicitor Gen. Robert Bork
were submitted in all seriousness to the
American Bar Association as poten
tial Supreme Court nominees. When the list
of names was leaked to the press, there was
barely a gasp at the news that Wiggins and
Bork were on it.
Does no one remember Wiggins? He was
the chief defender of Richard Nixon before
the House Judiciary Committee.
"I've read all the evidence, and there's not
one shred of proof that links Watergate to
Richard Nixon . . . We're going to win this
thing," he proclaimed proudly.
Bork's actions
And Bork? He was the man who fired
Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox at the
whim of a terrified Nixon and thus became a
cog in the coverup.
His decision about the right course of ac
tion to follow contrasts sharply with that of
Nixon cabinet members Elliot Richardson
and William Ruckelshaus, both of whom
resigned rather than carry out the firing.
Second, Richard Nixon's repeated ex
pressions of his desire to become a roving
goodwill ambassador for America or an
elder statesman and spokesman for the GOP
elicit barely a scream, groan or even a
chuckle.
People forget that for months his public
ity men were putting out the story that he
was gravely ill and could not be moved.
This immobility lasted just long enough for
him to escape testifying under oath and
being cross-examined at the trial of his top
co-conspirators in December 1974.
Travel urge
Now that the heat has blown over, he is
positively bursting with desire to travel. Yet

no outrage is being expressed at his surpris
ing growth of wanderlust.
But the third and most persuasive piece of
evidence that the public has repressed the
events of June 1972 to January 1975 is sim
ply the extraordinary fact that Gerald Ford
is a viable candidate for President on the eve
of the primaries.
The fact that Ford was thought by a cor
rupt Nixon to be a worthy successor to the

felonious law and order advocate Spiro
Agnew is perhaps not in itself a crippling
indictment of Ford. Richardson was also a
Nixon appointee, and a few other persons of
quality managed to slip into the Nixon gov
ernment.
What ought, however, to irreparably
damage Ford's viability as a candidate is his
action of Sunday, Sept. 8,1974. On that day,
without waiting for a court to determine
Nixon's guilt, Ford issued a "full, free, and
absolute pardon to Richard Nixon for all
offenses against the United States which he
has committed or may have committed."
Two results
The pardon had two important results
(aside from letting Nixon retire to San
Clemente untouched and untouchable by
the law).
First, it meant that the Judiciary
Committee's impeachment votes stand as
the only verdict on Nixon's guilt by any
constituted institutional authority.
Nixon's resignation forestalled a Senate
vote on conviction, and Ford's pardon fores
talled a judicial determination of guilt. In

deed, Special Pro§ecutor Leon Jaworski re
fused months later to release an explicit
prosecutorial judgement on Nixon's guilt;

formal verdict, it made conceivable — and
even likely — the possibility that revisionist
historians of future years could picture
Nixon as a kind of Dreyfus or Andrew John
son: a man wronged by an intolerant soci
ety.

before the history books are written, mill
ions of misguided Americans will labor
under the delusion apparently shared by

had lost too much support to govern.
