Library policy

Editor:
The Law School library's pol
icy of admitting only under
graduates who are doing legal
research is ridiculous; the jus
tification it has given for this
policy is completely specious.
The library first claims that
due to limited space, it must
admit only students doing legal (
work. However, all evidence
points to the fact that the library
.has yet to be totally full.
It is understandable that dur
ing certain times of the year (e.g.
law school finals), the library
might be filled to capacity. The
library would be justified in ad
mitting only law students dur
ing these times.
Yet, why can't it remain open
to all during the less busy times
of the year (by far the usual con-|
ditionj?
Secondly, the library seems to
be worrying that it might be
come another Meyer, with a few
students bothering other
studiers. It seems unlikely,
though, that any but serious
studiers will frequent the law
library.
And, if students do become
noisy, isn't it up to the librarians
to silence them?
It only is just that a facility,
open to any student on campus
should be open to all students,
whether they be medical stu
dents, law students or under
graduates. The only exception to
this rule should be for reasons of
space — a consideration valid
here only at special times.

Charles Engles' complaint
(Daily. Dec. 3) concerning I.ori
Matsukawa's omission of
Ronald Blankenhorn from her
martial arts feature is invalid.
While it is completely true
that Ronald Blankenhorn's
self-defense courses are innova
tive and popular, one must un
derstand that they represent a
synthesis of only the most basic
techniques of several of the mar
tial arts and therefore cannot be
considered as instruction in a
true martial arts style.
1 have worked with Blank
enhorn and feel that he is fulfil
ling a very real and worthwhile
need in the Stanford commun
ity. However, it is worth say
ing that terming him a "master"
in any martial art is a grave in
sult to the beautiful and precious
heritages that these systems rep
resent.
Blankenhorn suggests a sad
American stereotype whoclaims
mastery in several martial arts.
While this may impress the
layman, a more serious student
will realize that such a thing
does not exist.
Indeed, legitimate masters of
only a single martial arts style
are exceedingly rare, and more
importantly, all of these are of
Oriental descent. There exists
not one non-Oriental martial arts
master.
While this situation may very
well change in a decade or so, it
is most assuredly so now.
These generalists who claim
diverse "masteries," along with
other equally bogus persons who
claim very high ranks in the mar
tial arts but who possess ridicul
ously rudimentary skills, are
precisely the perpetrators of the
rampant "bastardization" we are
witnessing daily here in the Un
ited States and all over the world
of the true martial arts forms.
The layman must exercise a
very high degree of selectivity
when judging these matters.

heritages that these systems rep

Blankenhorn suggests a sad
American stereotype whoclaims
mastery in several martial arts.
While this may impress the
layman, a more serious student
will realize that such a thing
does not exist.
Indeed, legitimate masters of
only a single martial arts style
are exceedingly rare, and more
importantly, all of these are of
Oriental descent. There exists
not one non-Oriental martial arts
master.
While this situation may very
well change in a decade or so, it
is most assuredly so now.
These generalists who claim
diverse "masteries," along with
other equally bogus persons who
claim very high ranks in the mar
tial arts but who possess ridicul
ously rudimentary skills, are
precisely the perpetrators of the
rampant "bastardization" we are
witnessing daily here in the Un
ited States and all over the world
of the true martial arts forms.
The layman must exercise a
very high degree of selectivity
when judging these matters.

Editor:
The Law School library's pol
icy of admitting only under
graduates who are doing legal
research is ridiculous; the jus
tification it has given for this
policy is completely specious.
The library first claims that
due to limited space, it must
admit only students doing legal (
work. However, all evidence
points to the fact that the library
.has yet to be totally full.
It is understandable that dur
ing certain times of the year (e.g.
law school finals), the library
might be filled to capacity. The
library would be justified in ad
mitting only law students dur
ing these times.
Yet, why can't it remain open
to all during the less busy times
of the year (by far the usual con-|
ditionj?
Secondly, the library seems to
be worrying that it might be
come another Meyer, with a few
students bothering other
studiers. It seems unlikely,
though, that any but serious
studiers will frequent the law
library.
And, if students do become
noisy, isn't it up to the librarians
to silence them?
It only is just that a facility,
open to any student on campus
should be open to all students,
whether they be medical stu
dents, law students or under
graduates. The only exception to
this rule should be for reasons of
space — a consideration valid
here only at special times.
