# Meritocracy or open admissions?

What alternative models exist
to the Stanford meritocracy?
Either we propose a meritocracy
with different standards, or we
admit that we cannot make
meaningful statements about
quality differences in the applic
ant pool and so move to an open
admissions policy.
If we attempt to develop dif
ferent standards of merit,
perhaps we might reward perser
verance through racist school
systems. We might seek out stu
dents who were discontented
with traditionl high schools, and
who had attempted in some way
to control their own education.
Perhaps we ought to avoid
admitting students who easily
succumb to externally imposed
standards of excellence, and so
do well in traditional high
schools, regarding this as evi
dence of lack of creativity.
A different way of looking at
meritocracy is to make judg
ments about who will do Ill's or
her community the most good
with a Stanford education.
At present it is implicit that
those students who do best in
high school also in turn serve
other people the most. This is
not by any means obvious.
Further we might look to see
individually who might in some
absolute sense benefit the most
from attending Stanford. It is
commonly assumed that the
"highest quality" student can
take the most advantage of
Stanford's faculty and facilities,
but perhaps it is a poor alloca
tion of resources to concentrate

only on those who are already
well-educated.
What would an open admis
sions Stanford be like? Many of
us would not be here.
In fact, many faculty would
not be here, because they are
qualified to teach things that are
irrelevant to the real needs of
most people. Those faculty who
remain would have to work har
der, as they would encounter
students who do not already
agree on all of the premises on
which as faculty they exist.
There would be much more
lively debate on many issues. In
a short run sense, it is Utopia to
expect any such transition,
either from students or the Uni
versity. It certainly isn't in the
interests of those who presently
derive benefits from Stanford to
change it.
It remains to be asked why
Stanford admits minority stu
dents. There is a great American
mvth of an original and continu
ing commitment to education or
all people.
Actually, a look at the timing
of the extension of various levels
of education to the working class
and minorities reveals that edu
cational opportunities are ex
tended only when the present
level of education begins to lose
its screening value and becomes
necessary for the level of work
carried on by the vast majority of
people.
That is, primary education did
not come about through the al
truism of the system. It came
only through struggle and even
then only when primary educa

tion ceased to be a ticket into the
ruling class.
Similarly today we see that a
college education no longer
guarantees a good job, much less
a ticket into the upper strata of
society.
This factor, in combination
with the previously mentioned
need to assimilate leaders of
minorities and the working
class, explains much of the wil
lingness of elite universities to
admit minority students. And
because many students, follow
ing the lead of Dean James Gibbs,
still believe the Stanford creden
tial to be a sure stepping stone to
power positions, a Stanford edu
cation is highly effective in in
stilling in students the priorities
and value structure needed to
legitimate the present social sys
tem.
This is probably best de
scribed as the effective but un
conscious working of the educa
tional system.
A more common understand
ing is the liberal understanding.
Still operating within the
basic meritocracy framework,
liberals see minorities as just as
good as anyone else in potential;
but minorities don't score so
well because of readily admitted
poor academic background, due
to past but not continuing ra
cism. Thus as a liberal educa
tional institution, Stanford owes
minorities a chance at assimila
tion into the mainstream.
When confronted with minor
ity desires to maintain cultural
identity, liberals become un
comfortable because their self
congratulatory motives are chal-

With this background, it is
possible to understand why '.he
financial aid package could be
changed last year. Minorities
seemed no longer to be struggl
ing, so in effect the need to as
similate at least strident poor
minorities seemed less pressing.
