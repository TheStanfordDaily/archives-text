# Hiring of women hits snags
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
During times of economic belt-tightening,
programs are bound to suffer and the Affirma
tive Action (AA) program is no exception.
While not facing an actual cut in operating
budget, AA nevertheless faces no increased
budget to hire more minorities and women for
the Stanford staff (lab assistants, secretaries)
and faculty (teaching, research).
AA also faces a reduced number of jobs as
departments cut programs and operations.
Many female professors have retired, and there
is intense competition from other schools for
the few qualified minority and female PhDs in
the professorial pool.
Rather than conceding defeat, the AA Office
is determined to maintain a good mix of staff
and faculty by improving hiring practices and
stepping up the search for quality personnel
according to Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost
for faculty affairs.
Is search widening?
Whether the AA faculty committee is actu
ally stepping up its search, however, is a sub
ject of controversy.
Bienenstock said that because of competi
tion for professors, especially female profes
sors among institutes of higher education,
Stanford has not been able to hire many. In the
academic year 1974-75, Harvard University
had 20 female professors out of 766 total or 2.5
percent. Stanford had 12 females out of 556, or
2.1 percent.
This situation seems to call for concerned
efforts to fill Stanford's available positions
with female professors. However, Matilda
Butler-Paisley, a lecturer in the Communica
tion department, said, "In my department, I've
seen no effort to bring in more women or
minorities."
"In the Institute for Communication Re
search, those positions that were filled since
the AA guidelines were established affirms
that there have not been adequate AA
searches." According to Butler-Paisley, there
are no full female professors in the Communi
cation Department,
Bienenstock emphasized that because of the
small number of Ph.Dsin the pool, "we must
keep searching" for qualified faculty. Only
nine percent of those who received Ph.Ds na
tionally in the 1950s were women. The number
of chicano PhDs nationally is about 500.
Stanford may be lagging
Stanford lags behind, even in the national
figures according to Butler-Paisley. "For ex
ample, in the communication field, there are
16 percent qualified women with Ph.Ds but

there are no women professors in our depart
ment. We have less than the percentage (na
tionally) available in the pool."
Anne Miner, AA officer, said that there
would be increased responsibility placed on
department managers to hire well and effec
tively to maintain "diversity" at the Univer
sity.
Refined hiring practices can be viewed as a
step toward obtaining and keeping the best
qualified people for necessary jobs. Care is
taken not to overstaff. These are good practices
even in times of plenty which keep University
costs down and benefit everyone.
Tenure issue
However, Butler-Paisley said, "In our de
partment, they feel no real pressure to conduct
thorough AA searches." Figures released by
the AA office show that in 1973-74,27 males as
compared to one female were granted tenure
while last year, 13 males and one female were
granted tenure. Appointments to the
Academic Council in 1973-74 were 10 males
and one female while last year, it was eight
males and no females.
"The figures speak for themselves," said
Butler-Paisley, whose law suit charging the
University with employment and educational
discrimination is still awaiting investigation

by the court.
Developing new programs (billets) for newly
acquired faculty seems contrary to belt
tightening procedures. However, Bienenstock
says that it is a device to attract and keep out
standing minority and female faculty.
The reason is clear. Much employment on
campus is a result of government research
grants. Research projects provide jobs for pro
fessors, graduate students and staff. The better
caliber of professoriate, the more grants Stan
ford receives and the better the job market for
minorities and women.
Drama Prof. Eleanor Prosser said her de
partment has had no problem filling professor
ial spots with females, but that "minorities are
a problem because there are not that many
qualified in the field."
Clay Carson, acting assistant history
professor, views the AA problem on a larger
scale. "These movements move only with soc
iety. This puts pressure on society to turn out
better high school students. It's shifting the
burden to society."
With no visible results, the AA office claims
to be searching for a homogeneous staff with
out sacrificing quality. It's a big job that must
be tackled with creativity, determination and
sincerity.

During times of economic belt-tightening,
programs are bound to suffer and the Affirma
tive Action (AA) program is no exception.
While not facing an actual cut in operating
budget, AA nevertheless faces no increased
budget to hire more minorities and women for
the Stanford staff (lab assistants, secretaries)
and faculty (teaching, research).
AA also faces a reduced number of jobs as
departments cut programs and operations.
Many female professors have retired, and there
is intense competition from other schools for
the few qualified minority and female PhDs in
the professorial pool.
Rather than conceding defeat, the AA Office
is determined to maintain a good mix of staff
and faculty by improving hiring practices and
stepping up the search for quality personnel
according to Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost
for faculty affairs.
Is search widening?
Whether the AA faculty committee is actu
ally stepping up its search, however, is a sub
ject of controversy.
Bienenstock said that because of competi
tion for professors, especially female profes
sors among institutes of higher education,
Stanford has not been able to hire many. In the
academic year 1974-75, Harvard University
had 20 female professors out of 766 total or 2.5
percent. Stanford had 12 females out of 556, or
2.1 percent.
This situation seems to call for concerned
efforts to fill Stanford's available positions
with female professors. However, Matilda
Butler-Paisley, a lecturer in the Communica
tion department, said, "In my department, I've
seen no effort to bring in more women or
minorities."
"In the Institute for Communication Re
search, those positions that were filled since
the AA guidelines were established affirms
that there have not been adequate AA
searches." According to Butler-Paisley, there
are no full female professors in the Communi
cation Department,
Bienenstock emphasized that because of the
small number of Ph.Dsin the pool, "we must
keep searching" for qualified faculty. Only
nine percent of those who received Ph.Ds na
tionally in the 1950s were women. The number
of chicano PhDs nationally is about 500.
Stanford may be lagging
Stanford lags behind, even in the national
figures according to Butler-Paisley. "For ex
ample, in the communication field, there are
16 percent qualified women with Ph.Ds but

there are no women professors in our depart
ment. We have less than the percentage (na
tionally) available in the pool."
Anne Miner, AA officer, said that there
would be increased responsibility placed on
department managers to hire well and effec
tively to maintain "diversity" at the Univer
sity.
Refined hiring practices can be viewed as a
step toward obtaining and keeping the best
qualified people for necessary jobs. Care is
taken not to overstaff. These are good practices
even in times of plenty which keep University
costs down and benefit everyone.
Tenure issue
However, Butler-Paisley said, "In our de
partment, they feel no real pressure to conduct
thorough AA searches." Figures released by
the AA office show that in 1973-74,27 males as
compared to one female were granted tenure
while last year, 13 males and one female were
granted tenure. Appointments to the
Academic Council in 1973-74 were 10 males
and one female while last year, it was eight
males and no females.
"The figures speak for themselves," said
Butler-Paisley, whose law suit charging the
University with employment and educational
discrimination is still awaiting investigation

by the court.
Developing new programs (billets) for newly
acquired faculty seems contrary to belt
tightening procedures. However, Bienenstock
says that it is a device to attract and keep out
standing minority and female faculty.
The reason is clear. Much employment on
campus is a result of government research
grants. Research projects provide jobs for pro
fessors, graduate students and staff. The better
caliber of professoriate, the more grants Stan
ford receives and the better the job market for
minorities and women.

granted tenure. Appointments to the
Academic Council in 1973-74 were 10 males
and one female while last year, it was eight
males and no females.
"The figures speak for themselves," said
Butler-Paisley, whose law suit charging the
University with employment and educational
discrimination is still awaiting investigation

by the court.
Developing new programs (billets) for newly
acquired faculty seems contrary to belt
tightening procedures. However, Bienenstock
says that it is a device to attract and keep out
standing minority and female faculty.
The reason is clear. Much employment on
campus is a result of government research
grants. Research projects provide jobs for pro
fessors, graduate students and staff. The better
caliber of professoriate, the more grants Stan
ford receives and the better the job market for
minorities and women.
Drama Prof. Eleanor Prosser said her de
partment has had no problem filling professor
ial spots with females, but that "minorities are
a problem because there are not that many
qualified in the field."
Clay Carson, acting assistant history
professor, views the AA problem on a larger
scale. "These movements move only with soc
iety. This puts pressure on society to turn out
better high school students. It's shifting the
burden to society."
With no visible results, the AA office claims
to be searching for a homogeneous staff with
out sacrificing quality. It's a big job that must
be tackled with creativity, determination and
sincerity.
