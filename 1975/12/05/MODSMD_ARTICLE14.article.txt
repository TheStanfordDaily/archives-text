# Radicals fall on hard times
## Political activism succumbs to apathy 
### PHILIP FEDER 
In September 1972, former radical and pres
ent congressional candidate David Harris
spoke to the incoming freshman class. Harris
exhorted the impressionable students to get off
their butts and to become politically active
while they were at Stanford.
But Harris, who had just returned from a
prison term on a charge of draft evasion, also
eulogized the radical movement. He seemed to
suggest that the good-old-days-with-the-rads
were over.
At that time, Harris wore faded blue jeans
and a torn flannel shirt.
Candidate Harris is now wearing three
piece, color-coordinated suits with six-inch
lapels in his race for the congressional seat
held by Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park).
The changes seen in Harris — in his appear
ance and in his political persuasions — are also
seen in the mood of students here. Radicalism
is passe in the view of many students. Protest
ing, burning and trashing are out. Studying

and shopping for the latest San Francisco
hair-dos and fashions are in.
The late 1960s and early 1970s saw political
activity here take a sharp left turn. After all,
Nixon bombed Cambodia, the war in Vietnam
was escalated, Nixon's re-election grew nearer
and the draft suddenly struck close to home for
many college students.
Stanford students, like thousands of others
across the nation, entered the domestic fray:
— In May 1970, at a rally of 1200 in White
Plaza, three demands were approved by an
overwhelming majority as part of a national
college strike: 1) U.S. withdrawal from South
east Asia; 2) justice in America and freedom for
all political prisoners: 3) oft-ROTC and end
Defense Department research on campus.
— In April 1972, Vietnam War protestors
trashed the campus to protest U.S. bombing
raids. Later, a torch-bearing crowd of 700
marched down Palm Drive. The next day, over
200 people — including many Stanford stu

dents — were arrested en masse when police
without warning charged a group of b5O anti
war protestors who were blocking traffic at El
Camino and Embarcadero Road.
Those events are a far-cry from the mild,
comparatively somnambulant sit-in at Old
Union for about 30 minutes by students pro
testing the University's research contract with
Iran last spring.
And the results of those protests held over
five years ago and last spring were strikingly
different. ROTC was soon to be abolished after
the student movement took place. However,
the Iran contract is on as scheduled — as are the
financial aid changes that spurred flurries of
protest last year.
The Alliance for Radical Change (ARC)
helped organize last spring's sit-in. The only
forum for radical thought here, ARC was
founded in 1974.
Since its inception, organizers say, ARC has
been devoted to eradicating three principal
"isms" — imperialism, sexism and racism.

Hut those "isms" are nothing more than ab
stract nouns until there is action — a protest, a
sit-in, a riot — for there is no other way to get
students off their butts, ARC members say.
Times have certainly changed. Provost Wil
liam Miller told a Daily reporter in October that
ARC's impact on University decisions is min
imal.
"In terms of the direct impact of the organi
zation, I'd have to say it doesn't have any," he
said. Further, Miller believes that most faculty
and administration members "wouldn't even
know what ARC is."
It was the University's Faculty Senate that
ruled to deny academic credit for ROTC here
after the protests of the earlv'7os. No similar
ruling was made on the Iran contract.
ARC's failure to effect changes in the Uni
versity is probably no fault of its own. The fault
seems to lie with the nature of the student
body. Radicalism is dead at least for now be
cause students are more interested in studying
and in having a good time at college.

In September 1972, former radical and pres
ent congressional candidate David Harris
spoke to the incoming freshman class. Harris
exhorted the impressionable students to get off
their butts and to become politically active
while they were at Stanford.
But Harris, who had just returned from a
prison term on a charge of draft evasion, also
eulogized the radical movement. He seemed to
suggest that the good-old-days-with-the-rads
were over.
At that time, Harris wore faded blue jeans
and a torn flannel shirt.
Candidate Harris is now wearing three
piece, color-coordinated suits with six-inch
lapels in his race for the congressional seat
held by Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park).
The changes seen in Harris — in his appear
ance and in his political persuasions — are also
seen in the mood of students here. Radicalism
is passe in the view of many students. Protest
ing, burning and trashing are out. Studying

and shopping for the latest San Francisco
hair-dos and fashions are in.
The late 1960s and early 1970s saw political
activity here take a sharp left turn. After all,
Nixon bombed Cambodia, the war in Vietnam
was escalated, Nixon's re-election grew nearer
and the draft suddenly struck close to home for
many college students.
Stanford students, like thousands of others
across the nation, entered the domestic fray:
— In May 1970, at a rally of 1200 in White
Plaza, three demands were approved by an
overwhelming majority as part of a national
college strike: 1) U.S. withdrawal from South
east Asia; 2) justice in America and freedom for
all political prisoners: 3) oft-ROTC and end
Defense Department research on campus.
— In April 1972, Vietnam War protestors
trashed the campus to protest U.S. bombing
raids. Later, a torch-bearing crowd of 700
marched down Palm Drive. The next day, over
200 people — including many Stanford stu

dents — were arrested en masse when police
without warning charged a group of b5O anti
war protestors who were blocking traffic at El
Camino and Embarcadero Road.
Those events are a far-cry from the mild,
comparatively somnambulant sit-in at Old
Union for about 30 minutes by students pro
testing the University's research contract with
Iran last spring.
And the results of those protests held over
five years ago and last spring were strikingly
different. ROTC was soon to be abolished after
the student movement took place. However,
the Iran contract is on as scheduled — as are the
financial aid changes that spurred flurries of
protest last year.
The Alliance for Radical Change (ARC)
helped organize last spring's sit-in. The only
forum for radical thought here, ARC was
founded in 1974.
Since its inception, organizers say, ARC has
been devoted to eradicating three principal
"isms" — imperialism, sexism and racism.

Hut those "isms" are nothing more than ab
stract nouns until there is action — a protest, a
sit-in, a riot — for there is no other way to get
students off their butts, ARC members say.
Times have certainly changed. Provost Wil
liam Miller told a Daily reporter in October that
ARC's impact on University decisions is min
imal.
"In terms of the direct impact of the organi
zation, I'd have to say it doesn't have any," he
said. Further, Miller believes that most faculty
and administration members "wouldn't even
know what ARC is."
It was the University's Faculty Senate that
ruled to deny academic credit for ROTC here
after the protests of the earlv'7os. No similar
ruling was made on the Iran contract.
ARC's failure to effect changes in the Uni
versity is probably no fault of its own. The fault
seems to lie with the nature of the student
body. Radicalism is dead at least for now be
cause students are more interested in studying
