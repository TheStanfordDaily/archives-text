## So you wanna be in the movies... Mitchell Bros, can (maybe) make you a star 
### DAVE ANSLEY 
Many people have been en
ticed into at least one porno
graphic movie. Quite often, they
will emerge from the theater ask
ing, "Where in the world did
they find that guy? That thing
was at least 13 inches long!"
Some may leave with the
thought of trying to get into the
business themselves. After all,
there would be certain advan
tages in spending a day in bed
with Linda Lovelace, even if you
did have to leave the lights on.
But how do you go about it? It
is not the sort of business you'll
find listed in the yellow pages.
Just ask Joe
Just ask Joe Straton. He was
one of five Stanford students
who answered an ad placed in
the Daily by the Mitchell Bros,
theaters in San Francisco. Al
though he hasn't been selected
for a role in a movie, he did go
through the interview proce
dure, and his name is still on file.
One of the other students (two
were women) was cast in a film,
but was unable to appear be
cause of conflicts with mid

terms.
Straton's main motive for try
ing to appear in a movie was his
"little fantasy of becoming a
stunt man. I thought they might
have a need for one. I hung
around L.A. last winter trying to
get into some movies, but I
didn't get anywhere. But I am
putting together a portfolio of
miscellaneous jumping
around."
He admits the sex involved
did interest him some. "I
thought they might just want
someone to stand around naked
or something. I hoped that for an
audition they might put me in a
soundproof room with a couple
girls and a camera in the ceiling.
At least I might meet some girls
with common interests."
But he was disappointed. He
went to the Mitchell Bros,
theater at Polk and O'Farrel in
the City, and was just inter
viewed by one of the brothers.
He was asked only four or five
questions, such as "Have you
done any acting?"
"I told him I'd taken an Acting

class, which is true. I told him I'd
done some acting in high school,
which I hadn't. I didn't want to
be refused for something trivial.
He also wanted to know what my
sexual preference was —
whether 1 was gay or bi. I told
him 'no,' and he wrote down
'straight.' 1 guess they really
want people with bizarre tal
ents."

The interviewer then took a
picture of him for the file. "I was
fully dressed, not nude. They
didn't ask me to drop trou or
nothin'."
According to Bob Cecchini,
who is the casting director for
Mitchell Bros., they do take nude
shots sometimes. He says that
the short interview and photo
graph procedure is normal for
everyone that answers one of
their casting ads. They place the
ads in several college papers and
the Chronicle.
"We got 1000 applicants in six
weeks from an ad in the Chron.
Seventy-five percent of them
were men."
Several companies in San

Francisco film porno movies, as
well as many which come up
fromL.A.just to do shooting, ac
cording to Cecchini.
"We need to continually pro
duce new ones all the time, for
our 10-theater circuit. We're just
about always working on one, so
we are casting continually. Peo
ple can come in anytime."
Most of the 15 films they pro
duce yearly are just short loops,
but they recently spent months
making a porno spectacular,
Sodom and Gomorrah. Another
big-production movie is now
being planned. Appearing in a
film will earn the actor or.actress
anywhere from $125 up for a
day's work, depending on the
role involved. In each day, how
ever, on-camera time will typi
cally be only 30 minutes to a few
hours.
Cecchini adds, "we get all
sorts of people applying. Doc
tors, lawyers, necrophiliacs,
even a guy with his pet rattles
nake. Most do very well in films,
but we try to talk to them a while
and get to know them. We want
to find out what they're like and

why they want to be in a movie.
"We need people who aren't
nervous — our major problem is
guys who can't keep an erection.
It's very understandable, with
the bright lights and people
standing all around. They're re
ally putting their egos on the
line."
Straton says he was not too
disappointed about not getting
into a film right away. "They
told me they wouldn't have any
thing for a couple months, but
that they'd keep me on file. I
thought it was sort of a hook.
They were just looking for peo
ple to fill in. I didn't have the
time anyway; I just wanted to
pursue my alternatives.
"It would have been a relief
from the academic boredom
around here. I'd try it again. An
afternoon of sex would be okay
— the dating waiting list for girls
around here is kinda long. Good
looking girls here are in the
minority, and they get to pick
and choose, playing one guy off
against the others. I'm not into
game playing."

thing for a couple months, but
that they'd keep me on file. I

afternoon of sex would be okay

looking girls here are in the
minority, and they get to pick
and choose, playing one guy off
against the others. I'm not into
game playing."
Many people have been en
ticed into at least one porno
graphic movie. Quite often, they
will emerge from the theater ask
ing, "Where in the world did
they find that guy? That thing
was at least 13 inches long!"
Some may leave with the
thought of trying to get into the
business themselves. After all,
there would be certain advan

with Linda Lovelace, even if you

Just ask Joe
Just ask Joe Straton. He was
one of five Stanford students
who answered an ad placed in
the Daily by the Mitchell Bros,
theaters in San Francisco. Al
though he hasn't been selected
for a role in a movie, he did go
through the interview proce
dure, and his name is still on file.
One of the other students (two
were women) was cast in a film,
but was unable to appear be
cause of conflicts with mid

terms.
Straton's main motive for try
ing to appear in a movie was his
"little fantasy of becoming a
stunt man. I thought they might
have a need for one. I hung
around L.A. last winter trying to
get into some movies, but I
didn't get anywhere. But I am
putting together a portfolio of
miscellaneous jumping
around."
He admits the sex involved
did interest him some. "I
thought they might just want
someone to stand around naked
or something. I hoped that for an
audition they might put me in a
soundproof room with a couple
girls and a camera in the ceiling.
At least I might meet some girls
with common interests."
But he was disappointed. He
went to the Mitchell Bros,
theater at Polk and O'Farrel in
the City, and was just inter
viewed by one of the brothers.
He was asked only four or five
questions, such as "Have you
done any acting?"
"I told him I'd taken an Acting

class, which is true. I told him I'd
done some acting in high school,
which I hadn't. I didn't want to
be refused for something trivial.
He also wanted to know what my
sexual preference was —
whether 1 was gay or bi. I told
him 'no,' and he wrote down
'straight.' 1 guess they really
want people with bizarre tal
ents."

The interviewer then took a
picture of him for the file. "I was
fully dressed, not nude. They
didn't ask me to drop trou or
nothin'."
According to Bob Cecchini,
who is the casting director for
Mitchell Bros., they do take nude
shots sometimes. He says that
the short interview and photo
graph procedure is normal for
everyone that answers one of
their casting ads. They place the
ads in several college papers and
the Chronicle.
"We got 1000 applicants in six
weeks from an ad in the Chron.
Seventy-five percent of them
were men."
Several companies in San

Francisco film porno movies, as
well as many which come up
fromL.A.just to do shooting, ac
cording to Cecchini.
"We need to continually pro
duce new ones all the time, for
our 10-theater circuit. We're just
about always working on one, so
we are casting continually. Peo
ple can come in anytime."
Most of the 15 films they pro
duce yearly are just short loops,
but they recently spent months
making a porno spectacular,
Sodom and Gomorrah. Another
big-production movie is now
being planned. Appearing in a
film will earn the actor or.actress
anywhere from $125 up for a
day's work, depending on the
role involved. In each day, how
ever, on-camera time will typi
cally be only 30 minutes to a few
hours.
Cecchini adds, "we get all
sorts of people applying. Doc
tors, lawyers, necrophiliacs,
even a guy with his pet rattles
nake. Most do very well in films,
but we try to talk to them a while
and get to know them. We want
to find out what they're like and

why they want to be in a movie.
"We need people who aren't
nervous — our major problem is
guys who can't keep an erection.
It's very understandable, with
the bright lights and people
standing all around. They're re
ally putting their egos on the
line."
Straton says he was not too
disappointed about not getting
into a film right away. "They

nake. Most do very well in films,
but we try to talk to them a while
and get to know them. We want
to find out what they're like and

why they want to be in a movie.
"We need people who aren't
nervous — our major problem is
guys who can't keep an erection.
It's very understandable, with
the bright lights and people
standing all around. They're re
ally putting their egos on the
line."
Straton says he was not too
disappointed about not getting
into a film right away. "They
told me they wouldn't have any
thing for a couple months, but
that they'd keep me on file. I
thought it was sort of a hook.
They were just looking for peo
ple to fill in. I didn't have the
time anyway; I just wanted to
pursue my alternatives.
"It would have been a relief
from the academic boredom
around here. I'd try it again. An
afternoon of sex would be okay
— the dating waiting list for girls
around here is kinda long. Good
looking girls here are in the
minority, and they get to pick
and choose, playing one guy off
against the others. I'm not into
game playing."
Many people have been en
ticed into at least one porno
graphic movie. Quite often, they
will emerge from the theater ask
ing, "Where in the world did
they find that guy? That thing
was at least 13 inches long!"
Some may leave with the
thought of trying to get into the
business themselves. After all,
there would be certain advan
tages in spending a day in bed
with Linda Lovelace, even if you
did have to leave the lights on.
But how do you go about it? It
is not the sort of business you'll
find listed in the yellow pages.
Just ask Joe
Just ask Joe Straton. He was
one of five Stanford students
who answered an ad placed in
the Daily by the Mitchell Bros,
theaters in San Francisco. Al
though he hasn't been selected
for a role in a movie, he did go
through the interview proce
dure, and his name is still on file.
One of the other students (two
were women) was cast in a film,
but was unable to appear be
cause of conflicts with mid

terms.
Straton's main motive for try
ing to appear in a movie was his
"little fantasy of becoming a
stunt man. I thought they might
have a need for one. I hung
around L.A. last winter trying to
get into some movies, but I
didn't get anywhere. But I am
putting together a portfolio of
miscellaneous jumping
around."
He admits the sex involved
did interest him some. "I
thought they might just want
someone to stand around naked
or something. I hoped that for an
audition they might put me in a
soundproof room with a couple
girls and a camera in the ceiling.
At least I might meet some girls
with common interests."
But he was disappointed. He
went to the Mitchell Bros,
theater at Polk and O'Farrel in
the City, and was just inter
viewed by one of the brothers.
He was asked only four or five
questions, such as "Have you
done any acting?"
"I told him I'd taken an Acting

class, which is true. I told him I'd
done some acting in high school,
which I hadn't. I didn't want to
be refused for something trivial.
He also wanted to know what my
sexual preference was —
whether 1 was gay or bi. I told
him 'no,' and he wrote down
'straight.' 1 guess they really
want people with bizarre tal
ents."

The interviewer then took a
picture of him for the file. "I was
fully dressed, not nude. They
didn't ask me to drop trou or
nothin'."
According to Bob Cecchini,
who is the casting director for
Mitchell Bros., they do take nude
shots sometimes. He says that
the short interview and photo
graph procedure is normal for
everyone that answers one of
their casting ads. They place the
ads in several college papers and
the Chronicle.
"We got 1000 applicants in six
weeks from an ad in the Chron.
Seventy-five percent of them
were men."
Several companies in San

Francisco film porno movies, as
well as many which come up
fromL.A.just to do shooting, ac
cording to Cecchini.
"We need to continually pro
duce new ones all the time, for
our 10-theater circuit. We're just
about always working on one, so
we are casting continually. Peo
ple can come in anytime."
Most of the 15 films they pro
duce yearly are just short loops,
but they recently spent months
making a porno spectacular,
Sodom and Gomorrah. Another
big-production movie is now
being planned. Appearing in a
film will earn the actor or.actress
anywhere from $125 up for a
day's work, depending on the
role involved. In each day, how
ever, on-camera time will typi
cally be only 30 minutes to a few
hours.
Cecchini adds, "we get all
sorts of people applying. Doc
tors, lawyers, necrophiliacs,
even a guy with his pet rattles
nake. Most do very well in films,
but we try to talk to them a while
and get to know them. We want
to find out what they're like and
