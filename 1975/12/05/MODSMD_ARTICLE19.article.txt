# Ford's brief stop in Manila expected to achieve little

MANILA (AP) â€” President
Ford's visit of less than 24 hours
to Manila this coming weekend
is expected to have little im
mediate impact on the major is
sues between the United States
and the martial law government
in the Philippines.
"Ford is facing an election, so
we cannot expect him to make
some substantive commit
ments," Foreign Secretary Car
los Romulo said in a statement
this week.
A big welcome is planned for
Ford, however. One official pre
dicted it will be "nothing short
of overwhelming."
The Phillippines' insistence
on a new security and bases ag

reement with the United States
and the lapse of a formal trade
agreement are expected to come
up in the three or four hours of
formal talks by Ford and Presi
dent Ferdinand Marcos tomor
row and Sunday.
Despite Philippine claims that
negotiations are under way on
the agreement under which the
United States operates major
military bases here, the Ameri

cans claim they have yet to see
formally what the Filipinos
want. The Americans insist mi
negotiations have started.
Talks about a treaty to replace
the Laurel-Langley Agreement,
which was rooted in the old col
onial relationship between the
countries and which lapsed July
3, 1974, are not expected to bear
fruit until at least mid-1976.
