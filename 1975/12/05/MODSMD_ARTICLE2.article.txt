# SWOPSI/SCIRE
## Senate grants 3-year extension 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
The Faculty Senate voted unanim
ously yesterday to extend for three
more years the operation of the Stan
ford Workshop on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI) and the Stanford
Center for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE).
Acting on the recommendation of
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Cibbs, the Senate adopted a resolution
which also mandates another review
hy the Senate no later than Dec.
31, 1978.
Cibbs also recommended that the
charge to operate the Urban Studies
program "be allowed to expire, as the

program is now a faculty-operated in
terdisciplinary major." No action was
needed to fulfill this recommendation,
so none was taken.
Both recommendations, according
to a memo from Cibbs to the Senate,
came with the unanimous endorse
ment of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US).
Cibbs' recommendations came as a
response to a report by the Ad Hoc
Panel on Extradepartmental Programs,
headed by Biological Sciences Prof.
Donald Kennedy.
Commitment made
In Cibbs' memo he concluded that,
"in accepting my budget recommen

dations that maintain separate ex
tradepartmental programs (EDPs),
higher administration officials will be
making a commitment of dollars and a
renewed commitment to the princi
ples of student influence in curricular
matters."
Gibbs' recommendation to retain
SWOPSI and SGIRE reversed the posi
tion he took last year, which urged
merging the two programs into various
departments.
He explained the change, writing
that, "One of my assumptions was that
a long-range goal of the student
initiated programs was to . . . have the
innovative formats they
developed . . . made an enduring part
of the University.
"If," he continued, "research
oriented workshops were accepted by
departments as an important learning
format, 1 did not think it would be crit
ical to students or to faculty that they
continue to be student-initiated.
"My surmise was incorrect," he
stated. "I came to realize . . . (that) the
student participaton is the most essen
tial element of the EDPs, more so than
the formats which that student initia
tion had designed."
Valuable contributions
Gibbs told the Senate, "The prog
rams are making valuable contribu
tions to the University in other areas
besides just the curriculum."
However. Senate member and
Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen
suggested that the advisory boards of
the EDPs should "deliberately co-opt

people who are skeptical of SWOPSI
SGIRE." He said that deliberately plac
ing skeptics on the boards would be
beneficial in terms of public relations,
especially in light of divided faculty
opinion on the value of the programs.
"You might wind up with some
tougher (EDP) courses and a lot more
administrative hassles, but you would
also gain better public relations with
those faculty who mistrust the prog
rams," he argued.
Gibbs, however, disagreed with An
dersen. He said that such a move
would "create a lot of dissension" with
few benefits.
Annual report
*Asst. English Prof. David Riggs
briefly argued against a provision of
the resolution which stipulated that,
"the Dean (of Undergraduate Studies)
will report annually totheC-US and to
the Senate about the (EDP) agencies."
"1 think it would be better if these
programs were given some breathing
space from scrutiny by the Univer
sity," Riggs said. He argued that the
programs have been under close ex
amination for quite some time.
Gibbs said he realized that such a
report to the Senate is usually accom
panied by "a great deal of nervous
ness" on the part of the agencies. How
ever, he reiterated that he felt an an
nual report was necessary neverthe
less.
Gibbs plans to step down from his
post at the end of the 1975-76
academic vear.

Cibbs' recommendations came as a
response to a report by the Ad Hoc
Panel on Extradepartmental Programs,
headed by Biological Sciences Prof.
Donald Kennedy.
Commitment made
In Cibbs' memo he concluded that,
"in accepting my budget recommen

dations that maintain separate ex
tradepartmental programs (EDPs),
higher administration officials will be
making a commitment of dollars and a
renewed commitment to the princi
ples of student influence in curricular
matters."
Gibbs' recommendation to retain
SWOPSI and SGIRE reversed the posi
tion he took last year, which urged
merging the two programs into various
departments.
He explained the change, writing
that, "One of my assumptions was that
a long-range goal of the student
initiated programs was to . . . have the
innovative formats they
developed . . . made an enduring part
of the University.
"If," he continued, "research
oriented workshops were accepted by
departments as an important learning
format, 1 did not think it would be crit
ical to students or to faculty that they
continue to be student-initiated.
"My surmise was incorrect," he
stated. "I came to realize . . . (that) the
student participaton is the most essen
tial element of the EDPs, more so than
the formats which that student initia
tion had designed."
Valuable contributions
Gibbs told the Senate, "The prog
rams are making valuable contribu
tions to the University in other areas
besides just the curriculum."
However. Senate member and
Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen
suggested that the advisory boards of
the EDPs should "deliberately co-opt

people who are skeptical of SWOPSI
SGIRE." He said that deliberately plac
ing skeptics on the boards would be
beneficial in terms of public relations,
especially in light of divided faculty
opinion on the value of the programs.
"You might wind up with some
tougher (EDP) courses and a lot more
administrative hassles, but you would
also gain better public relations with
those faculty who mistrust the prog
rams," he argued.
Gibbs, however, disagreed with An
dersen. He said that such a move
would "create a lot of dissension" with
few benefits.
Annual report
*Asst. English Prof. David Riggs
briefly argued against a provision of
the resolution which stipulated that,
"the Dean (of Undergraduate Studies)
will report annually totheC-US and to
the Senate about the (EDP) agencies."
"1 think it would be better if these
programs were given some breathing
space from scrutiny by the Univer
sity," Riggs said. He argued that the
programs have been under close ex
amination for quite some time.
Gibbs said he realized that such a
report to the Senate is usually accom
panied by "a great deal of nervous
ness" on the part of the agencies. How
ever, he reiterated that he felt an an
nual report was necessary neverthe
less.
Gibbs plans to step down from his
post at the end of the 1975-76
academic vear.
The Faculty Senate voted unanim
ously yesterday to extend for three
more years the operation of the Stan
ford Workshop on Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI) and the Stanford
Center for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE).
Acting on the recommendation of
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Cibbs, the Senate adopted a resolution
which also mandates another review
hy the Senate no later than Dec.
31, 1978.
Cibbs also recommended that the
charge to operate the Urban Studies
program "be allowed to expire, as the

program is now a faculty-operated in
terdisciplinary major." No action was
needed to fulfill this recommendation,
so none was taken.
Both recommendations, according
to a memo from Cibbs to the Senate,
came with the unanimous endorse
ment of the Committee on Under
graduate Studies (C-US).
