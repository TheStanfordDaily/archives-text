## Card chances meager against the new USF 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
The University of San Fran
cisco Dons (3-o),who meet Stan
ford (1-1) at 8 tonight in Maples
Pavilion, have a starting lineup
consisting of three freshmen and
five players who had never step
ped on a court together before
this season.
So much for looking on the
bright side.
The brutal facts for the Cards

are that inexperienced USF is
rated as high as fifth in the coun
try while Stanford will be lucky
to finish that high in the Pacific
Eight.
USF's national ranking stems
largely from Coach Bob
Gaillard's recruiting record. The
Dons' present group of freshmen
and junior college transfers is
the best of any school in the na
tion.

There are several ways of ap
preciating the extent of USF's
recruiting success. One is to note
that the newcomers have
benched three starters returning
from a USF team that went 19-7
last year.
Another is to mention that
USF's crop of recruits is so deep
that two of its freshmen, Erik
Gilberg (brother of former Stan
ford player Mark Gilberg) and
Ray Hamilton, rate as the Dons'
11 th and 12th players after being
named all-San Francisco and
all-California respectively in
high school.
Stack of chips
And another is to look at the
blue-chip recruits themslves.
First, there's 6-foot-ll fresh
man center Bill Cartwright, the
most highly regarded prep
player in the United States last
year. A two-year consensus All-
American in high school,
Cartwright averaged 38 points,
24 rebounds and seven blocked
shots his senior season.
Cartwright, from Elk Grove
near Sacramento, holds the
California single game rebound
ing record (38), and shares the
state single game scoring record
(66 points).
Then there's Winford Glads
tone Boynes 111, whose name is
almost as awesome as his reputa
tion. The Oklahoma City resi
dent, like Cartwright. was re
cruited by every school except
the University of Paris. Gaillard
calls Boynes "the best player in
the southern United States and
one of the better forward pros
pects in the country." Boynes,
6-7, was a consensus All-
American last year, averaging
27.8 points and 13 rebounds a
game.
Dominating player
Rounding out the top three
freshmen starters is James
Hardy. Gaillard refers to the 6-8
forward-center from Long Beach
as "the most dominating high
school player I've ever seen."
Another prep All-American,
Hardy averaged 29.1 points and
11 rebounds a game his senior
season.
