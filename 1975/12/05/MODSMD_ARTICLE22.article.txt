# Cartwright lacks only experience

The cover of the University of
San Francisco basketball media
guide features a picture of
6-foot-ll freshman center Bill
Cartwright and three other new
comers standing in front of the
Transamerica Pyramid building
in downtown San Francisco.
"Caillard (Don Coach Boh
Gaillard) is recruiting that next
year." said a reporter, pointing
to the pyramid. The tower may
have a bit of a size advantage
over Cartwright. but how many
points can it score? Anyway,
USF wouldn't need it for another
four years.
For whtm the two-year con
sensus All-American from Elk
Grove High School announced
that he was coming to the Hilltop
last spring, USF almost assured
itself of four trips to the NCAA
basketball tournament.
Recruiting war
USF basketball season ticket
sales have jumped 600 percent
since Cartwright signed the let
ter of intent, ending one of the
most intensive recruiting wars
since the Civil War.
About the only thing
Cartwright couldn't do in high
school was answer all his mail.
He shot 07 percent from the floor
last year, averaging 38.0 points
per game and 24 rebounds.
But that's all in the past.
Cartwright hasn't exactly caught
the fancy of the media, who
wrote such nice things about
him before the season began.
"He should be killing
everyone," said one reporter
during the Don's 109-H4 win
over San Francisco State on
Tuesday.

Cartwright scored 17 points
and pulled down a meager seven
rebounds against a bunch of
players who looked as if they
•had been recruited right off the
playgrounds.
Not a Walton
"He's no Bill Walton yet," said
another reporter after one of
State's midgets went around
Cartwright for a layup.
Cartwright didn't even resem
ble Walton, his legs flopping
over a too-short training table, as
a trainer massaged his back.
Standing next to him, you
keep waiting for a little man to
step outside of him,as inCraham
Wilson cartoons. His head
doesn't seem to fit his tall frame;
it belongs on someone about 5-7.
Cartwright speaks in a soft
voice as he towers over his
locker. "Man, it's just playing
time, I just have to get a little
more experience playing in col
lege."
Somebody asks him about his
seven rebounds: "In high school
you don't have to move around
so much. Here you have to move
around the offensive boards."
Gaillard says, "You guys (the
press) should just give him a lit
tle time. Last year he didn't have
to move as much as he is here.
It's going to take some time for
him to get more confidence."
Considered Stanford
Cartwright certainly wasn't
lacking confidence last year,
when he was being recruited by
every school that has a basket
ball team. "Yeah, 1 thought about
Stanford, but I narrowed it down
pretty quickly. I wanted to stay
inCalifornia and USF seemed to
be the best place and it is."

USF wouldn't need it for another
four years.
For whtm the two-year con
sensus All-American from Elk
Grove High School announced
that he was coming to the Hilltop
last spring, USF almost assured
itself of four trips to the NCAA
basketball tournament.
Recruiting war
USF basketball season ticket
sales have jumped 600 percent
since Cartwright signed the let
ter of intent, ending one of the
most intensive recruiting wars
since the Civil War.
About the only thing
Cartwright couldn't do in high
school was answer all his mail.
He shot 07 percent from the floor
last year, averaging 38.0 points
per game and 24 rebounds.
But that's all in the past.
Cartwright hasn't exactly caught
the fancy of the media, who
wrote such nice things about
him before the season began.
"He should be killing
everyone," said one reporter
during the Don's 109-H4 win
over San Francisco State on
Tuesday.

Cartwright scored 17 points
and pulled down a meager seven
rebounds against a bunch of
players who looked as if they
•had been recruited right off the
playgrounds.
Not a Walton
"He's no Bill Walton yet," said
another reporter after one of
State's midgets went around
Cartwright for a layup.
Cartwright didn't even resem
ble Walton, his legs flopping
over a too-short training table, as
a trainer massaged his back.
Standing next to him, you
keep waiting for a little man to
step outside of him,as inCraham
Wilson cartoons. His head
doesn't seem to fit his tall frame;
it belongs on someone about 5-7.
Cartwright speaks in a soft
voice as he towers over his
locker. "Man, it's just playing
time, I just have to get a little
more experience playing in col
lege."
Somebody asks him about his
seven rebounds: "In high school
you don't have to move around
so much. Here you have to move
around the offensive boards."
Gaillard says, "You guys (the
press) should just give him a lit
tle time. Last year he didn't have
to move as much as he is here.
It's going to take some time for
him to get more confidence."
Considered Stanford
Cartwright certainly wasn't
lacking confidence last year,
when he was being recruited by
every school that has a basket
ball team. "Yeah, 1 thought about
Stanford, but I narrowed it down
pretty quickly. I wanted to stay
inCalifornia and USF seemed to
be the best place and it is."

San Francisco basketball media
guide features a picture of
6-foot-ll freshman center Bill
Cartwright and three other new
comers standing in front of the
Transamerica Pyramid building
in downtown San Francisco.
"Caillard (Don Coach Boh
Gaillard) is recruiting that next
year." said a reporter, pointing
to the pyramid. The tower may
have a bit of a size advantage
over Cartwright. but how many
points can it score? Anyway,
