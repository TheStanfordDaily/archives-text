## A 						poor bowl solution 
### Ron Beck 
USC in the Liberty Bowl.
No wonder. Look at the team's statistics and
you'll see why. Fifth place in the Pacific
Eight . . . lost its last four games . . . 3-4 league
record .
Besides, if the Liberty Bowl wanted another Pac
-8 team, who would've been good enough?
It should be obvious that the Liberty Bowl
Selection Committee made a fairly bad judgement
error by choosing USC over California for its an
nual post-season game. But it would be just as bad
an error by the Pac-8 officials if they elect to
change next year's post-season eligibility re
quirements just so this situation won't happen
again.
Sports fans around the league are clamoring for
the Pac-8 to only permit league teams to go to
post-season games on the basis of conference
standings. In other words, this season USC
couldn't attend a bowl game unless Cal, then
Stanford, and finally Washington declined invita
tions to the same game.
In theory alone, the idea seems ridiculous. Why
should a bowl committee interested in providing
a good game and making a financial profit be
obligated to go by the league standings? Rarely do
the final standings accurately reflect the abilities
of the teams.
For example, it would be hard to argue that
Stanford's second-place team last season was ac
tually the second-strongest team.
And that's where the practice of this decision
would be absurd. Until this season, no team be
sides the Rose Bowl-bound conference leader was
permitted to participate in post-season games, so
assuming, for the sake of argument, that the
league's position had been in effect last year, any
one besides league-leader USC would have been
eligible.
But if the fans had their way and teams were

only able to attend bowl games in order of their
league finish, then Stanford, the undisputed
second-place team according to league standings,
would have been next-in-line for post-season
play.
To a bowl committee interested in bringing Cal
players such as Steve Bartkowski, Steve Rivera
and even Chuck \luncie to its game, the prospect
of having to invite Stanford over Cal and hope that
Stanford would decline would have seemed aw
fully forbidding.
Another reason why an additional eligibility
requirement would frustrate selection of Pac-8
teams is the time factor.
It would have been nearly impossible for the
Liberty Bowl to select any other Pac-8 team be
sides Southern Cal as early as it did for those
reasons.
USC was already out of Rose Bowl contention,
so it was available for other games. California,
however, was still tied up in the midst of the
league race and wouldn't have been able to pro
vide any response all the way up until last
weekend. Additionally, at the time the commit
tees made their decisions, Cal seemed to be a weak
gate attraction.
USC, on the other hand, had been ranked
number one in the nation for four of the first six
weeks of the season and was nationally recog
nized. Ricky Bell was being touted as a future O.J.
Simpson, and Coach John McKay was making his
farewell from the college football scene.
In retrospect, though, it's clear that the commit
tee erred. But if the answer to eliminating the
recurrence of this error is to change the post
season eligibility requirements, the Pac-8 would
be making a big mistake. And it would probably
lead to lessened chances of any conference team
being invited to play in any post-season competi
tion other than the Rose Bowl.
