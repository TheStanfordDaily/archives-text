Moluccan terrorists shoot hostage
AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands —South Moluccan ex
tremists waged twin terror actions in Holland yesterday in
their struggle for an East Indies homeland.
They seized the Indonesian consulate in Amsterdam
and took2l children and at least 15 others hostage. Ninety
miles to the north, in Beilen, comrades holding a hijacked
train since Tuesday led one of their 38 hostages to the door
and shot him.
The extremists are some of 40,000 natives of the South
Molucca Islands of Indonesia who fled or were expelled to
the Netherlands after an abortive uprising against Jakarta
rule in 1950, the year after the Dutch granted indepen
dence in Indonesia.
In a typed message from the Beilen gunmen, relayed by
a mediator, the Moluccans said, "we are doing this be
cause the people in the train and the Dutch people did not
approach the Dutch government 25 years ago when great
injustice was done to our people." The statement was
signed: "Free South Moluccan Youth."
The Netherlands cannot grant them a homeland m v.
and there is no realistic expectation that Indonesia would.
House approves tax cut renewal
WASHINGTON — The House passed and sent to the
Senate a $ 13-bi 11 ion personal tax cut extension yesterday
despite threats of a veto from President Ford.
Approval came on a 257-166 vote.
Ford has vowed to veto any tax cut which does not
include a ceiling on government spending to match the
reduction in income from taxes. The House voted 220 to
202 to reject attaching a spending ceiling to the measure.
House Republican Leader John Rhodes of Arizona said
he had contacted Ford about the measure as approved and
that the President verified that it would be vetoed if sent to
his desk.
If no tax bill has been approved by Jan. 1 tax rates would
automatically jump back up to 1974 levels, resulting in
increased withholding from paychecks.
Economic experts have said this could slow the
economic recovery.
Chinese confirm deaths of MIAs
PEKING. — President Ford left for Indonesia today after
five days in China, carrying word from the Chinese that
seven U.S. servicemen listed as missing in action during
or before the Vietnam war were dead.
The news, given yesterday apparently as a good-will
gesture from China aimed at filling an information gap,
will end a long wait for seven American families.
Besides the word on the seven dead U.S. servicemen,
there were no other major announcements during Ford's
China trip.

between the railroads and four shopcraft unions repres

Moluccan terrorists shoot hostage
AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands —South Moluccan ex
tremists waged twin terror actions in Holland yesterday in
their struggle for an East Indies homeland.
They seized the Indonesian consulate in Amsterdam
and took2l children and at least 15 others hostage. Ninety
miles to the north, in Beilen, comrades holding a hijacked
train since Tuesday led one of their 38 hostages to the door
and shot him.
The extremists are some of 40,000 natives of the South
Molucca Islands of Indonesia who fled or were expelled to
the Netherlands after an abortive uprising against Jakarta
rule in 1950, the year after the Dutch granted indepen
dence in Indonesia.
In a typed message from the Beilen gunmen, relayed by
a mediator, the Moluccans said, "we are doing this be
cause the people in the train and the Dutch people did not
approach the Dutch government 25 years ago when great
injustice was done to our people." The statement was
signed: "Free South Moluccan Youth."
The Netherlands cannot grant them a homeland m v.

House approves tax cut renewal
WASHINGTON — The House passed and sent to the
Senate a $ 13-bi 11 ion personal tax cut extension yesterday
despite threats of a veto from President Ford.
Approval came on a 257-166 vote.
Ford has vowed to veto any tax cut which does not
include a ceiling on government spending to match the
reduction in income from taxes. The House voted 220 to
202 to reject attaching a spending ceiling to the measure.
House Republican Leader John Rhodes of Arizona said
he had contacted Ford about the measure as approved and
that the President verified that it would be vetoed if sent to
his desk.
If no tax bill has been approved by Jan. 1 tax rates would
automatically jump back up to 1974 levels, resulting in
increased withholding from paychecks.
Economic experts have said this could slow the
economic recovery.
Chinese confirm deaths of MIAs
PEKING. — President Ford left for Indonesia today after

there were no other major announcements during Ford's
China trip.

House approves tax cut renewal
WASHINGTON — The House passed and sent to the
Senate a $ 13-bi 11 ion personal tax cut extension yesterday
despite threats of a veto from President Ford.
Approval came on a 257-166 vote.
Ford has vowed to veto any tax cut which does not
include a ceiling on government spending to match the
reduction in income from taxes. The House voted 220 to
202 to reject attaching a spending ceiling to the measure.
House Republican Leader John Rhodes of Arizona said
he had contacted Ford about the measure as approved and
that the President verified that it would be vetoed if sent to
his desk.
If no tax bill has been approved by Jan. 1 tax rates would
automatically jump back up to 1974 levels, resulting in
increased withholding from paychecks.
Economic experts have said this could slow the
economic recovery.
Chinese confirm deaths of MIAs
PEKING. — President Ford left for Indonesia today after
five days in China, carrying word from the Chinese that
seven U.S. servicemen listed as missing in action during

gesture from China aimed at filling an information gap,
will end a long wait for seven American families.
Besides the word on the seven dead U.S. servicemen,
there were no other major announcements during Ford's
China trip.

Threatened rail strike averted
WASHINGTON —The threat of a crippling national rail
strike ended yesterday with a tentative contract agreement
between the railroads and four shopcraft unions repres
enting 70,000 workers
The unions were the last of 15 to settle with the industry
this year. They accepted basically the same three-year
agreement as negotiated by the others, with the exception

their struggle for an East Indies homeland.

approach the Dutch government 25 years ago when great
injustice was done to our people." The statement was
signed: "Free South Moluccan Youth."
