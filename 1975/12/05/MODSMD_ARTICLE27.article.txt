# For state aid commission
## ASSU to select students 
### ANN POLLOCK 
The ASSU Senate next week will nominate three stu
dents to fill a newly-formed position on the State Student
Aid Commission. These students will compete individu
ally with all other nominees from private postsecondary
educational institutions for the new position.
The position is one of two set spots created by the
passage of Assembly Bill 1031 this autumn. Two students,
one from a private postsecondary school and the other
from a public postsecondary school, will be added to the
now 11 member commission.
The commission is the principal liaison between the
federal government and the state of California in matters
concerning scholarships, aid and loans, according to
ASSU Senate Chairman William Hoke.
The ASSU Senate will send the nominees' names to
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. who will appoint one of the two
new representatives. The Speaker of the Assembly will
appoint the other representative.

All California postsecondary schools are eligible to
nominate candidates, but because of poor publicity, many
schools probably won't participate this year, according to
Hoke.
"We will send a letter to Governor Brown to indicate
that we've nominated these three people, and we'll invite
them (the nominees) to send a resume in the letter to
present themselves in the best light," said Hoke.
Hoke speculated that Brown will look for the best rep
resentative of student opinion. "The student won't be
there as just another individual but as a student who can
lend the flair of insight and talent," he said.
The bill requires a minimum of three nominations from
each participating school, but Hoke said that nominating
more than three students would decrease the likelihood of
having a Stanford student chosen for the position.
Gaining student input and opinions were the major
incentives for adding student representatives to the com
mission, according to Hoke.
