# Douglas: 'concern for individual rights'
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
Douglas "loved humanity but not people," said Alan Austin, a former law
clerk for recently retired Supreme Court Justice William Douglas at a panel
discussion on the maverick jurist held yesterday.
The four-member panel, moderated by Law Prof. William Cohen, offered
divergent views on Douglas to a crowd of about 75 at the Law School.
"The difference between (justices) Douglas and (Hugo) Black," said Leonard
Boudin, a civil liberties attorney and presently a visiting professor at Berkeley,
"is that Black was a strict 18th century constructionist who said the law meant
exactly what it said.
"Douglas was a more sophisticated 2()th century constructionist whose
creativity enabled him to match the increasing power of government with the
advancement of human rights."

Boudin commented on Douglas'
ability to "take a statute, analyze it and
reach a conclusion in an area he hadn't
before studied."
Extraordinary concern
He added that Douglas had an "ex
traordinary and unbroken record of
concern for individual rights and that
means a concern for democracy."
Bernard Wolfman. president of the
Philadelphia chapter of the American
Civil Liberties I Inion, a tax lawyer, and
currently an associate of the Center for
Advanced Studies in the Behavioral
Sciences here, was an outspoken critic
of Douglas.
By his failure to write dissents for
certain cases in which he was the lone
dissenter, "he was rebelling against
the system. He cannot justify his vote
by law and has walked away from it
all." said Wolfman.
Performance reviewed
Wolfman "decided to make a sys
tematic review of Douglas' perfor
mance, especially in tax related
cases." and he found a marked shift in
Douglas's position.
"In the first five years (of his term) he
voted for the government's claim even
more (otten) than the government
won." The government won 75 per
cent of the cases.
But in the 19405, Douglas voted
more often on the taxpayer's side.
Many times he was the only dissenter,
and some of his written dissents were
"utterly distorted" with many state
ments "taken out of context" and with
"errors, glaring and repeated," said
Wolfman.
Austin, a Stanford graduate, gave a
more personal view of the justice.
"He works you hard and demands a
lot. Praise and thanks are not com
mon," said Austin.
Amazing writer
But in terms of his work, "he writes a
tremendous first draft. In three hours
he can turn out a draft opinion that can
amaze you with its complexity."
Unfortunately, added Austin, "if
he's not interested in the case, he won't
work on it (the draft) very much and
what you finally see is not much dif
ferent from the first draft."
"He's really a folk hero . . . look at
his mail," said Austin. "People see
Douglas as the 'Champion of the Little
People.' That's because he says things
that tell people things. People can re
late to them."
Cohen, who concluded the panel
discussion, said he was unabashedly
pro-Douglas and read some of Doug
las' writings.
Wrote Douglas: "We will take the
direct and daring course. If we have
the facts and know we are right, we
will fight on. It's far better to lose
pleading the cause of justice and
right."

cent of the cases.
But in the 19405, Douglas voted
more often on the taxpayer's side.
Many times he was the only dissenter,
and some of his written dissents were
"utterly distorted" with many state
ments "taken out of context" and with
"errors, glaring and repeated," said
Wolfman.
Austin, a Stanford graduate, gave a
more personal view of the justice.
"He works you hard and demands a
lot. Praise and thanks are not com
mon," said Austin.
Amazing writer
But in terms of his work, "he writes a
tremendous first draft. In three hours
he can turn out a draft opinion that can
amaze you with its complexity."
Unfortunately, added Austin, "if
he's not interested in the case, he won't
work on it (the draft) very much and
what you finally see is not much dif
ferent from the first draft."
"He's really a folk hero . . . look at
his mail," said Austin. "People see
Douglas as the 'Champion of the Little
People.' That's because he says things
that tell people things. People can re
late to them."
Cohen, who concluded the panel
discussion, said he was unabashedly
pro-Douglas and read some of Doug
las' writings.
Wrote Douglas: "We will take the
direct and daring course. If we have
the facts and know we are right, we
will fight on. It's far better to lose
pleading the cause of justice and
right."
Douglas "loved humanity but not people," said Alan Austin, a former law
clerk for recently retired Supreme Court Justice William Douglas at a panel
discussion on the maverick jurist held yesterday.
The four-member panel, moderated by Law Prof. William Cohen, offered
divergent views on Douglas to a crowd of about 75 at the Law School.
"The difference between (justices) Douglas and (Hugo) Black," said Leonard
Boudin, a civil liberties attorney and presently a visiting professor at Berkeley,
"is that Black was a strict 18th century constructionist who said the law meant
exactly what it said.
"Douglas was a more sophisticated 2()th century constructionist whose
creativity enabled him to match the increasing power of government with the
advancement of human rights."

Boudin commented on Douglas'
ability to "take a statute, analyze it and
reach a conclusion in an area he hadn't
before studied."
Extraordinary concern
He added that Douglas had an "ex
traordinary and unbroken record of
concern for individual rights and that
means a concern for democracy."
Bernard Wolfman. president of the
Philadelphia chapter of the American
Civil Liberties I Inion, a tax lawyer, and
currently an associate of the Center for
Advanced Studies in the Behavioral
Sciences here, was an outspoken critic
of Douglas.
By his failure to write dissents for
certain cases in which he was the lone
dissenter, "he was rebelling against
the system. He cannot justify his vote
by law and has walked away from it
all." said Wolfman.
Performance reviewed
Wolfman "decided to make a sys
tematic review of Douglas' perfor
mance, especially in tax related
cases." and he found a marked shift in
Douglas's position.
"In the first five years (of his term) he
voted for the government's claim even
more (otten) than the government
won." The government won 75 per
cent of the cases.
