# Hancock grant
## ARLO receives $10,000 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Another $10,000 grant from the
Menlo Park-based Hancock Founda
tion will enable the Action Research
Liaison Office (ARLO) to continue its
programs for another six months, ac
cording to ARLO co-directors Edith
Eddy and Bill Leland.
Founded in 1974. ARLO serves to
"coordinate student research prog
rams for companies in the public sec
tor," according to Leland. Presently,
ARLO is overseeing "roughly 34 pro
jects," Leland said, "which will be
used by the organizations, instead of
being thrown in the wastebasket."
According to Noble Hancock, one of
the eight directors of the Hancock
Foundation, "we like to look for prog
rams that will be useful to the com
munity. and the way ARLO ap
proaches problems sounds very
good."
The Hancock Foundation also gave
ARLO $10,000 last year. This year's
grant is for "general operations," Han
cock said, and "not for funding
specific programs."
Reliance on donations
Operating on an annual budget of
$24,000, ARLO is in the middle of a
three-year trial period, during which it
receives no direct University funding
and relies primarily on donations, Le
land said.
ARLO has now received a total of
$15,000 this quarter, counting this
latest donation.
If funding continues at this rate.
ARLO will receive more money for the
year than its present budget requires.
"Our policy board is looking into
how much more growth we want." Le
land said.
"We'll probably decide to level off

not much above our present level." he
said, pointing out that he'd rather
"have a few quality programs than a lot
of projects that flounder." Eddy said a
budgeting decision is expected winter
quarter.
Staff change
Leland said the board is also consid
ering "having two fulltime staffers,"
instead of having the co-directors,
working 25 hours a week.
If little expansion is planned. Leland
says he and Eddy will "present our
situation to donors. It's deceptive not
to give them information about how

we stand and end up building up our
kitty."
However, Leland said ARLO will
seek University funding when the trial
period ends.
"It'll be harder to get foundation
money then," he predicted. "Founda
tions like to see themselves as on the
cutting edge, encouraging new or
ganizations. Once an organization is
established, it's expected to have its
own budget base."
Hancock agreed, saying, "normally
we go for two or three years and then

expect an organization to get commun
ity support."
ARLO's budget covers "salaries, of
fice costs, promotional literature and
educational material," Leland said.
Without the latest Hancock grant,
Leland said, ARLO's existing funds
would have covered operations "for
about another month. The money was
needed to keep going.
"Fundraising has to be pursued
rather aggressively," Leland asserted.
"There's a decrease in the amount of
money available." Eddy said, "our
fundraising involves lots of efforts. We
taik to many groups."
Eddy and Leland have located some
tentative grants but have yet to obtain
additional funding guarantees.
ARLO unsuccessfully sought a stu
dent fee assessment last spring. Eddy
said, "it would be premature" to pre
dict whether a fee assessment would
be sought this year.

expect an organization to get commun

ARLO's budget covers "salaries, of
fice costs, promotional literature and
educational material," Leland said.
Without the latest Hancock grant,
Leland said, ARLO's existing funds
would have covered operations "for
about another month. The money was
needed to keep going.
"Fundraising has to be pursued
rather aggressively," Leland asserted.
"There's a decrease in the amount of
money available." Eddy said, "our
fundraising involves lots of efforts. We
taik to many groups."
Eddy and Leland have located some
tentative grants but have yet to obtain
additional funding guarantees.
ARLO unsuccessfully sought a stu
dent fee assessment last spring. Eddy
said, "it would be premature" to pre
dict whether a fee assessment would
be sought this year.
Another $10,000 grant from the
Menlo Park-based Hancock Founda
tion will enable the Action Research
Liaison Office (ARLO) to continue its
programs for another six months, ac
cording to ARLO co-directors Edith
Eddy and Bill Leland.
Founded in 1974. ARLO serves to
"coordinate student research prog
rams for companies in the public sec
tor," according to Leland. Presently,
ARLO is overseeing "roughly 34 pro
jects," Leland said, "which will be
used by the organizations, instead of
being thrown in the wastebasket."
According to Noble Hancock, one of
the eight directors of the Hancock
Foundation, "we like to look for prog
rams that will be useful to the com
munity. and the way ARLO ap
proaches problems sounds very
good."
The Hancock Foundation also gave
ARLO $10,000 last year. This year's
grant is for "general operations," Han
cock said, and "not for funding
specific programs."
Reliance on donations
Operating on an annual budget of
$24,000, ARLO is in the middle of a
three-year trial period, during which it
receives no direct University funding
and relies primarily on donations, Le
land said.
ARLO has now received a total of
$15,000 this quarter, counting this
latest donation.
If funding continues at this rate.
ARLO will receive more money for the
year than its present budget requires.
"Our policy board is looking into
how much more growth we want." Le
land said.
"We'll probably decide to level off

not much above our present level." he
said, pointing out that he'd rather
"have a few quality programs than a lot
of projects that flounder." Eddy said a
budgeting decision is expected winter
quarter.
Staff change
Leland said the board is also consid
ering "having two fulltime staffers,"
instead of having the co-directors,
working 25 hours a week.
If little expansion is planned. Leland
says he and Eddy will "present our
situation to donors. It's deceptive not
to give them information about how

we stand and end up building up our
kitty."
However, Leland said ARLO will
seek University funding when the trial
period ends.
"It'll be harder to get foundation
money then," he predicted. "Founda
tions like to see themselves as on the
cutting edge, encouraging new or
ganizations. Once an organization is
established, it's expected to have its
own budget base."
Hancock agreed, saying, "normally
