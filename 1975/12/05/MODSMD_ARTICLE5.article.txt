# Protests erupt at two state colleges
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Approximately 150 to 250 students
are occupying a hallway and a room in
the administration building at Chico
State University in protest of a deci
sion to arm all campus police in the
California State universities and Col
leges.
Meanwhile, at Sonoma State Uni
versity near Santa Rosa, about 30 stu
dents will be spending the night in the
hallway outside the president's office
to protest the same decision. No arrests
have been made yet at either college.
At Chico State, "speeches were
given at a rally on the campus Wed
nesday, and then 400 to 600 students
went to the administration building to
see the president but found out he was
in Los Angeles," explained Bill Carle,
Chico State student body director of
academic affairs.
Chico State University President
Stanford Cazier flew back to the cam
pus Wednesday night. After talking
with him, about 200 students spent the
night in the president's conference
room and exterior office area.
Told to vacate
Ed Masterson, Chico State director
of university relations, told the Daily
thatyesterday morning, "the president
told them (the students) to vacate the
conference room and exterior office
area. If they didn't, they would be ar
rested."
The demonstrators then moved into
the hallway. "Since they vacated, no

arrests were made, and the police were
sent off," said Masterson. They are still
lining the hall but are not blocking
entry ways or traffic so no action is
planned, said Masterson.
According to Masterson, the univer
sity was going to use its own police
and about six Chico police to remove
the demonstrators.
However, Phil McGuire, one of
the demonstrators inside the building,
said, "about 10:45 (yesterday) today
about 40 Butte County deputy sheriffs
in full riot gear surrounded the build
ing. Then (Political Science Prof.) Ed
Bronson, our legal advisor, informed
400 of us of our rights. By a majority
vote we decided to move into the hall
way."
Local control
Students do not think the system
wide decision should apply at Chico.
"The crime rates at San Francisco and
San Jose are not applicable here. We'd
'ike to keep it an educational institu
tion," explained Carle.
Since the new ruling for arming
campus police went into effect on Oct.
1, one campus police officer has had
his gun fired accidentally. "He shot a
desk, and he was suspended," said
Carle.
Carle remarked that, "the students
are prepared to stay many more
nights. They will only leave when
the policy is changed or (Glenn)
Dumke (chancellor of the state univer
sity and colleges) comes up here."
Dumke had offered to have three
students fly to Los Angeles to meet
with him. "That was flatly rejected,"
said Carle.
Referendum
A two day referendum, in which
2000 votes had been cast by last night,
will attempt to resolve whether cam
pus security at Chico should carry
firearms and whether security policies
should be controlled at the campus
level or throughout the university and
college system.
Carle believes that the referendum
