# Trivial issues
## 
### 
The apparent lack of activism
or discussion of serious issues
outside of the classroom, and the
reactionary attitudes expressed
recently regarding both the mas
cot and minority issues are
alarming.
The issues receiving the most
attention tend to be trivial and/or
insular.
The mascot is a good example.
The Indian was abolished in
1972 for very good, compelling
reasons. It has re-emerged as an
intellectual game at the expense
of the Native Americans, who
should not have to devote more
time to such matters.
This conflict must be some
what disturbing to Lyman,
Rosenzweig and others who are
on record as morally opposed to
the mascot's re-instatement,
since this issue reflects a certain
insensitivity of the student body
and alumni.
Conceivably a near majority of
students and alumni desire a re
turn to the old symbol. But to
frame the issue as "the rights of
the majority over a vocal minor
ity" is absurd in this context.
What's going on? Lyman's
conduct confuses me.
In his Oct. 3 speech before the
Academic Council he asked that
"the faculty assist in the de
velopment of genuinely lively
minds, and not merely minds
that can respond to examination
papers and produce term pap
ers."
In a Nov. 12 speech at Tresid
der Union, Lyman suggested a
possible alternative criteria for
judging the student body when
he said, "Perhaps we should
judge a student body somewhat
less on its verbal SAT score, and
more on the quality of its discon
tents. Do these involve signific
ant issues, or frivolous and tri
vial ones? Do the students by
and large support their positions
intelligently and imagina
tively."
And he finished by saying, "a
student body which emerges
well from being assessed on
these grounds is. I submit, in
pretty good shape."
Apply to Stanford?
Surely Lyman can
not in all honesty apply his test
to Stanford in 1975 and find that
we emerge "in pretty good
shape."
Perhaps a slightly different
approach should be taken to

these matters.
A university needs people,
preferably wealthy, to make
healthy contributions, and a sta
ble environment to attract con
tractors. Wealthy parents make
good donors and students move
on to be successful alumni.
Of course, the connection be
tween the university and indus
try is obvious — trained person
nel. The needs and desires of
each of these groups is under
stood by all and in many cases
overlap.
'Socio-economic mix'
Hargadon has said "it's not
our job to seek a certain socio
economic mix. Our job is to re
cruit the most talented stu
dents."
How does he do this? Princi
pally with the high school GPA
and SAT scores.
Not surprisingly, a recent
study correlated high parental
income to high scores. And, ac
cording to the Nov. 18 Daily, 44
percent of the entering
1973-1974 class had parental in
comes over $30,000 per year.
By the way, I have never seen
any studies which indicate that
superior GPA and SAT perfor
mance are related to high crea
tive output.
It seems that the University is
more concerned with ac
cumulating a competitive, un
iform group with similar
sociological values than with
weeding out from diverse back
ground "lively minds" which
could bring differing perspec
tives to problems that exist in
society.
But perhaps the risk is too
great. The University must pres
ent an acceptable image to too
many special interests.
In view of these pressures, we
may never find the University in
the forefront of tackling social
questions. Further, although the
potential exists, the University
regrettably is also not likely to
takea leading role in eliminating
discriminatory practices.
The University will follow
federal law and fill the needs of
industry, but don't look for the
University to actively seek
minority enrollment in the spirit
of expanding the educational
process — the track record is, un
fortunately, very poor.
