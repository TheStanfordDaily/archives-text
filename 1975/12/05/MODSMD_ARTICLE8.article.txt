# Elitist attitude

This past month witnessed an
onslaught of columns of the sort
Richard Fearon wrote in the
Nov. 24 Daily. We are concerned
about Fearon's column because
of his use of weakly defined ter
minology and his dearth of logic.
However, the article's vague
ness doesn't fool a careful
reader, for the author possesses
an elitist attitude which is very
disquieting.
Fearon and those of his per
suasion seem to be upset at
blacks, chicanos, Native Ameri
cans and Asians for creating a
problem — protesting financial
aid policies, questioning admis
sions and refusing to be regarded
as mascots and second class citi
zens.
We are upsef about Fearon's
resorting to the old trick of bring
ing out token individuals such
as a Prince Lightfoot. a Pale
Moon or a Thomas Sowell to
speak for a group. We find this
both patronizing and revolting.
He might as well bring back
Tonto and Stepin Fetchit.
Lower qualifications
Fearon and those like him say
they're merely concerned with
"quality" and that minority stu
dents have lower qualifications.
What are we dealing with in this
assertion — SAT scores?
How many white Stanford
students have Boo test scores and
4.0 grade point averages? Are
Yale. Harvard and Stanford all
composed of students with these
qualifications?
No one would desire such a
student body; everyone at least
gives lip service to diversity.
Obviously there are other
criteria.
Besides, one can't assume a
homogeneous minority student
body. Many nonwhites are as
qualified as whites, if not more
so.
Major premise
Fearon's major premise is that
"discrimination can only be
against individuals, not against
groups." Isn't it possible that in
dividuals are discriminated
against because they belong to a
particular group?
If we examine the law books of
this country — past and present
— we see that there are a few
minority groups that have been
subjected to systematic, in
stitutionalized oppression.
Laws denied this country's
original inhabitants citizenship,
kept one sixth of the country as

second class citizens, ignored
the language of one segment of
the population and even put one
group in concentration camps.
No one denied blacks admis
sion to schools or put Japanese in
camps just because they were
individuals. Individuals have
been oppressed in this country
because they are members of par
ticular groups, and these groups
have been subjected to racism,
oppression and, because of those
like Fearon, elitism.
Non-white admissions
In a fairly recent attempt to
develop these segments of the
populace, and in keeping with
federal pressures, Stanford fi
nally let in some non-white stu
dents.
Yet, despite opinions to the
contrary, Stanford has no set
"quota" on minority admis
sions. And if it does, then it cer
tainly doesn't reflect the demog
raphic makeup of the nation.
Stanford minority admissions
are only 15 percent of the entire
class, which barely matches the
nation-wide percentage of
blacks, let alone Puerto Ricans or
chicanos.
If there is any distorted quota
at Stanford, it's that of upper
middle class, white males. This
is the "minority" to which Stan
ford has always addressed itself:
the privileged few.
Exclude whites
Underneath all the rhetoric
about spoiling the pristine land
scape with people who don't
need suntans is the belief that to
include third world students is
to exclude whites. No one sug
gests that.
Why haven't we seen more ar
ticles calling for poor whites at
Stanford? We welcome it. The
only people who may get exc
luded by a more open admis
sions policy are rich whites.
Is that really what Fearon is
worried about? Is he afraid that
Appalachian whites may receive
an equal chance to be admitted
to darken his ivory tower view of
the woild?
Or are Fearon and those who
agree with him just upset that
certain groups may be given the
same basic opportunities that
they have?
