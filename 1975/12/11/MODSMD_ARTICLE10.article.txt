# ... and where to buy them
## 
### Jim Tranquada 
All records prices have gone up re
cently, due to, among other things, the
cost of the oil-derived vinyl. Rev. Charles
Boykin of Tallahasee, Fla., has just
burned more than $2000 worth of rock
records because of the "sensual beat" that
arouses sexual desires. Despite such oc
curences, however, records remain a
multi-million dollar business, and record
stores are appearing in increasing num
bers.
Although the mid-Peninsula has no es
tablishments as renowned as Rasputin's
or Leopolds Too of Berkeley, or Under
ground Records of San Jose, the discern
ing student can find equivalent values in
local stores.
All the locals will order a record if its
not presently in stock, and will replace
defectives, but there is often a wide diver
sity in price and selection between the
various stores, which are listed below.

9:30-5:30 Monday — Wednesday, Fri

Eighteen years in the same location,
Town and Country is a nearby music store
that sells records, among other things.
Their basic price is $4.99. with large sales
every week at $4.19; tapes (eight-track
and cassette) sell for $5.79. Their
rock selection is adequate, but their clas?
sical section is the best in the area. They
also have a small $1.99 bargain bin.

Banana Records Store No. 1 is limited
by its size, but still manages to maintain a
stock of more than 11,000 titles at a regu
lar price of $4.99, with something on sale
every week at prices ranging from $3.58
to $3.99. Tapes sell for $6.39, and when
on sale, at $4.99. Their classical selection
is good, but rock is their strong point —
they have a wide selection with many
older and obscure releases. If you ask for
something often enough, it will eventu
ally end up being ordered regularly.
There is a listening stock; and if you ask,
you might be able to hnar what it is you
want to buy.
