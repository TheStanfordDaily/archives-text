### 
French Connection II
Directed by John Frankenheimer
Trying to measure up to the quality of the
original is an impossible task, but Frank
enheimer has at least come close. Gene
Hackman once again turns in a stellar per
formance as the dogged Popeye Doyle,
now traveling to Marseilles to capture Frog
One, his nemesis, who instead captures
him and makes him a heroin addict. The first
half of the film is excruc atingly slow, as
Popeye battles the French police and is
forced to quit heroin cold turkey. The sec
ond half of the picture switches into high
gear and never lets up until the final
second.***
Let's Do It Again
Directed by Sidney Poitier
A sequel" bearing little resemblance to
Uptown Saturday Night, though both star
Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier. Trying to
raise money for their lodge, Cosby and
Poitier hypnotize a pipsqueak boxer (Jimmy

Walker) to make him a winner. Though
weak and hackneyed in spots, overall it is
funny and enjoyable.***
The Other Side Of The Moun
tain
Directed by Larry Peerce
The story of almost-Olympic skier Jill Kin
mont, who became paralyzed after a 1955
skiing accident, is irreparably damaged by
expressionless acting by Marilyn Hassett as
Kinmont, a soapy and maudlin narration,
and an equally poor script. Beau Bridges is
also lacking in talent as her boyfriend.*
Three Days Of The Condor
Directed by Sydney Pollack
Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway star in
this extremely timely CIA thriller, about an
employe who finds himself hunted by both
the public CIA and an internal organization
that has already slain his co-workers. While
it is not the most original spy thriller ever
produced, Redford as the man with no con

trol over his destiny (rather than as the
macho superman always in power) makes
this an interesting venture."*
Smile
Directed by Michael Ritchie
One of the three greatest films to be re
leased this year — also the quietest. Now in
a second-run, it is not to be missed. It is
social satire like Shampoo and Nashville,
but is far superior in its picture of contem
porary America as seen around a Young
American Miss Beauty Pageant. Bruce
Dern and Barbara Feldon star "**
Hearts Of The West
Directed by Howard Zieff
A superb and original story of Gower Gulch
of Hollywood in the 19305, with Jeff Bridges
as young writer who speaks in exceedingly
flowery prose. His associations with super
eccentric Hollywood and the pitfalls of suc
cess make for great entertainment. Excel
lent supporting roles by Alan Arkin, Andy
Griffith and Blythe Danner make this a
treat.""
Mahogany
Directed by Berry Gordy
The woman's picture of the '40s moder
nized, with Diana Ross terrific as the sec
retary who accidentally becomes a model
under the control of a psychotic Tony Per
kins. Also struggling through a stormy affair
with politician Billy Dee Williams, Ross ful
fills ttie talent evident in Lady Sings The
Blues
Rooster Cogburn
Directed by Stuart Millar
A tired re-hashing of the old African Queen
plot, with Katie Hepburn playing almost ex
actly the same role as she did with Bogart
She and John Wayne attempt to find the
criminals who killed her father and stole
some nitroglycerine, but it comes off as bor
ing and contrived. The sequel to True Grit. *
laws
Directed by Steven Spielberg
The most successful movie of all time
should not be dismissed as pure horror.
Beyond the excruciating suspense and gore
it is perhaps the best film to come out of
1975. The characterizations of Roy
Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw
and Lorraine Gary are excellent. In addition,
the cinematic effects of director Spielberg
are more stunning than any other film's in a
long time.****

flowery prose. His associations with super
eccentric Hollywood and the pitfalls of suc

Mahogany
Directed by Berry Gordy
The woman's picture of the '40s moder

with politician Billy Dee Williams, Ross ful

Rooster Cogburn

A tired re-hashing of the old African Queen
plot, with Katie Hepburn playing almost ex

She and John Wayne attempt to find the
criminals who killed her father and stole
some nitroglycerine, but it comes off as bor

Directed by Steven Spielberg
The most successful movie of all time
should not be dismissed as pure horror.
Beyond the excruciating suspense and gore
it is perhaps the best film to come out of
1975. The characterizations of Roy
Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, Robert Shaw
and Lorraine Gary are excellent. In addition,
the cinematic effects of director Spielberg
are more stunning than any other film's in a
long time.****
French Connection II
Directed by John Frankenheimer
Trying to measure up to the quality of the
original is an impossible task, but Frank
enheimer has at least come close. Gene
Hackman once again turns in a stellar per
formance as the dogged Popeye Doyle,
now traveling to Marseilles to capture Frog
One, his nemesis, who instead captures
him and makes him a heroin addict. The first
half of the film is excruc atingly slow, as
Popeye battles the French police and is
forced to quit heroin cold turkey. The sec
ond half of the picture switches into high
gear and never lets up until the final
second.***
Let's Do It Again
Directed by Sidney Poitier
A sequel" bearing little resemblance to
Uptown Saturday Night, though both star
Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier. Trying to
raise money for their lodge, Cosby and
Poitier hypnotize a pipsqueak boxer (Jimmy

Walker) to make him a winner. Though
weak and hackneyed in spots, overall it is
funny and enjoyable.***
The Other Side Of The Moun
tain
Directed by Larry Peerce
The story of almost-Olympic skier Jill Kin
mont, who became paralyzed after a 1955
skiing accident, is irreparably damaged by
expressionless acting by Marilyn Hassett as
Kinmont, a soapy and maudlin narration,
and an equally poor script. Beau Bridges is
also lacking in talent as her boyfriend.*
Three Days Of The Condor
Directed by Sydney Pollack
Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway star in
this extremely timely CIA thriller, about an
employe who finds himself hunted by both
the public CIA and an internal organization
that has already slain his co-workers. While
it is not the most original spy thriller ever
produced, Redford as the man with no con

trol over his destiny (rather than as the
macho superman always in power) makes
this an interesting venture."*
