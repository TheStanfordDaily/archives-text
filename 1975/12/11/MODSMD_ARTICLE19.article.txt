# Satyajit Ray — master of Indian films
## 
### Kautilya 
The world today is a shrinking
sphere. As technology progres
ses we realize how we truly be
long to one human family. But
because of our myopic national
feelings and selfish views of pat
riotism we fail to appreciate var
ious cultures from distant lands.
The best way— other than an
actual visit — of getting a
glimpse of the soul of a foreign
society is to view fine films made
there by sensitive artists.
Satyajit Ray of India is one
such filmmaker. His films of
Bengali peasants, like Ozu's
films of Japanese middle class
life, have the broadest and most
universal appeal: These are a
mine of information and insights
into the societies they portray.
Ray's is a towering presence —
physically and intellectually.
His enormous height and the
massively carved features seem
like sculpted dark marble from
the classical world. The English
he speaks was simply perfect
with no foreign inflection, and
his voice is beautifully pleasing
with a natural ease that is so rare.
Quintessential Indian
He has a spirit so essentially
Indian, a philosophy so uni
quely universal.
Ray comes from a disting
uished family of artists, writers
and innovators. Hence it is
natural that he writes inten
sively — novels, short stories,
science fiction. He is among the
most popular Bengali authors
today.
The bulk of bis writing is for
youngsters. He also illustrates
his books with the sure hand of a
born artist. But his first love is
the cinema. Pauline Kael once
remarked: "The simplicity of De
Sica at his best, of Renoir at his
greatest, is almost miraculously
present in every detail of Satyajit
Ray's films."
'Freest' director
Today it is Ray's boast that he
is"the freest director in the
world." But it is with a touching

poignancy that he recalls futile
attempts to obtain financing for
his films when he was an un
known. or when a movie had
flopped.
The Apu Trilogy is considered
to be among the finest films of
the '50s . Yet, after the second
part, Aparajita, had been ill
received, there were no funds
available.
He then made The Music
Room based on a short story by
a leading novelist. "We set out to
make a typical Indian song

and-dance movie," he said.
There was very little money; the
working conditions were the
worst possible. The studio was
ill-equipped. A crane was
needed but not available.
Classic works
However, he had a very fine art
director and a superb camera
man. The lead role was played
by an immensely popular
character actor. Ray mentions
with obvious pride how the
movie has stored for posterity
some of the finest classical
music of India performed by ar
tists who have since acquired in
ternational fame.
Sudden stars
Ray has always been perfect at
casting the various characters,
many of whom are non
professionals. When he needs a
face he looks for it all over:
whether in stock companies, or
on street corners. Most of the
time he directs his players with
consummate skill.
Regarding his own films, the
Trilogy apart ("those films are to
special"), Ray said he likes
Charulata and Days and Nights
in the Forest.
When asked about any possi
ble influence of Ingmar
Bergman's Smiles of a Summer

Night on some scenes in
Charulata, he professed a deep
admiration for Bergman but
stated that there are lonely wives
in every country, and his own
images are drawn directly from
Tagore.
This is untrue. Although
Chcirulatu is a fine film in
geneal, it is not quite The Broken
Nest of Tagore. In fact, Ray has
often said that the movie, though
based on the short story, is pretty
much his own creation.
In the last few years, through
his books and films. Ray has
shown us how important a role

the absurd, the fantastic, the
simple and the child-like play in
life. He does not tempt us to es
cape reality. As in his latest film,
The Golden Fortress, he leads us
from an adult environment of
ever-growing confusion and de
spair into the golden world of
childhood where Hobbits play
jovously and the Little Princes
reign with responsibility and
love.
Ray is a master, but not neces
sarily beyond criticism. The
supreme artist achieves the max
imum effect through the barest
of means.
