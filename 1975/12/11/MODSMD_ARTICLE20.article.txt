# Kinks' music still fresh in 20th album

### Randy Baker 
Kinks, Schoolboys In Dis
grace (RCA LPS 1-5102)

Schoolboys In Disgrace is the
20th album released by the
Kinks in America, an amazing
milestone by any standards,
Even of greater significance,
Schoolboys In Disgrace
represents another important
change in the Kinks' sound.
The Kinks have never re
mained musically stagnant.
From their early days as hard
rockers, through their middle
period of soft introspective rock,
and their recent string of rock
operas, their sound has always
changed from album to album,
sometimes quite drastically.
Their recent music has fea
tured less emphasis on melody
and move emphasis on melod
rama, with storytelling lyrics
being of central importance.
With last spring's Soap Opera,
the Kinks have started to put

greater emphasis on melody.
Schoolboys continues this trend,
while adding a new emphasis on
the Kinks' instrumental sound.
It represents the return of Dave
Davies' lead guitar as a promi
nent part of the Kinks' sound.
The first side of Schoolboys is
a nostalgic look back at high
school, with much of the music
in an appropriate '50s vein.
"Schooldays," the sentimental
opener, features one of Ray
Davies' most wistful vocals ever
and some classic harmonies by
brother Dave. A raucous rocker
about "Jack The Idiot Dunce" is
followed by the absurd seven
minute epic "Education."
It starts out sounding a lot like
a Randy Neuman song, before
beautifully building into a seg
ment of klassic Kinks' rock,
which disolves into a soft seg
ment where Davies sings,
"Teacher, teach me about nuc
lear physics, and teach me about

the structure of man. but all
your endless calculations can't
tell my why I am."
At this point, Dave Davies
breaks loose on his guitar and
things build to a grand finale in
which Ray reminds us that
"everybody needs education —
every nationality, eskimos and
pigmies, and even aborigines."
Side one is closed by "The First
Time We Fall In Love," a super
bly crafted song with great
lyrics, great harmonies and some
nice melodic changes.
Side two of Schoolboys is an

attempt to trace the transforma
tion of the main character, Flash,
from a merely naughty school
boy into the evil villain we see in
Preservation (the Kinks' three
record opera of last year).
"Headmaster," a moving and
majestic song wherein Flash
apologizes for the wrongdoings
revealed in "I'm In Disgrace,"
features an extended guitar
break which does not sound
even remotely similar to any
thing else the Kinks have ever
done.

Most groups might be content
to rest on past laurels upon
reaching their 20th album, but
not the Kinks. Part of the reason
for this might be their lack of
mass acceptance. The Kinks
have always had to work and
struggle just to stay alive.
Schoolboys In Disgrace can
proudly take its place among the
rest of these works. It's late 1975,
almost 12 years since "You've
Really Got Me" first hit the air
waves, but the Kinks are still
very much alive.

Schoolboys In Disgrace
represents another important
change in the Kinks' sound.
The Kinks have never re
mained musically stagnant.
From their early days as hard
rockers, through their middle
period of soft introspective rock,
and their recent string of rock
operas, their sound has always
changed from album to album,
sometimes quite drastically.
Their recent music has fea
tured less emphasis on melody
and move emphasis on melod
rama, with storytelling lyrics
being of central importance.
With last spring's Soap Opera,
the Kinks have started to put

greater emphasis on melody.
Schoolboys continues this trend,
while adding a new emphasis on
the Kinks' instrumental sound.
It represents the return of Dave
Davies' lead guitar as a promi
nent part of the Kinks' sound.
The first side of Schoolboys is
a nostalgic look back at high
school, with much of the music
in an appropriate '50s vein.
"Schooldays," the sentimental
opener, features one of Ray
Davies' most wistful vocals ever
and some classic harmonies by
brother Dave. A raucous rocker
about "Jack The Idiot Dunce" is
followed by the absurd seven
minute epic "Education."
It starts out sounding a lot like
a Randy Neuman song, before
beautifully building into a seg
ment of klassic Kinks' rock,
which disolves into a soft seg
ment where Davies sings,
"Teacher, teach me about nuc
lear physics, and teach me about

the structure of man. but all
your endless calculations can't
tell my why I am."
At this point, Dave Davies
breaks loose on his guitar and
things build to a grand finale in
which Ray reminds us that
"everybody needs education —
every nationality, eskimos and
pigmies, and even aborigines."
Side one is closed by "The First
Time We Fall In Love," a super
bly crafted song with great
lyrics, great harmonies and some
nice melodic changes.
Side two of Schoolboys is an

attempt to trace the transforma
tion of the main character, Flash,
from a merely naughty school
boy into the evil villain we see in
Preservation (the Kinks' three
record opera of last year).
"Headmaster," a moving and
majestic song wherein Flash
apologizes for the wrongdoings
revealed in "I'm In Disgrace,"
features an extended guitar
break which does not sound
even remotely similar to any
thing else the Kinks have ever
done.

Most groups might be content
to rest on past laurels upon
reaching their 20th album, but
not the Kinks. Part of the reason
for this might be their lack of
mass acceptance. The Kinks
have always had to work and
struggle just to stay alive.
Schoolboys In Disgrace can
proudly take its place among the
rest of these works. It's late 1975,
almost 12 years since "You've
Really Got Me" first hit the air
waves, but the Kinks are still
very much alive.
