# Bring on the 'Dames'
## 
### David Miller 
The Palo Alto Community
Players is presenting a musical
spoof from the '30s, Domes nt
Sea, at the Community Center.
Theirs was the slickest, best
rehearsed and most delightfully
executed evening of musical en
tertainment in Bay Area com
munity theatre in a long time.
The musical, by George I laim
sohn. Robin Miller and Jim Wise,
contains all the mandatory
clichesof'2os and '30smusicals,
and then some. The plot con
cerns Ruby, a "girl next door"
from Centerville, who journeys
to New York and finds fame and
romance when she links her for
tunes to those of a struggling
theatre company.
.She meets Joan, the brassy
chorine with the heart of gold;
Joan's sometime lover Lucky;
Henessey, the choleric and
long-suffering producer
director; Mona, the self
infatuated star; and the man of
her dreams, Dick, a sailor
songwriter.
These predictable but delight
ful characters act in predictable
but delightful ways, dancing
and singing through musical
numbers of every type — show
stoppers, torch songs, ingenue
plaints, dance spectaculars,
Spanish and Far Eastern special
ties — while weaving romantic
triangles and uttering such time
less lines as "Broadway — I'll
lick you yet!" or "It's a million in
one chance — but it might
work!"
Vivacious cast
Director Doug Cruehl's cast
members have thrown them
selves into these characters and
situations with a verve and
abandon that is matched only by
the apparent meticulousness
with which have labored over
their performances.
Terri Beringer is outstanding
as the ingenue Ruby. She resists
her many chances to poke fun at

her character, playing Ruby with
a conviction and honesty that
make her devastatingly funny
beyond what any amount of
mugging could engender.
Her "Raining in My Heart"
number was a standout, with her
straight-faced rendition provid
ing a hilarious counterpoint to
an outrageous choreography
with see-through umbrellas.
Terri's singing and dancing
were also first-rate, making more
believable her ultimate rise to
stardom in the "Star Tar" finale.
Exudes energy
As Ruby's starry-eyed boy
friend Dick, Ray Napolitano
showed terrific energy and stage
presence. He was a lovable dope
down to his toes, his comedic
flair subsiding tactfully only
during his love scenes with
Ruby. His voice was strong and
pleasant, his dancing loose
limbed but precise.
Sheryl Abbott as Joan and
Steve Maniaci as Lucky faced the
tall order of playing comic re
liefs in an already laugh-packed
show, but were able to deliver.
They could dance up a storm,
and did, in "Choo Choo Honey
moon."
Randy Holiday, in the double
role of Captain and

direct or'producer Henessey,
played both parts with frenetic
flair. Diana Caperello was com
petent but suffered in compari
son with her fellow performers.
Particularly disappointing was
her vampy "That Mister Man of
Mine" number, which never
reached the heights which it can.
Good support
Gruehl, Musical Director Rick
Anderson, and Choreographer
MaryAlyce deserve praise for
whipping their cast into fighting
trim and keeping them that way.
Singing, dancing and acting all
showed incredible authority.
By and large he has
imbued his show with a stan
dard of professionalism which is
a real pleasure to see on a com
munity stage.
Alyce's choreography was
superb, leaving one wishing for
more, and for a chance to see the
cast reallv pushed to their limits
in that area. Costumes and sets
by Denise Kilbourne and John
Gunn were, like the rest of the
show, handsome and slick.

lick you yet!" or "It's a million in
one chance — but it might
work!"
Vivacious cast
Director Doug Cruehl's cast
members have thrown them
selves into these characters and
situations with a verve and
abandon that is matched only by
the apparent meticulousness
with which have labored over
their performances.
Terri Beringer is outstanding
as the ingenue Ruby. She resists
her many chances to poke fun at

her character, playing Ruby with
a conviction and honesty that
make her devastatingly funny
beyond what any amount of
mugging could engender.
Her "Raining in My Heart"
number was a standout, with her
straight-faced rendition provid
ing a hilarious counterpoint to
an outrageous choreography
with see-through umbrellas.
Terri's singing and dancing
were also first-rate, making more
believable her ultimate rise to
stardom in the "Star Tar" finale.
Exudes energy
As Ruby's starry-eyed boy
friend Dick, Ray Napolitano
showed terrific energy and stage
presence. He was a lovable dope
down to his toes, his comedic
flair subsiding tactfully only
during his love scenes with
Ruby. His voice was strong and
pleasant, his dancing loose
limbed but precise.
Sheryl Abbott as Joan and
Steve Maniaci as Lucky faced the
tall order of playing comic re
liefs in an already laugh-packed
show, but were able to deliver.
They could dance up a storm,
and did, in "Choo Choo Honey
moon."
Randy Holiday, in the double
role of Captain and

direct or'producer Henessey,
played both parts with frenetic
flair. Diana Caperello was com
petent but suffered in compari
son with her fellow performers.
Particularly disappointing was
her vampy "That Mister Man of
Mine" number, which never
reached the heights which it can.
Good support
Gruehl, Musical Director Rick
Anderson, and Choreographer
MaryAlyce deserve praise for
whipping their cast into fighting
trim and keeping them that way.
Singing, dancing and acting all
showed incredible authority.
By and large he has
imbued his show with a stan
dard of professionalism which is
a real pleasure to see on a com
munity stage.
Alyce's choreography was
superb, leaving one wishing for
more, and for a chance to see the
cast reallv pushed to their limits
in that area. Costumes and sets
by Denise Kilbourne and John
Gunn were, like the rest of the
show, handsome and slick.

They could dance up a storm,
and did, in "Choo Choo Honey
moon."
Randy Holiday, in the double
role of Captain and

direct or'producer Henessey,
played both parts with frenetic
flair. Diana Caperello was com
petent but suffered in compari
son with her fellow performers.
Particularly disappointing was
her vampy "That Mister Man of
Mine" number, which never
reached the heights which it can.
Good support
Gruehl, Musical Director Rick
Anderson, and Choreographer
MaryAlyce deserve praise for
whipping their cast into fighting
trim and keeping them that way.
Singing, dancing and acting all
showed incredible authority.
By and large he has
imbued his show with a stan
dard of professionalism which is
a real pleasure to see on a com
munity stage.
Alyce's choreography was
superb, leaving one wishing for
more, and for a chance to see the
cast reallv pushed to their limits
in that area. Costumes and sets
by Denise Kilbourne and John
Gunn were, like the rest of the
show, handsome and slick.
Domes of Seo will continue its
