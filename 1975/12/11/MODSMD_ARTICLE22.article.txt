# Symphony opening: a potpourri of music, dance, surprises
## 
### Thaddeus Carhart 
Seiji Ozawa opened the 64th
season of the San Francisco
Symphony on Dec. 3 with an un
conventional and imaginative
choice of program that shocked
many, delighted others, and left
all who heard it with a sense of
the remarkable range of offer
ings that figure in the repertoires
of contemporary American
composers.
Who but Ozawa could suc
cessfully have directed a major
symphony in an evening's offer
ing which included such dispar
ate elements as nude dancers, a
whiff of Broadway shows, a
world premiere incorporating
the amplified tape of a computer
track and the dance-hall joviality
of Scott Joplin's rags?
There were essentially two un
ifying themes to the varied fare.
First, all of the pieces played
(with the exception of the Joplin
encore) were written by contem
porary American composers; in
deed, all but Copland were in the
audience to receive the applause
of an appreciative gathering.
Thus, one was exposed to a fairly
representative sampling of
American orchestral idioms of
the mid-20th century.
Second, and perhaps more
important, this was an evening
of music for dance, a feature that
gave the program added interest
and cohesiveness, even though
only two of the works were actu
ally choreographed and per
formed.
Uneven performance
The first half of the program
featured the Erick Hawkins
Dance Company, a modern
dance group whose dramatic
force and technical brilliance
was unevenly divided between
the two pieces they danced.
Hawkins is one of the pat
riarchs of today's modern dance

world, a direct spiritual and
aesthetic descendant of the
reigning grande dome of that
world, Martha Graham. He
served as her principal male
dancer for nearly a dozen years,
until 1951, and the influence of
her philosophy and style upon
his work is nowhere more ap
parent than in the evening's first
work, Meditation on Orpheus.
Set to an agreeable but unin
spired 1958 score of Alan Hovh
aness, this dance was first pre
miered at Washington's Ken
nedy Center in 1974. It is a
highly stylized work, laden with
classical symbols in the manner
of Graham's Clytemnestra or
Electra, atmospheric rather than
literal in depicting the lover who
would cheat death in his search
for Euridice in the underworld.
Dancing sublime
Hawkins, dancing the title
role, maintained an intensity of
focus that riveted audience at
tention on the protagonist's
quest. Slowly, deliberately, he
made his way through a world
inhabited by a coterie of virginal
maidens, a symbol of idealized
youth, and a mysterious
shadow-imagecharacter dressed
all in black who impelled him to
his hopeless search and with
whom Hawkins danced a sub
lime duet sequence.
Unfortunately, the second
piece was less effective in creat
ing that special mood of theatri
cal intimacy upon which mod
ern dance so heavily depends. A
rendition of Virgil Thomson's
familiar Symphony No. 2 (1931),
Hawkins' version made its debut
this past summer. Regrettably,
one is hard put to escape the
conclusion that it is yet another
instance of cultural flotsam
hitched to the Bicentennial
bandwagon.
Thomson's score is un

abashedly that of the Midwes
terner he is, couched firmly in
the idiom of prairie hymns,
country waltzes, and general ex
uberance. Hawkins, himself a
native of Kansas City, has seized
upon the "down home" quality
of the tempi and some of the
melodies, but the result was
rather too facile, both in its con
ception and its realization.
Bring on Ozawa
Perhaps frustrated at playing
the first half of the program from
the shell at the back of the stage
(Ozawa conducted from the
side), the orchestra seemed glad
to be stage center as the second
half began.
The first piece to be performed
was the world premiere of a new
work by Stanford Prof. Loren
Rush.
The composition, entitled
Song and Dance, was especially
commissioned by the San Fran
cisco Symphony as part of a Na
tional Endowment for the Arts
project celebrating the Bicen
tennial.
After this San Francisco
debut, it will appear in the reper
tories of six other major Ameri
can symphony orchestras during
the current season (see accom
panying article).
Delightful Copland
The final item on the
evening's program was a piece of
cake, and the orchestra had it all
to itself. Aaron Copland's El
Salon Mexico was composed in
1934, and it is a showcase of this
favorite of American composers
at his most exuberant.
Surprise finale
As a final and totally unex
pected treat, a dozen members of
the orchestra marched out on
stage after the final curtain, took
their chairs, and proceeded to
play a bang-up version of some
of Scott Joplin's most popular
tunes, including Maple Leaf Hag
and The Entertainer.
The mere fact that so varied an
opening night could end on such
an informal and intimate note
speaks volumes for the unique
atmosphere cultivated by
Ozawa. As he begins his last sea
son as conductor and music di
rector of the San Francisco Sym
phony, we are acutely reminded
of how sorely he will be missed
in a city which prides itself on
the special position it fosters for
its symphony.

Salon Mexico was composed in
1934, and it is a showcase of this
favorite of American composers
at his most exuberant.
Surprise finale
As a final and totally unex
pected treat, a dozen members of
the orchestra marched out on
stage after the final curtain, took
their chairs, and proceeded to
play a bang-up version of some
of Scott Joplin's most popular
tunes, including Maple Leaf Hag
and The Entertainer.
The mere fact that so varied an
opening night could end on such
an informal and intimate note
speaks volumes for the unique
atmosphere cultivated by
Ozawa. As he begins his last sea
son as conductor and music di
rector of the San Francisco Sym
phony, we are acutely reminded
of how sorely he will be missed
in a city which prides itself on
the special position it fosters for
its symphony.
Seiji Ozawa opened the 64th
season of the San Francisco
Symphony on Dec. 3 with an un
conventional and imaginative
choice of program that shocked
many, delighted others, and left
all who heard it with a sense of
the remarkable range of offer
ings that figure in the repertoires
of contemporary American
composers.
Who but Ozawa could suc
cessfully have directed a major
symphony in an evening's offer
ing which included such dispar
ate elements as nude dancers, a
whiff of Broadway shows, a
world premiere incorporating
the amplified tape of a computer
track and the dance-hall joviality
of Scott Joplin's rags?
There were essentially two un
ifying themes to the varied fare.
First, all of the pieces played
(with the exception of the Joplin
encore) were written by contem
porary American composers; in
deed, all but Copland were in the
audience to receive the applause
of an appreciative gathering.
Thus, one was exposed to a fairly
representative sampling of
American orchestral idioms of
the mid-20th century.
Second, and perhaps more
important, this was an evening
of music for dance, a feature that
gave the program added interest
and cohesiveness, even though
only two of the works were actu
ally choreographed and per
formed.
Uneven performance
The first half of the program
featured the Erick Hawkins
Dance Company, a modern
dance group whose dramatic
force and technical brilliance
was unevenly divided between
the two pieces they danced.
Hawkins is one of the pat
riarchs of today's modern dance

world, a direct spiritual and
aesthetic descendant of the
reigning grande dome of that
world, Martha Graham. He
served as her principal male
dancer for nearly a dozen years,
until 1951, and the influence of
her philosophy and style upon
his work is nowhere more ap
parent than in the evening's first
work, Meditation on Orpheus.
Set to an agreeable but unin
spired 1958 score of Alan Hovh
aness, this dance was first pre
miered at Washington's Ken
nedy Center in 1974. It is a
highly stylized work, laden with
classical symbols in the manner
of Graham's Clytemnestra or
Electra, atmospheric rather than
literal in depicting the lover who
would cheat death in his search
for Euridice in the underworld.
Dancing sublime
Hawkins, dancing the title
role, maintained an intensity of
focus that riveted audience at
tention on the protagonist's
quest. Slowly, deliberately, he
made his way through a world
inhabited by a coterie of virginal
maidens, a symbol of idealized
youth, and a mysterious
shadow-imagecharacter dressed
all in black who impelled him to
his hopeless search and with
whom Hawkins danced a sub
lime duet sequence.
Unfortunately, the second
piece was less effective in creat
ing that special mood of theatri
cal intimacy upon which mod
ern dance so heavily depends. A
rendition of Virgil Thomson's
familiar Symphony No. 2 (1931),
Hawkins' version made its debut
this past summer. Regrettably,
one is hard put to escape the
conclusion that it is yet another
instance of cultural flotsam
hitched to the Bicentennial
bandwagon.
Thomson's score is un

abashedly that of the Midwes
terner he is, couched firmly in
the idiom of prairie hymns,
country waltzes, and general ex
uberance. Hawkins, himself a
native of Kansas City, has seized
upon the "down home" quality
of the tempi and some of the
melodies, but the result was
rather too facile, both in its con
ception and its realization.
Bring on Ozawa
Perhaps frustrated at playing
the first half of the program from
the shell at the back of the stage
(Ozawa conducted from the
side), the orchestra seemed glad
to be stage center as the second
half began.
The first piece to be performed
was the world premiere of a new
work by Stanford Prof. Loren
Rush.
The composition, entitled
Song and Dance, was especially
commissioned by the San Fran
cisco Symphony as part of a Na
tional Endowment for the Arts
project celebrating the Bicen
tennial.
After this San Francisco
debut, it will appear in the reper
tories of six other major Ameri
can symphony orchestras during
the current season (see accom
panying article).

the shell at the back of the stage
(Ozawa conducted from the
side), the orchestra seemed glad
to be stage center as the second
half began.
The first piece to be performed
was the world premiere of a new
work by Stanford Prof. Loren
Rush.
The composition, entitled
Song and Dance, was especially
commissioned by the San Fran
cisco Symphony as part of a Na
tional Endowment for the Arts
project celebrating the Bicen
tennial.
After this San Francisco
debut, it will appear in the reper
tories of six other major Ameri
can symphony orchestras during
the current season (see accom
panying article).
Delightful Copland
The final item on the
evening's program was a piece of
cake, and the orchestra had it all
to itself. Aaron Copland's El
Salon Mexico was composed in
1934, and it is a showcase of this
favorite of American composers
at his most exuberant.
Surprise finale
As a final and totally unex
pected treat, a dozen members of
the orchestra marched out on
stage after the final curtain, took
their chairs, and proceeded to
play a bang-up version of some
of Scott Joplin's most popular
tunes, including Maple Leaf Hag
and The Entertainer.
The mere fact that so varied an
opening night could end on such
an informal and intimate note
speaks volumes for the unique
atmosphere cultivated by
Ozawa. As he begins his last sea
son as conductor and music di
rector of the San Francisco Sym
phony, we are acutely reminded
of how sorely he will be missed
in a city which prides itself on
the special position it fosters for
its symphony.
Seiji Ozawa opened the 64th
season of the San Francisco
Symphony on Dec. 3 with an un
conventional and imaginative
choice of program that shocked
many, delighted others, and left
all who heard it with a sense of
the remarkable range of offer
ings that figure in the repertoires
of contemporary American
composers.
Who but Ozawa could suc
cessfully have directed a major
symphony in an evening's offer
ing which included such dispar
ate elements as nude dancers, a
whiff of Broadway shows, a
world premiere incorporating
the amplified tape of a computer
track and the dance-hall joviality
of Scott Joplin's rags?
There were essentially two un
ifying themes to the varied fare.
First, all of the pieces played
(with the exception of the Joplin
encore) were written by contem
porary American composers; in
deed, all but Copland were in the
audience to receive the applause
of an appreciative gathering.
Thus, one was exposed to a fairly
representative sampling of
American orchestral idioms of
the mid-20th century.
Second, and perhaps more
important, this was an evening
of music for dance, a feature that
gave the program added interest
and cohesiveness, even though
only two of the works were actu
ally choreographed and per
formed.
Uneven performance
The first half of the program
featured the Erick Hawkins
Dance Company, a modern
dance group whose dramatic
force and technical brilliance
was unevenly divided between
the two pieces they danced.
Hawkins is one of the pat
riarchs of today's modern dance

world, a direct spiritual and
aesthetic descendant of the
reigning grande dome of that
world, Martha Graham. He
served as her principal male
dancer for nearly a dozen years,
until 1951, and the influence of
her philosophy and style upon
his work is nowhere more ap
parent than in the evening's first
work, Meditation on Orpheus.
Set to an agreeable but unin
spired 1958 score of Alan Hovh
aness, this dance was first pre
miered at Washington's Ken
nedy Center in 1974. It is a
highly stylized work, laden with
classical symbols in the manner
of Graham's Clytemnestra or
Electra, atmospheric rather than
literal in depicting the lover who
would cheat death in his search
for Euridice in the underworld.
Dancing sublime
Hawkins, dancing the title
role, maintained an intensity of
focus that riveted audience at
tention on the protagonist's
quest. Slowly, deliberately, he
made his way through a world
inhabited by a coterie of virginal
maidens, a symbol of idealized
youth, and a mysterious
shadow-imagecharacter dressed
all in black who impelled him to
his hopeless search and with
whom Hawkins danced a sub
lime duet sequence.
Unfortunately, the second
piece was less effective in creat
ing that special mood of theatri
cal intimacy upon which mod
ern dance so heavily depends. A
rendition of Virgil Thomson's
familiar Symphony No. 2 (1931),
Hawkins' version made its debut
this past summer. Regrettably,
one is hard put to escape the
conclusion that it is yet another
instance of cultural flotsam
hitched to the Bicentennial
bandwagon.
Thomson's score is un

abashedly that of the Midwes
terner he is, couched firmly in
the idiom of prairie hymns,
country waltzes, and general ex
uberance. Hawkins, himself a
native of Kansas City, has seized
upon the "down home" quality
of the tempi and some of the
melodies, but the result was
rather too facile, both in its con
ception and its realization.
