# Stanford prof plays musical computers

### Thaddeus Carhart 
Loren Rush, co-director of
Stanford's Center for Computer
Research in Music and Acous
tics, was in the audience when
thi! San Francisco Smyphony
premiered his latest work on
opening night.
Called Song and Dance, the
piece is divided into two parts of

equal duration but of unbal
anced musical quality. The first
part, called Softly, as in a Morn
ins Sunrise, is described by tin:
composer as "pastoral", while
the second half, A Little Travel
ing Music, is characterized by
him as "exuberant motion."
Considered as a whole,
the work is decidedly uneven.

The first half consists of a con
tinual series of long, slow chords
sustained in icy dissonances.
There are slight variations in
pitch and tone quality as the
chords are drawn out and jux
taposed, as it one were overhear
ing the ponderous breathing of
some sleeping giant.
This section is highly sugges

tive of tho sort of lumbering
atonal contrasts that are
Schoenberg's hallmark and
whii.h, more recently, one has
come to associate with the work
of Messiaen and Ligeti.
At times the variety of tone
textures is startling, but after a
while it evinces that tedious and
cerebral quality which so fre
quently afflicts music that aban
dons melodic patterns without
sufficiently filling the gap with a
structure other than random
tone textures. Somehow, that
simply isn't enough.
The second movement, how
ever, is as rich and compelling a
piece of contemporary music as
has been heard in a good while.
The difference is primarily that
of a driving rhythmic sense
which lends form to the move
ment and creates a dramatic ten
sion that is dealt with and finally
resolved in terms of harmony
rather than dissonance.
For this second part, the or
chestral score is supplemented
by a four-channel tape of artifi
cial sounds synthesized from a
computer.
To this end, the orchestra was
flanked by a sound system that
would have done justice to Pink
Floyd. (Indeed, the visceral,
driving beat of this section
makes it ripe for exploitation by
some rock super-group as the
intro music to yet another over
engineered album.) The range of
musical textures and patterns

produced by the computer tape
must be heard to be believed.
Most pervasive is a persistent
metallic droning at regular in
tervals which recalls the rich
background provided by the
t(imbouru in South Indian
music.
Accompanying this rhythmic
"zonging," as of so many elec
tronic rubber bands, is a persis
tent tambourine-like rhythm
that suggests the matchless Gol
den Monkey chant of Indonesia.
Then, too, there is a
marvellous, metallic, percussive
sound that convinces the lis
tener he is entering Alberich's
forge in Wagner's Siegfried.
All the while the orchestra
plays a mgu-like score against
the tape producing a dark
middle-Eastern kind of sound as
varied in its acoustic array as is a
Persian rug in its visual pattern
of repetition.
Hopefully we can look for
ward to new works from Rush
and his colleagues in this same
vein, where the computer is exp
loited for its ability to synthesize
sounds previously unknown to
the human ear.
Surely this is to be preferred to
its use merely as a device for de
termining random chord ar
rangements or other such
schemes for furthering the al
ready excessive theoretical un
derpinning of contemporary
symphonic music.
