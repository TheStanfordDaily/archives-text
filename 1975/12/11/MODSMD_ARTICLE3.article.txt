# Nordic skiing: just not the same world
## 
### Charlie Hall 
For many, skiing has become
just too big. too crowded, and too
expensive. Well, take heart, for a
whole different world of skiing
exists that can take you from
swarming slopes to peaceful and
deserted back trai Is: cross-country
touring.
Touring, also known as Nordic
skiing, is skiing's version of the
back-to-nature movement, and it
has an appeal entirely different
from the quick thrills of a down
hill run.
"The people who are getting
into cross-country skiing are the
ones who want to get away from
the high prices and crowded con
ditions of downhill skiing," says
Mike Monserat of Sierra Design, a
store that specializes in cross
country ski equipment.
Cross-country enthusiasts view
touring as a chance to hike
through unexplored areas with

friends for days at a time, and they
share an almost fanatical zeal for
getting away from the crowds.
"It's an addictive sport." admits
IJC-Berkeley ski coach Bob
Woodward, who says that many
people, once hooked on their first
fix of touring, become obsessed
with discovering improved
equipment and techniques.
For the beginning skier, cross
country skills are easier to learn
than downhill techniques, ac
cording to Woodward. "I'm a firm
believer that a person can learn
Nordic skiing without formal in
struction." he says.
The most basic skill, the kick
and-glide, is well within the reach
of any able-bodied klutz. All it in
volves is pressing down one ski
into the snow with a kick and glid
ing on the other. When the gliding
ski slows to a halt, you just kick off
of it and onto the other.
In addition, the skier's arms
play a crucial role in the Nordic
skier's motion. You have to push
off with the pole opposite your
kicking foot. Master those techni
ques and you're on your way.
F'or ve of little faith who don't
believe that any writer's direc
tions are going to do the trick,
Complete Cross-Country Skiing
and Ski Touring by William Le
derer and Joe Pete Wilson pro
vides excellent instruction for be
ginners. Many instructors also
offer beginning courses.
Touring, in addition to having a
totally different technique from
downhill, requires its own unique
set of equipment, emphasizing
lightness. The biggest difference
lies in the skis. Cross-country skis
are narrower, much lighter, and
generally made of wood.
A good Nordic ski has two main
requirements, a flexible tip and a
stiff end. The flexible tip reduces
ski breakage and makes it easier to
ski smoothly over the inevitable
dips, whilethestiff end allows the
skier to waste a minimal amount

of energy in his kick motion."
Touring also requires a rela
tively light wardrobe. Woodward
scoffs at cross-country skiers
wearing clothes "which would be
comfortable sitting on the West
Ridge of Mt. Everest."
Nordic skiers expend tremend
ous reserves of energy — cross
country racers in the Olympics
burn more calories per hour than
marathon runners — and the
brave soul who starts his tour con
fidently decked out in a down jac
ket becomes an unfortunate
wretch within minutes.
Dress lightly
The trick, therefore, is to dress
lightly. Monserat says he once
skied at 11:30 p.m. without any
discomfort wearing only a pair of
sweatpants and a light jacket. He
adds, however, that a Nordic skier
shoidd bring extra clothing in a
pack to don at meal breaks and
other stops.
Two of the most important
items are nylon knickers and a
nylon windbreaker. Both are very
effective in shedding snow and
preventing chilly winds from
freezing the tail of an unsuspect
ing skier.
One of the beauties of cross
country touring is that a person is
never confined to skiing only
where chairlifts exist.
Places to explore
There are literally places
throughout all of California's
mountains for Nordic skiers to ex
plore. Yosemite is popular for its
beautiful scenery, although
Woodward notes that the quality
of snow is better up in Kirkwood
Meadows, near Carson Pass.
The further north a person goes,
the less crowded it gets. Wood
ward calls the Mt. Lassen area,
"the most undiscovered area in
Northern California."
A major financial commitment
isn't required to give Nordic ski
ing a try. Equipment rentals and
lessons are reasonable, so it's easy
to spend a few days with some
friends and get away to places that
most downhill skiers never even
knew existed.
