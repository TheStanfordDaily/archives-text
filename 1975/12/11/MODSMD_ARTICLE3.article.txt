# Nordic skiing: just not the same world
## 
### Charlie Hall 
For many, skiing has become
just too big. too crowded, and too
expensive. Well, take heart, for a
whole different world of skiing
exists that can take you from
swarming slopes to peaceful and
deserted back trai Is: cross-country
touring.
Touring, also known as Nordic
skiing, is skiing's version of the
back-to-nature movement, and it
has an appeal entirely different
from the quick thrills of a down
hill run.
"The people who are getting
into cross-country skiing are the
ones who want to get away from
the high prices and crowded con
ditions of downhill skiing," says
Mike Monserat of Sierra Design, a
store that specializes in cross
country ski equipment.
Cross-country enthusiasts view
touring as a chance to hike
through unexplored areas with

friends for days at a time, and they
share an almost fanatical zeal for
getting away from the crowds.
"It's an addictive sport." admits
IJC-Berkeley ski coach Bob
Woodward, who says that many
people, once hooked on their first
fix of touring, become obsessed
with discovering improved
equipment and techniques.
For the beginning skier, cross
country skills are easier to learn
than downhill techniques, ac
cording to Woodward. "I'm a firm
believer that a person can learn
Nordic skiing without formal in
struction." he says.
The most basic skill, the kick
and-glide, is well within the reach
of any able-bodied klutz. All it in
volves is pressing down one ski
into the snow with a kick and glid
ing on the other. When the gliding
ski slows to a halt, you just kick off
of it and onto the other.
