# Warning: the first time is agony

[•'or the beginning skier, over
confidence is an easy trap to fall
into. After all. just sliding down a
snowy hill on two thin boards
can't bo all that hard, right?
Wrong.
Practically everyone is able to
tell stories for hours about their
very first time out on the slopes —
the wipeouts on the ski lifts, the
unconquered hills, the aches and
pains of the aftermath.
Sophomore Gary Masatsugu
can tell you about his first time
skiing, last year at Badger Pass in
Yosemite National Park. Masat
sugu is from Hawaii, and hadn't
even laid eyes on snow before his
trip.
"At first I couldn't get started,
and then once I did. I couldn't
stop," lie says."I had to either
bump into someone or fall down."
Masatsugu had plenty of company
though; he made the wise move of
going in a group of mostly begin
ners.
Various thing happen on the
slopes which easily intimidate the
novice, not the least of which is
the number of pint-sized proteges
skiing the expert terrain like
Olympic champions.
"1 was waiting to go on the lift
for the intermediate slope," re
calls Masatsugu. "We were watch
ing everyone ski down when, all
of a sudden, one girl wiped out
really badly, flipping over and
landing on her back.
"The rescue squad came and
took her away on a stretcher, after
they splinted her broken leg. We
just stood there looking at each
other and thinking that this was
only the intermediate slope," he
reminisces.

Another sophomore also had
someembarrassing things happen
on his first ski trip. "I couldn't
seem to ride th(? Poma lift." he
says. "I'd get all set with my knees
bent and relaxed, and then the lift
would lurch me forward and I'd
wipe out in two seconds.
"It took me over forty tries to get
up the hill. The lift operator kept
getting madder and madder that
he had to hold up the line while I
tried to get out of the path of the
lift," he says.
Junior Mike Kositch, though,
had no amusing stories to relate.
"I didn't see anything funny at
all." he said. "I just hurt."
Hut practically everone who
tries skiing manages to achieve
something by the end of a full day
on the slopes, despite numerous
frustrations. That achievement
may be as little as learning some
elementary maneuverability, or it
could even be as much as actually
getting up to the top of the lift and
skiing all the way down without
breaking anything.
Masatsugu, for one, would be
willing to try it again, even though
he says,"I almost broke my neck
on the last run of the day, when I
was trying to do some turns."
There are various things a be
ginner can do to make his first (or,
for that matter, his second, third,
or even fourth)time out on the
slopes less painful and more en
joyable.
Generally, it's advisable to go
for more than one day. since peo
ple (yes. even first-timers) really
do improve if they ski continu
ously. Also, if the trip is only one
day, any advanced skiers in your
group will be more likely to go off
on their own and do some skiing,

instead of offering any assistance.
For that reason, it's also helpful
if you can share your embarrass
ment at first-effort fiascos by hav
ing other novices in your group.
Misery, not to mention frustra
tion, loves company, and it can
make you feel immensely better to
watch some of your friends fall
down a lot too.

However, if possible, have one
or two of the people in your group
be fairly advanced, if only to have
them give advice on selecting ren
tal equipment and on technique.
Almost any skier will recom
mend that a beginner take lessons
.it first, to learn the rudiments of
snowplowing, turning etc. A little
bit of instruction (and. of course.

lots of practice) can go a long way.
Some ski resorts offer free begin
ner lessons, and practically all
have a beginner's slope with a free
rope tow.
It's possible for practically any
one to become a reasonably adept
skier, experts agree. Hut, as most
beginners will tell you, it just
never seems that wav the first day

DREAMS OF GLORY—An aeri.il somersault on your first time out? Not likely. Rare indeed is the skier
whose debut doesn't lead to the brink of disgrace.
