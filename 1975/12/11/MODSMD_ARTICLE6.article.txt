# Ski team seeks return to U.S. championships
## 
### 
Barring injuries, the Stanford
Ski Team has the horses to expect
an excellent racing season in
1976.
Last season's attendance at the
national championship meet is a
tough act to follow, but a full cast
of returnees and a group of prom
ising newcomers are just cause for
optimism on the part of coach
Skip Stritter.
"Nobody graduated from last
year's team, and we've got some
new people that should make us
even better," be comments.
In both men's and women's
events, the team has reason to look
forward to improved perfor
mances.
Stars return
Dave Herbert, Dave Horth and
Tom Hutton all return to lead the
men's alpine crew, which last year
scored better in the two alpine
events than any other in the
Pacific Coast Championships.
Herbert, then only a freshman,
grabbed that meet's Skimeister
award as the top all-around com
petitor. A winning performance in
the downhill and a good showing
in the jump keyed his effort.

Horth and Hutton are back for
their fourth and third years, re
spectively, on the team. Each has
always been one of Stanford's top
three alpine racers, in his years
of competition here, and each has
consistently placed in the top ten
in the league. Horth proved to be
the team's most consistent per
former in the NCAA Champion
ships last March in Purgatory,
Colo.
Mark Colville. the team's best
four-event man, according to
Stretter. will also be back for his
senior season. Phil Barnes, who
skied for the team two years ago
but went overseas last winter, is
also back.
The women's alpine team, says
Stritter, "will be really good this
year. Dee Gates and Lori Gibson,
the team's best two racers two
years ago are back after a year's
absence. In addition, Stritter ex
pects transfer student Alice Reed,
who was ineligible to compete last
year, to be better than both.
Finally, there's sophomore
Missy Taylor, who Stritter claims
"is better than almost all the men.
She might be the best skier we

have." A former Can-Am circuit
competitor, she skied well
enough to race for the men's var
sity last year. If she doesn't get a
job coaching, Stritter says she'll
anchor the women's squad.
"1 don't see how anybody in this
league is going to beat us in
women's alpine," states Stritter.
Nordic shaky
As usual, the Nordic events are
the team's biggest question mark.
Difficulties in training, lack of in
terest, and the competition of
scholarship foreign skiers at the
University of Nevada-Reno have
made the Cards vulnerable in the
Nordic events in the past.
If experience means anything,
however, Stanford may improve
over last year's efforts. Steve
Lindbeck and Ed Frank, along
with Colville, return from last
year's participation in the cross
country at the nationals.
Lindbeck is seeking a return to
his form of two years ago, when he
placed ninth in the Pacific Coast
Championships. Frank disting
uished himself with a notable
finishing sprint at the nationals
last year, and is back after an au
tumn training program. Colville
was the team's only placer in last
year's dismal cross-country show
ing. H. R. Nickersonand Kit Weld
are also returnees.
Oubain to shine
The most welcome member of
the Nordic squad, however, is
likely to be transfer student Don
Dubain. As a freshman at Berkeley
two years ago, Dubain placed
third in both the cross-country
and jumping events. "Dubain will
help a whole bunch," says Stritter.
"We've never been really strong in
Nordic, but we're looking much
better."
In the jumping event, Dubain
will join Herbert and Colville to
improve the team's chances.
A weak showing in the Nordic
events pievented the team from
winning the Pacific Coast Champ
ionships outright last year, but as
Stritter says, "Nordic is looking
better and better. And the Alpine
team has shown it can win in this
league."

tough act to follow, but a full cast
of returnees and a group of prom
ising newcomers are just cause for
optimism on the part of coach
Skip Stritter.
"Nobody graduated from last
year's team, and we've got some
new people that should make us
even better," be comments.
In both men's and women's
events, the team has reason to look
forward to improved perfor
mances.
Stars return
Dave Herbert, Dave Horth and
Tom Hutton all return to lead the
men's alpine crew, which last year
scored better in the two alpine
events than any other in the
Pacific Coast Championships.
Herbert, then only a freshman,
grabbed that meet's Skimeister
award as the top all-around com
petitor. A winning performance in
the downhill and a good showing
in the jump keyed his effort.

Horth and Hutton are back for
their fourth and third years, re
spectively, on the team. Each has
always been one of Stanford's top
three alpine racers, in his years
of competition here, and each has
consistently placed in the top ten
in the league. Horth proved to be
the team's most consistent per
former in the NCAA Champion
ships last March in Purgatory,
Colo.
Mark Colville. the team's best
four-event man, according to
Stretter. will also be back for his
senior season. Phil Barnes, who
skied for the team two years ago
but went overseas last winter, is
also back.
The women's alpine team, says
Stritter, "will be really good this
year. Dee Gates and Lori Gibson,
the team's best two racers two
years ago are back after a year's
absence. In addition, Stritter ex
pects transfer student Alice Reed,
who was ineligible to compete last
year, to be better than both.
Finally, there's sophomore
Missy Taylor, who Stritter claims
"is better than almost all the men.
She might be the best skier we

have." A former Can-Am circuit
competitor, she skied well
enough to race for the men's var
sity last year. If she doesn't get a
job coaching, Stritter says she'll
anchor the women's squad.
"1 don't see how anybody in this
league is going to beat us in
women's alpine," states Stritter.
Nordic shaky
As usual, the Nordic events are
the team's biggest question mark.
Difficulties in training, lack of in
terest, and the competition of
scholarship foreign skiers at the
University of Nevada-Reno have
made the Cards vulnerable in the
Nordic events in the past.
If experience means anything,
however, Stanford may improve
over last year's efforts. Steve
Lindbeck and Ed Frank, along
with Colville, return from last
year's participation in the cross
country at the nationals.
Lindbeck is seeking a return to
his form of two years ago, when he
placed ninth in the Pacific Coast
Championships. Frank disting
uished himself with a notable
finishing sprint at the nationals
last year, and is back after an au
tumn training program. Colville
was the team's only placer in last
year's dismal cross-country show
ing. H. R. Nickersonand Kit Weld
are also returnees.
Oubain to shine
The most welcome member of
the Nordic squad, however, is
likely to be transfer student Don
Dubain. As a freshman at Berkeley
two years ago, Dubain placed
third in both the cross-country
and jumping events. "Dubain will
help a whole bunch," says Stritter.
"We've never been really strong in
Nordic, but we're looking much
better."
In the jumping event, Dubain
will join Herbert and Colville to
improve the team's chances.
A weak showing in the Nordic
events pievented the team from
winning the Pacific Coast Champ
ionships outright last year, but as
Stritter says, "Nordic is looking
better and better. And the Alpine
team has shown it can win in this
league."

year's team, and we've got some
new people that should make us
even better," be comments.
In both men's and women's
events, the team has reason to look
forward to improved perfor
mances.
Stars return
Dave Herbert, Dave Horth and
Tom Hutton all return to lead the
men's alpine crew, which last year
scored better in the two alpine
events than any other in the
Pacific Coast Championships.
Herbert, then only a freshman,
grabbed that meet's Skimeister
award as the top all-around com
petitor. A winning performance in
the downhill and a good showing
in the jump keyed his effort.

Horth and Hutton are back for
their fourth and third years, re
spectively, on the team. Each has
always been one of Stanford's top
three alpine racers, in his years
of competition here, and each has
consistently placed in the top ten
in the league. Horth proved to be
the team's most consistent per
former in the NCAA Champion
ships last March in Purgatory,
Colo.
Mark Colville. the team's best
four-event man, according to
Stretter. will also be back for his
senior season. Phil Barnes, who
skied for the team two years ago
but went overseas last winter, is
also back.
The women's alpine team, says
Stritter, "will be really good this
year. Dee Gates and Lori Gibson,
the team's best two racers two
years ago are back after a year's
absence. In addition, Stritter ex
pects transfer student Alice Reed,
who was ineligible to compete last
year, to be better than both.
Finally, there's sophomore
Missy Taylor, who Stritter claims
"is better than almost all the men.
She might be the best skier we

have." A former Can-Am circuit
competitor, she skied well
enough to race for the men's var
sity last year. If she doesn't get a
job coaching, Stritter says she'll
anchor the women's squad.
"1 don't see how anybody in this
league is going to beat us in
women's alpine," states Stritter.
Nordic shaky
As usual, the Nordic events are
the team's biggest question mark.
Difficulties in training, lack of in
terest, and the competition of
scholarship foreign skiers at the
University of Nevada-Reno have
made the Cards vulnerable in the
Nordic events in the past.
If experience means anything,
however, Stanford may improve
over last year's efforts. Steve
Lindbeck and Ed Frank, along
with Colville, return from last
year's participation in the cross
country at the nationals.
Lindbeck is seeking a return to
his form of two years ago, when he
placed ninth in the Pacific Coast
Championships. Frank disting
uished himself with a notable
finishing sprint at the nationals
last year, and is back after an au
tumn training program. Colville
was the team's only placer in last
year's dismal cross-country show
ing. H. R. Nickersonand Kit Weld
are also returnees.
Oubain to shine
The most welcome member of
the Nordic squad, however, is
likely to be transfer student Don
Dubain. As a freshman at Berkeley
two years ago, Dubain placed
third in both the cross-country
and jumping events. "Dubain will
help a whole bunch," says Stritter.
"We've never been really strong in
Nordic, but we're looking much
better."
In the jumping event, Dubain
will join Herbert and Colville to
improve the team's chances.
A weak showing in the Nordic
events pievented the team from
winning the Pacific Coast Champ
ionships outright last year, but as
Stritter says, "Nordic is looking
better and better. And the Alpine
team has shown it can win in this
league."
