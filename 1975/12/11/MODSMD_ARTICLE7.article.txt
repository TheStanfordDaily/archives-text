## Serious skiers face obstacles 
### Steve Lindbeck 
For the serious recreational
skier, Stanford is an inconvenient
place to be. With the nearest ski
able mountains over 200 miles
and four hours away, distance,
expense and other time commit
ments conspire to make the sport a
difficult undertaking for Stanford
students.
For the serious racer, however,
the situation seems impossible.
Steady training, essential to de
velop the proper rhythm and
technique necessary for high
level alpine or Nordic competi
tion, is nearly out of the question.
By necessity, then, a racer at Stan
ford develops a comparatively
easy-going attitude.
Yet despite the difficulties, the
Stanford Ski Team has matured
into a thriving organization that is
earning recognition as one of the
West Coast's collegiate racing
leaders.
"Because of the nature of the
sport and Stanford's physical lo
cation. there's no way a person
can be a completely dedicated ski
racer and still go to Stanford,"
says fourth-year volunteer head
coach Skip Stritter. "What that
means is that we have a kind of
hang-loose, have-fun atmosphere.
But inside that, there's a few peo
ple who really are dedicated. They
train hard, ski hard, do well, and
could ski for any team.
"Most of the people who end up
on the varsity show more dedica
tion than they really need to," he
continues. "That's how the team
keeps going — momentum is pro
vided by that."
Last March, the team concluded
its best-ever season by earning a

spot in the NCAA Championship
Meet in Purgatory, Colo. They
soon found out that a school iso
lated from the snow, with little
money, no scholarships and dif
ficult admissions barriers has very
little business competing against
the likes of Colorado, Wyoming
or Vermont, each of which re
cruits overseas, has full-time
coaching staffs and sports com
paratively endless monetary re
serves.
As one woman from the Univer
sity of Vermont (which was ru
mored to have a $70,000 total
budget last season) candidly re
marked, "The first thing we do
when we get our budget is set
aside $7000 for our trip to the na
tionals — then we go to Norway to
recruit."
When Stanford went to the
event, though, it was at the skiers'
own expense: they borrowed a
van, piled in and drove all night
to get there.
Stanford in the nationals was
something like Slippery Rock
against Ohio State in football.
When it was all over, the Cards
were one of four teams that failed
to score, from a total of IH.
Undaunted, this year's team
seeks to improve upon last year's
second-place finish in the Pacific
Coast Championships and earn
another berth in the nationals.
Whether they can attend is
another matter, since this year's
event will be held in Maine.
Another difficulty is the presence
of the University of Nevada-Reno
team, a full-time program sup
ported by professional coaching
and recruited talent. Only one
