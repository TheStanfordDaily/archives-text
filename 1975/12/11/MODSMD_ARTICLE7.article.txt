## Serious skiers face obstacles 
### Steve Lindbeck 
For the serious recreational
skier, Stanford is an inconvenient
place to be. With the nearest ski
able mountains over 200 miles
and four hours away, distance,
expense and other time commit
ments conspire to make the sport a
difficult undertaking for Stanford
students.
For the serious racer, however,
the situation seems impossible.
Steady training, essential to de
velop the proper rhythm and
technique necessary for high
level alpine or Nordic competi
tion, is nearly out of the question.
By necessity, then, a racer at Stan
ford develops a comparatively
easy-going attitude.
Yet despite the difficulties, the
Stanford Ski Team has matured
into a thriving organization that is
earning recognition as one of the
West Coast's collegiate racing
leaders.
"Because of the nature of the
sport and Stanford's physical lo
cation. there's no way a person
can be a completely dedicated ski
racer and still go to Stanford,"
says fourth-year volunteer head
coach Skip Stritter. "What that
means is that we have a kind of
hang-loose, have-fun atmosphere.
But inside that, there's a few peo
ple who really are dedicated. They
train hard, ski hard, do well, and
could ski for any team.
"Most of the people who end up
on the varsity show more dedica
tion than they really need to," he
continues. "That's how the team
keeps going — momentum is pro
vided by that."
Last March, the team concluded
its best-ever season by earning a

spot in the NCAA Championship
Meet in Purgatory, Colo. They
soon found out that a school iso
lated from the snow, with little
money, no scholarships and dif
ficult admissions barriers has very
little business competing against
the likes of Colorado, Wyoming
or Vermont, each of which re
cruits overseas, has full-time
coaching staffs and sports com
paratively endless monetary re
serves.
As one woman from the Univer
sity of Vermont (which was ru
mored to have a $70,000 total
budget last season) candidly re
marked, "The first thing we do
when we get our budget is set
aside $7000 for our trip to the na
tionals — then we go to Norway to
recruit."
When Stanford went to the
event, though, it was at the skiers'
own expense: they borrowed a
van, piled in and drove all night
to get there.
Stanford in the nationals was
something like Slippery Rock
against Ohio State in football.
When it was all over, the Cards
were one of four teams that failed
to score, from a total of IH.
Undaunted, this year's team
seeks to improve upon last year's
second-place finish in the Pacific
Coast Championships and earn
another berth in the nationals.
Whether they can attend is
another matter, since this year's
event will be held in Maine.
Another difficulty is the presence
of the University of Nevada-Reno
team, a full-time program sup
ported by professional coaching
and recruited talent. Only one
team from the Pacific Coast Divi
sion will be eligible for this
season's nationals, so another
second-place performance won't
be good enough.
Besides the four-meet varsity
racing schedule, which involves
12 men and 12 women in each
meet, the team provides support
for other racing activities.
"Our main function is to take
people who are good skiers and

want to learn to race and help
them race," Stritter explains. The
main way is intercollegiate rac
ing, but the team also helps its
members compete in Far West Ski
Association amateur races, both
Alpine and Nordic. "So even if
you don't make the varsity team,
you still get to race as much as you
want," Stritter says.
A Christmas holiday training
camp will help racers hone their
talents with coaching and super
vision. The camp opens Dec. 28
and runs until Jan. 4 at Lake
Tahoe.
Races sponsored
The team also sponsors races.
On Jan. 10-11, the team will put on
two Far West slalom events,
primarily as a means of raising
money. It will also do the work for
the Pacific Coast Championship
slalom event.
The team's other activity is a Ski
Conditioning class conducted
each fall and winterquarterfor the
benefit of the general Stanford
community.
Club sports was one of the prog
rams the athletic department de
cided would lose funding in this
year's budget crisis. Hence the ski
team (along with hockey, lacrosse,
martial arts, and others) was wor
ried about finances this fall until
an unexpected bit of good fortune
aided all club sports. Pamela
Strathairn, assistant director of
athletics, found a surplus from
last year's women's programs and
offered $9500 to the club sports

program.
Even with its $2600 share of the
fund, the ski team is able to do no
more for its members financially
than provide lodging (the team
leases a cabin at North bake
Tahoe), some team training
equipment, and a lift-ticket dis
count at Slide Mountain. Skiers
must pay for their own food,
transportation, and individual
equipment. Coaches also are un
paid.
Stritter not bitter
Nonetheless, Stritter is not bit
ter about scant support by the ath
letic department. "It's not very
good, but it doesn't surprise me.
Skiing is not really appropriate for
Stanford. It's too far away and it
would cost a lot of money for the
support to be really good."
Stritter himself skied on the
Dartmouth team, an Eastern
power, as an undergraduate. He
also served as the head instructor
at Dartmouth's skiing instruction
program. Now a PhD candidate in
computer science. Stritter has
helped Stanford racers for the past
four years.
Stritter's coaching philosophy
fits the squad's personality. "My
attitude is really loose," he says in
his soft-spoken but authoritative
way. "If people want to do it, then
I'm there to help, but I'm not talk
ing them into things or coercing
them. Peope do it because they
want to do it — and it ends up
being much more fun that way."

For the serious racer, however,
the situation seems impossible.
Steady training, essential to de
velop the proper rhythm and
technique necessary for high
level alpine or Nordic competi
tion, is nearly out of the question.
By necessity, then, a racer at Stan
ford develops a comparatively
easy-going attitude.
Yet despite the difficulties, the
Stanford Ski Team has matured
into a thriving organization that is
earning recognition as one of the
West Coast's collegiate racing
leaders.
"Because of the nature of the
sport and Stanford's physical lo
cation. there's no way a person
can be a completely dedicated ski
racer and still go to Stanford,"
says fourth-year volunteer head
coach Skip Stritter. "What that
means is that we have a kind of
hang-loose, have-fun atmosphere.
But inside that, there's a few peo
ple who really are dedicated. They
train hard, ski hard, do well, and
could ski for any team.
"Most of the people who end up
on the varsity show more dedica
tion than they really need to," he
continues. "That's how the team
keeps going — momentum is pro
vided by that."
Last March, the team concluded
its best-ever season by earning a

spot in the NCAA Championship
Meet in Purgatory, Colo. They
soon found out that a school iso
lated from the snow, with little
money, no scholarships and dif
ficult admissions barriers has very
little business competing against
the likes of Colorado, Wyoming
or Vermont, each of which re
cruits overseas, has full-time
coaching staffs and sports com
paratively endless monetary re
serves.
As one woman from the Univer
sity of Vermont (which was ru
mored to have a $70,000 total
budget last season) candidly re
marked, "The first thing we do
when we get our budget is set
aside $7000 for our trip to the na
tionals — then we go to Norway to
recruit."
When Stanford went to the
event, though, it was at the skiers'
own expense: they borrowed a
van, piled in and drove all night
to get there.
Stanford in the nationals was
something like Slippery Rock
against Ohio State in football.
When it was all over, the Cards
were one of four teams that failed
to score, from a total of IH.
Undaunted, this year's team
seeks to improve upon last year's
second-place finish in the Pacific
Coast Championships and earn
another berth in the nationals.
Whether they can attend is
another matter, since this year's
event will be held in Maine.
Another difficulty is the presence
of the University of Nevada-Reno
team, a full-time program sup
ported by professional coaching
and recruited talent. Only one
team from the Pacific Coast Divi
sion will be eligible for this
season's nationals, so another
second-place performance won't
be good enough.
Besides the four-meet varsity
racing schedule, which involves
12 men and 12 women in each
meet, the team provides support
for other racing activities.
"Our main function is to take
people who are good skiers and

want to learn to race and help
them race," Stritter explains. The
main way is intercollegiate rac
ing, but the team also helps its
members compete in Far West Ski
Association amateur races, both
Alpine and Nordic. "So even if
you don't make the varsity team,
you still get to race as much as you
want," Stritter says.
A Christmas holiday training
camp will help racers hone their
talents with coaching and super
vision. The camp opens Dec. 28
and runs until Jan. 4 at Lake
Tahoe.
Races sponsored
The team also sponsors races.
On Jan. 10-11, the team will put on
two Far West slalom events,
primarily as a means of raising
money. It will also do the work for
the Pacific Coast Championship
slalom event.
The team's other activity is a Ski
Conditioning class conducted
each fall and winterquarterfor the
benefit of the general Stanford
community.
Club sports was one of the prog
rams the athletic department de
cided would lose funding in this
year's budget crisis. Hence the ski
team (along with hockey, lacrosse,
martial arts, and others) was wor
ried about finances this fall until
an unexpected bit of good fortune
aided all club sports. Pamela
Strathairn, assistant director of
athletics, found a surplus from
last year's women's programs and
offered $9500 to the club sports

program.
Even with its $2600 share of the
fund, the ski team is able to do no
more for its members financially
than provide lodging (the team
leases a cabin at North bake
Tahoe), some team training
equipment, and a lift-ticket dis
count at Slide Mountain. Skiers
must pay for their own food,
transportation, and individual
equipment. Coaches also are un
paid.
Stritter not bitter
Nonetheless, Stritter is not bit
ter about scant support by the ath
letic department. "It's not very
good, but it doesn't surprise me.
Skiing is not really appropriate for
Stanford. It's too far away and it
would cost a lot of money for the
support to be really good."
Stritter himself skied on the
Dartmouth team, an Eastern
power, as an undergraduate. He
also served as the head instructor
at Dartmouth's skiing instruction
program. Now a PhD candidate in
computer science. Stritter has
helped Stanford racers for the past
four years.
Stritter's coaching philosophy
fits the squad's personality. "My
attitude is really loose," he says in
his soft-spoken but authoritative
way. "If people want to do it, then
I'm there to help, but I'm not talk
ing them into things or coercing
them. Peope do it because they
want to do it — and it ends up
being much more fun that way."
For the serious recreational
skier, Stanford is an inconvenient
place to be. With the nearest ski
able mountains over 200 miles
and four hours away, distance,
expense and other time commit
ments conspire to make the sport a
difficult undertaking for Stanford
students.

the situation seems impossible.

Yet despite the difficulties, the
Stanford Ski Team has matured
into a thriving organization that is
earning recognition as one of the
West Coast's collegiate racing
leaders.
"Because of the nature of the
sport and Stanford's physical lo
cation. there's no way a person
can be a completely dedicated ski
racer and still go to Stanford,"
says fourth-year volunteer head
coach Skip Stritter. "What that
means is that we have a kind of
hang-loose, have-fun atmosphere.
But inside that, there's a few peo
ple who really are dedicated. They
train hard, ski hard, do well, and
could ski for any team.
"Most of the people who end up
on the varsity show more dedica
tion than they really need to," he
continues. "That's how the team
keeps going — momentum is pro
vided by that."
Last March, the team concluded
its best-ever season by earning a

spot in the NCAA Championship
Meet in Purgatory, Colo. They
soon found out that a school iso
lated from the snow, with little
money, no scholarships and dif
ficult admissions barriers has very
little business competing against
the likes of Colorado, Wyoming
or Vermont, each of which re
cruits overseas, has full-time
coaching staffs and sports com
paratively endless monetary re
serves.
As one woman from the Univer
sity of Vermont (which was ru
mored to have a $70,000 total
budget last season) candidly re
marked, "The first thing we do
when we get our budget is set
aside $7000 for our trip to the na
tionals — then we go to Norway to
recruit."
When Stanford went to the
event, though, it was at the skiers'
own expense: they borrowed a
van, piled in and drove all night
to get there.
Stanford in the nationals was
something like Slippery Rock
against Ohio State in football.
When it was all over, the Cards
were one of four teams that failed
to score, from a total of IH.
Undaunted, this year's team
seeks to improve upon last year's
second-place finish in the Pacific
Coast Championships and earn
another berth in the nationals.
Whether they can attend is
another matter, since this year's
event will be held in Maine.
Another difficulty is the presence
of the University of Nevada-Reno
team, a full-time program sup
ported by professional coaching
and recruited talent. Only one
team from the Pacific Coast Divi
sion will be eligible for this
season's nationals, so another
second-place performance won't
be good enough.
Besides the four-meet varsity
racing schedule, which involves
12 men and 12 women in each
meet, the team provides support
for other racing activities.
"Our main function is to take
people who are good skiers and

want to learn to race and help
them race," Stritter explains. The
main way is intercollegiate rac
ing, but the team also helps its
members compete in Far West Ski
Association amateur races, both
Alpine and Nordic. "So even if
you don't make the varsity team,
you still get to race as much as you
want," Stritter says.
A Christmas holiday training
camp will help racers hone their
talents with coaching and super
vision. The camp opens Dec. 28
and runs until Jan. 4 at Lake
Tahoe.
Races sponsored
The team also sponsors races.
On Jan. 10-11, the team will put on
two Far West slalom events,
primarily as a means of raising
money. It will also do the work for
the Pacific Coast Championship
slalom event.
The team's other activity is a Ski
Conditioning class conducted
each fall and winterquarterfor the
benefit of the general Stanford
community.
Club sports was one of the prog
rams the athletic department de
cided would lose funding in this
year's budget crisis. Hence the ski
team (along with hockey, lacrosse,
martial arts, and others) was wor
ried about finances this fall until
an unexpected bit of good fortune
aided all club sports. Pamela
Strathairn, assistant director of
athletics, found a surplus from
last year's women's programs and
offered $9500 to the club sports

program.
Even with its $2600 share of the
fund, the ski team is able to do no
more for its members financially
than provide lodging (the team
leases a cabin at North bake
Tahoe), some team training
equipment, and a lift-ticket dis
count at Slide Mountain. Skiers
must pay for their own food,
transportation, and individual
equipment. Coaches also are un
paid.
Stritter not bitter
Nonetheless, Stritter is not bit
ter about scant support by the ath
letic department. "It's not very
good, but it doesn't surprise me.
Skiing is not really appropriate for
Stanford. It's too far away and it
would cost a lot of money for the
support to be really good."
Stritter himself skied on the
Dartmouth team, an Eastern
power, as an undergraduate. He
also served as the head instructor
at Dartmouth's skiing instruction
program. Now a PhD candidate in
computer science. Stritter has
helped Stanford racers for the past
four years.
Stritter's coaching philosophy
fits the squad's personality. "My
attitude is really loose," he says in
his soft-spoken but authoritative
way. "If people want to do it, then
I'm there to help, but I'm not talk
ing them into things or coercing
them. Peope do it because they
want to do it — and it ends up
being much more fun that way."
For the serious recreational
skier, Stanford is an inconvenient
place to be. With the nearest ski
able mountains over 200 miles
and four hours away, distance,
expense and other time commit
ments conspire to make the sport a
difficult undertaking for Stanford
students.
For the serious racer, however,
the situation seems impossible.
Steady training, essential to de
velop the proper rhythm and
technique necessary for high
level alpine or Nordic competi
tion, is nearly out of the question.
By necessity, then, a racer at Stan
ford develops a comparatively
easy-going attitude.
