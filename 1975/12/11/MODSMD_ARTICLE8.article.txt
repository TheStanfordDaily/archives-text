# Club sponsors trips
## 
### 
The Ski Club is currently plan
ning another winter's worth of ac
tivities in the snow, according to
club president Mark Winkler.
The club, which has about 50
members, sponsors various trips
to the mountains each winter. The
trips sport prices cheaper than
those which can be obtained by
individual skiers because the
group is eligible for group rates.
Recently, 32 skiers traveled in
style to Park City. Utah, staying at
the local Hilton tor four days over
Thanksgiving before returning to
the bleak reality of Stanford stu
dent housing.
The Ski Club is sponsoring
fewer mountain trips than usual
this year, primarily because of the
short holiday. Winkler says. Last
year, the club organized a Christ

mas break trip to Aspen. Colorado.
This year, because of the short
break, the group is not sponsoring
any excursions.
There will be a number of
"Winter Carnivals" up at Tahoe
after the break, however. Two car
nivals are currently slated for
January and February. Winkler is
also working on plans for a possi
ble trip over spring break.
Club membership is not re
quired to take part in excursions
organized by the Ski Club. The
club does, however, offer $3.50
discounts on its carnivals to club
members. Membership is open to
any Stanford student with $5 and
the desire to join.
The club also organized a series
of ski films last quarter, and may
resume the series next quarter,
Winkler savs.
