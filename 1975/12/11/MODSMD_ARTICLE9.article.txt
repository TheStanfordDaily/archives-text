# Christmas guide: What records to buy
## 
### Harley Peyton 
Instead of buying model airplanes for
your brother or cheap perfume for your
sister, try some vinyl shopping. The fol
lowing list is means comprehen
sive, but merely should serve as a guide to
the bewildering mass of Christmas-time
releases and re-releases,
Happy browsing.
Patti Smith, Horses (Artista)
Patti Smith makes an impressive debut
with her idiosyncratic, brand of poetry
rock n' roll. Stylistic ghosts of Lou Reed,
Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger dart in and out
of the grooves, but Patti ultimately estab
lishes a bizarre ethos that is definitely her
own. Unfortunately, the manic humor she
exudes in performance is missing from
the disc, making it an unwise gift for the
manic-depressive in your house.
Bruce Springsteen, Born to Run
(Columbia)
So you've seen the buttons, ads,
Time/Newsweek covers and the hype. But
the music is real, lyric rock with an emo
tional and musical depth that's astound
ing. Springsteen's first raves weren't the
creation of Columbia PR men, they were
the epistles of the usually aloof rock
press. He's earned success — listen and
you'll hear why.
Gram Parsons, Grievous Angel
(Reprise)
The Eagles are Top 40 nowadays, the
Flying Burrito Brothers have reunited
and "country-rock" is definitely "in"
with music industry execs who wouldn't
touch it a few years back. It is fitting, then,
to go back to the man who is the closest
thing to a founder that the genre has.
Grievous Angel. Gram's last album, was
released in 1974 shortlyafterhisdeath.lt
is a beautiful LP, with a breadth of vision
that is seldom seen in the work of his
better-known contemporaries.

The Band, Northern Lights - Southern
Cross( Capitol)
It would be easy to recommend this
album simply on the merits of one song,
"It makes no Difference," a beautiful and
moving story of desperate love. But tliere
are seven other songs on Lights worth
mentioning, as The Band returns to re
cording original studio material. It their
last few albums haven't impressed, this
certainly will. The Band is simply one of
the best musical aggregations around,
they have created a musical idiom which
is totally their own — accept no imita
tions.
Jefferson Starship, Red Octopus
(Grunt)
When Dad raches for the well worn
copy of The Hollywood Strings puke out
Christmas Favorites, slide this on the
turntable: the definitive Xmas LP, featur
ing the Ronettes, the Crystals, Darlene
Love, Bob B. Soxx and The Blue Jeans and
Spector's famous "wall-of-sound" pro
duction. Difficult to find but it is re
released every so often and is priceless.
Neil Young, Zuma (Reprise)
Young has drastically altered his ar
tistic vision in the past three years and
many fickle admirers are incensed be
cause he refuses to continue singing
"After the Coldrush" in different keys.
Zumn continues his uncompromising
style first introduced in On the Beach. Its
raw, wasted and extremely personal aura
may be oppressive to some, but it com
mands one's attention and thought. Dif
ficult music, but certainly worth the ef
fort.
John Denver, Rocky Mountain Christ
mas (RCA)
Denver tackles the traditionals with
predictable results and the obvious ques
tion is why? Perhaps all that dope smok

ing has fried his brain or perhaps the in
credible amount of money he'll receive
for such a project entered into the plan
ning. Whatever the reasons, you're better
off singing "Silent Night" yourself.
Elton John, Rock of the Westies (MCA)
John's got a new band and they add a
few new licks to the basic Taupin-John
formula. Its been a few years since John
traded in forced profundity for glossy
teen fun and one begins to wish for the
former—at least it required a little atten
tion.
Randy Pie, Kitsch (Polydor)
Tasty funk laid over a solid jazz base is
not what one expects from a band whose
members hail from Germany but Randy
Pie fits the bill with ease and a good deal
of style. Kitsch is their second LP, and it
establishes them as an important new ad
dition to contemporary music (and there
is no one named Randy in the group).
Paul Simon, Still Crazy After All These
Years (Columbia)
Crazy like a fox, that is; Simon con
tinues to offer melodies and lyrics that
approach perfection. He once taught a
songwriting course at a New York col
lege, and as star pupil Melissa Manches
ter attests, he is a master of the craft. How
ever, the end result suffers at times from
this overly academic approach. Even the
intended gambles fall short; there is a res
training professionalism which pervades
Simon's music. Despite the short points,
Still Crazy is a worthwhile addition to the
shelf. When the bulk of Top 40 music is
offered through anemic formulas by
businessmen going through the motions,
an album which is basically creative,
however slick, is refreshing.
Joni Mitchell, Hissing of Summer
Lawns
Her first new material in almost two

years and it shows; while the album is
still very much within the boundaries set
down byCourt and Spark, she seems to be
trying to expand her music with in
creased improvisation and the results are
sometimes brilliant, sometimes lacking.
However, in a time when female vocalists
are receiving increased attention (witness
the emergence of Linda Ronstadt, Maria
Muldaur, etc.). she remains at the top,
still lyrically and musically compelling.
Sly Stone, High on You (Epic)
His last album was a universal disap
pointment and the general consensus was
that Sly's creative juices had been con
sumed by his excesses (a wedding at
Madison Square Garden being a minor
indulgence). But people never seem to
learn that Sly has never been predictable
in his excesses or his genius, and "High
on You" is delightful evidence of that
fact. The LP is rich in those characteristics
by which we identify him: political ex
hortations and love songs surrounded by
that special funk that has influenced
everyone from Miles Davis to The Ohio
Flayers. Another in a never-ending series
of creative comebacks for the master
dancer.
David Crosby/Graham Nash, Wind on
the Water (ABC)
This is perhaps the most impressive
post-CSNY splinter project to date, and
coming from Crosby-Nash it is a total sur
prise. Working together and solo, Crosby
and Nash have fallen far short of aesthetic
or popular success; they appeared to be
the weaker members of the disbanded
supergroup. Now one is forced to re
evaluate their worth, as Wind on The
Water is one of the year's out ' \nding ef
forts. Their music and politics have ma
tured greatly, and what was once trite in
thought and presentation is now eloquent
and moving. Crosby and Nash are now
offeringa good deal more than memories.
