# Reserved Bratz quarterbacks Cardinal offense

### JEFF TANJI 
Last month, while the quarterback controversy was still grab
bing headlines on the Farm, first-year Stanford basketball coach
Dick Dißiaso almost started one of his own.
"Mike Bratz will be our quarterback . . . er field general,'' Di-
Biaso told an amused Cardinal basketball press clinic. If the
former Notre Dame assistant had given the opening-night Maples'
crowd that same line, he might have received the standing ova
tion that the fans awarded the 6-foot-2 Bratz.
The junior letterman hit 15 of 25 field goals, almost all from the
outside, for 33 points in Stanford's first two contests and added 12
assists. His two consecutive steals against Nevada-Reno brought
him a standing ovation.
Bratz has given Stanford it's first outside shooter since Claude
Terry left the Farm. His 20-footers prompted one fan to remark,
"they ought to put a mark at the top of the key for him." That
would suit Bratz just fine. "The top of the key is definitely my
favorite spot on the floor," said Bratz. "If the situation and cir
cumstances are right, I'll take the shot."
Sets example
But his primary role is quarterbacking thecagers. "Being one of
the returning players, I'll try to be a leader by setting an example
for the younger players. I always try to keep a cool head on the
court and maintain control of the situation at all times," said
Bratz.
Dißiaso has brought more than a flashy wardrobe to Maples this
year. The new head coach has given it a Mac Court flair, but
without Oregon's dirty tactics. "It's a more exciting brand of ball
that we'll be playing this year," Bratz relates. "To control the
game, we'll be trying to make things happen on the court, diving
for loose balls, for example."
A popular image of Stanford jocks, is that all of them group
around the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, rolling beer kegs down the
driveway and punching holes in house walls. Bratz is a Delt. but
he doesn't fit the stereotype. "The only thing that bothers me, is
that a lot of students put down being an athlete and belonging to
the Delts. I feel that like in everything else, it's not fair to
stereotype people, because we are all individuals, right?
"Oh, and there's one more thing," he grins, "it would be nice to
have more dates. Stanford is one of the few schools where a girl
will tell you she can't go out because she has to study for a test —
and mean it."
Wasn't recruited
Bratz almost didn't come to the Farm. No college recruiter was
waiting on his doorstep when he graduated from Lompoc High
School. Bratz went to Allen Hancock JC in Santa Maria. "When no
one recruited me out of high school, my original intention was to
go to school and get a job," he paused, "fortunately, however, in
my freshman year my JC team made the California State Champ
ionships. Stanford recruited me at the end of the year."
He was named as the Cards' starter at guard, at the opening of
last season, only to be replaced by Mark Cilberg. Bratz still man
aged to start five games though, and he played in all of Stanford's
2fi games, averaging 4.9 points per contest. But that doesn't even
touch his average this season.
Brtaz is the Cards' leading scorer with a 15.3 scoring average.
And Stanford is 2-2 coming off a 12-day break for final exams.
"You know, this year the team feeling is stronger, but that's not
to say that we weren't a close team last year. It's just that it things
got rough last season we'd feed the ball to Kelley on the inside —
now each of us is more dependent on the group as a whole."
Newcomer
Unlike a few of the players he'll be competing against this
season, Bratz has not played basketball since the age of three.
"Baseball was my best sport through high school, and an injury
cut short what I had hoped to be a possible pro career." His eyes
looked down towards his right arm, as he flexed the joint at the
elbow. "We had a coach who persuaded me to take up basketball
seriously, so as late as my junior year in high school, I started
I playing every day."
