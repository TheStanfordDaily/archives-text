## Stanford seeks happy holiday 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Dick Dißiaso's Phase Two be
gins this weekend for his Stan
ford basketball team. "We think
of the season in three parts," said
Dißiaso.
"The first part was the pre
season and the opening four
games. The second part consists
of the six games during the holi
day season. The third part is the
Pacific Eight."
The highlight of the first phase
came two weeks ago against
USE, when Dißiaso junked his
fast-break offense for slow down
tactics. It almost worked. The
Cards had an early 12-0 lead over
the twelfth-ranked Dons before
they could figure out what was
happening.
2-2 record
USE came back to win a 49-44
contest, but not before a sell-out
Maples crowd had seen what
Stanford is capable of. In bet
ween the Cards' other loss to
Santa Clara, Stanford won two
contests including a 95-76 win
over Montana State for a 2-2
mark.
"We came through the first
part in pretty good shape. We
had good team efforts in all four
games, and I think we played
pretty well," said Dißiaso. In
their last game, before taking a
12-day break for final examina
tions, the Cards built up a 50-20
halftime lead over Montana
State and then coasted to a win.
"We played our best defensive
game of the season against a
zone defense, and we handled it
pretty well. Our shots were
going in early in the game, and
we kept up the tempo in the sec

ond half," added Dißiaso.
Stanford had better keep up
that tempo for the next two
weeks. Cal Poly invades Maples
tonight for the start of a three
game home stand with Min
nesota and St. Mary's to follow.
The Cards should open the
home stand with a win over
Pomona. The tallest player in the
Bronco lineup is 6-foot-H center
Mark Bernhard, who brings a 2.2
scoring average into the contest.
Pomona is paced by forward Jack
Gamulin and Joe Sills, averaging
20.4 and 22.4 points, respec
tively.
NCAA investigation
Minnesota, Stanford's Mon
day night opponent, has been
making news for its alleged
NCAA recruiting violations. It's
too bad. The Gophers have won
their first three games under new
coach Jim Dutcher.
Minnesota's leading scorer is
sophomore center Mike'
Thompson with a 26.7 average
and 15 rebounds per contest.
Thompson was a Miami High
School All-American in 1974.
Thompson and Gopher team
mate OsborneLockhard led their
high school team to a state title.
Thompson scored 29 points,
blocked eight shots and had 13
rebounds in the title clash.
Junior Guard Phil Saunders
chips in 17.7 per game from the
backcourt for Minnesota.
St. Mary's travels across the
Bay to renew its rivalry with
Stanford on Tuesday night. The
Cards have a 33-30 lead over the
Gaels and figure to add to the
margin.

Ralph "Rocket" Walker leads
St. Mary's which is 0-6 on the
year. The 6-3 guard jumps center
and leads the Moraga-based
school with a 20.0 scoring aver
age.
Stanford will take a short
Christmas break before flying to
Baton Rouge to face Louisiana
State. Last year the Cards opened
the season with a 92-80 win over
the once-great Tigers.
After sampling Bourbon
Street, the Cards journey to Mil
waukee for Marquette's Mil
waukee Tournament. If Stanford
can get by first round opponent
Wisconsin, it is almost assured
of meeting the second-ranked
Warriors in the tournament
championship game.
With the preseason fun and
games over, the Cards will get
down to the business of thePac-8
on Jan. 9 when Washington State
invades Maples.
Stanford has been picked to
finish seventh in the conference,
but by the time it unpacks the
Cards may be ready to prove the
pollsters wrong.

Stanford had better keep up
that tempo for the next two

tonight for the start of a three
game home stand with Min

The Cards should open the
home stand with a win over
Pomona. The tallest player in the
Bronco lineup is 6-foot-H center

NCAA investigation
Minnesota, Stanford's Mon
day night opponent, has been
making news for its alleged
NCAA recruiting violations. It's
too bad. The Gophers have won
their first three games under new

the season with a 92-80 win over

After sampling Bourbon

can get by first round opponent

With the preseason fun and
games over, the Cards will get

Coach Dick Dißiaso
Dick Dißiaso's Phase Two be
gins this weekend for his Stan
ford basketball team. "We think
of the season in three parts," said
Dißiaso.
"The first part was the pre
season and the opening four
games. The second part consists
of the six games during the holi
day season. The third part is the
Pacific Eight."
The highlight of the first phase
came two weeks ago against
USE, when Dißiaso junked his
fast-break offense for slow down
tactics. It almost worked. The
Cards had an early 12-0 lead over
the twelfth-ranked Dons before

happening.

USE came back to win a 49-44
contest, but not before a sell-out
Maples crowd had seen what
Stanford is capable of. In bet
ween the Cards' other loss to
Santa Clara, Stanford won two
contests including a 95-76 win
over Montana State for a 2-2
mark.
"We came through the first
part in pretty good shape. We

games, and I think we played

too bad. The Gophers have won
their first three games under new
coach Jim Dutcher.
Minnesota's leading scorer is
sophomore center Mike'
Thompson with a 26.7 average
and 15 rebounds per contest.
Thompson was a Miami High
School All-American in 1974.
Thompson and Gopher team
mate OsborneLockhard led their
high school team to a state title.
Thompson scored 29 points,
blocked eight shots and had 13
rebounds in the title clash.
Junior Guard Phil Saunders
chips in 17.7 per game from the
backcourt for Minnesota.
St. Mary's travels across the
Bay to renew its rivalry with
Stanford on Tuesday night. The
Cards have a 33-30 lead over the
Gaels and figure to add to the
margin.

Ralph "Rocket" Walker leads
St. Mary's which is 0-6 on the
year. The 6-3 guard jumps center
and leads the Moraga-based
school with a 20.0 scoring aver
age.
Stanford will take a short
Christmas break before flying to
Baton Rouge to face Louisiana
State. Last year the Cards opened
the season with a 92-80 win over
the once-great Tigers.
After sampling Bourbon
Street, the Cards journey to Mil
waukee for Marquette's Mil
waukee Tournament. If Stanford
can get by first round opponent
Wisconsin, it is almost assured
of meeting the second-ranked
Warriors in the tournament
championship game.
With the preseason fun and
games over, the Cards will get
down to the business of thePac-8
on Jan. 9 when Washington State
invades Maples.
Stanford has been picked to
finish seventh in the conference,
but by the time it unpacks the
Cards may be ready to prove the
pollsters wrong.
