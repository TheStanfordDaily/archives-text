# Meyers appointed Law School dean
## 
### TIM W. FERGUSON 
Charles Meyers, a specialist in real
property law and a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1962, has been
named dean of the Law School.
Both Meyers and other law school
faculty indicate that the choice reflects
a desire to undertake changes in the
inner workings of the school after
more than four years under former
dean Thomas Ehrlich. Ehrlich's ef
forts, largely aimed at outside fund
raising, culminated in the construc
tion of the school's six-month-old,
$11.9 million facility.
Ehrlich resigned, effective Jan. 1, to
become president of the Legal Services
Corp., a congressionally funded law
firm representing low-income clients.
Assoc. Dean Keith Mann is serving as
' acting dean until Meyers takes charge
in September.
"I really see my job as building the
school internally," Meyers said, citing
increased faculty size and a
strengthened interdisciplinary cur
riculum as areas of immediate con
cern.
'Law and . .
"I'd like to see more work in the
fields of 'law and . . .' — law and the
social sciences, law and economics,
law and the statistics of crime," he
continued. Joint seminars with
graduate students in other areas of the
University could accomplish this goal.
Meyers said.
Such courses, often utilizing "the
tremendous resources in other de
partments." would "require some
funding but not a major increment,"
Meyers said.
Thus they would not exacerbate
what Meyers sees as another area of
concern for the school: costs, and their
effect on tuition.
"I think that rising tuition in private
law schools, and ours in particular, is
an important problem," he said.
Law School students will begin pay
ing a four to seven percent tuition sur
charge next year to help the school
compensate for a cut in its subsidy
from the University's general operat
ing funds. This "differential" is in ad
dition to the regular $4275 Stanford
tuition.
Meyers cited fund raising for scho
larships as a goal during his tenure.
Fill vacancies
His immediate concern, he said,
would be to fill "several vacancies" on
the school's faculty for which "funds
have been allocated."
Meyers said that having "the finest
law plant in the United States" would
assist in recruitment of top-grade fa
culty.
The selection of Meyers as dean was
the result of a thorough process, said
Law Prof. Marc Franklin, who headed
the search committee.
"Meyers was recognized by the legal
world as the outstanding candidate for
a deanship," Franklin said. "It wasn't

just that he was from Stanford. Some
times it just turns out that the person
everyone else is looking for is in your
own backyard."
'Reinvigorate from within'
Although several outsiders were
considered for the post, Franklin said,
"we are seizing the opportunity to
reinvigorate from within."
In choosing Meyers, Stanfprd is re
placing an "outside-oriented" law
dean with one concerned about "the
inside aspects of curriculum and stu
dent educational policy," Franklin
added.
Meyers came to Stanford from Col
umbia University, along with
Franklin, and has achieved preemi
nence in the relatively new field of en
vironmental law.
"He came to it by a natural evolu
tion, because his expertise lies in real
property, particularly natural re
sources," FYanklin said.
Meyers, 50, previously taught at
Texas, Minnesota and Cornell, and has
acquired a reputation as a strict grader.
He is past president of the Association'
of American I.aw Schools.
He will depart soon for a previously
scheduled sabbatical leave in southern
France, and plans to return to the cam
pus in mid-July.

MOVING ON UP—Law School Prof. Charles Meyers, a faculty member since
1962, has been selected to replace outgoing Law School Dean Paul Ehrlich.
Other faculty members say Meyers' selection will signal changes in the inter
nal workings of the school.
Charles Meyers, a specialist in real
property law and a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1962, has been
named dean of the Law School.
Both Meyers and other law school
faculty indicate that the choice reflects
a desire to undertake changes in the
inner workings of the school after
more than four years under former
dean Thomas Ehrlich. Ehrlich's ef
forts, largely aimed at outside fund
raising, culminated in the construc
tion of the school's six-month-old,
$11.9 million facility.
Ehrlich resigned, effective Jan. 1, to
become president of the Legal Services
Corp., a congressionally funded law
firm representing low-income clients.
Assoc. Dean Keith Mann is serving as
' acting dean until Meyers takes charge
in September.
"I really see my job as building the
school internally," Meyers said, citing
increased faculty size and a
strengthened interdisciplinary cur
riculum as areas of immediate con
cern.
'Law and . .
"I'd like to see more work in the
fields of 'law and . . .' — law and the
social sciences, law and economics,
law and the statistics of crime," he
continued. Joint seminars with
graduate students in other areas of the
University could accomplish this goal.
Meyers said.
Such courses, often utilizing "the
tremendous resources in other de
partments." would "require some
funding but not a major increment,"
Meyers said.
Thus they would not exacerbate
what Meyers sees as another area of
concern for the school: costs, and their
effect on tuition.
"I think that rising tuition in private
law schools, and ours in particular, is
an important problem," he said.
Law School students will begin pay
ing a four to seven percent tuition sur
charge next year to help the school
compensate for a cut in its subsidy
from the University's general operat
ing funds. This "differential" is in ad
dition to the regular $4275 Stanford
tuition.
Meyers cited fund raising for scho
larships as a goal during his tenure.
Fill vacancies
His immediate concern, he said,
would be to fill "several vacancies" on
the school's faculty for which "funds
have been allocated."
Meyers said that having "the finest
law plant in the United States" would
assist in recruitment of top-grade fa
culty.
The selection of Meyers as dean was
the result of a thorough process, said
Law Prof. Marc Franklin, who headed
the search committee.
"Meyers was recognized by the legal
world as the outstanding candidate for
a deanship," Franklin said. "It wasn't

just that he was from Stanford. Some
times it just turns out that the person
everyone else is looking for is in your
own backyard."
'Reinvigorate from within'
Although several outsiders were
considered for the post, Franklin said,
"we are seizing the opportunity to
reinvigorate from within."
In choosing Meyers, Stanfprd is re
placing an "outside-oriented" law
dean with one concerned about "the
inside aspects of curriculum and stu
dent educational policy," Franklin
added.
Meyers came to Stanford from Col
umbia University, along with
Franklin, and has achieved preemi
nence in the relatively new field of en
vironmental law.
"He came to it by a natural evolu
tion, because his expertise lies in real
property, particularly natural re
sources," FYanklin said.
Meyers, 50, previously taught at
Texas, Minnesota and Cornell, and has
acquired a reputation as a strict grader.
He is past president of the Association'
of American I.aw Schools.
He will depart soon for a previously
scheduled sabbatical leave in southern
France, and plans to return to the cam
pus in mid-July.
