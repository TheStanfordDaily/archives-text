# ARLO's funding

George Anders' Dec. 5 Daily
article on the Action Research ;
Liaison Office (ARLO) is mis-?
leading on two important points.!
First, ARLO does not
nate student research programs
for companies in the public sec
tor." as Anders wrote. ARLO
projects are sponsored by volun
tary community action organiza
tions and social service agen
cies.
All projects are strictly not
for-profit. To illustrate, ARLO
projects have resulted in:
—design and construction of a
playground for the Nairobi!
School in East Palo Alto;
—preservation of a wilderness
area in the Los Altos Hills; and
—improved decision criteria for
pretrial, no-bail release for crim
inal defendants in San Mateo
County.
Second, Anders suggests that
ARLO is overfunded: "ARLO
has now received a total of
$15,000 this quarter, counting
this latest donation. If funding
continues at this rate, ARLO will{
receive more money for the year
than its present budget re- 1
quires."
And: "If little expansion, is
planned, ARLO co-directorsßill
Leland and Edith Eddy say they
will 'present our situation to
donors. It's deceptive not to give
them information about how we
stand and end up building up
our kitty.' "
ARLO is not a business with a
consistent income. Since the,,
program depends on voluntary{
contributions, fundraising is a
struggle and support is unpre-'
dictable.
During the many months of
negotiations that resulted in this
term's gifts (for Dec. 1974 —
Aug. 1975), ARLO received only
$3200.
The Hancock Foundation's
generous grant releases ARLO
from a fundraising emergency.
(Anders correctly noted that
without this gift ARLO's treas
ury would have been exhausted,
in January.)
It guarantees that the program
will be viable for six months. We
must seek additional funds td;
complete this program year and
enter the next.
The ARLO Policy Board is>
considering expanding the
program next year in response to
rapidly increasing involvement
in action research projects by:
students, faculty and commun
ity organizations. A decision to
expand would mean intensify
ing our search for funds.
Since ARLO began under
ASSU sponsorship in late 1973,
numerous projects have pro
duced educational benefits for
students and research products
of demonstrable value to the
public. We're encouraged by this
record, and we're confident that
means will be found to continue
the program.
(Jamie Newton is chairperson of
the ARLO Policy Board.)
