Regrets admission
Editor:
As a freshman, I was deeply
depressed by the fine Dec. 4-5
Daily column by Michael Kies
chnick, et al., entitled "Meritoc
racy or open admissions."
It seems that the sole reason I
was admitted to Stanford was to
perpetuate the white
industrial -bourgeosie-ru ling
class, that my only intellectual
attribute is an ability to assimi
late ruling-class propaganda and
that my only purpose here is to
glorify the "barbaric" oligarchy
of the rich.
Tears came to my eyes.
My SAT scores seemed but
glitter, my grade point average a
sham, all my study but useless
drudgery. How could I compare
myself with that idol of all true
intellects, the downtrodden
minority?
Why. I never faced culturally
biased testing! I didn't even have
to struggle against socio
economic prejudice! My creative
instincts were never tested by
bourgeois suppression!
How could I ever consider my
self worthy of a true university?
Good God — it suddenly hit me
— all through high school I
never participated in significant
protest!
My mind reeled as my former
notions were put to the axe by
the profound words of Kies
chnick, et al. Obviously the pur
pose, of the University is not to
cultivate and sublimate know
ledge, but to spread it thinly and
equitably among the masses.
Obviously the University

should not seek intelligent or
highly motivated students but
those with "a broad cultural
background." How could I ever
be so foolish as to think the Uni
versity had any purpose but pro
letariat education!
To think, I came to Stanford to
mix with the best minds of the
country when 1 could have gone
to my state college and rubbed
shoulders with real, honest-to-
God Americans!
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon, how you did err in bring
ing this middle-class wastrel to
your university?

Blankenhorn's
qualifications
Editor:
On Dec. 5, the Daily printed a
letter that contained a great deal
of misinformation about my
qualifications as a martial artist.
To set the record straight. I
would like to briefly state my
qualifications and credentials.
They include the following:
—fourth degree black-belt in
karate, awarded by the Zen
Budokai
—second degree black-belt in
ju-jitsu, awarded by the Zen
Budokai
—second degree black-belt in
aiki-jitsu, awarded by the Zen
Budokai
—first degree black-belt in
judo, awarded by the Kodokan
—first degree black-belt in
judo, awarded by the United

States Judo Federation
—second degree black-belt in
karate, awarded by the
Kyokushinkai-kan
—one of the United States
teaching representatives of
Masutatsu Oyama, founder of
the Kyokushinkai-kan.
The Zen Budokai was founded
by Raymond Moore in 1939.
Members of the Zen Budokai are
ranked by a certification com
mittee consisting of highly re
spected martial artists (includ
ing Richard Kim).
Both Moore and Kim have
studied with very prominent
martial artists including
Nishiyama and Oyama. I also
trained under Nishiyama (in Los
Angeles) and was selected by
Oyama to attend his teacher
training program in Japan,
where I was also ranked by him.

Mass puerility
Editor:
The vote for the Robber
Baron as the Stanford team mas
cot is the most embarrassing
display of mass puerility by the
student body since 1 came to the
University three years ago.
Stanford students have a repu
tation for arrogance at many
other colleges in Northern
California. This proposed mas
cot would do nothing to dispel
that image, and the athletic de
partment's reluctance to em
brace the larcenous aristocrat as
its official symbol is under
standable.
The Sequoia, on the other

hand, is a stately perennial indi
genous to this part of California,
and it already exists as a Univer
sity symbol in the logo. Cer
tainly, it is a safe choice in a day
when it is difficult not to offend a
special interest group.
It also might put more fiber
into the football defensive unit.
Whether Indians, Cardinals,
Robber Barons, Sequoias or
others, by our indecision we are
making asses of ourselves in the
press.

Tree mascot unfair
Editor:
During the days of western
expansion, our forefathers were
uprooted by the white settlers.
We were forced to live on re
serves, sometimes carrying all
our possessions in a meager
trunk.
Leland Stanford even helped
destroy us when he built his rail
road. Carrying on with that das
tardly legacy, Stanford is trying
once again to exploit the seed of
the ones they oppressed before,
by using us as their school mas
cot.
We're not saps! We've been
out stumping to defeat the horri
ble misuse of our name and
proud heritage. We will not be
exploited!
Our organization, Turn down
that Ridiculous Ensignia (TRE),
and all the trees we speak (or
bark) for are opposed to our

namebeing used by Stanford asa,
mascot. We have branch chap-*
ters all over North America. I'
They're all rooting for us! We
also have support from the John
Birch Society.
We think this "plantist" men-},
tality stems from the chauvinis-*
tic attitude most humans hold
toward us. Vegetables are can-;
nibalized, flowers and shrubs
made slaves in gardens, and;
dirty jokes are cracked about?
fruits.
When will it end? Already".
Stanford blatantly oppresses us
with "Maples Pavillion" and!
"Palm Drive."
We may be going out on a limb
with this, but through our inves- >
tigations, we have found an in-;
sidious plot to thwart the anti--
tree-mascot forces. Many palms;
have been greased.
This won't nip things in thel
bud, though. We're too strong! *
Face it. The Stanford Trees or*
Stanford Sequoias is wrong. No!
countering arguments can'
spruce up that fact.
Choose something else as a;
mascot, knot us. Leaf us alone.
