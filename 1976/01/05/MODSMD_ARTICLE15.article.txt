## Rams Head: another Stanford tradition returns 'Interest and enthusiasm hold us together' 
### SALLY OURIEFF 
lEditors note: This is the first in a
three-part series exploring the
lise in student drama on cam
pus.)
A bit of Stanford tradition is
being unearthed this year.
Founded in 1911, the drama
group Rams Head died with the
production of Dracula in 1971.
Rams Head is now being rejuve
nated for the campus commun
ity.
Its rebirth began last January
in the minds of Jon Mills, present
technical director, and George
McMillan, group producer.
Their shared idea was to pool to
gether all the dramatic talent,
skill and enthusiasm scattered
throughout Stanford, and to
create a full-scale Broadway
musical.
Mills and McMillan reasoned
that quite a grand-slam produc
tion could emerge by tapping all
local resources such as, "a con
sortium of dorm drama groups,
Savoyard members, drama stu
dents and all the interested
graduates and undergraduates
we can find," McMillan says.
However, the Rams Head of
1970 is to be quite different from
the Rams Head of 1911. The or
ganization was first organized as
a rather elite, all-male honorary
drama group. A female counter
part was later formed, known as
the Ewes Head. The two groups
merged in the 1930s and until
1971 continued to produce mus
ical comedies and original,
one-act musical revues typically
called the "Big Game Gaities."
Broader appeal
The appeal is now for much
broader and more general stu
dent participation. The present
Rams Head is founded on a
"come one, come all" policy, ac
cording to McMillan. "We are
definitely striving for the most
professional production possi
ble," he says. "However, even
more important is that everyone
enjoys the experience and that it
is a spirited, enthusiastic
group."
Unlike other drama groups on

campus, the Rams Head would
rather have Stanford faculty and
staff members become involved
on a teaching level. Only
graduate and undergraduate
students and their spouses may
actively take part in the produc
tion. In this way, students may
learn some of the technical skills
that, as of now, are handled only
by the more professional mem
bers of the University.
The Rams Mead does not want
to create an isolated group of
only the most experienced and
most well-trained people,
McMillan says.
In the tradition of the Rams
Head, a Broadway hit has been
selected for the annual produc
tion. This spring, April 15-17,
Guvs and Dolls will be per
formed in Memorial Au
ditorium.
Large cast
Perhaps one of the major at
tractions of this musical is the
size of its cast. The production
will involve from 175 to 225
people, including a cast of 19
principles, 20 to 40 chorus
members and a 20-member
dance corp.
The story itself, although a
classic musical, is unknown to
many students. It takes place
during the 1940s and '50s in the
setting of a big city. The plot cen
ters around Nathan Detroit, the
down and out owner of a per
manent, floating crap game. In
need of money he lures a big
wheeling gambler. Sky Master
son, into an intriguing $1000
bet.
"With so many openings
needing to be filled, we are very
optimistic about the audition
turn-outs," McMillan notes.
The Rams Head is not offi
cially connected with the Uni
versity, McMillan says. How
ever, the $7500 it will take to
fund the musical has been ac
quired through the support of
various University departments
and offices. McMilJan adds that
"The administration and alumni
are really very supportive of us.
Everyone is psyched for the pro
duction, and we are receiving

help from several areas, includ
ing the Drama Department."
Debut preparation
The past 10 months have been
spent preparing for the spring
debut of Rams Head. The group
is now equipped with its own
office located in a vacant eating
club, where the members meet to
plan, discuss and create.
At this point the production
and direction staff is almost
complete, except for a much
needed choral director and vocal
coach.
Each graduate student or
graduating senior who is a
member of the Rams Head staff,
has a lower classman working
along with him or her. By train
ing students in this way, the
group plans to continue next
year and hopefully much longer.
"No one is paid in this group,"
says McMillan, "and only a few
student administrators are given
any academic credit. It is totally
voluntary. Interest and en
thusiasm is what holds us to
gether."

three-year absence, debuting with a production of 'Guys and
Dolls' this April.
