## Cards lose two in tourney 
### JOHN FREED 
MILWAUKEE, Wis.—Things
went from bad to worse for Stan
ford in last week's Milwauke
Classic holiday basketball tour
nament.
In recent years, the co-hosts of
this event, Marquette and Wis
consin, have invited teams
which stay on the court against
Wisconsin, but stand no chance
against Marquette's big guns.
Such was the case this year, as
Marquette claimed its eighth
straight tournament champion
ship.
The Cards' first round game
was Monday against Wisconsin,
who looked ready to cruise to an
easy win. Scoring 12 un
answered points to open the
game, the Badgers may have
been a triffle overconfident.
Stanford started a pressing de
fense, and in just eight minutes
led 23-20. Wolfe Perry made a
key steal and hit five of six from
the floor, to spark the Cardinal
comeback. At halftime the Cards
held a 38-36 lead.
Vulnerable
"1 think they're vulnerabletoa
full-court press," coach Dick Di-
Biaso said later. But Stanford, in
the midst of a grueling six day
roadtrip, ran out of gas in the
second half.
To be sure, Ed Schweitzer kept
rebounding. And rebounding.
And rebounding. He wound up
with 18 against Wisconsin and
finished the tournament with 35,
tying the Milwaukee Classic re
cord set by Dave Cowens in
1967.
Schweitzer also kept scoring,
finishing the game with 22
points. But Perry, who had
played so well in the first half,
was stone cold, hitting only one
of nine shots in the second half.
The Badgers and Cards traded
baskets for 12 minutes, before
Wisconsin pulled away. Stan
ford had to foul, and Wisconsin
scored their last 12 points on free
throws.
And though Dißiaso had his

men going all out at the end of he
game, the Cards lost by their
biggest margin of the season —
70-64.
Inconsistent
"Wewere inconsistent, but
we've been this way all season,"
Dißiaso said. "We're not a ma
ture team, and teams like us are
not going to be consistent."
But having only nine healthy
men on the traveling squad,
made things more difficult for
Dißiaso. Guard Jay Carter suf
fered a twisted ankle in pre
game workouts and only played
15 minutes. Dißiaso shuffled his
Cards with abandon, making 34
substitutions during the game.
Perhaps the most frustrated
player of the game, however,
was Wisconsin forward Dale
Koehler, the team's leading
scorer. He was held to only ten
points by George Schader's
hustling defense.
"No matter what 1 did tonight,
I couldn't get the ball," Koehler
lamented after the game. "1
worked hard. I don't know what
else I could have done."
Consolation
As if the first game wasn't tir
ing enough, the Cards were run
over by Chuck Goodyear of
Miami of Ohio in the consolation
game. The last time a rubber
company's namesake traveled to
this tournament was in 1964,
when Gail Goodrich led UCLA to
the only victory ever by a visit
ing school here. (Marquette has
won the Classic nine times and
Wisconsin four times in the 14
year history of the event.)
Goodyear led all scorers with
27 poionts and led Miami with
four steals, two blocked shots
and seven rebounds. Stanford,
save for Schweitzer's rebound
ing, could do little all night.
They led for 37 seconds at the
beginning of the game, and held
to within three at halftime, but
the Cards' final 20 minutes of
basketball in Milwaukee was a
nightmare.
Stanford shot a miserable 29.3

percent from the floor, missing
29 shots in all during the second
half. At the same time, Miami got
hot, hitting nearly 56 percent in
the last half.
The final 10 minutes saw
Miami pull away to its final 18
point lead — 90-72 — as the au
dience seemed more interested
in getting refreshments than in
watching the game.
Warriors win
Oh yes, there was a fourth
school at the tournament, only
Stanford had to watch it from the
stands. Seventh-ranked Mar
quette routed Miami in the first
game 79-52. Most observers ex
pected a repeat performance in
the finals, but Wisconsin came
out to win — emotions were
running high. Wisconsin coach
John Powless and Marquette's A 1
McGuire drew technical fouls
early in the game — Powless
earning his by throwing his coat
and kicking his chair. McGuire
merely ran onto the floor, mak
ing threatening gestures.

The Badgers led by five points
at the 10 minute mark, but a ba
lanced, deliberate offense, gave
Marquette a 34-33 halftime lead.
In the second half, it was Wis
consin's turn to run out of gas, as
they led for just 17 seconds in the
final period. Tournament Co-
MVP's Butch Lee and Bo Ellis,
poured it on for the Warriors,
finishing with 20 points each. At
the final buzzer, Marquette had
staged the rout everyone had
expected, winning 82-66.
Cardinal Notes: Dißiaso made
so many substitutions during the
Wisconsin game, that it promp
ted a post game argument at the
scoring table, as to whether he
had set a Classic re
cord . . . Schweitzer was a little
more consistent than Cowens,
on the way to his 35 rebounds:
Ed had one game totals of 18 and
17, while Cowens had four and
31 .. . The all-tournament team
was Schweitzer, Lee Ellis, Mar
quette forward Earl Tatum and
Wisconsin center Bo Johnson.
