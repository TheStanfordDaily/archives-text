# 75,000 attend 51st renewal
## West wins Shrine Classic 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Another facet of American
sport on the verge of extinction,
like the World Football League,
visited Stanford last month
—the 50th East West Shrine
Classic, a venerable road show,
that cannot match P.T. Barnum's
"Greatest Show On Earth."

Well, the World Football
League is now just a mass of un
paid bills and legal briefs. But
the East West Shrine Classic is
doing just fine, thank you.
Faced with the harsh reality
that Saturday's 51st Classic
might be tha last, the Shriners
over-promoted the game. And it
worked.
The largest crowd in the his
tory of the series 75,000, filed
into Stanford Stadium, to see the
West win its first game since
1971, 21-14.
"I think the Shrine Game is
back," said California coach
Mike White, the coach of the
West team. "You had players
from all the Bay Area Schools
here today, and it was a very
good season for Bay Area teams.
1 think this is a carryover."
Many of the fans may have

come to see Cal Ail-American
running back Chuck Muncie's
last appearance as a collegian in
the Bay Area. Besides Muncie,
the West had San Diego State
quarterback Craig Penrose, the
nation's leading passer, and a
host of great running backs.
But it was the defense which
won the game for the West. With
Nor Cal defensive Player-Of-
The-Year, San Jose State defen
sive end Kim Bokamper, and
Arizona State linebacker Larry
Gordon leading the charge, the
West shut out the East in the first
half, allowing them only five
first downs.
After a third period lapse,
which saw the East close to 14-7,
the West defense stopped the
East's comeback attempt in four
consecutive possessions.
Lonnie Perrin of Illinois mis
sed field goals of 52 and 50
yards, Gordon picked off a pass,
and the West defense stopped
them on downs in the last mi
nute.
"We just realized it was get
ting down near the end," said
Bokamper," and we bore down
that much more."
Bokamper, who played in
Spartan teammate Wilson
Faumuina's massive shaddow
all year, came into his own
Saturday. He was awarded the
Spaulding Trophy as defensive
player-of-the-game, for his play
opposite consensus All-
American tackle Dennis Lick of
Wisconsin.
Pro scouts
The press box was packed
with pro football scouts and the
West defense gave them a good
show. Gordon and Arizona State
teammate Mike Haynes had two
interceptions. Arizona defensive
tackle Mike Dawson blocked a
field goal and had a couple of
sacks.
The West defensive backs
gave the scouts a show too. "1
think thre£ of the four defensive
backs — Mario Clark of Oregon,
Haynes and Hunter — will go in
the first round," said White. The
crew limited the East to just 11
completions in 31 attempts.
Routine day
Muncie had a routine day —
for him. He gained 106 yards on
22 carries and caught three pas
ses for 37 yards. The Heisman
Trophy runner-up set up all
three of the West's touchdowns.
The first score was set up late
in the second period, when East
defensive back Ray Preston of

Syracuse knocked Muncie
down, when he saw that he
could not stop Muncie from
catching the ball. That interfer
ence call got the ball down to the
East 18 and four plays later Larry
Gaines scored on a four yard run.
Stanford linebacker Geb
Church recovered Larry Dorsey's
fumble to start the second half
and the West was in business
again. It took the West just five
plays to score from the 33, with
Muncie gaining 21 yards on two
carries. Long Beach State's Herb
Lusk went the last two for the
touchdown, which gave the
West a 14-0 lead.
Praying tailback
Lusk is nicknamed the pray
ing tailback, because after each
touchdown he kneels in prayer.
He got a chance to give thanks
one more time.
, Muncie made his final recep
tion of the day a good one. Leap
ing high over the East defender,
he hauled down a 30 yard pass to
get the West down to the East 18
on the third scoring drive.

Four plays later. Lusk scored
from the two.
Muncie, who won the
Coffman Trophy, awarded to the
game's offensive player-of-the
game. said that he wanted to do
nate it to the children at the
Shriner's Hospital, who receive
the proceeds from the game.
Cardinal Notes: Pro scouts in
attendance said that Stanford
players Mike Langford and Geb
Church would probably go in the
second round of the NFL draft
next month . . . One sports wri
ter said that the Shriners must
have rounded up every Shriner
and Mason in California for the
game.
Canada sent its Royal Cana
dian Mounted Police and a re
gimental band as part of its
Bicentenial tribute to Ameri
ca .. . The thousands of Shriners
who annually parade around the
field at halftime were forced to
march at 11 in a pre-game pa
gent. much to the relief of
fans . . . NBC did not televise the
Shrine Game.
