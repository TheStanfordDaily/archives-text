Stanford 63, Cal Poly Pomona 61 (Dec. 20 at
Stanford) —The Cards took to the court after a
12-day break for final exams and it showed. Stan
ford took a nearly 17-10 lead, but hit a cold spell and
fell behind by as many as 11 points in the first half.
It was still 42-33 Cal Poly at halftime, and it
wasn't until 10:31 to play, that the Cards finally
caught up. Neither team led by two points the rest of
the way.
The Cards controlled the ball for the final 1:41,
after Pomona tied the score at 61-61 on a goal tend
ing call against Tim Patterson.
Forward George Schader put up an off-balance
with two seconds left and Tim Patterson tipped in
the decisive bucket to give the Cards a 63-61 win.
Minnesota 89, Stanford 84 (Dec. 22 at Stanford) —
The Cards gave unbeaten Minnesota a battle for the
first 30 minutes, before the Gophers finally got their
running game together.
The lead changed hands 17 times and it was tied
ten more, before guard Ray Williams, brother of
Warrior guard Gus Williams, began getting loose on
fast breaks, and the Gophers turned a five point lead
into a rout.
The turning point might have been the work of

the officials — Booker Turner and Frank Bussone.
With 7:19 remaining, Williams came down the floor
on a fast break and wound up in a heap with Patter
son. Williams began to pummel Patterson, and got
in two or three good blows.
The officials walked Williams around the floor to
cool him off and the preceeded to call a foul on
George Schader, who wasn't even in the game at the
time — and then on Patterson, who exited with five
fouls.
Stanford 87, St. Mary's 71 (Dec. 23 at Stanford)
—Seeing its third zone in a row, the Cards must
have learned something, as they handed the Gaels
their eighth straight loss. Guard Jay Carter cracked
the zone, hitting 10 of 14 attempts, including a half
dozen from the 15 to 25 foot range and wound up
with an even 20 points.
He was just as good at the other end of the court,
holding St. Mary's star guard Ralph Walker to 20
points, two below his average,
Louisiana State 89, Stanford 85 (Dec. 27 at Batton
Rouge) —Stanford saw its record evened to 4-4, after
losing to undefeated LSU 89-85.
The Tigers' Doug Saylor sank three free throws in
the last 35 seconds to beat the Cards in a game which
saw 55 personal fouls committed.
