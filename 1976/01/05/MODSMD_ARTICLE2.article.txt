# Inter-Frat Council proposes housing quota plan changes
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
has proposed changes in the housing
quota plan implemented last year
which it hopes will lessen the frater
nities' burden.
First, the IFC hopes to remove all
sanctions against individual frater
nities that fail to meet their "fair
share" quota — a number above nor
mal occupancy which approximates
the percentage of students forced off
campus by a shortage of on-campus
housing — if the Creek system as a
whole meets its quota.
Presently a house which misses its
individual quota for three out of four
consecutive years is subject to assimi
lation into the University residence
system, and loses its draw-exempt
status. The sanction could be applied
even if the fraternity system met its
overi)ll requirement.
"We think that as long as the system
as a whole meets the quota, then we're
not placing any burden on the Univer
sity to take in extra people and we're
not creating an inequitable system for
those who choose to live in the Univer

sity system," said IFC President Bob
Ottilie.
Penalties
The IFC is not asking for removal of
penalties against fraternities if the en
tire system fails to pledge its required
number.
But Ottilie suggested that changes
within a solvent Greek system, such as
the replacement of a weak fraternity by
a new, stronger one, should be allowed
without housing office interference.
"That's a decision that should be left
up to the fraternities themselves," Ot
tilie said.
In a second proposal, the IFC has
requested that the University automat
ically fill unmet fraternity quota
spaces with persons from the housing
office waiting list — in effect removing
the fraternities' power of choice over
"boarders."
In return for such a concession,
sanctions against houses not filled by
their own selection process would be
removed under the IFC plan.
Part of the system
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton said such a proposal would be

considered, adding, "The fraternities
are under the guaranteed housing
plan. They are part of the University
system . . . and should be thought of as
part of the University system."
A final proposal by the IFC asks that
the University continue to allow over
crowding in fraternity houses so that
all members wishing to live on campus
could do so.
"Stuffing" thus far has been allowed
by University officials, but Horton said
that no definite policy had been
adopted. He added, however, that "our
general feeling for the most part is that
everyone should operate under one set
of principles." Overcrowding not
specifically mandated is not permitted
by University residence system regula
tions.
Ottilie and other IFC representatives
have discussed the proposals with
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson prior to presentation to Hor
ton.
Horton said he would probably
"handle them early (this) quarter."

overi)ll requirement.
"We think that as long as the system
as a whole meets the quota, then we're
not placing any burden on the Univer
sity to take in extra people and we're
not creating an inequitable system for
those who choose to live in the Univer

sity system," said IFC President Bob
Ottilie.
Penalties
The IFC is not asking for removal of
penalties against fraternities if the en
tire system fails to pledge its required
number.
But Ottilie suggested that changes
within a solvent Greek system, such as
the replacement of a weak fraternity by
a new, stronger one, should be allowed
without housing office interference.
"That's a decision that should be left
up to the fraternities themselves," Ot
tilie said.
In a second proposal, the IFC has
requested that the University automat
ically fill unmet fraternity quota
spaces with persons from the housing
office waiting list — in effect removing
the fraternities' power of choice over
"boarders."
In return for such a concession,
sanctions against houses not filled by
their own selection process would be
removed under the IFC plan.
Part of the system
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton said such a proposal would be

considered, adding, "The fraternities
are under the guaranteed housing
plan. They are part of the University
system . . . and should be thought of as
part of the University system."
A final proposal by the IFC asks that
the University continue to allow over
crowding in fraternity houses so that
all members wishing to live on campus
could do so.
"Stuffing" thus far has been allowed
by University officials, but Horton said
that no definite policy had been
adopted. He added, however, that "our
general feeling for the most part is that
everyone should operate under one set
of principles." Overcrowding not
specifically mandated is not permitted
by University residence system regula
tions.
Ottilie and other IFC representatives
have discussed the proposals with
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson prior to presentation to Hor
ton.
Horton said he would probably
"handle them early (this) quarter."
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
has proposed changes in the housing
quota plan implemented last year
which it hopes will lessen the frater
nities' burden.
First, the IFC hopes to remove all
sanctions against individual frater
nities that fail to meet their "fair
share" quota — a number above nor
mal occupancy which approximates
the percentage of students forced off
campus by a shortage of on-campus
housing — if the Creek system as a
whole meets its quota.
Presently a house which misses its
individual quota for three out of four
consecutive years is subject to assimi
lation into the University residence
system, and loses its draw-exempt
status. The sanction could be applied
even if the fraternity system met its
overi)ll requirement.
"We think that as long as the system
as a whole meets the quota, then we're
not placing any burden on the Univer
sity to take in extra people and we're

sity system," said IFC President Bob
