MEMPHIS. Tenn. — As an inveterate
Southern Cal hater, I could hardly resist the
temptation to make the three-hour drive up
here to see Texas A&M send John McKay off
to the pros with a much-deserved kick in the
teeth. One of the greatest disappointments of
my life was leaving California just in time to
miss McKay's four-game losing binge this
fall. And I was determined to see the fifth and
final loss at all costs.
So I wheedled a press pass fronVthe sports
editor of the obscure journal for which I make
a living — sort of — covering cub scout ban
quets and azalea shows and started the
three-hour drive north for the Liberty Bowl,
fantasizing every inch of the way about
McKay's forthcoming humiliation and the
imaginatively rude questions I would ask
him afterwards in the locker room ("When it
got to be H2-0, coach, did you wish you had
cut your throat before the game?").
Unfortunately. I forgot one thing: the Lib
erty Bowl is played in Memphis, not Palo
Alto, and unlike Stanford students the
Southern sportswriters covering the game
did not know the wisdom, beauty and justice
of Trojan-hating.
It wasn't long before I realized my mistake.
When the USC band did its traditional
goose-step on to the field, the other reporters
watched with interest instead of fury. "You
know, we really don't have anything like this
at all in the South," a Jackson, Miss, writer
told me. "Don't you think they're impres
sive?"
"Well, actually, we used to call them the
Rubber Band at Stanford," I said.
He gave me a blank look.
"You know, Trojans, rubbers, prophylac
tics," l explained, a bit nervous for the first
time. "Get it? When I was a freshman we had
this All-American linebacker named Jeff
Siemon and in the USC game he broke
through and sacked the quarterback and our
band did a cheer that said 'Trojans can't stop
our Siemon.' "
Suddenly aware that I was babbling, 1 stop
ped. The sportswriters sitting around me
were silent, pondering this new bit of wis
dom. Finally a Memphis reporter looked at

me and asked: "Did you say your band does
cheers?"
"Oh, all the time," 1 assured him.
"Is it always about the other school?"
"Well, sometimes. But sometimes they do
cheers about the coach, or the coach's daugh
ter, or our quarterback."
"They have a special cheer for the coach
and the quarterback?"
"Well, not exactly for the coach and the
quarterback," I admitted. "More like for a
new coach and quarterback."
The USC band saved me from this line of
inquiry by striking up that ridiculous Ben
Hur music it customarily plays when it's time
to remind the team that death is preferable to
defeat. The handful of Trojan fans scattered
around the stadium pranced through the
aisles waving fists in the traditional V sign.
"That must really be demoralizing for other
teams to hear that music," a Little Rock repor
ter said. "It's really kind of awe-inspiring.
How do you keep your players from getting
jittery when you hear it?"
"IJh, we always did Nazi salutes in time to
the music," I stammered before I could get
hold of my tongue. "Sometimes we chanted
'seig heil' for good measure. Or we threw
water balloons."
"Nazi salutes?" the reporter said in utter
astonishment. "What would you give Nazi
salutes for?"
"You don't understand," I said percep
tively. "All those guys in Watergate, they
were all from USC. And McKay is a first class
jerk. One time he said he wanted to beat Stan
ford by 2000 points, and that we were the
Radcliffe of the West. Our paper even called
him a cockroach. How many coaches ever get
called a cockroach?"
"What the hell does Watergate have to do
with football?" one writer asked in confu
sion. "Wouldn't you rather win by 2000
points than win by one point?" another
chimed in.
I was beaten. I could barely summon a
sneer when McKay walked onto the field, and
I knew that I was doomed. Sure enough, the
next time I looked up it was 20-0 for USC and I
had driven 150 miles for nothing. After the
game I had to ask polite questions about how
it felt to go out a winner and when I was
through McKay even patted me on the butt. I
cried all the way back to Greenville.

were all from USC. And McKay is a first class
jerk. One time he said he wanted to beat Stan
ford by 2000 points, and that we were the
Radcliffe of the West. Our paper even called
him a cockroach. How many coaches ever get
called a cockroach?"
"What the hell does Watergate have to do
with football?" one writer asked in confu
sion. "Wouldn't you rather win by 2000
points than win by one point?" another
chimed in.
I was beaten. I could barely summon a
sneer when McKay walked onto the field, and
I knew that I was doomed. Sure enough, the
next time I looked up it was 20-0 for USC and I
had driven 150 miles for nothing. After the
game I had to ask polite questions about how
it felt to go out a winner and when I was
through McKay even patted me on the butt. I
cried all the way back to Greenville.

MEMPHIS. Tenn. — As an inveterate
Southern Cal hater, I could hardly resist the
temptation to make the three-hour drive up
here to see Texas A&M send John McKay off
to the pros with a much-deserved kick in the
teeth. One of the greatest disappointments of
my life was leaving California just in time to
miss McKay's four-game losing binge this
fall. And I was determined to see the fifth and
final loss at all costs.
So I wheedled a press pass fronVthe sports
editor of the obscure journal for which I make
a living — sort of — covering cub scout ban
quets and azalea shows and started the
three-hour drive north for the Liberty Bowl,
fantasizing every inch of the way about
McKay's forthcoming humiliation and the
imaginatively rude questions I would ask
him afterwards in the locker room ("When it
got to be H2-0, coach, did you wish you had
cut your throat before the game?").
Unfortunately. I forgot one thing: the Lib
erty Bowl is played in Memphis, not Palo
Alto, and unlike Stanford students the
Southern sportswriters covering the game
did not know the wisdom, beauty and justice
of Trojan-hating.
It wasn't long before I realized my mistake.
When the USC band did its traditional
goose-step on to the field, the other reporters
watched with interest instead of fury. "You
know, we really don't have anything like this
at all in the South," a Jackson, Miss, writer
told me. "Don't you think they're impres
sive?"
"Well, actually, we used to call them the
Rubber Band at Stanford," I said.
He gave me a blank look.
"You know, Trojans, rubbers, prophylac
tics," l explained, a bit nervous for the first
time. "Get it? When I was a freshman we had
this All-American linebacker named Jeff
Siemon and in the USC game he broke
through and sacked the quarterback and our
band did a cheer that said 'Trojans can't stop
our Siemon.' "
Suddenly aware that I was babbling, 1 stop
ped. The sportswriters sitting around me
were silent, pondering this new bit of wis
dom. Finally a Memphis reporter looked at

me and asked: "Did you say your band does
cheers?"
"Oh, all the time," 1 assured him.
"Is it always about the other school?"
"Well, sometimes. But sometimes they do
cheers about the coach, or the coach's daugh
ter, or our quarterback."
"They have a special cheer for the coach
and the quarterback?"
"Well, not exactly for the coach and the
quarterback," I admitted. "More like for a
new coach and quarterback."
The USC band saved me from this line of
inquiry by striking up that ridiculous Ben
Hur music it customarily plays when it's time
to remind the team that death is preferable to
defeat. The handful of Trojan fans scattered
around the stadium pranced through the
aisles waving fists in the traditional V sign.
"That must really be demoralizing for other
teams to hear that music," a Little Rock repor
ter said. "It's really kind of awe-inspiring.
How do you keep your players from getting
jittery when you hear it?"
"IJh, we always did Nazi salutes in time to
the music," I stammered before I could get
hold of my tongue. "Sometimes we chanted
'seig heil' for good measure. Or we threw
water balloons."
"Nazi salutes?" the reporter said in utter
astonishment. "What would you give Nazi
salutes for?"
"You don't understand," I said percep
tively. "All those guys in Watergate, they

The USC band saved me from this line of
inquiry by striking up that ridiculous Ben
Hur music it customarily plays when it's time
to remind the team that death is preferable to
defeat. The handful of Trojan fans scattered
around the stadium pranced through the
aisles waving fists in the traditional V sign.
"That must really be demoralizing for other
teams to hear that music," a Little Rock repor
ter said. "It's really kind of awe-inspiring.
How do you keep your players from getting
jittery when you hear it?"
"IJh, we always did Nazi salutes in time to
the music," I stammered before I could get
hold of my tongue. "Sometimes we chanted
'seig heil' for good measure. Or we threw
water balloons."
"Nazi salutes?" the reporter said in utter
astonishment. "What would you give Nazi
salutes for?"
"You don't understand," I said percep
tively. "All those guys in Watergate, they
were all from USC. And McKay is a first class
jerk. One time he said he wanted to beat Stan
ford by 2000 points, and that we were the
Radcliffe of the West. Our paper even called
him a cockroach. How many coaches ever get
called a cockroach?"
"What the hell does Watergate have to do
with football?" one writer asked in confu
sion. "Wouldn't you rather win by 2000
points than win by one point?" another
chimed in.
I was beaten. I could barely summon a
sneer when McKay walked onto the field, and
I knew that I was doomed. Sure enough, the
next time I looked up it was 20-0 for USC and I
had driven 150 miles for nothing. After the
game I had to ask polite questions about how
it felt to go out a winner and when I was
through McKay even patted me on the butt. I
cried all the way back to Greenville.
