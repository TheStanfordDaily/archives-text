While USC and UCLA were
playing in Bowl games, Stanford
players were joining them.
Jack Christiansen coached the
Blue team to its third straight
victory in the Blue-Gray football
game last month 14-13. The
game, played in Montgomery,
Ala., was really strange. The first
period was shortened to 12 mi
nutes for television and the sec
ond half was stretched out to fit
the television time slot.
Stanford split end Bill Singler
caught a 52-yard touchdown
pass with 31 seconds remaining
to give the Blue team the win.
Card tight end Ted Pappas

caught a pass at the start of the
ball game, but the Blue team
never crossed the mid field
stripe until the last quarter.
The game, which drew only
10,000 may be on the verge of
extinction.
Linebacker Ceb Church and
kicker Mike Langford were on
the winning West squad in
Saturday's East-West Shrine
Classic. Church recovered a
fumble and was the West's lead
ing tackier with seven tackles.
Langford wasn't on the field that
much, hitting all three extra
point attempts. West coach Mike
White called a fake field goal in
the second quarter.

WOODY HATES YOU — UCLA Ail-American quarterback John
Sciarra, shown here against Stanford, had a lousy first half
against Ohio State in the Rose Bowl. Sciarra made up for it by
running the veer to perfection in the second half, to give the Bruins
a 23-10 upset win over the Buckeyes. He threw two touchdown
passes in the game.
