### CHRIS BAKER 
PASADENA — Only the east
side — the UCLA cheering sec
tion — basked in the warm glow
of the setting sun. as the cheer
rose from the Bruin cheering sec
tion. "Happy New Year,
Woody!" chanted the UCLA
rooters.
History had repeated itself, as
UCLA knocked coach Woody
Hayes' Ohio State Buckeyes out
of a national championship,
with a 23-10 upset win in the
62nd Rose Bowl Game New
Year's Day.
Another UCLA team had pul
led off a similar upset 10 years
ago in the Rose Bowl, beating the
previously unbeaten and top
ranked Michigan State 14-12.
Both times. UCLA had lost to the
Big-10 team during the regular
season.
14 point underdogs
The Bruins, 14 point under
dogs, looked like just that during
the first half. In a first half whose
most stirring play was Rose
Parade Grand Marshall Kate
Smith's rendention of "God
Bless America," Ohio State
bored the 105,464 spectators and
a national television audience
with classic Big 10 football —
three yards and a cloud of roses.
But wait, the brand new Rose
Bowl scoreboard (the Game
Management Committee finally
replaced the run down
scoreboard for next year's Super
Bowl) showed that Ohio State
only had a 3-0 lead at half time.
Sure the Buckeye defense had
held UCLA to just 48 yards in the
first half and out first downed
the Bruins 11-2, but the unheral
ded UCLA defense had allowed
just three points on four scoring
chances — to their own 25. 33,
32 and 21 yard lines.
Bruin coach Dick Vermeil
didn't give an inspirational mes
sage to his Bruins at halttime;
instead he made some adjust
ments. And did thev work.

The UCLA veer, about as effec
tive as Stanford's rushing game
during the first half, began to
function with All-American
quarterback John Sciarra at the
helm. Sciarra threw two
touchdown strikes — passes
covering 16 and 67 yards tp
flanker Wally Henry.
The Bruins had a 16-3 lead on
Sciarra's passing and Brett
White's 33-yard field goal as thfc
third quarter ended.
But IJCLA fans began thinking
of White's missed extra pofht
conversion, as Ohio State
marched 65 yards to cut the lead
to 16-10 early in the fourth quar-"
ter.
Tyler shines
Up to this point Bruin fans
were grateful that UCLA tailback
Wendell Tyler hadn't fumbled.
Tyler had other ideas. Playing
with a broken wrist. Tyler
clinched the game for the
Bruins. With four minutes left,
he cut through a gapping hole in
the Ohio State defense and ram
bled 54 yards for the insurance
touchdown. He finished with
172 yards, something to think
about when you remember that
UCLA had nine yards rushing in
the first half.
The Bruins, who had just 48
yards total offense in the first
half, rolled up 414 to Ohio
State's 298.
Vermeil was talkative. He took
the opportunity to blast the
Northern California press for
saying California should be'iff
the Rose Bowl. "Some of the
Northern California writers
thought California should have
gone to the Rose Bowl instead of
us.
"I thought a couple of North
ern California writers were way
out of line in some of the things
they said. I don't know their
names, but I would like to tell
them now to go to hell, because
they were the ones who said that
we didn't belong here."

scoreboard for next year's Super
Bowl) showed that Ohio State
only had a 3-0 lead at half time.
Sure the Buckeye defense had
held UCLA to just 48 yards in the
first half and out first downed
the Bruins 11-2, but the unheral
ded UCLA defense had allowed
just three points on four scoring
chances — to their own 25. 33,
32 and 21 yard lines.
Bruin coach Dick Vermeil
didn't give an inspirational mes
sage to his Bruins at halttime;
instead he made some adjust
ments. And did thev work.

The UCLA veer, about as effec
tive as Stanford's rushing game
during the first half, began to
function with All-American
quarterback John Sciarra at the
helm. Sciarra threw two
touchdown strikes — passes
covering 16 and 67 yards tp
flanker Wally Henry.
The Bruins had a 16-3 lead on
Sciarra's passing and Brett
White's 33-yard field goal as thfc
third quarter ended.
But IJCLA fans began thinking
of White's missed extra pofht
conversion, as Ohio State
marched 65 yards to cut the lead
to 16-10 early in the fourth quar-"
ter.
Tyler shines
Up to this point Bruin fans
were grateful that UCLA tailback
Wendell Tyler hadn't fumbled.
Tyler had other ideas. Playing
with a broken wrist. Tyler
clinched the game for the
Bruins. With four minutes left,
he cut through a gapping hole in
the Ohio State defense and ram
bled 54 yards for the insurance
touchdown. He finished with
172 yards, something to think
about when you remember that
UCLA had nine yards rushing in
the first half.
The Bruins, who had just 48
yards total offense in the first
half, rolled up 414 to Ohio
State's 298.
Vermeil was talkative. He took
the opportunity to blast the
Northern California press for
saying California should be'iff
the Rose Bowl. "Some of the
Northern California writers
thought California should have
gone to the Rose Bowl instead of
us.
"I thought a couple of North
ern California writers were way
out of line in some of the things
they said. I don't know their
names, but I would like to tell
them now to go to hell, because
they were the ones who said that
we didn't belong here."
PASADENA — Only the east
side — the UCLA cheering sec
tion — basked in the warm glow
of the setting sun. as the cheer
rose from the Bruin cheering sec
tion. "Happy New Year,
Woody!" chanted the UCLA
rooters.
History had repeated itself, as
UCLA knocked coach Woody
Hayes' Ohio State Buckeyes out
of a national championship,
with a 23-10 upset win in the
62nd Rose Bowl Game New
Year's Day.
Another UCLA team had pul
led off a similar upset 10 years
ago in the Rose Bowl, beating the
previously unbeaten and top
ranked Michigan State 14-12.
Both times. UCLA had lost to the
Big-10 team during the regular
season.
14 point underdogs
The Bruins, 14 point under
dogs, looked like just that during
the first half. In a first half whose
most stirring play was Rose
Parade Grand Marshall Kate
Smith's rendention of "God
Bless America," Ohio State
bored the 105,464 spectators and
a national television audience
with classic Big 10 football —
three yards and a cloud of roses.
