National Airlines strike ends
MIAMI — Flight attendants voted yesterday to
accept a contract that they rejected two months
earlier and ended a 126-day strike against National
Airlines, one of the longest airline strikes in the
nation's history.
The airline, grounded since the walkout began
Sept. 1, prepared to resume limited operatiions on
tomorrow. The strike by the 1200-member Associ
ation of Flight Attendants had forced the layoff of
more than 6000 employes. They will return to
work within 30 days, an airline spokesman said.
The company employed 7600 workers before the
strike. About 1000 continued to work during the
walkout.
The stewards and stewardesses voted by a 3-to-l
margin to accept the contract. They were under
court order to reconsider the agreement worked out
with federal mediators and rejected months earlier
in the dispute over contract language.
The strike for more money and changed working
rules had continued despite opposition from other
union members. Stewardesses at other airlines
voted in October against a proposed $3-a-week as
sessment to help the strikers.
The strike was the third longest in National's
history.
Teachers' union defies court
PITTSBIJRGH — The city's 62,000 public school
students were scheduled to return to classes at 1
p.m. today but teachers' union officials said mem
bers would not obey a court order and go back to
their classrooms.
School Supt. jerry Olson said he expected the
city's 4400 striking teachers and aides to obey the
court order, although the union opposed it. Al
legheny County Judge Donald Ziegler issued the
temporary injunction Saturday against the five
week-old strike.
The'teachers' union pledged to defy the ruling by
Ziegler, who also ordered weekend negotiations in
an effort to break the contract deadlock.
L.A. readies emergency care
LOS ANGELES —Emergency crews are ready to
deploy everything from helicopters to hotlines to
cope with a doctors' slowdown over soaring mal
practice insurance rates, officials said yesterday.
"We are prepared to handle any emergencies,"
Dr. John Zaffeldt, medical director of the Depart
ment of Health Services for Los Angeles County,
said in an interview.
Zaffeldt said that the eight county hospitals are
about HO percent filled to capacity but that most
private hospitals are continuing to operate
emergency centers.
Meanwhile, no progress was reported between
representatives from Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s
office and spokesmen for doctors, who are trying to
work out a legislative solution.
The two negotiating teams broke off discussions
over the weekend but were to resume meetings
today in Sacramento, where among the legislative
proposals is a bill by Assemblyman Art Torres
(D-Los Angeles), which would limit malpractice
insurance premiums to $5000 a year.
European storm kills 40
LONDON — Western Europe launched a mas
sive cleanup operation yesterday from hurricane

force winds and floods that killed more than 40
persons and caused hundreds of millions of dollars
in damage.
Britain topped the fatality toll with 24 dead from
the 100 mph winds that swept across the country
and into Western Europe on Friday night and
Saturday.
In addition. 11 crewmen were missing from the
East German coastal freighter Capella and feared
drowed. The vessel sank Saturday in the North Sea
off the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog.
Major insurance companies in Britain alone es
timated that damage claims that could amount to
well over $100 million and might reach $200 mill
ion.
British weather experts said the freak gales were
caused by a sharp atmospheric depression.
Gag rule binds press freedom
NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — A mass-murder case
which has sparked a controversy over a judge's gag
rule gets under way today.
Erwin Charles Simants, 29, is charged with six
counts of first-degree murder and of sexual assault
in the Oct. 18 deaths of six members of the Henry
Kellie family.
Judge Hugh Stuart will preside at the trial in
Lincoln County District Court. Stuart imposed a
gag rule on the Nebraska news media's reporting of
information presented at Simants' preliminary
hearing and some information gathered by the
news media before then.
Despite considerable publicity nationally and in
Lincoln County, Judge Stuart has denied a defense
request for a change of venue.
At issue is the right of a judge to impose prior
restraint on what the news media may publish
about actions conducted in courts which, under
Nebraska law and the state constitution, are to be
open.
But Simants' court-appointed public defenders,
the prosecution and the District Court contend pub
lication of all the evidence presented in the pre
liminary hearing before selection of a jury would
make it impossible for Simants to obtain an impar
tial jury and a fair trial.
Israeli pound devalued
TEL AVIV — Fighting falling production and an
inflation rate of 38 percent, Israel announced yes
terday the sixth devaluation of its currency in 14
months.
The 1.9 percent devaluation meant the value of
the Israeli pound dropped byover 70 percent since
Nov. 1974. The current rate was fixed at 7.24
pounds to the U.S. dollar.
The devaluation came after the government's
statistics bureau published its preliminary year
end findings, and said the country's production
rate had declined for the first time in 22 years.
The two percent drop in gross national pro
duct indicated a failure in the government's an
nounced policy of shifting Israelis from small
businesses, services and government work to the
factories.
As prices rose at a rate 5 times faster than in the
United States, Israelis bought 5 percent less than in
1974, the statistics bureau said.
The trade deficit, encouraged by the skyrocket
ing cost of sophisticated armaments, increased by
$500 million to a total $4 billion, the bureau said.

Cyclists' war causes death
BOONE, lowa — "He loved bikes," Beverly
Breeder!, a mother of five, told police after her hus
band was killed in a brawl between rival motorcy
cle clubs.
"Fighting didn't happen much. The club was for
guys who liked to ride, party and have a good
time."
Glenn Breeden, a Des Moines truck driver, was
stabbed to death Friday night when he walked into
a tavern alone to arrange a truce between his club,
the Grim Reapers, and a club called the Last Chap
ter, police said.
"It was supposed to be a conference-type deal,"
said John Hallock, a member of the Grim Reapers.
"There had been some talks about consolidating
their club into ours." •
Israel protests U.N. debate
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
warned yesterday that the U.N. Security Council
would "stalemate" Mideast peace moves if it tried
to take over Arab-Israeli negotiations. He urged the
United States to block any such development.
In a speech reported by the state radio, Rabin
hinted that the outcome of next week's council
debate could cause renewed warfare.
Observers saw this as a way of saying Israel
would fight rather than accept undesirable political
developments.
Meanwhile, in Beirut, sporadic shooting kept
rival street fighters behind barricades yesterday as
Moslem and Christian leaders escalated their feud
over how to end Lebanon's civil war.
Increasingly hard positions on both sides re
duced chances for an early political solution to the
sectarian conflict that has killed more than 7000
persons since April.
Ibrahi in Kuleilat, leader of the strongest left-wing
Moslem army, the "Ambushers," claimed his leftist
forces are battling for increased integration into the
Arab world, particularly as regards the war against
Israel.
Busing foes may shift stand
BOSTON — The Boston School Committee, long
the dominant antibusing force in the city, is ex
pected to shift toward moderation after two new
members are sworn in today.
John Kerrigan and Paul Ellison, the two most
vocal opponents of busing on the committee, will
not be on the new panel.
Among the replacements is David Finnegan,
a moderate. Although the other, Elvira Pixie Pal
ladino, is a leader of an anti-busing group called
Restore Our Alienated Rights, committee sources
say Finnegan's election is expected to give the
committee a three-member majority that will take a
more conciliatoy approach to integration.
Members of the committee, elected to run the
newly integrated school system, say they hope the
softened tone will help the committee regain some
of the power taken over by the U.S. District Court
amid the long and bitter controversy over busing
here.
Today's weather
