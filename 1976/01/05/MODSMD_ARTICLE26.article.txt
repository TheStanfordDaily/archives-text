# Scientists evacuate polar research post
## 
### 
Five Stanford technicians were
among 12 scientists evacuated last
week from Siple Station in the Antarc
tic, according to Accounting Adjunct
Prof. John Katsufrakis, who manages
Stanford research in Antarctica.
Early reports of the evacuation indi
cated the men were infected bv a
strange Antarctic germ, but Katsu
frakis called such stories "utter non
sense."
"It was simply that one of the men
came down with hepatitis," he said.
"And we couldn't take a chance of any
others getting sick with it later on
when the Antarctic winter closed in
and air transport stopped."
The Stanford team was engaged in

radio investigations of the ionosphere.
Their work involved studies of
lightning-caused, low-frequency radio
signals which travel through space
along the curved lines of the earth's
magnetic field.
The team's work was described in
the lead article of the winter edition of
The Stanford Magazine.
"It means the end of any scientific
work there this year, but we will go
back and continue it next year." said
Katsufrakis.
The research was under the direc
tion of Electrical Engineering Prof.
Robert Helliwell, principal inves
tigator of the project.
