### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) — The FBI has re
vealed to a congressional committee
that during an eight month period in
1969 it had encouraged warfare bet
ween rival black activist factions in
three major California cities, the San
Diego Union reported in Sunday edi
tions.
The paper said FBI involvement in
provoking hostilities that led to four
killings and the wounding of four
others was revealed in a 1200-page
Bureau report recently turned over to
the Select Senate Committee on Intel
ligence.
From January to August of that year,
FBI agents in San Diego, Los Angeles
and San Francisco, at the direction of
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, were in
structed to pit members of the Black
Panther Party against a group known
as the US Organization, the Union
said.
The two organizations were clas
sified in an FBI counterintelligence
program as militant "hate groups," the
paper said.

A source connected with the Senate
committee told the Union one
technique used by the FBI to cause fric
tion between Panther and US members
in San Diego was the drawing and dis
tributing of bogus cartoon posters at
tributed to US showing the Panthers as
corrupt.
Spencer Davis, a spokesman for the
Senate committee, told the Union that
the Los Angeles FBI office sponsored
activities against local Panther and US
members. Davis said threatening
phone calls, firebombings of Panther
and US headquarters, beatings and
shootings were used to try to prevent
the groups from joining forces.
James Adams, deputy associate
FBI director, told the Los Angeles
Times, which also reported the alleged
FBI involvement, that the purpose of
the federal agency was never to prom
ote violence.
"We were not trying to get people to
kill each other, but to disrupt these
groups, to reduce their effectiveness."
Adams said.
