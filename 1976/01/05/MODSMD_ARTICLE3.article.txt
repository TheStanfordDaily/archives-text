# Third World program urged
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs (C-FSP) "feels fairly strongly
as a general rule" that a new program
should be established in a Third World
country although a number of existing
programs will have to be eliminated or
restructured, Sociology Prof. James
March, C-FSP chairman, said last
night.
By starting a new Third World prog
ram. the University could not afford to
continue the programs in Italy, France
and England in their present form,
March told the Faculty Senate Dec. 19.
March claimed that the decree by the
Provost's Office to cut the Overseas
Studies Office budget from $1.5 mill
ion to approximately $800,000 in
1978-79 will itself force the restructur
ing of a "substantial number of prog
rams, not just the closing of one or
two."
In fact, March said last night, "It is
clear that we will have to eliminate at
least one language culture (English,
French, German, Hispanic or Italian)
area."
Eliminations necessary?
However, Overseas Studies Director
Mark. Mancall said "it is not necessar
ily the case" that an area would hae to
be eliminated. He said the Overseas
Studies Office is investigating alter
nate means of funding programs.
Also, other options to reduce costs,
such as charging students for transpor
tation to the overseas campuses, are
being considered to avoid the neces
sity of restructuring the programs.
In last night's interview, March
added that the committee has received
no formal proposals for programs in
Third World countries; however, he
considers Mexico to be the most likely
site.
Mexico is relatively accessible
economically, culturally relevant to a
substantial number of students, and
linguistically part of one of the desired
language/culture areas —Hispanic.
Failure in Peru
The Overseas Studies Office tried to
establish a program in the Third World
in 1974. However, after the first ses
sion at La Cattolica University in Lima,
Peru, the office was forced to discon
tinue the program in light of serious
questions about its academic quality
and unforeseen financial problems.
'March said he addressed the Senate
to confront it with the consequences of
the proposed budget cut. Mancall em
phasized that March's remarks were
merely March's opinions, not those of
C-FSP or the Overseas Studies Office.
March asked the senate to decide
whether the 40 percent cut is legiti
mate considering the academic objec
tives of the foreign studies programs.
The senate offered no collective re
sponse on whether the cutback is too
large, according to March. However,
he remarked, "There seems to be no

eagerness in the Provost's Office or the
Academic Senate to save money
elsewhere" to avoid such a massive cut
in the overseas programs.
Support for Beutelsbach
Criticism has met the Overseas
Studies Office's first major effort to cut
the budget — the elimination of the
Beutelsbach program this summer —
has angered students and faculty in the
program.
Yet March remarked that the deci
sion would not be changed "unless the
provost suddenly said we have twice
the money; the Provost is making the;
decision."
Terming the decision "hasty and
premature," the Beutelsbach adminis
tration and faculty in a letter to the
Overseas Studies Office accused it of
reflecting "a continuous bias against
program and location" and ignoring
"incontrovertible evidence of strong
and increasing student interest in this
non-urban German program."
Students presently in Beutelsbach
attacked the office's conclusion that
the Beutelsbach program is less cul
turally beneficial than programs in
other areas.
In another letter, they remarked,
"Over the years many close student
family relationships have provided the
Stanford students with first hand ex
perience with German life, and this life
is much more steeped in tradition and
culture in smaller towns like
Beutelsbach."
