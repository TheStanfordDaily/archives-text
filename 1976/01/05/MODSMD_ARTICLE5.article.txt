# University would fare better than most places
## Earthquake effects difficult to predict 
### MARK NASSUTTI 
The scene: Stanford University. Date: April 18,
1906. Memorial Arch lay crumbled in the outer
quadrangle. The new library was devastated. Only
its central dome was left standing.
The statue of biologist Louis Agassiz landed with
its head stuck in the concrete in front of Jordan Hall.
The stone gateways at the end of Palm Drive were
flattened. The beautiful facade of Memorial Church
had collapsed.
Almost 70 years later, seismologists and
geophysicists are still trying to find ways to predict
earthquakes. Engineers are trying to find ways of
making buildings earthquake-proof. How much
time is left before a repeat of the seismic jolt of 1906
wreaks havoc throughout the Bay Area?
Several newly completed buildings here were
totally destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, forcing
the University to close for a year. The new library,
the new gymnasium and Memorial Arch, among
others, were completely destroyed. Some alleged at
the time that poor workmanship was responsible
for much of the damage.
Construction to blame?
A report made to the Board of Trustees in 1908 by
a commission of engineers on the reconstruction of
the University buildings agreed that much of the
damage to the new buildings was caused by poor
construction and materials.
"Wall damaged and thrown out of plumb by
poorly constructed roof . . . crack of anchorage and
bond stones caused spreading apart of arches . . .
rotten ends of floorboards and joints" were among
the phrases used by the commission to describe the
1906 damage.
All the wrecked buildings were repaired or re
placed, and strengthening of undamaged buildings
has been an ongoing project since the earthquake,
according to the University Planning Office.
Most recently, the History Corner was evacuated
to allow for total remodeling. But the process of

strengthening old buildings has been a slow one, as
each has been remodeled as funds gradually be
came available.
'Difficult to predict'
If there were an earthquake today of the same
magnitude as the one in 1906, "there would be an
awful lot of damage," according to Asst.
Geophysics Prof. David Boore. "I don't know how
similar the effects would be. It's really very difficult
to predict what would happen where."
Boore said that it is difficult to know how a par
ticular building would react to an earthquake of a
given magnitude. Independent variables include
distance from the causative fault and the response
of the particular ground beneath the structure, ac
cording to a report published by the American As
sociation for the Advancement of Sciences.
The same survey predicted that another ear
thquake of the same magnitude of the 1906 quake
would cause $10-20 billion worth of damage in San
Francisco, not including possible fire and flood
losses. The report predicted that 3000 to 5000
people would die if the jolt came at the same time as
it did 69 years ago.
If it occurred, however, during business hours,
the quake could cause up to 20,000 deaths, the
report said.
Breakable dikes
In the South Bay area, extensive damage could be
caused by the breaking of dikes surrounding the
southern part of the Bay. The system of dikes,
owned by the Leslie Salt Co.. is used to protect
Leslie's salt-drying flats.
Communities near the dike system are threatened
even by a mild quake which could rupture the di
kes, made of mud and dredge, and flood cities such
as Alviso with up to eight feet of water.
Strengthening the dike system with concrete is
virtually out of the question because of the tre
mendous cost involved, which neither Leslie Co.
nor the local counties can afford, according to the

report.
The National Center for Earthquake Research,
operated in Menlo Park by the U.S. Geological Sur
vey, is developing the art of predicting where,
when and with what intensity earthquakes will
strike. A complicated system of seismographs,
tiltmeters, creepmeters, strainmeters, geodimeters
and magnetometers lace the area from Mexico to
Cape Mendocino along which the San Andreas
fault lies.
Seismologist Robert Nason said, "If an earth
quake was coming soon, I think I could tell. The
problem is, we just don't have much experience."
Well-equipped
According to a report prepared by a geophysics
student, Stanford is probably better equipped foran
earthquake than most California communities. Not
only does it have its own emergency services,such
as fire and police departments, but it also has well
supplied commissaries stocked with food. In case
an evacuation is necessary, it has shelters with
food. Thus the University is well-equipped to be
self-sufficient for several days after a major disaster.
As soon as order is restored after the jolt. Plant
Services would begin restoration and cleanup of
buildings. All available maintenance personnel,
gardeners and others would clean up rubble, repair
buildings and restore various services,
If the water supply is cut off, the University can
turn to its three reservoir lakes (Lagunita, Searsville
and Felt) and the Olympic pools can be used as a
water supply by the fire department in case of fire.
If electricity is cut off but the system for heating is
still in working condition, the University can con
vert to oil heating for several days, according to the
student's report.
If damages were not severe enough to cause a
break in the schedule of activities here, University
receiving is well stocked with everything from
buzz saws to pencil erasers with which to keep the
University functioning without external contact,
the report said.

HEADED EOR TROUBLE—A statue of biologist Louis Agassiz stands with the
scientist's head embedded in concrete outside Jordan Hall following the April
18,1956, San Francisco earthquake. Seismologists are attempting to predict
when the next serious quake will strike the Bay Area. It could kill more
than 20,000 in San Francisco and cause $10-20 billion in damage to the city
alone, they sav.
