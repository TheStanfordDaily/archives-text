# Assaulted rights

A number of recent actions
constitute an assault on the Bill
of Rights.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
a few weeks ago that police can
resume questioning a suspect
who has exercised his right
under the Fifth Amendment to
remain silent, as long as police
respect the suspect's right to
stop answering at any time.
The 6-2 decision, billed as
further defining of the 1966
Miranda decision, is actually a
further disintegration of the
right against self-incrimination.
The majority opinion felt "the
requirement that law enforce
ment authorities must respect a
person's exercise of that option
counteracts the coercive pres
sures of the custodial setting."
It's difficult to believe that the
court feels suspects, especially
the indigent and poorly edu
cated, will not submit to police
brow-beating and will know
which questions they shouldn't
answer. Following in the
footsteps of the court's "use im
munity" doctrine, the power of
the police and prosecutors is be
ginning to mushroom.
As Justice William Brennan
put it so well in his dissent, the
decision "can be viewed only as
yet another step toward the ero
sion and. I suppose, ultimate
overruling of Miranda's en
forcement of the privilege
against self-incrimination."
Sequestor the press
Freedom of the Press versus
the Right to a Fair Trial has be
come a more frequent and more
important issue during the last
few years.
A few weeks ago, Supreme
Court Justice Harry Blackmun
upheld a Nebraska court order
which prohibited newspapers
from printing confessions,
statements or the past criminal
record of a defendant during a
murder trial. Following that rul
ing, the full Supreme Court ag
reed to hear arguments in the
case in February.
Recently, senior U.S. Court of
Appeals Judge Harold Medina,
who was chairman of the Com
mittee of the Association of the
Bar of the City of New York that

issued the 1967 Freedom of the
Press and Fair Trial Report, has
authored an intriguing column.
Pointing out that gag rules
"merely lighten the burdens of a
busy judge or serve as a cover-up
to conceal corruption," Medina
gave "a little unsolicited advice
to the news media.
"First, I would stand squarely
on the First Amendment itself. I
used to think guidelines might
be helpful. Now 1 believe them to
be a snare and a delusion. And
the same is true of legislation.
"Second, I would make no
compromises and no conces
sions of any kind.
"Third, I say fight like tigers
every inch of the way."
It's a good thing Medina isn't a
reporter, or he, too, would
soon be gagged.
FBI
For all those who think FBI
crimes of the past have been con
signed to the history books,
don't hold your breath. Attorney
Cen. Edward Levi has proffered
some basic guidelines for future
FBI activities.
Even though the guidelines
are promising on the whole, one
is terrifying. Levi recommends
whenever there is "an im
mediate risk to human life or to
extraordinarily important gov
ernment functions some sort of
preventive action" could be ap
proved.
Thus the FBI could legally act
against individuals or groups be
fore laws had been broken.
The agents wouldn't be al
lowed to actually commit
crimes, but conceivably every
thing from lying to altering
streets signs would be permissi
ble.
Coupled with FBI Director
Clarence Kelly's recent remark
that "I will not abridge the rights
of any citizen without obtaining
higher approval or unless in ba
lance there would be a feeling on
my part that it would be a good
idea," these guidelines become
even more authoritarian.
The FBI will soon make the
CIA look like the Salvation
Army.
