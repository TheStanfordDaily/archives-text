# Gay freedom

The Everyman Center wishes
to express support for the Gay
People's Union (GPU) in its
quest for complete acceptance of
the right of all human beings to
express their own sexual prefer
ences.
We would like to publicly and
wholeheartedly support the
GPU in its attempt to add "affec
tional or sexual preference" to
the list of criteria which should
not be used by employers re
cruiting at the Career Planning
and Placement Center. We
would also like to commend the
Palo Alto Board of Education for
its recent decision to specify
"sexual orientation" as a factor
which it, as an employer, will
not consider in making hiring
decisions.
As men and women, we have
been compelled by society —
friends, peers, family, employers
and the media —to adopt certain
externally dictated roles,
whether or not we find them ap
propriate to our self concept.
The most obvious examples of
this are the sex-based
stereotypes of achiever
breadwinner for men and
supporter-servant for women.
Heterosexualitv is yet another
expectation placed upon us
which does not fit everyone.
Insidious oppression
That this is an insidious type
of sexist oppression is borne out
by the large number of gays still
"in the closet" because they do
not feel they can publicly affirm

their homosexuality.
Women who want careers and
men who want to be house hus
bands are rapidly being accepted
into our society.
Yet gays who feel comfortable
expressing their affectional pre
ferences in straight society are
few and far between.
The Everyman Center is a
group of men whcf'wish to break
the oppression of these
culturally-induced gender-role
stereotypes. This necessarily
means dealing with issues of
homophobia in heterosexual
males, as well as working to ac
cept fully the rights of homosex
uals of both sexes.
Discrimination against gays
by employers is a prime example
of society's pressure toward
heterosexuality (and against
homosexuality). Assuming that
the Stanford community is en
lightened enough to realize the
senselessness of anti-gay dis
crimination, can we condone
this type of prejudice on the part
of employers recruiting here?
Stating openness
And if employers — like the
Palo Alto Board of Education —
do not discriminate, why should
they object to stating their open
ness?
Freedom to express ourselves
as fulfilled human beings — gay,
straight or bisexual — is a neces
sity in a truly liberated society.
