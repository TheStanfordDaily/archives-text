# Reagan's views not libertarian
## 
### 
On CBS's Dec. 14 60 Minutes news prog
ram, former Gov. Ronald Reagan volun
teered that he was a "libertarian." But how
does Reagan actually stand on the liberta
rian fundamentals of civil liberties, the free
market and a noninterventionist foreign
policy?
Victimless crimes — Reagan is opposed
to legalizing marijuana. While in office, he
vetoed several bills that would have re
duced marijuana possession to a mis
demeanor and signed legislation that im
posed harsher penalties on black market sel
lers of drugs.
—Reagan is on record opposing legaliza
tion of prostitution and gambling.
Abortion — Reagan now says he regrets
signing California's abortion law.
Due process — Reagan has strongly
criticized Warren Court rulings that better
secured the civil liberties of the accused. He
denounced court decisions which by nar
rowing police "search and seizure" powers,
at least partly recognized an innocent per
son's home should be his or her castle.
—On Apr. 7, 1970, Reagan warned
against "appeasement" of campus de
monstrators. He said: "If it's to be a blood
bath, let it be now."
Governmental psychotherapy —The
Reagan administration, beginning in 1973,
supported a proposal for a Center for the
Study and Reduction of Violence, at UCLA.
The research center was to study behavior
deemed dangerous by the government and
to determine the most effective ways (drug
therapy, aversion therapy or whatever) to
control supposedly dangerous persons. It
was an academic endeavor like something
out of Clockwork Orange.
For example, researchers at the violence
center planned to make prophecies about
who in the population were going to be vio
lent so that those persons could be kept in
preventive detention.
In contrast, according to the libertarians'
view of law, a person is innocent until
proven responsible for some aggressive act.

Federal paramilitary activities —Reagan
was a member of the Rockefeller commis
sion which reviewed the domestic activities
of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Reagan's personal belief afterwards was
that the extent of CIA domestic spying was
neither massive nor a significant infringe
ment of Americans' freedom.
Reagan's stress is not on rolling back the
CIA, but on expanding the ClA's activities
to a global scale.
Right to bear arms —In 1967, Reagan
signed into law the Mulford Act, which
provided a penalty of one year's imprison
ment or a $1000 fine for anyone found with
a loaded gun in his possession on any pub
lic street or highway unless he could prove
that he was in imminent danger of harm.
Amnesty and the military —Reagan
favors conscription in wartime and opposes
unconditional amnesty for draft evaders.
Fair housing laws —On March 2, 1968,
Reagan announced he would veto any bill
that totally repealed California's fair hous
ing laws. Libertarians condemn bigotry as
irrational and repugnant.
However, human right to property neces
sarily includes the absolute right of the
owner to transfer the property as he or she
wills. Therefore, libertarians, in contrast to
Reagan, firmly oppose any governmental at
tempts to regulate or penalize discrimina
tion in the rental or sale of housing or in
other business activities.
Budget levels —During the Reagan ad
ministration, the California state budget in
creased an average of 12.2 percent a year;
Jerry Brown has increased the budget 4.6
percent (less than the rate of inflation). In a
television "Report to the People" on Feb. 4,
1967, Reagan promised a budget cut of $250
million from the amount Pat Brown had
spent the year before. Reagan went on in
stead to increase the budget that year by 24
percent.
Subsidies —Reagan supported
government-subsidized production of the
SST.

Bill Evers

Public education —Shortly after he was
first elected, Reagan announced he would
cut the regents' request for the University of
California by $82 million. But he quickly
backed down to a figure within $10 million
of the regents' own numbers.
—In 1971, Reagan said: "State aid for
public schools has gone up more in the last
four years than in any four-year period in
California history. From 1958 to 1967,
teachers' salary increases averaged 4.5 per
cent a year. Since 1967, they have averaged
seven percent."
Taxes —In September of 1966, Reagan
told Californians: "I am convinced that I can
say to you there will be no new tax increase
next year. The total tax burden will not be
increased." State taxes were raised in 1967.
—Reagan's fundamental approach is not
one of abolishing current "welfare state"
activities, but of having them financed and
controlled at the state level.
Foreign policy —Reagan does not sup
port the traditional libertarian foreign pol
icy of avoiding entangling alliances and
abstaining totally from foreign quarrels and
imperialist adventures.
—In the 19605, Reagan called for military
escalation by the United States in Vietnam.
—Reagan opposed efforts to resolve the
Pueblo incident peacefully, through dip
lomatic channels. He wanted military ac
tion.
—Reagan has termed peaceful, nor
malized relations with the Soviet Union "a
dangerous folly," and he is a sharp critic of
normalizing relations with Cuba.
—Reagan favors continued U.S. occupa
tion of the Canal Zone and continued sup
port of the socialistic canal enterprise itself.
—He is a militant interventionist when it
comes to the Middle East.
If Reagan would remedy his position on
these few matters, perhaps libertarians
would take more seriously his claim of
being a libertarian.

Budget levels —During the Reagan ad
ministration, the California state budget in
creased an average of 12.2 percent a year;
Jerry Brown has increased the budget 4.6
percent (less than the rate of inflation). In a
television "Report to the People" on Feb. 4,
1967, Reagan promised a budget cut of $250
million from the amount Pat Brown had
spent the year before. Reagan went on in
stead to increase the budget that year by 24
percent.
Subsidies —Reagan supported
government-subsidized production of the
SST.

Public education —Shortly after he was
first elected, Reagan announced he would
cut the regents' request for the University of
California by $82 million. But he quickly
backed down to a figure within $10 million
of the regents' own numbers.
—In 1971, Reagan said: "State aid for
public schools has gone up more in the last
four years than in any four-year period in
California history. From 1958 to 1967,
teachers' salary increases averaged 4.5 per
cent a year. Since 1967, they have averaged
seven percent."
Taxes —In September of 1966, Reagan
told Californians: "I am convinced that I can
say to you there will be no new tax increase
next year. The total tax burden will not be
increased." State taxes were raised in 1967.
—Reagan's fundamental approach is not
one of abolishing current "welfare state"
activities, but of having them financed and
controlled at the state level.
Foreign policy —Reagan does not sup
port the traditional libertarian foreign pol
icy of avoiding entangling alliances and
abstaining totally from foreign quarrels and
imperialist adventures.
—In the 19605, Reagan called for military
escalation by the United States in Vietnam.
—Reagan opposed efforts to resolve the
Pueblo incident peacefully, through dip
lomatic channels. He wanted military ac
tion.
—Reagan has termed peaceful, nor
malized relations with the Soviet Union "a
dangerous folly," and he is a sharp critic of
normalizing relations with Cuba.
—Reagan favors continued U.S. occupa
tion of the Canal Zone and continued sup
port of the socialistic canal enterprise itself.
—He is a militant interventionist when it
comes to the Middle East.
If Reagan would remedy his position on
these few matters, perhaps libertarians
would take more seriously his claim of
being a libertarian.

On CBS's Dec. 14 60 Minutes news prog
ram, former Gov. Ronald Reagan volun
teered that he was a "libertarian." But how
does Reagan actually stand on the liberta
rian fundamentals of civil liberties, the free
market and a noninterventionist foreign
policy?
Victimless crimes — Reagan is opposed
to legalizing marijuana. While in office, he
vetoed several bills that would have re
duced marijuana possession to a mis
demeanor and signed legislation that im
posed harsher penalties on black market sel
lers of drugs.
—Reagan is on record opposing legaliza
tion of prostitution and gambling.
Abortion — Reagan now says he regrets
signing California's abortion law.
Due process — Reagan has strongly
criticized Warren Court rulings that better
secured the civil liberties of the accused. He
denounced court decisions which by nar
rowing police "search and seizure" powers,
at least partly recognized an innocent per
son's home should be his or her castle.
—On Apr. 7, 1970, Reagan warned
against "appeasement" of campus de
monstrators. He said: "If it's to be a blood
bath, let it be now."
Governmental psychotherapy —The
Reagan administration, beginning in 1973,
supported a proposal for a Center for the
Study and Reduction of Violence, at UCLA.
The research center was to study behavior
deemed dangerous by the government and
to determine the most effective ways (drug
therapy, aversion therapy or whatever) to
control supposedly dangerous persons. It
was an academic endeavor like something
out of Clockwork Orange.
For example, researchers at the violence
center planned to make prophecies about
who in the population were going to be vio
lent so that those persons could be kept in
preventive detention.
In contrast, according to the libertarians'
view of law, a person is innocent until
proven responsible for some aggressive act.

Federal paramilitary activities —Reagan
was a member of the Rockefeller commis
sion which reviewed the domestic activities
of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Reagan's personal belief afterwards was
that the extent of CIA domestic spying was
neither massive nor a significant infringe
ment of Americans' freedom.
Reagan's stress is not on rolling back the
CIA, but on expanding the ClA's activities
to a global scale.
Right to bear arms —In 1967, Reagan
signed into law the Mulford Act, which
provided a penalty of one year's imprison
ment or a $1000 fine for anyone found with
a loaded gun in his possession on any pub
lic street or highway unless he could prove
that he was in imminent danger of harm.
Amnesty and the military —Reagan
favors conscription in wartime and opposes
unconditional amnesty for draft evaders.
Fair housing laws —On March 2, 1968,
Reagan announced he would veto any bill
that totally repealed California's fair hous
ing laws. Libertarians condemn bigotry as
irrational and repugnant.
However, human right to property neces
sarily includes the absolute right of the
owner to transfer the property as he or she
wills. Therefore, libertarians, in contrast to

policy?
Victimless crimes — Reagan is opposed
to legalizing marijuana. While in office, he
vetoed several bills that would have re
duced marijuana possession to a mis
demeanor and signed legislation that im
posed harsher penalties on black market sel
lers of drugs.
—Reagan is on record opposing legaliza
tion of prostitution and gambling.
Abortion — Reagan now says he regrets
signing California's abortion law.
Due process — Reagan has strongly
criticized Warren Court rulings that better
secured the civil liberties of the accused. He
denounced court decisions which by nar
rowing police "search and seizure" powers,
at least partly recognized an innocent per
son's home should be his or her castle.
—On Apr. 7, 1970, Reagan warned
against "appeasement" of campus de
monstrators. He said: "If it's to be a blood
bath, let it be now."
Governmental psychotherapy —The
Reagan administration, beginning in 1973,
supported a proposal for a Center for the
Study and Reduction of Violence, at UCLA.
The research center was to study behavior
deemed dangerous by the government and
to determine the most effective ways (drug
therapy, aversion therapy or whatever) to
control supposedly dangerous persons. It
was an academic endeavor like something
out of Clockwork Orange.
For example, researchers at the violence
center planned to make prophecies about
who in the population were going to be vio
lent so that those persons could be kept in
preventive detention.
In contrast, according to the libertarians'
view of law, a person is innocent until
proven responsible for some aggressive act.

Federal paramilitary activities —Reagan
was a member of the Rockefeller commis
sion which reviewed the domestic activities
of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Reagan's personal belief afterwards was
that the extent of CIA domestic spying was
neither massive nor a significant infringe
ment of Americans' freedom.
Reagan's stress is not on rolling back the
CIA, but on expanding the ClA's activities
to a global scale.
Right to bear arms —In 1967, Reagan
signed into law the Mulford Act, which
provided a penalty of one year's imprison
ment or a $1000 fine for anyone found with
a loaded gun in his possession on any pub
lic street or highway unless he could prove
that he was in imminent danger of harm.
Amnesty and the military —Reagan
favors conscription in wartime and opposes
unconditional amnesty for draft evaders.
Fair housing laws —On March 2, 1968,
Reagan announced he would veto any bill
that totally repealed California's fair hous
ing laws. Libertarians condemn bigotry as
irrational and repugnant.
However, human right to property neces
sarily includes the absolute right of the
owner to transfer the property as he or she
wills. Therefore, libertarians, in contrast to
Reagan, firmly oppose any governmental at
tempts to regulate or penalize discrimina
tion in the rental or sale of housing or in
other business activities.
Budget levels —During the Reagan ad
ministration, the California state budget in
creased an average of 12.2 percent a year;
Jerry Brown has increased the budget 4.6
percent (less than the rate of inflation). In a
television "Report to the People" on Feb. 4,
1967, Reagan promised a budget cut of $250
million from the amount Pat Brown had
spent the year before. Reagan went on in
stead to increase the budget that year by 24
percent.
Subsidies —Reagan supported
government-subsidized production of the
SST.

Public education —Shortly after he was
first elected, Reagan announced he would
cut the regents' request for the University of
California by $82 million. But he quickly
backed down to a figure within $10 million
of the regents' own numbers.
—In 1971, Reagan said: "State aid for
public schools has gone up more in the last
four years than in any four-year period in
California history. From 1958 to 1967,
teachers' salary increases averaged 4.5 per
cent a year. Since 1967, they have averaged
seven percent."
Taxes —In September of 1966, Reagan
told Californians: "I am convinced that I can
say to you there will be no new tax increase
next year. The total tax burden will not be
increased." State taxes were raised in 1967.
—Reagan's fundamental approach is not
one of abolishing current "welfare state"
activities, but of having them financed and
controlled at the state level.
Foreign policy —Reagan does not sup
port the traditional libertarian foreign pol
icy of avoiding entangling alliances and
abstaining totally from foreign quarrels and
imperialist adventures.
—In the 19605, Reagan called for military
escalation by the United States in Vietnam.
—Reagan opposed efforts to resolve the
Pueblo incident peacefully, through dip
lomatic channels. He wanted military ac
tion.
—Reagan has termed peaceful, nor
malized relations with the Soviet Union "a
dangerous folly," and he is a sharp critic of
normalizing relations with Cuba.
—Reagan favors continued U.S. occupa
tion of the Canal Zone and continued sup
port of the socialistic canal enterprise itself.
—He is a militant interventionist when it
comes to the Middle East.
If Reagan would remedy his position on
these few matters, perhaps libertarians
would take more seriously his claim of
being a libertarian.
