[ FIRST TIME EVER 1
Mr. Calculator is proud to announce the very first calculator trade-in offer. I
Now, you can bring in your old calculator — any make, any model, any
vintage (working or not) — and we will give you a $25.00 allowance towards
the purchase of a brand new Commodore SR4I4BR scientific notation elec
tronic calculator.
Compare the 14-character Commodore with 2-memories, exponent integer
increase and decrease, polar rectangular conversion, and so much more,
to the calculator you are now using.
Or — even compare it to the $99.95 Hewlett-Packard H.P. 21. At $79.95 the
Commodore SR4I4BR is a far more powerful machine and represents sub
stantial savings. And with its special trade-in allowance, you can own the
SR4I4BR for just $54.95. Complete with recharger, case and manufacturer's
full year warranty.
Never before has there been so much calculator for so small a price.
