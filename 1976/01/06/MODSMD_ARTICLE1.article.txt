# Fuel oil temporarily replaces gas
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The University yesterday used fuel
oil in its heating system instead of less
costly natural gas after its service was
interrupted by Pacific Gas and Electric
Company (PG&E).
Robert McKnight, plant services
manager of utilities, said the Univer
sity was without natural gas from 7
p.m. Sunday until 11 a.m. yesterday.
During those 16 hours the Univer
sity spent about $7000, twice the cost
of using natural gas, for 15,000 to
16,000 gallons of fuel oil, according to
McKnight.
Extra labor costs
"In addition, we had to double-team
the engineers working at the steam
plant," said McKnight. He.said the
cost of the engineers' overtime would
be released today.
McKnight said the utility company
has the authority to shut off gas to any
customer whenever a shortage exists.
According to McKnight, whenever
there is not enough gas to meet public
needs the utility company normally
switches from natural gas to fuel oil in
its own electricity generating plants.
If that action does not provide
enough gas to end the shortage, PG&E
must then stop supplying gas to some
of its larger customers.
PG&E decides which customer will
not receive gas under a complex rota
tion system which PG&E does not
make known to its customers.
Short notice
Consequently, the University can
not know when its gas supply will be
turned off until "practically the day
before it happens," McKnight said.
McKnight said he did not know why
the utility company does not give its
customers more notice. No PG&E offi
cial could be reached for comment.
"I am hopeful that this situation will
change in the near future," McKnight
said.

PC.&E already has cut off the Univer
sity gas supply twice during this
school year. During a 24-hour period
beginning in the jarly morning of Nov.
17 the University was forced to use
25,000 to 26,000 gallons of fuel oil at a
cost of about $11,500. The gas was also
turned off from 8 a.m., Dec. 31, to 8
a.m., Jan. 1. At that time, the Univer
sity spent approximately $9000 for
about 20,000 gallons of oil, according
to McKnight.
Gas service to UC-Berkeley was also
cut off on New Year's Day and yester
day, McKnight mentioned.
McKnight estimated that another
gas stoppage could occur "almost any
time in the next several months until
the weather changes."

sity spent about $7000, twice the cost
of using natural gas, for 15,000 to
16,000 gallons of fuel oil, according to
McKnight.
Extra labor costs
"In addition, we had to double-team
the engineers working at the steam
plant," said McKnight. He.said the
cost of the engineers' overtime would
be released today.
McKnight said the utility company
has the authority to shut off gas to any
customer whenever a shortage exists.
According to McKnight, whenever
there is not enough gas to meet public
needs the utility company normally
switches from natural gas to fuel oil in
its own electricity generating plants.
If that action does not provide
enough gas to end the shortage, PG&E
must then stop supplying gas to some
of its larger customers.
PG&E decides which customer will
not receive gas under a complex rota
tion system which PG&E does not
make known to its customers.
Short notice
Consequently, the University can
not know when its gas supply will be
turned off until "practically the day
before it happens," McKnight said.
McKnight said he did not know why
the utility company does not give its
customers more notice. No PG&E offi
cial could be reached for comment.
"I am hopeful that this situation will
change in the near future," McKnight
said.
Third cut-off
PC.&E already has cut off the Univer
sity gas supply twice during this
school year. During a 24-hour period
beginning in the jarly morning of Nov.
17 the University was forced to use
25,000 to 26,000 gallons of fuel oil at a
cost of about $11,500. The gas was also
turned off from 8 a.m., Dec. 31, to 8
a.m., Jan. 1. At that time, the Univer
sity spent approximately $9000 for
about 20,000 gallons of oil, according
to McKnight.
Gas service to UC-Berkeley was also
cut off on New Year's Day and yester
day, McKnight mentioned.
McKnight estimated that another
gas stoppage could occur "almost any
time in the next several months until
the weather changes."
The University yesterday used fuel
oil in its heating system instead of less
costly natural gas after its service was
interrupted by Pacific Gas and Electric
Company (PG&E).
Robert McKnight, plant services
manager of utilities, said the Univer
sity was without natural gas from 7
p.m. Sunday until 11 a.m. yesterday.
During those 16 hours the Univer
sity spent about $7000, twice the cost
of using natural gas, for 15,000 to
16,000 gallons of fuel oil, according to
McKnight.
