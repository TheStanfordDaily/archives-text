# Misconceptions of liberal universities
## J.A.K. Cave 
### 
I must take issue with William Ross' Dec.
2 column regarding the Howard report,
since it reflects a very common series of
misconceptions about liberal universities,
their function and their problems.
First, there is some doubt of the validity of
emphasizing academic ability. There are
two reasons for this: the issue of paper re
cords and the meaning of "academic in
stitution."
On the issue of paper records, there is
grave doubt as to the comparability of these
records, even if interpreted on the basis of
samples of past classes. Some of the best
universities, such as Cambridge, refuse to
consider them at all, except in a preliminary
fashion.
It is also not clear to what extent such
records, especially when they originate
from "feeder" schools (like Eastern prep
schools), measure the sort of "academic
ability" appropriate to academic achieve
ment as understood at the undergraduate
and post graduate levels. What must be
realized is that any competitive screening
system tends to reinforce certain types of
behavior, such as inferring the answers to
computerized tests from the wording.
Worth preserving?
The question is then whether the type of
behavior thus encouraged is worth pre
serving. (A better place to see the reductio
ad cibsurdum of such unnatural selection is
in premed programs.)
If not, and if "academic ability" as mea
sured in such records does not correspond
to "academic ability" as it is desired among
students, then we should cease to use such
records as sine quo non of consideration.
It must be recognized that academic in
stitutions exist and are encouraged by soci
ety for other reasons than the training of
academics. In fact one common observation
is that future academics form a diminishing
proportion of the student body here and ac
ross the nation.
Whether this is due, as some claim, to the
change in age distribution and consequent
dearth of academic jobs or a reflection of

salary differences, the fact remains that the
job of a university is to impart a liberal edu
cation.
Liberal education
Further, there is a sense in which a liberal
education is more important to, say, a
lawyer or politician than to an academic,
since most of the latter show little desire to
exceed the limits of their specialized train
ing.
A second sort of problem arises regarding
financial incentives for "top" students; a
sort of distributional echo of the above, with
implicationsforthe financial survival of the
University.
It is hard to see why elimination of finan
cial incentives will result in academic dis
aster.
It is surely not unusual forstudents bright
enough to get scholarships to lack applica
tion once they get to a university. Also, it is
often the case that such students will be
surpassed, both in terms of subjective
peformance and contribution to the intel
lectual life of the campus, by their less
brilliant, harder-working colleagues.
I would not argue for a university full of
the latter. But I would argue against their
exclusion a priori.
Economic value
Whether or not elimination of "financial
incentives" would spell intellectual (or
even academic) disaster, it can be argued
that it would not be so foolish economically.
As there is a certain tendency for wealth
to show up in paper qualifications (regrett
able as this is, it is still true), and to the
extent that intellectual potential (which the
Universityought. in some sense, to seek out)
is i ndependant of wealth, there is no reason
why the scale of aid awards should not re
flect this. The chances are it would reduce
the total amount of financial aid required to
induce the attendance of a given population
of students.
The rich are probably willing to pay more,
and the poor (in this given population) will
not change their expenditures, so the Uni
versity gains.

My last point has to do with the rather
incredible chain of reasoning stemming
from the observation that 15 percent of stu
dents rejecting Stanford do so because they
aren't offered enough money.
In the first place, there is nothing inevita
ble about the increase of this percentage
should the University decide to abolish "fi
nancial incentives"; in fact we should ask
the remaining 85 percent to what extent the
existing allocation and amount of funds in
fluences, however indirectly, their deci
sion.
Not buying degrees
Remember that students are not just buy
ing any degree, orany education, when they
decide to come here. They are buying a
Stanford degree and a Stanford education. It
is the quality of these which determine how
much they are willing to pay for the
privilege of coming here.
Secondly, this is also connected with a
person's estimation of the rate of increase of
tuition over the four-year course. The prob
lem is that having invested in the first few
years one is required to continue, since to
transfer to a cheaper institution would lose
the benefit of the first few years' investment
in a Stanford (or Ivy League) degree.
So the situation for people who make
their decision at least in part on the basis of
the increment to their future earnings will
be analogous to that of an investor faced
with cost overruns — pay more, or lose a lot.
The real issue is whether or not the old
inequities of "buying jocks" with athletic
scholarships should be met with a compen
sating inequity for academic (as opposed to
intellectual) athletes. It is useless to point to
those who were wrongly excluded by such a
system, or to those who were wrongly in
cluded.
However, one can hope for a bit more
thorough consideration of what is a serious
problem.

Secondly, this is also connected with a
person's estimation of the rate of increase of
tuition over the four-year course. The prob
lem is that having invested in the first few
years one is required to continue, since to
transfer to a cheaper institution would lose
the benefit of the first few years' investment
in a Stanford (or Ivy League) degree.
So the situation for people who make
their decision at least in part on the basis of
the increment to their future earnings will
be analogous to that of an investor faced
with cost overruns — pay more, or lose a lot.
The real issue is whether or not the old
inequities of "buying jocks" with athletic
scholarships should be met with a compen
sating inequity for academic (as opposed to
intellectual) athletes. It is useless to point to
those who were wrongly excluded by such a
system, or to those who were wrongly in
cluded.
However, one can hope for a bit more
thorough consideration of what is a serious
problem.

I must take issue with William Ross' Dec.
2 column regarding the Howard report,
since it reflects a very common series of
misconceptions about liberal universities,
their function and their problems.
First, there is some doubt of the validity of
emphasizing academic ability. There are
two reasons for this: the issue of paper re
cords and the meaning of "academic in
stitution."
On the issue of paper records, there is
grave doubt as to the comparability of these
records, even if interpreted on the basis of
samples of past classes. Some of the best
universities, such as Cambridge, refuse to
consider them at all, except in a preliminary
fashion.
It is also not clear to what extent such
records, especially when they originate
from "feeder" schools (like Eastern prep
schools), measure the sort of "academic
ability" appropriate to academic achieve
ment as understood at the undergraduate
and post graduate levels. What must be
realized is that any competitive screening
system tends to reinforce certain types of
behavior, such as inferring the answers to
computerized tests from the wording.
Worth preserving?
The question is then whether the type of
behavior thus encouraged is worth pre
serving. (A better place to see the reductio
ad cibsurdum of such unnatural selection is
in premed programs.)
If not, and if "academic ability" as mea
sured in such records does not correspond
to "academic ability" as it is desired among
students, then we should cease to use such
records as sine quo non of consideration.
It must be recognized that academic in
stitutions exist and are encouraged by soci
ety for other reasons than the training of
academics. In fact one common observation
is that future academics form a diminishing
proportion of the student body here and ac
ross the nation.
Whether this is due, as some claim, to the
change in age distribution and consequent
dearth of academic jobs or a reflection of

salary differences, the fact remains that the
job of a university is to impart a liberal edu
cation.
Liberal education
Further, there is a sense in which a liberal
education is more important to, say, a
lawyer or politician than to an academic,
since most of the latter show little desire to
exceed the limits of their specialized train
ing.
A second sort of problem arises regarding
financial incentives for "top" students; a
sort of distributional echo of the above, with
implicationsforthe financial survival of the
University.
It is hard to see why elimination of finan
cial incentives will result in academic dis
aster.
It is surely not unusual forstudents bright
enough to get scholarships to lack applica
tion once they get to a university. Also, it is
often the case that such students will be
surpassed, both in terms of subjective
peformance and contribution to the intel
lectual life of the campus, by their less
brilliant, harder-working colleagues.
I would not argue for a university full of
the latter. But I would argue against their
exclusion a priori.
Economic value
Whether or not elimination of "financial
incentives" would spell intellectual (or
even academic) disaster, it can be argued
that it would not be so foolish economically.
As there is a certain tendency for wealth
to show up in paper qualifications (regrett
able as this is, it is still true), and to the
extent that intellectual potential (which the
Universityought. in some sense, to seek out)
is i ndependant of wealth, there is no reason
why the scale of aid awards should not re
flect this. The chances are it would reduce
the total amount of financial aid required to
induce the attendance of a given population
of students.
The rich are probably willing to pay more,
and the poor (in this given population) will
not change their expenditures, so the Uni
versity gains.

My last point has to do with the rather
incredible chain of reasoning stemming
from the observation that 15 percent of stu
dents rejecting Stanford do so because they
aren't offered enough money.
In the first place, there is nothing inevita
ble about the increase of this percentage
should the University decide to abolish "fi
nancial incentives"; in fact we should ask
the remaining 85 percent to what extent the
existing allocation and amount of funds in
fluences, however indirectly, their deci
sion.
Not buying degrees
Remember that students are not just buy
ing any degree, orany education, when they
decide to come here. They are buying a
Stanford degree and a Stanford education. It
is the quality of these which determine how
much they are willing to pay for the
privilege of coming here.

the total amount of financial aid required to
induce the attendance of a given population
of students.
The rich are probably willing to pay more,
and the poor (in this given population) will
not change their expenditures, so the Uni
versity gains.

My last point has to do with the rather
incredible chain of reasoning stemming
from the observation that 15 percent of stu
dents rejecting Stanford do so because they
aren't offered enough money.
In the first place, there is nothing inevita
ble about the increase of this percentage
should the University decide to abolish "fi
nancial incentives"; in fact we should ask
the remaining 85 percent to what extent the
existing allocation and amount of funds in
fluences, however indirectly, their deci
sion.
Not buying degrees
Remember that students are not just buy
ing any degree, orany education, when they
decide to come here. They are buying a
Stanford degree and a Stanford education. It
is the quality of these which determine how
much they are willing to pay for the
privilege of coming here.
Secondly, this is also connected with a
person's estimation of the rate of increase of
tuition over the four-year course. The prob
lem is that having invested in the first few
years one is required to continue, since to
transfer to a cheaper institution would lose
the benefit of the first few years' investment
in a Stanford (or Ivy League) degree.
So the situation for people who make
their decision at least in part on the basis of
the increment to their future earnings will
be analogous to that of an investor faced
with cost overruns — pay more, or lose a lot.
The real issue is whether or not the old
inequities of "buying jocks" with athletic
scholarships should be met with a compen
sating inequity for academic (as opposed to
intellectual) athletes. It is useless to point to
those who were wrongly excluded by such a
system, or to those who were wrongly in
cluded.
However, one can hope for a bit more
thorough consideration of what is a serious
problem.

I must take issue with William Ross' Dec.
2 column regarding the Howard report,
since it reflects a very common series of
misconceptions about liberal universities,
their function and their problems.
First, there is some doubt of the validity of
emphasizing academic ability. There are
two reasons for this: the issue of paper re
cords and the meaning of "academic in
stitution."
On the issue of paper records, there is
grave doubt as to the comparability of these
records, even if interpreted on the basis of
samples of past classes. Some of the best
universities, such as Cambridge, refuse to
consider them at all, except in a preliminary
fashion.
It is also not clear to what extent such
records, especially when they originate
from "feeder" schools (like Eastern prep
schools), measure the sort of "academic
ability" appropriate to academic achieve
ment as understood at the undergraduate
and post graduate levels. What must be
realized is that any competitive screening
system tends to reinforce certain types of
behavior, such as inferring the answers to
computerized tests from the wording.
Worth preserving?
The question is then whether the type of
behavior thus encouraged is worth pre
serving. (A better place to see the reductio
ad cibsurdum of such unnatural selection is
in premed programs.)
If not, and if "academic ability" as mea
sured in such records does not correspond
to "academic ability" as it is desired among
students, then we should cease to use such
records as sine quo non of consideration.
It must be recognized that academic in
stitutions exist and are encouraged by soci
ety for other reasons than the training of
academics. In fact one common observation
is that future academics form a diminishing
proportion of the student body here and ac
ross the nation.
Whether this is due, as some claim, to the
change in age distribution and consequent
dearth of academic jobs or a reflection of

salary differences, the fact remains that the
job of a university is to impart a liberal edu
cation.
Liberal education
Further, there is a sense in which a liberal
education is more important to, say, a
lawyer or politician than to an academic,
since most of the latter show little desire to
exceed the limits of their specialized train
ing.
A second sort of problem arises regarding
financial incentives for "top" students; a
sort of distributional echo of the above, with
implicationsforthe financial survival of the
University.
It is hard to see why elimination of finan
cial incentives will result in academic dis
aster.
It is surely not unusual forstudents bright
enough to get scholarships to lack applica
tion once they get to a university. Also, it is
often the case that such students will be
surpassed, both in terms of subjective
peformance and contribution to the intel
lectual life of the campus, by their less
brilliant, harder-working colleagues.
I would not argue for a university full of
the latter. But I would argue against their
exclusion a priori.
Economic value
Whether or not elimination of "financial
incentives" would spell intellectual (or
even academic) disaster, it can be argued
that it would not be so foolish economically.
As there is a certain tendency for wealth
to show up in paper qualifications (regrett
able as this is, it is still true), and to the
extent that intellectual potential (which the
Universityought. in some sense, to seek out)
is i ndependant of wealth, there is no reason
why the scale of aid awards should not re
flect this. The chances are it would reduce
the total amount of financial aid required to
induce the attendance of a given population
of students.
