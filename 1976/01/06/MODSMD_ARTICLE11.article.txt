# Attacks against ERA weak
## Robert Montemayor 
### 
In its simple and bland man
ner, the Equal Rights Amend
ment (ERA) states the "equality
of rights under the law shall not
be denied or abridged bv the Un
ited States or by any State on ac
count of sex."
However, to hear groups like
Women Who Want to be Wo
men, the ERA is going to spell
disaster for females and forever
banish them from the confines of
their kitchens. It seems so ironic
that the greatest campaigns
against ERA "aggression"
should come from the women
themselves. Women, after all.
have been denied their equal
rights by men for countless cen
turies.
The numerous attacks
mounted on the ERA bv women
strike me as being quite hysteri
cal and non-rational, if not
downright blasphemous. ERA
opponents are looking no further
than the points of their noses
when they utter such demeaning
slogans as, "Keep mommy at
home — where she belongs."
You have only to look at the
facts and reason sensibly to
realize the impetus of the prop
osed amendment. The U.S.
House of Representatives passed
the Amendment Oct. 12, 1971,
by a vote of 354 to 23. and the
U.S. Senate followed suit by ap
proving it by a H4 to 8 count on
March 22. 1972.
In both cases, opponents tried
to add qualifying language to
limit the scope of the Amend
ment and were decisively de

feated time and again.
In Texas, the voters in 1972
passed the Texas Equal Rights
Amendment by a solid four to
one margin. It's been three years
and I haven't seen any of the hor
rible.damaging and cripplingre
sults the opponents have been
ranting about so wildly.
Joan Krauskopf, professor of
law at the University of Mis
souri. said the ERA will prohibit
a greater liability on one spouse
than on another simply because
of sex. It will not require both
husband and wife to contribute
the same amount of financial
support to a marriage, Krauskopf
said, because support obliga
tions are defined in terms of each
spouse's earning power and cur
rent resources.
Krauskopf further states that
since society has placed most
women in the role of
homemaker. most men will con
tinue to be responsible for sup
port of the family.
The objection that the ERA
will do away with alimony is of
course, absurd, as there are no
alilmony laws in many states.
However, even on a national
scale all the ERA will do is re
quire that men be eligible for
alimony under the same condi-

tions as women.
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) in a
1971 Senate debate said, "The
passage of the ERA would not
make alimony unconstitutional.
It would require a fair allocation
of it on a case-by-case basis. In
the great bulk of cases, women
would still receive alimony or
support payments."
And the ridiculous notion that
men and women will have to
share restrooms is beyond me.
States will continue to have the
power to require segregation of
the sexes for regulatory purposes
with respect to such facilities as
public restrooms, sleeping quar
ters at coeducational colleges,
prison dormitories and military
barracks.
Where the ERA will probably
make its greatest contributions
will be in education. It's com
mon knowledge women are dis
criminated against in admis
sions, curriculum, facilities,
counseling and placement.
Because of these practices,
women have long had a smaller
range of vocational and public
job training programs.
This fact is greatly magnified
when you examine the hiring
and salary practices for women
who have chosen teaching pro

fessions.
Scarcely more than one high
school principal in a hundred is
a women, according to a Na
tional Education Association
Research Report conducted in
1973. The NEA determined that
even in elementary schools,
where 85 percent of teachers are
women, 80 percent of the prin
cipals are men.
The same is true at the higher
educational level where a recent
study by the Graduate Records
Examination Board revealed that
male Ph.Ds receive an average
salary of $18,700 five years after
earning their degrees, in com
parison to women who earn an
average of only $16,400 for the
same time period.
The ERA will not force women
out of the home and into jobs.
Rather, in a country where
women comprise 40 percent of
the total labor force, it will only
allow women the same rights
and privileges that men have
been hoarding for so long.
What's more, 70 percent of
those women who work do so
because of economic necessity,
thus more reason to adopt the
ERA. Now all that's left is to in
stitute a Constitutional Amend
ment — with all its massive
legal, moral and symbolic im
pact — which can provide the
basis for the necessary changes
in our presently unequal laws.

In its simple and bland man

disaster for females and forever

have been denied their equal
rights by men for countless cen
turies.
The numerous attacks
mounted on the ERA bv women
strike me as being quite hysteri
cal and non-rational, if not
downright blasphemous. ERA
opponents are looking no further
than the points of their noses
when they utter such demeaning
slogans as, "Keep mommy at
home — where she belongs."
You have only to look at the
facts and reason sensibly to
realize the impetus of the prop
osed amendment. The U.S.
House of Representatives passed
the Amendment Oct. 12, 1971,
by a vote of 354 to 23. and the
U.S. Senate followed suit by ap
proving it by a H4 to 8 count on
March 22. 1972.
In both cases, opponents tried
to add qualifying language to
limit the scope of the Amend
ment and were decisively de

feated time and again.
In Texas, the voters in 1972
passed the Texas Equal Rights
Amendment by a solid four to
one margin. It's been three years
and I haven't seen any of the hor
rible.damaging and cripplingre
sults the opponents have been
ranting about so wildly.
Joan Krauskopf, professor of
law at the University of Mis
souri. said the ERA will prohibit
a greater liability on one spouse
than on another simply because
of sex. It will not require both
husband and wife to contribute
the same amount of financial
support to a marriage, Krauskopf
said, because support obliga
tions are defined in terms of each
spouse's earning power and cur
rent resources.
Krauskopf further states that
since society has placed most
women in the role of
homemaker. most men will con
tinue to be responsible for sup
port of the family.
The objection that the ERA
will do away with alimony is of
course, absurd, as there are no
alilmony laws in many states.
However, even on a national
scale all the ERA will do is re
quire that men be eligible for
alimony under the same condi-

Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) in a
1971 Senate debate said, "The
passage of the ERA would not
make alimony unconstitutional.
It would require a fair allocation
of it on a case-by-case basis. In
the great bulk of cases, women
would still receive alimony or
support payments."
And the ridiculous notion that
men and women will have to
share restrooms is beyond me.
States will continue to have the
power to require segregation of
the sexes for regulatory purposes
with respect to such facilities as
public restrooms, sleeping quar

prison dormitories and military
barracks.
Where the ERA will probably
make its greatest contributions
will be in education. It's com

counseling and placement.
Because of these practices,
women have long had a smaller
range of vocational and public
job training programs.
This fact is greatly magnified
when you examine the hiring
and salary practices for women
who have chosen teaching pro

Scarcely more than one high

Research Report conducted in
1973. The NEA determined that
even in elementary schools,
where 85 percent of teachers are
women, 80 percent of the prin

The same is true at the higher
educational level where a recent
study by the Graduate Records
Examination Board revealed that
male Ph.Ds receive an average
salary of $18,700 five years after
earning their degrees, in com
parison to women who earn an
average of only $16,400 for the
same time period.
The ERA will not force women
out of the home and into jobs.
Rather, in a country where
women comprise 40 percent of
the total labor force, it will only
allow women the same rights

male Ph.Ds receive an average
salary of $18,700 five years after
earning their degrees, in com
parison to women who earn an
average of only $16,400 for the
same time period.
The ERA will not force women
out of the home and into jobs.
Rather, in a country where
women comprise 40 percent of
the total labor force, it will only
allow women the same rights
and privileges that men have
been hoarding for so long.
What's more, 70 percent of
those women who work do so
because of economic necessity,
thus more reason to adopt the
ERA. Now all that's left is to in
stitute a Constitutional Amend
ment — with all its massive
legal, moral and symbolic im
pact — which can provide the
basis for the necessary changes
in our presently unequal laws.

In its simple and bland man
ner, the Equal Rights Amend
ment (ERA) states the "equality
of rights under the law shall not
be denied or abridged bv the Un
ited States or by any State on ac
count of sex."
However, to hear groups like
Women Who Want to be Wo
men, the ERA is going to spell
disaster for females and forever
banish them from the confines of
their kitchens. It seems so ironic
that the greatest campaigns
against ERA "aggression"
should come from the women
themselves. Women, after all.
have been denied their equal
rights by men for countless cen
turies.
The numerous attacks
mounted on the ERA bv women
strike me as being quite hysteri
cal and non-rational, if not
downright blasphemous. ERA
opponents are looking no further
than the points of their noses
when they utter such demeaning
slogans as, "Keep mommy at
home — where she belongs."
You have only to look at the
facts and reason sensibly to
realize the impetus of the prop
osed amendment. The U.S.
House of Representatives passed
the Amendment Oct. 12, 1971,
by a vote of 354 to 23. and the
U.S. Senate followed suit by ap
proving it by a H4 to 8 count on
March 22. 1972.
In both cases, opponents tried
to add qualifying language to
limit the scope of the Amend
ment and were decisively de

feated time and again.
In Texas, the voters in 1972
passed the Texas Equal Rights
Amendment by a solid four to
one margin. It's been three years
and I haven't seen any of the hor
rible.damaging and cripplingre
sults the opponents have been
ranting about so wildly.
Joan Krauskopf, professor of
law at the University of Mis
souri. said the ERA will prohibit
a greater liability on one spouse
than on another simply because
of sex. It will not require both
husband and wife to contribute
the same amount of financial
support to a marriage, Krauskopf
said, because support obliga
tions are defined in terms of each
spouse's earning power and cur
rent resources.
Krauskopf further states that
since society has placed most
women in the role of
homemaker. most men will con
tinue to be responsible for sup
port of the family.
The objection that the ERA
will do away with alimony is of
course, absurd, as there are no
alilmony laws in many states.
However, even on a national
scale all the ERA will do is re
quire that men be eligible for
alimony under the same condi-

tions as women.
Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) in a
1971 Senate debate said, "The
passage of the ERA would not
make alimony unconstitutional.
It would require a fair allocation
of it on a case-by-case basis. In
the great bulk of cases, women
would still receive alimony or
support payments."
And the ridiculous notion that
men and women will have to
share restrooms is beyond me.
States will continue to have the
power to require segregation of
the sexes for regulatory purposes
with respect to such facilities as
public restrooms, sleeping quar
ters at coeducational colleges,
prison dormitories and military
barracks.
Where the ERA will probably
make its greatest contributions
will be in education. It's com
mon knowledge women are dis
criminated against in admis
sions, curriculum, facilities,
counseling and placement.
Because of these practices,
women have long had a smaller
range of vocational and public
job training programs.
This fact is greatly magnified
when you examine the hiring
and salary practices for women
who have chosen teaching pro

fessions.
Scarcely more than one high
school principal in a hundred is
a women, according to a Na
tional Education Association
Research Report conducted in
1973. The NEA determined that
even in elementary schools,
where 85 percent of teachers are
women, 80 percent of the prin
cipals are men.
The same is true at the higher
educational level where a recent
study by the Graduate Records
Examination Board revealed that

salary of $18,700 five years after
earning their degrees, in com
parison to women who earn an
