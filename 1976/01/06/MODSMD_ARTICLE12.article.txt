I was appalletf to read in the
Dec. 7 issue of the Washington
Post that the Stanford student
body has voted to rename Stan
ford teams the Robber Barons.
The selection of the name
Robber Barons is most inapprop
riate and does not reflect the pre
sent character of the University
or its alumni. I am uncertain
whether the euphemism accu
rately describes the modern stu
dent body.
Although tin? role of the stu
dent body in a university is im
portant. the voice of its collec
tive past student bodies should
not be left unheard. I urge Uni
versity administrative officials
to make every effort to effectuate
a compromise on this important
issue.

May 1 suggest Red Baron in
stead of Robber Baron as a team
mascot. The title is well-known,
carries the association of daring,
emphasizes the team color, con
veys a sense of fun and avoids
the collective slur and patroniz
ing contempt for businessmen —
an entire social group — entailed
by the term Robber Baron.

Cartoon slur
Editor:
1 amappalled the Daily would
see fit to publish Robirt
Pacheco's most recent cartoon.
The message this cartoon is
supposed to convey is the obvi
ous degradation of the Native
Americans that would have ac
companied reinstation of the In
dian as Stanford's mascot.
Ironically enough, in this car
toon Pacheco has promulgated a
stereotype, degrading to asian
americans, by the "Made in Ja
pan" label he placed on the
souvenir Indian headband. The
blatant implication is that any
thing "Made in Japan" is cheap.
This is absurd. Some of the
finest consumer products avail
able today are manufactured in
Japan.
The Stanford community
needs to be made aware of the
ethnic slurs constantly being
thrust upon Japanese-
Americans.

George Anders' article on lan
guage course enrollment (Daily.
Nov. 25) was a welcome report
on a generally encouraging situ
ation.
Notably lacking, however,
was any information about en
rollment in Asian language
courses. Surely Japanese and
Chinese, part of the heritage of
Asian Americans, the languages
of two ancient and great cul
tures, and the languages of two
of the world's great modern
powers, merit some attention.
I hope that the Daily will re
port on enrollments in these two
languages.

his story, Registrar Sally
Mahoney could provide no in
formation on enrollment in the
Asian languages because the
computer printout did not dis
tinguish between literature and
language courses. We hope to
provide this information if and
when it becomes available.)

Chinese, part of the heritage of
Asian Americans, the languages
of two ancient and great cul
tures, and the languages of two
of the world's great modern
powers, merit some attention.
I hope that the Daily will re
port on enrollments in these two
languages.

his story, Registrar Sally
Mahoney could provide no in
formation on enrollment in the
Asian languages because the
computer printout did not dis

language courses. We hope to
provide this information if and
when it becomes available.)

I was appalletf to read in the
Dec. 7 issue of the Washington
Post that the Stanford student
body has voted to rename Stan
ford teams the Robber Barons.
The selection of the name
Robber Barons is most inapprop
riate and does not reflect the pre
sent character of the University
or its alumni. I am uncertain
whether the euphemism accu
rately describes the modern stu
dent body.
Although tin? role of the stu
dent body in a university is im
portant. the voice of its collec
tive past student bodies should
not be left unheard. I urge Uni
versity administrative officials
to make every effort to effectuate
a compromise on this important
issue.

May 1 suggest Red Baron in
stead of Robber Baron as a team
mascot. The title is well-known,
carries the association of daring,
emphasizes the team color, con
veys a sense of fun and avoids
the collective slur and patroniz
ing contempt for businessmen —
an entire social group — entailed
by the term Robber Baron.

Cartoon slur
Editor:
1 amappalled the Daily would
see fit to publish Robirt
Pacheco's most recent cartoon.
The message this cartoon is
supposed to convey is the obvi
ous degradation of the Native
Americans that would have ac
companied reinstation of the In
dian as Stanford's mascot.
Ironically enough, in this car
toon Pacheco has promulgated a
stereotype, degrading to asian
americans, by the "Made in Ja
pan" label he placed on the
souvenir Indian headband. The
blatant implication is that any
thing "Made in Japan" is cheap.
This is absurd. Some of the
finest consumer products avail
able today are manufactured in
Japan.
The Stanford community
needs to be made aware of the
ethnic slurs constantly being
thrust upon Japanese-
Americans.
