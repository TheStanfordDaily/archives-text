## Dreamy-eyed directors unify student dramatists 
### LAURA KENNEDY 
(Editor'snote: This is the second
in a three-part series exploring
the rise in student drama on
campus.)
The revival of the student
drama organization, Rams Head,
culminates the renaissance of
student-directed drama at Stan
ford that has occurred over the
last four years.
Every quarter, two or three
dorms each produce a play, usu
ally a musical comedy that re
quires a large cast.
The reasons behind this flurry
of dorm plays are complex, hut
the main motivation usually
boils down to one dreamy-eyed
person in the dorm innocently
asking, "Why don't we put on a
play?" More often than not, the
dreamer ends up a-director, and
the show is on.
"Next thing I know, I opened
my mouth and I was in over my
head," sophomore Simon San
chez said, describing how he
was "railroaded" into directing
Bye, live Birdie last quarter.
'No idea'
Friends approached Rob
Christopher last year, asking
him to direct The Music Man.
And "1 stupidly said yes," he

said. Although Christopher had
had some drama experience in
high school, his only college act
ing had been in a play auf
Deutsch at Beutelsbach. He took
on The Music Man, but "1 had no
idea what 1 was getting into at
the time."
The novice director's lack of
experience is covered over by his
enthusiasm and a judicious
amount of blind faith in his abil
ity.
Doug Bedard explained his in
itial motivation for directing his
first show Don't Drink the Water:
"Basically, it was cockiness."
Although only a freshman at
the time, Bedard had acted since
he was ten and played the leads
in high school and summerstock
musicals. However, he soon dis
covered that, despite his drama
background, directing was more
complex than it initially ap
peared.
Similarly, Paul Croves, having
acted in four high school musi
cals and a Savoyard operetta, did
not think there was too much in
volved in directing. Then he put
on Once Upon a Mattress as a
sophomore, and found himself
facing "one major catastrophe
every day."

I However, student directors
i find they learn a lot from solving
the castrophes of their first play,
and become bitten by the direct
• ing bug.
) Groves swore he would never
get involved in another musical
after his first show, but volun
teered to direct Finian's Rain
bow the next year. He is cur
rently directing his third play,
Camelot, to be presented next
week.
Bedard is also directing his
third show, Gypsy, this quarter.
He directed Mem of La Mcinchu
last year as a sophomore.
Bedard and Groves have been
able to direct all their plays for
the same house (Toyon and
Cedro, respectively). Both are
RAs and see the main purpose
of a dorm show as a unifying and
fun experience for the dorm.
Towards that goal, Paul Ed
wards, an RA at Roble, put on
The Man Who Came to Dinner
last quarter. Susie Malouf, an
RA at Arroyo and director of
Guys and Dolls, plans to direct a
play in her dorm spring quarter.
Unity
Even when Malouf directed
her first play Li'l Abner three
years ago as a sophomore, her
primary reason was not to de
velop actors, but to develop un
ity. Malouf said she thought it
would be good for the dorm and
would cut down the "red-hot"
atmosphere.
A basic problem confronting
directors of dorm plays is that
most of their actors have never
been on a stage before. Out of
Edwards' 25-member cast for his
play last quarter, only one had
college acting experience. Ed
wards said he discovered that "a
lot of directing boils down to
teaching basics of acting."
Bedard said of dorm novices:
"If they can't walk and chew
gum at the same time, I don't
take them, but that's never been
the case here. . . Anybody can be
taught to look good on stage —
that's the job of a director."
Student directors agree that
the only way they can pull off
successful shows is to assert
their authority, no matter how
much or how little drama train
ing they have had.
Novice
Christopher said the first job of
Music Man's production staff, all
of whom were complete novices,
was to "convince the cast we
knew what we were doing —
when we didn't." Although he

used the advice of veteran actors
in the cast and his assistant di
rector, the final decisions were
up to him.
"The only problem comes in
with too many directors," said
Christopher, who is determined
to be an assistant director for
Guys and Dolls rather than a
co-director.
Sanchez agreed with Christ
opher that the first thing a direc
tor needed to do was make him
self boss. While other members
of the cast are concerned with
one aspect of the show, "I know
the whole picture," said San
chez.
Still. Bedard warned that a di
rector in a dorm setting cannot
bean "overlord." When he was a
sophomore directing his second
play, Bedard's actors included
graduate students, causing him
to justify his directions.
Also, Bedard said he felt there
is no more director after opening
night; the actors do all the work.
In fact. Bedard instructs his cast
not to bring him on stage after a
performance. He does not need
the recognition: "Everytime that
audience applauds, it's applaud
ing for me."
Reward enough
Applause is enough reward
for student directors to work
single-mindedly on a play,
abandoning classes and
homework for two weeks before
the performance.
Groves, who said, "Sometimes
1 get to the point where 1 can't
think of anything but the play,"
got so far behind in his school
work during his first play that he
spent a weekend closeted in a
motel a la /'ciper Chase to catch
up.
Edwards, a hasher who is gen
erally involved in two or three
plays simultaneously, routinely
schedules a seven-week produc
tion schedule so he can study the
last two weeks of the quarter. His
solution to his busy schedule: "I
organize severely."
Why are student directors wil
ling to expend §uch time and ef
fort for no pay and no credit?
Sanchez tried to explain: "1
wanted people ... to hear the
applause, to hear the laugh
ter. .
His voice trailed off, a dreamy
look came into his eyes, and he
began envisioning his next play.
