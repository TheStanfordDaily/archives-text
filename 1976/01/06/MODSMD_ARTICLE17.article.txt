I am presently growing several marijuana plants
under Gro-lux lights. Two plants are from seeds
reported to he "pineapple gold." Now, at about
five weeks old, the youngest leaves are turning
bright yellow, and the plants are growing rather
slowly. I have done everything posible to provide
the best environment for my plants, and this con
dition disturbs me. What should I do?-A.S.
Our expert advice comes from Dr. Malcolm
Nobs, a researcher at the Carnegie Institution,
which specializes in plant biology. However,
Nobs asked you to bear in mind that he has no
specific experience with marijuana, so this in
formation is is for plants in general.
Many plants will suffer without a dark, period,
Nobs said. Your pineapple gold sprouts should be
getting about 16 hours of light and eight of dark
ness, which are ideal greenhouse conditions. In
addition, there should also be a slight temperature
drop during the dark period — about five degrees
centigrade, according to Nobs.

The Stanford fire chief's car has two red flashing
lights and one blue one. What is the blue one for?
Aren't the two red ones enough? Does the blue
light have a special function or is it just another
colorful toy?-Ti.T.
The blue light does serve an important func
tion. according to Asst. Fire Chief Harry, Lund. In
the event of a big accident or a fire, a unit on top of

the car will be elevated eight feet with the blue
flashing light on top of it. The light indicates the
officer in charge of the catastrophe.

Who is the Nathan Abbott for whom that Nathan
Abbott Way by the Law School is named? Is he the
smiling man with the bow-tie whom I've seen
rushing around Crown Quad occasionally?—E.H.
No, that's Tom Ehrlich. Nathan Abbott was the
first dean of the Law School. 1 ie served from 1894
to 1906.
