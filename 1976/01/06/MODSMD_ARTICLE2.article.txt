# N.H. legislators criticize Reagan

MANCHESTER N.H. (AP) — Ronald
Reagan met criticism by New Hamp
shire state legislators as he began his
first major campaign swing yesterday
through the state where he and Presi
dent Ford will meet head-on in the na
tion's first presidential primary.
Hours before Reagan's scheduled ar
rival in New Hampshire, the leaders of
both houses of the state legislature
criticized Reagan's proposal to turn a
variety of federal social programs to
the states and, thereby, reduce the fed
eral budget by $90 billion.
Reagan flew from Los Angeles to
kick off a three-day foray through the
snowy central and northern parts of
the state with an average of eight stops
scheduled each day and a town meet
ing each night.
First test
It will be the first major test for the
former California governor who an
nounced on Nov. 20 that he is chal
lenging Ford for the Republican presi
dential nomination.
Reagan is counting heavily on early
primary states — especially New
Hampshire with its Feb. 24 elec
tion and Florida which votes two
weeks later. He hopes strong showings
will sway Republicans from Ford.
The three days here are part of a
two-week Reagan tour covering 12,000
miles in New Hampshire. North
Carolina, Florida. Illinois and Wiscon
sin. Nine days this month will be de
voted to New Hampshire.
Plan criticized
The Reagan plan — which Reagan
aides admit may require additional
state taxes — may become a particu
larly sensitive issue in New Hamp
shire where there are no general sales
or income taxes.

Senate President Alf Jacobson and
House Speaker George Roberts — both
Ford supporters — called upon Reagan
to explain the program in detail during
his visit here. Roberts called it "a
scheme to attract attention" and Jacob
son said it was full of "broad
generalities."
The two Republican leaders argued
that Reagan's plan, which would en
tail financing many federal programs
at the state level, would require the
elimination of many necessary state
programs or a substantial tax increase
in New Hampshire.
'People opposed'
"I feel it's safe to say that, based on
recent votes of the legislature, the
people of New Hampshire are opposed
to the alternatives that would result
from Mr. Reagan's proposal," Roberts
said, citing state votes against new
taxes.
Jacobson and Roberts called on
Reagan to spell out his program before
state legislative committees so the
state might learn how the plan would
affect state finances.
Ford workers were believed to have
passed Reagan's in grassroots organiz
ing recently, but Reagan aides are run
ning a telephone-mailing effort aimed
at 90 percent of the state's GOP voters.
Reagan has the support of both Gov.
Meldrim Thomson and conservative
newspaper publisher William Loeb,
whose Manchester Union Leader is
the only statewide newspaper.
Ford has the endorsement of virtu
ally all the state's elected Republican
officials except for Thomson. Seven of
the 13 county and city party heads pol
led during the weekend said party
regulars in their areas favor the Presi
dent.

will sway Republicans from Ford.
The three days here are part of a
two-week Reagan tour covering 12,000
miles in New Hampshire. North
Carolina, Florida. Illinois and Wiscon
sin. Nine days this month will be de
voted to New Hampshire.
Plan criticized
The Reagan plan — which Reagan
aides admit may require additional
state taxes — may become a particu
larly sensitive issue in New Hamp
shire where there are no general sales
or income taxes.

Senate President Alf Jacobson and
House Speaker George Roberts — both
Ford supporters — called upon Reagan
to explain the program in detail during
his visit here. Roberts called it "a
scheme to attract attention" and Jacob
son said it was full of "broad
generalities."
The two Republican leaders argued
that Reagan's plan, which would en
tail financing many federal programs
at the state level, would require the
elimination of many necessary state
programs or a substantial tax increase
in New Hampshire.
'People opposed'
"I feel it's safe to say that, based on
recent votes of the legislature, the
people of New Hampshire are opposed
to the alternatives that would result
from Mr. Reagan's proposal," Roberts
said, citing state votes against new
taxes.
Jacobson and Roberts called on
Reagan to spell out his program before
state legislative committees so the
state might learn how the plan would
affect state finances.
Ford workers were believed to have
passed Reagan's in grassroots organiz
ing recently, but Reagan aides are run
ning a telephone-mailing effort aimed
at 90 percent of the state's GOP voters.
Reagan has the support of both Gov.
Meldrim Thomson and conservative
newspaper publisher William Loeb,
whose Manchester Union Leader is
the only statewide newspaper.
Ford has the endorsement of virtu
ally all the state's elected Republican
officials except for Thomson. Seven of
the 13 county and city party heads pol
led during the weekend said party
regulars in their areas favor the Presi
dent.
MANCHESTER N.H. (AP) — Ronald
Reagan met criticism by New Hamp
shire state legislators as he began his
first major campaign swing yesterday
through the state where he and Presi
dent Ford will meet head-on in the na
tion's first presidential primary.
Hours before Reagan's scheduled ar
rival in New Hampshire, the leaders of
both houses of the state legislature
criticized Reagan's proposal to turn a
variety of federal social programs to
the states and, thereby, reduce the fed
eral budget by $90 billion.
Reagan flew from Los Angeles to
kick off a three-day foray through the
snowy central and northern parts of
the state with an average of eight stops
scheduled each day and a town meet
ing each night.
First test
It will be the first major test for the
former California governor who an
nounced on Nov. 20 that he is chal
lenging Ford for the Republican presi
dential nomination.
Reagan is counting heavily on early
primary states — especially New
Hampshire with its Feb. 24 elec
tion and Florida which votes two
weeks later. He hopes strong showings
will sway Republicans from Ford.

two-week Reagan tour covering 12,000
