JOHANNESBURG, South Af
rica (AP) â€” South Africa joined
the television age last night with
its first full nationwide broad
casts after more than a decade of
controversy over the possible
corrupting influence of the elec
tronic medium.
An estimated one million
viewers watched the state
supported South Africa Broad
casting Corporation's "switch
on" more than a quarter of a cen
tury after television arrived in
most of the industrialized West.
Some 250,000 television sets
were sold in the last six months
of 1075. and officials estimate
four viewers were watching each
set for the five-hour opening
broadcast.
For most South Africans,
however, the excitement over
the "box" has little meaning.
The 18 million impoverished
blacks in urban townships and
the rural homelands or reserves
have no electricity in their
homes even if they could afford a
television set.
A color television set with a
lit)-im:h screen, the most popular
model, costs about $1000.
The service is bilingual, with
half of the viewing time devoted
to English programs and the
other half made up of shows in
Afrikaans, South Africa's other
official language.
First night programs included
the Bob Newhart show imported
from the United States, a local

variety show, programs for chil
dren, the Paris Symphony Or
chestra playing Chopin, news,
previews of shows to come, a
statement by Prime Minister
John Vorster and a religious
sign-off.
SABC-TV officials estimate

that more than $100 million has
been invested in the television
service, including an imposing
broadcasting center in Johan
nesburg. In addition, about $500
million has been spent to pur
chase programs and films from
Europe and the United States.
