# Working together...
## Join the 'Daily' 
### 
Every three months for the past three years
I've participated in a group effort to come up
with those catchy ads designed to attract
people to join the Daily.
Most of the time, the ads, which feature Daily
staffers in a variety of ridiculous poses, have
worked. Sort of.
Lots of students come in to our staff meet
ings and say they want to work for the Daily. In
the fall, we can usually count on 150-200
people coming in. But then something hap
pens, and, by the end of the quarter, we're
down to a skeletal crew of 25 hardcore and 50
marginal staffers. Not nearly enough.
Despite the grade-sacrificing heroics of the
overworked 25 hardcores, we're not as good a
paper as we could be. All too often, good
stories lie in the bin for want of a qualified
reporter, or grabbing photos don't get taken, or
we miss finding out what's going on some
where on campus. After all, when 25 people
are putting out a daily newspaper with high
editing standards (compare us with the
Chronicle) they don't have much time to get
out and report.
So what's our problem? Why does our attri
tion rate rival that of Jack-in-the-Box?
Maybe it's that the Daily is too much of a

social club.
Maybe it's that our senior staffers too often
brush off newcomers, or totally ignore them,
and that those people get very, very frustrated.
Well, what can we on the Daily staff do? Try
to open up to newcomers a bit more, try to train
people better, try to show people just how excit
ing and challenging working for the Daily can
be.
People did that for me when I was a
freshman, and it worked. The Daily, along with
its side benefits (a lot of friends, a writing job
with the Chronicle, some money, a feeling that
I know what's happening here and can influ
ence events) has been the best thing that's
happened to me at Stanford.
And what can you do? Obviously, the ans
wer is to join us, and persevere. Bring your
ideas as to what you'd like to see in the Daily,
push to see them executed, learn what jour
nalism is all about.
I hope I haven't scared you off. (If I have, you
probably shouldn't join us anyway.) We're
going to have a new staff meeting, Thursday at
3:15. Ideas welcome. Hope to see you there.

people better, try to show people just how excit
ing and challenging working for the Daily can
be.
People did that for me when I was a
freshman, and it worked. The Daily, along with
its side benefits (a lot of friends, a writing job
with the Chronicle, some money, a feeling that
I know what's happening here and can influ
ence events) has been the best thing that's
happened to me at Stanford.
And what can you do? Obviously, the ans
wer is to join us, and persevere. Bring your
ideas as to what you'd like to see in the Daily,
push to see them executed, learn what jour
nalism is all about.
I hope I haven't scared you off. (If I have, you
probably shouldn't join us anyway.) We're
going to have a new staff meeting, Thursday at
3:15. Ideas welcome. Hope to see you there.

Every three months for the past three years
I've participated in a group effort to come up
with those catchy ads designed to attract
people to join the Daily.
Most of the time, the ads, which feature Daily
staffers in a variety of ridiculous poses, have
worked. Sort of.
Lots of students come in to our staff meet
ings and say they want to work for the Daily. In
the fall, we can usually count on 150-200
people coming in. But then something hap
pens, and, by the end of the quarter, we're
down to a skeletal crew of 25 hardcore and 50
marginal staffers. Not nearly enough.
Despite the grade-sacrificing heroics of the
overworked 25 hardcores, we're not as good a
paper as we could be. All too often, good
stories lie in the bin for want of a qualified
reporter, or grabbing photos don't get taken, or
we miss finding out what's going on some
where on campus. After all, when 25 people
are putting out a daily newspaper with high
editing standards (compare us with the
Chronicle) they don't have much time to get
out and report.
So what's our problem? Why does our attri
tion rate rival that of Jack-in-the-Box?
Maybe it's that the Daily is too much of a

social club.
Maybe it's that our senior staffers too often
brush off newcomers, or totally ignore them,
and that those people get very, very frustrated.
Well, what can we on the Daily staff do? Try
to open up to newcomers a bit more, try to train
people better, try to show people just how excit
ing and challenging working for the Daily can
be.
