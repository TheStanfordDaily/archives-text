Pollution board fines AMC
LOS ANGELES — The state Air Resources
Hoard (ARB) fined American Motors $4.2 mill
ion yesterday forallegedly filing "clean" reports
on smog-producing "dirty" cars.
The ARH also banned sales effective midnight
tonight all California AMC Matadors, Hornets
and Gremlins equipped with 304-cubic-inch V-8
engines and announced an investigation into
the company's six-cylinder cars as well, to de
termine if American Motors has intentionally
falsified test reports.
"We have never seen so many dirty cars," said
ARH chairman Tom Quinn. "But even more
serious is the fact that American Motors submit
ted false reports to the state which indicated that
their cars were actually very clean." The state
requires auto makers to report on two percent of
all tfie cars they produce for California.
Company spokesmen in Detroit said the viola
tions had been inadvertent and that AMC has
cooperated fully with Quinn's agency from the
beginning. They called the fine "unreasonable."
Peter Guptill, zone manager for American
Motors' Los Angeles area, said 1200 cars in
about 100 dealerships throughout the state are
involved and AMC] is working on a solution.
"We feel we have the fix well in hand," he
said. "We have a car being tested in Detroit. It
shouldn't take too long. I'm told we'll be back to
normal by Feb. 1."
Armstrong to be ambassador
WASHINGTON — Former presidential coun
selor Anne Armstrong, wife of a Texas mil
lionaire, will be named as American ambassador
to Great Hritain, U.S. officials said last night.
A White House announcement is expected as
soon as formal agreement is given by the British
government.
Armstrong will be the first woman ambas
sador named by a major country to London, the
officials said.
She is the first American female ambassador
to be nominated to a major European embassy
since Claire Booth Luce, who was never con
firmed, was named to serve in Rome in the
19505.
Armstrong, 48, would succeed Elliot
Richardson as U.S. ambassador to the Court of
St. James's in London.
Armstrong was at one time the highest
ranking woman in the Nixon administration and
she is a former co-chairman of the National Re
publican Committee.
Judge opens closed court
NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — A judge reversed
himself and opened to the press and public the
jury selection proceedings that he had closed
earlier yesterday in a mass murder trial. A con
troversial press gag order in the case remains in
effect, however.
The gag order generally covers reporting of a
confession by defendant Erwin Simants, if any,
oranv other material strongly indicative of guilt.
News media appealed the order to the U.S. Sup
reme Court, which is expected to act this spring.
Selection of a 12-member jury to hear the case
of Simants, 30. of Sutherland, had begun behind
closed doors in Lincoln District Court after
Judge Hugh Stuart approved a defense motion
yesterday that questioning of prospective jurors
be closed to press and public.
But Stuart reversed his ruling after closed
door arguments on behalf of the media by press
lawyer Alan Peterson of Lincoln and after fears
of possibly prejudicial material arising during
the selection process apparently failed to
materialize.
A coalition of Nebraska news organizations
opposed the motion and asked for a temporary
restraining orderforcing the selection process to
be conducted in open court.

Peterson told newsmen following the pro
ceedings that the judge would speak individu
ally with each newsman covering the trial today,
asking that they voluntarily refrain from pub
lishing certain information disclosed in the jury
selection process.
Indians attack Gandhi ruie
NEW DELHI, India — Opposition political
leaders accused Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of
undermining parliamentary democracy yester
day as her government proclaimed her first six
months of emergency rule a glowing success.
The traditionally splintered opposition
showed rareantigovernment unity on the winter
session's opening day, which leaders of the rul
ing Congress party had thought would be li
mited to ceremony and a presidential address.
"Since the proclamation of the emergency,
this democracy has been twisted and per
verted," said independent member P.G.
Mavalankar, whose father was speaker of the
first Parliament after India won its indepen
dence from Britain in 1947.
More than half a dozen opposition leaders and
independents criticized the government and
complained about the continued detention of at
least 30 leading opposition legislators.
The emergency began last June 26 with arrest
of opposition leaders, suspension of most civil
liberties and imposition of press censorship.
Since then. Parliament has become the only
open forum in which opposition leaders can
speak, though they are heavily censored.
Gandhi, who listened to the criticism, com
plained in a brief address that in the past'some
irresponsible officials had abused their legisla
tive privileges and weakened Parliament.
"It has been our constant endeavor to preserve
Parliament's authority and to enlarge its capac
ity to deal with problems," she said.
The constitutional head of state, President
Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, delivered a
government-prepared speech defending the
emergency.
Doctors' slowdown begins
LOS ANGELES — Specialized emergency
services ground to a virtual halt at some private
hospitals yesterday while public hospitals re
ported a surge in patients as a doctors' protest
slowdown gathered momentum.
A loose coalition of doctors in Southern
California counties staged the slowdown to pro
test soaring malpractice insurance rates. The
slowdown began New Year's Day, but it was
difficult to measure its impact until yesterday
when many doctors returned from holiday vaca
tions.
Health officials said the slowdown's most
serious impact yesterday was in the San Fer
nando Valley north of downtown Los Angeles.
Leon Hauck. a spokesman for the Hospital
Council of Southern California, said a survey of
the organization's 234 hospitals in six counties
disclosed that 71 facilities wereaffected in some
way by the slowdown.
"It's mostly felt in the surgery schedule," said
Hauck, whose organization represents about
half the hospital beds in the area.
He said the effect has ranged from "very min
imal" to "very severe" and that 20 of 30 hospi
tals were experiencing some difficulties in the
San Fernando Valley with its huge population of
more than one million persons.
Harrises, ACLU sue police
LOS ANGELES — Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) members William and Emily Harris
complained yesterday that law enforcement
agencies had conducted a "vicious propaganda
campaign" to discredit them.

"The district attorney's office in Los Angeles,
the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department
have consistently tried our case in the media."
the Harrises said in a statement released during
an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) news
conference here.
ACLU attorneys Leonard Weinglass and.Mark
Rosenbaum also said the ACLU was tiling a $30
million civil rights lawsuit on behalf of the Har
rises, charging law enforcement officials with
releasing misinformation about the Harrises to
the press.
To be named as defendants, the attorneys said,
were the FBI, the Los Angeles County District
Attorney and the U.S. Attorney in San Francisco
and Sacramento.
The Harrises are charged, along with news
paper heiress Patricia Hearst, with 11 telony
counts of kidnap, assault and robbery in connec
tion with a shooting incident at an Inglewood
sporting goods store last May and an alleged
kidnaping in the aftermath.
Hearst currently is awaiting trial in San Fran
cisco on federal bank robbery charges and laces
trial in Los Angeles later.
Brown offers ballot plan
SACRAMENTO — A streamlined ballot pam
phlet could solve the state's dilemma of meeting
the federal Voting Rights Act without spending
tens of millions of dollars, the Brown administ
ration said yesterday.
J. Anthony Kline, Brown's legal affairs ad
visor, said he thinks "he can provide bilingual
and trilingual voter pamphlets in the affected 39
counties, but not necessarily translate the text of
bills.
"Approximately half of any given voter pam
phlet consists of the text of bills.
"Most important are the bill analyses and pro
and con arguments. Those we would translate.
But we would not translate into Spanish and
Chinese the actual text — the legalese — of the
bills themselves."
Kline said Brown would approve additional
funds for printing the multilingual pamphlets if
the plan gains approval from the groups repre
senting Spanish and Chinese language voters,
the U.S. Department of Justice and the state.at
torney general.
Sources said the additional cost to the state
would be no more than $1 million, far below
prior estimates.

EPA urges SST ban
WASHINGTON — The British and French
governments said yesterday that the environ
mental dangers posed by the Concorde super
sonic passenger jet were grossly exaggerated,
but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
urged that the plane be banned from U.S. air
ports where foreign airlines want it to land.
EPA assistant administrator Roger Strelow
told a public hearing that introduction of Con
corde service "runs directly counter to the noise
abatement and other environmental policies and
programs of the United States."
He said the plane would increase noise along
airport flight paths where the Concorde is used,
increase air pollution around, waste fuel and
possibly increase skin cancer by depleting the
earth's ozone layer, thus increasing ultraviolet
radiation from the sun.
Air France and British Airways have prop
osed offering two round-trips daily at New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport and one round
trip daily at Washington's Dulles International
Airport.
Blaze erupts at Pentagon
WASHINGTON — A fire broke out 50 feet
from the Pentagon's nerve center last night, but
firemen contained the blaze to a cafeteria area
while the military command kept working
without interruption.
The National Military Command Center, on
the second floor of the sprawling Pentagon, did
not evacuate personnel as firefighters from sub
urban Arlington County, Va., put out the blaze, a
Pentagon spokesman said.
Although there was extensive heat and smoke
damage, officials said no major parts of the
building were affected- through the building's
ventilator system, a spokesman said.
The fire began in a stack of plastic-covered
chairs outside the cafeteria, which was being
remodeled.
There was no official damage estimate and no
known cause for the blaze.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy through tomorrow. Slightly
cooler nights. Lows tonight in the 30s. Highs
both days in the 50s to low 60s. Variable wind 5
to 15 mph.
