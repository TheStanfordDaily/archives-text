# ASSU loses money on charters
## 
### LORI MATSUKAWA 
The ASSU Travel Service will be
forced to dip into its reserve funds to
pay for approximately $5000 of ad
ministrative expenses incurred this
fall, according to ASSU Travel Service
Manager Jay Farr.
The ASSU expected to pay the ex
penses and to add $15,000 to the re
serve fund with money from the
Christmas charters.
However, cancellation of the char
ters and subsequent reimbursement of
students prevented the ASSU from
adding the money to the reserve fund,
ASSU Financial Manager Chris Cline
explained in his quarterly financial
report at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
"The reserve fund allows us to go
out on a limb one more time. It gives us
the confidence to try diffe-ent things,"
Farr said.
He mentioned this year's Dallas
and fourth New York charter flights as
new projects.
Budget cut
Cline also reported that the Dean of
Student Affairs office may cut the AS
SU's $96,459 appropriation by approx
imately $42,000 this coming year.
"The exact amount is not deter
mined yet. The amount given to me by
(ASSU Dean of Student Affairs) Dan
Williams in a letter was $42,643. It's
fairly certain that the amount will be
near there," said Cline.
"I personally feel the reduction is
justified. We have no grounds for pro
test. We have interest-regenerating
abilities."
Cline added that Dean of Student of
Affairs James Lyons in recommending
the budget reduction amount to Wil
liams. felt "the major responsibility

should fall on us. It is possible for us to
continue on a day-to-day basis where
other programs would suffer."
Mascot selection
Regarding the mascot issue, Sen.
Tim Conway, chairman of the Senate
Mascot Selection Committee reported
no new developments.
At the last Senate meeting on Dec. 8,
Conway moved that the Senate Mascot
Selection Committee meet with other
factions of the community which have
an interest in the Stanford mascot,
come up with a suggested mascot and
hold a referendum.
"I'm having serious doubts about
having another referendum," said
Conway last night. "We have the (mas
cot) choices. We should contact the in
terest groups and select the mascot
from the choices we have."
Sen. Seth Foldy suggested that
Conway's whole committee and not
just Conway meet with the groups,
which include the alumni, Athletic
Department and Band, to discuss a
mutually agreeable mascot.
Investment policy meeting
In other committee reports, Finance
Committee Chairman Kevin McDer
mott announced a committee meeting
this week to discuss ASSU investment
policy and program fees.
"We should determine the invest
ment powers of the Financial Man
ager," McDermott said. He added that
the senate should enable itself to guide
the financial manager in his invest
ments.
"We must also set up guidelines and
restrictions" when it comes to prog
ram fees, McDermott continued. "We
have to be definite about what group
gets it and on what basis it gets it."
Currently, there are no rules guiding

the; senate on the specific qualifica
tions which programs must have in
order to be considered in the senate
program fee budget. Students vote
each spring on whether to fund the
program fee. If the fee passes then the
senate allocates it.
Committee vacancies
Senate Chairman Bill Hoke an
nounced that three vacancies are now
open on the senate nominations com
mittee. There is one position available
for a graduate, one for an under
graduate and one for an at-large candi
date.
A motion that appointments to the
nominations committee be postponed
until next week's meeting, awaiting
publication of the available positions
in the Daily, was approved with only
Foldy dissenting.
