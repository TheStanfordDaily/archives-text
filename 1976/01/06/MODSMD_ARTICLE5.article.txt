# Ford requests Angolan truce

### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) â€” President Ford
called yesterday for an immediate
cease-fire in Angola and warned that
continued Soviet intervention in the
African nation will damage relations
with the United States.
Making his first speech of the elec
tion year, Ford said that if Soviet activ
ity in Angola continues "damage to
our broader relations will be unavoid
able."
"We favor an immediate cease-fire,
an end to all, all outside intervention,
and a government of national unity,
permitting the solution of the Angolan
problem by the Angolans themselves,"
Ford told the annual convention of the
American Farm Bureau Federation.
He added that he feels that the prob
lem cannot be handled by cutting off
grain sales to Russia.
The President said it would be "a
serious mistake to assume that linking
our exports of grain to the situation in
Angola would serve any useful pur
pose whatsoever."
He argued that the Soviet Union can
get along without American grain and
that the impact of a grain cutoff
"would be felt after a long, long

period" and could not be expected to
produce short-term results.
Agriculture controls
Ford's speech was interrupted by
applause 19 times, although his audi
ence sat passively through the major
section dealing with Angola. The farm
crowd of about 5001) responded with
greatest enthusiasm when the Presi
dent endorsed legislation they favored
or when he asserted that there should
he "a minimum of government con
trols on agriculture."
Ford was accompanied to St. Louis
by Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz,
who told reporters aboard Air Force
One that he believes Ford will get the
farm vote this year because farmers are
prosperous and "like everybody else,
they vote their pocketbooks."
Large vote predicted
Butz predicted Ford would get about
(50 percent of the farm vote, as com
pared to 71 percent which he said went
to former President Richard Nixon in
1972. Explaining the apparent slip
pagefortheGOP cause, the agriculture
secretary said that Nixon's opponent,
Democratic Sen. George McGovern
"was poison to the farmers."
Ford's audience made it clear to him
that not all of his policies as President
have met with Farm Belt approval. For
example, there was derisive applause
when he noted that he had twice em
bargoed certain farm exports and pro
duced "confusion and concern among
some of our farmers."
Farm inheritances
The President was applauded twice,
by comparison, when he announced
that he soon will ask Gongress to
amend tax laws affecting the estates of
farmers "so that farms can be handed
down from generatin to generation
without the forced liquidation of fam
ily enterprises."
White House sources said Ford's
proposal would delay imposition of
estate taxes for five years, then stretch
out payments over 20 years, if a family
farm or business was valued at under
$300,000. The sources said there
would be some reduced tax conces
sions to farms or businesses valued at
$300,000 to $000,000.
