# Linen service resumes
## 
### 
Linen exchanges at dorms will resume Thursday, after being suspended
since Nov. 21 because of a strike at the National Linen Service's San Francisco
division.
The strike, involving truckdrivers, salesmen and supervisors, was settled
Dec. 22.
"Students should be able to get a rebate for the weeks missed," said Alex
McGregor, assistant manager of the division. However, James Harding, an
employe, said "wo haven't yet worked out a plan lor how the rebates will be
handled."
Kim Hastings, student manager for the firm's operations here, had specu
lated earlier that National would manage the refunds by "having forms for
students to fill out and send in." McGregor did not comment on this proposed
method.
Harding said he expects no problem when service resumes Thursday. "Ev
erything should go smoothly."
Schedules for the exchanges have been posted in all dormitories.
