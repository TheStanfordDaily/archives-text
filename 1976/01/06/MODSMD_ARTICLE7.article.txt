# Racial biases
## Rob Whalen 
### 
Recent court cases appear to
expose certain biases of the
white majority.
In the case Bakke vs. UC Re
gents, Bakke, a white, Sunnyvale
engineer, claiming he was de
nied admission to a UC Medical
school because of his color, sued
the UC Regents.Although√üakke
was not admitted, he essentially
won his case when the judges
ruled that his credentials should
be viewed without regard to
race.
I think this case demonstrates
the combined effects of indi
vidual and de facto racism of the
social structure of our society.
How can I say such a thing?
After all, wasn't this case all
about the elimination of dis
crimination, i.e. against whites?
Much concern
I have heard much concern for
the necessity to maintain equal
ity and protect the principles on
which this country wasfounded.
But where was the moral outrage
when for years blacks, Asian
Americans, chicanos, Native
Americans and women were
(andare) fighting fortheir equal
ity?
Perhaps of greater concern is
the shallowness of the case and
decision. In a society which
purportedly values equality,
why do we make it so incredibly
difficult for groups to overcome
centuries of bias and discrimina
tion?
Isn't it ironic that in this case,
by application of the Civil Rights
Act of 19(i4 (established to pro
tect minorities and to compen
sate for obvious discrimination),
the letter of the law was used to
defeat the spirit of the law? The
mere fact that official policies
needed to be established to pro
tect minority rights opened the
way to possible destruction from
lawsuits.
But how often have we seri
ously questioned the overall

admissions policies and criteria
of the University?
Racism has resulted in a na
tion where class and opportun
ity are determined by color. Our
economic and educational sys
tem forces the "economically
and educationally disadvan
taged" to fight it out for a few
available spots. And now it ap
pears these are in jeopardy.
Yet, as Robert Rosenzweig
pointed out in his Dec. 2 Daily
letter, the University is quite wil
ling to make exceptions when it
is in its interests, e.g. "skilled
athletes, faculty children and
perhaps others."
But let's not stigmatize affir
mative action and minorities by
alluding to socially- and
economically-biased tests. All
persons admitted to Stanford are
judged capable of satisfying the
University standards for gradua
tion.
System's changes
It seems we have evolved to
a system which excludes
minorities because race is not
considered. We have a long way
to go before the principles of this
country are applied with equal
justice.
Why doesn't Bakke sue the
American Medical Association
for limiting the number of medi
cal students? That's the prob
lem.
Our view is so biased we can't
even understand why Native
Americans are upset at using the
Indian symbol as a mascot. How
can minorities penetrate such
walls?
The legal system perpetuates
an intolerable status quo by de
ciding as it did in the Bakke case.
As Jesse Jackson said. "It's not
the bus, it's us."
Stanford, what are you afraid
of? Open up.
