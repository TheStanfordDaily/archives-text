# Teen drinking
## David Sartoris 
### 
Use of alcohol and marijuana
by teen-agers and even preteens
is reaching epidemic propor
tions across America.
A recent study for the National
Institute on Drug Abuse found
that among 14-and 15-year-olds,
use of marijuana more than dou
bled between 1972 and 1974.
Now at least one in five children
in that age group smokes pot.
In Charlotte, N.C., a survey re
vealed that about six percent of
the seventh graders drank either
daily or at least several times
each week.
Another study, sponsored by
the U.S. Public Health Service in
San Mateo County, showed that
more than half of all students in
grades 9 through 12 consume al
cohol ic beverages at least 10
times a year. More than one
fourth drink at least 50 times a
year, and among seventh grad
ers, roughly one in 12 drinks at
least this frequently.
Earlier age
A study of drinking in New
York City high schools con
cludes that not only are youths
starting to drink at an earlier age,
but those who start before the
seventh grade become more fre
quent and heavier drinkers than
those who begin later.
In Los Angeles County, 25
chapters of Alcoholics
Anonymous are composed sol
ely of teen-agers and 75 other
chapters have some teen-age
members.
Recent legislation has only
worsened the situation de
monstrated by these shocking
examples; many states have
lowered the legal drinking age,
usually from 21 to IH. In addi
tion, several have proposed a re
duction in the penalties for pos-

session or use of marijuana.
Clearly, this trend and its de
spicable consequences cannot
be allowed to continue. A return
to a drinking age of 21 might im
prove the situation somewhat,
since the IH-year-old is undoub
tedly a major supplier of
younger individuals.
In addition, more rigid en
forcement of current marijuana
laws would significantly di
minish its availability to youth.
Adult use
However, as long as such vices
are used by adult members of our
society, they will never be com
pletely out of reach for young
people. Effective implementa
tion of drug education programs
designed to emphasize the
health hazards of drugs and al
cohol is thus imperative in the
schools.
Efforts should also be made to
increase opportunities for in
volvement in extracurricular ac
tivities and after-school
employment — constructive al
ternatives to drinking and pot
smoking.
Nevertheless, the ultimate re
sponsibiity for elimination of
teen and pre-teen intoxication
rests with parents. Children
must be taught the evils of peer
pressure and that drugs are not
necessary for the "good life,"
long before they reach the age of
probable exposure.
More importantly, parents
must endeavor to set better
examples through their own ac
tions;a child is not likely to heed
warnings about alcohol when
his folks regularly have two or
three drinks before dinner.

grades 9 through 12 consume al
cohol ic beverages at least 10
times a year. More than one
fourth drink at least 50 times a
year, and among seventh grad
ers, roughly one in 12 drinks at
least this frequently.
Earlier age
A study of drinking in New
York City high schools con
cludes that not only are youths
starting to drink at an earlier age,
but those who start before the
seventh grade become more fre
quent and heavier drinkers than
those who begin later.
In Los Angeles County, 25
chapters of Alcoholics
Anonymous are composed sol
ely of teen-agers and 75 other
chapters have some teen-age
members.
Recent legislation has only
worsened the situation de
monstrated by these shocking
examples; many states have
lowered the legal drinking age,
usually from 21 to IH. In addi
tion, several have proposed a re
duction in the penalties for pos-

session or use of marijuana.
Clearly, this trend and its de
spicable consequences cannot
be allowed to continue. A return
to a drinking age of 21 might im
prove the situation somewhat,
since the IH-year-old is undoub
tedly a major supplier of
younger individuals.
In addition, more rigid en
forcement of current marijuana
laws would significantly di
minish its availability to youth.
Adult use
However, as long as such vices
are used by adult members of our
society, they will never be com
pletely out of reach for young
people. Effective implementa
tion of drug education programs
designed to emphasize the
health hazards of drugs and al
cohol is thus imperative in the
schools.
Efforts should also be made to
increase opportunities for in
volvement in extracurricular ac
tivities and after-school
employment — constructive al
ternatives to drinking and pot
smoking.
Nevertheless, the ultimate re
sponsibiity for elimination of
teen and pre-teen intoxication
rests with parents. Children
must be taught the evils of peer
pressure and that drugs are not
necessary for the "good life,"
long before they reach the age of
probable exposure.
More importantly, parents
must endeavor to set better
examples through their own ac
tions;a child is not likely to heed
warnings about alcohol when
his folks regularly have two or
three drinks before dinner.

Use of alcohol and marijuana
by teen-agers and even preteens
is reaching epidemic propor
tions across America.
A recent study for the National
Institute on Drug Abuse found
that among 14-and 15-year-olds,
use of marijuana more than dou
bled between 1972 and 1974.
Now at least one in five children
in that age group smokes pot.
In Charlotte, N.C., a survey re
vealed that about six percent of
the seventh graders drank either
daily or at least several times
each week.
Another study, sponsored by
the U.S. Public Health Service in
San Mateo County, showed that
more than half of all students in
grades 9 through 12 consume al
cohol ic beverages at least 10
times a year. More than one
fourth drink at least 50 times a
year, and among seventh grad
ers, roughly one in 12 drinks at
least this frequently.
