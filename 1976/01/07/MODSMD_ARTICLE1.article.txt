# Merged computer facilities 'threaten secret information'
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Unauthorized access to transcripts,
payroll records and other sensitive
University information could occur
because of a recent consolidation of
computing facilities here, according to
David Roode, a founder of the Stanford
Computing Club.
The University recently purchased a
large computer, an IBM System 370,
and plans to include both student and
administrative computing on the
machine. Previously, administrators,
including those in the Registrar's Of
fice, have used a separate computer.
Allowing students to use the new
machine could prove disastrous, said
Roode, a senior majoring in mathemat
ical sciences.
"It's only a matter of time before
somebody breaks the security system,"
Roode commented last night. "But
when that happens, all hell will break
loose."
Charles Dickens, director of the
Stanford Center for Information Pro
cessing (SCIP), which operates all
University computers, admitted that
students could pose a security threat.
'Like a safe'
"Certainly, it will be more likely that
students will somehow be able to get
access (to data) because they will have
physical access to the machine," Dic
kens said. "Secuxity is a matter of de
gree. It's like a safe or anything else —
what may be relatively secure today
may not be tomorrow."
Student transcripts will be kept off
the System 370 until further security
features are added, according to Regis
trar Sally Mahoney.
"Transcript .. . material is currently
on a (computer) in the basement of En
cina Hall. We're anticipating transfer
to the 370 in the spring; security-is one
matter holding up the transfer," she
said.
The technical knowledge needed to
break into the computer is currently
available, Dickens said, but security
systems are becoming increasingly
complex.
"We're trying to make it more dif
ficult — make the technical compe
tence (of a potential thief) higher,"
Dickens commented, "We're trying to
go ahead more than most institutions
like ours in the security field."
Poaching
Unauthorized use of information on
a computer, called "poaching," is il

legal — and threat of prosecution is a
major deterrent, according to James
Siena, legal adviser to the president.
"1 have reminded the directors of
computer facilities to advise us of any
actual or suspected case of'poaching,'
which we would then report to the dis
trict attorney," Siena said.
SCIP is complying with provisions
of the Buckley Amendment to protect
student privacy, according to Siena.
"Obviously, we do have an obliga
tion to provide adequate security. 1
have to trust in the judgment of those
who are responsible (at SCIP)," Siena
commented. "Should a breach of pri
vacy occur, the responsibility of the
University would be to take discipli
nary action against the offender."
But some "computer freaks" view
poaching as "a game or some sort of
technical feat," according to Dickens.
As a result, they will take calculated
risks to tamper with the computer.
Housing draw tampering
Last year, for example, problems de
veloped with the spring housing draw
run by the Dean of Student Affairs Of
fice.
"We were a little bit late; we were
unlucky," said one person who tried to
alter a draw number. "If we had gotten
to the results two days earlier, they
never would have known."
Mahoney said that transcript updat
ing would be done in a different man
ner from housing draw procedures,
thus making them safer from tamper
ing.
"We will have audit capabilities to
identify access to the files," Mahoney
said. "There is more than one backup
approach" to check tampering, she
added.
Eventually, a code system may be
implemented to further confuse
poachers, according to Wayne Bartlett,
data privacv and security officer at
SCIP.
Scramble data
"One item being considered is
scrambling of data — so even if some
one did somehow break into the file,
he still couldn't read it,Bartlett
explained.
"We're making good progress (in
security)," he added. With the old
computer system, "the philosophy
there was almost, 'Cee, let's make ev
erything public,' " Bartlett said.
Only a very "crude" security system
exists on the System 370 now, Bartlett

conceded. "Most of the security will
go in within two weeks and the rest
within the month."
But former poachers privately esti
mated that it will take anywhere from
two weeks to two years to break the
current system. Most agreed that — .it
the very least — University records
will be accessible for viewing by the
end of the year.
"To the extent that people think get
ting into a computer is fair game,
rather than an illegal act, there will be
problems." Bartlett reminded.
Separate machines?
According to Roode, the only sensi
ble method to prevent unauthorized
access by students would be to sepa
rate them physically from the compu
ter. This would require purchase by
the University of a separate machine
for academic use. he said.
"Two separate machines would givi;
security — keeping off suspect people,
people who have reasons to misuse the
data," Roode argued.

any data on the machine at will, Roode
maintained, thus posing another sec
urity problem.
"These things should be available
only on a need-tb-know basis; 21)0
people work for SCIP. and anyone who
works for SCIP can look at anything,"
he said.
Franklin agreed.
"Almost all the publicized cases of
computer security violations involved
computer center employes or ex
emploves," he said. "Ideally, I'd like to
get toa situation where we (SCIP) don't
have the key to the vault, where the
user gan encrypt his or her own data."
$1 million
A new computer for student use
would cost about $1 million, accord
ing to Gene Franklin, associate provost
for computing.
"The cost depends upon what it is
you would get and which services you
would provide. We have had a prop
osal to purchase a (computer) for
academic use, with a purchase price of
$1 million,"he said.
Clearly operating costs would be
about $HUO,OOO a year, Franklin said, a
figure which is comparable to current
annual expenses of approximately
$700,000.
Computers alone are not responsible
for security threats, Franklin main
tained.
"There's nothing unique to the
computer in security. Anyone who is
in Encina represents a potential sec
urity threat. Perhaps having a compu
ter adds another door . . . but it's not a
unique threat," Franklin said.
But Bartlett summed up an opposite
viewpoint held by many:
"1 really have a concern that, some
how, we've created an industry where
the image has come up that the compu
ter is fair game."
