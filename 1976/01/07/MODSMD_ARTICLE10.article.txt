# 'Daily' shouldn't judge
## Gary Maxwell 
### 
I am disappointed that the
Oliphant cartoon deleted from
the Dec.s Daily "promotedan un
fair racial stereotype." Yet 1 was
further disheartened to know
that the Daily took it upon itself
to judge this cartoon, sub
sequently scratching it from the
paper.
The importance of the con
tributions of the Daily to politi
cal and social issues cannot be
denied, yet the Daily must also
realize its responsibilities to the
Stanford community. Sponsored
directly by individuals and
businesses for the primary pur
pose of providing vital informa
tion, the Daily cannot, as a small
non-profit organization, sup
press or censor opinions that
should be provided to the com
munity (as do the corporate,
profit-hungry newspapers).
A more appropriate approach
to the cartoon problem would be
to print a protest of Oliphant's
stereotype, together with the car
toon, thus showing, and not forc
ing, the opinions of the Daily.
In any case, 1 too probably
would have been embarrassed
and angered by the Oliphant car
toon; however, how am I to form
an opinion of this cartoon if it is
not provided by the newspaper
that I and many others support?
It is the reader's right to judge
this cartoon, and not the Daily's.
For the Daily to act as Big
Brother, suppressing opinions at
its own discretion, is an insult to
and a total ignorance of the
wishes of the community which
sponsors its publication.
