# Motorcycle helmet law overprotective
## Alan Cranston 
### 
The federal government is threatening
to withhold from California $50 million
in highway funds because the state re
fuses to force motorcycle riders to wear
helmets — whether they like it or not.
This is an outrageous example of an
overbearing, overprotective bureaucracy
gratuitously trying to restrict the freedom
of choice of the individual and using the
clout of federal money to try to impose its
views on a state government. A state gov
ernment, by the way, which for eight
years running has turned down such
legislation as unnecessary and undesira
ble government intrusion into personal
conduct.
The threat to terminate federal finan
cial assistance because of noncompliance
with federally imposed standards is a se
vere sanction. If used at all, it should be
applied only for such overriding consid
erations as the protection of constitu
tional rights, to guarantee the integrity of
federal funds, and on behalf of public
health, safety and welfare when reliance

on individual initiatives by states,
localities and individuals is likely to
prove fruitless or self-defeating.
Fails test
The motorcycle helmet standard does
not meet this test. To require states to
enact mandatory motorcycle helmet laws
has little to do with protecting the public
against accidents caused by traffic
hazards and vehicle defects.
A helmet may or may not protect its
wearer, but there is no evidence that a
helmet alone will prevent accidents.
Some experienced riders suggest the con
trary — that the wrong type of helmet can
reduce the rider's ability to hear and see;
that heat and fatigue from its use create a
greater risk of accident.
I make no judgment about how much
protection a motorcycle helmet provides
the wearer — though a proper helmet ob
viously serves a valid protective purpose.
I note that the California Highway Patrol
and other California law enforcement
agencies require motorcycle officers to

wear helmets.
But I am informed that the helmets used
by the California Highway Patrol would
be illegal under the federal motorcycle
helmet standards! The CHP helmet, it
turns out, allows the rider to see and hear
too well!
Federal interest
The only legitimate federal interest is
whether California's refusal to enact a
motorcycle helmet law is endangering ir
responsibly the lives and safety of the
highway users of California and the na
tion. That is not the case.
The safety of the general public is not
enhanced by a mandatory motorcycle
helmet law. The public safety is far better
served by the state's strong licensing
program for motorcyclists, motorcycle
driver education course, the continuing
safety programs of motorcycle clubs, and
enforcement of state and local traffic reg
ulations. This program is effective.

California's accident rate is below the na
tional average and so is the death rate.
The California program currently is re
ceiving financial support from the De
partment of Transportation. The state has
been awarded $862,523 for a program to
demonstrate that requiring higher entry
skills for novice motorcyclists will sig
nificantly reduce accidents during the
first year of a driver's career. Under this
program some 18,000 novice cyclists
selected at random will undergo addi
tional licensing and training require
ments designed to improve their skills as
motorcycle operators.
It is ironic that with one hand, the De
partment of Transportation will provide
California with significant funding to cut
down on motorcycle accidents, while
with the other it threatens to terminate
those same funds for failure to enact a
helmet law which has little to do with
accident prevention.

The motorcycle helmet standard does
not meet this test. To require states to
enact mandatory motorcycle helmet laws
has little to do with protecting the public
against accidents caused by traffic
hazards and vehicle defects.
A helmet may or may not protect its
wearer, but there is no evidence that a
helmet alone will prevent accidents.
Some experienced riders suggest the con
trary — that the wrong type of helmet can
reduce the rider's ability to hear and see;
that heat and fatigue from its use create a
greater risk of accident.
I make no judgment about how much
protection a motorcycle helmet provides
the wearer — though a proper helmet ob
viously serves a valid protective purpose.
I note that the California Highway Patrol
and other California law enforcement
agencies require motorcycle officers to

wear helmets.
But I am informed that the helmets used
by the California Highway Patrol would
be illegal under the federal motorcycle
helmet standards! The CHP helmet, it
turns out, allows the rider to see and hear
too well!
Federal interest
The only legitimate federal interest is
whether California's refusal to enact a
motorcycle helmet law is endangering ir
responsibly the lives and safety of the
highway users of California and the na
tion. That is not the case.
The safety of the general public is not
enhanced by a mandatory motorcycle
helmet law. The public safety is far better
served by the state's strong licensing
program for motorcyclists, motorcycle
driver education course, the continuing
safety programs of motorcycle clubs, and
enforcement of state and local traffic reg
ulations. This program is effective.

California's accident rate is below the na
tional average and so is the death rate.
The California program currently is re
ceiving financial support from the De
partment of Transportation. The state has
been awarded $862,523 for a program to
demonstrate that requiring higher entry
skills for novice motorcyclists will sig
nificantly reduce accidents during the
first year of a driver's career. Under this
program some 18,000 novice cyclists
selected at random will undergo addi
tional licensing and training require
ments designed to improve their skills as
motorcycle operators.
It is ironic that with one hand, the De
partment of Transportation will provide
California with significant funding to cut
down on motorcycle accidents, while
with the other it threatens to terminate
those same funds for failure to enact a
helmet law which has little to do with
accident prevention.
(Alan Cranston is a Democratic U.S.
Senator from California.)
The federal government is threatening
to withhold from California $50 million
in highway funds because the state re
fuses to force motorcycle riders to wear
helmets — whether they like it or not.
This is an outrageous example of an
overbearing, overprotective bureaucracy
gratuitously trying to restrict the freedom
of choice of the individual and using the
clout of federal money to try to impose its
views on a state government. A state gov
ernment, by the way, which for eight
years running has turned down such
legislation as unnecessary and undesira
ble government intrusion into personal
conduct.
The threat to terminate federal finan
cial assistance because of noncompliance
with federally imposed standards is a se
vere sanction. If used at all, it should be
applied only for such overriding consid
erations as the protection of constitu
tional rights, to guarantee the integrity of
federal funds, and on behalf of public
health, safety and welfare when reliance

on individual initiatives by states,
localities and individuals is likely to
prove fruitless or self-defeating.
