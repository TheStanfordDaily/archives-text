# 'Incredible explosion'
## Lighter production burdens key to drama rise 
### LAURA KENNEDY 
(Editor's note: This is the
third in a three-part series
exploring the rise in student
drama on campus.)
Over the past four years,
Stanford theater has under
gone what Susie Malouf, a
four-year veteran of Stanford
acting, has called an "incred
ible explosion" of private,
student-directed plays.
A horde of drama-hungry
actors have not suddenly de
scended upon Stanford;
talented students eager to do
their own plays have, of
course, always existed on the
Farm.
Student-directed plays are
nothing new, hut they have
become more plentiful at
Stanford, because the finan
cial and technical burdens
involved in any play produc
tion have lightened in recent
years.
Not only have special or
ganizations sprung up on
campus to encourage student
drama, but the success of one
student play has made it
easier for producers of other
student plays to get money
and experienced personnel.
In a dorm play, money is
not the biggest production

problem, although costs can
run up to $500. An average
dorm musical costs about
$300 — a low budget even for
an amateur production, since
a dorm does not have to rent a
hall and almost always ig
nores paying royalties.
What is a problem for dorm
shows is technical assistance
and equipment. Often the
director is directing for the
first time, and has never de
signed or worked stage lights
before. Renting lights is pro
hibitively expensive, ranging
from $15-$2O a week for one
light. (A bank of lights for a
show may contain 15-30
lights.)
The Undergraduate Lights
Project (ULP) has solved
these technical roadblocks.
Founded in the spring of
1972, the ULP provides tech
nical advice and rents some
$9000 worth of equipment to
student plays for $1.25 per
light.
Trancos brainchild
The ULP grew out of a
SCIRE class and was the
brainchild of Alan Cox, pro
fessor of geophysics. At the
time. Cox was the Resident
Fellow of Trancos. and was
conducting a freshman drama

seminar for the house.
Trancos proved to be fertile
ground for theater innova
tions: the next spring, the
Stanford Savoyards, devoted
exclusively to Gilbert & Sulli
van operettas, were founded
by a Trancos RA, Mason
Blacher and another student,
Armand Galinskv. Like the
LJLP, the Savoyards grew out
of a SCIRE project.
The Savoyards' original
grant from SCIRE was $600
with the rest of their revenues
coming from ticket sales and
cast contributions. Savoyard
productions are much more
ambitious than dorm plays;
The Mikado, produced this
autumn, cost over $4000.
The Savoyards are unique
in that they gather their
cast and supporters from fa
culty and staff as well as stu
dents. Last spring's produc
tion of Ruddigore featured a
small part played by none
other than President Lyman.
However, other organiza
tions exist for campus-wide
private drama, albeit only for
students.
The Company was founded
a few years before the
Savoyards, sponsored by En
glish Prof. Larrv Friedlander.

It used to be more actively in
volved in putting on its own
shows, especially straight
drama. It still produces
shows, its latest being A Mid
summer Night's Dream last
quarter, but now the Com
pany acts more as a funding
organization for other student
theater.
Last year the Company
loaned the Music Man cast
$285 towards the show's final
cost of $950.
The Company also pro
vides set materials for many
dorm plays.
Rams Head, another
campus-wide private drama
organization, has a mammoth
budget of $7500 for its first
play, Guys and Dolls (to be
presented next quarter). Its
production staff has been
culled from the pooled talent
of dorm plays.
Soliciting producer
Guys and Dolls producer
George McMillan has been
gathering funds since Feb
ruary, and worked straight
through the summer, collect
ing approximately equal
amounts from SCIRE, Office
of the President, Dean of Stu
dents, Office of Public Af
fairs. Office of Humanities

and Sciences, ASSU Special
Events and ASSU Senate.
Like Guys arid Dolls' direc
tor Malouf, McMillan, now a
senior, lived in Trancos the
year the Savoyards were
created. He hopes that when
the "Trancos contingent"
graduates, the renaissance of
student drama will not die
McMillan need not worry
— not only do organizations
like the ULP remain to con
tinue encouraging student
directed drama, but the urge
to put on a play seems to be
contagious.
Gail Greely and Sheri An
derson were so inspired by
Cedro's production of Pi
nion's Rainbow that they de
cided the very next day to
produce The Music Man.
In turn, Simon Sanchez
added to his acting experi
ence by playing a lead in
Music Man, and was confi
dent enough to direct Bye,
Bye Birdie this year.
Greely and Anderson are
now contemplating a spring
production, and Sanchez is
eager to direct another play.
Doubtless, they will en
courage other students, and
the cycle of student-directed
drama will continue.

exploring the rise in student
drama on campus.)
Over the past four years,
Stanford theater has under
gone what Susie Malouf, a
four-year veteran of Stanford
acting, has called an "incred
ible explosion" of private,
student-directed plays.
A horde of drama-hungry
actors have not suddenly de
scended upon Stanford;
talented students eager to do
their own plays have, of
course, always existed on the
Farm.
Student-directed plays are
nothing new, hut they have
become more plentiful at
Stanford, because the finan
cial and technical burdens
involved in any play produc
tion have lightened in recent
years.
Not only have special or
ganizations sprung up on
campus to encourage student
drama, but the success of one
student play has made it
easier for producers of other
student plays to get money
and experienced personnel.
In a dorm play, money is
not the biggest production

problem, although costs can
run up to $500. An average
dorm musical costs about
$300 — a low budget even for
an amateur production, since
a dorm does not have to rent a
hall and almost always ig
nores paying royalties.
What is a problem for dorm
shows is technical assistance
and equipment. Often the
director is directing for the
first time, and has never de
signed or worked stage lights
before. Renting lights is pro
hibitively expensive, ranging
from $15-$2O a week for one
light. (A bank of lights for a
show may contain 15-30
lights.)
The Undergraduate Lights
Project (ULP) has solved
these technical roadblocks.
Founded in the spring of
1972, the ULP provides tech
nical advice and rents some
$9000 worth of equipment to
student plays for $1.25 per
light.
Trancos brainchild
The ULP grew out of a
SCIRE class and was the
brainchild of Alan Cox, pro
fessor of geophysics. At the
time. Cox was the Resident
Fellow of Trancos. and was
conducting a freshman drama

seminar for the house.
Trancos proved to be fertile
ground for theater innova
tions: the next spring, the
Stanford Savoyards, devoted
exclusively to Gilbert & Sulli
van operettas, were founded
by a Trancos RA, Mason
Blacher and another student,
Armand Galinskv. Like the
LJLP, the Savoyards grew out
of a SCIRE project.
The Savoyards' original
grant from SCIRE was $600
with the rest of their revenues
coming from ticket sales and
cast contributions. Savoyard
productions are much more
ambitious than dorm plays;
The Mikado, produced this
autumn, cost over $4000.
The Savoyards are unique
in that they gather their
cast and supporters from fa
culty and staff as well as stu
dents. Last spring's produc
tion of Ruddigore featured a
small part played by none
other than President Lyman.
However, other organiza
tions exist for campus-wide
private drama, albeit only for
students.
The Company was founded
a few years before the
Savoyards, sponsored by En
glish Prof. Larrv Friedlander.

It used to be more actively in
volved in putting on its own
shows, especially straight
drama. It still produces
shows, its latest being A Mid
summer Night's Dream last
quarter, but now the Com
pany acts more as a funding
organization for other student
theater.
Last year the Company
loaned the Music Man cast
$285 towards the show's final
cost of $950.
The Company also pro
vides set materials for many
dorm plays.
Rams Head, another
campus-wide private drama
organization, has a mammoth
budget of $7500 for its first
play, Guys and Dolls (to be
presented next quarter). Its
production staff has been
culled from the pooled talent
of dorm plays.

exclusively to Gilbert & Sulli
van operettas, were founded
by a Trancos RA, Mason
Blacher and another student,
Armand Galinskv. Like the
LJLP, the Savoyards grew out
of a SCIRE project.
The Savoyards' original
grant from SCIRE was $600
with the rest of their revenues
coming from ticket sales and
cast contributions. Savoyard
productions are much more
ambitious than dorm plays;
The Mikado, produced this
autumn, cost over $4000.
The Savoyards are unique
in that they gather their
cast and supporters from fa
culty and staff as well as stu
dents. Last spring's produc
tion of Ruddigore featured a
small part played by none
other than President Lyman.
However, other organiza
tions exist for campus-wide
private drama, albeit only for
students.
The Company was founded
a few years before the
Savoyards, sponsored by En
glish Prof. Larrv Friedlander.

It used to be more actively in
volved in putting on its own
shows, especially straight
drama. It still produces
shows, its latest being A Mid
summer Night's Dream last
quarter, but now the Com
pany acts more as a funding
organization for other student
theater.
Last year the Company
loaned the Music Man cast
$285 towards the show's final
cost of $950.
The Company also pro
vides set materials for many
dorm plays.
Rams Head, another
campus-wide private drama
organization, has a mammoth
budget of $7500 for its first
play, Guys and Dolls (to be
presented next quarter). Its
production staff has been
culled from the pooled talent
of dorm plays.

McMillan need not worry
— not only do organizations
like the ULP remain to con
tinue encouraging student
directed drama, but the urge
to put on a play seems to be
contagious.
Gail Greely and Sheri An
derson were so inspired by
Cedro's production of Pi
nion's Rainbow that they de
cided the very next day to
produce The Music Man.
In turn, Simon Sanchez
added to his acting experi
ence by playing a lead in
Music Man, and was confi
dent enough to direct Bye,
Bye Birdie this year.
Greely and Anderson are
now contemplating a spring
production, and Sanchez is
eager to direct another play.
Doubtless, they will en
courage other students, and
the cycle of student-directed
drama will continue.

(Editor's note: This is the
third in a three-part series
exploring the rise in student
drama on campus.)
Over the past four years,
Stanford theater has under
gone what Susie Malouf, a
four-year veteran of Stanford
acting, has called an "incred
ible explosion" of private,
student-directed plays.
A horde of drama-hungry
actors have not suddenly de
scended upon Stanford;
talented students eager to do
their own plays have, of
course, always existed on the
Farm.
Student-directed plays are
nothing new, hut they have
become more plentiful at
Stanford, because the finan
cial and technical burdens
involved in any play produc
tion have lightened in recent
years.
Not only have special or
ganizations sprung up on
campus to encourage student
drama, but the success of one
student play has made it
easier for producers of other
student plays to get money
and experienced personnel.
In a dorm play, money is
not the biggest production

problem, although costs can
run up to $500. An average
dorm musical costs about
$300 — a low budget even for
an amateur production, since
a dorm does not have to rent a
hall and almost always ig
nores paying royalties.
What is a problem for dorm
shows is technical assistance
and equipment. Often the
director is directing for the
first time, and has never de
signed or worked stage lights
before. Renting lights is pro
hibitively expensive, ranging
from $15-$2O a week for one
light. (A bank of lights for a
show may contain 15-30
lights.)
The Undergraduate Lights
Project (ULP) has solved
these technical roadblocks.
Founded in the spring of
1972, the ULP provides tech
nical advice and rents some
$9000 worth of equipment to
student plays for $1.25 per
light.
Trancos brainchild
The ULP grew out of a
SCIRE class and was the
brainchild of Alan Cox, pro
fessor of geophysics. At the
time. Cox was the Resident
Fellow of Trancos. and was
conducting a freshman drama

seminar for the house.
Trancos proved to be fertile
ground for theater innova
tions: the next spring, the
Stanford Savoyards, devoted
exclusively to Gilbert & Sulli
van operettas, were founded
by a Trancos RA, Mason
Blacher and another student,
