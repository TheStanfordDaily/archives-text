Xtv girl mul I triad something special for New Year's. We started
making love on December Jlst and timed it so that we both or
gasmeiJ starting at the stroke of midnight. Do you think we can get
our names in the newspapers for the first orgasm o/ (he bi
centennial year?
Now that's starting the New Year off with a bang. While some
people might be interested in knowing of your patriotic celebra
tion. my guess is that there are many couples who attempted
approximately the same thing. What's worse, all who succeeded
actually tied for the last orgasm of 1975. You see, due to slowdowns
in the Earth's rotation, scientists delayed all the atomic clocks in
the world one second precisely at 12:00:00 a.m. and 1976 didn't
actually start until 12:00:01. But don't despair. You can still try for
midnight next July 3rd.

I've heard that there are things called "poppers" which release a
vapor which causes orgasm. Do they really exist?
Amyl nitrate, a compound known tor its ability to dilate blood
vessels, comes in glass crystals. Breaking ("popping") them open
releases vapors, which are inhaled. This can cause headaches and
dei l eased blood pressure, but. according to Forum magazine, there
i> little chance they affect orgasms. Men might experience slight
increases in blood flow to the penis, but that's about all the excite
ment you'd get from them.

0.K.. so anal intercourse is safe. What about analingus?
For those who don't know, analingus is like cunnilingus, only
sort of backwards, and obviously can be performed on both men
and women. Analingus may have its dangers, however.
Like your mom also used to say. "Don't put anything in your
mouth il you don't know where it's been." That part of the body is a
veritable culture disk of fascinating bacteria, and if your mouth or
tongue come in contact with them, you can get sick.
