# Health hazards endanger thriving world blood trade
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. DC., —
(Pacific News Service) Like a red
Nile, the world market in human
blood is nearly overflowing its
banks. But this great river of
blood, extracted primarily trom
the world's poor to serve the
wealthy, has become polluted —
dangerous to both donor and re
cipient.
The world blood trade is brisk
and profitable for its merchants
— including commercial blood
banks and nearly all the major
international pharmaceutical
companies — earning them well
over a billion dollars a year.
Some 1,000 commercial banks
now supply over half of all blood
transfused in the U.S.
Demand for blood is rising
sharply in many wealthy coun
tries — the result of new blood
based drugs, growing traffic and
job accidents, more advanced

weaponry and new surgical
techniques like open-heart
surgery (in the U.S., 10 percent
of all blood supplies are wasted
by age). Much of this growing
demand is being filled by a rela
tively small number of the
poorest people in developing
countries.
But both recipients and
donors can be big losers in the
blood trade. Recipients — who
must pay from $50 to $150 per
pint of blood, or about 40 times
actual cost — may pay as
well with their physical health.
Donors also run great risk to
their health.
There are three basic systems
of blood extraction in the world:
volunteer, "inducement" and
commercial. Anonymous, free
volunteer systems are the least
used, though considered by
many health experts the safest

and most efficient. "Induce
ment" — exchanging fringe be
nefits for blood — is the second
largest method. By far the largest
is the commercial blood system,
in which donors are paid. And
the fastest growing sector of
the commercial system involves
the technique of plas
mapheresis.
First used a decade ago in
South and Central America,
plasmapheresis involves taking
whole blood from a donor,
separating the plasma from the
red cells, and reinjecting the
donor with the red cells. With
this method commercial blood
banks can now extract as much
as five or more pints of blood a
week from a single donor. The
technique is now common in all
parts of the world.
The long-term effects of plas
mapheresis on donors is un
known. Some short-term dan
gers include anemia, dehydra
tion, malnutrition, protein defi
ciency and impairment of the
body's natural defense
mechanisms.
Most plasmapheresis donors
are poor people from underde
veloped countries. Within the
U.S., most plasmapheresis
donors also come from the
poorest segments of society —
skid row denizens, prisoners
and the poorly nourished.
Blood banks, drug firms anil
hospitals compete for exclusive
bleeding rights among prison
ers; those who participate re
ceive special privileges or re
mission of sentence (in Mas
sachusetts, for example, a pris
oner's sentence is reduced five

days for each pint donated). Ac
cording to the World Health Or
ganization (WHO) "Poorer
people who can, for health
reasons, least afford to part with
their blood are encouraged to
give blood for the benefit of the
wealthier populations."
Many plasmapheresis donors
support themselves exclusively
by selling their blood. In the
U.S., they receive $5 to $12 fj a pint
(one plasmapheresis center in
Miami advertises. "Earn up to
$200 a month in your spare
time"). Hut blood banks seek
most of their supplies from
Third World countries, where
donors are paid only one or two
dollars a pint. In South India,
some 40.000 people maintain
themselves by selling blood.
Last May, WHO. urged its
member countries to stem "the
extensive and increasing ac
tivities of private firms in trying
to establish commercial blood
and plasmapheresis projects in
developing countries." WHO re
commended establishing na
tional blood services based on
voluntary, non-remunerati\ e
donations.
The commercial blood trade
has for years been beset by a
major health hazard — high in
cidences of serum hepatitis, a
debilitating and often lethal dis
ease for which there is no vac
cine or cure. Serum hepatitis can
be contracted from the whole
blood or plasma of a donor who
either has had the disease or has
lived where hepatitis is preva
lent.

tries — the result of new blood
based drugs, growing traffic and
job accidents, more advanced

weaponry and new surgical
techniques like open-heart
surgery (in the U.S., 10 percent
of all blood supplies are wasted
by age). Much of this growing
demand is being filled by a rela
tively small number of the
poorest people in developing
countries.
But both recipients and
donors can be big losers in the
blood trade. Recipients — who
must pay from $50 to $150 per
pint of blood, or about 40 times
actual cost — may pay as
well with their physical health.
Donors also run great risk to
their health.
There are three basic systems
of blood extraction in the world:
volunteer, "inducement" and
commercial. Anonymous, free
volunteer systems are the least
used, though considered by
many health experts the safest

and most efficient. "Induce
ment" — exchanging fringe be
nefits for blood — is the second
largest method. By far the largest
is the commercial blood system,
in which donors are paid. And
the fastest growing sector of
the commercial system involves
the technique of plas
mapheresis.
First used a decade ago in
South and Central America,
plasmapheresis involves taking
whole blood from a donor,
separating the plasma from the
red cells, and reinjecting the
donor with the red cells. With
this method commercial blood
banks can now extract as much
as five or more pints of blood a
week from a single donor. The
technique is now common in all
parts of the world.
The long-term effects of plas
mapheresis on donors is un
known. Some short-term dan
gers include anemia, dehydra
tion, malnutrition, protein defi
ciency and impairment of the
body's natural defense
mechanisms.
Most plasmapheresis donors
are poor people from underde
veloped countries. Within the
U.S., most plasmapheresis
donors also come from the
poorest segments of society —
skid row denizens, prisoners
and the poorly nourished.
Blood banks, drug firms anil
hospitals compete for exclusive
bleeding rights among prison
ers; those who participate re
ceive special privileges or re
mission of sentence (in Mas
sachusetts, for example, a pris
oner's sentence is reduced five

days for each pint donated). Ac
cording to the World Health Or
ganization (WHO) "Poorer
people who can, for health
reasons, least afford to part with
their blood are encouraged to
give blood for the benefit of the
wealthier populations."
Many plasmapheresis donors
support themselves exclusively
by selling their blood. In the
U.S., they receive $5 to $12 fj a pint
(one plasmapheresis center in
Miami advertises. "Earn up to
$200 a month in your spare
time"). Hut blood banks seek
most of their supplies from
Third World countries, where
donors are paid only one or two
dollars a pint. In South India,
some 40.000 people maintain
themselves by selling blood.
Last May, WHO. urged its
member countries to stem "the
extensive and increasing ac
tivities of private firms in trying
to establish commercial blood
and plasmapheresis projects in
developing countries." WHO re
commended establishing na
tional blood services based on
voluntary, non-remunerati\ e
donations.
The commercial blood trade
has for years been beset by a
major health hazard — high in
cidences of serum hepatitis, a
debilitating and often lethal dis
ease for which there is no vac
cine or cure. Serum hepatitis can
be contracted from the whole
blood or plasma of a donor who
either has had the disease or has
lived where hepatitis is preva
lent.
WASHINGTON. DC., —

Nile, the world market in human
blood is nearly overflowing its

blood, extracted primarily trom
the world's poor to serve the

dangerous to both donor and re

The world blood trade is brisk
and profitable for its merchants
— including commercial blood
