### CHRIS BAKER

The Pacific Kight Conference athle
tic directors were sitting in the Rose
Bowl press room last month discus
sing finances. "You know," said Ore
gon Athletic Director Pete Wingart
sipping a drink, "if it wasn't for bas
ketball, we couldn't make it up here."
In football season, the Pac-B's north
ern schools are the have nots, but with
each winter they become part of the
winningest basketball conference in
the nation:
Consider some facts:
—The conference's interactional
record stands at (i 1-22 for a .7115 mark,
third best in Pac-8 history.
—Kvery school except Stanford is
over .500 and three teams have lost just
one game.
—The conference has won five tour
naments.
—Three Pac-8 schools art; ranked in
the Associated Press Basketball Poll.
—UCLA was killed by Washington
last year, 103-81.
Had enough? So has Washington
CoachMarv I larshman, whose Huskies
art; the league's only undefeated team.
"Every year, the pre-season statistics
this conference runs up are awesome.
But let's get down to work."
Work, in this case the Pac-8 season,

begins tomorrow, when UCLA travels
to Oregon and IJSC visits conference
runnerup Oregon State.
Here is a look at the four northern
teams competing for illume vprious
prizes. The southern half-of the confer
ence will he evaluated in Friday's
Daily.
Oregon (7-8) — The Ducks were 9-0
at this point last year, but this year they
have traveled 14,000 miles during the
month of December. First it was a trip
to Hawaii, where Oregon Coach Dick
I liirter got a tasti; of what has been cal
led. "some of the worst officiating
since Dr. Naismith put up his peach
basket." Then Oregon took on Indiana
at home and traveled to Providence.
And United was on strike at the time.
At the start of the season Hatter pre
dicted that Duck All-American gtiard
Ron Lee would shoot 50 percent this
year. Lee, who seems to huve been
around Eugene for almost as long us a
graduate student, hasn't reached the
.500 mark yet. lie's averaging 18.4
points, two under his average last
year. But he still leads the Pac-8 in his
average this year. He also leads the
Pac-8 in assists and is one reason why
Oregon basketball games have been
sold out for three years.
Oregon State (7-4) The Beavers lost
their opening games on the* road to
fifth-ranked Nevada-Las Vegas and

Arizona, but they have won seven of
their last nine.
Beaver Coach.Ralph Miller got some
good news in late November,, when a
Federal District judge overturned an
injunction preventing All-Pac-8 for
ward Lonnie Shelton from playing.
Shelton claimed that he was locked in
a hotel room for 1 2 hours and forced to
sign a professional basketball contract.
When he decided that he wanted to
stay in Corvallis thi: year, the NCAA
won an injunction i kainst him. Put
Oregon State has won the legal battle
for now.
Despite these legal headaches. Shel
ton is fourth in conference scoring
statistics with a 17.8 average, second
in field goal percentage with a .593
mark and ninth in rebounding with a
7.9 average.
In the backcourt there's George
"lce-T" Tucker, but the ti-4 guard has
been as cold as his nickname, averag
ing 10.0 points per game. |C transfer
Rocky Smith. a 0-2 guard, makes up for
hiin. Smith, the California JC most val
uable player, is shooting at a .567
mark.
Washington (11-0) —Who would have
thought that the Washington Huskies
would be the league's only undefeated
teem? Certainly not Dog Coach Marv
Harshmanwhen he arrived at Huskie
practic s after coaching the US team in

the Pan American games. "We'll be a
better team, but it's hard to tell for
sure." he predicted.
Well the Huskies are currently
ranked eighth in the Associated Press
basketball poll and they were the first
non-Oregon team to win the Far West
Classic in Portland.
Forward James Fdwards is the main
reason. He's added an inch and now
stands seven feet tall and he's put on
20 pounds. He's averaging 17.5 points
per contest and he credits it to a "50
percent defensive improvement."
Washington State (0-2) Last year the
Cougar sports information office put
out one of the most colorful, if not
foolish press guides in the conference.
This year they went back to a simple
publication.
After a last place conference finish
(1-13), WSU coach George Raveling
has gone back to the simple stuff too.
The Cougars have toned down the
schedule, playing away from home
only once this year, and losing both
games in the Dayton Tournament.
Center Steve Puidokas, a second
team all-conference selection last year,
continues to lead WSU with a 19.4
scoring and a 12.4 rebound average.
"Steve is a true Ail-American." says
Raveling, always a master of the over
statement," if he's not Ail-American
he is at least All-Universe.

and is one reason why the Dogs are ranked eighth in the As

The Pacific Kight Conference athle
tic directors were sitting in the Rose
Bowl press room last month discus
sing finances. "You know," said Ore
gon Athletic Director Pete Wingart
sipping a drink, "if it wasn't for bas
ketball, we couldn't make it up here."
In football season, the Pac-B's north
ern schools are the have nots, but with
each winter they become part of the
winningest basketball conference in
the nation:
Consider some facts:
—The conference's interactional
record stands at (i 1-22 for a .7115 mark,
third best in Pac-8 history.
—Kvery school except Stanford is
over .500 and three teams have lost just
one game.
—The conference has won five tour
naments.
—Three Pac-8 schools art; ranked in
the Associated Press Basketball Poll.
—UCLA was killed by Washington
last year, 103-81.
Had enough? So has Washington
CoachMarv I larshman, whose Huskies
art; the league's only undefeated team.
"Every year, the pre-season statistics
this conference runs up are awesome.
But let's get down to work."
Work, in this case the Pac-8 season,

begins tomorrow, when UCLA travels
to Oregon and IJSC visits conference
runnerup Oregon State.
Here is a look at the four northern
teams competing for illume vprious
prizes. The southern half-of the confer
ence will he evaluated in Friday's
Daily.
Oregon (7-8) — The Ducks were 9-0
at this point last year, but this year they
have traveled 14,000 miles during the
month of December. First it was a trip
to Hawaii, where Oregon Coach Dick
I liirter got a tasti; of what has been cal
led. "some of the worst officiating
since Dr. Naismith put up his peach
basket." Then Oregon took on Indiana
at home and traveled to Providence.
And United was on strike at the time.
At the start of the season Hatter pre
dicted that Duck All-American gtiard
Ron Lee would shoot 50 percent this
year. Lee, who seems to huve been
around Eugene for almost as long us a
graduate student, hasn't reached the
.500 mark yet. lie's averaging 18.4
points, two under his average last
year. But he still leads the Pac-8 in his
average this year. He also leads the
Pac-8 in assists and is one reason why
Oregon basketball games have been
sold out for three years.
Oregon State (7-4) The Beavers lost
their opening games on the* road to
fifth-ranked Nevada-Las Vegas and

Arizona, but they have won seven of
their last nine.
Beaver Coach.Ralph Miller got some
good news in late November,, when a
Federal District judge overturned an
injunction preventing All-Pac-8 for
ward Lonnie Shelton from playing.
Shelton claimed that he was locked in
a hotel room for 1 2 hours and forced to
sign a professional basketball contract.
When he decided that he wanted to
stay in Corvallis thi: year, the NCAA
won an injunction i kainst him. Put
Oregon State has won the legal battle
for now.
Despite these legal headaches. Shel
ton is fourth in conference scoring
statistics with a 17.8 average, second
in field goal percentage with a .593
mark and ninth in rebounding with a
7.9 average.
In the backcourt there's George
"lce-T" Tucker, but the ti-4 guard has
been as cold as his nickname, averag
ing 10.0 points per game. |C transfer
Rocky Smith. a 0-2 guard, makes up for
hiin. Smith, the California JC most val
uable player, is shooting at a .567
mark.
Washington (11-0) —Who would have
thought that the Washington Huskies
would be the league's only undefeated
teem? Certainly not Dog Coach Marv
Harshmanwhen he arrived at Huskie
practic s after coaching the US team in

the Pan American games. "We'll be a
better team, but it's hard to tell for
sure." he predicted.
Well the Huskies are currently
ranked eighth in the Associated Press
basketball poll and they were the first
non-Oregon team to win the Far West
Classic in Portland.
Forward James Fdwards is the main
reason. He's added an inch and now
stands seven feet tall and he's put on
20 pounds. He's averaging 17.5 points
per contest and he credits it to a "50
percent defensive improvement."
Washington State (0-2) Last year the
Cougar sports information office put
out one of the most colorful, if not
foolish press guides in the conference.
This year they went back to a simple
publication.
After a last place conference finish
(1-13), WSU coach George Raveling
has gone back to the simple stuff too.
The Cougars have toned down the
schedule, playing away from home
only once this year, and losing both
games in the Dayton Tournament.
Center Steve Puidokas, a second
team all-conference selection last year,
continues to lead WSU with a 19.4
scoring and a 12.4 rebound average.
"Steve is a true Ail-American." says
Raveling, always a master of the over
statement," if he's not Ail-American
he is at least All-Universe.
