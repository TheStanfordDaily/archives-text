# Committee offers Nixon, Davis spring guest teaching positions
## 
### DANA CURRY 
Richard Nixon, Angela Davis, I.F.
Stone and Allan Ginsberg are among
those invited to teach here spring quar
ter, according to senior Andrea Halli
day of the ASSU Guest Professorship
Board.
No positive responses have been re
ceived yet to the approximately 35 in
vitations mailed out by the board over
Christmas vacation, Halliday said.
Five invitees so far, including Stone,
have declined the invitation.
Others invited include Monthly Re
view editor Paul Sweezy, Yale Prof.
Stanley Milgrim, author Robin Mor
gan and Massachusetts state legislator
Elaine Noble.
Nearly $10,000 is available to spon
sor guest professors, explained senior
Blythe Mickelson, another board
member.
The money is left over from a fee
assessment passed in the winter 1974
which was intended to sponsor South
Vietnamese journalist Nyugen Huu
Thai. He has not been allowed to leave
South Vietnam, and subsequent at
tempts to bring Chilean political pris
oner Hermann Schwember to campus
were also unsuccessful.
'Non-traditional subjects'
The intent of the Guest Professor
ship Program is to "attract people who

will teach non-traditional subjects,"
according to Halliday.
Responses to the letters of invitation
are expected to come to the board
within the next two weeks or "a month
at the latest," Halliday said.
"After we receive all the responses,
we will try for departmental sponsor
ships to help stretch the money," she
added.
In order to bring a number of guest
professors to campus, the board hopes
to sponsor several part-time positions,
with matching funds possibly coming
from various departments.
Undergraduate instruction will be
emphasized, with limits on the class
sizes of the guest professors, Halliday
said. The guest professors would also
be given opportunities for speaking
engagements so they could reach the
whole University, she explained.
Everyone invited
Suggestions for guest professors
came from students, professors and
members of the Guest Professorship
Hoard during fall quarter and "a letter
of invitation was sent to every person
suggested," according to Mickelson.
The only foreign political prisoner
invited was another Chilean professor
who has been teaching in Ohio since
his release, Halliday said.
"Since the fee assessment is two

years old, we weren't bound to just
invite political prisoners," she said.
After acceptances are received, the
Guest Professorship Board will make
recommendations to the ASSU Senate,
which will make the final decision to
approve each guest professor.
Other members of the board are
junior Bill Tyndall and senior Gordon
Wheat.
