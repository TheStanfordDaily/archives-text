Troops build in Ireland
LONDON — British leaders ordered 600 more
soldiers to Northern Ireland yesterday but re
jected Protestant calls to declare outright war
against the underground Irish Republican
Army, a mainly Roman Catholic movement.
An infantry battalion normally kept on
standby in England for use in emergencies was
dispatched to South Armagh where five Roman
Catholics and 10 Protestants have been slain in
two days by sectarian gunmen. The move dou
bles the number of troops in the South Armagh
area.
Announcement of the troop movement came
from No. 10 Downing Street after Prime Minister
Harold Wilson summoned key advisers for talks
on the worsening security situation in the pro
vince. The meeting resolved to go on searching
for a political solution based on power-sharing
between the 1,000,000 Protestants and 500,000
Catholics.
Demands for a British declaration of outright
war "militarily to defeat the IRA" came Monday
from the Rev. Lan Paisley, leader of the powerful
Ulster Unionists which wants the province to
remain part of Britain. Paisley warned a failure
by the Labor government to take the gloves off
could lead to a province-wide strike of Protes
tant workers.
Such a walkout in May 1974 brought Northern
Ireland to a standstill and doomed British efforts
at that time to introduce power-sharing between
Protestants and Catholics.
Ehrlichman charges mistrial
WASHINGTON — A lawyer for Watergate
cover-up defendant john D. Ehrlichman argued
yesterday that Ehrlichman was denied a fair trial
because the jury did not hear testimony from
former President Richard M. Nixon.
"He was producer, the director and the main
actor in what this trial was all about," said Atty.
William Frates as four men convicted in the
Watergate cover-up took their case to the U.S.
Court of Appeals.
Arguing for the special Watergate pro
secutor's office, Peter Kreindler said it was de
termined that Nixon was not healthy enough to
appear at the trial.
Besides, Kreindler said, "There is no basis in
this trial record that the result would have been
any different if Mr. Nixon had testified."
Six of the nine members of the appeals court
heard oral arguments slightly over a year after
four of the five cover-up defendants were con
victed of seeking to block the investigation into
the original Watergate break-in.
Besides Ehrlichman, a former White House
assistant, they are former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell, former White House Chief of Staff H. R.
Haldeman and former Nixon re-election com
mittee official Robert C. Mardian. Only Mardian
appeared in the courtroom, where jury selection
in their trial began Oct. 1,1974 and a verdict was
returned the next New Year's Day.

California fines AMC
LOS ANGELES — The vice chairman of
American Motors responded angrily yesterday
to the $4.2 million fine slapped on the company
by the state Air Resources Board for allegedly
filing "clean" test reports on smog-producing
cars.
"The idea that we're a bunch of gnomes sitting
back there in Detroit doctoring figures ... I just
think it's a cheap shot," said R.W. McNealy.
"I guess there were certain cars that according
to our tests in Kenosha, AMC's Wisconsin test
plant site met the California standards," he said.
"When they got out here they flunked the test.
We still haven't found out what caused this dis
crepancy."
In addition to the massive fine, the ARB also
banned the sale of all California AMC Matadors,
Hornets and Gremlins equipped with 304-
cubic-inch V-8 engines and announced an in
vestigation into AMC's six-cylinder cars to de
termine if the company had deliberately fal
sified their emission test reports.
"We have never seen so many dirty cars," ARB
chairman Tom Quinn said. "But even more seri
ous is the fact that American Motors submitted
false reports to the state which indicated that
their cars were actually very clean."
McNealy responded that AMC would have
been "absolutely stupid" to falsify the test re
ports.
Reagan leads in funds
WASHINGTON — Preliminary figures show
Ronald Reagan has raised more money than
President Ford in their campaigns for the Repub
lican presidential nomination.
Reagan also seems to be raising private dona
tions faster than Ford and qualifying for more
federal campaign subsidies than the President.
A spokesman for the Ford campaign said the
financial gap is probably temporary and of ques
tionable significance.
"If you're a moderate it's a little harder to raise
money," he said.
On the other hand, a Reagan campaigner said
the figures show broad-based support for the
former California governor.
Official finance reports aren't due for weeks.
But campaign spokesmen said in response to
questions Monday that Reagan raised about $2
million in public donations during 1975 and
Ford raised $1.7 million.
On that basis, it appeared that Reagan raised
money at the rate of more than $500,000 per
month during the last quarter of 1975, compared
with $327,000 per month for Ford. A Reagan
spokesman said the pace was continuing into
1976.
Reagan campaign lawyer Loren Smith said
more than 50,000 persons have given money to
the Reagan campaign.
"It isn't just the money that makes us happy. It
shows there is support out there," Smith said.
Reagan's financial edge is magnified by pub
lic financing. This year for the first time, the

government is giving qualified presidential
candidates dollar-for-dollar matching grants up
to $250 for each private donation they get.
M.D. slowdown continues
LOS ANGELES — A Southern California doc
tors' slowdown sharply reduced services at
many private hospitals yesterday and prepara
tions were made to release patients early and
transfer others out of bulging public facilities.
However, a spokesman for a publicly operated
emergency hotline said no patients in the na
tion's most populous county were being denied
emergency treatment even though elective
surgery ground to a virtual standstill at some
facilities.
Marion Diamond, chief of disaster services for
the county Department of Health Services, said
patients arriving at emergency rooms of many
private hospitals were being given necessary
first aid and then transferred to public facilities.
The Hospital Council of Southern California
says its latest count — taken Monday — indi
cated 71 of 234 member hospitals were ex
periencing difficulties of varying degrees. Yes
terday's figures were not immediately available
but a spokesman said the trend did not appear to
be improving.
Doctors are responding to an announced
quadrupling of malpractice insurance pre
miums by curtailing non-emergency services.
The county's eight hospitals and the state-run
UCLA Medical Center were expected to be filled
in about a week, spokesman said. Patients were
being diverted to these facilities where malprac
tice coverage is provided under a blanket policy
by taxpayers.
Caroline: 'worst dressed'
LOS ANGELES — Caroline Kennedy was
named worst dressed woman in the world yes
terday by fashion designer Mr. Blackvvell, who
cited the daughter of the late President John F.
Kennedy as a symbol of young America's "care
less" attire.
Blackwell described the 17-year-old Miss
Kennedy as resembling "a shaggy dog in pants."
It was the first time in 16 years that a teenager
had topped Blackwell's annual outrageous list
of worsts. But it was not the first time a Kennedy
drew his disdain.
Blackwell, expressing dismay at the fashion
attitude of American youngsters, said, "The
Levis and denim look has taken over any
semblance of sanity in the fashion industry. "I
think Caroline is a bright girl," he said. "But 1
think she so wanted to be part of young America
that she went along with it. By next year I predict
she'll be a super-looking young lady."
Blackwell's list, traditionally an acerbic put
down of movie stars, barely touched the film
industry this year. "We just don't have 10 movie
stars anymore." he said.
Instead, there were names from the worlds of
politics, royalty and music. Nancy Kissinger,
wife of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, was

called "a traveling fashion stew" and Princess
Anne of England was scolded for dressing like
"a royal auto mechanic."
Others on the list were: singers Helen Reddv
and Bette Midler, TV actress Sally Struthers,
country singers Tammy Wynette and Donna
Fargo, who received a dual citation, fashion de
signer Sonia Rvkiel, and actress Tatum O'Neal,
12-year-old daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, de
scribed as Blackwell as "12 going on 40."
The number 10 spot was a tongue-in-cheek
notation for rock star Elton John, the only man
on the list.
Garcia granted bail request
SAN FRANCISCO — The bail application of
Inez Garcia was granted yesterday by a state
appeals court which last month overturned her
conviction in the slaying of a man she says
helped rape her.
The brief ruling by the State Court of Appeals
ordered the trial court to set bail pending appeal
of her overturned second-degree murder convic
tion.
Hooker prosecution ends
SAN FRANCISCO — "In the past we'd always
have to run when we spotted the cops," said
Red, a Tenderloin hooker. "But now we ain't
gonna run no more."
Red and several other self-professed prosti
tutes gathered on a downtown streetcorner
Monday night to celebrate and spread the an
nouncement that the city's new district attorney
plans virtually to end prosecution of prostitu
tion cases.
"If it's a nonviolent, noncoercive activity bet
ween adults, and it doesn't involve any other
crime, my office will not bother with it," District
Attorney-elect Joseph Freitas Jr. said. He
specified that included minor cases of marijuana
possession and prostitution cases "where there
is no coercion or other crime involved."
"That man is right on — prostitution is a pro
fession that should be respected as much as any
other,' said a male hustler named Erron who
joined the exuberant hookers' group.
Freitas, a liberal labor lawyer who takes office
tomorrow, said he expected his policy would
not please supporters of the police department's
vice squad, which under the guidance of Capt.
Gerald Shaughnessy makes most prostitution
arrests.
"It's fair to say that our office will fail to prose
cute vice cases with the vigor that Captain
Shaughnessy might desire," Freitas said.
Today's weather
Fair but variable high clouds and patchy
morning fog through tonight. Increasing cloud
iness tomorrow with chance of rain by evening.
Slightly warmer days and not so cold tonight.
Lows in mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the 50s.

LONDON — British leaders ordered 600 more
soldiers to Northern Ireland yesterday but re
jected Protestant calls to declare outright war
against the underground Irish Republican
Army, a mainly Roman Catholic movement.
An infantry battalion normally kept on
standby in England for use in emergencies was
dispatched to South Armagh where five Roman
Catholics and 10 Protestants have been slain in
two days by sectarian gunmen. The move dou
bles the number of troops in the South Armagh
area.
Announcement of the troop movement came
from No. 10 Downing Street after Prime Minister
Harold Wilson summoned key advisers for talks
on the worsening security situation in the pro
vince. The meeting resolved to go on searching
for a political solution based on power-sharing
between the 1,000,000 Protestants and 500,000
Catholics.
Demands for a British declaration of outright
war "militarily to defeat the IRA" came Monday
from the Rev. Lan Paisley, leader of the powerful
Ulster Unionists which wants the province to
remain part of Britain. Paisley warned a failure
by the Labor government to take the gloves off
could lead to a province-wide strike of Protes
tant workers.
Such a walkout in May 1974 brought Northern
Ireland to a standstill and doomed British efforts
at that time to introduce power-sharing between
Protestants and Catholics.
Ehrlichman charges mistrial
WASHINGTON — A lawyer for Watergate
cover-up defendant john D. Ehrlichman argued
yesterday that Ehrlichman was denied a fair trial
because the jury did not hear testimony from
former President Richard M. Nixon.
"He was producer, the director and the main
actor in what this trial was all about," said Atty.
William Frates as four men convicted in the
Watergate cover-up took their case to the U.S.
Court of Appeals.
Arguing for the special Watergate pro
secutor's office, Peter Kreindler said it was de
termined that Nixon was not healthy enough to
appear at the trial.
Besides, Kreindler said, "There is no basis in
this trial record that the result would have been
any different if Mr. Nixon had testified."
Six of the nine members of the appeals court
heard oral arguments slightly over a year after
four of the five cover-up defendants were con
victed of seeking to block the investigation into
the original Watergate break-in.
Besides Ehrlichman, a former White House
assistant, they are former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell, former White House Chief of Staff H. R.
Haldeman and former Nixon re-election com
mittee official Robert C. Mardian. Only Mardian
appeared in the courtroom, where jury selection
in their trial began Oct. 1,1974 and a verdict was
returned the next New Year's Day.

California fines AMC
LOS ANGELES — The vice chairman of
American Motors responded angrily yesterday
to the $4.2 million fine slapped on the company
by the state Air Resources Board for allegedly
filing "clean" test reports on smog-producing
cars.
"The idea that we're a bunch of gnomes sitting
back there in Detroit doctoring figures ... I just
think it's a cheap shot," said R.W. McNealy.
"I guess there were certain cars that according
to our tests in Kenosha, AMC's Wisconsin test
plant site met the California standards," he said.
"When they got out here they flunked the test.
We still haven't found out what caused this dis
crepancy."
In addition to the massive fine, the ARB also
banned the sale of all California AMC Matadors,
Hornets and Gremlins equipped with 304-
cubic-inch V-8 engines and announced an in
vestigation into AMC's six-cylinder cars to de
termine if the company had deliberately fal
sified their emission test reports.
"We have never seen so many dirty cars," ARB
chairman Tom Quinn said. "But even more seri
ous is the fact that American Motors submitted
false reports to the state which indicated that
their cars were actually very clean."
McNealy responded that AMC would have
been "absolutely stupid" to falsify the test re
ports.
Reagan leads in funds
WASHINGTON — Preliminary figures show
Ronald Reagan has raised more money than
President Ford in their campaigns for the Repub
lican presidential nomination.
Reagan also seems to be raising private dona
tions faster than Ford and qualifying for more
federal campaign subsidies than the President.
A spokesman for the Ford campaign said the
financial gap is probably temporary and of ques
tionable significance.
"If you're a moderate it's a little harder to raise
money," he said.
On the other hand, a Reagan campaigner said
the figures show broad-based support for the
former California governor.
Official finance reports aren't due for weeks.
But campaign spokesmen said in response to
questions Monday that Reagan raised about $2
million in public donations during 1975 and
Ford raised $1.7 million.
On that basis, it appeared that Reagan raised
money at the rate of more than $500,000 per
month during the last quarter of 1975, compared
with $327,000 per month for Ford. A Reagan
spokesman said the pace was continuing into
1976.
Reagan campaign lawyer Loren Smith said
more than 50,000 persons have given money to
the Reagan campaign.
"It isn't just the money that makes us happy. It
shows there is support out there," Smith said.
Reagan's financial edge is magnified by pub
lic financing. This year for the first time, the

government is giving qualified presidential
candidates dollar-for-dollar matching grants up
to $250 for each private donation they get.
M.D. slowdown continues
LOS ANGELES — A Southern California doc
tors' slowdown sharply reduced services at
many private hospitals yesterday and prepara
tions were made to release patients early and
transfer others out of bulging public facilities.
However, a spokesman for a publicly operated
emergency hotline said no patients in the na
tion's most populous county were being denied
emergency treatment even though elective
surgery ground to a virtual standstill at some
facilities.
Marion Diamond, chief of disaster services for
the county Department of Health Services, said
patients arriving at emergency rooms of many
private hospitals were being given necessary
first aid and then transferred to public facilities.
The Hospital Council of Southern California
says its latest count — taken Monday — indi
cated 71 of 234 member hospitals were ex
periencing difficulties of varying degrees. Yes
terday's figures were not immediately available
but a spokesman said the trend did not appear to
be improving.
Doctors are responding to an announced
quadrupling of malpractice insurance pre
miums by curtailing non-emergency services.
The county's eight hospitals and the state-run
UCLA Medical Center were expected to be filled
in about a week, spokesman said. Patients were
being diverted to these facilities where malprac
tice coverage is provided under a blanket policy
by taxpayers.
Caroline: 'worst dressed'
LOS ANGELES — Caroline Kennedy was
named worst dressed woman in the world yes
terday by fashion designer Mr. Blackvvell, who
cited the daughter of the late President John F.
Kennedy as a symbol of young America's "care
less" attire.
Blackwell described the 17-year-old Miss
Kennedy as resembling "a shaggy dog in pants."
It was the first time in 16 years that a teenager
had topped Blackwell's annual outrageous list
of worsts. But it was not the first time a Kennedy
drew his disdain.
Blackwell, expressing dismay at the fashion
attitude of American youngsters, said, "The
Levis and denim look has taken over any
semblance of sanity in the fashion industry. "I
think Caroline is a bright girl," he said. "But 1
think she so wanted to be part of young America
that she went along with it. By next year I predict
she'll be a super-looking young lady."
Blackwell's list, traditionally an acerbic put
down of movie stars, barely touched the film
industry this year. "We just don't have 10 movie
stars anymore." he said.
Instead, there were names from the worlds of
politics, royalty and music. Nancy Kissinger,
wife of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, was

called "a traveling fashion stew" and Princess
Anne of England was scolded for dressing like
"a royal auto mechanic."
Others on the list were: singers Helen Reddv
and Bette Midler, TV actress Sally Struthers,
country singers Tammy Wynette and Donna
Fargo, who received a dual citation, fashion de
signer Sonia Rvkiel, and actress Tatum O'Neal,
12-year-old daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, de
scribed as Blackwell as "12 going on 40."
The number 10 spot was a tongue-in-cheek
notation for rock star Elton John, the only man
on the list.
Garcia granted bail request
SAN FRANCISCO — The bail application of
Inez Garcia was granted yesterday by a state
appeals court which last month overturned her
conviction in the slaying of a man she says
helped rape her.
The brief ruling by the State Court of Appeals
ordered the trial court to set bail pending appeal
of her overturned second-degree murder convic
tion.
Hooker prosecution ends
SAN FRANCISCO — "In the past we'd always
have to run when we spotted the cops," said
Red, a Tenderloin hooker. "But now we ain't
gonna run no more."
Red and several other self-professed prosti
tutes gathered on a downtown streetcorner
Monday night to celebrate and spread the an
nouncement that the city's new district attorney
plans virtually to end prosecution of prostitu
tion cases.
"If it's a nonviolent, noncoercive activity bet
ween adults, and it doesn't involve any other
crime, my office will not bother with it," District
Attorney-elect Joseph Freitas Jr. said. He
specified that included minor cases of marijuana
possession and prostitution cases "where there
is no coercion or other crime involved."
"That man is right on — prostitution is a pro
fession that should be respected as much as any
other,' said a male hustler named Erron who
joined the exuberant hookers' group.
Freitas, a liberal labor lawyer who takes office
tomorrow, said he expected his policy would
not please supporters of the police department's
vice squad, which under the guidance of Capt.
Gerald Shaughnessy makes most prostitution
arrests.
"It's fair to say that our office will fail to prose
cute vice cases with the vigor that Captain
Shaughnessy might desire," Freitas said.

Troops build in Ireland
LONDON — British leaders ordered 600 more
soldiers to Northern Ireland yesterday but re
jected Protestant calls to declare outright war
against the underground Irish Republican
Army, a mainly Roman Catholic movement.
An infantry battalion normally kept on
standby in England for use in emergencies was
dispatched to South Armagh where five Roman
Catholics and 10 Protestants have been slain in
two days by sectarian gunmen. The move dou
bles the number of troops in the South Armagh
area.
Announcement of the troop movement came
from No. 10 Downing Street after Prime Minister
Harold Wilson summoned key advisers for talks
on the worsening security situation in the pro
vince. The meeting resolved to go on searching
for a political solution based on power-sharing
between the 1,000,000 Protestants and 500,000
Catholics.
Demands for a British declaration of outright
war "militarily to defeat the IRA" came Monday
from the Rev. Lan Paisley, leader of the powerful
Ulster Unionists which wants the province to
remain part of Britain. Paisley warned a failure
by the Labor government to take the gloves off
could lead to a province-wide strike of Protes
tant workers.
Such a walkout in May 1974 brought Northern
Ireland to a standstill and doomed British efforts
at that time to introduce power-sharing between
Protestants and Catholics.
Ehrlichman charges mistrial
WASHINGTON — A lawyer for Watergate
cover-up defendant john D. Ehrlichman argued
yesterday that Ehrlichman was denied a fair trial
because the jury did not hear testimony from
former President Richard M. Nixon.
"He was producer, the director and the main
actor in what this trial was all about," said Atty.
William Frates as four men convicted in the
Watergate cover-up took their case to the U.S.
Court of Appeals.
Arguing for the special Watergate pro
secutor's office, Peter Kreindler said it was de
termined that Nixon was not healthy enough to
appear at the trial.
Besides, Kreindler said, "There is no basis in
this trial record that the result would have been
any different if Mr. Nixon had testified."
Six of the nine members of the appeals court
heard oral arguments slightly over a year after
four of the five cover-up defendants were con
victed of seeking to block the investigation into
the original Watergate break-in.
Besides Ehrlichman, a former White House
assistant, they are former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell, former White House Chief of Staff H. R.
Haldeman and former Nixon re-election com
mittee official Robert C. Mardian. Only Mardian
appeared in the courtroom, where jury selection
in their trial began Oct. 1,1974 and a verdict was
returned the next New Year's Day.

California fines AMC
LOS ANGELES — The vice chairman of
American Motors responded angrily yesterday
to the $4.2 million fine slapped on the company
by the state Air Resources Board for allegedly
filing "clean" test reports on smog-producing
cars.
"The idea that we're a bunch of gnomes sitting
back there in Detroit doctoring figures ... I just
think it's a cheap shot," said R.W. McNealy.
"I guess there were certain cars that according
to our tests in Kenosha, AMC's Wisconsin test
plant site met the California standards," he said.
"When they got out here they flunked the test.
We still haven't found out what caused this dis
crepancy."
In addition to the massive fine, the ARB also
banned the sale of all California AMC Matadors,
Hornets and Gremlins equipped with 304-
cubic-inch V-8 engines and announced an in
vestigation into AMC's six-cylinder cars to de
termine if the company had deliberately fal
sified their emission test reports.
"We have never seen so many dirty cars," ARB
chairman Tom Quinn said. "But even more seri
ous is the fact that American Motors submitted
false reports to the state which indicated that
their cars were actually very clean."
McNealy responded that AMC would have
been "absolutely stupid" to falsify the test re
ports.
Reagan leads in funds
WASHINGTON — Preliminary figures show
Ronald Reagan has raised more money than
President Ford in their campaigns for the Repub
lican presidential nomination.
Reagan also seems to be raising private dona
tions faster than Ford and qualifying for more
federal campaign subsidies than the President.
A spokesman for the Ford campaign said the
financial gap is probably temporary and of ques
tionable significance.
"If you're a moderate it's a little harder to raise
money," he said.
On the other hand, a Reagan campaigner said
the figures show broad-based support for the
former California governor.
Official finance reports aren't due for weeks.
But campaign spokesmen said in response to
questions Monday that Reagan raised about $2
million in public donations during 1975 and
Ford raised $1.7 million.
On that basis, it appeared that Reagan raised
money at the rate of more than $500,000 per
month during the last quarter of 1975, compared
with $327,000 per month for Ford. A Reagan
spokesman said the pace was continuing into
1976.
Reagan campaign lawyer Loren Smith said
more than 50,000 persons have given money to
the Reagan campaign.
"It isn't just the money that makes us happy. It
shows there is support out there," Smith said.
Reagan's financial edge is magnified by pub
lic financing. This year for the first time, the

government is giving qualified presidential
candidates dollar-for-dollar matching grants up
to $250 for each private donation they get.
M.D. slowdown continues
LOS ANGELES — A Southern California doc
tors' slowdown sharply reduced services at
many private hospitals yesterday and prepara
tions were made to release patients early and
transfer others out of bulging public facilities.
However, a spokesman for a publicly operated
emergency hotline said no patients in the na
tion's most populous county were being denied
emergency treatment even though elective
surgery ground to a virtual standstill at some
facilities.
Marion Diamond, chief of disaster services for
the county Department of Health Services, said
patients arriving at emergency rooms of many
private hospitals were being given necessary
first aid and then transferred to public facilities.
The Hospital Council of Southern California
says its latest count — taken Monday — indi
cated 71 of 234 member hospitals were ex
periencing difficulties of varying degrees. Yes
terday's figures were not immediately available
but a spokesman said the trend did not appear to
be improving.
Doctors are responding to an announced
quadrupling of malpractice insurance pre
miums by curtailing non-emergency services.
The county's eight hospitals and the state-run
UCLA Medical Center were expected to be filled
in about a week, spokesman said. Patients were
being diverted to these facilities where malprac
tice coverage is provided under a blanket policy
by taxpayers.
Caroline: 'worst dressed'
LOS ANGELES — Caroline Kennedy was
named worst dressed woman in the world yes
terday by fashion designer Mr. Blackvvell, who
cited the daughter of the late President John F.
Kennedy as a symbol of young America's "care
less" attire.
Blackwell described the 17-year-old Miss
Kennedy as resembling "a shaggy dog in pants."
It was the first time in 16 years that a teenager
had topped Blackwell's annual outrageous list
of worsts. But it was not the first time a Kennedy
drew his disdain.
Blackwell, expressing dismay at the fashion
attitude of American youngsters, said, "The
Levis and denim look has taken over any
semblance of sanity in the fashion industry. "I
think Caroline is a bright girl," he said. "But 1
think she so wanted to be part of young America
that she went along with it. By next year I predict
she'll be a super-looking young lady."
Blackwell's list, traditionally an acerbic put
down of movie stars, barely touched the film
industry this year. "We just don't have 10 movie
stars anymore." he said.
Instead, there were names from the worlds of
politics, royalty and music. Nancy Kissinger,
wife of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, was

called "a traveling fashion stew" and Princess
Anne of England was scolded for dressing like
"a royal auto mechanic."
Others on the list were: singers Helen Reddv
and Bette Midler, TV actress Sally Struthers,
country singers Tammy Wynette and Donna
Fargo, who received a dual citation, fashion de
signer Sonia Rvkiel, and actress Tatum O'Neal,
12-year-old daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, de
scribed as Blackwell as "12 going on 40."
The number 10 spot was a tongue-in-cheek
notation for rock star Elton John, the only man
on the list.
Garcia granted bail request
SAN FRANCISCO — The bail application of
Inez Garcia was granted yesterday by a state
appeals court which last month overturned her
conviction in the slaying of a man she says
helped rape her.
The brief ruling by the State Court of Appeals
ordered the trial court to set bail pending appeal
of her overturned second-degree murder convic
tion.
Hooker prosecution ends
SAN FRANCISCO — "In the past we'd always
have to run when we spotted the cops," said
Red, a Tenderloin hooker. "But now we ain't
gonna run no more."
Red and several other self-professed prosti
tutes gathered on a downtown streetcorner
Monday night to celebrate and spread the an
nouncement that the city's new district attorney
plans virtually to end prosecution of prostitu
tion cases.
"If it's a nonviolent, noncoercive activity bet
ween adults, and it doesn't involve any other
crime, my office will not bother with it," District
Attorney-elect Joseph Freitas Jr. said. He
specified that included minor cases of marijuana
possession and prostitution cases "where there
is no coercion or other crime involved."
"That man is right on — prostitution is a pro
fession that should be respected as much as any
other,' said a male hustler named Erron who
joined the exuberant hookers' group.
Freitas, a liberal labor lawyer who takes office
tomorrow, said he expected his policy would
not please supporters of the police department's
vice squad, which under the guidance of Capt.
Gerald Shaughnessy makes most prostitution
arrests.
"It's fair to say that our office will fail to prose
cute vice cases with the vigor that Captain
Shaughnessy might desire," Freitas said.

Troops build in Ireland
LONDON — British leaders ordered 600 more
soldiers to Northern Ireland yesterday but re
jected Protestant calls to declare outright war
against the underground Irish Republican
Army, a mainly Roman Catholic movement.
An infantry battalion normally kept on
standby in England for use in emergencies was
dispatched to South Armagh where five Roman
Catholics and 10 Protestants have been slain in
two days by sectarian gunmen. The move dou
bles the number of troops in the South Armagh
area.
Announcement of the troop movement came
from No. 10 Downing Street after Prime Minister
Harold Wilson summoned key advisers for talks
on the worsening security situation in the pro
vince. The meeting resolved to go on searching
for a political solution based on power-sharing
between the 1,000,000 Protestants and 500,000
Catholics.
Demands for a British declaration of outright
war "militarily to defeat the IRA" came Monday
from the Rev. Lan Paisley, leader of the powerful
Ulster Unionists which wants the province to
remain part of Britain. Paisley warned a failure
by the Labor government to take the gloves off
could lead to a province-wide strike of Protes
tant workers.
Such a walkout in May 1974 brought Northern
Ireland to a standstill and doomed British efforts
at that time to introduce power-sharing between
Protestants and Catholics.
Ehrlichman charges mistrial
WASHINGTON — A lawyer for Watergate
cover-up defendant john D. Ehrlichman argued
yesterday that Ehrlichman was denied a fair trial
because the jury did not hear testimony from
former President Richard M. Nixon.
"He was producer, the director and the main
actor in what this trial was all about," said Atty.
William Frates as four men convicted in the
Watergate cover-up took their case to the U.S.
Court of Appeals.
Arguing for the special Watergate pro
secutor's office, Peter Kreindler said it was de
termined that Nixon was not healthy enough to
appear at the trial.
Besides, Kreindler said, "There is no basis in
this trial record that the result would have been
any different if Mr. Nixon had testified."
Six of the nine members of the appeals court
heard oral arguments slightly over a year after
four of the five cover-up defendants were con
victed of seeking to block the investigation into
the original Watergate break-in.
Besides Ehrlichman, a former White House
assistant, they are former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell, former White House Chief of Staff H. R.
Haldeman and former Nixon re-election com
mittee official Robert C. Mardian. Only Mardian
appeared in the courtroom, where jury selection
in their trial began Oct. 1,1974 and a verdict was
returned the next New Year's Day.

California fines AMC
LOS ANGELES — The vice chairman of
American Motors responded angrily yesterday
to the $4.2 million fine slapped on the company
by the state Air Resources Board for allegedly
filing "clean" test reports on smog-producing
cars.
"The idea that we're a bunch of gnomes sitting
back there in Detroit doctoring figures ... I just
think it's a cheap shot," said R.W. McNealy.
"I guess there were certain cars that according
to our tests in Kenosha, AMC's Wisconsin test
plant site met the California standards," he said.
"When they got out here they flunked the test.
We still haven't found out what caused this dis
crepancy."
In addition to the massive fine, the ARB also
banned the sale of all California AMC Matadors,
Hornets and Gremlins equipped with 304-
cubic-inch V-8 engines and announced an in
vestigation into AMC's six-cylinder cars to de
termine if the company had deliberately fal
sified their emission test reports.
"We have never seen so many dirty cars," ARB
chairman Tom Quinn said. "But even more seri
ous is the fact that American Motors submitted
false reports to the state which indicated that
their cars were actually very clean."
McNealy responded that AMC would have
been "absolutely stupid" to falsify the test re
ports.
Reagan leads in funds
WASHINGTON — Preliminary figures show
Ronald Reagan has raised more money than
President Ford in their campaigns for the Repub
lican presidential nomination.
Reagan also seems to be raising private dona
tions faster than Ford and qualifying for more
federal campaign subsidies than the President.
A spokesman for the Ford campaign said the
financial gap is probably temporary and of ques
tionable significance.
"If you're a moderate it's a little harder to raise
money," he said.
On the other hand, a Reagan campaigner said
the figures show broad-based support for the
former California governor.
Official finance reports aren't due for weeks.
But campaign spokesmen said in response to
questions Monday that Reagan raised about $2
million in public donations during 1975 and
Ford raised $1.7 million.
On that basis, it appeared that Reagan raised
money at the rate of more than $500,000 per
month during the last quarter of 1975, compared
with $327,000 per month for Ford. A Reagan
spokesman said the pace was continuing into
1976.
Reagan campaign lawyer Loren Smith said
more than 50,000 persons have given money to
the Reagan campaign.
"It isn't just the money that makes us happy. It
shows there is support out there," Smith said.
Reagan's financial edge is magnified by pub
lic financing. This year for the first time, the

government is giving qualified presidential
candidates dollar-for-dollar matching grants up
to $250 for each private donation they get.
M.D. slowdown continues
LOS ANGELES — A Southern California doc
tors' slowdown sharply reduced services at
many private hospitals yesterday and prepara
tions were made to release patients early and
transfer others out of bulging public facilities.
However, a spokesman for a publicly operated
emergency hotline said no patients in the na
tion's most populous county were being denied
emergency treatment even though elective
surgery ground to a virtual standstill at some
facilities.
Marion Diamond, chief of disaster services for
the county Department of Health Services, said
patients arriving at emergency rooms of many
private hospitals were being given necessary
first aid and then transferred to public facilities.
The Hospital Council of Southern California
says its latest count — taken Monday — indi
cated 71 of 234 member hospitals were ex
periencing difficulties of varying degrees. Yes
terday's figures were not immediately available
but a spokesman said the trend did not appear to
be improving.
Doctors are responding to an announced
quadrupling of malpractice insurance pre
miums by curtailing non-emergency services.
The county's eight hospitals and the state-run
UCLA Medical Center were expected to be filled
in about a week, spokesman said. Patients were
being diverted to these facilities where malprac
tice coverage is provided under a blanket policy
by taxpayers.
Caroline: 'worst dressed'
LOS ANGELES — Caroline Kennedy was
named worst dressed woman in the world yes
terday by fashion designer Mr. Blackvvell, who
cited the daughter of the late President John F.
Kennedy as a symbol of young America's "care
less" attire.
Blackwell described the 17-year-old Miss
Kennedy as resembling "a shaggy dog in pants."
It was the first time in 16 years that a teenager
had topped Blackwell's annual outrageous list
of worsts. But it was not the first time a Kennedy
drew his disdain.
Blackwell, expressing dismay at the fashion
attitude of American youngsters, said, "The
Levis and denim look has taken over any
semblance of sanity in the fashion industry. "I
think Caroline is a bright girl," he said. "But 1
think she so wanted to be part of young America
that she went along with it. By next year I predict
she'll be a super-looking young lady."
Blackwell's list, traditionally an acerbic put
down of movie stars, barely touched the film
industry this year. "We just don't have 10 movie
stars anymore." he said.
Instead, there were names from the worlds of
politics, royalty and music. Nancy Kissinger,
wife of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, was

called "a traveling fashion stew" and Princess
Anne of England was scolded for dressing like
"a royal auto mechanic."
Others on the list were: singers Helen Reddv
and Bette Midler, TV actress Sally Struthers,
country singers Tammy Wynette and Donna
Fargo, who received a dual citation, fashion de
signer Sonia Rvkiel, and actress Tatum O'Neal,
12-year-old daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, de
scribed as Blackwell as "12 going on 40."
The number 10 spot was a tongue-in-cheek
notation for rock star Elton John, the only man
on the list.
Garcia granted bail request
SAN FRANCISCO — The bail application of
Inez Garcia was granted yesterday by a state
appeals court which last month overturned her
conviction in the slaying of a man she says
helped rape her.
The brief ruling by the State Court of Appeals
ordered the trial court to set bail pending appeal
of her overturned second-degree murder convic
tion.
Hooker prosecution ends
SAN FRANCISCO — "In the past we'd always
have to run when we spotted the cops," said
Red, a Tenderloin hooker. "But now we ain't
gonna run no more."
Red and several other self-professed prosti
tutes gathered on a downtown streetcorner
Monday night to celebrate and spread the an
nouncement that the city's new district attorney
plans virtually to end prosecution of prostitu
tion cases.
"If it's a nonviolent, noncoercive activity bet
ween adults, and it doesn't involve any other
crime, my office will not bother with it," District
Attorney-elect Joseph Freitas Jr. said. He
specified that included minor cases of marijuana
possession and prostitution cases "where there
is no coercion or other crime involved."
"That man is right on — prostitution is a pro
fession that should be respected as much as any
other,' said a male hustler named Erron who
joined the exuberant hookers' group.
Freitas, a liberal labor lawyer who takes office
tomorrow, said he expected his policy would
not please supporters of the police department's
vice squad, which under the guidance of Capt.
Gerald Shaughnessy makes most prostitution
arrests.
"It's fair to say that our office will fail to prose
cute vice cases with the vigor that Captain
Shaughnessy might desire," Freitas said.

Troops build in Ireland
LONDON — British leaders ordered 600 more
soldiers to Northern Ireland yesterday but re
jected Protestant calls to declare outright war
against the underground Irish Republican
Army, a mainly Roman Catholic movement.
An infantry battalion normally kept on
standby in England for use in emergencies was
dispatched to South Armagh where five Roman
Catholics and 10 Protestants have been slain in
two days by sectarian gunmen. The move dou
bles the number of troops in the South Armagh
area.
Announcement of the troop movement came
from No. 10 Downing Street after Prime Minister
Harold Wilson summoned key advisers for talks
on the worsening security situation in the pro
vince. The meeting resolved to go on searching
for a political solution based on power-sharing
between the 1,000,000 Protestants and 500,000
Catholics.
Demands for a British declaration of outright
war "militarily to defeat the IRA" came Monday
from the Rev. Lan Paisley, leader of the powerful
Ulster Unionists which wants the province to
remain part of Britain. Paisley warned a failure
by the Labor government to take the gloves off
could lead to a province-wide strike of Protes
tant workers.
Such a walkout in May 1974 brought Northern
Ireland to a standstill and doomed British efforts
at that time to introduce power-sharing between
Protestants and Catholics.
Ehrlichman charges mistrial
WASHINGTON — A lawyer for Watergate
cover-up defendant john D. Ehrlichman argued
yesterday that Ehrlichman was denied a fair trial
because the jury did not hear testimony from
former President Richard M. Nixon.
"He was producer, the director and the main
actor in what this trial was all about," said Atty.
William Frates as four men convicted in the
Watergate cover-up took their case to the U.S.
Court of Appeals.
Arguing for the special Watergate pro
secutor's office, Peter Kreindler said it was de
termined that Nixon was not healthy enough to
appear at the trial.
Besides, Kreindler said, "There is no basis in
this trial record that the result would have been
any different if Mr. Nixon had testified."
Six of the nine members of the appeals court
heard oral arguments slightly over a year after
four of the five cover-up defendants were con
victed of seeking to block the investigation into
the original Watergate break-in.
Besides Ehrlichman, a former White House
assistant, they are former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell, former White House Chief of Staff H. R.
Haldeman and former Nixon re-election com
mittee official Robert C. Mardian. Only Mardian
appeared in the courtroom, where jury selection
in their trial began Oct. 1,1974 and a verdict was
returned the next New Year's Day.

California fines AMC
LOS ANGELES — The vice chairman of
American Motors responded angrily yesterday
to the $4.2 million fine slapped on the company
by the state Air Resources Board for allegedly
filing "clean" test reports on smog-producing
cars.
"The idea that we're a bunch of gnomes sitting
back there in Detroit doctoring figures ... I just
think it's a cheap shot," said R.W. McNealy.
"I guess there were certain cars that according
to our tests in Kenosha, AMC's Wisconsin test
plant site met the California standards," he said.
"When they got out here they flunked the test.
We still haven't found out what caused this dis
crepancy."
In addition to the massive fine, the ARB also
banned the sale of all California AMC Matadors,
Hornets and Gremlins equipped with 304-
cubic-inch V-8 engines and announced an in
vestigation into AMC's six-cylinder cars to de
termine if the company had deliberately fal
sified their emission test reports.
"We have never seen so many dirty cars," ARB
chairman Tom Quinn said. "But even more seri
ous is the fact that American Motors submitted
false reports to the state which indicated that
their cars were actually very clean."
McNealy responded that AMC would have
been "absolutely stupid" to falsify the test re
ports.
Reagan leads in funds
WASHINGTON — Preliminary figures show
Ronald Reagan has raised more money than
President Ford in their campaigns for the Repub
lican presidential nomination.
Reagan also seems to be raising private dona
tions faster than Ford and qualifying for more
federal campaign subsidies than the President.
A spokesman for the Ford campaign said the
financial gap is probably temporary and of ques
tionable significance.
"If you're a moderate it's a little harder to raise
money," he said.
On the other hand, a Reagan campaigner said
the figures show broad-based support for the
former California governor.
Official finance reports aren't due for weeks.
But campaign spokesmen said in response to
questions Monday that Reagan raised about $2
million in public donations during 1975 and
Ford raised $1.7 million.
On that basis, it appeared that Reagan raised
money at the rate of more than $500,000 per
month during the last quarter of 1975, compared
with $327,000 per month for Ford. A Reagan
spokesman said the pace was continuing into
1976.
Reagan campaign lawyer Loren Smith said
more than 50,000 persons have given money to
the Reagan campaign.
"It isn't just the money that makes us happy. It
shows there is support out there," Smith said.
Reagan's financial edge is magnified by pub
lic financing. This year for the first time, the

government is giving qualified presidential
candidates dollar-for-dollar matching grants up
to $250 for each private donation they get.
M.D. slowdown continues
LOS ANGELES — A Southern California doc
tors' slowdown sharply reduced services at
many private hospitals yesterday and prepara
tions were made to release patients early and
transfer others out of bulging public facilities.
However, a spokesman for a publicly operated
emergency hotline said no patients in the na
tion's most populous county were being denied
emergency treatment even though elective
surgery ground to a virtual standstill at some
facilities.
Marion Diamond, chief of disaster services for
the county Department of Health Services, said
patients arriving at emergency rooms of many
private hospitals were being given necessary
first aid and then transferred to public facilities.
The Hospital Council of Southern California
says its latest count — taken Monday — indi
cated 71 of 234 member hospitals were ex
periencing difficulties of varying degrees. Yes
terday's figures were not immediately available
but a spokesman said the trend did not appear to
be improving.
Doctors are responding to an announced
quadrupling of malpractice insurance pre
miums by curtailing non-emergency services.
The county's eight hospitals and the state-run
UCLA Medical Center were expected to be filled
in about a week, spokesman said. Patients were
being diverted to these facilities where malprac
tice coverage is provided under a blanket policy
by taxpayers.
Caroline: 'worst dressed'
LOS ANGELES — Caroline Kennedy was
named worst dressed woman in the world yes
terday by fashion designer Mr. Blackvvell, who
cited the daughter of the late President John F.
Kennedy as a symbol of young America's "care
less" attire.
Blackwell described the 17-year-old Miss
Kennedy as resembling "a shaggy dog in pants."
It was the first time in 16 years that a teenager
had topped Blackwell's annual outrageous list
of worsts. But it was not the first time a Kennedy
drew his disdain.
Blackwell, expressing dismay at the fashion
attitude of American youngsters, said, "The
Levis and denim look has taken over any
semblance of sanity in the fashion industry. "I
think Caroline is a bright girl," he said. "But 1
think she so wanted to be part of young America
that she went along with it. By next year I predict
she'll be a super-looking young lady."
Blackwell's list, traditionally an acerbic put
down of movie stars, barely touched the film
industry this year. "We just don't have 10 movie
stars anymore." he said.
Instead, there were names from the worlds of
politics, royalty and music. Nancy Kissinger,
wife of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, was

called "a traveling fashion stew" and Princess
Anne of England was scolded for dressing like
"a royal auto mechanic."
Others on the list were: singers Helen Reddv
and Bette Midler, TV actress Sally Struthers,
country singers Tammy Wynette and Donna
Fargo, who received a dual citation, fashion de
signer Sonia Rvkiel, and actress Tatum O'Neal,
12-year-old daughter of actor Ryan O'Neal, de
scribed as Blackwell as "12 going on 40."
The number 10 spot was a tongue-in-cheek
notation for rock star Elton John, the only man
on the list.
Garcia granted bail request
SAN FRANCISCO — The bail application of
Inez Garcia was granted yesterday by a state
appeals court which last month overturned her
conviction in the slaying of a man she says
helped rape her.
The brief ruling by the State Court of Appeals
ordered the trial court to set bail pending appeal
of her overturned second-degree murder convic
tion.
Hooker prosecution ends
SAN FRANCISCO — "In the past we'd always
have to run when we spotted the cops," said
Red, a Tenderloin hooker. "But now we ain't
gonna run no more."
Red and several other self-professed prosti
tutes gathered on a downtown streetcorner
Monday night to celebrate and spread the an
nouncement that the city's new district attorney
plans virtually to end prosecution of prostitu
tion cases.
"If it's a nonviolent, noncoercive activity bet
ween adults, and it doesn't involve any other
crime, my office will not bother with it," District
Attorney-elect Joseph Freitas Jr. said. He
specified that included minor cases of marijuana
possession and prostitution cases "where there
is no coercion or other crime involved."
"That man is right on — prostitution is a pro
fession that should be respected as much as any
other,' said a male hustler named Erron who
joined the exuberant hookers' group.
Freitas, a liberal labor lawyer who takes office
tomorrow, said he expected his policy would
not please supporters of the police department's
vice squad, which under the guidance of Capt.
Gerald Shaughnessy makes most prostitution
arrests.
"It's fair to say that our office will fail to prose
cute vice cases with the vigor that Captain
Shaughnessy might desire," Freitas said.
Today's weather
Fair but variable high clouds and patchy
morning fog through tonight. Increasing cloud
iness tomorrow with chance of rain by evening.
Slightly warmer days and not so cold tonight.
Lows in mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the 50s.
