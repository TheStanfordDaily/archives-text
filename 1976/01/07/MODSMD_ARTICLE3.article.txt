# Last year's grading stiffer, says registrar
## 
### CHRIS THURSTON 
A report released by the Registrar's
Office indicates that grading standards
stiffened last year, before the rein
troduction of the "D" grade this year.
The proportion of "As" received last
year dropped four percent from the
1973-74 figure in the humanities and
sciences, two percent in engineering
and three percent in the earth sciences.
The proportion of "Bs" dropped one or
two percent, while proportions of
"Cs," "passes" or "pluses," and "no
credits" rose slightly.
In engineering, the report found the
proportion of "As" and "Bs" falling
below the 196H-69 level.
The Faculty Senate voted last year to
restore "D" grades as a means of coin
bating grade inflation and making the
"C" more respectable. Since 1970,
Stanford has used an "A-B-C-pass"
system of grading, with loss of-credit
as the only penalty for unsatisfactory
performance.
Data soon
The Faculty Senate vote made the
reinstitution of the "D" effective this
autumn. Data are expected Thursday
from the Registrar's Office regarding
the impact of this change during au

tumn quarter. The change also rede
fines the "pass" grade as equivalent to
a grade of " 'D' or better."
Anecdotal reports have suggested
that some students now prefer to drop
courses or receive no credit rather than
have "Ds" on their records. In addi
tion, elected "pass" grades may have
become more attractive as a means of
escaping the "D."
Registrar Sally Mahoney said she
expects the number of "Ds" to com
prise one to two percent of autumn
quarter grades.
Incompletes
The grade computation, which is
being conducted through the Regis
trar's Office, may be slowed by a rela
tively high proportion of incompletes
stemming from the last-minute effects
of the United Airline strike. The strike
prompted many students to leave
campus early.
Students in Political Science I.
among other courses, were given the
option of taking incompletes and
finishing the course early this quarter.
Once the data on autumn quarter
grades are accumulated and analyzed,
they are expected to show the nature of
the impact of the reinstitution of the
"D."
