# Tunney claims increased involvement
## U.S. pilots flying in Angola? 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) —American
pilots have been flying arms to Angola
in Cl3O Hercules cargo planes, U.S.
Sen. John Tunney said yesterday.
Tunney (D-Calif.) said his source is
an American eyewitness who was in
Africa in recent weeks. Tunney said
the source, who requested anonym
ity, also was eyewitness to an incident
in which a helicopter carrying execu
tives of an American aerospace com
pany came under fire.
"I consider my source extremely re
liable. He was an eyewitness. Ameri
can pilots are flying them," Tunney
told a news conference.
Questioned later, the senator said he
did not know whether the pilots were
civilian or military.
Tunney said the Cl3os were making
four or five flights daily from Zaire to
Angola carrying arms at the time his
source was in Africa several weeks

ago. He said he didn't know if the
planes are still flying.
Who is paying?
"I don't know who owns the Cl3os.
We don't know the number of Ameri
can aircrtift. One might ask who is pay
ing for those aircraft. Is it a CIA opera
tion?
"Those are facts we don't have. We
would like to have them. The only
people who can answer these ques
tions are the President and secretary of
state," said Tunney, a candidate for
re-election this year.
He said the source is not a govern
ment employe but "a person of sub
stance, a person who is a credible wit
ness" who was in both Zaire and An
gola recently.
Urgent letter
Tunney. who has led the congres
sional battle to cut off U.S. aid to An

gola, said he was sending an urgent
letter to every member of the House of
Representatives to confirm Senate ac
tion in cutting such aid.
U.S. Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) in
a separate appearance in Sacramento,
confirmed Tunney's account in gen
eral terms.
"There was a movement of weapons
in there. Whatever Tunney says is ac
curate," Church said.
Meanwhile, South Africa an
nounced yesterday that a brigadier and
five other military men had been killed
in the fighting area along the Angolan
border — four in a plane crash and two
from wounds suffered in "action."
Defense headquarters in Pretoria did
not say whether the light plane crash
was an accident or the result of milit
ary action.
