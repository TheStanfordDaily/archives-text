# Cold snap dries area

### 

As a result of an unusually cold
winter season causing low
humidity and lack of rain, the
hay area has suffered from a dry
spell. Foothill streams like
Tunitas Creek, pictured here,
normally the scene of gushing
water, have been reduced this
year to a trickle. Relief is soon to
come, however, as local weath
ermen predict rain by late
Thursday.
