About 15 students are continuing a

At Chico State, the students are now
occupying an entrance way between
7:30 a.m. and 0:00 p.m., according to
Vivian George, university spokeswo

"The students moved from the hall
way .they were in because that part of
the building is being made
earthquake-proof. Their 24-hour ac
cess to the building has been ended
also because of the construction," said
George.
Mostly quiet
Students at Chico State are on vaca
tion until the spring term begins on
Jan. 26. Besides the sit-in, no other pro

George did not know if students
would be allowed to remain in the en

The sit-in at Sonoma State was

Campbell said, "There might possi
bly be a survey of student opinion at
