Somewhere between Scylla
and Charybdis (that is, east of
Lasuen and west of deCuerre)
are the books I need for a paper.
Probably. Yet even those brave
and sympathetic spirits called
librarians, who would have wil
lingly guided mortals through
most odysseys and labyrinths,
cannot find the materials. The
famous Labyrinth, you see, at
least started in one place; Stan
ford libraries do not.
Learn what I have learned
about our libraries, and never
again will you scoff at the Olym
pian disorder of the City of New
York.
1) Psychology books are lo
cated in Main, Meyer, Cubber
ley and Jordan Psychology Lib
raries. Their precise location is
determined by the Furies.
2) Serial Records is kept up to
date — every three years.
3) The Main Library card
catalog listseverything available
— almost.
4) What Main lists, it catalogs
by Dewey Decimal (DD) system,
by Library of Congress (LC) sys
tem or by both systems.
Accident
5) A book is actually in Main if
its catalog card is stamped with
the word "stack." Some cards
that should be so stamped are
not. This is to be ponsidered an
accident, not a fatal flaw.
6) Some of the catalog cards
stamped "stack" refer to books
which are not in the Main Lib
rary at all. They are in Meyer
basement.
7) On' the walls of Main is a
Magical Mystery Chart by which
one locates levels for books. The
(hart lists HG thru HJ (re
member, that's an LC classifica
tion) as located in Meyer base
ment. What you thought was
"III" on your card turns out to be
"Hone," because there IS no HI
in the LC system. H-one isn't IN
Meyer basement. It's back in
Main. Only it's out.
Temptresses
8) Have you encountered the
Temptresses? These belong to
Main, but seem to sleep around a
lot.-The Magical Mystery Chart
tells you to ask for these books at
the d&sk. The mortified librarian
whispers, "Well, yes, yes. But
come back in an hour an a half."
Why? Because, it seems, some
chilled Charon must ferry these
tj) you from her shamefaced
storage in Styx. They can't be
kept at Main, you see.
9) Actually, Main doesn't
catalog all the books. Meyer's
collection hasa book catalog, not
a card catalog, and the book
oatalog contents do not appear in
plain's cards. So after you don't
find your books at Main, you can
go and not find them at Meyer.

10) Cubberley Library (no, I'm
not finished yet) was organized
by one Mr. Cubberley (of blessed
memory) on his own, modified
Dewey Decimal system. How
ever, all new books in Stanford
libraries are now catalogued by
the LC system only. Cubberley
actually has some of those new
books. Here is how you can tell:
Right to left
If you stand inside the main
room at Cubberley and face the
main doors, the 370-370.4 sec
tion is on your far left, running
from right to left.
On your near left are the "L"
books which, since they are
newer, have been classified only
by LC system, even though their
subject matter is contained in the
3705. On your right, you find
370.5 and up. These run left to
right towards the far wall. The
best run, however, is yours —
straight past the pained and pa
tient librarian and immediately
out the double doors.
While labyrinths of location
and coding abound, these alone
do not explain the Stanford Lib
rary system. There are also phys
ical labyrinths to master. Let the
Craces lead you thither:
To get to the basement stacks
in Main (two levels below
ground), float into the library, fly
up two levels, show your card
and just zip down four levels to
your target.
To get from Main microfilm
room in the basement to the
stacks in the basement, float up
four levels, change stairways,
and just scurry down those same
four levels to your target.
Start outside
To get to Meyer Basement, you
have to begin outdoors, and not
in Meyer Library — I think. Walk
down two levels of outside
stairs, show your card on enter
ing, and you are sanctified to
walk across the entire basement
A level, up an "Emergency
Only" stairway, into the tin tem
ple of B level, where reside your
needed periodicals, Promethian
and bound.
Even when you remove from
consideration the many pages
and volumes stolen (and there
fore not cluttering the stacks of
our libraries), the system and
many of the building seem more
appropriate to Pandora than to
an institution which prides itself
on academic excellence.
At the least, there should be a
rational reallocation of existing
facilities: there should probably
be plans for a new or enlarged
Main facility. Then, perhaps, we
would have a distant shore in
sight and, with it, an end to a
pointless odyssey.
