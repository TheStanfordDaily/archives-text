# What ails the humanities?
## Robert Cohn 
### 
As Stanford enters the new year and era,
impressive buildings are going up, the sci
ences and professional schools are more
than holding their own, but the humanities,
which began to rise promisingly under
President Wallace Sterling, are now in
alarming decline. One may well predict that
Stanford will receive lower national ratings
in many humanistic fields and, regardless
of the hundreds of millions being raised,
will sink in terms of overall prestige to the
status of a second-class institution.
This is only very partially because of the
nation-wide mood of disinterest in
humanistic studies: a great, or would-be
great, university must largely ignore these
faddish waves and/or the marketplace and
stick by the enduring values. The real cause
is a lack of tradition and of faith in these
central realms at Stanford.
Attract scholars
If we had the proper stuff, we would long
ago have done what was needed to raise our
standards: attract the leading scholars. Re
cently, we have notably been unable to do
so, or even to keep the scholars we had. For
this — especially since we lack the sheer
glamor of a Harvard or Yale or Princeton —
one must offer to men and women who have
unquestionably earned it, a special status in

regard to course load and other privileges.
It is in this way, for example, that Prince
ton is currently running away from us and
that even a relatively obscure institution
such as the University of Virginia has
(through its Commonwealth Fund) built up
English, French and German departments
far outclassing ours.
That's how they lured several of our out
standing humanist scholars, including the
man who is sometimes called the best Ger
manist in America and who had an unsur
passed reputation as a teacher here. Others
went to Yale, Harvard, etc.
Now that the prestigious French scholar
we almost got has finally backed off, a great
Dante scholar has wiggled away at the last
moment and our very best humanist scholar
is leaving us for Berkeley, the least we can
do is honestly face the fact of our failure and
examine some of the causes.
Special honor
It is not enough to offer a high salary,
which other institutions can generally
match or top in any event. Many great scho
lars, like the above-mentioned Germanist,
need more time in which to write important
books in their later career; their energy
tends to decline though their mastery rises.
Besides, they want and deserve some spe
cial honor, such as a "University Professor-

ship," which has the additional advantage
of freeing them from the petty pressures of a
department.
The rank of "Full Professor" is no longer
very distiguished in this country. A person
who has achieved it long ago and sees many
of his peers falling asleep in it. may wel
come the further challenge and inducement
of the elite rank and be rejuvenated for new
achievement.
A friend of mine who rates with the finest
in our field has been named "University
Professor" at Princeton, and I could tell
from the lift in his voice announcing this
appointment why Princeton got him away
from Yale, raising Princeton's stock apprec
iably, along with my friend's spirits. In any
event, whether we like the idea of a "five
star" rank or not. it exists elsewhere and
bids fair to drain us of luminaries in time.
It would take a minimum of six of those
top-flight appointments to begin to put
Stanford in the running again as a serious
university. That would require an endow
ment of four to five million dollars —
"peanuts" compared to the cost of even a
small building, the absence of which would
make hardly a dent in our true worth or
reputation.
