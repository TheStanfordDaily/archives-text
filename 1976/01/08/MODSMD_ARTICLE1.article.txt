# 'Syria threatens to annex Lebanon'

BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Syria may
annex Lebanon if Lebanon splits into
Moslem and Christian states, Kuwaiti
newspapers yesterday quoted Syrian
Foreign Minister Abdul Khaddam
as saying.
Khaddam's reported threats, to
gether with the heightened Palestinian
participation in the civil war, in
creased the danger that the Lebanese
war could spread into an international
conflict.
Pierre Gemayal, leader of the right
wing Christian Phalange party, said in
a telephone interview that "the prob
lem concerns the Arab world, and I
might even say the whole world, be
cause this could lead to a third world
war."
But Gemayal said that Khaddam's
alleged threat probably "was just a fi
gure of speech."
Israeli leaders have hinted at possi
ble intervention if Syrian forces take
part in the Lebanese fighting. Syria has
not entered the conflict militarily, but
Khaddam has arranged temporary
cease-fires twice.
The official Syrian radio announced
that President Hafez Assad's Damas
cus regime was beginning yet another
mediation effort. It made no mention
of Khaddam's reported annexation
threat.
Premier Rashid Karami's six-man
cabinet called off a cabinet meeting
because of the deteriorating situation.
His special cease-fire committee broke
up in disagreement Tuesday night.
Meanwhile, Palestinian guerrillas
overran a Christian enclave yesterday
in an attempt to lift a blockade of two
refugee camps.
The guerrilla drive through the
Christian enclave came after gunmen
from private Moslem and Christian
armies had put up barricades in most
of Beirut, shattering atwo-week lull in
the nine-month-old civil war. The
state radio said all streets were unsafe.
Meanwhile, police reported fierce
rocket and mortar duels between

Christian and Moslem neighborhoods
in the eastern Beirut suburbs and an
outbreak of fighting in the northern
city of Tripoli.
Preliminary counts showed 23 per
sons killed and 50 injured.
Palestinian guerrilla splkesmen said
the guerrillas, in their largest, most or
ganized effort in the conflict so far,
took over the hillside Christian
neighborhood of Horsh Thabet.
This gave them vantage points from
which to shoot down on Phalangist
militiamen and their Christian allies
from Interior Minister Camille Cha
moun's National Liberal party and the
extremist Cedar Guards.
Christian gunmen have blocked
passage of food convoys for three days
into Tel Zaatar and Jisr el-Basha, re
fugee camps with a total population of
27,000 including, nearby neighbor
hoods.

COMMENCEMENT CONTROVERSY —Daniel Patrick Moynihan was selected
last year by the administration to speak at commencemet. The administra
tion's choice angered many seniors, who expressed opposition to Movnihan's
political views. This year's selection promises to be a calmer affair since
seniors themselves will have had more of a voice in the speaker's selection.
