## Low pressure math class solves post-high school frustrations 
### MIKI YOSHIMURA 
Some people swear that after high school they will
never take another math course as long as they live.
Math 2 is a pre-calculus class which reviews all the
basics of math including algehra and trigonometry with
an emphasis on understanding. Because most of the
students who take the class have had bad experiences
with math in a normal classroom situation, Math 2 of
fers an alternative learning atmosphere.
According to Mathematics Lecturer Phil Faillace,
the class is designed to be as anxiety free as possible.
Tests do not determine grades and there are no quotas
for the numbers of grades given. Instead students re
ceive grades for doing set amounts of work.
Consultants, who are students currently enrolled in
Math 195, play an integral role in the class. Each consul
tant aids two or three students or two consultants will
team up and help four students. Students meet with
their consultants at least two hours a week and discuss
the teacher's lecture, ask questions and receive indi
vidual aid.
Tie up ends
"Consultants are not teachers," explains former con
sultant Dennis Bruno. "They are hot there to lecture but
to tie up any loose ends from the teacher's lecture."
Students are required to attend Faillace's lectures but
consultation meeting places and times are left up to the
consultants and their students. Faillace says the class is
as unstructured as possible so as to put little pressure on

the student. Therefore there are no set schedules of what
has to be done by when. The consulting groups move
according to the students' rates of progress.
Faillace admits that the system does put a burden on
the students because they have to take the initiative to
do the work.
However, as one student commented, "You can do
the work bit by bit, but if you wait till the last week, it's
your own fault."
Leisurely pace
Students have found the format of the class very en
joyable. Comparing it to high school, one student said,
"The class thoroughly reviews math. It is more enjoy
able because you handle the material at a more leisurely
pace."
Another student notes that the class is not as struc
tured as other math courses and students are given a
chance to ask a lot of questions and receive individual
attention.
Bruno says he considers the course format to be the
reason why Math 2 has been so successful. He says he
feels it is one of the most ideal learning situations for the
student.
"Understanding what you're doing is the main em
phasis of the class," Faillace says. "In high school many
students blindly applied formulas, doing just enough to
get by while not really understanding what they were
doing.

"While most of the students are verbally bright they
just have not learned to think in the non-verbal terms
needed for math."
Tests are only given as guidelines to show progress.
Students must show they have mastered a skill by
achieving a 90 to 100 percent on a test which can be
taken as often as necessary.
Having student consultants creates less pressure,
Faillace claims. Because they are in the same peer
group, students are more willing to ask question and
receive help from the consultants, he says.
"One of the most rewarding things about teaching
this class is when you see a student make a big change in
their attitude towards math. When they find they can'do
it successfully, it is very thrilling," comments Faillace.
A student describing the class said, "I've had math
before and didn't always enjoy it but now, this class has
really changed my outlook on math. 1 think 1 am getting
a lot out of it."
Consultants also praised the class. Bruno, a math
major, explained, "In math you're always learning
theory and there is very little that makes you stay in
contact with the world. In humanities you stay in touch
with people: even in chemistry you have labs with other
people but in math you can become totally engrossed
and can easily forget reality. Math 2 lets you work with
people and lets you see it from a different point of
view."
