A fter finishing the midterm barrage, my roommate had black cir
cles under his eyes. I realize these come from a lack of sleep, but
what is the physiological reason? Could it be internal bruising from
too many pages? Or is it late nights all alone with a test tube?-W.S.
No one knows for sure what causes the circles, but Dr. Steven
Tomson, a dermatology fellow at Stanford Hospital, unearthed one
theory for you:
Lower lid darkening begins with "venus congestion" in this
area. Venus congestion means that circulation from the veins is cut
off, causing the blood to back up into the capillary vessels. This
backed-up blood leaks through the walls of the capillaries and
escapes into the surrounding tissue.
Because the skin in the lower eyelid area is loose and elastic, it
stretches and swells from the increased fluid. This in turn leads to
accentuation of the natural grooves in the tissue through shadows
— and consequently apparent darkening under the eyes.
1 lowever, there's one problem with this theory. No one knows yet
why tiredness leads to venus congestion. Tomson doesn't and eye
don't either.

Why is there no poor box in Memorial Church?—A .C.L.
It's a Stanford tradition. According to the terms of Jane Stan
ford's will, no money can ever be collected within the sanctuary.
Occasional money for charitable causes held in Mem Chu must be
collected outside.

Is it legal to ride your bike at night without lights if you're on a bike
path?—D.F.
Yes it is, according to Captain Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford
Police Department. However, if you cross any roadways during
your ride you are once again illegal.
