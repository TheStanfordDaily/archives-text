## Hustle' = hulk + whore Humble Howard 
### 
Films more often reflect the work of their direc
tor. Hustle is the first film in a long time that is
suffused with the personality of its screenwriter,
Steve Shagan.
Shagan is the man who created the anachronis
tic Harry Stoner of Save The Tiger. Stoner re
treated into the past to escape the present.
In Hustle Lt. Phil Gaines (Burt Reynolds) also
has an obsession with the past and its conflicting
innocence and corruption.
FA corruption
Hustle is a vision of I.os Angeles corruption,
demonstrating that there are two levels of law
enforcement—one for the "somebodies" and one
for the "nobodies."
All the characters are obsessed with social
status. At the climax, when Gaines, fed up with
the system, takes the law into his own hands, his
partner Belgrave (Paul VVinfield) says,"I wouldn't
do this for anybody."
Gaines replies, "You're not doing it lor any
body. You're doing it for a nobody."
All Hustle's characters labor under some sort of
torment for past and present sins. They live in an
oppressive world of excessive violence with kil
lers scot-free and pornography for the asking.
Fiction it ain't
It is far from fiction, though From Shagan's
own novel City of Angels (an ironic title if there
ever was one), it is as realistic as they come, a sad
indictment of the times we live in.

Gaines is a Los Angeles cop living with a high
priced French prostitute (Catherine Deneuve).
She loves him, but he can't marry her due to his
rotten first marriage and her profession.
A murdered girl's father (Ben Johnson) pres
sures him to further investigate his daughter's
involvement with a big-shot lawyer (Eddie Al
bert). Haines' superior (Ernest Borgnine) wants to
sweep it away because the father is a nobody and
the lawyer is a somebody. It takes Gaines the bet
ter part of two hours to come to grips with his
distaste for the system, finally taking positive ac
tion.
Cynical and ironic
The film's ending makes Hustle as cynical and
ironic as they come, much in the vein of
Chinatown (which it is billed with, not coinciden
tally). The forces of corruption are ont;e again on
top and what mere mortal human beings can do to
turn the tide is negligible.
Phil Gaines is the best acting job Burt Reynolds
hasever done. It isan original blend of wry humor
and worried sadness. It is a far cry from the
devil-may-care frivolity Reynolds has specialized
in recently.
With time, provided he is willing to take a few
chances, he could become a fine dramatic actor.
Gaines is so surprisingly serious and concerned
that one can hardly believe it's Burt Reynolds.

do this for anybody."
Gaines replies, "You're not doing it lor any
body. You're doing it for a nobody."
All Hustle's characters labor under some sort of
torment for past and present sins. They live in an
oppressive world of excessive violence with kil
lers scot-free and pornography for the asking.
Fiction it ain't
It is far from fiction, though From Shagan's
own novel City of Angels (an ironic title if there
ever was one), it is as realistic as they come, a sad
indictment of the times we live in.

Gaines is a Los Angeles cop living with a high
priced French prostitute (Catherine Deneuve).
She loves him, but he can't marry her due to his
rotten first marriage and her profession.
A murdered girl's father (Ben Johnson) pres
sures him to further investigate his daughter's
involvement with a big-shot lawyer (Eddie Al
bert). Haines' superior (Ernest Borgnine) wants to
sweep it away because the father is a nobody and
the lawyer is a somebody. It takes Gaines the bet
ter part of two hours to come to grips with his
distaste for the system, finally taking positive ac
tion.
Cynical and ironic
The film's ending makes Hustle as cynical and
ironic as they come, much in the vein of
Chinatown (which it is billed with, not coinciden
tally). The forces of corruption are ont;e again on
top and what mere mortal human beings can do to
turn the tide is negligible.
Phil Gaines is the best acting job Burt Reynolds
hasever done. It isan original blend of wry humor
and worried sadness. It is a far cry from the
devil-may-care frivolity Reynolds has specialized
in recently.
With time, provided he is willing to take a few
chances, he could become a fine dramatic actor.
Gaines is so surprisingly serious and concerned
that one can hardly believe it's Burt Reynolds.

Films more often reflect the work of their direc
tor. Hustle is the first film in a long time that is
suffused with the personality of its screenwriter,
Steve Shagan.
Shagan is the man who created the anachronis
tic Harry Stoner of Save The Tiger. Stoner re
treated into the past to escape the present.
In Hustle Lt. Phil Gaines (Burt Reynolds) also
has an obsession with the past and its conflicting
innocence and corruption.
FA corruption
Hustle is a vision of I.os Angeles corruption,
demonstrating that there are two levels of law
enforcement—one for the "somebodies" and one
for the "nobodies."
All the characters are obsessed with social
status. At the climax, when Gaines, fed up with
the system, takes the law into his own hands, his
partner Belgrave (Paul VVinfield) says,"I wouldn't
do this for anybody."
Gaines replies, "You're not doing it lor any
body. You're doing it for a nobody."
