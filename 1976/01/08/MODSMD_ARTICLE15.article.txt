## 'Lucky Lady:' a remake of 'The Sting' 
### 
It you gut the feeling during Lucky Ludy
that you've seen it before, don't be sur
prised — you have. It's a grander, more
exotic, more violent remake of The Sting.
It is the same movie right down to the
plot's direction and the colorful '30s ex
pressions the characters use ("Every
thing's jake," say both Robert Redford
and Burt Reynolds).
Gene Hackman (who replaced a booz
ing George Segal), Liza Minelli and Burt
Reynolds play rum-runners who trans
port illegal booze on the high seas during
Prohibition from Mexico and San Diego.
They are plagued all the way by two ex
cellent character actors — John Hillerman
as the competing ganster and Geoffrey
Lewis as a clumsy Coast Guard officer.
Once vou catch on to where you've seen

all this action before, it's easy to predict
what's going to happen. With startling
repetition from The Sting, the criminals
hit it rich by accidentally double-crossing
the evil gangster, who then returns for
revenge, shooting a boy on their crew
(Robby Benson). The trio returns with a
large group of friends to destroy the
gangster.
The Sting, even though less visual and
majestic, had a lot more class. Filming on
the open sea isn't necessarily an im
provement over the sets at Universal.
Economics played a part too. Redford
and Newman were much poorer than
Robert Shaw, while Hackman-Minelli/
Reynolds are in practically the same
economic bracket as Hillerman. The
Sting's criminals only ripped off money,

while I.uckv Lady's crew mercilessly and
explicitly drowned, exploded and shot its
nemeses (much to the audience's de
light).
Is this bad? 1 don't know. Lucky Lady is
still an enjoyable movie, but don't go ex
pected anything wildly original. Perhaps
if it had been made first, it would have
been great. However — The Sting was
first ... it was a great movie . . . and
Lucky Lady pales by comparison.
It does have some bright moments,
most of them belonging to Reynolds and
Lewis. Hackman is present and pleasant,
but the film far from demands all that he is
capable of. Minelli shifts between having
a 'New Yahk' accent and talking nor
mally, but she's still the same old bright
and bouncy star (not actress — star).

Stanley Donen, the director, had prob
lems with the end of the film.
Donen had the t:hoice of having
Reynolds and Hackman killed (the stars'
choice); or having them together years
later (a scene filmed at great expense in
Rome, where Minelli's new film is being
made); or having them sail off into more
escapades in the sunset (and thus leave it
open for a sequal). Wisely, the last was
chosen. Funny Lady, among others,
showed how ridiculous future epilogues
are, and having the leads shot after a com
edy would be a lot like having Warren
Heatty turn homosexual when Julie Chris
tie leaves him in Shampoo.
