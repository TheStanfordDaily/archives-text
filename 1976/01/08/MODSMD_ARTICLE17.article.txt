# Lotteries experience troubles nationwide
## 
### The Associated Press 
Legal hassles, duplicate
ticket problems and rising
costs have hurt some of the
nation's lotteries and sent of
ficials searching for ways to
build interest and straighten
out operations.
Most are doing well, with
some areas, including New
Jersey and Ohio, linking
programs to the Bicentennial
in an attempt to increase
sales. Trouble remains, how
ever. in a few key spots.
The Omaha, Neb., lottery is
in the midst of a court battle
over the interpretation of the
law authorizing the program.
At issue is what the law
means when it requires that
proceeds must go to civic bet
terment or charitable causes.
The New York state lottery
was suspended last October
because of organizational
problems that led to the is
suance of tickets with dupli
cate numbers. Gov. Hugh
Carey has proposed a reor
ganization plan, but the legis
lation is still pending and of
ficials in neighboring Ver
mont said New York's prob
lems might hurt their own
chances of establishing a lot

tery.
"I thought we had an excel
lent chance of passage last
winter," said Vermont Kep.
Norman Keed, who intro
duced a bill establishing a lot
tery. "But 1 see some things
on the horizon that 1 don't like
— like the New York State
controversy."
Pennsylvania facesa poten
tial problem because of the
cost of funding the growing
number of senior citizens'
programs financed by lottery
revenues. Officials say the
cost of the programs may ex
ceed revenues by $13 million
next year.
On the brighter side, the
Delaware lottery recently got
under way again after a
four-month suspension. The
structure was revamped to
eliminate a no-winner prob
lem that developed during
the initial five weeks.
Officials in the other 10
states with lotteries — Con
necticut, Illinois. Michigan,
New Jersey, New Hampshire,
Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio,
Rhode Island and Maryland
reported no problems and
most said revenues had ex
ceeded expectations.
