# NBC 'N' contested

NEW YORk (AP) — A major
qustion (hat affects all mankind
is being asked today: Who has
custody of the letter "N," the
mighty National Broadcasting
Co. or the tiny Nebraska Educa
tional Television Network?
Don't laugh. This is serious.
NBC spent 14 months pondering
and planning a new corporate
identification symbol to replace
one in u£e since lan. 14. 1959. a
serpentine version of the letters
NBC.
It was no small matter, since
the changeover of a broadcast
firm's corporate symbol can cost
hundreds of thousands of dol
lars, since everything from sta
tion breaks to sationery must
bear the new sign.
In April, when NBC's mulling
still was going on, Ron Hull,
program manager of Nebraska's

nine-station public TV system,
decided his network also needed
a new symbol. He didn't know
NBC had planned one.
On New Year's Day. Hull was
watching NBC's preview of the
Tournament of Roses parade,
saw the new NBC symbol and
was flat startled.
He said it was identical to the
futuristic "N" NBTV has used in
its newspaper ads since June and
in its broadcasts since fall. The
only difference is that his "N" is
red on a gray, not blue,
backgrou nd.
NBC, understandably jittery
about tin* whole thing, says. "We
don't believe there will be any
confusion between the new NBC
symbol" and that of NBTV. But it
refuses to answer any questions
about it.
