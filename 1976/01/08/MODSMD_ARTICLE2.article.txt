# Cowell prescribes suspect contraceptive
## 
### KAREN CAESAR 
Even though the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has made pre
liminary moves to remove the sequen
tial birth control pill from the market
because of suspected cancer links,
Cowell Student Health Center will
continue to "occasionally" prescribe
that type of pill, Cowell staff physician
John Dorman said yesterday.
"Until there's a larger number of
people studies, my temptation is to say
that if there is a significant danger of
cancer, it would have been discovered
earlier," said Dorman.
According to Time magazine, the
concern regarding the sequential arose
out of a recent study at the University
of Colorado School of Medicine where
two doctors analyzed 21 cases of
women under 40 with cancer of the
lining of the uterus.
Eleven of these women were taking
the "sequential" form of oral con
traceptive, and because this is more
than half the number of women
studied, the doctors termed the study
"highly significant."
Different combinations
Most standard birth control pills
contain a combination of estrogen and
progesterone in each pill, and one pill
is taken every day for three weeks. For
those women using sequentials, the
formula is different. For the first two
weeks of the menstral cycle, the user
takes an estrogen-only tablet; for the
next five or six days, she takes combi
nation estrogen-progesterone pills.
Sequentials are prescribed usually
for younger women who experience
unpleasant side-effects, such as acne
or an upset stomach, when taking the
standard Pill.
Sequentials are also "more
physiologic" according to Dorman.
For those women who have infrequent
or irregular periods, they "make your
hormones more closely approximate

the hormone levels in the normal
menstral cycle," he said.
Also, with the standard Pill, there is
the tendency for women who stop tak
ing it after long-term use to cease
menstruating, said Dorman. Thus, an
advantage of sequentials is that they
"lessen the chances of post-pill inhibi
tion of ovulation," he said.
Although 10 percent of the esti
mated 10 million American women on
the Pill take sequentials, "certainly
less than five percent and perhaps less
than one percent" of Stanford women
using oral contraceptives take them,
said Dorman. "I can't remember the
last time I started someone on them,"
he added.
Less effective
"They're not as effective (as the
standard Pill). If you miss taking one,
your chances of getting pregnant are
increased dramatically," he con
cluded.
According to the FDA, many women
on the Pill literally don't know what
they're getting, and a recent survey has
indicated that many of them would
like more information on exactly what
is in the Pill, what it does to their sys
tems, and particularly what the possi
ble side-effects are. More information
was especially requested concerning
simultaneous use of the Pill with other
drugs,
