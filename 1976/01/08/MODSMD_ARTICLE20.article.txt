CIA funding in Italy
WASHINGTON — The CIA is funneling $6 mill
ion to anti-Communist political leaders in Italy to
head off what Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
considers alarming advances by the Communist
Party in Europe, an authoritative source said yes
terday.
The money is going directly to members of the
Christian Democratic and Democratic Socialist par
ties, the source said.
President Ford is described as angered by public
reports disclosing the CIA funding. White House
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford believes the
reports, whether true or false, "truly damage our
own national interests."
Nessen, who declined to confirm or deny the
reports, said there was "a strong suspicion in the
White House that these allegations originated in
Congress ... It raises some questions about how to
responsibly deal with Congress' interest in playing
an increased role in foreign policy and intelligence
policy."
Italian Premier resigns
ROME — Premier Aldo Moro and his minority
coalition government resigned last night after the
Socialist party withdrew key parliamentary sup
port, setting off a new political crisis in the midst of
a determined Communist drive for a share in ruling
the nation.
The 13-month-old cabinet of Moro's Christian
Democrats and the small Republican party was the
32nd Italian government to collapse since the end
of World War 11.
In withdrawing their backing in parliamentary
voting, the Socialists — a Marxist group that is
Italy's third largest party — complained that the
Moro government had ignored their ideas for solv
ing the country's economic ills. They also charged
non-Communist prejudice against the Communist
party.
The government's end came as an authoritative
Washington source claimed that the CIA is funnel
ing $6 million directly to members of the Christian
Democratic party and the Democratic Socialists, a

party distinct from the Socialists. There was no
known link between the funds report and the gov
ernment collapse.
Brown proposes tax break
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
proposed a $50 million personal income tax break
yesterday for low-income Californians.
The Democratic governor also promised in his
second annual address to the California Legislature
that he would balance the state budget and provide
a "prudent surplus" without imposing new taxes.
But, Brown said, the era of unlimited growth and
ever-increasing state revenues for new services is
over in California. There will be little money for
new programs.
"We are entering an era of limits. In place of a
manifest economic destiny, we face a sober reas
sessment of the new economic realities," Brown
said.
"Response from both Republicans and Democrats
was generally favorable, but not enthusiastic. Most
criticism focused on what Brown failed to say in the
brief, 11-minute speech.
Domestic car sales climb
DETROIT — Domestic car sales in mid-December
climbed 30 percent above bleak year-earlier levels
to help the nation's auto makers close out 1975 on a
continued upswing and launch 1976 on an en
couraging note.
The four major car producers, which reopened
Monday after a 10-day holiday shutdown, said they
sold 189,826 cars in the Dec. 11-20 period, up from
ananemic 146,195 inthe same 1974 span, whenthe
economic recession severely dampened the market.
American Motors Corp. led the increases, with
sales up 43 percent. Ford Motor Co. deliveries were
up 42 percent and Chrysler Corp. sales rose 41
percent, while General Motors, the biggest firm,
reported a 21 percent gain.
Despite the sharp industry-wide gain over mid-
December 1974, the selling pace still was six per

cent behind the tempo of mid-December 1973,
when fuel shortages had just begun to plunge the
companies into their worst slump since the Great
Depression. The tempo also was off 26 percent from
the period record set in 1972.
India to curb birth rate
NEW DELHI, India — The Indian government, up
to now a failure at population control, indicated
yesterday it is giving increased consideration to
compulsory sterilization to curb the birth rate.
Karen Singh, minister of health and family plan
ning, told parliament that if a new government plan
of "incentives and disincentives" fails to encour
age families to limit their size "we might have to
resort to making a law and it would be applicable to
all."
Indian authorities are seeking the best way to
prevent India's population, estimated at 600 mill
ion now, from reaching one billion.
At least four of India's 22 states, which adminis
ter the family planning program paid for by the
central government, are considering compulsory
sterilization measures.
Singh did not spell out what the new government
plan of incentives would be but suggested that
economic incentives and tax relief might be two
areas used to convince parents to limit their
families to two or three children.
The state of Haryana, which is considering com
pulsory sterilization along with Punjab, Himachal
Pradesh and Maharashtra, has in effect now a plan
which deprives government workers of housing
and other privileges if they have more than two
children.
Another aspect of the controversy raised in parli
ament was the old charge that the family planning
program was curbing the Hindu population growth
while the Christian and Moslem populations were
continuing to increase.

CIA funding in Italy
WASHINGTON — The CIA is funneling $6 mill
ion to anti-Communist political leaders in Italy to
head off what Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
considers alarming advances by the Communist
Party in Europe, an authoritative source said yes
terday.
The money is going directly to members of the
Christian Democratic and Democratic Socialist par
ties, the source said.
President Ford is described as angered by public
reports disclosing the CIA funding. White House
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford believes the
reports, whether true or false, "truly damage our
own national interests."
Nessen, who declined to confirm or deny the
reports, said there was "a strong suspicion in the
White House that these allegations originated in
Congress ... It raises some questions about how to
responsibly deal with Congress' interest in playing
an increased role in foreign policy and intelligence
policy."
Italian Premier resigns
ROME — Premier Aldo Moro and his minority
coalition government resigned last night after the
Socialist party withdrew key parliamentary sup
port, setting off a new political crisis in the midst of
a determined Communist drive for a share in ruling
the nation.
The 13-month-old cabinet of Moro's Christian
Democrats and the small Republican party was the
32nd Italian government to collapse since the end
of World War 11.
In withdrawing their backing in parliamentary
voting, the Socialists — a Marxist group that is
Italy's third largest party — complained that the
Moro government had ignored their ideas for solv
ing the country's economic ills. They also charged
non-Communist prejudice against the Communist
party.
The government's end came as an authoritative
Washington source claimed that the CIA is funnel
ing $6 million directly to members of the Christian
Democratic party and the Democratic Socialists, a

party distinct from the Socialists. There was no
known link between the funds report and the gov
ernment collapse.
Brown proposes tax break
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
proposed a $50 million personal income tax break
yesterday for low-income Californians.
The Democratic governor also promised in his
second annual address to the California Legislature
that he would balance the state budget and provide
a "prudent surplus" without imposing new taxes.
But, Brown said, the era of unlimited growth and
ever-increasing state revenues for new services is
over in California. There will be little money for
new programs.
"We are entering an era of limits. In place of a
manifest economic destiny, we face a sober reas
sessment of the new economic realities," Brown
said.
"Response from both Republicans and Democrats
was generally favorable, but not enthusiastic. Most
criticism focused on what Brown failed to say in the
brief, 11-minute speech.
Domestic car sales climb
DETROIT — Domestic car sales in mid-December
climbed 30 percent above bleak year-earlier levels
to help the nation's auto makers close out 1975 on a
continued upswing and launch 1976 on an en
couraging note.
The four major car producers, which reopened
Monday after a 10-day holiday shutdown, said they
sold 189,826 cars in the Dec. 11-20 period, up from
ananemic 146,195 inthe same 1974 span, whenthe
economic recession severely dampened the market.
American Motors Corp. led the increases, with
sales up 43 percent. Ford Motor Co. deliveries were
up 42 percent and Chrysler Corp. sales rose 41
percent, while General Motors, the biggest firm,
reported a 21 percent gain.
Despite the sharp industry-wide gain over mid-
December 1974, the selling pace still was six per

cent behind the tempo of mid-December 1973,
when fuel shortages had just begun to plunge the
companies into their worst slump since the Great
Depression. The tempo also was off 26 percent from
the period record set in 1972.
India to curb birth rate
NEW DELHI, India — The Indian government, up
to now a failure at population control, indicated
yesterday it is giving increased consideration to
compulsory sterilization to curb the birth rate.
Karen Singh, minister of health and family plan
ning, told parliament that if a new government plan
of "incentives and disincentives" fails to encour
age families to limit their size "we might have to
resort to making a law and it would be applicable to
all."
Indian authorities are seeking the best way to
prevent India's population, estimated at 600 mill
ion now, from reaching one billion.
At least four of India's 22 states, which adminis

central government, are considering compulsory
sterilization measures.

when fuel shortages had just begun to plunge the
companies into their worst slump since the Great
Depression. The tempo also was off 26 percent from
the period record set in 1972.
India to curb birth rate
NEW DELHI, India — The Indian government, up
to now a failure at population control, indicated
yesterday it is giving increased consideration to
compulsory sterilization to curb the birth rate.
Karen Singh, minister of health and family plan
ning, told parliament that if a new government plan
of "incentives and disincentives" fails to encour
age families to limit their size "we might have to
resort to making a law and it would be applicable to
all."
Indian authorities are seeking the best way to
prevent India's population, estimated at 600 mill
ion now, from reaching one billion.
At least four of India's 22 states, which adminis
ter the family planning program paid for by the
central government, are considering compulsory
sterilization measures.
Singh did not spell out what the new government
plan of incentives would be but suggested that
economic incentives and tax relief might be two
areas used to convince parents to limit their
families to two or three children.
The state of Haryana, which is considering com
pulsory sterilization along with Punjab, Himachal
Pradesh and Maharashtra, has in effect now a plan
which deprives government workers of housing
and other privileges if they have more than two
children.
Another aspect of the controversy raised in parli
ament was the old charge that the family planning
program was curbing the Hindu population growth
while the Christian and Moslem populations were
continuing to increase.
Today's weather

CIA funding in Italy
WASHINGTON — The CIA is funneling $6 mill
ion to anti-Communist political leaders in Italy to
head off what Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
considers alarming advances by the Communist
Party in Europe, an authoritative source said yes
terday.
The money is going directly to members of the
Christian Democratic and Democratic Socialist par
ties, the source said.
President Ford is described as angered by public
reports disclosing the CIA funding. White House
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford believes the
reports, whether true or false, "truly damage our
own national interests."
Nessen, who declined to confirm or deny the
reports, said there was "a strong suspicion in the
White House that these allegations originated in
Congress ... It raises some questions about how to
responsibly deal with Congress' interest in playing
an increased role in foreign policy and intelligence
policy."
Italian Premier resigns
ROME — Premier Aldo Moro and his minority
coalition government resigned last night after the
Socialist party withdrew key parliamentary sup
port, setting off a new political crisis in the midst of
a determined Communist drive for a share in ruling
the nation.
The 13-month-old cabinet of Moro's Christian
Democrats and the small Republican party was the
32nd Italian government to collapse since the end
of World War 11.
In withdrawing their backing in parliamentary
voting, the Socialists — a Marxist group that is
Italy's third largest party — complained that the
Moro government had ignored their ideas for solv
ing the country's economic ills. They also charged
non-Communist prejudice against the Communist
party.
The government's end came as an authoritative
Washington source claimed that the CIA is funnel
ing $6 million directly to members of the Christian
Democratic party and the Democratic Socialists, a

party distinct from the Socialists. There was no
known link between the funds report and the gov
ernment collapse.
Brown proposes tax break
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
proposed a $50 million personal income tax break
yesterday for low-income Californians.
The Democratic governor also promised in his
second annual address to the California Legislature
that he would balance the state budget and provide
a "prudent surplus" without imposing new taxes.
But, Brown said, the era of unlimited growth and
ever-increasing state revenues for new services is
over in California. There will be little money for
new programs.
"We are entering an era of limits. In place of a
manifest economic destiny, we face a sober reas
sessment of the new economic realities," Brown
said.
"Response from both Republicans and Democrats
was generally favorable, but not enthusiastic. Most
criticism focused on what Brown failed to say in the
brief, 11-minute speech.
Domestic car sales climb
DETROIT — Domestic car sales in mid-December
climbed 30 percent above bleak year-earlier levels
to help the nation's auto makers close out 1975 on a
continued upswing and launch 1976 on an en
couraging note.
The four major car producers, which reopened
Monday after a 10-day holiday shutdown, said they
sold 189,826 cars in the Dec. 11-20 period, up from
ananemic 146,195 inthe same 1974 span, whenthe
economic recession severely dampened the market.
American Motors Corp. led the increases, with
sales up 43 percent. Ford Motor Co. deliveries were
up 42 percent and Chrysler Corp. sales rose 41
percent, while General Motors, the biggest firm,
reported a 21 percent gain.
Despite the sharp industry-wide gain over mid-
December 1974, the selling pace still was six per

cent behind the tempo of mid-December 1973,
when fuel shortages had just begun to plunge the
companies into their worst slump since the Great
Depression. The tempo also was off 26 percent from
