# USE appeals decision
## 
### ANN POLLOCK 
University employes will appeal a
Santa Clara County Superior Court de
cision that dismissed their lawsuit
against the University over the new
parking regulations and fees.
United Stanford Employees (USE),
Local 12 of the International Associa
tion of Firefighters and several indi
vidual employes filed a notice in North
County Superior Court on Jan. 2.
The class action suit challenged the
constitutionality of California Vehicle
Code Section 21113, which authorizes
universities and other institutions to
establish parking regulations on their
property.
The case was first heard by Superior
Court Judge William Ingram on Nov.
18, and will now go to the appellate
division of Superior Court.
"The decision to appeal was made a
long time ago when we first talked to
other union officials who felt our case
would be defeated in the lower
courts," said Jim Berk, USE president.
"We decided to pursue it as far as we
must, and this is just the next avenue of

pursuit."
Berk said that the appeal will proba
bly consist of a reintroduction of
the entire case, since it was rejected in
all areas in its first hearing.
Costs of the appeal will be shared
among the people who filed the suit,
Berk said. They will also solicit dona
tions.
