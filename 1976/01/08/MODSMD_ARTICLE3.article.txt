# Lawyer decries power of corporations
## 
### ANN AMIOKA MARC STRASSMAN 
The importance of corporate power
asa political issue isgenerally undere
stimated, according to Joel Seligman,
corporate law expert for Ralph Nader's
Corporate Accountability Research
Group (CARG).
Speaking at the law school yester
day afternoon in a talk sponsored by
Stanford-in-Law and the Law Forum,
Seligman, a 1974 Harvard Law School
graduate, declared that concentration
of economic power affects more than
concentration of wealth and high
prices.
The "most frightening aspect of cor
porate power" is the large amount of
toxic substances released into the en
vironment by large industries, Selig
man said.
Great polluters
According to Seligman, "at least
one-half" of the water and air pollu

tion in the United States has "indust
rial origins."
He noted that in the past two or three
years, studies have shown that 60 to 90
percent of the various types of cancer
"probably have an environmental
basis." Analyses of death certificates,
he added, have shown cancer-related
deaths to be concentrated around fac
tories.
Besides these "life and breath" is
sues, large corporations contribute to
the perpetuation of job discrimination,
Seligman said. There is an "almost
thorough exclusion, with a few excep
tions, of blacks and women from the
upper echelons of corporate power."
he said.
Government impotence
"We have to recognize that the pre
eminent social institutions in our
country are he large corporations,"
Seligman said. He emphasized that in
the 1970s increasing corporate power
is taking forms such that "even gov
ernment is losing its ability to hold
these large corporations accountable."
From 1966-1971, multi-national
companies contributed to unemploy
ment by exporting over one million
jobs to countries such as Mexico,
where labor costs are lower, Seligman
said.
Through a technique known as
transfer accounting, companies can
record large profits in a country with
low tax rates and losses in a country
with high rates. Thus the companies
can increase their overall profits,
Seligman explained.
To illustrate the influence corpora
tions exert on foreign affairs, Seligman
described an incident during the
Arab-Israeli war in which the Standard
Oil Company refused to supply
gasoline for the U.S. Navy because the

Arabs, who were supplying Standard
Oil, had threatened to cut off Stan
dard's fuel supply if the company
aided the United States..
Oil corporations have even refused
to reveal figures of current supplies,
Seligman said, and There are "no pre
sent U.S. laws to force them" to do so.
More antitrust laws
Saying it is time for effective antit
rust laws to be enacted, Seligman re
ported that Nader's corporate research
group is preparing for a Jan. 25 publi
cation of "our version of the Federal
Corporate Chartering Act."
According to Seligman, the 600-
page publication will address five is

sues: centralizing primary industries
in the U.S., changing internal corpo
rate management, requiring greater
disclosure of the social impact of a
company's actions, supporting
employes' rights and prohibiting pre
ferential treatment in employment,
selling and buying.
CARG proposes to deconcentrate
large industries by enacting "an effec
tive antitrust law for the first time in
this country," Seligman said. The law
would include a provision that would
automatically trigger prosecution if a
corporation or small group of corpora
tions controlled a designated large
share of the market, he said.

with high rates. Thus the companies
can increase their overall profits,
Seligman explained.
To illustrate the influence corpora
tions exert on foreign affairs, Seligman
described an incident during the
Arab-Israeli war in which the Standard
Oil Company refused to supply
gasoline for the U.S. Navy because the

Arabs, who were supplying Standard
Oil, had threatened to cut off Stan
dard's fuel supply if the company
aided the United States..
Oil corporations have even refused
to reveal figures of current supplies,
Seligman said, and There are "no pre
sent U.S. laws to force them" to do so.
More antitrust laws
Saying it is time for effective antit
rust laws to be enacted, Seligman re
ported that Nader's corporate research
group is preparing for a Jan. 25 publi
cation of "our version of the Federal
Corporate Chartering Act."
According to Seligman, the 600-
page publication will address five is

sues: centralizing primary industries
in the U.S., changing internal corpo
rate management, requiring greater
disclosure of the social impact of a
company's actions, supporting
employes' rights and prohibiting pre
ferential treatment in employment,
selling and buying.
CARG proposes to deconcentrate
large industries by enacting "an effec
tive antitrust law for the first time in
this country," Seligman said. The law
would include a provision that would
automatically trigger prosecution if a
corporation or small group of corpora
tions controlled a designated large
share of the market, he said.


NADER'S RAlDER—Growing public indignation about the abuses of corpo
rate wealth may cause big business to become a political issue, Joel Seligman,
a law expert for Ra Iph Nader's Corporate Accountability Research Group,told
a law school audience yesterday.
The importance of corporate power
asa political issue isgenerally undere
stimated, according to Joel Seligman,
corporate law expert for Ralph Nader's
Corporate Accountability Research
Group (CARG).
Speaking at the law school yester
day afternoon in a talk sponsored by
Stanford-in-Law and the Law Forum,
Seligman, a 1974 Harvard Law School
graduate, declared that concentration
of economic power affects more than
concentration of wealth and high
prices.
The "most frightening aspect of cor
porate power" is the large amount of
toxic substances released into the en
vironment by large industries, Selig
man said.
Great polluters
According to Seligman, "at least
one-half" of the water and air pollu

tion in the United States has "indust
rial origins."
He noted that in the past two or three
years, studies have shown that 60 to 90
percent of the various types of cancer
"probably have an environmental
basis." Analyses of death certificates,
he added, have shown cancer-related
deaths to be concentrated around fac
tories.
Besides these "life and breath" is
sues, large corporations contribute to
the perpetuation of job discrimination,
Seligman said. There is an "almost
thorough exclusion, with a few excep
tions, of blacks and women from the
upper echelons of corporate power."
he said.
Government impotence
"We have to recognize that the pre
eminent social institutions in our
country are he large corporations,"
Seligman said. He emphasized that in
the 1970s increasing corporate power
is taking forms such that "even gov
ernment is losing its ability to hold
these large corporations accountable."
From 1966-1971, multi-national
companies contributed to unemploy
ment by exporting over one million
jobs to countries such as Mexico,
where labor costs are lower, Seligman
said.
Through a technique known as
transfer accounting, companies can
record large profits in a country with
low tax rates and losses in a country
with high rates. Thus the companies
can increase their overall profits,
Seligman explained.
