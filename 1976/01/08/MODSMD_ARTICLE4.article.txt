# Graduation speaker decision is near
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The Commencement Speaker Selec
tion Committee has limited its choices
to either three or four persons, but has
decided not to disclose the names, and
will probably announce its decision by
the end of the quarter.
But the Daily has learned that the
names were chosen from among the
following nine: Rep. Yvonne Burke
(D-L.A.); W. Beverly Carter, former
ambassador to Tanzania; Robert Coles,
a Pulitzer-Prize-winning psychiatrist;
Jill Conway, president of Smith Col
lege; alumnus John Gardner, a Trustee
of the University and chairman of
Common Cause; Coretta King, widow
of Martin Luther King Jr.; Carla Hills,
an alumna and secretary of Housing
and Urban Development; feminist au
thor Susan Brownmiller and Addie
Wyatt, president of the Amalgamated
Meat Packers Union.

Assistant to the President William
Stone, who said the committee had
narrowed its names to four, argued
that a disclosure of the names might
lessen the committee's chances of get
ting its desired speaker. Senior class
president Walter Spevak said the
committee had narrowed the list to
three. Both are committee members.
No referendum
Spevak said. "I'd prefer more pub
licity. because then there would be a
better chance of student feedback, but
we must also consider the people's
(possible commencement speaker's)
feelings involved. A person might not
like to find out he was the fourth or
fifth choice."
For these and other reasons, Spevak
said, he was "100 percent convinced
that a student referendum is not the
best way to pick a commencement
speaker."
He said that some of the people who
would "filter to the top" of the list re
sulting from such a poll either would
not or could not come.
New list
This, he said,partially explains why
only oneof the four names on the list of
candidates he had supplied the Daily
last quarter is also on the current list.
Those four names were composer
Aaron Copland, Rep. Barbara Jordan
(I)-Tex.), Carter and cartoonist Gary
Trudeau.
"Some of them we found out were
not good speakers," he said. "Some
just don't give that kind of address."
He cited Trudeau as an example. "1
spent almost one and a half days cal
ling universities back East . . . only to
find he doesn't give addresses."
Spevak explained that "We got it
down to those four and after studying
them, I would say we had to reevaluate
things and open things back up."
Telephone sampling
He said that the committee took nine
final choices back to seniors and
graduate students receiving degrees,
via a random telephone sampling.
Each student was asked to list his or
her top and bottom three choices.
But of the top five names, he said,
three "don't give commencement ad
dresses," another was "impractical"
because of high government position,
and the fifth "had just spoken at Stan
ford."
Other top choices, such as novelist
Saul Bellow, are scheduled to speak
here in coming months, and were
therefore rejected.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., also a
popular choice, "just doesn't like to
give addresses," Spevak said.
The committee will give its final list
to President Richard Lyman, who will
select a speaker to be invited. Lyman
will send a formal invitation, and the
senior class officers will send "a more
friendly one," Spevak added.
"Invitations will probably be mailed
out within the next three or four days,"
Stone said.
Announcement soon
Spevak said he was "certain" a deci
sion would be announced before the
end of the quarter.
Although he generally considered
this year's commencement process
"improved" over last year's, Spevak
said he would like "at least one
(graduate student) to participate in the
final process."
Last year a storm of protest erupted
after the selection of Daniel Moyni
han,, now ambassador to the U.N., as
commencement speaker. The selec
tion process at the time was criticized
for its secrecy.
Moynihan was the fourth candidate
on last year's invitation list.

The committee will give its final list
to President Richard Lyman, who will
select a speaker to be invited. Lyman
will send a formal invitation, and the
senior class officers will send "a more
friendly one," Spevak added.
"Invitations will probably be mailed
out within the next three or four days,"
Stone said.
Announcement soon
Spevak said he was "certain" a deci
sion would be announced before the
end of the quarter.
Although he generally considered
this year's commencement process
"improved" over last year's, Spevak
said he would like "at least one
(graduate student) to participate in the
final process."
Last year a storm of protest erupted
after the selection of Daniel Moyni
han,, now ambassador to the U.N., as
commencement speaker. The selec
tion process at the time was criticized
for its secrecy.
Moynihan was the fourth candidate
on last year's invitation list.
The Commencement Speaker Selec
tion Committee has limited its choices
to either three or four persons, but has
decided not to disclose the names, and
will probably announce its decision by
the end of the quarter.
But the Daily has learned that the
names were chosen from among the
following nine: Rep. Yvonne Burke
(D-L.A.); W. Beverly Carter, former
ambassador to Tanzania; Robert Coles,
a Pulitzer-Prize-winning psychiatrist;
Jill Conway, president of Smith Col
lege; alumnus John Gardner, a Trustee
of the University and chairman of
Common Cause; Coretta King, widow
of Martin Luther King Jr.; Carla Hills,
an alumna and secretary of Housing
and Urban Development; feminist au
thor Susan Brownmiller and Addie
Wyatt, president of the Amalgamated
Meat Packers Union.

Assistant to the President William
Stone, who said the committee had
narrowed its names to four, argued
that a disclosure of the names might
lessen the committee's chances of get
ting its desired speaker. Senior class
president Walter Spevak said the
committee had narrowed the list to
three. Both are committee members.
No referendum
Spevak said. "I'd prefer more pub
licity. because then there would be a
better chance of student feedback, but
we must also consider the people's
(possible commencement speaker's)
feelings involved. A person might not
like to find out he was the fourth or
fifth choice."
For these and other reasons, Spevak
said, he was "100 percent convinced
that a student referendum is not the
best way to pick a commencement
speaker."
He said that some of the people who
would "filter to the top" of the list re
sulting from such a poll either would
not or could not come.
New list
This, he said,partially explains why
only oneof the four names on the list of
candidates he had supplied the Daily
last quarter is also on the current list.
Those four names were composer
Aaron Copland, Rep. Barbara Jordan
(I)-Tex.), Carter and cartoonist Gary
Trudeau.
"Some of them we found out were
not good speakers," he said. "Some
just don't give that kind of address."
He cited Trudeau as an example. "1
spent almost one and a half days cal
ling universities back East . . . only to
find he doesn't give addresses."
Spevak explained that "We got it
down to those four and after studying
them, I would say we had to reevaluate
things and open things back up."
Telephone sampling
He said that the committee took nine
final choices back to seniors and
graduate students receiving degrees,
via a random telephone sampling.
Each student was asked to list his or
her top and bottom three choices.
But of the top five names, he said,
three "don't give commencement ad
dresses," another was "impractical"
because of high government position,
and the fifth "had just spoken at Stan
ford."
Other top choices, such as novelist
Saul Bellow, are scheduled to speak
here in coming months, and were
therefore rejected.
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., also a
popular choice, "just doesn't like to
give addresses," Spevak said.
The committee will give its final list
to President Richard Lyman, who will
select a speaker to be invited. Lyman
will send a formal invitation, and the
