# Property tax is $300,000
## Leases ease University tax burden 
### MARC STRASSMAN 
According to the University's
Founding Grant, Stanford land can
never be sold or used for any purposes
other than education. Land manage
ment here still follows these princi
ples, said George Burtness, assistant
manager of land resources.
However, University land not ac
tively used for learning functions is
taxed by both Santa Clara and San
Mateo Counties, so the Board of Trus
tees has turned to leasing property as a

means of offsetting losses.
The University's "back 4000 acres,"
as administrators label the near
wilderness. contains everything from
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
to the Jasper Ridge Biological Reserve.
$100,000 from rents
Some $100,000 a year is generated
from leases to private concerns, in
cluding some 2500 acres used for cat
tle and horse grazing. 77 acres for
horse raising, 240 acres for a vegetable
farm and nearly 50 acres for two tree

growing concerns.
Taxes on the properties, however,
cost the University $300,000 annually.
"Our goal is to make enough from
the leases to pay the taxes, which isn't
the case right now. If we can do that,
we'll be doing all right," said Burtness,
adding that the University is now short
"by $200,000."
The value of undeveloped land here,
if it were possible to sell it, could be as
much as $100 million, figuring
$25,000 an acre, said Burtness. The
total assessed valuation is not kept
track of, Burtness revealed, as calculat
ing it would involve adding up more
than 100 figures for separately asses
sed plots.
Off-campus holdings
In addition to supervising contigu
ous University lands (except for the
shopping center, industrial park and
central campus). Burtness also has re
sponsibility for off-campus land hold
ings.
Some 120 plots of land — ranging
from a quarter-acre plot in Oakland to
an 800-acre parcel in Montebello
Ridge — are owned by the ' Jniversity.
Many land grants are sold shortly after
donation; in fact, the University is cur
rently disposing of a 5000-acre site,
Burtness noted.
Burtness was unable to estimate the
value or total size of these holdings,
noting there is a constant inflow and
outflow of off-campus land, but said
there is "an awful lot of it." Most of this
is in California, especially in Kern,
Santa Clara and Los Angeles Counties.
Other holdings are in 10 states, from

New York to Hawaii.
Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance, receives re
commendations from Burtness on
which land to sell. Augsburger can
approve sales of less than $250,000;
other sales must go before the Board of
Trustees. Off-campus land sales have
totaled $5 million since 1971.
One goal of University land man
agement is to maintain flexibility of
purpose, Burtness said. As a result,
leases are usually held to less than five
years; some are as brief as one year.
Condemnations possible
Though the University cannot sell
campus land, governmental agencies
can legally condemn the land and
reimburse the school. Palo Alto has not
taken such action within recent mem
ory, according to Burtness and also
Palo Alto employes contacted yester
day. but last year San Mateo County
condemned one-half acre to widen Al
pine Road.
The federal government condemned
some 250 acres for use in building In
terstate 280.
More common is the condemnation
of underground parcels used for
utilities, which prevents future
above-ground use other than growing
grass, Burtness said.
As for the future of the University's
local undeveloped property. Burtness
says it will remain generally no more
developed than it now is (as required
by the Founding Grant) into the inde
finite future.
