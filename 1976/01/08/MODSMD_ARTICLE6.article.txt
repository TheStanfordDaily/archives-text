Residence priority
Editor:
The Committee on Services to
Students (COSSJ subcommittee
on residences has recommended
that freshmen should no longer
be allowed present residence
priortiy. As subcommittee
chairman Paul Sobotka states,
"For a long time it (the system)
has been recognized as inequita
ble."
Even casual examination re
veals the system is unfair, yet
COSS has recommended that the
change become effective in the
spring draw of 1977. My posi
tion: we can and should change
it now.
There are two groups which
oppose the change now:
freshmen in four-class dorms
and our own administration.
The freshmen in four-class
dorms oppose the change on the
grounds that the option of con
tinuity in this type of residence
is one reason they chose to live
there. It is a type of compensa
tion for what they "missed out
on by not being in an all
freshman house."
But no official university in
formation concerning this con
tinuity option was given, to en
tering freshmen when they made
their housing choice. Those few
freshmen in four-class dor
mitories who are there for con
tinuity, then, had previous
privileged information. All
others live there for different
reasons — be those what they
may. Therefore these students
have a decided advantage over
the majority of the freshmen —
why might they oppose an im
mediate change?
The policy of our administra
tion, according to COSS chair
man Dan Poston, is that the

changeshould comeabout in the
"least controversial way possi
ble." By delaying until 1977 to
make the correction, the ad
ministraton avoids some con
troversy among this year's
freshmen.
The system as it stands now is
"unfair"; it gives a right to the
privileged few. Most freshmen
live in all-freshman dorms. Most
freshmen are being hurt. The
administration and our student
representatives agree that a
change is needed. There is no
actual need to perpetuate a bad
system any longer. "Make the
change effective for the 1976
spring draw.
A change now would require
courage on the part of the ad
ministration to tackle something
that has been deemed "controv
ersial." Courage is required for
the freshmen in four-class resi
dences to take a look at the over
all situation affecting the rest of
us, and then to reevaluate their
priorities.

Ethnic jokes
Editor:
I've had as much as I can take
of these "ethnic slur" blurbs
which seem to grace the pages of
your paper every other day. It
seems like everyone has lost his
sense of himor, or worse yet, has
lost so much self-diginity as to
be truly incensed by such things
as a "Made in Japan" label in a
political cartoon.
In the views of some of your
contributors, I must be truly u
nique if I can laugh at an ethnic
joke and realize "Hey, its only a
joke!" God save me, I tell jokes
about my own race.
