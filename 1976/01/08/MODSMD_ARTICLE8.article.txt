# Arabs don't support refugees
## 
### 
(First of two parts)
One of the most important aspects of the
Middle East problem is the issue of Palesti
nian rights. As in most other areas of the
problem, however, few people actually
know the facts.
For years now, the Arabs have been tel
ling the world that they have been fighting
for the rights of the Palestinian refugees. Yet
in May 1948, when the combined armies of
six Arab states simultaneously attacked the
new-born state of Israel from every side (ex
cept the sea), there were no Palestinian re
fugees.
The refugees were created only as a result
of that war. So why did the Arabs attack?
The answer: to prevent the creation of the
Jewish state.
History lesson: Has there ever been a con
crete proposal for a Palestinian state in the
mid-East? Yes. How many countries recog
nized that state? One. Which country was
that? Israel.
U.N. vote
Facts: In 1947, the United Nations voted
to partition Palestine into an Arab state and
a Jewish state. The population of the area to
be given to the Jewish state (which occupied
only one-eighth of Palestine and included
the Negev Desert) was over half Jewish: the
population of the other area was over half
Palestinian Arab.
Israel immediately recognized the Arab
part as the Palestinian Arab state. Nobody
else ever has — including the Arabs, who
rejected the partition outright.
What happened to the territory which

was granted to the Palestinian state? Most of
it was occupied by Jordan after the 1949
Armistice and became part of Jordan.
The Palestinian refugees: Why did they
leave? With few exceptions, it was voluntar
ily. Wealthy Arabs began the exodus im
mediately after the U.N. partition vote, ex
pecting to return soon to celebrate a quick
Arab victory over the infant Jewish state.
Encouraged to leave
Even though the Jews tried to persuade
the Palestinians to remain, and guaranteed
their safety, the Arab High Committee (the
official leadership of the Palestinian Arabs)
encouraged them to leave, so that they
wouldn't get in the way of the invading
Arab armies. The Committee assured the
Palestinians that they would be able to re
turn to their homes very shortly in the wake
of the victorious Arab armies and would not
only recover their own property which they
had left behind, but also the houses and
farms of the vanquished and annihilated
Jews.
Habib Issa wrote in the New York
Lebanese daily newspaper A 1 Hoda in 1951:
"The Secretary Ceneral of the Arab
League, Azzam Pasha, assured the Arab
peoples that the occupation of Palestine and
Tel Aviv would be as simple as a military
promenade. . . He pointed out that they
were already on the frontiers and that all the
millions the Jews had spent on land and
economic development would be easy
booty, for it would be a simple matter to
throw Jews into the Mediterranean. . .
"Brotherly advice was given to the Arabs

Robert Smith II
of Palestine to leave their land, home and
property and to stay temporarily in
neighboring fraternal states, lest the guns of
the invading Arab armies mow them
down."
Emil Ghoury, Secretary of the Arab High
Committee, said in an interview with a
Beirut newspaper in 1948: "The fact that
there are these refugees is the direct con
sequence of the action of the Arab states in
opposing partition and the Jewish state. The
Arab states agreed upon this policy unani
mously and they must share in the solu
tion."
Indeed they must. Estimates based on the
British Mandatory Census of 1946 showed
520-650,000 Palestinian refugees. The U.N.
estimate was 715-730,000. At the same time,
after the 1948 war, the Arab nations expel
led 900,000 Jewish citizens and confiscated
their property. Approximately 750,000 of
them settled in Israel.
Israel did not put these Jewish refugees
into squalid refugee camps on their borders
as showcases to the world. Israel did not
keep these Jewish refugees living in pathe
tic conditions. Israel absorbed these Jews
into its population.
Yet the Arabs have not shown their Pales
tinian brothers the same hospitality. It must
be remembered that there are no refugee
camps in Israel. They are all in Arab coun
tries. Israel keeps no Palestinians in squalid
refugee camps. Only Arab states keep the
Palestinians in such misery and poverty.

For years now, the Arabs have been tel
ling the world that they have been fighting
for the rights of the Palestinian refugees. Yet
in May 1948, when the combined armies of
six Arab states simultaneously attacked the
new-born state of Israel from every side (ex
cept the sea), there were no Palestinian re
fugees.
The refugees were created only as a result
of that war. So why did the Arabs attack?
The answer: to prevent the creation of the
Jewish state.
History lesson: Has there ever been a con
crete proposal for a Palestinian state in the
mid-East? Yes. How many countries recog
nized that state? One. Which country was
that? Israel.
U.N. vote
Facts: In 1947, the United Nations voted
to partition Palestine into an Arab state and
a Jewish state. The population of the area to
be given to the Jewish state (which occupied
only one-eighth of Palestine and included
the Negev Desert) was over half Jewish: the
population of the other area was over half
Palestinian Arab.
Israel immediately recognized the Arab
part as the Palestinian Arab state. Nobody
else ever has — including the Arabs, who
rejected the partition outright.
What happened to the territory which

was granted to the Palestinian state? Most of
it was occupied by Jordan after the 1949
Armistice and became part of Jordan.
The Palestinian refugees: Why did they
leave? With few exceptions, it was voluntar
ily. Wealthy Arabs began the exodus im
mediately after the U.N. partition vote, ex
pecting to return soon to celebrate a quick
Arab victory over the infant Jewish state.
Encouraged to leave
Even though the Jews tried to persuade
the Palestinians to remain, and guaranteed
their safety, the Arab High Committee (the
official leadership of the Palestinian Arabs)
encouraged them to leave, so that they
wouldn't get in the way of the invading
Arab armies. The Committee assured the
Palestinians that they would be able to re
turn to their homes very shortly in the wake
of the victorious Arab armies and would not
only recover their own property which they
had left behind, but also the houses and
farms of the vanquished and annihilated
Jews.
Habib Issa wrote in the New York
Lebanese daily newspaper A 1 Hoda in 1951:
"The Secretary Ceneral of the Arab
League, Azzam Pasha, assured the Arab
peoples that the occupation of Palestine and
Tel Aviv would be as simple as a military
promenade. . . He pointed out that they
were already on the frontiers and that all the
millions the Jews had spent on land and
economic development would be easy
booty, for it would be a simple matter to
throw Jews into the Mediterranean. . .
"Brotherly advice was given to the Arabs

Robert Smith II
of Palestine to leave their land, home and
property and to stay temporarily in
neighboring fraternal states, lest the guns of
the invading Arab armies mow them
down."
Emil Ghoury, Secretary of the Arab High
Committee, said in an interview with a
Beirut newspaper in 1948: "The fact that
there are these refugees is the direct con
sequence of the action of the Arab states in
opposing partition and the Jewish state. The
Arab states agreed upon this policy unani
mously and they must share in the solu
tion."
Indeed they must. Estimates based on the
British Mandatory Census of 1946 showed
520-650,000 Palestinian refugees. The U.N.
estimate was 715-730,000. At the same time,
after the 1948 war, the Arab nations expel
led 900,000 Jewish citizens and confiscated
their property. Approximately 750,000 of
them settled in Israel.
Israel did not put these Jewish refugees
into squalid refugee camps on their borders
as showcases to the world. Israel did not
keep these Jewish refugees living in pathe
tic conditions. Israel absorbed these Jews
into its population.
Yet the Arabs have not shown their Pales
tinian brothers the same hospitality. It must
be remembered that there are no refugee
camps in Israel. They are all in Arab coun
tries. Israel keeps no Palestinians in squalid
refugee camps. Only Arab states keep the
Palestinians in such misery and poverty.
