# 'Arena' cheapens its cause

While sauntering into Cubber
ley last dead week 1 saw a stack
of newsprint alongside Daryl
Bern's lecture outline. Not want
ing to offend Daryl, 1 first
glanced at his outline, then(
ravenously tore through The
Stanford Arena — some more
"alternative press." While I
mightily support the idea of al
ternative press, the Arena bum
med me out.
1 studied overseas last year, so
this was my first Arena. 1 en
joyed many of the articles: Dan
Livingston mentioned some
valuable ideas on the efforts of
the ASSU Senate, and the true (?)
history of the mascot qustion in-1
trigued me. The Arena also did a
very good job exposing the guest
professor fiasco.
The paper's over-riding style,
however, annoyed me enough to
provoke a strong dislike.
Cheap-shot journalism, from
"The ASSU Senate, that great
repository of the Student Body's
moral conscience. . ." to "Sur
prisingly enough, it was the
Daily who (Which, maybe?)
exhibited the greatest bit of wis- 112
dom. . ." to "the Senate showed
an uncommon bit of wis
dom. . ~" destroyed whatever
merit the paper hoped to con
tain.
These supposedly "cute" re
marks resemble shabby stuff
thrown in for effect; they irritate
and only weaken one's estima
tion of the people and ideas be
hind the articles.
Add an editorial that attacked
the Daily editorials because
they're biased — similar to get- (
ting angry with a steamroller for
flattening the road; that's what
each is supposed to do — and the
Arena proved itself essentially
useless.
The conservative viewpoint,
mostly soft-spoken and poorly
understood, sorely needs to be
logically and clearly presented.
The Stanford Arena only
strengthens many psuedo
liberals' belief that conservatives
are selfish, bigoted rednecks. It's
unfortunate that the paper,
cheapens itself and its cause
when it intends to solidify them.
Get it together. Arena makers.
