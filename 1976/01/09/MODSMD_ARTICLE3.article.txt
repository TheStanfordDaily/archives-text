# Stanford's home at last
## Holiday roadtrip leaves Cards 4-6 
### CHRIS BAKER 
By all the normal rules, Stanford should be 8-2
going into its first weekend of Pacific Eight play.
The Cards have out rebounded and out shot all but
two of their opponents.
But that's where normality ends. Referees from
Baton Rouge to Milwaukee, have been more
generous than the Stanford parking people, in
sending opponents to the free throw stripe.
"I sent the officials Christmas cards," joked
Stanford Coach Dißiaso, "to let them know we're
not the enemy."
53 fouls
Officials disqualified four Cards in Stanford's
89-85 loss to Louisiana State two weeks ago. And
two Cards played with four fouls, in an LSU game
which saw 53 total fouls and 66 free throws. So
Stanford, which embarked upon its holiday travels
with a 4-3 record limps back into Maples with a 4-6
mark.
"We like to think of the season in three parts,"
said Dißiaso. "The first part was the pre-season
and the opening four games. The second part con
sists of the six games during the vacation. The
third part is the Pac-8."
Well, the first part of the third part is
Washington State, and Stanford might just like
this one-third.
The monsters froYn the Palouse aren't exactly
monsters. Or at least four of the Cougars aren't. The
fifth? Well he's 6-foot-ll junior center Steve
Puidokas, who seems to have been aound Pullman
almost as long as Bohler Gym. The Pud averages

19.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and five quotes from
Coach George Raveling per game.
"Steve is a true All-American, if he's not an
All-American he is at least All-Universe," over
states Raveling. Dißiaso calls Puidokas "a chal
lenging task."
Eighth ranked
Even more challenging though is the University
of Washington. The l'ac-8 usually has three of its
members in the wire service basketball rankings.
But Washington?
The Huskies, who never play east of Nebraska,
have gotten the votes of sports writers all across the
country. Currently the league's only unbeaten
team with an 11 -C) mark. Washington seems to be
getting stronger.
But Dißiaso says his Cards will be ready for the
task ahead. "This team isn't down at all, their
spirits are very high. . . I think they're ready to do a
great job this weekend."
And the next weekend? "This is a crucial time
for us," said Dißiaso. "We're opening the Pac-8
season and three of our first four opponents are
among the top 10 or 15 teams in the nation," said
Dißiaso. But Stanford has the advantage of open
ing the season at home, a distinct edge with the
NCAA's new 10-man traveling squad edict.
One Card who didn't feel the effects of Stan
ford's three-game losing string on the road was
forward Ed Schweitzer. The 6-8 senior scored f3O
points and pulled down 51 rebounds in Stanford's
three losses on the road. In the Milwaukee Classic,
SchweitzeT tied Dave Cowen's tournament record
with 51 rebounds.

Dißiaso. But Stanford has the advantage of open
ing the season at home, a distinct edge with the
NCAA's new 10-man traveling squad edict.
One Card who didn't feel the effects of Stan
ford's three-game losing string on the road was
forward Ed Schweitzer. The 6-8 senior scored f3O
points and pulled down 51 rebounds in Stanford's
three losses on the road. In the Milwaukee Classic,
SchweitzeT tied Dave Cowen's tournament record
with 51 rebounds.
By all the normal rules, Stanford should be 8-2
going into its first weekend of Pacific Eight play.
The Cards have out rebounded and out shot all but
two of their opponents.
But that's where normality ends. Referees from
Baton Rouge to Milwaukee, have been more
generous than the Stanford parking people, in
sending opponents to the free throw stripe.
"I sent the officials Christmas cards," joked
Stanford Coach Dißiaso, "to let them know we're
not the enemy."
53 fouls
Officials disqualified four Cards in Stanford's
89-85 loss to Louisiana State two weeks ago. And
two Cards played with four fouls, in an LSU game
which saw 53 total fouls and 66 free throws. So
Stanford, which embarked upon its holiday travels
with a 4-3 record limps back into Maples with a 4-6
mark.
"We like to think of the season in three parts,"
said Dißiaso. "The first part was the pre-season
and the opening four games. The second part con
sists of the six games during the vacation. The
third part is the Pac-8."
Well, the first part of the third part is
Washington State, and Stanford might just like
this one-third.
The monsters froYn the Palouse aren't exactly
monsters. Or at least four of the Cougars aren't. The
fifth? Well he's 6-foot-ll junior center Steve
Puidokas, who seems to have been aound Pullman
almost as long as Bohler Gym. The Pud averages

19.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and five quotes from
Coach George Raveling per game.
"Steve is a true All-American, if he's not an
All-American he is at least All-Universe," over
states Raveling. Dißiaso calls Puidokas "a chal
lenging task."
Eighth ranked
Even more challenging though is the University
of Washington. The l'ac-8 usually has three of its
members in the wire service basketball rankings.
But Washington?
The Huskies, who never play east of Nebraska,
have gotten the votes of sports writers all across the
country. Currently the league's only unbeaten
team with an 11 -C) mark. Washington seems to be
getting stronger.
But Dißiaso says his Cards will be ready for the
task ahead. "This team isn't down at all, their
spirits are very high. . . I think they're ready to do a
great job this weekend."
And the next weekend? "This is a crucial time
for us," said Dißiaso. "We're opening the Pac-8
season and three of our first four opponents are
among the top 10 or 15 teams in the nation," said
Dißiaso. But Stanford has the advantage of open
