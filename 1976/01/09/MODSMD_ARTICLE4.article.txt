# Tall Huskies a surprise
## ...but Washington State's also improved 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
The 1976 Pac-8 basketball season opens tonight
as Stanford plays host to Washington and
Washington State.
So far this year, Stanford is the only Pac-8 club
under the .500 mark, entering the conference slate
with a 4-6 record. Three of the losses, however,
were dealt by teams ranked in the naton's top
twenty.
Only one conference team completed the pre
season campaign undefeated. No, it's not defend
ing national champion UCLA nor is it LJSC. In
stead, it's Stanford's Saturday night opponent, the
surprising Washington Huskies.
Best start
Off to their best start in history, the Huskies
come to the Bay Area with an 11-0 record and are
currently ranked fifth in the country by IJPI and
eighth by AP.
Washington won the Far West classic in Port
land over the holidays and have demolished their
opposition by nearly twenty points per game.
The Seattle squad is probably the biggest threat
to UCLA. Last year the Huskies routed the Bruins
103-81 .it Seattle.
Coach Marv Harshman throws one of the na
tion's tallest front lines at the Cards with 7-foot
junior center James Edwards and forwards senior
Lars Hansen (6-11) and sophomore Kim Stewart
(6-7). Off the bench. Harshman has 6-10 senior
Larry Jackson, who started earlier in the season
until severely twisting his knee in a December
game against Nebraska. Jackson has not played
since that contest but is expected to see some ac
tion this weekend.
Edwards and Hansen split playing time at the
center spot last year. Edwards is averaging 17.5
points per game and likes the jump shot, while
Hansen, a member of the Canadian National team,
uses the sweeping hook and contributes 13.6
points a contest. Hansen led the conference in field
goal percentage last year. Edwards is apparently
recovered after suffering through a case of hemor
rhoids last .month.

In the backcourt, Harshman starts 6-1 Chet "the
jet" Dorsey and 6-4 leaper Clarence Ramsey. Dor
sev isthe playmakerand cnntributes4.7 assists per
game. Ramsey, a senior, leads the Huskies with a
17.6 scoring average. He likes to pump from the
outside and often hits from the 20-25 foot range,
but he also frequently scores on the back-door
play. Ramsey suffered a sprained ankle in a game
last week against Seattle U. but will still probably
start.
The Dogs often employ a switching defense,

playing man-to-man and then
sagging into a tight 2-3 zone. The
combination has proved difficult
to beat. Stanford most likely will
need some good outside shooting
to upset the Washington squad.
The Huskies use their speed to
get back quickly on defense. Thus
allowing few fast break lay-ups.
Vocal Marv Harshman, in his
fifth season at Washington after
spending 13 years at Washington
State, coached the U.S. cage squad
to the gold medal in last fall's
Pan-Am games. He suffered
through a "disappointing" 16-10
campaign in 1974-75 and has his
team pointed to the NCAA tour
nament. Dick Dißiaso's Cards still
hope to deter the Huskies from
that goal.
Puidokas
Friday night Stanford takes on
the Washington State Cougars.
Center Steve Puidokas leads the
Cougars, who are currently 7-2.
The 6-11 Puidokas was the con
ference's leading scorer last sea
son, beating out runner-up Gus

Williams of USC and now of the
Golden State Warriors. Puidokas
is averaging 19.4 points and 12.4
rebounds per contest this season.
Cougar Coach George Ravel ing,
in his fouth year as head man, has
three other players in double fi
gures, 6-5 Ron Davis (15.9 points
per game), 6-4 Edgar Jeffries
(10.9), and 6-3 Harold Rhodes
(10.3). The other position is filled
by either 6-0 Ken Jones or 6-2
Marty Giovacchini, who leads the
club in assists and is the older
brother of Stanford guard Paul
Giovacchini. Nortin Barnhill also
gets plenty of game time.
The Cougars finished the
1974-75 season with a 1-13 con
ference mark and were 10-16
overall. Stanford should get the
win here as the Pullman team had
trouble in defeating Montana
State 95-89, a team the Cards eas
ily beat.
The Cougars do have a flair for
the fancy however. They might
evenstil have their flashy warmup
where the players dribble through
their legs, pass behind their backs,
and applaud themselves.
