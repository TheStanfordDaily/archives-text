# Tall Huskies a surprise
## ...but Washington State's also improved 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
The 1976 Pac-8 basketball season opens tonight
as Stanford plays host to Washington and
Washington State.
So far this year, Stanford is the only Pac-8 club
under the .500 mark, entering the conference slate
with a 4-6 record. Three of the losses, however,
were dealt by teams ranked in the naton's top
twenty.
Only one conference team completed the pre
season campaign undefeated. No, it's not defend
ing national champion UCLA nor is it LJSC. In
stead, it's Stanford's Saturday night opponent, the
surprising Washington Huskies.
Best start
Off to their best start in history, the Huskies
come to the Bay Area with an 11-0 record and are
currently ranked fifth in the country by IJPI and
eighth by AP.
Washington won the Far West classic in Port
land over the holidays and have demolished their
opposition by nearly twenty points per game.
The Seattle squad is probably the biggest threat
to UCLA. Last year the Huskies routed the Bruins
103-81 .it Seattle.
Coach Marv Harshman throws one of the na
tion's tallest front lines at the Cards with 7-foot
junior center James Edwards and forwards senior
Lars Hansen (6-11) and sophomore Kim Stewart
(6-7). Off the bench. Harshman has 6-10 senior
Larry Jackson, who started earlier in the season
until severely twisting his knee in a December
game against Nebraska. Jackson has not played
since that contest but is expected to see some ac
tion this weekend.
Edwards and Hansen split playing time at the
center spot last year. Edwards is averaging 17.5
points per game and likes the jump shot, while
Hansen, a member of the Canadian National team,
uses the sweeping hook and contributes 13.6
points a contest. Hansen led the conference in field
goal percentage last year. Edwards is apparently
recovered after suffering through a case of hemor
rhoids last .month.

In the backcourt, Harshman starts 6-1 Chet "the
jet" Dorsey and 6-4 leaper Clarence Ramsey. Dor
sev isthe playmakerand cnntributes4.7 assists per
game. Ramsey, a senior, leads the Huskies with a
17.6 scoring average. He likes to pump from the
outside and often hits from the 20-25 foot range,
but he also frequently scores on the back-door
play. Ramsey suffered a sprained ankle in a game
last week against Seattle U. but will still probably
start.
The Dogs often employ a switching defense,
