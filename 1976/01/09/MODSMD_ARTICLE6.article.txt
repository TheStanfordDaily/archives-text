# Women move to Maples
## ...but its only for three games 
### 
If you haven't already noticed it,
there is no Junior Varisty basket
ball team this year. Fans coming to
any of Stanford's earlier games
this season have seen preliminary
events ranging from a high school
basketball game to nothing at all.
But all this will change this
weekend. Removed from the
dingy confines of Roble Gym, the
Stanford women's basketball team
will play three games in Maples.
Two of the contests will be pre
liminary games and one will be
after the California game.
The women may represent a
good change of pace from the
Pacific Eight. The Cards' tallest
player is 6-foot-l center Maggie
Nelson. But Head Coach Gay
Coburn's offense might look like
that of another Stanford coach.
The women will employ a run
ning, fast break typt; of offense,
much like Stanford Coach Dick
Dißiaso's style. Using the same
type of offense last year, the
women averaged over 56 points
per game and scored over 75 on
two occasions.
Returning from the 8-3 team
which qualified for the NCIAC
playoffs, are forwards Sonia
Jaruis, Sukie Jackson and center
Maggie Nelson.
At guard, Coburn will use re
turnees Nancy Lovvold and
Stumpy O'Mera. "This is where
we needed help last year," said
Coburn.
The defense won't look much
different than the Card varsity.

Coburn will use a man-to-man
(woman-to-woman) defense.
"With our size, combined with the
implementation of a 30 second
shooting clock, it will be best for
our team," said Coburn.
Last year Stanford allowed just
51 points per game, limiting their
opponents to 40 points three
times.

But despite all those impressive
statistics, the Cards might jiave a
hard time making it to the playoffs
again this year.
Stanford has been placed in the
league's toughest divisin with
Chico State, Hayward State and
Sacramento State. To get to the
playoffs, a team must finish in the
top three in its division.
