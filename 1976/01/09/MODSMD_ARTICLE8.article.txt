# It's all in the family
## Giovacchini's hold reunion 
### BRUCE ANDERSON 
The Pacific Eight opener? Yes.
Coach Dick Dißiaso's Pac-8 de
but? Yes. But Stanford's contest
against Washington State features
yet another first.
Tonight is the first time the
Giovacchini brothers, Paul and
Marty, have ever played against
each other. They both came to the
west coast from Salt Lake City to
play their basketball. Marty is a
junior who starts at guard for the
Cougars; Paul, a freshman, does
his backcourt work here on The
Farm.
The last time they played on the
same court was when Paul was a
sophomore at Judge Memorial
High School and his brother was a
senior. Even then, it wasn't often.
Both played point guard, so Paul
was relegated to the bench as a
hack-up to Marty. It was hardly a
disgrace as Marty was a high
school All-American, as Paul
would later be.
Won state title
With all of the talent that the
Giovacchini clan was contribut
ing to the basketball program at
Judge Memorial, it comes as no
surprise that they have been to the
state finals the last seven years.
Nor were the school's baseball for
tunes hurt when the two would
show up for spring practice. Marty
played outfield, and Paul both
pitched and played shortstop,
earning all-state honors as a
senior.
In addition to his baseball hon
ors and his selection to the
Scholastic Xoach All-American
basketball team, for averaging 23
points and 9.7 assists a game at
Judge, the younger Giovacchini
was his class valedictorian carry
ing a 3.99 grade point average.
Coach Dißiaso, who has never
coached someone playing oppo
site their brother, speaks highly of
Giovacchini. "I hope my children
grow up to be like he is now,"
adding that Paul is a "super
person."
No second thoughts
Would the coach have second
thoughts about sending in

Giovacchini to guard his brother?
"No, none what so ever." Paul's
feelings are that "I have to keep
the game in perspective. We're
both in the middle of a season and
this is just another game."
Paul credits Marty with being
bigger and stronger and says that
against him he would have to try

and play smarter, but that "it
wouldn't be easy because he is
pretty sharp." A last note of re
spect is paid to his brother by Paul
when commenting on his own de
velopment, "It looks like my prog
ress will shape me into a. player
very similar to the player my
brother is now."
