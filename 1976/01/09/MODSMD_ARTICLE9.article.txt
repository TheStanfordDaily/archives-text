# It's the same old story
## UCLA is favored again 
### JEFF TANJI 
On the eve of the Pacific Eight
season last year, USC Coach Bob
Boyd remarked "There are no weak
teams in the conference."
Things have changed considera
bly this year, but as the 1975-76
Pac-8 season unveils this weekend,
one thing hasn't changed. The loop
is still one of the best basketball
conferences in the country.
Three teams are currently ranked
in wire service polls, but anything
can happen, as UCLA found out
last year in Seattle.
The Los Angeles schools opened
the season Thursday night in rainy
Oregon. Fourth-ranked UCLA,
after a rout of Notre Dame, took on
travel weary Oregon.'The Ducks
traveled 14,000 miles last month.
But the fans turned out to pack
ancient Mac Court, to see enough
scrappy tactics to satiate the appe
tite of any Rollerball fan.
Last year UCLA escaped 107-103
and the Bruins schouldn't have to
worry too much this weekend
either.
USC, the surprise team of the
conference, took on Oregon State
Thursday night. Capturing seven
of their last nine conference games
with the aid of 6-9 All-Pac-8 for
ward Lonnie Shelton, the Beavers
are hungrily looking to extend
their winning streak.
Across the Bay on Friday night,
league action features fifth ranked
Washington against California in
what is shaping up as an old
fashioned barn burner. Unfortu
nately for the Bears, another type of
fire may mar their opener.
Carl Bird, the 6-foot-8 forward
who leads the Bears with a 13.3
average, suffered second degree
burns last Sunday while cooking.
Bird is doubtful for this weekend's
action.
UCLA takes on Oregon State in
the conference television game
Saturday afternoon. About the only
thing which may be good about
this game will be if you turn down
the sound. The announcers of the
Pac-8 television broadcasts sound
as if they just left the bar after hav
ing too many drinks.
After the season is over, a few
coaches might be joining them.
