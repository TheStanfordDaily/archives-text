# What does the new dope law mean?

News Analysis
With the start of the new year, a new
era has dawned in California legal his
tory: criminal penalties have been
drastically lessened for possession of
marijuana in small amounts.
However, state Senate Bill (SB) 95
has other ramifications, Santa Clara
County Sheriff's officials and rep
resentatives of the National Organiza
tion for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
commented.
How does the process work if one is
caught with less than one ounce of
pot?
Possession of one ounce or less is a
misdemeanor criminal offense, but in
stead of taking the offender to jail, the
officer will give a citation, providing
the offender can offer satisfactory
identification and is willing to sign a
promise to appear.
The marijuana will be confiscated,
but there will be no booking, no
fingerprinting, and no photographing
of the person cited.
The manner of paying fines, which
cannot exceed $100, varies from
county to county. In some counties a
court appearance will be required,
while in others the offender will be

allowed to send a check without ap
pearing.
Repeat offenses are treated in
exactly the same way. A person being
cited for the tenth time still faces the
same $100 fine, although anyone
foolish or unfortunate enough to be ar
rested four times or more in a two-year
period must attend a drug education or
treatment program.
What happens if one gets caught
with more than one ounce?
Possession of more than one ounce
is now a misdemeanor, with a
maximum penalty of a $500 fine and
six months in jail. The extent of the
penalty often varies according to the
degree of the crime.
Police indicate that because the ar
resting officer has the choice of either
citing the offender or taking him into
custody, a person caught with only a
little more than one ounce will likely
be treated much like someone with
less than an ounce. A person caught
with a pound, however, is likely to
find himself visiting the county jail.
Have penalties for selling small
umounts been lessened?
No, not at all. Anyone caught selling
even a joint is legally in worse shape
than someone who can successfullv

claim the Kilo found in his possession
was merely for personal consumption.
Selling any amount of marijuana re
mains a felony, with a penalty of up to
five years in a state prison.
What about giving aivay small
amounts?
Evidently, the legislature intended
to reward generosity, because giving
away less than one ounce of marijuana
is nothing more than a citable offense
â€” exactly like simple possession. .
Can marijuana be grown privately?
Well, yes. it can, but not legally. Pri
vate cultivation remains a felony, good
for lip to five years in prison. The
enactment of another recent state law
gives a judge the option of lessening
the verdict if the defendant is a first
time offender growing the marijuana
for personal consumption.
Is it still illegal to be at a party where
dope is being smoked?
While few of us have ever been at a
party raided by police, it is still com
forting to know that under the new law
it is now perfectly legal to be at a party
where marijuana is being smoked as
long as the individual is not himself
smoking. Police, in such cases, can't
even issue a citation.
Two other activities that have be

come entirely legal under SB 95 are the
possession of marijuana parapher
nalia. and under most circumstances
being under the influence of
marijuana.
Is hushish covered under the neiv
laiv?
Perhaps somewhat illogically, pos
sessing hashish in any form, despite
producing a generally milder high
than marijuana, is still a felony, mean
ing up to five years in state prison.
Will u person cited for marijuana
use be required to mention it on job
applications?
This depends under which proce
dure a person is cited. Anyone receiv
ing a citation for possessing less than
ounce can honestly say that he has
never been arrested.
If a person is found with more than
one ounce and is arrested, he must
admit the arrest on job applications.
In both cases, though, all records of
the offense are automatically de
stroyed after two years, after which the
frustrated job hunter can deny any
thing he wants with impunity.
However, all felonious uses of
marijuana are recorded permanently.
Incidentally, one of SB 95's provi-
sions allows anyone arrested for sim
ple possession prior to the new law to
wipe out any record of his arrest and
conviction. Roughly 500.000 people
are eligible to have their records erased
under this provision.

ceive (i citation'. 1 '
Police officials indicate that
juveniles will still be taken into c us
tody under the new law. in which case
their guardians will still be informed.
Will the new Inn effectively alter
other post law enforcement policies':*
Realistically speaking, the new law
will probably have little impact on the
small-scale marijuana smoker. Local
law enforcement officials have largel\
ignored the private consumer in recent
years, according to Lt. Stan Shaver of
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's narco
tics division.
Therefore, the law simply ratifies a
situation that already exists rathei
than bringing tangible improvement
to the lives of small-time dope smok
ers.
To the dealer seeking to turn a profit
during these heady times, however.
Shaver warns that "we're not going to
start turning our heads when we hear
about 100 kilos."
