# Overseas cuts need more consideration
## 
### 
It is very irritating to read once
again the idle, irresponsible and
unfounded statement that the
Overseas Studies Office "was
forced to discontinue the Lima,
Peru program in light of serious
questions about its academic
quality and unforeseen financial
problems."
The last time this kind of loose
statement was made through the
Daily (Jan. 15, 1975). all eight of
the students then in Peru sent in
a strong rebuttal (also published
in the Daily). They stated that:
"We strongly argue that the
Stanford-in-Peru Program has
come closest of all the Overseas
Stanford Campuses to fulfilling
the professed philosophy of

"learning from living." Books
and lectures could never have
taught us the reality of a de
veloping country, its political
struggle or the Latin American
culture in general, as has our six
months here."
The decision to discontinue
the program was made by Over
seas Studies before the first pilot
program was half-way com
pleted. No one from Overseas
Studies visited the program, and
no one from the Committee on
Foreign Studies Programs talked
to the Director of the program.
I have been back on the cam
pus since March 15, 1975. 1
wonder what kind of "informed
decisions" are being made in the

absence of information.
On Feb. 10, 1975,1 received a
letter from Bernard Siegel (then
director of the Latin American
Studies Program, where the
Lima program originated) in
which he commented that: "The
present decision to abandon the
program and not merely to take a
year's breather to evaluate it is
really a matter of budgetary con
straints and belt-tightening that
is now pervasive overseas."
There was no mention then
about questions of academic
quality.
On Feb. 14, 1975, the Daily
published a letter from Mark
Mancall (sent at the insistence of
the Director of the Peru program)
correcting errors of fact in the
Jan. 15 story on the Peru program
which had appeared in the
Daily. That letter cited financial
and political instability prob
lems,but no mention was made
of academic quality.
It is interesting that the ques
tion of whether the program had
been abandoned at that time was
fudged in the letter, even though
the decision had already been
made.
On May 12, 1975,1 received a
memo from Don Price, associate
director of overseas studies, in
which he noted, afterattending a
film presentation by one of the
students from the Lima program,
that "I think we can all agree that
the program was a success from
the student viewpoint."
The same memo commented
upon costs of the program, citing
much lower figures than were
provided in the Mancall letter to
the Daily, and noted costs would
have been appreciably less if all
12 students had remained for the
second quarter in Lima (a rule
the director tried to enforce from
inception of the program) or if
there had been a larger enroll
ment.
The enrollment was kept low
because of the pilot nature of the
program and we took our stu
dents from a pool of 50 applic
ants who had to apply on very
short notice. The financial
"problems" hardly sound unre
mediable, if there had been any
desire to properly evaluate the
program with an eye to continu
ation.
There are important questions
to be raised about the advisabil
ity of establishing general edu
cation programs in Third World
Countries, in contrast to the
more specialized program of the

Clifford Barnett

type established in Lima (whefre
students had to be proficient in
Spanish before going and had to
be advanced enough in their
majors to undertake indepen
dent study).
Indeed, the question can be
raised for programs in de
veloped countries whether stu
dents shouldn't be as well pre
pared before going. Rather than
discussing these kinds of con
tent questions, we continue to
get "off-the-cuff" disparaging
comments about the program
Stanford students found reward
ing, as well as unfounded, slan
derous comments about a Third
World university.

anthropology, is/ormer director

published a letter from Mark
Mancall (sent at the insistence of
the Director of the Peru program)
correcting errors of fact in the
Jan. 15 story on the Peru program
which had appeared in the
Daily. That letter cited financial
and political instability prob
lems,but no mention was made
of academic quality.
It is interesting that the ques
tion of whether the program had
been abandoned at that time was
fudged in the letter, even though
the decision had already been
made.
On May 12, 1975,1 received a
memo from Don Price, associate
director of overseas studies, in
which he noted, afterattending a
film presentation by one of the
students from the Lima program,
that "I think we can all agree that
the program was a success from
the student viewpoint."
The same memo commented
upon costs of the program, citing
much lower figures than were
provided in the Mancall letter to
the Daily, and noted costs would
have been appreciably less if all
12 students had remained for the
second quarter in Lima (a rule
the director tried to enforce from
inception of the program) or if
there had been a larger enroll
ment.
The enrollment was kept low
because of the pilot nature of the
program and we took our stu
dents from a pool of 50 applic
ants who had to apply on very
short notice. The financial
"problems" hardly sound unre
mediable, if there had been any
desire to properly evaluate the
program with an eye to continu
ation.
There are important questions
to be raised about the advisabil
ity of establishing general edu
cation programs in Third World
Countries, in contrast to the
more specialized program of the

Clifford Barnett

type established in Lima (whefre
students had to be proficient in
Spanish before going and had to
be advanced enough in their
majors to undertake indepen
dent study).
Indeed, the question can be
raised for programs in de
veloped countries whether stu
dents shouldn't be as well pre
pared before going. Rather than
discussing these kinds of con
tent questions, we continue to
get "off-the-cuff" disparaging
comments about the program
Stanford students found reward
ing, as well as unfounded, slan
derous comments about a Third
World university.
(Clifford Barnett, a professor of
anthropology, is/ormer director
of the Stanford-in Lima prog
ram.)
It is very irritating to read once
again the idle, irresponsible and
unfounded statement that the
Overseas Studies Office "was
forced to discontinue the Lima,
Peru program in light of serious
questions about its academic
quality and unforeseen financial
problems."
The last time this kind of loose
statement was made through the
Daily (Jan. 15, 1975). all eight of
the students then in Peru sent in
a strong rebuttal (also published
in the Daily). They stated that:
"We strongly argue that the
Stanford-in-Peru Program has
come closest of all the Overseas
Stanford Campuses to fulfilling
the professed philosophy of

"learning from living." Books
and lectures could never have
taught us the reality of a de
veloping country, its political
struggle or the Latin American
culture in general, as has our six
months here."
The decision to discontinue
the program was made by Over
seas Studies before the first pilot
program was half-way com
pleted. No one from Overseas
Studies visited the program, and
no one from the Committee on
Foreign Studies Programs talked
to the Director of the program.

really a matter of budgetary con

is now pervasive overseas."
