# New majors needed
## 
### 
808 Henry

As we start a new quarter,
many people are declaring or
changing majors.
In many instances students
choosing a major have a definite
graduate school in their plans;
they are essentially pre-medical.
pre-law or pre-business. I ha
ven't any precise figures, but I
guess one-half to one-third of all
Stanford graduates attend a pro
fessional graduate school.
Let's admit the truth: for many
students Stanford is only prep
aration for further education that
will make possible their desired
career. Stanford is a "prep
school".
Students' main goal may be
high grades so that the students
can be accepted by the graduate
school of their choice. In too
many instances desire for learn
ing falls victim to desire for ex
cellence in grade point average.
These broad groups of stu
dents need their own majors.
For example, pre-meds gener
ally choose either biology or
human biology. I would guess
that at least BO percent of all
biology majors are pre-meds.
For this reason, people who
merely wish to study biology —
how animals function and are
structured — instead learn cellu
lar biology. They must compete
against students who may care
little for "real" biology and are
more concerned for "Stanford"
biology and the letter evaluation
of their exam-taking abilities.
The non-pre-med biology stu
dent must learn his trade at
either Hopkins Marine Station,
which always receives high
grades from students but is
nonetheless threatened with ex
tinction by a constantly di
minishing budget, or a program
like the chipmunk studies in the
Sierra.
The same situation exists for
pre-law and pre-business stu
dents; they may choose a par
ticular field because it is the best
alternative, nqt because it offers
what they need.
Pre-professional students
should be given curricula sepa
rate from students majoring in
subjects simply to learn those
subjects.
I am not attacking career
minded students. It just seems
obvious oil students will benefit
if pre-professional majors are es
tablished.
