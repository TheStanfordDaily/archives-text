ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP)
— Ugandan President Idi Amin,
giving the only floating inter
views at the African summit on
Angola, swam in a hotel pool
yesterday and discussed world
politics and his sex life.
For the second straight day,
the Organization of African
Unity chairman emerged in gold
and black striped pajamas and
plunged into the outdoor,
hotsprings pool at the Hilton
Hotel, where he is staying for the
summit.
Fifty newsmen held cameras
and microphones out over the
water while Amin dived,
backstroked and chatted with
other swimmers.
Amin, a Moslem, said lit; was
48 years old and had 25 children
by his five wives. The exact
number of his offspring had
never been officially reported.
"I am very good at it,"he ob
served, after announcing how
many children he had.
"You are very good at what?"
another swimmer asked.
"I am very good at that," Amin
replied, chuckling.
Relaxed and enjoying the at
tention, Amin swam for 20 mi
nutes.

Most African leaders dodge
reporters who might ask difficult
questions. Amin leaves a trail of
newsmen wherever he goes.
On politics, Amin repeated
that he was pleased by the pre
sent U.S. policy on Angola, in
cluding U.S. assertions that
Washington will not intervene
in Angola's internal affairs.
"Right now I do not have any
evidence of U.S. involvement or
prisoners of war. That credit
goes to President Ford," he said.
He said the United States
should give more aid to develop
ing countries, as the Soviet
I 'nion and other Eastern nations
have.
Politics is like boxing, said
Amin, Uganda's former heavy
weight champion — you try to
knock out your opponents.
He gave a few swimming tips
to newsmen. You breathe in
when your face is above water
and breathe out under water,
Amin said.
