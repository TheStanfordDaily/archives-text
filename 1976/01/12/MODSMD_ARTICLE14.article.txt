## Cards drop Pac-8 openers 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Maples' time: 9:36 p.m.—The
crowd, silent most of Friday
night, has suddenly come to life.
The Dollies' red patent leather
boots are kicking high into the
air to the Red Vest Band's in
spired rendition of "All Right
Now." The fans are honoring
Stanford with its second stand
ing ovation of the night. It's well
deserved.
The Cards, silent most of the
night, have scored 10 straight
points to close to within two
points of Washington State, at
58-56 with 4:54 left in the game.
Maples' time : 9:45 p.m. —The
hum of the fluorescent lights is
the loudest thing in the almost
empty arena. Stanford has lost
its Pacific Eight opener 62-60. as
Washington State wins its first
game in Maples since 1969.

It was that kind of weekend for
the Cards. One minute they
played as if they hadn't seen
each other since last January and
the next minute they were put
ting on a UCLA-like run. Unfor
tunately. they performed like
they were holding a family reun
ion for 25 crucial minutes (the
first half of the Washington State
game and the first five of the sec
ond half of the Washington
game) and lost to the Cougars.
62-60, and fifth-ranked (by Un
ited Press International)
Washington, 87-81.
Even the anticipated matchup
of the Giovacchini brothers —
the first time brothers had
played against one another since
1960 in the old Pacific Coast
Conference — didn't pan out.
Stanford's Paul got intothegame
for about a minute but he quickly

left after turning the ball over to
his brother.
Couldn't crack zone
Stanford, meanwhile, didn't
get a chance to crack
Washington State's 2-3 zone.
The Cards shot a sub-par 40 per
cent (12 of 30) during the first
half. Coach Dick Dißiaso's
have-sub-will-travel service was
working overtime during the
period. Dißiaso inserted guards
Mike Simons and Wolfe Perry
into the contest and Perry re
sponded by hitting his first shot.
But WSU, led by forward Ron
Davis' 13 first half points, had a
10-point lead (38-28) as the first
half ended.
A different Stanford team
came out in the second half. Di-
Biaso left Simons in at guard and
the 6-foot-2 senior scored six
points in a row to start the come
back.
The Cougars inserted senior
forward Norton Barnhill. who
hurt Stanford last year, into the
game and he responded by scor
ing six points to keep the
Cougars up by 12 points midway
through the period.
It did little good as Stanford
closed to within two at 60-58
with 3:18 left in the game. Di-
Biaso had called a timeout mid
way through the period to tell
his players to hold the Cougars
to eight points the rest of the
game. "We felt if we could hold
them to eight points and get to6o
at the same time, we'd win."
Stanford got 60 points but
didn't quite hold the Cougars to
Dißiaso's goal. Still, the Cards
had two chances to win it. cour
tesy of WSU.
Dißiaso knew from his scout
ing report that Ron Davis, WSU's
leading scorer with 21 points,
was only a 54 percent free throw
shooter.
Four seconds remained as

Davis went to the line. He missed
his first free throw. Now the
timeout which the Cards had
used midway through the period
came into question, as Stanford
found themselves without one.
Perry took a 30-footer which
grazed the backboard as time ran
out.
'Big surprise'
"Anybody that thinks they're
going to win easily against Stan
ford is in for a big surprise." said
Raveling.
Washington, Stanford's op
ponent Saturday night, should
have listened to Raveling's
words.
Dißiaso started Perry for the
first time against the Huskies,
and the freshman guard re
sponded with four straight jum
pers.
Good as press clippings
But Washington's seven-foot
center. lames Edwards, looked
every bit as good as his press
clippings. He seemed to score at
will with lavins or 15-foot jum
pers and was so smooth you
would think he was a guard.
Stanford shot .652 from the
floor during the half, but Perry
was even better, hitting five of
six from the floor, to keep the
7020 fans on their feet. When the
half ended, Stanford held a
33-26 lead over the Huskies and
the fans were giving the Cards a
standing ovation.
Dißiaso kept Stanford in the
locker room for what seemed
like an eternity at halftime. He
should have kept them there.
Washington scored nine
straight points before Dißiaso
could say Notre Dame and the
Huskies had a 35-33 lead. Perry
hit an 18-footer to tie the score at
35 all, but that was it.
Washington scored 61 points
during the second half, shooting
.704 from the floor.
