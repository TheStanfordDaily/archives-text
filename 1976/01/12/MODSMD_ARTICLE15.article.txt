# Women cagers split two games
## 
### JEFF WAHBA 
The women's basketball team
made up for a disastrous season
opening loss to San Jose State,
68-49, Friday night by trouncing
Hayward State, 69-51, Saturday
night.
Both games preceded the
men's basketball games and
were the first games ever for the
ladies inside Maples Pavillion.
Maybe this accounts for the
sloppy play exhibited both
nights. Used to playing in front
of crowds of no larger than 50,
the women had close to 700
spectators by the end of both
evenings.
Though the women's and
men's basketball programs have
merged, the ladies showed Fri
day night that they still have a

long way to go to become a major
college powerhouse. San Jose
State, which lost to the Stanford
women 76-52 last year, took the
lead early in the game and was
never threatened.
"This being our first time in
the arena and playing with a lot
of freshmen we just had the jit
ters," coach Gay Coburn com
mented. "Also 1 think San Jose
played up to their potential."
The Spartans shot over 50 per
cent from the floor whereas Stan
ford could manage only 19 for 67
for a .283 percentage.
Stanford, with a tall front line
averaging 5-feet 11, controlled
the boards but sacrificed speed
to the quick Spartans, which be-
came more evident in the second
half as the Cards became tired.
Among the bright spots in the
Reds' attack was center Maggie
Nelson's 19 points as she hit
nine of 12 from the line.
If the game had been close, the
fans might have gone after the
refs as the two ladies were re
peatedly missing obvious calls
such as center line three-second
violations. Even without the
refs' help though. Stanford was
no match for San Jose State.
The Hay ward State game was
a different story. The return of
forward Sukie Jackson, last
year's high scorer who sat out
the Spartan game because of a
bad knee, seemed to give the
Cards new life.
lackson and Nelson both
poured in 13 first-half points to
put the Cards ahead at the half,
43-25. Of the six Stanford scorers •
in the half, only one shot below '
50 percent.
Midway through the second
half Stanford rolled up a 60-30
lead and tnen Coburn emptied
her bench for the remainder of
the game. But Stanford's second
half success resulted mainly
from Hay ward's ineptness. Dur
ing one stretch. Hayward went
one-for-18 from the floor as its
gunners were shotputting the
ball from at least 20 feet out on
almost every occasion. Even so,
Hayward was able to outscore
Stanford 21-9 in the last quarter
of play.
Jackson, who played less than
30 minutes, had 20 points
against Hayward. Maybe she
was all Stanford lacked Friday
night.

ters," coach Gay Coburn com
mented. "Also 1 think San Jose
played up to their potential."
The Spartans shot over 50 per
cent from the floor whereas Stan
ford could manage only 19 for 67
for a .283 percentage.
Stanford, with a tall front line
averaging 5-feet 11, controlled
the boards but sacrificed speed
to the quick Spartans, which be-
came more evident in the second
half as the Cards became tired.
Among the bright spots in the
Reds' attack was center Maggie
Nelson's 19 points as she hit
nine of 12 from the line.
If the game had been close, the
fans might have gone after the
refs as the two ladies were re
peatedly missing obvious calls
such as center line three-second
violations. Even without the
refs' help though. Stanford was
no match for San Jose State.
The Hay ward State game was
a different story. The return of
forward Sukie Jackson, last
year's high scorer who sat out
the Spartan game because of a
bad knee, seemed to give the
Cards new life.
lackson and Nelson both
poured in 13 first-half points to
put the Cards ahead at the half,
43-25. Of the six Stanford scorers •
in the half, only one shot below '
50 percent.
Midway through the second
half Stanford rolled up a 60-30
lead and tnen Coburn emptied
her bench for the remainder of
the game. But Stanford's second
half success resulted mainly
from Hay ward's ineptness. Dur
ing one stretch. Hayward went
one-for-18 from the floor as its
gunners were shotputting the
ball from at least 20 feet out on
almost every occasion. Even so,
Hayward was able to outscore
Stanford 21-9 in the last quarter
of play.
Jackson, who played less than
30 minutes, had 20 points
against Hayward. Maybe she
was all Stanford lacked Friday
night.
The women's basketball team
made up for a disastrous season
opening loss to San Jose State,
68-49, Friday night by trouncing
Hayward State, 69-51, Saturday
night.
Both games preceded the
men's basketball games and
were the first games ever for the
ladies inside Maples Pavillion.
Maybe this accounts for the
sloppy play exhibited both
nights. Used to playing in front
of crowds of no larger than 50,
the women had close to 700
spectators by the end of both
evenings.
Though the women's and
men's basketball programs have
merged, the ladies showed Fri
day night that they still have a

long way to go to become a major
college powerhouse. San Jose
State, which lost to the Stanford
women 76-52 last year, took the
lead early in the game and was
never threatened.
