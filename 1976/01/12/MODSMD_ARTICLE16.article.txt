# Pac-8 roundup
## UCLA loses already 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
The 1976 Pacific-Eight bas
ketball season opened last week
with a few big surprises. The
biggest was Oregon State's 75-58
upset rout of third-ranked UCLA
Saturday. The Bruins never re
ally got untracked as the Beavers
led all the way.
Oregon State held a 33-20
halftime margin and then scored
12 straight points early in the
second half to put a dent into any
UCLA comeback hopes.
Center Lonnie Shelton paced
the Corvallis squad with 20
points, IB of those coming in the
second half. Richard
Washington of UCLA led all
scorers with 21 points.
Biggest win
Beaver coach Ralph Miller
called the win "the best in my
coaching career." The confer
ence loss was only the Bruins'
eighth in the last ten years.
Oregon State won its Pac-8
opener Thursday as J.C. transfer
Rocky Smith collected 29 points
in an 80-70 upset over 18tli
ra nked use.
Oregon gained a split in its
games against the Los Angeles
schools, defeating USC 77-72
and narrowly losing to UCLA
02-61.
Oregon trailed only once in
the USC contest. Creg Ballard
was high for the Ducks with 22
points while Trojan Marv Saf
ford took game honors with 30.
Against the Bruins, the Ducks

trailed 57-47 with six minutes
remaining in the game. Oregon
closed the gap to one as UCLA
failed to convert several key
one-and-one situations. The
Ducks got the ball after a Bruin
turnover, but Greg Ballard
missed a 10-foot jumper with
seven seconds left.
After another UCLA one
and-one failure, Oregon threw
up a desperation shot from mid
court which hit the glass,
bounced off the rim and dropped
harmlessly to the floor at the
buzzer.
In the Hay Area, California lost
to Washington 76-56 and to
Washington State 75-69.
Dogs cold
In the Husky contest, the Bears
jumped out to an early 16-6 lead
as Washington hit only one of its
first fifteen attempts from the
floor. The eighth-ranked Seattle
squad warmed up and it was
Cal's turn to get cold. With 13:32
left in the game the Bears trailed
44-42, but then went scoreless
for five minutes and were with
out a field goal for seven mi
nutes.
"We couldn't buy a basket,"
lamented Cal coach Dick Ed
wards. Ths Huskies were paced
by Lars Hansen with 19 points
while Carl Bird pumped in 24
points for the Bears.
The surprising Washington
State Cougars held off a late
California rally to get the win
Saturday. The victory gave

Washington St. two conference
wins for the weekend, one more
than they had all last season.
