Having competed in the

nament in Berkeley over the
weekend, the Cardinal wrestlers

they will wrestle four times in
three days.
Coach Joe DeMeo expects to
have sophomores Laurence Mor
ton, a 134-pounder. and Mark
Yancey, a 142-pounder, wrestl
ing after the pair missed this
weekend's competition with ill
ness and injuries.
Craig Reynolds, a four-year
veteran who injured his knee
Thursday against UCLA, is also
expected to be ready for the trip
north where the team will meet
the University of Oregon. Ore
gon State, Southern Oregon and

Gymnasts finish last
Despite Bobby Farb's fine in
dividual performance — first
place in the parallel bars, third
place in the horizontal bar and
the leading point gainer (51.70)
all-around — Stanford's initial
gymnastics meet of the 1976 sea
son saw the Cards finish fourth
in a four-way meet.
Host USC won the meet with
200.40 points. The Trojans were
followed by Cal State Fullerton,
198.85; Cal State Northridge,
186.70; and Stanford. 178.65.
Coach Sadao Hamada said
about Farb's performance: "He
can get much better. He must
begin training harder and more
carefully for his try at the Olym
pics."
The best effort of the day may
not have belonged to Farb, but to
Stanford's Ted Marcy, a two
time NCAA side horse champ
ion. Marcy, whose score of 9.5
was the highest recorded for an
individual event at the meet,
successfully completed a new,
full-twisting dismount.
