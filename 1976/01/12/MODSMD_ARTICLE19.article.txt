# Swimmers too much for Texas
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
Stanford's men's varsity
swimming team won its second
dual meet of the season in as
many outings as the Cardinals
rustled down a surprisingly easy
Texas Longhorn squad, 78-33,
Saturday.
Stanford spotted the Long
horns the 50-yard free early in
the meet as Cards Dave Fairbank
and Scott O'Connor were dis
qualified due to false starts and
Texas captured first place in
front of Stanford's Jon Powell.
This was to be one of few firsts
the Longhorns were to capture
all day as the Cardinals took first
place in 10 out of 13 events.
"They were not as good as I
thought they would be," said
coach Jim Caughran. "They had
a few of their swimmers out due
to illness and this weakened
their team."
The Longhorns' weakness did
not stop some of Stanford's
members from improving their
times in anticipation of the
NCAA trials in a few months.
Lifetime best
Freestyler Rill Chao's second
place time of 4:40.6 in the 500-
yard free was the Palo Alto
sophomore's lifetime best. Chao
a-lso finished second in the
1000-yard free at 9:43.8. Stan
ford Ail-American John

Hencken shaved a second off his
last outing in the 200-yard breast
with a first-place time of 2:06.2,
five seconds ahead of teammate
Stu Corliss. Hencken also im
proved with a 1:56.1 in the 200
individual medley.
Freshman sensation Jim Be
lardi took first place in the 200
fly at 1:57.8. In the event Caug
hran was most concerned about,
backstroker Matt Sullivan won
the 200 back in 2:00.1, with Cliff
Lowell coming in third at 2:01.2.
Although below the qualify
ing marks for the NCAAs, Stan
ford took both the 400 medley
and the 400 free relays in 3:29.8
and 3:09.5, respectively.
The diving results deviated
little from what happened all
day as Stanford took both first
and second places in the meter
and three-meter boards. Cardi
nal Steve Powell captured first
place in the meter board in frOnt
of teammate Wayne Wayer,
while Wayer retaliated with a
first place in the three-meter
ahead of Powell.
International win
The Cardinals' weekend was
not to end with that big victory,
however, as Stanford met the
Canadian National team Sun
day. A tired Stanford squad de
feated an opposing team which
supposedly comprises most of

the Canadian Olympic team,
56-41.
The Cardinals were behind
14-11 until the 50 free, one of
two events Stanford was to
sweep that day.
Fairbank won the event
with a time of 21.0, in front of
teammates Bruce Goodwin and
Corliss. The Cardinals also
swept the 100 back with Craig
VanZandt checking in with a
winning time of 47.4 ahead of
Goodwin and Powell.
Hencken continued his fine
performance as he once again
took first in the 200 IM and 200

breast with times of 1:57.0 and
2:07.0. respectively. Chao dupli
cated his lifetime best of a day
before in the 500 free with a
4:40.6, second place behind
Canadian Michael Kerr, whose
winning time of 4:34.9 set a new
Canadian record in the event.
"It was just a run-of-the-mill
performance for us against the
Canadians. We were tired after
the meet against Texas and it
showed in our times," said
Gaughran. "We will just rest up
and prepare for the Stanford Re
lays and Long Beach State next
weekend."
