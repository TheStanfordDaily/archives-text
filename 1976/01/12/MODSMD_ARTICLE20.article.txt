Beirut fighting 'in full blast 1
BEIRUT. Lebanon (AP) — About 5000 Palesti
nian guerrillas launched a majorattack yesterday to
reach suburban refugee camps blockaded by Christ
ian militiamen. A police spokesmen said the Chris
tians "are holding fast with covert support" from
government armored cars.
As fighting raged into the night, the spokesman
placed the day's casualty toll at 60 killed and 78
wounded.
Beirut's hotel war"is in full blast again," he said,
and fighting was reported in northern, eastern and
southern Lebanon and in the mountainous Chouf
district behind Beirut. Lebanon's nine-month-old
civil war has claimed nearly 8,000 lives.
The war is over Moslem demands for political
and economic reforms and Christian resistance to
them until the government clamps down in the
Palestinian guerrillas.
Sunday's main action centered around Palesti
nian guerrilla efforts to break through Christian
lines that have been blockading two refugee camps
for six days. The guerrillas made their main assault
following night-long mortar and rocket barrages
against Christian neighborhoods ringing the re
fugee camps.
Trudeau attacked on interviews
OTTAWA, Canada (AP) —Prime Minister Pierre
Elliott Trudeau is under fire from business, labor
and political leaders because ot a series of year-end
interviews in which lu; maintained the free-market
system in Canada had failed and massive govern
ment intervention in the economy is necessary.
But supporters in his Liberal party respond by
saying that rather than writing off the free enter
prise system, the prime minister has launched a
process that will eventually bring it back to good
health.
Businessmen charge that Trudeau had become a
Napoleon. Labor union leaders say he is making
himself an omnipresent big brother. Former Prime
Minister John Diefenbaker, a member of the Con
servative party, called Trudeau a little Caesar.
The prime minister has been away on a skiing
vacation in British Columbia as the controversy

flared but is expected to reply to the attacks when
he returns this week to Ottawa.
