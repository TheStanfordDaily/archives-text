The Commencement Speaker Selection
Committee lias sent an invitation to its first
choice, according to committee member Marie
Fiatarone.
Fiatarone, a senior class president, said yes
terday two letters were mailed last week.
In addition, "we expect (President Richard)
Lyman will soon call the selected person to offer
â–  l personal invitation, if he hasn't done so al
ready," she said.
Sticking to committee policy, Fiatrone re
fused to release the invited person's name. "It
we released the name, we might not be able to
get a good speaker, the speaker we want," she
said.
Undue pressure might cause the committee's
first choice to decline, she said. Fiatrarone also
argued that if the committee should have to in
vite its fourth choice, that person might not ac
cept where he is on the priority list.
