# Lyman supports selectivity
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Although academic selectivity has
caused Stanford to to termed an elite
university, this selectivity is desirable,
President Richard Lyman told the
Academic Council Friday.
Lyman spoke at the council's winter
quarter meeting. Only about 20 mem
bers were present.
He defended the emphasis on
academic ability in student admis
sions, saying there are many "first
class scholars on the faculty," and dec
laring it would be a "waste of human
capital to attract to work with this fa
culty any but the ablest learners — i.e.,
students."
However, Lyman cautioned that
there is a difference between academic
brilliance and wisdom.
The skills "developed here are not
by themselves going to save the world;
all that we can sayis that without these
kinds of intellectual capacities the
world will not be saved," he said.
Admissions process
Earlier in his talk, Lyman explained
what difficulties he saw in the admis
sions process. Many potentially ad
missible applicants never achieve be
cause of "inequities in society," he
stated.
He also said that the three bases for
admission — grades, standardized test
scores and recommendations — have
all become controversial.
Grade inflation has made transcripts
less reliable, he asserted, and the trend
towards making recommendations
"freely available to the persons about
whom they were written seems per
fectly designed to administer the coup
de grace to them."
Standardized tests
The resulting emphasis on standar
dized tests tests is ironic, Lyman as
serted. He said that these tests "cannot
ever possibly provide a full, rounded
picture," but "what they purport to
measure they measure well."
He concluded by posing the ques
tion of whether students at Stanford
"can develop themselves further here
than at any other university."
Being able to ask this question seri
ously. Lyman said, indicated Stan
ford's opportunity and duty.
Low attendance
Following the speech, several coun
cil members noted the low attendance
and inquired whether it was worth
continuing council meetings.
"My colleagues seem to have voted
with their feet," History Prof. Peter
Stansky said.
Lyman responded by saying that the
Faculty Senate Steering Committee
had advised to continue the quarterly
meetings. He also noted that such
meetings were constitutionally re
quired.
However, Lyman suggested that in
future meetings he "talk informally
from a few notes" rather than prepar
ing d speech.
Buckley Amendment
He also said that the University was
"asking Congressional friends of ours
to consider holding hearings" on the
Buckley Amendment which guaran
tees students access to records kept
about them.
Later he explained that, although
ambiguities in the amendment have
created problems for the University, as
yet it has made no specific suggestions
for remedial amendments.
