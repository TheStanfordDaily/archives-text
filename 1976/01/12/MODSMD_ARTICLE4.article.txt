### RICK FEARON 
David Fine, 23, a member of the
FBl's "Ten Most Wanted" list, was
arrested Wednesday at the home of
David Cudhea. asst. director of com
munications for the General Secret
ary's office. Fine had rented a room
from the Cudheas.
Fine faces federal charges of sabot
age, destruction of government prop
erty and conspiracy, as well as a Wis
consin State charge of first degree
murder. He and three other co
conspirators are alleged to have par

ticipated in setting off an explosion
five years ago outside the University of
Wisconsin's mathematics center on
the Madison campus.
The explosion killed one researcher
and caused $3 million in damage.
Fine, who had been living under the
name William J. Lewes, rented the
Cudhea's $150-a-month room last fall
in answer to a notice Joanne Cudhea
posted at the Co-op market in Corte
Madera. The Cudheas live in San
Rafael.
The Cudheas are not under investi

gation, according to the FBI.
David Cudhea said he was surprised
Fine turned out to be a wanted fugi
tive. because he seemed like a "nice
enough guy."
Cudhea described Fine as a good
tenant, who liked listening to rock
music, owned a cat and "had a lot of
plans." Cudhea said Find was also an
avid sports fan. often Watching foot
ball games on television.
"We talked a lot of sports and things
of that nature." said Cudhea.
"It is very unsettling when some
body who seems like a nice enough
guy and a good tenant is arrested for
something like that." he said.
Fine had apparently been in the San
Rafael area for about six months. He is
reported to have told agents he had
been working in a warehouse in the
area.
Fine said he had worked in Los
Angeles before he moved to San
Rafael, according to Cudhea.
"I'm not sure he worked at anything
steadily when he came up here," said
Cudhea. Fine mentioned he was "pick
ing up casual jobs," said Cudhea.
According to the registrar at the Col
lege of Marin, Fine attended classes
during fall semester, but failed to
complete his courses.
Anonymous tip
The FBI first learned of Fine's possi
ble whereabouts from an anonymous
phone call to its San Francisco office
about six weeks ago, according to
Frank Perroni, special agent and
spokesman for the San Francisco office
of the FBI.
"We (the FBI) conducted an im
mediate investigation, as well as inter
views." said Perroni. Based on a de
scription of Fine, the FBI observed and
then arrested the fugitive, said Perroni.
Fine had several sets of false iden
tification, according to federal offi
cials. Because the FBI did not have
Fine's fingerprints, his identity was

determined from his dental charts
Fine was arraigned on the federal
charges Friday before U.S. Magistratf
Richard Coldsmith.
$1 million bail
Fine admitted his identity to
Goldsmith and was then ordered to be
removed to Wisconsin. He is being
held on $1 million bail.
At the time of the bomb blast. Fine
was a reporter and night editor for the
Wisconsin Daily Cardinal campus
paper. He had previously been an or
ganizer for Students for a Deniocrati<
Society (SDS) in Delaware.
The bomb blast occurred Sept 4,
1970. A stolen truck filled with explo
sives was detonated outside the six
story Sterling Hall mathematics build
ing at about 4:00 a.m.. a few minutes
after an anonymous phone call in
formed police of the blast. (
Researcher killed
Killed in the explosion was Robert
Fassnacht, a father of three, who was
working late to finish a project before
an upcoming vacation
Sterling Hall was a tarHetfor radicals
because some of its research was being
performed under contract with the
Army.
And according to the San Francisco
Chronicle, at Fine's court hearing pro
secutor F. Steele Langford said, "We
have reason to presume he was a
member of the Weather Under
ground."
The three others implicated in the
bombing are Karleton Armstrong. 27.
his brother Dwight, 34, and Leo Burt,
27. Karleton Armstrong was arrested
in Canada in 1972 and later sentenced
to a minimum of ten years in prison
after pleading guilty.
Dwight Anderson.and Burt are still
at large. However, several FBI agents
last week were going door-to-door in
the area around the Cudheas' home to
see if anyone recognized photographs
of the two remaining fugitives.
