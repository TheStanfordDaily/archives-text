# Controversy finally ends
## Willow Road will widen 
### GREG LARSON 
The Palo Alto City Council finally approved Dec. 15 the
controversial widening and extension of Willow Road
along the north side of the Stanford Shopping Center.
The project, when completed, will tie together Sand
Hill Road and El Camino Real. Currently, traffic must
travel through the Stanford Shopping Center parking lot.
The expansion of Willow Road will improve access to
the Medical Center, the Stanford Shopping Center and the
Oak Creek Apartments.
The expansion should also alleviate some of the traffic
problems expected in the near future in Stanford's central
campus and in downtown Palo Alto,,proponents of the
project report.
The main area of controversy in the past has been over
how many trees and how many parking spaces should be
destroyed for the new section of the road. The enlarge
ment of the already existing road to four lanes from the
shopping center to Sand Hill has been generally agreed
upon.
7-1 vote
The adopted route, approved 7-1 with one abstention,
will be located almost entirely in a grove of trees between
San Francisquito Creek and the shopping center's parking
lot. Councilman Byron Sher, also a Stanford law professor,
did not vote due to a possible conflict of interest.
The project, expected to begin by 1977, will use up a
minimal number of parking spaces, according to Ben Paw
loski, Palo Alto director of public works. Pawloski also
said, "As of now there are no total cost figures, nor esti
mates as to the number of trees to be taken out."

The project's cost has previously been estimated at $6.7
million and will involve removing 33 trees. The final
figures will vary due to inflation and minor changes in the
route's location.
Councilman Kirke Comstock, the sole dissenter, felt the
project was "excessive" in that it will "take a lot of right
of-way and a lot of money." He commented, "We don't
need four lanes, and we don't need them in the trees."
Comstock is also concerned that the greater volume of
traffic will cause more noise and be a hindrance to resi
dents of the area, particularly those in the apartments.
Proper planning
"With proper planning, decent landscaping, and some
replanting of trees, the project should be of benefit to most
concerned people," said Bruce Wolfe, president of the
Stanford Conservation Group. He continued, "Like the
Bonfire, the issue is partly Symbolic; to show Stanford's
responsibility to the environment."
The Stanford Consevation Group is not planning any
challenges to the council's decision, though they hope to
become active in the planning process, particularly in the
landscaping.
The expansion of Willow Road will most directly affect
the merchants of the Stanford Shopping Center, who are
in favor of the project as long as parking spaces are not
used for the road.
Michael Hrynczak, spokesman for the Merchant's As
sociation, said. "The only thing . . . (the tree grove) ... is
being used for anyway is letting dogs run free and for
employes to park their cars in the trees' shade during the
summer."

nearby areas. The project will begin in 1977 and cost an
estimated $6.7 million.
