# Senate chairman fights parking permits in court

### ANN POLLOCK 
University parking regulations are
unfair, according to ASSU Senate
Chairman William Hoke who is fight
ing the University's enforcement of
section 21113 of the California Vehicle
Code in court.
Section 21113 authorizes univer
sities and other institutions to estab
lish parking regulations on their prop
erty.
On Oct. 24. Hoke was issued a park
ing ticket under that section for failing
to have a "resident student" parking
sticker on his car while it was parked
in the space designated for his apart
ment in Escondido Village.
"My case basically says that Sec.
21113 is not intended to be used at
Stanford as the University uses it.and
if so, it's utterly unconstitutional,"
Hoke said.
According to Hoke, outside police
authority should be used on campus
under Sec. 21113 only in cases regard
ing public health and safety. In cases
like his, normal tenant-landlord laws
should be used, Hoke said
"The legislature gave the University

the power to protect public health and
safety. Parking in front of my apart
ment hasabsolutely nothing todo with
public health and safety," Hoke said.
Hoke's case has been under consid
eration for a month. Should the judge
rule in his favor, it would mean a de
facto limiting of the University's
power under Sec. 21113, according to
Hoke.
The use of police power granted to
Stanford under Sec 21113 should be
clearly explained, according to Hoke
"Stanford can only use police sup
port afforded from Sec. 21113 up to h
certain limit," Hoke said. "Even
though the statue is vague, the intent is
clear. If Stanford takes the statue for all
its worth, it has to be unconstitu
tional."
"My case against Stanford's parking
plan is not simply because it's unfair,
but also because of how the administ
ration has tried to defend it," Hoke
said. "It's also a personal protest."
