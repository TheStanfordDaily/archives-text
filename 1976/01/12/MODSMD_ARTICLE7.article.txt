# Helmet laws
## 
### 
My son died on Christmas day,
1975, as the direct result of se
vere head injuries sustained in a
motor cycle accident.
His death might have been
prevented if he had been wear
ing a helmet. He was comatose
fifteen weeks prior to his death.
This letter is a response to the
Jan. 7 Daily column of Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Cal.). Nothing
can be done for my son; how
ever, 1 hope my remarks will
provide some facts about an ac
tual situation rather than the
political opinions that were ex
pressed in his statement.
Consider these four points:
—The lives of six people, plus
myself and my wife, were di
rectly effected by Steven's acci
dent and death.
—The cost of Steven's first
week at El Camino Hospital ex
ceeded $:1800. We estimate the
cost at Kaiser Hospital in Red
wood City was approximately
$.15,000.
—I would like to remind him
of the direct financial burden
and the continuing emotional
stress caused to my wife and me
by his death.
— I cannot begin to calculate
the human resources (medical
personnel, employers and
friends) that became concen
trated on Steven's situation.
Steven was a qualified motor
cycle mechanic, lie travelled
from Cupertino to Washington,
13.C. to Miami and back on his
bike.
He worked at a motorcycle
shop that required him to wear
headgear if he wanted to keep
his job. However, when he chose
not to wear his helmet because
he was encouraged by people
like Cranston it became a very
expensive option.
Lvxcept for the; second to last
paragraph. Cranston's argument
was replete with value judge
ments. Has he tried to find out
the number of those in a vegata
tive condition, the cost to the pa
rents and insurance carriers or
how many people have been af
fected because of serious motor
cycle accidents?

I could tell him about the pain
and fear I have seen in the eyes of
parents who know it is not a mat
ter of "if my child will have an
accident on a motorcycle, but
when."
Cranston is correct in saying
helmets do not prevent acci
dents.
Helmets can, however, have
an effect on the results of an ac
cident. Helmets do not affect
traffic hazards or vehicle defects,
but they can bean asset in case of
an error on the part of the cyclist.
Steven's death was apparently
due to his own error.
Finally, I have not encoun
tered any of Cranston's con
stituents who understood his
line or argument.
Stanford students will also
note several big brother remarks
in Cranston's statements:
Federal intervention is jus
tified if government decides in
dividual initiatives by state and
local governments are "fruitless
or self-defeating."
Some Stanford students will
be selected at random to "un
dergo additional licensing."
It is only because of federal
funds California's accident rate
is below the national average. It
has nothing to do with personal
intelligence and competence.
No one can argue that "cer
tified" helmets have shortcom
ings. However, Cranston prop
oses nothing to rectify this situa
tion.
He reveals an ambivalence in
his opinions when he declares
helmets "may or may not protect
the wearer."
My wife and I don't conclude
Cranston is more concerned
with the loss of $50 million of
federal funds and the blemish on
his record, rather than "govern
ment intrusion in personal con
duct."
The public safety, the public
pocketbook and the use of vital
human resources is enhanced by
the wearing of helmets. Steven
was wrong and so is Cranston.
