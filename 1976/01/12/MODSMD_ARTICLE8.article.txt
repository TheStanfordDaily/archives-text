ERA dangerous
Editor:
Robert Montemayer's Dec. 6
Daily column on the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) calls
for rebuttal.
The California Commission on
the Status of Women informs us
(contrary to Montemayer's allu
sion) that marriage and the fam
ily would undergo "substantial
change as a direct result of re
quirements to bring . . .laws into
conformance'with the ERA. The
effect upon the institution of the
family is significant, involving
not only law but human reac
tions."
With sex discrimination in
hiring, promotion, pay, credit
and education already as illegal
as it would be under ERA, the
family remains the one area
where the amendment would
have significant direct impact.
Eventually some organization
would bring up a test case to
prove that a housewife (or
househusband) is depriving the
wage-earning spouse of his (or
her) equal right to support.
With a number of people in
high places declaring parents do
more harm than good to their
children, government taking in
creasing control of our lives, and
government child-care facilities
proliferating, it is neither "hys
terical." "non-rational" nor
"blasphemous" to attempt to
avoid the strong possibility that
courts would rule against what
in totalitarian countries is

labeled "a parasitic way of life."
Such a ruling would place a
legal stigma on all dependent
spouses. Only a short step would
then remain to a total-control
child-care state. And the ERA
would provide the legal
framework for such a state.
Our rights and responsibilities
as parents constitute the last
means of preserving individual
liberty, as opposed to state
supremacy, for future genera
tions. Are we so foolish — or so
unconcerned — as to leave our
selves wide open to takeover qf
such rights and responsibilities
by the state?

USE picketing
i
Editor:
1 hope all members of the Uni
versity community noted care
fully the opinion of Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance
Robert Augsberger and Univer
sity Staff Counsel for Employe
Relations Doug Barton which
appeared in the Jan. 9 Daily in
connection with the lay-off of
USE's assistant President, that a
gathering of Stanford workers
with placards on sticks is illegal
and constitutes a violation of the
USE contract.
Although 1 wouldn't presume
to argue a legal matter with such
an accomplished lawyer as Bar
ton, 1 can't believe any signific
ant proportion of the members of
this great liberal university

community would really want to
deny me and my fellow workers
the right to occasionally carry a
sign expressing our opinion.
I would also hope the com
munity wouldn't tolerate such
repressive ideas in its officials
and would let Augsberger and
Barton know it is uncool to try to
deny Stanford workers basic free
speech rights.
Although the USE contract
specifically outlaws picketing
by workers, which might be in
terpreted to include the mere act
of carrying a sign, it doesn't take
a Stanford education to know
Americans have constitutional
guarantees of freedom of expres
sion which take precedence over
a union contract. Therefore the
only proper interpretation of the
anti-picketing provision is with
reference to picket lines in
tended to impede or obstruct
normal functioning of the Uni
versity, an action which USE has
scrupulously avoided.

Computer users worried about
unauthorized use of confidential
data should know that it is fairly
easy to encode their own data,
independently of any security
system offered by a computer.
Various published procedures
will transform a keyword or key
sentence into a psuedo-random
sequence which can be used to
scramble data. Some of these

methods cannot be broken by
any known mathematical
analysis (in the non-classified
literature at least), even if an in
truder has copies of al 1 programs
and samples of coded and de
coded messages.
However, security always en
tails costs especially when a user
loses his keyword or mis-types it
while the data is being encoded.
There is no substitute for exam
ing the obsession of secrecy and
deciding which secrets are really
necessary.

Editor:
1 hope all members of the Uni
versity community noted care
fully the opinion of Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance
Robert Augsberger and Univer
sity Staff Counsel for Employe
Relations Doug Barton which
appeared in the Jan. 9 Daily in
connection with the lay-off of
USE's assistant President, that a
gathering of Stanford workers
with placards on sticks is illegal
and constitutes a violation of the
USE contract.
Although 1 wouldn't presume
to argue a legal matter with such
an accomplished lawyer as Bar
ton, 1 can't believe any signific
ant proportion of the members of
this great liberal university

community would really want to
deny me and my fellow workers
the right to occasionally carry a
sign expressing our opinion.
I would also hope the com
munity wouldn't tolerate such
repressive ideas in its officials
and would let Augsberger and
Barton know it is uncool to try to
deny Stanford workers basic free
speech rights.
Although the USE contract
specifically outlaws picketing
by workers, which might be in
terpreted to include the mere act
of carrying a sign, it doesn't take
a Stanford education to know
Americans have constitutional
guarantees of freedom of expres
sion which take precedence over
a union contract. Therefore the
only proper interpretation of the
anti-picketing provision is with
reference to picket lines in
tended to impede or obstruct
normal functioning of the Uni
versity, an action which USE has
scrupulously avoided.

Computer users worried about
unauthorized use of confidential
data should know that it is fairly
easy to encode their own data,
independently of any security
system offered by a computer.
Various published procedures
will transform a keyword or key
sentence into a psuedo-random
sequence which can be used to
scramble data. Some of these

methods cannot be broken by
any known mathematical
analysis (in the non-classified
literature at least), even if an in
truder has copies of al 1 programs
and samples of coded and de
coded messages.
However, security always en
tails costs especially when a user
loses his keyword or mis-types it
while the data is being encoded.
There is no substitute for exam
ing the obsession of secrecy and
deciding which secrets are really
necessary.

ERA dangerous
Editor:
Robert Montemayer's Dec. 6
Daily column on the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) calls
for rebuttal.
The California Commission on
the Status of Women informs us
(contrary to Montemayer's allu
sion) that marriage and the fam
ily would undergo "substantial
change as a direct result of re
quirements to bring . . .laws into
conformance'with the ERA. The
effect upon the institution of the
family is significant, involving
not only law but human reac
tions."
With sex discrimination in
hiring, promotion, pay, credit
and education already as illegal
as it would be under ERA, the
family remains the one area
where the amendment would
have significant direct impact.
Eventually some organization
would bring up a test case to
prove that a housewife (or
househusband) is depriving the
wage-earning spouse of his (or
her) equal right to support.
With a number of people in
high places declaring parents do
more harm than good to their
children, government taking in
creasing control of our lives, and
government child-care facilities
proliferating, it is neither "hys
terical." "non-rational" nor
"blasphemous" to attempt to
avoid the strong possibility that
courts would rule against what
in totalitarian countries is

labeled "a parasitic way of life."
Such a ruling would place a
legal stigma on all dependent
spouses. Only a short step would
then remain to a total-control
child-care state. And the ERA
would provide the legal
framework for such a state.

Computer users worried about
unauthorized use of confidential
data should know that it is fairly
easy to encode their own data,
independently of any security
system offered by a computer.
Various published procedures
will transform a keyword or key
sentence into a psuedo-random
sequence which can be used to
scramble data. Some of these

methods cannot be broken by
any known mathematical
analysis (in the non-classified
literature at least), even if an in
truder has copies of al 1 programs
and samples of coded and de
coded messages.
However, security always en
tails costs especially when a user
loses his keyword or mis-types it
while the data is being encoded.
There is no substitute for exam
ing the obsession of secrecy and
deciding which secrets are really
necessary.

However, there are three stu

William Henrich, Richard

As an ex-officio member of the

ERA dangerous
Editor:
Robert Montemayer's Dec. 6
Daily column on the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) calls
for rebuttal.
The California Commission on
the Status of Women informs us
(contrary to Montemayer's allu
sion) that marriage and the fam
ily would undergo "substantial
change as a direct result of re
quirements to bring . . .laws into
conformance'with the ERA. The
effect upon the institution of the
family is significant, involving
not only law but human reac
tions."
With sex discrimination in
hiring, promotion, pay, credit
and education already as illegal
as it would be under ERA, the
family remains the one area
where the amendment would
have significant direct impact.
Eventually some organization
would bring up a test case to
prove that a housewife (or
househusband) is depriving the
wage-earning spouse of his (or
her) equal right to support.
With a number of people in
high places declaring parents do
more harm than good to their
children, government taking in
creasing control of our lives, and
government child-care facilities
proliferating, it is neither "hys
terical." "non-rational" nor
"blasphemous" to attempt to
avoid the strong possibility that
courts would rule against what
in totalitarian countries is

labeled "a parasitic way of life."
Such a ruling would place a
legal stigma on all dependent
spouses. Only a short step would
then remain to a total-control
child-care state. And the ERA
would provide the legal
framework for such a state.
Our rights and responsibilities
as parents constitute the last
means of preserving individual
liberty, as opposed to state
supremacy, for future genera
tions. Are we so foolish — or so
unconcerned — as to leave our
selves wide open to takeover qf
such rights and responsibilities
by the state?

USE picketing
i
Editor:
1 hope all members of the Uni
versity community noted care
fully the opinion of Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance
Robert Augsberger and Univer
sity Staff Counsel for Employe
Relations Doug Barton which
appeared in the Jan. 9 Daily in
connection with the lay-off of
USE's assistant President, that a
gathering of Stanford workers
with placards on sticks is illegal
and constitutes a violation of the
USE contract.
Although 1 wouldn't presume
to argue a legal matter with such
an accomplished lawyer as Bar
ton, 1 can't believe any signific
ant proportion of the members of
this great liberal university

community would really want to
deny me and my fellow workers
the right to occasionally carry a
sign expressing our opinion.
I would also hope the com
munity wouldn't tolerate such
repressive ideas in its officials
and would let Augsberger and
Barton know it is uncool to try to
deny Stanford workers basic free
speech rights.
Although the USE contract
specifically outlaws picketing
by workers, which might be in
terpreted to include the mere act
of carrying a sign, it doesn't take
a Stanford education to know
Americans have constitutional
guarantees of freedom of expres
sion which take precedence over
a union contract. Therefore the
only proper interpretation of the
anti-picketing provision is with
reference to picket lines in
tended to impede or obstruct
normal functioning of the Uni
versity, an action which USE has
scrupulously avoided.
