UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (AP) —
The Palestine Liberation Organization
called Israel a "Zionist, racist state" at
last night's opening round of a con
troversial U.N. Security Council de
bate on the Middle East.
PLO spokesman Farouk Kaddoumi
said his organization would continue
its military and political struggle to
establish a Palestinian state. He called
on the council to adopt "an effective
resolution" offering Palestinians "a
path to return to their homeland."
Several hours earlier the council
overrode U.S. objections and voted
11-1 to invite the PLO to participate in
the debate with the same rights as U.N.
members.
U.S. Ambassador Daniel Moynihan
voted against, while Britain, France
and Italy abstained in the 15-member
council.
Veto-proof
The matter was procedural and not
subject to the veto power held by
America and the council's four other
permanent members — the Soviet Un
ion, China, Britain and France.
Kaddoumi charged that the United
States is a "sustainer of the continued
aggression and expansion of Israel."
Israel's decision to boycott the debate
because of the PLO presence, he said,
was an effort "to frustrate the will of
this council."
In an obvious reference to a recent
Ceneral Assembly resolution equating
Zionism with racism, Kaddoumi said:
"Our struggle is not against the jews
in Palestine but against the Zionist
movement... its expansionist prac
tices and its aggressive intentions
which have led ... to the exile of our
people.
'Rejection'
"We have also declared our categor
ical rejection of any alternative home
land. Our people have one homeland,
Palestine, and we struggle for its resto
ration."
Zionism is the movement that led
the struggle for establihment of the
Jewish state in Palestime.
Moynihan said Kaddoumi's "adam
ant speech . . . doesn't seem to recog
nize the existence of Israel."
After the Libyan ambassador spoke
in support of the PLO the council ad
jorned until noon today, PST.
Egyptian Ambassador A. Esmat
Abdel Meguid told newsmen Egypt,
the PLO, Syria, Jordan and Libya have
formed a committee to prepare a resol
ution to submit to the council.
Pipe bombs found
Yesterday morning three pipe
bombs were found in a subway tunnel
beneath the U.N. Library building and
were defused by New York police ex
perts. They were set to go off at 3 p.m.
— shortly before the Security Council
convened.
A U.N. security officer said, "there
were enough explosives in there to
knock down half the library."
About five hours after the discovery,
a man telephoned the Associated Press
and said the Jewish Armed Resistance
Strike Movement claimed responsibil
ity for placing the bombs.
Council President Salim Salim of
Tanzania madethe motion inviting the
PLO to join in thedebate, and Moyni
han then demanded a vote on the is
sue.
