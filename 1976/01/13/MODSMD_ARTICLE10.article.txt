# Student opinion ignored once again
## 
### 
Recent indications of growing student
participation in the decision-making pro
cess here may have been illusory.
The partially-successful struggle of the
senior class officers and the Council of Pres
idents to persuade the administration to
allow seniors to choose their own com
mencement speaker this year seemed to
augur a growth in administrative and ASSU
concern for student opinion.
But the lessons of last year's unpopular
selection of Daniel Patrick Moynihan as
commencement speaker appear to have had
no influence on the ASSU Guest Professor
ship Board.
Just as the administration and four senior
class officers last year chose Moynihan to
speak at commencement even though they
made no effort to consult seniors on the
matter, so the Guest Professorship Board re
cently bypassed student opinion in inviting
35 persons to teach here next spring.
Likewise, just as the selection of Moyni
han, the advocate of "benign neglect" to
ward blacks offended many students and
professors who believe that blacks need
continued federal help in order to achieve
equality of opportunity, so the choice of
many of the 35 potential guest professors is
likely to offend many students.
Obviously, no list of commencement
speakers or guest professors will satisfy
everyone. But as last year's controversy
about Moynihan proved, some choices are
more offensive than others.
The senior officers and the administra
tion last year had no idea how strongly
many persons objected to the selection of
Moynihan, since they consulted no one out
side of their own narrow circle.
It is highly possible that some of the Guest
Professorship Board's choices might be
equally odious to many students.
Consequently, it is indeed strange that the
Board made no effort to emulate this year's

senior class officers' ambitious attempts to
gauge student opinion on the selection of a
commencement speaker.
In addition to conducting a senior class
poll, the senior class officers, through the
campus media, encouraged students to
come and give them informal suggestions for
choosing a commencement speaker. In con
trast, the Guest Profssorship Board made no
apparent attempt to help decide who would
receive invitations.

Although the Board might argue that it
will consult students about which person to
hire when —and if — more than one accepts
an invitation, such a public discussion
would come too late, for two reasons.
First, the choice of candidates might be
extremely narrow, leaving no person who
enjoyed broad student support — or lacked
no deep opposition among some students.
Second, if strong hostility developed to
ward one candidate it would be a gross dis
courtesy to that person to have students re
ject his'candidacy after he had accepted an
invitation to lecture here.
The "Board's blithe disregard for student
opinion is especially disturbing consider
ing the highly controversial nature of one of
the persons invited — Richard Nixon.
Many of us would vehemently object to
allowing Nixon to serve here as a guest pro
fessor. If Nixon had merely been invited

here as a speaker, I would have no objec
tions, since the purpose of the ASSIJ
Speaker's Bureau is to expose students to
individuals of widely differing reputations
and opinions.
But to invite Nixon as a professor is to
bestow upon him a high honor he does not
deserve.
Recent reports from San Clemente indi
cate Nixon is anxious to emerge from re
tirement. An appointment to a visiting pro
fessorship here would give him the sort of
renewed respectability that might enable
him to re-enter public life,'possibly as an
envoy to the People's Republic of China.
While Nixon clearly has the experience
and expertise that would enable him to give
considerable service to the nation, assump
tion by him of a public role would indicate
Americans had forgiven him for his mis
deeds and grown less concerned about the
need for high morality in high offices. This
must not occur.
Two years ago, students here voted to es
tablish an ASSU guest professorship after
having been told the person chosen to teach
probably would be a political prisoner from
Vietnam or Chile.
If students had known the position even
tually would be offered to Nixon, the results
of the referendum might have been very dif
ferent. The Guest Professorship Board
should not have made such a drastic change
in the type of candidate invited to serve
without having consulted the students.
Student opinion so often has been bypas
sed by the makers of decision here that
perhaps one ought to grow accustomed to
such disregard. But in the aftermath of the
Moynihan controversy, some of us had
hoped changes were imminent. Apparently
we were mistaken.

idents to persuade the administration to
allow seniors to choose their own com
mencement speaker this year seemed to
augur a growth in administrative and ASSU
concern for student opinion.
But the lessons of last year's unpopular
selection of Daniel Patrick Moynihan as
commencement speaker appear to have had
no influence on the ASSU Guest Professor
ship Board.
Just as the administration and four senior
class officers last year chose Moynihan to
speak at commencement even though they
made no effort to consult seniors on the
matter, so the Guest Professorship Board re
cently bypassed student opinion in inviting
35 persons to teach here next spring.
Likewise, just as the selection of Moyni
han, the advocate of "benign neglect" to
ward blacks offended many students and
professors who believe that blacks need
continued federal help in order to achieve
equality of opportunity, so the choice of
many of the 35 potential guest professors is
likely to offend many students.
Obviously, no list of commencement
speakers or guest professors will satisfy
everyone. But as last year's controversy
about Moynihan proved, some choices are
more offensive than others.
The senior officers and the administra
tion last year had no idea how strongly
many persons objected to the selection of
Moynihan, since they consulted no one out
side of their own narrow circle.
It is highly possible that some of the Guest
Professorship Board's choices might be
equally odious to many students.
Consequently, it is indeed strange that the
Board made no effort to emulate this year's

senior class officers' ambitious attempts to
gauge student opinion on the selection of a
commencement speaker.
In addition to conducting a senior class
poll, the senior class officers, through the
campus media, encouraged students to
come and give them informal suggestions for
choosing a commencement speaker. In con
trast, the Guest Profssorship Board made no
apparent attempt to help decide who would
receive invitations.

Although the Board might argue that it
will consult students about which person to
hire when —and if — more than one accepts
an invitation, such a public discussion
would come too late, for two reasons.
First, the choice of candidates might be
extremely narrow, leaving no person who
enjoyed broad student support — or lacked
no deep opposition among some students.
Second, if strong hostility developed to
ward one candidate it would be a gross dis
courtesy to that person to have students re
ject his'candidacy after he had accepted an
invitation to lecture here.
The "Board's blithe disregard for student
opinion is especially disturbing consider
ing the highly controversial nature of one of
the persons invited — Richard Nixon.
Many of us would vehemently object to
allowing Nixon to serve here as a guest pro
fessor. If Nixon had merely been invited

here as a speaker, I would have no objec
tions, since the purpose of the ASSIJ
Speaker's Bureau is to expose students to
individuals of widely differing reputations
and opinions.
But to invite Nixon as a professor is to
bestow upon him a high honor he does not
deserve.
Recent reports from San Clemente indi
cate Nixon is anxious to emerge from re
tirement. An appointment to a visiting pro
fessorship here would give him the sort of
renewed respectability that might enable
him to re-enter public life,'possibly as an
envoy to the People's Republic of China.
While Nixon clearly has the experience
and expertise that would enable him to give
considerable service to the nation, assump
tion by him of a public role would indicate
Americans had forgiven him for his mis
deeds and grown less concerned about the
need for high morality in high offices. This
must not occur.
Two years ago, students here voted to es
tablish an ASSU guest professorship after
having been told the person chosen to teach
probably would be a political prisoner from
Vietnam or Chile.
If students had known the position even
tually would be offered to Nixon, the results
of the referendum might have been very dif
ferent. The Guest Professorship Board
should not have made such a drastic change
in the type of candidate invited to serve
without having consulted the students.
Student opinion so often has been bypas
sed by the makers of decision here that
perhaps one ought to grow accustomed to
such disregard. But in the aftermath of the
Moynihan controversy, some of us had
hoped changes were imminent. Apparently
we were mistaken.
