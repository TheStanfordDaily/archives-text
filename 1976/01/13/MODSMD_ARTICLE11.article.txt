# SALT agreements disadvantageous
## Jerry Lampton 
### 
Most Americans today firmly
believe that the Strategic Arms
Limitations Talk (SALT) agree
ments of 1972 and 1974 give the
United States and the Soviet
Union a firm foundation upon
which to build a lasting world
peace.
Unfortunately, reality does
not entirely justify this attitude.
If the LJnited States does not take
a tougher stand in the SALT
negotiations, the Soviet Union
will gain nuclear superiority
within the next 10 to 15 years
and will use that advantage to
further its foreign policy goals.
It is often argued the United
States does not need nuclear par
ity with the Soviet Union be
cause any nuclear war would be
so devastating that neither side
would even consider using its
nuclear weapons.
This argument may be comfort
ing to Americans, but the Rus
sians do not consider nuclear
war that unthinkable. In addi
tion to engaging in an active
weapons program, they are
spending a billion dollars a year
on civil devense.
Four percent
The latest Soviet Civil Defense
handbook estimates that if its
procedures are followed, no
more than four percent of its
population would die. even in a
direct United States attack on its
cities. Considering the losses the
Russians suffered in World War
11, they probably do not consider
this too high a price to pay.
America's nuclear holocaust
myth presumes that because the
Soviets consider the risk of nuc
lear war unacceptable, the
Soviets have changed their at
titude toward the West into a
new "spirit of detente."
In fact, any Soviet change in

• '?.v.
attitude is probably more cosine
tic than real. Soviet writrftS are
telling their own people thfet
communism must triumph aaid
that detente means
thing as peaceful
"Peaceful coexistencei&BNhei
Russians means what
war" means to American®. The
Soviets hopetolull the Westinto
a false sense of security.
Such goals, many claim, are of
no danger to the United SUtjpfet.
because the Soviets are very con
servative and do not try to do
more than they feel thew««ww
realistically accomplish. While
it is true the Soviet leadership is
cautious, it must be remembered
that the USSR pronounces as its
official goal the subordination of
the world to communism.
The Soviet leaders are ex
tremely patient and willing to
take small steps to achieve their
goal.
In fact, it is this Soviet conser
vatism which prompts the
Soviets to strive for a permanent
strategic arms agreement that
will be advantageous to them.
Because the Soviets are so un
willing to take risks, they have
bargained hard for a favorable
SALT agreement with the U.S.
while committing 15 percent of
their GNP to military spending.
The result of Soviet intransi
gence at the negotiating table is a
SALT I agreement which gives
the Soviet Union a 40 percent
advantage over the United States
in the number of missile laun
chers the Soviet Union is per
mitted to keep, and double the
average size of Soviet missies
over American missiles.
Doesn't remedy
The Vladovostok Agreement
of 1974 does nothing to remedy
tM!i"MM*ilance. This means that

even if Congress funds Trident
and the B-l bomber to comple
tion the Soviet Union can MIRV
its missiles to gain a three-to-one
advantage in missile throw
weight over the United States.
.This nuclear superiority will
make the Soviets more adven
turesome and less willing to
back down in future gambles.
The Soviets have already taken
serious gambles in Vietnam and
in, the Middle East.
They helped the North Viet
namese to violate the peace ag
reements there, and they gave
Egypt and Syria the arms those
nations needed to attack Israel in
the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In the
spirit of detente, the Soviets
threatened to intervene in the
war when it appeared that their
side was losing.
Soviet support of the Popular
Movement for the Liberation of
Angola (MPLA) is the latest
example of new Soviet adven-

turism.
These Soviet initiatives can
only prove disadvantageous for
the United States. As the Soviets
gain ascendancy over the United
States by means of the SALT ag
reements, they will become bol
der.
If the United States does not
insist on a truly equitable ag
reement in the SALT 111 talks, it
will pay the price in more
foreign policy reversals.
It is clear that the Soviet Union
is seeking nuclear superiority
over the United States and that it
will be able to do so legally
under the SALT agreements un
less the United States stiffens its
stand.
The spirit of detente will last
only in an environment of parity
between the United States and
the USSR. America should not
allow the Soviet Union to lull it
into a state of nuclear inferiority.

even if Congress funds Trident

make the Soviets more adven

The Soviets have already taken

Egypt and Syria the arms those

will gain nuclear superiority

Most Americans today firmly
believe that the Strategic Arms
Limitations Talk (SALT) agree
ments of 1972 and 1974 give the
United States and the Soviet
Union a firm foundation upon
which to build a lasting world
peace.
Unfortunately, reality does
not entirely justify this attitude.
If the LJnited States does not take
a tougher stand in the SALT
negotiations, the Soviet Union
will gain nuclear superiority
within the next 10 to 15 years
and will use that advantage to
further its foreign policy goals.
It is often argued the United
States does not need nuclear par
ity with the Soviet Union be
cause any nuclear war would be
so devastating that neither side
would even consider using its
nuclear weapons.
This argument may be comfort
ing to Americans, but the Rus
sians do not consider nuclear
war that unthinkable. In addi
tion to engaging in an active
weapons program, they are
spending a billion dollars a year
on civil devense.
Four percent
The latest Soviet Civil Defense
handbook estimates that if its
procedures are followed, no
more than four percent of its
population would die. even in a
direct United States attack on its
cities. Considering the losses the
Russians suffered in World War
11, they probably do not consider
this too high a price to pay.
America's nuclear holocaust
myth presumes that because the
Soviets consider the risk of nuc
lear war unacceptable, the
Soviets have changed their at
titude toward the West into a
new "spirit of detente."
In fact, any Soviet change in

• '?.v.
attitude is probably more cosine
tic than real. Soviet writrftS are
telling their own people thfet
communism must triumph aaid
that detente means
thing as peaceful
"Peaceful coexistencei&BNhei
Russians means what
war" means to American®. The
Soviets hopetolull the Westinto
a false sense of security.
Such goals, many claim, are of
no danger to the United SUtjpfet.
because the Soviets are very con
servative and do not try to do
more than they feel thew««ww
realistically accomplish. While
it is true the Soviet leadership is
cautious, it must be remembered
that the USSR pronounces as its
official goal the subordination of
the world to communism.
The Soviet leaders are ex
tremely patient and willing to
take small steps to achieve their
goal.
In fact, it is this Soviet conser
vatism which prompts the
Soviets to strive for a permanent
strategic arms agreement that
will be advantageous to them.
Because the Soviets are so un
willing to take risks, they have
bargained hard for a favorable
SALT agreement with the U.S.
while committing 15 percent of
their GNP to military spending.
The result of Soviet intransi
gence at the negotiating table is a
SALT I agreement which gives
the Soviet Union a 40 percent
advantage over the United States
in the number of missile laun
chers the Soviet Union is per
mitted to keep, and double the
average size of Soviet missies
over American missiles.
Doesn't remedy
The Vladovostok Agreement
of 1974 does nothing to remedy
tM!i"MM*ilance. This means that

even if Congress funds Trident
and the B-l bomber to comple
tion the Soviet Union can MIRV
its missiles to gain a three-to-one
advantage in missile throw
weight over the United States.
.This nuclear superiority will
make the Soviets more adven
turesome and less willing to
back down in future gambles.
The Soviets have already taken
serious gambles in Vietnam and
in, the Middle East.
They helped the North Viet
namese to violate the peace ag
reements there, and they gave
Egypt and Syria the arms those
nations needed to attack Israel in
the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In the
spirit of detente, the Soviets
threatened to intervene in the
war when it appeared that their
side was losing.
Soviet support of the Popular
Movement for the Liberation of
Angola (MPLA) is the latest
example of new Soviet adven-

turism.
These Soviet initiatives can
only prove disadvantageous for
the United States. As the Soviets
gain ascendancy over the United
States by means of the SALT ag
reements, they will become bol
