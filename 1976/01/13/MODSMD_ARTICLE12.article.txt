# Moonies present danger
## Amanda Susskind 
### 
Recently, I was invited to a
ranch run by followers of the
Christian, anti-communist Re
verend Sun Myung Moon.
These followers are among
500,000 followers of Moon, in
over 40 countries — 10,000 in
the United States alone. They
earn $7 to $8 million a year sel
ling flowers and crafts.
Their "ranch" turned out to be
the 700-acre Eden Awareness
Training Center, formerly a part
of Moon's International Reedu
cation Foundation (which is
now called the Creative Com
munity Center). Moon also owns
a former Hearst mansion.
As for religion and politics,
Moon considers their separation
"Satanic." He would like to seea
Christian political paty founded.
Since 1936, when a vision told
him he was the second Messiah,
Moon has developed a theology
which he terms the Divine Prin
ciple, combining Christianity,
Oriental religions and anti
communism. He also believes
the United States should be ac
tive in foreign aid projects.
We should be especially help
ful to South Korea, which, being
Moon's birthplace, is the New
Holy Land, he says.
The ranch at Boonville is af
filiated with the Unification
Church, founded by Moon on the
basis of his Divine Principle. It
condemns anyone not in the or
ganization. including members'
families. The ranch has affected
many individuals who think
they are just getting a weekend
away from school or jobs when
they sign up for a weekend at
Boonville. The Eden Awareness
Training Center has been recog
nized to use brainwashing
techniques.
Never let alone or given time
for reflection, newcomers (cal
led "spiritual children") are
programmed into a daily routine
of aggressive games, singing, a
starchy-low-protein diet, as little
as four hours a night of sleep,
and lectures followed by pro
gressively more heated
discussions. It is unclear
whether the political and religi
ous ties are ever brought out, but
new members are often con
vinced to drop out of school or
quit jobs in order to dedicate
their lives to peddling and re
cruiting.
I can't decide which is more
frightening, whether these fol
lowers (called "Moonies") are
unaware of their cause and are
not passing on religious and
political opinions because they
do not even know they have any,
or if they are aware of their
cause, leader and philosophies,
but are withholding information
purposefully.
The newcomer is enticed
under false pretenses into a
cause he may find difficult to
leave. One should be aware, if
and when the Moonies return to
the Stanford campus, that they
are not telling the whole
truth, and sometimes are telling
anything but the truth.

These followers are among
500,000 followers of Moon, in
over 40 countries — 10,000 in
the United States alone. They
earn $7 to $8 million a year sel
ling flowers and crafts.
Their "ranch" turned out to be
the 700-acre Eden Awareness
Training Center, formerly a part
of Moon's International Reedu
cation Foundation (which is
now called the Creative Com
munity Center). Moon also owns
a former Hearst mansion.
As for religion and politics,
Moon considers their separation
"Satanic." He would like to seea
Christian political paty founded.
Since 1936, when a vision told
him he was the second Messiah,
Moon has developed a theology
which he terms the Divine Prin
ciple, combining Christianity,
Oriental religions and anti
communism. He also believes
the United States should be ac
tive in foreign aid projects.
We should be especially help
ful to South Korea, which, being
Moon's birthplace, is the New
Holy Land, he says.
The ranch at Boonville is af
filiated with the Unification
Church, founded by Moon on the
basis of his Divine Principle. It
condemns anyone not in the or
ganization. including members'
families. The ranch has affected
many individuals who think
they are just getting a weekend
away from school or jobs when
they sign up for a weekend at
Boonville. The Eden Awareness
Training Center has been recog
nized to use brainwashing
techniques.
Never let alone or given time
for reflection, newcomers (cal
led "spiritual children") are
programmed into a daily routine
of aggressive games, singing, a
starchy-low-protein diet, as little
as four hours a night of sleep,
and lectures followed by pro
gressively more heated
discussions. It is unclear
whether the political and religi
ous ties are ever brought out, but
new members are often con
vinced to drop out of school or
quit jobs in order to dedicate
their lives to peddling and re
cruiting.
I can't decide which is more
frightening, whether these fol
lowers (called "Moonies") are
unaware of their cause and are
not passing on religious and
political opinions because they
do not even know they have any,
or if they are aware of their
cause, leader and philosophies,
but are withholding information
purposefully.
The newcomer is enticed
under false pretenses into a
cause he may find difficult to
leave. One should be aware, if
and when the Moonies return to
the Stanford campus, that they
are not telling the whole
truth, and sometimes are telling
anything but the truth.

Recently, I was invited to a
ranch run by followers of the
Christian, anti-communist Re
verend Sun Myung Moon.
