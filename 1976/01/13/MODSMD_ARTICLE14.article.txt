Editor:
The ASSU Guest Professor
ship Board has shown grossin
sensitivity to student opinion in
its choice of possible guest pro
fessors.
First, why were students not
consulted about the candidates
under consideration? The
method of choosing guest pro
fessorship candidates bears all
too strongly a similarity to the
method used to choose last
year's graduation speaker.
Secondly, how could the
board consider Richard Nixon
for a guest professor position?

Although not officially a crim
inal, Nijxon hardly deserves the
dignity of teaching at a major
university. Besides, choosing
him as a guest professor would
be a source of great embarrass
ment to Stanford.

I am shocked and disturbed at
the recent statement by Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger to
the effect that the United States
is pursuing an active diplomatic
and covert military policy in

Angola only because of Soviet
involvement in that war-torn
land.
This statement by an Ameri
can spokesman at the highest
level reflects the moral ban
kruptcy of American policy
since Vietnam.
Where will American killing
stop? When will we realize that,
in attempting to create a balance
of terror from Saigon to Luanda,
we are in fact adding to already
barbaric conflicts in every part cf
the world?
