## 'It's hard to sue a cartoonist' Pat Oliphant's pen proves mightier than the sword 
### RIV WEBER 
"If Pat Oliphant couldn't
draw," a critic once said, "he'd
be an assassin."
Indeed, in a time when many
real-life assassins miss their
mark, Oliphant, whose zany,
stinging cartoons have made
him the nation's leading politi
cal cartoonist, wounds politi
cians with stunning accuracy.
But despite drawing loud
howls of pain from outraged vic
tims, as well as the cackles of the
masses, Oliphant remains un
contrite. "It's hard to sue a car
toonist," comments the Pulitzer
Prize winner.
Free to ravage
The 39-year-old Australian
began his career in this country
as a cartoonist for the Denver
Post. Last spring he moved to the
underdog paper in D.C., the
Washington Star-News. De
spite his close proximity to the
nation's top government figures,
Oliphant retains a free rein to
ravage whomever he pleases.
The pompous air of an interna
tionally known artist is missing
in Pat Oliphant. Like any lesser
figure, he suffered the usual
pains in traveling 2000 miles to
the East coast, having to spend
months waiting for his bed to ar
rive from Sears.
"I have to sleep on an air mat
tress," Oliphant was quick to
complain in a recent interview.
"The fucking thing goes down
every night. The only way you
can get to sleep is to get drunk
first, and wake up with a han
gover on the floor feeling like the
victim of a hit and run."
Unconventional
His unconventional manner is
pervasive. As the phone rings,
he picks up the receiver and lis
tens as his secretary handles the
call. "No, he's not in," she exp

lains. With a smirk, Oliphant
waits for the click of the caller's
phone, and then congratulates
his secretary on her sly move.
Oliphant enjoys the art
medium. "You can get in so
many more innuendoes," he
explained. When he moved to
the United States, he proceeded
to change the style of political
cartoons.
"I wanted to inject the British
European style, with an em
phasis on drawing and more use
of humor," he continued.
Oliphant tries, he said, to get his
point across "without hitting
people over the head."
Although Oliphant has been a
pioneer among modern political
cartoonists, he is not altogether
happy with those who have
drawn inspiration from his un
ique style.
'Pissed off
"Pissed off" is how Oliphant
describes his attitude to his
many imitators. He noted that
many elements of his style have
been "ripped off, quite
shamelessly."
But spine features of
Oliphant's cartoons will never
be imitated, especially Punk the
Penguin, who sits on the
sidelines of each drawing mak
ing poignant wisecracks.
Punk was inspired by a real
penguin in Australia, the pet of a
fellow reporter. "The thing
stunk like,hell, and he gave it to
the zoo." Oliphant began draw
ing the penguin in Australia,
and it stuck.
The misanthrope
Oliphant sees himself as
something of a misfit in a capital
where "there is a higher educa
tion level, a higher level of afflu
ence, and 55 percent of the
women work." Oliphant said he
tends to "stay to myself most of

the time," choosing not to
mingle on the infamous D.C.
cocktail circuit.
Insulting everyone from Sol
zhenytsin to Ford, Oliphant
explained "you just can't insult
some people. I used to get re
quests from Agnew for some of
my drawing" — drawing which
was generally derogatory.
LBJ was also a big soliciter of
Oliphant originals. "I used to

send them along," explained the
cartoonist. He stopped giving
away his originals when he
realized how profitable the mar
ket for Oliphant sketches was
becoming.
Outspoken in his dislike for
Solzhenytsin, Oliphant com
plained that "The press worked
so hard to get him sprung from
the USSR and then he wouldn't

have anything to do with them.
He was above all that."
Oliphant has often been a
winner of the cartoonists' "prize
of the week" — reprints in Time
and Newsweek. As Oliphant's
editor at the Star Jim Bellows
said, "When Oliphant hits a sub
ject, it's damaged, whereas a
routine cartoonist Wouldn't have
much effect."

many elements of his style have
been "ripped off, quite
shamelessly."
But spine features of
Oliphant's cartoons will never
be imitated, especially Punk the
Penguin, who sits on the
sidelines of each drawing mak
ing poignant wisecracks.
Punk was inspired by a real
penguin in Australia, the pet of a
fellow reporter. "The thing
stunk like,hell, and he gave it to
the zoo." Oliphant began draw
ing the penguin in Australia,
and it stuck.
The misanthrope
Oliphant sees himself as
something of a misfit in a capital
where "there is a higher educa
tion level, a higher level of afflu
ence, and 55 percent of the
women work." Oliphant said he
tends to "stay to myself most of

the time," choosing not to
mingle on the infamous D.C.
cocktail circuit.
Insulting everyone from Sol
zhenytsin to Ford, Oliphant
explained "you just can't insult
some people. I used to get re
quests from Agnew for some of
my drawing" — drawing which
was generally derogatory.
LBJ was also a big soliciter of
Oliphant originals. "I used to

send them along," explained the
cartoonist. He stopped giving
away his originals when he
realized how profitable the mar
ket for Oliphant sketches was
becoming.
Outspoken in his dislike for
Solzhenytsin, Oliphant com
plained that "The press worked
so hard to get him sprung from
the USSR and then he wouldn't

have anything to do with them.
He was above all that."
Oliphant has often been a
winner of the cartoonists' "prize
of the week" — reprints in Time
and Newsweek. As Oliphant's
editor at the Star Jim Bellows
said, "When Oliphant hits a sub
ject, it's damaged, whereas a
routine cartoonist Wouldn't have
much effect."

"If Pat Oliphant couldn't
draw," a critic once said, "he'd
be an assassin."
Indeed, in a time when many
real-life assassins miss their
mark, Oliphant, whose zany,
stinging cartoons have made
him the nation's leading politi
cal cartoonist, wounds politi
cians with stunning accuracy.
But despite drawing loud
howls of pain from outraged vic
tims, as well as the cackles of the
masses, Oliphant remains un
contrite. "It's hard to sue a car
toonist," comments the Pulitzer
Prize winner.
Free to ravage
The 39-year-old Australian
began his career in this country
as a cartoonist for the Denver
Post. Last spring he moved to the
underdog paper in D.C., the
Washington Star-News. De
spite his close proximity to the
nation's top government figures,
Oliphant retains a free rein to
ravage whomever he pleases.
The pompous air of an interna
tionally known artist is missing
in Pat Oliphant. Like any lesser
figure, he suffered the usual
pains in traveling 2000 miles to
the East coast, having to spend
months waiting for his bed to ar
rive from Sears.
"I have to sleep on an air mat
tress," Oliphant was quick to
complain in a recent interview.
"The fucking thing goes down
every night. The only way you
can get to sleep is to get drunk
first, and wake up with a han
gover on the floor feeling like the
victim of a hit and run."
Unconventional
His unconventional manner is
pervasive. As the phone rings,
he picks up the receiver and lis
tens as his secretary handles the
call. "No, he's not in," she exp

lains. With a smirk, Oliphant
waits for the click of the caller's
phone, and then congratulates
his secretary on her sly move.
Oliphant enjoys the art
medium. "You can get in so
many more innuendoes," he
explained. When he moved to
the United States, he proceeded
to change the style of political
cartoons.
"I wanted to inject the British
European style, with an em
phasis on drawing and more use
of humor," he continued.
Oliphant tries, he said, to get his
point across "without hitting
people over the head."
Although Oliphant has been a
pioneer among modern political
cartoonists, he is not altogether
happy with those who have
drawn inspiration from his un
ique style.

describes his attitude to his

Prize winner.
Free to ravage
The 39-year-old Australian
began his career in this country
as a cartoonist for the Denver
Post. Last spring he moved to the
underdog paper in D.C., the
Washington Star-News. De
spite his close proximity to the
nation's top government figures,
Oliphant retains a free rein to
ravage whomever he pleases.
The pompous air of an interna
tionally known artist is missing
in Pat Oliphant. Like any lesser
figure, he suffered the usual
pains in traveling 2000 miles to
the East coast, having to spend
months waiting for his bed to ar
rive from Sears.
"I have to sleep on an air mat
tress," Oliphant was quick to
complain in a recent interview.
"The fucking thing goes down
every night. The only way you
can get to sleep is to get drunk
first, and wake up with a han
gover on the floor feeling like the
victim of a hit and run."
Unconventional
His unconventional manner is
pervasive. As the phone rings,
he picks up the receiver and lis
tens as his secretary handles the
call. "No, he's not in," she exp

lains. With a smirk, Oliphant
waits for the click of the caller's
phone, and then congratulates
his secretary on her sly move.
Oliphant enjoys the art
medium. "You can get in so
many more innuendoes," he
explained. When he moved to
the United States, he proceeded
to change the style of political
cartoons.
"I wanted to inject the British
European style, with an em
phasis on drawing and more use
of humor," he continued.
Oliphant tries, he said, to get his
point across "without hitting
people over the head."
Although Oliphant has been a
pioneer among modern political
cartoonists, he is not altogether
happy with those who have
drawn inspiration from his un
ique style.
'Pissed off
"Pissed off" is how Oliphant
describes his attitude to his
many imitators. He noted that
many elements of his style have
been "ripped off, quite
shamelessly."
But spine features of
Oliphant's cartoons will never
be imitated, especially Punk the
Penguin, who sits on the
sidelines of each drawing mak
ing poignant wisecracks.
Punk was inspired by a real
penguin in Australia, the pet of a
fellow reporter. "The thing
stunk like,hell, and he gave it to
the zoo." Oliphant began draw
ing the penguin in Australia,
and it stuck.
The misanthrope
Oliphant sees himself as
something of a misfit in a capital
where "there is a higher educa
tion level, a higher level of afflu
ence, and 55 percent of the
women work." Oliphant said he
tends to "stay to myself most of

the time," choosing not to
mingle on the infamous D.C.
cocktail circuit.
Insulting everyone from Sol
zhenytsin to Ford, Oliphant
explained "you just can't insult
some people. I used to get re
quests from Agnew for some of
my drawing" — drawing which
was generally derogatory.
LBJ was also a big soliciter of
Oliphant originals. "I used to

send them along," explained the
cartoonist. He stopped giving
away his originals when he
realized how profitable the mar
ket for Oliphant sketches was
becoming.
Outspoken in his dislike for
Solzhenytsin, Oliphant com
plained that "The press worked
so hard to get him sprung from
the USSR and then he wouldn't

have anything to do with them.
He was above all that."
Oliphant has often been a
winner of the cartoonists' "prize
of the week" — reprints in Time
and Newsweek. As Oliphant's
editor at the Star Jim Bellows
said, "When Oliphant hits a sub
ject, it's damaged, whereas a
routine cartoonist Wouldn't have
much effect."
