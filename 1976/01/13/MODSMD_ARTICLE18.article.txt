Rodin, I doubt whether I've ever felt a hundred emotions
in an hour before. I can't remember the last time I petted
an artwork like a dog, as if it could lick my hand.
Rodin, I felt religious, seeing heaven's splendor and a
lurid hell on the wise lips of the mannequins. My hands
were trembling. Mouths that could never smile had
curled my lips. Eyes that could never see had seized my
tears.
