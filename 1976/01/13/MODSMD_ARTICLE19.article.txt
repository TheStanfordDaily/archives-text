## Tubes: que lewd! 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The curtain of twisted Tubes parted to reveal
Quay Lewd. He floated to the front of the stage, his
18-inch platform shoes glittering in the spot
lights. "White Punks On Dope," someone
shouted. "No, fuck you," Lewd replied in his
Cockney voice.
But the standing-room-only audience was al
ready getting set for the grand finale to the two
hour extravaganza, "White Punks On Dope,"
which it knew was sure to follow.
The Tubes' act may have changed since their
performances at Bimbo's 365Club and the Board
ing House this past summer, but they're still fam
ous for one song which has become a national
anthem of sorts.
Two standing-room-only audiences jammed
Memorial Auditorium to see everything from
sado-masochism to a Fidel Castro parody. And
from all indications it was a success both artisti
cally and for ASSU Special Events which staged
the shows.
Cramped stage
Opening their act with "What Do You Want
From Life," the group appeared somewhat hurt by
the small Mem Aud stage. A runway had been
extended into the orchestra pit, but it just wasn't
the same as some of their earlier performances.
Lead singer Fay Waybill likes to walk into the
audience during this number, handing out Tubes
records and shaking hands. He had to settle for
throwing the records and was only able to shake a
few hands.
The cramped stage became all too apparent just
two numbers later, when the Tubes did "Space
Baby." In this number Waybill spoke to the audi
ence using the video monitors which are an integ
ral part of the performance. Speaking from

Uranus One, he told everyone that he was drink
ing Tang. In a flash Waybill and two dancers were
onstage dressed in space suits for the number.
But unfortunately they couldn't do the intricate
routine of slow motion falls and turns that the
group usually does during the number.
The Tubes, whose greatest unfulfilled desire is
to play Disneyland, have added something to
their show that would make even Walt Disney
proud. It features "It's Great To Be An American,"
as the American flag flutters on the television
monitors.
Sadist outfit
"Mondo Bondage," that old favorite, during
which Waybill and a female dancer dressed up in
matching leather sadist outfits, complete with
3-inch spike, was a big favorite. The only trouble
was that Waybill didn't walk through the audi
ence hitting people and use a buzzing chainsaw
like he did this summer.
But the skin flicks still flashed on the television
screens just like they did last summer and
"Mondo" was still a hit.
Almost too quickly Quay Lewd was there
on stage and a mountain of glitter was pouring
down. Lewd threw pills to the audience, saving a
few for himself. He washed them down with beer
and soon the group had gone into "Boy Crazy,"
the prelude to "White Punks."
The end came almost too quickly. Soon every
roadie was on stage and even a trapeze artist
swung high above the crowd. The audience had
gotten what it came for, almost too easily. It as
sumed that the group is going to do "White
Punks." And they always do it. But they had an
encore planned. The fact that the lights were
turned on didn't help. But "White Punks" is en
core and show enough.
