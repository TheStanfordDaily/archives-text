# Vacationers swamp Hawaiian flights
## 
### KEVIN OHLSON 
The ASSU charter flight to Hawaii
during spring vacation is sold out. and
the waiting list has already reached
280. Even though the ASSU Charter
Service has not yet been successful in
its efforts to charter a second airplane,
there are other charters to Hawaii av
ailable for students.
ASSU Travel Service Manager Jay
Farr said "It's difficult to find a
Hawaiian charter fitting our time and
price requirements. United Airlines
offered us another plane, but they want
too much —around $210 per person as
compared to the $179 for those already
confirmed with us."
Farr said charter prices have to take
into account the ferry mileage — the
distance to the next place a plane must
travel in order to be used. In the conti
nental U.S. this is usually very small,
but Hawaii is 3000 miles out in the
Pacific.
The currently contracted Western
Airlines jet is not as expensive as the
United jet because it was a regularly
scheduled flight that is now cancelled.
UC Berkeley chartered it first, but then
didn't want it, said Farr.
Airline commitments
"Airlines are reluctant to make
commitments until the last minute for
Hawaiian flights. For example, next
year's continental flights for Christmas
are already secured, yet we're still
negotiating for this spring's charter to
Hawaii. They know they can fill any
time."
Farr would like to charter a 747.
While he would forfeit the $4000 de
posit on the current plane, a 747 would
be $10 cheaper per seat. The total cost
would be about the same as it is now.
For those on the waiting list, there
are other sources available but they're
probably not as convenient.
Other charters
One of the largest tour groups is
Trade Wind Tours (United Air Lines).
They offer seven nights at either the
Reef or Waikiki Surf for $254, based on
double occupancy. It leaves from Los
Angeles on March 27.
Continental Express leaves March
19 (the last day of finals) from Los
Angeles at 8 p.m. The cost is $247.
There is an even cheaper way to fly,

but it also leaves from Los Angeles.
This involves securing a reservation
with Continental Express 63 days in
advance (Jan. 16) of the departure date
(March 19). It costs $169 plus $6 tax.
but there are exceptions.
This flight must be 100 percent sold
for this minimum price. For every per
cent of the plane.not sold, the price
goes up proportionately, to a
maximum of $207.80, or 80 percent of
the flight sold. If less than 80 percent of
the flight is sold, it is cancelled.
Associated with this Continental
Express flight is a seven-night stay at
the Napualani Hotel for $54 (double
occupancy). Theoretically, this Travel
Group Charter <— flight only — could
cost from $229 to $262, depending on
the number of reservations (remember
there are 280 on the waiting list)!
The Travel Service is still making
inquiries to various airlines, among
them Pan Am and Continental. Even
though the ASSU's current plane is
sold out, it should be possible to get to
Hawaii from Los Angeles.

One of the largest tour groups is
Trade Wind Tours (United Air Lines).
They offer seven nights at either the
Reef or Waikiki Surf for $254, based on
double occupancy. It leaves from Los
Angeles on March 27.
Continental Express leaves March
19 (the last day of finals) from Los
Angeles at 8 p.m. The cost is $247.
There is an even cheaper way to fly,

but it also leaves from Los Angeles.
This involves securing a reservation
with Continental Express 63 days in
advance (Jan. 16) of the departure date
(March 19). It costs $169 plus $6 tax.
but there are exceptions.
This flight must be 100 percent sold
for this minimum price. For every per
cent of the plane.not sold, the price
goes up proportionately, to a
maximum of $207.80, or 80 percent of
the flight sold. If less than 80 percent of
the flight is sold, it is cancelled.
Associated with this Continental
Express flight is a seven-night stay at
the Napualani Hotel for $54 (double
occupancy). Theoretically, this Travel
Group Charter <— flight only — could
cost from $229 to $262, depending on
the number of reservations (remember
there are 280 on the waiting list)!
The Travel Service is still making
inquiries to various airlines, among
them Pan Am and Continental. Even
though the ASSU's current plane is
sold out, it should be possible to get to
Hawaii from Los Angeles.

The ASSU charter flight to Hawaii
during spring vacation is sold out. and
the waiting list has already reached
280. Even though the ASSU Charter
Service has not yet been successful in
its efforts to charter a second airplane,
there are other charters to Hawaii av
ailable for students.
ASSU Travel Service Manager Jay
Farr said "It's difficult to find a
Hawaiian charter fitting our time and
price requirements. United Airlines
offered us another plane, but they want
too much —around $210 per person as
compared to the $179 for those already
confirmed with us."
Farr said charter prices have to take
into account the ferry mileage — the
distance to the next place a plane must
travel in order to be used. In the conti
nental U.S. this is usually very small,
but Hawaii is 3000 miles out in the
Pacific.
The currently contracted Western
Airlines jet is not as expensive as the
United jet because it was a regularly
scheduled flight that is now cancelled.
UC Berkeley chartered it first, but then
didn't want it, said Farr.
Airline commitments
"Airlines are reluctant to make
commitments until the last minute for
Hawaiian flights. For example, next
year's continental flights for Christmas
are already secured, yet we're still
negotiating for this spring's charter to
Hawaii. They know they can fill any
time."
Farr would like to charter a 747.
While he would forfeit the $4000 de
posit on the current plane, a 747 would
be $10 cheaper per seat. The total cost
would be about the same as it is now.
For those on the waiting list, there
are other sources available but they're
probably not as convenient.
