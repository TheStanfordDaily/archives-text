# California Landscape Painting: reflection of the broadening interest in American art
## 
### ANGELA MILLER 
California Landscape Paint
ing, 1860-1885, the show cur
rently on exhibit at the Stanford
Art Museum through Feb. 29, is
a significant reflection of the
broadening interest in American
art of the latter half of the 19th
century.
The show demonstrates both
the continuity and the regional
variety and distinction of
American landscape painting as
it developed alongside advanc
ing westward migration..
The Huehson'River antecedent
of the present group of San Fran
cisco painters has received the
deserving but too-exclusive at
tention of students and collec
tors of 19th century American
painting.
Organized by Stanford Art

History Frof. Dwight Miller,
the show provides an opportun
ity for public exhibition of paint
ings taken by and large from pri
vate collections. The exhibition
of paintings is accompanied by a
catalogue presenting biog
raphies of all the artists.
Well-researched
This material was gathered
from research done in the arc
hives of the Oakland museum
and information culled from
contemporary newspaper ac
counts.
The extent of local interest
taken in San Francisco artists at
the time has left a substantial
body of material which has been
brought together in a lucid form
by the catalogue.
In addition, the introductory
essay to the catalogue places the

show in the larger context of na
tional developments, describing
both the relevance of landscape
painting to the national identity
and the more specific local
framework within which the ar
tists worked.
Golden hinterland
The nine artists represented in
the show express what Califor
nia, the golden hinterland of the
American continent, meant to
the artists and writers who first
turned toward the West in the
early 1850s.
During the latter decades of
the 19th century, San Francisco
developed into a frontier center
of culture which provided a set
ting offering both patronage and
the comradeship of other artists.
Such factors produced, in the
period covered by the show, a
definable artistic movement.
As the present showindicates,
San Francisco artists, so often
ignored by an Eastern cultural

prejudice, were in fact men of no
trivial accomplishment.
Frequently trained in the East
or in Europe, they were unified
by a common interest in the vari
ety and grandeur of the Califor
nia landscape and the challenge
of a fresh and untried articula
tion.
Favorite subjects
Among the favorite subjects of
these San Francisco based artists
were Yosemite, Mount Shasta
and Tamalpais.
Subjects such as these were
studied for weeks on end, on
sketching excursions and pre
cisely recorded with plein-ciir
pencil and brush sketches. Care
ful notation was made of ever
changing atmospheric effects, at
different times during the day
and, from season to season,
under a variety of climatic con
ditions.

The interests of these artists,
however, was not limited to the
sublime and the remote; smaller
subjects range in locale from the
more intimate scale of the footh
ills to the flatlands of the Sac
ramento Delta.
The show registers an interest
ing diversity of responses and
techniques, from the small,
fresh and highly colonistic can
vases of Raymond Yelland to the
serene and muted splendour of
Julian Rix.

As the present showindicates,
San Francisco artists, so often
ignored by an Eastern cultural

prejudice, were in fact men of no
trivial accomplishment.
Frequently trained in the East
or in Europe, they were unified
by a common interest in the vari
ety and grandeur of the Califor
nia landscape and the challenge
of a fresh and untried articula
tion.
Favorite subjects
Among the favorite subjects of
these San Francisco based artists
were Yosemite, Mount Shasta
and Tamalpais.
Subjects such as these were
studied for weeks on end, on
sketching excursions and pre
cisely recorded with plein-ciir
pencil and brush sketches. Care
ful notation was made of ever
changing atmospheric effects, at
different times during the day
and, from season to season,
under a variety of climatic con
ditions.

The interests of these artists,
however, was not limited to the
sublime and the remote; smaller
subjects range in locale from the
more intimate scale of the footh
ills to the flatlands of the Sac
ramento Delta.
The show registers an interest
ing diversity of responses and
techniques, from the small,
fresh and highly colonistic can
vases of Raymond Yelland to the
serene and muted splendour of
Julian Rix.
California Landscape Paint
ing, 1860-1885, the show cur
rently on exhibit at the Stanford
Art Museum through Feb. 29, is
a significant reflection of the
broadening interest in American
art of the latter half of the 19th
century.
The show demonstrates both
the continuity and the regional
variety and distinction of
American landscape painting as
it developed alongside advanc
ing westward migration..
The Huehson'River antecedent
of the present group of San Fran
cisco painters has received the
deserving but too-exclusive at
tention of students and collec
tors of 19th century American
painting.
Organized by Stanford Art

History Frof. Dwight Miller,
the show provides an opportun
ity for public exhibition of paint
ings taken by and large from pri
vate collections. The exhibition
of paintings is accompanied by a
catalogue presenting biog
raphies of all the artists.
Well-researched
This material was gathered
from research done in the arc
hives of the Oakland museum
and information culled from
contemporary newspaper ac
counts.
The extent of local interest
taken in San Francisco artists at
the time has left a substantial
body of material which has been
brought together in a lucid form
by the catalogue.
In addition, the introductory
essay to the catalogue places the

show in the larger context of na
tional developments, describing
both the relevance of landscape
painting to the national identity
and the more specific local
framework within which the ar
tists worked.
Golden hinterland
The nine artists represented in
the show express what Califor
nia, the golden hinterland of the
American continent, meant to
the artists and writers who first
turned toward the West in the
early 1850s.
During the latter decades of
the 19th century, San Francisco
developed into a frontier center
of culture which provided a set
ting offering both patronage and
the comradeship of other artists.
Such factors produced, in the
period covered by the show, a
definable artistic movement.
