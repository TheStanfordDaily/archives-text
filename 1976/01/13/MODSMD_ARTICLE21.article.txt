# Dance company explores humanity
## 
### KAREN OLSON 
"Becoming Human â€” A Journey of Consciousness" was pre
sented by the Human Dancing Company (HDC) last Friday in Din
kelspiel Auditorium. The group traced three stages ot human de
velopment using various professional movement and dramatic
techniques.
In an effort to inspire the audience with awareness of unfulfilled
individual potential, the company chose body language theater as
its means of communication.
Part one of the program entailed the HDC's interpretation of
"peopleness." In several separate scenarios, the members pre
sented the outward, wordly aspects of human beings.
Stereotypes, lack of communication and inhibitions formed the
basis of these segments.
Especially effective in conveying its message without words was
the dance entitled "When Marriage Becomes Friendship." Margu
erite Zalud and Morgan Stryker explored with the audience mis
understandings common in marriage.
Part two encompassed the transition from "peopleness" to "in
dividualness," i.e., the "cocoon" stage. This act was highlighted by
the abstract interpretation of a Rite of Passage.
In this most artistically impressive segment of the program,
Zalud and HDC director Andre Carpenter symbolized the merging
of inner and outer selves into a fulfillment of the internal being.
The concluding stage signified the final metamorphosis from
Caterpillar to Butterfly. Attempting to inspire a conscious aware
ness within the audience, the company shed its material trap
pings (along with their clothes) and approached a total involve
ment in the existential world.
The entire production was staged effectively, conveying its mes
sage. Part one was very realistic and applicable to personal situa
tions. The members of the group symbolized various traits and
situations relating to most individuals at some time in their exis
tence.
The second and third parts became more abstract and therefore
harder to relate to personally as they explored vague areas of
consciousness. The final scene did not coordinate well, thereby
making it appear as if all the dancers were out of synch with each
other.
Otherwise, the dance movements were very professional and
combined with realistic humor and dramatic technique, conveying
an important message to the audience.
