Thai parliament dissolved
BANGKOK, Thailand — The king of Thai
land, acting on the advice of Premier Kukrit
Pramoj, dissolved the Thai parliament yesterday
on grounds that it contained too many political
parties and could not govern effectively.
A royal decree by King Bhumibol Adulyadej
ordered general elections for the National As
sembly to be held April 4. In the intervening
period Kukrit's government was to continue in
office but would not decide any major policy
issues.
The action by the king and Kukrit followed
attempts by the Socialist opposition to oust Kuk
rit's nine-month-old coalition government,
which is composed of IB parties. A vote of no
confidence was to be sought at a special session
of the assembly scheduled for today.
The assembly is composed of more than 25
political parties, most of which have mush
roomed since the country toppled a military
dictatorship in Oct. 1973 and established a civi
lian government.
Although the prime minister's own Social Ac
tion party controls only 18 seats in the lower
house, his coalition controlled a possible 161
votes of the 269-seat lower house of parliament.
African summit deadlocks
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The African
summit conference on Angola broke up in bitter
deadlock early Tuesday, and all three Angolan
factions said they planned to continue their civil
war.
A spokesman for the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced that the chiefs of states
and government heads from 46 African nations
decided to adjourn after three days of debate. He
said OAU officials would continue to study the
problem of the war in the former Portuguese
colony.
Another OAU summit six months ago created
a seven-nation conciliation commission that vis
ited Angola but failed to achieve a cease-fire.
The State Department in Washington said
Cuba was showing contempt for the OAU by
indicating it would ignore any call to withdraw
Cuban forces from Angola. A Cuban official has
been quoted by U.S. newsmen in Havana as say
ing "we would disregard a call from the OAU" to
withdraw from Angola.
These Africans also said the Angolan issue
could irreparably divide the OAU into pro-East,
pro-West and other factions, and thus leave Af
rica weaker than before the debate began.
The summit seemed united, however, on con
demnation of South Africa for sending troops
into Angola.
New violence in Spain
MADRID. Spain — New strikes and violence
erupted across Spain yesterday as police clashed
with students and workers in the most serious
* challenge yet to the government of King Juan
Carlos.
Police used tear gas and clubs against strikers
in the heart of the Spanish capital, then stormed
onto the Madrid University campus to club stu
dent demonstrators calling for democracy and a

general strike.
The wave of labor unrest idled more than
125,000 workers, threatened to upset the already
shaky economy and public services and bring on
more violence as the government sought a mid
dle road to liberalize the nation after 36 years of
dictatorial no-strike rule by the late Generalis
simo Francisco Franco.
The government blamed leftist "subversive
elements" for the unrest.
Police closed one Madrid subway line for
eight hours after a bomb wrecked rails and six
other time-bombs were found unexploded. No
injuries were reported.
In front of police headquarters, riot police
used batons and tear gas to break up an attemp
ted demonstration by an estimated 500 workers
and students. Witnesses said at least 10 de
monstrators were taken into police custody.
At the university, police stayed off the campus
for the first time in five years as classes began,
but later were called to rout an anti-government
demonstration. Leaders said the protests would
continue.
Ecuador imposes censorship
QUITO, Ecuador — Ecuador's two-day-old
military junta imposed tough censorship yes
terday after political leaders formed a Front of
Civic Unity and demanded the "return of power
to the people."
A decree by the three-man junta said that to
preserve peace and tranquility it was prohibit
ing all information "that attacks the constituted
order or honor and dignity of the members of
government."
The Front of Civic Unity, including leaders of
the Conservative, Socialist and Social Christian
parties, issued a communique calling on the
military to get out of the government that it has
controlled for nearly four years.
Commanders of the army, navy and air force
pressured President Guillemo Rodriguez Lara to
resign Sunday.His entire cabinet quit last week.
The new junta said it planned greater civilian
participation in the government but military
rule would continue for two more years.
Rodriguez Lara, a general who.had seized con
trol in a 1972 coup, told the officers who forced
him out that the military should turn the gov
ernment back to civilians as soon as possible.
Lebanese war intensified
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Fighting intensified yes
terday in Beirut and northern Lebanon with an
official casualty count of 71 killed and 122
wounded from dawn to dusk.
The U.S. Embassy was caught in a cross-fire
between warring Christian and Moslem private
armies and embassy personnel were driven to
their homes in bullet-proof cars.
Christian gunmen overnight established
blockade around Dbaieh, a camp housing 5,000
Palestinian refugees seven miles north, of the
capital.
"The army has been participating with the
isolationists (Phalangists) in shelling Dbaieh at
the rate of five bombs per minute," a guerrilla
spokesman charged. Left-wing Moslems and
their Palestinian allies claim the army sides with

the right-wing Christians because the officer
corps is dominated by Christians.

Stevens begins term
WASHINGTON — With Justice John Paul Ste
vens taking part for the first time, the Supreme
Court yesterday struck down a New York State
law designed to penalize unfair campaign prac
tices.
The court affirmed without comment and
without dissent a decision by a three-judge fed
eral court that the law violates the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of speech.
"Undoubtedly, deliberate calculated false
hoods when used by political candidates can
lead to public cynicism and apathy toward the
electoral process," the lower court said.
"However, when the state through the guise of
protecting the citizens' right to a fair and honest
election tampers with what it will permit the
citizen to see and hear, even that important state
interest must give way to the irresitible force of
protected expression under the First Amend
ment."
Nineteen states have laws or regulations gov
erning false campaign speech, but their provi
sions vary and would not necessarily be gov
erned by Monday's decision.
On other matters, the court:
—Agreed to review a three-judge federal
court's ruling upholding an Oklahoma law
under which women may buy beer at 18 years of
age but men must wait until they are 21.
—Declined, with Justices Byron White and
Harry Blackmun dissenting, toreviewa decision
striking down a California law which required
overtime pay for women but not for men.
More malpractice layoffs
LOS ANGELES — The total of hospital work
ers laid off or put on reduced salary jumped to
26,000 yesterday in the wake of a massive doc
tors' slowdown over soaring malpractice insur
ance rates, officials reported.
New tabulations found 4137 employeslaid off
and nearly 22,000 forced into salary reductions
at the 97 affected hospitals, out of 234 which
belong to the Southern California Hospital
Council.
The sharp increase from last Friday's figures
of about 3000 laid off and 17,000 reduced salary
workers came amid a growing protest from hos
pital employes caught in the slowdown's side
effects.
About 40 protesting workers picketed the of
fices of the Hospital Council for two hours yes
terday and said they would continue daily two
hour picketing until the dispute is settled.
In another development yesterday, the chiefs
of staff of 15 major Los Angeles hospitals threw
their support behind the slowdown. The sup
port was announced at a news conference at
Queen of Angeles Hospital by Dr. Laynard Hol
loman, who predicted a further slowdown at the
15 hospitals because of the support.

Agatha Christie dies
WALLINGFORD, England — Agatha Christie,
England's master of mystery fiction and creator
of the famed Belgian sleuth Hercule Foirot, died
yesterday. She was 85
Just months before Dame Agatha's death, she
let the mustachioed detective — played by Al
bert Finney in the 1975 movie version of Murder
on theOrient Express—die of natural causes after
solving his last case in Curtain.
In a 56-year career, Dame Agatha wrote 85
crime novels and 17 plays and was translated
into 103 languages. Her books sold more than
350 million copies, her publishers estimated,
making her one of the two best-selling authors in
history.
Poirot appeared in 42 of her books, including
the first. The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Cur
tain, in which Poirot died, was written more
than 30 years ago and was to have been pub
lished posthumously, but Dame Agatha
changed her mind and allowed publication last
September.
She was honored by Queen Elizabeth II in
1971 as a Dame of the British Empire, the equiva
lent of a knighthood.
One more Christie novel is yet to come, but the
publishers would not reveal its title.
FDA okays pot studies
CARBONDALE, 111. — Federally financed ex
periments testing the effects of marijuana on
human sexual response — labeled tax-paid de
bauchery by some opponents — could begin
within a week at Southern Illinois University.
A Food and Drug Administration public rela
tions man in Washington said yesterday the ex
periments, to be conducted by Dr. Harris Rubin,
have obtained the agency's "go-ahead."
Rubin said in a telephone interview he has
been told to expect within a week a response
from the Justice Department to his application
for a required grant of immunity from prosecu
tion.
"We are prepared to start almost im
mediately," Rubin said."Wehave all of our
stimuli, except the marijuana."
That will be supplied by the government.
Rubin last spring obtained a $121,000 grant
from the federal National Institute of Drug
Abuse to administer marijuana to paid male vol
unteers and measure their arousal as they view
stag films. Sex hormone levels will also be moni
tored.
All of the test subjects, he said, will be current
marijuana users of legal age and will be paid $10
to $20 a day for their participation.

Thai parliament dissolved
BANGKOK, Thailand — The king of Thai
land, acting on the advice of Premier Kukrit
Pramoj, dissolved the Thai parliament yesterday
on grounds that it contained too many political
parties and could not govern effectively.
A royal decree by King Bhumibol Adulyadej
ordered general elections for the National As
sembly to be held April 4. In the intervening
period Kukrit's government was to continue in
office but would not decide any major policy
issues.
The action by the king and Kukrit followed
attempts by the Socialist opposition to oust Kuk
rit's nine-month-old coalition government,
which is composed of IB parties. A vote of no
confidence was to be sought at a special session
of the assembly scheduled for today.
The assembly is composed of more than 25
political parties, most of which have mush
roomed since the country toppled a military
dictatorship in Oct. 1973 and established a civi
lian government.
Although the prime minister's own Social Ac
tion party controls only 18 seats in the lower
house, his coalition controlled a possible 161
votes of the 269-seat lower house of parliament.
African summit deadlocks
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The African
summit conference on Angola broke up in bitter
deadlock early Tuesday, and all three Angolan
factions said they planned to continue their civil
war.
A spokesman for the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced that the chiefs of states
and government heads from 46 African nations
decided to adjourn after three days of debate. He
said OAU officials would continue to study the
problem of the war in the former Portuguese
colony.
Another OAU summit six months ago created
a seven-nation conciliation commission that vis
ited Angola but failed to achieve a cease-fire.
The State Department in Washington said
Cuba was showing contempt for the OAU by
indicating it would ignore any call to withdraw
Cuban forces from Angola. A Cuban official has
been quoted by U.S. newsmen in Havana as say
ing "we would disregard a call from the OAU" to
withdraw from Angola.
These Africans also said the Angolan issue
could irreparably divide the OAU into pro-East,
pro-West and other factions, and thus leave Af
rica weaker than before the debate began.
The summit seemed united, however, on con
demnation of South Africa for sending troops
into Angola.
New violence in Spain
MADRID. Spain — New strikes and violence
erupted across Spain yesterday as police clashed
with students and workers in the most serious
* challenge yet to the government of King Juan
Carlos.
Police used tear gas and clubs against strikers
in the heart of the Spanish capital, then stormed
onto the Madrid University campus to club stu
dent demonstrators calling for democracy and a

general strike.
The wave of labor unrest idled more than
125,000 workers, threatened to upset the already
shaky economy and public services and bring on
more violence as the government sought a mid
dle road to liberalize the nation after 36 years of
dictatorial no-strike rule by the late Generalis
simo Francisco Franco.
The government blamed leftist "subversive
elements" for the unrest.
Police closed one Madrid subway line for
eight hours after a bomb wrecked rails and six
other time-bombs were found unexploded. No
injuries were reported.
In front of police headquarters, riot police
used batons and tear gas to break up an attemp
ted demonstration by an estimated 500 workers
and students. Witnesses said at least 10 de
monstrators were taken into police custody.
At the university, police stayed off the campus
for the first time in five years as classes began,
but later were called to rout an anti-government
demonstration. Leaders said the protests would
continue.
Ecuador imposes censorship
QUITO, Ecuador — Ecuador's two-day-old
military junta imposed tough censorship yes
terday after political leaders formed a Front of
Civic Unity and demanded the "return of power
to the people."
A decree by the three-man junta said that to
preserve peace and tranquility it was prohibit
ing all information "that attacks the constituted
order or honor and dignity of the members of
government."
The Front of Civic Unity, including leaders of
the Conservative, Socialist and Social Christian
parties, issued a communique calling on the
military to get out of the government that it has
controlled for nearly four years.
Commanders of the army, navy and air force
pressured President Guillemo Rodriguez Lara to
resign Sunday.His entire cabinet quit last week.
The new junta said it planned greater civilian
participation in the government but military
rule would continue for two more years.
Rodriguez Lara, a general who.had seized con
trol in a 1972 coup, told the officers who forced
him out that the military should turn the gov
ernment back to civilians as soon as possible.
Lebanese war intensified
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Fighting intensified yes
terday in Beirut and northern Lebanon with an
official casualty count of 71 killed and 122
wounded from dawn to dusk.
The U.S. Embassy was caught in a cross-fire
between warring Christian and Moslem private
armies and embassy personnel were driven to
their homes in bullet-proof cars.
Christian gunmen overnight established
blockade around Dbaieh, a camp housing 5,000
Palestinian refugees seven miles north, of the
capital.
"The army has been participating with the
isolationists (Phalangists) in shelling Dbaieh at
the rate of five bombs per minute," a guerrilla
spokesman charged. Left-wing Moslems and
their Palestinian allies claim the army sides with

the right-wing Christians because the officer
corps is dominated by Christians.

Stevens begins term
WASHINGTON — With Justice John Paul Ste
vens taking part for the first time, the Supreme
Court yesterday struck down a New York State
law designed to penalize unfair campaign prac
tices.
The court affirmed without comment and
without dissent a decision by a three-judge fed
eral court that the law violates the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of speech.
"Undoubtedly, deliberate calculated false
hoods when used by political candidates can
lead to public cynicism and apathy toward the
electoral process," the lower court said.
"However, when the state through the guise of
protecting the citizens' right to a fair and honest
election tampers with what it will permit the
citizen to see and hear, even that important state
interest must give way to the irresitible force of
protected expression under the First Amend
ment."
Nineteen states have laws or regulations gov
erning false campaign speech, but their provi
sions vary and would not necessarily be gov
erned by Monday's decision.
On other matters, the court:
—Agreed to review a three-judge federal
court's ruling upholding an Oklahoma law
under which women may buy beer at 18 years of
age but men must wait until they are 21.
—Declined, with Justices Byron White and
Harry Blackmun dissenting, toreviewa decision
striking down a California law which required
overtime pay for women but not for men.
More malpractice layoffs
LOS ANGELES — The total of hospital work
ers laid off or put on reduced salary jumped to
26,000 yesterday in the wake of a massive doc
tors' slowdown over soaring malpractice insur
ance rates, officials reported.
New tabulations found 4137 employeslaid off
and nearly 22,000 forced into salary reductions
at the 97 affected hospitals, out of 234 which
belong to the Southern California Hospital
Council.
The sharp increase from last Friday's figures
of about 3000 laid off and 17,000 reduced salary
workers came amid a growing protest from hos
pital employes caught in the slowdown's side
effects.
About 40 protesting workers picketed the of
fices of the Hospital Council for two hours yes
terday and said they would continue daily two
hour picketing until the dispute is settled.
In another development yesterday, the chiefs
of staff of 15 major Los Angeles hospitals threw
their support behind the slowdown. The sup
port was announced at a news conference at
Queen of Angeles Hospital by Dr. Laynard Hol
loman, who predicted a further slowdown at the
15 hospitals because of the support.

Agatha Christie dies
WALLINGFORD, England — Agatha Christie,
England's master of mystery fiction and creator
of the famed Belgian sleuth Hercule Foirot, died
yesterday. She was 85
Just months before Dame Agatha's death, she
let the mustachioed detective — played by Al
bert Finney in the 1975 movie version of Murder
on theOrient Express—die of natural causes after
solving his last case in Curtain.
In a 56-year career, Dame Agatha wrote 85
crime novels and 17 plays and was translated
into 103 languages. Her books sold more than
350 million copies, her publishers estimated,
making her one of the two best-selling authors in
history.
Poirot appeared in 42 of her books, including
the first. The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Cur
tain, in which Poirot died, was written more
than 30 years ago and was to have been pub
lished posthumously, but Dame Agatha
changed her mind and allowed publication last
September.
She was honored by Queen Elizabeth II in
1971 as a Dame of the British Empire, the equiva
lent of a knighthood.
One more Christie novel is yet to come, but the
publishers would not reveal its title.
FDA okays pot studies
CARBONDALE, 111. — Federally financed ex
periments testing the effects of marijuana on
human sexual response — labeled tax-paid de
bauchery by some opponents — could begin
within a week at Southern Illinois University.
A Food and Drug Administration public rela
tions man in Washington said yesterday the ex
periments, to be conducted by Dr. Harris Rubin,
have obtained the agency's "go-ahead."
Rubin said in a telephone interview he has
been told to expect within a week a response
from the Justice Department to his application
for a required grant of immunity from prosecu
tion.
"We are prepared to start almost im
mediately," Rubin said."Wehave all of our
stimuli, except the marijuana."
That will be supplied by the government.
Rubin last spring obtained a $121,000 grant
from the federal National Institute of Drug
Abuse to administer marijuana to paid male vol
unteers and measure their arousal as they view
stag films. Sex hormone levels will also be moni

All of the test subjects, he said, will be current

A Food and Drug Administration public rela
tions man in Washington said yesterday the ex
periments, to be conducted by Dr. Harris Rubin,
have obtained the agency's "go-ahead."
Rubin said in a telephone interview he has
been told to expect within a week a response
from the Justice Department to his application
for a required grant of immunity from prosecu
tion.
"We are prepared to start almost im
mediately," Rubin said."Wehave all of our
stimuli, except the marijuana."
That will be supplied by the government.
Rubin last spring obtained a $121,000 grant
from the federal National Institute of Drug
Abuse to administer marijuana to paid male vol
unteers and measure their arousal as they view
stag films. Sex hormone levels will also be moni
tored.
All of the test subjects, he said, will be current
marijuana users of legal age and will be paid $10
to $20 a day for their participation.

Thai parliament dissolved
BANGKOK, Thailand — The king of Thai
land, acting on the advice of Premier Kukrit
Pramoj, dissolved the Thai parliament yesterday
on grounds that it contained too many political
parties and could not govern effectively.
A royal decree by King Bhumibol Adulyadej
ordered general elections for the National As
sembly to be held April 4. In the intervening
period Kukrit's government was to continue in
office but would not decide any major policy
issues.
The action by the king and Kukrit followed
attempts by the Socialist opposition to oust Kuk
rit's nine-month-old coalition government,
which is composed of IB parties. A vote of no
confidence was to be sought at a special session
of the assembly scheduled for today.
The assembly is composed of more than 25
political parties, most of which have mush
roomed since the country toppled a military
dictatorship in Oct. 1973 and established a civi
lian government.
Although the prime minister's own Social Ac
tion party controls only 18 seats in the lower
house, his coalition controlled a possible 161
votes of the 269-seat lower house of parliament.
African summit deadlocks
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The African
summit conference on Angola broke up in bitter
deadlock early Tuesday, and all three Angolan
factions said they planned to continue their civil
war.
A spokesman for the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced that the chiefs of states
and government heads from 46 African nations
decided to adjourn after three days of debate. He
said OAU officials would continue to study the
problem of the war in the former Portuguese
colony.
Another OAU summit six months ago created
a seven-nation conciliation commission that vis
ited Angola but failed to achieve a cease-fire.
The State Department in Washington said
Cuba was showing contempt for the OAU by
indicating it would ignore any call to withdraw
Cuban forces from Angola. A Cuban official has
been quoted by U.S. newsmen in Havana as say
ing "we would disregard a call from the OAU" to
withdraw from Angola.
These Africans also said the Angolan issue
could irreparably divide the OAU into pro-East,
pro-West and other factions, and thus leave Af
rica weaker than before the debate began.
The summit seemed united, however, on con
demnation of South Africa for sending troops
into Angola.
New violence in Spain
MADRID. Spain — New strikes and violence
erupted across Spain yesterday as police clashed
with students and workers in the most serious
* challenge yet to the government of King Juan
Carlos.
Police used tear gas and clubs against strikers
in the heart of the Spanish capital, then stormed
onto the Madrid University campus to club stu
dent demonstrators calling for democracy and a

general strike.
The wave of labor unrest idled more than
125,000 workers, threatened to upset the already
shaky economy and public services and bring on
more violence as the government sought a mid
dle road to liberalize the nation after 36 years of
dictatorial no-strike rule by the late Generalis
simo Francisco Franco.
The government blamed leftist "subversive
elements" for the unrest.
Police closed one Madrid subway line for
eight hours after a bomb wrecked rails and six
other time-bombs were found unexploded. No
injuries were reported.
In front of police headquarters, riot police
used batons and tear gas to break up an attemp
ted demonstration by an estimated 500 workers
and students. Witnesses said at least 10 de
monstrators were taken into police custody.
At the university, police stayed off the campus
for the first time in five years as classes began,
but later were called to rout an anti-government
demonstration. Leaders said the protests would
continue.
Ecuador imposes censorship
QUITO, Ecuador — Ecuador's two-day-old
military junta imposed tough censorship yes
terday after political leaders formed a Front of
Civic Unity and demanded the "return of power
to the people."
A decree by the three-man junta said that to
preserve peace and tranquility it was prohibit
ing all information "that attacks the constituted
order or honor and dignity of the members of
government."
The Front of Civic Unity, including leaders of
the Conservative, Socialist and Social Christian
parties, issued a communique calling on the
military to get out of the government that it has
controlled for nearly four years.
Commanders of the army, navy and air force
pressured President Guillemo Rodriguez Lara to
resign Sunday.His entire cabinet quit last week.
The new junta said it planned greater civilian
participation in the government but military
rule would continue for two more years.
Rodriguez Lara, a general who.had seized con
trol in a 1972 coup, told the officers who forced
him out that the military should turn the gov
ernment back to civilians as soon as possible.
Lebanese war intensified
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Fighting intensified yes
terday in Beirut and northern Lebanon with an
official casualty count of 71 killed and 122
wounded from dawn to dusk.
The U.S. Embassy was caught in a cross-fire
between warring Christian and Moslem private
armies and embassy personnel were driven to
their homes in bullet-proof cars.
Christian gunmen overnight established
blockade around Dbaieh, a camp housing 5,000
Palestinian refugees seven miles north, of the
capital.
"The army has been participating with the
isolationists (Phalangists) in shelling Dbaieh at
the rate of five bombs per minute," a guerrilla
spokesman charged. Left-wing Moslems and
their Palestinian allies claim the army sides with

the right-wing Christians because the officer
corps is dominated by Christians.

Stevens begins term
WASHINGTON — With Justice John Paul Ste
vens taking part for the first time, the Supreme
Court yesterday struck down a New York State
law designed to penalize unfair campaign prac
tices.
The court affirmed without comment and
without dissent a decision by a three-judge fed
eral court that the law violates the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of speech.
"Undoubtedly, deliberate calculated false
hoods when used by political candidates can
lead to public cynicism and apathy toward the
electoral process," the lower court said.
"However, when the state through the guise of
protecting the citizens' right to a fair and honest
election tampers with what it will permit the
citizen to see and hear, even that important state
interest must give way to the irresitible force of
protected expression under the First Amend
ment."
Nineteen states have laws or regulations gov
erning false campaign speech, but their provi
sions vary and would not necessarily be gov
erned by Monday's decision.
On other matters, the court:
—Agreed to review a three-judge federal
court's ruling upholding an Oklahoma law
under which women may buy beer at 18 years of
age but men must wait until they are 21.
—Declined, with Justices Byron White and
Harry Blackmun dissenting, toreviewa decision
striking down a California law which required
overtime pay for women but not for men.
More malpractice layoffs
LOS ANGELES — The total of hospital work
ers laid off or put on reduced salary jumped to
26,000 yesterday in the wake of a massive doc
tors' slowdown over soaring malpractice insur
ance rates, officials reported.
New tabulations found 4137 employeslaid off
and nearly 22,000 forced into salary reductions
at the 97 affected hospitals, out of 234 which
belong to the Southern California Hospital
Council.
The sharp increase from last Friday's figures
of about 3000 laid off and 17,000 reduced salary
workers came amid a growing protest from hos
pital employes caught in the slowdown's side
effects.
About 40 protesting workers picketed the of
fices of the Hospital Council for two hours yes
terday and said they would continue daily two
hour picketing until the dispute is settled.
In another development yesterday, the chiefs
of staff of 15 major Los Angeles hospitals threw
their support behind the slowdown. The sup
port was announced at a news conference at
Queen of Angeles Hospital by Dr. Laynard Hol
loman, who predicted a further slowdown at the
15 hospitals because of the support.

Agatha Christie dies
WALLINGFORD, England — Agatha Christie,
England's master of mystery fiction and creator
of the famed Belgian sleuth Hercule Foirot, died
yesterday. She was 85
Just months before Dame Agatha's death, she
let the mustachioed detective — played by Al
bert Finney in the 1975 movie version of Murder
on theOrient Express—die of natural causes after
solving his last case in Curtain.
In a 56-year career, Dame Agatha wrote 85
crime novels and 17 plays and was translated
into 103 languages. Her books sold more than
350 million copies, her publishers estimated,
making her one of the two best-selling authors in
history.
Poirot appeared in 42 of her books, including
the first. The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Cur
tain, in which Poirot died, was written more
than 30 years ago and was to have been pub
lished posthumously, but Dame Agatha
changed her mind and allowed publication last
September.
She was honored by Queen Elizabeth II in
1971 as a Dame of the British Empire, the equiva
lent of a knighthood.
One more Christie novel is yet to come, but the
publishers would not reveal its title.

FDA okays pot studies
CARBONDALE, 111. — Federally financed ex
periments testing the effects of marijuana on
human sexual response — labeled tax-paid de
bauchery by some opponents — could begin
within a week at Southern Illinois University.
A Food and Drug Administration public rela
tions man in Washington said yesterday the ex
periments, to be conducted by Dr. Harris Rubin,
have obtained the agency's "go-ahead."
Rubin said in a telephone interview he has
been told to expect within a week a response
from the Justice Department to his application
for a required grant of immunity from prosecu
tion.
"We are prepared to start almost im
mediately," Rubin said."Wehave all of our
stimuli, except the marijuana."
That will be supplied by the government.
Rubin last spring obtained a $121,000 grant
from the federal National Institute of Drug
Abuse to administer marijuana to paid male vol
unteers and measure their arousal as they view
stag films. Sex hormone levels will also be moni
tored.
All of the test subjects, he said, will be current
marijuana users of legal age and will be paid $10
to $20 a day for their participation.

Thai parliament dissolved
BANGKOK, Thailand — The king of Thai
land, acting on the advice of Premier Kukrit
Pramoj, dissolved the Thai parliament yesterday
on grounds that it contained too many political
parties and could not govern effectively.
A royal decree by King Bhumibol Adulyadej
ordered general elections for the National As
sembly to be held April 4. In the intervening
period Kukrit's government was to continue in
office but would not decide any major policy
issues.
The action by the king and Kukrit followed
attempts by the Socialist opposition to oust Kuk
rit's nine-month-old coalition government,
which is composed of IB parties. A vote of no
confidence was to be sought at a special session
of the assembly scheduled for today.
The assembly is composed of more than 25
political parties, most of which have mush
roomed since the country toppled a military
dictatorship in Oct. 1973 and established a civi
lian government.
Although the prime minister's own Social Ac
tion party controls only 18 seats in the lower
house, his coalition controlled a possible 161
votes of the 269-seat lower house of parliament.
African summit deadlocks
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The African
summit conference on Angola broke up in bitter
deadlock early Tuesday, and all three Angolan
factions said they planned to continue their civil
war.
A spokesman for the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced that the chiefs of states
and government heads from 46 African nations
decided to adjourn after three days of debate. He
said OAU officials would continue to study the
problem of the war in the former Portuguese
colony.
Another OAU summit six months ago created
a seven-nation conciliation commission that vis
ited Angola but failed to achieve a cease-fire.
The State Department in Washington said
Cuba was showing contempt for the OAU by
indicating it would ignore any call to withdraw
Cuban forces from Angola. A Cuban official has
been quoted by U.S. newsmen in Havana as say
ing "we would disregard a call from the OAU" to
withdraw from Angola.
These Africans also said the Angolan issue
could irreparably divide the OAU into pro-East,
pro-West and other factions, and thus leave Af
rica weaker than before the debate began.
The summit seemed united, however, on con
demnation of South Africa for sending troops
into Angola.
New violence in Spain
MADRID. Spain — New strikes and violence
erupted across Spain yesterday as police clashed
with students and workers in the most serious
* challenge yet to the government of King Juan
Carlos.
Police used tear gas and clubs against strikers
in the heart of the Spanish capital, then stormed
onto the Madrid University campus to club stu
dent demonstrators calling for democracy and a

general strike.
The wave of labor unrest idled more than
125,000 workers, threatened to upset the already
shaky economy and public services and bring on
more violence as the government sought a mid
dle road to liberalize the nation after 36 years of
dictatorial no-strike rule by the late Generalis
simo Francisco Franco.
The government blamed leftist "subversive
elements" for the unrest.
Police closed one Madrid subway line for
eight hours after a bomb wrecked rails and six
other time-bombs were found unexploded. No
injuries were reported.
In front of police headquarters, riot police
used batons and tear gas to break up an attemp
ted demonstration by an estimated 500 workers
and students. Witnesses said at least 10 de
monstrators were taken into police custody.
At the university, police stayed off the campus
for the first time in five years as classes began,
but later were called to rout an anti-government
demonstration. Leaders said the protests would
continue.
Ecuador imposes censorship
QUITO, Ecuador — Ecuador's two-day-old
military junta imposed tough censorship yes
terday after political leaders formed a Front of
Civic Unity and demanded the "return of power
to the people."
A decree by the three-man junta said that to
preserve peace and tranquility it was prohibit
ing all information "that attacks the constituted
order or honor and dignity of the members of
government."
The Front of Civic Unity, including leaders of
the Conservative, Socialist and Social Christian
parties, issued a communique calling on the
military to get out of the government that it has
controlled for nearly four years.
Commanders of the army, navy and air force
pressured President Guillemo Rodriguez Lara to
resign Sunday.His entire cabinet quit last week.
The new junta said it planned greater civilian
participation in the government but military
rule would continue for two more years.
Rodriguez Lara, a general who.had seized con
trol in a 1972 coup, told the officers who forced
him out that the military should turn the gov
ernment back to civilians as soon as possible.
Lebanese war intensified
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Fighting intensified yes
terday in Beirut and northern Lebanon with an
official casualty count of 71 killed and 122
wounded from dawn to dusk.
The U.S. Embassy was caught in a cross-fire
between warring Christian and Moslem private
armies and embassy personnel were driven to
their homes in bullet-proof cars.
Christian gunmen overnight established
blockade around Dbaieh, a camp housing 5,000
Palestinian refugees seven miles north, of the
capital.
"The army has been participating with the
isolationists (Phalangists) in shelling Dbaieh at
the rate of five bombs per minute," a guerrilla
spokesman charged. Left-wing Moslems and
their Palestinian allies claim the army sides with

the right-wing Christians because the officer
corps is dominated by Christians.

Stevens begins term
WASHINGTON — With Justice John Paul Ste
vens taking part for the first time, the Supreme
Court yesterday struck down a New York State
law designed to penalize unfair campaign prac
tices.
The court affirmed without comment and
without dissent a decision by a three-judge fed
eral court that the law violates the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of speech.
"Undoubtedly, deliberate calculated false
hoods when used by political candidates can
lead to public cynicism and apathy toward the
electoral process," the lower court said.
"However, when the state through the guise of
protecting the citizens' right to a fair and honest
election tampers with what it will permit the
citizen to see and hear, even that important state
interest must give way to the irresitible force of
protected expression under the First Amend
ment."
Nineteen states have laws or regulations gov
erning false campaign speech, but their provi
sions vary and would not necessarily be gov
erned by Monday's decision.
On other matters, the court:
—Agreed to review a three-judge federal
court's ruling upholding an Oklahoma law
under which women may buy beer at 18 years of
age but men must wait until they are 21.
—Declined, with Justices Byron White and
Harry Blackmun dissenting, toreviewa decision
striking down a California law which required
overtime pay for women but not for men.
More malpractice layoffs
LOS ANGELES — The total of hospital work
ers laid off or put on reduced salary jumped to
26,000 yesterday in the wake of a massive doc
tors' slowdown over soaring malpractice insur
ance rates, officials reported.
New tabulations found 4137 employeslaid off
and nearly 22,000 forced into salary reductions
at the 97 affected hospitals, out of 234 which
belong to the Southern California Hospital
Council.
The sharp increase from last Friday's figures
of about 3000 laid off and 17,000 reduced salary
workers came amid a growing protest from hos
pital employes caught in the slowdown's side
effects.
About 40 protesting workers picketed the of
fices of the Hospital Council for two hours yes
terday and said they would continue daily two
hour picketing until the dispute is settled.
In another development yesterday, the chiefs
of staff of 15 major Los Angeles hospitals threw
their support behind the slowdown. The sup
port was announced at a news conference at
Queen of Angeles Hospital by Dr. Laynard Hol
loman, who predicted a further slowdown at the
15 hospitals because of the support.

Agatha Christie dies

Just months before Dame Agatha's death, she
let the mustachioed detective — played by Al

In a 56-year career, Dame Agatha wrote 85

of the famed Belgian sleuth Hercule Foirot, died
yesterday. She was 85
Just months before Dame Agatha's death, she
let the mustachioed detective — played by Al
bert Finney in the 1975 movie version of Murder
on theOrient Express—die of natural causes after
solving his last case in Curtain.
In a 56-year career, Dame Agatha wrote 85
crime novels and 17 plays and was translated
into 103 languages. Her books sold more than
350 million copies, her publishers estimated,
making her one of the two best-selling authors in
history.
Poirot appeared in 42 of her books, including
the first. The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Cur
tain, in which Poirot died, was written more
than 30 years ago and was to have been pub
lished posthumously, but Dame Agatha
changed her mind and allowed publication last
September.
She was honored by Queen Elizabeth II in
1971 as a Dame of the British Empire, the equiva
lent of a knighthood.
One more Christie novel is yet to come, but the
publishers would not reveal its title.
FDA okays pot studies
CARBONDALE, 111. — Federally financed ex
periments testing the effects of marijuana on
human sexual response — labeled tax-paid de
bauchery by some opponents — could begin
within a week at Southern Illinois University.
A Food and Drug Administration public rela
tions man in Washington said yesterday the ex
periments, to be conducted by Dr. Harris Rubin,
have obtained the agency's "go-ahead."
Rubin said in a telephone interview he has
been told to expect within a week a response
from the Justice Department to his application
for a required grant of immunity from prosecu
tion.
"We are prepared to start almost im
mediately," Rubin said."Wehave all of our
stimuli, except the marijuana."
That will be supplied by the government.
Rubin last spring obtained a $121,000 grant
from the federal National Institute of Drug
Abuse to administer marijuana to paid male vol
unteers and measure their arousal as they view
stag films. Sex hormone levels will also be moni
tored.
All of the test subjects, he said, will be current
marijuana users of legal age and will be paid $10
to $20 a day for their participation.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy through this afternoon with
patches of fog early today. Increasing cloudi ness
this afternoon then chance of rain tonight and
rain likely tomorrow. Not so cold tonight. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs today

winds becoming southerly 10 to 25 mph tonight.
Thai parliament dissolved
BANGKOK, Thailand — The king of Thai
land, acting on the advice of Premier Kukrit
Pramoj, dissolved the Thai parliament yesterday
on grounds that it contained too many political
parties and could not govern effectively.
A royal decree by King Bhumibol Adulyadej
ordered general elections for the National As
sembly to be held April 4. In the intervening
period Kukrit's government was to continue in
office but would not decide any major policy
issues.
The action by the king and Kukrit followed
attempts by the Socialist opposition to oust Kuk
rit's nine-month-old coalition government,
which is composed of IB parties. A vote of no
confidence was to be sought at a special session
of the assembly scheduled for today.
The assembly is composed of more than 25
political parties, most of which have mush
roomed since the country toppled a military
dictatorship in Oct. 1973 and established a civi
lian government.
Although the prime minister's own Social Ac
tion party controls only 18 seats in the lower
house, his coalition controlled a possible 161
votes of the 269-seat lower house of parliament.
African summit deadlocks
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The African
summit conference on Angola broke up in bitter
deadlock early Tuesday, and all three Angolan
factions said they planned to continue their civil
war.
A spokesman for the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) announced that the chiefs of states
and government heads from 46 African nations
decided to adjourn after three days of debate. He
said OAU officials would continue to study the
problem of the war in the former Portuguese
colony.
Another OAU summit six months ago created
a seven-nation conciliation commission that vis
ited Angola but failed to achieve a cease-fire.
The State Department in Washington said
Cuba was showing contempt for the OAU by
indicating it would ignore any call to withdraw
Cuban forces from Angola. A Cuban official has
been quoted by U.S. newsmen in Havana as say
ing "we would disregard a call from the OAU" to
withdraw from Angola.
These Africans also said the Angolan issue
could irreparably divide the OAU into pro-East,
pro-West and other factions, and thus leave Af
rica weaker than before the debate began.
The summit seemed united, however, on con
demnation of South Africa for sending troops
into Angola.
New violence in Spain
MADRID. Spain — New strikes and violence
erupted across Spain yesterday as police clashed
with students and workers in the most serious
* challenge yet to the government of King Juan
Carlos.
Police used tear gas and clubs against strikers
in the heart of the Spanish capital, then stormed
onto the Madrid University campus to club stu
dent demonstrators calling for democracy and a

general strike.
The wave of labor unrest idled more than
125,000 workers, threatened to upset the already
shaky economy and public services and bring on
more violence as the government sought a mid
dle road to liberalize the nation after 36 years of
dictatorial no-strike rule by the late Generalis
simo Francisco Franco.
The government blamed leftist "subversive
elements" for the unrest.
Police closed one Madrid subway line for
eight hours after a bomb wrecked rails and six
other time-bombs were found unexploded. No
injuries were reported.
In front of police headquarters, riot police
used batons and tear gas to break up an attemp
ted demonstration by an estimated 500 workers
and students. Witnesses said at least 10 de
monstrators were taken into police custody.
At the university, police stayed off the campus
for the first time in five years as classes began,
but later were called to rout an anti-government
demonstration. Leaders said the protests would
continue.
Ecuador imposes censorship
QUITO, Ecuador — Ecuador's two-day-old
military junta imposed tough censorship yes
terday after political leaders formed a Front of
Civic Unity and demanded the "return of power
to the people."
A decree by the three-man junta said that to
preserve peace and tranquility it was prohibit
ing all information "that attacks the constituted
order or honor and dignity of the members of
government."
The Front of Civic Unity, including leaders of
the Conservative, Socialist and Social Christian
parties, issued a communique calling on the
military to get out of the government that it has
controlled for nearly four years.
Commanders of the army, navy and air force
pressured President Guillemo Rodriguez Lara to
resign Sunday.His entire cabinet quit last week.
The new junta said it planned greater civilian
participation in the government but military
rule would continue for two more years.
Rodriguez Lara, a general who.had seized con
trol in a 1972 coup, told the officers who forced
him out that the military should turn the gov
ernment back to civilians as soon as possible.
Lebanese war intensified
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Fighting intensified yes
terday in Beirut and northern Lebanon with an
official casualty count of 71 killed and 122
wounded from dawn to dusk.
The U.S. Embassy was caught in a cross-fire
between warring Christian and Moslem private
armies and embassy personnel were driven to
their homes in bullet-proof cars.
Christian gunmen overnight established
blockade around Dbaieh, a camp housing 5,000
Palestinian refugees seven miles north, of the
capital.
"The army has been participating with the
isolationists (Phalangists) in shelling Dbaieh at
the rate of five bombs per minute," a guerrilla
spokesman charged. Left-wing Moslems and
their Palestinian allies claim the army sides with

the right-wing Christians because the officer
corps is dominated by Christians.

Stevens begins term
WASHINGTON — With Justice John Paul Ste
vens taking part for the first time, the Supreme
Court yesterday struck down a New York State
law designed to penalize unfair campaign prac
tices.
The court affirmed without comment and
without dissent a decision by a three-judge fed
eral court that the law violates the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of speech.
"Undoubtedly, deliberate calculated false
hoods when used by political candidates can
lead to public cynicism and apathy toward the
electoral process," the lower court said.
"However, when the state through the guise of
protecting the citizens' right to a fair and honest
election tampers with what it will permit the
citizen to see and hear, even that important state
interest must give way to the irresitible force of
protected expression under the First Amend
ment."
Nineteen states have laws or regulations gov
erning false campaign speech, but their provi
sions vary and would not necessarily be gov
erned by Monday's decision.
On other matters, the court:
—Agreed to review a three-judge federal
court's ruling upholding an Oklahoma law
under which women may buy beer at 18 years of
age but men must wait until they are 21.
—Declined, with Justices Byron White and
Harry Blackmun dissenting, toreviewa decision
striking down a California law which required
overtime pay for women but not for men.
More malpractice layoffs
LOS ANGELES — The total of hospital work
ers laid off or put on reduced salary jumped to
26,000 yesterday in the wake of a massive doc
tors' slowdown over soaring malpractice insur
ance rates, officials reported.
New tabulations found 4137 employeslaid off
and nearly 22,000 forced into salary reductions
at the 97 affected hospitals, out of 234 which
belong to the Southern California Hospital
Council.
The sharp increase from last Friday's figures
of about 3000 laid off and 17,000 reduced salary
workers came amid a growing protest from hos
pital employes caught in the slowdown's side
effects.
About 40 protesting workers picketed the of
fices of the Hospital Council for two hours yes
terday and said they would continue daily two
hour picketing until the dispute is settled.
In another development yesterday, the chiefs
of staff of 15 major Los Angeles hospitals threw
their support behind the slowdown. The sup
port was announced at a news conference at
Queen of Angeles Hospital by Dr. Laynard Hol
loman, who predicted a further slowdown at the
15 hospitals because of the support.
