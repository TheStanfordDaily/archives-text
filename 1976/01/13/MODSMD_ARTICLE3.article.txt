# Bonfire controversy reviewed
## 
### STEPHEN CROLIUS 
In an effort to take the wind out of the "overblown" Big
Game Bonfire issue before it stirs up the proverbial tem
pest next autumn, Director of Student Activities Thomas
Massey met with representatives from the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC), the Council of Presidents and the student
body at large yesterday to gather "impressions" of the
success of last autumn's Bonfire.
Massey said he wou Id submit a recommendation within
a week based on what occurred at the meeting to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
Bill Christopher, president of last autumn's Bonfire
Committee, and Bob Ottilie, president of the IFC, reported
on the problems encountered in the planning and execu
tion of last autumn's blaze and made suggestions as to
how the event might be improved.
Bill Christopher said "there's no reason why we can't
have a 'perfect' Bonfire next year."
Ottilie summed up his impression of the last Bonfire by
saying,"lt was a tremendous event."
Alternatives stressed
ASSU President Lee Rosenbaum said since "no one
really knows how the student body feels (about the Bon
fire) . .. (everyone) should be more open-minded about

alternatives." Rosenbaum cited the ASSU-sponsored
dance held the night of last autumn's Bonfire, as an exam
ple of a "reasonable" alternative.
Elaine Andersen, a terminal graduate student in lin
guistics, indicated she did not wish to see the Bonfire
discontinued, but was "concerned with the impact (of the
Bonfire) on the environment."
Massey has written to the Bay Area Air Pollution Con
trol District asking if it has received any complaints fol
lowing last autumn's blaze from the surrounding com
munities, also requesting an assessment of the fire's en
vironmental impact.
Consensus sought
Lyons said he hopes to learn from Massey's recommen
dation whether there is a "consensus of opinion right now
about what should be done with the Bonfire." Lyons was
not sure when he would announce his decision on next
year's Bonfire.
Massey said in his recommendation he would stress the
"logistics" of the fire, such as crowd control, traffic prob
lems and safety, as the Bonfire "never was a big polluter
. . . (and) now its been greatly reduced. Whether the logis
tics of the problem are enough for him (Lyons) to stop it, I
don't know."
