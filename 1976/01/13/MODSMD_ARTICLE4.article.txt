# Ruling on USE grievance: Union activities no factor
## 
### KAREN CAESAR 
A grievance filed by William
Reynolds, assistant president of Un
ited Stanford Employees (USE), repor
tedly alleging unfair anti-union Uni
versity activities, has been denied.
Patricia Devaney, assistant to the
vice provost for research and the hear
ing officer in the case, overruled con
tentions that the University had been
inconsistent in explanations about
Reynolds' layoff.
According to USE President Jim
Berk, the University said it laid off
Reynolds, formerly a machinist at
Hansen Laboratories, because there
was not enough work.
But the hearing's "most revealing
fact" was that there are five men each
doing more than a normal workload at
Hansen, Berk said. The real reason for
the layoff, Berk contended, was
Reynolds' union activities.
"He was a thorn in their side, and
they wanted to get rid of him," Berk
said. "He was a very effective grie
vance representative."
Work overloads?
But work overloads at Hansen "did
not directly result in the laying off of
William Reynolds," Devaney ruled.
The union-University contract does
guarantee that non-union members
should not do unit work to the extent
that a unit (union) worker is laid off,
according to Devaney. The five Han
sen workers are not union members,
Berk said. However, this provision
would not apply if the Devaney ruling
is upheld.
The men have "exempt" status;
that is, they receive no overtime pay
but have a better retirement plan than
union members because of University
policy, Berk said.
Outside arbitration
"The next step in the grievance pro
cess is that if either side is not happy
with the hearing outcome, they can
take it to an outside hearing officer not
affiliated with the University. This is
considered binding arbitration. The
grievance can't go any further: the
outside arbitrator's decision is final.
This is under the contract," Devaney
said.
Last Thursday and Friday, USE

staged an "informational protest" out
side Encina Hall and Old Pavilion. The
union contract bans picketing, accord
ing to a letter sent to the union Jan. 8 by
Douglas Barton, staff counsel for
employe relations.
"It was a protest line, not a picket
line," Berk said. "A picket is a line to
keep workers from entering their place
of employment. . . We're not asking
people to stop working or to cause
slowdowns."
Protestors did not return yesterday.
Barton defined picketing as a gather

ing of workers with "placards on
sticks." Law Prof. William Gould de
fined picketing as "the patrolling of a
geographical area with some kind of
placard."
Gould drew a distinction between
"publicity picketing" and "signal pic
keting."
"Publicity picketing is to educate,
advise the public about unfair condi
tions," he said. Signal picketing is"an
attempt to dissuade the employes from
going to work or delivering goods to a
particular establishment."
